<text>The Prince and the Pauper is a novel by American author Mark Twain. It was first published in 1881 in Canada, before its 1882 publication in the United States. The novel represents Twain&#x27;s first attempt at historical fiction. The plot concerns the accession of nine-year-old Edward VI of England in 1547 and his interactions with look-alike Tom Canty, a London pauper who lives with his abusive, alcoholic father.

==Plot==

Tom Canty, the youngest child of a very poor family living in Offal Court, located in London, England, has been abused by his father and grandmother but is encouraged by the local priest, who taught him to read and write. Loitering around the Palace of Westminster gates one day, Tom sees Edward Tudor, the Prince of Wales. Coming too close in his intense excitement, he is caught and nearly beaten by the royal guards. However, Edward stops them and invites Tom into his palace chamber. There, the two boys get to know one another and are fascinated by each other&#x27;s lives. They have an uncanny resemblance to each other and learn they were even born on the same day, so they decide to swap clothes &quot;temporarily&quot;. Edward hides an item, which the reader later learns is the Great Seal of England, and goes outside to confront the guards who abused Tom; however, dressed as Tom, he is not recognized by the guards, who drive him from the palace.

Tom, dressed as Edward, tries to cope with court customs and manners after being mistaken for the prince. Edward&#x27;s father, King Henry VIII, his fellow nobles, and the palace staff think the prince has an illness that has caused memory loss and fear he will go mad. After King Henry dies, Tom is repeatedly asked about the missing Great Seal of England, but he knows nothing about it. However, when Tom is asked to sit in on judgments, his common-sense observations reassure them that his mind is sound.

Edward eventually finds his way through the streets to the Canty home, where the Canty family believes him to be Tom. There, he is subjected to the brutality of Tom&#x27;s alcoholic father, from whom he manages to escape, and meets Miles Hendon, a soldier and nobleman returning from war. Although Miles does not believe Edward&#x27;s claims to royalty, he humors him and becomes his protector. Meanwhile, news reaches them that King Henry has died and Edward has become king.

As Edward experiences the brutal life of a London pauper firsthand, he becomes aware of the stark class inequality in England. In particular, he sees the harsh, punitive nature of the English judicial system, under which people are burned at the stake, pilloried, and flogged. He realizes that the accused are convicted on flimsy evidence and branded or hanged for petty offenses, and he vows to reign with mercy when he regains his rightful place. When Edward declares to a gang of thieves that he is the king and will put an end to unjust laws, they assume he is insane and hold a mock coronation.

After a series of adventures, including a stint in prison, Edward interrupts the coronation as Tom is about to be crowned king. The nobles are shocked at their resemblance but refuse to believe that Edward is the rightful king wearing Tom&#x27;s clothes until he produces the Great Seal of England that he hid before leaving the palace. Edward and Tom switch back to their original places, and Edward is crowned King Edward VI of England. Miles is rewarded with the rank of Earl and the family right to sit in the king&#x27;s presence. In gratitude for supporting the new king&#x27;s claim to the throne, Edward names Tom the &quot;King&#x27;s Ward&quot;, a privileged position he holds for the rest of his life. The novel ends stating that Tom lived a long life, although it would have been unlikely for both of them to survive the reign of Mary I, while Edward died at the age of 15.

==Themes==
The introductory quote—&quot;The quality of mercy is . . . twice blest; / It blesseth him that gives and him that takes: / &#x27;Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes / The throned monarch better than his crown&quot;—is part of the &quot;quality of mercy&quot; speech from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. 

While written for children, &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; is both a critique of social inequality and a criticism of judging others by their appearance. Twain wrote of the book, &quot;My idea is to afford a realizing sense of the exceeding severity of the laws of that day by inflicting some of their penalties upon the King himself and allowing him a chance to see the rest of them applied to others...&quot;

==History==
Having returned from a second European tour—which formed the basis of &quot;A Tramp Abroad&quot; (1880)—Twain read extensively about English and French history. Initially intended as a play, the book was originally set in Victorian England before Twain decided to set it further back in time. He wrote &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; having already started &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;. 

The &quot;whipping-boy story&quot;, originally meant as a chapter to be part of &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;, was published in the Hartford &quot;Bazar Budget&quot; of July 4, 1880, before Twain deleted it from the novel at the suggestion of William Dean Howells.

Ultimately, &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; was published by subscription by James R. Osgood of Boston, with illustrations by Frank Thayer Merrill, John Harley and Ludvig Sandöe Ipsen.

The book bears a dedication to Twain&#x27;s daughters, Susie and Clara Clemens, and is subtitled &quot;A Tale For Young People of All Ages&quot;.
==Adaptations==

=== Theater ===

&quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; was adapted for the stage during Twain&#x27;s lifetime, an adaptation that involved Twain in litigation with the playwright. In November 1920, a stage adaption by Amélie Rives opened on Broadway under the direction of William Faversham, with Faversham as Miles Hendon and Ruth Findlay playing both Tom Canty and Prince Edward. 

A studio-cast musical adaptation with book/lyrics by Verna Tomasson and music by George Fischoff was recorded in 1963 on London Records (AM 98001/AMS 98001), with Joan Shepard as Tom Canty, Carol Blodgett as Prince Edward, John Davidson as Miles Hendon, Flora Elkins as Lady Anne, Joe Bousard as John Canty and Robert McHaffey. Another version of this musical was recorded on Pickwick Records (SPC-3204) with the misleading cover blurb stating that it was the &quot;Original Soundtrack from the New Movie&quot;.

An Off-Broadway musical with music by Neil Berg opened at Lamb&#x27;s Theatre on June 16, 2002. The original cast included Dennis Michael Hall as Prince Edward, Gerard Canonico as Tom Canty, Rob Evan as Miles Hendon, Stephen Zinnato as Hugh Hendon, Rita Harvey as Lady Edith, Michael McCormick as John Canty, Robert Anthony Jones as the Hermit/Dresser, Sally Wilfert as Mary Canty, Allison Fischer as Lady Jane and Aloysius Gigl as Father Andrew. The musical closed on August 31, 2003. 

English playwright Jemma Kennedy adapted the story into a musical drama, which was performed at the Unicorn Theatre in London between 2012 and 2013, directed by Selina Cartmell, and starred twins Danielle and Nichole Bird as the Prince and the Pauper and Jake Harders as Miles Hendon.

=== Comics ===

In 1946, the story was adapted into comics form by Arnold L. Hicks in &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; (&quot;Classic Comics&quot;) #29, published by Gilberton.

In 1962, Dell Comics published &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s The Prince and the Pauper&quot;, illustrated by Dan Spiegle, based on the three-part television adaptation produced by &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot;.

The British comic &quot;Nipper&quot; had a regular strip called &quot;Will and Bill&quot; that updated the concept to be about the young Prince William regularly swapping places with a working-class boy who looked identical to him.

In 1990, Disney Comics published &quot;Disney&#x27;s The Prince and the Pauper&quot;, by Scott Saavedra and Sergio Asteriti, based on the animated featurette starring Mickey Mouse.

=== Film ===
The novel has also been the basis of several films. In some versions, Prince Edward carries identification when he assumes Tom&#x27;s role. While animations such as the Mickey Mouse version retell the story, other cartoons employ parody (including an episode of the animated television show &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; in which Twain appears, begging cartoonists to &quot;let this tired story die&quot;). Film critic Roger Ebert suggested that the 1983 comedy film &quot;Trading Places&quot; (starring Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy) has similarities to Twain&#x27;s tale due to the two characters&#x27; switching lives (although not by choice).

A much-abridged 1920 silent version was produced (as one of his first films) by Alexander Korda in Austria entitled &quot;Der Prinz und der Bettelknabe&quot;. 

The 1937 version by Warner Bros. was its biggest hit for the year and starred Errol Flynn (as Hendon), Claude Raines, Alan Hale, and twins Billy and Bobby Mauch (as Tom Canty and Edward Tudor, respectively).

A 1977 film version of the story, starring Oliver Reed as Miles Hendon, Rex Harrison as the Duke of Norfolk, Mark Lester as Edward/Tom, Ernest Borgnine as John Canty, Charlton Heston as Henry VIII, and Raquel Welch and directed by Richard Fleischer, was released in the UK as &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; and in the US as &quot;Crossed Swords&quot;.

In 1990, Walt Disney Feature Animation released an animated featurette inspired by the novel and starring Mickey Mouse. In this version, Mickey &quot;plays&quot; both of the title roles, with a cast of other Disney characters.

&quot;It Takes Two&quot;, starring twins Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, is another loose adaptation of this story, in which two look-alike girls, one the wealthy daughter of a wireless service tycoon and the other an orphan, switch places in order to experience each other&#x27;s lives. Similarly, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Model Behavior&quot;, which originally aired on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;, stars Maggie Lawson as a teenage model and an ordinary high schooler who also decide to switch places.

A 2000 made-for-TV film directed by Giles Foster stars Aidan Quinn (as Miles Hendon), Alan Bates, Jonathan Hyde, and identical twins Jonathan and Robert Timmins. 

In 2004, &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; was adapted into an 85-minute animated musical, &quot;Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper&quot;, with Barbie playing the blonde Princess Anneliese and the brunette pauper Erika. In 2012, a second animated musical adaptation was released, titled &quot;&quot;. In it, Barbie plays a blonde princess named Victoria (Tori) and a brunette pop star named Keira. Both crave the life of another; one day, they meet and magically change places.

Garfield&#x27;s second live-action film, 2006&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, is another adaptation of the classic story, although its title references Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;.

A 2007 film, &quot;A Modern Twain Story: The Prince and the Pauper&quot;, stars identical twins Dylan and Cole Sprouse.

Another loose adaptation, &quot;Monte Carlo&quot;, was released in 2011 by 20th Century Fox and stars Selena Gomez.

A Telugu film version, &quot;Raju Peda&quot;, was released in 1954, starring N. T. Rama Rao and directed and produced, for Indian television, by B. A. Subba Rao and dubbed into Tamil as &quot;Aandi Petra Selvam&quot; in 1957. Later, a Hindi film version, &quot;Raja Aur Runk&quot;, was directed by Kotayya Pratyagatma and released in 1968. These films &quot;Indianized&quot; many of the episodes in the original story. A 1983 Kannada movie, &quot;Eradu Nakshatragalu&quot;, was also inspired by &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;. The 1996 Bollywood film &quot;Tere Mere Sapne&quot; is loosely based upon this story, in which two boys born on exactly the same date switch places to experience the other&#x27;s life while learning valuable lessons along the way. In 2020, another Telugu film version, &quot;Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo&quot;, was released, with the Hindi-language remake &quot;Shehzada&quot; released in 2023.

=== Television ===
A 1962 three-part &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; television adaptation features Guy Williams as Miles Hendon. Both Prince Edward and Tom Canty are played by Sean Scully, using the split-screen technique that Disney had used in &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1961) with Hayley Mills. 

The 21st episode of &quot;The Monkees&quot;, aired on February 6, 1967, is titled &quot;The Prince and the Paupers&quot;.

The &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; episode &quot;Swap Plot Flop&quot; has Valerie agreeing to pose as a kidnapped princess who looks just like her, only for the plan to backfire.

An episode of &quot;The Osmonds&quot; called &quot;Jimmy and James in London&quot; has Jimmy and Fuji switching places with their doppelgangers.

In a 1976 &quot;ABC Afterschool Special&quot;, Lance Kerwin plays the dual role in a modern American-based adaptation of the story titled &quot;P.J. and the President&#x27;s Son&quot;. 

The BBC produced a television adaptation by writer Richard Harris, consisting of six thirty-minute episodes, in 1976. Nicholas Lyndhurst plays both Prince Edward and Tom Canty.

&quot;Ringo&quot;, a 1978 TV special starring Ringo Starr, involves the former Beatles drummer trading places with a talentless look-alike.

The BBC TV comedy series &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; has an episode, &quot;Duel and Duality&quot;, in which the Prince Regent believes that the Duke of Wellington is after him. The prince swaps clothes with his butler Blackadder and says, &quot;This reminds of that story &#x27;The Prince and the Porpoise&#x27;.&quot; Blackadder corrects him: &quot;and the &quot;Pauper&quot;,&quot; to which the prince replies, &quot;Ah yes, the Prince and the Porpoise and the Pauper.&quot; Since &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; is set during the early 1800s, this is an anachronism.

In 1996, PBS aired a &quot;Wishbone&quot; adaptation titled &quot;The Prince and the Pooch&quot;, with Wishbone playing both Tom Canty and Edward VI.

The BBC produced a six-part dramatization of the story in 1996, adapted by Julian Fellowes, starring James Purefoy, with Keith Michell reprising his role of Henry VIII. This series was nominated for a British Academy Children&#x27;s Award.

A 2011 episode of &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; (&quot;Make Play&quot;, season 2, episode 64) follows a similar storyline, with Candace switching places with Princess Baldegunde of Drusselstein and discovering that royal life is dull.

&quot;Switched at Birth&quot; is an American teen and family drama television series that premiered on ABC Family on June 6, 2011.

Starting with the episode &quot;The Shepherd&quot; (which premiered on December 4, 2011), the TV series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; introduces a version of the story where a shepherd named David is the Pauper and Prince James is the Prince.

In 2017 Hallmark Channel released the movie &quot;Switched at Christmas&quot;, starring Candace Cameron Bure playing both twin sisters Kate Lockhart and Chris Dixon who swap after comparing their lifes.

The 2017 Japanese anime series &quot;Princess Principal&quot; uses a similar story as the background for the characters Ange and Princess Charlotte; their history is revealed by Ange under the guise of a fairy tale named &quot;The Princess and the Pickpocket&quot;. Ten years prior to the start of the series, Ange, who was actually the real Princess Charlotte, met Princess, who was actually a common pickpocket named Ange and looked identical to her. They befriended one another and eventually decided to trade places for a day. Soon after the switch, however, a Revolution broke out and divided their country, separating the girls and leaving them trapped in each other&#x27;s roles.

In &quot;The Princess Switch&quot; (a Netflix romantic Christmas film released in November 2018 starring Vanessa Hudgens), Margaret, the Duchess of Montenaro, changes places with baker Stacy, whom she accidentally meets. That plot results in 2 new love stories. This film is the first installment in the &quot;Princess Switch&quot; trilogy. It was followed by a sequel, &quot;The Princess Switch: Switched Again&quot;, which premiered on November 19, 2020, and the threequel, &quot;The Princess Switch 3: Romancing the Star&quot;, which premiered on November 18, 2021. The series is produced by Netflix and released exclusively through its streaming services as Netflix Original Films.

&quot;Sister Swap&quot; is a 2021 American series of TV films starring sisters Kimberly Williams-Paisley and Ashley Williams. The films were originally broadcast on Hallmark Channel, as part of the channel&#x27;s &quot;Countdown to Christmas&quot; seasonal programming.

=== Video games ===
In 1996, C&amp;E, a Taiwanese software company, released an RPG video game for Sega Genesis entitled 新乞丐王子/&quot;Xīn qǐgài wángzǐ&quot; (&quot;New Beggar Prince&quot;). Its story was inspired by the book, with the addition of fantastic elements such as magic, monsters, and other RPG themes. The game was ported to PC in 1998. It was eventually licensed in an English translation and released in 2006 as &quot;Beggar Prince&quot; by independent game publisher Super Fighter Team. This was one of the first new games for the discontinued Sega platform since 1998 and is perhaps the first video game adaptation of the book.

<doc id="200568" wikidata="Q189352" url="?curid=200568" title="Nineveh Governorate">
<text>Nineveh Governorate (; , ) is a governorate in northern Iraq. It has an area of and an estimated population of 2,453,000 people as of 2003. Its largest city and provincial capital is Mosul, which lies across the Tigris river from the ruins of ancient Nineveh. Before 1976, it was called &quot;Mosul Province&quot; and included the present-day Dohuk Governorate. The second largest city is Tal Afar, which has an almost exclusively Turkmen population.

An ethnically, religiously and culturally diverse region, it was partly conquered by ISIS in 2014. Iraqi government forces retook the city of Mosul in 2017.

== Recent history and administration ==
Its two cities endured the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and emerged unscathed. In 2004, however, Mosul and Tal Afar were the scenes of fierce battles between US-led troops and Iraqi insurgents. The insurgents moved to Nineveh after the Battle of Fallujah in 2004.

After the invasion, the military of the province was led by (then Major General) David Petraeus of the 101st Airborne Division and later by (then Brigadier General) Carter Ham as the multi-national brigade for Iraq. During the time, the American civil head of the local office of the Coalition Provisional Authority was US Foreign Service Officer and former Kurdish refugee to the States, Herro Mustafa. Mustafa administered her nominees on the provincial council and through members of the Kashmoula family.

In June 2004, Osama Kashmoula became the interim governor of the province and in September of the same year he was assassinated en route to Baghdad. He was succeeded as interim Governor by Duraid Kashmoula, who was elected governor in January 2005. Duraid Kashmoula resigned in 2009. In April 2009, Atheel al-Nujaifi, a hardline Arab nationalist and member of Al-Hadba, became governor. While al-Nujaifi&#x27;s Arab Muttahidoon bloc lost its majority to the Kurdish Brotherhood and Coexistence Alliance List in the 2013 provincial election, al-Nujaifi was reelected as governor by a larger Sunni Arab coalition that was later formalized as the Nahda Bloc.

In June 2014, insurgents from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (known as ISIS or ISIL) overran the capital Mosul, forcing an estimated 500,000 refugees to flee the area, including governor al-Nujaifi, who was subsequently deposed by the Iraqi Parliament.

While the Kurdish list proposed Hassan al-Allaf, an Arab affiliated with the Islamic Party, the provincial council elected Nofal Hammadi (formerly Loyalty to Nineveh List) with the votes of the Nahdha bloc.

An offensive to retake Mosul from ISIL control began in October 2016, with Iraqi and Kurdish soldiers supported by a U.S.-led coalition of 60 nations.

== Geography ==
=== Borders ===
The province borders the governorates of Dohuk, Kirkuk, Erbil, Saladin, and Anbar. It also shares a border with Syria, mostly Al-Hasakah Governorate, and Deir ez-Zor Governorate.

=== Districts ===
Nineveh Governorate comprises nine districts (excluding Aqrah), listed below with their areas and populations as estimated in 2018:


== Demographics ==
Nineveh Province is multiethnic. There are significant numbers of Arabs, Assyrians, Turkmens, Kurds and Yazidis who live in both in towns and cities, and in their own specific villages and regions. There are also many Armenians, Kawliya, Mandeans and Shabaks.

The majority are Sunni Muslim, with 80% of the Arabs and Turkmens being Sunni Muslim, as well Kurds also being Sunni Muslim. About 5–10% of the population is Shia Muslim. Generally, Yazidis, Shabaks and Mandeans are followers of their respective heritage religions, Yazidism, Shabakism, and Mandaeism.

The primary spoken language is Arabic. Minority languages include Turkmen, Neo-Aramaic dialects, Kurdish (predominantly Kurmanji) and Armenian.

=== Proposed Assyrian autonomous region ===

Many Assyrian leaders advocate an autonomous Assyrian homeland within the Nineveh Province (mostly in the Nineveh Plains region) for the Assyrian population.

<text>Riccardo Muti (; born 28 July 1941) is an Italian conductor. He is current music director of the Orchestra Giovanile Luigi Cherubini. Muti has previously held posts at the Maggio Musicale in Florence, the Philharmonia Orchestra in London, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, the Salzburg Whitsun Festival, and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He was named Music Director Emeritus in Chicago in 2023. 

A prolific recording artist, Muti has received numerous honours and awards, including two Grammy Awards. He is especially associated with the music of Giuseppe Verdi. Among the world&#x27;s leading conductors, in a 2015 &quot;Bachtrack&quot; poll he was ranked by music critics as the world&#x27;s fifth best living conductor.

==Childhood and education==

Muti was born in Naples but he spent his early childhood in Molfetta, near Bari, in the long region of Apulia on Italy&#x27;s southern Adriatic coast. His father, Domenico, was a pathologist in Molfetta, as well as an amateur singer and great music lover; his mother, Gilda, was a reserved and severe Neapolitan woman with five children.

Muti graduated from Liceo classico (Classical Lyceum) Vittorio Emanuele II in Naples, then studied piano at the Conservatory of San Pietro a Majella under Vincenzo Vitale; here Muti was awarded a diploma cum laude. He was subsequently awarded a diploma in Composition and Conducting by the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory, Milan, where he studied with the composer Bruno Bettinelli and the conductor Antonino Votto. He has also studied composition with Nino Rota, whom he considers a mentor. He was unanimously awarded first place by the jury of the &quot;Guido Cantelli Competition for Conductors&quot; in Milan in 1967 and became, the next year, principal conductor and music director of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, a post he held for eleven years.

==Career==
===Early career===
Since 1971 he has been a frequent conductor of operas and concerts at the Salzburg Festival, where he is particularly known for his Mozart opera performances. From 1972 Muti regularly conducted the Philharmonia Orchestra in London and in 1973 he was appointed its principal conductor, succeeding Otto Klemperer.

In 1979, Muti became the music director and principal conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra. In 1986, he became principal conductor of the Filarmonica della Scala, Milan, with which in 1988 he received the Viotti d&#x27;Oro and toured Europe. In 1989 he conducted a live performance of Mozart&#x27;s Don Giovanni that was recorded on a DVD. In 1991, after twelve years as music director, he announced his resignation from the Philadelphia Orchestra, effective at the end of the 1991–1992 season.

In 1995 he was the president of the jury of the International Composing Competition &quot;2 Agosto&quot;.

===Berlin and Vienna===
Muti has been a regular guest of the Berlin Philharmonic and the Vienna Philharmonic. In 1996, he conducted the Vienna Philharmonic during Vienna Festival Week and on tour to Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and Germany; he most recently toured with the Vienna Philharmonic to Japan in 2008. Muti has also led the orchestra&#x27;s Vienna New Year&#x27;s Concert on seven occasions to date: in 1993, 1997, 2000, 2004, 2018, 2021 and 2025.

===Work in opera===
Apart from his work at Milan&#x27;s Teatro alla Scala, where he was music director for 19 years, Muti has led operatic performances with the Philadelphia Orchestra and productions in the principal opera houses of Rome (from 1969), Ravenna, Vienna, London (from 1977), Munich (from 1979), and, finally, in 2010, New York. His work with the Vienna State Opera has included &quot;Aida&quot; in 1973, &quot;La forza del destino&quot; in 1974, &quot;Norma&quot; in 1977, &quot;Rigoletto&quot; in 1983, &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; in 1996 and 2008, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; in 1999, and &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; in 2001.

===Appearances in Salzburg===
Muti first conducted at the Salzburg Festival in 1971 with Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; (staged by Ladislav Stros). Muti has subsequently appeared regularly at the Salzburg Festival, conducting both numerous concerts with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and opera productions, such as &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (staged by Michael Hampe) from 1982 to 1985 and from 1990 to 1991, &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; (staged by Peter Brenner) in 1988 and 1989, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (staged by Michael Hampe) in 1990 and 1991, &quot;La traviata&quot; (staged by Lluis Pasqual, and designed by Luciano Damiani) in 1995, &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; in 2005 (staged by Graham Vick) and 2006 (staged by Pierre Audi, stage designed by Karel Appel), &quot;Otello&quot; (staged by Stephen Langridge) in 2008, &quot;Moise et Pharaon&quot; (staged by Jürgen Flimm) in 2009, and &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; (staged by Dieter Dorn) in 2010. In 2011, Muti conducted a new production of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, which was directed by Peter Stein. For the 2017 Salzburg Festival, he conducted Aida, directed by Shirin Neshat. Muti also owns a residence close to Salzburg.

From 2007 to 2011, Muti was the artistic director of the Salzburg Whitsun Festival. He conducted productions of rare Italian operas from the 18th century Neapolitan School as well as concerts, with the Luigi Cherubini Youth Orchestra, which he had founded.

===Riccardo Muti Italian Opera Academy===
In July 2015, Riccardo Muti&#x27;s desire to devote even more to the training of young musicians was realised: the first edition of the Riccardo Muti Italian Opera Academy for young conductors, répétiteurs and singers took place with great acclaim at Teatro Alighieri in Ravenna and talented young musicians, as well as an audience of music-lovers from around the world participated. The academy has as its purpose to pass on to young musicians Riccardo Muti&#x27;s experience and lessons and to make the audience understand in its full complexity the path to accomplish an opera production.

===In the United States===

====Philadelphia and New York====
In the United States, from 1980 to 1992 Muti was music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra, which he led on numerous international tours. In 1979, he was appointed its music director and, in 1992, conductor laureate. Muti stated that his approach was to remain faithful to the intent of the composer. This meant a change from applying the lush &quot;Philadelphia Sound,&quot; created by his predecessors Eugene Ormandy and Leopold Stokowski, to all repertoire; however, many of his recordings with that orchestra largely seem to do away with its hallmark sound, even in the works of such composers as Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and other high romantics. His sonic changes to the orchestra remain controversial. Some felt he turned it into a generic-sounding institution with a lean sound much favoured by modern recording engineers. Others believe Muti uncovered the true intention of the works, which had been covered in a silky sheen by Muti&#x27;s predecessor. Since his departure from Philadelphia, he has made very few guest conducting appearances with the Philadelphia Orchestra, most recently in 2005.

Muti had been a regular and popular guest conductor with the New York Philharmonic. The orchestra&#x27;s musicians had reportedly been interested – towards the end of the tenures of Kurt Masur and Lorin Maazel, and before Muti took the Chicago post – in having the conductor as their music director, but Muti stated that he had no wish to take on the position.

====Chicago====
Muti had first guest-conducted the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO) in 1973 at the Ravinia Festival but did not return as a guest conductor with the CSO until 2007. Deborah Rutter, then president of the CSO saw him in Paris and persuaded him to come guest conduct and tour; he explained later, he thought he was too tired to start a &quot;new adventure&quot;, but &quot;immediately it was something that happened between me and the orchestra.&quot;

In May 2008, the CSO named Muti its next music director, effective with the 2010–2011 season, with an initial contract of five years. His most recent contract extension, announced in January 2018, is through the 2021–2022 season. In January 2020, the CSO confirmed that Muti is to conclude his music directorship of the orchestra at the close of the 2021–2022 season. In September 2021, the CSO announced a revision to Muti&#x27;s contract as its music director, with an extension of the scheduled closing date of his tenure to the end of the 2022–2023 season. Muti announced that he will step down as music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the end of the 2022–2023 season. According to classical music critic Zachery Wolffe, his directorship in Chicago was an &quot;enormous success&quot; with &quot;pristine yet intense, powerful yet graceful&quot; performances of operas in concert, canonical orchestral pieces, new premiers, and &quot;rarities of the past&quot;. In June 2023, it was announced that beginning in the 2024–2025 season Muti would be named Music Director Emeritus for life, and continue occasional performances.

===End of tenure in Milan===
In 2003, there were reports of artistic and programming conflicts at La Scala between musical director and principal conductor Muti and general manager Carlo Fontana. Muti did not attend the press conference that announced the 2003–04 season. The appointment in 2003 of Mauro Meli as La Scala&#x27;s artistic director was intended to calm the conflict between Fontana and Muti.

On 24 February 2005, La Scala governors dismissed Fontana as general manager and named Meli as his successor. The musicians sided with Fontana against Muti at this point in the dispute, and on 13 March, Muti stated that he would refuse to conduct the La Scala orchestra from that point on. On 16 March 2005, the orchestra and staff of La Scala voted overwhelmingly against Muti in a motion of no-confidence. Muti was forced to cancel a concert prior to the vote, and some other productions were disrupted at the theatre because of continuing rifts with Fontana&#x27;s supporters. On 2 April, he resigned from La Scala, citing &quot;hostility&quot; from staff members.

In August 2009, Muti was said to be named the next music director of the Teatro dell&#x27;Opera di Roma, effective December 2010, but the news given by the mayor (and therefore president of Opera di Roma) Gianni Alemanno was not true. Alemanno, instead, announced in October 2011 that Muti accepted an invitation by the Orchestra of Opera di Roma to become a &quot;lifetime conductor&quot; of Opera di Roma.

===Political intervention===
On the night of 12 March 2011, Rome&#x27;s Teatro dell&#x27;Opera staged the first in a series of scheduled performances of Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Nabucco&quot;, conducted by Muti. After the end of the chorus &quot;Va, pensiero&quot;, which contains the lyrics &quot;Oh mia patria, sì bella e perduta&quot; (&quot;Oh my country, so beautiful and so lost&quot;), the audience applauded &quot;heartily.&quot; Muti, breaking with opera protocol and the strict conventions of composer Verdi himself, turned to the audience and delivered a small speech, referring to the severe budget cuts announced by the Berlusconi government which would particularly affect the funding of the arts. He spoke of the need to keep culture alive in Italy, prompted, as he later stated, by the belief that &quot;killing culture in a country like Italy is a crime against society. Culture is the spiritual glue that holds a people together.&quot; He then invited the audience to participate in an encore of the &quot;Va, pensiero&quot; chorus – the invitation and the encore also a break from tradition for an opera performance. The opera audience stood up and sang along with the on-stage chorus. Muti recalls that &quot;80 percent of the audience knew the lyrics&quot; and sang along, while &quot;some members of the chorus were in tears.&quot;

On 18 March, the performance of &quot;Nabucco&quot; was repeated in front of the former Italian president Giorgio Napolitano and former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Muti, who had stated that it had been the first time in his life that he conducted chorus and audience together and also the last, on that occasion conducted the Verdi opera in the &quot;orthodox&quot; manner.

==Personal life==
Muti is married to Maria Cristina Mazzavillani, the founder and director of the Ravenna Festival. They have two sons, Domenico and Francesco, and a daughter, Chiara, who is married to the pianist David Fray.

In 2010, Muti wrote an autobiography. The following year, it was translated and published in English as &quot;Riccardo Muti: An Autobiography: First the Music, Then the Words&quot;. Music critic John von Rhein of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described Muti&#x27;s memoir as &quot;fascinating.&quot;

==Repertoire and recordings==
With the Philadelphia Orchestra, his recordings include a Beethoven symphony cycle, the symphonies of Brahms and Scriabin, selected works of Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev, as well as less-known works of composers such as Puccini and Busoni.

Muti is considered one of the world&#x27;s greatest conductors of the operas of Verdi. He also led a series of annual performances of opera in concerts including the works of Verdi, Puccini, Mozart and Wagner. In 1992, Muti conducted performances of Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot; with Luciano Pavarotti. A recording was also made of these performances.

At La Scala, Muti was noted for exploring lesser-known works of the Classical- and early Romantic-era repertory such as &quot;Lodoiska&quot; by Cherubini and &quot;La vestale&quot; by Spontini.

<text>Kajagoogoo were an English pop band. They are best known for their 1983 hit single &quot;Too Shy&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart, and the top 10 in numerous other countries.

==History==
===Beginnings (1978–1982)===
Formed in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, in 1978, the band were originally known as Art Nouveau, a four-piece avant-garde group, with Nick Beggs on bass guitar, Steve Askew on lead guitar, Stuart Croxford Neale on keyboards, and Jez Strode on drums. In 1981 Art Nouveau recorded and self-released a single, &quot;Fear Machine/Animal Instincts&quot;, which sold a few hundred copies and allegedly got airtime on John Peel&#x27;s show. The B-side of Art Nouveau&#x27;s single was re-recorded for the B-side of the &quot;Ooh to Be Ah&quot; 7-inch single. In spite of the single and continuous local live performances, the band failed to secure a record deal during this period.

In 1982, Art Nouveau advertised for a new lead singer. They ultimately auditioned and chose Christopher Hamill, who then went under the stage name Limahl (an anagram of his surname). The group renamed themselves Kajagoogoo, a name coined phonetically from the first sounds that many infants make.

===Success and decline (1982–1985)===
Kajagoogoo signed with EMI Records in July 1982 after Limahl had met keyboardist Nick Rhodes of the group Duran Duran while working as a waiter at London&#x27;s Embassy Club. Rhodes co-produced the band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Too Shy&quot; with Duran Duran&#x27;s EMI producer Colin Thurston. The single was released on 10 January 1983 and topped the UK Singles Chart. 

Follow-up singles &quot;Ooh to Be Aah&quot; and &quot;Hang on Now&quot; also both reached the UK Top 20, and the group&#x27;s debut album &quot;White Feathers&quot; reached No. 5 in the UK Albums Chart. After being the support act for the Birmingham band Fashion in late 1982, Kajagoogoo embarked on their own headlining &quot;White Feathers&quot; tour in Spring 1983. Their performance on 31 May at the London Hammersmith Odeon was filmed and released on home video.

As success came, tensions began to rise in the band, and they culminated in Limahl being fired by the other band members in mid-1983, with Nick Beggs then taking over as lead singer. In response, Limahl accused the others of being envious of him and said &quot;I&#x27;ve been betrayed!&quot; and &quot;I was sacked for making them a success.&quot; The other band members countered Limahl&#x27;s assertions, insisting that he had become egomaniacal and increasingly difficult to work with. Soon after the departure, Beggs commented, &quot;It was a business decision and not one we took lightly. He wanted the band to go in a different direction to the rest of us. Eventually, we realised we were on a different planet to Limahl.&quot; Beggs also stated that the band harboured no ill will towards Limahl, and blamed the press for sensationalising the matter. Guitarist Steve Askew commented &quot;At first ... we did everything possible to make Limahl feel like part of the furniture but, you know, his lifestyle is so different from ours. We&#x27;re very normal people whereas Limahl likes the bright lights.&quot;

The first single by the new four-piece lineup, &quot;Big Apple&quot;, was released in September 1983 and reached the UK Top Ten. Their next single, &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Mouth&quot;, was released in February 1984 and made the UK Top 30. After this, public interest in the group waned, and their next single &quot;Turn Your Back on Me&quot; failed to make the Top 40. The subsequent new album, &quot;Islands&quot;, was a commercial disappointment, peaking at No. 35 in the UK.

In the US, the band first adopted the Kaja moniker at this time, and a different edition of the &quot;Islands&quot; album was released as &quot;Extra Play&quot;, peaking at No. 185 on the Billboard charts. However, the single &quot;Turn Your Back on Me&quot; did well on the US Dance Charts, peaking at No. 2 for two weeks. Meanwhile, Limahl went on to equally brief success as a solo artist and Strode left the band.

In an attempt to regain credibility and lose their light-hearted image, the remaining three members relaunched as Kaja in the UK in 1985. Following the name change, the band released the single &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t Do That&quot; (UK No. 63) in August 1985. The song was featured on their third album, &quot;Crazy People&#x27;s Right to Speak&quot;. After this proved unsuccessful, the group disbanded in December 1985.

===Reunions (2003–2011)===
The original five-piece line-up of the band briefly joined forces again on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Bands Reunited&quot; in 2003.

Following the much publicised VH1 reunion, the original group received many offers and incentives to continue to play together, but disagreements continued between the band members and the reunion was short-lived, as Limahl and Strode both departed the band again shortly thereafter, ultimately leading them to dissolve the following year. The group felt that the VH1 feature was unfairly edited to portray simplified reasons as to why Limahl was fired and Strode had left the band in the 1980s.

In 2007, Nick Beggs, Steve Askew, and Stuart Neale decided to continue as Kajagoogoo, releasing the single &quot;Rocket Boy&quot; on 24 June 2007. The single received airplay on Steve Wright&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 show in the UK, and a new album, &quot;Gone to the Moon&quot;, was scheduled for release on the Spectra Records label later on that year. However, the album was postponed, and in February 2008, the three Kajagoogoo members announced plans to reunite with original members singer Limahl and drummer Jez Strode. This was due in part to Bradley Snelling, the organiser of the Retrofest event and the band&#x27;s new manager. Snelling had succeeded in reuniting the band, arranging their first photo shoot together in 25 years.

The band wrote on their official site that the &quot;atmosphere was relaxed, jovial and, after 25 years, Kajagoogoo, in their original five-piece line-up are back&quot;. After reforming, the band wrote new material, released an EP, and toured extensively throughout Europe, performing first in Denmark on 14 June 2008 at the Esbjerg Rock Festival, where they performed the 16 tracks off the remastered edition of &quot;Islands&quot;, including encores and B-sides, such as &quot;Monochromatic&quot; or &quot;The Garden&quot;). Their &quot;Gone to the Moon&quot; album, recorded as a three-piece outfit prior to the full reunion, was distributed via the live shows and &quot;Kajashop&quot;, the band&#x27;s online store.

In August 2009, while in the middle of a tour, Kajagoogoo again took to the stage to headline the Hobble on the Cobbles music event in Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. This was followed in September by a compilation CD/DVD, released by the band&#x27;s original label EMI Records, titled &quot;Too Shy – The Best of Kajagoogoo &amp; Limahl&quot;. It featured two newly recorded tracks and a promotional video for &quot;Space Cadet&quot;, one of the new recordings. Quick to capitalise on the renewed interest in the band, EMI released the &quot;White Feathers (Manhattan Clique Remixes) EP&quot; in December 2009.

In December 2009, Kajagoogoo performed their last remaining UK concert with a return to The Stables venue in Wavendon, Milton Keynes. In March 2010, dPulse Recordings released the Kajagoogoo track &quot;First Girl on Mars&quot; as a part of the &quot;Who Made Your Music?&quot; benefit CD, released to raise funds and bring awareness to the rights of marginalised women. On Saturday 17 July 2010, Kajagoogoo performed at the Midlands Music Festival in Tamworth and later performed at the Rewind Festival in Henley-on-Thames in August. Continuing to capitalise on renewed interest in the Kajagoogoo back catalogue, EMI Records released &quot;So80s Presents Kajagoogoo&quot; as a part of the &quot;So Eighties&quot; series curated by Blank &amp; Jones. The album contains extended mixes of classic Kajagoogoo tracks and was released on CD and digital download format. Also made available digitally in April 2011, Kajagoogoo&#x27;s &quot;Gone to the Moon&quot; album was given a digital release via iTunes.

In June 2011, Kajagoogoo released their first single as a five piece since 1983. The track &quot;Death Defying Headlines&quot; was released as a digital single as both a single edit and an extended dance remix.

In March 2017, bassist Nick Beggs said that Kajagoogoo was no longer active, stating &quot;We did something about nine years ago, and that was good. It was almost like a kind of revisiting of it for old time’s sake and I felt that we did quite a lot of good with that. But in terms of moving forward, there’s no point in revisiting that project.&quot;

In an interview with Cherry Red TV in 2018, Beggs talked about the reunion, stating &quot;we reformed and we toured and we recorded an EP and remastered the back catalogue...and at that point I felt that we had done it all. It was a nice way to tie it up, put a bow on it and leave it alone and move on.&quot;

<doc id="200581" wikidata="Q174506" url="?curid=200581" title="Atabeg">
<text>Atabeg, Atabek, or Atabey is a hereditary title of nobility of Turkic origin, indicating a governor of a nation or province who was subordinate to a monarch and charged with raising the crown prince. The first instance of the title&#x27;s use was with early Seljuk Turks who bestowed it on the Persian vizier Nizam al-Mulk. It was later used in the Kingdom of Georgia, first within the Armeno-Georgian family of Mkhargrdzeli as a military title and then within the house of Jaqeli as princes of Samtskhe.

==Title origins and meanings==
The word &quot;atabeg&quot; is a compound of the Turkic word &quot;ata&quot;, &quot;ancestor&quot;, or &quot;father&quot; and the word &quot;beg&quot; or &quot;bey&quot;, &quot;lord, leader, prince&quot;. &quot;Beg&quot; is stated in some sources as being of Iranian origin (as in the compound Baghdad from &quot;bag/beg&quot; and &quot;dad&quot;, &quot;lord&quot; given). However, according to Gerhard Doerfer, the word &quot;beg&quot; may have possibly been of Turkic origin – the origin of the word still remains disputed to this day.

The title &quot;Atabeg&quot; was common during the Seljuk rule of the Near East starting in the 12th century. It was also common in Mesopotamia (Iraq). When a Seljuk prince died, leaving minor heirs, a guardian would be appointed to protect and guide the young princes. These guardians would often marry their wards&#x27; widowed mothers, thus assuming a role similar to a surrogate father&#x27;s. Amongst the Turkmen tribes, as in Persia, the rank was senior to a khan.

The title &quot;Atabeg&quot; was also in use for officers in Mamluk Egypt; some of them were proclaimed sultan before the incorporation into the Ottoman Empire. After the end of Seljuk rule, the title was used only intermittently.

When describing the Atabegs of Azerbaijan, the Ildeniz (Ildegoz) dynasty, the title &quot;Atabeg-e-Azam&quot; (Great Atabeg) was used, to denote their superior standing, power and influence on the Seljuk sultans.

In Persian, the style &quot;Atabek-e-Azam&quot; was occasionally used as an alternative title for the Shah&#x27;s Vazir-e-Azam (&quot;Grand Vizier&quot;), notably in 1834–35 for Mirza Abolghasem Farahani, Gha&#x27;em Magham, in 1848–51 for Mirza Mohammed Taghi Khan, Amir-e Kabir, in 1906–07 for Mirza Ali Asghar Khan, Amin-ol Soltan, and finally in 1916 for a Qajar prince, Major-General Shahzadeh Sultan &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l Majid Mirza, Eyn-ol Douleh.

==List of Atabeg dynasties and other dynasties who used the title==
*Ahmadilis (Atabegs of Maragha) (of Turkic origin)
*Eldiguzids (Atabegs of Azerbaijan) (of Kypchaq Turkic origin)
*Salghurids (Atabegs of Fars) (of Turkmen origin)
*Hazaraspids (Atabegs of Luristan) (of Iranian origin)
*Atabegs of Yazd (of Iranian origin)
*Zengids (Atabegs of Mosul) (of Turkmen origin)

==Atabeg dynasties==

===In the Near East===
Beginning in the twelfth century the atabegs formed a number of dynasties, and displaced the descendants of the Seljukid emirs in their various principalities. These dynasties were founded by emancipated Mamluks, who had held high office at court and in camp under powerful emirs. When the emirs died, they first became stadtholders for the emirs&#x27; descendants, and then usurped the throne of their masters. There was an atabeg dynasty in Damascus founded by Toghtekin (1103–1128).

Other atabeg &quot;kingdoms&quot; sprang up to the north east, founded by Sokman (Sökmen), who established himself at Kaifa in Diyarbakır about 1101, and by his brother Ilghazi. The city of Mosul was under Mawdud ibn Altuntash, and was later ruled by atabegs such as Aksunkur and Zengi. Zengi became Atabeg of Mosul in 1128 and soon established himself as an independent ruler of much of northern Mesopotamia and Syria (including Aleppo).

The northern part of Luristan, formerly known as Lurikuchik (&#x27;Little Luristan&#x27;), was governed by independent princes of the Khurshidi dynasty, styled atabegs, from the beginning of the 17th century when the last atabeg, Shah Verdi Khan, was removed by Persian Shah Abbas I and the government of the province given to Husain Khan, the chief of a rival tribe. Husain, however, was given the gubernatorial title of vali instead of atabeg. The descendants of Husain Khan retained the title.

Great Luristan, in the southern part of Luristan, was an independent state under the Fazlevieh atabegs from 1160 until 1424. Its capital was Idaj, now only represented by mounds and ruins at Malamir.

===In the Caucasus===
In the Kingdom of Georgia, atabeg () was one of the highest court titles created by Queen Tamar of Georgia in 1212 for her powerful subjects of the Mkhargrdzeli family. The atabeg of Georgia was a vizier and a Lord High Tutor to Heir Apparent. Not infrequently, the office of atabeg was combined with that of amirspasalar (commander-in-chief). In 1334, the title became hereditary in the Jaqeli family who ruled the Principality of Samtskhe. Therefore, this entity came to be denominated as Samtskhe-Saatabago, the latter element meaning &quot;of the atabags&quot;.

<text>Western Carolina University (WCU) is a public university in Cullowhee, North Carolina. It is part of the University of North Carolina system.

The fifth oldest institution of the sixteen four-year universities in the UNC system, WCU was founded to educate the people of the western North Carolina mountains. WCU provides an education to students from 48 states and 35 countries. Enrollment for the fall 2020 semester was 12,243 students.

==History==

In 1888, the residents of Cullowhee desired a better school for the community than was offered in public schools of that day, organized a board of trustees
and established a community school that came to be known as Cullowhee Academy. Founded in August 1889 as a semi-public secondary school and chartered as Cullowhee High School in 1891 (also called Cullowhee Academy), it served the Cullowhee community and boarding students from neighboring counties and other states. The founder, Robert Lee Madison, wanted to provide an education for the young people in the region and train teachers to spread education throughout the western part of the state. In 1893, through the efforts of Walter E. Moore,
representative from Jackson County, the North Carolina Legislature authorized an appropriation for the establishment of a normal department at the school &quot;for the purpose of training teachers&quot;. This designation became the first publicly funded normal school in North Carolina.

In 1905, the state assumed title to the school&#x27;s buildings and property and made it a state institution. That same year, the school&#x27;s name was changed to Cullowhee Normal &amp; Industrial School. In 1925, the school&#x27;s name was changed to Cullowhee State Normal School. During its years as Cullowhee Normal, the stated purpose of the school was to train teachers for the North Carolina public schools. A coeducational institution, Cullowhee Normal trained over two thousand teachers by the mid-1920s.

Over the next forty years, the school expanded its curriculum and evolved into a junior college, and in 1929 it was chartered by the Legislature as a four-year institution under the name Western Carolina Teachers College. Called &quot;the Cullowhee experiment&quot;, Madison&#x27;s idea became a model for the other regional colleges in the state.

The demand for both liberal arts and other programs led to an expansion of the school&#x27;s offerings. Postgraduate studies and the Master of Arts in Education degree were added to the curriculum in 1951. In 1953, the name Western Carolina College was adopted.

In 1967, the institution was designated a regional university by the North Carolina General Assembly and given its current name, Western Carolina University. On July 1, 1972, WCU became a member of the University of North Carolina system.

One of the residence halls, Shining Rock, has been the target of several arson attacks starting November 2023 and stopping February 2024. In December 2024, the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation entered into a joint investigation with the campus police to find the perpetrator, but the investigation stalled after exhausted leads. In late November, the university started to offer a $1,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the individual. As of April 2024, the perpetrator has not been caught.

==Campuses==
Western Carolina University is located in Jackson County, in the unincorporated village of Cullowhee, North Carolina. The university operates learning centers in both Asheville and Cherokee with programs offered online and at various community colleges. The main campus is located in a valley of the Tuckasegee River, between the Blue Ridge and Great Smoky Mountains, west of Asheville, North Carolina and 5 miles south of Sylva, NC. The university lies close to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the Blue Ridge Parkway, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Reservation (officially known as the Qualla Boundary), and some of the nation&#x27;s most beautiful national forest lands. At an elevation of , but located in a thermal valley, the campus enjoys the best of all four seasons but is shielded from most extreme temperatures by surrounding peaks. Cullowhee typically enjoys a rather mild winter season. In fact, Cullowhee can go some winters with little to no snowfall.

While winters in the valley are generally mild, snow is not unusual in the higher elevations of Jackson County around Cashiers or Balsam. In nearby Sapphire Valley, snowmaking machines maintain prime snow skiing conditions from mid-December through February. Locations in Jackson County are also within reasonable driving distance to ski slopes at Maggie Valley. The Blue Ridge Parkway is usually closed during winter weather, and has become popular with cross-country skiers during those times.

The many rivers, streams and forests surrounding Cullowhee, combined with the mild climate of Southern Appalachia, offer many opportunities for outdoor activities. Climbing, hiking, biking, rafting, kayaking, and camping are a few of the outdoor activities nearby. Cities within a three-hour drive of campus include Atlanta, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; Knoxville, Tennessee; and Greenville, South Carolina.

===Main campus in Cullowhee===

The main campus in Cullowhee offers most of the amenities of a small town, including twelve residence halls, two full-service cafeterias, a food court with fast-food outlets, health services, counseling, a bookstore, library, a swimming pool, tennis and basketball courts, movie theater, jogging trail and quarter-mile track, hiking and biking trails and intramural fields.

The campus center is the A.K. Hinds University Center. The UC contains the university post office, a movie theater, video and commuter lounges, student organization HQs including the Student Government Association and Last Minute Productions, meeting rooms and office spaces. Outside of the UC is the &quot;Alumni Tower&quot;, built in 1989, on the 100th birthday of the university.

A $13.5 million Student Recreation Center, was completed over the summer of 2008. Harrill Residence Hall was renovated to add 6,000 square feet (557 m2) and bring the 1971 building to LEED standards of environmental friendliness and energy efficiency, and re-opened in fall 2012.

The new $46.2 million Health and Human Sciences Building opened for use at the start of the 2012–13 academic year, also built to LEED standards. This facility is the first project on the Millennial Initiative property and houses WCU&#x27;s educational and outreach programs in the College of Health and Human Sciences. The four-story facility is home to the undergraduate and graduate programs in social work and communication sciences and disorders; graduate programs in physical therapy and health sciences; and undergraduate programs in athletic training, emergency medical care, environmental health, nutrition and dietetics, nursing and recreational therapy.

===Asheville campus===
WCU&#x27;s educational facilities in Asheville focus on professional and graduate degrees for working students.

===Cherokee campus===
The Western Carolina University Cherokee Center in Cherokee, North Carolina, was established in 1975 in cooperation with the tribal government of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians. The center serves Cherokee and the surrounding communities and is available to all of the people of the region. Their services include the application process, transcript request, scholarships, internships placement, high school recruitment.

==Organization and administration==

The university is led by Chancellor Kelli R. Brown, the chief administrative officer, along with Interim Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Richard Starnes and several advisory groups. The institution operates under the guidance and policies of the Board of Trustees of Western Carolina University. WCU also falls under the administration of University of North Carolina system president Thomas W. Ross. The university moved to a provost and senior vice chancellor model in 2004.

===Academic programs===
With its main campus located on the site of an ancient Cherokee Indian village and adjacent to the Great Smoky and Blue Ridge Mountains, Western Carolina has a commitment to the rich traditions of both the Appalachian and Cherokee cultures. The university&#x27;s Mountain Heritage Center; Cherokee Center; Craft Revival Project; Cherokee Studies Program and WCU&#x27;s partnership to preserve the Cherokee language all reflect that influence – and provide educational resources for the region.

Western is classified among &quot;M1: Master&#x27;s Colleges and Universities – Larger programs&quot; and in the elective &quot;community engagement&quot; category. WCU is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award degrees at the bachelor, masters, intermediate, and doctoral levels. The university holds 21 program accreditations and is a member of more than 30 state and national associations and organizations to which its professional programs are related. In 2009, the Corporation for National and Community Service recognized WCU by awarding the President&#x27;s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll with Distinction for &quot;exemplary commitment to service and civic engagement&quot; on WCU&#x27;s campus and beyond.

As the sixth-largest producer of teachers in North Carolina, the College of Education and Allied Professions was the national winner of the Association of Teacher Educators&#x27; Distinguished Program in Teacher Education Award in 2006. The college is also the 2007 co-winner of the Christa McAuliffe Excellence in Teacher Education Award presented by the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. The Christa McAuliffe Award nationally recognizes outstanding programs in teacher education at AASCU member institutions.

Western Carolina&#x27;s Forensic Research Facility (commonly referred to as the &quot;FoREST&quot;) is just the second facility of its kind nationally. The decomposition research station is an extremely valuable resource for researchers and forensic anthropology students to study natural decomposition.

Western Carolina University&#x27;s Brinson Honors College provides an academic community in which high-achieving students challenge themselves to meet and exceed their own academic goals. WCU&#x27;s Honors College was the first residential honors college in the University of North Carolina System, beginning in 1997 with only 77 students in Reynolds Hall. It now has more than 1,300 students and residential space in Balsam and Blue Ridge residence halls. The Honors College was later renamed to the Brinson Honors College in September 2020 to honor Jack and Judy Brinson. The Brinson Honors College is one of a few in the state to offer a residential option and among a few nationwide to award graduates with a special honors diploma. Entering freshman, must meet one of the following criteria to be considered for consideration into the Brinson Honors College: weighted GPA of 4.2 minimum, unweighted GPA of 3.8 minimum, class rank of 10%, ACT score of 30 minimum, or SAT score of 1370. To graduate from the Brinson Honors College, students must have a cumulative WCU GPA of at least 3.5 and they must have completed 27 credit hours with honors designation or 24 credit hours with honors designation and completion of DegreePlus Level 3. Students who graduate from the Brinson Honors College receive the specially designed Brinson Honors College diploma, the Honors medallion, and walk at the head of their class. The college is a member of the National Collegiate Honors Council. In August 2009, Balsam Hall, the first part of a $50.2 million Honors College residential community located at the center of campus opened, housing 426 students. In Fall 2010, Blue Ridge Hall completed the community and add an additional 400 beds for Honors College students and Teaching Fellows.

In the spring of 2000, WCU was officially designated a National Merit sponsoring university, just the fourth institution of higher education in North Carolina, public or private, to receive that distinction The university grants scholarships to students who qualify as National Merit Finalists. The Western Meritorious Award for Finalists provides a four-year scholarship, which covers the equivalent amount of in-state tuition, fees, room, and board, to National Merit Finalists, who also receive a computer.

The 2012 edition of the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; guide to &quot;America&#x27;s Best Colleges&quot; ranks Western Carolina University 14th among public universities in the South that offer master&#x27;s degrees.

In 2015, the North Carolina General Assembly approved the NC Promise Tuition Plan, a tuition reduction plan to make three universities - WCU, Elizabeth City State University, and University of North Carolina at Pembroke - more affordable and accessible. The NC Promise began in the fall semester of 2018 and drastically reduces the tuition cost for students. In-state students pay $500 a semester and out-of-state students pay $2,500 a semester. Attendance has increased for three consecutive years with the total attendance as of Fall 2020 at 12,243 students, being the ninth time in the past ten years record enrollment has been recorded.

==Student life==

===Residential life===
The main campus at Cullowhee has residential facilities for students. These include seventeen residence halls, two full-service cafeterias, and one food court with fast-food outlets.

====Pride of the Mountains====
The Pride of the Mountains is the largest college marching band in the Carolinas and Tennessee. As of Fall 2014, the marching band includes just over 500 members, making it one of the largest marching bands in the United States. The band is open to all Western Carolina students regardless of class or major, with approximately 60% of its members non-music majors.

In 2014, the band performed in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade with 510 band members participating. Announcers described their performance as &quot;This is the largest band this parade has seen in decades&quot;, &quot;This is the best of the best&quot;, and &quot;They don&#x27;t mess around at Western Carolina&quot;.

The Pride of the Mountains also performed at a Carolina Panthers halftime show in 2011. The band was also the special guest at the Bands of America Grand National Championships in Indianapolis in 1998, 2003, 2008 and 2012, an honor given to only one college band in the United States each year. In addition, the band was also a special guest at the Bands of America Regional&#x27;s held in Atlanta in 1995, 2006, 2010, and 2011. In 2009, the Pride of the Mountains was selected as one of the five best collegiate marching bands in the nation by the College Band Directors National Association and featured in the book &quot;Marching Bands and Drumlines: Secrets of Success from the Best of the Best&quot; by Paul Buyer.

The band is the 2009 recipient of the Sudler Trophy awarded by the John Philip Sousa Foundation. They participated in the 2011 Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California, and won the most votes in a &quot;best band&quot; in the parade poll hosted by KTLA-TV.

<doc id="200585" wikidata="Q2668090" url="?curid=200585" title="Zitkala-Sa">
<text>Zitkala-Ša, also Zitkála-Šá (Lakota: , meaning [[Northern cardinal|Red Bird]]; February 22, 1876 – January 26, 1938), was a Yankton Dakota writer, editor, translator, musician, educator, and political activist. She was also known by her Anglicized and married name, Gertrude Simmons Bonnin. She wrote several works chronicling her struggles with cultural identity, and the pull between the majority culture in which she was educated, and the Dakota culture into which she was born and raised. Her later books were among the first works to bring traditional Native American stories to a widespread white English-speaking readership.

She was co-founder of the National Council of American Indians in 1926, which was established to lobby for Native people&#x27;s right to United States citizenship and other civil rights they had long been denied. Zitkala-Ša served as the council&#x27;s president until her death in 1938. Zitkala-Ša has been noted as one of the most influential Native American activists of the 20th century. Working with American musician William F. Hanson, Zitkala-Ša wrote the libretto and songs for &quot;The Sun Dance Opera&quot; (1913), the first American Indian opera. It was composed in romantic musical style, and based on Sioux and Ute cultural themes.

==Early life and education==

Zitkala-Ša was born on February 22, 1876, on the Yankton Indian Reservation in South Dakota. She was raised by her mother, Ellen Simmons, whose Dakota name was (Every Wind or Reaches for the Wind). Her father was a Frenchman named Felker, who abandoned the family when Zitkala-Ša was very young.

For her first eight years, Zitkala-Ša lived with her mother on the reservation. She later described those days as ones of freedom and happiness, safe in the care of her mother&#x27;s people and tribe. In 1884, when Zitkala-Ša was eight, missionaries came to the reservation. They recruited several Yankton children, including Zitkala-Ša, taking them to be educated at the White&#x27;s Indiana Manual Labor Institute, a Quaker missionary boarding school in Wabash, Indiana. This training school was founded by Josiah White for the education of &quot;poor children, white, colored, and Indian&quot; to help them advance in society.

Zitkala-Ša attended the school for three years until 1887. She later wrote about this period in her work, &quot;The School Days of an Indian Girl.&quot; She described the deep misery of having her heritage stripped away when she was forced to pray as a Quaker and to cut her traditionally long hair. By contrast, she took joy in learning to read, write, and play the violin.

In 1887, Zitkala-Ša returned to the Yankton Reservation to live with her mother. She spent three years there. She was dismayed to realize that, while she still longed for the native Yankton traditions, she no longer fully belonged to them. Besides, she thought that many on the reservation were conforming to the dominant white culture.

In 1891, wanting more education, Zitkala-Ša decided at age fifteen to return to the White&#x27;s Indiana Manual Labor Institute. She planned to gain more through her education than becoming a housekeeper, a role the school anticipated most female students would pursue. She studied piano and violin and started to teach music at White&#x27;s after the music teacher resigned. In June 1895, when Zitkala-Ša was awarded her diploma, she gave a speech on the inequality of women&#x27;s rights, which was praised highly by the local newspaper.

Though her mother wanted her to return home after graduation, Zitkala-Ša chose to attend Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, where she had been offered a scholarship. While initially feeling isolated and uncertain among her predominantly white peers, she proved her oratorical talents with a speech titled &quot;Side by Side.” During this time, she began gathering traditional stories from a spectrum of Native tribes, translating them into Latin and English for children to read. In 1897, six weeks before graduation, she was forced to leave Earlham College due to ill health and financial difficulties.

==Music and teaching==

From 1897 to 1899 Zitkala-Ša studied and played the violin at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. In 1899, she took a position at Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania, where she taught music to children. She also facilitated debates on the treatment of Native Americans.

At the 1900 Paris Exposition, she played violin with the school&#x27;s Carlisle Indian Band. In the same year, she began writing articles on Native American life, which were published in national periodicals such as &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot;. Her critical appraisal of the American Indian boarding school system and vivid portrayal of Indian deracination contrasted markedly to the more idealistic writings of most of her contemporaries.

Also in 1901, Zitkala-Ša was sent by Carlisle&#x27;s founder, Colonel Richard Henry Pratt, to the Yankton Reservation to recruit students. It was her first visit in several years. She was troubled to find her mother&#x27;s house in disrepair, her brother&#x27;s family had fallen into poverty, and white settlers were beginning to occupy lands allotted to the Yankton Dakota under the Dawes Act of 1887.

Upon returning to the Carlisle School, Zitkala-Ša came into conflict with Pratt. She resented his rigid program to assimilate Native Americans into dominant white culture and the limitations of the curriculum. It prepared Native American children only for low-level manual work, assuming they would return to rural cultures. That year she published an article in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot; describing the profound loss of identity felt by a Native American boy after undergoing the assimilationist education at the school, a story called &quot;The Soft Hearted Sioux,&quot; which Pratt called &quot;trash.&quot; In 1901, Zitkala-Ša was dismissed from the Carlisle School.

Soon after, she took a job as a clerk at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation where she likely met Bonnin.

==Marriage and family==
Zitkala-Ša returned to the Yankton Reservation after her time at the Carlisle School and cared for her ailing mother. Her relationship with her mother was strained after a disagreement over Zitkala-Ša&#x27;s decision to continue her education. She also spent this time gathering material for her collection of traditional Sioux stories
 to publish in &quot;Old Indian Legends&quot;, commissioned by the Boston publisher Ginn and Company.

In early 1901, she was engaged to Carlos Montezuma, a Yavapi (Mohave-Apache) doctor and Indigenous activist. Her letters to Montezuma verify that the Carlisle school and its president and founder were a major cause of concern. In her letters, she repeatedly mentions Pratt and Carlisle, calling Pratt &quot;woefully small&quot; and &quot;bigoted&quot; (5 March 1901) and writing that she &quot;imagines Carlisle will rear up on its haunches&quot; after one of her stories is published (Summer 1901). Zitkala-Ša explains to Montezuma that even though she &quot;offends the Col.,&quot; she &quot;won&#x27;t be another&#x27;s mouthpiece-[she] will say just what [she] thinks&quot; (5 March 1901). It is both because of and through her rejection of Pratt and his educational plan that Zitkala-Ša inscribes her strategic rhetoric of pedagogical resistance. She broke off her engagement and relationship with Montezuma by August. He had refused to give up his private medical practice in Chicago and relocate with her to the Yankton Indian Agency, where she wanted to return.

In 1902, she met and married Raymond Talephause Bonnin, who was of Yankton-European ancestry and culturally Yankton. Soon after their marriage, Bonnin was assigned by the BIA to the Uintah-Ouray reservation in Utah. The couple lived and worked there with the Ute people for the next fourteen years. During this period, Zitkala-Ša gave birth to the couple&#x27;s only child, Raymond Ohiya Bonnin.

Her husband, Bonnin, enlisted in the US Army in 1917 after the United States declared war against the German Empire during World War I. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1918. He served in the Quarter Master Corps in Washington, D.C., and was honorably discharged with the rank of captain in 1920.

==Writing career==

Zitkala-Ša had a fruitful writing career, with two major periods. The first period was from 1900 to 1904, when she published legends collected from Native American culture, as well as autobiographical narratives. She continued to write during the following years, but she did not publish any of these writings. These unpublished writings, along with others including the libretto of the &quot;Sun Dance Opera&quot;, were collected and published posthumously in 2001 as &quot;Dreams and Thunder: Stories, Poems, and the Sun Dance Opera&quot;.

Zitkala-Ša&#x27;s articles in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; were published from 1900 to 1902. They included &quot;An Indian Teacher Among Indians&quot;, published in Volume 85 in 1900. Included in the same issue were &quot;Impressions of an Indian Childhood&quot; and &quot;School Days of an Indian Girl&quot;. Zitkala-Ša&#x27;s other articles were published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot;. &quot;Soft-Hearted Sioux&quot; appeared in the March 1901 issue, Volume 102, and &quot;The Trial Path&quot; in the October 1901 issue, Volume 103. She also wrote &quot;A Warrior&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, published in 1902 in Volume 6 of &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. In 1902, Zitkala-Ša published &quot;Why I Am a Pagan&quot; in &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, volume 90. It was a treatise on her personal spiritual beliefs. She countered the contemporary trend that suggested Native Americans readily adopted and conformed to the Christianity forced on them in schools and public life.

Much of her work is characterized by its liminal nature: tensions between tradition and assimilation, and between literature and politics. This tension has been described as generating much of the dynamism of her work.

The second phase of her writing career was from 1916 to 1924. During this period, Zitkala-Ša concentrated on writing and publishing political works. She and her husband had moved to Washington, D.C., where she became politically active. She published some of her most influential writings, including &quot;American Indian Stories&quot; (1921) with the Hayworth Publishing House.

She co-authored &quot;Oklahoma&#x27;s Poor Rich Indians: An Orgy of Graft and Exploitation of the Five Civilized Tribes, Legalized Robbery&quot; (1923), an influential pamphlet, with Charles H. Fabens of the American Indian Defense Association and Matthew K. Sniffen of the Indian Rights Association. Included in the &quot;Oklahoma&#x27;s Poor Rich Indians&quot; publication was information about Stella Mason, as well as others. She also created the Indian Welfare Committee of the General Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs, working as a researcher for it through much of the 1920s.

===&quot;American Indian Stories&quot;===

&quot;American Indian Stories&quot; is a collection of childhood stories, allegorical fiction, and an essay, including several of Zitkala-Ša&#x27;s articles that were originally published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot; and &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. First published in 1921, these stories told of the hardships which she and other Native Americans encountered at the missionary and manual labor schools designed to &quot;civilize&quot; them and assimilate them to majority culture. The autobiographical writings described her early life on the Yankton Reservation, her years as a student at White&#x27;s Manual Labor Institute and Earlham College, and her time teaching at Carlisle Indian Industrial School. 

Her autobiography contrasted the charm of her early life on the reservation with the &quot;iron routine&quot; which she found in the assimilation boarding schools. Zitkala-Ša wrote: &quot;Perhaps my Indian nature is the moaning wind which stirs them [schoolteachers] now for their present record. But, however tempestuous this is within me, it comes out as the low voice of a curiously colored seashell, which is only for those ears that are bent with compassion to hear it.&quot;

===&quot;Old Indian Legends&quot;===
Commissioned by the Boston publisher Ginn and Company, &quot;Old Indian Legends&quot; (1901) was a collection of stories including some that she learned as a child and others she had gathered from various tribes. Directed primarily at children, the collection was an attempt both to preserve Native American traditions and stories in print and to garner respect and recognition for those from the dominant European-American culture. 

===&quot;Oklahoma&#x27;s Poor Rich Indians&quot;===
One of Zitkala-Ša&#x27;s most influential pieces of political writing, &quot;Oklahoma&#x27;s Poor Rich Indians”, was published in 1923 by the Indian Rights Association. The article exposed several American corporations that had been working systematically, through such extra-legal means as robbery and even murder, to defraud Native American tribes, particularly the Osage. After oil was discovered on their lands, speculators and criminals tried to acquire their headrights to leasing fees from development of their oil-rich land in Oklahoma. During the 1920s, numerous Osage were murdered.

The work influenced Congress to pass the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, which encouraged tribes to re-establish self-government, including management of their lands. Under this act, the government returned some lands to them as communal property, which it had previously classified as surplus, so they could put together parcels that could be managed.

===Articles for &quot;American Indian Magazine&quot;===
Zitkala-Ša was an active member of the Society of American Indians (SAI), which published &quot;American Indian Magazine&quot;. From 1918 to 1919 she served as editor of the magazine, as well as contributing numerous articles. These were her most explicitly political writings, covering topics such as the contribution of Native American soldiers to World War I, issues of land allotment, and corruption within the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the agency within the Department of Interior that oversaw American Indians. Many of her political writings have since been criticized for favoring assimilation. She called for recognition of Native American culture and traditions, while also advocating US citizenship rights to bring Native Americans into mainstream America. She believed this was the way that they could both gain political power and protect their cultures.

==Making an opera==
While Zitkala-Ša lived on the Uintah-Ouray reservation in Utah, she met American composer William F. Hanson, who was a professor of music at Brigham Young University. Together, in 1910, they started their collaboration on the music for &quot;The Sun Dance Opera&quot;, for which Zitkala-Ša wrote the libretto and songs. She also played Sioux melodies on the violin and flute, and Hanson used this as the basis of his music composition. She based it on the Lakota Sun Dance, which the federal government prohibited the Ute from performing on the reservation.

The opera premiered in Utah in February 1913, with dancing and some parts performed by the Ute from the nearby Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation, and lead singing roles filled by non-natives. According to historian Tadeusz Lewandowski, it was the first Native opera. It debuted at Orpheus Hall in Vernal, Utah, to high local praise and critical acclaim. Few works of Native American opera since have dealt so exclusively with Native American themes. 

In 1938, the New York Light Opera Guild presented &quot;The Sun Dance Opera&quot; at The Broadway Theatre as its opera of the year.

==Political activism==

Zitkala-Ša was politically active throughout most of her adult life. During her time on the Uintah-Ouray reservation in Utah, she was involved with the Society of American Indians (SAI) which was dedicated to preserving the Native American way of life while lobbying for the right to full American citizenship. The letterhead of the council stationery claimed that the overall goals for SAI was to &quot;help Indians help themselves in protecting their rights and properties&quot;. Zitkala-Ša served as SAI&#x27;s secretary beginning in 1916. Since the late 20th century, activists have criticized SAI and Zitkala-Ša as misguided in their strong advocacy of citizenship and employment rights for Native Americans. Such critics believe that Native Americans have lost cultural identity as they have become more part of mainstream American society.

Zitkala-Ša and her family relocated to Washington, D.C., when the SAI appointed her as national secretary in 1916. As the secretary for SAI, Zitkala-Ša corresponded with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). She began to criticize practices of the BIA, such as their attempt at the national boarding schools to prohibit Native American children from using their native languages and cultural practices. She reported incidents of abuse resulting from children&#x27;s refusal to pray in a Christian manner.

From Washington, Zitkala-Ša began lecturing nationwide on behalf of SAI to promote greater awareness of the cultural and tribal identity of Native Americans. During the 1920s she promoted a pan-Indian movement to unite all of America&#x27;s tribes in the cause of lobbying for citizenship rights. In 1924 the Indian Citizenship Act was passed, granting US citizenship rights to most Indigenous peoples who did not already have it.

While Native Americans now had citizenship, discrimination remained widespread. In some states their right to vote was denied, a situation not fully changed until the Civil rights movement of the 1960s. In 1926, she and her husband founded the National Council of American Indians (NCAI), dedicated to the cause of uniting the tribes throughout the US in the cause of gaining full citizenship rights through suffrage. From 1926 until she died in 1938, Zitkala-Ša served as president, major fundraiser, and speaker for the NCAI. Her early work was largely forgotten after the organization was revived in 1944 under male leadership.

Zitkala-Ša was also active in the 1920s in the movement for women&#x27;s rights, joining the General Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs (GFWC) in 1921. This grassroots organization was dedicated to diversity in its membership and to maintaining a public voice for women&#x27;s concerns. Through the GFWC she created the Indian Welfare Committee in 1924. She helped initiate a government investigation into the exploitation of Native Americans in Oklahoma and the attempts being made to defraud them of drilling rights and leasing fees for their oil-rich lands. She undertook a speaking tour across the country for the General Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs where she called for the abolition of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

In addition to her other organizing, Zitkala-Ša also ran a voter registration drive among Native Americans. She encouraged them to support the Curtis Bill, which she believed would be favorable for Indians. Though the bill granted Native Americans US citizenship, it did not grant those living on reservations the right to vote in local and state elections. Zitkala-Ša continued to work for civil rights, and better access to health care and education for Native Americans until she died in 1938.

==Death and legacy==

Zitkala-Ša died on January 26, 1938, in Washington, D.C., at the age of 61. She is buried as Gertrude Simmons Bonnin in Arlington National Cemetery with her husband Raymond. In the late 20th century, the University of Nebraska reissued many of her writings on Native American culture.

She has been recognized by the naming of a Venusian crater &quot;Bonnin&quot; in her honor. In 1997 she was designated a Women&#x27;s History Month Honoree by the National Women&#x27;s History Project. Zitkala-Ša lived part of her life in the Lyon Park neighborhood of Arlington County, Virginia, near Washington, DC. In 2020, a park in that neighborhood that had previously been named for Henry Clay was renamed in her honor.

In 2018, Melodia Women&#x27;s Choir of New York City performed the world premiere of a commissioned work based on the story of Zitkala-Ša, &quot;Red Bird&quot; by Cevanne Horrocks-Hopayian.

Chris Pappan illustrated a Google Doodle that incorporated ledger art for use in the United States on February 22, 2021, to celebrate her 145th birthday.

In 2022 an opera based on her life and work was released: &quot;Mináǧi kiŋ dowáŋ: A Zitkála-Šá Opera&quot;. It is the first opera to use Dakota language.

Zitkala-Ša&#x27;s legacy lives on as one of the most influential Native American activists of the 20th century. She left an influential theory of Indian resistance and a crucial model for reform. Through her activism, Zitkala-Ša was able to make crucial changes to education, health care, and legal standing for Native American people and the preservation of Indian culture.

Zitkala-Ša is featured on a 2024 American Women quarter.

<text>Ajdovščina (; , ) is a town in the Vipava Valley (&quot;Vipavska dolina&quot;), Slovenia. It is the administrative seat of the Municipality of Ajdovščina.

==History==
The first mentions of Ajdovščina go back to circa 2000 BC. In the Bronze Age and the Iron Age a fortified settlement stood on the nearby hill of Gradišče. In the early period of the Roman Empire, after a road was built from Aquileia towards Emona, a small post and goods station known as &quot;mansio Fluvio Frigido&quot; stood on the site of today&#x27;s Ajdovščina.

In the late 3rd century and the early 4th century a fortification system, &quot;Claustra Alpium Iuliarum&quot;, which run from the Kvarner Gulf to Cividale, was built by the Roman Empire. Its centre was the fortress of &quot;Castra&quot; or &quot;Castrum ad Fluvio Frigido&quot;, the remains of which are today still visible in Ajdovščina.

Despite the fact that the Italian border is less than 20 km away and that Ajdovščina was under Italian administration from 1918 to 1947, and from 1927 as a commune of the Province of Gorizia (as &quot;Aidussina&quot;), during Italian rule (1918–1943, nominally lasted to 1947), the style of the town does not resemble that of a typical Italian town. The strong bora winds would cause damage to the usual Italian house construction. Thus the population adopted and modified the classical Karst architecture for their own needs; for example, by putting stones on roofs to weight down the tiles against the strong winds.

After World War II Ajdovščina became the economic and cultural centre of the upper Vipava Valley. Major industries include textile fabrics, construction, food, beverages, and furniture.

Ajdovščina annexed the formerly independent settlements of Gradišče and Šturje () in 1953.

==Geography and climate==
The Hubelj River is the dividing line between the two largest parts of Ajdovščina, locally known as Šturje and Ajdovščina. During the pre-World War I years the river was also the border between the Austrian lands of Gorizia and Gradisca and Carniola.

The climate is Mediterranean (minimum temperature in winter , maximum ; in the summer time maximum temperature , minimum . The town is located around 25 km from the Adriatic Sea.

===Churches===

The parish church in Ajdovščina is dedicated to John the Baptist and belongs to the Diocese of Koper. It is built on the site of a Roman cemetery. Its interior was painted by the local Baroque painter Anton Čebej. A second parish within the urban area of Ajdovščina is the Parish of Šturje, with the parish church dedicated to Saint George and another church dedicated to Saint Lawrence. The church in the hamlet of Fužine north of the main town, dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua, also belongs to this parish.

<doc id="200589" wikidata="Q1229845" url="?curid=200589" title="Vicus Tuscus">
<text>Vicus Tuscus (&quot;Etruscan Street&quot; or &quot;Tuscan Street&quot;) was an ancient street in the city of Rome, running southwest out of the Roman Forum between the Basilica Julia and the Temple of Castor and Pollux towards the Forum Boarium and Circus Maximus via the west side of the Palatine Hill and Velabrum.

==History==
The name of Vicus Tuscus is believed to have originated from Etruscan immigration to Rome. Two distinct historical events are said by ancient authors to have led to the name. Tacitus says the name arose from the Etruscans who had come to aid the Romans against Titus Tatius, a Sabine ruler who invaded Rome in around 750 BC after Romans abducted Sabine women, and later settled down in the neighborhood of the Roman forum. Livy, on the other hand, says the name came from the remnants of the Clusian army who settled in the area following the War between Clusium and Aricia in 508 BC.

Some say the settlement was composed of workers whose task in Rome was to construct the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.

Dionysius indicates that the Roman senate provided Etruscans a place to build houses near Vicus Tuscus.

==Background==
Though originally a residential area of wealthy families; by the Republican time, the Vicus Tuscus became a hub of Roman commerce where there were many stores (&quot;horrea&quot;) on both sides, such as booksellers. According to Horace&#x27;s Epistles, books were on sale in front of the statues of Etruscan god Vertumnus and Janus Geminus in the Tuscan street and inside the Forum. The most influential merchants were expert dealers of incense and perfume (&quot;turarii&quot; in Latin), giving rise to the street&#x27;s second name - Vicus Turarius. Propertius recorded that these tradesmen made sacrificial offerings to Vertumnus, whose statue stood on Vicus Tuscus.

==Function==
Vicus Tuscus was frequently used as an important path of communication between the Roman Forum and the Forum Boarium and Circus Maximus. When Romans conducted a sacrificial rite to their gods, two white cows were led through Vicus Tuscus and Velabrum via the forum Boarium, to arrive at the Temple of Juno Regina on the Aventine Hill.

During the Ludi Romani, the Vicus Tuscus was a route for processions. Statues of gods on wagons were paraded through here from the Capitoline Hill to the Circus Maximus. Plautus also tells us (&quot;Curculio&quot;, IV 482) that around 193 BCE, this was the spot for male prostitution in Rome.

<text>Johann Joseph Görres, since 1839 von Görres (25 January 1776 – 29 January 1848), was a German writer, philosopher, theologian, historian and journalist.

==Early life==
Görres was born in Koblenz. His father was moderately well off, and sent his son to a Latin college under the direction of the Jesuits. The young Görres&#x27; sympathies were initially with the French Revolution, and the French exiles in the Rhineland confirmed his beliefs, which would then evolve over time. He began a republican journal called &quot;Das rote Blatt&quot;, and afterwards &quot;Rübezahl&quot;, in which he strongly condemned the administration of the Rhenish provinces by France.

After the Treaty of Campo Formio (1797) there was hope that the Rhenish provinces would be constituted into an independent republic. He was one of several delegates sent by the Rhine and Moselle provinces to Paris in the fall of the year 1799, to protest against the conduct of the French general Leval in the Rhine country. The embassy reached Paris on 20 November 1799; two days before this Napoleon had assumed power. After much delay he received the embassy; but the only answer they obtained was &quot;that they might rely on perfect justice, and that the French government would never lose sight of their wants&quot;. His stay in Paris cured him of his enthusiasm for the French Revolution, Görres on his return published a tract called &quot;Resultate meiner Sendung nach Paris&quot;, in which he gave his impressions.
During the thirteen years of Napoleon&#x27;s dominion Görres lived a quiet life, devoting himself chiefly to art or science. In 1801 he married Catherine de Lasaulx, and for some years taught at a secondary school in Koblenz; in 1806 he moved to Heidelberg, where he lectured at the university. British lawyer and diarist Henry Crabb Robinson met Görres during this time. A quote from his diary:
Görres has the wildest physiognomy – looks like an overgrown old student. A faun-like nose and lips, fierce eyes, and locks as wild as Caliban’s. Strong sense, with a sort of sulky indifference toward others, are the characteristics of his manner.
Clemens Brentano compared his appearance to that
[...] of an old lion shaking and pulling his mane caught in the bars of his cage.
As a leading member of the Heidelberg Romantic group, he edited together with Brentano and Ludwig Achim von Arnim the &quot;Zeitung für Einsiedler&quot; (subsequently renamed &quot;Trost-Einsamkeit&quot;), and in 1807 he published &quot;Die deutschen Volksbücher&quot; (literally, &quot;The Books of the German People&quot;).

He returned to Koblenz in 1808, and again found occupation as a teacher in a secondary school, supported by civic funds. He now studied Persian, and in two years published a &quot;Mythengeschichte der asiatischen Welt&quot; (&quot;History of the Myths of the Asiatic World&quot;), which was followed ten years later by &quot;Das Heldenbuch von Iran&quot; (&quot;The Book of Heroes of Iran&quot;), a translation of part of the &quot;Shahnama&quot;, the epic of Firdousi.

==Editor of the &quot;Merkur&quot;==
In 1813 he again took up the cause of national independence, and in the following year founded &quot;Der rheinische Merkur&quot;. The outspokenness of its hostility to Napoleon made it influential, and Napoleon himself called it &quot;a fifth power&quot;. It campaigned for a united Germany, with a representative government, but under an emperor, Görres having abandoned his earlier advocacy of republicanism. When Napoleon was at Elba, Görres wrote an ironic imaginary proclamation issued by him to the people. He criticised the second peace of Paris (1815), declaring that Alsace and Lorraine should have been demanded back from France.

Stein used the &quot;Merkur&quot; at the time of the meeting of the congress of Vienna to give expression to his hopes. But Hardenberg, in May 1815, warned Görres to remember that he was not to arouse hostility against France, but only against Napoleon. There was also in the &quot;Merkur&quot; a demand for a constitution for Prussia, expression of the desire that an Austrian prince should assume the imperial title, and also a tendency to liberalism—all distasteful to Hardenberg, and to his master Friedrich Wilhelm III. Görres disregarded warnings sent to him by the censorship, so that the &quot;Merkur&quot; was suppressed early in 1816, at the instance of the Prussian government; and soon after Görres was dismissed from his teaching post.

== Life as an independent writer ==

He went back to Heidelberg, but in 1817 returned to Coblenz and founded a relief-society for the alleviation of distress in the Rhenish province. At the same time he continued his work as a political pamphleteer, as shown chiefly in his &quot;Adresse der Stadt und Landschaft Koblenz und ihre Uebergabe beim Fürsten Hardenberg&quot; (1818) and his brochure &quot;Teutschland und die Revolution&quot; (1819). In this work he reviewed the circumstances which had led to the murder of August von Kotzebue, and, while expressing horror at the deed itself, he urged that it was impossible and undesirable to repress the free utterance of public opinion. The success of the work was marked, despite a ponderous style. It was suppressed by the Prussian government, which confiscated his papers and ordered his arrest. He escaped, however, to Frankfort, whence he made his way to Strasbourg.

Two more political tracts were &quot;Europa und die Revolution&quot; (&quot;Europe and the Revolution&quot;, 1821) and &quot;In Sachen der Rheinprovinzen und in eigener Angelegenheit&quot; (&quot;In the matter of the Rhine Province and in a matter of my own&quot;, 1822). In the former book – read with avidity throughout Germany. – Görres describes the moral, intellectual and political corruption of France in the course of the eighteenth century as the major cause which led to the revolution:

In his pamphlet &quot;Die heilige Allianz und die Völker auf dem Congresse von Verona&quot; (&quot;The Holy Alliance and the peoples represented at the congress of Verona&quot;, 1822) Görres asserted that the princes had met together to crush the liberties of the people, and that the people must look elsewhere for help. The &quot;elsewhere&quot; was to Rome; and from this time Görres became an Ultramontane writer. In 1826, he was summoned to Munich by King Ludwig of Bavaria as professor of history in the university, and there his writing enjoyed popularity. There he was visited by Brentano, Lacordaire, Lamennais, and Montalembert.

Since his sojourn in Strasbourg, Görres had studied the mystic testimonies of various epochs. He went into the mystical writers of the Middle Ages such as María de Ágreda as well as observing, partly in person, the ecstatic young women of his time (Maria von Mörl, and others), and strove to comprehend more thoroughly the nature of Christian mysticism. His &quot;Christliche Mystik&quot; (&quot;On christian mysticism&quot;, 4 vols., 1836–1842; 2nd ed., 5 vols., 1879) gave a series of biographies of the saints, together with an exposition of Roman Catholic mysticism. But his most celebrated ultramontane work was a polemical one. Its occasion was the deposition and imprisonment by the Prussian government of the archbishop Clement Wenceslaus reportedly due to his refusal to sanction in certain instances the marriages of Protestants and Roman Catholics.

In his &quot;Athanasius&quot; (1837), Görres upheld the power of the church. &quot;Athanasius&quot; went through several editions, and initiated a long and bitter controversy. In the &quot;Historisch-politische Blätter&quot; (&quot;Historical-political pages&quot;), a Munich journal, Görres and his son Guido (1805–1852) continued to uphold the claims of the church. On New Year&#x27;s Day of 1839, Görres received the &quot;Civil Order of Merit&quot; from the king for his services.

==Death==
He died 29 January 1848, the year of the fall of Metternich, and was buried in the Alter Südfriedhof in Munich.

<doc id="200591" wikidata="Q375792" url="?curid=200591" title="Warren Zevon">
<text>Warren William Zevon (January 24, 1947 – September 7, 2003) was an American rock singer and songwriter. His most famous compositions include &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;, &quot;Lawyers, Guns and Money&quot; and &quot;Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner&quot;. All three songs are featured on his third album, &quot;Excitable Boy&quot; (1978), the title track of which is also well-known. He also wrote major hits that were recorded by other artists, including &quot;Poor Poor Pitiful Me&quot;, &quot;Mohammed&#x27;s Radio&quot;, &quot;Carmelita&quot; and &quot;Hasten Down the Wind&quot;. Per &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Mr. Zevon had a pulp-fiction imagination&quot; which yielded &quot;terse, action-packed, gallows-humored tales that could sketch an entire screenplay in four minutes and often had death as a punchline. But there was also vulnerability and longing in Mr. Zevon&#x27;s ballads, like &#x27;Mutineer,&#x27; &#x27;Accidentally Like a Martyr&#x27; and &#x27;Hasten Down the Wind.&#x27;&quot;

Zevon had early music industry successes as a session musician, jingle composer, songwriter, touring musician, musical coordinator, and bandleader. However, he struggled to break through with a solo career until Linda Ronstadt performed his music on her 1976 album &quot;Hasten Down the Wind&quot;. It launched a cult following that lasted 25 years, with Zevon making occasional returns to album and single charts until his death from mesothelioma in 2003. He briefly found a new audience by teaming up with members of R.E.M. in the blues rock outfit Hindu Love Gods for a 1990 album release, although no tour followed. In 2023, Zevon was nominated for inclusion in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Known for his dry wit and acerbic lyrics, he was a frequent guest on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; and the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. On Zevon&#x27;s last appearance, Letterman asked him if he had learned anything about matters of life and death. Zevon said he&#x27;d learned &quot;How much you&#x27;re supposed to enjoy every sandwich.&quot;

==Early life==
Zevon was born in Chicago, the son of Beverly Cope (née Simmons) and William Zevon. His father was a Jewish immigrant from Ukraine, whose original surname was Zivotofsky. William Zevon worked as a bookie who handled volume bets and dice games for the notorious Los Angeles mobster Mickey Cohen. He worked for years in the Cohen gang, in which he was known as Stumpy Zevon, and was best man at Cohen&#x27;s first wedding. Warren&#x27;s mother was from a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints family and of English descent. They later moved to Fresno, California, and by the age of 13, Zevon was an occasional visitor to the home of Igor Stravinsky, where he briefly studied modern classical music alongside Robert Craft. Zevon&#x27;s parents divorced when he was 16 years old. He soon quit high school and, driving a sports car William won in a card game, moved from Los Angeles to New York City to become a folk singer.

==Career==
===Early years===
Zevon turned to a musical career early, forming a musical duo with his high school friend, Violet Santangelo, called lyme &amp; cybelle (the lack of capitalisation was a deliberate styling move). Bones Howe produced their first single, the minor hit &quot;Follow Me&quot;, which was written by Zevon and Santangelo and reached number 65 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop charts in April 1966. A follow-up single, a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;If You Gotta Go, Go Now&quot; flopped, and Zevon left the duo. A third single without Zevon and another session that included him but was not previously released were included on the 2003 compilation &quot;The First Sessions&quot;.

Zevon spent time as a session musician and jingle composer. He wrote several songs for his White Whale labelmates The Turtles (&quot;Like the Seasons&quot; and &quot;Outside Chance&quot;), though his participation in their recording—if any—is unknown. Another early Zevon composition, &quot;She Quit Me&quot;, was included in the soundtrack for the film &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969); to suit its place in the film, the song was re-recorded by Leslie Miller as &quot;He Quit Me&quot;.

Zevon&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; (1970), was spearheaded by 1960s cult figure Kim Fowley but received almost no attention and did not sell well. Though Zevon continued to play occasional live dates as a solo artist, the next several years of his career were dominated by session work with other musicians.

During the early 1970s, Zevon toured regularly with The Everly Brothers as keyboard player, band leader, and musical coordinator. Later that decade, he toured with Don Everly and Phil Everly separately as they tried to launch solo careers after their breakup. He worked particularly closely with Phil, arranging and playing keyboards on his solo albums &quot;Star Spangled Springer&quot; (1973) and &quot;Mystic Line&quot; (1975) and co-writing tracks on &quot;Phil&#x27;s Diner&quot; (1974) and &quot;Mystic Line&quot;. Zevon&#x27;s song &quot;Carmelita&quot; was also recorded by Canadian singer Murray McLauchlan on his self-titled album of 1972.

These small successes were not particularly rewarding financially, and Zevon&#x27;s dissatisfaction with his career (and a lack of funds) led him to briefly move to Spain in the summer of 1975. He lived and played in the Dubliner Bar, a small tavern in Sitges, near Barcelona, owned by mercenary David Lindell. Together they composed &quot;Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner&quot;.

===Return to L.A. and major-label debut===

By September 1975 Zevon had returned to Los Angeles, where he roomed with Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac. There he collaborated with Jackson Browne, who produced and promoted Zevon&#x27;s self-titled major-label debut in 1976. Contributors to the album included Nicks, Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, members of the Eagles, Carl Wilson, Linda Ronstadt and Bonnie Raitt. Ronstadt elected to record many of his songs, including &quot;Hasten Down the Wind&quot;, &quot;Carmelita&quot;, &quot;Poor Poor Pitiful Me&quot; and &quot;Mohammed&#x27;s Radio&quot;. Zevon&#x27;s first tour, in 1977, included guest appearances in the middle of Jackson Browne concerts, one of which is documented on a widely circulated bootleg recording of a Dutch radio program under the title &quot;The Offender Meets the Pretender&quot;.

Produced by Browne, &quot;Warren Zevon&quot; (1976) was his first album to chart in the United States, peaking at No. 189. The first edition of the &quot;Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; (1979) called it &quot;a masterpiece&quot;. The guide&#x27;s latest edition (2004) calls it Zevon&#x27;s &quot;most realized work&quot;. Representative tracks include the junkie&#x27;s lament &quot;Carmelita&quot;; the Copland-esque outlaw ballad &quot;Frank and Jesse James&quot;; &quot;The French Inhaler&quot;, a scathing look at life and lust in the L.A. music business (which was actually about Marilyn Livingston, his long-time girlfriend and mother of his son, Jordan); and &quot;Desperados Under the Eaves&quot;, a chronicle of Zevon&#x27;s increasing alcoholism.

===Success===
In 1978, Zevon released &quot;Excitable Boy&quot; (produced by Jackson Browne and guitarist Waddy Wachtel) to critical acclaim and popular success. The title tune is about a juvenile sociopath&#x27;s murderous prom night and referred to &quot;Little Susie&quot;, the heroine of the song &quot;Wake Up Little Susie&quot; made famous by his former employers The Everly Brothers. Other songs, such as &quot;Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner&quot; and &quot;Lawyers, Guns and Money&quot;, used deadpan humor to wed geopolitical subtexts to hard-boiled narratives. The single &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;, featuring McVie, Fleetwood and Zevon&#x27;s signature macabre humor, reached No. 21 on the charts.

Dave Marsh called Zevon &quot;one of the toughest rockers ever to come out of Southern California&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; record reviews editor Paul Nelson called the album &quot;one of the most significant releases of the 1970s&quot; and placed Zevon alongside Jackson Browne, Neil Young, and Bruce Springsteen as the four most important new artists to emerge in the decade. On May 11, 1980, Zevon and Willie Nile appeared on the King Biscuit Flower Hour.
Zevon followed &quot;Excitable Boy&quot; with &quot;Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School&quot; (1980). The album was dedicated to Ken Millar, better known under his nom-de-plume as the detective novelist Ross Macdonald, one of Zevon&#x27;s literary heroes. Millar and Zevon first met in an intervention organized by Nelson, which helped Zevon temporarily curtail his addictions. Featuring a modest hit with the single &quot;A Certain Girl&quot; (Zevon&#x27;s cover of an R&amp;B record by Ernie K-Doe) which reached No. 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, the album sold briskly but was uneven, and represented a decline rather than commercial and critical consistency. It contained a collaboration with Springsteen on &quot;Jeannie Needs a Shooter&quot;. The ballad &quot;Empty-Handed Heart&quot; (featuring a descant sung by Linda Ronstadt), is about Zevon&#x27;s divorce from his wife, Crystal, the mother of his daughter Ariel. (Zevon was in a long-term relationship with Marilyn &quot;Tule&quot; Livingston, the mother of his son, Jordan, but they never married.) Later in 1980, he released the live album &quot;Stand in the Fire&quot;, recorded over five nights at The Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles and dedicated to Martin Scorsese.

===Personal crisis and first comeback===
Zevon&#x27;s 1982 release &quot;The Envoy&quot; returned to the high standard of &quot;Excitable Boy&quot; but was not a commercial success. It was an eclectic but characteristic set that included such compositions as &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Pretty at All&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Medicine&quot; and &quot;Jesus Mentioned&quot;, the first of Zevon&#x27;s two musical reactions to the death of Elvis Presley. The album also contains the first of Zevon&#x27;s writing collaborations with respected writers of fiction: &quot;The Overdraft&quot;, co-written with Thomas McGuane. The title track was dedicated to Philip Habib, U.S. special envoy to the Middle East during the early 1980s. Zevon stated that after the song came out, Habib sent him &quot;a very nice letter of appreciation on State Department stationery&quot;. 

In 1983 Zevon, who was recently divorced, became engaged to Philadelphia disc jockey Anita Gevinson and moved to the East Coast. After &quot;The Envoy&quot; was poorly received by critics, Asylum Records ended their business relationship with Zevon, which Zevon discovered only when he read about it in the &quot;Random Notes&quot; column of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Following these career setbacks, he relapsed into drug and alcohol abuse. In 1984, he voluntarily checked himself into a rehab clinic in Minnesota. His relationship with Gevinson ended shortly thereafter. Zevon retreated from the music business for several years, except for playing live solo shows; during this time he finally overcame severe alcohol and drug addictions.

During this time, Zevon collaborated with Bill Berry, Peter Buck and Mike Mills (of R.E.M.) and backup vocalist Bryan Cook to form a minor project called Hindu Love Gods. The group released the non-charting single &quot;Narrator&quot; for IRS Records in 1984, then went into abeyance for several years. Berry, Buck and Mills served as the core of Zevon&#x27;s next studio band when he re-emerged in 1987 by signing with Virgin Records and recording the album &quot;Sentimental Hygiene&quot;. The release, hailed as his best since &quot;Excitable Boy&quot;, featured a thicker rock sound and taut, often humorous songs like &quot;Detox Mansion&quot;, &quot;Bad Karma&quot; (featuring R.E.M. lead singer Michael Stipe on backup vocals) and &quot;Reconsider Me&quot;. Included were contributions from Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Flea, Brian Setzer and George Clinton, as well as Berry, Buck and Mills. Also on hand were Zevon&#x27;s longtime collaborators Jorge Calderón and Waddy Wachtel. During the &quot;Sentimental Hygiene&quot; sessions, Zevon also participated in an all-night jam session with Berry, Buck and Mills, as they worked their way through rock and blues numbers by artists including Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson and Prince. Though the sessions were not initially intended for release, they eventually were as Hindu Love Gods&#x27; sole album.

The immediate follow-up to &quot;Sentimental Hygiene&quot; was 1989&#x27;s &quot;Transverse City&quot;, a futuristic concept album inspired by Zevon&#x27;s interest in the work of cyberpunk science fiction author William Gibson. It featured guests including Little Feat drummer Richie Hayward, Jefferson Airplane and Hot Tuna bassist Jack Casady, noted jazz keyboardist Chick Corea and various guitarists, including Wachtel, David Lindley, Jerry Garcia, Jorma Kaukonen, David Gilmour and Neil Young. Key tracks include the title song, &quot;Splendid Isolation&quot;, &quot;Run Straight Down&quot; (which had a promotional video that featured Zevon singing in a factory while Gilmour played guitar solos), and &quot;They Moved the Moon&quot; (one of Zevon&#x27;s eerier ballads).

===Later years and second comeback===
&quot;Transverse City&quot; was a commercial disappointment, and Zevon was dropped by Virgin Records soon after the album&#x27;s release. He almost immediately contracted, however, with Irving Azoff&#x27;s new label Giant Records. The first release under Zevon&#x27;s contract with his new distributor was the album &quot;Hindu Love Gods&quot;, recorded during the &quot;Sentimental Hygiene&quot; sessions. The album included a cover of Prince&#x27;s &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot;, which became a number 23 Modern Rock hit in the United States.

In 1991, Zevon, once again a solo artist, released &quot;Mr. Bad Example&quot;. The album featured the modest pop hit &quot;Searching for a Heart&quot; and the rocker &quot;Things to Do in Denver When You&#x27;re Dead&quot;, later used as the title of Gary Fleder&#x27;s film of the same name; after some skirmishing over the unauthorized use of Zevon&#x27;s song title, the Zevon track was licensed to play over the film&#x27;s end credits. Zevon also sang lead vocals on the song &quot;Casey Jones&quot; from the Grateful Dead tribute album &quot;Deadicated&quot;, with regular collaborator David Lindley.

Zevon toured the United States (with the Odds), Europe, Australia and New Zealand during this period. Owing to his reduced circumstances, his performances were often true solo efforts with minimal accompaniment on piano and guitar; the live album &quot;Learning to Flinch&quot; (1993) documents such a tour. Zevon often played in Colorado to allow for an opportunity to visit with his longtime friend Hunter S. Thompson.

A lifelong fan of hardboiled fiction, Zevon was friendly with several well-known writers, who also collaborated on his songwriting during this period, including Thompson, Carl Hiaasen and Mitch Albom. Zevon also served as musical coordinator and occasional guitarist for the ad-hoc rock music group the Rock Bottom Remainders, a collection of writers performing rock-and-roll standards at book fairs and other events. The group included Stephen King, Dave Barry, Matt Groening and Amy Tan, among other popular writers; it has continued to perform one benefit concert per year since Zevon&#x27;s death. Zevon played on and wrote liner notes for &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; (1998), a two-CD set attributed to the Wrockers, containing rock covers and originals by many of the Remainders authors plus such notables as Norman Mailer and Maya Angelou. 

Zevon oversaw music for the short-lived revival of the NBC series &quot;Route 66&quot; (1993), contributing that show&#x27;s main title theme, &quot;If You Won&#x27;t Leave Me I&#x27;ll Find Somebody Who Will&quot;. His music was also featured in the four William Shatner &quot;TekWar&quot; movies in 1994. Zevon is listed as &quot;theme music composer&quot; in the opening credits. His song &quot;Real or Not&quot; was used as the show&#x27;s end credit theme song. The song appeared on Zevon&#x27;s 2-CD set, &quot;I&#x27;ll Sleep When I&#x27;m Dead (An Anthology)&quot;. In the accompanying booklet, Zevon wrote, &quot;I wrote this song for the William Shatner TV movies based on his novels. He &quot;is&quot; Captain Kirk, rest assured. He&#x27;d call me at home and demand to hear the song in progress, then he&#x27;d say &quot;We need more guitars! More driving guitars!&quot; It was cool. The track reflected my secret fondness for sleazy English techno records.&quot;

Occasionally between 1982 and 2001, Zevon filled in for Paul Shaffer as bandleader on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; and later the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

In 1995, Zevon released the self-produced &quot;Mutineer&quot;. The title track was frequently covered by Bob Dylan on his U.S. fall tour in 2002. Zevon&#x27;s cover of cult artist Judee Sill&#x27;s &quot;Jesus Was a Crossmaker&quot; predated the wider rediscovery of her work a decade later. The album, however, had the worst sales of Zevon&#x27;s career, in part because of lack of promotion from his label, Giant. Rhino Records released a Zevon &quot;best-of&quot; compilation in 1996, &quot;I&#x27;ll Sleep When I&#x27;m Dead&quot;. Zevon also appeared on the &quot;Larry Sanders Show&quot; on HBO, in 1993, playing himself promoting &quot;Learning to Flinch&quot;. Zevon also played himself on two episodes of &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot; in 1999, along with singer and actor Rick Springfield.

After another five-year layoff, Zevon signed with industry veteran Danny Goldberg&#x27;s Artemis Records and again rebounded with the mortality-themed 2000 release &quot;Life&#x27;ll Kill Ya&quot;, containing the hymn-like &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Us Get Sick&quot; and an austere version of Steve Winwood&#x27;s 1980s hit &quot;Back in the High Life Again&quot;. With record sales brisk and music critics giving Zevon his best notices since &quot;Excitable Boy&quot;, &quot;Life&#x27;ll Kill Ya&quot; is seen as his second comeback. He followed with the album &quot;My Ride&#x27;s Here&quot; (2002), with its morbid prescience of things to come; the album included &quot;Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)&quot; (co-written by Albom and featuring Shaffer, the &quot;Late Night&quot; band and a spoken vocal from David Letterman) and the ballad &quot;Genius&quot;, written with Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Paul Muldoon.

At about this time, he and the actor Billy Bob Thornton formed a close friendship, catalyzed by their common experiences with obsessive-compulsive disorder and the fact they lived in the same apartment building. Zevon saw Thornton taking his mail in and out of his mailbox, and said: &quot;Oh, so you have that too.&quot; Zevon appeared with Thornton in Dwight Yoakam&#x27;s movie &quot;South of Heaven, West of Hell&quot; (2000).

===Cancer and &quot;The Wind&quot;===
In interviews, Zevon described a lifelong phobia of doctors and said he seldom consulted one. He had started working out, and he looked physically fit. Shortly before playing at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival in 2002, he started feeling dizzy and developed a chronic cough. After a period of suffering with pain and shortness of breath, Zevon was encouraged by his dentist to see a physician; he was diagnosed with pleural mesothelioma, a cancer (usually caused by exposure to asbestos) that affects the pleura, a thin membrane around the lungs and chest lining. Zevon was deeply shaken by the news and began drinking again after 17 years of sobriety.

Although Zevon never revealed where he may have been exposed to asbestos, his son Jordan suggests that it came from Zevon&#x27;s childhood, playing in the attic of his father&#x27;s carpet store in Arizona. Refusing treatments he believed might incapacitate him, Zevon instead began recording his final album, &quot;The Wind&quot;, which includes performances by close friends including Springsteen, Browne, Lindley, Thornton, Yoakam, Timothy B. Schmit, Don Henley, Joe Walsh, Emmylou Harris and Tom Petty. At the request of VH1, documentarian Nick Read was given access to the sessions and made the television film &quot;Inside Out: Warren Zevon&quot;.
On October 30, 2002, Zevon was featured alone on an episode of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. The band played &quot;I&#x27;ll Sleep When I&#x27;m Dead&quot; as his introduction. Zevon performed several songs and spoke at length about his illness. He noted, &quot;I might have made a tactical error in not going to a physician for 20 years.&quot; It was during this broadcast that, when asked by Letterman if he knew something more about life and death now, he first offered his oft-quoted insight that people need to &quot;enjoy every sandwich.&quot; He also thanked Letterman for his years of support, calling him &quot;the best friend my music&#x27;s ever had&quot;. For his final song of the evening, and his final public performance, Zevon performed &quot;Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner&quot; at Letterman&#x27;s request. In the green room after the show, Zevon presented Letterman with the guitar that he always used on the show, with a single request: &quot;Here, I want you to have this, take good care of it.&quot;

== Death and legacy ==
Zevon died of mesothelioma on September 7, 2003, aged 56, at his home in Los Angeles. His body was cremated, and his ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean near Los Angeles. 

Zevon&#x27;s friend Stephen King says: &quot;His albums are dense with stories and brilliant images.&quot; King dedicated his novel &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot; to Zevon. Carl Hiaasen recalls Zevon&#x27;s friendship with Hunter S. Thompson: &quot;Warren was close to Thompson, and their work shared a certain twisted energy. But Warren was very much his own writer, and he was more disciplined than Hunter. Warren was meticulous. Even when he was young and high as a kite, he agonised over his lyrics.&quot; Bruce Springsteen says Zevon &quot;would write something that had real meaning, and it was funny, too. I always envied that part of his ability and talent.&quot; David Crosby says: &quot;He was and remains one of my favourite songwriters. He saw things with a jaundiced eye that still got the humanity of things.&quot; Paul Muldoon collaborated with Zevon on his last album, and paid homage to him with his poem &quot;Sillyhow Stride.&quot;

Zevon said that, with his last recordings, he wanted to remind people that &quot;This was a nice deal: life.&quot;

==Posthumous releases and awards==
A tribute album titled &quot;Enjoy Every Sandwich: The Songs of Warren Zevon&quot; was released October 19, 2004. Zevon&#x27;s son, Jordan Zevon, was the executive producer of the album and performed &quot;Studebaker&quot;, a previously unfinished composition by his father. A second tribute album, &quot;Hurry Home Early: The Songs of Warren Zevon&quot; (&quot;hurry home early&quot; is from the song &quot;Boom Boom Mancini&quot;, on the album &quot;Sentimental Hygiene&quot;) was released by Wampus Multimedia on July 8, 2005.

On February 14, 2006, VH1 Classic premiered a music video from a new compilation, &quot;Reconsider Me: The Love Songs&quot;. The video, titled &quot;She&#x27;s Too Good for Me&quot;, aired every hour on the hour throughout the day.

Re-issues of the albums &quot;Stand in the Fire&quot; and &quot;The Envoy&quot; were released on March 27, 2007, by Rhino Records, alongside a re-issue of &quot;Excitable Boy&quot;, with the three CDs having four unreleased bonus tracks each. Noteworthy rarities include the outtakes &quot;Word of Mouth&quot; and &quot;The Risk&quot; from the &quot;Envoy&quot; sessions and &quot;Frozen Notes (Strings Version)&quot;, a melancholy outtake from &quot;Excitable Boy&quot; performed on acoustic piano with a string quartet.

Ammal Records was a new label started up as a partnership with New West Records by Zevon&#x27;s former boss at Artemis, Danny Goldberg. On May 1, 2007, Ammal released &quot;&quot;, a two-disc anthology of Zevon demos and alternate versions culled from 126 pre-1976 recordings that had been kept in a suitcase. The album contains five previously unreleased songs: &quot;Empty Hearted Town&quot;, &quot;Going All the Way&quot;, &quot;Steady Rain&quot;, &quot;Stop Rainin&#x27; Lord&quot; and &quot;The Rosarita Beach Cafe&quot;, along with Zevon&#x27;s original demo of &quot;Studebaker&quot;. Selections from an interview of Zevon by the Austin-based radio personality Jody Denberg are blended with about 40 minutes of music on the collection&#x27;s second disc.

&quot;The Wind&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA in December 2003, and Zevon received five posthumous Grammy nominations, including Song of the Year for the ballad &quot;Keep Me in Your Heart&quot;. &quot;The Wind&quot; won two Grammys, with the album itself receiving the award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, while &quot;Disorder in the House&quot;, Zevon&#x27;s duet with Bruce Springsteen, was awarded Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. These posthumous awards were the first Grammys of Zevon&#x27;s thirty-plus year career.

== Personal life ==
Zevon was married to Crystal, and their daughter Ariel Zevon was born in 1976. Ariel Zevon is a singer-songwriter and former café owner in Vermont. Warren Zevon and Marilyn Livingston Dillow had a son, Jordan Zevon, in 1969. Jordan Zevon is a singer, musician, and songwriter.

He was a friend of United States Representative Steve Cohen, at the time a State Senator; the two attended the 2000 Democratic National Convention together.

== Biographical works ==
&quot;I&#x27;ll Sleep When I&#x27;m Dead: The Dirty Life and Times of Warren Zevon&quot;, a biography by his ex-wife, Crystal Zevon, was published in 2007 by Ecco Books. The book is largely an oral history that consists of interviews with Zevon&#x27;s friends, relatives and associates, as well as excerpts from his diaries. Crystal Zevon said Warren had given her permission to use the journal excerpts and instructed her to present an unvarnished portrayal of his life that did not sanitize his many struggles.

George Plasketes, a professor at Auburn University, wrote a critical study of Zevon&#x27;s music in 2016, &quot;Warren Zevon, Desperado of Los Angeles&quot;. Zevon was also the subject of Michael Flood&#x27;s essay &quot;Lord Byron&#x27;s Luggage: Warren Zevon and the Redefinition of Literature Rock&quot;. A collection of short stories by Kelly Lynn Thomas, &quot;Miss Gun to a Knife Fight: Stories&quot;, is composed of retellings of songs by Zevon.

In 2012, George Gruel, a photographer who worked as Zevon&#x27;s aide-de-camp from 1978 to 1983, published a book of photos of Zevon. It is entitled &quot;Lawyers, Guns and Photos&quot;.

<text>Sugar Grove is an unincorporated community located in Watauga County, North Carolina, United States. It is named after the sugar maples that grow in the area. The community is located along US 321, west of Vilas and Boone, along the banks of Cove Creek.

==History==
Sugar Grove was founded in 1837, when John Mast opened the Sugar Grove Post Office; that year he reported a revenue of $14. During the Civil War, Company E of the 37th Confederate Regiment was organized September, 1861. Between 1864 and 1865, the home guard battalion of Watauga was stationed at Camp Mast, nearby Sugar Grove. On February 5, 1865, Camp Mast surrendered, by majority vote, after being surrounded at dawn by a battalion of around 100 Union soldiers, led by Captain James Champion, of Indiana; those who voted for surrender were quickly paroled and discharged. In 1915, the first cheese factory in the area was established in Sugar Grove (unknown when closed).

The Cove Creek High School, Ben Farthing Farm, and Ward Family House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Valle Crucis in an unincorporated community and census-designated place located in Watauga County, North Carolina, United States. The name of the town is Latin for &quot;Vale of the Cross,&quot; a reference to a valley in the area where three streams converge to form a shape similar to an archbishop&#x27;s cross. The community is located along NC 194, between the towns of Banner Elk and Boone.

==Demographics==
==History==
Before the 1840s, there has been scattered settlements in the area but not permanently until the Valle Crucis Episcopal Mission was established. Founded by Levi Silliman Ives, an Episcopal missionary, &quot;Easter Chapel&quot; served as the first Episcopal church in the area. Its successor, the Holy Cross Episcopal Church, was built in 1926 and modeled on a now-defunct medieval monastery in Wales and is noteworthy for its architecture.

==Geography and climate==
Valle Crucis is located at the banks of Dutch Creek and Watauga River, at an elevation of above sea level. To its north and east is Tester Mountain and to its south and west is Valle Mountain. The community is also within the Pisgah National Forest boundary, which limits some development in the area.

Weather ranges from warm summer days and cool summer evenings to cold or even bitterly cold winter nights. Rainfall is moderate, averaging per year. Severe storms are rare. Snowfall occurs in the winter with some accumulation to be expected several times between December and April. Snowfall averages per year. The area is also known for being one of the lowest and most quickly flooded in the region. The heart of Valle Crucis, including the bulk of the stores, the elementary school, and community park is a particularly low lying and flat in comparison to the mountainous terrain of the surrounding areas. Flooding is not an extremely rare event and can inhibit many functions of the town, such as the well known occasional flooding of the bridge on DeWitt Barnett Road, inhibiting access from that side of the town.
==Attractions==
The most notable attraction in the area is the original Mast General Store. Also located in the community is the Mast Farm, Valle Crucis Episcopal Mission and Valle Crucis Historic District, all of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Valle Crucis Community Park, established in 1983 by a nonprofit organization, is a large park with amenities including picnic shelters, children playgrounds, a paved path and access to the Watauga River for wading and fly-fishing.

<text>Warren Zevon is the second studio album by American musician Warren Zevon. This album was recorded in 1975 and released on May 18, 1976, by Asylum Records. A remastered version of the album with bonus tracks was released in 2008 by Rhino Records.

== Critical reception ==
Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;I am suspicious of singer-songwriters who draw attention to phrases like &#x27;hasten down the wind,&#x27; and I would suggest a moratorium on songs about the James Brothers that don&#x27;t also rhyme &#x27;pollution&#x27; and &#x27;solution.&#x27; But I like the way Zevon resists pigeonholes like &#x27;country-rock&#x27; while avoiding both the banal and the mystagogical, and I like quatrains like: &#x27;And if California slides into the ocean/Like the mystics and statistics say it will/I predict this motel will be standing/Until I pay my bill.&#x27;&quot;

== History ==
The region is full of medieval castles, especially along the Nahe River. Best known is the Kyrburg of Kirn, built in the 12th century and sitting in state above the river. In 1815, the district of Kreuznach was established by the Prussian government. In 1932, it was merged with the district of Meisenheim. The name of the district officially changed from Kreuznach to Bad Kreuznach in 1969.

The main axis of the district is the Nahe River, which enters the territory in the west, runs through Kirn, Bad Sobernheim and Bad Kreuznach, and leaves to the northeast.

The region formed by this district and the adjoining Birkenfeld district is known as the Naheland. The banks of the lower Nahe are used for vineyards. Away from the stream, there are sparsely populated forests crisscrossed by the narrow affluents of the Nahe River.

== Coat of arms ==

<doc id="200608" wikidata="Q213645" url="?curid=200608" title="Karl August von Hardenberg">
<text>Karl August Fürst von Hardenberg (31 May 1750, in Essenrode-Lehre – 26 November 1822, in Genoa) was a Prussian and Chief Minister of Prussia. While during his late career he acquiesced to reactionary policies, earlier in his career he implemented a variety of Liberal reforms. To him and Baron vom Stein, Prussia was indebted for improvements in its army system, the abolition of serfdom and feudal burdens, the throwing open of the civil service to all classes, and the complete reform of the educational system.

==Family==

Hardenberg was the eldest son of Christian Ludwig von Hardenberg (1700-1781), a Hanoverian colonel, later to become field marshal and commander-in-chief of the Hanoverian Army under Elector George III from 1776 until his death. His mother was Anna Sophia Ehrengart von Bülow. He was born, one of eight children, at Essenrode Manor near Hanover in the Electorate of Hanover, his maternal grandfather&#x27;s estate. The ancestral home of the &quot;knights of Hardenberg&quot; is Hardenberg Castle at Nörten-Hardenberg, which the family acquired in 1287 and owns to this day. They were created barons and, in 1778, counts.

==Early life==
After studying at Leipzig and Göttingen, he entered the Hanoverian civil service in 1770 as councillor of the board of domains (&quot;Kammerrat&quot;); but, finding his advancement slow, he set out, on the advice of George III, on a series of travels, spending some time at Wetzlar, Regensburg (where he studied the mechanism of the Imperial government), Vienna and Berlin. He also visited France, the Dutch Republic and Great Britain, where he was received kindly by the King (also Elector of Hanover). On his return, he married, at his father&#x27;s suggestion, the Countess Christiane von Reventlow (1759–1793) in 1774. They had a son, Christian Heinrich August Graf von Hardenberg-Reventlow (1775–1841), and a daughter, Lucie von Hardenberg-Reventlow (1776-1854).

In 1778, Hardenberg was raised to the rank of privy councillor and created a graf (or count). He went back to England in the hope of obtaining the post of Hanoverian envoy in London; but his wife began an affair with the Prince of Wales, which created so great a scandal that he was forced to leave the Hanoverian service. In 1782 he entered the service of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick, and as president of the board of domains displayed a zeal for reform, in the manner approved by the enlightened despots of the century, which rendered him very unpopular with the orthodox clergy and the conservative estates. In Brunswick, too, his position was in the end made untenable by the conduct of his wife, whom he now divorced. He shortly afterwards married a divorced woman.

==Administrator of Ansbach and Bayreuth==
Fortunately for Hardenberg, this coincided with the lapsing of the principalities of Ansbach and Bayreuth to Prussia, owing to the abdication of the last margrave, Charles Alexander, in 1791. Hardenberg, who happened to be in Berlin at the time, was appointed administrator of the principalities in 1792, on the recommendation of Ewald Friedrich von Hertzberg. The position, owing to the singular overlapping of territorial claims in the old Holy Roman Empire, was one of considerable delicacy, and Hardenberg filled it with great skill, doing much to reform traditional anomalies and to develop the country, and at the same time labouring to expand the influence of Prussia in southern Germany.

==Prussian envoy==
After the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, his diplomatic ability led to his appointment as Prussian envoy, with a roving commission to visit the Rhenish courts and win them over to Prussia&#x27;s views. Ultimately, when the necessity for making peace with the French Republic had been recognised, he was appointed to succeed Count August Friedrich Ferdinand von der Goltz as Prussian plenipotentiary at Basel (28 February 1795), where he signed the treaty of peace.

==Prussian cabinet==
In 1797, on the accession of King Frederick William III of Prussia, Hardenberg was summoned to Berlin, where he received an important position in the cabinet and was appointed chief of the departments of Magdeburg and Halberstadt, for Westphalia, and for the Principality of Neuchâtel. In 1793, Hardenberg had struck up a friendship with Christian Graf von Haugwitz, the influential minister for foreign affairs, and when in late 1803 Haugwitz went away on leave he appointed Hardenberg his &quot;locum tenens&quot;.

It was a critical period since Napoleon had just occupied Hanover, and Haugwitz had urged upon the king the necessity for strong measures and the expediency of a Russian alliance. During Haugwitz&#x27;s absence, however, the king&#x27;s irresolution continued, and he clung to the policy of neutrality, which had so far seemed to have served Prussia so well. Hardenberg contented himself with adapting himself to the royal will. When Haugwitz had returned, the unyielding attitude of Napoleon had caused the king to make advances to Russia, but the mutual declarations of 3 and 25 May 1804 pledged both powers to take up arms only in the event of a French attack upon Prussia or of further aggressions in northern Germany. Finally, Haugwitz, unable to persuade the cabinet to a more vigorous policy, resigned, and on 14 April 1804, Hardenberg succeeded him as foreign minister.

==Prussian foreign minister==
If there was to be war, Hardenberg would have preferred the French alliance, the price that Napoleon demanded for the cession of Hanover to Prussia, but the eastern powers would not freely have conceded so great an augmentation of Prussian power. However, he still hoped to gain the coveted prize by diplomacy, backed by the veiled threat of an armed neutrality. Then came Napoleon&#x27;s contemptuous violation of Prussian territory by marching three French corps through Ansbach. King Frederick William&#x27;s pride overcame his weakness, and on 3 November he signed with Tsar Alexander I of Russia the terms of an ultimatum to be laid before the French emperor.

Haugwitz was despatched to Vienna with the document, but before he had arrived, the Battle of Austerlitz had been fought, and the Prussian plenipotentiary had to make terms with Napoleon. Prussia, by the treaty signed at Schönbrunn on 15 December 1805, received Hanover but in return for all her territories in South Germany. One condition of the arrangement was the retirement of Hardenberg, whom Napoleon disliked. He was again foreign minister for a few months after the crisis of 1806 (April–July 1807), but Napoleon&#x27;s resentment was implacable, and one of the conditions of the terms granted to Prussia by the Treaty of Tilsit was Hardenberg&#x27;s dismissal.

==Prussian chancellor==
After the forced retirement of Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein in 1810 and the unsatisfactory interlude of the feeble Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein ministry, Hardenberg was again summoned to Berlin on 6 June 1810, this time as chancellor. The Battle of Jena–Auerstedt and its consequences had had a profound effect upon him, and in his mind, the traditions of the old diplomacy had given place to the new sentiment of nationality characteristic of the coming age, which in him found expression in a passionate desire to restore the position of Prussia and crush her oppressors.

During his retirement at Riga, he had worked out an elaborate plan for reconstructing the monarchy on liberal lines, and when he came into power, the circumstances of the time did not admit of his pursuing an independent foreign policy, but he steadily prepared for the struggle with France by carrying out Stein&#x27;s far-reaching schemes of social and political reorganization.

===Reforms===
The military system was completely reformed, serfdom was abolished, municipal institutions were fostered, the civil service was thrown open to all classes and great attention was devoted to the educational needs of every section of the community. When at last the time came to put the reforms to the test, after the French invasion of Russia in 1812, it was Hardenberg who persuaded Frederick William to take advantage of Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg&#x27;s loyal disloyalty and to declare against France. He was rightly regarded by German patriots as the statesman who had done most to encourage the spirit of national independence, and immediately after he had signed the first Peace of Paris in 1814, he was raised to the rank of prince 3 June 1814 in recognition of the part he had played in the War of the Sixth Coalition.

===Metternich&#x27;s shadow===

Hardenberg now had a position in that close corporation of sovereigns and statesmen by whom Europe was governed. He accompanied the allied sovereigns to England and at the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) was the chief representative of Prussia. However, the zenith of his influence, if not of his fame, had passed. In diplomacy, he was no match for Klemens von Metternich, whose influence soon overshadowed his own in the councils of Europe, Germany and ultimately even Prussia itself.

At Vienna, in spite of the powerful backing of Alexander I of Russia, he failed to secure the annexation of the whole of Saxony to Prussia. In the Second Treaty of Paris, after the Battle of Waterloo, he failed to carry through his views as to the further dismemberment of France and had weakly allowed Metternich to forestall him in making terms with the states of the Confederation of the Rhine, which secured to Austria the preponderance in the German federal diet. On the eve of the conference of Carlsbad (1819) he signed a convention with Metternich in which, according the historian Heinrich von Treitschke, &#x27;like a penitent sinner, without any formal quid pro quo, the monarchy of Frederick the Great yielded to a foreign power a voice in her internal affairs.&quot;

At the congresses of Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen), Troppau, Laibach and Verona, the voice of Hardenberg was but an echo of that of Metternich. The cause lay partly in the difficult circumstances of the loosely-knit Prussian monarchy but partly in Hardenberg&#x27;s character had never been well balanced but had deteriorated with age. He continued amiable, charming and enlightened as ever, but the excesses that had been pardonable in a young diplomat were a scandal in an elderly chancellor and could not but weaken his influence with so pious a &quot;Landesvater&quot; as Frederick William III.

To overcome the king&#x27;s terror of liberal experiments would have needed all the powers of an adviser at once wise and in character wholly trustworthy. Hardenberg was wise enough and saw the necessity for constitutional reform, but he clung with almost senile tenacity to the sweets of office, and when the tide turned against liberalism, he allowed himself to drift with it. In the privacy of royal commissions, he continued to elaborate schemes for constitutions that never saw the light, but Germany, disillusioned, regarded him as an adherent of Metternich, an accomplice in the policy of the Carlsbad Decrees and the Troppau Protocol.
In 1814, King Frederick William III vested Hardenberg with the locality of Quilitz, together with the princely title, as a gratification for his merits as Prussian state chancellor. When he received the manor, he renamed the place right away into &quot;Neuhardenberg (New Hardenberg)&quot;. From 1820 on, he had the mansion and the church rebuilt in neoclassical style, according to plans designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, while the gardens were redesigned by his son-in-law, Prince Hermann von Pückler-Muskau, and Peter-Joseph Lenné.

Hardenberg died at Genoa soon after the closing of the Congress of Verona. Hardenberg&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs, 1801-07&quot; were suppressed for 50 years after which they were edited with a biography by Leopold von Ranke and published as &quot;Denkwürdigkeiten des Fürsten von Hardenberg&quot; (5 vols., Leipzig, 1877).

<text>Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald () is a (district) in the southwest of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Fifty towns and municipalities with 133 settlements lie within the district. The district itself belongs to the region of Freiburg with the region of Southern Upper Rhine.

The municipal offices are in the city of Freiburg im Breisgau which is almost entirely surrounded by Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, but is independent of it. In addition, the council has three satellite offices in Müllheim, Titisee-Neustadt and Breisach am Rhein.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald covers areas which are very different in scenic character: in the Upper Rhine Plain are the Markgräflerland and its foothill zone, which is continued north of the Breisgau with the hills of Kaiserstuhl, the Tuniberg and the Nimberg.

Within the district, the Black Forest covers the side valleys opening onto the Rhine Plain - the Glottertal, the valley of the Dreisam, the Höllental and the Münstertal - the High Black Forest with its highest peak, the Feldberg (1493 m), and extends as far as the plateau of Baar.

In the centre of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald lies the territory of the city of Freiburg, which is almost entirely surrounded by Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald. Only on its northern side is there a 3-kilometre-long boundary with the municipality of Vörstetten and the district of Emmendingen.

=== Neighbouring counties ===
The neighbouring counties are Emmendingen, Schwarzwald-Baar, Waldshut, Lörrach and the French of the Haut-Rhin and the Bas-Rhin. The independent city of Freiburg is surrounded by the district. The district is named after the Breisgau, a historical territory, and the High Black Forest ().

=== Climate ===
The climate in Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald is very varied. Between Ihringen, the place with the highest annual average temperature in Germany, and the summit of the Feldberg, both the warmest and the coldest places in Baden-Württemberg lie in Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald. Climatically, the district is one of the warmest regions in Germany: its mean annual temperature in the Rhine valley is , its average rainfall is approximately , and it has about 1,800 hours of sunshine annually. Moreover, the highest temperature ever measured in Germany, , was recorded on 13 August 2003 in the municipality of March. March shares this record with Gärmersdorf near Amberg, Freiburg and Karlsruhe.

==History==
The County of Breisgau () and County of Baar () were formed on the territory of the present district in the 8th century. Both counties belonged to the Duchy of Alemannia. The eastern part, the upper reaches of the Danube and Neckar, came under the Carolingian dominion of the Ahalolfings. Following the disintegration of the Frankish Empire in 843, the area became part of East Francia and part of it, from 920, the Duchy of Swabia. In 1368, the Breisgau went into the hands of the House of Habsburg (see Anterior Austria). The Swabian princes of Fürstenberg dominated the Baar, while the area south of Freiburg, the Markgräflerland, ended up with the margraves of Baden. In 1805/06, after the end of the Napoleonic wars, the region became part of the Grand Duchy of Baden.

The district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald was established as part of the district reform of Baden-Württemberg on 1 Jan 1973, mainly from the former rural districts of Freiburg, Müllheim and Hochschwarzwald (with its head office in Neustadt in the Black Forest). In addition, the municipality of Unadingen from the district of Donaueschingen was incorporated. Other municipalities were integrated into the city of Freiburg. The southern part of the district of Müllheim went to Lörrach and some municipalities were transferred from the old district of Hochschwarzwald to Waldshut.

Later, more municipalities were incorporated into the city of Freiburg: Munzingen on 1 July 1973, Hochdorf on 1 September 1973 and Ebnet and Kappel on 1 July 1974. On 1 September 1973, the municipality of Schönenbach, which belonged to the district of Waldshut, was added. On 1 January 1974 Kiechlinsbergen was ceded to Emmendingen. On 1 April 1974 Leiselheim followed. On 18 March 1975 Grünwald was added from the district of Waldshut was added (moving from Bonndorf im Schwarzwald to Lenzkirch).

The three old districts were formed in 1939 from the of the same name that had been established in the early nineteenth century when large numbers of them were formed as the area became part of Baden. In the course of the history the were changed several times, until in 1936 only those of Freiburg, Müllheim, Neustadt im Schwarzwald and Staufen were left. Staufen was divided between Freiburg and Müllheim. The district of Neustadt, founded in 1939, was renamed Hochschwarzwald in 1956.

Following the completion of the municipal form, the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald comprised 50 municipalities, including ten towns. There are no large county towns. The largest town is Müllheim, the smallest municipality is Heuweiler. The most recent town is Bad Krozingen (from 1 September 2005).

== Population growth ==
The population figures are based on censuses (1987) or official updates by the Baden-Württemberg State Office of Statistics (only main residences).
== Economy ==
The economy is based on tourism, wine, and forestry.

==Politics==
Politically, the majority of the district parliament () is traditionally conservative (CDU), with higher levels of conservative votes the farther the distance from Freiburg (which has a green-red majority).

== Coat of arms ==
The left half of the coat of arms show the colors of Austria, and the right side the colors of Baden, as parts of the District belonged to both states at various times. In the middle, the coat of arms shows an eagle, taken from the coat of arms of the Princes of Fürstenberg. The coat of arms was granted in 1974, and it is very similar to the coat of arms of the previous Freiburg district.

<doc id="200612" wikidata="Q2080202" url="?curid=200612" title="Automotive aerodynamics">
<text>Automotive aerodynamics is the study of the aerodynamics of road vehicles. Its main goals are reducing drag and wind noise, minimizing noise emission, and preventing undesired lift forces and other causes of aerodynamic instability at high speeds. Air is also considered a fluid in this case. For some classes of racing vehicles, it may also be important to produce downforce to improve traction and thus cornering abilities.

==History==

The frictional force of aerodynamic drag increases significantly with vehicle speed. As early as the 1920s engineers began to consider automobile shape in reducing aerodynamic drag at higher speeds. By the 1950s German and British automotive engineers were systematically analyzing the effects of automotive drag for the higher performance vehicles. By the late 1960s scientists also became aware of the significant increase in sound levels emitted by automobiles at high speed. These effects were understood to increase the intensity of sound levels for adjacent land uses at a non-linear rate. Soon highway engineers began to design roadways to consider the speed effects of aerodynamic drag produced sound levels, and automobile manufacturers considered the same factors in vehicle design.

== Strategies for reducing drag ==
The deletion of parts on a vehicle is an easy way for designers and vehicle owners to reduce parasitic and frontal drag of the vehicle with little cost and effort. Deletion can be as simple as removing an aftermarket part, or part that has been installed on the vehicle after production, or having to modify and remove an OEM part, meaning any part of the vehicle that was originally manufactured on the vehicle. Most production sports cars and high efficiency vehicles come standard with many of these deletions in order to be competitive in the automotive and race market, while others choose to keep these drag-increasing aspects of the vehicle for their visual aspects, or to fit the typical uses of their customer base.

=== Spoilers ===
A rear spoiler usually comes standard in most sports vehicles and resembles the shape of a raised wing in the rear of the vehicle. The main purpose of a rear spoiler in a vehicle&#x27;s design is to counteract lift, thereby increasing stability at higher speeds. In order to achieve the lowest possible drag, air must flow around the streamlined body of the vehicle without coming into contact with any areas of possible turbulence. A rear spoiler design that stands off the rear deck lid will increase downforce, reducing lift at high speeds while incurring a drag penalty. Flat spoilers, possibly angled slightly downward may reduce turbulence and thereby reduce the coefficient of drag. Some cars now feature automatically adjustable rear spoilers, so at lower speed the effect on drag is reduced when the benefits of reduced lift are not required.

=== Mirrors ===
Side mirrors both increase the frontal area of the vehicle and increase the coefficient of drag since they protrude from the side of the vehicle. In order to decrease the impact that side mirrors have on the drag of the vehicle the side mirrors can be replaced with smaller mirrors or mirrors with a different shape. Several concept cars of the 2010s are replacing mirrors with tiny cameras but this option is not common for production cars because most countries require side mirrors. One of the first production passenger automobiles to swap out mirrors for cameras was the Honda e, and in this case the cameras are claimed by Honda to have decreased aerodynamic drag by &quot;around 90% compared to conventional door mirrors&quot; which contributed to an approximately 3.8% reduction in drag for the entire vehicle. It is estimated that two side mirrors are responsible for 2 to 7% of the total aerodynamic drag of a motor vehicle, and that removing them could improve fuel economy by 1.5–2 miles per US gallon.

=== Radio antennas ===
While they do not have the biggest impact on the drag coefficient due to their small size, radio antennas commonly found protruding from the front of the vehicle can be relocated and changed in design to rid the car of this added drag. The most common replacement for the standard car antenna is the shark fin antenna found in most high efficiency vehicles.

=== Wheels ===

When air flows around the wheel wells it gets disturbed by the rims of the vehicles and forms an area of turbulence around the wheel. In order for the air to flow more smoothly around the wheel well, smooth wheel covers are often applied. Smooth wheel covers are hub caps with no holes in them for air to pass through. This design reduces drag; however, it may cause the brakes to heat up more quickly because the covers prevent airflow around the brake system. As a result, this modification is more commonly seen in high efficiency vehicles rather than sports cars or racing vehicles.

=== Air curtains ===

Air curtains divert air flow from slots in the body and guide it towards the outside edges of the wheel wells.

=== Partial grille blocks ===
The front grille of a vehicle is used to direct air through the radiator. In a streamlined design the air flows around the vehicle rather than through; however, the grille of a vehicle redirects airflow from around the vehicle to through the vehicle, which then increases the drag. In order to reduce this impact a grille block is often used. A grille block covers up a portion of, or the entirety of, the front grille of a vehicle. In most high efficiency models or in vehicles with low drag coefficients, a very small grille will already be built into the vehicle&#x27;s design, eliminating the need for a grille block. The grille in most production vehicles is generally designed to maximize air flow through the radiator where it exits into the engine compartment. This design can actually create too much airflow into the engine compartment, preventing it from warming up in a timely manner, and in such cases a grille block is used to increase engine performance and reduce vehicle drag simultaneously.

=== Under trays ===
The underside of a vehicle often traps air in various places and adds turbulence around the vehicle. In most racing vehicles this is eliminated by covering the entire underside of the vehicle in what is called an under tray. This tray prevents any air from becoming trapped under the vehicle and reduces drag.

=== Fender skirts ===
Fender skirts are often made as extensions of the body panels of the vehicles and cover the entire wheel wells. Much like smooth wheel covers this modification reduces the drag of the vehicle by preventing any air from becoming trapped in the wheel well and assists in streamlining the body of the vehicle. Fender skirts are more commonly found on the rear wheel wells of a vehicle because the rear tires do not pivot when steering. This is commonly seen in vehicles such as the first generation Honda Insight. Front fender skirts have the same effect on reducing drag as the rear wheel skirts, but must be further offset from the body in order to compensate for the tire sticking out from the body of the vehicle as turns are made.

=== Boattails and Kammbacks ===
A boattail can greatly reduce a vehicle&#x27;s total drag. Boattails create a teardrop shape that will give the vehicle a more streamlined profile, reducing the occurrence of drag inducing flow separation. A kammback is a truncated boattail. It is created as an extension of the rear of the vehicle, moving the rear backward at a slight angle toward the bumper of the car. This can reduce drag as well but a boattail would reduce the vehicle&#x27;s drag more. Nonetheless, for practical and style reasons, a kammback is more commonly seen in racing, high efficiency vehicles, and trucking.

==Comparison with aircraft aerodynamics==
Automotive aerodynamics differs from aircraft aerodynamics in several ways:
* The characteristic shape of a road vehicle is much less streamlined compared to an aircraft.
* The vehicle operates very close to the ground, rather than in free air.
* The operating speeds are lower (and aerodynamic drag varies as the square of speed).
* A ground vehicle has fewer degrees of freedom than an aircraft, and its motion is less affected by aerodynamic forces.
* Passenger and commercial ground vehicles have very specific design constraints such as their intended purpose, high safety standards (requiring, for example, more &#x27;dead&#x27; structural space to act as crumple zones), and certain regulations.

==Methods of studying aerodynamics==

Automotive aerodynamics is studied using both computer modelling and wind tunnel testing. For the most accurate results from a wind tunnel test, the tunnel is sometimes equipped with a rolling road. This is a movable floor for the working section, which moves at the same speed as the air flow. This prevents a boundary layer from forming on the floor of the working section and affecting the results.

== Downforce ==

Downforce describes the downward pressure created by the aerodynamic characteristics of a car that allows it to travel faster through a corner by holding the car to the track or road surface. Some elements to increase vehicle downforce will also increase drag.
It is very important to produce a good downward aerodynamic force because it affects the car&#x27;s speed and traction.

<doc id="200614" wikidata="Q548265" url="?curid=200614" title="Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants">
<text>Liebeck v. McDonald&#x27;s Restaurants, also known as the McDonald&#x27;s coffee case and the hot coffee lawsuit, was a highly publicized 1994 product liability lawsuit in the United States against the McDonald&#x27;s restaurant chain.

The plaintiff, Stella Liebeck (1912–2004), a 79-year-old woman, purchased hot coffee from a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant, accidentally spilled it in her lap, and suffered third-degree burns in her pelvic region. She was hospitalized for eight days while undergoing skin grafting, followed by two years of medical treatment. Liebeck sought to settle with McDonald&#x27;s for $20,000 to cover her medical expenses. When McDonald&#x27;s refused, Liebeck&#x27;s attorney filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico, accusing McDonald&#x27;s of gross negligence.

Liebeck&#x27;s attorneys argued that, at , McDonald&#x27;s coffee was defective, and more likely to cause serious injury than coffee served at any other establishment. The jury found that McDonald&#x27;s was 80 percent responsible for the incident. They awarded Liebeck a net $160,000 in compensatory damages to cover medical expenses, and $2.7 million () in punitive damages, the equivalent of two days of McDonald&#x27;s coffee sales. The trial judge reduced the punitive damages to three times the amount of the compensatory damages, totalling $640,000. The parties settled for a confidential amount before an appeal was decided.

The Liebeck case became a flashpoint in the debate in the United States over tort reform. It was cited by some as an example of frivolous litigation; ABC News called the case &quot;the poster child of excessive lawsuits&quot;, while the legal scholar Jonathan Turley argued that the claim was &quot;a meaningful and worthy lawsuit&quot;. Ex-attorney Susan Saladoff sees the portrayal in the media as purposeful misrepresentation due to political and corporate influence. In June 2011, HBO premiered &quot;Hot Coffee&quot;, a documentary that discussed in depth how the &quot;Liebeck&quot; case has centered in debates on tort reform.

==Burn incident==
Stella May Liebeck was born in Norwich, England, on December 14, 1912. She was 79 at the time of the burn incident. On February 27, 1992, Liebeck ordered a 49-cent cup of coffee from the drive-through window of a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant at 5001 Gibson Boulevard Southeast in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Liebeck was in the passenger&#x27;s seat of a 1989 Ford Probe, which did not have cup holders. Her grandson parked so that Liebeck could add cream and sugar to her coffee. She placed the coffee cup between her knees and pulled the far side of the lid toward her to remove it. In the process, she spilled the entire cup of coffee on her lap. Liebeck was wearing cotton sweatpants, which absorbed the coffee and held it against her skin, scalding her thighs, buttocks and groin.

Liebeck went into shock and was taken to an emergency room at a hospital. She suffered third-degree burns on six percent of her skin and lesser burns over sixteen percent. She remained in the hospital for eight days while she underwent skin grafting. During this period, Liebeck lost , nearly 20 percent of her body weight, reducing her to . After the hospital stay, Liebeck needed care for three weeks, which was provided by her daughter. Liebeck suffered permanent disfigurement after the incident and was partially disabled for two years.

=== Attempts to settle ===
Liebeck sought to settle with McDonald&#x27;s for $20,000 to cover her actual and anticipated expenses. Her past medical expenses were $10,500; her anticipated future medical expenses were approximately $2,500; and her daughter&#x27;s loss of income was approximately $5,000 for a total of approximately $18,000. McDonald&#x27;s offered only $800.

When McDonald&#x27;s refused to raise its offer, Liebeck retained the Texas attorney Reed Morgan. Morgan filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico, accusing McDonald&#x27;s of gross negligence for selling coffee that was &quot;unreasonably dangerous&quot; and &quot;defectively manufactured&quot;. Morgan offered to settle for $300,000, and a mediator suggested $225,000 just before trial; McDonald&#x27;s refused both.

==Trial==
The Liebeck case trial took place from August 8 to 17, 1994, before New Mexico District Court Judge Robert H. Scott. During the case, Liebeck&#x27;s attorneys discovered that McDonald&#x27;s required franchisees to hold coffee at . Liebeck&#x27;s attorneys argued that coffee should never be served hotter than , and that a number of other establishments served coffee at a substantially lower temperature than McDonald&#x27;s. The attorneys presented evidence that coffee they had tested all over the city was served at a temperature at least 20 °F (11 °C) lower than McDonald&#x27;s coffee. They also presented the jury with expert testimony that coffee may produce third-degree burns (where skin grafting is necessary) in about three seconds and coffee may produce such burns in about twelve to fifteen seconds. Lowering the temperature to would increase the time for the coffee to produce such a burn to 20 seconds. Liebeck&#x27;s attorneys argued that these extra seconds could provide adequate time to remove the coffee from exposed skin, thereby preventing many burns.

McDonald&#x27;s claimed that the reason for serving such hot coffee in its drive-through windows was that those who purchased the coffee typically were commuters who wanted to drive a distance with the coffee; the high initial temperature would keep the coffee hot during the trip. However, it came to light that McDonald&#x27;s had carried out research finding that customers intend to consume the coffee immediately while driving.
Another of McDonald&#x27;s reasons for serving such hot coffee is advice from consultants that high temperatures are necessary in brewing to fully extract the flavor.

Other documents obtained from McDonald&#x27;s showed that from 1982 to 1992 the company had received more than 700 reports of people burned by McDonald&#x27;s coffee to varying degrees of severity, and had settled claims arising from scalding injuries for more than $500,000. McDonald&#x27;s quality control manager, Christopher Appleton, testified that this number of injuries was insufficient to cause the company to evaluate its practices. He argued that all foods hotter than constituted a burn hazard, and that restaurants had more pressing dangers to worry about. The plaintiffs argued that Appleton conceded that McDonald&#x27;s coffee would burn the mouth and throat if consumed when served.

=== Verdict ===
A twelve-person jury reached its verdict on August 18, 1994. Applying the principles of comparative negligence, the jury found that McDonald&#x27;s was 80 percent responsible for the incident and Liebeck was 20 percent at fault. Though there was a warning on the coffee cup, the jury decided that the warning was neither large enough nor sufficient. They awarded Liebeck $200,000 in compensatory damages, which was reduced by 20 percent to $160,000. In addition, they awarded her $2.7 million in punitive damages. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the jurors arrived at this figure from Morgan&#x27;s suggestion to penalize McDonald&#x27;s for two days of coffee revenues, about $1.35 million per day.

The judge reduced punitive damages to $480,000, three times the compensatory amount, for a total of $640,000. The decision was appealed by both McDonald&#x27;s and Liebeck in December 1994, but the parties settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. The &quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot; ran the first story of the verdict, followed by the Associated Press wire, which was picked up by newspapers around the world.

==Aftermath==
The Liebeck case is often cited in a misleading manner by proponents of tort reform, who present an inaccurate or incomplete summary of the facts in order to falsely frame the case as frivolous litigation. ABC News called the case &quot;the poster child of excessive lawsuits&quot;. Legal commentator Jonathan Turley called it &quot;a meaningful and worthy lawsuit&quot;. McDonald&#x27;s asserts that the outcome of the case was a fluke, and attributed the loss to poor communications and strategy by an unfamiliar insurer representing a franchise. Liebeck&#x27;s attorney, Reed Morgan, and the Association of Trial Lawyers of America defended the result in &quot;Liebeck&quot; by claiming that McDonald&#x27;s reduced the temperature of its coffee after the suit, although McDonald&#x27;s in fact had not done so.

Detractors have argued that McDonald&#x27;s refusal to offer more than an $800 settlement for the $10,500 in medical bills indicated that the suit was meritless and highlighted the fact that Liebeck spilled the coffee on herself rather than any wrongdoing on the company&#x27;s part. They state that the vast majority of judges who consider similar cases dismiss them before they get to a jury.

Liebeck died on August 5, 2004, at age 91. According to her daughter, &quot;the burns and court proceedings (had taken) their toll&quot; and in the years following the settlement Liebeck had &quot;no quality of life&quot;. She said the settlement had paid for a live-in nurse.

===Similar lawsuits===
In &quot;McMahon v. Bunn Matic Corporation&quot; (1998), Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote a unanimous opinion affirming dismissal of a similar lawsuit against coffeemaker manufacturer Bunn-O-Matic, finding that hot coffee was not &quot;unreasonably dangerous&quot;.

In &quot;Bogle v. McDonald&#x27;s Restaurants Ltd.&quot; (2002), a similar lawsuit in the United Kingdom failed when the court rejected the claim that McDonald&#x27;s could have avoided injury by serving coffee at a lower temperature.

Since &quot;Liebeck&quot;, major vendors of coffee, including Chick-Fil-A, Starbucks, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts, Wendy&#x27;s, Burger King, hospitals, and McDonald&#x27;s have been defendants in similar lawsuits over coffee-related burns. There have also been lawsuits over injuries from other hot liquids.

Two years prior to &quot;Liebeck&quot;, a similar lawsuit was settled during the trial for $15 million due to injuries from a sink in a rented apartment.

Another lawsuit involving McDonald&#x27;s was heard in Florida with the restaurant sued after a four-year-old girl suffered second-degree burns after a chicken nugget from a Happy Meal fell in between her leg and the seatbelt. McDonald&#x27;s was found liable for negligence in the case and in July 2023 the girl, then eight years-old, was awarded $800,000 in damages.

===Coffee temperature===
According to a 2007 report, McDonald&#x27;s had not reduced the temperature of its coffee, serving it at , relying on more sternly worded warnings on cups made of rigid foam to avoid future injury and liability (though it continues to face lawsuits over hot coffee). However, in 2013, &quot;the New York Times&quot; reported that McDonald&#x27;s had lowered its service temperature to . The Specialty Coffee Association of America supports improved packaging methods rather than lowering the temperature at which coffee is served. The association has successfully aided the defense of subsequent coffee burn cases. Similarly, as of 2004, Starbucks sells coffee at , and the executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America reported that the standard serving temperature is .

===&quot;Hot Coffee&quot; documentary===

On June 27, 2011, HBO premiered a documentary about tort reform problems, &quot;Hot Coffee&quot;. A large portion of the film covered Liebeck&#x27;s lawsuit. This included news clips, comments from celebrities and politicians about the case, as well as myths and misconceptions, including how many people thought she was driving when the incident occurred and thought that she suffered only minor superficial burns.

===&quot;The New York Times&quot; Retro Report===
On October 21, 2013, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a Retro Report video about the media reaction and an accompanying article about the changes in coffee drinking over 20 years. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted how the details of Liebeck&#x27;s story lost length and context as it was reported worldwide, and that McDonald&#x27;s, rather than Liebeck, was portrayed as the victim. Within a month, the Retro Report video had more than one million views and had triggered debate in the online comments.

<text>Christian August Lobeck (; 5 June 1781 – 25 August 1860) was a German classical scholar.

Lobeck was born at Naumburg, in the Electorate of Saxony. After studying at the universities of Jena and Leipzig, he became &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at the University of Wittenberg in 1802, and in 1810 was appointed to a professorship there. Four years later, he accepted the chair of rhetoric and ancient literature at Königsberg, which he occupied till within two years of his death.

His literary activities were devoted to the history of Greek religion and to the Greek language and literature. His most important work, &quot;Aglaophamus&quot; (1829), maintains, against the views put forward by G. F. Creuzer in his &quot;Symbolik&quot; (1810–1823), that the religion of the Greek mysteries (especially those of Eleusis) did not essentially differ from the national religion; that it was not esoteric, and that the priests as such neither taught nor possessed any higher knowledge of God; that the Oriental elements were a later importation. In his treatment of Orphic literature, he argued that the evidence left by the Neoplatonists cannot necessarily be considered to &quot;represent the oldest strands of Orphic ideas&quot;. According to Radcliffe Edmonds, it is with Lobeck&#x27;s work that the &quot;history of modern Orphic scholarship begins&quot;.

Lobeck&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Ajax&quot; of Sophocles (1809) had gained him a reputation a scholar and critic; his &quot;Phrynichus&quot; (1820), &quot;Paralipomena grammaticae Graecae&quot; (vol. I–II; 1837), &quot;Pathologiae sermonis Graeci prolegomena&quot; (1843), and &quot;Pathologiae Graeci sermonis elementa&quot; (vol. I–II; 1853–62) reveal his wide acquaintance with Greek grammar. He had little sympathy with comparative philology, holding that it needed a lifetime to acquire a thorough knowledge of a single language.

Friedländer in &quot;Allgemeine deutsche Biographie&quot;; Conrad Bursian&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte der klassischen Philologie in Deutschland&quot; (1883); Lehrs, &quot;Populäre Aufsätze aus dem Altertum&quot; (2nd ed., Leipzig, 1875); Lüdwich, &quot;Ausgewählte Briefe von und an Chr.

<text>The Hunsrück () is a long, triangular, pronounced upland in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is bounded by the valleys of the Moselle-Saar (north-to-west), the Nahe (south), and the Rhine (east). It is continued by the Taunus mountains, past the Rhine and by the Eifel past the Moselle. To the south of the Nahe is a lower, hilly country forming the near bulk of the Palatinate region and all of the, smaller, Saarland. Below its north-east corner is Koblenz.

As the Hunsrück proceeds east it acquires north-south width and three notable gaps in its southern ridges. In this zone are multi-branch headwaters including the Simmerbach ending at Simmertal on the southern edge. This interior is therefore rarely higher than above sea level. Peaks and escarpments are principally: the (Black Forest) Hochwald, the Idar Forest, the Soonwald, and the Bingen Forest. The highest mountain is the Erbeskopf (816 m; 2,677 ft), towards the region&#x27;s south-west.

Notable towns are Simmern, Kirchberg, and Idar-Oberstein, Kastellaun, and Morbach. Frankfurt-Hahn Airport is at the centre of the upland, equidistant between Mainz, Trier and Koblenz, co-named after the village of Hahn. 

Slate is still mined in the mountains. Since 2010, the region has become one of Germany&#x27;s major onshore wind power regions. Large wind farms are near Ellern and Kirchberg. Nature-based tourism is widespread. In 2015, a new national park was inaugurated. The pedestrian Geierlay suspension bridge opened in the same year. The climate sees mists that rise most mornings. More rain than the German average is caused by a combination of an oceanic influence and relief precipitation.

Culturally, the region is best known for its Hunsrückisch dialect and through depictions in the &quot;Heimat&quot; film series. The region saw great emigration in the mid-19th century, particularly to Brazil.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The heart of the Hunsrück is formed by the Hunsrück Plateau and the Simmern Bowl. In the northwest the Hunsrück is bounded by the Moselle river and in the east by the Rhine. Its northeasternmost tip is thus formed by the Deutsches Eck. The Nahe – on the edge of the Bingen Forest, the Soonwald and the Lützelsoon – borders the mountains to the south. The Lower Naheland is not part of the Hunsrück, but belongs to the Upper Rhine Plain. The Idar Forest, the Hochwald and the Wildenburger Kopf adjoin the Hunsrück to the southwest. Here the Upper Nahe Hills rise in the shadow of the Hunsrück. The Osburger Hochwald, Schwarzwälder Hochwald and the rivers Saar and Ruwer form the western perimeter. Its southern continuation is formed by the Westrich and the North Palatine Uplands.

The low mountain range is around 100 km long (SW to NE) and an average of 25 to 30 km wide (NW to SE). Its perimeter is a heavily incised peneplain with elongated ridges in the south (the &quot;Hochwald&quot;, &quot;Idar Forest&quot;, &quot;Soonwald&quot; and &quot;Bingen Forest&quot;). The range, which begins at the Saar in the southwest and, with breaks, reaches as far as the Rhine, climbs to its highest point in the Hochwald at the Erbeskopf (816.32 m), the highest peak in the Hunsrück and in the Rhenish Massif west of the Rhine. It continues to the NE as the Idar Forest with its highest peaks, An den zwei Steinen (766.2 m) and the Idarkopf (745.7 m). Its northeasternmost part is formed by the Soonwald (highest mountain: the Ellerspring, 656.8 m), the Lützelsoon (Womrather Höhe, 599.1 m) and the Bingen Forest (Kandrich, 638.6 m). All these ranges form an almost unbroken belt of forest. – To the east of the Rhine the crest of the Hunsrück is continued by the Taunus.

Geomorphologically the Hunsrück bears great similarities to the Eifel, the Taunus and the Westerwald, which are also part of the Rhenish Massif.

The Hunsrück hill road runs from west to east from Saarburg to Koblenz. A Roman military road, the so-called Via Ausonia also once ran through the mountains in an east-west direction and linked Trier with Bingen.

In many primary schools in the Hunsrück children are taught the boundaries of the Hunsrück using the following rhyme: &quot;Mosel, Nahe, Saar und Rhein schließen unsern Hunsrück ein.&quot; (&quot;Moselle, Nahe, Saar and Rhine enclose our Hunsrück&quot;)

=== Mountains and hills ===

The following table lists the highest mountains and hills of the Hunsrück by sub-range (Osburger and Schwarzwälder Hochwald, Idar Forest, Haardt Forest, Soonwald, Bingen Forest and Lützelsoon) and height in metres above sea level (NN):

== Flora and fauna ==
Despite, in places, intensive agricultural or timber use, the Hunsrück remains a landscape with a biodiversity, because many elements of the landscape can only be extensively utilised or even not used at all.

=== Flora ===
The plant world of the Hunsrück is rich and varied. In the Soonwald there are over 850 species of ferns and flowers. The traditional forest monocultures are increasingly giving way, especially as a result of windthrow damage, to mixed woods, supporting a greater variety of plant species.

=== Fauna ===
Although the Hunsrück is not classified as a bird reserve, it is home to a wide variety of bird species: woodpeckers, birds of prey and song birds may be seen at all times of the year. Even the rare and shy black stork nests in the forests. The Hunsrück is rich in mammals; red deer, roe deer and wild boar are intensively hunted. Larger predators include a few examples of European wildcat or even the Eurasian lynx. Red fox, European badgers and pine martens are more commonly encountered.

The best known mammal in the Hunsrück has become the barbastelle. It achieved notoriety when the presence of this rare species of bat delayed construction on the runway extension at Hahn Airport.

In the numerous wet areas, amphibians, like the fire salamander, and insects have found ideal habitats. Meanwhile, in areas covered by dry grassland or scree, numerous reptiles like the slowworm and smooth snake have found a home. The viper does not occur in the Hunsrück.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
Finds such as stone axes indicate that the Hunsrück has been settled since the New Stone Age. Older discoveries, which prove that the area was either settled or crossed during the Old Stone Age, are rare. Middle Palaeolithic (ca. 200,000–400,000 B.C.) surface finds from Weiler bei Bingen are an exception. By contrast the Gravettian (ca. 30,000–20,000 B.C.) sites in Heddesheim (in the municipality of Guldental) and Brey (in the municipality of Rhens) are the first settlements in the area around the Hunsrück. Other significant sites include the rather more recent Old Stone Age site of Nußbaum near Bad Sobernheim and the encampment of Late Palaeolithic deer hunters in Boppard, which was first discovered in 2001 by the ARRATA Archaeology Society. In 2014, Late Palaeolithic rock carvings similar to those from southern France and Spain were found in the Hunsrück. They were portraits of animals, especially horses, about 25,000 years old carved into a 1.2 m² slab of slate.

The oldest witnesses from the New Stone Age are dated to no later than the Middle Neolithic, relics of the so-called Rössen culture (whose sites include Biebernheim and Reckershausen). The majority of finds, especially of stone axes date, however, to the Late Neolithic and belong to the Michelsberg culture. Up to 2007, numerous oval stone axes were discovered, especially in the Fore-Hunsrück (Morshausen, Beulich and Macken). Likewise, finds of flint arrowheads point to a Late Neolithic (&quot;inter alia&quot; at Bell) and very Late Neolithic (Hirzenach) settlement. Other finds from the Bronze Age prove that there was continual settlement (especially documented by graves and grave goods). A greater process of settlement took place in the Early Iron Age (Hallstatt period) with the Laufeld culture and in the La Tène period (5th– 1st century B.C.) with the Hunsrück-Eifel culture, which has been linked with the Celts. Examples of this culture include the coach grave of Bell, the Waldalgesheim prince&#x27;s grave, the circular rampart of Otzenhausen, the Pfalzfeld obelisk, the upland settlement of Altburg in the Hahnenbach valley and the numerous fields of tumuli. At that time, the Hunsrück was the tribal area of the Treveri.

=== Roman period ===
Between about 50 BC and AD 400 the Romans opened up the Hunsrück by building a dense network of roads. The best known relic of this is the Via Ausonia. Numerous finds of Roman farms (Villa Rustica), settlements, like the &quot;vicus&quot; Belginum, and military structures point to an almost total settlement of the region by the Romans.

=== Frankish period ===
The final years of the 4th century saw the decline and fall of the Western Roman Empire. The Franks conquered the Roman territories and began to divide them up. This was the start of the great western and central European empire of Francia. In the mid-8th century this was divided into &quot;gaus&quot; under Carolingian rule. The northern part of the present Hunsrück foreland belonged to the Trechirgau, the southern part to the Nahegau. The Trechirgau was managed by the so-called Bertholds, the Nahegau by the Emichones. The capital of the Trechirgau, &quot;Trigorium&quot;, was in Treis. 

=== Middle Ages to French period ===
The &quot;Hundesrucha&quot; is mentioned for the first time in a 1074 deed from Ravengiersburg Abbey.

In the Middle Ages, the Hunsrück was territorially fragmented between the counts Palatine of the Rhine, the archbishops of Trier, the counts of Sponheim and the successors of the Emichones (the Wildgraves, the Raugraves and the counts of Veldenz). There were also a number of smaller dominions. Due to the multitude of dominions, many castles and customs stations were built, mainly between 11th to mid 14th century, which still shape the landscape today.

In 1410 the Principality of Simmern emerged as a territory ruled by a side line of the counts Palatine. In the following years, Simmern became the most important residence of a noble family in the Hunsrück. Under Duke John II the town achieved supra-regional importance for a short time. 

After the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Louis XIV of France made reunification demands on several principalities in the Palatinate, the Hunsrück and the Eifel. He had his troops invade and thus precipitated the Nine Years&#x27; War. In 1689 Kirchberg, Kastellaun, Simmern and the town and castle of Stromberg were set on fire. Then came the chaos of war, which led to the War of the Spanish Succession and which ended in 1713.

In the following years, trade and commerce grew. In the Hunsrück the first industry was set up by the families of Hauzeur, Pastert and Stumm. They ran mining, processing and ore smelting businesses. These, in turn, spurred the manufacture of implements for the house, farming and handicrafts: ovens, pans, boilers, weights, spades, nails, hammers, anvils, looms, spinning wheels and ammunition (cannonballs and shells weighing from 2 to 30 pounds). Leaders in the iron processing industry were the family of Stumm. Their progenitor, Christian Stumm, was a blacksmith in Rhaunensulzbach. Two of his sons were important entrepreneurs. Johann Nikolaus Stumm (1668-1743) was a smeltery owner and his sons, Johann Ferdinand, Friedrich Philipp and Christian Philipp Stumm, bought the Neunkirchen ironworks on 22 March 1806, part of today&#x27;s Saarstahl AG. Johann Michael Stumm (1683-1747) was the founder of an organ building workshop.

The notorious robbers, Johannes Bückler (known as &quot;Schinderhannes&quot;) and Johann Peter Petri (&quot;Black Peter&quot;) brought insecurity to the Hunsrück in the late 18th century.

In 1792, as a result of the French Revolution and the seizure of power by Napoleon, French troops once again invaded the territories west of the Rhine and annexed them during the French period. After the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, most of the Hunsrück was reallocated at the Congress of Vienna to Prussia&#x27;s Rhine Province. Parts of today&#x27;s Birkenfeld and the northern Saarland belonged to the Oldenburg Principality of Birkenfeld until 1937.

=== Prussia era and emigration ===
The economic situation in the Hunsrück became serious during the years 1815-1845. A poor harvest in 1815 was followed by the year without a summer in 1816; grain prices rose rapidly and 1817 became a year of famine.

In September 1822, the Brazilian government sent Georg Anton Schäffer to Germany to recruit mercenaries and colonists. He arrived in 1823, as a representative of Emperor Dom Pedro I of Brazil, and visited the Hanseatic cities, Frankfurt and many of the German courts. This mission sparked the first major wave of German emigrants to Brazil. Many of them were recruited by Schäffer from the Hunsrück, the northern and western parts of present-day Saarland and the Western Palatinate.

The first immigrants from the Hunsrück settled in 1824 in what is now the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, near the city of São Leopoldo. Not until 1830 did the number of emigrants to Brazil begin to fall.

The 1840s in Europe were marked by inflation, crop failures and a degree of social unrest, so that again (especially in 1846 and 1861) many people in Hunsrück decided to leave in two more waves of emigration, especially to North America and Brazil.

In August 1846, it was announced in Dunkirk, that free passage to Brazil would no longer be possible. At this time there were over 800 people waiting there. Prussia refused to give any assistance to the impoverished and helpless emigrants. They were transported from France in three warships to Algeria and settled in the villages of Stidia and Sainte-Léonie. Most of their descendants returned to France after the Algerian War in 1962.

As a result of the increasing neglect and deprivation of parts of the population in Germany during the era of industrialization, an Inner Mission association was founded at the initiative of the Simmern pastor, and later superintendent, Julius Reuss, in Simmern, with the aim of building a rescue centre in the Hunsrück for children living in poverty. In 1851, an area between Simmern and Nannhausen, the &quot;Schmiedel&quot;, was acquired. There, the first building was erected as a &quot;mother house&quot; (&quot;Mutterhaus&quot; or &quot;domus materna&quot;), which opened on 13 September 1851 with a householder and twelve boys. Even today, the head offices of the &quot;Schmiedel&quot; organization remain on the site.

=== German Reich ===
After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/1871 and the foundation of the German Reich under Prussia&#x27;s leadership, the so-called &quot;Gründerzeit&quot; began. Its success did not impact the Hunsrück until later, which is why many job seekers and even entire families went looking for work in the Ruhr area and migrated there.

The Protestant pastor, later Prussian Landtag MP, Richard Oertel, founder of the Hunsrück Farmers&#x27; Union in 1892, and Albert Hackenberg, acting pastor in Hottenbach from 1879 to 1912, successfully worked to improve the economic, social and technological conditions in the Hunsrück region. They achieved this through the creation of dairy cooperatives, postal agencies and, in particular, through adult education.

=== First and Second World War ===
The First World War, the Occupation Period and inflation also had a serious impact on the economy of the Hunsrück and its inhabitants, but there were not the political tensions that arose in many places in the German Reich.

A pioneer of industrialisation in the Hunsrück was entrepreneur, Michael Felke. In 1919 he founded the Felke Möbelwerke, a company that produced and sold furniture in Central Europe until the late 1990s. It was one of the first major employers in the region.

In 1938 and 1939, the German army became interested in the Hunsrück region as a strategic deployment route to the German-French border and the Siegfried Line, building the Hunsrück Highway, 140 kilometres long, in just 100 days. Supply depots and airfields were built in the woods on both sides of the road. In the Second World War and post-war period, two places in the Hunsrück rose to notoriety: Hinzert concentration camp and Bretzenheim POW camp, the so-called &quot;Field of Misery&quot;.

=== Cold War to the present ===
In 1946, most of the Hunsrück became part of the new state of Rhineland-Palatinate, with small elements around Nonnweiler going to the Saarland.
During the Cold War until the early 1990s, the Hunsrück was home to numerous military airfields, ammunition dumps, command positions and missile sites. The most famous were Hahn Air Base, Pferdsfeld Air Base, the Börfink Command Bunker and the Pydna Missile Base.

In 1986/87, as a result of the NATO Double-Track Decision, 96 cruise missiles, fitted with nuclear warheads, were to be stored at Pydna. On 11 Oct 1986, on the market place in Bell, what was probably the largest demonstration in the Hunsrück&#x27;s history took place. Around 200,000 people, 95% of whom were not from the Hunsrück, peacefully protested against the deployment of the missiles. At the end of the day the &quot;Hunsrück Declaration&quot; was read out which called for a reversal of the security policy. This did not happen, however, the Cold War ended two years later anyway, and the missile based was closed on 31 August 1993, the land being acquired by the Kastellaun garrison authority.

Likewise the US airbase at Hahn was transferred in 1993 to the German authorities and became a civilian facility, Frankfurt-Hahn Airport. The airport has expanded steadily since that time.

In the early 1980s, the film director Edgar Reitz shot the first part of his trilogy &quot;Heimat&quot; in the Hunsrück, a large part of it in Woppenroth, also known as &quot;Schabbach&quot;. In 2012, Reitz returned to the Hunsrück for the shooting of his film &quot;Die andere Heimat - Chronik einer Sehnsucht&quot; in the village of Gehlweiler. The film focuses on the Vormärz era in the mid-19th century and the waves of emigration from the Hunsrück to Brazil.

<text>Adaptation is a 2002 American comedy-drama film directed by Spike Jonze and written by Charlie Kaufman. It features an ensemble cast led by Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper, with Cara Seymour, Brian Cox, Tilda Swinton, Ron Livingston and Maggie Gyllenhaal in supporting roles.

Kaufman based &quot;Adaptation&quot; on his struggles to adapt Susan Orlean&#x27;s 1998 nonfiction book &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot; while suffering from writer&#x27;s block. It involves elements adapted from the book, plus fictitious elements, including Kaufman&#x27;s twin brother (also credited as a writer for the film) and a romance between Orlean and John Laroche (Chris Cooper). It culminates in completely invented elements, including versions of Orlean and Laroche three years after the events of &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot;.

&quot;Adaptation&quot; received widespread critical acclaim for its direction, screenplay, humor, and the performances of Cage, Cooper and Streep. It received awards at the 75th Academy Awards, 60th Golden Globe Awards and 56th British Academy Film Awards, with Cooper winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and Kaufman winning the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. A British Film Institute poll ranked it one of the thirty best films of the 2000s.

==Plot==
Self-loathing screenwriter Charlie Kaufman is hired to write the screenplay adaptation of Susan Orlean&#x27;s &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot;. He struggles with anxiety, social phobia, depression, and low self-esteem. His twin brother, Donald, has moved into his house and is freeloading there. Donald decides to become a screenwriter like Charlie and attends seminars by screenwriting guru Robert McKee.

Charlie, who rejects formulaic scriptwriting, wants to ensure that his script is a faithful adaptation of &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot; but comes to feel that the book does not have a usable narrative and is impossible to turn into a film, which leaves him with a serious case of writer&#x27;s block. Already well past his deadline with Columbia Pictures and despairing of writing his script with self-reference, Charlie travels to New York City to discuss the screenplay with Orlean directly. Too shy and socially awkward to speak with her upon arriving at her office and after he received the surprising news that Donald&#x27;s spec script for a clichéd psychological thriller, &quot;The 3&quot;, is selling for six or seven figures, Charlie resorts to attending McKee&#x27;s seminar in New York and asks him for advice. Charlie ends up asking Donald to join him in New York to assist with the story structure.

Donald, who is confident socially, pretends to be Charlie and interviews Orlean but finds her responses suspicious. He and Charlie follow Orlean to Florida, where she meets John Laroche, the orchid-stealing protagonist of her book and her secret lover. It is revealed that the Seminole wanted the ghost orchid to manufacture a mind-altering drug that causes fascination. Laroche introduces the drug to Orlean. After Laroche and Orlean catch Charlie observing them taking the drug and having sex, Orlean decides that Charlie must be killed to prevent him from potentially exposing them.

Orlean forces Charlie to drive to the swamp at gunpoint, intending to kill him. Charlie and Donald escape and hide in the swamp, where they resolve their differences. Laroche accidentally shoots Donald. Charlie and Donald drive off but collide head-on with a ranger&#x27;s truck. Donald is ejected through the windshield and dies moments later, but Charlie is saved by the airbag and runs into the swamp to hide. There he is spotted by Laroche, who is killed by an alligator before he can kill Charlie.

Orlean is arrested. Charlie reconciles with his mother as he calls to inform her of Donald&#x27;s death. He later tells his former love interest, Amelia, that he loves her. She responds that she loves him too. Charlie finishes the script, which ends with him announcing in a voice-over that the script is finished and that for the first time, he is filled with hope.

Tom Hanks was originally set for the double role of Charlie and Donald Kaufman. Cage took the role for a $5 million salary, and wore a fatsuit during filming.

Streep expressed strong interest in the role of Susan Orlean before being cast, and took a salary cut in recognition of the film&#x27;s budget. John Turturro was approached to portray John Laroche. Cooper strongly considered turning down Laroche, but accepted it after his wife urged him to. Albert Finney, Christopher Plummer, Terence Stamp and Michael Caine were considered for the role of Robert McKee, but McKee personally suggested Brian Cox to filmmakers.

John Cusack, Catherine Keener, John Malkovich, Lance Acord, Thomas Patrick Smith, and Spike Jonze have uncredited cameos as themselves in scenes where Charlie Kaufman is on the set of &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;, which he also wrote. Additional cameos include director Curtis Hanson as Orlean&#x27;s husband, and David O. Russell as a &quot;New Yorker&quot; journalist.

==Production==
===Development===
The idea to do a film adaptation of Susan Orlean&#x27;s &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot; dates back to 1994. Fox 2000 purchased the film rights in 1997, eventually selling them to Jonathan Demme, who set the project at Columbia Pictures. Charlie Kaufman was hired to write the script, but struggled with the adaptation and writer&#x27;s block. Kaufman eventually created a script of his experience in adaptation, exaggerating events and creating a fictional twin brother. He put Donald Kaufman&#x27;s name on the script and dedicated the film to him. By September 1999, Kaufman had written two drafts of the script; he turned in a third draft in November 2000.

Kaufman said, &quot;The idea of how to write the film didn&#x27;t come to me until quite late. It was the only idea I had, I liked it, and I knew there was no way it would be approved if I pitched it. So I just wrote it and never told the people I was writing it for. I only told Spike Jonze, as we were making &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; and he saw how frustrated I was. Had he said I was crazy, I don&#x27;t know what I would have done.&quot; He also said, &quot;I really thought I was ending my career by turning that in!&quot;

&quot;Adaptation&quot; went on fast track in April 2000, with Kaufman making some revisions. Scott Brake of &quot;IGN&quot; gave the script a positive review in June 2000, as did Drew McWeeny of &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Cool News&quot; in October. Columbia Pictures committed to North America distribution only after Intermedia came aboard to finance the film in exchange for international distribution rights.

===Filming===
Filming started in late March 2001 in Los Angeles and finished by June. The &quot;evolution&quot; fantasy sequence was created by Digital Domain, while Skywalker Sound handled audio post production services.
The makeup effects (the Nicolas Cage double, Chris Cooper&#x27;s teeth, and the alligator attack) are by makeup effects designer Tony Gardner and his effects company Alterian, Inc.

==Release==
Columbia Pictures at one point announced a late 2001 theatrical release date, but &quot;Adaptation&quot; opened on December 6, 2002, in the United States for a limited release. The film was released nationwide on February 14, 2003, earning $1,130,480 in its opening weekend in 672 theaters. It went on to gross $22.5 million in North America and $10.3 million in foreign countries, for a total of $32.8 million.

===Home media===
&quot;Adaptation&quot; was released on DVD and VHS by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment in May 2003. Image Entertainment released a bare-bones Blu-ray in 2012, which was followed in 2020 by another release through Shout! Factory.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Adaptation&quot; has an approval rating of 91% based on 211 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Dizzyingly original, the loopy, multi-layered &quot;Adaptation&quot; is both funny and thought-provoking.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 83 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four out of four stars, calling it &quot;bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining&quot;. He wrote that the film &quot;leaves you breathless with curiosity, as it teases itself with the directions it might take. To watch the film is to be actively involved in the challenge of its creation.&quot; He later added the film to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; canon, and in 2009, he named it one of the best films of the decade. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also gave the film a four-star rating, writing, &quot;Screenwriting this smart, inventive, passionate and rip-roaringly funny is a rare species. So all praise to Charlie Kaufman, working with director Spike Jonze to create the most original and outrageous film comedy since the two first teamed on &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;, in 1999.&quot; Wesley Morris of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote, &quot;This is epic, funny, tragic, demanding, strange, original, boldly sincere filmmaking. And the climax, the portion that either sinks the entire movie or self-critically explains how so many others derail, is bananas.&quot;

David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote that Meryl Streep had not &quot;been this much fun to watch in years&quot;, while Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; gave a largely negative review, mainly criticizing the ending: &quot;Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like, this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot.&quot; Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Adaptation&quot; is almost juvenile showing off—daring to make a film that is in search of a script&quot;.

==Accolades==
In a 2006 survey, the Writers Guild of America named &quot;Adaptation&quot; the 77th best movie screenplay ever written.

=== Response from Susan Orlean ===
Having been sent the screenplay for approval, Susan Orlean was strongly opposed to the making of the film; she ended up reluctantly approving its production and was ultimately very impressed with the final result. In 2012, she said, &quot;[reading the screenplay] was a complete shock. My first reaction was &#x27;Absolutely not!&#x27; They had to get my permission and I just said: &#x27;No! Are you kidding? This is going to ruin my career!&#x27; Very wisely, they didn&#x27;t really pressure me. They told me that everybody else had agreed and I somehow got emboldened. It was certainly scary to see the movie for the first time. It took a while for me to get over the idea that I had been insane to agree to it, but I love the movie now.&quot;

Orlean called Streep&#x27;s portrayal of her &quot;one of my favorite performances by her&quot; and appreciated that her version of the character was based not on the real Orlean but on how Streep imagined Orlean based on &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot;. Despite the film&#x27;s fictional parts, Orlean praised its fidelity to the book&#x27;s spirit: &quot;What I admire the most is that it&#x27;s very true to the book&#x27;s themes of life and obsession, and there are also insights into things which are much more subtle in the book about longing, and about disappointment.&quot;

<text>The Battle of Hastenbeck (26 July 1757) was fought as part of the Invasion of Hanover during the Seven Years&#x27; War between the allied forces of Hanover, Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) and Brunswick, and the French. The allies were defeated by the French army near Hamelin in the Electorate of Hanover.

==Prelude==

The French, who were allied with Austria, Russia, Sweden and Saxony during the Seven Years&#x27; War, invaded Germany in April 1757 with two armies, altogether about 100,000 soldiers. The French hoped to draw the attention of the Kingdom of Prussia, which was allied with Britain and Hanover, away from the Bohemian theatre where Prussia and Austria fought several battles (Lobositz, Prague, Kolin).

One of the two French armies under command of Prince de Soubise marched through central Germany. It joined the Imperial Army, or &quot;Reichsarmee&quot;, commanded by Prinz von Hildburghausen. This coalition army later met a Prussian army at the Battle of Rossbach on 5 November 1757 with disaster.

The other French army commanded by Marshal Louis Charles d&#x27;Estrées consisted of about 50,000 infantry, 10,000 cavalry and 68 cannons. The army advanced towards the Electorate of Hanover. Prussia was heavily involved with its enemies Austria, Russia and Sweden and therefore was not able to help on the western front. This task was given to the Hanoverian Army of Observation which had little support from Prussia, namely six Prussian battalions. The main part of the &quot;Hanoverian Army of Observation&quot; came from the Hanoverian Army (about 60%) and Hesse (about 25%), smaller additional forces from Brunswick and Prussia. The total strength of the Hanoverian Army of Observation consisted of about 30,000 infantry, 5,000 cavalry and 28 guns. The army was commanded by William Augustus the Duke of Cumberland who was a son of King George II of Great Britain.

Hanover refused to defend the Rhine which is west of the Weser. This left the Prussians no choice but to abandon their fortress in Wesel and to give up the line of the Lippe in April. Cumberland&#x27;s main objective was preventing the occupation of Hanover. He first concentrated his army at Bielefeld, and then after a brief stand in Brackwede, Cumberland decided to cross the Weser south of Minden. The main idea was to use the Weser as a natural defense line and to make it impossible for the French troops to cross the river. The Duke of Cumberland deployed his main forces at Hamelin which is a couple of kilometers to the northwest of Hastenbeck and left the Prussian battalions as garrison forces in Minden. He also deployed small patrols all along the Weser. Meanwhile, the French sent a detachment to the north to capture Emden, which was an important access point for Britain to Europe, on 3 July. Later they sent another detachment to the south, which took Kassel on 15 July.

During the night of 7 July, a strong French advance guard crossed the river Weser close to the town Beverungen. While the river Weser normally cannot easily be forded, during the summer the water level drops down to a low of 80 cm (~3 feet) between Münden and Hameln, making it possible for infantry and cavalry to cross. The French advance troops then marched to the north and established a bridgehead at Höxter. The main army crossed the Weser on 16 July, leaving the Duke of Cumberland no choice but to deploy his troops south of Hamelin and to engage d&#x27;Estrées. The Prussian battalions were then recalled by Frederick the Great, after losing the Battle of Kolin against Austria.

==Battle==
The armies finally met on the morning of 25 July at the village of Hastenbeck. The commander of the French right flank, general François de Chevert, was ordered to engage Hanoverian troops at the village of Voremberg, but failed to drive them out. As the French left under general Duc de Broglie was still crossing the Weser near Hameln, d&#x27;Estrées decided to postpone the battle until all his troops were up.

The next day saw the Hanoverian army holding on a line from Hamelin to Voremberg. Their right flank was anchored on the Hamel river and Hastenbach creek. The center of the Hanoverian front was deployed north of the town of Hastenbeck, and an artillery battery was situated on high ground behind the town. The Hanoverian left consisted of two entrenched batteries, with grenadier battalions protecting the guns. The left flank was anchored on the Obensburg. Cumberland made the mistake of assuming the hill to be impassable to formed troops and deployed a meagre three &quot;Jäger&quot; companies on its summit, effectively leaving the Hanoverian left flank in the air.

General Chevert was ordered to flank the Hanoverian position with four brigades of troops from Picardy, la Marine, Navarre, and Eu. At 9 AM, this force advanced toward the Obensburg in three battalion columns and quickly overwhelmed the &quot;Jäger (German light infantryderived from hunters)&quot;. The Duke of Cumberland, seeing his position threatened from the rear, ordered his reserves and the grenadier battalions protecting the guns to recapture the Obensburg. The use of these grenadier battalions in the counterattack on the Obensburg meant that they were no longer available in the center when the main French attacks went in against the Hanoverian center.

The French main attack consisted of general d&#x27;Armentieres&#x27;s attack against Voremberg with five brigades of infantry plus four regiments of dismounted dragoons. At the same time, the French center assaulted the battery immediately north of it. The Hanoverian grand battery was able to repulse several of the French attacks, but eventually the guns were overrun. When the Hanoverian reserve infantry arrived on the Obensburg, they were able to turn the tide momentarily, but as the Duke of Cumberland had begun to withdraw his army, they were unable to maintain the now-isolated position for long.

==Outcome==
The Battle of Hastenbeck is one of the most curious battles in history since both commanders-in-chief thought that they lost the battle and were already starting to withdraw from the battlefield. The battle eventually resulted in the Convention of Klosterzeven on September 18 and the occupation of Hanover. During the battle, Hastenbeck was almost completely destroyed: only the church, the manse and the farmhouse were not destroyed.

<text>Benjamin Ryan Tillman (August 11, 1847 – July 3, 1918) was a politician of the Democratic Party who served as governor of South Carolina from 1890 to 1894, and as a United States Senator from 1895 until his death in 1918. A white supremacist who opposed civil rights for black Americans, Tillman led a paramilitary group of Red Shirts during South Carolina&#x27;s violent 1876 election. On the floor of the U.S. Senate, he defended lynching, and frequently ridiculed black Americans in his speeches, boasting of having helped kill them during that campaign.

In the 1880s, Tillman, a wealthy landowner, became dissatisfied with the Democratic leadership and led a movement of white farmers calling for reform. He was initially unsuccessful, though he was instrumental in the founding of Clemson University as an agricultural land-grant college. In 1890, Tillman took control of the state Democratic Party, and was elected governor. During his four years in office, 18 black Americans were lynched in South Carolina; in the 1890s, the state had its highest number of lynchings of any decade. Tillman tried to prevent lynchings as governor but also spoke in support of the lynch mobs, alleging his own willingness to lead one. In 1894, at the end of his second two-year term, he was elected to the U.S. Senate by vote of the state legislature, who elected senators at the time.

Tillman was known as &quot;Pitchfork Ben&quot; because of his aggressive language, as when he threatened to use a pitchfork to prod that &quot;bag of beef&quot;, President Grover Cleveland. Considered a possible candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 1896, Tillman lost any chance after giving a disastrous speech at the convention. He became known for his virulent oratoryespecially against black Americansbut also for his effectiveness as a legislator. The first federal campaign finance law, banning corporate contributions, is commonly called the Tillman Act. Tillman was repeatedly re-elected, serving in the Senate for the rest of his life. One of his legacies was South Carolina&#x27;s 1895 constitution, which disenfranchised most of the black majority and many poor whites, and ensured white Democratic Party rule for more than six decades into the 20th century.

== Early life and education ==
Benjamin Ryan Tillman Jr. was born on August 11, 1847, on the family plantation &quot;Chester&quot;, near Trenton, in the Edgefield District, sometimes considered part of upcountry South Carolina. His parents, Benjamin Ryan Tillman Sr. and the former Sophia Hancock, were of English descent. In addition to being planters with 86 slaves, the Tillmans operated an inn. They owned 2,500 acres of land and were among the largest slaveholders in the district. Benjamin Jr. was the last-born of seven sons and four daughters.

The Edgefield District was known as a violent place, even by the standards of antebellum South Carolina, where matters of personal honor might be addressed with a killing or duel. Before Tillman Sr.&#x27;s death from typhoid fever in 1849, he had killed a man and been convicted of rioting by an Edgefield jury. One of his sons died in a duel; another was killed in a domestic dispute. A third died in the Mexican–American War; a fourth at the age of 15 from disease. Of Benjamin Jr.&#x27;s two surviving brothers, one died of Civil War wounds after returning home, and the other, George, killed a man who accused him of cheating at gambling. Convicted of manslaughter, George continued to practice law from his jail cell during his two-year sentence, and was elected to the state senate while still incarcerated. He later served several terms in Congress.

From an early age, Ben showed a developed vocabulary. In 1860, he was sent to Bethany, a boarding school in Edgefield where he became a star student, and he remained there after the American Civil War began. In 1863, he came home for a year to help his mother pay off debts. He returned to Bethany in 1864, intending a final year of study prior to entering the South Carolina College (today, the University of South Carolina). The South&#x27;s desperate need for soldiers ended this plan. In June 1864, not yet 17, Tillman withdrew from the academy, making arrangements to join a coastal artillery unit. These plans were scuttled as well when he fell ill at home. A cranial tumor required the removal of his left eye. It was not until 1866, months after Confederate forces had disbanded, that Ben Tillman was again healthy.

After the war, Ben Tillman, his mother, and his wounded brother James (who died in 1866) worked to rebuild Chester plantation. They signed the plantation&#x27;s freedmen as workers. They were confronted with the circumstance of several men refusing to work for them and legally leaving the plantation. From 1866 to 1868, Ben Tillman went with several workers from the plantation to Florida, where a new cotton cultivation belt had been established. The Tillmans purchased land there. Tillman was unsuccessful in Florida: after two marginal years, the 1868 crop was destroyed by caterpillars.

During his convalescence, Tillman had met Sallie Starke, a refugee from Fairfield District. They married in January 1868 and she joined him in Florida. The Tillmans returned to South Carolina, where the following year they settled on of Tillman family land, given to him by his mother. They would have seven children together: Adeline, Benjamin Ryan, Henry Cummings, Margaret Malona, Sophia Oliver, Samuel Starke, and Sallie Mae.

Though he was not very religious, Tillman was a frequent churchgoer as a young adult. He was a Christian, but did not identify with a particular sect; as a result, he never formally joined a church. His religious skepticism also led to his avoidance of any further churchgoing almost immediately following his becoming a politician.

Tillman proved an adept farmer, who experimented with crop diversification and took his crops to market each Saturday in nearby Augusta, Georgia. In 1878, Tillman inherited from Sophia Tillman, and purchased at Ninety Six, some from his Edgefield holdings. Having inherited a large library from his uncle John Tillman, he spent part of his days reading.

Although his workers were no longer slaves, Tillman continued to apply the whip to them. By 1876, Tillman was the largest landowner in Edgefield County. He rode through his fields on horseback like an antebellum overseer, and stated at the time that it was necessary that he do so to &quot;drive the slovenly Negroes to work&quot;.

== Red Shirts and Reconstruction ==

=== Resistance to Republican rule ===

With the Confederacy defeated, South Carolina ratified a new constitution in 1865 that recognized the end of slavery, but basically left the pre-war elites in charge. African-American freedmen, who were the majority of South Carolina&#x27;s population, were given no vote, and their new freedom was soon restricted by Black Codes that limited their civil rights and required black farm laborers to bind themselves with annual labor contracts. Congress was dissatisfied with this minimal change and required a new constitutional convention and elections with universal male suffrage. As African Americans generally favored the Republican Party at the time, their votes resulted in that party controlling the biracial state legislature beginning with the 1868 elections. That campaign was marked by violence; 19 Republican and Union League activists were killed in South Carolina&#x27;s 3rd congressional district alone.
In 1873, two Edgefield lawyers and former Confederate generals, Martin Gary and Matthew C. Butler, began to advocate what became known as the &quot;Edgefield Plan&quot; or &quot;Straightout Plan&quot;. They believed that the previous five years had shown it was not possible to outvote African Americans. Gary and Butler deemed compromises with black leaders to be misguided; they believed that white men must be restored to their antebellum position of preeminent political power in the state. They proposed that white men form clandestine paramilitary organizations—known as &quot;rifle clubs&quot;—and use force and intimidation to drive African Americans from power. Members of the new white groups became known as Red Shirts. Tillman was an early and enthusiastic recruit for his local organization, dubbed the Sweetwater Sabre Club. He became a devoted protégé of Gary.

From 1873 to 1876, Tillman served as a member of the Sweetwater club, members of which assaulted and intimidated black would-be voters, killed black political figures, and skirmished with the African-American-dominated state militia. Economic coercion was used as well as physical force: most Edgefield planters would not employ black militiamen or allow them to rent land, and ostracized whites who did.

=== Hamburg massacre; campaign of 1876 ===

In 1874, a moderate Republican, Daniel Henry Chamberlain, was elected South Carolina&#x27;s governor, attracting even some Democratic votes. When Chamberlain sought re-election in 1876, Gary recruited Wade Hampton III, a Confederate war hero who had moved out of state, to return and run for governor as a Democrat. That election campaign of 1876 was marked by violence, of which the most notorious occurrence was what became known as the Hamburg massacre. It occurred in Hamburg, a mostly black town across the Savannah River from Augusta, in Aiken County, bordering Edgefield County. The incident grew out of a confrontation on July 4 when a black militia marched in Hamburg and two white farmers in a buggy tried to ride through its ranks. Both sides filed criminal charges against the other, and dozens of armed out-of-uniform Red Shirts, led by Butler, traveled to Hamburg on the day of the hearing, July 8. Tillman was present, and the subsequent events were among his proudest memories.

The hearing never occurred, as the black militiamen, outnumbered and outgunned, refused to attend court. This upset the white mob, which expected an apology. Butler demanded that the militiamen give one, and as part of the apology, surrender their arms. Those who attempted to mediate found that neither Butler nor the armed men who backed him were interested in compromise. If the militiamen surrendered their arms, they would be helpless before the mob; if they did not, Butler and his men would use force. Butler brought additional men in from Georgia, and the augmented armed mob, including Tillman, went to confront the militiamen, who were barricaded in their drill room, above a local store. Shots were fired, and after one white man was killed, the rest stormed the room and captured about thirty of the militia. Five were murdered as having white enemies; among the dead was a town constable who had arrested white men. The rest were allowed to flee, with shots fired after them. At least seven black militiamen were killed in the incident. On the way home to Edgefield, Tillman and others had a meal to celebrate the events at the home of the man who had pointed out which African Americans should be shot.
Tillman later recalled that &quot;the leading white men of Edgefield&quot; had decided &quot;to seize the first opportunity that the Negroes might offer them to provoke a riot and teach the Negroes a lesson&quot; by &quot;having the whites demonstrate their superiority by killing as many of them as was justifiable&quot;. Hamburg was their first such opportunity. Ninety-four white men, including Tillman, were indicted by a coroner&#x27;s jury, but none was prosecuted for the killings. Butler blamed the deaths on intoxicated factory workers and Irish-Americans who had come across the bridge from Augusta, and over whom he had no control.

Tillman raised his profile in state politics by attending the 1876 state Democratic convention, which nominated Hampton as the party&#x27;s candidate for governor. While Hampton presented a fatherly image, urging support from South Carolinians, black and white, Tillman led fifty men to Ellenton, intending to join more than one thousand rifle club members who slaughtered thirty militiamen, with the survivors saved only by the arrival of federal authorities. Although Tillman and his men arrived too late to participate in those killings, two of his men murdered Simon Coker, a black state senator who had come to investigate reports of violence. They shot him as he knelt in final prayer.

On Election Day in November 1876, Tillman served as an election official at a local poll, as did two black Republicans. One arrived late and was scared off by Tillman. As there was as yet no secret ballot in South Carolina, Tillman threatened to remember any votes cast for the Republicans. That precinct gave 211 votes for the Democrats and 2 for the Republicans. Although almost two-thirds of those eligible to vote in Edgefield were African Americans, the Democrats were able to suppress the (Republican) African-American vote, reporting a win for Hampton in Edgefield County with over 60 percent of the vote. Bolstered by this result, Hampton gained a narrow victory statewide, at least according to the official returns. The Red Shirts used violence and fraud to create Democratic majorities that did not exist, and give Hampton the election.

Tillman biographer Stephen Kantrowitz wrote that the unrest in 1876 &quot;marked a turning point in Ben Tillman&#x27;s life, establishing him as a member of the political and military leadership&quot;. Historian Orville Vernon Burton stated that the violence &quot;secured his prominence among the state&#x27;s white political elite and proved to be the deathblow to South Carolina&#x27;s Republican Reconstruction government.&quot; The takeover, by fraud and terror, of South Carolina&#x27;s government became known to whites as the state&#x27;s &quot;Redemption&quot;.

In 1909, Tillman addressed a reunion of Red Shirts in Anderson, South Carolina, and recounted the events of 1876:
== &quot;Agricultural Moses&quot; ==

Starting with the election of Hampton as governor in 1876, South Carolina was ruled primarily by the wealthy &quot;Bourbon&quot; or &quot;Conservative&quot; planter class that had controlled the state before the Civil War. In the 1880s, though, the Bourbon class was neither as strong nor as populous as before. The agenda of the Conservatives had little to offer the farmer, and in the hard economic times of the early 1880s, there was discontent in South Carolina that led to some electoral success for the short-lived Greenback Party.

Having risen to the rank of captain in the rifle club before the end of the 1876 campaign, Tillman spent the next several years managing his plantations. He played a modest role in Edgefield&#x27;s political and social life, and in 1881 was elected second in command of the Edgefield Hussars, a rifle club that had been made part of the state militia. He supported Gary&#x27;s unsuccessful candidacy for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1880, and after Gary&#x27;s death in 1881, as a delegate to the 1882 Democratic state convention Tillman backed former Confederate general John Bratton for the nomination, again unsuccessfully. By then, Tillman was dissatisfied with the Conservative leaders he had helped gain power; he believed they were ignoring the interests of farmers and of poor mill workers, and had been responsible for denying office to Gary—the former Red Shirt leader had twice sought to be senator, and once governor, and was each time denied. Tillman never forgot what he deemed the &quot;betrayal&quot; of Gary.

=== Struggle for the farmer ===
In an attempt to better conditions for the farmer (by which Tillman always meant white males only), in 1884 he founded the Edgefield Agricultural Club. It died for lack of members. Undeterred, Tillman tried again in January 1885, beginning the Edgefield County Agricultural Society. Its membership also dwindled, but Tillman was elected one of three delegates to the August joint meeting of the state Grange and the state Agricultural and Mechanical Society at Bennettsville, and was invited to be one of the speakers.

When Tillman spoke at Bennettsville, he was not widely known except as the brother of Congressman George Tillman. Ben Tillman called for the state government to do more for farmers, and blamed politicians and lawyers in the pay of financial interests for agricultural problems, including the crop lien system that left many farmers struggling to pay bills. He assailed his listeners for letting themselves be duped by hostile interests, and told of the farmer who was elected to the legislature, only to be dazzled and seduced by the elite. According to an account the next day in the &quot;Columbia Daily Register&quot;, Tillman&#x27;s speech &quot;electrified the assembly and was the sensation of the meeting&quot;. Lindsey Perkins, in his journal article on Tillman&#x27;s oratory, wrote that &quot;Tillman&#x27;s losses in the agricultural depression of 1883–1898 forced him to begin thinking and planning economic reforms. The result was Bennettsville.&quot; Tillman later stated that he began his advocacy after a few bad years in the early 1880s forced him to sell some of his land. The speech was printed in several newspapers, and Tillman began to receive more invitations to speak. According to Zach McGhee in his 1906 article on Tillman, &quot;from that day to this he has been the most conspicuous figure in South Carolina&quot;.

Within two months of the Bennettsville speech, Tillman was being talked of as a candidate for governor in 1886. He continued to speak to audiences, and was dubbed the &quot;Agricultural Moses&quot;. He made political demands, such as primary elections to determine who would get the Democratic nomination (then tantamount to election) rather than the leaving the decision to the Bourbon-dominated state nominating convention. He principally promoted the establishment of a state college for the education of farmers, where young men could learn the latest techniques. Kantrowitz pointed out that the term &quot;farmer&quot; is flexible in meaning, allowing Tillman to overlook distinctions of class and unite most white men in predominantly rural South Carolina under a single banner. During these years, cartoonists began depicting Tillman with pitchfork in hand, symbolizing his agriculture-based roots and tendency to take jabs at opponents. This was a source of his nickname, &quot;Pitchfork Ben&quot;.

Historian H. Wayne Morgan noted that &quot;Ben Tillman&#x27;s venom was not typical, but his general feeling represented that of southern dirt farmers.&quot; According to E. Culpepper Clark in his journal article on Tillman,
Tillman spoke widely in the state in 1885 and after, and soon attracted allies, including a number of Red Shirt comrades, such as Martin Gary&#x27;s nephews Eugene B. Gary and John Gary Evans. He sought to mold local farmers&#x27; groups into a statewide organization to be a voice for agriculturalists. In April 1886, a convention called by Tillman met in Columbia, the state capital. The goal of what became known as the Farmer&#x27;s Association or Farmer&#x27;s Movement was to control the state Democratic Party from within, and to gain reforms such as the agricultural college. He initially was unsuccessful, though he came within thirty votes of controlling the 1886 state Democratic convention. The lack of success caused Tillman, in late 1887, to announce his retirement from politics, though there was widespread speculation he would soon be back.

Tillman had met, in 1886, with Thomas G. Clemson, son-in-law of the late John C. Calhoun, to discuss a bequest to underwrite the cost of the new agricultural school. Clemson died in 1888, and his will not only left money and land for the college, but made Tillman one of seven trustees for life, who had the power to appoint their successors. Tillman stated that this provision, which made the lifetime trustees a majority of the board, was intended to forestall any attempt by a future Republican government to admit African Americans. Clemson College (later Clemson University) was authorized by the legislature in December 1888.

The Clemson bequest helped revitalize Tillman&#x27;s movement. The targets of Tillman&#x27;s oratory were again politicians in Columbia and the Conservative elements based in Charleston and elsewhere in the lowcountry of South Carolina. Through letters to newspapers and stump speeches, he decried the state government as a pit of corruption, stating that officials displayed &quot;ignorance, extravagance and laziness&quot; and that Charleston&#x27;s The Citadel was a &quot;military dude factory&quot; that might profitably be repurposed as a school for women.

Governor John P. Richardson had been elected in 1886; in 1888 he sought re-nomination, to be met with opposition from Tillman&#x27;s farmers. As had been done to Republican rallies in 1876, Tillman and his followers attended campaign events and demanded that he be allowed equal time to speak. Tillman was a highly talented stump speaker, and when given the opportunity to debate, accused Richardson of being irreligious, a gambler and a drunkard. Even so, Richardson was easily re-nominated by the state Democratic convention, which turned down Tillman&#x27;s demand for a primary election. Tillman proposed the customary gracious motion that Richardson&#x27;s nomination be made unanimous.

=== 1890 gubernatorial campaign ===

One factor that helped Tillman and his movement in the 1890 campaign was the organization of many South Carolina farmers under the auspices of the Farmers&#x27; Alliance. The Alliance, which had spread through much of the agricultural South and West since its origin in Texas, sought to get farmers to work together cooperatively and seek reform. From that organization would come the People&#x27;s Party (better known as the Populists). Although the Populist Party played a significant role in the politics of the 1890s, it did not do so in South Carolina, where Tillman had already channeled agricultural discontent into an attempt to take over the Democratic Party. The Alliance in South Carolina generally backed Tillman, and its many local farmers&#x27; organizations gave Tillman new venues for his speeches.

In January 1890, Tillmanite leader George Washington Shell published what came to be known as the &quot;Shell Manifesto&quot; in a Charleston newspaper, setting forth the woes of farmers under the Conservative government, and calling for them to elect delegates to meet in March to recommend a candidate for governor. Both Tillman supporters and Conservatives realized the purpose was to pre-empt the Democratic convention&#x27;s choice, and fresh, acrimonious debate over the merits of Tillman and his methods began. He and his supporters were often attacked in the newspapers by the Conservatives, but such invective by the hated elites only tended to endear Tillman the more to the farmers who saw him as their champion. Conservatives were certain that once Tillman&#x27;s voters understood how wealthy he was while speaking for debt-ridden farmers, they would abandon him; they did not.

At the &quot;Shell Convention&quot;, state Representative John L. M. Irby nominated Tillman, stating &quot;shame on the [Democratic] party for stabbing Gary, a man who had saved us in &#x27;76 ... we could now make the amends honorable and choose B. R. Tillman&quot;. Although many delegates voted to make no endorsement, Tillman gained a narrow victory for the convention&#x27;s recommendation. Tillman spent the summer of 1890 making speeches and debating two rivals (former general Bratton and state Attorney General Joseph H. Earle) for the nomination, as the Democratic leadership watched with increasing consternation. Given Tillman&#x27;s strength at the grassroots level, he was likely to be the choice of the Democratic convention in September. Accordingly, the party&#x27;s Bourbon-controlled state executive committee tried to use the brief August convention (called to set the rules for the September one) to change the nomination method to a primary, in which the anti-Tillman forces would unite behind a single candidate. When the August convention was held, the Tillmanites had a large majority, which they used to oust the executive committee and install one loyal to Tillman. The convention also passed a new party constitution calling for a primary, beginning in 1892. Tillman was duly nominated in September as the Democratic candidate for governor, with Eugene Gary as his running mate for lieutenant governor.

After the convention many Conservative Democrats, though not happy at Tillman&#x27;s victory, acknowledged him as head of the state party. Those who submitted to Tillman&#x27;s rule included Hampton and Butler, the state&#x27;s two U.S. senators. In his campaign, Tillman promoted support for Clemson, establishment of a state women&#x27;s college, reapportionment of the state legislature (then dominated by the lowcountry counties), and ending the influence of corporation lawyers in that body.

Those Democrats who could not abide Tillman&#x27;s candidacy held an October meeting with 20 of South Carolina&#x27;s 35 counties represented, and nominated Alexander Haskell for governor. The announcement that Haskell would run caused a closing of Democratic ranks against him, lest white unity be sundered. The &quot;Charleston News and Courier&quot;, not always a friend to Tillman, urged, &quot;stand by the ticket, not for the ticket&#x27;s sake, but for the party and the State&quot;. Even most Conservatives would not support a bolt from the party, and Kantrowitz suggested that Haskell and his supporters hated Tillman so much that his nomination caused them to commit political suicide. The Haskell campaign reached out to black voters, pledging that he would not disturb the limited political role played by African Americans in the state, a promise Tillman was unlikely to make.

During Tillman&#x27;s five years of agricultural advocacy, he had rarely discussed the question of the African American. With blacks given control of one of South Carolina&#x27;s seven congressional districts, the question of black influence in state politics seemed settled and did not play a significant role in the campaign for the Democratic nomination for governor. Haskell&#x27;s appeals for support, added to speculation that Tillman was trying to form a biracial coalition through the Farmers&#x27; Alliance (which, though segregated, had a parallel organization for black farmers) made race an issue. Tillman boasted of his deeds at Hamburg and Ellenton, but it was Gary who made race the focus of his campaign. Urging segregation of railroad cars, Gary asked, &quot;what white man wants his wife or sister sandwiched between a big bully buck and a saucy wench&quot;?

Although Tillman fully expected to win, he warned that should he be defeated by ballot-box stuffing, there would be war. On Election Day, November 4, 1890, Tillman was elected governor with 59,159 votes to 14,828 for Haskell. With no Republican to support (none had run for governor since 1878), black leaders had been divided as to whether to endorse Haskell; in the end the only two counties won by him were in the lowcountry and heavily African-American. The losing candidate and his white supporters were quickly consigned to political oblivion, with some mocking them as &quot;white Negroes&quot;.

== Governor (1890–1894) ==

=== Inauguration and legislative control ===
Tillman was sworn in as governor in Columbia on December 4, 1890, before a crowd of jubilant supporters, the largest to see South Carolina&#x27;s governor inaugurated since Hampton&#x27;s swearing-in. In his inaugural address, Tillman celebrated his victory, &quot;the citizens of this great commonwealth have for the first time in its history demanded and obtained for themselves the right to choose her Governor; and I, as the exponent and leader of the revolution which brought about the change, am here to take the solemn oath of office ... the triumph of democracy and white supremacy over mongrelism and anarchy, of civilization over barbarism, has been most complete.&quot;

Tillman made it clear he was not content that African Americans were allowed even a limited role in the political life of South Carolina:


The legislature, at Tillman&#x27;s recommendation, reapportioned itself, costing Charleston County four of its twelve seats, and other lowcountry counties one each, with the seats going to the upcountry. Although Tillman sought to reduce public expenditures, he was not successful in doing so as his reform program required spending, and the legislature could find few savings to make. Construction of Clemson College was slowed, and subsidies for fairs were cut.

Among the matters before the new, Tillman-controlled legislature was who should fill the Senate seat held by Hampton, whose term expired in March 1891—until 1913, state legislatures elected senators. There was a call from many in the South Carolina Democratic Party to re-elect Hampton, who had played a major role in the state for the past thirty years, in war and peace. Tillman was embittered against Hampton for a number of slights, including the senator&#x27;s neutrality in the race against Haskell. The legislature retired Hampton, who received only 43 of 157 votes, and sent Irby to Washington in his place. The ouster of Hampton was controversial, and remained so for decades afterwards; according to Simkins (writing in 1944), &quot;to future generations of South Carolinians, Tillman&#x27;s act was a ruthless violation of cherished traditions of which Hampton was a living symbol&quot;.

=== Policies and events as governor ===

==== Lynching and race ====
Tillman as governor initially took a strong stand against lynching. The Shell Manifesto, in reciting the ills of Conservative government, had blamed the Bourbons for encouraging lynching through bad laws and poor administration. Although Governor Richardson, Tillman&#x27;s predecessor, had taken action to prevent such murders, they still occurred, with no one being prosecuted for them. In about half of the lynchings in South Carolina between 1881 and 1895, there were claims that the black victim had raped or tried to rape a white woman. More lynchings took place in South Carolina in the 1890s than in any other decade, and in Edgefield and several other counties, such killings outnumbered lawful executions.
During Tillman&#x27;s first year in office there were no lynchings, compared with 12 in Richardson&#x27;s last year, which Simkins attributed to Tillman&#x27;s &quot;vigorous attitude towards law enforcement&quot;. Tillman called out the militia multiple times to prevent lynchings, and corresponded with sheriffs, passing along information and rumors of contemplated lynchings. The governor pressed for a law requiring the segregation of railroad cars: opposed by railroad companies and the few black legislators, the bill passed the state House of Representatives but failed in the Senate. Tillman&#x27;s calls to redistrict away the one congressional district dominated by African Americans, and for a constitutional convention to disenfranchise them also fell in the Senate, where the convention proposal failed to attract the necessary two-thirds majority. The only enactment that struck at the African American in Tillman&#x27;s first term imposed a prohibitive tax on labor agents, who were recruiting local farm hands to move out of state.

In December 1891, soon after the first anniversary of Tillman&#x27;s taking office, a black Edgefield man named Dick Lundy was charged with murdering the sheriff&#x27;s son, and was taken from the jail and lynched. Tillman sent the state solicitor to Edgefield to investigate the matter, and ridiculed the coroner&#x27;s jury verdict. As usual in cases of lynching, it stated the deceased had been killed by persons unknown. Tillman said, &quot;the law received a wound for every bullet shot into Dick Lundy&#x27;s body.&quot; The &quot;News and Courier&quot; opined that had he been present &quot;with true Edgefield instinct, [Tillman] would probably have been hanging around on the edge of the mob&quot;.

In April 1893, Mamie Baxter, a fourteen-year-old girl in Denmark, Barnwell County, alleged that an African American unknown to her had attempted to attack her. About twenty black men were detained and paraded before her; she stated that Henry Williams looked something like the man she had seen. Placed on what passed for a trial by the mob that took him from the jail, Williams produced several respected white men to support his alibi. A majority of the mob voted against killing him, and Williams was returned to jail. More searches were made for Baxter&#x27;s attacker. A suspect in the case, John Peterson, appealed to Tillman for protection, fearing he would be lynched if taken to Denmark, and stating he could prove his innocence. Tillman sent Peterson to Denmark with a single guard. He was taken by the mob, put on &quot;trial&quot;, and after the mob found him guilty, was murdered. There was widespread outrage among both races across the country, both at the actions of the lynchers and at what Tillman had done. The governor said, in response, that he had assumed that, as the mob had been convinced by Williams&#x27; defense, it would allow Peterson to prove his innocence as well. He thereafter ignored the issue of the Denmark lynching.

There were five lynchings in South Carolina during Tillman&#x27;s first term, and thirteen during his second. Tillman had to walk a narrow line in the debates over lynching, since most of his supporters believed in the collective right of white men in a community to dispense mob justice, especially in cases of alleged rape. Yet as governor, he was sworn to uphold the rule of law. He attempted to finesse the matter by seeking to appeal to both sides, demanding that the law be followed, but that he would, as he stated in 1892, &quot;willingly lead a mob in lynching a Negro who had committed an assault on a white woman&quot;. Under criticism, he amended this to a willingness to lead the lynching of &quot;a man of any color who assaults a virtuous woman of any color&quot;—the adjective &quot;virtuous&quot; limiting the commitment, in Tillman&#x27;s view, to assaults on white women.

During Tillman&#x27;s second term, he had the legislature pass a bill to abolish elected local government, in favor of gubernatorial appointment of municipal and county officials. Tillman used this law to oust black officials even where that race held a voting majority. In September 1893, South Carolina was hit by storms. Tillman discouraged northerners from sending aid to African Americans, fearing it would result in &quot;lazy, idle crowds [wanting to] draw rations, as in the days of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau ... They cannot be treated as we would white people.&quot;

During the 1895 South Carolina state constitutional convention, however, Tillman supported a provision that permitted the removal from office of sheriffs who through negligence or connivance permitted a lynching. He also supported a provision that held the county where the lynching occurred liable for damages of $2,000 or more to be paid to the heirs of the victim.

==== Alcohol and the dispensary ====
The question of prohibition of alcohol was a major issue in South Carolina during Tillman&#x27;s governorship. Tillman opposed banning alcohol, but was careful to speak well of temperance advocates, many of whom were women. The concern Tillman had with alcohol issues was that they divided the white community, leaving openings for black Republicans to exploit.

In the 1892 election, South Carolinians passed a non-binding referendum calling for prohibition. Bills were introduced into both houses of the state legislature that December to accomplish this, and passed the House of Representatives. Before the House bill could be passed by the Senate, Tillman sent a proposal in the form of an amendment, with instructions to pass the amended bill, and enact nothing else on the subject. Based on a system that had been successful in Athens, Georgia, the bill banned the private sale of alcohol, setting up a system of dispensaries that would sell alcohol in sealed containers—sale by the drink, and consumption on the premises, would not be permitted. Both houses passed Tillman&#x27;s amendment, though there was opposition both within and outside the legislature. The dispensary system went into effect on July 1, 1893.

The new law was met with considerable resistance, especially in the towns and cities, where Tillman had less support. Dozens of clandestine saloons opened, fueled by barrels of illicit liquor, often transported by railroad. Tillman appointed dispensary constables, who tried to seize such shipments, to be frustrated by the fact that the South Carolina Railroad was in federal receivership, and state authorities could not confiscate goods entrusted to it. All of Tillman&#x27;s constables were white, placing him at a disadvantage in dealing with the alcohol trade among African Americans. Some of the constables tried going undercover by blacking their faces like minstrels; later, Tillman hired an African-American detective from Georgia.

The small city of Darlington became a center of the bootlegging trade, with many illegal saloons. Tillman repeatedly warned the local mayor to crack down; when this did not occur, in April 1894, Tillman sent a train full of constables and other enforcement personnel to Darlington. They were repelled by gunfire, with dead on both sides. Tillman called out the state militia, which put down the unrest, though some units refused to serve. After the incident, Tillman disbanded the units of the militia that had refused his orders, and organized new companies to serve in their place. The Darlington riot divided the state politically as Tillman prepared to seek Butler&#x27;s seat in the Senate, which would be filled by the legislature in December 1894.

Only weeks after the Darlington affair, the South Carolina Supreme Court declared the act creating the dispensary system in violation of the state constitution on the grounds that the government had no right to run a profit-making business. The vote was 2–1, with Justice Samuel McGowan in the majority. McGowan was a lame duck in office; Lieutenant Governor Gary had been elected to fill his seat effective August 1, 1894. Tillman closed the dispensaries temporarily, resulting in prohibition in South Carolina, and fired the constables. He had taken the precaution, once the court agreed to take the dispensary case, of having the 1893 legislature pass a revised dispensary law. When Gary took the bench, the Tillmanites would have a majority on the state Supreme Court, and Tillman instructed trial justices not to hear challenges to the 1893 law until after August 1. Tillman kept the law suspended until then, afterwards reopening the dispensaries under that statute. The high court declared the 1893 act constitutional on October 8, 1894, 2–1, with Gary voting in the majority.

==== Agriculture and higher education ====

Elected with support from the Farmers&#x27; Alliance and as a result of agricultural protest, Tillman was thought likely to join the Populists in their challenge to the established parties. Tillman refused, and generally opposed Populist positions that went beyond his program of increasing access to higher education and reform of the Democratic Party (white supremacy was not a Populist position). The Alliance (and Populists) demanded a system of subtreasuries under the federal government, that could accept farmers&#x27; crops and advance them 80 percent of the value interest-free. Tillman, not wanting more federal officeholders in the state (that in Republican administrations might be filled by African Americans), initially opposed the proposal. Many farmers felt strongly about this issue, and in 1891, Tillman was censured by the state Alliance for his opposition. Attuned to political necessities, Tillman gradually came to support the subtreasuries in time for his re-election campaign in 1892, though he was never an active proponent.

Tillman spoke at the opening of Clemson College on July 6, 1893. He fulfilled his campaign promise to start a women&#x27;s college. In 1891, the legislature passed a bill creating the South Carolina Industrial and Winthrop Normal College (today Winthrop University). He took a personal interest in the bidding by various towns around the state for the new school, and supported the successful candidate, the progressive town of Rock Hill, on the state&#x27;s northern border. Rock Hill officials had offered land, cash, and building materials. The school, then admitting only white women, opened in October 1895, after Tillman had become a senator.

==== Re-election in 1892 ====
Tillman sought election to a second two-year term in 1892, presenting himself as a reforming alternative to the Conservatives. In the campaign, Tillman was a strong supporter of free silver or bimetallism, making silver legal tender at the historic ratio to gold of 16:1. Such a policy would inflate the currency, and Tillman felt that would make it easier for the farmer to repay debts. The rhetoric of free silver suited Tillman as well, as he could make himself appear the champion of the farmer against the powerful interests that had committed the &quot;Crime of &#x27;73&quot; (as silver supporters termed the act ending bimetallism in the United States).

Announcing that a primary for 1892, as had been prescribed two years before, was anti-reform, Tillman put off the first Democratic gubernatorial primary in the state until 1894. Thus, the nominee would be chosen by a convention, and mid-1892 saw a lengthy series of debates between Tillman and his challenger, former governor John C. Sheppard. The bitter campaign was marked by violence, often set off by provocative language from the candidates. According to Kantrowitz, Tillman &quot;sought to prolong the confrontation, to take the crowd up to the edge of violence, demonstrating his identification with his farmers without quite provoking them to murder&quot;. When former senator Hampton attempted to speak on Sheppard&#x27;s behalf, he was shouted down by Tillman partisans; opponents complained that Tillman&#x27;s supporters had formed a mob, and that the governor was a true son of violent Edgefield.

As the likely Democratic presidential candidate for 1892, former president Grover Cleveland, was a staunch opponent of free silver, Tillman attacked Cleveland. Most of the South Carolina delegation, including Tillman, voted against Cleveland at the convention, but when the former president was nominated, the governor worked to deliver South Carolina for Cleveland by an overwhelming margin. Cleveland was elected, but the new president was offended by Tillman&#x27;s earlier attacks, and denied the governor any role in patronage in South Carolina, entrusting it to Senator Matthew Butler and other remaining Conservatives. Tillman&#x27;s inability to provide federal jobs for supporters made it more difficult for him to hold his coalition together. Tillman continued his verbal assaults, stating that Cleveland &quot;is an old bag of beef and I am going to Washington with a pitchfork and prod him in his old fat ribs&quot;—thus popularizing Tillman as &quot;Pitchfork Ben&quot;.

During the 1892 campaign, Tillman called for the defeat in the Democratic primary for the legislature of most of the men elected as his supporters, urging the selection of more loyal men. Tillman urged the voters, &quot;turn out this cattle, these driftwood legislators, and send me a legislature that will do what I say, and I&#x27;ll show you reform.&quot; South Carolinians dutifully voted out their representatives as Tillman requested. Although no primary for governor was permitted, the delegates to the nominating convention were elected by the Democratic voters, and Tillman won an overwhelming victory over Sheppard, who took only four of 35 counties. The convention was mostly Tillmanite, and gave the governor an easy triumph. The Conservatives had agreed not to bolt the party, and Tillman won uncontested re-election.

=== Senate election of 1894 ===

Tillman had long seen a Senate seat as a logical next step once he concluded his time as governor. Senator Butler, whose term expired in March 1895, had soon after the 1890 election begun to shift his positions towards Tillman&#x27;s, hoping to retain Conservative backing while appealing to the governor&#x27;s supporters. The senator signed on to most demands of the Farmers&#x27; Alliance, and did not support the forces trying to prevent Tillman&#x27;s re-nomination in 1892. Butler&#x27;s seeming apostasy disheartened Conservatives, who did not bother to run candidates for the legislature in many counties in 1894, abandoning the field (and Butler&#x27;s Senate seat) to the Tillmanites. The governor took nothing for granted, seeing to it that popular candidates, loyal to him, ran for the legislature. In addition to electing Tillman to the Senate, these legislators could help preserve his gubernatorial legacy, including the dispensary.

Butler was aware of the uphill struggle he faced, and called for a primary for senator, with all Democratic legislators committed to vote to elect the winner. Tillman, who had already finalized his plans to win in the legislature, refused. The series of debates that marked a campaign summer in South Carolina began on June 18, 1894. Butler believed he could still win by appealing to the electorate in the same manner as Tillman; the senator thought he understood the lessons of 1876 as well as anyone. In the debates, Butler and Tillman matched slander for slander, with Butler claiming that at Hamburg, when the shooting started, Tillman was &quot;nowhere to be found&quot;. Tillman shot back that when Butler had testified before Congress about Hamburg, he had downplayed his role in the events. According to Kantrowitz, &quot;their struggle over the legacy of 1876 was in part over who could more legitimately claim to have murdered&quot; African Americans. Tillman&#x27;s partisans shouted down Butler when he tried to speak at some debates. Although this tactic had been used by Butler and other Democrats against the Republicans in 1876, Butler now decried it as &quot;not Christian civilization to howl anyone down&quot;.

Balked again, Butler attempted to turn the campaign personal, calling Tillman a liar and trying to strike him. Tillman warned that Butler&#x27;s tactics risked sundering white unity, stating to a questioner who asked why he did not meet Butler&#x27;s insults with violence, &quot;Yes, I tell you, you cowardly hound, why I took them [the insults], and I&#x27;ll meet you wherever you want to. I took them because I, as governor of the State, could not afford to create a row at a public meeting and have our people murder each other like dogs.&quot;

By early July, Butler had realized the futility of his race, and took to ignoring Tillman in his speeches, which the governor reciprocated, taking much of the drama from the debates. The two men even rode in the same carriage on July 4. Nevertheless, Butler refused to surrender, even after the primary for the legislature was overwhelmingly won by the Tillmanites, threatening action in the courts and an election contest before the Senate. On December 11, 1894, Tillman was elected to the Senate by the new legislature with 131 votes. Butler received 21 and three votes were scattered.

=== Disenfranchising the African American: 1895 state constitutional convention ===
Throughout his time as governor, Tillman had sought a convention to rewrite South Carolina&#x27;s Reconstruction-era constitution. His main purpose in doing so was to disenfranchise African Americans. They opposed Tillman&#x27;s proposal, as did others, who had seen previous efforts to restrict the franchise rebound against white voters. Tillman was successful in getting the legislature to place a referendum for a constitutional convention on the November 1894 general election ballot. It passed by 2,000 votes statewide, the narrow margin gained, according to Kantrowitz, most likely through fraud. John Gary Evans was elected Tillman&#x27;s successor as governor.

Opponents sued in the courts to overturn the referendum result; they were unsuccessful. During the convention, Tillman hailed it as &quot;a fitting capstone to the triumphal arch which the common people have erected to liberty, progress, and Anglo-Saxon civilization since 1890&quot;. To assure white unity, Tillman allowed the election of Conservatives as about a third of delegates. The convention assembled in Columbia in September 1895, consisting of 112 Tillmanites, 42 Conservatives, and six African Americans. Tillman called black disenfranchisement &quot;the sole cause of our being here&quot;.

Tillman was the dominant figure of the convention, chairing the Committee on the Rights of Suffrage, which was to craft language to accomplish the disenfranchisement. Constrained by the requirement of the federal Fifteenth Amendment that men of all races be allowed to vote, the committee sought language that, though superficially nondiscriminatory, would operate or could be used to take the vote from most African Americans.

Tillman spoke to the convention on October 31. In addition to supporting the provisions of the draft document, he recalled 1876:

The adopted provisions, which came into force after the new constitution was ratified by the convention in December 1895, set a maze of obstacles before prospective voters. Voters had to be a resident of the state two years, the county one year, and the precinct for four months. Many African Americans were itinerant laborers, and this provision disproportionately affected them. A poll tax had to be paid six months in advance of the election, in May when laborers had the least cash. Each registrant had to prove to the satisfaction of the county board of elections that he could read or write a section of the state constitution (in a literacy or comprehension test), or that he paid taxes on property valued at $300 or more. This allowed white registrars ample discretion to disenfranchise African Americans. Illiterate whites were shielded by the &quot;understanding&quot; clause, that allowed, until 1898, permanent registration to citizens who could &quot;understand&quot; the constitution when read to them. This also allowed officials great leeway to discriminate. Even if an African American maneuvered past all of these obstacles, he still faced the manager of the polling place, who could demand proof he had paid all taxes owed—something difficult to show conclusively. Conviction of any of a long list of crimes that whites believed prevalent among African Americans was made the cause of permanent disenfranchisement, including bigamy, adultery, burglary, and arson. Convicted murderers not in prison had their franchise undisturbed.

Tillman defended this on the floor of the Senate:

In my State there were 135,000 negro voters, or negroes of voting age, and some 90,000 or 95,000 white voters... Now, I want to ask you, with a free vote and a fair count, how are you going to beat 135,000 by 95,000? How are you going to do it? You had set us an impossible task.We did not disfranchise the negroes until 1895. Then we had a constitutional convention convened which took the matter up calmly, deliberately, and avowedly with the purpose of disfranchising as many of them as we could under the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments. We adopted the educational qualification as the only means left to us, and the negro is as contented and as prosperous and as well protected in South Carolina to-day as in any State of the Union south of the Potomac. He is not meddling with politics, for he found that the more he meddled with them the worse off he got. As to his &quot;rights&quot;—I will not discuss them now. We of the South have never recognized the right of the negro to govern white men, and we never will... I would to God the last one of them was in Africa and that none of them had ever been brought to our shores.

=== 1896 presidential bid ===

By early 1896, many in the Democratic Party were bitterly opposed to President Cleveland and his policies. The United States was by then in the third year of a deep recession, the Panic of 1893. Cleveland was a firm supporter of the gold standard, and soon after the recession began forced through repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which he believed had helped cause it. Sherman&#x27;s act, although not restoring bimetallism, had required the government to purchase and coin large quantities of silver bullion, and its repeal outraged supporters of free silver. Other Cleveland policies, such as his forcible suppression of the Pullman Strike, led to the Democrats losing control of both houses of Congress in the 1894 midterm elections, and to a revolt against him by silver supporters within his party.
From the time of his swearing-in in December 1895 (when Congress began its annual session), Tillman was seen as the voice of the dissatisfied in the nation; the &quot;New York Press&quot; stated Tillman would voice the concerns of &quot;the masses of the people of South Carolina far more faithfully than did the Bourbon politician Butler&quot;. He shocked the Senate with dramatic attacks on Cleveland, calling the president &quot;the most gigantic failure of any man who ever occupied the White House, all because of his vanity and obstinacy&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; deemed Tillman &quot;a filthy baboon, accidentally seated in the Senate chamber&quot;.

Tillman believed that the nation was on the verge of major political change, and that he could be elected president in 1896, uniting the silver supporters of the South and West. He was willing to consider a third party bid if Cleveland kept control of the Democratic Party, but felt the Populists, by allowing African Americans to seek office, had destroyed their credibility among southern whites. The stinging oratory of the South Carolina senator brought him national prominence, and with the 1896 Democratic National Convention in Chicago likely to be controlled by silver supporters, Tillman was spoken of as a possible presidential candidate along with others, such as former Missouri representative Richard P. Bland, Texas Governor Jim Hogg, and former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan.

Tillman was his state&#x27;s favorite son candidate, and its representative on the Committee on Resolutions (often called &quot;the Platform Committee&quot;). The platform had the support of the pro-silver majority of the committee, but the gold minority, led by New York Senator David B. Hill, opposed its support of free silver, and wanted to take the disagreement to the convention floor. With one hour and fifteen minutes allocated to each side, Tillman and Bryan were selected as the speakers in favor of the draft platform. Bryan asked Tillman if he wanted to open or close the debate; the senator wanted to close, but sought fifty minutes to do so. The Nebraskan replied that Hill would oppose such a long closing address, and Tillman agreed to open the debate, with Bryan to close it.

When the platform debate began in the Chicago Coliseum on the morning of July 9, 1896, Tillman was the opening speaker. Although met with applause and shouts of his name, he &quot;spoke in the same manner that had won him success in South Carolina, cursing, haranguing his enemies, and raising the specter of sectionalism. He, however, thoroughly alienated the national audience&quot;. According to Richard Bensel in his study of the 1896 convention, Tillman gave &quot;by far, the most divisive speech of the convention, an address that embarrassed the silver wing of the party as much as it enraged the hard-money faction&quot;. He deemed silver a sectional issue, pitting the wealthy East against the oppressed South and West. This upset delegates, who wished to view silver as a patriotic, national issue, and some voiced their dissent, disagreeing with Tillman. The senator alternately offended, confused, and bored the delegates, who shouted for Tillman to stop even though less than half of his time had expired. Beset by shouting delegates and one of the convention bands, which unexpectedly appeared and began to play, Tillman nevertheless pressed on, &quot;the audience might just as well understand that I am going to have my say if I stand here until sundown.&quot; By the time he had his say, he had &quot;effectively destroyed his chances to become a national candidate&quot;. With Tillman&#x27;s candidacy stillborn (only his home state voted for him), Bryan seized the opportunity to deliver an address in support of silver that did not rely on sectionalism. His Cross of Gold speech won him the presidential nomination.
After Tillman returned from Chicago to South Carolina, he suggested he had delivered an intentionally radical speech so as to allow Bryan to look statesmanlike by comparison. This interpretation was mocked by his enemies. Tillman is not known to have otherwise discussed his feelings at the failure of his presidential bid, and the political grief was likely overwhelmed by personal sadness a week after the convention when his beloved daughter Addie died, struck by lightning on a North Carolina mountain. Tillman campaigned for Bryan, but was a favorite target of cartoonists denigrating the Democratic candidate and supporting the Republican, former Ohio governor William McKinley. Bryan had also been nominated by the Populists, who selected their own vice presidential candidate, Georgia&#x27;s Thomas E. Watson. Tillman was active in efforts to get Watson to withdraw, having a 12-hour meeting with the candidate, apparently without result. Tillman traveled widely to speak on Bryan&#x27;s behalf, and drew large crowds, but his speeches were of little significance. Despite undertaking an arduous campaign, Bryan lost the election. Simkins suggested that Tillman, by helping forge an image of the Democratic Party as anarchic, contributed to Bryan&#x27;s defeat.

=== Wild man of the Senate: Tillman-McLaurin fistfight ===
Kantrowitz deemed Tillman &quot;the Senate&#x27;s wild man&quot;, who applied the same techniques of accusation and insinuation that had served him well in South Carolina. In 1897, Tillman accused the Republicans, &quot;I certainly do not want to attack any member of the committee who does not deserve to be attacked [but] nobody denies that there have been rooms occupied for two months by the Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee at the Arlington Hotel ... in easy reach of the sugar trust&quot;. Simkins, though, opined that Tillman&#x27;s speeches in the Senate were only inflammatory because of his injection of personalities, and if that is disregarded, his speeches, when read, come across as well-reasoned and even conservative.

In 1902, Tillman accused his junior colleague from South Carolina, John L. McLaurin, of corruption in a speech to the Senate. McLaurin, who had been a Tillmanite before breaking from him after being elected to the Senate, called him a liar, whereupon Tillman rushed across the Senate floor and punched McLaurin in the face; McLaurin responded by punching Tillman in the nose before the Sergeant at Arms and other Senators intervened. The body immediately went into closed session, and held both men in contempt.

The Senate considered suspending them, but Tillman argued that it was unfair to deprive South Carolina of her representation, though the body could have also expelled the two men, knowing he had enough Democratic votes to prevent this. In the end, both men were censured, and later that year, Tillman arranged for McLaurin, whose term ended in 1903, to not be re-elected.

The fracas with McLaurin caused President Theodore Roosevelt, who had succeeded the assassinated McKinley in 1901, to withdraw an invitation to dinner at the White House. Tillman never forgave this slight, and became a bitter enemy of Roosevelt.

Tillman was inclined to oppose Roosevelt anyway, who soon after becoming president, dined at the White House with Booker T. Washington, an African American. Tillman responded by saying &quot;the action of President Roosevelt in entertaining that nigger will necessitate our killing a thousand niggers in the South before they learn their place again.&quot;

=== Race relations ===
Tillman believed, and often stated as senator, that blacks must submit to either white domination or extermination. He was reluctant to undertake the latter, fearing hundreds of whites would die accomplishing it. He campaigned in the violent 1898 North Carolina elections, in which white Democrats were determined to take back control from a biracial Populist-Republican coalition elected in 1894 and 1896 on a fusion ticket. He spoke widely in North Carolina in late 1898, often to crowds wearing red shirts, disheartening his Populist supporters. On October 20, 1898, Tillman was the featured speaker at the Democratic Party&#x27;s Great White Man&#x27;s Rally and Basket Picnic in Fayetteville. Tillman spoke furiously to the crowd of white men, asking them why North Carolina had not rid itself of black office holders as South Carolina had in 1876. He chastized the audience for not lynching Alex Manly, the black editor of the Wilmington &quot;Daily Record&quot;. Tillman was one of many prominent Democrats advocating use of violence to win the 1898 election. The resulting coup expelled opposition black and white political leaders from Wilmington, destroyed the property and businesses of black citizens built up since the Civil War, including the only black newspaper in the city, and killed an estimated 60 to more than 300 people. Terror and intimidation again won the day for the Democrats, who were elected statewide. South Carolina saw violence as well: an effort to register black voters in Phoenix led whites to provoke a confrontation, after which a number of African Americans were murdered. Tillman warned African Americans and those who might combine with them that black political activism would provoke a murderous response from whites.

Beginning in 1901, Tillman joined the Chautauqua circuit, giving well-paid speeches throughout the nation. Tillman&#x27;s reputation, both for his views and his oratory, attracted large crowds. Tillman informed them that African Americans were inferior to the white man, but were not baboons, though some were &quot;so near akin to the monkey that scientists are yet looking for the missing link&quot;. Given that in Africa, they were an &quot;ignorant and debased and debauched race&quot; with a record of &quot;barbarism, savagery, cannibalism and everything that is low and degrading&quot;, it was the &quot;quintessence of folly&quot; to believe that the black man should be placed on an equal footing with his white counterpart. Tillman &quot;embraced segregation as divinely imperative&quot;.

Tillman told the Senate, &quot;as governor of South Carolina, I proclaimed that, although I had taken the oath of office to support the law and enforce it, I would lead a mob to lynch any man, black or white, who ravished a woman, black or white.&quot; He told his colleagues, &quot;I have three daughters, but, so help me God, I had rather find either one of them killed by a tiger or a bear [and die a virgin] than to have her crawl to me and tell me the horrid story that she had been robbed of the jewel of her womanhood by a black fiend.&quot; In 1907, he told the senators about the Ellenton riot of 1876, &quot;it was then that we shot them; it was then that we killed them; it was then that we stuffed the ballot-boxes.&quot; 

As South Carolina&#x27;s economy changed in the early 20th century, with textile mills being built, Tillman complained that some African Americans were evading the supervision they would have on the farm, fearing the threat to white women. He admitted that it would be unjust to kill all of these workers, &quot;because we might kill some innocent men, but we can keep them on the chain gang&quot;.

=== Legislative activities and re-elections ===

Tillman was an early and fervent backer of war with Spain in 1898. However, he opposed taking the Spanish colonies such as Puerto Rico and the Philippines, both because he considered it wrong to annex people to the United States without their consent, and out of opposition to adding territories with large numbers of non-whites. Tillman mocked the Republicans, most of whom supported annexation rather than self-determination, stating that it was that party that since 1860 had claimed &quot;that all men, including the Negro, are free and equal,&quot; and was annoyed when they refused to admit their positions were inconsistent.

In 1906, Roosevelt backed the Hepburn Bill, imposing railroad regulation. Many Republicans initially wanted nothing to do with the bill, and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich entrusted management of the bill to Tillman. Aldrich hoped the outspoken South Carolinian would cause the defeat of the bill. To Aldrich&#x27;s surprise, Tillman soberly and competently conducted the bill through much of the legislative process. Tillman withdrew from the bill (though he voted for it) after Roosevelt got a provision for federal court review of agency decisions included, which Tillman opposed. The president and the southern senator ended on worse terms than before, but there was great public attention on the Hepburn Bill, and Tillman gained considerable respect for his role.

This activity caused a public reassessment of Tillman, who was best known for giving speeches that shocked the North and made even southerners cringe. Writers suggested he was merely presenting an image as &quot;Pitchfork Ben&quot;, that he could turn on and off as needed. He came to be regarded in the North as acceptable and even respectable, with some suggesting he had matured during his time in the Senate. &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; compared Tillman with a coconut; hard, rough, and shaggy on the outside, but within, &quot;the milk of human kindness&quot;.

Tillman was the primary sponsor of the Tillman Act, the first federal campaign finance reform law, which was passed in 1907 and which banned corporate contributions in federal political campaigns. Justice Clarence Thomas has suggested that Tillman&#x27;s motivation in introducing this legislation was to reduce the power of corporations which tended to favor Republicans and African Americans.

When Tillman entered the Senate in 1895, he was opposed to expansion of the United States Navy, fearing the expenditure would cause the issuance of bonds by the president, which he felt would only enrich the wealthy. Tillman sat on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and soon came to understand that South Carolina could benefit from naval appropriations steered towards her. A flow of federal funds to his home state resulted, beginning in 1900, followed by the establishment, in 1909, of the Charleston Naval Shipyard. Once Democrats took control of the Senate for the first time in Tillman&#x27;s tenure, in 1913, he became chairman of the committee and allied with others from the southeast (such as Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, a North Carolinian) to see that the bulk of naval appropriations would be spent there. In 1912 Tillman requested the US Navy determine the maximum size of battleship that could be produced. Over the next four years, the Navy developed a series of designs, called the Tillman battleship or maximum battleship, that were significantly larger and more powerful than any battleship in service in the world. The Navy submitted the Tillman IV-2 design to Congress, but the US entry into World War I and the Washington Naval Treaty afterward put an end to such fantastic designs.

Tillman also served as chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary Claims (57th through 59th Congresses) and on the Committee on Five Civilized Tribes of Indians (61st and 62nd Congresses). Strokes in 1908 and 1910 decreased his influence and ability in the Senate; his seniority entitled him to become Senate Appropriations Committee chairman in 1913, but his health did not permit it.
President Woodrow Wilson was inaugurated in 1913, the first Democrat to hold the office since Cleveland. Tillman supported Wilson&#x27;s legislation in the Senate, except on women&#x27;s suffrage, where he was a strong opponent. He was uneasy when Wilson&#x27;s Secretary of State, Bryan, tried to prevent war through treaty-making, describing the former presidential candidate as the &quot;evangel of peace at any price&quot;. When the United States entered World War I, Tillman was a strong supporter, seeing the conflict as democratic nations against German &quot;slaves ... and not free men at all&quot;. Although he urged vigilance against spies, once he was satisfied that the accusations against German-born Friedrich Johannes Hugo von Engelken, president of the Federal Land Bank at Columbia, were unfounded, he spoke in support of the man.

Tillman had been re-elected in 1901 and 1907. By 1912, the Democratic nominee, who would be elected by the overwhelming Democratic majority in the legislature, was determined by a primary. A primary was also used for governor, and Tillman ran at the same time as Governor Cole Blease, who also sought re-election. Blease, also an outspoken white supremacist, had entered politics as a Tillmanite legislator in 1890, and breaking from him, adopted similar techniques to Tillman&#x27;s to appeal to poor farm workers and mill hands. Tillman faced two opponents in his re-nomination bid—his control over South Carolina politics had deteriorated over the years, and he had moved towards the Conservatives. He had not endorsed Blease in 1910. The two men reached an agreement that Tillman would remain neutral in the governor&#x27;s race in 1912, but Tillman became convinced Blease could not win against former state chief justice Ira B. Jones. Both sides claimed to have letters from Tillman endorsing their candidate, but three days before the primary, Tillman condemned Blease and endorsed Jones. Blease, outraged, alleged betrayal, accused Tillman of &quot;insane jealousy&quot;, and said of the senator, &quot;possibly his mind has become more diseased of late than it was when I had my last talk with his confidential physician&quot;. Both men were re-elected.

===Final years and death===

The Seventeenth Amendment, ratified in 1913, gave the people the right to elect senators, but this made little difference in South Carolina, where the Democratic primary remained decisive. Tillman in 1914 announced plans to retire when his term expired in 1919, but the war and the threat that Blease would win the open seat caused him to announce his candidacy for a fifth term in March 1918. Tillman remained for the most part in Washington, and did not campaign, but came to Columbia for the state Democratic convention in May to discredit rumors about his health, which was indeed poor. He got Wilson to persuade one of his rivals, Congressman Asbury F. Lever, to abandon the race, and considered how to do the same to Blease. These plans had not yet come to fruition when Tillman was stricken by a cerebral hemorrhage at the end of June, and died July 3, 1918, in Washington, D.C. He is buried in Ebenezer Cemetery, Trenton, South Carolina.

Tillman&#x27;s death generated a large number of tributes to him in the Senate, which were afterwards collected in book form. One copy came into the hands of Blease, who was angry that Tillman was being lauded, and stated that the late senator was not what he had seemed. He wrote in front of the volume, &quot;Don&#x27;t believe me, but look up his life &amp; see.&quot; When Manly, who had barely escaped the Wilmington Insurrection, read of his death in 1918, he said to his wife, &quot;I wonder who is making hash out of him in hell tonight.&quot;

== Legacy and historical view ==

According to Orville Burton, &quot;Tillman&#x27;s legacy for South Carolina and the nation is controversial and disturbing. White and black South Carolinians interpret Tillman&#x27;s accomplishments in contradictory ways.&quot; A national hero to white supremacists, according to an article on Tillman for &quot;The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education&quot;, &quot;for African Americans, he was the &#x27;devil incarnate. No African American was elected to Congress under the 1895 constitution until the civil rights movement, nor were any elected to statewide or county office after 1900.

Simkins, a son of Edgefield, while recognizing faults in Tillman&#x27;s racial policies, stated that &quot;no South Carolinian, with the single exception of Calhoun, has ever made a profounder impression on his generation than Tillman.&quot; The late senator&#x27;s supporters and protégés remained long in South Carolina, encouraging a view of Tillman as a great man in state and national history. James F. Byrnes, for example, repeated Tillman&#x27;s themes of race war on the floor of the House of Representatives in 1919. In 1940, Byrnes, by then a senator and soon to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court, dedicated a statue of Tillman outside the South Carolina State House and called him the state&#x27;s &quot;first New Dealer&quot;. Protestors have since asked for that statue to be removed. Others who knew and at one time admired Tillman included Strom Thurmond, son of Tillman&#x27;s Edgefield attorney, who saw and was inspired by Tillman&#x27;s campaigning style as a boy. Other Southerners were highly negative: Lyndon B. Johnson said of Tillman, &quot;He might have been president. I&#x27;d like to sit down with him and ask how it was to throw it away for the sake of hating.&quot;
Simkins noted that Tillman &quot;rose above the handicap of his radical views, his obstreperousness, and the insularity of his issues to become a considerable force in national politics&quot;. Historian I. M. Newby deemed Tillmanism the closest thing to a mass movement in the history of white South Carolinians, and one that dominated the state for a generation. &quot;To students of black history and racial equality its most striking features are the extent to which it expressed the desire of white Carolinians to dominate blacks and the fact that much of its unity and force derived from its antiblack racial policies.&quot; Tillman&#x27;s movement took power from the Bourbon Democrats in South Carolina, but a greater price was paid, electorally and in lives, by African Americans.

In 1962, Main Building on the campus of Winthrop College was renamed Tillman Hall in his honor. On June 19, 2020, Winthrop University&#x27;s Board of Trustees passed unanimously a resolution requesting South Carolina state legislators to consider amending the Heritage Act of 2000 to &quot;allow Winthrop to restore Tillman Hall to its original name of Main Building.&quot; Clemson University also has a Tillman Hall, though efforts have been made to change the name, and on June 12, 2020, the university&#x27;s board of trustees requested the legislature to authorize a name change back to &quot;Main Building&quot;. Kantrowitz argued that Tillman deserves little credit for what have become important Southern schools, integrated and coeducational:

<text>The &quot;Maximum battleships,&quot; also known as the &quot;Tillman battleships,&quot; were a series of World War I-era design studies for extremely large battleships, prepared in late 1916 and early 1917 upon the order of Senator &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Benjamin Tillman by the Bureau of Construction and Repair (C&amp;R) of the United States Navy. They helped influence design work on the and first &quot;South Dakota&quot; classes of battleships. The plans prepared for the senator were preserved by C&amp;R in the first of its &quot;Spring Styles&quot; books, where it kept various warship designs conceptualized between 1911 and 1925. “Maximum battleships” referred to the largest-possible battleships the U.S. Navy could afford to construct and field while still being able to utilize the Panama Canal.

==Context==
During the years leading up to World War I, some members of the U.S. Congress were growing frustrated with what they perceived to be chronic overspending by the U.S. Navy on battleships.
The only limits on the potential size of an American battleship were the dimensions of the locks of the Panama Canal. The locks measure roughly , and so the &quot;maximum battleships&quot; were . The Panamax draft limit during the designing of these battleships was , however the Department of the Navy required that all designs be limited to only in draft.

==Designs==

Tillman&#x27;s first request for designs of so-called &quot;maximum battleship&quot; in 1912–1913 led to several estimates for battleships unconstrained by cost. Created by the US Navy Bureau of Construction and Repair (C&amp;R), these ships would displace up to and carry 14 inch guns. Although C&amp;R was &quot;appalled,&quot; in the words of naval historian Norman Friedman, by the extravagance of these designs, they admitted that far larger warships could transit the Panama Canal&#x27;s locks, which, due to the US&#x27;s geography, were often held to be the final limiting factor on the size of a US warship. Such larger designs would be often and seriously proposed within only a few years.

In 1916, Tillman repeated his request, and C&amp;R produced another series of design studies. C&amp;R drew up four blueprints, all ships having varying characteristics despite being built on the same hull:
==Comparisons to other US Navy battleships==
The Tillman designs all included five casemate guns mounted aft, two on each side and one at the tip of the stern. Similar &quot;stern chasers&quot; had been previously mounted in &quot;Nevada&quot;, but were omitted from the . These casemates were a return to an older design idea; American battleship designers had abandoned hull-mounted casemates after the . They had transpired to be too &quot;wet&quot; – heavy seas rendered them unusableand they had been removed from all earlier classes.

==Fate of the designed battleships==
The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited naval armaments, causing the cancellation of the &quot;South Dakota&quot;s and halting all consideration of the &quot;maximum battleships.&quot;

<text>Selective breeding (also called artificial selection) is the process by which humans use animal breeding and plant breeding to selectively develop particular phenotypic traits (characteristics) by choosing which typically animal or plant males and females will sexually reproduce and have offspring together. Domesticated animals are known as breeds, normally bred by a professional breeder, while domesticated plants are known as varieties, cultigens, cultivars, or breeds. Two purebred animals of different breeds produce a crossbreed, and crossbred plants are called hybrids. Flowers, vegetables and fruit-trees may be bred by amateurs and commercial or non-commercial professionals: major crops are usually the provenance of the professionals.

In animal breeding artificial selection is often combined with techniques such as inbreeding, linebreeding, and outcrossing. In plant breeding, similar methods are used. Charles Darwin discussed how selective breeding had been successful in producing change over time in his 1859 book, &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;. Its first chapter discusses selective breeding and domestication of such animals as pigeons, cats, cattle, and dogs. Darwin used artificial selection as an analogy to propose and explain the theory of natural selection but distinguished the latter from the former as a separate process that is non-directed.

The deliberate exploitation of selective breeding to produce desired results has become very common in agriculture and experimental biology.

Selective breeding can be unintentional, for example, resulting from the process of human cultivation; and it may also produce unintended – desirable or undesirable – results. For example, in some grains, an increase in seed size may have resulted from certain ploughing practices rather than from the intentional selection of larger seeds. Most likely, there has been an interdependence between natural and artificial factors that have resulted in plant domestication.

==History==
Selective breeding of both plants and animals has been practiced since prehistory; key species such as wheat, rice, and dogs have been significantly different from their wild ancestors for millennia, and maize, which required especially large changes from teosinte, its wild form, was selectively bred in Mesoamerica. Selective breeding was practiced by the Romans. Treatises as much as 2,000 years old give advice on selecting animals for different purposes, and these ancient works cite still older authorities, such as Mago the Carthaginian. The notion of selective breeding was later expressed by the Persian Muslim polymath Abu Rayhan Biruni in the 11th century. He noted the idea in his book titled &quot;India&quot;, which included various examples.

Selective breeding was established as a scientific practice by Robert Bakewell during the British Agricultural Revolution in the 18th century. Arguably, his most important breeding program was with sheep. Using native stock, he was able to quickly select for large, yet fine-boned sheep, with long, lustrous wool. The Lincoln Longwool was improved by Bakewell, and in turn the Lincoln was used to develop the subsequent breed, named the New (or Dishley) Leicester. It was hornless and had a square, meaty body with straight top lines.

These sheep were exported widely, including to Australia and North America, and have contributed to numerous modern breeds, despite the fact that they fell quickly out of favor as market preferences in meat and textiles changed. Bloodlines of these original New Leicesters survive today as the English Leicester (or Leicester Longwool), which is primarily kept for wool production.

Bakewell was also the first to breed cattle to be used primarily for beef. Previously, cattle were first and foremost kept for pulling ploughs as oxen, but he crossed long-horned heifers and a Westmoreland bull to eventually create the Dishley Longhorn. As more and more farmers followed his lead, farm animals increased dramatically in size and quality. In 1700, the average weight of a bull sold for slaughter was 370 pounds (168 kg). By 1786, that weight had more than doubled to 840 pounds (381 kg). However, after his death, the Dishley Longhorn was replaced with short-horn versions.

He also bred the Improved Black Cart horse, which later became the Shire horse.

Charles Darwin coined the term &#x27;selective breeding&#x27;; he was interested in the process as an illustration of his proposed wider process of natural selection. Darwin noted that many domesticated animals and plants had special properties that were developed by intentional animal and plant breeding from individuals that showed desirable characteristics, and discouraging the breeding of individuals with less desirable characteristics.

Darwin used the term &quot;artificial selection&quot; twice in the 1859 first edition of his work &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, in Chapter IV: Natural Selection, and in Chapter VI: Difficulties on Theory:

==Animal breeding==
Animals with homogeneous appearance, behavior, and other characteristics are known as particular breeds or pure breeds, and they are bred through culling animals with particular traits and selecting for further breeding those with other traits. Purebred animals have a single, recognizable breed, and purebreds with recorded lineage are called pedigreed. Crossbreeds are a mix of two purebreds, whereas mixed breeds are a mix of several breeds, often unknown. Animal breeding begins with breeding stock, a group of animals used for the purpose of planned breeding. When individuals are looking to breed animals, they look for certain valuable traits in purebred stock for a certain purpose, or may intend to use some type of crossbreeding to produce a new type of stock with different, and, it is presumed, superior abilities in a given area of endeavor. For example, to breed chickens, a breeder typically intends to receive eggs, meat, and new, young birds for further reproduction. Thus, the breeder has to study different breeds and types of chickens and analyze what can be expected from a certain set of characteristics before he or she starts breeding them. Therefore, when purchasing initial breeding stock, the breeder seeks a group of birds that will most closely fit the purpose intended.

Purebred breeding aims to establish and maintain stable traits, that animals will pass to the next generation. By &quot;breeding the best to the best,&quot; employing a certain degree of inbreeding, considerable culling, and selection for &quot;superior&quot; qualities, one could develop a bloodline superior in certain respects to the original base stock. Such animals can be recorded with a breed registry, the organization that maintains pedigrees and/or stud books. However, single-trait breeding, breeding for only one trait over all others, can be problematic. In one case mentioned by animal behaviorist Temple Grandin, roosters bred for fast growth or heavy muscles did not know how to perform typical rooster courtship dances, which alienated the roosters from hens and led the roosters to kill the hens after mating with them. A Soviet attempt to breed lab rats with higher intelligence led to cases of neurosis severe enough to make the animals incapable of any problem solving unless drugs like phenazepam were used.

The observable phenomenon of hybrid vigor stands in contrast to the notion of breed purity. However, on the other hand, indiscriminate breeding of crossbred or hybrid animals may also result in degradation of quality. Studies in evolutionary physiology, behavioral genetics, and other areas of organismal biology have also made use of deliberate selective breeding, though longer generation times and greater difficulty in breeding can make these projects challenging in such vertebrates as house mice.

== Plant breeding ==
The process of plant breeding has been used for thousands of years, and began with the domestication of wild plants into uniform and predictable agricultural cultigens. These high-yielding varieties have been particularly important in agriculture. As crops improved, humans were able to move from hunter-gatherer style living to a mix of hunter-gatherer and agriculture practices. Although these higher yielding plants were derived from an extremely primitive version of plant breeding, this form of agriculture was an investment that the people who grew them were planting then could have a more varied diet. This meant that they did not completely stop their hunting and gathering immediately but instead over time transition and ultimately favored agriculture. Originally this was due to humans not wanting to risk using all their time and resources for their crops just to fail. Which was promptly called play farming due to the idea of &quot;farmers&quot; experimenting with agriculture. In addition, the ability for humans to stay within one place for food and create permanent settlements made the process move along faster. During this transitional period, crops began to acclimate and evolve with humans encouraging humans to invest further into crops. Over time this reliance on plant breeding has created problems, as highlighted by the book Botany of Desire where Michael Pollan shows the connection between basic human desires through four different plants: apples for sweetness, tulips for beauty, cannabis for intoxication, and potatoes for control. In a form of reciprocal evolution humans have influenced these plants as much as the plants have influenced the people that consume them, is known as coevolution.

Selective plant breeding is also used in research to produce transgenic animals that breed &quot;true&quot; (i.e., are homozygous) for artificially inserted or deleted genes.

==Selective breeding in aquaculture==
Selective breeding in aquaculture holds high potential for the genetic improvement of fish and shellfish for the process of production. Unlike terrestrial livestock, the potential benefits of selective breeding in aquaculture were not realized until recently. This is because high mortality led to the selection of only a few broodstock, causing inbreeding depression, which then forced the use of wild broodstock. This was evident in selective breeding programs for growth rate, which resulted in slow growth and high mortality.

Control of the reproduction cycle was one of the main reasons as it is a requisite for selective breeding programs. Artificial reproduction was not achieved because of the difficulties in hatching or feeding some farmed species such as eel and yellowtail farming.
A suspected reason associated with the late realization of success in selective breeding programs in aquaculture was the education of the concerned people – researchers, advisory personnel and fish farmers. The education of fish biologists paid less attention to quantitative genetics and breeding plans.

Another was the failure of documentation of the genetic gains in successive generations. This in turn led to failure in quantifying economic benefits that successful selective breeding programs produce. Documentation of the genetic changes was considered important as they help in fine tuning further selection schemes.

===Quality traits in aquaculture===
Aquaculture species are reared for particular traits such as growth rate, survival rate, meat quality, resistance to diseases, age at sexual maturation, fecundity, shell traits like shell size, shell color, etc.
*Growth rate – growth rate is normally measured as either body weight or body length. This trait is of great economic importance for all aquaculture species as faster growth rate speeds up the turnover of production. Improved growth rates show that farmed animals utilize their feed more efficiently through a positive correlated response.
*Survival rate – survival rate may take into account the degrees of resistance to diseases. This may also see the stress response as fish under stress are highly vulnerable to diseases. The stress fish experience could be of biological, chemical or environmental influence.
*Meat quality – the quality of fish is of great economic importance in the market. Fish quality usually takes into account size, meatiness, and percentage of fat, color of flesh, taste, shape of the body, ideal oil and omega-3 content.
*Age at sexual maturation – The age of maturity in aquaculture species is another very important attribute for farmers as during early maturation the species divert all their energy to gonad production affecting growth and meat production and are more susceptible to health problems (Gjerde 1986).
*Fecundity – As the fecundity in fish and shellfish is usually high it is not considered as a major trait for improvement. However, selective breeding practices may consider the size of the egg and correlate it with survival and early growth rate.

===Finfish response to selection===

====Salmonids====

Gjedrem (1979) showed that selection of Atlantic salmon (&quot;Salmo salar&quot;) led to an increase in body weight by 30% per generation. A comparative study on the performance of select Atlantic salmon with wild fish was conducted by AKVAFORSK Genetics Centre in Norway. The traits, for which the selection was done included growth rate, feed consumption, protein retention, energy retention, and feed conversion efficiency. Selected fish had a twice better growth rate, a 40% higher feed intake, and an increased protein and energy retention. This led to an overall 20% better Fed Conversion Efficiency as compared to the wild stock. Atlantic salmon have also been selected for resistance to bacterial and viral diseases. Selection was done to check resistance to Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus (IPNV). The results showed 66.6% mortality for low-resistant species whereas the high-resistant species showed 29.3% mortality compared to wild species.

Rainbow trout (&quot;S. gairdneri&quot;) was reported to show large improvements in growth rate after 7–10 generations of selection. Kincaid et al. (1977) showed that growth gains by 30% could be achieved by selectively breeding rainbow trout for three generations. A 7% increase in growth was recorded per generation for rainbow trout by Kause et al. (2005).

In Japan, high resistance to IPNV in rainbow trout has been achieved by selectively breeding the stock. Resistant strains were found to have an average mortality of 4.3% whereas 96.1% mortality was observed in a highly sensitive strain.

Coho salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus kisutch&quot;) increase in weight was found to be more than 60% after four generations of selective breeding. In Chile, Neira et al. (2006) conducted experiments on early spawning dates in coho salmon. After selectively breeding the fish for four generations, spawning dates were 13–15 days earlier.

Cyprinids

Selective breeding programs for the Common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;) include improvement in growth, shape and resistance to disease. Experiments carried out in the USSR used crossings of broodstocks to increase genetic diversity and then selected the species for traits like growth rate, exterior traits and viability, and/or adaptation to environmental conditions like variations in temperature. Kirpichnikov &quot;et al.&quot; (1974) and Babouchkine (1987) selected carp for fast growth and tolerance to cold, the Ropsha carp. The results showed a 30–40% to 77.4% improvement of cold tolerance but did not provide any data for growth rate. An increase in growth rate was observed in the second generation in Vietnam. Moav and Wohlfarth (1976) showed positive results when selecting for slower growth for three generations compared to selecting for faster growth. Schaperclaus (1962) showed resistance to the dropsy disease wherein selected lines suffered low mortality (11.5%) compared to unselected (57%).

====Channel Catfish====

Growth was seen to increase by 12–20% in selectively bred &quot;Iictalurus punctatus&quot;. More recently, the response of the Channel Catfish to selection for improved growth rate was found to be approximately 80%, that is, an average of 13% per generation.

===Shellfish response to selection===

====Oysters====

Selection for live weight of Pacific oysters showed improvements ranging from 0.4% to 25.6% compared to the wild stock. Sydney-rock oysters (&quot;Saccostrea commercialis&quot;) showed a 4% increase after one generation and a 15% increase after two generations. Chilean oysters (&quot;Ostrea chilensis&quot;), selected for improvement in live weight and shell length showed a 10–13% gain in one generation.
Bonamia ostrea is a protistan parasite that causes catastrophic losses (nearly 98%) in European flat oyster &quot;Ostrea edulis&quot; L. This protistan parasite is endemic to three oyster-regions in Europe. Selective breeding programs show that &quot;O. edulis&quot; susceptibility to the infection differs across oyster strains in Europe. A study carried out by Culloty et al. showed that &#x27;Rossmore&#x27; oysters in Cork harbour, Ireland had better resistance compared to other Irish strains. A selective breeding program at Cork harbour uses broodstock from 3– to 4-year-old survivors and is further controlled until a viable percentage reaches market size.

Over the years &#x27;Rossmore&#x27; oysters have shown to develop lower prevalence of &quot;B. ostreae&quot; infection and percentage mortality. Ragone Calvo et al. (2003) selectively bred the eastern oyster, &quot;Crassostrea virginica&quot;, for resistance against co-occurring parasites &quot;Haplosporidium nelson&quot; (MSX) and &quot;Perkinsus marinus&quot; (Dermo). They achieved dual resistance to the disease in four generations of selective breeding. The oysters showed higher growth and survival rates and low susceptibility to the infections. At the end of the experiment, artificially selected &quot;C. virginica&quot; showed a 34–48% higher survival rate.

====Penaeid shrimps====
Selection for growth in Penaeid shrimps yielded successful results. A selective breeding program for &quot;Litopenaeus stylirostris&quot; saw an 18% increase in growth after the fourth generation and 21% growth after the fifth generation. &quot;Marsupenaeus japonicas&quot; showed a 10.7% increase in growth after the first generation. Argue et al. (2002) conducted a selective breeding program on the Pacific White Shrimp,&quot; Litopenaeus vannamei&quot; at The Oceanic Institute, Waimanalo, USA from 1995 to 1998. They reported significant responses to selection compared to the unselected control shrimps. After one generation, a 21% increase was observed in growth and 18.4% increase in survival to TSV. The Taura Syndrome Virus (TSV) causes mortalities of 70% or more in shrimps. C.I. Oceanos S.A. in Colombia selected the survivors of the disease from infected ponds and used them as parents for the next generation. They achieved satisfying results in two or three generations wherein survival rates approached levels before the outbreak of the disease. The resulting heavy losses (up to 90%) caused by Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) caused a number of shrimp farming industries started to selectively breed shrimps resistant to this disease. Successful outcomes led to development of Super Shrimp, a selected line of &quot;L. stylirostris&quot; that is resistant to IHHNV infection. Tang et al. (2000) confirmed this by showing no mortalities in IHHNV- challenged Super Shrimp post larvae and juveniles.

===Aquatic species versus terrestrial livestock===
Selective breeding programs for aquatic species provide better outcomes compared to terrestrial livestock. This higher response to selection of aquatic farmed species can be attributed to the following:
* High fecundity in both sexes fish and shellfish enabling higher selection intensity.
* Large phenotypic and genetic variation in the selected traits.

Selective breeding in aquaculture provide remarkable economic benefits to the industry, the primary one being that it reduces production costs due to faster turnover rates. When selective breeding is carried out, some characteristics are lost for others that may suit a specific environment or situation. This is because of faster growth rates, decreased maintenance rates, increased energy and protein retention, and better feed efficiency. Applying genetic improvement programs to aquaculture species will increase their productivity. Thus allowing them to meet the increasing demands of growing populations. Conversely, selective breeding within aquaculture can create problems within the biodiversity of both stock and wild fish, which can hurt the industry down the road. Although there is great potential to improve aquaculture due to the current lack of domestication, it is essential that the genetic diversity of the fish are preserved through proper genetic management, as we domesticate these species. It is not uncommon for fish to escape the nets or pens that they are kept in, especially in mass. If these fish are farmed in areas they are not native to they may be able to establish themselves and outcompete native populations of fish, and cause ecological harm as an invasive species. Furthermore, if they are in areas where the fish being farmed are native too their genetics are selectively bred rather than being wild. These farmed fish could breed with the natives which could be problematic In the sense that they would have been bred for consumption rather than by chance. Resulting in an overall decrease in genetic diversity and rendering local fish populations less fit for survival. If proper management is not taking place then the economic benefits and the diversity of the fish species will falter.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Selective breeding is a direct way to determine if a specific trait can evolve in response to selection. A single-generation method of breeding is not as accurate or direct. The process is also more practical and easier to understand than sibling analysis. Selective breeding is better for traits such as physiology and behavior that are hard to measure because it requires fewer individuals to test than single-generation testing.

However, there are disadvantages to this process. This is because a single experiment done in selective breeding cannot be used to assess an entire group of genetic variances, individual experiments must be done for every individual trait. Also, due to the necessity of selective breeding experiments to require maintaining the organisms tested in a lab or greenhouse, it is impractical to use this breeding method on many organisms. Controlled mating instances are difficult to carry out in this case and this is a necessary component of selective breeding.

Additionally, selective breeding can lead to a variety of issues including reduction of genetic diversity or physical problems. The process of selective breeding can create physical issues for plants or animals such as dogs selectively bred for extremely small sizes dislocating their kneecaps at a much more frequent rate then other dogs. An example in the plant world is the Lenape potatoes were selectively bred for their disease or pest resistance which was attributed to their high levels of toxic glycoalkaloid solanine which are usually present only in small amounts in potatoes fit for human consumption. When genetic diversity is lost it can also allow for populations to lack genetic alternatives to adapt to events. This becomes an issue of biodiversity, because attributes are so wide-spread they can result in mass epidemics. As seen in the Southern Corn leaf-blight epidemic of 1970 that wiped out 15% of the United States corn crop due to the wide use of a type of Texan corn strain that was artificially selected due to having sterile pollen to make farming easier. At the same time it was more vulnerable to Southern Corn leaf-blight.

<doc id="200655" wikidata="Q1784109" url="?curid=200655" title="Straight-four engine">
<text>A straight-four engine (also referred to as an inline-four engine) is a four-cylinder piston engine where cylinders are arranged in a line along a common crankshaft.

The majority of automotive four-cylinder engines use a straight-four layout (with the exceptions of the flat-four engines produced by Subaru and Porsche) and the layout is also very common in motorcycles and other machinery. Therefore the term &quot;four-cylinder engine&quot; is usually synonymous with straight-four engines. When a straight-four engine is installed at an inclined angle (instead of with the cylinders oriented vertically), it is sometimes called a slant-four.

Between 2005 and 2008, the proportion of new vehicles sold in the United States with four-cylinder engines rose from 30% to 47%. By the 2020 model year, the share for light-duty vehicles had risen to 59%.

== Design ==
A four-stroke straight-four engine always has a cylinder on its power stroke, unlike engines with fewer cylinders where there is no power stroke occurring at certain times. Compared with a V4 engine or a flat-four engine, a straight-four engine only has one cylinder head, which reduces complexity and production cost.

=== Displacement ===
Petrol straight-four engines used in modern production cars typically have a displacement of , but larger engines have been used in the past, for example the 1927–1931 Bentley 4½ Litre.

Diesel engines have been produced in larger displacements, such as a 3.2 L turbocharged Mitsubishi engine (used the Pajero/Shogun/Montero SUV) and a 3.0 L Toyota engine. European and Asian trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating between 7.5 and 18 tonnes commonly use inline four-cylinder diesel engines with displacements around 5 litres. Larger displacements are found in locomotive, marine and stationary engines.

Displacement can also be very small, as found in kei cars sold in Japan. Several of these engines had four cylinders at a time when regulations dictated a maximum displacement of 550 cc; the maximum size is currently at 660 cc.

=== Primary and secondary balance ===
Straight-four engines with the preferred crankshaft configuration have perfect primary balance. This is because the pistons are moving in pairs, and one pair of pistons is always moving up at the same time as the other pair is moving down.

However, straight-four engines have a secondary imbalance. This is caused by the acceleration/deceleration of the pistons during the top half of the crankshaft rotation being greater than that of the pistons in the bottom half of the crankshaft rotation (because the connecting rods are not infinitely long). As a result, two pistons are always accelerating faster in one direction, while the other two are accelerating more slowly in the other direction, which leads to a secondary dynamic imbalance that causes an up-and-down vibration at twice crankshaft speed. This imbalance is common among all piston engines, but the effect is particularly strong on four-stroke inline-four because of the two pistons always moving together.

The strength of this imbalance is determined by the reciprocating mass, the ratio of connecting rod length to stroke, and the peak piston velocity. Therefore, small displacement engines with light pistons show little effect, and racing engines use long connecting rods. However, the effect grows quadratically with engine speed (rpm).

=== Pulsations in power delivery ===

Four-stroke engines with five or more cylinders are able to have at least one cylinder performing its power stroke at any given point in time. However, four-cylinder engines have gaps in the power delivery, since each cylinder completes its power stroke before the next piston starts a new power stroke. This pulsating delivery of power results in more vibrations than engines with more than four cylinders.

=== Usage of balance shafts ===
A balance shaft system is sometimes used to reduce the vibrations created by a straight-four engine, most often in engines with larger displacements. The balance shaft system was invented in 1911 and consists of two shafts carrying identical eccentric weights that rotate in opposite directions at twice the crankshaft&#x27;s speed. This system was patented by Mitsubishi Motors in the 1970s, introduced in the Mitsubishi Astron engine with the &quot;Silent Shaft&quot; name, and has since been used under licence by several other companies.

Not all large displacement straight-four engines have used balance shafts, however. Examples of relatively large engines without balance shafts include the 2.4 litre Citroën DS engine, the 2.6 litre Austin-Healey 100 engine, the 3.3 L Ford Model A (1927) engine and the 2.5 L GM Iron Duke engine. Soviet/Russian GAZ Volga and UAZ engines with displacements of up to 2.9 litres were produced without balance shafts from the 1950s to the 1990s, however these were relatively low-revving engines which reduces the need for a balance shaft system.

== Usage in production cars ==

Most modern straight-four engines used in cars have a displacement of . The smallest automotive straight-four engine was used in the 1963–1967 Honda T360 kei truck and has a displacement of , while the largest mass-produced straight-four car engine is the 1999–2019 Mitsubishi 4M41 diesel engine which was used in the Mitsubishi Pajero and has a displacement of .

Significant straight-four car engines include:

* 1954–1994 Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine: one of the first mass-produced twin-cam engines. In 1990, it became the first production engine with variable valve timing.
* 1908–1941 Ford Model T engine: one of the most widely produced engines in the world.
* 1951–2000 BMC A-Series engine: the first engine to be used in a mass-production transverse-engined front-wheel drive car.
* 1966–2000 Fiat Twin Cam engine: one of the first mass-produced twin-cam engines, produced from 1959.
* 1968–1981 Triumph Slant-4 engine: an early multi-valve engine which formed the basis of Saab&#x27;s first turbocharged engines.
* 2000–2009 Honda F20C engine: produced the highest specific output for a naturally aspirated engine of its time.

== Usage in racing cars ==
Many early racing cars used straight-four engines, however the Peugeot engine which won the 1913 Indianapolis 500 was a highly influential engine. Designed by Ernest Henry, this engine had double overhead camshafts (DOHC) with four valves per cylinder, a layout that would become the standard until today for racing inline-four engines.

Amongst the engines inspired by the Peugeot design was the Miller engine, which was a successful racing engine through the 1920s and early 1930s. The Miller engine evolved into the Offenhauser engine which had a highly successful spanning from the 1933 until 1981, including five straight victories at the Indianapolis 500 from 1971 to 1976.

Many cars produced for the pre-WWII voiturette Grand Prix motor racing category used inline-four engine designs. 1.5 L supercharged engines found their way into cars such as the Maserati 4CL and various English Racing Automobiles (ERA) models. These were resurrected after the war, and formed the foundation of what was later to become Formula One, although the straight-eight supercharged Alfettas would dominate the early years of F1.

Another engine that played an important role in racing history is the straight-four Ferrari engine designed by Aurelio Lampredi. This engine was originally designed as a 2 L Formula 2 engine for the Ferrari 500, but evolved to 2.5 L to compete in Formula One in the Ferrari 625. For sports car racing, capacity was increased up to 3.4 L for the Ferrari 860 Monza.

The Coventry Climax straight-four engine was also a very successful racing engine, which began life as a 1.5 litre Formula 2 engine. Enlarged to 2.0 litres for Formula One in 1958, it evolved into the large 2,495 cc FPF that won the Formula One championship in Cooper&#x27;s chassis in 1959 and 1960.

In Formula One, the 1980s were dominated by the 1,500 cc turbocharged cars. The BMW M12/13 engine was notable for the era for its high boost pressures and performance. The cast iron block was based on a standard road car block and powered the F1 cars of Brabham, Arrows and Benetton and won the world championship in 1983. The 1986 version of the engine was said to produce about in qualifying trim, at 5.5 bar of turbo boost.

== Usage in motorcycles ==

Belgian arms manufacturer FN Herstal, which had been making motorcycles since 1901, began producing the first motorcycles with inline-fours in 1905. The FN Four had its engine mounted upright with the crankshaft longitudinal. Other manufacturers that used this layout included Pierce, Henderson, Ace, Cleveland, and Indian in the United States, Nimbus in Denmark, Windhoff in Germany, and Wilkinson in the United Kingdom.

The first across-the-frame 4-cylinder motorcycle was the 1939 racer Gilera 500 Rondine, it also had double-over-head camshafts, forced-inducting supercharger and was liquid-cooled. Modern inline-four motorcycle engines first became popular with Honda&#x27;s SOHC CB750 introduced in 1969, and others followed in the 1970s. Since then, the inline-four has become one of the most common engine configurations in street bikes. Outside of the cruiser category, the inline-four is the most common configuration because of its relatively high performance-to-cost ratio. All major Japanese motorcycle manufacturers offer motorcycles with inline-four engines, as do MV Agusta and BMW. BMW&#x27;s earlier inline-four motorcycles were mounted horizontally along the frame, but all current four-cylinder BMW motorcycles have transverse engines. The modern Triumph company has offered inline-four-powered motorcycles, though they were discontinued in favour of triples.

The 2009 Yamaha R1 has an inline-four engine that does not fire at even intervals of 180°. Instead, it uses a crossplane crankshaft that prevents the pistons from simultaneously reaching top dead centre. This results in better secondary balance, which is particularly beneficial in the higher rpm range, and &quot;big-bang firing order&quot; theory says the irregular delivery of torque to the rear tire makes sliding in the corners at racing speeds easier to control.

Inline-four engines are also used in MotoGP by the Suzuki (since 2015) and Yamaha (since 2002) teams. In 2010, when the four-stroke Moto2 class was introduced, the engines for the class were a inline-four engine made by Honda based on the CBR600RR with a maximum power output of . Starting in 2019, the engines were replaced by a Triumph triple engine.

== Usage in light and medium duty commercial vehicles ==

Inline-four engines are also used in light duty commercial vehicles such as Karsan Jest and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter.

<doc id="200658" wikidata="Q1148385" url="?curid=200658" title="Straight-six engine">
<text>The straight-six engine (also referred to as an inline-six engine; abbreviated I6 or L6) is a piston engine with six cylinders arranged in a straight line along the crankshaft. A straight-six engine has perfect primary and secondary engine balance, resulting in fewer vibrations than other designs of six or fewer cylinders.

Until the mid-20th century, the straight-six layout was the most common design for engines with six cylinders. However, V6 engines gradually became more common in the 1970s and by the 2000s, V6 engines had replaced straight-six engines in most applications.

== Characteristics ==
In terms of packaging, straight-six engines are almost always narrower than a V6 engine or V8 engine, but longer than straight-four engines, V6s, and most V8s.

Straight-six engines are typically produced in displacements ranging from , however engines ranging in size from the Benelli 750 Sei motorcycle engine to the Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C two-stroke marine diesel engine. Due to its well-balanced configuration, the straight-six can be scaled up to substantial sizes for heavy trucks, locomotives, industrial and marine use.

=== Engine balance and vibration ===

If an appropriate firing order is used, a straight-six engine has perfect primary and secondary engine balance. The primary balance is due to the front and rear trio of cylinders moving in pairs (albeit 360° out of phase), thus canceling out the rocking motion present in a straight-three engine. The secondary balance is due to the crank throws being arranged in three planes offset at 120°, resulting in the non-sinusoidal forces summing to zero for all free forces until the sixth order.

The engine balance characteristics of a straight-six engine compare favorably with the more common straight-four engines and V6 engines, which experience significant secondary dynamic imbalance, resulting in engine vibration. As engine reciprocating forces increase with the cube of piston bore, the straight-six is a preferred configuration for large truck engines.

===Two-stroke engines ===
An even-firing six-cylinder two-stroke engine requires ignitions at 60° intervals, or else it would run with simultaneous ignitions and be no smoother than a triple in power delivery. As such, it also requires crank throws at 60°. Such designs appear to have been limited to diesel engines such as the Detroit 71 series, marine engines, and outboard motors.

Some of the 120 possible crankshaft configurations have useful properties. Still, all of them have a rocking imbalance that may or may not require a balance shaft, depending on the application. The six pistons with six unique phases cannot be &quot;paired&quot; as in the four-stroke case. The Detroit engines used a configuration that, once the primary rocking couple was balanced out, was also perfectly balanced at all other rocking couples until the 6th order. Mercury came to use a configuration that canceled only the primary rocking couple and was run without a balancer.

The reciprocating masses of all configurations are still imbalanced at only 6th-order and up in their plane of motion. Still, the balance of kinetic energy exchange between pistons has improved to a residual 6th-order-and-up inertial torque oscillation compared with the four-stroke design being imbalanced at 3rd-order and up.

=== Crankshaft ===

Crankshafts for straight-six engines usually have either four main bearings (i.e., a bearing in between each pair of crankpins and one at each end) or seven main bearings (i.e., a bearing between every crankpin):
* Large displacement and diesel engines typically use seven bearings to minimize crankshaft flex. When an engine is subject to high loads at low speeds, the greater distance between main bearings causes increased crankshaft flex. Modern high-compression engines subject the crankshaft to greater bending loads from higher peak gas pressures, requiring the crank throws to have more significant support from adjacent bearings. So, it is common for straight-six engines to use seven main bearings.
* Smaller and high-performance engines typically use four bearings since having fewer main journals increases the torsional stiffness of the crankshaft. The lack of torsional stiffness can make the seven main bearing designs susceptible to torsional flex and potential breakage at high engine speeds. Any torsional flex in the crankshaft is compounded by the torsional flex of the camshafts for the rear cylinders since the camshafts are rather long and subject to torsional flex. At high engine speeds, the combination of camshaft and crankshaft flex results in inaccurate timing of the valve openings, which, in the worst case, can cause the valves and pistons to collide with catastrophic results.

== Usage in cars==
The first production straight-six engine was introduced in the Dutch &quot;Spyker 60 HP&quot; racing car in 1903. Straight-six engines increased in popularity in the years after and by 1909, approximately 80 manufacturers were using them (including 62 in the United Kingdom). Prior to the 1950s, V6 engines were rarely used, due to the poorer engine balance of V6 engines compared to straight-six engines. Since the 1980s, however, the shorter length of V6 engines has seen most manufacturers replace straight-six engines with V6 engines. An exception to this trend is the German brand BMW, which has always used a straight-six layout for its six-cylinder engines.

Since 2017, the trend of switching to V6 engines has reversed due to the ability to create a modular engine family of straight engines sharing many components. Examples include the 2017–present Mercedes-Benz M256 engine, the 2019–present Jaguar Land Rover Ingenium engines (AJ300 and AJ300D versions), the 2021–present Stellantis Hurricane engine and the 2022–present Mazda Skyactiv-X and Skyactiv-D engines.

=== Europe ===

Alfa Romeo&#x27;s first production straight-six engine - 6.3 L flathead petrol engine - was introduced in 1921 in the Alfa Romeo G1 luxury car. An overhead valve design was introduced in the 1922 Alfa Romeo RL sports car, and an overhead camshaft design was used in the 1927 Alfa Romeo 6C sports car and various racing cars from 1927 until 1954. The last Alfa Romeo model using a straight-six was the 1961–1969 Alfa Romeo 2600 executive car before the company switched to V6 engines.

Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s history of straight-six engines began with the 1913 Mercedes D.I aircraft engine. The first automotive straight-six engine was the 1924–1929 &quot;Daimler M836&quot; 3.9 L petrol engine. Following World War 2, Mercedes resumed production of straight-six engines with the 1951 introduction of the Mercedes-Benz M180 overhead camshaft engine. In 1985, the Mercedes-Benz OM603 3.0 L diesel straight-six engine was introduced. In 1996, the company replaced its petrol straight-sixes with a series of V6 engines, although it continued producing diesel straight-six engines. Production of petrol straight-six engines resumed in 2017 with the introduction of the Mercedes-Benz M256 turbocharged DOHC engine.

Opel began production of straight-six engines in 1927 with a 1.8 L flathead petrol engine used by the Opel 8/40 PS. The displacement of this engine was expanded as it was used in later models such as the Opel Kapitän and Opel Admiral, with later versions switching to an overhead valve (pushrod) design. In 1968, the straight-six versions of the Opel CIH engine were introduced, initially using a single overhead camshaft (SOHC) with some later versions using double overhead camshafts (DOHC). Production of the Opel CIH engine continued until 1993, when a V6 engine replaced it.

Volvo began production of straight-six engines with the 1929–1958 Penta DB flathead petrol engines. The company resumed production in 1969 with the Volvo B30 overhead valve petrol engine, followed by the straight-six versions of the Volvo Modular Engine introduced in 1995 and then the Volvo SI6 engine introduced in 2006. Several models (such as the 1998–2006 Volvo S80) used the uncommon design of a transversely-mounted straight-six engine. Production of Volvo straight-six engines ceased in 2015.

BMW&#x27;s first product was the 1917 BMW IIIa straight-six aircraft engine. The company began production of automotive straight-six engines in 1933 with the BMW M78 petrol engine, a 1.2 L overhead valve design that evolved over the years into the BMW M337 (produced until 1958). Production of straight-six engines resumed in 1968 with the BMW M30 single overhead camshaft engine, built for 27 years and used in various models. The 1978–1989 BMW M88 engine was a double overhead camshaft design that was introduced in the BMW M1 mid-engine sport car. BMW&#x27;s introduction of turbocharged straight-six engines (aside from the low-volume variants of the M30 engine in the 1980s) was in 2006 BMW N54 and the production of naturally aspirated engines ceased in 2015. , the BMW B58 turbocharged straight-six engine remains in production, along with its higher performance BMW S58 variants.

===United Kingdom===
Rolls-Royce&#x27;s first straight-six engine was a 6.0 L IOE petrol engine, which was used in the 1905 Rolls-Royce 30 hp luxury car. This car was replaced by the 1906–1926 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, which switched to a flathead (side-valve) design for its straight-six engine.

In 1906, the &quot;Standard Six&quot; luxury car was introduced, powered by a I6 petrol engine. Standard&#x27;s engines were also used in several cars built by SS Cars and its successor Jaguar, such as the 1932 SS 1 sports car, the 1936 SS Jaguar 100 and the 1938 Jaguar 3½ Litre sports saloon/coupe and the 1948 Jaguar Mark V luxury car.

The 1927 Rover Two-litre luxury car introduced the company&#x27;s IOE straight-six petrol engine. This engine was used in various Rover models until the Rover P5 was discontinued in 1973, and in various Land Rover models from the 1961 Land Rover Series IIA until 1980 Land Rover Series III.

The 1928 Austin 20/6 luxury car introduced Austin&#x27;s flathead straight-six petrol engine. The 1938-1939 Austin Twenty-Eight used an enlarged version of this engine. This was replaced by the Austin D-Series engine, an overhead valve engine initially designed for trucks, which was used in passenger cars from 1947 until 1968 (along with several Jensen Motors models from 1946 to 1962). The overhead valve BMC C-Series was used by various BMC brands from 1954 to 1971, followed by the 2.2 L version of the BMC E-Series overhead camshaft engine, which was produced from 1970 until 1982.

The 1930–1936 Wolseley Hornet six lightweight car was powered by a 1.3-1.6 L overhead camshaft straight-six petrol engine.

The 1931–1932 MG F-type tourers, 1932–1934 MG K-type sports cars, and 1934–1936 MG N-type sports cars were powered by an overhead camshaft straight-six petrol engine.

During the mid-1930s, the Riley MPH sports car and &quot;Riley Kestrel 6&quot; saloon were produced in small numbers and were powered by dual overhead camshaft straight-six petrol engine.

The 1947 Bristol 400 luxury car was powered by an overhead valve straight-six petrol engine based on the design of the BMW M328 engine. This engine remained in use until the Bristol 406 was discontinued in 1961.

The dual overhead camshaft Jaguar XK6 engine petrol engine was produced from 1948 to 1992 in the Jaguar XK120 sports car. Introduced as a 3.4 L, it was used in passenger and racing cars, produced in displacements of 2.4 to 4.2 L. The XK6 engine was followed by the AJ6 and AJ16 engines, produced from 1984 to 1996, before being replaced by a Ford-derived V6 engine.

The 1948–1959 Lagonda straight-6 dual overhead camshaft petrol engine was used in various Aston Martin and Lagonda cars. This engine&#x27;s successor was the Tadek Marek-designed straight-six used in the DB4 (1958), DB5 (1963), DB6 (1965) and DBS (1967).

The Ford Zephyr 6 overhead valve engine was used in the &quot;Ford Zephyr&quot; executive car and several other models from 1951 to 1966.

The Triumph I6 overhead valve straight-six petrol engine was produced from 1960 to 1977 and debuted in the Standard Vanguard Six sports saloon. The Leyland PE166 engine was loosely based on the Triumph design and was produced from 1977 to 1986.

The 1972–1977 TVR 2500M sports car was powered by the Triumph I6 engine. Then, from 1999 to 2007, TVR&#x27;s own TVR Speed Six dual overhead camshaft engine was used in several of the company&#x27;s sports cars.

===United States===
The 1906–1908 Ford Model K luxury car used a straight-six petrol engine and was the only Ford six-cylinder passenger car engine until the 1940s. The Ford flathead I6 was produced from 1941 until 1951, followed by the Ford OHV I6 overhead valve engine from 1952 through 1964, then the Ford Thriftpower Six overhead valve engine from 1960 until 1982, and the Ford 240 I6 from 1965 through 1972. The Ford version of the straight-six engine was built from 1965 until 1996, with notable uses in trucks, SUVs, and vans. However, Ford straight-sixes were replaced by V6 engines in passenger cars during the mid-1970s.

In 1908, the Oldsmobile Model Z was powered by a flathead straight-six petrol engine, which was produced until 1912 (in the Oldsmobile Limited luxury car) in displacements of , and . Oldsmobile&#x27;s next straight-six engine was introduced in the 1913 Oldsmobile Six luxury car, initially with a displacement of , followed by a displacement of for the 1917-1921 Oldsmobile Model 37 luxury car. The later generations of the Oldsmobile Straight-6 also used a flathead design from its introduction in the 1923 Oldsmobile Model 30 luxury car until it was replaced in 1950 by Oldsmobile&#x27;s V8 engine.

The 1913–1929 Oakland Six luxury car was powered by a flathead petrol engine produced in displacements of and . In 1926, the Pontiac Six was introduced as a lower-cost version of the Oakland six, powered by the Pontiac Split-Head Six flathead engine, which used two cylinder heads. This engine was replaced by the 1941–1954 Pontiac flathead six. The unrelated Pontiac OHV 6 overhead valve engine was produced in 1964–1965, based on a Chevrolet design. Pontiac&#x27;s final straight-six engine was the 1966–1969 Pontiac OHC 6 overhead camshaft engine, which was replaced by Chevrolet&#x27;s straight-six engine and Buick&#x27;s V6 engine.
a
The overhead valve Buick Straight-6 petrol engine was introduced in the 1914 Buick Six luxury car and was produced until 1930. Buick did not make another six-cylinder engine until they introduced a V6 engine in 1962.

The 1916 through 1926 Hudson Super Six was powered by a straight-six petrol engine. This was followed by an IOE version in 1916. The 1951 Hudson Hornet introduced a flathead straight-six engine. These engines dominated dirt track and NASCAR racing at the time. Production of the Hudson I6 continued after the 1954 merger forming American Motors Corporation and was eventually replaced by a new Rambler V8 after 1956.

In 1924, Chrysler began production of a straight six version of the Chrysler flathead petrol engine. This was replaced by the 1959–2000 Chrysler Slant-6 overhead valve straight-six petrol engine, which was so named due to the 30-degree angle used to reduce the height of the engine (with the trade-off of a wider engine). The Slant-6 was released in the Dodge Dart economy car and used in many models until a V6 engine replaced it after 30 years.

The Chevrolet Stovebolt overhead valve straight-six petrol engine was introduced in 1929 as a replacement for the brand&#x27;s straight-four engines and was produced in displacements of , and . The second generation of this engine family - often referred to as the Blue Flame engine - was produced from 1937 to 1962 in displacements of , and . This was followed by the 1962–1988 Chevrolet Turbo-Thrift engine (also using an overhead valve design), which was replaced by various General Motors V6 engines.

The 1952 through 2006 AMC Straight-6 petrol engine initially used a flathead design before being upgraded to an overhead valve design in 1956. A new I6 design with a short stroke and seven main bearing crankshaft was introduced in 1964. The engine was rugged, reliable, and became noted for longevity. A turbocharged racing engine based on the AMC Straight-6 engine block produced and competed in the 1978 Indianapolis 500 race. The final application for the AMC Straight-6 engine was the 2006 Jeep Wrangler (TJ), after which a V6 replaced it.

The 1962 through 1973 Jeep Tornado overhead camshaft straight-six engine was introduced in the Willys Jeep Station Wagon. At the time of its introduction, the Tornado engine had the lowest specific fuel consumption of an American gasoline (petrol) engine. The Tornado engine was replaced by the AMC I6 engine.

In 2001, General Motors resumed production of straight-six engines with the Vortec 4200 dual overhead camshaft petrol engine. This engine was used in various SUV models until 2009. Also, the Duramax Straight-6 turbocharged diesel engine has been available in several General Motors SUV and light truck models since 2020.

On March 25, 2022, Stellantis announced their new turbocharged straight-six engine, called Hurricane. Two outputs are available, a standard high performance rated at of torque. The turbos on the Hurricane Standard Output deliver a peak boost of 22 psi, while the Hurricane High Output turbos deliver 26 psi of peak boost. The 3.0 L Hurricane is produced at Stellantis’ Saltillo Engine Plant in Mexico.

===Asia===
Toyota&#x27;s first straight-six engine was the Toyota Type A, produced from 1935 through 1947. The Type A was an overhead-valve petrol engine based on the &quot;Chevrolet Stovebolt&quot; engine. This was followed by the first generation Toyota F overhead valve engine, which was produced from 1949 to 1975, which in turn was followed by the 2F version from 1975 to 1988 and the fuel-injected 3F / 3FE version from 1988 to 1992. This was replaced by the dual overhead camshaft Toyota FZ engine, produced from 1993 until 2008. Produced alongside these engines was the single overhead camshaft Toyota M engine, which was introduced in 1965 and produced over seven generations until 1993 (with the &quot;7M-GTE&quot; being the final version of the M engine). The M engine was replaced by the dual overhead camshaft Toyota JZ engine, which was produced from 1990 to 2007 and is arguably known as Toyota&#x27;s best straight-six engine. Toyota&#x27;s third line of straight-six engines was the 2.0 L Toyota G engine, which was released as a single overhead camshaft engine in 1979 and upgraded to dual overhead camshafts before production ended in 2008 (with the 1G-FE being the final variant).

Nissan&#x27;s first straight-six engine was the 1950–1952 Nissan NAK flathead petrol engine, which continued in various forms until production of the Nissan P engine ended in 2003. The 1963-1965 Nissan K overhead valve petrol engine was used in the Nissan Cedric Special 50 luxury car. Using a similar design, the Nissan H30 engine was used in several luxury cars from 1965 through 1989. In 1966, Nissan began production of the six-cylinder versions of the Nissan L single overhead camshaft engine, which was produced until 2009. The 1985–2004 Nissan RB engine, used in the Nissan Skyline and several other cars, was produced in single overhead camshaft and dual overhead camshaft configurations until a V6 engine replaced it. The Nissan TB overhead valve engine was introduced in 1987 and produced alongside the other straight-six engines.

The six-cylinder versions of the Prince G engine were introduced in 1963 and remained in production until 1969, three years after Prince&#x27;s merger with Nissan. The 1969–1973 Nissan S20 dual overhead camshaft engine (used in the Nissan Fairlady and first generation of the Nissan Skyline GT-R) was based on the Prince G engine.

Mitsubishi produced six-cylinder versions of the Mitsubishi KE engine from 1963 to 1970, as well as the rare six-cylinder versions of the Mitsubishi 6G34 version of the single overhead camshaft &quot;Saturn&quot; engine from 1970 to 1976.

The 2000–2006 Daewoo Magnus (also called the Chevrolet Evanda, Chevrolet Epica, Holden Epica, or Suzuki Verona) was powered by the &quot;Daewoo XK6&quot; straight-six petrol engine, which is one of the few straight-six engines to be used in a transverse engine front-wheel drive car.

===Australia===

From the 1950s to the 2010s, many cars produced in Australia were powered by a straight-six engine.

Holden&#x27;s first car, the 1948 Holden 48-215 sedan, was powered by the Holden &#x27;grey&#x27; motor, an overhead valve petrol engine. This engine was replaced by the Holden &#x27;red&#x27; motor, which was produced from 1963 to 1980 and in turn followed by the 1980–1984 Holden &#x27;blue&#x27; motor. The final locally produced Holden straight-six was the 1984–1986 Holden &#x27;black&#x27; motor, which was initially replaced by the Japanese-built Nissan RB30 engine before Holden switched to a locally-built V6 engine.

Ford produced straight-six engines for the longest time of any Australian manufacturer. In 1960, the Ford Falcon large sedan was introduced with a locally-built version of the American Ford Straight-6 overhead valve engine. In 1998, these engines were upgraded to a single overhead camshaft design. This was followed in 2002 by the Ford Barra dual overhead camshaft engine in 2002, which was produced in both naturally aspirated and turbocharged versions. The Ford Barra engine remained in use until Ford Australia ceased local production in 2016.

The Chrysler Valiant was introduced in 1962, powered by the American Chrysler Slant 6. In 1970, the Valiant switched to the Chrysler Hemi-6 overhead valve engine, an Australia-only engine that was produced until Chrysler Australia ceased production of large cars in 1981.

The 1962–1965 Austin Freeway and Wolseley 24/80 large sedans were powered by BMC Australia&#x27;s &quot;Blue Streak&quot; overhead valve petrol engine. This was followed by the six-cylinder versions of the BMC E-series overhead camshaft engines, which were introduced in the 1970 Austin Kimberley / Austin Tasman front-wheel-drive sedans, which were produced until 1972. This engine was upsized to a 2.6 L displacement in 1973 and used Leyland P76 and the Morris Marina large cars until 1975.

== Usage in motorcycles ==
From 1964 to 1967, Honda produced several Grand Prix motorcycle racing motorcycles powered by straight-six versions of the Honda RC petrol racing engine; these versions were designated the &#x27;3RC164&#x27;, &#x27;RC165&#x27;, &#x27;RC166&#x27; and Honda RC174. The unrelated road-use Honda CBX was produced from 1978 to 1982 and was powered by a dual overhead camshaft petrol engine.

The 1973–1989 Benelli Sei series was the first road-use motorcycle to use a straight-six engine. Initially released with a single overhead camshaft petrol engine, in 1979 it was upgraded to a engine.

The 1979–1989 Kawasaki Z1300 roadster motorcycle was powered by a dual overhead camshaft petrol engine.

From 2011–present, the BMW K1600 series of touring motorcycles have been powered by a dual overhead camshaft petrol engine.

== Usage in trucks ==
Straight-six engines used in trucks include:
* 5.9 and 6.7 L versions of the 1984–present Cummins B Series turbocharged diesel engine
* General Motors&#x27; 2002–2009 Vortec 4200 naturally-aspirated petrol engine

== Diesel engines ==
=== Automotive engines ===
Straight-six engines used in automobiles include:
* 1978-1995 Volkswagen D24 naturally-aspirated engine and the 1982–1992 Volkswagen D24T turbocharged engine
* 1986-1997 Mercedes-Benz OM603 engine - produced in naturally aspirated and turbocharged variants
* BMW&#x27;s line of diesel engines consists of the BMW M21 (introduced in 1981) through to the current BMW B57 engine
* 1985-2009 Nissan RD (naturally-aspirated and turbocharged variants) and 1987-2007 Nissan TD42 (turbocharged) engines

=== Industrial-use and truck engines ===
* various Toyota engines from 1956–present
* Cummins B Series (5.9 and 6.7 L versions) from 1984–present
* industrial and truck engines from MAN Truck &amp; Bus, Scania and Yuchai

<doc id="200660" wikidata="Q1482297" url="?curid=200660" title="Straight-five engine">
<text>The straight-five engine (also referred to as an inline-five engine; abbreviated I5 or L5) is a piston engine with five cylinders mounted in a straight line along the crankshaft.

Although less common than straight-four engines and straight-six engines, straight-five engine designs have been used by automobile manufacturers since the late 1930s. The most notable examples include the Mercedes Benz&#x27;s diesel engines from 1974 to 2006 and Audi&#x27;s petrol engines from 1979 to the present. Straight-five engines are smoother running than straight-four engines and shorter than straight-six engines. However, achieving consistent fueling across all cylinders was problematic prior to the adoption of fuel injection.

== Characteristics ==

Straight-five engines are typically shorter than straight-six engines, making them easier to fit transversely in an engine bay. They are also smoother than straight-four engines, and are narrower than V engines and flat engines.

=== Engine balance and vibration ===
Five-cylinder engines have a crankshaft with 72 degree angles. Amongst four-stroke engines, an advantage of engines with five or more cylinders is that the power strokes are overlapping if the engine has an even firing order.

A disadvantage of the odd number of cylinders in a straight-five engine is it results in imperfect primary and secondary engine balance, unlike a straight-six engine which has perfect primary and secondary balance. Counterweights on the crankshaft can be used to counteract some amount of these vibrations. This method is also used in straight-four engines.

=== Firing order ===
Most four-stroke straight-five engines use a firing order of 1-2-4-5-3. This firing order results in the minimal primary (crank speed) rocking couple, and is used by the Volvo Modular engine, VW/Audi straight-five engine, General Motors Atlas engine and Honda G engine. Straight-five engines typically have a 72 degree crankshaft design.

All two stroke straight-five engines are limited in having a single firing order for a given crank configuration; because a complete cycle occurs every 360 degrees, there is no chance to share piston phases without having simultaneous ignitions, so the straight-five is at no disadvantage in this case. Some two-stroke outboard engines, e.g. the &quot;Mercury Marine Force 150&quot; engine use a firing order of 1-5-2-3-4.

=== Carburettors and fuel injection ===
The use of straight-five petrol engines in mass production cars only became truly viable with the advent of reliable fuel injection. This is because of the unavoidable problems of a carburettor supplying an odd number of cylinders and the length of the inlet manifold between the carburetor varying greatly between cylinders at the ends of the engine and those nearer the carburetor. Unlike other engine layouts, these problems are not easily solved by using multiple carburettors.

Diesel engines have always used fuel injection, therefore large displacement straight-five diesel engines were commonly seen decades before straight-five petrol engines.

== Usage in automobiles ==
=== Diesel engines ===
The 1938 Lancia 3Ro trucks introduced a straight-five diesel engine to replace the previous straight-three engine. Built for the Italian and German armed forces during World War II and later for civilian usage, the truck remained in production until 1950.

The first mass-production straight-five passenger car engine was the 1974 Mercedes-Benz OM617, a naturally-aspirated engine introduced in the &quot;Mercedes-Benz 300D (W114/W115)&quot; models. In 1978, a turbocharged version was introduced in the &quot;Mercedes-Benz 300SD Turbo&quot; models. Mercedes-Benz continued to produce straight-five engines for the next 28 years, until the Mercedes-Benz OM647 engine ended production in 2006.

In 1978, the Audi 2.0 R5 D engine was introduced in the &quot;Audi 100&quot; sedan. In 1983, a turbocharged version was introduced, initially for the U.S. market Audi 100. Several Volvo cars were produced with Audi straight-five diesel engines, prior to the introduction of the Volvo D5 turbo-diesel engine; this engine was produced from 2001 to 2017 and was used in several diesel hybrid applications (marketed as &quot;twin engine&quot; models).

Other mass-production straight-five diesel engines include the 1999–2001 VM Motori 531 turbo-diesel engine, the 1998–2007 Land Rover Td5 turbo-diesel engine, the 2006–2019 Ford Duratorq 3.2 turbo-diesel engine and the 1998–2009 Fiat JTD 2.4 turbo-diesel engine.

=== Petrol engines ===

Henry Ford had an inline-five engine developed in the late 1930s to early 1940s for a compact economy car design, which never saw production due to lack of demand for small cars in the United States.

The first production straight-five petrol engine was the Audi 2.1 R5 introduced in the Audi 100 in 1979. Audi has continued use of straight-five petrol engines (in both naturally aspirated and turbocharged versions) to the present day. The Audi TT RS and Audi RS3 currently use straight-five engines. In motorsport, the first car to use a straight-five engine was the Audi Quattro rally car; other racing cars which used straight-five engines include the 1985-1986 Audi Sport Quattro E2 and the 1989 Audi 90 Quattro IMSA GTO. For the year 1987 factory team tested a 735 kW (1000 hp) version of the inline-5 powered Audi S1 Sport Quattro.

Several Volkswagen-branded straight-five engines have been produced, beginning with the Volkswagen WH/WN 1.9 litre 10v engine used in the 1981 Volkswagen Passat. The final Volkswagen straight-five petrol engine was the Volkswagen EA855 2.5 litre 20v engine used in the North American Passat models until 2014.

The Volvo Modular engine was introduced in the 1991 Volvo 850 sedan and was used in various Volvo models, along with the &quot;Ford Focus ST&quot; and &quot;Ford Focus RS&quot; models. All of the straight-five petrol engines used by Volvo and Ford were built at the Volvo Skövde engine plant in Skövde, Sweden, until their discontinuation in 2016.

Other straight-five petrol engines include
* 1989-1998 Honda G-series 2.0-2.5 litre 20v engines
* 1995-2006 Fiat Family C 2.0-2.4 litre 20v engine
* 2004-2012 General Motors Vortec 3500/3700 3.5-3.7 litre 20v engines

In recent years the engine has been falling out of favour, with Volvo announcing in 2012 it would discontinue building them, for example.

== Usage in motorcycles ==
Very few motorcycles have used five-cylinder engines. However, the 1965 &quot;Honda RC148&quot; and 1966 &quot;Honda RC149&quot; 125 cc four-stroke racing motorcycles used straight-five engines based on the 50 cc straight-twin engine from the Honda RC116 Grand Prix racing motorcycle. These straight-five engines were an unusual design in that they were configured as a straight-six engine with one of the middle cylinders removed.

<text>Suiyuan () was a historical province of China. Suiyuan&#x27;s capital was Guisui (now Hohhot). The abbreviation was (pinyin: ). The area Suiyuan covered is approximated today by the prefecture-level cities of Hohhot, Baotou, Wuhai, Ordos, Bayan Nur, and parts of Ulanqab, all today part of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Suiyuan was named after a district in the capital established in the Qing Dynasty.

In the early 1930s Suiyuan was occupied by the Shanxi warlord Yan Xishan, who mined Suiyuan&#x27;s iron, reorganized the province&#x27;s finances, and brought over of land under cultivation for the first time. Most of the work and settlement of Suiyuan at this time was done by Shanxi farmer-soldiers under the direction of retired officers from Yan&#x27;s army. Yan&#x27;s control of Suiyuan was sufficient to cause one visiting reporter to refer to Suiyuan as a &quot;colony&quot; of Shanxi.

The Suiyuan campaign took place in Suiyuan during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It became a part of the puppet state of Mengjiang from 1937 to 1945 under Japanese rule.

During the Chinese Civil War in 1935, Communist leader Mao Zedong promised Mongol leaders a &quot;unified autonomous&quot; administration which would include all &quot;historic&quot; Mongol lands within China, in exchange for Mongol support against the Kuomintang. This promise included the declaration that, &quot;Under no circumstances should other [non-Mongol ethnic groups] be allowed to occupy the land of the Inner Mongolian nation&quot;. However, following the communist victory in 1949, the administrators of the soon-to-be &quot;Mongolian&quot; territories with Han Chinese majorities, the biggest of which was Suiyuan with a population of over 2 million, resisted annexation by the new Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In 1954, Mao reached a compromise with Suiyuan, which involved the Mongols&#x27; taking over the administration of Suiyuan, but stipulated that the Han natives not be expelled from the territory. Uradyn Bulag thus notes that &quot;ironically&quot;, the Mongols&#x27; territorial ambitions against Suiyuan resulted in their becoming a &quot;small minority within their own [enlarged] autonomous region&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
* W. Douglas Burden references Suiyuan in his book &quot;Look to the Wilderness&quot;, in the chapter &quot;On the Sino-Mongolian Frontier&quot;.

<text>The Chahars (Khalkha Mongolian: Цахар, Tsahar; ) are a subgroup of Mongols that speak Chakhar Mongolian and predominantly live in southeastern Inner Mongolia, China.

The Chahars were originally one of estates of Kublai Khan located around Jingzhao (now Xi&#x27;an). They moved from Shaanxi to southeastern region controlled by the Northern Yuan dynasty based in the Mongolian Plateau in the 15th century. The Chahar became a tumen of six tumen Mongols under Dayan Khan and were led by his successors, thus becoming personal appanage of the Northern Yuan monarchs.

Oppressed by Altan Khan, the Chahars, led by Daraisung Guden Khan, moved eastward onto the Liao River in the middle of the 16th century. In the early 17th century Ligdan Khan made an expedition to the west because of pressure from the Manchu people (early named Jurchen). When he died in Gansu on his way to Tibet, his son, Ejei, surrendered to the Manchu Later Jin dynasty in 1635 and was given the title of Prince () and Inner Mongolian nobility became closely tied to the Qing royal family and intermarried with them extensively. Ejei Khan died in 1641 and was succeeded by his brother Abunai.

The Chahar royal family kept favorable relations with the Qing imperial family until Makata gege, who was a daughter of Hong Taiji and married to the Chahar Mongol prince, died in 1663. After Abunai showed disaffection with Manchu Qing rule, he was placed under house arrested in 1669 in Shenyang and the Kangxi Emperor gave his title to his son Borni. Abunai then bid his time and then he and his brother Lubuzung revolted against the Qing in 1675 during the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, with 3000 Chahar Mongol followers joining in on the revolt.

The revolt was put down within two months; the Qing then crushed the rebels in a battle on April 20, 1675, killing Abunai and all his followers. Their title was abolished, all Chahar Mongol royal males were executed even if they were born to Manchu Qing princesses, and all Chahar Mongol royal females were sold into slavery except the Manchu Qing princesses. As a result of the rebellion, the Chahar Mongols were reorganized into Banners and moved to around Zhangjiakou. The Chahar Mongols did not belong to a league but were directly controlled by the Emperor. The Qing authorities resettled some of their population from the suburbs of Hohhot and Dolon Nor to the Ili River after the fall of the Dzungar Khanate in c. 1758. They were largely mixed with the Dzungar people and Torghut of the region. 

When Outer Mongolia declared its independence from the Qing in 1911, 100 households under former vice-governor Sumya fled from Xinjiang via the Russian border to Mongolia. They were resettled by the Khalkha in the west of Kyakhta. Sumiya and his Tsahars contributed to the revolution of 1921. They are known as the Selenge&#x27;s Tsahar since settled in Selenge.

Many of the Chinese troops during the occupation of Mongolia in 1919 were Chahar Mongols, which has been a major cause for animosity between Khalkhas and Inner Mongols.

<doc id="200666" wikidata="Q1132673" url="?curid=200666" title="The Marriage of Heaven and Hell">
<text>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell is a book by the English poet and printmaker William Blake. It is a series of texts written in imitation of biblical prophecy but expressing Blake&#x27;s own intensely personal Romantic and revolutionary beliefs. Like his other books, it was published as printed sheets from etched plates containing prose, poetry, and illustrations. The plates were then coloured by Blake and his wife Catherine.

It opens with an introduction of a short poem entitled &quot;Rintrah roars and shakes his fires in the burden&#x27;d air&quot;.

William Blake claims that John Milton was a true poet and his epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; was &quot;of the Devil&#x27;s party without knowing it&quot;. He also claims that Milton&#x27;s Satan was truly his Messiah.

The work was composed between 1790 and 1793, in the period of radical ferment and political conflict during the French Revolution. The title is an ironic reference to Emanuel Swedenborg&#x27;s theological work &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, published in Latin 33 years earlier. Swedenborg is directly cited and criticised by Blake in several places in the &quot;Marriage&quot;. Though Blake was influenced by his grand and mystical cosmic conception, Swedenborg&#x27;s conventional moral strictures and his Manichaean view of good and evil led Blake to express a deliberately depolarised and unified vision of the cosmos in which the material world and physical desire are equally part of the divine order; hence, a marriage of heaven and hell. The book is written in prose, except for the opening &quot;Argument&quot; and the &quot;Song of Liberty&quot;. The book describes the poet&#x27;s visit to Hell, a device adopted by Blake from Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; and Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;.

==Proverbs of Hell==

Unlike those of Milton and Dante, Blake&#x27;s conception of Hell begins not as a place of punishment, but as a source of unrepressed, somewhat Dionysian energy, opposed to the authoritarian and regulated perception of Heaven. Blake&#x27;s purpose is to create what he called a &quot;memorable fancy&quot; in order to reveal the repressive nature of conventional morality and institutional religion, which he describes thus:

In the most famous part of the book, Blake reveals the Proverbs of Hell. These display a very different kind of wisdom from the Biblical Book of Proverbs. The diabolical proverbs are provocative and paradoxical. Their purpose is to energise thought. Several of Blake&#x27;s proverbs have become famous:

Blake explains that,

==Interpretation==
Blake&#x27;s theory of contraries was not a belief in opposites but rather a belief that each person reflects the contrary nature of God, and that progression in life is impossible without contraries. Moreover, he explores the contrary nature of reason and of energy, believing that two types of people existed: the &quot;energetic creators&quot; and the &quot;rational organizers&quot;, or, as he calls them in &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;, the &quot;devils&quot; and &quot;angels&quot;. Both are necessary to life according to Blake.

Blake&#x27;s text has been interpreted in many ways. It certainly forms part of the revolutionary culture of the period. The references to the printing-house suggest the underground radical printers producing revolutionary pamphlets at the time. Ink-blackened printworkers were comically referred to as a &quot;printer&#x27;s devil&quot;, and revolutionary publications were regularly denounced from the pulpits as the work of the devil.

==Doors of Perception==
The book includes &quot;If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro&#x27; narrow chinks of his cavern&quot;. This has similarities with Huxley&#x27;s concept of &quot;Mind at Large&quot;.

== Influence ==
&quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot; is probably the most influential of Blake&#x27;s works. Its vision of a dynamic relationship between a stable &quot;Heaven&quot; and an energised &quot;Hell&quot; has fascinated theologians, aestheticians and psychologists.

Aldous Huxley took the name of one of his most famous works, &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;, from this work. &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;, in turn, inspired the name of the American rock band The Doors. Huxley&#x27;s contemporary C. S. Lewis wrote &quot;The Great Divorce&quot; about the &quot;divorce&quot; of Heaven and Hell, in response to Blake&#x27;s &quot;Marriage&quot;.

According to Michel Surya, French writer Georges Bataille threw pages of Blake&#x27;s book into the casket of his friend and lover Colette Peignot on her death in 1938.

An allusion from &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;, depicting Aristotle&#x27;s skeleton, is present in Wallace Stevens&#x27;s poem &quot;Less and Less Human, O Savage Spirit&quot;.

Benjamin Britten included several of the &quot;Proverbs of Hell&quot; in his 1965 song cycle &quot;Songs and Proverbs of William Blake&quot;.

&quot;Infinite Jest&quot; by David Foster Wallace features in it an avant-garde film called &quot;The Pre-Nuptial Agreement of Heaven and Hell&quot;.

&quot;Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead&quot; by Olga Tokarczuk takes its title from one of the &quot;Proverbs of Hell&quot;.

&quot;Kelly Reichardt&quot;&#x27;s film First Cow uses one of the Proverbs of Hell (&quot;The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship&quot;) as an Epigraph.

Allusions to the work have often been made within aspects of popular culture, notably in the counterculture of the 1960s. The Norwegian experimental band Ulver released an album that was a musical setting of Blake&#x27;s book, titled &quot;Themes from William Blake&#x27;s The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;. The American black metal band Judas Iscariot extensively quotes parts of &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot; in their song &quot;Portions of Eternity Too Great for the Eye of Man&quot; (whose title itself was taken from a quote from Blake&#x27;s work). The American power metal band Virgin Steele released two albums based on Blake&#x27;s work, 1995&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell Part I&quot; and 1996&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell Part II&quot;. &quot;The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom&quot; is quoted by Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon) in the 1988 movie &quot;Bull Durham,&quot; and can be seen in writing in a scene from David Cronenberg&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;Shivers&quot;. The quote also appears (slightly paraphrased as &quot;the &quot;path&quot; of excess leads to the &quot;tower&quot; of wisdom&quot;) in the lyrics of the 1999 Enigma hit &quot;Gravity Of Love&quot;.

<text>Buddy is an animated cartoon character in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series by Leon Schlesinger Productions. He was the second star of the series, after Bosko.

==History==
Buddy has his origins in the chaos that followed after animators Hugh Harman and Rudy Ising severed their relations with producer Leon Schlesinger. Without his animators and Bosko the Talk-Ink Kid, the star character they had taken with them, Schlesinger was desperate to build his own cartoon studio and maintain his contract with Warner Bros. He lured in several animators from other studios, among them Tom Palmer from Disney. Schlesinger told his new employees to create a star character for the studio, and Palmer created Buddy in 1933, with his first film &quot;Buddy&#x27;s Day Out&quot; released on September 9.

The character had a troubled beginning, as Warner Bros. refused to accept his first two cartoons, resulting in Friz Freleng being called in to re-edit and condense them into a single short. In the book &quot;Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons&quot;, animator Bob Clampett is quoted as describing Buddy as &quot;Bosko in whiteface&quot;. Despite these initial problems, Buddy would go on to be the studio&#x27;s linchpin character for the next two years.

Music dominates in Buddy&#x27;s world. The characters add visuals to the soundtrack and participate in gags. Buddy is usually accompanied in his films by his flapper girlfriend, Cookie, and his dog, Towser. The character would go on to star in 23 short films from 1933 to 1935, before he was retired to make way for a new character called Beans the Cat. Beans became the third Looney Tunes star, though later on replaced by the more popular Porky Pig. Buddy&#x27;s voice was most of the time performed by animator Jack Carr.

Buddy had various designs throughout the course of his career. Initially, the character was a younger boy with trousers, a polo shirt, and a large cap, as seen in &quot;Buddy&#x27;s Day Out.&quot; In &quot;Buddy&#x27;s Beer Garden&quot;, he was redesigned by Earl Duvall into a young man wearing a jacket with a small bow tie and long pants. Friz Freleng gave the character another design, which was nearly identical to Duvall&#x27;s except he is smaller and does not wear a jacket. Ben Hardaway later redesigned Buddy to look more like his predecessor, Bosko.

==Reception==
Buddy is widely considered to be the worst character in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; franchise. In &quot;That&#x27;s All, Folks! The Art of Warner Bros. Animation&quot;, Steve Schneider describes Buddy as &quot;a creature of limitless blandness,&quot; and calls &quot;Buddy&#x27;s Day Out&quot; &quot;a nondescript adventure spree.&quot; Schneider says that &quot;probably the best of the run is his farewell film, &quot;Buddy the Gee Man&quot;&quot;, but &quot;about the most that can be said for Buddy is that he is distinctly forgettable.&quot;

==Filmography==
==&quot;Mr. and Mrs. Is the Name&quot;==
The 1935 &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Is the Name&quot;, in which mermaid characters resembling Buddy and Cookie find a treasure trove, was Buddy&#x27;s first and only color appearance; however, whether the short should be considered official is in doubt, as the characters are not named.

==Modern appearances==
Buddy&#x27;s first (and so far only) new appearance after his original series ended in 1935 came in the 1993 animated series &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, where he appeared in the episode &quot;The Warners&#x27; 65th Anniversary Special&quot; as the main antagonist of that episode. It was broadcast on May 23, 1994. In this episode, it was revealed (in the series&#x27; fictional history) that Yakko, Wakko, and Dot were created to spice up Buddy&#x27;s dull cartoons; these series of Buddy-Warner shorts mainly consisted of the Warners smashing Buddy on the head with mallets. After Buddy was dropped by the studio in favor of the Warners, Buddy retired to become a nut farmer in Ojai, California, but hated the Warners for ruining his career, and made a failed attempt at the Anniversary Special to enact revenge on the Warner Siblings for ruining his career 65 years ago. Jim Cummings provided Buddy&#x27;s voice here. The cartoons he starred in with the Warners shown were &quot;Outback Buddy&quot;, &quot;Postman Buddy&quot;, &quot;Gardening Buddy&quot;, &quot;Baker Buddy&quot;, and &quot;Busdriver Buddy&quot; (all were dated from the main Bosko until the early Buddy years).

On the PBS series &quot;History Detectives&quot;, a collection of Buddy cels from Buddy&#x27;s first appearance &quot;Buddy&#x27;s Day Out&quot; is the focus of a 2010 episode.

<text>Huperzioideae is a subfamily of lycopsids in the family Lycopodiaceae. It has sometimes been recognized as a separate family, Huperziaceae. The Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) recognizes three extant genera:
* &quot;Huperzia&quot; (temperate firmosses); about 25 species; terrestrial.
* &quot;Phlegmariurus&quot; (tropical firmosses); about 250 species; previously included in &quot;Huperzia&quot;; mainly epiphytes.
* &quot;Phylloglossum&quot; (pygmy clubmoss); formerly thought to be only distantly related to &quot;Huperzia&quot;. This is a terrestrial, grass-like plant with basal, 2–5 cm long, fleshy leaves. The only accepted species is &quot;Phylloglossum drummondii&quot;.

The plants are distinct from those of other members of the Lycopodiaceae in having erect (not creeping) growth; and in their spore-bearing structures being produced in the axils of unmodified leaves, rather than in terminal club-like structures. The subfamily also has a basal chromosome count of &quot;n&quot;=67, versus counts of &quot;n&quot;=23, 34 in the Lycopodiaceae.

<text>The Lycopodiaceae (class Lycopodiopsida, order Lycopodiales) are an old family of vascular plants, including all of the core clubmosses and firmosses, comprising 17 accepted genera and about 500 known species. This family originated about 380 million years ago in the early Devonian, though the diversity within the family has been much more recent. &quot;Wolf foot&quot; is another common name for this family due to the resemblance of either the roots or branch tips to a wolf&#x27;s paw.

==Description==
Members of Lycopodiaceae are not spermatophytes and so do not produce seeds. Instead they produce spores, which are oily and flammable, and are the most economically important aspects of these plants. The spores are of one size (i.e. the plants are isosporous) and are borne on a specialized structure at the apex of a shoot called a strobilus (plural: strobili), which resembles a tiny battle club, from which the common name derives. Members of the family share the common feature of having a microphyll, which is a &quot;small leaf with a single vein, and not associated with a leaf gap in the central vascular system.&quot; In Lycopodiaceae, the microphylls often densely cover the stem in a linear, scale-like, or appressed fashion to the stem, and the leaves are either opposite or spirally arranged. The club mosses commonly grow to be 5–20 cm tall. The gametophytes
in most species are non-photosynthetic and myco-heterotrophic, but the subfamily Lycopodielloideae and a few species in the subfamily Huperzioideae have gametophytes with an upper green and photosynthetic part, and a colorless lower part in contact with fungal hyphae. In Lycopodioideae monoplastidic meiosis is common, whereas polyplastidic meiosis is found in Lycopodielloideae and Huperzioideae.

==Taxonomy==
The family Lycopodiaceae is considered to be basal within the Lycopodiopsida (lycophytes). One hypothesis for the evolutionary relationships involved is shown in the cladogram below.

Within the family, there is support for three subgroups. In 2016, Field et al. proposed that the primary division is between Lycopodielloideae plus Lycopodioideae and the Huperzioideae (names &quot;sensu&quot; PPG I). 

There are about 400 known species in the family Lycopodiaceae. Sources differ in how they group these into genera. Field et al. (2016) say &quot;Most Lycopodiaceae species have been re-classified into different genera several times, leading to uncertainty about their most appropriate generic identification.&quot; In the PPG I system, the family has 16 accepted genera, grouped into three subfamilies, Lycopodielloideae, Lycopodioideae and Huperzioideae, based in part on molecular phylogenetic studies. The Huperzioideae differ in producing spores in small lateral structures in the leaf axils, and it has been suggested that they be recognized as a separate family. Other sources use fewer genera; for example, the three genera placed in the subfamily Huperzioideae in PPG I, &quot;Huperzia&quot;, &quot;Phlegmariurus&quot; and &quot;Phylloglossum&quot;, have also all been treated within a broadly defined &quot;Huperzia&quot;.

The species within this family generally have chromosome counts of &quot;n&quot;=34. A notable exception are the species in &quot;Diphasiastrum&quot;, which have counts of &quot;n&quot;=23.

===Genera===
, the &quot;Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World&quot; recognized the following genera as members of Lycopodiaceae. All of these are recognized by the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), except for the genus &quot;Brownseya&quot;, described in 2021. Other classifications circumscribe the genera in the family more broadly, recognizing the subfamilies Lycopodielloideae, Lycopodioideae, and Huperzioideae as the genera &quot;Lycopodiella&quot;, &quot;Lycopodium&quot;, and &quot;Huperzia&quot;.

Phylogeny of Lycopodiaceae

==Distribution and habitat ==
The members of Lycopodiaceae are terrestrial or epiphytic in habit and are most prevalent in tropical mountain and alpine environments. Though Lycopodiaceae are most abundant in these regions, they are cosmopolitan, excluding arid environments.

== Evolution ==
Lycopodiaceae (homosporous lycophytes) split off from the branch leading to &quot;Selaginella&quot; and &quot;Isoetes&quot; (heterosporous lycophytes) about ~400 million years ago, during the early Devonian. The two subfamilies Lycopodioideae and Huperzioideae diverged ~350 million years ago, but has evolved so slowly that about 30% of their genes are still in syntenic blocks (remaining in the same arrangement). They have also gone through independent whole genome duplications. In most plants the majority of duplicate genes are lost relatively quickly through diploidization, but in this group both sets of genes tends to be retained with relatively few alterations, even after hundreds of millions of years after the duplication event. Spores indicate that the crown group of Lycopodiaceae had emerged by the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, around 200 million years ago, with a member of the crown group of Lycopodioideae known from the Early Cretaceous of China.

==Uses==
*The running clubmosses (&quot;Diphasiastrum&quot;) have long been used as greenery for Christmas decoration.
*The spores have long been used as a flash powder. See Lycopodium powder.
*The spores have been used by violin makers for centuries as a pore filler.
*In Cornwall, club mosses gathered during certain lunar phases were historically used as a remedy for eye disease.

<text>USS &quot;Casablanca&quot; (AVG/ACV/CVE-55) was the first of fifty s built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was named after the Naval Battle of Casablanca, conducted as a part of the wider Operation Torch, which pitted the United States Navy against the remnants of the French Navy controlled by Vichy France. The American victory cleared the way for the seizure of the port of Casablanca as well as the Allied occupation of French Morocco. The ship was launched in April 1943, commissioned in July, and served as a training and transport carrier throughout the war. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet, repatriating U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She was decommissioned in June 1946, when she was mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was sold for scrap in April 1947.

==Design and description==
&quot;Casablanca&quot; was the lead ship of the &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall; at the waterline, she was long. She had a beam of , at her widest point, this was . She also had a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Power was provided by four Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boilers. Her compact size necessitated the installation of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20 mm cannons, and the amount of 40 mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Although &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to function with a crew of 860 and an embarked squadron of 50 to 56, the exigencies of wartime often necessitated the inflation of the crew count. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more, which was often necessary during transport or especially training missions, due to the constant turnover of pilots and aircraft.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington, under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942, with the classification symbol AVG-55, indicating that she would be the 55th escort carrier, AVG representing an aircraft escort vessel, numbered in the same series as the escort carriers. On 20 August, the future carrier was reclassified as ACV-55, the hull symbol representing an auxiliary aircraft carrier. The escort carrier was laid down on 3 November 1942 under the name &quot;Ameer&quot;, with the original plans calling for her transfer to the Royal Navy under the lend-lease program. She was laid down as MC hull 1092, the first of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers.

On 23 February 1943, it was determined that her sister ship , the second &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carrier to be constructed would be transferred under lend-lease in &quot;Casablanca&quot;″s place. Therefore, she was renamed &quot;Alazon Bay&quot;, a misspelling of Alazan Bay, located in Kleberg County, Texas, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds. She was then further renamed to &quot;Casablanca&quot; on 3 April, with her previous name later being assigned to the hull of her sister . She was launched on 5 April; sponsored by the First Lady Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt; transferred to the Navy on 8 July, commissioned and reclassified as &quot;CVE-55&quot; on 15 July, with Commander Steven Ward Callaway in command.

==Service history==

Upon being commissioned, it was discovered that &quot;Casablanca&quot; had a propeller defect, handicapping her speed and handling, which rendered her completely unsuitable for frontline or even transport service. Therefore, the Navy used her as a training vessel, operating in the Strait of Juan de Fuca to provide pilot certifications. For the next year, until August 1944, a steady stream of carrier squadrons were trained on board &quot;Casablanca&quot;, rotating off for service on a frontline carrier once they had finished qualifications. In addition, she was used as a training vessel for crews bound for the other &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers prior to commissioning, with crews typically spending two weeks learning how to operate the equipment and how to maneuver the ship. These crews would therefore report for service on their newly commissioned &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers with a modicum of experience. The Navy also used &quot;Casablanca&quot; as a ship to gather data on how the escort carriers fared during prolonged periods at sea, measuring her material readiness and the ability of her equipment. Lessons learned on &quot;Casablanca&quot; were therefore implemented on &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers to come.
In the summer of 1944, &quot;Casablanca&quot; was put into dry dock, and her propeller defect was corrected. Hence, she was certified to begin transport missions. On 24 August, after taking on a load of personnel, airplanes, and aviation gasoline at Naval Air Station Alameda, she put through the Golden Gate Bridge, and passed San Francisco en route to Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands. She returned to Seattle on 8 October, and immediately continued her previous duties in Puget Sound as a training carrier, carrying out much of the same activities, this time preparing the pre-commissioning crews of s. During this period, she was damaged by a storm, and proceeded into San Diego harbor on 22 January 1945 for repairs. On 12 February, Captain John Lewis Murphy assumed command of the vessel.
&quot;Casablanca&quot; returned to sea on 13 March, and with her repairs completed, she proceeded westwards for another transport mission. Stopping at Pearl Harbor, she headed to Guam, where she unloaded some of her cargo. She then carried out transport runs between Samar in the Philippines, Manus, and Palau until 12 May, when she proceeded back to the West Coast for overhaul, carrying on board a load of medically unfit personnel. Upon arrival, she replenished and was sent west again, delivering passengers to Pearl Harbor on 24 June. She spent the summer making transport runs from the West Coast to Pearl Harbor and Guam. During one of these transport missions, whilst arriving at Guam, the Surrender of Japan was announced.

After a brief period in which &quot;Casablanca&quot; yet again served as a training carrier providing pilot qualifications off of Saipan in August, she was retrofitted into a troopship, and joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. Her first run concluded in San Francisco on 24 September. She then ferried some personnel to Pearl Harbor in September and October. At Pearl Harbor, she made her second run, stopping at Espiritu Santo and Nouméa, repatriating servicemen to the West Coast. Her third and final run, which ran from 8 December to 16 January 1946, was a run from San Francisco to Yokohama, occupied Japan.

&quot;Casablanca&quot; left San Francisco harbor on 23 January, proceeding to Norfolk, Virginia, arriving on 10 February. There, she was mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet on 30 May. She was decommissioned on 10 June, and struck from the Navy list on 3 July. She was sold on 23 April 1947 for scrapping, ultimately being broken up in Chester, Pennsylvania, throughout the latter half of 1947.

<text>Mengjiang, also known as Mengkiang, officially the Mengjiang United Autonomous Government, was an autonomous zone in Inner Mongolia, formed in 1939 as a puppet state of the Empire of Japan, then from 1940 being under the nominal sovereignty of the Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China (which was itself also a puppet state). It consisted of the previously Chinese provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, corresponding to the central part of modern Inner Mongolia. It has also been called Mongukuo or Mengguguo (or Mengkukuo; ; in analogy to Manchukuo, another Japanese puppet state in Manchuria). The capital was Kalgan, from where it was under the nominal rule of Mongol nobleman Demchugdongrub. The territory returned to Chinese control after the defeat of the Japanese Empire in 1945.

== Background ==
Following Japan&#x27;s occupation of Manchuria in 1931 and the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo, Japan sought to expand its influence in Mongolia and North China. In a series of actions, starting in 1933, the armies of Manchukuo and Japan occupied Chahar and in 1936 proclaimed itself the independent Mongol Military Government, allied with Japan under Prince Demchugdongrub. 
In 1936 and 1937, similar operations in Suiyuan saw the occupation and absorption of that province, too.

== History ==
Formed on May 12, 1936, the Mongol Military Government () had Prince Yondonwangchug of Ulanqab as its first chairman. It was renamed in October 1937 as the Mongol United Autonomous Government (). On September 1, 1939, the predominantly Han Chinese governments of South Chahar and North Shanxi were merged with the Mongol United Autonomous Government, creating the new Mengjiang United Autonomous Government (). The capital was established at Zhangbei (Changpei), near Kalgan (Zhangjiakou), with the government&#x27;s control extending around Hohhot. On August 4, 1941, it was again renamed: the Mongolian Autonomous State (). The term &quot;state&quot; (邦) was specifically chosen to appease both the Chinese and Mengjiang governments, as both &quot;state&quot; and &quot;country&quot; translated to &quot;ulus&quot; (улс) in Mongolian, which means &quot;country&quot;. Thus, the name in Chinese implied Mengjiang to be an autonomous region of China, whereas in Mongolian the name implied it to be an independent state.

In 1939, Wang Jingwei reorganized the remnants of the occupied Chinese government for a Japanese puppet state, commonly referred to as the Wang Jingwei Regime, or the Reorganized National Government, with its capital in Nanjing. Mengjiang was nominally incorporated into the regime in 1940, though it remained autonomous from Nanjing.

Mengjiang capitulated in 1945 when it was invaded by the Soviet Red Army and Mongol Red Army as part of the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation. Most of the area, with the notable exception of Kalgan, is now part of Inner Mongolia in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== Name ==
&quot;Mengjiang&quot;, meaning &quot;Mongol Territories&quot;, came from the acceptance speech of chairmanship by Demchugdongrub:
: To recover the &quot;territories&quot; originally owned by the &quot;Mongols&quot;

== Economy ==

The Japanese established the Bank of Mengjiang that printed its own currency without years on it. Some traditional local money shops also made currency with the Chinese year numbering system, such as the Jiachen Year (), on it.

The Japanese had mineral interests in their created state of Mengjiang. In one example the Japanese put the iron mine in Xuanhua Longyan into production, with a reserve of 91,645,000 tonnes in 1941; and analyzed the reserves of coal in land, one was 504 tonnes, and another with a potential production of 202,000 of tonnes (1934).

The Mengjiang iron deposits were exported directly to Japan. At the same time, the Japanese sought the coal reserves of Suiyuan (another Mengjiang occupied sector), including one of 417 million tonnes, and one with a potential extraction of 58,000 tonnes in 1940.

== Military ==

The Mengjiang National Army was the Japanese-created native army organized in Mengjiang; not to be confused with the Mongol Army. It was a Kwantung Army special force group under direct command, having native commanders alongside Japanese commanding officers, as in other auxiliary outer sections of the Kwantung Army.

The purpose of the army was to support any eventual Japanese operations against Outer Mongolia (Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic), or the north China areas, and to act as a local security force, with the local police forces. It also had the duty of protecting Prince De Wang, the head of state, and the Mengjiang native establishment and local government properties.

The army was equipped with rifles, pistols, light and medium machine guns, mortars and some artillery and anti-aircraft guns. It was organised as a mobile cavalry and light infantry force with little artillery support, and did not have tanks or aircraft.

=== History ===
In 1936, the Inner Mongolian Army was armed with Mauser rifles and they had 200 machine guns: mostly the Czechoslovak ZB-26 and a few Swiss Sig. Model 1930 submachine gun for Teh Wang&#x27;s 1,000 bodyguard troops. They had 70 artillery pieces, mostly mortars and a few captured Chinese mountain and field guns of a variety of types (making ammo and spare parts a problem). The few tanks and armored cars were captured Chinese vehicles crewed by Japanese.

After the Suiyuan Campaign, the Mengjiang National Army was rebuilt from the defeated remnants of the Inner Mongolian Army, the new eight Mongol cavalry Divisions were 1,500 men strong, in three regiments of 500 men. Each regiment were to have three Saber companies and a machine gun company of 120 men. However these divisions actually ranged in size from 1,000 men to 2,000 men (8th Division).

In 1939, the ethnic Chinese troops in the Mongol Divisions were brigaded together in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions and turned into the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Ch&#x27;ing An Tui Brigades of the &quot;Mongolian Pacification Force&quot; and used against various guerrilla groups.

In 1943, the Mongol 4th and 5th Divisions were combined to form a new 8th Division and the old 7th and 8th Divisions formed the new 9th Division. Strength of the army was between 4,000–10,000 men, all cavalry at this time and had little heavy equipment.

The Mengjiang state also had 5 Defense Divisions in 1943, made up of local militia and other security forces, nominally of three regiments. Apparently only one of these regiments in each division was capable of operations. In 1944, the Japanese reorganized them along with the Chahar garrisons into four Divisions of 2,000 men each.

At the end of the war, a total of six divisions (two Cavalry and four Infantry), three Independent Ch&#x27;ing An Tui Brigades and a &quot;Pao An Tui&quot; Security Force Regiment made up the Army.

The sole secondary language which could be taught in schools was Japanese while students were forced to pay respect to the Emperor of Japan and Shinto. The government and army of Mengjiang were complete puppets of the Japanese.

<doc id="200683" wikidata="Q229671" url="?curid=200683" title="Chelsea Clinton">
<text>Chelsea Victoria Clinton (born February 27, 1980) is an American writer. She is the only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. Secretary of State and U.S. Senator.

Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, during her father&#x27;s first term as governor of Arkansas. She attended public schools there until her father was elected president and the family moved to the White House, when she began attending the private Sidwell Friends School. Clinton received an undergraduate degree at Stanford University, later earning master&#x27;s degrees from University of Oxford and Columbia University and a Doctor of Philosophy in international relations from the University of Oxford in 2014.

In 2007 and 2008, Clinton campaigned extensively on American college campuses for her mother&#x27;s Democratic presidential nomination bid and introduced her at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. She assumed a similar role in her mother&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign, making more than 200 public appearances as her surrogate and again introducing her at the Democratic National Convention.

Clinton has worked for McKinsey &amp; Company, Avenue Capital Group, Columbia University, New York University, and NBC. She serves on several boards, including the board of the Clinton Foundation. Clinton has authored and co-authored best-selling children&#x27;s non-fiction books and has co-authored a scholarly book for adults on global health policy.

==Early life ==

Chelsea Victoria Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas on February 27, 1980. She is the only child of Hillary and Bill Clinton. Her name was inspired by a visit to the Chelsea neighborhood of London during a Christmas 1978 vacation. Hillary said that upon hearing the 1969 Judy Collins recording of the Joni Mitchell song &quot;Chelsea Morning&quot;, Bill remarked, &quot;If we ever have a daughter, her name should be Chelsea&quot;.

When Clinton was two years old, she accompanied her parents as they campaigned throughout Arkansas for her father&#x27;s gubernatorial race. She learned to read and write at a very young age. Clinton claims that she started reading the newspaper by the age of three and also wrote a letter to President Ronald Reagan when she was only five. In the letter, which was photocopied and preserved by her father, she asked President Reagan not to visit a military cemetery in West Germany that includes graves of Nazi soldiers. Clinton attended Forest Park Elementary School, Booker Arts and Science Magnet Elementary School and Horace Mann Junior High School, both Little Rock public schools. She skipped the third grade. In 1992, Clinton&#x27;s father was first elected president, and she remained active at school right until the family&#x27;s move to Washington, playing the Ghost of Christmas Past in her school&#x27;s production of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; and dancing in Little Rock&#x27;s production of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. As a young child, Clinton was raised in her father&#x27;s Southern Baptist faith.

==White House years==

Chelsea moved into the White House with her parents and was given the Secret Service codename &quot;Energy&quot; on the day of her father&#x27;s first inauguration in January 1993. Her parents wanted her to have a normal childhood, and they hoped to shield her from the media spotlight.

Hillary Clinton followed the advice of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis on raising children in the White House, and asked the press to limit coverage of Chelsea to her participation in public events such as state visits. Margaret Truman, daughter of former president Harry S. Truman, supported the Clintons, and in March 1993 wrote a letter to the editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; about the damage that could be done if the press made Chelsea a subject of intense coverage.

Following her attendance at Horace Mann Magnet Middle School in Little Rock, the Clintons decided to remove Chelsea from public school and send her to Sidwell Friends School, a private school in Washington, D.C. A veteran of Model United Nations, Clinton was a 1997 National Merit Scholarship semifinalist. She graduated from Sidwell in 1997; her father spoke at the graduation ceremony. Media speculation regarding her choice of college resulted in heavy press coverage. She ultimately chose to attend Stanford University. 

Throughout her father&#x27;s time in the White House, journalists debated the issue of allowing Clinton to retain her privacy. Most media outlets concluded that she should be off-limits due to her age, although Rush Limbaugh and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; both broadcast material mocking her appearance. During this phase of her life, her father said, &quot;We really work hard on making sure that Chelsea doesn&#x27;t let other people define her sense of her own self-worth ... It&#x27;s tough when you are an adolescent ... but I think she&#x27;ll be ok.&quot;

In early 1999, the Clintons learned of an article being planned by &quot;People&quot; that examined Chelsea&#x27;s relationship with her parents in the wake of the impending vote on President Clinton&#x27;s impeachment. The Secret Service told the magazine they had concerns that the story could compromise Chelsea&#x27;s security. &quot;People&quot; ran the story anyway, and Bill and Hillary issued a statement expressing their disappointment. Carol Wallace, &quot;People&quot;″s managing editor, felt that Chelsea, then 19, was &quot;an eyewitness to family drama and historical events&quot; and thus &quot;a valid journalistic subject&quot;. The article, entitled &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot;, was published in February 1999 with a cover photo of Chelsea and Hillary.

During her father&#x27;s eight years in office, there were 32 stories in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and 87 network news stories about Chelsea. One author determined that she had received the most television coverage of all presidential children preceding her, although they noted that only she and Maureen Reagan had a full eight years as presidential children. During the last year of her father&#x27;s presidency, Chelsea assumed some White House hostess responsibilities when her mother was campaigning for the U.S. Senate, traveling with her father on several overseas trips and attending state dinners with him.

=== Activities ===
Although her father was a Southern Baptist, Clinton was raised in and adheres to her mother&#x27;s Methodist faith. As a teenager, she attended the youth ministry group at Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, where her parents sometimes joined her. An adult group leader thought Clinton to be &quot;a terrific kid&quot; and observed that she was treated as an equal in the group.

At age four, Clinton had begun taking dance classes in Arkansas, and she continued her dance training at the Washington School of Ballet for several years. She was cast in the role of the Favorite Aunt in the 1993 Washington Ballet production of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;.

==Education and academic life==
===Stanford University===

Clinton entered Stanford University in the fall of 1997. The week before she arrived on campus, her mother published an open letter in her syndicated column asking journalists to leave her daughter alone. Chelsea arrived at Stanford in a motorcade with her parents, Secret Service agents, and almost 250 journalists. For her security, bullet-proof glass was installed in her dorm windows and surveillance cameras were placed in hallways. Secret Service agents in plain clothes lived in her dorm. With the exception of an occasional tabloid story written about her, Chelsea&#x27;s four years at Stanford remained out of public view.

Clinton obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in history, with highest honors, at Stanford in 2001. The topic of her 167-page senior thesis was the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland.

===Further education===

Starting in 2001, Chelsea pursued a master&#x27;s degree at University College of the University of Oxford where her father had studied politics as a Rhodes Scholar. Upon the recommendation of British and American advisers, the university implemented security measures, and fellow students were asked not to discuss her with the press.

Arriving at Oxford just after the September 11 attacks, Clinton was drawn to other American students who were also feeling the emotional after-effects of the trauma. She told &quot;Talk magazine&quot;:Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity&#x27;s sake. Now I find that I want to be around Americans—people who I know are thinking about our country as much as I am.

Clinton was criticized for those remarks in the London press and by the newspaper &quot;Oxford Student&quot;, whose editorial attacking her angered the university. However, people who met Clinton at that time described her as charming, poised and unaffected, as she adjusted successfully to life abroad.

At Oxford University in 2003, Clinton completed a Master of Philosophy degree in international relations. Her 132-page thesis was titled &quot;The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria: A Response to Global Threats, a Part of a Global Future&quot;, supervised by Jennifer Welsh and Ngaire Woods. Following her graduation, she returned to the United States.

In the spring of 2010, Clinton completed a Master of Public Health degree at the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University. She pursued Doctor of Philosophy coursework at New York University&#x27;s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. In 2011, Clinton transferred back to University College, Oxford, to complete her Doctor of Philosophy degree in International Relations. She stated that she took this step for the purpose of working with her preferred doctoral advisor, Ngaire Woods. Clinton finished her dissertation in New York City and was awarded the degree in May 2014. Her dissertation was entitled &quot;The Global Fund: An Experiment in Global Governance&quot;.

Clinton received an award in 2012 from interfaith organization Temple of Understanding for her &quot;work in advancing a new model of integrating interfaith and cross-cultural education into campus life&quot;, together with Imam Khalid Latif and Rabbi Yehuda Sarna.

==Professional life==

In 2003, Clinton joined the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company in New York City. She began working for Avenue Capital Group in late 2006. She has served on the board of the School of American Ballet and on IAC&#x27;s board of directors. In March 2017, Clinton was named to the board of directors of Expedia Group.

Starting in 2010, Clinton began serving as Assistant Vice-Provost for the Global Network University of New York University (NYU), working on international recruitment strategies. She is the co-founder of the Of Many Institute for Multifaith Leadership at NYU and serves as its co-chair.

In November 2011, NBC hired Clinton as a special correspondent. One of her roles was reporting stories about &quot;Making a Difference&quot; for &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and &quot;Rock Center with Brian Williams&quot;. Clinton received a three-month contract that allowed her to continue working for the Clinton Foundation and to pursue her education. The hiring &quot;was met with cries of nepotism&quot;. Despite Clinton&#x27;s lack of prior experience in broadcasting or journalism, she reportedly was hired at an annual salary of $600,000 before shifting to a month-to-month contract in 2014. During the period when she was making $600,000 per year, Clinton reportedly received approximately $26,724 for each minute that she was on the air.

Clinton&#x27;s first appearance on NBC occurred on the December 12, 2011 episode of &quot;Rock Center&quot;. Following her debut, Hank Steuver of the &quot;Washington Post&quot; commented, &quot;&#x27;Either we’re spoiled by TV’s unlimited population of giant personalities or this woman is one of the most boring people of her era&#x27;&quot;. Although she received some unfavorable reviews for her work, Clinton&#x27;s contract with NBC was renewed in February 2012. In April 2013, Clinton conducted an interview with the Geico gecko. &quot;Rock Center&quot; ended in May 2013, and she left the network in August 2014.

Clinton began teaching graduate classes at the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University in 2012.

In a 2014 interview, Clinton said, &quot;&#x27;I’ve tried really hard to care about things that were very different from my parents. I was curious if I could care about [money] on some fundamental level, and I couldn’t. That wasn’t the metric of success I wanted in my life&#x27;&quot;.

In 2020, Clinton co-founded Metrodora Ventures, a venture capital fund.

In April 2021, Clinton launched &quot;In Fact with Chelsea Clinton&quot;, a podcast on iHeartMedia&#x27;s iHeartPodcast network.

===Clinton Foundation===

Since 2011, Clinton has taken a prominent role at the family&#x27;s Clinton Foundation and has had a seat on its board. When she joined in 2013, the foundation was renamed the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. She served as co-chair for a fundraising week for the Foundation, subsequently becoming the foundation&#x27;s Vice Chair. As part of her work with the Foundation, Clinton gives paid speeches; her speaking fees go directly to the foundation, whose goals relate to improving global health, creating opportunities for women, and promoting economic growth. She focuses on early brain and language development through the Too Small to Fail initiative and supports female entrepreneurs through the Women in Renewable Energy Network.

=== Investments ===
Clinton has advocated for affordability and improved quality pediatric services for parents. In 2022, she invested in Summer Health, a startup pediatric telehealth platform that offers virtual care services connecting parents with pediatricians, sleep coaches, and lactation experts.

===Author===
====Children&#x27;s non-fiction====
In September 2015, Clinton&#x27;s first children&#x27;s book, &quot;It&#x27;s Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired and Get Going!&quot;, was published by Philomel Books. The 400-page book is aimed at middle school students (ages 10 to 14) and introduces them to a range of social issues, encouraging them to take action to make the world a better place. The paperback edition was published by Puffin Books in 2017.

In May 2017, her second children&#x27;s book, &quot;She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World &quot;, illustrated by Alexandra Boiger, was published by Philomel Books. Upon its release, the book became a bestseller, reaching No.1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Children&#x27;s Picture Books Best Sellers list on July 30, 2017. In 2019, she worked with the Berkeley, California&#x27;s Bay Area Children&#x27;s Theater in adapting the book into a musical play, &quot;She Persisted: The Musical&quot;, which ran from January to March.

In 2018, Clinton wrote a companion book featuring women around the world entitled &quot;She Persisted Around the World: 13 Women Who Changed History&quot;. The book debuted at No.2 on the &quot;Times&quot;&#x27; Children&#x27;s Picture Books Best Sellers list.

Clinton&#x27;s fourth children&#x27;s book, &quot;Start Now!: You Can Make a Difference&quot;, was published by Philomel in 2018. It is aimed at empowering young would-be activists aged seven to ten, addressing themes ranging from bullying to climate change to endangered species. In interviews, she talked about how she drew on her personal experiences and strategies for dealing with bullies growing up and as an adult.

In 2019, Clinton published her fifth children&#x27;s book, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Them Disappear: 12 Endangered Species Across the Globe&quot;. The book, illustrated by Gianna Marino, is about endangered animals and is aimed at teaching children aged four to eight about species in need of protection.

Clinton continued her children&#x27;s &quot;She Persisted&quot; series in 2020 with &quot;She Persisted in Sports: American Olympians Who Changed the Game&quot;, also published by Philomel. Again illustrated by Alexandra Boiger, this chapter book celebrates women in sports who broke records and smashed barriers with their persistence.

====Co-authored with Hillary Clinton====
In 2019, Clinton co-wrote a book with her mother, Hillary Clinton, titled &quot;The Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience&quot; and they embarked on a multi-city book tour together.

In 2020, the mother-daughter writing duo published &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Gardens&quot;, a children&#x27;s book. The book was inspired by Hillary&#x27;s mother, Dorothy Rodham, who had a passion for gardening.

====Scholarly work====
Clinton co-authored a highly praised scholarly work on global health policy with Devi Sridhar, entitled &quot;Governing Global Health: Who Runs the World and Why?&quot;, published in 2017 by Oxford University Press. The book examines the role of partnerships between public and private entities in addressing global health issues.

=== Speaking engagements ===
In February 2024, Clinton hosted a panel at Harvard Graduate School of Education on the topic of climate change and education, focusing on the role of educators in improving the lives of children affected by climate change.

==Political activities==
===Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign===


In December 2007, Clinton began campaigning in Iowa in support of her mother&#x27;s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. She appeared across the country, largely on college campuses. By early April 2008, she had spoken at 100 colleges on behalf of her mother&#x27;s candidacy.

While campaigning, Clinton answered audience questions but did not give interviews or respond to press questions, including one from a nine-year-old &quot;Scholastic News&quot; reporter asking whether her father would be a good &quot;first man&quot;. She replied, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, I don&#x27;t talk to the press and that applies to you, unfortunately. Even though I think you&#x27;re cute.&quot; Philippe Reines, her mother&#x27;s press secretary, intervened when the press attempted to approach Chelsea directly.

When MSNBC reporter David Shuster characterized Clinton&#x27;s participation in her mother&#x27;s campaign as &quot;sort of being pimped out&quot;, the Clinton campaign objected. Shuster subsequently apologized on-air and was suspended for two weeks.

The first time she was asked about her mother&#x27;s handling of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal at a campaign stop Clinton responded, &quot;I do not think that is any of your business.&quot; As she became a more experienced campaigner, she refined her responses and deflected questions on the issue with comments such as, &quot;If that&#x27;s what you want to vote on, that&#x27;s what you should vote on. But I think there are other people [who are] going to vote on things like healthcare and economics.&quot;

Hillary Clinton conceded the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination to Barack Obama on June 7, 2008.
At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Chelsea called Hillary &quot;my hero and my mother&quot; and introduced her with a long video tribute.
===Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign===


As she did in 2008, Clinton again took an active part in her mother&#x27;s presidential campaign in 2016, expanding her role as surrogate at more than 200 public events across the country, including and beyond college campuses. In July 2016, she introduced her mother at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, in a personal, emotional tribute recalling her own upbringing and describing her mother&#x27;s commitment to issues and to public service.

Even before her mother received the Democratic nomination, Clinton frequently spoke out against candidate Donald Trump&#x27;s positions and rhetoric. At one appearance in September 2016, while answering a question about her mother&#x27;s position supporting medical marijuana research, Clinton got some attention for an inaccurate comment she made regarding drug interactions with marijuana; she walked back the comment a few days later, acknowledging that she misspoke.

On November 9, 2016, Hillary Clinton conceded the presidential race to Republican candidate Donald Trump. After the 2016 election, Chelsea Clinton&#x27;s political commentary on her Twitter account led to speculation that she might have political aspirations of her own.

==Personal life==

Clinton married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky on July 31, 2010, in an interfaith ceremony at the Astor Courts estate in Rhinebeck, New York. Mezvinsky is Jewish, and his parents, Marjorie Margolies and Edward Mezvinsky, are both former members of Congress. The senior Clintons and Mezvinskys were friends in the 1990s and their children met on a Renaissance Weekend retreat in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. They first were reported to be a couple in 2005, and they became engaged over Thanksgiving weekend in 2009.

Following their wedding, the couple lived in New York City&#x27;s Gramercy Park neighborhood for three years and later purchased a $10.5 million condominium in the NoMad district of Manhattan. Their first child, a daughter named Charlotte, was born on September 26, 2014. Their second child and first son, named Aidan, was born on June 18, 2016. Shortly after Aidan was born, the family moved to the nearby Flatiron District. Their third child and second son, Jasper, was born on July 22, 2019.

==In popular culture==

Clinton is portrayed in the 1996 film &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot;, where Butt-Head flirts with her at the White House; she responds by tossing him out a window.

In &quot;&quot;, a Disney Channel Original Movie set in the year 2049, Clinton is the President of the United States.

In &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot;, the title character (Melissa Joan Hart) repeatedly imagines Clinton becoming President of the United States.

Clinton is the direct inspiration for the 2004 film &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot;, starring Mandy Moore and Matthew Goode.

In January 2015, Clinton appeared in a &quot;Sesame Street&quot; skit with Elmo, advocating the importance of reading to young children.

Clinton appeared in the final scene of series 3 on the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Derry Girls&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Munda&quot; (CVE-104) was the last of fifty United States Navy built for service during World War II. She was named after the Battle of Munda Point, which occurred on the island New Georgia, a part of the Solomon Islands in 1943. The ship was launched in May 1944, and commissioned in July, and served as an aircraft transport and as a replenishment escort carrier in the Pacific Theatre. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet, the repatriation of U.S. forces from bases scattered around the Pacific. She was decommissioned in April 1946, when she was mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in June 1960.

==Design and description==
&quot;Munda&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, with a length at the waterline, she had a beam of , at her widest point, this was , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Uniflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installation of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20 mm cannons, and the amount of 40 mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more.

==Construction==
She was laid down on 29 March 1944, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1141, by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. The vessel was originally designated ACV-104, but was redesignated CVE-104 on 15 July 1943. She was initially named after Tonowek Bay, located within Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, 23 September 1943, and renamed &quot;Munda&quot; on 6 November 1943, in honor of the Battle of Munda Point, in the Solomon Islands, which was fought in July and August of that year. &quot;Munda&quot; was launched on 27 May 1944, sponsored by Mrs. James E. Dyer, to be accepted and commissioned on 8 July 1944, under the command of Captain L. A. Pope.

==Service history==
===World War II===

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Munda&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast. She was then assigned to Carrier Transport Squadron Pacific, which shuttled aircraft and crew to bases in the West Pacific. On 16 August, she departed the West Coast, carrying 71 aircraft and 251 military passengers. She steamed for the island of Espiritu Santo, in the New Hebrides, arriving on 1 September. She then stopped at Finschhafen and Manus Island, both part of the Territory of New Guinea, before heading back to the West Coast. She proceeded to Alameda, California, where she made a brief layover. She then made another transport run, arriving back on 5 December, before making a third run on 12 December. She made three more runs until mid-1945, for six transport missions in total. During one of these runs, Captain Welton Dana Rowley took over command of the vessel on 13 May 1945. On 3 July, she sailed for Eniwetok, of the Marshall Islands, where she was assigned to become a replenishment escort carrier, supporting the Third Fleet&#x27;s frontline Fast Carrier Task Force as part of Task Group 30.8, the Fleet Oiler and Transport Carrier Group. Replenishment escort carriers such as &quot;Munda&quot; enabled the frontline carriers to replace battle losses, and to stay at sea for longer durations.

&quot;Munda&quot; met Task Group 30.8 on 20 July, and began to provide aircraft to replace losses sustained in raids against the Japanese home islands. The replenishment escort carrier fleet would meet with the Fast Carrier Task Force on designated rendezvous days, during which supplies, munitions, and aircraft would be transferred. During this time, she was anchored off Guam, where she received aircraft, munitions, and other supplies. She stopped at Guam on 26 July, before rejoining her task group on 3 August. She met with, and resupplied the Third Fleet on 3 August, 7 August, and 11 August. She departed her formation on 13 August, to head back to Guam and was en route, when the Japanese surrender was announced. After rejoining her task group, she supported the landings of Allied forces in the occupation of Japan, remaining on station through the first week of the occupation. On 10 September, she steamed into Tokyo Bay, shortly after the signing of the official surrender document.

&quot;Munda&quot; departed Tokyo Bay on 2 October, whereupon she joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. She took part in several Magic Carpet runs until 1946, when she was released from the fleet. She proceeded to Port Angeles, Washington, arriving on 18 January 1946. There, inactivation work was conducted, and she was subsequently decommissioned on 13 September, and mothballed as part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She was redesignated as a utility aircraft carrier, CVU-104, on 12 June 1955. She was transferred to Bremerton, Washington on 29 April 1958. There, she was struck from the Navy list on 1 September, and sold for scrapping on 17 June 1960 to General Ore Co., New York. She was ultimately broken up in Japan throughout October 1960. She received one battle star for her World War II service.

<text>George Graham Winterton (15 December 1946 – 6 November 2008) was an Australian academic specialising in Australian constitutional law. Winterton taught for 28 years at the University of New South Wales before taking up an appointment of Professor of Constitutional Law at the University of Sydney in 2004.

Winterton served as a member of the Executive Government Advisory Committee of the Constitutional Commission from 1985 to 1987.

==Early life==

Winterton was born in Hong Kong on 15 December 1946. His parents, Rita and Walter, had married in Hong Kong after fleeing Austria shortly after the 1938 Nazi invasion. His father practised medicine in Japanese-occupied Hong Kong and, in May 1947, he and his family sailed to London on the &quot;MV Lorenz&quot;. Walter having gained an English medical qualification, the Wintertons left Britain in 1948, arriving in Australia in November where Walter became a general practitioner in Western Australia, first at Pingelly then Mount Hawthorn and then, after the birth of George&#x27;s only sibling, Peter, at Tuart Hill from 1953. George attended the local primary schools until 1958 when he started at Hale School, then in West Perth.

==Education and early legal practice==

In 1968, George graduated with first class honours in law from the University of Western Australia. He had won four prizes, and was placed first in his final year. Winterton later completed a master&#x27;s degree by research in 1970, on the topic of the appropriations power under the Australian Constitution.

On graduation, Winterton became an articled clerk with the firm of Robinson Cox (now Clayton Utz) and was admitted to practice in Western Australia in 1970. From 1971 to 1973 he practised with the firm Frank Unmack and Cullen in Fremantle.

Winterton&#x27;s academic career began in 1968 when he served as a visiting tutor at the University of Western Australia.

==Foundation of the Aboriginal Legal Service in Western Australia==

The Chief Justice of Australia, Robert French, wrote of the early 1970s &quot;when we were involved with other Perth lawyers in establishing an Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia&quot;:
:&quot;George played a leading role, and in 1972 was chairman of the committee that became the service. In that year he sent a letter to the then Coalition government asking for a modest grant to establish a duty counsel service. The election intervened.&quot;

:&quot;The response, when it came, was astonishing. Gordon Bryant, the new minister for Aboriginal affairs, asked how much money we would need to provide representation for Aboriginal people throughout the state.&quot;

Also involved with George were &quot;a future federal minister, Fred Chaney; High Court judge Ron Wilson; the present Chief Justice of the High Court, Robert French; future state premier Peter Dowding; and others...&quot;

== Marriage and family ==

In 1976, George met Rosalind Julian who, at that time, was studying arts at the University of New South Wales. They married in 1979, and four children followed: David (LLB UNSW, 2004 Rhodes scholar), Philip (completing a law degree at the University of Technology, Sydney), Madeleine (BA Sydney) and Julia (enrolled in economics/social science, Sydney University).

==Academic career==

In 1973, Winterton won a Fulbright scholarship to study law at Columbia University in New York City, where he served as an associate-in-law, teaching legal research and writing, and international law.

While at Columbia, Winterton was interviewed for a position at the Law Faculty of the University of New South Wales, and he returned to Australia in 1975 to take up an appointment as a Senior Lecturer.

In 1983, Winterton completed his Doctorate of Juridical Science (JSD) at Columbia. His thesis on the executive power of the Commonwealth of Australia became the core of &quot;Parliament, the Executive and the Governor-General&quot;, which was published by Melbourne University Press in 1983, and which is still regarded as the leading text on the subject. In 1998, Winterton founded the &quot;Constitutional Law and Policy Review&quot;, remaining its general editor until his death.

At UNSW, Winterton taught Public Law, Succession and Advanced Equity, Advanced Administrative Law, International Law and, ultimately, Federal Constitutional Law, the High Court of Australia, Comparative Law, Legal History and Comparative Constitutional Law. He was promoted to professor of law, and was awarded a Jubilee Medallion in 1999.

In 2004, Winterton took up a position of Professor of Constitutional Law at the University of Sydney, where he taught Federal Constitutional Law, High Court of Australia, and Comparative Constitutional Law. Winterton did not sever his ties with UNSW, where he had several colleagues in his field, and the university recognised his service by appointing him Emeritus Professor in 2004.

The University of Western Australia awarded him the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws in 2007.

== Illness and death ==

In 1998 Winterton developed a rare sarcoma in his left leg, and in 2001 he was diagnosed with bowel cancer. &quot;He continued to write, teach, and publish, interrupted by operations, chemotherapy and countless investigations and procedures.&quot; Only in the last months did he cease to attend his Sydney Law School office where he would arrive around noon, and work late, often until 2:00 am. George Winterton died in Sydney on 6 November 2008, aged 61. He was survived by his mother Rita, wife Ros, four children and his brother.

==Public affairs and constitutional reform==

Winterton provided legal advice to Commonwealth and state governments, other public bodies and law firms.

Winterton criticised Sir Garfield Barwick and Sir John Kerr for not having paid closer attention to the constitution before Kerr, the governor-general, sacked the Whitlam government in 1975, with Barwick&#x27;s advice. Winterton said Barwick had invented a convention that &quot;a prime minister who cannot obtain supply ... must either advise a general election or resign&quot;, pointing out that, although section 83 of the constitution forbids the expenditure of unappropriated funds, appropriated funds had not been exhausted. The sacking, he said, diminished respect for conventions.

He served as a member of the Executive Government Advisory Committee for the Constitutional Commission in 1986 and 1987, chaired by Sir Zelman Cowen.

His &quot;Monarchy to Republic&quot; helped reignite debate over the issue of Australian republicanism. In 1993, he served as a member of the Republic Advisory Committee. He was appointed as a delegate to the 1998 Constitutional Convention. He wrote the original bi-partisan appointment model.

Chief Justice Robert French has written:

He also proposed a new preamble for the Constitution and amendments necessary to reflect a minimalist Republican model. George spelt out certain principles which should guide the formulation of a new constitutional preamble. They were reflective of his own personality and approach to legal issues. Shortly they were:
1. A conservative principle -- the existing preamble should be retained as far as possible for constitutional continuity and social harmony.
2. The preamble should be honest. It should not make promises about rights which the Constitution itself would not deliver.
3. The prose should be pithy, avoiding jargon and platitude.
4. It should embody only the most fundamental, uncontroversial and universally acceptable values.
5. It should avoid provisions likely to have legal effect. They should be found in the body of the Constitution.
His proposed preamble was founded upon the notion of popular sovereignty and ended with the words: &quot;We, the people of Australia, do hereby enact and give to ourselves this Constitution.&quot;
==Legacy==

A Gedenkschrift in celebration of his life and learning has been published: H. P. Lee and Peter Gerangelos (eds), &quot;Constitutional Advancement in a Frozen Continent: Essays in Honour of George Winterton&quot; (2009).

The inaugural George Winterton Lecture was delivered by Chief Justice Robert French, of the High Court of Australia, on 18 February 2010 at the Sydney Law School on the topic of the Executive Power under the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia.

Winterton&#x27;s textbook &quot;Australian Federal Constitutional Law: Commentary and Materials&quot;, first published in 1999, with a second edition in 2007, appeared in a third edition in 2013 with his pupil Peter Gerangelos as general editor.

<text>A web container (also known as a servlet container;
and compare &quot;webcontainer&quot;) is the component of a web server that interacts with Jakarta Servlets. A web container is responsible for managing the lifecycle of servlets, mapping a URL to a particular servlet and ensuring that the URL requester has the correct access-rights. A web container handles requests to servlets, Jakarta Server Pages (JSP) files, and other types of files that include server-side code. The Web container creates servlet instances, loads and unloads servlets, creates and manages request and response objects, and performs other servlet-management tasks. A web container implements the web component contract of the Jakarta EE architecture. This architecture specifies a runtime environment for additional web components, including security, concurrency, lifecycle management, transaction, deployment, and other services.

==List of Servlet containers==
The following is a list of notable applications which implement the Jakarta Servlet specification from Eclipse Foundation, divided depending on whether they are directly sold or not.

===Open source Web containers===
* Apache Tomcat (formerly Jakarta Tomcat) is an open source web container available under the Apache Software License.
** Apache Tomcat 6 and above are operable as general application container (prior versions were web containers only)
* Apache Geronimo is a full Java EE 6 implementation by Apache Software Foundation.
* Enhydra, from Lutris Technologies.
* GlassFish from Eclipse Foundation (an application server, but includes a web container).
* Jetty, from the Eclipse Foundation. Also supports SPDY and WebSocket protocols.
* Virgo from Eclipse Foundation provides modular, OSGi based web containers implemented using embedded Tomcat and Jetty. Virgo is available under the Eclipse Public License.
* WildFly (formerly JBoss Application Server) is a full Java EE implementation by Red Hat, division JBoss.

===Commercial Web containers===

<doc id="200692" wikidata="Q315214" url="?curid=200692" title="Tariq Aziz">
<text>Tariq Aziz (, , 28 April 1936 – 5 June 2015) was an Iraqi politician who served as Deputy Prime Minister (1979–2003), Minister of Foreign Affairs (1983–1991) and a close advisor of President Saddam Hussein. Their association began in the 1950s when both were activists for the then-banned Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party. He was both an Arab nationalist and a member of the Chaldean Catholic Church.

Due to security concerns, Saddam Hussein rarely left Iraq, so Aziz would often be Iraq&#x27;s highest level representative at international diplomatic summits. In the year prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Aziz said that the United States did not want &quot;regime change&quot; in Iraq but rather &quot;region change&quot;. He said that the Bush administration&#x27;s reasons for war were &quot;oil and Israel.&quot; After surrendering to American forces on 24 April 2003, Aziz was held in prison, first by American forces and subsequently by the new Iraqi government, in Camp Cropper in western Baghdad.

He was acquitted at trial of some charges on 1 March 2009, but was later found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to 15 years in prison on 11 March 2009 for the executions of 42 merchants found guilty of profiteering in 1992 and another seven years for relocating Kurds. On 26 October 2010, he was sentenced to death by the Iraqi High Tribunal, which sparked regional and international condemnation from Iraqi bishops and other Iraqis, the Vatican, the United Nations, the European Union and the human rights organization Amnesty International, as well as various governments around the world, such as Russia. On 28 October 2010, it was reported that Aziz, as well as 25 fellow prison inmates, had begun a hunger strike to protest the fact that they could not receive their once-monthly visit from friends and relatives, which was normally set for the last Friday of each month. Iraqi President Jalal Talabani declared that he would not sign Aziz&#x27;s execution order, thus commuting his sentence to indefinite imprisonment.

Aziz remained in custody for the rest of his life and died of a heart attack in the city of Nasiriyah on 5 June 2015, aged 79.

== Early life and education ==
Aziz was born on 28 April 1936, in the village of Tel Keppe in the Nineveh Plains, northern Iraq, to an Iraqi Assyrian family. He and his family were of the Chaldean Catholic Church. There are claims he was born Mikhail or Michael Yuhanna ( ) and later changed his name to Tariq Aziz (which denotes &quot;glorious past&quot;) to gain acceptance by the Arab and Muslim majority. This however was denied by his son.

He studied English at the University of Baghdad and later worked as a journalist, before joining the Ba&#x27;ath Party in 1957. During the 1950s, when Iraq was under the monarchical rule, Aziz along with other Ba&#x27;athists opposed the government. In 1963, he was editor of the newspaper &quot;Al-Jamahir&quot; and &quot;Al-Thawra&quot;, the main newspapers of the Ba&#x27;ath party.

==Political career==
Aziz began to rise through the ranks of Iraqi politics after the Ba&#x27;ath party came to power in 1968. He was the sole Christian holding a position of power during Hussein&#x27;s rule. Aziz became close to Saddam Hussein who heavily promoted him. He became a member of General Affairs Bureau of the Revolutionary Command Council. Aziz served as a member of the Regional Command, the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s highest governing organization from 1974 to 1977, and in 1977 became a member of Saddam&#x27;s Revolutionary Command Council. He also served as the Minister of Information from 1974 to 1977. He was also elected as a Baʿath Party regional leader.

In 1979, Aziz became Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq, and worked as a diplomat to explain Iraq&#x27;s policies to the world. In April 1980 he survived an Iranian-backed assassination attempt carried out by members of the Islamic Dawa Party. In the attack, members of Islamic Dawa Party threw a grenade at Aziz in central Baghdad. The attack killed several people. This incident formed part of the &quot;casus belli&quot; of the Iran–Iraq War.Since Saddam rarely left country, he appointed Aziz as the minister of foreign affairs in 1983. He managed to won support from the United States during the Iran–Iraq War and met then United States president Ronald Reagan in 1984. Aziz accompanied Saddam Hussein during a visit on 19–20 December 1983 from Donald Rumsfeld, then Ronald Reagan&#x27;s special envoy to the Middle East. Rumsfeld later became the American Secretary of Defense and led the coalition forces against Iraq in 2003.

Aziz also negotiated with France to buy fighter planes and established an economic alliance with the former Soviet Union. In 1988 he traveled to Geneva, Switzerland, to negotiate a treaty to end the Iran-Iraq War. After the war, tensions increased between Kuwait and Iraq, due to oil costs and debt. Aziz met Kuwaiti officials in an attempt to convince them to stop pumping excess oil.

When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, Aziz served as the international spokesman in support of the military action. He claimed the invasion was justified because Kuwait&#x27;s increased oil production was harming Iraqi oil revenues. He condemned Arab states for &quot;subservience to the United States&#x27; hegemony in the Middle East and their support for punitive sanctions.&quot; On 9 January 1991, Aziz was involved in the Geneva Peace Conference which included the United States Secretary of State, James Baker. The goal of the meeting was to discuss a possible resolution to the occupation of Kuwait. After the war when Iraq was isolated, Aziz deftly negotiated a pact with Iran.

==Iraq war==

In October 2000, the then-junior Minister for Foreign Affairs from Britain, Peter Hain, set up a secret war avoidance team to carry messages back and forth between himself and Aziz. After initial cooperation, Aziz rebuffed the delegations.

On 14 February 2003, Aziz reportedly had an audience with Pope John Paul II and other officials in Vatican City, where, according to a Vatican statement, he communicated &quot;the wish of the Iraqi government to co-operate with the international community, notably on disarmament&quot;. The same statement said that the Pope &quot;insisted on the necessity for Iraq to faithfully respect and give concrete commitments to resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, which is the guarantor of international law&quot;.

===Weapons of mass destruction===

Shortly after the invasion of Iraq, President George W. Bush claimed Aziz as one of the Iraqi regime who was responsible for hiding Iraqi WMD:

==Detention==

He voluntarily surrendered to American forces on 24 April 2003, after negotiations had been mediated by his son. His chief concern at the time was for the welfare of his family. At the time of his surrender, Aziz was ranked number 43 out of 55 in the American list of most-wanted Iraqis despite a belief &quot;he probably would not know answers to questions like where weapons of mass destruction may be hidden and where Saddam Hussein might be.&quot;

Before the war, Aziz claimed he would rather die than be a U.S. prisoner of war: &quot;Do you expect me, after all my history as a militant and as one of the Iraqi leaders, to go to an American prison – to go to Guantanamo? I would rather die&quot;, he told Britain&#x27;s ITV.

===Defense witness===
On 24 May 2006, Aziz testified in Baghdad as a defence witness for Ibrahim Barzan and Mukhabarat employees, claiming that they did not have any role in the 1982 Dujail massacre. He stated that the arrests were in response to the assassination attempt on Saddam Hussein, which was carried out by the Shiite Dawa Party. &quot;If the head of state comes under attack, the state is required by law to take action. If the suspects are caught with weapons, it&#x27;s only natural they should be arrested and put on trial&quot;.

He further testified that the Dujail attack was &quot;part of a series of attacks and assassination attempts by this group, including against me.&quot; He said that in 1980, Dawa Party insurgents threw a grenade at him as he visited a Baghdad university, killing civilians around him. &quot;I&#x27;m a victim of a criminal act conducted by this party, which is in power right now. So put it on trial. Its leader was the prime minister and his deputy is the prime minister right now and they killed innocent Iraqis in 1980,&quot; he said. The Dawa Party is now a party in the Shiite coalition that dominates the Iraqi government. The party&#x27;s leader, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, was prime minister until mid-May, when another leading Dawa Party figure, Nouri al-Maliki, was picked and he was able to form a new government before the end of May 2006.

In his closing remarks, he stated that &quot;Saddam is my colleague and comrade for decades, and Barzan is my brother and my friend and he is not responsible for Dujail&#x27;s events.&quot;

===Imprisonment===
On 29 May 2005, the British newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot; published letters (in Arabic and English) from Aziz written in April and May 2005, while he was in American custody, addressed to &quot;world public opinion&quot; pleading for international help to end &quot;his dire situation&quot;:

In August 2005, Aziz&#x27;s family was allowed to visit him. At the time the location of Aziz&#x27;s prison was undisclosed; his family was transported in a bus with blackened out windows.

For security reasons he was later moved to Camp Cropper, part of the huge US base surrounding Baghdad airport. His son said that while his father was in poor health, he was being well treated by prison officials. He could make 30 minutes of telephone calls monthly and had access to US Arabic-language radio and television stations. Every two months his family could send a parcel containing clothes, cigarettes, chocolate, coffee and magazines.

The spiritual leader of Iraq&#x27;s Chaldean Catholic community, Emmanuel III Delly, called for Aziz&#x27;s release in his 2007 Christmas message. Aziz was acquitted of crimes against humanity.

On 17 January 2010, Aziz suffered a stroke and was transferred from prison to hospital. On 5 August 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; released his first face-to-face interview since his surrender. On 22 September 2010, documents were released that he had given an interview about how he had told the FBI that President Hussein was &quot;delighted&quot; in the 1998 terrorist bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa but had no interest in partnering with Osama bin Laden.

===Trial===
Aziz was set to appear before the Iraqi High Tribunal set up by the Iraq Interim Government, but was not brought up on any charges until April 2008. This changed when, on 29 April 2008, Aziz went on trial over the deaths of a group of 42 merchants who were executed by the Iraqi regime in 1992, after the merchants had been charged by the Iraqi regime with manipulating food prices when Iraq was under international sanctions.

The charges brought against Aziz were reported by &quot;The Independent&quot; to be &quot;surprising&quot; as the deaths of the 42 merchants had always previously been attributed to Saddam Hussein. Nevertheless, on 11 March 2009 the Iraqi High Tribunal ruled that Aziz was guilty of crimes against humanity, and he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. On 2 August 2009, Aziz was convicted by the Iraqi High Tribunal of helping to plan the forced displacement of Kurds from northeastern Iraq and sentenced to seven years in jail. After these judgments had been passed, BBC News stated that &quot;there was no evidence that a Western court would regard as compelling that he had anything like final responsibility for the carrying out of the executions&quot; of the 42 merchants and &quot;there was no real evidence of his personal involvement and guilt&quot; with regards to the displacement of Kurds. That same year, he was acquitted in a separate trial which concerned the suppression of an uprising in Baghdad during the 1990s.

On 26 October 2010, the Iraqi High Tribunal handed down a death sentence against Aziz for the offense of &quot;persecution of Islamic parties,&quot; amongst them the serving Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki&#x27;s Islamic Dawa Party, following a crackdown on a Shia uprising after the 1991 Gulf War. The Associated Press reports that &quot;the judge gave no details of Aziz&#x27;s specific role&quot; in the crackdown. His lawyer stated that Aziz&#x27;s role in the former Iraqi government was in the arena of &quot;Iraq&#x27;s diplomatic and political relations only, and had nothing to do with the executions and purges carried during Hussein&#x27;s reign.&quot; His lawyer further stated that the death sentence itself was politically motivated and that timing of the death sentence may have been aimed at diverting international attention away from the Iraq War documents leak, which detailed crimes in which Maliki government officials have been implicated. His lawyers had 30 days to lodge an appeal, following which the court would have another 30 days to look into the appeal; if the appeal is turned down the sentence would be carried out after another 30 days. On 26 October 2010 the Vatican urged the Iraqi government not to carry out his execution, and European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton stated that Aziz&#x27;s execution would be &quot;unacceptable and the EU will seek to commute his sentence.&quot; That same day, the human rights organization Amnesty International issued a statement condemning the use of the death penalty in this case, as well as for the cases of two other former Iraqi officials; the statement also expressed concern regarding the manner in which trials may have been conducted by the Iraqi High Tribunal. On 27 October 2010, Greek President Karolos Papoulias and the Russian Foreign Ministry both released statements urging the Iraqi government not to carry out the death penalty against Aziz. Also on 27 October 2010, a spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was reported to have &quot;stressed that the UN is against the death sentence and in this case, as in all others, it is calling for the verdict to be cancelled.&quot; On 28 October 2010, it was reported that some Iraqi Bishops and many ordinary Iraqis also condemned the death penalty for Aziz. Furthermore, according to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;several international human-rights groups have criticised the procedures and questioned the impartiality of the court.&quot;

According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), his family stated that Aziz, along with 25 fellow inmates, had been on a hunger strike following the sentence to protest the denial of their once-monthly visits with family and friends, but an Iraqi court official has denied this. According to AFP, Aziz and the other prisoners were &quot;still at the site of the court in Baghdad’s Green Zone and had not been transferred back to prison where they could have received their monthly visit.&quot;

On 17 November 2010, it was reported that Iraqi President Jalal Talabani had declared that he would not sign Aziz&#x27;s execution order. On 5 December 2011, Saad Yousif al-Muttalibi, an adviser to the Prime Minister, had claimed the execution of Aziz would &quot;definitely take place&quot; after the withdrawal of American forces.

==Family==
He had four children. Aziz resigned from his post but Saddam did not accept his resignation. Ziad was eventually released from prison by Saddam.

Ziad Aziz now lives in Jordan with his wife, four children. Tariq Aziz&#x27;s wife and another son live in Jordan.

==Illness and death==
Tariq Aziz died on 5 June 2015 in al-Hussein hospital in the city of Nasiriyah, at the age of 79. According to his lawyer, he was being treated well in prison but suffered from ill health and simply wanted an end to his &quot;misery&quot;. The incarcerated Aziz suffered from depression, diabetes, heart disease, and ulcers. Aziz&#x27;s daughter, Zeinab, claimed his body was stolen at Baghdad International Airport en route to Jordan by unidentified men on 11 June, but it was recovered the day after. Jordanian authorities said the body had not been stolen, but merely delayed until the relevant paperwork was filled out. Aziz was buried in Madaba.

<text>Clerks is a 1994 American black-and-white comedy film written and directed by Kevin Smith in his feature directorial debut. Starring Smith along with Brian O&#x27;Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Marilyn Ghigliotti, Lisa Spoonauer, Jason Mewes, and Scott Mosier (with whom he also produced and edited the film), it presents a day in the lives of store clerks Dante Hicks (O&#x27;Halloran) and Randal Graves (Anderson) as well as their acquaintances. It is the first of Smith&#x27;s View Askewniverse films, and introduces several recurring characters, notably Jay and Silent Bob (played by Mewes and Smith respectively).

&quot;Clerks&quot; was initially shot for $27,575 before its film rights were purchased by Miramax and $230,000 was spent on music licensing and editing. It was shot in the convenience and video stores where Smith worked in real life. &quot;Clerks&quot; was well received by critics upon its theatrical release and grossed over $4 million in theaters, launching his career. In 2006, a sequel was released, followed by a third installment in 2022. Often regarded as a cult classic and a landmark in independent filmmaking, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2019 as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Plot ==
On his day off, Dante Hicks, a retail clerk at the Quick Stop Groceries convenience store in Leonardo, New Jersey, is instructed by his boss via phone call to cover another employee&#x27;s morning shift. Dante asks to end early at noon to play a hockey game with friends later that day, with the boss coming in himself. Arriving to find the locks to the security shutters jammed closed with gum, he drapes a sheet over the shutters with &quot;I ASSURE YOU; WE&#x27;RE OPEN!&quot; in shoe polish; he repeatedly laments, &quot;I&#x27;m not even supposed to be here today.&quot;

The first customer of the day is a man who attempts to convince cigarette-buying customers that they should buy Chewlies brand gum instead of cigarettes, displaying a bag containing what he claims is a diseased human lung corroded by tar. A crowd soon gathers around Dante, hostilely blaming him for the ills of cancer because he sells cigarettes at the man&#x27;s impassioned urging. Dante&#x27;s girlfriend Veronica Loughran enters, quickly calms the crowd down with a fire extinguisher, and confronts the man, who is revealed to be a Chewlies representative wishing to sell more gum. She then orders him out along with the crowd, chiding them for wasting their lives. Shortly after, Dante and Veronica converse behind the counter regarding Dante&#x27;s current disposition. She then encounters an old boyfriend of hers, a customer named Willam Black, and admits to Dante that she engaged in snowballing with Black and performed fellatio on 36 other guys before their current relationship. Dante jealously considers her past acts as more severe than his own, which include having sex with twelve different women before her. She then storms out, furious with Dante&#x27;s insensitivity.

Dante&#x27;s best friend, wisecracking slacker Randal Graves, soon arrives late for his own workday at the RST Video rental store next door, although he mostly keeps Dante company at the Quick Stop. Dante finds out from him that his unfaithful ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree, with whom he still secretly communicates, is engaged. Some customers they encounter are angry and demanding, others are clueless and impolite, and still others prove unexpectedly wise. During lunch, Dante and Veronica reconcile their respective sexual pasts. Dante is notified that his boss is vacationing in Vermont, leaving him to run the store. Dante convinces his friends to have their hockey game on the roof, and temporarily closes it down. Twelve minutes in, an irate customer arrives, demanding that Dante open the store and criticizing his playing, and ultimately sabotages the game. After Dante discovers that an ex-girlfriend of his, Julie Dwyer, has passed away, he and Randal temporarily depart for the memorial service. The visit is disastrous, and the two flee the funeral home; their conversation when they return to the store reveals that Randal accidentally toppled Julie&#x27;s casket.

Two of Dante&#x27;s former high school classmates, Rick Derris and Heather Jones, inform him that everyone in their graduating class, except for him, knew of Caitlin&#x27;s infidelity and that Rick even had sexual intercourse with Caitlin. A health department representative interrupts the conversation and questions Dante about his earlier whereabouts, then fines him $500 for selling cigarettes to a four-year-old, even though Randal actually sold them. Afterwards, Caitlin visits Dante, having ended her engagement. Torn between her and Veronica, he finally pursues a date with Caitlin, returning to his house to prepare. However, an incident in the store bathroom renders her catatonic; in the darkness, she had sex with who she thought was Dante but was really an elderly customer who suffered a fatal heart attack while masturbating to a pornographic magazine Dante provided him earlier. She is carted away in an ambulance along with the corpse.

Drug dealers Jay and Silent Bob enter the Quick Stop to shoplift and unsuccessfully invite Dante to party with them after hours. Aware of Dante&#x27;s problems, Silent Bob tersely reasons that he truly loves Veronica, but Randal reveals he has already confessed the previous events to her, and she furiously and dramatically dumps Dante. Upset and furious, Dante brawls with Randal, trashing the Quick Stop in the process.

After a brief crucial moment of clarity between them, Dante rants at Randal, blaming him for the day&#x27;s events before repeating his relent of &quot;I&#x27;m not even supposed to be here today!&quot;. Randal furiously blows up at Dante, reminding him that he abandoned his post to slack off several times of his own accord, but arrived at work nevertheless and could&#x27;ve left at any point but didn&#x27;t, and furthermore neither of them are as &quot;advanced&quot; as they think they are, otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t be stuck with such lowly jobs. The two reconcile and clean up, with Dante planning to take the next day off to visit Caitlin in the hospital and attempt reconciliation with Veronica. Before departing, Randal tosses Dante&#x27;s shoe-polish sign in his face and declares, &quot;You&#x27;re closed!&quot;

== Cast ==
== Production ==
=== Development ===
When writing the script, writer and director Kevin Smith based the character of Dante Hicks on himself, Randal Graves on his friend Bryan Johnson, who appeared in Smith&#x27;s subsequent films as Steve-Dave Pulski, and Jay on Jason Mewes, who ended up playing him in the movie.

=== Casting ===
Many of Smith&#x27;s family and friends played roles due to budget constraints. One of them, Walt Flanagan, who, in addition to creating the character of Silent Bob&#x27;s Russian metal-head cousin Olaf, plays four roles in this film: The &quot;Woolen Cap Smoker&quot; in the beginning, the famous &quot;Egg Man&quot; (both in which he reprises in &quot;Clerks III&quot;), the &quot;Offended Customer&quot; during the &quot;jizz mopper&quot; scene, and the &quot;Cat Admiring Bitter Customer&quot;, as well as the final RST Video customer in a deleted scene. Smith never intended for Flanagan to play this many roles, but had to as the actors he got to play them just did not show up, and would often, in jest, refer to Flanagan as &quot;the Lon Chaney of the &#x27;90s&quot;. Flanagan would also appear in Smith&#x27;s subsequent films as Walt &quot;The Fanboy&quot; Grover opposite Johnson&#x27;s Steve-Dave.

Brian O&#x27;Halloran, a stage actor local to Kevin Smith, discovered an audition notice for the film that Smith gave to his community theatre. O&#x27;Halloran answered the notice and auditioned, unaware that he would be cast as the film&#x27;s main character Dante; during auditioning, O&#x27;Halloran was informed by a friend of Smith&#x27;s that all of the main characters were already cast.

Smith originally wrote the part of Randal for himself, dryly admitting in the DVD audio commentary to be the reason why he gave Randal his most-liked lines. However, Smith found that writing, directing, working at the store and playing a lead role all simultaneously was too difficult, and he constantly forgot his lines in the process, so he gave the role of Randal to his friend, Jeff Anderson, while Smith took on the less-demanding role of Silent Bob.

To acquire the funds for the film, Smith sold off a large portion of his extensive comic book collection in 1993, which he later bought back; borrowed $3,000 from his parents; maxed out eight to ten credit cards with $2,000 limits; and spent a portion of funds he got back from his college education, paychecks from working at Quick Stop and RST, and insurance money awarded for property of his lost and/or damaged in a storm-flood, thus adding up the total budget to $27,575.

=== Filming ===
&quot;Clerks&quot; was shot on an Arriflex SR-2 camera, utilizing black-and-white 16mm Kodak Plus X film stock, and roughly edited due to its small budget. The film was shot in 21 days (with two &quot;pick-up&quot; days).

The Quick Stop convenience store, located at 58 Leonard Avenue in Leonardo, New Jersey, where Smith worked, was the primary setting for the film. He was only allowed to film in the store at night while it was closed (from 10:30 p.m. to 5:30 a.m.), hence the plot point of the shutters being closed due to a vandal having jammed gum in the padlocks. Because Smith was working at Quick Stop during the day and shooting the film at night, he frequently slept no more than an hour a day. By the end of the 21-day shoot, Smith was unable to stay awake while Dante and Randal&#x27;s fight was shot.

Jason Mewes, who plays Jay, is not in any of the photoshoots for &quot;Clerks&quot;. Miramax Films, who bought the film&#x27;s distribution rights following its run at the Sundance Film Festival, believed Jay had no commercial appeal, and would scare audiences rather than entice them.

The MPAA originally gave the film an NC-17 rating based purely on the film&#x27;s explicit dialogue. Despite the rating, the movie contains no violence aside from Dante and Randal&#x27;s fight near the end, no sex and no clearly depicted nudity. This had serious financial implications, as very few cinemas in the United States screened NC-17 films. Miramax Films hired civil liberties lawyer Alan Dershowitz to appeal the decision. However, the case was ultimately argued by a Miramax Films lawyer. The MPAA relented and re-rated the film with the more commercially viable &quot;R&quot; rating, without any alterations.

=== Lost scene ===
The events of Julie Dwyer&#x27;s wake were written by Smith but were not filmed due to the prohibitive cost of producing the scene. In 2004, the scene was produced in colored animation using the same style of &quot;&quot;, featured O&#x27;Halloran and Anderson reprising their roles and Joey Lauren Adams in a cameo as her character Alyssa Jones, who&#x27;d later appear in further View Askewniverse films, for the tenth anniversary DVD release. The &quot;lost scene&quot; was also presented in comic-book form of the &quot;Clerks&quot; comic book series, with the title of &quot;The Lost Scene&quot;.

=== Original ending ===
The original ending for the film was meant to continue from when Randal throws the &quot;I Assure You We&#x27;re Open&quot; sign to Dante. After Randal leaves, Dante proceeds to count out the register and does not notice another person entering the store. Dante at first thinks it&#x27;s Randal but looks up and informs the person that the store is no longer open. The man then pulls out a gun and shoots Dante, killing him. Afterward, the man puts all the money from the cash register in a bag and walks out of the store. The sequence ends with Dante&#x27;s dead face looking off past the camera; after the credits roll – the soundtrack over it being a cash register making noises – a customer (played by Smith with his beard shaved off) wearing glasses and in a ponytail and a baseball jersey comes into the store, sees no one around (as Dante is lying dead behind the counter), steals a pack of cigarettes, and runs off.

The depressing ending was criticized by Bob Hawk and John Pierson after its first screening at the Independent Feature Film Market, and under Pierson&#x27;s advice, Smith cut the ending short, ending with Randal&#x27;s departure and deleting Dante&#x27;s death. Fans have since analyzed the death of Dante as an homage to the ending of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), which is discussed earlier in the film as Dante&#x27;s favorite &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie because &quot;it ended on such a down note&quot;. The film&#x27;s extended cut also implied that, because Randal disconnected the security camera earlier in the day during the roof hockey scene, the killer would never be caught.

Smith has since claimed he concluded &quot;Clerks&quot; this way for three reasons. The primary reason was irony, the ending would be the payoff for Dante&#x27;s repeated claims of &quot;I&#x27;m not even supposed to be here today!&quot; Smith also stated that the ending was an homage to the ending of one of his favorite films, Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Do The Right Thing&quot; (1989), a comedic film with a dark ending. Lee&#x27;s name can also be seen in the &quot;special thanks&quot; portion of the credits. Smith also stated that he ended &quot;Clerks&quot; with Dante&#x27;s death because he &quot;didn&#x27;t know how to end a film&quot;. Both versions are available in &quot;Clerks X&quot;, the tenth-anniversary special edition; the lost ending itself was among the extras on the 1995 LaserDisc and the 1999 DVD release; Smith states in the audio commentary on the 1999 DVD that had he kept the original ending, likely no further View Askewniverse films would have been made. The culprit in question was played by Smith&#x27;s cousin John Willyung, who went on to appear in Smith&#x27;s later films (most notably as Cohee Lunden in &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; and &quot;Clerks III&quot; and as himself in &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&quot;). On their movie review show, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert (both of whom had given thumbs-up reviews to the film in 1994) had a special segment on a November 1995 episode that presented and discussed this original ending. Siskel said that having the alternate ending could have worked but it would have to be longer with more build-up to suggest that something like this could happen, while Ebert said he understood Smith&#x27;s desire to do something memorable/shocking to end the film but concluded &quot;ultimately, I&#x27;m glad Smith decided to spare Dante.&quot;

==Release==
Originally playing at the Sundance Film Festival in early 1994, &quot;Clerks&quot; was picked up by Miramax Films and released in theaters. It also became a surprise hit, grossing over $3 million in the United States despite never playing on more than 100 theater screens in the United States at the same time. It grossed $1.3 million internationally for a worldwide gross of $4.4 million.

== Reception ==
&quot;Clerks&quot; was well received by critics and developed a cult following. On Rotten Tomatoes, it currently has an approval rating of 90% based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 7.50/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;With its quirky characters and clever, quotable dialogue, &quot;Clerks&quot; is the ultimate clarion call for slackers everywhere to unite, and, uh, do something, we guess?&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of a possible four, praising it for interestingly depicting a full day of &quot;utterly authentic&quot; middle-class life, adding: &quot;Within the limitations of his bare-bones production, Smith shows great invention, a natural feel for human comedy, and a knack for writing weird, sometimes brilliant, dialogue.&quot; Peter Travers gave the film four out of four stars, calling attention to Anderson&#x27;s &quot;deadpan comic brilliance&quot; and writing that &quot;Smith nails the obsessive verbal wrangling of smart, stalled twentysomethings who can&#x27;t figure out how to get their ideas into motion.&quot;

In 2000, readers of &quot;Total Film&quot; voted &quot;Clerks&quot; the 16th-greatest comedy film of all time and in 2006, &quot;Empire&quot; listed &quot;Clerks&quot; as the fourth greatest independent film. The film is also No. 33 on Bravo&#x27;s 100 Funniest Movies. In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it 13th on &quot;The Cult 25: The Essential Left-Field Movie Hits Since &#x27;83&quot; and 21st on &quot;The Comedy 25: The Funniest Movies of the Past 25 Years&quot;. Also in 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; named it one of their &quot;500 Greatest Movies of All-Time&quot;, placing it 361st on the list. The film was also one of the 500 films nominated for a spot on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years…100 Laughs but failed to make the top 100. The film was also included in the book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;.

In 2019, &quot;Clerks&quot; was among 25 films chosen to be added to the Library of Congress&#x27; National Film Registry.

&quot;Clerks&quot; was re-released on October 18th and 19th, 2024 in select Cineplex theaters for its 30th anniversary.

== Home media ==
&quot;Clerks&quot; was first released on VHS on May 23, 1995. This was followed by a LaserDisc version on August 30, 1995, and a DVD on June 29, 1999. The laserdisc and DVD versions feature the original letterboxed version of the film, audio commentary by Smith and various cast and crew members, seven deleted scenes from the film, a theatrical trailer, and a music video for Soul Asylum&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Even Tell&quot; directed by Smith which features him, Mewes, Anderson and O&#x27;Halloran reprising their roles from the film.

The film was released on UMD (playable on PlayStation Portable) on November 15, 2005. Special features include &quot;Clerks: The Lost Scene&quot;, &quot;The Flying Car&quot;, and original cast auditions. In the fall of 2006, a new edition of the &quot;Clerks&quot; DVD appeared in Canada, dubbed the &quot;Clerks: Snowball Edition&quot;. This release is the 1999 DVD with a new slipcover with a photo of a bikini-clad model, made to resemble one of the porn videos Randal mentions in the film. Smith was not involved in, nor was aware of this release.

Outside the United States, Clerks was distributed in the United Kingdom by Artificial Eye with Fox Video through Fox Guild Home Entertainment handling rental sales, and in Canada by Alliance Atlantis. Since 2020, DVD and Blu-Ray distribution has been handled by Paramount Home Entertainment following Paramount Global&#x27;s acquisition of 49% of Miramax.

=== 2004 &quot;Clerks X&quot; special edition ===
On September 7, 2004, &quot;Clerks X&quot; was released to celebrate the film&#x27;s tenth anniversary. This three-disc set includes, among other things, the features from the initial 1999 DVD, the aforementioned &quot;Lost Scene&quot;, an unrestored &quot;First Cut&quot; featuring the deleted scenes and original ending intact, original cast auditions, a new making-of documentary entitled &quot;The Snowball Effect&quot;, a &quot;Tonight Show&quot; short film starring Dante and Randal entitled &quot;The Flying Car&quot;, Smith and Mosier&#x27;s student film &quot;Mae Day&quot;, eight MTV spots with Jay and Silent Bob, deleted scenes from &quot;The Snowball Effect&quot;, still galleries, a 10 year anniversary Q&amp;A with Smith, Mosier, Mewes, O&#x27;Halloran, Anderson, Marilyn Ghigliotti, and cinematographer David Klein, and eight articles and reviews. Many of these features feature new video introductions from Smith and Mosier. All these features were carried over to the 15th Anniversary Blu-ray on November 17, 2009, along with a new documentary, &quot;Oh, What a Lovely Tea Party&quot;—originally made for Smith&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;. Unlike the initial 1999 DVD, &quot;Clerks X&quot; is no longer in print.

== Soundtrack ==

The soundtrack was released on October 11, 1994 by Columbia Records under their Chaos imprint. It was composed of various new and previously released songs by alternative rock, grunge and punk rock artists such as Bad Religion, Love Among Freaks, Alice in Chains and Soul Asylum. The soundtrack also featured various sound clips from the film. It has been noted that &quot;Clerks&quot; is one of the very few films in which the cost of obtaining the rights to the music used was a great portion of the production costs for the entire film.

The Soul Asylum song &quot;Can&#x27;t Even Tell&quot;, which was played over the film&#x27;s end credits and featured on the soundtrack, peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1994. The music video for the song was directed by Smith and was filmed in the same locations as the film. The video featured Smith, Jason Mewes, Jeff Anderson and Brian O&#x27;Halloran reprising their roles from &quot;Clerks&quot;.

Another song which appeared on the soundtrack was &quot;Got Me Wrong&quot; by Alice in Chains, which had previously been released on the band&#x27;s extended play &quot;Sap&quot; (1992). The song was issued as a single in late 1994, due to renewed radio interest from the song&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Clerks&quot;. The song peaked at #7 on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks and #22 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks in early 1995.

== Sequels ==
Although not direct sequels in terms of addressing the original film&#x27;s storyline, characters from the original &quot;Clerks&quot; – primarily Jay and Silent Bob – appeared in the films &quot;Mallrats&quot; (1995), &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; (1997), &quot;Dogma&quot; (1999), &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; (2001) and &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&quot; (2019), all of which take place in the same continuity as &quot;Clerks&quot;. Dante and Randal also reprised their roles in &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, which was originally promoted as the finale to the series, but an official sequel to &quot;Clerks&quot; was announced a few years later.

=== &quot;Clerks II&quot; ===

The live-action, feature film sequel to &quot;Clerks&quot; was released on July 21, 2006. The working title was &quot;The Passion of the Clerks&quot;, though the film was released under the title &quot;Clerks II&quot;. The credits for &quot;Dogma&quot; stated: &quot;Jay and Silent Bob will return in &quot;Clerks 2: Hardly Clerkin″ &quot;&quot;; however, that project &quot;evolved&quot; into &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;. The sequel features O&#x27;Halloran, Anderson, Mewes and Smith (in addition to returning as writer, director and editor) reprising their roles as Dante, Randal, Jay and Silent Bob. The former two now work at a Mooby&#x27;s restaurant after Randal accidentally destroys the Quick Stop and RST Video while the latter two, having sobered up after six months in rehab, continue their drug selling antics in the parking lot of the restaurant.

=== &quot;Clerks III&quot; ===

During interviews for &quot;Clerks II&quot;, Smith briefly discussed the possibility of a &quot;Clerks III&quot;. Stating that &quot;if there&#x27;s ever gonna be a &quot;Clerks III&quot;, it would be somewhere down the road in my 40s or 50s, when it might be interesting to check back in on Dante and Randal. But I don&#x27;t know about Jay and Bob so much, &#x27;cause at 45, leaning on a wall in front of a convenience store might be a little sad.&quot; Smith repeated this sentiment on one of the audio commentary tracks on the &quot;Clerks II&quot; DVD, to which Anderson jokingly replied, &quot;Oh, don&#x27;t get me started&quot;, referring to Anderson&#x27;s well known doubts about making &quot;Clerks II&quot; when first approached by Smith.

On March 29, 2012, Smith expressed his interest in producing &quot;Clerks III&quot; as a Broadway play after seeing the Theresa Rebeck comedy &quot;Seminar&quot; starring Alan Rickman, with whom Smith had previously worked on &quot;Dogma&quot;.

On December 10, 2012, Smith released a special &quot;Hollywood Babble-On&quot; episode, &quot;Hollywood Babble-On #000: GIANT SIZED ANNUAL # 1: CLERKS III, AUDIENCE 0&quot;, in which he revealed greater details on his plans for &quot;Clerks III&quot;. Smith stated that an ongoing audit over residuals from &quot;Clerks II&quot; with The Weinstein Company was causing a delay in several key &quot;Clerks III&quot; cast and crew members, including Anderson and Mosier, from coming on board until the audit was resolved. Smith also revealed that he would like to crowdsource &quot;Clerks III&quot;, either through Kickstarter or Indiegogo, with contributors receiving anything from DVDs, posters and even roles as extras in the film. On June 5, 2013, he changed his mind on crowdsourcing, stating: &quot;I&#x27;ve got access to money. And worst-case scenario, I can put up my house.&quot;

Smith worked on a script for &quot;Clerks III&quot; from March to May 2013, stating when he completed it that it was &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; of the series. In July 2013, Mewes stated that they were now just waiting to hear back from The Weinstein Company about funding.

On September 26, 2014, Smith stated on his &quot;Hollywood Babble-On&quot; podcast, that he was glad that he made &quot;Tusk&quot;, stating: &quot;Everything in my life would suck right now if I hadn&#x27;t made that movie. I&#x27;m back in movies now. I&#x27;ve got three lined up, and this is the fucking grand news. &quot;Tusk&quot; was the absolute bridge to &quot;Clerks III&quot;. Because of &quot;Tusk&quot;, I got my financing for &quot;Clerks III&quot;&quot;. Smith continued: &quot;A year and change ago, I was trying to fucking desperately get &quot;Clerks III&quot; made for the 20th anniversary. And that desperation, I must have reeked of it, because I couldn&#x27;t fucking find money and shit. But it was &quot;Tusk&quot;, it was people going &#x27;Holy fuck! What else do you have?&#x27; And I was like, &quot;Clerks III&quot;, done. So everybody that&#x27;s like, &#x27;He failed, he failed&#x27;, thank you – I failed into &quot;Clerks III&quot;. So, never trust anybody when they tell you how your story goes, man. You know your story. You write your own story.”

There were plans to start shooting &quot;Clerks III&quot; in May 2015, but these were put on hold to film another sequel, &quot;Mallrats 2&quot;. However, by June 2016, the plans for a &quot;Mallrats&quot; sequel had been turned into plans for a &quot;Mallrats&quot; TV series.

In July 2019, Smith announced that he would do a live reading of &quot;Clerks III&quot; at the First Avenue Playhouse in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey. The reading was held on August 3, 2019. That same month, Smith revealed at San Diego Comic-Con that he was writing a new script for &quot;Clerks III&quot; and promised to make the film.

On October 1, 2019, Smith confirmed on Instagram that &quot;Clerks III&quot; was happening and that Jeff Anderson agreed to reprise his role as Randal. &quot;It&#x27;ll be a movie that concludes a saga. It&#x27;ll be a movie about how you&#x27;re never too old to completely change your life. It’ll be a movie about how a decades-spanning friendship finally confronts the future. It&#x27;ll be a movie that brings us back to the beginning—a return to the cradle of civilization in the great state of #newjersey. It’ll be a movie that stars Jeff and @briancohalloran, with me and Jay in supporting roles. And it&#x27;ll be a movie called CLERKS III!&quot; The new script will follow Randal, after surviving a heart attack, and Dante making a movie about their lives at the store, a plot initially conceived as a film adaptation of &quot;&quot; titled &quot;Clerks: Sell Out&quot;.

Principal photography began on August 2, 2021, in Red Bank, New Jersey. Filming wrapped on August 31, 2021.

&quot;Clerks III&quot; had its world premiere on September 4, 2022, at the Count Basie Center for the Arts in Red Bank, New Jersey and was released on September 13, 2022, by Lionsgate and Fathom Events.

== Related projects ==
Following &quot;Clerks&quot;, Smith set several more films in the same &quot;world&quot;, which he calls the View Askewniverse of overlapping characters and stories. Of all of Smith&#x27;s films, however, &quot;Clerks&quot; is the one with the most direct spin-off products.

=== &quot;Clerks: The TV Show&quot; ===
A pilot for a live-action TV series was produced in 1995. It was produced by Touchstone Television and was to be developed by Richard Day. The pilot only referenced the character names and starred none of the cast from the original film, contained no foul language (except words suitable enough for a TV-PG rating) and did not feature Silent Bob. The character of Jay was featured, prompting Smith to point out that he owned the character rights to both Jay and Silent Bob (for the purposes of featuring them in separate films). The producers&#x27; solution was to change the character&#x27;s name to Ray. Smith was unaware of the production of the series until casting was underway. Smith, as well as Mosier and Mewes, had been knee-deep with the production of &quot;Mallrats&quot; at the time and attempted to become involved in the series, but became disheartened quickly as an episode he had written for the series was shot down to be used as a potential B-plot. He would later use the script for an episode of &quot;&quot;.

O&#x27;Halloran and Anderson both auditioned to reprise their roles of Dante and Randal from the film but were replaced by Andrew Lowery and future &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; performer Jim Breuer. After seeing the result, Smith, Mosier, Mewes, O&#x27;Halloran and Anderson all said that it was terrible, with O&#x27;Halloran and Anderson further stating they were both glad they weren&#x27;t involved.

=== &quot;Clerks: The Animated Series&quot; ===

Touchstone Television (with Miramax Films) also produced &quot;Clerks: The Animated Series&quot; a short-lived six-episode animated television series featuring the same characters and cast of the original film. Two episodes aired on ABC in late May/early June 2000 before being pulled from the lineup. The full six episodes were released on DVD in 2001 before being run on Comedy Central in 2004 and Adult Swim from 2008 to 2010. In a trailer for (but not in) &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, Randal, referencing the series, says to Dante: &quot;If you were funnier than that, ABC would&#x27;ve never cancelled us.&quot;

=== &quot;Clerks: The Comics&quot; ===
&quot;Clerks.&quot; is a series of comics written by Smith featuring characters from the film. In the series are &quot;Clerks: The Comic Book&quot;, &quot;Clerks: Holiday Special&quot;, and &quot;Clerks: The Lost Scene&quot;. Smith has discussed plans for &quot;Clerks 1.5&quot;, a comic that would bridge the gap between the original film and its sequel, to be included in a reprint of the &quot;Clerks.&quot; trade paperback. The story ultimately was printed in the 2006 &quot;Tales from the Clerks&quot; collection, which also included the other &quot;Clerks&quot; comics with additional View Askewniverse material. Smith received the Harvey Award for Best New Talent in 1999.

=== &quot;Shooting Clerks&quot; ===

&quot;Shooting Clerks&quot; is a 2021 biographical comedy-drama film about the making of &quot;Clerks&quot;. The film stars many of the original film&#x27;s stars, including O&#x27;Halloran, Ghigliotti, Mewes and Smith himself. The film had a special fine cut screening at San Diego Comic-Con on July 20, 2019, in celebration of the 25th anniversary of the original film&#x27;s release.

<doc id="200698" wikidata="Q507430" url="?curid=200698" title="Apache Tomcat">
<text>Apache Tomcat (called &quot;Tomcat&quot; for short) is a free and open-source implementation of the Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Expression Language, and WebSocket technologies. It provides a &quot;pure Java&quot; HTTP web server environment in which Java code can also run. Thus it is a Java web application server, although not a full JEE application server.

Tomcat is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation, released under the Apache License 2.0 license.

==Components==
Tomcat 4.x was released with Catalina (a servlet container), Coyote (an HTTP connector) and Jasper (a JSP engine).

===Catalina===
Catalina is Tomcat&#x27;s servlet container. Catalina implements Sun Microsystems&#x27; specifications for servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP). In Tomcat, a Realm element represents a &quot;database&quot; of usernames, passwords, and roles (similar to Unix groups) assigned to those users. Different implementations of Realm allow Catalina to be integrated into environments where such authentication information is already being created and maintained, and then use that information to implement Container Managed Security as described in the Servlet Specification.

===Coyote===
Coyote is a Connector component for Tomcat that supports the HTTP 1.1 and 2 protocol as a web server. This allows Catalina, nominally a Java Servlet or JSP container, to also act as a plain web server that serves local files as HTTP documents. Coyote listens for incoming connections to the server on a specific TCP port and forwards the request to the Tomcat Engine to process the request and send back a response to the requesting client. Another Coyote Connector, Coyote JK, listens similarly but instead forwards its requests to another web server, such as Apache, using the JK Protocol. This usually offers better performance.

===Jasper===
Jasper is Tomcat&#x27;s JSP Engine. Jasper parses JSP files to compile them into Java code as servlets (that can be handled by Catalina). At runtime, Jasper detects changes to JSP files and recompiles them.

As of version 5, Tomcat uses Jasper 2, which is an implementation of the Sun Microsystems&#x27; JSP 2.0 specification. From Jasper to Jasper 2, important features were added:
* JSP Tag library pooling – Each tag markup in JSP file is handled by a tag handler class. Tag handler class objects can be pooled and reused in the whole JSP servlet.
* Background JSP compilation – While recompiling modified JSP Java code, the older version is still available for server requests. The older JSP servlet is deleted once the new JSP servlet has finished being recompiled.
* Recompile JSP when included page changes – pages can be inserted and included into a JSP at runtime. The JSP will not only be recompiled with JSP file changes but also with included page changes.
* JDT Java compiler – Jasper 2 can use the Eclipse JDT (Java Development Tools) Java compiler instead of Ant and codice_1.

Three new components were added with the release of Tomcat 7:

===Cluster===
This component has been added to manage large applications. It is used for load balancing that can be achieved through many techniques. Clustering support currently requires the JDK version 1.5 or higher.

===High availability===
A high-availability feature has been added to facilitate the scheduling of system upgrades (e.g. new releases, change requests) without affecting the live environment. This is done by dispatching live traffic requests to a temporary server on a different port while the main server is upgraded on the main port. It is very useful in handling user requests on high-traffic web applications.

==Features==
Tomcat 9.x implements the Servlet 4.0 and JSP 2.3 Specifications.

Tomcat 10.1.x implements the Servlet 6.0 and JSP 3.1 Specifications.

Tomcat 11.x implements the Servlet 6.1 and JSP 4.0 Specifications.

==History==
Tomcat started off as a servlet reference implementation by James Duncan Davidson, a software architect at Sun Microsystems. He later helped make the project open-source and played a key role in its donation by Sun Microsystems to the Apache Software Foundation. The Apache Ant software build automation tool was developed as a side-effect of the creation of Tomcat as an open source project.

Davidson had initially hoped that the project would become open-sourced and, since many open-source projects had O&#x27;Reilly books associated with them featuring an animal on the cover, he wanted to name the project after an animal. He came up with &quot;Tomcat&quot; since he reasoned the animal represented something that could fend for itself. Although the tomcat was already in use for another O&#x27;Reilly title, his wish to see an animal cover eventually came true when O&#x27;Reilly published their Tomcat book with a snow leopard on the cover in 2003.

===Releases===

==Apache TomEE==
Apache TomEE (pronounced &quot;Tommy&quot;) is the Enterprise Edition of Apache Tomcat (Tomcat + Java/Jakarta EE = TomEE) that combines several Java enterprise projects including Apache OpenEJB, Apache OpenWebBeans, Apache OpenJPA, Apache MyFaces and others. In October 2011, the project obtained certification by Oracle Corporation as a compatible implementation of the Java EE 6 Web Profile.

<doc id="200701" wikidata="Q2915294" url="?curid=200701" title="Xenocide">
<text>Xenocide (first published in 1991) is the third book in the Ender&#x27;s Game series, a science fiction series by the American author Orson Scott Card. It was first published during a period of increasing globalization and heightened awareness of cultural differences, and the writing reflects this in its techniques, mood, and emotive effect on the reader. &quot;Xenocide&quot; explores themes of communication, xenophobia, and the potential dangers of advanced technology. 

&quot;Xenocide&quot; was nominated for both the Hugo Award and Locus Awards for Best Novel in 1992. 

==Background==
Card incorporated elements from his earlier publication, &quot;Gloriously Bright&quot;, from the January 1991 issue of &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;, into the novel&quot;.&quot; 

&quot;Xenocide&quot; refers to the &quot;killing or attempted killing of an entire alien species.&quot; 

&#x27;&#x27; comes from the Greek word for &quot;stranger, foreigner, or host;&quot; 

&quot;&#x27;-cide&quot;&#x27; is a word-forming element meaning &quot;killing.&quot; From French &quot;-cide&quot; and Latin &quot;-cidium&quot; meaning &quot;a cutting, a killing.&quot; 

==Plot summary==
In &quot;Xenocide&quot;, the third book in Orson Scott Card&#x27;s &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; series, the planet Lusitania faces annihilation as the Starways Congress sends a fleet armed with the deadly &quot;Molecular Disruption Device&quot; to destroy it. Home to the alien species Pequeninos, the sentient insect Hive Queen, and humans—including Ender Wiggin and his family—the planet&#x27;s inhabitants race to find solutions to their existential threats. Meanwhile, the genetically engineered inhabitants of the planet Path grapple with their religious devotion and mental conditioning as they uncover the secrets of their oppression. As the Lusitanians work to neutralize the Descolada virus—vital to the planet&#x27;s ecosystem but deadly to humans—they also uncover the nature of faster-than-light travel using the mysterious force known as the &quot;Outside.&quot; Through this discovery, they transport the endangered species and themselves to safety, thwarting the Congress&#x27;s fleet and preserving their world.

==Reception==
&quot;Xenocide&quot; received recognition in the science fiction community with nominations for the Hugo Award and the Locus Award for Best Novel in 1992.

The New York Times Book Review offered a mixed assessment of &quot;Xenocide&quot; in 1991. The review recognized the novel&#x27;s ambitious philosophical themes but also criticized its pacing and dialogue, suggesting that the complex ideas could have been more impactful in a more concise format.

<text>Forest Peoples Programme (FPP) advocates an alternative vision of how forests should be managed and controlled, based on respect for the rights of the people who know them best. FPP works with forest peoples in South America, Africa, and Asia, to help them secure their rights, build up their own organisations and negotiate with governments and companies as to how economic development and conservation are the best achieved on their lands.

Forests cover 31% of total land area of the planet. Of that, 12% are designated for the conservation of biological diversity and nearly all are inhabited. Many of the peoples, who live in and have customary rights to their forests, have developed ways of life and traditional knowledge that are attuned to their forest environments. Yet, forest policies commonly treat forests as empty lands controlled by the state and available for ‘development’ – colonisation, logging, plantations, dams, mines, oil wells, gas pipelines and agribusiness. These encroachments often force forest peoples out of their forest homes. Many conservation schemes to establish wilderness reserves also deny forest peoples’ rights.

==History==
Forest Peoples Programme (FPP) was founded in 1990 in response to the forest crisis, specifically to support indigenous forest peoples’ struggles to defend their lands and livelihoods. It registered as a non-governmental human rights Dutch Stichting in 1997, and then later, in 2000, as a UK charity, No. 1082158 and a company limited by guarantee (England &amp; Wales) Reg. No. 3868836, with a registered office in the UK.

FPP&#x27;s focus, in the beginning, came from the expertise and relationships that the small founding team had with specific communities, primarily in the Guyanas and in South and South East Asia. Forest Peoples Programme has grown into a respected and successful organisation that now operates right around the tropical forest belt where it serves to bridge the gap between policy makers and forest peoples. Through advocacy, practical projects and capacity building, FPP supports forest peoples to deal directly with the outside powers, regionally, nationally, and internationally that shape their lives and futures. Forest Peoples Programme has contributed to, and continues supporting, the growing indigenous peoples&#x27; movement whose voice is gaining influence and attention on the world-wide stage.

==Publications==
Forest Peoples Programme produces a wide range of publications, including reports, briefings, training manuals, papers, submissions to human rights bodies, statements, letters, urgent action requests, as well as news articles.

<doc id="200706" wikidata="Q2420722" url="?curid=200706" title="Art Babbitt">
<text>Arthur Harold Babitsky (October 8, 1907 – March 4, 1992), better known as Art Babbitt, was an American animator, best known for his work at Walt Disney Animation Studios. He received over 80 awards as an animation director and animator, and also developed the character of Goofy. Babbitt worked as an animator or animation director on films such as &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot; and &quot;Dumbo&quot;, among others. Outside of Disney, he also animated &quot;The Wise Quacking Duck&quot; for Leon Schlesinger Productions.

==Early life==
Babbitt was born to a Jewish family in the Little Bohemia section of Omaha, Nebraska, but moved to Sioux City, Iowa after he finished kindergarten. After graduating from Sioux City Central High in 1924 at the age of 16, Art decided to move to New York to take on the role of after his hard-working father had an accident on duty and became paralyzed as a result.

== Career ==
Art Babbitt began his career in New York City working for Paul Terry&#x27;s Terrytoons studio. But in the early 1930s he moved to Los Angeles followed by his fellow Terrytoon colleague Bill Tytla, and secured a job animating for the Walt Disney Studio, which was expanding at the time.

=== Disney Studio ===
Babbitt began his career at Disney as an assistant animator, but his talent was spotted and he was soon promoted to animator. His first important work was a drunken mouse in the short &quot;The Country Cousin&quot; (1936), which won an Academy Award for the studio.

At the Disney Studio, Babbitt animated the Wicked Queen in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, a job described by Disney animator Andreas Deja as &quot;one of the toughest assignments&quot; on the film. While he was working on &quot;Snow White&quot;, he met his first wife, Marjorie Belcher, a dance model whose live-action performance was used as reference material by the animators for the role of Snow White.

On the film &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, Babbitt animated the character of Geppetto, and became a directing animator. Of all Disney&#x27;s films, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; was the feature which Babbitt most admired, and which he regarded as the finest achievement of the studio during the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of animation. Babbitt also animated the characters of the Dancing Mushrooms, Dancing Thistles, Dancing Orchids, Zeus, Vulcan, and Boreas in &quot;Fantasia&quot;. On the feature film &quot;Dumbo&quot;, Babbitt was again made a directing animator, and animated the character of the stork. When animating the stork, he made him resemble his voice actor, Sterling Holloway. Babbitt is also credited with developing the character of Goofy, a character which he later described in the 1987 documentary film &quot;Animating Art&quot;:
Goofy was someone who never really knew how stupid he was. He thought long and carefully before he did anything, and then he did it wrong.

He had previously expounded on Goofy’s nature in a 1930s memo:

Think of the Goof as a composite of an everlasting optimist, a gullible Good Samaritan, a half-wit, a shiftless, good-natured colored boy and a hick. His brain is rather vapory.

During the 1930s Babbitt rose to become one of Disney&#x27;s best-paid artists, and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle despite the austerity of the Great Depression:
I was living the Life of Riley. I didn&#x27;t realize how fortunate I was. I was earning a very good salary. I had two servants, a large house, and three cars. You know, what in the world was I going to do with three cars?
However, despite this prosperity, in 1940 he and his wife Marjorie were divorced.

=== Cartoonist strike ===

Despite being one of the highest paid animators at Disney, Babbitt was sympathetic to the cause of lower echelon Disney artists seeking to form a union. Most of the strikers were in-betweeners, cel painters, and other less-well paid employees, who in 1941 began industrial action in pursuit of better working conditions. As a top animator, Babbitt was one of relatively few well-paid artists to join the strike, and he became one of the strike leaders. One morning, as Disney drove through picketing workers on his way to the studio, Babbitt heckled him through a bullhorn. Disney exited his car to confront him, and a fistfight was only prevented by the intervention of others.

For his part in the strike, Babbitt earned Walt Disney&#x27;s enmity. Disney was forced to rehire Babbitt after the strike was over, along with many other strikers, but by then the two men disliked one another. Babbitt worked with director Jack Kinney, another &quot;Goofy man&quot; (meaning that they worked together on the Goofy shorts), as Disney began to look for ways to be rid of Babbitt. &quot;If he gets in your way, let me know&quot;, Disney said to Kinney. Babbitt was fired more than once but was reinstated, taking his case successfully all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States, and winning a handsome settlement.

=== WWII ===
After serving with the U.S. Marines in the Pacific War during World War II, Babbitt returned to Disney for a time, following an &quot;unfair labor practices&quot; suit brought by Babbitt against Disney. Disney was forced to rehire him after the war, but Babbitt did not stay long.

=== Career after Disney ===
Along with some other former Disney strikers, Babbitt left Disney and went to join the United Productions of America (UPA), a new studio which pioneered a modern, simplified form of animation. He worked on many of their famous award-winning shorts, including the lead character Frankie in &quot;Rooty Toot-Toot&quot; (1951), and won many awards. In the 1950s he was part owner of Quartet Films, where he worked on television commercials, including the Cleo winning &quot;John &amp; Marsha&quot; spot for Parkay Margarine. Later he was part of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s commercial wing.

Known in the animation world as one of the art&#x27;s most accomplished teachers, in 1973 Canadian animator Richard Williams brought Babbitt to his London studio in Soho Square to deliver a series of lectures on animation acting and technique that subsequently became famous among animators. Some of Babbitt&#x27;s final work was on the characters King Nod and Phido, the vulture, in Williams&#x27; film &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot;. He also animated the Camel with Wrinkled Knees in William&#x27;s &quot;Raggedy Ann and Andy: A Musical Adventure&quot;.

In 1991, Disney Company chief Roy E. Disney, the nephew of Walt, contacted Babbitt and they ended the long feud. Babbitt&#x27;s former rivals, the pro-Walt animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, gave Babbitt a warm and moving eulogy at his funeral service. He was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

==Family life and legacy==
His first wife (1937–1940) was Marge Champion, a dance model in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. His second wife was Dina Babbitt, an artist and a Holocaust survivor. He had two daughters with Dina, L. Michele Babbitt and Karin Wendy Babbitt. His third wife until his death was actress Barbara Perry. His step-daughter from Barbara is Laurel James. Babbitt died of kidney failure on March 4, 1992. In the late 1980s, a British television documentary titled &quot;Animating Art&quot; was broadcast, celebrating Babbitt&#x27;s life and work. The documentary was produced and directed by Imogen Sutton (Richard Williams&#x27; wife), and features extensive interviews with Babbitt and his then employer, Williams. Babbitt was posthumously named a Disney Legend in 2007.

The Academy Film Archive holds a small collection of personal films belonging to Babbitt. The archive has preserved a number of Babbitt&#x27;s home movies from this collection, including one of the 1938 Academy Awards.

<doc id="200711" wikidata="Q488143" url="?curid=200711" title="Mare Orientale">
<text>Mare Orientale (Latin &quot;orientāle&quot;, the &quot;eastern sea&quot;) is a lunar mare. It is located on the western border of the near side and far side of the Moon, and is difficult to see from an Earthbound perspective. Images from spacecraft have revealed it to be one of the most striking large scale lunar features, resembling a target ring bullseye.

==Geology==
During the 1960s, rectified images of Mare Orientale by Gerard Kuiper at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory gave rise to the notion of it being an impact crater. The structure, with the flat plain of the mare in the center, is about across and was formed by the impact of an asteroid-sized object, possibly in diameter and travelling at . Compared with most other lunar basins, Mare Orientale is less flooded by mare basalts, so that much of the basin structure is visible. The basalt in the central portion of the Orientale basin is probably less than in thickness which is much less than mare basins on the Earth-facing side of the Moon. The collision caused ripples in the lunar crust, resulting in the three concentric circular features. The innermost rings of this vast, multi-ringed crater are the inner and outer Montes Rook, and the outermost ring are the Montes Cordillera, in diameter. Outward from here, ejecta extend some from the foot of the mountains and form a rough surface with hummocks and with features radially aligned towards the center.

The Apollo program did not sample rocks from Mare Orientale so its precise age is not known. However, it is the Moon&#x27;s most recent impact basin, probably younger than the Imbrium Basin, which is about 3.85 billion years old, with an estimated age of around 3.7-3.8 billion years. The surrounding basin material is of the Lower Imbrian epoch with the mare material being of the Upper Imbrian epoch.

Global seismic shaking following the impact that created the basin has been credited with the levelling of almost all slopes steeper than 35° in layers of Imbrian age and older on the Moon.

Located at the antipode of Mare Orientale is Mare Marginis.

A mass concentration (mascon), or gravitational high, was identified in the center of Mare Orientale from Doppler tracking of the five Lunar Orbiter spacecraft in 1968. The mascon was confirmed and mapped at higher resolution with later orbiters such as Lunar Prospector and GRAIL.

==Discovery and name==
Mare Orientale is difficult to observe from Earth, as it lies at the extreme western edge of the near side. All that can be seen are the rough mountain ranges—the Montes Rook and the Montes Cordillera—and some glimpses of the dark mare material beyond them. However, the Moon&#x27;s libration means that on rare occasions Mare Orientale is turned slightly more toward the Earth, and becomes a little more discernible.

Although various astronomers had observed hints of the mare, it was first fully described by the German astronomer Julius Franz in his 1906 book &quot;Der Mond&quot; (&quot;The Moon&quot;). Franz also gave the mare its name, the &quot;Eastern Sea&quot;, as it was located on what the convention at the time considered was the eastern side of the Moon as viewed from Earth, though it is the western side as viewed by an astronaut walking on the Moon. In 1961, however, the International Astronomical Union adopted the astronautic convention for East and West on the Moon and this limb became the western edge.

The first detailed study of the Mare Orientale was by Hugh Percy Wilkins, who called it &quot;Lunar Mare X&quot;. Franz&#x27;s discoveries were not well known, and in the 1976 edition of his book &quot;Guide to the Moon&quot;, Patrick Moore claims that he and Wilkins discovered and named Mare Orientale in 1946. However, Moore credits Franz as discoverer in his &quot;2009 Yearbook of Astronomy&quot; (p. 133–135).

<text>Mare Humorum (Latin &quot;hūmōrum&quot;, the &quot;Sea of Moisture&quot; or &quot;Sea of [[Humorism|Humors]]&quot;) is a lunar mare. The impact basin it is located in is across.

==Geology==
It was not sampled by the Apollo program, so a precise age has not been determined. However, geological mapping indicates that it is intermediate in age between the Imbrium and Nectaris Basins, suggesting an age of about 3.9 billion years. The Humorum basin is filled with a thick layer of mare basalt, believed to exceed 3 kilometers in thickness at the center of the basin.

A mass concentration (mascon), or gravitational high, was identified in the center of Mare Humorum from Doppler tracking of the five Lunar Orbiter spacecraft in 1968. The mascon was confirmed and mapped at higher resolution with later orbiters such as Lunar Prospector and GRAIL.

On the north edge of Mare Humorum is the large crater Gassendi, which was considered as a possible landing site for Apollo 17. To the south are the floor-fractured Vitello crater, the partially flooded Doppelmayer, and the smaller Puiseux. To the east are Hippalus crater and Promontorium Kelvin. To the west are the Rimae Doppelmayer and the Rupes Liebig, which are cliffs near Liebig itself which is just west of the mare.

==Names==
Like most of the other maria on the Moon, Mare Humorum was named by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized. Previously, the 17th century astronomer Pierre Gassendi had named it Anticaspia (&#x27;opposite to the Caspian&#x27;, referring to Mare Crisium, which he had named after the Caspian Sea), and Michael van Langren had labelled it the Mare Venetum (&quot;Venetian Sea&quot;) in his 1645 map. Johannes Hevelius called it Sinus Sirbonis (&quot;Bay of Serbonis&quot;, after the lake of Serbonis, now Lake Bardawil, in Egypt) in his 1647 map.

<text>Ward Walrath Kimball (March 4, 1914 – July 8, 2002) was an American animator employed by Walt Disney Animation Studios. He was part of Walt Disney&#x27;s main team of animators, known collectively as Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men. His films have been honored with two Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film.

Outside of his job as an animator, Kimball was a railroad enthusiast as well as a talented jazz trombonist. He founded and led the seven-piece Dixieland band Firehouse Five Plus Two, in which he played the trombone.

== Early life ==
Kimball was born on March 4, 1914, in Minneapolis. His father was a salesman who traveled widely. He grew up in the Midwest, often residing with his grandparents.

==Career==

While Kimball was a brilliant draftsman, he preferred to work on comical characters rather than realistic human designs. Animating came easily to him and he was constantly looking to do things differently. Because of this, Walt Disney called Ward a genius in the book &quot;The Story of Walt Disney&quot;. While there were many talented animators at Disney, Ward&#x27;s efforts stand out as unique.

According to Jeff Lenburg&#x27;s assessment of him, Kimball was a pioneer animator and a great innovator of his time. He instilled life to diverse Disney characters, such as Mickey Mouse, Jiminy Cricket, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

Kimball attended the Santa Barbara School of the Arts in order to become a painter and illustrator. Kimball&#x27;s instructor at the school suggested to him that his work should be submitted to Walt Disney Productions (later known as the Walt Disney Animation Studios), and that he should pursue a career in animation. In March 1934, a 20-year-old Kimball applied for a job at the Disney studio. In April 1934, he was hired as an inbetweener. He was then promoted to an assistant animator. He served as an assistant to animator Hamilton Luske. Kimball worked primarily in the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; series, where his film credits include the animated short films &quot;The Wise Little Hen&quot; (1934), &quot;The Goddess of Spring&quot; (1934), and &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot; (1935). He also worked on &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; shorts, where his film credits include the short films &quot;Orphan&#x27;s Benefit&quot; (1934) and &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Judgement Day&quot; (1935).

In 1936, Kimball was promoted to an animator in his own right. He continued to work in the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; series. Some of his memorable credits in this position include the animated short films &quot;Toby Tortoise Returns&quot; (1936), &quot;More Kittens&quot; (1936), and &quot;Mother Goose Goes Hollywood&quot; (1938). His first solo effort as an animator was animating a grasshopper turned musician in &quot;Woodland Café&quot; (1937).

As one of Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men, Kimball was tasked with animating on &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937). The film was the first feature-length animated film by the Disney studio. Kimball spent months working on the scene in which the Seven Dwarfs are eating soup, prepared for them by Snow White. This scene, however, was ultimately cut to shorten the length of the film.

Kimball was a strikebreaker in 1941, breaking the Disney animators&#x27; strike. He was considered a &quot;scab&quot; by many of his peers. &quot;I felt terrible,&quot; Kimball wrote in his journal. &quot;Friends on the inside waving to me to come in. Friends on the outside pleading with me to stay out; Jeezus. I was on the spot!&quot;

Following the release of &quot;Snow White&quot;, Kimball was promoted to a supervising or directing animator. He would remain in this position until his retirement in the 1970s. His employer Walt Disney was sufficiently satisfied with Kimball&#x27;s work that he entrusted him with designing the new character Jiminy Cricket in the Disney Studio&#x27;s next feature film, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. It took Kimball 12 or 14 drafts before completing his final design of Jiminy. Kimball told one interviewer that he &quot;hated&quot; animating Jiminy Cricket: &quot;I got sick of drawing that oval head looking in every direction.&quot;) Kimball&#x27;s next major task was designing the sympathetic Crows in &quot;Dumbo&quot; (1941). Following the example of the Seven Dwarfs from &quot;Snow White&quot;, Kimball had to give each crow a distinct appearance and character.

Kimball supervised or directed the animation of several Disney animated feature films. Among them were &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940), &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot; (1941), and &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; (1944). The last film mentioned featured the trio of Donald Duck, José Carioca, and Panchito Pistoles. According to animation historian Jeff Lenburg, &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; is considered to have a place among the finest work of Kimball&#x27;s career. The film was reportedly successful in the American box office, earning about 3 to 4 million dollars.

Kimball directed the character animation and sequences of the Pecos Bill segment in &quot;Melody Time&quot; (1948). He also worked as a senior animator for &quot;The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad&quot; (1949). In &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1950), Kimball was responsible for the characters Jaq and Gus and Lucifer the Cat. In &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1951), Kimball was responsible for Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Walrus and the Carpenter, the Hatter and his mad tea party, and the Cheshire Cat. His other film credits include the feature films &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953), &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), and &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; (1971).

Kimball spent much of his career animating theatrical animated short films. However, he also served as a director for some of them. He and Charles August Nichols co-directed the animated short films &quot;Melody&quot; (1953) and &quot;Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom&quot; (1953). &quot;Melody&quot; was the Disney studio&#x27;s first animated 3D film; &quot;Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom&quot; won the 1954 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film and was the Disney studio&#x27;s first widescreen CinemaScope animated film. Kimball also directed the short films &quot;It&#x27;s Tough to Be a Bird&quot; (1969) and &quot;Dad, Can I Borrow the Car?&quot; (1970). &quot;It&#x27;s Tough to Be a Bird&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.

Kimball served as a screenwriter for the featurette &quot;Eyes In Outer Space&quot; (1959). The film combined live action and animation. It depicted weather satellites and explained how the weather is predicted. The film was originally theatrically released. Around 1962, it started being shown in Disneyland.

During the 1950s, the Disney studio shifted its focus from theatrical animation to television. Kimball wrote and directed three hour-long television shows about space exploration. They were &quot;Man in Space&quot; (1955), &quot;Man and the Moon&quot; (1955), and &quot;Mars and Beyond&quot; (1957). The consultants for these shows included pioneers of the Space Age, such as aerospace engineer Wernher von Braun. According to animation historian Jeff Lenburg, the three shows helped in sparking popular interest in spaceflight. Kimball was also responsible for the science-fiction two-reel cartoon &quot;Cosmic Capers&quot; (1957).

Kimball also worked (as a writer) on the live-action musical &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; (1961). He later returned to television and directed 43 episodes of &quot;The Mouse Factory&quot; (1972–1973).

Kimball retired in 1973 and left the Disney studio. He continued, however, to serve as a consultant on special assignments. He worked on the World of Motion attraction for Disney&#x27;s EPCOT Center.

==Other activities==

Kimball was profiled by producer Jerry Fairbanks in his Paramount Pictures film short series &quot;Unusual Occupations&quot;. This 35mm Magnacolor film short was released theatrically in 1944; it focused on Kimball&#x27;s backyard railroad and full-sized locomotive.

Kimball was also a jazz trombonist. He founded and led the seven-piece Dixieland band Firehouse Five Plus Two, in which he played trombone. The band made at least 13 LP records and toured clubs, college campuses and jazz festivals from the 1940s to early 1970s. Kimball once said that Walt Disney permitted the second career as long as it did not interfere with his animation work. Kimball appeared on the March 17, 1954, episode of &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, in which Groucho Marx coaxed him into playing his trombone with the house band. He and his partner won $75 in their quiz portion of the show, including one Disney animation question that Kimball answered easily: the answer was &quot;Pinocchio&quot;.

Kimball continued to work at Disney until 1974, working on the Disney anthology television series, being one of the writers for &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot;, creating animation for &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, directing the animation for &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot;, and working on titles for feature films such as &quot;The Adventures Of Bullwhip Griffin&quot; and &quot;Million Dollar Duck&quot;. His last staff work for Disney was producing and directing the Disney TV show &quot;The Mouse Factory&quot;, which ran from 1972 to 1974. He continued to do various projects on his own, even returning to do some publicity tours for the Disney corporation. He also worked on the World of Motion attraction for Disney&#x27;s EPCOT Center.

Kimball also produced two editions of a volume titled &quot;Art Afterpieces,&quot; in which he revised various well-known works of art, such as putting &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;&#x27;s hair up in curlers, showing &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot; watching TV, and adding a Communist flag and Russian boots to &quot;Pinkie&quot;. These masterpiece remixes are thought to have been appropriated by the street artist Banksy.

His three acting appearances on film were an uncredited role as a jazz musician (with his Firehouse Five Plus Two) in &quot;Hit Parade of 1951,&quot; an IRS Chief in Mike Jittlov&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard of Speed and Time&quot;, and voicing and giving his likeness to half of the vaudeville duo &quot;Ward and Fred&quot; in the Mickey Mouse short &quot;The Nifty Nineties&quot; (with fellow Disney animator Fred Moore). Kimball served as host of the &quot;Man in Space&quot; and &quot;Man and the Moon&quot; episodes of &quot;Disneyland&quot; in 1955 and 1956 respectively. He hosted the second season of the 1992 PBS series &quot;Tracks Ahead&quot;. That season has since been repackaged to feature current host Spencer Christian.

As recounted in Neal Gabler&#x27;s biography of Walt Disney, Ward Kimball was a key figure in spreading the urban legend that Disney had left instructions for his body to be preserved by cryonics after his death.

Amid Amidi wrote a biography of Kimball, &quot;Full Steam Ahead: The Life and Art of Ward Kimball&quot; that was projected for publication in the fall of 2012. However, publication of the biography was canceled in February 2013, which Amidi believed was due to pressure from the Disney corporation.

==Filmography==
Note: At the time these films were produced it was common for one animator to animate every single character in the shot.

==Railfan==

Along with his employer and friend Walt Disney, and friend Ollie Johnston, Kimball collected old railroad ephemera. He was also an avid collector of model trains. Kimball was an avid railway enthusiast from a young age, having grown up in Parsons, Kansas, near the massive Katy Railroad facilities. One of his first childhood drawings was of a locomotive, and he said that his mother called him a &quot;marked&quot; baby because of his early infatuation with railroads. 

Kimball donated his narrow-gauge collection to the Southern California Railway Museum (formerly the Orange Empire Railway Museum) in Perris, California. A full-size steam locomotive, which Kimball ran on his private backyard railroad known as &quot;Grizzly Flats Railroad&quot; in San Gabriel, California, bears some of his original artwork on the headlamp and cab, and is on permanent display at the museum. Kimball&#x27;s roundhouse also included two small steam engines that had been used on sugar cane plantations, one of which was his and the other was owned by his friend, noted railroad historian Gerald M. Best. In recognition of his love of railroading and support of the Southern California Railway Museum, the Perris Transit Center, where the museum&#x27;s historic trains travel, is dedicated to Mr. Kimball. In a rare deviation from its usually tight copyright policy, the Disney corporation allowed the city to decorate the transit center with Kimball&#x27;s artwork. The center is currently served by Riverside Transit Agency buses, with train service as part of the Metrolink 91/Perris Valley Line.

Kimball is credited with helping Walt Disney for the inspiration to install the Disneyland Railroad at Disneyland. The inspiration for the Disneyland Railroad also partly came from Disney&#x27;s personal gauge, live steam backyard Carolwood Pacific Railroad, which Kimball had partially constructed. Kimball&#x27;s Grizzly Flats train station served as the model for the Disneyland Frontierland Train Station. As a tribute to Kimball, Engine No. 5 of the Disneyland Railroad is named the &quot;Ward Kimball&quot;.

In addition, Kimball also designed the logo for the Wildcat Railroad in Los Gatos, California, owned by Billy Jones, a friend of Walt Disney who was an engineer for the Disneyland Railroad during its first week of operation.

Kimball&#x27;s talents are also evident in the reproduction steam locomotives built for the National Park Service at the Golden Spike National Historic Site at Promontory, Utah. Kimball helped match colors with an engine at the Smithsonian Institution and painted the artwork for the replicas of the Union Pacific No. 119 and Central Pacific &quot;Jupiter&quot; built by O&#x27;Connor Engineering Laboratories for the Park Service. Kimball was also in the 1975 video &quot;Model Railroading Unlimited&quot; as the host in the beginning of the movie and was showing parts of his GFRR. Kimball was featured in the 1987 &quot;Great Toy Train Layouts of America&quot; book and in the first installment of the &quot;Great Toy Train Layouts of America&quot; video series in 1988, produced by TM Books and Video.

==&quot;Escalation&quot;==
In 1968, Kimball directed a two-minute animated short called &quot;Escalation&quot;, which criticized Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Vietnam War policy. The short is unique for being the only animated cartoon made independently from the Disney Studios by one of Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men. The short is further noticeable for its satirical edge and political and erotic content.

==Death==
Kimball died in 2002 in Arcadia, California of complications from pneumonia at age 88. In 2005, the Disneyland Railroad named its newly acquired locomotive No. 5 &quot;Ward Kimball&quot; in his memory.

==Archive==
The Academy Film Archive houses the Kimball Family Collection which includes over 60 home movie reels, as well as short films, TV spots, and jazz band performances, serving to document Ward&#x27;s personal interests and moments in his extraordinary career. The collection also includes home movies and shorts by his son, filmmaker and animator John Kimball. The archive has preserved several of the Kimball family home movies, including family vacations to Death Valley and Disneyland.

<doc id="200716" wikidata="Q809690" url="?curid=200716" title="Barycenter (astronomy)">
<text>In astronomy, the barycenter (or barycentre; ) is the center of mass of two or more bodies that orbit one another and is the point about which the bodies orbit. A barycenter is a dynamical point, not a physical object. It is an important concept in fields such as astronomy and astrophysics. The distance from a body&#x27;s center of mass to the barycenter can be calculated as a two-body problem.

If one of the two orbiting bodies is much more massive than the other and the bodies are relatively close to one another, the barycenter will typically be located within the more massive object. In this case, rather than the two bodies appearing to orbit a point between them, the less massive body will appear to orbit about the more massive body, while the more massive body might be observed to wobble slightly. This is the case for the Earth–Moon system, whose barycenter is located on average from Earth&#x27;s center, which is 74% of Earth&#x27;s radius of . When the two bodies are of similar masses, the barycenter will generally be located between them and both bodies will orbit around it. This is the case for Pluto and Charon, one of Pluto&#x27;s natural satellites, as well as for many binary asteroids and binary stars. When the less massive object is far away, the barycenter can be located outside the more massive object. This is the case for Jupiter and the Sun; despite the Sun being a thousandfold more massive than Jupiter, their barycenter is slightly outside the Sun due to the relatively large distance between them.

In astronomy, barycentric coordinates are non-rotating coordinates with the origin at the barycenter of two or more bodies. The International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) is a barycentric coordinate system centered on the Solar System&#x27;s barycenter.
== Two-body problem ==
The barycenter is one of the foci of the elliptical orbit of each body. This is an important concept in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics. In a simple two-body case, the distance from the center of the primary to the barycenter, &quot;r&quot;1, is given by:

:formula_1

where :
*&quot;r&quot;1 is the distance from body 1&#x27;s center to the barycenter
*&quot;a&quot; is the distance between the centers of the two bodies
*&quot;m&quot;1 and &quot;m&quot;2 are the masses of the two bodies.

The semi-major axis of the secondary&#x27;s orbit, &quot;r&quot;2, is given by .

When the barycenter is located &quot;within&quot; the more massive body, that body will appear to &quot;wobble&quot; rather than to follow a discernible orbit.

=== Primary–secondary examples ===

The following table sets out some examples from the Solar System. Figures are given rounded to three significant figures. The terms &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; are used to distinguish between involved participants, with the larger being the primary and the smaller being the secondary.



=== Example with the Sun ===
If —which is true for the Sun and any planet—then the ratio approximates to:

:formula_2

Hence, the barycenter of the Sun–planet system will lie outside the Sun only if:

:formula_3

—that is, where the planet is massive &quot;and&quot; far from the Sun.

If Jupiter had Mercury&#x27;s orbit (), the Sun–Jupiter barycenter would be approximately 55,000 km from the center of the Sun (). But even if the Earth had Eris&#x27;s orbit (), the Sun–Earth barycenter would still be within the Sun (just over 30,000 km from the center).

To calculate the actual motion of the Sun, only the motions of the four giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) need to be considered. The contributions of all other planets, dwarf planets, etc. are negligible. If the four giant planets were on a straight line on the same side of the Sun, the combined center of mass would lie at about 1.17 solar radii, or just over 810,000 km, above the Sun&#x27;s surface.

The calculations above are based on the mean distance between the bodies and yield the mean value &quot;r&quot;1. But all celestial orbits are elliptical, and the distance between the bodies varies between the apses, depending on the eccentricity, &quot;e&quot;. Hence, the position of the barycenter varies too, and it is possible in some systems for the barycenter to be &quot;sometimes inside and sometimes outside&quot; the more massive body. This occurs where:

:formula_4

The Sun–Jupiter system, with &quot;e&quot;Jupiter = 0.0484, just fails to qualify: .

== Relativistic corrections ==

In classical mechanics (Newtonian gravitation), this definition simplifies calculations and introduces no known problems. In general relativity (Einsteinian gravitation), complications arise because, while it is possible, within reasonable approximations, to define the barycenter, we find that the associated coordinate system does not fully reflect the inequality of clock rates at different locations. Brumberg explains how to set up barycentric coordinates in general relativity.

The coordinate systems involve a world-time, i.e. a global time coordinate that could be set up by telemetry. Individual clocks of similar construction will not agree with this standard, because they are subject to differing gravitational potentials or move at various velocities, so the world-time must be synchronized with some ideal clock that is assumed to be very far from the whole self-gravitating system. This time standard is called Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB).

== Selected barycentric orbital elements ==

Barycentric osculating orbital elements for some objects in the Solar System are as follows:

For objects at such high eccentricity, barycentric coordinates are more stable than heliocentric coordinates for a given epoch because the barycentric osculating orbit is not as greatly affected by where Jupiter is on its 11.8 year orbit.

<text>KREEP, an acronym built from the letters K (the atomic symbol for potassium), REE (rare-earth elements) and P (for phosphorus), is a geochemical component of some lunar impact breccia and basaltic rocks. Its most significant feature is somewhat enhanced concentration of a majority of so-called &quot;incompatible&quot; elements (those that are concentrated in the liquid phase during magma crystallization) and the heat-producing elements, namely radioactive uranium, thorium, and potassium (due to presence of the radioactive 40K).

==Typical composition==
The typical composition of KREEP includes about one percent, by mass, of potassium and phosphorus oxides, 20 to 25 parts per million of rubidium, and a concentration of the element lanthanum that is 300 to 350 times the concentrations found in carbonaceous chondrites. Most of potassium, phosphorus and rare-earth elements in KREEP basalts are incorporated in the grains of the phosphate minerals apatite and merrillite.

==Possible origin==
Indirectly, it has been deduced that the origin of KREEP is contained in the origin of the Moon. This is now commonly thought to be the result of a rocky object the size of Mars that struck the Earth about 4.5 billion (4.5×109) years ago. This collision threw a large amount of broken rock into orbit around the Earth. This ultimately gathered together to form the Moon.

Given the high energy such a collision would involve, it has been deduced that a large portion of the Moon would have been liquified, and this 
formed a lunar magma ocean. As the crystallization of this liquid rock proceeded, minerals such as olivine and pyroxene precipitated and sank to the bottom to form the lunar mantle.

After the solidification was about 75% complete, the material anorthositic plagioclase began to crystallize, and because of its low density, it floated, forming a solid crust. Hence, elements that are usually incompatible (i.e., those that usually partition in the liquid phase) would have been progressively concentrated into the magma. Thus a KREEP-rich magma was formed that was sandwiched at first between the crust and mantle. The evidence for these processes comes from the highly anorthositic composition of the crust of the lunar highlands, as well as the presence of the rocks rich in KREEP.

==Lunar Prospector measurements==
Before the mission of Lunar Prospector lunar satellite, it was commonly thought that these KREEP materials had been formed in a widespread layer beneath the crust. However, the measurements from the gamma-ray spectrometer on-board this satellite showed that the KREEP-containing rocks are primarily concentrated underneath the Oceanus Procellarum and the Mare Imbrium. This is a unique lunar geological province that is now known as the Procellarum KREEP Terrane.

Basins far from this province that dug deeply into the crust (and possibly the mantle), such as the Mare Crisium, the Mare Orientale, and the South Pole–Aitken basin, show only little or no enhancements of KREEP within their rims or ejecta. The enhancement of heat-producing radioactive elements within the crust (and/or the mantle) of the Procellarum KREEP Terrane is almost certainly responsible for the longevity and intensity of mare volcanism on the nearside of the Moon.

==Possible use in lunar colonization==
KREEP might be of interest in lunar mining if a lunar base were to be established. Potassium and phosphorus are important for plant growth (NPK fertilizer is used on earth) whereas uranium and thorium are potential fuels for nuclear power. However, the relatively low concentrations of the desired materials compared to earthbound ores may make extraction difficult.
