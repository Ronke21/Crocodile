<text>Cumberland ( ) is an area of North West England which was historically a county. The county was bordered by Northumberland to the north-east, County Durham to the east, Westmorland to the south-east, Lancashire to the south, and the Scottish counties of Dumfriesshire and Roxburghshire to the north. The area includes the city of Carlisle, part of the Lake District and North Pennines, and the Solway Firth coastline. 

Cumberland had an administrative function from the 12th century until 1974, when it was subsumed into Cumbria with Westmorland as well as parts of Yorkshire and Lancashire. It gives its name to the unitary authority area of Cumberland, which has similar boundaries but excludes Penrith.

==Early history ==
In the Early Middle Ages, Cumbria was part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde in the Hen Ogledd, or &quot;Old North&quot;, and its people spoke a Brittonic language now called Cumbric. The first record of the term &#x27;Cumberland&#x27; appears in AD 945, when the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; recorded that the area was ceded to Malcolm I, king of Alba (Scotland), by King Edmund I of England. As with , the native Welsh name for Wales, the names &#x27;Cumberland&#x27; and &#x27;Cumbria&#x27; are derived from &quot;kombroges&quot; in Common Brittonic, which originally meant &quot;compatriots&quot;.

At the time of the Domesday Book (AD 1086) most of the future county was part of Scotland, although some villages around Millom, which were the possessions of the Earl of Northumbria, had been incorporated into Yorkshire.

In AD 1092, King William Rufus of England invaded the Carlisle district, settling it with colonists. He created an Earldom of Carlisle, and granted the territory to Ranulf le Meschin. In 1133, Carlisle was made the see of a new diocese, largely identical with the area of the earldom. However, on the death of King Henry I of England in 1135, the area was regained by King David I of Scotland. He was able to consolidate his power and made Carlisle one of his chief seats of government, while England descended into a lengthy civil war. The Cumbric language is believed to have become extinct in the 12th century. 
The area returned to the English crown in 1157, when Henry II of England took possession of the area (from Malcolm IV of Scotland). Henry II formed two new counties from the former earldom: Westmorland and Carliol – originally an abbreviation of the Latin &#x27;[bishop] of Carlisle&#x27;. Westmorland also included areas formerly part of the Earldom of Lancaster. The lead- and silver-mining area of Alston, previously associated with the Liberty of Tynedale was later also added to the new county of Carliol for financial reasons. By 1177, Carliol had become known as Cumberland. The border between England and Scotland was made permanent by the Treaty of York in 1237.

==Geography==
The boundaries formed in the 12th century were not changed substantially over the county&#x27;s existence. There are four English historic counties and two Scottish counties that it borders: Northumberland and County Durham to the east; Westmorland to the south, the Furness part of Lancashire to the southwest; Dumfriesshire to the north and Roxburghshire to the northeast.

To the west the county is bounded by the Solway Firth and the Irish Sea. The northern boundary is formed by the Solway Estuary and the border with Scotland running east to Scotch Knowe at Kershope Burn. The boundary runs south from Scotch Knowe along the Cheviot Hills, then followed a tributary of the River Irthing and crossed Denton Fell to the River Tees. From Tees Head the boundary crosses the Pennines to descend Crowdundale Beck, from where it followed the rivers Eden and Eamont to the centre of Ullswater. The line follows Glencoin Beck to the top of Helvellyn ridge at Wrynose Pass and along the River Duddon (near Millom) to the sea .

The highest point of the county is Scafell Pike, at , the highest mountain in England. Carlisle is the county town.

===Sub-divisions===

The Earldom of Carlisle was partitioned into baronies. When the County of Cumberland was created, the baronies were subdivided as wards, a county sub-division also used in Durham, Northumberland and Westmorland. These originated as military subdivisions used to organise the male inhabitants for the county&#x27;s defence from Scottish troop incursions. 

Each ward was composed of a number of parishes, areas originally formed for ecclesiastical administration. In common with other northern England counties, many ancient parishes in Cumberland were very large, often consisting of a number of distinct townships and hamlets. Many of these ancient parishes eventually became civil parishes and form the lowest level of local government.

====Cumberland Ward====
Cumberland Ward included Carlisle and Wigton as well as parts of Inglewood Forest. The parish of Stanwix just to the north of Carlisle was partly in both Eskdale and Cumberland wards.

* Parts or all of these parishes and townships constituted the City of Carlisle, and were largely outside the jurisdiction of Cumberland Ward.

==Local government from the 19th century==
During the 19th century a series of reforms reshaped the local government of the county, creating a system of districts with directly elected councils.

===Poor law and municipal reform===

The first changes concerned the administration of the poor law, which was carried at parish level. The Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 provided for the grouping of parishes into poor law unions, each with a central workhouse and an elected board of guardians. Cumberland was divided into nine unions: Alston with Garrigill, Bootle, Brampton, Carlisle, Cockermouth, Longtown, Penrith, Whitehaven and Wigton.

In the following year the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 was passed, reforming boroughs and cities in England and Wales as municipal boroughs with a uniform constitution. The corporation of the City of Carlisle was accordingly remodelled with a popularly elected council consisting of a mayor, aldermen and councillors.

===Local boards and sanitary districts===

Outside of municipal boroughs, there was no effective local government until the 1840s. In response to poor sanitary conditions and outbreaks of cholera, the Public Health Act 1848 (11 &amp; 12 Vict. c. 63) and the Local Government Act 1858 allowed for the formation of local boards of health in populous areas. Local boards were responsible &quot;inter alia&quot; for water supply, drainage, sewerage, paving and cleansing. Eleven local boards were initially formed at Brampton, Cleator Moor, Cockermouth, Egremont, Holme Cultram, Keswick, Maryport, Millom, Penrith, Whitehaven, Wigton and Workington.

Further reform under the Public Health Act 1875 (38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 55) saw the creation of sanitary districts throughout England and Wales. The existing municipal boroughs and local boards became &quot;urban sanitary districts&quot;, while &quot;rural sanitary districts&quot; were formed from the remaining areas of the poor law unions.

Three more local boards were formed: Arlecdon and Frizington in 1882, Harrington in 1891 and Aspatria in 1892. In addition Workington and Whitehaven received charters of incorporation to become municipal boroughs in 1883 and 1894 respectively.

===Local government acts of 1888 and 1894===

In 1889, under the Local Government Act 1888, the Cumberland County Council was created as the county council for Cumberland, taking over administrative functions from the Court of Quarter Sessions. The Local Government Act 1894 reconstituted the existing sanitary districts as urban districts and rural districts, each with an elected council.

The Act of 1888 also allowed any municipal borough with a population of 50,000 people or more to become a &quot;county borough&quot;, independent of county council control. In 1914, Carlisle successfully applied for this status, ceasing to form part of the administrative county, although remaining within Cumberland for the purposes such as Lieutenancy and shrievalty.

===Reform in 1934===

The Local Government Act 1929 imposed the duty on county councils of reviewing the districts within their administrative county so as to form more efficient units of local government. In general, this meant the merging of small or lightly populated areas into larger units. A review was carried in Cumberland in 1934. The following table lists the urban and rural districts before and after the changes.

The distribution of population in 1971 was as follows:1971 Census; Small Area Statistics

In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the administrative county and county borough were abolished and their former area was combined with Westmorland and parts of Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire to form the new county of Cumbria. The area from Cumberland went on to form the districts of Carlisle, Allerdale, Copeland and part of Eden.

==Legacy==
The name continues in use as a geographical and cultural term, and it survives in Cumberland sausages; HMS &quot;Cumberland&quot;; the Cumberland Fell Runners Club; the Cumberland Athletics Club; and various organisations and companies, such as the local newspapers &quot;The Cumberland News&quot;, and &quot;The West Cumberland Times and Star&quot;, and the Cumberland Building Society. It is also mentioned in &quot;Macbeth&quot; as the kingdom given to Prince Malcolm, and is also the initial setting for the Geoffrey Trease historical novel Cue for Treason.

In June 1994, during the 1990s UK local government reform, the Local Government Commission published draft recommendations, suggesting as one option a North Cumbria unitary authority (also including Appleby, the historic county town of Westmorland). It also suggested that Cumberland could be reinstated as an independent ceremonial county. The final recommendations, published in October 1994, did not include such recommendations, apparently due to lack of expression of support for the proposal to the commission.

The Grass-of-Parnassus was the county flower. It had been associated with the county since 1951, when it was included in the coat of arms granted to the Cumberland County Council. It subsequently featured in the arms granted to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council, in both cases to represent Cumberland. The flower was also attributed to Cumbria in 2002 as part of a national County flowers of the United Kingdom campaign by the charity Plantlife. 
In 2012, a flag based on the arms of the former Cumberland County Council was registered as the flag of Cumberland with the Flag Institute. 

In 2013, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, formally recognised and acknowledged the continued existence of England&#x27;s 39 historic counties, including Cumberland.

In 2021, it was announced that on 1 April 2023 local government in Cumbria would be reorganised into two unitary authorities, one of which is Cumberland and includes most of the historic county, with the exception of Penrith and the surrounding area. The new authority covers 77% of the area and 90% of the population of the historic county.

<text>Djadochtatherium is a mammal genus that lived in Mongolia during the Upper Cretaceous. It coexisted with some of the late dinosaurs. This animal was a member of the extinct order of Multituberculata. It is within the suborder of Cimolodonta, and a member of the family Djadochtatheriidae. It was named by G. G. Simpson in 1925, the name meaning &quot;Djadokhta beast&quot;.

The species &quot;Djadochtatherium matthewi&quot; was also named by G. G. Simpson in 1925 and has also been known as &quot;Catopsalis matthewi&quot; (Simpson, 1925). It has been found in the Campanian (Upper Cretaceous)-age Djadokhta and Goyot Formations of Mongolia. This was a relatively large Multituberculate, with a skull length of about 4.5 cm. It was originally diagnosed as a species within the North American genus of &quot;Catopsalis&quot;.

<text>Michel Guillaume Jean de Crèvecœur (; December 31, 1735 – November 12, 1813), naturalized in New York as John Hector St. John, was a French-American author, diplomat, and farmer. 

==Biography==
Crèvecœur was born on December 31, 1735, in Caen, Normandy, France, to the Comte and Comtesse de Crèvecœur (Count and Countess of Crèvecœur). In 1755 he migrated to New France, in North America. There, he served in the French and Indian War in the Canadian Militia and rose to the rank of lieutenant. After the French defeat at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham of in 1759, he moved to the Province of New York, where he acquired British citizenship and adopted the anglicized name of John Hector St. John; in 1770 he married an American woman, Mehitable Tippet, the daughter of a New York merchant. He bought a sizable farm in the Greycourt area of Chester, New York, a small town in Orange County. He named his farm &quot;Pine Hill&quot; and prospered as a farmer. He also traveled about, working as a surveyor. He started writing about life in the American colonies and the emergence of an American society.

In 1779, during the American Revolutionary War, Crèvecœur tried to leave the country to return to France because of the faltering health of his father. Accompanied by his son, he entered British-occupied New York City, where he was imprisoned as a suspected American spy for three months. Eventually, he was released and sailed for England, but was shipwrecked off the coast of Ireland. From England, he sailed to France, where he was briefly reunited with his father. After spending some time recovering at the family estate, he visited Paris and the salon of Sophie d&#x27;Houdetot.

===Author===
In 1782 in London, he published a volume of narrative essays entitled &quot;Letters from an American Farmer&quot;. The book quickly became the first literary success by an American author in Europe and turned Crèvecœur into a celebrated figure. He was the first writer to describe to Europeans the life on the American frontier and to explore the concept of the American Dream. He used many American English term portraying American society as characterized by the principles of equal opportunity and self-determination. His work provided useful information and understanding of the &quot;New World&quot; that helped create an American identity in the minds of Europeans by describing an entire country, rather than another regional colony. His writing celebrated American ingenuity and the uncomplicated lifestyle. It described the acceptance of religious diversity in a society being created from a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. He applied the Latin maxim &quot;Ubi panis ibi patria&quot; (Where there is bread, there is my country) to early American settlers. He once praised the middle colonies for &quot;fair cities, substantial villages, extensive fields... decent houses, good roads, orchards, meadows, and bridges, where an hundred years ago all was wild, woody, and uncultivated.&quot;

The original edition, published near the end of the American Revolutionary War, was rather selective in the letters that were included, omitting those that were negative or critical. Norman A. Plotkin argues that &quot;it was intended to serve the English Whig cause by fostering an atmosphere conducive to reconciliation.&quot; The book excluded all but one of the letters that were written after the beginning of the war, as well as earlier ones that were more critical. Crèvecœur himself sympathized with the Whig cause. His wife&#x27;s family remained loyal to the Crown and later fled to Nova Scotia. With regard to French politics, Crèvecœur was a liberal and a follower of the &quot;philosophes&quot; and dedicated his book to Abbé Raynal, who he said &quot;viewed these provinces of North America in their true light, as the asylum of freedom; as the cradle of future nations, and the refuge of distressed Europeans.&quot; Plotkin notes that &quot;extremists in the American colonies who violated this principle, incurred Crèvecœur&#x27;s harshest criticism, although the severest of these criticisms were considered unsuitable for publication at the time.&quot;

In 1883, his great-grandson, Robert de Crèvecœur, published a biography for which he used previously unpublished letters and manuscripts passed down by the family. Although it received little notice in France, its existence came to the attention of W. P. Trent of Columbia University, who in 1904 published a reprint of &quot;Letters of an American Farmer&quot;. In 1916, Crèvecœur&#x27;s first American biographer, Julia Post Mitchell, who had access to all the manuscripts, made a more balanced assessment and wrote that Crèvecœur addressed &quot;problems in political economy which European governments were trying in vain to solve.&quot; He was &quot;illustrating his theories from American conditions&quot; and was not just &quot;a garruluous apologist of American life.&quot; The additional manuscripts were published in 1925.

===Diplomat===

The success of his book in France had led to his being taken up by an influential circle, and he was appointed the French consul for New York, including the areas of New Jersey and Connecticut. Crèvecœur returned to New York City as the newly appointed French consul in November 1783. Anxious to be reunited with his family, he learned that his farm had been destroyed in an Indian raid, his wife was dead, and his two younger children missing. He stayed in the house of his friend William Seton, who, as the last royal public notary for the City and Province of New York, had helped to secure his release in 1780 from the prison he was kept in. Principal of the import-export mercantile firm the William Seton Company, Seton helped Crèvecœur locate his children, who were safe and living with a family in Boston. The following spring, Crèvecœur reunited with his children. For most of the 1780s, he lived in New York City.

====St. Peter&#x27;s, New York====
At that time, New York City was the national capital, and most of the resident Catholics were connected to the diplomatic corps. Initially, they met for services at the home of the Spanish consul. Their numbers increased with seafaring people, merchants, emigrants from the Spanish West Indies, and a few Acadians. They then rented space at Vauxhall Gardens, a garden and entertainment venue located along the North River on Greenwich Street between Warren and Chambers Streets. In 1785, Portuguese Consul Jose Roiz Silva, Spanish Consul Tomas Stoughton and others sought to rent the vacant Exchange Building and deemed Crèvecœur the best one to make the approach.

Although Crèvecœur was relatively indifferent to religion, he was sympathetic to the idea of liberty of conscience and a friend of Lafayette. When the proposal was rejected, Crèvecœur was insulted and became very active in working for the establishment of the first Catholic church in the city. He later served as president of the first Board of Trustees of St. Peter&#x27;s Church, on Barclay Street.

===Later life===
In 1784, he published a two-volume version of his &quot;Letters from an American Farmer&quot;, enlarged and completely rewritten in French. A three-volume version followed in 1787. Both his English and his French books were translated into several other European languages and widely disseminated throughout Europe. For many years, Crèvecœur was identified by European readers with his fictional narrator, James, the &quot;American farmer,&quot; and held in high esteem by readers and fellow writers across Europe.

When he published another three-volume work in 1801, &quot;Voyage dans la Haute-Pensylvanie et dans l&#x27;état de New-York&quot;, however, his fame had faded and the damages of the French Revolution and its aftermath had made people less interested in the United States. His book was ignored. An abbreviated German translation appeared the following year. An English translation was not published until 1964. Much of Crèvecœur&#x27;s best work has been published posthumously, most recently as &quot;More Letters from the American Farmer: An edition of the Essays in English Left Unpublished by Crèvecœur&quot;, edited by Dennis D. Moore (Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 1995).

Particularly concerned about the condition of slaves, he joined the &quot;Société des Amis des Noirs&quot; (Society of the Friends of the Blacks), founded in Paris.

Crèvecœur was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1789.

In 1789, during a stay in France, he was trapped by the political upheaval that was quickly turning into the French Revolution. At risk as an aristocrat, he went into hiding and secretly tried to gain passage to the United States. The necessary papers were finally delivered to him by the new American ambassador to France, James Monroe. At the end of his life. Crèvecœur returned to France and settled permanently on land that he inherited from his father. On November 12, 1813, he died in Sarcelles, Île-de-France, France.

The town of St. Johnsbury, Vermont, is named after him, as suggested by Ethan Allen.

<text>Karl Konrad Friedrich Wilhelm Lachmann (; 4 March 1793 – 13 March 1851) was a German philologist and critic. He is particularly noted for his foundational contributions to the field of textual criticism.

==Biography==

Lachmann was born in Brunswick, in present-day Lower Saxony. He studied at Leipzig and Göttingen, devoting himself mainly to philological studies. In Göttingen, he founded a critical and philological society in 1811, in conjunction with Dissen, Schulze, and Bunsen. In 1815, he joined the Prussian army as a volunteer &quot;chasseur&quot; and accompanied his detachment to Paris, but did not see active service. In 1816, he became an assistant master in the Friedrichswerder gymnasium at Berlin, and a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at the university. The same summer he became one of the principal masters in the Friedrichs-Gymnasium of Königsberg, where he assisted his colleague, the Germanist Friedrich Karl Köpke, with his edition of Rudolf von Ems&#x27; &quot;Barlaam und Josaphat&quot; (1818), and also assisted his friend in a contemplated edition of the works of Walther von der Vogelweide.

In January 1818, he became professor extraordinarius of classical philology in the University of Königsberg, and at the same time began to lecture on Old German grammar and the Middle High German poets. He devoted himself during the following seven years to an extraordinarily detailed study of those subjects, and in 1824, obtained a leave of absence in order to search the libraries of middle and south Germany for further materials.

In 1825, Lachmann was nominated extraordinary professor of classical and German philology at the Humboldt University, Berlin (ordinary professor 1827); in 1830, he was admitted a member of the Academy of Sciences. He died in Berlin.

==Importance in scholarship==

Lachmann is a figure of considerable importance in the history of German philology.

Early in his career, Lachmann translated the first volume of P.E. Müller&#x27;s &quot;Sagabibliothek des skandinavischen Altertums&quot; (1816). In his &quot;&quot;Habilitationsschrift&quot; über die ursprungliche Gestalt des Gedichts von der Nibelungen Noth&quot; (1816), and in his review of Hagen&#x27;s &quot;Nibelungen&quot; and Benecke&#x27;s &quot;Bonerius&quot;, contributed in 1817 to the &quot;Jenaische Literaturzeitung&quot;, he had already laid down the rules of textual criticism and elucidated the phonetic and metrical principles of Middle High German in a manner which marked a distinct advance in that branch of investigation.

The rigidly scientific character of his method becomes increasingly apparent in the &quot;Auswahl aus den hochdeutschen Dichtern des dreizehnten Jahrhunderts&quot; (1820); in the edition of Hartmann&#x27;s &quot;Iwein&quot; (1827); in those of Walther von der Vogelweide (1827) and Wolfram von Eschenbach (1833); in the papers &quot;&quot;Über das Hildebrandslied&quot;,&quot; &quot;&quot;Über althochdeutsche Betonung und Verskunst&quot;,&quot; &quot;&quot;Über den Eingang des Parzivals&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Über drei Bruchstücke niederrheinischer Gedichte&quot; published in the &quot;Abhandlungen&quot; of the Berlin Academy; and in &quot;Der Nibelunge Not und die Klage&quot; (1826), which was followed by a critical commentary in 1836.

Lachmann&#x27;s &quot;Betrachtungen über Homer&#x27;s Iliad&quot;, first published in the &quot;Abhandlungen&quot; of the Berlin Academy in 1837 and 1841, in which he sought to show that the &quot;Iliad&quot; consists of eighteen independent &quot;layers&quot; variously enlarged and interpolated, had considerable influence on 19th century Homeric scholarship, although his views were later not accepted.

His smaller edition of the New Testament appeared in 1831, the 3rd edition in 1846, and the larger second edition, in two volumes, between 1842 and 1850. The plan of Lachmann&#x27;s edition, which he explained in &quot;Theologische Studien und Kritiken&quot; (1830), is a modification of the unaccomplished project of Richard Bentley (formulated in 1720) to establish a more reliable critical Greek edition of the New Testament than the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;. Lachmann was the first major editor to break from the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;, seeking to restore the most ancient reading current in manuscripts of the Alexandrian text-type, using the agreement of the Western authorities (Old Latin and Greek Western Uncials) as the main proof of antiquity of a reading where the oldest Alexandrian authorities differ.

Lachmann&#x27;s edition of Lucretius (1850), which was the principal occupation of his life from 1845, is perhaps his greatest achievement of scholarship. He demonstrated how the three main manuscripts all derived from one archetype, containing 302 pages of 26 lines to a page. Further, he was able to show that this archetype was a copy of a manuscript written in a minuscule hand, which was in turn a copy of a manuscript of the 4th or 5th centuries written in rustic capitals. To say his recreation of the text was &quot;accepted&quot; is an understatement; HAJ Munro characterized this accomplishment as &quot;a work which will be a landmark for scholars as long as the Latin language continues to be studied.&quot; Lachmann also edited Propertius (1816); Catullus (1829); Tibullus (1829); Genesius (1834); Terentianus Maurus (1836); Babrius (1845); Avianus (1845); Gaius (1841–1842); the &quot;Agrimensores Romani&quot; (1848–1852); and Lucilius (edited after his death by Vahlen, 1876). He also translated Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets (1820) and &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1829).

<text>Friedrich Heinrich von der Hagen (19 February 1780 – 11 June 1856) was a German philologist, chiefly distinguished for his researches in Old German literature.

He was born at Angermünde-Schmiedeberg in the Uckermark region of the Margraviate of Brandenburg. After studying law at the University of Halle, he obtained a legal appointment in the state service at Berlin, but in 1806 resigned in order to devote himself exclusively to letters. In 1810 he was appointed professor extraordinarius of German literature at the University of Berlin. In the following year he was transferred in a similar capacity to the University of Breslau, and in 1821 returned to Berlin as professor ordinarius.

<text>Catopsbaatar is a genus of multituberculate, an extinct order of rodent-like mammals. It lived in what is now Mongolia during the late Campanian age of the Late Cretaceous epoch, about 72 million years ago. The first fossils were collected in the early 1970s, and the animal was named as a new species of the genus &quot;Djadochtatherium&quot; in 1974, &quot;D. catopsaloides&quot;. The specific name refers to the animal&#x27;s similarity to the genus &quot;Catopsalis&quot;. The species was moved to the genus &quot;Catopsalis&quot; in 1979, and received its own genus (&quot;Catopsbaatar&quot;, Greek and Mongolian for &#x27;visible hero&#x27;) in 1994. Five skulls, one molar, and one skeleton with a skull are known; the last is the genus&#x27; most complete specimen. &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; was a member of the family Djadochtatheriidae.

The skull of &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; was up to long and, as in other multituberculates, proportionally large. The external appearance of these animals&#x27; heads may have been similar to those of rodents. The skull was heavy-set and wide, with the zygomatic arches strongly expanded to the sides. The eye sockets were smaller and placed further back than in its relatives, and the snout was more elongated. &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; had semicircular ridges on the side of the skull, to which the jaw muscles were attached. The mandible was strong and very elongated. It had very robust incisors, and cheek teeth with multiple cusps (for which multituberculates are named). The pelvic bones differed from those of other multituberculates in that they were not fused to each other. &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; had spurs on its ankles, like those of the male platypus and echidna, without evidence of a venom canal (present in the former).

The spurs of &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; and other Mesozoic mammals may have been used for protection against theropod dinosaurs and other predators. Multituberculates are thought to have given live birth, and the fact that they had hair indicates they were homeothermic (&quot;warmblooded&quot;). Multituberculates would have been omnivorous; &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; had powerful jaw muscles, and its incisors were well adapted for gnawing hard seeds, using a backwards chewing stroke. Multituberculates are thought to have had a sprawling posture, and &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; may have been able to jump. &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; is known from the Barun Goyot Formation, which is thought to be about 72 million years old.

==Taxonomy==

In 1970 and 1971, the Polish-Mongolian Palaeontological Expeditions collected mammalian fossils from the Barun Goyot Formation at the Red Beds of Hermiin Tsav (also spelled &quot;Khermeen Tsav&quot;) area in Mongolia&#x27;s Gobi Desert. About 100 specimens, recovered from four localities, are housed at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw. Two-thirds of the collected specimens were multituberculates: an extinct order of mammals with rodent-like dentition, named for the numerous cusps (or tubercles) on their molars. In 1974, Polish palaeontologist Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska named a new species of the Mongolian multituberculate genus &quot;Djadochtatherium&quot; as &quot;D. catopsaloides&quot;, with specimen ZPAL MgM−I/78 from the Polish collection as the holotype. The specific name refers to the animal&#x27;s similarity to the North American species &quot;Catopsalis joyneri&quot;, which Kielan-Jaworowska thought was a possible descendant. The specimen, collected at the Hermiin Tsav I locality, is an almost-complete skull of a juvenile with portions of the cranium damaged. Kielan-Jaworowska also assigned other specimens to the species: a damaged skull missing lower jaws (ZPAL MgM−I/79, an adult), a skull with partial lower jaws (ZPAL MgM−I/80), and a molar with a fragment of jaw (ZPAL MgM−I/159 from Khulsan, the only specimen not from the Hermiin Tsav I and II localities).

Kielan-Jaworowska and American palaeontologist Robert E. Sloan considered the genus &quot;Djadochtatherium&quot; a junior synonym of &quot;Catopsalis&quot;, and created the new combination &quot;C. catopsaloides&quot; in 1979. American palaeontologists Nancy B. Simmons and Miao Desui conducted a 1986 cladistic analysis which indicated that &quot;Catopsalis&quot; was a paraphyletic taxon (an unnatural grouping of species), and &quot;C. catopsaloides&quot; required its own generic name. Kielan-Jaworowska followed Simmons and Miao&#x27;s suggestion, moving &quot;C. catopsaloides&quot; to its own monotypic genus in 1994, &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot;. The word &quot;catops&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;katoptos&quot; (&quot;visible&quot; or &quot;evident&quot;); &quot;baatar&quot; is Mongolian for &quot;hero&quot;, and the name refers to &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot;&#x27;s similarity to the genus &quot;Catopsalis&quot; (as is the case for the specific name). The name &quot;Catopsalis&quot; itself consists of the Greek words for &quot;visible&quot; and &quot;cutting shears&quot; (&quot;psalis&quot;). The word &quot;baatar&quot; is used as a suffix in the names of many multituberculate genera, and alludes to the Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar, which itself means &quot;red hero&quot;.

Later in 1994, Kielan-Jaworowska and the Russian palaeontologist Petr P. Gambaryan mentioned caudal (tail) vertebrae which may have belonged to &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot;; this attribution is uncertain, since they may instead belong to the related &quot;Tombaatar&quot; (named in 1997). A fourth skull (PIN 4537/4, a juvenile), discovered during the 1975 Soviet−Mongolian Expedition, was mentioned by Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska in 1995. Canadian palaeontologist Phillip J. Currie found a new &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; specimen during the 1999 Dinosaurs of the Gobi expedition, organised by the American Nomadic Expeditions Company. Housed at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in Ulaanbaatar as PM120/107, this most completely preserved known specimen consists of the complete skull (which may be slightly flattened) and partial skeleton of an adult individual. The specimen has rather complete fore- and hind limbs, which were unknown for the genus until then and which are generally rarely preserved in multituberculates. Its pelvic ilia were stolen and destroyed by a schoolboy on tour at the Natural History Museum of Oslo, where it was being prepared in 2000. The specimen was reported in 2002 by Kielan-Jaworowska, Norwegian palaeontologist Jørn Hurum, Currie and Mongolian palaeontologist Rinchen Barsbold, who also mentioned another skull (PIN 4537/5, a juvenile) found during the 1975 expedition. &quot;Catopsalis joyneri&quot;, the basis of the name &quot;C. catopsaloides&quot;, was moved to the new genus &quot;Valenopsalis&quot; in 2015.

===Evolution===
&quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; belonged to the order Multituberculata, a group within Allotheria (an infraclass of mammals outside Theria, the group that contains modern placentals and marsupials). Multituberculates are characterised by having premolars and molars with multiple low cusps, arranged in longitudinal rows. They are the best-known group of mammals from the Mesozoic Era, when the dinosaurs dominated; although the earliest multituberculate remains are from the Jurassic Period, the group is known as recently as the Eocene Epoch (thereby surviving the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event). The group may have become extinct due to competition with eutherian mammals, such as rodents. Multituberculates were mainly known from teeth and jaws until the 1920s, when more complete specimens were discovered—first in Asia, and then elsewhere. Postcranial bones (the rest of the skeleton, other than the skull) remain rare.

Kielan-Jaworowska originally classified &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; as a member of the multituberculate family Taeniolabididae in 1974. In 1994, she suggested that &quot;Djadochtatherium&quot; was close to &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; ancestry. She and Hurum named a new family of multituberculates, Djadochtatheriidae (which they placed in the new suborder Djadochtatheria), in 1997. The family included the genera &quot;Djadochtatherium&quot;, &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot;, &quot;Kryptobaatar&quot;, and &quot;Tombaatar&quot;, all from the Gobi Desert. The family differs from other multituberculates (and other mammals) in that the front margins of its snout were confluent with the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), giving the snout a trapezoid shape when seen from above. In general, other mammals have snouts where the side margins are curved inward in front of the zygomatic arches. Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum revised the higher ranks within Multituberculata in 2001, replacing the suborder Djadochtatheria with the superfamily Djadochtatherioidea (placed in the suborder Cimolodonta).

The following cladogram shows the placement of &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; among other multituberculates according to Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum, 1997:
==Description==
===Skull===

The most complete adult &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; skull (specimen PM 120/107) is long and wide, with a lower jaw. By comparison, the skull of the juvenile holotype (ZPAL MgM−I/78) is about long and wide, with a lower jaw. The largest adult skull (ZPAL MgM−I/79) is long but, since it is incomplete, its other measurements are unknown. &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; was larger than its relatives, &quot;Kryptobaatar&quot; and &quot;Djadochtatherium&quot;. Multituberculates had relatively large skulls and short necks; their skulls were proportionally longer and wider than those of similarly sized rodents and marsupials. The external appearance of their heads may have been similar to those of rodents.

The skull of &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; was heavy-set, with a wide margin across the front. It was shorter along the midline than at the sides, because the nuchal crest at the back of the head curved inwards at the middle, creating an indention at the hind margin of the skull when viewed from above. The zygomatic arches were strongly expanded to the sides, with the skull width (across the arches) about 85 percent of the skull length. The front of the orbits (eye sockets) were further back than in other djadochtatheriids, resulting in a more elongated snout (65 percent of the skull length) and small orbits. The premaxilla (front bone of the upper jaw) extended less than two-thirds of the length of the snout in front of the eyes, shorter than that of &quot;Kryptobaatar&quot;. The premaxilla consisted of parts of the face and the palate; djadochtatheriids had a premaxillary ridge on the boundary between the two (visible when viewing the skull from below). The palatal part of the premaxilla was concave, with many randomly arranged nutrient foramina (openings). The nasal bone—which formed the upper part of the snout—was relatively wide (becoming wider towards the back), and its front was covered with irregularly spaced vascular foramina. The suture between the nasal and frontal bones was less pointed forwards in the middle than were those of &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot;&#x27;s relatives.

The maxilla (the main part of the upper jaw) was extensive, and formed most of the side of the snout. It contained all the upper teeth, except the incisors. The infraorbital foramina (openings at the lower front of the maxilla) were slit-like in some specimens and rounded in others, and varied in number from one to three. One of the most characteristic features of the face of &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; was the very large anterior zygomatic ridge on the sides of the upper jaw (a site for jaw-muscle attachment). It was much higher than in other djadochtatheriids except for &quot;Djadochtatherium&quot;, from which it differed in that the ridge was semicircular rather than roughly trapezoidal (other genera have elliptical ridges). The front margin of the anterior zygomatic ridge was thickened, which produced a bulge on the side margin of the snout when viewed from the side and above. The lower part of the suture between the maxilla and the squamosal bone extended along the hind border of the anterior zygomatic ridge. The palatal processes of the maxilla formed most of the palate. The major palatine foramina had shallow grooves extending forward. The postpalatine torus (a bony protrusion on the palate) of &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; was less prominent than was that of &quot;Tombaatar&quot;. The frontal bone was large, and formed most of the cranial roof. The suture between the frontal and parietal bones formed a U-shaped part in the middle which pointed backwards—similar to the condition in &quot;Kryptobaatar&quot; but less deep, with smaller U-shaped structures at the sides. This differed from &quot;Djadochtatherium&quot;, which had a narrower V-shaped suture between the frontal and parietal bones.

The intermediate zygomatic ridge on the squamosal bone (also for jaw-muscle attachment) was much smaller and lower than the anterior zygomatic ridge in front of it. &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; differed from other djadochtatheriids in that the intermediate ridge contacted the anterior ridge with its front edge. The posterior zygomatic ridge at the lower back of the squamosal bone was the weakest of the three ridges, and only marked by a depression. The postorbital processes behind the orbit on the parietal bone were very long, and the parietal ridges extended from the hind margin of the postorbital processes towards each other (but without reaching). The nuchal crest was very prominent, and extended to the sides to form &quot;wings&quot;. The occipital plate was almost vertical and slightly concave, and was obscured by the nuchal crest when the skull was viewed from above. Though incompletely preserved, it is assumed that the occipital plate sloped back and upwards from the occipital condyles (as in some relatives). The orbito-temporal vascular system inside the skull of &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; did not differ much from those of related genera.

&quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; mandible was robust and very elongated. The diastema (gap between the front and cheek teeth) was concave, and extended for 20 percent of the dentary bone (the main bone of the lower jaw). Seen from above, the diastema formed a wide shelf that sloped downwards on the inner side of the jaw. The small mental foramen was close to the upper middle margin of the diastema. The coronoid process of the mandible appears to have been relatively longer and narrower than in other djadochtatherioids. It was separated from the alveolar process (where the teeth are contained) by a wide groove. The mandibular condyle (which articulated with the skull) was slightly above the level of the molars. The front part of the masseteric crest was very prominent, forming a bulge known as a masseteric protuberance. The robustness of this crest and the presence of the protuberance varies among related genera. The masseteric (pit) in front of the masseteric fossa was probably more distinct than in other djadochtatherioids. Each half of the mandibular symphysis (where the two halves of the mandible connect) was shaped like an upside-down teardrop. The pterygoid fossa on the inner side of the mandible was very large, and occupied most of the hind part of the dentary. The lower part of this fossa had a boundary, known as the pterygoideus shelf.

===Dentition===

The dental formula (the number of teeth of each type in the tooth row of a mammal) of &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; was (two incisors, no canines, three premolars and two molars in half of the upper tooth row, and one incisor, no canines, two premolars and two molars in half of the lower). By comparison, the dental formula of humans is . Each tooth in a mammal is designated with a letter and number by position (I for incisor, C for canine, P for premolar, M for molar); the letters are capitalised for the teeth of the upper jaw, but not for those in the lower jaw. The cusp formula shows the arrangement and number of cusps in consecutive rows of a tooth, from the outer to the inner side; each row is separated by a colon.

Being a cimolodont, &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; did not have I1 incisors. The I2 upper-front incisors of &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; were very robust and had a sharply limited band of enamel. The two incisors converged slightly towards the middle, touching each other. The smaller I3 incisor behind was cone-shaped. The alveolus (tooth socket) of &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot;&#x27;s I3 incisor was formed by the premaxilla, rather than the premaxilla and maxilla (unlike in &quot;Tombaatar&quot;). The front upper premolars P1 and P3 were only present in juveniles (deciduous), disappearing (with their alveoli) in older individuals. P1 appears to have had two cusps, was single-rooted, and had a cone-like, blunt crown. P3 was single-rooted and smaller than P1. The cusp formula of the P4 premolar was 5−4:1, the central cusp being the largest. The P4 of &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; was almost trapezoidal in shape (unlike in &quot;Djadochtatherium&quot; and &quot;Kryptobaatar&quot;, where it is crescent-shaped), smaller, and lacking ridges. &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; also differed by having only three upper premolars, lacking the P2 (a feature shared with &quot;Tombaatar&quot;). Other mammals usually evolve the loss of teeth at the beginning or end of a tooth row, not in the middle (as in multituberculates). The cusp formula of the M1 molar was 5−6:5−6:4, with the inner ridge extending about 75 percent of the tooth&#x27;s length. The cusps of M1 were sharp and unworn in juveniles, but worn and concave in older animals. The cusp formula of the M2 molar was 2:2−3:2−3.

&quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; had a single lower pair of incisors, characteristic of multituberculates, which was very strong and compressed sideways. It had a sharply limited band of enamel, and grew continually. The p3 premolar was very small, and adhered entirely to the lower diastema under the larger p4. The blade-like p4 was roughly trapezoidal in side view, and had three cusps along the horizontal upper margin and one cusp on the outer back side. The p4 did not have the ridges on the outer and inner side, as are present in other multituberculates. The m1 molar was almost symmetrical, and its cusp formula was 4:4, the size of the cusps decreasing towards the back. The m2 had a cusp formula of 2−3:2, most specimens being 2:2. The cusps on the inner side were wider than those on the outer side, the inner row of cusps was shorter than the outer one, and the hind margin of the tooth was arranged obliquely.

===Postcranial skeleton===

The only &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; specimen which preserves the postcranial skeleton is PM120/107, which is fragmentary. It includes elements that are unknown, or incompletely preserved, in other multituberculates. One lumbar vertebra (the fifth or sixth, from between the rib cage and the pelvis) had a spinous process which was stout in side view and long when seen from above. The clavicle was slightly less curved than that of &quot;Kryptobaatar&quot; (resembling a bent rod which widened at each end), and measured about . The upper part of the scapulocoracoid was relatively wide in side view, and the lower part was very narrow. It was probably about long when complete. The preserved part of the humerus (upper arm bone) was about long. Its shaft was triangular in cross-section, relatively narrow when seen from above, and most of its width was occupied by the intertubercular groove. This groove was delimited on the side by the crest of the greater tubercle, whose middle part formed the deltopectoral crest. The ulnar condyle, where the ulna of the lower arm articulated with the humerus, was more prominent than the radial condyle (where the radius articulated), oval, and delimited from the radial condyle by a groove. The radius was about long, with a prominent head. Its shaft was smooth, compressed from top to bottom, and oval in cross-section. The ulna was compressed sideways, flatter than the radius, and about long as preserved.

The contact from the ischium to the ilium and pubis of the pelvis was not fused, and the front end of the ischium formed a rugose suture. The pubis was roughly triangular, with a rough suture for the ilium above and a deep groove for the ischium at the lower front. Specimen PM120/107&#x27;s pelvic bones differed from those of other multituberculates in not being fused together. The presence of sutures in the pelvis of PM120/107 indicates that it was a juvenile, although the skull appears adult; the meaning of this discrepancy is unknown. The femur (thigh bone) was proportionally similar to that of &quot;Eucosmodon&quot; and &quot;Nemegtbaatar&quot;—smaller than the former, but larger than the latter. The femur was stout relative to its length, and it may have been about long. The tibia of the lower leg was about long. Seen from behind the upper side, the tibia had a deep excavation (cavity) which may be characteristic of multituberculates.

Unlike most other multituberculates and other mammals, the calcaneus bone at the back of the foot had a short tuber calcanei (like some tree kangaroos), with an expanded, anvil-shaped proximal process strongly bent downwards and to the side. &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; had an os calcaris bone on the inner side of its ankle, a feature also seen in modern male monotremes (the platypus and the echidna) and other Mesozoic mammals. The os calcaris bone was plate-like and rectangular in outline; as in monotremes, it supported the cornu calcaris in forming a spur on the outer side of the tarsus (cluster of foot bones). Unlike with other Mesozoic mammals, these two elements were not fused together in multituberculates. The cornu calcaris was triangular, with a concavity in the middle, and was long. The spur was flattened, and was thicker at its conjunction with the os calcaris (where they connected via several ridges). As the spur of PM120/107 may have been moved from its original position, it is unknown whether it faced inwards (like in the platypus). Unlike in the platypus, there was no impression of a canal for venom. The cornu calcaris of &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; was ossified (turned into bone) and would have been covered in keratin (the horny covering seen in nails and hoofs). The cornu calcaris of the platypus consists only of keratin, and is hollow.

==Palaeobiology==

Hurum, Zhe-Xi Luo, and Kielan-Jaworowska suggested in 2006 that the spurs on the ankles of Mesozoic mammals (such as &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot;) were homologous with those of monotremes, and were a basal (or &quot;primitive&quot;) feature lost by later therian mammals. The male platypus uses the spur to deliver venom from a gland, but it is unknown if the extinct groups were venomous as well. Mesozoic mammals were mostly small (with exceptions such as the fox-sized &quot;Repenomamus&quot;) and, although they were too small to be prey for large theropod dinosaurs, smaller theropods, large lizards, crocodiles, and birds could have fed on them. For example, mammal jaws have been found in the abdomen of a specimen of the small theropod &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;; the jaws belonged to &quot;Zhangheotherium&quot;, which also had spurs, and the multituberculate &quot;Sinobaatar&quot;. Since dinosaurs dominated Earth during the Mesozoic, this period has been called the &quot;dark ages&quot; of mammalian history. The spur, which would have been more effective if venomous, was probably used as a defensive weapon by small, early mammals. It could also have been used during intraspecific competition or predation.

The pelvic bones of &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; specimen PM120/107 may not have been fused because fusion occurred late in development, because it was a sexually dimorphic feature occurring only in males (unfused pelvic bones might have enabled expansion of the birth canal in females), or pelvic fusion may be a taxonomic difference between &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; and other multituberculates. Unlike with other mammals, the pelvis of multituberculates was very narrow; in other genera where the pelvis is known, each half of the pubis and ischium were fused together, forming a keel. The length and rigidity of the keel indicate that the pelvis could not have spread during birth. Because there would be little space for the passage of an egg (egg-laying monotremes have wide ischial arches), Kielan-Jaworowska suggested in 1979 that multituberculates were viviparous (gave live birth) and that the newborns were extremely small—similar to those of marsupials.

Hair, structurally similar to that of modern mammals and associated with bones of the Mongolian multituberculate &quot;Lambdopsalis&quot;, has been identified in coprolites (fossilised feces) of carnivorous mammals from the Palaeocene Epoch. This indicates that multituberculates had hair for insulation, similar to modern mammals (and possibly fossil mammals), a feature probably related to homeothermy (warm-bloodedness).

===Feeding and diet===

Although multituberculates were thought to have been carnivores or herbivores, since American palaeontologist William A. Clemens and Kielan-Jaworowska suggested modern rat kangaroos as analogues for the group in 1979 they have been considered omnivores (feeding on both plants and animals). Uniquely among mammals, multituberculates employed a backward chewing stroke which resulted in the masticatory muscles—the muscles which move the mandible—being inserted more to the front than in other groups (including rodents). Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska reconstructed the masticatory musculature of various multituberculates in 1995, and found that &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; and its relatives had very powerful masticatory musculature, due to their high zygomatic arches and large anterior and intermediate zygomatic ridges and coronoid processes. Their powerful incisors, with limited bands of enamel, would have been well adapted to gnawing and to cutting hard seeds (similar to rodents). Since it was larger than some other multituberculates, &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; would have to open its mouth only 25 degrees to crush hard seeds in diameter; a 40-degree gape would have caused dislocation. After the incisors cut, the premolars and molars would begin to grind with a &quot;power stroke&quot;.

According to Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska, the adaptation for crushing hard seeds sometimes—as in &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot;—opposed the benefit of a low condylar process (which discourages mandibular dislocation). The anterior and intermediate zygomatic ridges of the skull were the origin of the superficial masseter muscle, which facilitates chewing. The separation of the origin of this muscle into two parts and the rounded muscle scars left by them are unique among mammals to multituberculates. The masticatory muscles of multituberculates independently evolved features shared with rodents and small herbivorous marsupials. As with rodents, multituberculates may have been capable of bilateral mastication—where both rows of teeth in the mandible perform the same function simultaneously—and unilateral mastication (where the rows on one side are used).

===Posture and locomotion===

The limb posture of multituberculates has been debated. According to some researchers, they employed a parasagittal stance with the erect limbs under the body; others consider a sprawling stance more likely. Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum supported the latter theory in 2006 based on the presence of hind-leg spurs, a feature they considered present only in sprawling mammals. They pointed out that all early mammals preserved in lacustrine (lake) deposits were compressed from top to bottom, suggesting a sprawling stance, whereas later mammals were preserved on their flanks. Earlier arguments for a sprawling stance include deep pelvises and features of the legs. They also suggested that the feet of multituberculates would have been plantigrade (the sole touching the ground) at rest, but digitigrade (the sole not touching the ground) when jumping and running quickly; they dismissed the idea that the forelimbs of multituberculates and other early mammals were more parasagittal than their hindlimbs. Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum depicted &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; with plantigrade, sprawling legs, with mobile spurs which pointed inward when preparing for attack.

In 2008, Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum suggested that the long spinous process on a &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; vertebra and the long transverse processes in &quot;Nemegtbaatar&quot; may indicate that some multituberculates were saltatorial (had the ability to jump). &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; probably had strong muscles attaching to the tuber calcanei, which further supports the jumping hypothesis. Although it has been suggested that multituberculates were arboreal (lived in trees), most Asian taxa were probably terrestrial; some others were fossorial, digging and living underground.

==Palaeoenvironment==

All specimens of &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; are known from the Barun Goyot Formation of the Gobi Desert, which probably dates to the late Campanian age of the Late Cretaceous epoch (about 72 million years ago). The specimens were discovered in the Red Beds of Hermiin Tsav area except for one molar from Khulsan. When &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot; was discovered, the Red Beds of Hermiin Tsav area was thought to be a distinct formation coeval (of the same geological age) with the Barun Goyot Formation, as they contain many of the same animals, but is now thought to correspond to different levels of the Barun Goyot and Nemegt formations. The rock facies of the Red Beds of Hermiin Tsav area consist of orange-coloured, thick-bedded sandstone, with a thin interbedding of light-coloured silt stones and claystones. The rock facies of the Barun Goyot Formation are considered to be the result of an arid or semi-arid environment, with aeolian (deposited by wind) beds. Other known mammals from the Red Beds of Hermiin Tsav include the multituberculates &quot;Nemegtbaatar&quot;, &quot;Chulsanbaatar&quot; and &quot;Nessovbaatar&quot;, and the therians &quot;Deltatheridium&quot;, &quot;Asioryctes&quot;, and &quot;Barunlestes&quot;. Dinosaurs include &quot;Heyuannia&quot;, &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, &quot;Saichania&quot;, &quot;Platyceratops&quot;, &quot;Gobiceratops&quot;, and some indeterminate theropods. Reptiles include the turtle &quot;Mongolemys&quot;, the lizards &quot;Gobinatus&quot;, &quot;Tchingisaurus&quot;, &quot;Prodenteia&quot;, &quot;Gladidenagama&quot; and &quot;Phrynosomimus&quot;, and an indeterminate crocodile. The frog &quot;Gobiates&quot; and an indeterminate alexornithiform bird are also known. Ostracods include &quot;Limnocythere&quot;, &quot;Cypridea&quot;, and &quot;Eucypris&quot;.

<doc id="209348" wikidata="Q213573" url="?curid=209348" title="Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany">
<text>Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany (Frederick Augustus; 16 August 1763 – 5 January 1827) was the second son of George III, King of the United Kingdom and Hanover, and his consort Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. A soldier by profession, from 1764 to 1803 he was Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück in the Holy Roman Empire. From the death of his father in 1820 until his own death in 1827, he was the heir presumptive to his elder brother, George IV, in both the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Kingdom of Hanover.

Frederick was thrust into the British Army at a very early age and was appointed to high command at the age of thirty, when he was given command of a notoriously ineffectual campaign during the War of the First Coalition, a continental war following the French Revolution. Later, as Commander-in-Chief during the Napoleonic Wars, he oversaw the reorganisation of the British Army, establishing vital structural, administrative and recruiting reforms for which he is credited with having done &quot;more for the army than any one man has done for it in the whole of its history&quot;.

==Early life==
Prince Frederick Augustus belonged to the House of Hanover. He was born on 16 August 1763, at St. James&#x27;s Palace, London. His father was the reigning British monarch, King George III. His mother was Queen Charlotte (née Princess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz).

On 27 February 1764, when Prince Frederick was six months old, he became Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück upon the death of Clemens August of Bavaria. The Peace of Westphalia stipulated that the city of Osnabrück would alternate between Catholic and Protestant rulers, with the Protestant bishops to be elected from the cadets of the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg. The bishopric of Osnabrück came with a substantial income, which he retained until the city was incorporated into Hanover in 1803 during the German mediatisation. He was invested as Knight of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath on 30 December 1767 and as a Knight of the Order of the Garter on 19 June 1771.

==Military career==

George III decided that his second son would pursue an army career and had him gazetted colonel on 4 November 1780. From 1781 to 1787, Prince Frederick lived in Hanover, where he studied (along with his younger brothers, Prince Edward, Prince Ernest, Prince Augustus and Prince Adolphus) at the University of Göttingen. He was appointed colonel of the 2nd Horse Grenadier Guards (now 2nd Life Guards) on 26 March 1782 before being promoted to major-general on 20 November 1782. Promoted to lieutenant general on 27 October 1784, he was appointed colonel of the Coldstream Guards on 28 October 1784.

He was created Duke of York and Albany and Earl of Ulster on 27 November 1784 and became a member of the Privy Council. On his return to Great Britain, the Duke took his seat in the House of Lords, where, on 15 December 1788 during the Regency crisis, he opposed William Pitt&#x27;s Regency Bill in a speech which was supposed to have been influenced by the Prince of Wales. On 26 May 1789 he took part in a duel with Colonel Charles Lennox, who had insulted him; Lennox missed, and Prince Frederick refused to return fire.

===Flanders===
On 12 April 1793, Frederick was promoted to full general. That year, he was sent to Flanders in command of the British contingent of Coburg&#x27;s army destined for the invasion of France. Frederick and his command fought in the Flanders campaign under extremely trying conditions. He won several notable engagements, such as the Siege of Valenciennes in July 1793, but was defeated at the Battle of Hondschoote in September 1793. In the 1794 campaign he gained a notable success at the Battle of Beaumont in April and another at the Battle of Willems in May but was defeated at the Battle of Tourcoing later that month. The British army was evacuated through Bremen in April 1795.

===Commander-in-Chief===

After his return to Britain, his father George III promoted him to the rank of field marshal on 18 February 1795. On 3 April 1795, George appointed him effective Commander-in-Chief in succession to Lord Amherst although the title was not confirmed until three years later. He was also colonel of the 60th Regiment of Foot from 19 August 1797.

On appointment as Commander-in-Chief he immediately declared, reflecting on the Flanders Campaign of 1793–94, &quot;that no officer should ever be subject to the same disadvantages under which he had laboured&quot;.

His second field command was with the army sent for the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in August 1799. On 7 September 1799, he was given the honorary title of Captain-General. Sir Ralph Abercromby and Admiral Sir Charles Mitchell, in charge of the vanguard, had succeeded in capturing some Dutch warships in Den Helder. However, following the Duke&#x27;s arrival with the main body of the army, a number of disasters befell the allied forces, including shortage of supplies. On 17 October 1799, the Duke signed the Convention of Alkmaar, by which the allied expedition withdrew after giving up its prisoners. 1799 also saw Fort Frederick in South Africa named after him.

Frederick&#x27;s military setbacks of 1799 were inevitable given his lack of experience as a field commander, the poor state of the British army at the time, and the conflicting military objectives of the protagonists. After this ineffectual campaign, Frederick was mocked, perhaps unfairly, in the rhyme &quot;The Grand Old Duke of York&quot;:

Frederick&#x27;s experience in the Dutch campaign made a strong impression on him. That campaign, and the Flanders campaign, had demonstrated the numerous weaknesses of the British army after years of neglect. Frederick as Commander-in-Chief of the British army carried through a massive programme of reform. He was the person most responsible for the reforms that created the force which served in the Peninsular War. He was also in charge of the preparations against Napoleon&#x27;s planned invasion of the United Kingdom in 1803. In the opinion of Sir John Fortescue, Frederick did &quot;more for the army than any one man has done for it in the whole of its history&quot;.

In 1801 Frederick actively supported the foundation of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, which promoted the professional, merit-based training of future commissioned officers.

In 1801 touched by the plight of children orphaned as a result of the Napoleonic wars, Frederick issued a Royal Warrant and laid the foundation stone in Chelsea to build the Royal Military Asylum (now known as the Duke of York&#x27;s Headquarters) for orphaned children. In 1892 the Royal Military Asylum was renamed the Duke of York&#x27;s Royal Military School. The school relocated to Dover, Kent in 1909.

On 14 September 1805 he was given the honorary title of Warden of Windsor Forest.

Frederick resigned as Commander-in-Chief on 25 March 1809, as the result of a scandal caused by the activities of his latest mistress, Mary Anne Clarke. Clarke was accused of illicitly selling army commissions under Frederick&#x27;s aegis. A select committee of the House of Commons enquired into the matter. Parliament eventually acquitted Frederick of receiving bribes by 278 votes to 196. He nevertheless resigned because of the high tally against him. Two years later, it was revealed that Clarke had received payment for furniture from Frederick&#x27;s disgraced chief accuser, Gwyllym Wardle, and the Prince Regent reappointed the exonerated Frederick as Commander-in-Chief on 29 May 1811. The Duke&#x27;s relationship with Mary Anne Clarke is used by Mary Anne&#x27;s descendant, Daphne du Maurier, in her historical novel Mary Anne.

Frederick maintained a country residence at Oatlands near Weybridge, Surrey but he was seldom there, preferring to immerse himself in his administrative work at Horse Guards (the British army&#x27;s headquarters) and, after hours, in London&#x27;s high life, with its gaming tables: Frederick was perpetually in debt because of his excessive gambling on cards and racehorses. Following the unexpected death of his niece, Princess Charlotte of Wales, in 1817, Frederick became second in line to the throne, with a serious chance of inheriting it. In 1820, he became heir presumptive with the death of his father, George III.

==Death==
Frederick died of dropsy and apparent cardiovascular disease at the home of the Duke of Rutland on Arlington Street, London, in 1827. After lying in state at the Chapel Royal in London, Frederick&#x27;s remains were interred in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, following his funeral there. The chapel was so cold during the funeral, held at night, that the Foreign Secretary, George Canning, contracted rheumatic fever, becoming so ill that he thought he might not recover; Canning died on 8 August the same year.

==Family==

Frederick married his third cousin Princess Frederica Charlotte of Prussia, the daughter of King Frederick William II of Prussia and Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Lüneburg, at Charlottenburg, Berlin, on 29 September 1791 and again on 23 November 1791 at Buckingham Palace. The marriage was not a happy one and the couple soon separated. Frederica retired to Oatlands, where she lived until her death in 1820.

==Honours and arms==

===Honours===
His honours were as follows:
*Royal Knight of the Order of the Garter, &quot;19 June 1771&quot;
*Knight Grand Cross (military) of the Order of the Bath, &quot;2 January 1815&quot;
*Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order, &quot;12 August 1815&quot;

*Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Maria Theresa of Austria, &quot;1814&quot;

==Legacy==
Fredericton, the capital of the Canadian province of New Brunswick, was named after Prince Frederick. The city was originally named &quot;Frederick&#x27;s Town&quot;.

Also in Canada, Duke of York Bay, Nunavut was named in his honour, since it was discovered on his birthday, 16 August.

A statue of Prince Frederick, stands on the grounds of Edinburgh Castle, Scotland and was unveiled in 1836. The inscription reads: &quot;Field Marshall His Royal Highness Frederick Duke of York and Albany K.G. Commander and Chief of the British Army MDCCCXXVII.&quot;

In Western Australia, York County and the towns of York and Albany were named after Prince Frederick. Albany was originally named &quot;Frederick Town&quot;.

The towering Duke of York Column on Waterloo Place, just off The Mall, London was completed in 1834 as a memorial to Prince Frederick.

The 72nd Regiment of Foot was given the title &quot;Duke of Albany&#x27;s Own Highlanders&quot; in 1823 and, in 1881, became 1st Battalion Seaforth Highlanders (Ross-shire Buffs, The Duke of Albany&#x27;s).

The first British fortification in southern Africa, Fort Frederick, Port Elizabeth, a city in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, was built in 1799 to prevent French assistance for rebellious Boers in the short-lived republic of Graaff-Reinet.

The Duke of York&#x27;s Royal Military School is named in the duke&#x27;s honour as he was largely responsible for the founding of the school by Royal Warrant in 1801 (it was originally called the Royal Military Asylum for the Children of Soldiers of the Regular Army). The school was moved to its current site near Dover in 1909. The original building still stands in Chelsea, London.

<doc id="209350" wikidata="Q44385" url="?curid=209350" title="Walther von der Vogelweide">
<text>Walther von der Vogelweide (; ) was a Minnesänger who composed and performed love-songs and political songs (&quot;Sprüche&quot;) in Middle High German. Walther has been described as the greatest German lyrical poet before Goethe; his hundred or so love-songs are widely regarded as the pinnacle of Minnesang, the medieval German love lyric, and his innovations breathed new life into the tradition of courtly love. He was also the first political poet to write in German, with a considerable body of encomium, satire, invective, and moralising.

Little is known about Walther&#x27;s life. He was a travelling singer who performed for patrons at various princely courts in the states of the Holy Roman Empire. He is particularly associated with the Babenberg court in Vienna. Later in life he was given a small fief by the future Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II.

His work was widely celebrated in his time and in succeeding generations—for the Meistersingers he was a songwriter to emulate—and this is reflected in the exceptional preservation of his work in 32 manuscripts from all parts of the High German area. The largest single collection is found in the Codex Manesse, which includes around 90% of his known songs. However, most Minnesang manuscripts preserve only the texts, and only a handful of Walther&#x27;s melodies survive.

Notable songs include the love-song &quot;Under der linden&quot;, the contemplative &quot;Elegy&quot;, and the religious &quot;Palästinalied&quot;, for which the melody has survived.

==Life history==

For all his fame, Walther&#x27;s name is not found in contemporary records, with the exception of a solitary mention in the travelling accounts of Bishop Wolfger von Erla of the Passau diocese: (To Walther the singer of the Vogelweide five shillings for a fur coat.) The main sources of information about him are his own poems and occasional references by contemporary Minnesingers. He was a knight, but probably not a wealthy or landed one. His surname, von der Vogelweide, suggests that he had no grant of land, since (&#x27;the bird-pasture&#x27;) seems to refer to a general geographic feature, not a specific place. He probably was knighted for military bravery and was a retainer in a wealthy, noble household before beginning his travels.

===Chronological overview===
===Birthplace===
Walther&#x27;s birthplace remains unknown, and given the lack of documentary evidence, it will probably never be known exactly. There is little chance of deriving it from his name; in his day there were many so-called in the vicinity of castles and towns, where hawks were caught for hawking or songbirds for people&#x27;s homes. For this reason, it must be assumed that the singer did not obtain his name primarily for superregional communication, because it could not be used for an unambiguous assignment. Other persons of the high nobility and poets who traveled with their masters used the unambiguous name of their ownership or their place of origin; therefore, the name was meaningful only in the near vicinity, where only one Vogelweide existed or it was understood as a metaphoric surname of the singer. Pen-names were usual for poets of the 12th and 13th century, whereas Minnesingers in principle were known by their noble family name which was used to sign documents.

In 1974, Helmut Hörner identified a farmhouse mentioned in 1556 as in the &quot;urbarium&quot; of the domain Rappottenstein. At this time it belonged to the &quot;Amt Traunstein&quot;, now within the municipality Schönbach in the Lower Austrian Waldviertel. Its existence had already been mentioned without comment in 1911 by Alois Plesser, who also did not know its precise location. Hörner proved that the still-existing farmhouse &quot;Weid&quot; is indeed the mentioned and collected arguments for Walther being born in the Waldviertel (&quot;Forest Quarter&quot;). He published this in his 1974 book (800 years Traunstein), pointing out that Walther says (&quot;In Austria [at this time only Lower Austria and Vienna], I learned to sing and to speak&quot;). A tradition says that Walther, one of the ten &quot;Old Masters&quot;, was a Landherr (land owner) from Bohemia, which does not contradict his possible origin in the Waldviertel, because in mediaeval times the Waldviertel was from time to time denoted as . Powerful support for this theory was given in 1977 and 1981 by Bernd Thum (University Karlsruhe, Germany), which makes an origin in the Waldviertel very plausible. Thum began with an analysis of the content of Walther&#x27;s work, especially of his crusade appeal, also known as &quot;old age elegy&quot;, and concluded that Walther&#x27;s birthplace was far away from all travelling routes of this time and within a region where land was still cleared. This is because the singer pours out his sorrows and suggests he no longer knows his people and land, applicable to the Waldviertel.

Additionally in 1987, Walter Klomfar and the librarian Charlotte Ziegler came to the conclusion that Walther might have been born in the Waldviertel. The starting point for their study is also the above-mentioned words of Walther. These were placed into doubt by research, but strictly speaking do not mention his birthplace. Klomfar points to a historical map which was drawn by monks of the Zwettl monastery in the 17th century, on the occasion of a legal dispute. This map shows a village &quot;Walthers&quot; and a field marked (near Allentsteig) and a related house belonging to the village. The village became deserted, but a well marked on the map could be excavated and reconstructed to prove the accuracy of the map. Klomfar was also able to partly reconstruct land ownership in this region and prove the existence of the (not rare) Christian name &quot;Walther&quot;.

Contrary to this theory, Franz Pfeiffer assumed that the singer was born in the Wipptal in South Tyrol, where, not far from the small town of Sterzing on the Eisack, a wood—called the &quot;Vorder- and Hintervogelweide&quot;—exists. This would, however, contradict the fact that Walther was not able to visit his homeland for many decades. At this time Tyrol was the home of several well-known &quot;Minnesingers&quot;.

===Vienna===
The court of Vienna, under Duke Frederick I of the house of Babenberg, had become a centre of poetry and art. Here it was that the young poet learned his craft under the renowned master Reinmar von Hagenau, whose death he afterwards lamented in two of his most beautiful lyrics; and in the open-handed duke, he found his first patron. This happy period of his life, during which he produced the most charming and spontaneous of his love-lyrics, came to an end with the death of Duke Frederick in 1198.

===Years of wandering===
Henceforward Walther was a wanderer from court to court, singing for his lodging and his bread, and ever hoping that some patron would arise to save him from this &quot;juggler&#x27;s life&quot; () and the shame of ever playing the guest. He had few if any possessions and depended on others for his food and lodging, as knights bachelor [those not members of a knightly order such as the Garter in Britain also did. His criticism of men and manners was scathing; and even when this did not touch his princely patrons, their underlings often took measures to rid themselves of so uncomfortable a censor.
Thus he was forced to leave the court of the generous duke Bernhard of Carinthia (1202–1256); after an experience of the tumultuous household of the landgrave of Thuringia, he warns those who have weak ears to give it a wide berth. After three years spent at the court of Dietrich I of Meissen (reigned 1195–1221), he complains that he had received for his services neither money nor praise.

Generosity could be mentioned by Walther von der Vogelweide. He received a diamond from the high noble Diether III von Katzenelnbogen around 1214:

Walther was, in fact, a man of strong views; and it is this which gives him his main significance in history, as compared to his place in literature. From the moment when the death of the emperor Henry VI (1197) opened the fateful struggle between empire and papacy, Walther threw himself ardently into the fray on the side of German independence and unity. Although his religious poems sufficiently prove the sincerity of his Catholicism, he remained to the end of his days opposed to the extreme claims of the popes, whom he attacks with a bitterness which can be justified only by the strength of his patriotic feelings. His political poems begin with an appeal to Germany, written in 1198 at Vienna, against the disruptive ambitions of the princes: &quot;Crown Philip with the Kaiser&#x27;s crown And bid them vex thy peace no more.&quot;

He was present in 1198 at Philip&#x27;s coronation at Mainz, and supported him till his victory was assured. After Philip&#x27;s murder in 1208, he &quot;said and sang&quot; in support of Otto of Brunswick against the papal candidate Frederick of Hohenstaufen; and only when Otto&#x27;s usefulness to Germany had been shattered by the Battle of Bouvines (1214) did he turn to the rising star of Frederick, now the sole representative of German majesty against pope and princes.

===Later years===
From the new emperor, Walther&#x27;s genius and zeal for the empire finally received recognition: a small fief in Franconia was bestowed upon him, which—though he complained that its value was little—gave him the home and the fixed position he had so long desired. That Frederick gave him a further sign of favour by making him the tutor of his son Henry (VII), King of the Romans, is more than doubtful. The fact, in itself highly improbable, rests upon the evidence of only a single poem, the meaning of which can also be interpreted otherwise. Walther&#x27;s restless spirit did not suffer him to remain long on his new property.

In 1217 he was once more in Vienna, and again in 1219 after the return of Duke Leopold VI from the crusade. About 1224 he seems to have settled on his fief near Würzburg. He was active in urging the German princes to take part in the crusade of 1228, and may have accompanied the crusading army at least as far as his native Tirol. In a poem he pictures in words the changes that had taken place in the scenes of his childhood, changes which made his life there seem to have been only a dream.

Von der Vogelweide died about 1230, and was buried at Würzburg, after leaving instructions – according to the story – that the birds were to be fed at his tomb daily. His original gravestone with its Latin inscription has disappeared, but in 1843 a new monument was erected over the spot, called the (Little Lusam Garden), today sheltered by the two major churches of the city.

==The manuscripts==
Walther&#x27;s work is exceptionally well preserved compared to that of his contemporaries, with over 30 complete manuscripts and fragments containing widely varying numbers of strophes under his name. The most extensive collections of his songs are in four of the main Minnesang manuscripts:

*MS A (the Kleine Heidelberger Liederhandschrift) has 151 strophes under Walther&#x27;s name, along with others almost certainly written by Walther but included in the works of other Minnesänger (Hartmann von Aue, Liutold von Seven, Niune, Reinmar von Hagenau and Ulrich von Singenberg).
* MS B (the Weingarten Manuscript) has 112 strophes under Walther&#x27;s name.
*MS C (the Große Heidelberger Liederhandschrift, the Manesse Codex) has by far the largest collection, with 440 strophes and the Leich, and additional strophes by Walther under the names of other poets (Hartmann von Aue, Heinrich von Morungen, Reinmar von Hagenau, Rudolf von Neuenburg, Rudolf von Rotenburg, Rubin and Walther von Mezze).
* MS E (the Würzburg Manuscript) has 212 strophes under Walther&#x27;s name and some wrongly ascribed to Reinmar.

Manuscripts B and C have miniatures showing Walther in the pose described in the &quot;&quot; (L 8,4 C 2), (&quot;I sat upon a stone&quot;).

In addition to these, there are many manuscripts with smaller amounts of material, sometimes as little as a single strophe. In the surviving complete manuscripts, there are often missing pages in the sections devoted to Walther, which indicates lost material, as well blank space left by the scribes to make allowance for later additions.

With the exception of MS M (the &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;), which may even have been compiled in Walther&#x27;s lifetime, all the sources date from at least two generations after his death, and most are from the 14th or 15th centuries.

==Melodies==
As with most Minnesänger of his era, few of Walther&#x27;s melodies have survived. Certain or potential melodies to Walther&#x27;s songs come from three sources: those documented in the 14th-century Münster Fragment (MS Z) under Walther&#x27;s name, melodies of the Meistersinger attributed to Walther, and, more speculatively, French and Provençal melodies of the trouvères and troubadours which fit Walther&#x27;s songs and might therefore be the source of contrafactures. The latter are the only potential melodies to Walther&#x27;s love songs, the remainder being for religious and political songs.
===Münster fragment===
*The complete melody of the &quot;Palästinalied&quot;, (L14, 38; C 7)
*Partial melodies for
**The &quot;Second Philipps-Ton&quot;, (L16,36; C 8)
**The &quot;König-Friedrichs-Ton&quot;, (L26,3; C 11)
There are further melodies in two early manuscripts, M (the Carmina Burana) and N (Kremsmünster Stiftsbibliothek, Codex 127) but they are recorded in staffless neumes and cannot be reliably interpreted.

===Meistersang manuscripts===
*The Meistersingers&#x27; &quot;Hof- oder Wendelweise&quot; is Walther&#x27;s &quot;Wiener Hofton&quot;, (L20,16; C 10)
*The Meistersingers&#x27; &quot;Feiner Ton&quot; is Walther&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, (L11,6; C 4) 
The ascription of other melodies to Walther in the Meistersang manuscripts (the &quot;Goldene Weise&quot;, the &quot;Kreuzton&quot;, and the &quot;Langer Ton&quot;) is regarded as erroneous.

===Possible contrafactures===
The following songs by Walther share a strophic form with a French or Provençal song, and Walther&#x27;s texts may therefore have been written for the Romance melodies, though there can be no certainty of the contrafacture:
*&quot; (L39,1;C 15): &quot; by Moniot de Paris
*&quot;Under der linden&quot; (L39,11;C 16): the anonymous &quot;En mai au douz tens novels&quot;
*&quot;&quot; (L51,13; C 28): &quot;Quant je voi l&#x27;erbe menue&quot; by Gautier d&#x27;Espinal
*&quot;&quot; (L75,25; C 52): &quot;Amours et bone volonté&quot; by Gautier d&#x27;Espinal
*&quot;&quot; (L100,24; C 70) &quot;Onques mais nus hons de chanta&quot; by Blondel de Nesle
*&quot;&quot; (L110,33; C 78): &quot;Qan vei la flor&quot; by Bernart de Ventadorn

===Lost manuscripts with melodies===
There is evidence that the surviving volume of the Jenaer Liederhandschrift was originally accompanied by another with melodies for Walther&#x27;s Leich and some Sprüche. Further manuscript fragments containing melodies in the possession of (hence the &quot;Docen fragments&quot;) were inspected by von der Hagen early in the 19th century, but are now lost.

==Legacy==
===Assessment===
A contemporary assessment of Walther&#x27;s songs comes from Gottfried von Strassburg, who, unlike modern commentators, was able to evaluate Walther&#x27;s achievements as composer and performer, and who, writing in the first decade of the 13th century, proposed him as the &quot;leader&quot; of the Minnesänger after the death of Reinmar.
Grove Music Online evaluates Walther&#x27;s work as follows:
He is regarded as one of the most outstanding and innovative authors of his generation... His poetic oeuvre is the most varied of his time... and his poetry treats a number of subjects, adopting frequently contradictory positions. In his work he freed Minnesang from the traditional patterns of motifs and restricting social function and transformed it into genuinely experienced and yet universally valid love-poetry.
Will Hasty&#x27;s evaluation of the love songs is that:

Walther&#x27;s main contribution to the German love lyric was to increase the range of roles that could be adopted by the singer and his beloved, and to lend the depiction of the experience of love new immediacy and vibrancy.

Of the political works, Hasty concludes that:

In Walther&#x27;s political and didactic poetry we again observe a consummately versatile poetic voice, one which finds new ways to give artistic expression to experience despite the constraints of the taste of audiences and patrons and by the authority of literary conventions.
===Reception===

Walther is one of the traditional competitors in the tale of the song contest at the Wartburg. He appears in medieval accounts and continues to be mentioned in more modern versions of the story such as that in Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. He is also named by Walther von Stolzing, the hero of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, as his poetic model.

Walter is mentioned in Samuel Beckett&#x27;s short story &quot;The Calmative&quot;: &quot;Seeing a stone seat by the kerb I sat down and crossed my legs, like Walther.&quot;

In 1975, the German poet Peter Rühmkorf published , in which he provided modernised and colloquial verse translations of 34 songs by Walther, accompanied by commentary.

Historical fiction with Walther in a major role includes 1976 work (&quot;The Morning-Star, or the Four Metamorphoses of a man called Walther von der Vogelweide&quot;), and two novels about Frederick II, Waltraud Lewin&#x27;s &quot;Federico&quot; (1984) and &quot;Mann aus Apulien&quot; (1986).

In 2013, the Galleria Lia Rumma in Naples exhibited a series of works by Anselm Kiefer (two large paintings and a group of books) relating to &quot;&quot; under the title .

===Commemoration===
In 1889, a statue of Walther was unveiled in a square in Bolzano (see above), which was subsequently renamed the . Under fascist rule, the statue was moved to a less prominent site, but it was restored to its original location in 1981.

There are two statues of Walther in fountains in Würzburg, one near the Würzburg Residence and another in the Walther-Schule. There are also statues in: Weißensee (Thuringia); Sankt Veit an der Glan and Innsbruck in Austria; and Duchcov in the Czech Republic.

Apart from his grave in Würzburg, there are also memorials in: the Knüll-Storkenberg nature reserve, Halle (Westfalia); ; the Walhalla memorial near Regensburg; Lajen, South Tyrol, Zwettl, Gmunden and the ruined Mödling Castle, all in Austria.

There are schools named after him in Bozen, Aschbach-Markt and Würzburg.

==Editions==

There have been more scholarly editions of Walther&#x27;s works than of any other medieval German poet&#x27;s, a reflection of both his importance to literary history and the complex manuscript tradition. The following highly selective list includes only the seminal 19th Century edition of Lachmann and the most important recent editions. A history of the main editions will be found in the introduction to the Lachmann/Cormeau/Bein edition.

Consistent reference to Walther&#x27;s songs is made by means of &quot;Lachmann numbers&quot;, which are formed of an &quot;L&quot; (for &quot;Lachmann&quot;) followed by the page and line number in Lachmann&#x27;s edition of 1827. Thus &quot;Under der linden&quot;, which starts on line 11 on page 39 of that edition (shown in the page image, right) is referred to as L39,11, and the second line of the first strophe is L39,12, etc. All serious editions and translations of Walther&#x27;s songs either give the Lachmann numbers alongside the text or provide a concordance of Lachmann numbers for the poems in the edition or translation.

* The first scholarly edition and continually revised since 1827. However, the revised editions edited by Carl von Kraus between 1936 and 1959 are now considered out of keeping with modern editorial principles. The most recent update, now the standard edition of Walther&#x27;s works, is:
* Includes all Walther&#x27;s songs known at the time.
* 

==Translations==
===Modern German===
* Verse translation. 1894 edition; 1906 edition, lacking the commentary.
* Translation only, but with Lachmann numbers.
* Includes many of Walther&#x27;s songs.
* 
* Schweikle&#x27;s two-volume edition, listed above, includes parallel translation.

===English===
* Translation only.
* 
* Parallel text; contains only the political songs.

<doc id="209351" wikidata="Q161159" url="?curid=209351" title="Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz">
<text>Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (Sophia Charlotte; 19 May 1744 – 17 November 1818) was Queen of Great Britain and Ireland as the wife of King George III from their marriage on 8 September 1761 until her death in 1818. The Acts of Union 1800 unified Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. As George&#x27;s wife, she was also Electress of Hanover until becoming Queen of Hanover on 12 October 1814. Charlotte was Britain&#x27;s longest-serving queen consort, serving for 57 years and 70 days.

Charlotte was born into the ruling family of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, a duchy in northern Germany. In 1760, the young and unmarried George III inherited the British throne. As Charlotte was a minor German princess with no interest in politics, the King considered her a suitable consort, and they married in 1761. The marriage lasted 57 years and produced 15 children, 13 of whom survived to adulthood. They included two future British monarchs, George IV and William IV; as well as Charlotte, Princess Royal, who became Queen of Württemberg; and Prince Ernest Augustus, who became King of Hanover.

Charlotte was a patron of the arts and an amateur botanist who helped expand Kew Gardens. She introduced the Christmas tree to Britain, decorating one for a Christmas party for children of Windsor in 1800. She was distressed by her husband&#x27;s bouts of physical and mental illness, which became permanent in later life. Charlotte was deeply shocked by the events of the French Revolution and of the ensuing Napoleonic Wars which threatened the safety and sovereignty of her homeland. Her eldest son, George, was appointed prince regent in 1811 due to the increasing severity of the King&#x27;s illness. Charlotte died at Kew Palace in November 1818, with several of her children at her side. George III died a little over a year later, probably unaware of his wife&#x27;s death.

==Early life==

Princess Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was born on 19 May 1744. She was the youngest daughter of Duke Charles Louis Frederick of Mecklenburg, Prince of Mirow (1708–1752), and his wife Princess Elisabeth Albertine of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1713–1761). Mecklenburg-Strelitz was a small north-German duchy in the Holy Roman Empire.

The children of Duke Charles were all born at the Unteres Schloss (Lower Castle) in Mirow. 
According to diplomatic reports at the time of her engagement to George III in 1761, Charlotte had received &quot;a very mediocre education&quot; and contemporary Britons including Elizabeth Montagu expressed anxiety about the supposed provinciality of Charlotte&#x27;s upbringing. Her parents hired notable individuals to tutor their children, among them Gottlob Burchard Genzmer and Friderike Elisabeth von Grabow, known as &quot;the female sappho.&quot; Charlotte received instruction in literature, botany, natural history, and languages including French, Italian, and Latin. She was also taught traditional pursuits for upper-class girls, including embroidery, dancing, singing, household management and religionthe latter taught by a priest. Charlotte was also taught to play the harpsichord by composer Johann Georg Linike. The family lived a modest life at Mirow; only after her brother Adolphus Frederick succeeded to the ducal throne, in 1752, did Charlotte gain any experience of princely duties and of court life.

==Marriage==

When George III succeeded to the throne of Great Britain upon the death of his grandfather, George II, he was 22 years old and unmarried. His mother, Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, and his advisors were eager to have him settled in marriage.

Charlotte was not originally considered as a potential bride, but the Hanoverian Minister in London, Baron Philip Adolphus von Münchausen, suggested her as a candidate, likely due to the positive relations between Hanover and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The 17-year-old Charlotte appealed as a prospective consort partly because she had been brought up in an insignificant north German duchy and, therefore, would probably have had no experience or interest in power politics or party intrigues. That proved to be the case; to make sure, George III instructed her shortly after their wedding &quot;not to meddle&quot;, a precept she dutifully followed.

The King announced to his Council in July 1761, according to the usual form, his intention to wed the Princess, after which a party of escorts, led by the Earl Harcourt, departed for Germany to bring Princess Charlotte to England. They reached Strelitz on 14 August 1761, and were received the next day by Duke Adolphus Frederick IV, Charlotte&#x27;s brother, at which time the marriage contract was signed by him on the one hand and Lord Harcourt on the other. Tragically, Charlotte&#x27;s mother had died on 29 June, after giving encouragement to the betrothal following a correspondence with George III&#x27;s mother, Princess Augusta.

Three days of public celebrations followed, and on 17 August 1761, Charlotte set out for Britain, accompanied by Adolphus Frederick and the British escort party, among them one of Charlotte&#x27;s new Ladies of the Bedchamber, Elizabeth Hamilton, 1st Baroness Hamilton of Hameldon. On 22 August, they reached Cuxhaven, where a small fleet awaited to convey them to England. The voyage was extremely difficult; the party encountered three storms at sea and landed at Harwich only on 7 September. They set out at once for London, spent that night in Witham, at the residence of Lord Abercorn, and arrived at 3:30 pm the next day at St. James&#x27;s Palace in London. They were received by the King and his family at the garden gate, which marked the first meeting of the bride and groom.

At 9:00 pm that same evening (8 September 1761), within six hours of her arrival, Charlotte was married to George III. The ceremony was performed at the Chapel Royal, St. James&#x27;s Palace, by the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Secker. Only the royal family, the party who had travelled from Germany, and a handful of guests were present. George III and Charlotte&#x27;s coronation was held at Westminster Abbey a fortnight later on 22 September, after a brief honeymoon at Richmond Lodge.

==Queen consort==

Upon her wedding day, Charlotte spoke little English. However, she quickly learned the language, albeit speaking with a strong German accent. One observer commented, &quot;She is timid at first but talks a lot, when she is among people she knows.&quot;
Less than a year after the marriage, on 12 August 1762, the Queen gave birth to her first child, George, Prince of Wales. In the course of their marriage, the couple became the parents of 15 children, all but two of whom (Octavius and Alfred) survived into adulthood.

St James&#x27;s Palace functioned as the official residence of the royal couple, but the King had recently purchased a nearby property, Buckingham House, located at the western end of St James&#x27;s Park. More private and compact, the new property stood amid rolling parkland not far from St James&#x27;s Palace. Around 1762, the King and Queen moved to this residence, which was originally intended as a private retreat. The Queen came to favour this residence, spending so much of her time there that it came to be known as The Queen&#x27;s House. Indeed, in 1775, an Act of Parliament settled the property on Queen Charlotte in exchange for her rights to Somerset House. Most of the couple&#x27;s 15 children were born in Buckingham House, although St James&#x27;s Palace remained the official and ceremonial royal residence.

During her first years in Great Britain, Charlotte&#x27;s strained relationship with her mother-in-law, Augusta, caused her difficulty in adapting to the life of the British court. Augusta interfered with Charlotte&#x27;s efforts to establish social contacts by insisting on rigid court etiquette. Furthermore, Augusta appointed many of Charlotte&#x27;s staff, among whom several were expected to report to Augusta about Charlotte&#x27;s behaviour. Charlotte turned to her German companions for friends, notably her close confidante Juliane von Schwellenberg. Charlotte&#x27;s personal correspondence with her brother Charles II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. revealed the depth of her loneliness and of her frustration with the regulations of royal life.

The King enjoyed country pursuits and riding and preferred to keep his family&#x27;s residence as much as possible in the then rural towns of Kew and Richmond. He favoured an informal and relaxed domestic life, to the dismay of some courtiers more accustomed to displays of grandeur and strict protocol. Lady Mary Coke was indignant on hearing, in July 1769, that the King, the Queen, her visiting brother Prince Ernest and Lady Effingham had gone for a walk through Richmond by themselves without any servants: &quot;I am not satisfied in my mind about the propriety of a Queen walking in town unattended.&quot;

From 1778, the royal family spent much of their time at a newly constructed residence, the Queen&#x27;s Lodge at Windsor, opposite Windsor Castle, in Windsor Great Park, where the King enjoyed hunting deer. The Queen was responsible for the interior decoration of their new residence, described by a friend of the royal family and diarist Mary Delany: &quot;The entrance into the first room was dazzling, all furnished with beautiful Indian paper, chairs covered with different embroideries of the liveliest colours, glasses, tables, sconces, in the best taste, the whole calculated to give the greatest cheerfulness to the place.&quot;

Charlotte treated her children&#x27;s attendants with friendly warmth which is reflected in this note she wrote to her daughters&#x27; assistant governess, Mary Hamilton:
My dear Miss Hamilton, What can I have to say? Not much indeed! But to wish you a good morning, in the pretty blue and white room where I had the pleasure to sit and read with you &quot;The Hermit&quot;, a poem which is such a favourite with me that I have read it twice this summer. Oh! What a blessing to keep good company! Very likely I should not have been acquainted with either poet or poem was it not for you.

Charlotte did have some influence on political affairs through the King. Her influence was discreet and indirect, as demonstrated in the correspondence with her brother Charles. She used her closeness with George III to keep herself informed and to make recommendations for offices. Apparently her recommendations were not direct, as she on one occasion, in 1779, asked her brother Charles to burn her letter, because the King suspected that a person she had recently recommended for a post was the client of a woman who sold offices. Charlotte particularly interested herself in German issues. She took an interest in the War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–1779), and it is possible that it was due to her efforts that the King supported British intervention in the continuing conflict between Joseph II and Charles Theodore of Bavaria in 1785.

==Husband&#x27;s first period of illness==

Some contemporaries, including Charlotte Papendiek, one of Charlotte&#x27;s attendants, believed that George III first suffered from mental illness in 1765. However, the royal governess, Lady Charlotte Finch recorded that the king was merely ill with a fever; unlike Mrs Papendiek, who was in July 1765, Lady Charlotte was present in the royal household at the time. Mrs Papendiek claimed in her memoirs that Princess Augusta tried to keep Charlotte unaware of the situation in order to establish herself as regent. The Regency Bill of 1765 stated that if the King should become permanently unable to rule, Charlotte was to act as regent until the Prince of Wales came of age. 

George III&#x27;s bout of physical and mental illness started in October 1788 and lasted until March 1789. Charlotte was deeply distressed by the change in her husband&#x27;s behaviour. The writer Frances Burney, at that time one of the Queen&#x27;s attendants, overheard her moaning to herself with &quot;desponding sound&quot;: &quot;What will become of me? What will become of me?&quot; When the King collapsed one night, she refused to be left alone with him and successfully insisted that she be given her own bedroom. When the doctor, Richard Warren, was called, she was not informed and was not given the opportunity to speak with him about it. When told by the Prince of Wales that the King was to be removed to Kew, but that she should move to Queen&#x27;s House or to Windsor, she successfully insisted that she accompany her spouse to Kew, telling her son &quot;Where the king is, &quot;there I shall be&quot;.&quot; However, she and her daughters were taken to Kew separately from the King and lived secluded from him during his illness. They regularly visited him, but the visits tended to be uncomfortable, as he had a tendency to embrace them and refuse to let them go.

During the 1788 illness of the King, a conflict arose between the Queen and the Prince of Wales, who suspected one another of desiring to assume the regency should the illness of the King become permanent, resulting in him being declared unfit to rule. Charlotte suspected her son of a plan to have the King declared insane with the assistance of Doctor Warren, and to take over the regency. Prince George&#x27;s followers, notably Sir Gilbert Ellis, in turn suspected the Queen of a plan to have the King declared sane with the assistance of Doctor Francis Willis and Prime Minister William Pitt, so that he could have her appointed regent should he fall ill again, and then have him declared insane again and assume the regency. According to Doctor Warren, Doctor Willis had pressed him to declare the King sane on the orders of the Queen.
In the Regency Bill of 1789, the Prince of Wales was declared regent should the King become permanently insane, but it also placed the King himself, his court and minor children under the Queen&#x27;s guardianship. The conflict around the regency led to serious discord between the Prince of Wales and his mother. In an argument he accused her of having sided with his enemies, while she called him the enemy of the King. Their conflict became public when she refused to invite him to the concert held in celebration of the recovery of the King, which created a scandal. During this period, Queen Charlotte was caricatured in satirical prints which depicted her as an unnatural mother and a creature of the Prime Minister. In January 1789 &quot;The Times&quot; accused the Opposition of beginning &quot;a most scurrilous attack on the queen, not only by private conversation, but through the medium of the prints in their interest&quot;. Queen Charlotte and the Prince of Wales finally reconciled, on her initiative, in March 1791.

As a result of the king&#x27;s illness in 1788-89 and of the public attacks on her character, the Queen&#x27;s personality altered: she developed a terrible temper and no longer enjoyed appearing in public, not even at the musical concerts she had so loved; and her relationships with her adult children became strained. From 1792 she found some relief from her worry about her husband by planning the gardens and decoration of a new residence for herself, Frogmore House, in Windsor Home Park.

When the king&#x27;s mental health declined again in 1804, it caused a serious rupture in the royal marriage. Despite the entreaties of her daughters and of the king&#x27;s physicians, Queen Charlotte slept in a separate bedroom, had her meals separate from the king, and avoided spending time alone with him. 

==Interests and patronage==

Charlotte and her husband were music connoisseurs with German tastes, who gave special honour to German artists and composers. They were passionate admirers of the music of George Frideric Handel.

In April 1764, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, then aged eight, arrived in Britain with his family as part of their grand tour of Europe and remained until July 1765. The Mozarts were summoned to court on 19 May and played before a limited circle from six to ten o&#x27;clock. Johann Christian Bach, eleventh son of the great Johann Sebastian Bach, was then music-master to the Queen. He put difficult works of Handel, J. S. Bach, and Carl Friedrich Abel before the boy: he played them all at sight, to the amazement of those present. Afterwards, the young Mozart accompanied the Queen in an aria which she sang, and played a solo work on the flute. On 29 October, the Mozarts were in London again, and were invited to court to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the King&#x27;s accession. As a memento of the royal favour, Leopold Mozart published six sonatas composed by Wolfgang, known as Mozart&#x27;s Opus 3, that were dedicated to the Queen on 18 January 1765, a dedication she rewarded with a present of 50 guineas.

Queen Charlotte was an amateur botanist who took a great interest in Kew Gardens. In an age of discovery, when such travellers and explorers as Captain James Cook and Sir Joseph Banks were constantly bringing home new species and varieties of plants, she ensured that the collections were greatly enriched and expanded. Her interest in botany led to the South African flower, the bird of paradise, being named &quot;Strelitzia reginae&quot; in her honour.

Queen Charlotte has also been credited with introducing the Christmas tree to Britain and its colonies. Initially, Charlotte decorated a single yew branch, a common Christmas tradition in her native Mecklenburg-Strelitz, to celebrate Christmas with members of the royal family and the royal household. She decorated the branch with the assistance of her ladies-in-waiting and then had the court gather to sing carols and distribute gifts. In December 1800, Queen Charlotte set up the first known English Christmas tree at Queen&#x27;s Lodge, Windsor. That year, she held a large Christmas party for the children of all the families in Windsor and placed a whole tree in the drawing-room, decorated with tinsel, glass, baubles and fruits. John Watkins, who attended the Christmas party, described the tree in his biography of the Queen: &quot;from the branches of which hung bunches of sweetmeats, almonds and raisins in papers, fruits and toys, most tastefully arranged; the whole illuminated by small wax candles. After the company had walked round and admired the tree, each child obtained a portion of the sweets it bore, together with a toy, and then all returned home quite delighted.&quot; The practice of decorating a tree became popular among the British nobility and gentry, and later spread to the colonies.

Among the royal couple&#x27;s favoured craftsmen and artists were the cabinetmaker William Vile, silversmith Thomas Heming, the landscape designer Capability Brown, and the German painter Johann Zoffany, who frequently painted the King and Queen and their children in charmingly informal scenes, such as a portrait of Queen Charlotte and her children as she sat at her dressing table. In 1788, the royal couple visited the Worcester Porcelain Factory (founded in 1751, and later to be known as Royal Worcester), where Queen Charlotte ordered a porcelain service that was later renamed &quot;Royal Lily&quot; in her honour. Another well-known porcelain service designed and named in her honour was the &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; pattern.

The Queen founded orphanages and, in 1809, became the patron (providing new funding) of the General Lying-in Hospital, a hospital for expectant mothers. It was subsequently renamed as the Queen&#x27;s Hospital, and is today the Queen Charlotte&#x27;s and Chelsea Hospital.

Up until 1788, portraits of Charlotte often depict her in maternal poses with her children, and she looks young and contented; however, that year, her husband fell seriously ill and became temporarily insane. It is now thought that the King had porphyria, though bipolar disorder has also been named as another possible underlying cause for his condition. Sir Thomas Lawrence&#x27;s portrait of Charlotte at this time marks a transition point, after which she looks much older in her portraits; the assistant keeper of Charlotte&#x27;s wardrobe, Charlotte Papendiek, wrote that the Queen was &quot;much changed, her hair quite grey&quot;.

==Friendship with Marie Antoinette==
The French Revolution of 1789 probably added to the strain that Charlotte felt. She had maintained a close relationship with Queen Marie Antoinette of France. Charlotte was 11 years older than Marie Antoinette, yet they shared many interests, such as their love of music and the arts, about which they were both enthusiastic. Never meeting face to face, they confined their friendship to pen and paper. Marie Antoinette confided in Charlotte upon the outbreak of the French Revolution. Charlotte had organized apartments to be prepared and ready for the refugee royal family of France to occupy.
She was greatly distraught when she heard the news that the King and Queen of France had been executed.

==During the Regency==

After the onset of his permanent madness in 1811, George III was placed under the guardianship of his wife in accordance with the Regency Bill of 1789.
She could not bring herself to visit him very often, due to his erratic behaviour and occasional violent reactions. It is believed she did not visit him again after June 1812. However, Charlotte remained supportive of her spouse as his illness worsened in old age. While her son, the Prince Regent, wielded the royal power, she was her spouse&#x27;s legal guardian from 1811 until her death in 1818. Due to the extent of the King&#x27;s illness, he was incapable of knowing or understanding that she had died.

During the Regency of her son, Queen Charlotte continued to fill her role as first lady in royal representation because of the estrangement of the Prince Regent and his spouse. As such, she functioned as the hostess by the side of her son at official receptions, such as the festivities given in London to celebrate the defeat of Emperor Napoleon in 1814. She also supervised the upbringing of her granddaughter, Princess Charlotte of Wales.
During her last years, she was met with a growing lack of popularity and was sometimes subjected to demonstrations. After having attended a reception in London on 29 April 1817, she was jeered by a crowd. She told the crowd that it was upsetting to be treated like that after such long service.

==Death==

The Queen died in the presence of her eldest son, the Prince Regent, who was holding her hand as she sat in an armchair at the family&#x27;s country retreat, Dutch House in Surrey (now known as Kew Palace). She was buried at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. Her husband died just over a year later. She is the longest-serving female consort and second-longest-serving consort in British history (after Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh), having served as such from her marriage (on 8 September 1761) to her death (17 November 1818), a total of 57 years and 70 days.

On the day before her death, the Queen dictated her will to her husband&#x27;s secretary, Sir Herbert Taylor, appointing him and Lord Arden as her executors; at her death, her personal estate was valued at less than £140,000 (), with her jewels accounting for the greater portion of her assets. In her will, proven at Doctor&#x27;s Commons on 8 January 1819, the Queen bequeathed her husband the jewels she had received from him, unless he remained in his state of insanity, in which case the jewels were to become an heirloom of the House of Hanover. Other jewels, including some gifted to Charlotte by the Nawab of Arcot, were to be evenly distributed among her surviving daughters. The furnishings and fixtures at the royal residence at Frogmore, along with &quot;live and dead stock...on the estates&quot;, were bequeathed to her daughter Augusta Sophia along with the Frogmore property, unless its maintenance would prove too expensive for her daughter, in which case it was to revert to the Crown. Her daughter Sophia inherited the Royal Lodge. Certain personal assets that the Queen had brought from Mecklenburg-Strelitz were to revert to the senior branch of that dynasty, while the remainder of her assets, including her books, linen, art objects and china, were to be evenly divided among her surviving daughters.

At the Queen&#x27;s death, the Prince Regent claimed Charlotte&#x27;s jewels, and on his death, they were in turn claimed by his heir, William IV. On William&#x27;s death, Charlotte&#x27;s bequest then sparked a protracted dispute between her granddaughter Queen Victoria, who claimed the jewels as the property of the British Crown, and Charlotte&#x27;s now eldest-surviving son Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover, who claimed the jewels by right of being the most senior male member of the House of Hanover. The dispute would not be resolved in Ernest&#x27;s lifetime. Eventually in 1858, over twenty years after the death of William IV and nearly forty years after Charlotte&#x27;s death, the matter was decided in favour of Ernest&#x27;s son George, upon which Victoria had the jewels given into the custody of the Hanoverian ambassador.

The rest of Charlotte&#x27;s property was sold at auction from May to August 1819. Her clothes, furniture, and even her snuff were sold by Christie&#x27;s. It is highly unlikely that her husband ever knew of her death; he died blind, deaf, lame and insane 14 months later.

==Legacy==

Places named after Charlotte include the Queen Charlotte Islands (now known as &quot;Haida Gwaii&quot;) in British Columbia, Canada, and Queen Charlotte City (now known as &quot;Daajing Giids&quot;) on Haida Gwaii; Queen Charlotte Sound (not far from the Haida Gwaii Islands); Queen Charlotte Channel (near Vancouver, Canada); Queen Charlotte Bay in West Falkland; Queen Charlotte Sound, South Island, New Zealand; several fortifications, including Fort Charlotte, Saint Vincent; Charlottesville, Virginia; Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island; Charlotte, North Carolina; Mecklenburg County, North Carolina; Mecklenburg County, Virginia; Charlotte County, Virginia; Charlotte County, Florida; Port Charlotte, Florida; Charlotte Harbor, Florida; and Charlotte, Vermont. The proposed North American colonies of Vandalia and Charlotina were also named for her. In Tonga, the royal family adopted the name Sālote (the Tongan version of Charlotte) in her honour, and notable individuals included Sālote Lupepauʻu and Sālote Tupou III.

Charlotte&#x27;s provision of funding to the General Lying-in Hospital in London prevented its closure; today it is named Queen Charlotte&#x27;s and Chelsea Hospital, and is an acknowledged centre of excellence amongst maternity hospitals. A large copy of the Allan Ramsay portrait of Queen Charlotte hangs in the main lobby of the hospital. The Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Ball, an annual debutante ball that originally funded the hospital, is named after her.

A lead statue probably of Queen Charlotte, dating to , stands on Queen Square in Bloomsbury, London, and there are two statues of her in Charlotte, North Carolina: at Charlotte Douglas International Airport and at the International Trade Center.

Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, was chartered in 1766 as &quot;Queen&#x27;s College&quot;, in reference to Queen Charlotte. It was renamed in 1825 in honour of Henry Rutgers, a Revolutionary War officer and college benefactor. Its oldest extant building, Old Queen&#x27;s (built 1809–1823), and the city block that forms the historic core of the university, Queen&#x27;s Campus, retain their original names.

Queen Charlotte was played by Frances White in the 1979 television series &quot;Prince Regent&quot;, by Helen Mirren in the 1994 film &quot;The Madness of King George&quot;, by Golda Rosheuvel in the 2020 Netflix original series &quot;Bridgerton&quot;, and by India Amarteifio in her younger years and Rosheuvel, in her older years, in &quot;Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story&quot;.

&quot;Strelitzia&quot;, a genus of flowering plants native to South Africa that has become ubiquitous in warm-weather regions worldwide, is named for Charlotte&#x27;s native Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

==Arms==
The royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom are impaled with her father&#x27;s arms as a Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The arms were: Quarterly of six, 1st, Or, a buffalo&#x27;s head cabossed Sable, armed and ringed Argent, crowned and langued Gules (Mecklenburg); 2nd, Azure, a griffin segreant Or (Rostock); 3rd, Per fess, in chief Azure, a griffin segreant Or, and in the base Vert, a bordure Argent (Principality of Schwerin); 4th, Gules, a cross patée Argent crowned Or (Ratzeburg); 5th, Gules, a dexter arm Argent issuant from clouds in sinister flank and holding a finger ring Or (County of Schwerin); 6th, Or, a buffalo&#x27;s head Sable, armed Argent, crowned and langued Gules (Wenden); Overall an inescutcheon, per fess Gules and Or (Stargard).

The Queen&#x27;s arms changed twice to mirror the changes in her husband&#x27;s arms, once in 1801 and then again in 1816. A funerary hatchment displaying the Queen&#x27;s full coat of arms, painted in 1818, is on display at Kew Palace.

==Issue==


==Ancestry==
Claims that Queen Charlotte may have had partial African ancestry first emerged in &quot;Racial Mixture as the Basic Principle of Life&quot; published in 1929 by German historian, Brunold Springer, who challenged her Thomas Gainsborough portrait as inaccurate. Based on her alternative portrait by Allan Ramsay and contemporary descriptions of her appearance, Springer concluded that Charlotte&#x27;s &quot;broad nostrils and heavy lips&quot; must point to African heritage. Jamaican-American amateur historian J. A. Rogers agreed with Springer in his 1940 book &quot;Sex and Race: Volume I&quot;, where he concluded that Queen Charlotte must be &quot;biracial&quot; or &quot;black&quot;.

Proponents of the African ancestry claim also hold to a literal interpretation of Baron Stockmar&#x27;s diary, in which he described Charlotte as &quot;small and crooked, with a real Mulatto face&quot;. Stockmar, who served as personal physician to the Queen&#x27;s grandson-in-law Leopold I of Belgium, arrived at court just two years before Charlotte&#x27;s death in 1816. His descriptions of Charlotte&#x27;s children in this same diary are equally unflattering.

In 1997, Mario de Valdes y Cocom, a genealogist and self-described &quot;independent researcher&quot;, popularized and expanded on earlier arguments in an article for PBS &quot;Frontline&quot;, which has since been cited as the main source by a number of articles on the topic. Valdes also seized on Charlotte&#x27;s 1761 Allan Ramsay portrait as evidence of African ancestry, citing the Queen&#x27;s &quot;unmistakable African appearance&quot; and &quot;negroid physiogomy&quot; . Valdes claimed that Charlotte had inherited these features from one of her distant ancestors, Madragana (born ), a mistress of King Afonso III of Portugal ( – 1279). His conclusion is based on various historical sources that describe Madragana as either Moorish or Mozarab, which Valdes erroneously interpreted to mean that she was black.

Although popular among the general public, the claims are rejected by most scholars. Aside from Stockmar&#x27;s jab at her appearance shortly before her death, Charlotte was never referred to as having any specifically African physical features, let alone ancestry, during her lifetime. Furthermore, her portraiture was not atypical for her time, and painted portraits in general should not be considered reliable evidence of a sitter&#x27;s true appearance. The use of the term &quot;Moor&quot; as a racial identifier for Charlotte&#x27;s ancestor Madragana is also inconclusive as during the Middle Ages the term was not used to describe race but religious affiliation. Regardless, Madragana was more likely an Iberian Mozarab, and any genetic contribution from an ancestor fifteen generations removed would be so diluted as to have a negligible effect on her appearance. Historian Andrew Roberts describes the claims as &quot;utter rubbish&quot;, and attributes its public popularity to a hesitancy among historians to openly address it due to its &quot;cultural cringe factor&quot;.

In 2017, following the announcement of the engagement of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, a number of news articles were published promoting the claims. David Buck, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson, was quoted by the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; as saying: &quot;This has been rumoured for years and years. It is a matter of history, and frankly, we&#x27;ve got far more important things to talk about.&quot; In the 2023 Netflix series &quot;Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story&quot;, India Amarteifio was cast as a mixed-race Charlotte.

<text>Mary Anne Clarke (born Mary Anne Thompson; 3 April 1776 – 21 June 1852) was the mistress of Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. Their relationship began in 1803, while he was Commander-in-Chief of the army. Later in 1809, she wrote her memoirs which were published. She was the subject of a portrait by Adam Buck, and a caricature by Isaac Cruikshank; ten days after the latter&#x27;s publication, the Duke resigned from his post as Commander of the British Army. In 1811, she commissioned Irish sculptor Lawrence Gahagan to sculpt a marble bust of her; this is now housed in the National Portrait Gallery, London.

Through her daughter Ellen, who married Louis-Mathurin Busson du Maurier, Clarke was a great-great-grandmother of author Daphne du Maurier, who wrote the novel &quot;Mary Anne&quot; about her life.

==Life as a courtesan==

Mary Anne Thompson was born on 3 April 1776 in London, the daughter of a humble tradesman. Attractive and intelligent, she was married before the age of 18, to a man named Clarke, who worked as a stonemason. However, shortly after the marriage, her husband went bankrupt, and Mary Anne Clarke left him because of this. 
By 1803, Clarke had been established long enough in the world of courtesans to receive the attention of Prince Frederick, Duke of York, then the commander-in-chief of the army.

Taking her as his mistress, he set her up in a fashionable residence in Gloucester Place in Marylebone. However, he failed to supply the funds necessary to support their lavish lifestyle. In 1809, a national scandal arose when Clarke testified before the House of Commons that she had sold army commissions with the Duke of York&#x27;s knowledge.

The scandal was the subject of much humour and mockery, especially by caricaturists such as Isaac Cruikshank who created multiple graphics making fun of the scandal. Cruikshank combined mockery of the scandal while also satirizing Napoleon, portraying him and his generals reading four of his caricatures of the Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany and Mary.

Frederick was forced to resign from his position, though he was later reinstated.

After the Duke of York resigned his post as Commander in Chief of the Army, and before he was later reinstated, he cut all ties to Clarke, paying her a considerable sum to prevent her from publishing letters he had written to her during their relationship. When the scandal forced Clarke to leave London, she took a tenancy of Loughton Lodge, Loughton, Essex. This house still exists, and a blue plaque to Mary Anne Clarke was unveiled on it in April 2009. There are in fact two blue plaques, one on the front, and a duplicate on the back elevation.

Clarke was prosecuted for libel in 1813 and imprisoned for nine months. On her release from prison, she went to live in France. She died in Boulogne-sur-Mer on 21 June 1852.

== Legacy and writings ==

Her daughter, Ellen, born of her marriage to Clarke, married Louis-Mathurin Busson du Maurier, and was the mother of the caricaturist George du Maurier (1834–96) and the great-grandmother of the novelist Daphne du Maurier (1907–1989), who wrote a book about her, &quot;Mary Anne&quot;.

Writings by Mary Anne Clarke include the following:

<doc id="209361" wikidata="Q780869" url="?curid=209361" title="St. James Infirmary Blues">
<text>&quot;St. James Infirmary&quot; is an American blues and jazz standard that emerged, like many others, from folk traditions. Louis Armstrong brought the song to lasting fame through his 1928 recording, on which Don Redman is named as composer; later releases credit &quot;Joe Primrose&quot;, a pseudonym used by musician manager, music promoter and publisher Irving Mills. The melody is eight bars long, unlike songs in the classic blues genre, where there are 12 bars. It is in a minor key, and has a time signature, but has also been played in .

==20th century authorship history==
The perennially popular song known today as &quot;St. James Infirmary&quot; (also known as &quot;Gambler&#x27;s Blues&quot;) originated as an American folk song.

* Carl Moore and Phil Baxter published copyrighted sheet music for the song, entitled &quot;Gambler&#x27;s Blues&quot;, under Baxter&#x27;s own imprint and through Harry D. Squires, Inc. in 1925.
* Poet Carl Sandburg&#x27;s renowned 1927 compilation of folksongs he had collected across the country over the previous 20 years,&quot;The American Songbag,&quot; included lyrics and music notation for the two principal versions of the song later popularized, the song therein called &quot;Those Gambler&#x27;s Blues&quot;. 
* In 1927, Fess Williams and his Royal Flush Orchestra released the first recording of the song under the title &quot;Gambler&#x27;s Blues&quot;, crediting Moore and Baxter.
* Louis Armstrong and his Savoy Ballroom Five recorded the song in December 1928. Okeh Records released Armstrong&#x27;s recording, entitled &quot;St. James Infirmary&quot;, crediting the composition solely to noted jazzman Don Redman, who had joined Armstrong&#x27;s band for this session. Nonetheless, the second and subsequent releases of this recording credited the composition to one Joe Primrose.
* Beginning in 1929, Mills Music, Inc. published, advertised and promoted the sheet music for its arrangement of the song under the title &quot;St. James&#x27; Infirmary&quot;, crediting its composition to Irving Mills&#x27;s &quot;nom de plume&quot;, &quot;Joe Primrose&quot;. Despite losing a New York State unfair competition lawsuit it brought against a rival music publisher on appeal, Mills Music somehow retained effective control over rights to the song, thereby profiting from it for decades, as though the song had not been in the public domain.

== Recording history ==
The tune first appears as &quot;Charleston Cabin&quot;, on a 1924 disc by The California Ramblers, in which it is intermixed with another tune reminiscent of &quot;Swannee River&quot;, suggesting a possible inspiration.

In 1927, Fess Williams and his Royal Flush Orchestra became the first to record the song (under the name &quot;Gambler&#x27;s Blues&quot;) crediting Carl Moore and Phil Baxter. As &quot;St. James&#x27; Infirmary&quot;, the song became all the more popular after Armstrong&#x27;s recording and the promotional efforts of Mills Music, Inc. By 1930 at least twenty different recordings had been released, many of the early hit recordings were by clients of Mills Artists, Inc. The Duke Ellington Orchestra recorded the song multiple times under names like &quot;The Ten Black Berries&quot;, &quot;The Harlem Hot Chocolates&quot;, and &quot;The Jungle Band&quot;. In 1933, Cab Calloway&#x27;s version anchored a classic Betty Boop cartoon and his instrumental version introduced another that featured Calloway&#x27;s related hit song, &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;. Irving Mills managed the careers of both Calloway and Ellington, and Mills Music published them both.

The country music singer Jimmie Rodgers recorded the song in 1930 (as &quot;Those Gambler&#x27;s Blues&quot;). In 1932 Rodgers recorded &quot;Gambling Bar Room Blues&quot;, co-written with Shelly Lee Alley, with a similar melody but new lyrics and themes of alcohol abuse, violence and despair. Cajun string band the Dixie Ramblers recorded &quot;Barroom Blues&quot; in 1935, with lyrics largely matching Rodgers&#x27; &quot;Those Gambler&#x27;s Blues&quot;.

In 1961, Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland released a version of &quot;Saint James Infirmary&quot; on the flip side of his No. 2 R&amp;B hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry No More&quot; and included it in his album &quot;Two Steps from the Blues&quot;. In 1967, the French-American singer Joe Dassin recorded the song. In 1968, Don Partridge released a version on his self-named album, as did Eric Burdon and the Animals on their album &quot;Every One of Us&quot;. Dock Boggs recorded a version of the song entitled &quot;Old Joe&#x27;s Barroom&quot; (1965).

More recently, the song has been performed by cabaret surrealists The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo in Southern California; the band&#x27;s vocalist and songwriter, Danny Elfman, citing Cab Calloway as his inspiration. The White Stripes included the song on their self-titled debut album; the White&#x27;s first encounter with the song having been the Betty Boop cartoon. In 2012, Trombone Shorty and Booker T. Jones performed the song (with musical references to &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;) for President Obama and guests at the White House &quot;Red, White, and Blues&quot; concert.

== Lyrical variations ==
There are over twenty versions of the lyrics, but most fall broadly into under the versions identified by Sandburg as A and B. The Louis Armstrong on a 1928 Okeh Records release is the exemplar of the shorter, A version: &lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:24px;&quot;&gt;
I went down to St. James Infirmary,
Saw my baby there,
Stretched out on a long white table,
So cold, so sweet, so fair.
Let her go, let her go, God bless her,
Wherever she may be,
She can look this wide world over,
But she&#x27;ll never find a sweet man like me.
&lt;/poem&gt;The B-type versions, including Moore &amp; Baxter&#x27;s &quot;Gambler&#x27;s Blues&quot;, begin and end with a framing backstory, in which a narrator encounters a patron of &quot;Joe&#x27;s bar room&quot;, named Joe McKinney, or similar, and tells the song&#x27;s story in the very words he said, with the song ending back in the bar room, drinking another shot of booze.

The hallmark of nearly all the variants is the uncanny pivot from the visitor initially mourning his deceased victim, to boasts about himself and how she&#x27;ll miss him, to instructions for his own grand funeral:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:24px;&quot;&gt;
Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She can search this world wide over
But she&#x27;ll never find a sweet man like me.
When I die, bury me in straight-lace shoes,
I want a box-back coat and a Stetson hat.
Put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain,
So the boys&#x27;ll know that I died standin&#x27; pat.
&lt;/poem&gt;Many versions include additional funeral instructions: 
&lt;poem&gt;Sixteen coal-black horses,
All hitch to a rubber-tired hack,
Carried seven girls to the graveyard,
And only six of &#x27;em coming&#x27; back.
Six crap shooters as pall bearers
Let a chorus girl sing me a song
With a jazz band on my hearse
To raise hell as we go along.&lt;/poem&gt;
The funeral instructions echo some verses characteristic of &quot;The Unfortunate Rake&quot; song cycle. Blind Willie McTell&#x27;s &quot;Dying Crapshooter&#x27;s Blues&quot;, contains parallel verses as well. Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1981 homage, &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot;, contained musical references to both &quot;Dyin&#x27; Crapshooter&#x27;s Blues&quot; and &quot;St. James Infirmary&quot;.

== Theories about historical sources ==
Like many traditional songs, this one represents a confluence of many sources. Different commentators have differing view of the importance of their respective contributions to the song we know today.

Some, following A.L. Lloyd, attempt to connect the St. James Infirmary an 18th-century folk song, known by many names, including &quot;The Unfortunate Rake&quot;, although their theme, music and lyrics bear little resemblance to St. James&#x27; Infirmary at all. The Rake is about a soldier dying in the hospital from a venereal disease. The earliest known form of this song was called &quot;The Buck&#x27;s Elegy&quot; and is set in Covent Garden, London. This song is known as &quot;The Unfortunate Lad&quot;, &quot;The Young Man Cut Down in His Prime&quot;, and &quot;the Buck&#x27;s Elegy&quot;,

According to Robert W. Harwood, who rejects Lloyd&#x27;s conclusions, A. L. Lloyd was the first to attempt to connect &quot;St. James Infirmary&quot; with &quot;The Unfortunate Lad/Rake&quot;. Harwood points to Lloyd&#x27;s 1947 article in English music magazine &quot;Keynote&quot;. and his 1956 revisionpublished article in &quot;Sing&quot; magazine. In both articles Lloyd refers to an English broadside song entitled &quot;The Unfortunate Lad&quot;, commenting that the song is sometimes known as &quot;The Unfortunate Rake&quot;, but with no date or source for the latter title given. The opening line of this version of the song refers to a &quot;lock hospital&quot;, with no mention of St. James. The term &quot;lock hospital&quot; was the name of an institution in Southwark, London, where lepers were isolated and treated. The term &quot;lock hospital&quot; referred to a facility in which first lepers and later people suffering from venereal disease were isolated and confined.

Lloyd deems a song collected by Cecil Sharp in the Appalachians in 1918 which references a &quot;St. James Hospital&quot; to be the parent song of both St. James Infirmary and the Streets of Laredo&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Dying Cowboy&quot;). The opening of that song, as quoted by Lloyd, is:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:24px;&quot;&gt;
As I went down by St James Hospital one morning,
So early one morning, it was early one day,
I found my son, my own son,
Wrapped up in white linen, as cold as the clay.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Lloyd traces this Appalachian song to a &quot;The Unfortunate Lad&quot;, published by Such in London in the 1850s, a song about a &quot;lock hospital&quot;:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:24px;&quot;&gt;
As I was walking down by the Lock Hospital,
As I was walking one morning of late,
Who did I spy but my own dear comrade,
Wrapp&#x27;d up in flannel, so hard was his fate.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Lloyd asserts that St. James Infirmary is, or was before it became corrupted, a narrative ballad. Such ballads are rare in Negro song... So doubts are raised about whether &#x27;St. James Infirmary&#x27; began life as a Negro song.&quot; The second article includes the following comment on the song: &quot;Most versions of &#x27;Infirmary&#x27; include a number of stanzas from other songs, grafted on to the main stem – a confusion especially common with songs current among Negroes. The curious switchover from the actual death of the girl to the hypothetical death of the gambler creates some ambiguity too.&quot; Lloyd notes that in some early variants of &quot;The Unfortunate Rake&quot;, the sex of the victim of venereal disease was female. &quot;We realize that the confusion in the &#x27;Infirmary&#x27;, where the dead person is a woman but the funeral is ordered for a man, is surely due to the fact that the original ballad was commonly recorded in a form in which the sexes were reversed, so singers were often in two minds whether they were singing of a rakish man or a bad girl.&quot;

Lloyd&#x27;s second article is cited as a reference by Kenneth Goldstein in his liner notes for a 1960 Folkways LP called &quot;The Unfortunate Rake&quot;. These liner notes are often used as a source for the history of &quot;St. James Infirmary Blues&quot;. One example is an article byThe liner notes raise the question of whether St. James&#x27; Hospital was a real place and, if so, where it was. Goldstein claimed in the notes that &quot;St. James&quot; refers to London&#x27;s St. James&#x27; Hospital, a religious foundation for the treatment of leprosy. His references list an article by Kenneth Lodewick. That article states, giving no reference or source for the idea, that the phrase &quot;St. James Hospital&quot; refers to a hospital of that name in London. There is some difficulty in this because the hospital in question closed in 1532 when Henry VIII acquired the land to build St James&#x27;s Palace.

Another possibility suggested by Higginbotham on the basis of his claim that the song &quot;St. James Infirmary&quot; dates at least from the early nineteenth century is the Infirmary section of the St James Workhouse which the St. James Parish opened in 1725 on Poland Street, Soho, and which continued well into the nineteenth century. This St. James Infirmary was contemporaneous with the estimated advent of the song &quot;The Unfortunate Lad&quot;, but it is not the London Lock Hospital. Another difficulty is that, out of the early versions of the song mentioned in the references given by Goldstein, only the one collected by Cecil Sharp in the Appalachians in 1918, and one found in Canada in the 1920s, make use of the phrase &quot;St. James&quot;.

The liner notes link the Rake to an early fragment called &quot;My Jewel, My Joy&quot;, stating that it was heard in Dublin. The same statement appears in the Lodewick article referenced in those notes The notes given in the source cited for this fragment, a collection of songs collected by William Forde and published by P. W. Joyce, state that the song was heard in Cork, not Dublin.

The version of the &quot;Unfortunate Rake&quot; on the LP of that name is sung by Lloyd, of whom it has been said that he &quot;sometimes modified lyrics or melodies to make the songs more palatable for contemporary listeners&quot;, and its first verse is as follows:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:24px;&quot;&gt;
As I was a-walking down by St. James Hospital,
I was a-walking down by there one day.
What should I spy but one of my comrades
All wrapped up in a flannel though warm was the day.
&lt;/poem&gt;

&quot;The Unfortunate Rake&quot; (traditional song: this variation is from a 1960 Folkways LP edited by Goldstein, where it was sung by A L Lloyd, and is also the version given by Harwood, apparently using the same source. It is sung to the tune of &quot;My Jewel, My Joy&quot;, for reasons explained by Lloyd in an article referenced in the liner notes to this LP )

The liner notes state that Lloyd is singing a nineteenth century broadside version, but do not specify which. The Lloyd article cited in the references given in the liner notes, refers to a version published by Such and to no other version. The title and words sung by Lloyd are not those of the Such broadside which has no reference to St. James and is not called &quot;The Unfortunate Rake&quot;. Lloyd recorded a slightly different version in 1966, this time calling the song &quot;St James Hospital&quot;. In 1967, his book &quot;Folk Song in England&quot; was published. This includes some comment on the song, claims without any supporting references or information that a Czech version pre-dates the British ones, repeats the confusion between Dublin and Cork as the place where the &quot;My Jewel My Joy&quot; fragment had been heard, and includes an unattributed quotation of two verses that differ from the versions sung by Lloyd.

Variations typically feature a narrator telling the story of a young man &quot;cut down in his prime&quot; (occasionally, a young woman &quot;cut down in her prime&quot;) as a result of morally questionable behaviour. For example, when the song moved to America, gambling and alcohol became common causes of the youth&#x27;s death.

<text>Franz Pfeiffer (February 27, 1815 – May 29, 1868), was a Swiss literary scholar who worked in Germany and Austria.

==Biography==

Franz Pfeiffer was born in Solothurn as a Bürger (citizen) of Bettlach. After studying at the University of Munich he went to Stuttgart, where in 1846 he became librarian to the royal library. In 1856 Pfeiffer founded &quot;Germania&quot;, a quarterly periodical devoted to German antiquarian research. In 1857, having established himself as one of the foremost authorities on German medieval literature and philology, he was appointed professor of these subjects at the University of Vienna, and in 1860 was made a member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences.

In his later years he traveled regularly to Überlingen am Bodensee to take the waters at the city&#x27;s spa. He died in Vienna.

==Works==
Pfeiffer&#x27;s most significant work is arguably the second volume of his &quot;Die deutschen Mystiker&quot; (German Mysticism). In this volume Pfeiffer collected the surviving German texts of the 14th Century mystic Meister Eckhart, who was at that time largely forgotten. This publication of the German Eckhartian corpus led to the modern revival of interest in Eckhart. Though there was subsequent dispute as to how many of the texts in Pfeiffer&#x27;s edition are genuinely by Eckhart, his edition remains a classic reference, though it has been superseded by the critical edition begun in 1936 under the aegis of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and only now nearing completion. The early translators of Eckhart into English, Evans and Blakney, depended largely on Pfeiffer for their source material.

His own work: 
*&quot;Zur deutschen Literaturgeschichte&quot;
*&quot;Freie Forschung: kleine Schriften zur Geschichte der deutschen Litteratur und Sprache&quot; (1867)
*&quot;Über Wesen und Bildung der hofischen Sprache in mittelhochdeutscher Zeit&quot;
*&quot;Der Dichter des Nibelungenliedes&quot; (1862)
*&quot;Forschung und Kritik auf dem Gebiete des deutschen Altertums&quot;
*&quot;Altdeutsches Übungsbuch&quot;.

He edited:
* &quot;Barlaam und Josaphat&quot;, Rudolf von Ems (1843)
* &quot;Der Edelstein&quot;, Ulrich Boner (1844)
* &quot;Die deutschen Mystiker des 14. Jahrhunderts&quot; (1845-1857)
* Nikolaus von Jeroschin, &quot;Deutsche Ordenschronik&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of the Teutonic Knights,&quot; 1854)
* &quot;Buch der Natur of Konrad von Megenberg&quot;, a 14th-century writer (1861)
* &quot;Die Predigten des Berthold von Regensburg&quot;, vol. 1 and vol. 2 (1862, 1880)
* Poems of Walther von der Vogelweide (1864; 6th ed., 1880) This work was his contribution to a series he founded called Deutsche Klassiker des Mittelalters (&quot;German classics of the Middle Ages&quot;).

<doc id="209369" wikidata="Q3641737" url="?curid=209369" title="Bolingbroke, Lincolnshire">
<text>Bolingbroke, now called Old Bolingbroke, is a village and civil parish in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England. Its present boundaries were formed by the amalgamation of the Parishes of Bolingbroke and Hareby in 1739. The population at the 2011 census was 325.

Bolingbroke is west of Spilsby. The village of New Bolingbroke is to the south-west. The Prime Meridian passes through the parish to the west of Old Bolingbroke.

==History==

Bolingbroke appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Bolingborc&quot;, one of 38 places associated with Stori of Bolingbroke at the time of the Norman conquest. This suggests an Anglo-Saxon etymological origin, possibly &quot;Bolingburh&quot; or similar (burh of Bolla&#x27;s people).

William de Roumare, Earl of Lincoln (born ), may have built Bolingbroke Castle in the 12th century as a motte and bailey castle with wet ditch to replace an earlier earthwork defence structure which overlooked the village on Dewy Hill. In the early 13th century, a new castle was constructed at the present site by Ranulph de Blondeville, 4th Earl of Chester following his return in 1220 from the Fifth Crusade. Later, John of Gaunt, son of Edward III, acquired the castle through his wife, Blanche of Lancaster. In 1367, it was the birthplace of John&#x27;s son, Henry, known as Henry Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV of England. The parish church of Old Bolingbroke was rebuilt by Alice de Lacy and John of Gaunt. It was significantly damaged during the siege of the castle in 1643 during the Civil War when the Royalists used the castle to garrison troops prior to the Battle of Winceby (11 October 1643). Only the South Aisle of the 14th century Church remains. A new North Aisle was added during significant renovations by John Fowler in 1889. The last remaining castle structure fell down in 1815. The site became a grassy hillock, which archeologists excavated in the 1970s.
==Geography==
The village sits in a broad valley of the Lincolnshire Wolds, between two streams, that rise in the surrounding hills. These eventually become what is known to the south as Hagnaby Beck. The village is at about above sea level.

To the North West the land rises to the on , where the parish boundary falls at the highest point in the parish, if not quite the summit of the hill. To the north-east the road called Spilsby Hill climbs to a separate high point at . Between these two the narrow Sow Dale leads down to the village, where stands. Sow Dale is the largest of the narrow valleys that cut through the Spilsby Sandstone ridge that forms the high plateau above the village. The traditional grazed landscape is now represented by two nature reserves only. Only the Lower one is in the parish, the upper one is adjacent to the boundary.

Another hill to the south east more high ground forms and where the parish boundary is drawn. So there is another small dale leading down into the village from the east. To the southwest another hill known as Kirkby Hill is topped with a that sits just within the parish boundary.

The high portions of the parish are composed of the Spilsby Sandstone, which overlays here the deeper Kimmeridge and Ampthill mudstones. Eroded by the streams in the Dales, the Sandstones are removed, exposing in part the mudstone layer, although in general these are covered in the village and the river valley to the south-west by the Quaternary post-glacial sands and gravels of the Bain Valley formation.

The parish boundary is complex, but can be summarised as surrounding the village, which is broadly central, and enclosing the rising ground in all directions. It generally does not include the plateau above the village. No major roads cross the parish, but the village is joined by minor roads to many surrounding settlements. The Prime (Greenwich) Meridian runs through the Parish just west of the village. There are, and were, no railway connections, the nearest stations being historically Spilsby, and now Thorpe Culvert.
==Community==
Events at the castle site are overseen by Heritage Lincolnshire, and locally by the Friends of Bolingbroke Castle, who also arrange other local charitable functions.

The Parish Council own and maintain the King George V Playing Field and Ramsden Village Hall, the latter named for John and Eleanor Ramsden who bequeathed the land used for both to the village in 1937.

The mobile library visits for an hour a month.

The ecclesiastical parish of Old Bolingbroke is part of the Spilsby, Marden Hill, Stickney and Partney Group Parishes of the Deanery of Bolingbroke. The parish church is dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul. There is a second church in the parish in Hareby, also named Saint Peter and Saint Paul.

The village&#x27;s Methodist Chapel in Chapel Lane was built in 1845. It is part of the Mid Lincolnshire Circuit. The congregation became an eco-congregation in 2007.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1998 was the 43rd edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest, held on 9 May 1998 at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham, United Kingdom. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and presented by Terry Wogan and Ulrika Jonsson, the contest was held in the United Kingdom following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; by Katrina and the Waves.

Twenty-five countries participated in the contest. Six participating countries in the 1997 edition were absent, with , , , and relegated due to achieving the lowest average points totals over the previous five contests and actively choosing not to participate. These countries were replaced by in its first contest appearance, and previously relegated and absent countries , , , and .

The winner was with the song &quot;Diva&quot;, composed by Svika Pick, written by Yoav Ginai and performed by Dana International. The , , the , and rounded out the top five. Dana International was the contest&#x27;s first openly transgender participant and became the contest&#x27;s first openly LGBTQ+ winning artist; however, her participation for Israel was controversial among sections of Israeli society and resulted in opposition and death threats against her in the run-up to the contest.

It was the first contest in which the results were determined predominantly through televoting, and would become the last contest in which all participants were required to perform in the language of their country and the last to feature an orchestra and live music accompaniment for the competing entries.

== Location ==
The 1998 contest took place in Birmingham, the United Kingdom, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot;, performed by Katrina and the Waves. It was the eighth time that the United Kingdom had hosted the contestsetting a new contest recordwith the nation having previously hosted the contest in London in , , and , in Edinburgh in , in Brighton in and in Harrogate in . The selected venue was the National Indoor Arena, a sporting venue and indoor arena opened in 1991 which prior to the contest had previously hosted the 1993 IBF Badminton World Championships and 1995 World Netball Championships, as well as being the principal venue for the recording of UK television programme &quot;Gladiators&quot;.

Many cities across the United Kingdom expressed interest in hosting the contest, the first to be held in the country in sixteen years, with venues in Aberdeen, Belfast, Bournemouth, Brighton, Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Harrogate, Inverness, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield being considered. Following visits by the production team to each city, Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, Glasgow, London and Manchester were shortlisted as potential host cities, and Birmingham&#x27;s National Indoor Arena was subsequently announced as the host venue on 8 August 1997.

==Participating countries==
Per the rules of the contest twenty-five countries were allowed to participate in the event. participated in the contest for the first time, having previously applied to enter the but failing to progress from that edition&#x27;s qualifying round; due to the then-ongoing Macedonia naming dispute with Greece, the nation participated under the provisional reference &quot;the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&quot; or its shortened form &quot;FYR Macedonia&quot;. , , , , and made a return to the contest, replacing , , , , and , which were relegated following the previous year&#x27;s contest, and which decided against entering the event. Italy would not return to the contest again until 2011.

Among the performers at this year&#x27;s contest were five representatives who had previously competed as lead artists in past editions. Two artists returned as lead artists in the 1998 contest: Danijela had previously represented as a member of the group Magazin; and José Cid, a member of Alma Lusa, had represented . Additionally, three artists who had previously competed as lead artists at Eurovision returned as backing performers for their respective countries at this year&#x27;s event: José María Guzmán, who had represented as a member of the group Cadillac, was a backing singer for Mikel Herzog; Egon Egemann, who had represented , performed on stage as violinist for Gunvor; and Paul Harrington, who won the contest for with Charlie McGettigan, providing backing vocals for Dawn Martin.


=== Qualification ===
Due to the high number of countries wishing to enter the contest a relegation system was introduced in in order to reduce the number of countries which could compete in each year&#x27;s contest. Any relegated countries would be able to return the following year, thus allowing all countries the opportunity to compete in at least one in every two editions. The relegation rules introduced for the 1997 contest were again utilised ahead of the 1998 contest, based on each country&#x27;s average points total in previous contests. The twenty-five participants were made up of the previous year&#x27;s winning country and host nation, the eighteen countries which had the highest average points total over the preceding four contests, and any eligible countries which did not compete in the 1997 contest. In cases where the average was identical between two or more countries the total number of points scored in the most recent contest determined the final order.

Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Denmark, , Iceland and Russia were therefore excluded from participating in the 1998 contest; however, after Italy declined to participate Germany was subsequently provided a reprieve and allowed to enter. The calculations used to determine the countries relegated for the 1998 contest are outlined in the table below.

==Production==
The Eurovision Song Contest 1998 was produced by the British public broadcaster British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Kevin Bishop served as executive producer, Guy Freeman served as producer, Geoff Posner served as director, Andrew Howe-Davies served as designer, and Martin Koch served as musical director, leading the 60-piece BBC Concert Orchestra and arranging and orchestrating the music for the opening and closing sequences and the interval act. On behalf of the contest organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the event was overseen by Christine Marchal-Ortiz as scrutineer.

Construction within the National Indoor Arena began on 19 April 1998 to build out the stage and orchestral area for the contest, as well as creating space for the green room, the dressing rooms, the press centre and accreditation area, and small rooms for use by each country&#x27;s individual commentators. Although the arena could hold up to 13,000 people, the assembled audience during the contest was limited to around 4,500, with tickets for the dress rehearsal and live show awarded by ballot. The contest organisers also engaged with fan groups, and tickets in the front rows of the arena were distributed among these groups for the first time.

The green room was situated behind the stage, and was designed to resemble a nightclub. The arena featured three large video screens to enable the audience to follow the voting, and video walls were also constructed for use on stage, in the press centre and the green room. A 400-seat auditorium for press conferences and 38 booths for journalists equipped with phone lines were installed within the press centre, and 40 commentary boxes were constructed in the arena to accommodate the teams from the various broadcasters, with 28 built for television and 12 for radio. Much of the press centre facilities constructed for the contest were subsequently retained and augmented for use during the 24th G8 summit held in Birmingham the following week.

Orchestral rehearsals and rehearsals of the main elements of the interval act took place on 2 and 3 May, with rehearsals for the competing countries beginning on 4 May. The first rehearsals for each country, lasting 40 minutes in total followed by a 20 minute press conference, took place on 4 and 5 May, with second rehearsals for each country taking place on 6 and 7 May and lasting 30 minutes. Three dress rehearsals were held on 8 and 9 May, with an audience in attendance during the evening dress rehearsal on 8 May, which was also recorded for use in case of problems during the live contest that resulted in the broadcast being suspended. Stand-in studios were also prepared in Studio 4 of BBC Television Centre, London and in the Pebble Mill Studios in Birmingham in case of an emergency at the National Indoor Arena that resulted in evacuation.

===Presenters===

The Swedish-British television presenter and model Ulrika Jonsson and the Irish television and radio presenter Terry Wogan were the presenters of the 1998 contest. Wogan had previously provided television and radio commentary on the BBC since 1971, and performed this role once again for the contest&#x27;s broadcast on BBC One from a separate commentary booth erected behind the stage in addition to his role as the contest presenter.

The draw to the determine the running order, held on 13 November 1997 in the National Indoor Arena, was compered by Wogan and Katrina Leskanich, lead vocalist of the 1997 contest winners Katrina and the Waves.

===Conductors===
For those countries which opted to utilise the orchestra during their performance a separate musical director could be nominated to lead the orchestra during their performance, with the host musical director, Martin Koch, also conducting for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor.

The entries from Belgium, Greece, Germany, Israel, Malta, Slovenia and Switzerland were performed entirely without orchestration; however, in the case of Germany and Slovenia, conductors for those countries were present during the contest. Stefan Raab, the writer of the German entry under the pseudonym &quot;Alf Igel&quot;, had no intention of conducting the orchestra but insisted on taking the customary conductor&#x27;s bow before the entry, while the Slovenian entry had been due to be performed with the orchestra before a change of mind by the songwriters during the rehearsals led to the full backing track being used and their conductor Mojmir Sepe instead signalling to start the track. The French entry had been planned to be performed completely with the backing track, but during rehearsals a decision was reached to incorporate additional live string accompaniment from the orchestra directed by Martin Koch.

During rehearsals conflict occurred between the contest organisers and the Greek delegation, with the Greeks unhappy with the way that their entry was being presented on screen. Aggressive behaviour by the Greek composer, Yiannis Valvis, during the dress rehearsals led to his accreditation being rescinded, and on the day of the contest the Greek broadcaster Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) withdrew from the contest, a decision which was ultimately reversed minutes later. Issues also arose during the rehearsals for the Turkish entry, when their conductor Ümit Eroğlu was found to be leading the orchestra at too slow a tempo, resulting in the performance running over the three minute limit and thus breaking the rules of the contest. Ultimately the final performance lasted two minutes and fifty-nine seconds, ensuring that Turkey could not be disqualified for exceeding the time limit during the final and would remain in the competition.

===Trophy===
The trophy awarded to the writers of the winning song was designed by Anongkarat Unyawong, a student at the Birmingham School of Jewellery, who had won a competition conducted at the school for the occasion. The winning performers received a glass bowl designed by Susan Nickson bearing the Eurovision Song Contest 1998 logo. The winners were heralded by the trumpeters of the Life Guards as they entered the stage, and the awards were presented by Katrina Leskanich.

==Format==
The rules of the Eurovision Song Contest 1998 were published in November 1997. The document set out the overall aim of the contest and provided detail on the organisation of the event, the qualification process, the criteria for the competing songs and performers, the voting system to be used to determine the results of the contest, as well as the rights and responsibilities conferred by the EBU onto the participating broadcasters.

=== Entries ===
Each participating broadcaster submitted one song to the contest, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration and performed in the language, or one of the languages, of the participating country. Short quotations from another language, no more than a single phrase repeated a maximum of three times, were permitted. Each entry was able to utilise all or part of the live orchestra and could use instrumental-only backing tracks. This was the second edition of the contest in which the entire song could be performed with a backing track, following the 1997 contest; previously any backing tracks which were used could only include the sound of instruments which featured on stage being mimed by the performers. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country&#x27;s performance, and all performers must have reached the age of 16 in the year of the contest.

Selected entries were not permitted to be released commercially before 1 January 1998; entries were only permitted to be released after being selected for the contest, and were then only allowed to be released in the country they represented until after the contest was held. Entries were required to be selected by each country&#x27;s participating broadcaster by 15 March, and the final submission date for all selected entries to be received by the contest organisers was set for 23 March. This submission was required to include the score of the song for use by the orchestra, a sound recording of the entry and backing track for use during the contest, and the text of the song lyrics in its original language and translations in French and English for distribution to the participating broadcasters, their commentators and juries.

For the first time a watermark was included on screen during each entry with the name of the country being performed, an innovation which has become a standard feature in each contest. This edition of the contest would conversely be the last in which countries would be obliged to perform in their own language and the last to feature an orchestra accompanying the competing entries; from the following year&#x27;s contest participating countries were able to send entries in any language and the organising broadcaster was no longer obliged to provide an orchestra. In subsequent years the rules would be modified again to remove the option for entries to be accompanied by live music entirely.

=== Voting procedure ===

The results of the 1998 contest were determined through the same scoring system as had first been introduced in : each country awarded twelve points to its favourite entry, followed by ten points to its second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to one for the remaining songs which featured in the country&#x27;s top ten, with countries unable to vote for their own entry. For the first time each participating country was required to use televoting to determine their points, with countries with weak telephone networks that prevented them from holding a large-scale televote being granted an exception. This followed a trial held in the 1997 contest where televoting was used to determine the points from five of the twenty-five competing countries. Viewers had a total of five minutes to register their vote by calling one of twenty-four different telephone numbers to represent the twenty-five competing entries except that which represented their own country, with voting lines opening following the performance of the last competing entry. Once phone lines were opened a video recap containing short clips of each competing entry with the accompanying phone number for voting was shown in order to aid viewers during the voting window. Systems were also put in place to prevent lobby groups from one country voting for their song by travelling to other countries.

The points from countries which were unable to use televoting were determined by an assembled jury of sixteen individuals, which was required to be split evenly between members of the public and music professionals, comprised additionally of an equal number of men and women, and below and above 30 years of age. In addition countries using televoting were required to appoint a back-up jury of eight members which would be called into action upon technical failure preventing the televote results from being used, with the same equal split of gender, age and occupation. Each jury member voted in secret and awarded between one and ten votes to each participating song, excluding that from their own country and with no abstentions permitted. The votes of each member were collected following the country&#x27;s performance and then tallied by the non-voting jury chairperson to determine the points to be awarded. In any cases where two or more songs in the top ten received the same number of votes, a show of hands by all jury members was used to determine the final placing; if a tie still remained, the youngest jury member would have the deciding vote.

===Postcards===
Each entry was preceded by a video postcard which served as an introduction to the competing artists from each country, as well as providing an opportunity to showcase the running artistic theme of the event and creating a transition between entries to allow stage crew to make changes on stage. The postcards for the 1998 contest continued the theme of the opening segment, with each clip focussing on a particular themeeither an object, place or conceptand creating a juxtaposition between its older and newer versions. Each postcard was accompanied by extracts of Britpop or classical music, with a pattern featured in the final moments of the footage forming into the flag of the country which was about to perform. The various themes for each postcard, and the musical accompaniment which featured, are listed below by order of performance:

== Contest overview ==
The contest took place on 9 May 1998 at 20:00 (BST) and lasted 3 hours. The table below outlines the participating countries, the order in which they performed, the competing artists and songs, and the results of the voting.

The contest began with a video entitled &quot;Birmingham, Old and New&quot;, which presented overlapping images of Birmingham in 1998 with archive footage of the city, including shots of Brindleyplace and boats on the city&#x27;s canal network, to music from the BBC Concert Orchestra. A fanfare from the trumpeters of the Life Guards greeted the contest&#x27;s presenters as they entered the stage. Also featured during the opening section of the broadcast was a summary video of the 1960 contest, the first to be held in the United Kingdom, with that year&#x27;s presenter Katie Boylethe only individual to host four contestsin attendance as a special guest. Special appearances were also featured from Katrina Leskanich and Carrie Crowley, the co-presenter of the , who appeared via video link from Dublin.

The interval performance was entitled &quot;Jupiter, The Bringer of Jollity&quot;, based on music from the movement of the same name from the orchestral suite &quot;The Planets&quot; by English composer Gustav Holst. A medley of vocal and instrumental pieces inspired by English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish, Indian and Zulu cultures, the segment included over 200 performers and featured music from the BBC Concert Orchestra and performances by soprano Lesley Garrett, violinist Vanessa-Mae, the Sutherland Pipe Band, Andrew Findon on tin whistle, Carys Hughes on harp, the bhangra dance group Nachda Sansaar, the Canoldir Male Voice Choir, the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, trumpeters from the Band of the Blues and Royals and an excerpt of Patti Boulaye&#x27;s &quot;Sun Dance&quot;.

The winner was represented by the song &quot;Diva&quot;, composed by Svika Pick, written by and performed by Dana International. This marked Israel&#x27;s third contest win, following the country&#x27;s back-to-back victories in and . Dana International, the contest&#x27;s first openly transgender participant, also became the first openly LGBTQ+ and first openly transgender artist to win the event. The United Kingdom earned a record-extending fifteenth second place finish, Malta&#x27;s third place finish equalled its previous best contest performance, and the Netherlands obtained its best placing since its most recent victory in by finishing in fourth place.

Following her victory Dana International also caused a delay in the production when, following the conclusion of the voting, she changed outfits into one specially designed for the contest by Jean Paul Gaultier but which was ultimately not used for the original performance. This led to scenes towards the end of the broadcast of hosts Terry Wogan and Ulrika Jonsson, and last year&#x27;s winning vocalist Katrina Leskanich, looking perturbed and confused as to the delay and location of Dana International.

Following the contest it was announced the results of the Spanish vote had been incorrectly tabulated, resulting in Germany, which should have been awarded twelve points, receiving no points at all; this subsequently had an impact on the remaining countries which were awarded points by Spain. The tables in this article present the corrected results as published by the EBU.

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing, in English or French, the votes for its respective country. As had been the case since the , the spokespersons were connected via satellite and appeared in vision during the broadcast. Spokespersons at the 1998 contest are listed below.

During the voting procedure Ulrika Jonsson had an unplanned comical moment with the Dutch spokesperson Conny Vandenbos; after Vandenbos had expressed her sympathy with the performers in the contesthaving previously represented the Netherlands in she added that &quot;it&#x27;s long ago&quot;. This comment was not heard by the audience in the arena due to noise, but Jonsson&#x27;s reply, &quot;a long time ago, was it?&quot; was, leading to a reaction from the crowd due to the perceived rudeness of the remark out of context.

== Detailed voting results ==

Televoting was used to determine the points awarded by all countries, except Hungary, Romania and Turkey. The announcement of the results from each country was conducted in the order in which they performed, with the spokespersons announcing their country&#x27;s points in English or French in ascending order. The detailed breakdown of the points awarded by each country is listed in the tables below.

=== 12 points===
The below table summarises how the maximum 12 points were awarded from one country to another. The winning country is shown in bold. Malta and the United Kingdom each received the maximum score of 12 points from four countries, with Germany and Israel receiving three sets of 12 points each, Croatia and the Netherlands receiving two sets each, and Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Norway, Sweden and Turkey each receiving one maximum score.

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay live and in full the contest via television. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;; any passive countries wishing to participate in the following year&#x27;s event were also required to provide a live broadcast of the contest or a deferred broadcast within 24 hours. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. These commentators were typically sent to the venue to report on the event, and were able to provide commentary from small booths constructed at the back of the venue.

The 1998 contest was transmitted to 33 European countries, as well as to Australia, Canada and South Korea, with an estimated audience of 600 million viewers reported following the contest. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators, are shown in the tables below.



==Other awards==

===Barbara Dex Award===
The Barbara Dex Award, created in 1997 by fansite House of Eurovision, was awarded to the performer deemed to have been the &quot;worst dressed&quot; among the participants. The winner in 1998 was Germany&#x27;s representative Guildo Horn, as determined by the founders of the House of Eurovision site Edwin van Thillo and Rob Paardekam.

==Reception and legacy==
The selection of Dana International as the Israeli representative for the contest by the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) created uproar among members of the Orthodox Jewish community in Israel. Taking issue with the singer&#x27;s transgender status, groups mounted street protests against her selection, and she also received death threats ahead of the contest. Her selection was also opposed by political figures, with deputy minister Shlomo Benizri demanding her removal, referring to the singer as &quot;an abomination&quot; and her selection as &quot;sending a message of darkness&quot;. On arriving at the contest Dana International was accommodated in the Hyatt Regency Birmingham, the only hotel in Birmingham with bulletproof windows, and was accompanied in public by armed guards.

&quot;Diva&quot; was subsequently nominated in 2005 to compete in &quot;&quot;, a special broadcast to determine the contest&#x27;s most popular entry of its first 50 years as part of the contest&#x27;s anniversary celebrations. One of 14 entries chosen to competethe only song from the 1990s on the list&quot;Diva&quot; ultimately finished in thirteenth place.

<text>Georges-Casimir Dessaulles (September 29, 1827 – April 19, 1930), was a Canadian businessman, statesman and senator. Dessaulles was one of the oldest serving politicians ever, only surpassed by Giovanni Battista Borea d&#x27;Olmo. Appointed to the Senate of Canada representing the Province of Quebec in 1907 at age 80, Dessaulles served for 23 years before dying at age 102.

Dessaulles was born in Saint-Hyacinthe, Lower Canada in 1827, the son of Jean Dessaulles and a nephew of Louis-Joseph Papineau. Dessaulles attended college at Georgetown University where he was a member of the Philodemic Society, graduating in 1848. Before becoming senator, Dessaulles was president of the Bank of Saint-Hyacinthe, and mayor of Saint-Hyacinthe. He also represented Saint-Hyacinthe in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1897 to 1900. He was a last-minute candidate for the provincial seat, having been nominated after the death of the previous candidate, his son-in-law Maurice St-Jacques.

In 1857, he had married Émilie-Emma, the daughter of judge Dominique Mondelet; in 1869, he married Louise-Frances Leman after the death of his first wife. His 100th birthday was marked as a historic moment in the senate, because Dessaulles had become only the second sitting senator to reach the age of 100 (the other being David Wark). At his death in 1930, Dessaulles was the oldest sitting politician in the world. To date, no one has beaten this record.

Dessaulles is also renowned for only having spoken twice while serving as a Senator. Once to deny that his appointment was part of a corrupt bargain, and a second time to thank his fellow senators for his portrait, on his 100th birthday.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1997 was the 42nd edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest, held on 3 May 1997 at the Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (RTÉ) and presented by Carrie Crowley and Ronan Keating, the contest was held in Ireland following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;The Voice&quot; by Eimear Quinn. The 1997 contest was the seventh – and to date last – edition to be staged in Ireland, as well as the fourth to be produced by RTÉ in five years. The Point Theatre served as the host venue for the third time, following the and contests, becoming the only venue to have been the site of three Eurovision Song Contests.

Twenty-five countries participated in the contest, with a new relegation system introduced to determine which nations could participate, based on each country&#x27;s average points total in previous contests. made its first appearance since , and , , and returned after last competing in , having been prevented from competing the previous year after failing to progress from that event&#x27;s qualifying round. , and , participants in the previous year&#x27;s contest, were unable to return after being excluded by the new relegation rules.

The winner was the with the song &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot;, written by Kimberley Rew and performed by Katrina and the Waves. , , , and rounded out the top five, with Ireland earning their fifth placing in the top two within six years and Turkey and Cyprus achieving their best results to date. Five of the competing countries used televoting to determine their points, allowing the general viewing public a say in the results for the first time; following this successful trial all countries were encouraged to use this system starting from the . Entries were also permitted for the first time to feature no live music accompaniment, with each performance being able to use only a backing track rather than utilising any part of the orchestra or any live instrumentation from the performers themselves.

The 1997 event would prove to be a watershed for the contest, with many aspects of this event leaving a lasting impact on future editions of Eurovision. These included: the first openly LGBT artist, Iceland&#x27;s Paul Oscar, selected to compete in the event; changes to contest rules led to the abandonment of live musical accompaniment in future events; a successful trial of televoting in five countries led to widespread adoption for all countries in 1998.

== Location ==

The 1997 contest took place in Dublin, Ireland, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;The Voice&quot;, performed by Eimear Quinn. It was the seventh time that Ireland had hosted the contest, having previously staged the event in , , , , , and , with all previous events held in Dublin except the 1993 contest which was held in Millstreet. This was the fourth edition of the contest that Ireland had hosted within five years, and with this edition Ireland equalled the record for the nation which had staged the most contests, originally set by the United Kingdom in .

Given the financial impact to staging the contest for a fourth time in five years, there was early speculation following their win in the 1996 contest that (RTÉ) might stage the event as a co-production with BBC Northern Ireland, however ultimately the Irish broadcaster decided to organise the event on its own once again. The selected venue was the Point Theatre, a concert and events venue located amongst the Dublin Docklands which had originally been built as a train depot to serve the nearby port. Opened as a music venue in 1988, it was closed for redevelopment and expansion in 2008 and is now known as the 3Arena. The venue had previously hosted the 1994 and 1995 contests, and with this staging it became the only venue to have hosted three Eurovision Song Contests.

==Participating countries==

Per the rules of the contest twenty-five countries were allowed to participate in the event. , , , and made a return to the contest after failing to progress from the qualifying round in the previous year&#x27;s contest, and returned after last competing . Conversely , , and , participants in the 1996 contest, were relegated and prevented from participating in this year&#x27;s event.

Three representatives who had previously performed as lead artists in the contest competed again at this year&#x27;s event. Two artists represented their country for a second consecutive year, with Şebnem Paker having represented , and Maarja-Liis Ilus, after having represented with Ivo Linna, competing as a solo artist. Alma Čardžić also made a second appearance in the contest, having previously represented . Additionally, Tor Endresen and Bettina Soriat, representing Norway and Austria, respectively, in this year&#x27;s event, had performed in previous contests as backing vocalist. Endresen had supported , and Soriat had supported .


===Qualification===
Due to the high number of countries wishing to enter the contest a relegation system was introduced in 1993 in order to reduce the number of countries which could compete in each year&#x27;s contest. Any relegated countries would be able to return the following year, thus allowing all countries the opportunity to compete in at least one in every two editions. The audio-only qualifying round used in 1996 had been poorly received among the competing countries, and so a new relegation system was introduced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) for 1997 and future contests. The twenty-five participants in the 1997 contest were made up of the previous year&#x27;s winning country and host nation Ireland, and the twenty-four countries which had the highest average points total over the preceding four contests. In cases where the average was identical between two or more countries the total number of points scored in the most recent contest determined the final order. Any countries which were not able to compete in the 1997 contest would then be eligible to compete in the 1998 event.

Belgium, , Finland, , , and Slovakia were therefore excluded from participating in the 1997 contest; however following &#x27;s withdrawal due to the date of the final clashing with its Holocaust Remembrance Day, Bosnia and Herzegovina was subsequently provided a reprieve and allowed to participate. was also excluded due to their failure to progress through the qualifying round in 1996. The calculations used to determine the countries relegated for the 1997 contest are outlined in the table below.

== Production ==

The Eurovision Song Contest 1997 was produced by the Irish public broadcaster {{lang|ga|Radio Telefís Éireann|i=unset}} (RTÉ). Noel Curran served as executive producer, Ian McGarry served as director, Paula Farrell and John Casey served as designers, and Frank McNamara served as musical director, leading the RTÉ Concert Orchestra.{{sfn|Roxburgh|2020|p=309}} On behalf of the contest organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the event was overseen by Marie-Claire Vionnet as scrutineer.{{sfn|O&#x27;Connor|2010|p=210}}

Rehearsals in the contest venue for the competing acts began on 28 April 1997. Each country had two technical rehearsals in the week approaching the contest, with countries rehearsing in the order in which they would perform. The first rehearsals took place on 28 and 29 April, with each country allowed 40 minutes total on stage followed by a 20-minute press conference, followed by the second rehearsals on 30 April and 1 May lasting 30 minutes.{{sfn|Roxburgh|2020|pp=296–297}} Times were also arranged during the week for the artists to be recorded in the RTÉ studios, with footage used during the postcards between each song.{{sfn|Roxburgh|2020|pp=296–297}} Three dress rehearsals were held on 2 and 3 May, with an audience in attendance during the evening dress rehearsal on 2 May. The final dress rehearsal on 3 May was also recorded for use as a production stand-by in case of problems during the live contest.{{sfn|Roxburgh|2020|pp=296–297}} A tight security presence was felt during the rehearsal week; emergency drills were held by {{lang|ga|Gardaí|i=unset}}, including evacuations of the Point Theatre, as a precaution against potential disruption from loyalist paramilitaries as part of the wider sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland.

The Irish television and radio presenter Carrie Crowley and the Irish singer Ronan Keating were the presenters of the 1997 contest. The trophy awarded to the winners was designed by Maura Whelan and Luc Racine, and was presented by the previous year&#x27;s winning artist Eimear Quinn.{{sfn|O&#x27;Connor|2010|p=216}}

== Format ==
=== Entries ===
Each participating broadcaster submitted one song, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration and performed in the language, or one of the languages, of the country which it represented. Short quotations from another language, no more than a single phrase repeated a maximum of three times, were permitted. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country&#x27;s performance, and all participants were required to have reached the age of 16 in the year of the contest. Each entry could utilise all or part of the live orchestra and could use instrumental-only backing tracks. This was the first time that a competing song could be accompanied entirely with a backing track following a change to the contest rules, with the previous rules stating that any backing tracks used could only include the sound of instruments featured on stage being mimed by the performers.{{sfn|Roxburgh|2020|pp=296–297}} For those countries which opted to utilise the orchestra a separate musical director could be nominated to lead the orchestra during their performance, with the host musical director, Frank McNamara, also available to conduct for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor.{{sfn|O&#x27;Connor|2010|p=217}} The entries from Austria, Croatia, Germany and Ireland were performed entirely without live orchestration.{{sfn|Roxburgh|2020|pp=297–305}}

Selected entries were not permitted to be released commercially until after 3 February 1997 and after having been selected for the contest. Each country&#x27;s participating broadcaster was required to have selected their entry by 10 March, and all entries had to be submitted to the contest organisers by 19 March, including the score of the song for use by the orchestra, a sound recording of the entry and backing track for use during the contest, and the text of the song lyrics in its original language and translations in French and English for distribution to the participating broadcasters, their commentators and juries.

Following the confirmation of the twenty-five competing countries, the draw to determine the running order was held on 28 November 1996.

=== Voting procedure ===
{{further|Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest}}
The results of the 1997 contest were determined through the same scoring system as had first been introduced in {{escyr|1975}}: each country awarded twelve points to its favourite entry, followed by ten points to its second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to one for the remaining songs which featured in the country&#x27;s top ten, with countries unable to vote for their own entry. The points awarded by the majority of countries were determined by an assembled jury of sixteen individuals, which was required to be split evenly between members of the public and music professionals, comprised additionally of an equal number of men and women, and below and above 30 years of age. Each jury member voted in secret and awarded between one and ten votes to each participating song, excluding that from their own country and with no abstentions permitted. The votes of each member were collected following the country&#x27;s performance and then tallied by the non-voting jury chairperson to determine the points to be awarded. In any cases where two or more songs in the top ten received the same number of votes, a show of hands by all jury members was used to determine the final placing; if a tie still remained, the youngest jury member would have the deciding vote.

For the first time however, as part of a trial held by the contest organisers, televoting was used to determine the points from five of the participating countries. In these countries viewers had a total of five minutes to register their vote by calling one of twenty-four different telephone numbers to represent the twenty-five competing entries except that which represented their own country. Once the voting phone lines were opened following the performance of the last competing entry, a video recap containing short clips of each competing entry with the accompanying phone number for voting was shown in order to aid viewers during the voting window. In those countries which opted to use televoting to determine their points a jury was still required which would function as a back-up in case technical failure prevented the televote results from being used. The composition of the back-up juries in these countries was identical to the juries in the other countries with regards to profession, gender and age.{{sfn|Roxburgh|2020|pp=306–308}}

== Contest overview ==
The contest took place on 3 May 1997 at 20:00 (IST) and lasted 3 hours and 11 minutes.{{sfn|Roxburgh|2020|pp=297–305}}

The show was opened by good luck messages from past Eurovision winners and hosts to the contestants in the contest, and short interviews with previous contestants also featured preceding some of the postcards between the entries.{{sfn|O&#x27;Connor|2010|pp=148–151}} Irish boy band Boyzone, with co-presenter Keating as a member, featured as part of the show&#x27;s interval act, performing the song &quot;Let the Message Run Free&quot;.

The winner was the {{esccnty|United Kingdom|y=1997}} represented by the song &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot;, composed by Kimberley Rew and performed by Katrina and the Waves. This was the United Kingdom&#x27;s fifth contest win{{snd}}their first in sixteen years{{snd}}following victories in {{escyr|1967}}, {{escyr|1969}}, {{escyr|1976}} and {{escyr|1981}}. As of {{escyr|2024}}, this is the last winning UK Eurovision entry. Ireland&#x27;s second-place finish earned them their fifth placing in the top two within six years, while Turkey and Cyprus achieved their highest placings yet by finishing third and fifth respectively. Norway meanwhile finished in last place for the eighth time and received their fourth &quot;nul points&quot;. Following this contest {{esccnty|Italy}}&#x27;s RAI declined to participate in future events and an Italian entry would not participate in the Eurovision Song Contest for 14 years, until their return at the {{escyr|2011||2011 event}}.

=== Spokespersons ===

Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing, in English or French, the votes for its respective country. As had been the case since the {{escyr|1994||1994 contest}}, the spokespersons were connected via satellite and appeared in vision during the broadcast. Spokespersons at the 1997 contest are listed below.

== Detailed voting results ==

Jury voting was used to determine the points awarded by most countries, with televoting used in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Roxburgh|2020|pp=306–308}} The announcement of the results from each country was conducted in the order in which they performed, with the spokespersons announcing their country&#x27;s points in English or French in ascending order. The detailed breakdown of the points awarded by each country is listed in the tables below.

===12 points===
The below table summarises how the maximum 12 points were awarded from one country to another. The winning country is shown in bold. The United Kingdom received the maximum score of 12 points from ten countries, with France and Turkey receiving three sets of 12 points each, Cyprus receiving two sets of 12 points, and Estonia, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Russia and Spain each receiving one maximum score.

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest live and in full via television. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;; any passive countries wishing to participate in the following year&#x27;s event were also required to provide a live broadcast of the contest or a deferred broadcast within 24 hours. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. These commentators were typically sent to the venue to report on the event, and were able to provide commentary from small booths constructed at the back of the venue. An estimated audience of 300 million viewers was reported.

Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators, are shown in the tables below:

==Legacy==
{{see also|LGBT visibility in the Eurovision Song Contest|Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest}}

The Eurovision Song Contest has long held a fandom within the LGBT community, however it was not until the 1997 event that an openly LGBT artist was selected to compete in the event. {{esccnty|Iceland}}&#x27;s Paul Oscar was the first openly gay man to compete as a lead artist in Eurovision. Paul Oscar&#x27;s participation, as well as changing attitudes to homosexuality in Europe in the following years, marked the beginning of wider visibility of LGBT artists and themes; the {{escyr|1998||following year&#x27;s event}} provided the first trans participant in Israel&#x27;s Dana International, {{escyr|2002}} saw {{esccnty|Slovenia}}&#x27;s {{lang|sl|Sestre|i=unset}} become the first competing artists to perform in drag,{{efn|Although a member of the Norwegian drag act the Great Garlic Girls performed as backing vocalist for Norway&#x27;s Ketil Stokkan at the {{escyr|1986||1986 contest}} in drag, they were not credited for their performance.}} and the {{escyr|2000||2000 contest}} contained the first display of same-sex affection on stage through a kiss between the two male members of the Israeli band PingPong. Since the 1997 contest many openly LGBT artists have competed in the contest, including several winners, among them Dana International, {{esccnty|Austria}}&#x27;s Conchita Wurst in {{escyr|2014}}, and the {{esccnty|Netherlands}}&#x27; Duncan Laurence in {{escyr|2019}}. Paul Oscar&#x27;s contest performance, which featured four female backing dancers dressed in black latex clothing and sexually suggestive choreography, pushed the boundaries for sexual expression on the Eurovision stage for the first time.{{sfn|West|2020|pp=191–195}}

The changes in the rules regarding the use of orchestra for this contest would eventually lead to the complete abandonment of live musical accompaniment in the Eurovision Song Contest. Ahead of the {{escyr|1999||1999 event}} the rules were modified again to make the procurement of an orchestra an optional component to staging the event, with that year&#x27;s event becoming the first to have all competing entries performed to pre-recorded backing tracks. The rules of the contest have since been modified further, and no live musical accompaniment is now allowed for any competing entries.{{sfn|Roxburgh|2020|pp=297–305}} The abolishment of the orchestra proved controversial among some circles, with three-time, former Eurovision winner Johnny Logan referring to the modified event as &quot;karaoke&quot; in 2000.

The introduction of televoting to the contest followed several years of successive Irish wins, with the national juries typically voting for more traditional, middle-of-the-road songs than those that represented the wider tastes of the general public, as was the case in 1996 when Eimear Quinn&#x27;s &quot;The Voice&quot; was victorious over more modern entries such as Gina G&#x27;s &quot;Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit&quot;, which represented the United Kingdom at that year&#x27;s event and would go on to receive a nomination for Best Dance Recording at the 1998 Grammy Awards.{{sfn|O&#x27;Connor|2010|pp=148–151}} The successful trial of televoting in five countries led to widespread adoption for all countries in 1998, and public voting continues to play a part in determining the result of the contest to the present day. The widespread use of televoting in the following years would however lead to accusations of greater political bias and &quot;bloc voting&quot;, with the perception that neighbouring countries swap points and large diasporas are able to vote en masse for their native countries, skewing the results in their favour. Controversy over the perceived unfairness of the voting system reached a head in {{escyr|2007}}, when the public vote largely rewarded the entries from Eastern European countries over those from Western Europe. The EBU would ultimately make changes to mitigate the impact of neighbourly voting by splitting countries by geographical location and voting history in the semi-finals from {{escyr|2008}} and re-introducing juries to account for 50% of each country&#x27;s points in {{escyr|2009}}.

<text>Moriz or Moritz Haupt (27 July 1808 – 5 February 1874), was a German philologist.

==Biography==
He was born at Zittau, Lusatia, Saxony. His early education was mainly conducted by his father, Ernst Friedrich Haupt, burgomaster of Zittau, a man of learning who took pleasure in translating German hymns or Goethe&#x27;s poems into Latin, and whose memoranda were employed by Gustav Freytag in his &quot;Bilder aus der deutschen Vergangenheit&quot;. From the Zittau gymnasium, where he spent the five years 1821–1826, Haupt moved to the University of Leipzig intending to study theology; but his own inclinations and the influence of Professor Gottfried Hermann soon turned him in the direction of classical philology.

On the close of his university course (1830) he returned to his father&#x27;s house, and the next seven years were devoted to study, not only of Greek, Latin and German, but of Old French, Provençal and Bohemian. His friendship with Karl Lachmann, formed at Berlin, had great effect on his intellectual development. In September 1837 he qualified at Leipzig as &quot;Privatdozent&quot;, and his first lectures, dealing with such diverse subjects as Catullus and the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, indicated the two main strands of his interest. A new chair of German language and literature was founded for his benefit, and he became professor extraordinarius (1841) and then professor ordinarius (1843). In 1842 he married Louise Hermann, the daughter of his master and colleague.

Having taken part in 1849 with Otto Jahn and Theodor Mommsen in a political agitation for the maintenance of the imperial constitution, Haupt was deprived of his professorship by a decree of April 22, 1851. Two years later, however, he was called to succeed Lachmann at the University of Berlin and at the same time the Berlin Academy, which had made him a corresponding member in 1841, elected him an ordinary member. In 1861 he became perpetual secretary of the Academy. For 21 years, he was prominent among the scholars of the Prussian capital, making his presence felt, not only by the prestige of his erudition and the clearness of his intellect, but by the tirelessness of his energy and the ardent fearlessness of his temperament. His service to both classical and German philology was rendered chiefly as an editor of texts. He died of heart disease in Berlin.

==Work==

===Latin classics===
Haupt&#x27;s critical work is distinguished by a combination of the most painstaking investigation with bold conjecture; his oft-cited dictum that &quot;If the sense requires it, I am prepared to write &quot;Constantinopolitanus&quot; where the MSS have the monosyllabic interjection &quot;o&quot;&quot; well expresses this boldness. While in his lectures and speeches he was frequently carried away by the excitement of the moment, and made sharp and questionable attacks on his opponents, in his writings he exhibits great self-control. The results of many of his researches are lost, because he would not publish what fell short of his own high ideal of excellence. To the progress of classical scholarship he contributed by &quot;Quaestiones Catullianae&quot; (1837), and editions of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Halieutica&quot; and the &quot;Cynegetica&quot; of Grattius and Nemesianus (1838), of Catullus, Tibullus and Propertius (3rd ccl., 1868), of Horace (3rd ed, 1871) and of Virgil (2nd ccl., 1873).

===German philology===
As early as 1836, with Hoffmann von Fallersleben, he started the &quot;Altdeutsche Blätter&quot;, which in 1841 gave place to the &quot;Zeitschrift für deutsches Alterthum&quot;, of which he continued editor until his death. Hartmann von Aue&#x27;s &quot;Erec&quot; (1839) and his &quot;Lieder und Büchlein&quot; and &quot;Der arme Heinrich&quot; (1842), Rudolf von Ems&#x27;s &quot;Guter Gerhard&quot; (1840) and Konrad von Würzburg&#x27;s &quot;Engelhard&quot; (1844) are the principal German works which he edited.

===Other inclinations===
To form a collection of the French songs of the 16th century was one of his favourite schemes, but a little volume published after his death, &quot;Französische Volkslieder&quot; (1877), is the only monument of his labours in that direction.

Three volumes of his &quot;Opuscula&quot; were published at Leipzig (1875–1877).

<text>Otto Jahn (; 16 June 1813, in Kiel – 9 September 1869, in Göttingen), was a German archaeologist, philologist, and writer on art and music.

==Biography==
After the completion of his university studies at Christian-Albrechts-Universität in Kiel, the University of Leipzig and Humboldt University, Berlin, he traveled for three years in France and Italy. In Rome, he was greatly influenced by the work of August Emil Braun (1809–1856). In 1839 he became &quot;privatdozent&quot; at Kiel, and in 1842 professor-extraordinary of archaeology and philology at the University of Greifswald (ordinary professor 1845).

In 1847 he accepted the chair of archaeology at Leipzig, however, he along with Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) and Moritz Haupt (1808–1874) were dismissed from the university in 1851 for having taken part in the political movements of 1848-1849. In 1855 he was appointed professor of the science of antiquity, and director of the academic art museum at Bonn. While here, he turned down an offer as successor to Eduard Gerhard (1795–1867) at Berlin.

His biography of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart appeared in 1856, the centenary of Mozart&#x27;s birth. From 1852 Jahn collected as many Mozart manuscripts and letters as he could and copied many others. On learning of the Mozart catalogue being written by Köchel he turned this material over to him. Jahn&#x27;s work is admired for its scholarly approach (at the time, novel in Mozart biography); and in versions revised by Hermann Abert and Cliff Eisen, continues in use today.

Among Jahn&#x27;s notable students was the classical archaeologist and philologist Hugo Blümner.

<doc id="209390" wikidata="Q259921" url="?curid=209390" title="Edith Sitwell">
<text>Dame Edith Louisa Sitwell (7 September 1887 – 9 December 1964) was a British poet and critic and the eldest of the three literary Sitwells. She reacted badly to her eccentric, unloving parents and lived much of her life with her governess. She never married but became passionately attached to Russian painter Pavel Tchelitchew, and her home was always open to London&#x27;s poetic circle, to whom she was generous and helpful.

Sitwell published poetry continuously from 1913, some of it abstract and set to music. With her dramatic style and exotic costumes, she was sometimes labelled a poseur, but her work was praised for its solid technique and painstaking craftsmanship. She was a recipient of the Benson Medal of the Royal Society of Literature.

==Early life==

Edith Louisa Sitwell was born in Scarborough, North Riding of Yorkshire, the oldest child and only daughter of Sir George Sitwell, 4th Baronet, of Renishaw Hall; he was an expert on genealogy and landscaping. Her mother was Lady Ida Emily Augusta (née Denison), a daughter of William Denison, 1st Earl of Londesborough and a granddaughter of Henry Somerset, 7th Duke of Beaufort through whom she was descended from the Plantagenets in the female line.

Sitwell had two younger brothers, Osbert (1892–1969) and Sacheverell (1897–1988), both distinguished authors, well-known literary figures in their own right, and long-term collaborators. She described her childhood as &quot;extremely unhappy&quot; and said her mother had &quot;terrible rages&quot; while she rarely saw her father. Her relationship with her parents was stormy at best, not least because her father made her undertake a &quot;cure&quot; for her supposed spinal deformation, involving locking her into an iron frame. She wrote in her autobiography that her parents had always been strangers to her.

Whilst in Scarborough the Sitwell family lived in &quot;Wood End&quot;, a marine villa bought by Lady Louisa Sitwell in 1879 to which she added a double height conservatory filled with tropical plants and birds which Edith mentioned in her autobiography. Although Edith&#x27;s relationship with Scarborough was not always a happy one, references to the seaside environment often occur in her work, particularly Facade.

==Adult life==
In 1914, 26-year-old Sitwell moved to a small, shabby flat in Pembridge Mansions, Bayswater, which she shared with Helen Rootham (1875–1938), her governess since 1903.
Sitwell never married, but seems to have fallen in love with a number of unavailable men over the course of her life. Around 1914, she developed a passion for the Chilean artist and boxer Álvaro de Guevara, whom her biographer Richard Greene describes as &quot;thuggish&quot;. Violent, unstable and addicted to opium, Guevara eventually became involved with the poet and socialite Nancy Cunard, whom Sitwell subsequently &quot;never lost an opportunity to speak ill of&quot;.

After meeting the poet Siegfried Sassoon in 1918, the two became close friends. Sassoon, who was homosexual, cared deeply for Sitwell, but Greene asserts that she fell in love with him, becoming jealous of his lover Stephen Tennant in the late 1920s. Sassoon and Sitwell were often seen out in each other&#x27;s company, leading Sassoon&#x27;s friend and mentor, the critic Edmund Gosse, to suggest that they marry. According to Sassoon&#x27;s biographer, Max Egremont, Sassoon quickly replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t think poets should marry one another.&quot; Throughout the 1920s and &#x27;30s, Sitwell relied on Sassoon for criticism of her work, both privately and publicly. In 1922, he wrote a glowing review of &quot;Façade&quot; in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; entitled &quot;Too Fantastic for Fat-Heads&quot;, in which he compared Sitwell to the artist Aubrey Beardsley and declared: &quot;Aubrey Beardsley has triumphed over all the fat-heads of his day. Miss Sitwell will do the same.&quot; Writing to him in 1933, Sitwell told him: &quot;you are the only person who has ever done anything at all for my poetry.&quot;

In 1927, Sitwell fell in love with the gay Russian painter Pavel Tchelitchew. They developed a close friendship, with Sitwell regularly helping him financially and publicising his work. However, she was often hurt by his unpredictable temper and seeming lack of appreciation for her efforts on his behalf, and Greene suggests that Tchelitchew &quot;toyed with her expectations&quot; of romance when he wanted something from her, growing more distant again when he got what he wanted. Nevertheless, the relationship lasted until his death 30 years later. In 1928, Helen Rootham had surgery for cancer; she eventually became an invalid. In 1932, Rootham and Sitwell moved to Paris, where they lived with Rootham&#x27;s younger sister, Evelyn Wiel.
In 1930, Sitwell published a study of the poet Alexander Pope, in which she argued for Pope&#x27;s greatness and identified him as a precursor of Romanticism. George Orwell, reviewing the book in the &quot;New Adelphi&quot;, noted Sitwell&#x27;s fixation on the &quot;texture&quot; of Pope&#x27;s work, which he argued distracted her from his sometimes hackneyed sentiments, but praised &quot;her warm-hearted defence of the poet against all his detractors&quot;.

Sitwell&#x27;s mother died in 1937. Sitwell did not attend the funeral because of her displeasure with her parents during her childhood. Helen Rootham died of spinal cancer in 1938. During the Second World War, Sitwell returned from France and retired to the family home at Renishaw Hall with her brother Osbert and his lover, David Horner. She wrote under the light of oil lamps as the house had no electricity. She knitted clothes for their friends who served in the army. One of the beneficiaries was Alec Guinness, who received a pair of seaboot stockings.

The poems she wrote during the war brought her back before the public. They include &quot;Street Songs&quot; (1942), &quot;The Song of the Cold&quot; (1945), and &quot;The Shadow of Cain&quot; (1947), all of which were much praised. &quot;Still Falls the Rain&quot;, about the London Blitz, remains perhaps her best-known poem; it was set to music by Benjamin Britten as Canticle III: Still Falls the Rain. Her poem &quot;The Bee-Keeper&quot; was set to music by Priaulx Rainier, as &quot;The Bee Oracles&quot; (1970), a setting for tenor, flute, oboe, violin, cello, and harpsichord. It was premiered by Peter Pears in 1970. Poems from &quot;The Canticle of the Rose&quot; were set by composer Joseph Phibbs in a song-cycle for high soprano with string quartet premiered in 2005.

In 1943, her father died in Switzerland, his wealth depleted. In 1948, a reunion with Tchelitchew, whom she had not seen since before the war, went badly. In 1948 Sitwell toured the United States with her brothers, reciting her poetry and, notoriously, giving a reading of Lady Macbeth&#x27;s sleepwalking scene. Her poetry recitals always were occasions; she made recordings of her poems, including two recordings of &quot;Façade&quot;, the first with Constant Lambert as co-narrator, and the second with Peter Pears.

Tchelitchew died in July 1957. Her brother Osbert died in 1969, of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, diagnosed in 1950. Sitwell became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1954. In August 1955, she converted to Roman Catholicism and asked author Evelyn Waugh to serve as her godfather.

Sitwell wrote two books about Queen Elizabeth I of England: &quot;Fanfare for Elizabeth&quot; (1946) and &quot;The Queens and the Hive&quot; (1962). She always claimed that she wrote prose simply for money and both these books were extremely successful, as were her &quot;English Eccentrics&quot; (1933) and (1936).

Sitwell was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in November 1962, when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews on the stage of the BBC Television Theatre in London.

From 1961 until shortly before her death, Sitwell lived in a flat in Hampstead in London, which is now marked with an English Heritage blue plaque.

==Last years and death==
In about 1957, Sitwell began using a wheelchair, after lifelong joint problems now thought to be caused by Marfan syndrome. In 1959, Sitwell was interviewed by John Freeman, about her life and work, on the BBC television series &quot;Face to Face&quot;. Sitwell was one of only two women to be interviewed during this first iteration of the series, the other being French actress Simone Signoret.

Her last poetry reading was in 1962. In the following year she was awarded the title of Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature (the first woman to be so honoured). She died at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, Lambeth, London, on 9 December 1964 at the age of 77. She is buried in the churchyard of the parish church of Saints Mary and Peter in Weedon Lois, Northamptonshire.

Sitwell&#x27;s papers are held at the Harry Ransom Center at The University of Texas at Austin.

==Poetry==
Sitwell published her first poem &quot;The Drowned Suns&quot; in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in 1913, and between 1916 and 1921 she edited &quot;Wheels&quot;, an annual poetic anthology compiled with her brothers—a literary collaboration generally called &quot;the Sitwells&quot;.

In 1929, she published &quot;Gold Coast Customs&quot;, a poem about the artificiality of human behaviour and the barbarism that lies beneath the surface. The poem was written in the rhythms of the tom-tom and of jazz, and shows considerable technical skill. Her early work reflects the strong influence of the French symbolists.

She became a proponent and supporter of innovative trends in English poetry and opposed what she considered the conventionality of many contemporary backward-looking poets. Her flat became a meeting place for young writers whom she wished to befriend and help: these later included Dylan Thomas and Denton Welch. One of her editors at Duckworth Books was Anthony Powell, who dedicated his novel &quot;What&#x27;s Become of Waring&quot; to her. She also helped to publish the poetry of Wilfred Owen after his death. 

Sitwell&#x27;s only novel, &quot;I Live Under a Black Sun&quot;, based on the life of Jonathan Swift, was published in 1937.

==Publicity and controversy==
Sitwell had angular features resembling Queen Elizabeth I and she stood six feet tall. She often dressed in an unusual manner with gowns of brocade or velvet, with gold turbans and many rings; her jewellery is now in the jewellery galleries of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Her unusual appearance provoked critics almost as much as her verse, and she was the subject of virulent personal attacks from Geoffrey Grigson, F. R. Leavis, and others. Grigson, in his magazine &quot;New Verse&quot;, repeatedly ridiculed Sitwell, calling her &quot;the Old Jane.&quot; She gave as good as she got, describing Leavis as &quot;a tiresome, whining, pettyfogging little pipsqueak&quot;.

Sitwell treated her enemies with scorn. Noël Coward wrote a skit on her and her two brothers as &quot;the Swiss Family Whittlebot&quot; for his 1923 revue &quot;London Calling!&quot;, and although she wrote accepting an apology from him in 1926, she refused to speak to him until they were reconciled after her 70th birthday party at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall. Sitwell participated in the &quot;UGH...&quot; correspondence featured in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; in 1963, an ongoing debate on the value of the work of William S. Burroughs and the nature of literary criticism, initiated by critic John Willard. Sitwell stated that she was delighted by Willard&#x27;s wholly negative review of Burroughs&#x27; work, despite claiming not to know who Burroughs was. In the same letter, she described &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; as an &quot;insignificant, dirty little book&quot;, and rounded out her letter with the statement that she preferred Chanel No. 5 to having her nose &quot;nailed to other people&#x27;s lavatories&quot;.

Sitwell explored the distinction between poetry and music in &quot;Façade&quot; (1922), a series of abstract poems set to music by William Walton. &quot;Façade&quot; was performed behind a curtain with a hole in the mouth of a face painted by John Piper; the words were recited through the hole with the aid of a megaphone. The public received the first performance with bemusement. Critic Julian Symons attacked Sitwell in &quot;The London Magazine&quot; of November 1964, accusing her of &quot;wearing other people&#x27;s bleeding hearts on her own safe sleeve.&quot;

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Eduard Gerhard (29 November 1795 – 12 May 1867) was a German archaeologist. He was co-founder and secretary of the first international archaeological society.

==Biography==
Gerhard was born at Posen, and was educated at Breslau and Berlin. The reputation he acquired by his &quot;Lectiones Apollonianae&quot; (1816) led soon afterwards to his being appointed professor at the gymnasium of Posen. On resigning that office in 1819, on account of weakness of the eyes, he went in 1822 to Rome, where he remained for fifteen years.

Gerhard was one of the principal originators of the Instituto di corrispondenza archeologica, founded at Rome in 1829, with the support of the Prussian crown prince, Frederick William. Co-founders included Theodor Panofka, Otto Magnus von Stackelberg and August Kestner. This model of international cooperation and systematic scientific publication was influenced by the example of Alexander von Humboldt, and later became the present-day German Archaeological Institute. Gerhard served as secretary to the new Institute during his stay in Rome.

Returning to Germany in 1837 he was appointed archaeologist at the Royal Museum of Berlin, and was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society that same year. In 1844 he was chosen a member of the Academy of Sciences, and a professor in Berlin University.

He died at Berlin.

==Evaluation==
&quot;The New International Encyclopædia&quot; of 1905 gives the following evaluation of his work:
:Gerhard&#x27;s great service to archæological study was in the publication of important groups of monuments, and in promoting an orderly classification. Such a worker was much needed at this time, when the excavations at Vulci and elsewhere in Etruria increased so suddenly the mass of early vases and other small objects. For artistic beauty and style Gerhard had little perception; his interest was largely antiquarian, and it is characteristic of him that he was attracted by the Etruscan art, generally of little interest to the artist.

==Publications==

Gerhard contributed to Platner et al.&#x27;s &quot;Beschreibung der Stadt Rom&quot; (Description of the city of Rome; Vol. I, 1829). Besides a large number of archaeological papers in periodicals, in the &quot;Annali&quot; of the Institute of Rome, and in the &quot;Transactions&quot; of the Berlin Academy, and several illustrated catalogues of Greek, Roman and other antiquities in the Berlin, Naples and Vatican Museums, Gerhard was the author of the following works:
*&quot;Rapporto intorno i vasi Volcenti&quot; (1831)
*&quot;Antike Bildwerke&quot; (Stuttgart, 1827–1844)
*&quot;Auserlesene griechische Vasenbilder&quot; (1839—1858)
*&quot;Griechische und etruskische Trinkschalen&quot; (1843)
*&quot;Etruskische und campanische Vasenbilder&quot; (1843)
*&quot;Etruskische Spiegel&quot; (4 vols., 1843–68; 5th vol. by Klugmann et al., 1897)
*&quot;Apulische Vasen&quot; (1846)
*&quot;Trinkschalen und Gefässe&quot; (1850)
*&quot;Hyperboreisch-römische Studien&quot; (vol. i., 1833; vol. ii., 1852)
*&quot;Prodromus mythologische Kunsterklärung&quot; (Stuttgart and Tübingen, 1828)
*&quot;Griechische Mythologie&quot; (1854-1855)
*&quot;Gesammelte akademische Abhandlungen und kleine Schriften&quot;, published posthumously (2 vols., Berlin, 1867)

<text>Scott Frederick Turow (born April 12, 1949) is an American author and lawyer. Turow worked as a lawyer for a decade before writing full-time, and has written 13 fiction and three nonfiction books, which have been translated into more than 40 languages and sold more than 30 million copies. Turow’s novels are set primarily among the legal community in the fictional Kindle County. Films have been based on several of his books.

==Life and career==
Turow was born in Chicago, to a family of Belarusian Jewish descent. His father was an M.D., but it was his mother Rita whom he credits as serving as his &quot;beacon&quot; and shaping him with her &quot;love, support, and boundless faith in me.&quot; In contrast, his father wanted him to become a medical doctor. After &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; became successful, his father told him, &quot;I still think you could have gone to medical school.&quot; He attended New Trier High School and graduated from Amherst College in 1970, as a brother of the Alpha Delta Phi Literary Society. He received an Edith Mirrielees Fellowship to Stanford University’s Creative Writing Center, which he attended from 1970 to 1972.

Turow later became a Jones Lecturer at Stanford, serving until 1975, when he entered Harvard Law School. Turow became interested in law while writing a novel about a rent strike, in part because studying law helped him cope with the emotional abuse he received from his father as a child. In 1977, Turow wrote &quot;One L&quot;, a book about his first year at law school. After earning his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1978, Turow became an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Chicago, serving in that position until 1986. There, he prosecuted several high-profile corruption cases, including the tax fraud case of state Attorney General, William Scott. Turow was also lead counsel in Operation Greylord, the federal prosecution of judicial corruption cases in Illinois. 

After leaving the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office, Turow became a novelist and wrote the legal thrillers &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; (1987), &quot;The Burden of Proof&quot; (1990), &quot;Pleading Guilty&quot; (1993), and &quot;Personal Injuries&quot;, which &quot;Time&quot; magazine named as the Best Fiction Novel of 1999. All four books became bestsellers, and Turow won multiple literary awards, most notably the Silver Dagger Award of the British Crime Writers&#x27; Association.

In 1990, Turow was featured on the June 11 cover of &quot;Time&quot;, which described him as &quot;Bard of the Litigious Age&quot;. In 1995, Canadian author Derek Lundy published a biography of Turow, entitled &quot;Scott Turow: Meeting the Enemy&quot; (ECW Press, 1995). In the 1990s, a British publisher bracketed Turow’s work with that of Margaret Atwood and John Irving, republished in the series &quot;Bloomsbury Modern Library.&quot;

Turow was elected the President of the Authors Guild in 2010, which he was previously President of from 1997 to 1998. As the President of the Authors Guild, he has been criticized for his copyright maximalist and anti-ebook stance. Turow has often responded that he is not against e-books, and has shared that he, in fact, does the majority of his own reading electronically. According to Turow, he is interested in protecting writing as a livelihood.

From 1997 to 1998, Turow was a member of the U.S. Senate Nominations Commission for the Northern District of Illinois, which recommends federal judicial appointments. In 2011, Turow met with Harvard Law School professor, Lawrence Lessig, to discuss political reform, including a possible Second Constitutional Convention of the United States. According to one source, Turow saw risks with having such a convention, but he believed that it may be the &quot;only alternative&quot;, given his stance that campaign money can undermine the one man, one vote principle of democracy.

Turow is a retired partner of the international law firm Dentons having been a partner of one of its constituents, the Chicago law firm of Sonnenschein Nath &amp; Rosenthal. Much of Turow&#x27;s caseload work is pro bono, including a 1995 case, in which he won the release of Alejandro Hernandez, a man who spent 11 years on death row for a murder he did not commit. He was also appointed to the commission considering the reform of the Illinois death penalty by former Governor George Ryan. Additionally, Turow was the first Chair of the Illinois Executive Ethics Commission, and he served as one of the 14 members on the Commission, which was appointed in March of 2000, by Illinois Governor George Ryan to consider reform of the capital punishment system. Turow also served as a member of the Illinois State Police Merit Board 2000–2002.

<text>Hywel Rhodri Morgan (29 September 1939 – 17 May 2017) was a Welsh Labour politician who was the First Minister of Wales and the Leader of Welsh Labour from 2000 to 2009. He was also the Assembly Member for Cardiff West from 1999 to 2011 and the Member of Parliament for Cardiff West from 1987 to 2001. He remains the longest-serving First Minister of Wales, having served in the position for 9 years and 304 days. He was Chancellor of Swansea University from 2011 until his death in 2017.

==Early life and education==
Hywel Rhodri Morgan was born at Mrs Gill&#x27;s Nursing Home in Roath, Cardiff on 29 September 1939. He was the younger of two children born to the Welsh writer and academic Thomas John (T.J.) Morgan and his wife Huana Morgan (née Rees), a writer and schoolteacher. Morgan was born into a Welsh-speaking academic family. His native language was Welsh, though he later became fluent in English, French and German as well. His mother was one of the first women to study at University College, Swansea (now Swansea University), where she read Welsh. She became a schoolteacher in Rhymney before settling in Radyr after her retirement. Morgan&#x27;s father also read Welsh at University College, Swansea, before reading Old Irish at University College, Dublin (UCD). He became a Welsh language lecturer at the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire (now Cardiff University) and a Welsh language professor at University College, Swansea, where he also served as the vice-principal. He met Huana at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1926 and they married in 1935. Their first child, Morgan&#x27;s brother Prys Morgan, was born in Cardiff in 1937. He would grow up to become a history professor at Swansea University. Morgan was also related to the academic Garel Rhys, who was his second cousin.

=== Childhood and education ===
Morgan was raised with his brother Prys in the village of Radyr in outer Cardiff. Until the age of 21, he lived with his family at 32 Heol Isaf, in a house which sat on the main road of the village beside what is now a Methodist church. Morgan was born in the first month of World War II, and the conflict had a great presence in his life during his early childhood. He retained vivid memories of air raid sirens and prisoners of war into adulthood. He also had a lifelong love for gardening which began when he watched his father grow vegetables for the wartime dig for victory campaign. Radyr did, however, avoid the conflict&#x27;s worst hardships. Morgan had a mostly positive childhood, however he was often ill as an infant, and he almost died from pneumonia in 1942. As a child, Morgan was nicknamed &quot;fuzzy&quot; by his family and friends for his curly, frizzy hair.

In 1944, Morgan started attending Radyr Primary School. Having begun his education near the end of World War II, Morgan found his class in the first year of primary school was mostly populated by evacuees. In 2005, Morgan remarked that the school was &quot;like the League of Nations&quot; because of the refugees and evacuees in Radyr. The school was populated by a combination of evacuees and children from Radyr and Morganstown, another village in Cardiff, with the children from Morganstown accounting for 66% of its population. At the time, other children from Radyr would instead be sent to The Cathedral School in Llandaff, which was a private school. Morgan showed signs of intelligence at school, and he would be tracked two academic years ahead of his peers, sharing classes with his older brother Prys. He finished primary school in 1950 and passed his eleven-plus examination. He attended Whitchurch Grammar School, becoming one of the few children from Radyr to attend a school in Whitchurch at the time. At the grammar school, Morgan achieved high results in most subjects but science. He finished his secondary education there in 1957 after winning a place at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford on an open exhibition for the study of modern languages.

At Oxford, Morgan studied modern languages for two academic terms before becoming disinterested in the subject and changing his subject to philosophy, politics and economics (PPE). Morgan disliked the formal and ostentatious atmosphere of Oxford, and he later said he &quot;had more respect for a semi-retired porter … than for the college president&quot;. Morgan graduated from Oxford in 1961. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with second class honours in PPE. Morgan&#x27;s American friends from his time at Oxford convinced him to apply for a place at Harvard University. His second class honours was enough to secure him a place at Harvard to read a Master of Arts degree in government. Morgan&#x27;s studies in the United States were paid for through a scholarship. He graduated from the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences with a Master of Arts degree in government in 1963, before coming back to the United Kingdom in that year&#x27;s summer.

==== Early political involvement ====
Morgan&#x27;s interest in politics began when he was eleven or twelve years old. He had convinced his mother to take him to a local political meeting. At the meeting he saw Dorothy Rees, the Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Barry, shouted down by public school pupils who supported the Conservative Party, which made her cry. Morgan later recalled thinking: &quot;I&#x27;m going to nail those bastards&quot;. He was an active member of the Oxford University Labour Club and is said to have discouraged other students at Oxford from joining Plaid Cymru. By the time Morgan finished his studies at Harvard, he had decided to pursue his political interests practically rather than academically. He joined the Labour Party in December 1963, where he became a member of the constituency Labour Party for Cardiff South East.

==Early career==
Morgan returned to the United Kingdom in the summer of 1963, where he took up his first job as a tutor organiser for the Workers&#x27; Educational Association (WEA), which was then a training ground for future Labour Party MPs. He was responsible for organising the association&#x27;s tutors in South Wales. In December, Morgan attended a local Labour Party meeting where he met Labour activists Julie Edwards and Neil Kinnock, the future leader of the Labour Party. In the same month, Morgan moved into a flat in Cardiff, which he shared with Kinnock and two other local Labour Party activists until 1965. Together, the flatmates engaged in anti-apartheid activism. In the 1964 general election, Morgan campaigned with Edwards, Kinnock and Kinnock&#x27;s partner Glenys in support of James Callaghan, the Labour MP for Cardiff South East who later became prime minister. Morgan pursued a relationship with Edwards and after three years of campaigning together they married on 22 April 1967. They had their first child, Mari, in 1968, and a second child, Siani, in 1969. They also had an adopted son, Stuart, who was born in 1969 or 1970.
In 1966, Morgan was considered for selection as the Labour Party&#x27;s prospective parliamentary candidate for Cardiff North, though he was ultimately not selected. At the time, Morgan did not have a strong interest in a parliamentary career, and whilst Kinnock and other former WEA workers quickly became MPs, he instead wanted to spend time with his family. By the time of the 1970 general election he had a wife and three children, and he may have believed that a parliamentary career and its instabilities would take too much time away from them. He left the WEA in 1965, taking up jobs as a research officer for Cardiff City Council, the Welsh Office and the Department of the Environment in that order, remaining in this field of work until 1971. At the Welsh Office, Morgan authored documents to expand the M4 motorway through parts of South Wales. He also contributed to the creation of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre in Wales, as well as the relocation of the Royal Mint and a part of the Inland Revenue to Wales. In addition to his work as a research officer at Cardiff City Council, Morgan was also a junior town planner. He reported to the Cardiff City Planning Department. 
In 1972, Morgan became a civil servant at the Department of Trade and Industry where he worked for Christopher Chataway as an economic adviser. He remained at the department until 1974. In 1974, Morgan became the industrial development officer for South Glamorgan County Council, which he said was his &quot;dream job&quot;. He stopped working for the council in 1980. From 1980 to 1987 Morgan worked at the European Commission&#x27;s Office for Wales as the head of its press and information bureau. His ability to speak German, Welsh and French proved useful. In this role, he was the highest paid civil servant in Wales.

Morgan&#x27;s work had permitted him to keep living in Cardiff while staying politically active as a neutral civil servant. However, he was still interested in partisan politics, and he was thinking about standing as an MP. In 1985, Morgan decided to stand for parliament after his wife was elected as a councillor for South Glamorgan County Council. James Callaghan had announced his plans to retire from his seat, Cardiff South and Penarth, at the next general election, and Morgan intended to take over from Callaghan as Labour&#x27;s candidate for the seat. However, another contender had already been promised local support by the Labour Party. Morgan was encouraged to seek selection in the seat of Cardiff West instead. He was successfully nominated for selection as Labour&#x27;s candidate in Cardiff West, beating contenders such as Ivor Richard, the United Kingdom&#x27;s former ambassador to the United Nations, where he would stand in the 1987 general election.

== Parliamentary career ==

In the 1987 general election, Morgan was elected as the Labour MP for Cardiff West, defeating the incumbent Conservative MP Stefan Terlezki, who had been elected in the 1983 general election. Morgan won the seat with a majority of 4,045 votes (9.1%). He increased his majority to 9,291 (20.3%) in the 1992 general election and 15,628 (38.8%) in the 1997 general election. He was sponsored by the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union and shared an office at Transport House with Alun Michael, the Labour MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, following their election to parliament in 1987. He was joined in parliament by his wife Julie following the 1997 general election, when she was elected as the Labour MP for Cardiff North.

Morgan made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 8 July 1987, during a debate on a Finance Bill. The media developed a liking for Morgan; &quot;The Times&quot; reviewed the maiden speeches of the 1987 parliamentary intake and placed Morgan&#x27;s maiden speech into joint-first place. He established a reputation for being a &quot;maverick&quot; and a witty and outspoken &quot;loose-cannon&quot;. In line with the majority of backbench MPs from Wales, Morgan aligned himself with the soft left of the Labour Party. He was associated with the &quot;Riverside Mafia&quot;, a group of soft left Labour councillors in South Glamorgan County Council which included Mark Drakeford, Jane Hutt, Sue Essex and Morgan&#x27;s wife Julie. Morgan&#x27;s main interests as an MP were industrial policy, regional policy, regional development, health, European affairs, the environment, and the conservation of wild life, particularly marine life and birds. He also had an interest in freedom of information.

=== Cardiff Bay Barrage campaign ===
An early challenge for Morgan during his parliamentary career was the controversial Cardiff Bay Barrage project. Mark Drakeford and Jane Hutt were suspended by the leadership of the Labour group in South Glamorgan County Council for opposing the scheme. The council had been promoting the project with the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation, with both organisations claiming that the barrage would regenerate the Cardiff Docklands. Its opponents, meanwhile, claimed that it would be costly and potentially damaging to the environment. Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock and Labour MP for Cardiff South and Penarth Alun Michael, whose constituency included the site where the new bay would be formed, both supported the project. However, the constituency Labour Party for Cardiff West, Morgan&#x27;s own constituency, had voted to oppose the barrage, and the local Labour Party branches for Riverside and Canton were also against it.

On 3 July 1989, Morgan announced his opposition to the barrage, stating that it was wrong &quot;to subject my constituents to disturbance for something of extremely doubtful value&quot;. Morgan was concerned about the differing opinions from geologists on the barrage&#x27;s possible effects. He was a naturalist who found the bay&#x27;s mudflats to be of value, and he believed that damming it could cause a permanent increase in drainage, damp and rot. Morgan also believed that the barrage could flood Cardiff West, with the constituency having had a history of damaging floods as recent as 1979. He became the spokesman for a group of Labour councillors in Cardiff City Council and South Glamorgan County Council who opposed the project, and in parliament he led a five year campaign against the bill which would allow for its construction. Using parliamentary procedure and filibusters, Morgan was able to delay the construction of the barrage until the Conservative government finally pushed the bill through parliament in 1993. Morgan&#x27;s campaign against the bill generated animosity between him and Alun Michael, who had supported the barrage, and it made him appear less trustworthy to the more centrist-leaning elements of the Labour Party. In 1993, Morgan warned John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, that a Labour government might stop the construction of the barrage before its completion. This prompted Michael to state that he was &quot;fed up&quot; with Morgan&#x27;s &quot;outrageous and irresponsible nonsense&quot;, adding that his remarks could deter employers from coming to Cardiff.

=== Shadow ministerial career ===
In his first year in parliament, Morgan worked on standing committees for the Finance Bill, the Housing Bill and the Steel Privatisation Bill. Labour leader Neil Kinnock rewarded Morgan for this work by appointing him to Labour&#x27;s shadow energy team on 10 November 1988. He became a junior shadow minister for energy, where he was given responsibility for Labour&#x27;s response to the government&#x27;s electricity privatisation policy. When taking the role, Morgan said he intended to scrutinise the government&#x27;s plans for electricity privatisation as he found &quot;no virtues in converting a public monopoly into a private sector monopoly&quot; and wanted to find &quot;a better deal for consumers&quot;. During Morgan&#x27;s tenure, the shadow energy team opposed electricity privatisation. He spoke beyond his brief, asking why Wales received less investment than Cornwall and Devon and exploring a now disproven conspiracy theory that the Spandau prisoner believed to be Nazi German deputy Führer Rudolf Hess was an imposter.

In the shadow energy team, Morgan initially worked under Tony Blair, the shadow secretary of state for energy from 1988 to 1989. He then worked under Frank Dobson, the shadow energy secretary from 1989 to 1992. According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, Morgan and Blair worked &quot;harmoniously&quot; together. In contrast, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; said Morgan &quot;antagonised [Blair] at every step&quot;. Morgan himself believed that he was &quot;highly regarded&quot; by Blair. He supported Blair&#x27;s attempt to get elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party in 1992 and voted for Blair during his campaign for the Labour leadership in 1994, which he won. 

On 30 July 1992, the recently elected Labour leader John Smith appointed Morgan as a shadow minister for Welsh affairs. He remained in this post after Tony Blair became Labour leader in 1994. At first, Morgan worked under Ann Clwyd, the shadow secretary of state for Wales from July 1992 to November 1992. He then worked under Ron Davies, the shadow welsh secretary from November 1992, serving as his deputy. He was also given responsibility for Labour&#x27;s health policy in Wales.

In the Welsh affairs brief, Morgan targeted quangos in Wales for their alleged cronyism, unaccountability and lack of democracy. These quangos were unelected, publicly funded organisations whose leaders were appointed by the Conservative government. Under John Redwood&#x27;s tenure as Welsh secretary, the Welsh Office was criticised for presiding over a large increase over the amount of quangos in the country, with people sympathetic to the Conservative Party often appointed to lead them. In 1979, there were 44 quangos in Wales. By 1994, there were 111. Quangos came to dominate Wales. In 1994, Morgan claimed that government plans would result in there being more people sitting on quangos than local councillors in the country. He refused to vote for the Welsh Language Act 1993; the act&#x27;s main purpose was to set up a new quango called the Welsh Language Board. Morgan said Labour would abstain on the act &quot;because we hope to have the opportunity before long to do the job properly. That will be done when we revisit the question of a Welsh language measure when we are in Government.&quot; When William Hague was Welsh secretary, Morgan staged a protest with other Welsh Labour MPs outside the 1996 Conservative Party Conference, where he claimed that the total cost of the quangos in Wales had reached £51.5 million.

To tackle the cost of the Welsh quangos, Morgan stated in 1996 that a devolved Welsh Assembly established by a Labour government would combine four quangos, the Welsh Development Agency, the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation, the Development Board for Rural Wales and the Land Authority for Wales to create an &quot;economic powerhouse&quot;. The idea of establishing a devolved Welsh Assembly had been supported by Morgan, who was one of its leading proponents. He was involved in talks with the upper ranks of the Labour Party on devolution, becoming an important figure in drawing up its devolution policy for Wales. In the Welsh affairs brief, he campaigned for Welsh devolution, helping move the proposal for a Welsh Assembly further up the Labour Party&#x27;s policy platform. He was a member of the Campaign for the Welsh Assembly and supported Wales Labour Action, a pressure group within the Labour Party that called for the establishment of a Welsh Assembly.

Morgan&#x27;s opposition to the Welsh quangos, as well as his attempts to stop the construction of the Cardiff Bay Barrage, alienated the traditionalists within the Labour Party in Wales. These actions also made him a known troublemaker towards the Welsh political establishment. In Cardiff, Morgan faced hostility from the local political establishment in the Labour Party. He ultimately found the 1992–1997 parliament more challenging than the previous parliament. He had a difficult relationship with some of Tony Blair&#x27;s inner circle, including his close confidant Alun Michael and his closest adviser Peter Mandelson.

=== Return to the backbenches ===
In the 1997 general election, the Labour Party secured a landslide victory against the Conservative Party, returning to government after 18 years in opposition. Morgan had been aspiring to become a government minister since at least 1994, and when Labour returned to government he was expected to be given a role in the Welsh Office as a junior minister. However, in what was viewed as a surprising decision, Prime Minister Tony Blair refused to give Morgan a role in the government. Ron Davies, the Welsh secretary in the new government, had wanted to keep Morgan in his team as a junior minister, but Blair refused to appoint him to such a role. At the time, Blair&#x27;s official explanation was that Morgan, aged 57, was too old for a ministerial career. However, in a 2017 interview with &quot;BBC News&quot;, Blair revealed that he did not appoint Morgan to the government because they disagreed on policy, adding that he viewed himself as a progressive politician bringing change while he viewed Morgan as a traditionalist. Morgan returned to the backbenches where he was elected chair of the House of Commons Public Administration Committee as a consolation prize.

In his later parliamentary career as a backbencher, Morgan provoked the Labour government for its hesitance to ban the advertising of cigarettes, its unenthusiastic approach to freedom of information and for the party&#x27;s parliamentary selection process.

=== Welsh Labour leadership campaigns ===
Labour&#x27;s election manifesto for the 1997 general election included a commitment to hold a devolution referendum in Wales to determine whether to establish a devolved Welsh assembly. In the 1997 Welsh devolution referendum, Morgan campaigned for the &quot;Yes&quot; vote. He was also considering standing for election to the assembly if the referendum passed. The referendum resulted in a narrow majority in favour, which led to the passing of the Government of Wales Act 1998 and the formation of the devolved National Assembly for Wales in 1999. Morgan decided to put his name forward as Labour&#x27;s candidate for the assembly seat of Cardiff West, which had the same name and boundaries as his seat in the House of Commons. He was subsequently identified as a likely contender to become the first leader of the assembly, known as the First Secretary of Wales.

Following the result of the 1997 devolution referendum, Morgan immediately decided to run for the leadership of the Labour Party in Wales. This meant that he was also running to become the inaugural first secretary of Wales, as Labour was expected to win the most seats in the first election to the assembly. Leading the assembly had been a long-held ambition of Morgan&#x27;s. However, the favourite to become first secretary was the Welsh secretary Ron Davies, who was viewed as the architect of the government&#x27;s plans for the devolved assembly. In March 1998, Davies announced his intention to stand for a seat in the assembly and run for the post of first secretary. Morgan then called for a leadership election to determine who the party&#x27;s candidate for first secretary would be. Senior figures in the Labour Party in Wales feared that a leadership election could split the party and instead preferred to avoid an election, with Davies running for the post of first secretary unopposed. However, Morgan continued to insist on a leadership election, stating that he had already announced his intention to become first secretary before Davies did.

Campaigning for the 1998 Welsh Labour leadership election began in March 1998 and lasted until September. In his leadership pitch, Morgan cited his administrative experience in London, Europe, local government and the Welsh Office. He also presented himself as the &quot;new beginning, anti-establishment&quot; candidate and as the &quot;unity&quot; candidate. Davies had the support of Tony Blair and the party machinery of the Labour Party and was viewed as the establishment candidate. Morgan also presented himself as the &quot;democratic&quot; candidate, as he had campaigned for the election to be held under the one member, one vote electoral system. However, senior figures in the Labour Party in Wales decided to hold the election under an electoral college with block voting, which was decried as &quot;undemocratic&quot; by Davies&#x27; opponents. Support for Davies came from the large trade unions such as Unison and the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union and from the majority of Labour MPs, MEPs and Welsh assembly candidates. Support for Morgan came from the smaller trade unions, the constituency membership and the party grassroots. Ideologically, both Morgan and Davies were on the soft left of the Labour Party.

In September 1998, Davies won the leadership election, therefore becoming the Labour Party in Wales&#x27; candidate for first secretary. Morgan had won the most nominations from the constituency Labour parties, as well as the membership vote across the constituency parties which held a membership ballot, but the electoral college left him with 31.78% of the vote to Davies&#x27; 68.22%. Davies would resign from the cabinet and the leadership six weeks later after being involved in an alleged gay sex scandal on Clapham Common. Tony Blair appointed Alun Michael as Welsh secretary and planned for him to become the first secretary without a leadership election. Blair appointed Michael, a Blairite, to prevent Morgan from taking the leadership. Michael invited Morgan and another likely contender for the post, Wayne David, to serve with him as his deputies. Morgan declined Michael&#x27;s offer and insisted on another leadership election. Blair met with Morgan and tried to convince him not to stand, but Morgan rejected this appeal and continued his leadership campaign.

The 1999 Welsh Labour leadership election took place in February 1999. It was a repeat of the 1998 leadership contest in several ways. Morgan once again presented himself as the &quot;anti-establishment&quot; candidate. He also presented himself as the choice of the Welsh people. In contrast, Michael was widely seen as a reluctant parachute candidate from London who was imposed on Wales by the Labour Party leadership. In actuality, both Michael and Morgan were native Welsh speakers from Wales who shared a long-standing commitment to Welsh devolution. Morgan was described as the left-wing &quot;Old Labour&quot; candidate while Michael was described as the centrist &quot;New Labour&quot; candidate. Although Michael had by this point become a Blairite, both candidates had their origins in the soft left of the Labour Party. There was also some animosity between them, as Morgan had been a leading campaigner against the Cardiff Bay Barrage project while Michael had been a leading campaigner in support of it.

== Assembly career ==
=== First Assembly (1999) ===

A committed supporter of Welsh devolution, Morgan contested the position of Labour&#x27;s nominee for the (then titled) First Secretary for Wales. He lost to the then Secretary of State for Wales, Ron Davies. Davies was then forced to resign his position after an alleged sex scandal, whereupon Morgan again ran for the post. His opponent, Alun Michael, the new Secretary of State for Wales, was seen as a reluctant participant despite also having a long-standing commitment to Welsh devolution, and was widely regarded as being the choice of the UK leadership of the Labour Party.

Michael was duly elected to the leadership but resigned a little more than a year later, amid threats of an imminent no-confidence vote and alleged plotting against him by members of not only his own party, but also Assembly groups and Cabinet members. Morgan, who had served as Minister for Economic Development under Michael, became Labour&#x27;s new nominee for First Secretary, and was elected in February 2000, later becoming First Minister on 16 October 2000 when the position was retitled. He was also appointed to the Privy Council in July 2000.

Morgan stepped down from the House of Commons at the 2001 General Election.

Morgan&#x27;s leadership was characterised by a willingness to distance himself from a number of aspects of UK Labour Party policy, particularly in relation to plans to introduce choice and competition into public services, which he has argued do not fit Welsh attitudes and values, and would not work effectively in a smaller and more rural country. In a speech given in Swansea to the National Centre for Public Policy in November 2002, Morgan stated his opposition to foundation hospitals (a UK Labour proposal), and referred to the &quot;Clear Red Water&quot; separating policies in Wales and in Westminster.

=== Second Assembly (2003) ===

On 1 May 2003, Labour under Morgan&#x27;s leadership was re-elected in the Assembly elections. Morgan managed to win enough seats to form a Labour-only administration (the election was held under proportional representation, and Labour won 30 of the 60 seats in the Assembly and the overall majority was achieved when Dafydd Elis-Thomas AM was elected Presiding Officer of the Assembly) and named his cabinet on 9 May. In that election, Labour easily took back all of the former strongholds they lost to Plaid Cymru at the height of Alun Michael&#x27;s unpopularity in 1999.

In his second term, Morgan&#x27;s administration continued its theme of &quot;Welsh solutions for Welsh problems&quot;, a marked contrast to the Blairite public service reform agenda. Instead of competition, Welsh Labour emphasised the need for collaboration between public service providers.

=== Third Assembly (2007) ===
Labour was the biggest party with 26 out of the 60 seats, five short of an overall majority. After one month of minority government, Morgan signed a coalition agreement (&quot;One Wales&quot;) with Ieuan Wyn Jones, leader of Plaid Cymru, on 27 June 2007. Morgan became the first modern political leader of Wales to lead an Assembly with powers to pass primary legislation (subject to consent from Westminster).

=== Retirement ===

In July 2005, Morgan announced his intention to lead the Welsh Labour party into the 2007 general election, but retire as leader of Welsh Labour and First Minister sometime in 2009, when he would be 70. On his 70th birthday (29 September) he set the exact date as immediately following the Assembly&#x27;s budget session on 8 December 2009. Counsel General Carwyn Jones, Health Minister Edwina Hart and Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney AM Huw Lewis entered a leadership contest to elect a new Labour leader in Wales. On 1 December 2009 the winner was declared as Carwyn Jones, who assumed office as First Minister on 10 December 2009. Morgan remained a backbench AM until April 2011, when the third Assembly was dissolved before the general election on 5 May 2011.

== Personal life ==
Morgan married Julie Morgan (née Edwards) in 1967. Julie would later have her own political career as an AM and MP, joining Morgan in the House of Commons in 1997. The couple had two daughters, Mari and Siani, and an adopted son, Stuart. Mari was born in 1968 and became a scientist while Siani was born in 1969 and became a charity worker. Stuart, born in 1969 or 1970, was troubled and had multiple convictions. Morgan also had eight grandchildren and a Labrador named William Tell. His elder brother Prys Morgan was a history professor at Swansea University and his second cousin Garel Rhys was an academic.

After marriage, Morgan settled at Dinas Powys. From 1986, he then lived with his wife and children at Lower House, a former farmhouse in the countryside of Michaelston-le-Pit. The home was known for being untidy and disorganised, with friends reportedly describing it as a &quot;tip&quot;. The couple also had a caravan in Mwnt, on the coast of Ceredigion, where the family holidayed each summer for at least 40 years. Morgan was a long-time friend of Neil Kinnock, leader of the Labour Party from 1983 to 1992. In their younger years, they were part of a rock band together. They shared a flat in Cardiff from 1963 to 1965. Morgan was also a long-time friend of the former AM Sue Essex.

In July 2007, Morgan had an unstable angina which caused a partial blockage in two of his arteries and a heart attack. He was admitted to hospital where he underwent cardiac surgery and had two stent implants to unblock his arteries. Even though he left hospital within the week, doctors said he would not be fully recovered for a few weeks.

==Death==

Morgan collapsed on the evening of 17 May 2017 while cycling on Road, Wenvoe, near his home. Police and paramedics were called to the scene and he was pronounced dead. He was 77.

Morgan&#x27;s family held a humanist funeral for him, in line with his humanist beliefs, at the Welsh Assembly on 31 May, which was open on a first-come first-served basis to the public, as well as broadcast on screens outside the Senedd and online. The funeral was televised and billed as a major national event. The ceremony was led by Morgan&#x27;s friend and former Welsh Labour colleague Lorraine Barrett. A private service of committal was held at Thornhill Crematorium&#x27;s Wenallt Chapel in Cardiff the next day.

==Honorary degrees==

Morgan was awarded several honorary degrees for his service to the United Kingdom, including the following.

He was also appointed Chancellor of Swansea University in 2011, a post he held until his death. He had close links with the university as both his parents had graduated from it in the 1920s and his father and brother also taught there.

<doc id="209404" wikidata="Q1757786" url="?curid=209404" title="The Get Up Kids">
<text>The Get Up Kids are an American rock band from Kansas City. Formed in 1995, the band was a major act in the mid-1990s Midwest emo scene, otherwise known as the &quot;second wave&quot; of emo music. Their second album &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; remains their most widely acclaimed album, and is considered to be one of the quintessential albums of the second-wave emo movement. They are considered forefathers of the emo genre, and have been widely credited as being an influence, both by contemporaries Saves the Day and later bands such as Fall Out Boy, Taking Back Sunday and the Wonder Years.

As they gained prominence, they began touring with bands such as Green Day and Weezer before becoming headliners themselves, eventually embarking on international tours of Japan and Europe. They founded Heroes &amp; Villains Records, an imprint of the successful indie rock label Vagrant Records. While the imprint was started to release albums by the Get Up Kids, it served as a launching pad for several side-projects such as the New Amsterdams and Reggie and the Full Effect.

The band departed heavily from their established style with the release of their 2002 album &quot;On a Wire&quot;, which saw the band take on a much more layered, alternative rock sound. Like many early emo bands, the Get Up Kids sought to dissociate themselves from the term &quot;emo.&quot;

Due to internal conflicts, the band broke up in 2005. Three years later, the band reunited to support the tenth anniversary re-release of &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot;, and soon afterward entered the studio to write new material. In early 2010, the band released &quot;Simple Science&quot;, their first release in six years, followed in 2011 by the full-length &quot;There Are Rules&quot;. Their most recent studio album, &quot;Problems&quot;, which was seen by many as a return to their early style, was released in 2019.

== History ==
=== Early years (1995–1997) ===

While in high school, Ryan Pope, Rob Pope, and Jim Suptic formed a short-lived band called Kingpin. Matt Pryor had been writing songs since he was a teenager, and was playing in a band called Secret Decoder Ring. Following the demise of the two bands in 1995, the Get Up Kids were formed. The band originally planned on calling themselves the Suburban Get Up Kids until reasoning that there were fewer band names beginning with the letter &#x27;G&#x27; than there are with the letter &#x27;S&#x27;, and that therefore they were more likely to be noticed in a record store if their name began with a &#x27;G&#x27;. The band was formed on October 14, 1995, on Suptic&#x27;s 18th birthday. They played their first show supporting Mineral on the same night as their high school prom.

At the time the lineup consisted of Pryor on guitar and lead vocals, Suptic on guitar, Rob Pope on bass, and Thomas Becker on drums. However, Becker soon left for college in California, and was replaced by Nathan Shay, who was attending school with Suptic at the Kansas City Art Institute. In 1995, Pryor, Suptic, and friend Kevin Zelko saved money to self-release &quot;Shorty/The Breathing Method&quot;, their first 7-inch. However, due to an unwillingness to tour, Shay was replaced by Rob&#x27;s younger brother Ryan in April 1996.

The band became increasingly popular in the burgeoning underground Midwestern music scene, forming strong relationships with bands such as Rocket Fuel Is the Key, Coalesce and Braid. After the &quot;Shorty&quot; 7-inch, the band released &quot;A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts&quot; on Contrast Records. Encouraged by interest stirred by the band&#x27;s first 7-inch, they recorded their first EP, &quot;Woodson&quot;. Shortly afterward, Contrast Records released a 7-inch titled &quot;A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts&quot;, with Doghouse Records releasing a CD-EP version which combined both 7-inches. After &quot;Woodson&quot;, Doghouse approached the band with a two-album contract, offering them $4,000 to record their first full-length album.

=== &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot; (1997–1998) ===
After signing to Doghouse, the band drove to Chicago to record their debut full-length album with producer Bob Weston of Shellac. The album was recorded in only two days, with the band leaving on Friday after Ryan Pope got out of school and finishing in the early hours of Sunday morning. Two months after recording the album, the band embarked on their first national tour with Braid and Ethel Meserve with the first date of the tour taking place the day after Ryan&#x27;s high school graduation.

It was on that tour that the band met James Dewees, the new drummer for Coalesce while the bands were playing together in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. After the show, the members of the two bands became close friends, eventually leading them to record a split 7-inch produced by Ed Rose entitled &quot;The Get Up Kids / Coalesce&quot;. For the split, each band covered one of the other&#x27;s songs in their own style. Coalesce did a post-hardcore cover of &quot;Second Place&quot;, and the Get Up Kids recorded a power-pop rendition of &quot;Harvest of Maturity&quot;.

The band continued to tour relentlessly, making connections with the likes of Jimmy Eat World, Mineral, and Boys Life, largely playing basement shows and building a dedicated fan base through word of mouth. In September 1997 the band released their debut full-length record &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot;. The album sold over 40,000 copies in two years, a major feat for such a small label, which began to bring attention from larger labels. The band was invited to join Braid on their 1998 tour of Europe, their first tour outside of the contiguous United States.

While the band was receiving rapidly increasing national and international attention, they became unhappy with Doghouse Records&#x27; ability to keep up with the increasing popularity of the band. The Get Up Kids&#x27; announcement to leave Doghouse Records brought interest from prominent record labels including Sub Pop, Geffen and Mojo Records. The band made a decision to sign to Mojo, but before the contracts were signed, they began to have second thoughts. The main issue was over the label&#x27;s insistence on owning merchandising rights, a large source of the band&#x27;s income. Moreover, the band was insulted the label requested they re-record &quot;Don&#x27;t Hate Me&quot; from &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot; for their next record, feeling that the label believed it was &quot;the best that [they could] write&quot;. Before the deal with Mojo was official, the band met Rich Egan, founder of Los Angeles–based Vagrant Records. He convinced the band to sign to Vagrant instead, offering them $50,000 to record a second album, as well as their own imprint, Heroes &amp; Villains Records. Reflecting on the decision in 2000, Rob Pope said, &quot;...the more we thought about it, the more we realized that we wanted our band to have a career, not just one big shot where you put everything into one record.&quot;

=== &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; (1999–2001) ===

In 1998, James Dewees recorded his first solo album under the pseudonym Reggie and the Full Effect. While Dewees wrote the songs himself, he asked Matt Pryor and Rob Pope to help record some of the instrumentals. The resulting album, Greatest Hits 1984-1987 leaned heavily on the use of synthesizer keyboards for its sound. Their work together on the Reggie and the Full Effect album led Pryor to invite Dewees to collaborate with the Get Up Kids on &quot;Red Letter Day&quot;, a five-track EP produced by Ed Rose to fulfill their two-record deal with Doghouse. The cleaner, more focused sound of the EP provided the chance to experiment with the inclusion of keyboards and acts as a sonic bridge between the raw sound of &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot; and the more dynamic, produced style of their next studio album.

After the release of &quot;Red Letter Day&quot;, Dewees became a full-time member as the band began recording their second studio album in Los Angeles in June 1999 with producer Alex Brahl. Before the album went into production, Vagrant Records co-owner John Cohen borrowed money from his parents, who had mortgaged their house in order to fund the production of the album. On September 21, 1999, the band released &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; on Vagrant Records. The album&#x27;s lyrics reflected the record label strife the band had experienced and their distance between friends and family back home after their move to Los Angeles. &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; has been singled out as the band&#x27;s only &#x27;true&#x27; emo album, as the album&#x27;s aesthetic fit more into the contemporary definition of the genre. Furthermore, the album single-handedly turned the struggling Vagrant label into one of the top indie labels in the country, selling over 140,000 copies after its release. Not only did the album make the Get Up Kids the poster children for emo, but it also launched the genre into a public consciousness broader than the scattered local scenes that had previously embraced it. The album gave Vagrant Records the financial backing to grow and sign a string of other bands. At the same time, the addition of keyboards alienated some fans who thought it moved the band away from the contemporary punk scene&#x27;s DIY ethic.

The Get Up Kids toured nonstop for almost three years in promotion of the record. As well as touring Europe, Japan, and Australia, they shared bills with acts such as Green Day, the Anniversary, Hot Rod Circuit, Jebediah, Weezer and Ozma. Their 2000 tour with the Anniversary and Koufax was sponsored by Napster. Their fanbase kept expanding through word of mouth. Venues booked months in advance could no longer hold the demand by the time the band arrived in town and fans were forced to stand outside to see them perform. The strength of the album&#x27;s sales eventually led Interscope Records to purchase a minority stake in Vagrant, and cemented the label&#x27;s credibility with other up-and-coming bands.

To capitalize on anticipation for the band&#x27;s next album, Vagrant Records released a rarities compilation &quot;Eudora&quot; in 2001. &quot;Eudora&quot; consisted of alternate takes, covers, and B-sides since the band&#x27;s formation. Likewise, Doghouse released a re-mastered edition of &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot; and a compilation entitled &quot;The EPs: Woodson and Red Letter Day&quot;, combining the two Doghouse-owned EPs on one compact disc.

=== &quot;On a Wire&quot; (2002–2003) ===
After three years of touring for &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot;, the band was beginning to feel burned-out and wished to depart from the upbeat power-pop sound with which they had become associated. They also began to broaden their musical horizons, taking much greater influence from classic rock artists like Led Zeppelin; &quot;Our musical tastes were expanding, and our songwriting reflected that. We were discovering older bands that were new to us,&quot; said Pryor in 2021. According to Rob Pope, &quot;It was a weird time. We were a bunch of 19, 20, 21-year-old kids...It was this weird formative era where we were challenged by a totally different thing than Thurston Moore and Ian Mackaye. &quot;We were all going through our, like bullshit Beatles phase, and unfortunately we were doing that in public.&quot;

Speaking about the change in the band&#x27;s dynamic and artistry around this time, Pryor believes &quot;[Rob &amp; Ryan Pope&#x27;s] musicianship and the way [they] were, like, locking together took a much more mature jump from &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; to &quot;On a Wire,&quot; Jim was starting to become more of a lead guitar player, we were thinking about it more. We were conceptualizing it more.&quot; The band spent a great deal more time than in the past demoing songs, eventually sending them to their manager Rich Egan, who was skeptical of the new sound. He told them &quot;You guys can make an art record if you want to, but I&#x27;m just saying, this is a drastic turn from your previous material.&quot;

The band decided to look for a new producer to work with on their third album, wanting to make a more cohesive, &quot;produced&quot; record than their previous material. They put together a list of producers, including Stephen Street &amp; John Leckie. The band formally approached Nigel Godrich and Gil Norton with offers, although both declined. They approached Jerry Finn, citing his work on the Superdrag album &quot;Head Trip in Every Key&quot;. Finally, the band settled on Scott Litt, best known for his work with R.E.M., the Replacements and Nirvana. &quot;I remember we were like, &#x27;we want to make the biggest record ever,&quot; recalls Rob Pope. &quot;We had it in our heads at that point that we wanted to be on the radio. Scott Litt had a pretty good success rate with that.&quot;

Litt came to Lawrence, Kansas to do extensive pre-production on the record, before going to Bridgeport, Connecticut in early February for the recording sessions at Litt&#x27;s suggestion. The album was recorded at Tarquin Studios, with studio owner and later Grammy Award-winning producer Peter Katis engineering. The band lived in the studio for the duration of the record, recording for four weeks. &quot;It was freezing cold, and I don&#x27;t think I left a one-block radius very often. It was kind of depressing,&quot; said Pope. Pryor had to leave after recording for the birth of his daughter, while Rob &amp; Ryan Pope stayed behind to mix the album with Litt and Katis. The process became increasingly contentious, with Litt clashing with the band members. &quot;There were some very questionable decisions in the mixing process. Engineering and tracking with Scott was hard for us, and then mixing with him was like, &#x27;that&#x27;s the reverb choice you&#x27;re making on this snare? Which decade are we in?&#x27;&quot;

The band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;On a Wire&quot; was released on May 14, 2002, debuting a more measured, alternative style. Just as &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; alienated some fans with its more produced sound, &quot;On a Wire&quot; was criticized by fans who were disappointed with the album&#x27;s softer musical direction. Specifically, the reviewer for &quot;Alternative Press&quot; wrote &quot;Unfortunately, the visceral energy of their early days is lost in their newfound maturity.&quot;

While many fans were upset with this sudden change of direction, the album was generally well-received by mainstream publications. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was highly positive, writing that &quot;This is the group at their best.&quot; In his review of the album, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Barry Walters wrote &quot;&quot;On a Wire&quot; quivers with the anxieties that must have arisen as the Get Up Kids left behind what originally made them. Straining vocals, racing tempos and walls of distortion give way to softer singing, spacious guitars and prominent keyboards . . . The Get Up Kids dig deeper into themselves. What they find is often subtle, less visceral but far more tender.&quot;

The poor public reception of the album had a larger impact on the band&#x27;s popularity as a whole. The band embarked on a tour to promote the album in the late spring soon after the album was released, only to find that they had far less support from both their fans and their record label. Using the financial and critical success of &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot;, Vagrant signed several other headlining emo bands such as Alkaline Trio, Dashboard Confessional, and Saves the Day. The Get Up Kids were no longer the label&#x27;s top priority, and certainly not after the lukewarm reception of &quot;On a Wire&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, lead singer Matt Pryor considered the dramatic change in style on &quot;On a Wire&quot; seriously dented the momentum the band had built up since &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot;, allowing later bands such as Dashboard Confessional to take much of the fan base that the Get Up Kids had previously earned. In an interview, Pryor confessed that he did not think that &quot;anyone, including Vagrant, gave that record a chance&quot;. Even though they had avoided the term since its inception, it was at this point the band actively began trying to shed the term &quot;emo&quot;, a word that had defined them for years but had come to be associated with more pop-oriented acts. Pryor commented on the album, saying &quot;We really didn&#x27;t give two shits if anyone liked the record or not, we were really confident that we were going to kill this &#x27;emo&#x27; stigma that we had and take the people with open minds with us and leave everyone else in the dust.&quot;

In 2021, speaking on their stubbornness, Pryor admitted &quot;I think if anyone told us we were making a bad decision, we would have fired them.&quot;

=== &quot;Guilt Show&quot; (2003–2004) ===
In 2003 the band began recording their fourth studio album. The band used the label&#x27;s advance money to purchase Black Lodge Studios in Eudora, Kansas, a studio they renovated and went on to own with longtime producer Ed Rose. The writing process for the album was different from their past efforts, as most of the songs were written by only three of the band members. In the early stages of writing, Jim Suptic was on his honeymoon. James Dewees was involved in a difficult divorce, and much of his creative efforts inspired by those events went into the fourth Reggie and the Full Effect album &quot;Songs Not to Get Married To&quot;. While this led to a less collaborative effort than in the past, it gave the Pope brothers a more substantial role in writing than ever before. In an interview with &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, Pryor confirmed the song &quot;Never Be Alone&quot; was written by Rob Pope about his 2003 divorce from Anniversary keyboardist Adrianne Verhoeven.

This fractured approach to the writing process began to strain relationships in the band, at one point leading Suptic to consider quitting the band. Pryor drew lyrical inspiration from the lives of friends and people he knew, extracting stories of abuse, betrayal and guilt. The album&#x27;s lyrics also delve into incidents of adultery (&quot;Wouldn&#x27;t Believe It&quot;, &quot;How Long Is Too Long&quot;) and the album&#x27;s first single &quot;The One You Want&quot; was written about a woman who &quot;Sucks the soul out of people&quot;.

In March 2004, the band released their fourth studio album &quot;Guilt Show&quot;, produced by Ed Rose. Sonically, the album combined the more measured, sophisticated sound of &quot;On a Wire&quot; with the frenetic style of their earlier work. &quot;Guilt Show&quot;—which was titled after a misreading of a flier saying &quot;Quilt show&quot;—was very well received both critically and commercially. The more pop-driven tone of the album reunited the band with many fans who were disenchanted after &quot;On a Wire&quot;, while also staying close enough to the evolution of the last album to interest newer fans and critics. However, their return was overshadowed by the booming popularity of other contemporary emo bands such as Dashboard Confessional, who invited the band to open for them on the 2004 Honda Civic Tour.

=== Breakup and solo activity (2004–2008) ===
Over the course of the tour with Dashboard Confessional, relationships between the band members continued to decline. The band&#x27;s live shows had deteriorated, and Rob and Suptic had both threatened to quit multiple times. Finally, Matt Pryor had a breakdown in Australia from the stresses of being away from his newborn first child. &quot;My daughter was 2 years old, and my oldest son was about 3 months away from being born, and I was in a really dark headspace about leaving,&quot; he reflected years later. &quot;I needed a break just to be at home and ultimately... that&#x27;s not what everyone else wanted. It was killing me.&quot;

After the Honda Civic tour ended, the band embarked on their world tour, including stops throughout Europe, Japan and Australia. However, their live performance hit an all-time low, with Pryor sometimes refusing even to sing large portions of songs. At one tour date in England, the tensions came to a head when Ryan Pope confronted Pryor over his recent despondence, leading to a band meeting where Pryor confessed his desire to reduce his commitment to the rest of the group. After some discussion, the band agreed that their hearts were no longer in it and at the end of the tour they would quietly end the band. Once the tour ended, the band went on an unofficial hiatus, not playing as a group until the next January, when they played a show at the Granada Theater in Lawrence, Kansas to celebrate the band&#x27;s tenth anniversary. The show was recorded and released the following May as the band&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Live! @ The Granada Theater&quot;.

On Tuesday, March 8, 2005, the Get Up Kids announced that after ten years, they were disbanding. They embarked on a national farewell tour, ending the band after a sold-out show on July 2, 2005, in their hometown of Kansas City at the Uptown Theater.

After the band&#x27;s split, the Pope brothers took over management of Black Lodge Studios, the recording studio that the band formed with the recording of &quot;Guilt Show,&quot; alongside longtime producing partner Ed Rose. The brothers joined Koufax for a short stint, before splitting for different projects. Rob was a founding member of Lawrence, Kansas group White Whale, releasing the 2006 album WWI on Merge Records to moderate acclaim before becoming a full-time member of Spoon, while Ryan became the drummer for the Lawrence-based experimental rock band the Roman Numerals.

Matt Pryor continued as part of the New Amsterdams, an acoustic alt-country group he had formed in 2000, expanding its sound and solidifying its previously revolving-door lineup. In 2007 he formed the Terrible Twos, a children&#x27;s band that has released two albums on Vagrant Records. Regarding the decision to make a children&#x27;s album directly after the split, Pryor said &quot;I wanted to do it anyway because I have kids and I want to write songs for them, but nobody is going to be like &#x27;this isn&#x27;t as good as the old stuff.&#x27; It&#x27;s immune to punk criticism.&quot; In July 2008, he refocused his efforts on a solo career with the release of &quot;Confidence Man&quot;. After his second album, &quot;May Day&quot;, Pryor announced that he would be formally disbanding the New Amsterdams in favor of his solo career, concluding the band&#x27;s tenure with the release of &quot;Outroduction&quot;, a B-sides compilation.

Jim Suptic went on to form Blackpool Lights with former members of Butterglory and the Creature Comforts. The band released their debut album This Town&#x27;s Disaster in 2006, consisted largely of songs Suptic wrote for the Get Up Kids but never recorded. The album was released on Curb Appeal Records, an independent label Suptic founded with former Get Up Kids collaborator and local musician Alex Brahl. The label released albums by Smoking Popes and the New Amsterdams, but dissolved sometime in 2008. The exact reasons why were never revealed, but Suptic said only that it &quot;blew up in [his] face.&quot; After the closure of the label, Suptic began working at Home Depot to support his family.

After the breakup of the Get Up Kids, James Dewees began performing with New Found Glory as their touring keyboardist, having previously played on their 2003 album Catalyst. As he traveled relentlessly, his ongoing struggles with alcohol and drug abuse worsened. After moving to New York City, he began to attend rehab, a process which would inspire the fifth Reggie and the Full Effect album, Last Stop: Crappy Town. After another brief tour opening for Hellogoodbye in 2006, he joined My Chemical Romance as their full-time touring keyboardist and later becoming a full time member.

=== Reunion and new music (2008–2011) ===

In late August and September 2008, while Dewees was touring with Reggie and the Full Effect, he began making hints that the Get Up Kids would be reuniting to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot;. The reunion was finally confirmed by a post on the official music blog of &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot;, confirming rumors that the band would be playing a surprise reunion show at The Record Bar in Kansas City on November 16, 2008. According to the article, the band had made the decision over the summer and had Dewees intentionally leak the information to gauge fan interest.

The reunion show was officially announced on Friday, November 14, along with the official confirmation of the album re-release and a 2009 national tour. The tenth anniversary edition of the album includes a code to download bonus demo tracks from the original recording of &quot;Something To Write Home About&quot; from the Vagrant Records website, and a DVD containing a band retrospective and other content, including archive footage, and their live performance from March 13, 2009, at Liberty Hall in Lawrence. The show took place Sunday, November 16, 2008, at the record bar in Kansas City. The band played their album &quot;Something To Write Home About&quot; from beginning to end, as well as a six-song encore.
In the summer of 2009, they returned to Black Lodge studios to record their first new material in five years, recording twelve tracks intended to be released as three EPs over the course of a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview 16/08/08&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The band&#x27;s reunion tour took place in Europe, followed by the US between mid-August and early October with Youth Group. After this, they went on another US tour, which ran into November 2009, with Mansions. On April 13, 2010, the band released the first EP &quot;Simple Science&quot; on Flyover Records. Despite their reformation, obligations to other projects limited the amount of time the band could spend together. On their 2010 tour, fun. bassist Nate Harold filled in for Rob Pope, who was already committed to touring with Spoon. In 2011 while James Dewees was on a world tour with My Chemical Romance, New Amsterdams regular Dustin Kinsey filled in on keyboards.

After the release of &quot;Simple Science,&quot; the band decided to combine the remaining tracks—along with three more newly recorded songs—into a new full-length album, &quot;There Are Rules&quot;. They also confirmed that the album would not be released on Vagrant Records, who had released their previous three albums, but on their own Quality Hill Records. The album was produced by Ed Rose and mixed by Bob Weston, who produced the band&#x27;s debut album. &quot;There Are Rules&quot; was released on January 25, 2011, and was supported by a co-headlining tour with Saves the Day.

===Second hiatus, &quot;Problems&quot; (since 2012)===
After &quot;There Are Rules&quot; largely failed to find an audience, the members of the Get Up Kids took another short hiatus working non-music industry jobs, interrupted only by brief weekend tours and one-off shows. While drinking at a bar before their performance at the 2017 When We Were Young festival, the band began to talk about recommitting to the Get Up Kids as a full-time pursuit. That same year, the band went on tour in Latin America for the first time and played six concerts in Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Brazil.

On March 29, 2018, Polyvinyl Records and Big Scary Monsters announced on their Instagram account that they had signed the band and that new music will be coming soon. The band released a thirteen-minute, four song EP entitled &quot;Kicker&quot; on June 8, 2018. This was followed by &quot;Problems&quot; on May 10, 2019, the group&#x27;s first album in eight years. A review of &quot;Problems&quot; published by Exclaim! said &quot;It sounds just as great as some of their older albums, reminding us why this band are still one of the greatest emo/alternative acts to come out of the &#x27;90s.&quot;

== Musical style and influences ==
The Get Up Kids&#x27; music has been described as emo, Midwest emo, punk rock, and pop-punk. The band has varingly classified their music as indie rock and punk rock. The Get Up Kids have cited numerous bands as influences, including Superchunk, Jawbreaker, Fugazi, Rocket from the Crypt, Sunny Day Real Estate, Cap&#x27;n Jazz, Vitreous Humor, and Jimmy Eat World.

== Legacy ==

The Get Up Kids have had a lasting impact on the music scene, having been cited as inspirations to several prominent bands and artists, and one of the bands who shaped the sound of the emo genre ahead of its later mainstreaming with the &quot;third wave&quot; movement in the early 2000&#x27;s. In a 2017 retrospective on &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot;, Vice Media said that &quot;Along with bands like Lifetime and Hot Water Music, The Get Up Kids developed a sound that was certainly responsible for the future of emo. These were the bands that picked up where Jawbreaker left off, and each in their own way contributed to shaping the future chart-topping genre.&quot;

The Get Up Kids&#x27; greatest influence came at the beginning of the 2000s with the rise of bands like My Chemical Romance and Fall Out Boy, both of whom cite the Get Up Kids as a major influence, particularly their album &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot;. In a 2005 interview with &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz stated that the band had a significant impact on him and the rest of the band, saying &quot;There should be a How To Be a Pop-Punk Kid starter kit with bands like Get Up Kids, so kids would know whose shoulders bands like us are standing on. Fall Out Boy would not be a band if it were not for The Get Up Kids.&quot;

Blink-182 bassist and singer Mark Hoppus is a vocal fan, having proposed to his wife to the Get Up Kids song &quot;I&#x27;ll Catch You.&quot; They were also a major influence on the rest of the band, even at their peak popularity around the release of &quot;Take Off Your Pants and Jacket&quot;.

New Jersey–based act Midtown has stated in interviews that they were heavily influenced by the Get Up Kids, among other groups. Early November band members were all fans of, and influenced by, the Get Up Kids. The Early November song &quot;Baby Blue&quot; includes the line &quot;I don&#x27;t want you to love me anymore&quot;, a direct reference to the Get Up Kids song &quot;No Love&quot; both lyrically and melodically. The band Hellogoodbye have been vocal fans of the band and while on tour with Reggie and the Full Effect in 2007, two years after the breakup of the Get Up Kids, Hellogoodbye invited James Dewees and Matt Pryor onstage with them, and proceeded to back them in a cover of the Get Up Kids&#x27; song &quot;Action &amp; Action&quot;. The Canadian post-hardcore band Silverstein has cited the Get Up Kids as a major influence, and covered their song Coming Clean for a split 7-inch with August Burns Red in 2013.

Claudio Sanchez of Coheed and Cambria cited &quot;Something to Write Home About&quot; as one of the albums that the band listened to and during the recording of their breakout album In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3.

Dan Campbell of the Wonder Years has cited the band as one of the artists who made him want to become a musician, going so far as to name his company after the Get Up Kids&#x27; track &quot;Forgive &amp; Forget&quot; from &quot;Eudora&quot;. In a 2010 interview with &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, Campbell said &quot;I don&#x27;t think I listen to any band more than I listen to [the Get Up Kids]. They really influence my songwriting, too. Every time I hear a Get Up Kids song, I think &#x27;Oh, that&#x27;s really creative&#x27; or, &#x27;That&#x27;s really cool that they did that.&#x27;&quot;

New Found Glory&#x27;s frontman Jordan Pundik states that the namesake of their band was partly influenced by the song A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts. 

Despite their lasting influence on modern music, the band has attempted to disassociate themselves from many of the bands they inspired. Following the band&#x27;s reformation, guitarist Jim Suptic undertook an interview with the website Drowned in Sound, in which he said, &quot;The punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different. It&#x27;s like glam rock now. We played the Bamboozle fests this year and we felt really out of place... If this is the world we helped create, then I apologize.&quot; He went on to say they were grateful for the acknowledgments they have received, though explaining &quot;the problem is most of [the bands they inspired] aren&#x27;t very good.&quot; 

In a 2020 interview with Apple Music on the history of Emo music, Matt Pryor expanded on his recent view of the current scene more positively; &quot;I will always owe a debt to Evan Weiss from Into It. Over It. for showing me that there was a new crop of bands like his band and Modern Baseball and Pup that were, like— They had the same work ethic we had when we were young.&quot;

In the years since reuniting, the band has actively supported newer emo bands, taking acts like Tigers Jaw, PUP, Steel Train and The Hotelier on tour.

<doc id="209409" wikidata="Q884163" url="?curid=209409" title="Blind Melon">
<text>Blind Melon is an American rock band formed in 1990 in Los Angeles, California. The band consists of guitarists Rogers Stevens and Christopher Thorn, drummer Glen Graham, vocalist Travis Warren and bassist Nathan Towne. They are best known for their 1993 hit &quot;No Rain&quot;, and enjoyed critical and commercial success in the early 1990s with their neo-psychedelic take on alternative rock. The band has sold over 3.2 million albums in the United States as of 2008.

Blind Melon released two albums on Capitol Records – &quot;Blind Melon&quot; (1992) and &quot;Soup&quot; (1995) – before their original lead vocalist Shannon Hoon died of a drug overdose on the band&#x27;s tour bus in New Orleans on October 21, 1995. After four years of unsuccessfully searching for a replacement for Hoon, Blind Melon dissolved in 1999. The remaining members reformed the band in 2006 with Travis Warren and recorded one album with him, &quot;For My Friends&quot; (2008). Shortly after its release, Warren left Blind Melon but returned in 2010, when the band returned to performing occasional gigs. The group has been nominated for four Grammy Awards.

==History==

===Formation, debut and success (1990–1993)===
Blind Melon formed in Los Angeles in March 1990 after West Point, Mississippi, transplants Rogers Stevens and Brad Smith, a guitarist and bassist respectively, met vocalist Shannon Hoon, a native of Lafayette, Indiana. Guitarist Christopher Thorn, originally from Pennsylvania, was added shortly thereafter; the four eventually convinced drummer Glen Graham to relocate from Mississippi to complete the group after failing to find a drummer in Los Angeles. Their moniker derived from a nickname Smith&#x27;s father had used to describe hippies. There is also a Cheech &amp; Chong character named Blind Melon Chitlin&#x27;, who is a parody of the 1920s blues musician Blind Lemon Jefferson.

The band debuted with a four-song demo, &quot;The Goodfoot Workshop&quot;, in 1991. Capitol Records A&amp;R executive Tim Devine signed Blind Melon later that year and oversaw sessions with famed producer David Briggs for an unreleased EP to be titled &quot;The Sippin&#x27; Time Sessions&quot;. The recordings were abandoned due to the band&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the production quality, which they felt resulted in &quot;slick and doctored&quot; results. Hoon&#x27;s friendship and association with Guns N&#x27; Roses frontman Axl Rose accrued additional industry attention for the group, as he provided backing vocals on several Guns N&#x27; Roses tracks on 1991&#x27;s &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; albums, including the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;. Blind Melon embarked upon a tour supporting Soundgarden late that year.

At drummer Glen Graham&#x27;s suggestion, the band relocated to Durham, North Carolina, while beginning work on what would become their self-titled debut album with producer Rick Parashar, known for producing Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Ten&quot;. Sessions were held in London Bridge Studio in Seattle, Washington, and the album was recorded mostly live with minimal overdubs. The record was released in September 1992, and initially sold poorly behind its lead singles, &quot;Tones of Home&quot; and &quot;No Rain&quot;, until the latter became an MTV staple the following July. Featuring Heather DeLoach playing the &quot;Bee Girl&quot;, the video for &quot;No Rain&quot; helped the band achieve international recognition. The album eventually attained quadruple-platinum status, debuting in the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 40 on October 9, 1993.

===&quot;Soup&quot; and Hoon&#x27;s death (1993–1995)===
The group toured extensively in support of their debut, performing dates in Europe and Mexico and supporting such acts as Neil Young and Lenny Kravitz late in 1993. Their activity the following year included a performance at Woodstock &#x27;94 in August and a supporting slot on the Rolling Stones&#x27; Voodoo Lounge Tour thereafter. Amidst rising success, the band began to experience personal and legal problems related to drug and alcohol abuse, leading to multiple stints in drug rehabilitation for Hoon.

In 1994, the members relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana, to begin work on their second album, &quot;Soup&quot;, with producer Andy Wallace. The album was released in 1995, and featured predominantly shorter songs with a less conventional alternative rock approach, including New Orleans-style jazz and a hodgepodge of instrumentation throughout, such as horn sections and mandolin/banjo tracks. The lyrics to &quot;St. Andrew&#x27;s Fall&quot; referenced a suicide jump, &quot;Skinned&quot; spoke about the life of Ed Gein, and &quot;New Life&quot; addressed the forthcoming birth of Hoon&#x27;s child. &quot;Mouthful of Cavities&quot; featured backing vocals from Jena Kraus, who subsequently recorded a solo record with Thorn and Smith. Despite the debut of the lead single, &quot;Galaxie&quot;, at number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, &quot;Soup&quot; ultimately failed to meet sales expectations.

Later that year, Blind Melon contributed a version of the song &quot;Out on the Tiles&quot; to the &quot;&quot; tribute album to Led Zeppelin, and cover of the &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; song &quot;Three Is a Magic Number&quot; to the &quot;Schoolhouse Rock! Rocks&quot; compilation. Their version of &quot;Three Is a Magic Number&quot;, although never a charting single, became a fan favorite and featured in the films &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot;, &quot;Slackers&quot;, and &quot;You, Me and Dupree&quot;. All Music Guide reviewer Theresa E. LaVeck has praised the tune&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;70s feel-good vibe&quot; and &quot;rolling jam-band rhythms&quot;.

Against the advice of Hoon&#x27;s drug counselor, Blind Melon went on tour in support of &quot;Soup&quot;. The band initially employed a counselor to assist Hoon&#x27;s rehabilitation, but this attendant was soon dismissed. After several weeks on the road, Hoon was found dead on the band&#x27;s tour bus of a heart attack caused by a cocaine overdose, on October 21, 1995, in Uptown New Orleans.

===Aftermath and breakup (1995–1999)===
The surviving members opted to continue their collaboration and recruit a new vocalist, although it would ultimately take them over a decade to do so. In 1996, they issued &quot;Nico&quot;, an album of outtakes and demos named for Hoon&#x27;s daughter, who was only 13 weeks old when her father died. &quot;Nico&quot; contained unreleased songs from the &quot;Soup&quot; recording sessions, as well as several songs recorded with only partial instrumentation. The closing track, &quot;Letters from a Porcupine&quot;, was recorded as a telephone message left by Hoon on Thorn&#x27;s answering machine. The album also included covers of Steppenwolf and John Lennon songs. Its profits went to a program that helps musicians with drug and alcohol addiction.

Discussing his loss with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Gia DeSantis, former KROQ DJ, producer and host at KDOC and head of video promotion at Capitol Records who worked with the band, said &quot;Shannon had a magnetism. You couldn&#x27;t take your eyes off him. They knew to bring in a new singer to sing his lyrics would not have had the same magnetism.&quot; She also mentions that &quot;the band knew its chapter was closed following Hoon&#x27;s death because he had become the public face of their music through their videos, particularly the one for No Rain&quot; a video that made VH1&#x27;s list of Top 100 Music Videos of All Time.

During this period, the relationships between the band members disintegrated as they attempted to recruit a new frontman. After failing to find a replacement for Hoon, Blind Melon officially dissolved their partnership on March 4, 1999, and the various members went on to other projects, including Thorn and Smith&#x27;s activity in Unified Theory, a group they had founded the previous year.

===Inactivity (1999–2006)===

In 2002, Capitol Records released a &quot;Classic Masters&quot; CD showcasing twelve Blind Melon songs. Thanks to stronger-than-expected sales, the band released &quot;The Best of Blind Melon&quot; in 2005, a CD–DVD package that features Blind Melon performing live from a September 1995 concert in Chicago. On December 15, 2006, a tribute album to Blind Melon was released by Yakmusic in New Zealand featuring bands from all over the world. In April 2006, Capitol Records released the &quot;Live at the Palace&quot; CD.

===Reunion and &quot;For My Friends&quot; (2006–2008)===
Blind Melon announced their reformation on September 15, 2006, which included the addition of new lead singer Travis Warren (formerly of Rain Fur Rent). Three new Blind Melon songs – &quot;Make a Difference&quot;, &quot;For My Friends&quot; and &quot;Harmful Belly&quot; – followed on November 9. On October 7, 2007, they performed their first live concert in twelve years in Providence, Rhode Island.

&quot;Wishing Well&quot;, the first single from the group&#x27;s upcoming third studio album, was released on March 4, 2008, to coincide with a U.S. tour. The album, &quot;For My Friends&quot;, was released on April 22, 2008, on Adrenaline Records. On September 17, 2008, the biography &quot;A Devil on One Shoulder and an Angel on the Other: The Story of Shannon Hoon and Blind Melon&quot; by Greg Prato was published. European tour dates followed thereafter.

On November 6, 2008, the band announced the departure of Warren, despite having unfulfilled concert dates. Initially, the band intended to honor their remaining dates, and announced Chris Shinn of Unified Theory as lead vocalist for the remainder of their tour. However, this was later retracted, and the tour canceled. Warren ultimately returned to perform a previously scheduled gig with Blind Melon on December 31, 2008, in Dearborn, Michigan, which was announced as his final show.

===Hiatus (2009–2010)===
Capitol Records released the four-track EP &quot;Deep Cuts&quot; in April 2009 as a digital download. The members remained active with other projects: Smith and Thorn played with Codename Mike, while Smith also toured with Revis as a guest member and Thorn played briefly with Awolnation. Graham formed the band Jakeleg with his long-time friend Joe Tullos.

===Second reformation and new album (2010–present)===
On November 2, 2010, Blind Melon announced its reformation and Warren&#x27;s return. Their first performance came November 27, when they played a free concert at the base of Aspen Mountain in Aspen, Colorado. They continued sporadic performances over the coming months, opening for Candlebox at The Hard Rock Hotel in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on February 4, 2011, and headlining Rest Fest at Crumland Farms, Frederick, Maryland, on September 5.

In 2012 they toured South America, with dates in Chile and Argentina, and Western Europe thereafter. On the status of the group, Graham stated late that year that &quot;Blind Melon is still a functioning entity; Travis Warren is our current vocalist as he has been since 2007; however, we are only doing the occasional one-off and currently have no plans to record full length CDs.&quot;

To cap 2015, the band played back-to-back shows on New Year&#x27;s Eve and New Year&#x27;s Day at Lafayette Theater in Lafayette, Indiana, with Shannon Hoon&#x27;s mother present. Nico Blue, Hoon&#x27;s daughter, took the stage to sing the song &quot;Change.&quot;

By 2018, Blind Melon had spent the last couple years working on new material for the follow-up to &quot;For My Friends&quot;. In a July 2018 interview on Consequence of Sound&#x27;s &quot;Kyle Meredith With ...&quot; podcast, guitarist Christopher Thorn stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve been mixing the new single or the new song, I could say ... the new song for the next Blind Melon record. We&#x27;ve been writing a bunch, and we have a song and a video done, so we just mixed the new song last night actually.&quot; Thorn also revealed that the band had been tracking some eight songs for the album since last December at his studio in Silver Lake, but added that there was no date set for release.

A documentary about Hoon titled &quot;All I Can Say&quot; (composed mostly of footage he shot on a handheld camera from 1990 to 1995) premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 26, 2019, and was released on June 26, 2020, on online streaming platforms. Also, it was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 24, 2020.

In September 2019, Blind Melon released their first song in 11 years &quot;Way Down And Far Below&quot;. Thorn stated that the band was expected to release their fourth full-length studio album in 2020; however, in an interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot; in February 2021, when asked about the state of the fourth studio album, Stevens said &quot;We&#x27;re going to release singles every couple of months, and then when there are 10-12 of them, we&#x27;re going to press vinyl and sell it to whoever wants it,&quot; while when Thorn was asked if the plan was to release the album by year&#x27;s end, he replied, &quot;We&#x27;ve got to get a record out this year. &quot;For sure&quot;.&quot;

On November 1, 2021, author Greg Prato issued a follow-up book to &quot;A Devil on One Shoulder and an Angel on the Other&quot;, simply titled &quot;Shannon&quot;, and featured all-new interviews with either people who knew Shannon or were admirers of his music (plus a &quot;roundtable discussion&quot; with Stevens and Thorn).

<doc id="209411" wikidata="Q157833" url="?curid=209411" title="Embezzlement">
<text>Embezzlement (from Anglo-Norman, from Old French &quot;besillier&quot; (&quot;to torment, etc.&quot;), of unknown origin) is a term commonly used for a type of financial crime, usually involving theft of money from a business or employer. It often involves a trusted individual taking advantage of their position to steal funds or assets, most commonly over a period of time.

== Versus larceny ==

Embezzlement is not always a form of theft or an act of stealing &quot;per se&quot;, since those definitions specifically deal with taking something that does not belong to the perpetrators. Instead, embezzlement is, more generically, an act of deceitfully secreting assets by one or more persons that have been &quot;entrusted&quot; with such assets. The persons entrusted with such assets may or may not have an ownership stake in such assets.

Embezzlement differs from larceny in three ways. First, in embezzlement, an actual &quot;conversion&quot; must occur; second, the original taking must not be trespassory, and third, in penalties. To say that the taking was not trespassory is to say that the persons performing the embezzlement had the right to possess, use or access the assets in question, and that such persons subsequently secreted and converted the assets for an unintended or unsanctioned use. &quot;Conversion&quot; requires that the secretion interfere with the property, rather than just relocate it. As in larceny, the measure is not the gain to the embezzler, but the loss to the asset stakeholders. An example of &quot;conversion&quot; is when a person logs checks in a check register or transaction log as being used for one specific purpose and then explicitly uses the funds from the checking account for another and completely different purpose.

When embezzlement occurs as a form of theft, distinguishing between embezzlement and larceny can be tricky. Making the distinction is particularly difficult when dealing with misappropriations of property by employees. To prove embezzlement, the state must show that the employee had possession of the goods &quot;by virtue of his or her employment&quot;; that is, that the employee had formally delegated authority to exercise substantial control over the goods. Typically, in determining whether the employee had sufficient control the courts will look at factors such as the job title, job description and the particular operational practices of the firm or organization. For example, the manager of a shoe department at a department store would likely have sufficient control over the store&#x27;s inventory (as head of the shoe department) of shoes; that if they converted the goods to their own use they would be guilty of embezzlement. On the other hand, if the same employee were to steal cosmetics from the cosmetics department of the store, the crime would not be embezzlement but larceny. For a case that exemplifies the difficulty of distinguishing larceny and embezzlement see &quot;State v. Weaver&quot;, 359 N.C. 246; 607 S.E.2d 599 (2005).

North Carolina appellate courts have compounded this confusion by misinterpreting a statute based on an act passed by parliament in 1528. The North Carolina courts interpreted this statute as creating an offence called &quot;larceny by employee&quot;; an offence that was separate and distinct from common law larceny. However, as Perkins notes, the purpose of the statute was not to create a new offence but was merely to confirm that the acts described in the statute met the elements of common law larceny.

The statute served the purpose of the then North Carolina colony as an indentured servant and slave-based political economy. It ensured that an indentured servant (or anyone bound to service of labour to a master, e.g., a slave) would owe to their master their labour; and, if they left their indentured service or bound labour unlawfully, the labour they produced, either for themselves (i.e., self-employed), or for anyone else, would be the converted goods that they unlawfully took, from the rightful owner, their master.

Crucially (and this can be seen as the purpose of the statute), any subsequent employer of such an indentured servant or slave, who was in fact bound to service of labour to a pre-existing master, would be chargeable with misprision of a felony (if it was proved they knew that the employee was still indentured to a master, or owned as a slave); and chargeable as an accessory after the fact, in the felony, with the servant or slave; in helping them, by employing them, in unlawfully taking that which was lawfully bound (through the master–servant relationship) in exclusive right, to the master of the indentured servant or slave.

==Methods==

Embezzlement sometimes involves falsification of records in order to conceal the activity. Embezzlers commonly secrete relatively small amounts repeatedly, in a systematic or methodical manner, over a long period of time, although some embezzlers secrete one large sum at once. Some very successful embezzlement schemes have continued for many years before being detected due to the skill of the embezzler in concealing the nature of the transactions or their skill in gaining the trust and confidence of investors or clients, who are then reluctant to &quot;test&quot; the embezzler&#x27;s trustworthiness by forcing a withdrawal of funds.

Embezzling should not be confused with skimming, which is under-reporting income and pocketing the difference. For example, in 2005, several managers of the service provider Aramark were found to be under-reporting profits from a string of vending machine locations in the eastern United States. While the amount stolen from each machine was relatively small, the total amount taken from many machines over a length of time was very large. A technique employed by many small-time embezzlers can be covered by falsifying the records. (For example, by removing a small amount of money and falsifying the record the register would be consistent, while the manager would remove the profit and leave the float in; this method would effectively make the register short for the next user and throw the blame onto them.)

Another method is to create a false vendor account and supply false bills to the company being embezzled so that the checks that are cut appear completely legitimate. Yet another method is to create phantom employees, who are then paid with payroll checks.

The latter two methods should be uncovered by routine audits, but often are not if the audit is not sufficiently in-depth, because the paperwork appears to be in order. A publicly traded company must change auditors and audit companies every five years. The first method is easier to detect if all transactions are by cheque or other instrument, but if many transactions are in cash, it is much more difficult to identify. Employers have developed a number of strategies to deal with this problem. In fact, cash registers were invented just for this reason.

Some of the most complex (and potentially most lucrative) forms of embezzlement involve Ponzi-like financial schemes where high returns to early investors are paid out of funds received from later investors duped into believing they are themselves receiving entry into a high-return investment scheme. The Madoff investment scandal is an example of this kind of high-level embezzlement scheme, where it is alleged that $65 billion was siphoned off from gullible investors and financial institutions.

==Prevention==
Internal controls such as separation of duties are common defences against embezzlement. For example, at a movie theatre (cinema), the task of accepting money and admitting customers into the theatre is typically broken up into two jobs. One employee sells the ticket, and another employee takes the ticket and lets the customer into the theatre. Because a ticket cannot be printed without entering the sale into the computer (or, in earlier times, without using up a serial-numbered printed ticket), and the customer cannot enter the theatre without a ticket, both of these employees would have to collude in order for embezzlement to go undetected. This significantly reduces the chance of theft, because of the added difficulty in arranging such a conspiracy and the likely need to split the proceeds between the two employees, which reduces the payoff for each.

Another obvious method to deter embezzlement is to regularly and unexpectedly move funds from one advisor or entrusted person to another when the funds are supposed to be available for withdrawal or use, to ensure that the &quot;full amount&quot; of the funds is available and no fraction of the savings has been embezzled by the person to whom the funds or savings have been entrusted.

==Worldwide==
In 2020, 37% of employee fraud happened because of a lack of internal controls or lack of independent checks and audits, 18% by overriding internal controls, 18% from lack of management review, 10% from a poor tone set by top managers, and 17% from other causes.

===England and Wales===
Offences of embezzlement were formerly created by sections 18 and 19 of the Larceny Act 1916.

The former offences of embezzlement are replaced by the new offence of theft, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968.

===United States===

In the United States, embezzlement is a statutory offence that, depending on the circumstances, may be a crime under state law, federal law, or both, with the definition of the crime of embezzlement varying according to the statutes of the jurisdiction in which charges are filed. Typical elements of the crime of embezzlement are the fraudulent conversion of the property of another person by the person who has lawful possession of the property.

In 2005–2009 the United States had 18,000 to 22,000 arrests for embezzlement per year, and 13,500 arrests in 2019. A 2009 journal article reported estimates that three quarters of medical professionals would suffer from embezzlement at least once in their career.

In 2018 the average embezzlement stole $360,000. The estimated losses in 2005–2009 (including the many with no arrest) were $400 billion per year. In 2018 companies brought charges in 45% of cases.

85% of incidents involved an embezzler who was a manager or higher. The average incident involved three embezzlers, and 79% of incidents involved more than one embezzler. 70% of cases went undetected for over a year, and 31% lasted over three years. The average embezzler had worked at the company for eight years. 39% of financial professionals who experienced embezzlements had experienced a prior incident of it. After the embezzlement, only 26% of companies added security and audit requirements, 27% increased spending on audits, and 29% reviewed their anti-fraud controls frequently. However 97% of companies which had experienced embezzlement were &quot;confident the anti-fraud controls in place ... would prevent future embezzlement&quot;.

<text>Benjamin Scott Folds (born September 12, 1966) is an American singer-songwriter from Winston-Salem, North Carolina. After playing in several small independent bands throughout the late 80s and into the early 90s, Folds came to prominence as the frontman and pianist of the alternative rock trio Ben Folds Five from 1993 to 2000, and again during their reunion from 2011 to 2013. He has recorded a number of solo albums, most recently &quot;Sleigher&quot; (2024). He has also collaborated with musicians such as Regina Spektor, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic and yMusic, and undertaken experimental songwriting projects with actor William Shatner and authors such as Nick Hornby and Neil Gaiman. He was the artistic advisor to the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. from 2019 until 2025.

Folds has frequently performed arrangements of his music with uncommon instrumentation for rock and pop music, including symphony orchestras and a cappella groups. In addition to contributing music to the soundtracks of the animated films &quot;Hoodwinked!&quot; and &quot;Over the Hedge&quot;, Folds has produced several albums, including Amanda Palmer&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Who Killed Amanda Palmer&quot; (2008).

Folds was also a judge on the NBC a cappella singing contest &quot;The Sing-Off&quot; from 2009 to 2013. In July 2019 he published his first book, a memoir titled &quot;A Dream About Lightning Bugs&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Folds was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He became interested in piano at age nine. His father, a carpenter, brought one home through a barter trade with a customer who was unable to pay. During this time, Folds listened to songs by Elton John and Billy Joel on AM radio, and learned them by ear. During his years at Richard J. Reynolds High School in Winston-Salem, Folds played in several bands as the pianist, bassist, or drummer.

Folds attended the University of Miami&#x27;s Frost School of Music on a full percussion scholarship, but dropped out after having failed &#x27;the jury&#x27; and losing his scholarship. He devoted a lot of time to working on piano technique. &quot;I spent maybe six months just running scales with a metronome like a freak,&quot; Folds said. &quot;I suppose that did something.&quot;

After leaving Miami, he returned to North Carolina and enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro for the fall semester of 1985. It was while studying at UNCG that he met his &#x27;accidental mentor&#x27;, Robert Darnell. Folds would acknowledge the impact of Darnell on his appreciation of music in his 2019 memoir &quot;A Dream About Lightning Bugs&quot;.

==Career==
===Majosha and early career===

In the late 1980s, Folds (as a bassist) formed the band Majosha with longtime friends Evan Olson, Millard Powers, and Eddie Walker. The group released several locally produced records. They played their first gig at Duke University&#x27;s Battle of the Bands in 1988, and won. They played at bars and fraternity parties, and self-produced an EP called &quot;Party Night: Five Songs About Jesus&quot; (1988), which they sold locally. The EP has four songs, none of which are about Jesus. They recorded &quot;Shut Up and Listen to Majosha&quot; in 1989. It contains, among other tracks, the four songs from &quot;Party Night&quot; (remixed and/or re-recorded) and &quot;Emaline&quot; and &quot;Video&quot;, which Folds would later record with Ben Folds Five. The song &quot;Get That Bug&quot; from &quot;Party Night&quot; was released as a dance mix in Japan.

After Majosha broke up, Folds played drums in a band called Pots and Pans with Evan Olson on bass and Britt &quot;Snuzz&quot; Uzzell on guitar and vocals, but the newly formed band lasted only about a month. Olson and Uzzell formed Bus Stop with Folds&#x27; younger brother, Chuck Folds, on bass, and Eddie Walker on drums.

Folds eventually got a music publishing deal with Nashville music executive Scott Siman who saw Folds open for musician Marc Silvey, as well as playing bass for Silvey&#x27;s band Mass Confusion, and moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue it in 1990. He played drums for a short stint in Power Bill, headed by Jody Spence, Millard Powers, and Will Owsley. Power Bill was later renamed The Semantics. Folds did not take a creative role in the band. He attracted interest from major labels. He ended up playing drums in Nashville as a session musician:

In Nashville, I was running eight miles a day, hanging out with my friends, walking around eating chocolate-chip cookies and playing a lot of drums, which I enjoyed. Life was easy. I was never frustrated—even though I wasn&#x27;t fulfilling my contract obligations. If you are failing in Nashville, at least your standard of living is nice. Nashville is a nice way to fail.

Folds moved to Montclair, New Jersey, and began to act in theater troupes in New York City. Around 1993, he was enjoying this to the point where he did not want to keep pursuing a musical career. He also played weekly gigs at Sin-é, famous for being the café which had helped start Jeff Buckley&#x27;s career.

===Ben Folds Five (1994–2000)===

Folds moved back to North Carolina and formed Ben Folds Five in 1994, with bassist Robert Sledge, and drummer Darren Jessee in Chapel Hill. As Folds put it, &quot;Jeff Buckley was being signed at that time by Columbia and I was talking to Steve, his A&amp;R guy, and somehow we knew the same people or something.&quot; In 1995, Ben Folds Five released their self-titled debut album. The debut was followed by &quot;Whatever and Ever Amen&quot; in 1997, and the odds-and-ends compilation &quot;Naked Baby Photos&quot; was released in early 1998. &quot;Whatever and Ever Amen&quot; included many singles such as &quot;Song for the Dumped&quot;, &quot;Battle of Who Could Care Less&quot;, and the band&#x27;s most successful song, &quot;Brick&quot;. In 1999, the band released what was to be their final album for over a decade, &quot;The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner&quot;, which included the hit &quot;Army&quot;.

Folds has described Ben Folds Five as &quot;punk rock for sissies&quot;, and his lyrics often contain nuances of melancholy, self-conflict, and humorous sarcasm, often punctuated by profanity.

Early in their career, Ben Folds Five gained a strong following in the United Kingdom and Australia. As with many other &#x27;alternative&#x27; American acts, this was largely due to consistent support from national broadcasters in those countries: in Britain the BBC and in Australia the ABC&#x27;s Triple J youth radio network and ABC-TV&#x27;s music video show &quot;Rage&quot;. The group&#x27;s first chart breakthrough came in the UK, when &quot;Underground&quot; made the lower reaches of the Top 40, peaking at no. 37. Britain was the band&#x27;s strongest territory in terms of chart success, with five singles making the national Top 40 there—&quot;Underground&quot;, &quot;Battle of Who Could Care Less&quot;, &quot;Kate&quot;, &quot;Brick&quot; and &quot;Army&quot;—although none managed to crack the UK Top 20. In Australia, &quot;Underground&quot; likewise broke the band locally and while it did not make the ARIA chart, it came in at no. 3 on the 1996 Triple J Hottest 100 poll (broadcast on January 26, 1997). The 1998 single &quot;Brick&quot; became the group&#x27;s only major chart placing in Australia, reaching no. 13; it also came in at no. 53 in the ARIA Australian Top 100 for that year and earned a Gold Record award while its parent album &quot;Whatever and Ever Amen&quot; peaked at no. 9 and charted for 32 weeks. Following their tour in support for &quot;The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner&quot;, the band decided to amicably break up, with each of the band members pursuing different projects.

===&quot;Rockin&#x27; the Suburbs&quot; to &quot;Supersunnyspeedgraphic&quot; (2001–2007)===

Folds&#x27; first solo album after the breakup of the band was &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Suburbs&quot; in 2001, released on the same day as the September 11 attacks. He played nearly all the instruments, most notably guitar, an instrument seldom used during the Ben Folds Five days. &quot;The Luckiest&quot; was written for the Amy Heckerling movie &quot;Loser&quot;, but the scene it was meant for was deleted. Millard Powers, Britt &quot;Snuzz&quot; Uzzell, and Jim Bogios joined Folds on the promotional tour of the album. &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic directed and appeared in Folds&#x27; video for the album&#x27;s namesake song, &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Suburbs&quot;. Folds&#x27; friend and fellow musician John McCrea, lead singer of the band Cake, contributed vocals to &quot;Fred Jones, Part 2&quot;.

A year later, Folds released &quot;Ben Folds Live&quot;, a collection of live solo recordings. In late 2003, two solo EPs, &quot;Speed Graphic&quot; and &quot;Sunny 16&quot;, were self-released on Folds&#x27; label Attacked by Plastic. The last EP, &quot;Super D&quot;, was released in mid-2004.

&quot;Songs for Silverman&quot; was released in the United States on April 26, 2005. The album returned to the trio format, featuring Jared Reynolds on bass and Lindsay Jamieson on drums. This album includes the track &quot;Late&quot;, a tribute to the late singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, and also features backup vocals from &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic on &quot;Time&quot;. Folds had played piano for Yankovic&#x27;s song &quot;Why Does This Always Happen to Me?&quot; on his &quot;Poodle Hat&quot; album.

On October 24, 2006, Folds released &quot;Supersunnyspeedgraphic, the LP&quot;, a compilation of songs that were originally released on the EPs &quot;Sunny 16&quot;, &quot;Speed Graphic&quot;, and &quot;Super D&quot;. He announced on his MySpace blog that he planned to work on his next studio album in October 2006, although recording did not actually start until 2007. On that same day, Folds became the first person to webcast a live-by-request concert over MySpace. The concert was complete with pranks staged ahead of time by Folds, including a drunk man falling over the balcony during &quot;Jesusland&quot; and a &quot;suicide attempt&quot; by Folds at the end. The concert is also notable for featuring a &quot;guitorchestra&quot;, a group of acoustic guitarists from Nashville who accompanied Folds on some songs, as well as an impromptu ringtone orchestra made up of audience members playing their cellphone&#x27;s ringtones in unison. A DVD of the performance, &quot;Live at MySpace&quot;, was released on February 20, 2007.

===&quot;Way to Normal&quot; to Ben Folds Five reunion (2008–2013)===

During a concert at the National Theatre in Richmond, Virginia on April 11, 2008, Folds announced that he had completed his newest album, and played four tracks from it. He played the first track, &quot;Hiroshima&quot;, at the show. He also debuted new music at an impromptu gig at the Exit/In on December 19, 2007, and at the Ann Arbor Folk Festival on January 25, 2008. Other new songs included &quot;Errant Dog&quot;, &quot;Effington&quot;, &quot;Bitch Went Nuts&quot;, &quot;Free Coffee&quot;, and &quot;Kylie From Connecticut&quot;. Folds played The 6th Annual Langerado on March 8, 2008, and was a part of the lineup for the 2008 Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival.

On July 16, 2008, an anonymous user posted what they claimed was a &quot;leak&quot; of Folds&#x27; latest album on a fan site (eventually called &quot;Way to Normal (Fake)&quot;). The file contained nine tracks along with a PDF of supposed cover art, and was a mix of what appeared to be legitimate songs from &quot;Way to Normal&quot;, pastiches of dry humor and melodramatic pop interwoven with bright, energetic melodies. Folds explained on Triple J radio a few weeks later that in one overnight session in Dublin he and the band had recorded &#x27;fake&#x27; versions of songs from the new album. His sources had then leaked them to the public as a light-hearted joke on his fans.

Ben Folds Five reunited to perform its first concert appearance in nearly 10 years on September 18, 2008, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&#x27;s Memorial Hall. The one-off gig was part of MySpace&#x27;s &quot;Front to Back&quot; series, in which artists played an entire album live. The band played &quot;The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner&quot;. All proceeds from ticket sales benefited the charity Operation Smile, of which Folds&#x27; uncle, Jim Folds, is on the board of directors for the North Carolina Chapter.

&quot;Way to Normal&quot; was released on September 30, 2008, in the United States and on September 29, 2008, in the United Kingdom. It became Folds&#x27; highest-charting album ever in the US, debuting at no. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Fan reception of the album was rather mixed, with several citing the heavy use of dynamic compression as a major downfall of the album. Folds responded, releasing a more &quot;traditional&quot; mix of the album entitled &quot;Stems and Seeds&quot;, featuring various bonus tracks such as the entire &quot;leaked&quot; album and providing stems that allowed fans to create remixes.

On April 28, 2009, Folds released &quot;Ben Folds Presents: University A Cappella!&quot;, an album consisting of college students&#x27; &quot;a cappella&quot; arrangements of his music performed by some of the country&#x27;s best college a cappella groups.

In March 2010, a video Folds created titled &quot;Ode To Merton&quot; went viral on YouTube. In the video, Folds improvises several songs about people that he sees on the social networking site Chatroulette, in the style of &quot;Merton&quot;, a YouTube creator who many initially thought was Folds himself.

Folds&#x27; final solo album before his reunion with Ben Folds Five, a collaboration with English author Nick Hornby, was entitled &quot;Lonely Avenue&quot; and was released on September 28, 2010. Announced shortly before the release of &quot;Way to Normal&quot;, the idea of the collaboration came out of the &quot;fake&quot; leak of the album released in July 2008. &quot;(We will) write and record it in about three days, just like we did in Dublin with the fake record,&quot; Folds said. As schedules began to misalign, the plans for the album began to change and take on the form of a more major release. On June 14, 2010, Folds released the official album art via his Twitter account. &quot;From Above&quot;, the first single from the album, premiered on Richard Kingsmill&#x27;s new music show &quot;2010&quot; on Triple J in Australia on July 18, 2010. &quot;From Above&quot; features Australian singer Kate Miller-Heidke on backing vocals. Folds also recorded a video song with Nick Hornby and Pomplamoose. English YouTuber Charlotte McDonnell (formerly Charlie McDonnell) was commissioned to create the music video for Folds&#x27; song &quot;Saskia Hamilton&quot;, which was uploaded on October 1, 2010.

The band reunited in 2011 with a subsequent release of the album &quot;The Sound of the Life of the Mind&quot;, leading to a tour of their new work throughout 2012 and 2013.

===&quot;So There&quot; and the National Symphony Orchestra (2014–2022)===

In March 2014, Folds premiered a commissioned piano concerto he composed with the Nashville Symphony Orchestra. This was followed up in 2015 with &quot;So There&quot;, an album by Folds and the yMusic Ensemble, released on September 11, 2015. The album includes eight chamber pop songs and the piano concerto performed with the Nashville Symphony.

He guest-starred on a second season episode of the Showtime drama series &quot;Billions&quot; in April 2017, playing his song &quot;Landed&quot;.

On May 11, 2017, Folds was appointed the first Artistic Advisor to the National Symphony Orchestra at The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. His term was originally through the 2019–2020 season, but held the position until 2025. Folds helps program NSO&#x27;s &quot;Declassified&quot; series of concerts, which presents classical and contemporary music in modern, &quot;reimagined&quot; ways. The concerts have featured the orchestra playing with various featured artists, including Folds, Regina Spektor, Sara Bareilles, Jon Batiste, Emily King, and others. With the National Symphony Orchestra, Folds collaborated with Mo Willems, contributing original music to a stage adaptation of &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Dinosaurs&quot; in 2022.

In September 2018, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; commissioned a single from him called &quot;Mister Peepers&quot;. The song depicts former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein&#x27;s conflict with Republicans during the Russia investigation, with the name coming from President Trump&#x27;s nickname for Rosenstein.

In June 2020, he released the song &quot;2020&quot;, describing the difficulty of living during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Folds appeared on the podcast &quot;Storybound&quot; in 2021. In April 2021, he launched his own podcast, &quot;Lightning Bugs: Conversations with Ben Folds&quot;, speaking with various guests on their artistic processes and the nature of creativity. In March 2022, he announced the podcast was on indefinite hiatus while he continued work on a new album.

In April 2022, Folds contributed the title song to the &quot;Peanuts&quot; streaming special &quot;It&#x27;s The Small Things, Charlie Brown&quot;, released on Apple TV+ for Earth Day. In May 2022, he also made a guest appearance in three episodes of the second season of &quot;The Wilds&quot;, a streaming drama series for Amazon Prime Video. The episodes featured a new plaintive piano-and-vocal version of the Ben Folds Five hit &quot;Brick&quot;, as well as Folds&#x27; rendition of the Psychedelic Furs song &quot;The Ghost in You&quot;.

=== &quot;What Matters Most&quot; and &quot;Sleigher&quot; to present (2023–present) ===

On February 15, 2023, Folds announced that his next album, titled &quot;What Matters Most&quot;, would be released on June 2, 2023. The first single, &quot;Winslow Gardens&quot;, was released on the same day as the announcement. Folds spent much of 2023 on an album tour of the United States and Europe, and stated that &quot;What Matters Most&quot; will likely be his final rock album.

During his Paper Airplane Request Tour in mid-2024, Folds announced that he had written and recorded a Christmas album. He performed a new track titled &quot;Me and Maurice&quot; on the tour.

Folds officially released two songs from the Christmas album on September 25, 2024. The songs were &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;, and &quot;We Could Have This&quot; featuring Lindsey Kraft. On October 25, 2024, Folds fully released his Christmas album, titled Sleigher. 

==Other work in music==
===Work for other musicians===
In addition to collaborations on his own music, Ben Folds often works with other musicians on their projects. In 1997, Folds recorded an unreleased studio album titled &quot;Forever Valentine&quot; with Whiskeytown.

&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic parodied Ben Folds&#x27; style in the song &quot;Why Does This Always Happen to Me?&quot; on his 2003 album &quot;Poodle Hat&quot;. According to music critic Nathan Rabin, the song &quot;amplifies the noxious self-absorption of the American character to hilarious extremes&quot; by describing a narrator who, upon hearing about a number of horrible tragedies, only complains about the (minor) inconveniences that affect him. Folds himself plays piano on the track. Yankovic later told &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;: &quot;Ben and I are old friends at this point, and of course I sought his keyboard work for that song. So he came in and knocked it out.&quot;

In 2004, Folds acted as producer, arranger, musician, and backup vocalist to William Shatner&#x27;s album &quot;Has Been&quot;. Shatner was also involved in Folds&#x27; &quot;Fear of Pop&quot; project, contributing vocals to a number of songs on the album, most notably the song &quot;In Love&quot;.

In August 2008, Folds played piano for friend and Japanese singer-songwriter Angela Aki&#x27;s song &quot;Black Glasses&quot; on her album &quot;Answer&quot;.

Folds produced Amanda Palmer of The Dresden Dolls&#x27; first solo album, &quot;Who Killed Amanda Palmer&quot;, which was released September 16, 2008. He also performs on the album.

===Soundtracks===
Ben Folds has often contributed both original and previously recorded songs to movies and television shows. Folds contributed a cover of The Beatles &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; to the 2001 film I Am Sam. The soundtrack for the 2005 animated film &quot;Hoodwinked!&quot; featured &quot;Red is Blue&quot;, performed by Folds. In May 2006, Folds contributed three original songs to the soundtrack of &quot;Over the Hedge&quot;, titled &quot;Heist&quot;, &quot;Family of Me&quot;, and &quot;Still&quot;. Included with them was a cover of the Clash song &quot;Lost in the Supermarket&quot; and a recording of &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Suburbs&quot; featuring new lyrics written to complement the plot of the film.

Folds&#x27; song &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Suburbs&quot; was featured on the soundtrack for ABC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Surviving Suburbia&quot;, which aired in August 2009. Folds also wrote the soundtrack for the Netflix original film &quot;Handsome&quot;, released in May 2017.

===Tours===
After Ben Folds Five split, Folds&#x27; first tour with a full band was to support the album &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Suburbs&quot;. He was accompanied by Britt &quot;Snüzz&quot; Uzzell on guitar and electronic keyboard, Millard Powers on bass and keys, and Jim Bogios on drums. Powers and Bogios later went on to join Counting Crows.

On a tour of Australia, Folds joined with solo artists Ben Kweller and Ben Lee to travel the country as The Bens, at the suggestion of a fan on Kweller&#x27;s official website. The trio also went on to record a four-track EP together.

In the summer of 2004, Folds co-headlined an American tour with fellow singer-songwriters Rufus Wainwright and Guster. Folds again performed with Wainwright and Lee in the summer of 2005 as part of the &quot;Odd Men Out&quot; tour. In addition, Folds has performed with many other notable musical names, including Weezer and Tori Amos. After seeing the Fray perform with Weezer, Folds asked the band to join him for twelve performances in 2005.

Folds also performed with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra (WASO) in March 2005, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (BSO) in November 2005, the Sydney Symphony at the Sydney Opera House, Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, Western Australian Symphony Orchestra, Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, and the Queensland Orchestra during an Australian tour in 2006. Folds performed with the North Carolina Symphony in March 2010, and the Utah Symphony Orchestra in July 2010. A DVD of Folds playing with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra was released in December 2005.

On May 9, 2007, Folds performed with the Boston Pops Orchestra. The orchestra&#x27;s performance was marred when a fight broke out between two audience members in the balcony, though Folds had not yet taken the stage.

After his MySpace performance on October 24, 2006, Folds&#x27;s tour performances began to feature a synthesizer, a red Nord Lead II, which he uses in many of the songs when played live. During his concerts, Folds frequently performs two of his concert traditions: palm-smashing the keys and throwing his stool at the piano.

In March 2007, Folds went on a headlining tour, which opened on March 24 at Assumption College in Worcester, Massachusetts. In the summer of 2007, he performed as the primary opener for John Mayer during his &quot;Continuum&quot; 38-day summer tour. During this tour, Mayer sometimes joined Folds on the song &quot;Narcolepsy&quot;, playing synth. At various concerts throughout the tour, parents of young children going to see Mayer would file complaints about Folds&#x27; lyrics.

On March 29, 2008, Folds played the Cage Center Arena at Berry College in Mount Berry, Georgia. During contract negotiations, he was asked by the administration to not play one of his songs due to its explicit lyrics. Folds refused, citing artistic freedom.

On May 9, 2008, Folds played his first completely solo show in years at Western Connecticut State University because his bassist Jared Reynolds was with his wife, who had just given birth to their first son.

Folds made a brief solo tour of Australia in August 2009; at one of his sold-out Sydney Opera House concerts he was joined onstage for several songs by Aimee Mann, who was also touring Australia at the time. At the Palais theatre in Melbourne, Missy Higgins joined him for &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot;, a single from &quot;Way to Normal&quot; that Folds originally sang with Regina Spektor.

In April 2011, Folds collaborated with Amanda Palmer, Neil Gaiman, and Damian Kulash as 8in8 to write, record, and produce eight songs in eight hours, which were then available online within 24 hours, as well as being performed once on its world tour, as part of the ReThink Music conference.

Folds reunited with Ben Folds Five to play the Mountain Jam Music Festival on June 2, 2012. This was the first time the band had performed live together since 2008.

Ben Folds performed at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. for the 2012 Presidential Scholar in the Arts ceremony with several of YoungArts best alumni.

As part of their 2013 &quot;Last Summer on Earth&quot; Tour, Ben Folds Five joined the Barenaked Ladies along with Guster for 30 dates across North America, beginning June 17 at the Verizon Theatre in Dallas, Texas and ending at the 2013 Celebrate Brooklyn festival.

From November 22 to 24, 2013, Folds took part in Performing Arts&#x27; &quot;American Voices&quot; festival hosted by Renée Fleming at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., which featured American jazz, country, Broadway, gospel, popular and classical music. With Sara Bareilles, he conducted a pop/rock master class for aspiring singers. During the concert series he premiered his new song &quot;I&#x27;m Not the Man&quot; with the National Symphony Orchestra and sang &quot;Not the Same&quot; with Bareilles.

On January 20, 2014, Folds performed at the El Rey Theatre, Los Angeles, in support of the David Lynch Foundation&#x27;s celebration of Ringo Starr&#x27;s &quot;lifetime of peace and love&quot;.

From July 2017 to early 2018, Ben Folds went on a tour titled &quot;The Paper Airplane Tour&quot;, in which audience members were encouraged to throw paper airplanes with song requests onto the stage halfway through the concert. Folds would then randomly select from these requests from his extensive catalog and perform them solo.

==Other ventures==
Folds is an avid photographer and cites it as more than just his hobby. His work was featured by National Geographic during the 2010 Tennessee floods.

Folds made a brief guest appearance on a 1996 &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; episode, Surprise, on Cartoon Network. This marks one of Ben&#x27;s first non-musical TV appearances.

In 2001, Folds was an inaugural member of the Independent Music Awards&#x27; judging panel to support independent artists.

Starting in December 2009, Folds was featured as a judge on NBC&#x27;s a cappella competition &quot;The Sing-Off&quot; alongside Nicole Scherzinger and Shawn Stockman. In the season 1 finale, Folds showcased his talents and played the piano background on &quot;Why Can&#x27;t We Be Friends?&quot; sung by the two finalist groups, the Beelzebubs from Tufts University near Boston and Nota, from San Juan, Puerto Rico. He again returned for the show&#x27;s second season in December 2010, the third season in September 2011 alongside Stockman and Sara Bareilles and a fourth season with Stockman and Jewel in December 2013. The show featured several performances of songs from Ben&#x27;s first solo album.

Folds has also taken several acting roles in his career. He made a cameo appearance in the 2013 film &quot;We&#x27;re the Millers&quot; playing himself as a piano teacher, although the scene did not make the theatrical cut. In January 2014, Folds had a brief appearance in the TV show &quot;Community&quot;, in episode &quot;Basic Intergluteal Numismatics&quot; (S5E03) as &quot;Professor Bublitz&quot;, a botany teacher who secretly grows marijuana in his office, as well as contributing the song that closes out the episode, &quot;Ass Crack Bandit&quot;. This led to him taking a recurring role in seasons 3, 4 and 5 of the FXX comedy &quot;You&#x27;re The Worst&quot; playing himself as an alcoholic. In 2022, Folds appeared as himself on 3 episodes of the 2nd season of Prime Video&#x27;s drama series &quot;The Wilds&quot;. Folds described his role on the show as playing a &quot;twisted, dream version&quot; of himself.

On May 2017 he began serving as the first artistic advisor to the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.

In June 2019, Folds launched a podcast titled &quot;ArtsVote 2020 with Ben Folds&quot; with the stated goal of getting every candidate in the 2020 United States presidential election to have &quot;a one-on-one, 30-minute conversation with Ben Folds about their personal background in the arts and arts education, their observations and previous policy efforts to transform through the arts the communities and states that they represent, and their vision for advancing support for the arts and the charitable sector in the future.&quot;

In July 2019, Folds published his first book, a memoir, titled &quot;A Dream About Lightning Bugs: A Life of Music and Cheap Lessons&quot;. This was followed up in April 2021 when Folds launched a podcast titled &quot;Lightning Bugs&quot;. In the podcast, Folds discusses creativity with guests from a variety of backgrounds and fields and writes a song with them at the end of every episode. Guests have included frequent collaborators William Shatner and Nick Hornby, as well as other guests such as Mo Willems, Bob Saget, and Jon Batiste.

On February 12, 2025, after President Donald Trump announced that he would fire the current Kennedy Center board of trustees and appoint himself as chairman, Folds announced on his Instagram page that he resigned as artistic director to the National Symphony Orchestra.

==Personal life==
Folds&#x27; personal life has inspired several of his songs; the hit single &quot;Brick&quot;, co-written with Darren Jessee, was based on the experience of Folds&#x27; girlfriend having an abortion while they were in high school. Folds initially refused to discuss the story behind &quot;Brick&quot;, thinking it was too serious for a pop song, but he eventually confirmed the inspiration for the song during a show on his Ben Folds Live tour. His telling of the story is included on the &quot;Brick&quot; track on the album.

Folds leased RCA Studio A in Nashville, Tennessee beginning in 2002 and was pivotal to the preservation of the historic building during its developer controversy in 2014. His efforts, along with others, led to the creation of the Music Industry Coalition.

Folds supports the Port Adelaide Power in the Australian Football League.

Folds supported Bernie Sanders for president in the 2016 presidential election.

As of 2016, he lived in Santa Monica, California. He also owned a residence in Hudson, New York, from 2016, until it was sold in December 2020. In March 2020, Folds temporarily resided in Sydney, where he was touring when travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic prevented him from traveling home.

===Marriages and children===
Folds has been married and divorced five times. He met his first wife, Anna Goodman, in first grade at Moore Elementary School, Winston-Salem and was married to her from 1987 to 1992. She co-wrote several Ben Folds Five songs, including &quot;Alice Childress&quot;, &quot;The Last Polka&quot;, &quot;Smoke&quot;, &quot;Kate&quot;, and &quot;Lullabye&quot;. Folds has since described Goodman as his &quot;oldest friend&quot; and the person who originally inspired him to play music.

Folds was then briefly married to Kate Rosen in 1996.

Folds met Frally Hynes, an Australian, in January 1998 and they were married in May 1999 in Adelaide, South Australia, making their home there and later releasing a song about the city titled &quot;Adelaide&quot;. Two months after their wedding, Frally gave birth to twins, Louis Francis (July 22, 1999) and Gracie Scott (July 23, 1999), the former inspiring his song &quot;Still Fighting It&quot; and the latter inspiring his song &quot;Gracie&quot;. Hynes also sang lead on &quot;Root to This&quot; on Fear of Pop&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Volume 1&quot;. Folds and Hynes divorced in 2006.

Folds married Fleur Stanbrook on November 17, 2007, at The Venetian in Las Vegas. They were based in Nashville. Folds and Stanbrook ended their marriage sometime in 2011. In 2012, Folds stated that &quot;As much as I love the idea of being married, it&#x27;s not for me.&quot;

<doc id="209420" wikidata="Q677346" url="?curid=209420" title="USS Wasp (CV-7)">
<text>USS &quot;Wasp&quot; (CV-7) was a United States Navy aircraft carrier commissioned in 1940 and lost in action in 1942. She was the eighth ship named , and the sole ship of a class built to use up the remaining tonnage allowed to the U.S. for aircraft carriers under the treaties of the time. As a reduced-size version of the hull, &quot;Wasp&quot; was more vulnerable than other United States aircraft carriers available at the opening of hostilities. &quot;Wasp&quot; was initially employed in the Atlantic campaign, where Axis naval forces were perceived as less capable of inflicting decisive damage. After supporting the occupation of Iceland in 1941, &quot;Wasp&quot; joined the British Home Fleet in April 1942 and twice ferried British fighter aircraft to Malta.

&quot;Wasp&quot; was then transferred to the Pacific in June 1942 to replace losses at the battles of Coral Sea and Midway. After supporting the invasion of Guadalcanal, &quot;Wasp&quot; was hit by three torpedoes from Japanese submarine on 15 September 1942. The resulting damage set off several explosions, destroyed her water-mains and knocked out the ship&#x27;s power. As a result, her damage-control teams were unable to contain the ensuing fires that blazed out of control. She was abandoned and scuttled by torpedoes fired from later that evening. Her wreck was found in early 2019.

==Design==
&quot;Wasp&quot; was a product of the Washington Naval Treaty. After the construction of the carriers and , the U.S. was still permitted to build a carrier.
The Navy sought to squeeze a large air group onto a ship with nearly 25% less displacement than the &quot;Yorktown&quot;-class. To save weight and space, &quot;Wasp&quot; was constructed with low-power propulsion machinery (compare &quot;Wasp&quot;″s machinery with &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s , the &#x27;s , and the &#x27;s ).

Additionally, &quot;Wasp&quot; was launched with almost no armor, modest speed, and more significantly, no protection from torpedoes. Absence of side protection of the boilers and internal aviation fuel stores &quot;doomed her to a blazing demise&quot;. These were inherent design flaws that were recognized when constructed, but could not be remedied within the allowed tonnage. These flaws, combined with a relative lack of damage control experience in the early days of the war, proved fatal.

&quot;Wasp&quot; was the first carrier fitted with a deck-edge elevator for aircraft. The elevator consisted of a platform for the front wheels of the plane and an outrigger for the tail wheel. The two arms on the sides moved the platform in a half-circle up and down between the flight deck and the hangar deck.

==Construction and commissioning==
Her keel was laid down on 1 April 1936 at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts; launched on 4 April 1939, sponsored by Carolyn Edison (wife of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Charles Edison), and commissioned on 25 April 1940 at the Army Quartermaster Base, South Boston, Massachusetts, with Captain John W. Reeves, Jr. in command.

==Service history==

&quot;Wasp&quot; remained at Boston through May, fitting out, before she got underway on 5 June 1940 for calibration tests on her radio direction finder gear. After further fitting out while anchored in Boston harbor, the new aircraft carrier steamed independently to Hampton Roads, Virginia, anchoring there on 24 June. Four days later, she sailed for the Caribbean in company with the destroyer .

&quot;En route&quot;, she conducted the first of many carrier qualification tests. Among the earliest of the qualifiers was Lieutenant, junior grade David McCampbell, who later became the Navy&#x27;s top-scoring ace in World War II. &quot;Wasp&quot; arrived at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in time to &quot;dress ship&quot; in honor of Independence Day.

During shakedown on 9 July, one of her Vought SB2U-2 Vindicator dive bombers crashed from the ship killing the two crew.

&quot;Wasp&quot; returned to Hampton Roads 15 July and embarked planes from the 1st Marine Air Group and took them to sea for qualification trials. for a week before the Marines and their planes were disembarked at Norfolk, and the carrier moved to Boston for post shakedown repairs.

She fired a 21-gun salute in honor of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose yacht, , stopped briefly at the Boston Navy Yard on 10 August.

&quot;Wasp&quot; departed the Army Quartermaster Base on 21 August to conduct steering drills and full-power trials. Late the following morning, she got underway for Norfolk, Virginia. For the next few days, while destroyer operated as plane guard, &quot;Wasp&quot; launched and recovered her aircraft: fighters from Fighter Squadron 7 (VF-7), and scout bombers from Scouting Squadron 72 (VS-72). The carrier put into the Norfolk Navy Yard on 28 August for repair work on her turbines and &quot;Wasp&quot; was drydocked from 12 to 18 September.

&quot;Wasp&quot; ran her final sea trials in Hampton Roads on 26 September 1940. Assigned to Carrier Division 3, Patrol Force, &quot;Wasp&quot; shifted to Naval Operating Base, Norfolk on 11 October. There, she loaded 24 Curtiss P-40 fighters from the Army Air Corps&#x27; 8th Pursuit Group and nine North American O-47A reconnaissance aircraft from the 2d Observation Squadron, as well as her own spares and utility unit Grumman J2F Duck amphibian on the 12th. &quot;Wasp&quot; subsequently flew off the Army planes in a test designed to compare the take-off runs of standard Navy and Army aircraft. This was the first time that Army planes had flown from a Navy carrier and foreshadowed the use of the ship in the ferry role in World War II.

&quot;Wasp&quot; then proceeded on toward Cuba in company with the destroyers and . Over the ensuing four days, the carrier&#x27;s planes flew routine training flights, including dive-bombing and machine-gun practices.

For the remainder of October and into November, &quot;Wasp&quot; trained in the Guantánamo Bay area. Her planes flew carrier qualification and refresher training flights, while her gunners sharpened up their skills in short-range battle practices at targets towed by the new fleet tug .

&quot;Wasp&quot; sailed for Norfolk and arrived shortly after noon on 26 November. remaining at the Norfolk Navy Yard through Christmas of 1940. Then, after first conducting degaussing experiments with the survey ship , she steamed independently to Cuba.

Arriving at Guantánamo Bay on 27 January 1941, &quot;Wasp&quot; conducted a regular routine of flight operations into February. With destroyer as her plane guard, &quot;Wasp&quot; operated out of Guantanamo and Culebra, conducting her maneuvers with an array of warships— the WWI-era battleship &quot;Texas&quot;, carrier , heavy cruisers , , and destroyers. &quot;Wasp&quot; ran gunnery drills and exercises, as well as routine flight training evolutions into March. Underway for Hampton Roads on 4 March, the aircraft carrier conducted a night battle practice into the early morning hours of the 5th.

During the passage to Norfolk, heavy weather sprang up on the evening of 7 March. &quot;Wasp&quot; was steaming at standard speed, . Off Cape Hatteras, a lookout spotted a red flare at 22:45, then a second set of flares at 22:59. At 23:29, with the aid of her searchlights, &quot;Wasp&quot; located the stranger in trouble. She was the lumber schooner &quot;George E. Klinck&quot;, bound from Jacksonville, Florida, to Southwest Harbor, Maine.

The sea, in the meantime, worsened from a state 5 to a state 7. &quot;Wasp&quot; lay to, maneuvering alongside at 00:07 on 8 March. At that time, four men from the schooner clambered up a swaying Jacob&#x27;s ladder buffeted by gusts of wind. Then, despite the raging tempest, &quot;Wasp&quot; lowered a boat, at 00:16, and brought the remaining four men aboard from the foundering schooner.

Later that day, &quot;Wasp&quot; disembarked her rescued mariners and immediately went into drydock at the Norfolk Navy Yard. The ship received vital repairs to her turbines. Portholes on the third deck were welded over to provide better watertight integrity, and steel splinter shielding around her and batteries was added. &quot;Wasp&quot; was one of 14 ships to receive the early RCA CXAM-1 radar. After those repairs and alterations were finished, &quot;Wasp&quot; got underway for the Virgin Islands on 22 March, arriving at St. Thomas three days later. She soon shifted to Guantánamo Bay and loaded maritime supplies for transportation to Norfolk.

Returning to Norfolk on 30 March, &quot;Wasp&quot; conducted routine flight operations out of Hampton Roads over the ensuing days, into April. In company with , the carrier conducted an abortive search for a downed patrol plane in her vicinity on 8 April. For the remainder of the month, &quot;Wasp&quot; operated off the East Coast of the United States between Newport, Rhode Island, and Norfolk, conducting extensive flight and patrol operations with her embarked air group. She shifted to Bermuda in mid-May, anchoring at Grassy Bay, Bermuda on the 12th. Eight days later, the ship got underway in company with the heavy cruiser and the destroyers and for exercises at sea before returning to Grassy Bay on 3 June. &quot;Wasp&quot; sailed for Norfolk three days later with the destroyer as her anti-submarine screen.

After a brief stay in the Tidewater area, &quot;Wasp&quot; headed back toward Bermuda on 20 June. &quot;Wasp&quot; and her escorts patrolled the stretch of the Atlantic between Bermuda and Hampton Roads until 5 July, as the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s neutrality patrol zones were extended eastward. Reaching Grassy Bay on that day, she remained in port a week before returning to Norfolk, sailing on 12 July in company with heavy cruiser &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; and destroyers , , and .

===Occupation of Iceland===

Following her return to Norfolk on 13 July 1941, &quot;Wasp&quot; and her embarked air group conducted refresher training off the Virginia Capes. Meanwhile, the situation in the Atlantic had taken on a new complexion, with American participation in the Battle of the Atlantic only a matter of time, when the United States took another step toward involvement on the side of the British. To protect American security and to free British forces needed elsewhere, the United States made plans to take over the occupation of Iceland relieving Canadian forces there. On 23-24 July, 32 Army Air Forces pilots and 30 P-40Cs and three PT-17 trainers from the AAF 33rd Pursuit Squadron, were taken aboard. Four newspaper correspondents – including the noted journalist Fletcher Pratt — came on board.

The carrier had drawn the assignment of ferrying those vital army planes to Iceland because of a lack of British aircraft to cover the American landings. The American P-40s would provide the defensive fighter cover necessary to watch over the initial American occupying forces. &quot;Wasp&quot; slipped out to sea on 28 July, with the destroyers and &quot;Walke&quot; as plane guards. The heavy cruiser later joined the formation at sea.

Within a few days, &quot;Wasp&quot;″s group joined the larger Task Force 16—consisting of the battleship , the heavy cruisers &quot;Quincy&quot; and &quot;Wichita&quot;, five destroyers, the auxiliary , the attack transport , the stores ship , and the amphibious cargo ship . Those ships, too, were bound for Iceland with the first occupation troops embarked. On the morning of 6 August, &quot;Wasp&quot;, &quot;Vincennes&quot;, &quot;Walke&quot;, and &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot; parted company from Task Force 16 (TF 16). Soon thereafter, the carrier turned into the wind and commenced launching the planes from the 33rd Pursuit Squadron. As the P-40s and the trio of trainers droned on to Iceland, &quot;Wasp&quot; headed home for Norfolk, her three escorts in company. After another week at sea, the group arrived back at Norfolk on 14 August.

===Neutrality patrols===

&quot;Wasp&quot; put to sea again on 22 August for carrier qualifications and refresher landings off the Virginia capes. Two days later, Rear Admiral H. Kent Hewitt, Commander Cruisers, Atlantic Fleet, shifted his flag from the light cruiser to &quot;Wasp&quot; while the ships lay anchored in Hampton Roads. Underway on the 25th, in company with &quot;Savannah&quot; and the destroyers and &quot;Kearny&quot;, the aircraft carrier conducted flight operations over the ensuing days. Scuttlebutt on board the carrier had her steaming out in search of the German heavy cruiser , which was reportedly roaming the western Atlantic in search of prey. Suspicions were confirmed for many on the 30th when the British battleship was sighted some away, on the same course as the Americans.

In any event, if they had been in search of a German raider, they did not make contact with her. &quot;Wasp&quot; and her escorts anchored in the Gulf of Paria, Trinidad, on 2 September, where Admiral Hewitt shifted his flag back to &quot;Savannah&quot;. The carrier remained in port until 6 September, when she again put to sea on patrol &quot;to enforce the neutrality of the United States in the Atlantic&quot;.

While at sea, the ship received the news of a German U-boat unsuccessfully attempting to attack the destroyer . The U.S. had been getting more and more involved in the war; American warships were now convoying British merchantmen halfway across the Atlantic to the &quot;mid-ocean meeting point&quot; (MOMP).

&quot;Wasp&quot;″s crew looked forward to returning to Bermuda on 18 September, but the new situation in the Atlantic meant a change in plans. Shifted to the colder climes of Newfoundland, the carrier arrived at Placentia Bay on 22 September and fueled from the oiler the following day. The respite in port was a brief one, however, as the ship got underway again, late on 23 September for Iceland. In company with &quot;Wichita&quot;, four destroyers, and the repair ship , &quot;Wasp&quot; arrived at Hvalfjörður, Iceland, on 28 September. Two days earlier, Admiral Harold R. Stark, the Chief of Naval Operations had ordered American warships to do their utmost to destroy whatever German or Italian warships they found.

With the accelerated activity entailed in the US Navy&#x27;s conducting convoy escort missions, &quot;Wasp&quot; put to sea on 6 October in company with &quot;Vincennes&quot; and four destroyers. Those ships patrolled the foggy, cold North Atlantic until returning to Little Placentia Bay, Newfoundland on 11 October, anchoring during a fierce gale that lashed the bay with high winds and stinging spray. On 17 October, &quot;Wasp&quot; set out for Norfolk, patrolling en route, and arrived at her destination on 20 October. The carrier soon sailed for Bermuda and conducted qualifications and refresher training flights &quot;en route&quot;. Anchoring in Grassy Bay on 1 November, &quot;Wasp&quot; operated on patrols out of Bermuda for the remainder of the month.

October had seen the incidents involving American and German warships multiplying on the high seas. &quot;Kearny&quot; was torpedoed on 17 October, &quot;Salinas&quot; on 28 October, and in the most tragic incident that autumn, was torpedoed and sunk with heavy loss of life on 30 October. Meanwhile, in the Pacific, tension between the U.S. and Japan increased almost with each passing day.

&quot;Wasp&quot; slipped out to sea from Grassy Bay on 3 December and rendezvoused with . While the destroyer operated as plane guard, &quot;Wasp&quot;″s air group flew day and night refresher training missions. In addition, the two ships conducted gunnery drills before returning to Grassy Bay two days later, where she lay at anchor on 7 December 1941 during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

===Atlantic Fleet===

Naval authorities felt considerable anxiety that French warships in the Caribbean and West Indies were prepared to make a breakout and attempt to get back to France. Accordingly, &quot;Wasp&quot;, the light cruiser , and the destroyers and &quot;Wilson&quot;, departed Grassy Bay and headed for Martinique. Faulty intelligence gave American authorities in Washington the impression that the Vichy French armed merchant cruiser &quot;Barfleur&quot; had gotten underway for sea. The French were accordingly warned that the auxiliary cruiser would be sunk or captured unless she returned to port and resumed her internment. As it turned out, &quot;Barfleur&quot; had not departed after all, but had remained in harbor. The tense situation at Martinique eventually dissipated, and the crisis abated.

With tensions in the West Indies lessened considerably, &quot;Wasp&quot; departed Grassy Bay and headed for Hampton Roads in company with , and escorted by the destroyers and &quot;Sterett&quot;. and moored at the Norfolk Navy Yard to commence an overhaul that would last into the start of 1942.

After departing Norfolk on 14 January 1942, &quot;Wasp&quot; headed north and touched at NS Argentia, Newfoundland, and Casco Bay, Maine. On 16 March, as part of Task Group 22.6 (TG 22.6), she headed back toward Norfolk. During the morning watch the next day, visibility lessened considerably; and, at 06:50, &quot;Wasp&quot;″s bow plunged into &quot;Stack&quot;″s starboard side, punching a hole and completely flooding the destroyer&#x27;s number one fireroom. &quot;Stack&quot; was detached and proceeded to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where her damage was repaired.

Meanwhile, &quot;Wasp&quot; made port at Norfolk on the 21st without further incident. Shifting back to Casco Bay three days later, she sailed for the British Isles on 26 March 1942 with Task Force 39 under the command of Rear Admiral John W. Wilcox, Jr., aboard the battleship . That force was to reinforce the Home Fleet of the Royal Navy. While &quot;en route&quot;, Rear Admiral Wilcox was swept overboard from the battleship on the morning of 27 March 1942 and drowned. Although hampered by poor visibility conditions, four SB2U Vindicators from &quot;Wasp&quot; took part in the search, and one of them crashed while attempting to land aboard &quot;Wasp&quot;, killing its two-man crew. Wilcox&#x27;s body was spotted an hour after he went overboard, face down in the raging seas, but it was not recovered due to the weather and the heavy seas.

Rear Admiral Robert C. Giffen, who flew his flag in the heavy cruiser , assumed command of TF 39. The American ships were met by a force based around the light cruiser on 3 April. Those ships escorted them to Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands. 

The majority of TF 39 joined the British Home Fleet – renumbered to TF 99 in the process – to cover convoys routed to North Russia, &quot;Wasp&quot; departed Scapa Flow on 9 April, bound for the Clyde estuary and Greenock, Scotland. The following day, the carrier sailed up the Clyde, past the John Brown Clydebank shipbuilding facilities. There, shipyard workers paused long enough from their labors to accord &quot;Wasp&quot; a tumultuous reception as she passed. &quot;Wasp&quot;″s impending mission was an important one – one upon which the fate of the island bastion of Malta hung. During the Siege of Malta it was under daily attack by German and Italian aircraft. The British, faced with the loss of air superiority over the island, and their own carriers unable to continue the Club Runs ferrying replacement aircraft to Malta, requested the use of Wasp to transport planes that could wrest air superiority from the Axis aircraft. &quot;Wasp&quot; drew ferry duty once again to participate in Operation Calendar, one of many Malta Convoys.

===Malta Convoys===
Having landed her torpedo bombers and dive bombers at RNAS Hatston in Orkney, &quot;Wasp&quot; loaded 52 Supermarine Spitfire Mk. V fighters (fitted with long range fuel tanks) of No. 601 and No. 603 Squadron RAF at Glasgow on 13 April, then departed on 14 April, this was the start of &quot;Operation Calendar&quot;. Her screen consisted of Force W of the Home Fleet – a group that included the battlecruiser and the anti-aircraft cruisers and . and also served in &quot;Wasp&quot;″s screen.

The group passed through the Straits of Gibraltar under cover of the pre-dawn darkness on 19 April, avoiding the possibility of being discovered by Spanish or Axis agents. At 04:00 on 20 April, &quot;Wasp&quot; spotted 11 Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters on her deck and quickly launched them to form a combat air patrol (CAP) over Force W while, the Spitfires were warming up their engines in the hangar deck spaces below. Once all 47 serviceable Spitfires had launched and were flying to Malta &quot;Wasp&quot; retired toward Gibraltar. However most of the Spitfires were lost when the Axis attacked Malta within minutes after they landed.
As a result, it looked as if a second ferry run to Malta was needed. The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, fearing that Malta would be &quot;pounded to bits&quot;, asked President Roosevelt to allow &quot;Wasp&quot; to have &quot;another good sting.&quot; and &quot;Wasp&quot; loaded another contingent of Spitfire Vs at King George V Dock Glasgow and sailed for the Mediterranean on 3 May in Operation Bowery. On this occasion, the group included the British carrier with her own load of Spitfires. 

The two carriers reached their launching points early on Saturday, 9 May - &quot;Wasp&quot; steaming in column ahead of at a distance of . At 06:30, &quot;Wasp&quot; launched 11 Wildcats of VF-71 to serve as CAP over the task force. First, &quot;Eagle&quot; flew off her 17 Spitfires in two waves; then &quot;Wasp&quot; flew off 47 more. The first Spitfire that took off at 06:43, piloted by Sergeant-Pilot Herrington, lost power soon after takeoff and plunged into the sea, with loss of pilot and aircraft. The other planes flew off safely and formed up to fly to Malta. 

An auxiliary fuel tank on another aircraft failed to draw; without the additional fuel the pilot could not make Malta, and his only alternatives were to land on board &quot;Wasp&quot;with no tailhookor to ditch and take his chances in the water. Pilot Officer Jerrold Alpine Smith chose to attempt a landing on &quot;Wasp&quot;, setting down at 07:43 with his Spitfire stopping just from the forward edge of the flight deck. One &quot;Wasp&quot; sailor observed it to be a &quot;one wire&quot; landing. &quot;Wasp&quot; set sail for the British Isles while a German radio station broadcast the startling news that the American carrier had been sunk; on 11 May, Prime Minister Churchill sent a message to &quot;Wasp&quot;: &quot;Many thanks to you all for the timely help. Who said a wasp couldn&#x27;t sting twice?&quot; The preparations for the reception of the Spitfires at Malta had been improved and within minutes they were airborne again and able to take on German aircraft when they attacked, shooting down 37.

===Pacific Fleet===
Early in May 1942, almost simultaneously with Operation Bowery—the Battle of the Coral Sea had been fought, then the Battle of Midway a month later. The loss of the &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; in the battles reduced the U.S. to three carriers in the Pacific, and it became imperative to transfer &quot;Wasp&quot; to the Pacific.

&quot;Wasp&quot; hurried back to the U.S. for alterations and repairs at the Norfolk Navy Yard. During the carrier&#x27;s stay in the Tidewater region, Captain Reeves – who had been promoted to flag rank – was relieved by Captain Forrest P. Sherman on 31 May. Departing Norfolk on 6 June, &quot;Wasp&quot; sailed with TF 37 which was built around the carrier and the battleship and escorted by , and six destroyers. The group transited the Panama Canal on 10 June, at which time &quot;Wasp&quot; and her consorts became TF 18, the carrier flying the flag of Rear Admiral Leigh Noyes.

Arriving at San Diego on 19 June, &quot;Wasp&quot; embarked the remainder of her complement of aircraft, Grumman TBF-1 Avengers and Douglas SBD-3 Dauntlesses, the latter replacing the old Vindicators. On 1 July, she sailed for the Tonga Islands as part of the convoy for the five transports carrying the 2nd Marine Regiment.

Meanwhile, preparations to invade the Solomon Islands were proceeding to disrupt the Japanese offensive to establish a defensive perimeter around the edge of their &quot;Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere&quot;.

===Guadalcanal Campaign===
On 4 July, while &quot;Wasp&quot; was en route to the South Pacific, the Japanese landed on Guadalcanal. Allied planners realized Japanese operation of land-based aircraft from that key island would threaten Allied control of the New Hebrides and New Caledonia area. Plans were made to evict the Japanese before their Guadalcanal airfield became operational. Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley – with experience as Special Naval Observer in London – was detailed to take command of the operation; and he established his headquarters at Auckland, New Zealand. Since the Japanese had a foothold on Guadalcanal, time was of the essence; preparations for an allied invasion proceeded with secrecy and speed.

Wasp – together with the carriers and – was assigned to the Support Force under Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher. Under the tactical command of Rear Admiral Noyes, embarked on Wasp, the carriers were to provide air support for the invasion and initiation of the Guadalcanal campaign.

&quot;Wasp&quot; and her airmen practiced day and night operations until Captain Sherman was confident that his airmen could perform their mission. &quot;D-day&quot; had been set for 1 August, but the late arrival of some of the transports carrying Marines pushed the date to 7 August.

En route, &quot;Wasp&quot;″s engines became a problem, reporting to Commander in Chief Pacific on 14 July that her starboard high-pressure turbine even at lowest speeds was making a loud scraping noise. This limited speed to only with just her port engine; leaving air operations entirely dependent on favorable wind. Repairs to the turbine were proposed at &quot;Bleacher&quot; (Tongatapu, Tonga Islands), where the destroyer tender was stationed, with four days estimated for the work there. &quot;Wasp&quot; arrived 18 July for those repairs and on 21 July CTF 18 reported that &quot;Wasp&quot; had successfully completed a trial making 27 knots with and 25 knot operations were possible with reduced reliability. Replacement turbine blades were available at Pearl Harbor, and repairs there were recommended after the current operations were complete.

&quot;Wasp&quot;, screened by the heavy cruisers and , and four destroyers, steamed westward toward Guadalcanal on the evening of 6 August until midnight. Then, she changed course to the eastward to reach her launch position from Tulagi one hour before dawn. &quot;Wasp&quot;″s first combat air patrol fighter took off at 05:57.

The early flights of Wildcats and Dauntlesses were assigned specific targets: Tulagi, Gavutu, Tanambogo, Halavo, Port Purvis on Florida Island, Haleta, Bungana, and the radio station dubbed &quot;Asses&#x27; Ears&quot;.

The Wildcats, led by Lieutenant Shands and his wingman Ensign S. W. Forrer, patrolled the north coast toward Gavatu. The other two headed for the seaplane facilities at Tanambogo. The Grummans, arriving simultaneously at daybreak, surprised the Japanese and strafed patrol planes and fighter-seaplanes in the area. Fifteen Kawanishi H8K &quot;Emily&quot; flying boats and seven Nakajima A6M2-N &quot;Rufe&quot; floatplane fighters were destroyed by during low-level strafing passes. Shands was credited with four &quot;Rufes&quot; and one &quot;Emily&quot;, while his wingman, Forrer, was credited with three &quot;Rufes&quot; and an &quot;Emily&quot; and would later be awarded the Navy Cross for his efforts. Lieutenant Wright and Ensign Kenton were credited with three patrol planes apiece and a motorboat tending the &quot;Emilys&quot;; Ensigns Reeves and Conklin were each credited with two and shared a fifth patrol plane between them. The strafing also destroyed an aviation fuel truck and a truck loaded with spare parts. 

Post-attack assessment estimated that the antiaircraft and shore battery sites pinpointed by intelligence had been destroyed by the Dauntless dive bombers in their first attack. None of &quot;Wasp&quot;″s planes were shot down, but Ensign Reeves landed his Wildcat aboard &quot;Enterprise&quot; after running low on fuel.

At 07:04, &quot;Wasp&quot; launched 12 Avengers loaded with bombs for use against land targets, and led by Lieutenant H. A. Romberg. The Avengers silenced resistance by bombing Japanese troop concentrations east of the knob of land known as Hill 281, in the Makambo-Sasapi sector, and the prison on Tulagi Island.

Some 10,000 men had been put ashore during the first day&#x27;s operations against Guadalcanal, and met only slight resistance. On Tulagi, however, the Japanese resisted stoutly, retaining about of the island by nightfall. &quot;Wasp&quot;, &quot;Saratoga&quot;, and &quot;Enterprise&quot; – with their screens – retired to the south at nightfall.

&quot;Wasp&quot; fighters led by Lieutenant C. S. Moffett maintained a continuous CAP over the transport area until noon on 8 August. Meanwhile, a scouting flight of 12 Dauntlesses led by Lieutenant Commander E. M. Snowden searched a sector to a radius of from their carrier, extending it to include all of the Santa Isabel Island and the New Georgia groups. The Dauntless made no contact with the Japanese during their two hours in the air, but at 08:15, Snowden sighted a &quot;Rufe&quot; some from Rekata Bay and shot the plane down.

Meanwhile, a large group of Japanese planes approached from Bougainville to attack the transports off Lunga Point. Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner ordered all transports to get underway and to assume cruising disposition. Eldridge was leading a formation of Dauntlesses from VS-71 against Mbangi Island, off Tulagi. His rear seat gunner assumed the formation of Japanese planes were friendly until six Zeroes bounced the first section making 12 unsuccessful firing passes.

Meanwhile, the leader of the last section of VS-71 – Lieutenant, junior grade Robert L. Howard – unsuccessfully attacked twin-engined Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; medium bombers heading for the American transports, and was engaged by four Zeroes escorting the bombers. Howard shot down one Zero with his fixed guns while his rear gunner, Seaman 2nd Class Lawrence P. Lupo, discouraged Japanese fighters attacking from astern.

Over the 7 and 8 August one fighter pilot, Ens. Thaddeus J. Capowski, was reported missing in action when he was separated from the formation but was later found alive and safe. One Dauntless was shot down; the wounded pilot Lieut. Dudley H. Adams was recovered by but the radioman-gunner Harry E. Elliott was reported to have been killed before the crash. Further one fighter landed in the water but the pilot was recovered, another crashed on the deck and after the injured pilot was recovered the wrecked aircraft jettisoned overboard. A third fighter crashed into the barrier but was repaired and put back into service. Against the loss of three Wildcats and one Dauntless, 15 enemy flying boats, eight floatplane fighters, and one Zero had been shot down.

At 18:07 on 8 August, Vice Admiral Fletcher recommended to Ghormley that the air support force be withdrawn. Fletcher, concerned by the large numbers of Japanese planes that had attacked on 8 August, reported that he had only 78 fighters left (of 99 he started with) and that fuel for the carriers was running low. Ghormley approved the recommendation, and &quot;Wasp&quot; joined &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; in retiring from Guadalcanal. By midnight, the landing had attained the immediate objectives. Japanese resistance – except for a few snipers – on Gavutu and Tanombogo had been overcome. Early on 9 August, a Japanese surface force engaged an Allied one in the Battle of Savo Island and retired with minimal damage after sinking four Allied heavy cruisers off Savo Island, including two that had served with &quot;Wasp&quot; in the Atlantic: &quot;Vincennes&quot; and &quot;Quincy&quot;.

After the initial day&#x27;s action in the Solomons campaign, the carrier spent the next month engaged in patrol and covering operations for convoys and resupply units headed for Guadalcanal. The Japanese began transporting reinforcements to contest the Allied forces.

&quot;Wasp&quot; was ordered south by Vice Admiral Fletcher to refuel and did not participate in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24 August. After fueling on 24 August &quot;Wasp&quot; hurried to the battle zone. Her total aircraft group was 26 Grumman F4F Wildcats, 25 Douglas SBD Dauntlesses, and 11 Grumman TBF Avengers. (One SBD Dauntless was earlier lost on 24 August by ditching in the sea because of engine trouble). On the morning of 25 August, &quot;Wasp&quot; launched a search mission. The Douglas SBD Dauntless of pilot Lieut. Chester V. Zalewski shot down two of Aichi E13A1 &quot;Jake&quot; floatplanes from (Vice Admiral Nobutake Kondō&#x27;s flagship). But the SBD Dauntlesses sighted no ships. The Japanese fleet had withdrawn out of range. At 13:26 on 25 August, &quot;Wasp&quot; launched a search/attack mission of 24 Dauntlesses and 10 Avengers against the convoy of Rear Admiral Raizo Tanaka that seemed to be still within range. Although the SBD Dauntlesses shot down a flying boat, they could not find the enemy ships anymore.

During the battle on 24 August &quot;Enterprise&quot; was damaged and had to return to port for repairs. &quot;Saratoga&quot; was torpedoed a week later and departed the South Pacific war zone for repairs as well. That left only two carriers in the southwest Pacific, &quot;Wasp&quot;, and , which had been in commission for only a year.

==Loss==
On Tuesday, 15 September 1942, &quot;Wasp&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot;, together with &quot;North Carolina&quot; and 10 other warships, were escorting the transports carrying the 7th Marine Regiment to Guadalcanal as reinforcements. &quot;Wasp&quot; was operating some southeast of San Cristobal Island. Her aircraft were being refueled and rearmed for antisubmarine patrol missions and &quot;Wasp&quot; had been at general quarters from an hour before sunrise until the time when the morning search returned to the ship at 10:00. Thereafter, the ship was in condition 2, with the air department at flight quarters. The only contact with the Japanese that day had been a Japanese four-engined flying boat that was downed by one of &quot;Wasp&quot;&#x27;s F4F Wildcats at 12:15.

About 14:20, the carrier turned into the wind to launch eight Wildcats and eighteen Dauntlesses and to recover eight Wildcats and three Dauntlesses that had been airborne since before noon. Lt. (jg) Roland H. Kenton, USNR, flying a Wildcat of VF-71 was the last aircraft off the deck of &quot;Wasp&quot;. The ship rapidly completed the recovery of the 11 aircraft before turning to starboard, heeling slightly as she did so. At 14:44 a lookout reported &quot;three torpedoes ... three points forward of the starboard beam&quot;.

A spread of six Type 95 torpedoes was fired at &quot;Wasp&quot; at about 14:44 from the tubes of the Type B1 submarine . &quot;Wasp&quot; put over her rudder hard to starboard to avoid the salvo, but it was too late. Three torpedoes struck in quick succession about 14:45; one actually breached, left the water, and struck the ship slightly above the waterline. All hit in the vicinity of the ship&#x27;s gasoline tanks and magazines. Two of the spread of torpedoes passed ahead of &quot;Wasp&quot; and were observed passing astern of before was hit by one at 14:51 while maneuvering to avoid the other (structural damage from this torpedo hit would eventually lead to &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot;&#x27;s sinking a month later). The sixth torpedo passed either astern or under &quot;Wasp&quot;, narrowly missed in &quot;Wasp&quot;″s screen about 14:48, and struck &quot;North Carolina&quot; about 14:52.
There was a rapid succession of explosions in the forward part of &quot;Wasp&quot;. Aircraft on the flight and hangar decks were thrown about and dropped on the deck with such force that landing gear snapped. Aircraft suspended overhead in the hangar fell onto those on the hangar deck; fires broke out in the hangar and below decks. Soon, the heat of the intense gasoline fires detonated the ready ammunition at the forward anti-aircraft guns on the starboard side, and fragments showered the forward part of the ship. The number two mount was blown overboard.

Water mains in the forward part of the ship had been rendered inoperable, meaning no water was available to fight the forward fires, which continued to set off ammunition, bombs, and gasoline. As the ship listed 10–15° to starboard, oil and gasoline, released from the tanks by the torpedo hit, caught fire on the water.

Captain Sherman slowed to , ordering the rudder put to port to try to get the wind on the starboard bow; he then went astern with right rudder until the wind was on the starboard quarter, in an attempt to keep the fire forward. At that point, flames made the central station unusable, and communication circuits went dead. Soon, a serious gasoline fire broke out in the forward portion of the hangar; within 24 minutes of the initial attack, there were three additional major gasoline vapor explosions. Ten minutes later Sherman decided to abandon ship as the firefighting was ineffectual. Survivors would have to disembark quickly to minimize loss of life.

After consulting with Rear Admiral Leigh Noyes, Captain Sherman ordered &quot;abandon ship&quot; at 15:20. All badly injured men were lowered into rafts or rubber boats. Many unwounded men had to abandon ship from aft because the forward fires were burning with such intensity. The departure, as Sherman observed it, looked &quot;orderly&quot;, and there was no panic. The only delays occurred when many men showed reluctance to leave until all the wounded had been taken off. The abandonment took nearly 40 minutes, and at 16:00 Sherman abandoned the ship once he was satisfied that no survivors were left on board.

Although the submarine hazard caused the accompanying destroyers to lie well clear or to shift position, they carried out rescue operations until , &quot;Lansdowne&quot;, &quot;Helena&quot;, and had 1,946 men embarked. The fires on &quot;Wasp&quot;, drifting, traveled aft and there were four violent explosions at nightfall. &quot;Lansdowne&quot; was ordered to torpedo the carrier and stand by until she was sunk. &quot;Lansdowne&quot;″s Mark 15 torpedoes had the same unrecognized flaws reported for the Mark 14 torpedo. The first two torpedoes were fired perfectly, but did not explode, leaving &quot;Lansdowne&quot; with only three more. The magnetic influence exploders on these were disabled and the depth set at . All three detonated, but &quot;Wasp&quot; remained afloat for some time, sinking bow-first at 21:00. 193 men had died and 366 were wounded during the attack. All but one of her 26 airborne aircraft made a safe landing on &quot;Hornet&quot; nearby but 45 aircraft went down with the ship.
Another Japanese submarine, , observed and reported the sinking of &quot;Wasp&quot;, as other US destroyers kept &quot;I-19&quot; busy. &quot;I-19&quot; avoided 80 depth charges and escaped safely. She was subsequently sunk with all hands in a depth charge attack on 25 November 1943 by destroyer USS Radford. 

==Wreck located==
On 14 January 2019, &quot;Wasp&quot;″s wreck was located by the research vessel &quot;Petrel&quot;. The carrier sits upright in of water, though parts of the hull appear to have split.

<text>The category of newly industrialized country (NIC), newly industrialized economy (NIE) or middle income country is a socioeconomic classification applied to several countries around the world by political scientists and economists. They represent a subset of developing countries whose economic growth is much higher than that of other developing countries; and where the social consequences of industrialization, such as urbanization, are reorganizing society.

== Definition ==
NICs are countries whose economies have not yet reached a developed country&#x27;s status but have, in a macroeconomic sense, outpaced their developing counterparts. Such countries are still considered developing nations and only differ from other developing nations in the rate at which an NIC&#x27;s growth is much higher over a shorter allotted time period compared to other developing nations. Another characterization of NICs is that of countries undergoing rapid economic growth (usually export-oriented). Incipient or ongoing industrialization is an important indicator of an NIC.

== Characteristics of newly industrialized countries ==
Newly industrialized countries can bring about an increase of stabilization in a country&#x27;s social and economic status, allowing the people living in these nations to begin to experience better living conditions and better lifestyles. Another characteristic that appears in newly industrialized countries is the further development in government structures, such as democracy, the rule of law, and less corruption. Other such examples of a better lifestyle people living in such countries can experience are better transportation, electricity, and better access to water, compared to other developing countries and low infant mortality rate.

== Historical context ==
The term came into use around 1970, when the Four Asian Tigers of Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea rose to become globally competitive in science, technological innovation and economic prosperity as well as NICs in the 1970s and 1980s, with exceptionally fast industrial growth since the 1960s; all four countries having since graduated into high-tech industrialized developed countries with wealthy high-income economies. There is a clear distinction between these countries and the countries now considered NICs. In particular, the combination of an open political process, high GNI per capita, and a thriving, export-oriented economic policy has shown that these East Asian economic tiger countries have roughly come to a match with developed countries as those of Western Europe as well Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the United States.

All four countries are classified as high-income economies by the World Bank and developed countries by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). All of the Four Asian Tigers, like Western European countries, have a Human Development Index considered &quot;very high&quot; by the United Nations.

== Current ==
The table below presents the list of countries consistently considered NICs by different authors and experts. Turkey and South Africa were classified among the world&#x27;s 34 developed countries (DCs) by the CIA World Factbook in 2008. Turkey became a founding member of the OECD in 1961 and Mexico joined in 1994. The G8+5 group is composed of the original G8 members in addition to China, India, Mexico, South Africa and Brazil. The members of the G20 include Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa and Turkey.

For China and India, the immense population of these two countries (each with over 1.4 billion people as of May 2024) means that per capita income will remain low even if either economy surpasses that of the United States in overall GDP. When GDP per capita is calculated according to purchasing power parity (PPP), this takes into account the lower costs of living in each newly industrialized country. Nominal GDP per capita typically is an indicator for living standards in a given country as well.

Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa meet annually with the G8 countries to discuss financial topics and climate change, due to their economic importance in today&#x27;s global market and environmental impact, in a group known as G8+5.

=== Other ===
Authors set lists of countries accordingly to different methods of economic analysis. Sometimes a work ascribes NIC status to a country that other authors do not consider a NIC. This is the case of countries such as Argentina, Egypt, Sri Lanka and Russia.

== Criticism ==
NICs usually benefit from comparatively low wage costs, which translates into lower input prices for suppliers. As a result, it is often easier for producers in NICs to outperform and outproduce factories in developed countries, where the cost of living is higher, and trade unions and other organizations have more political sway. This comparative advantage is often criticized by advocates of the fair trade movement.

== Problems ==
While South Africa is considered wealthy on a wealth-per-capita basis, economic inequality is persistent and extreme poverty remains high in the country. South Africa is a NIC with 34% of population unemployed and poor.

Mexico&#x27;s economic growth is hampered in some areas by an ongoing drug war.

Other NICs face common problems such as widespread corruption and political instability, as well as other circumstances that cause them to face the middle income trap.

<doc id="209428" wikidata="Q752401" url="?curid=209428" title="Least developed countries">
<text>The least developed countries (LDCs) are developing countries listed by the United Nations that exhibit the lowest indicators of socioeconomic development. The concept of LDCs originated in the late 1960s and the first group of LDCs was listed by the UN in its resolution 2768 (XXVI) on 18 November 1971.

A country is classified among the Least Developed Countries if it meets three criteria:
* Poverty – adjustable criterion based on Gross national income (GNI) per capita averaged over three years. , a country must have GNI per capita less than US$1,025 to be included on the list, and over $1,230 to graduate from it.
* Human resource weakness (based on indicators of nutrition, health, education and adult literacy).
* Economic vulnerability (based on instability of agricultural production, instability of exports of goods and services, economic importance of non-traditional activities, merchandise export concentration, handicap of economic smallness, and the percentage of population displaced by natural disasters).

As of December 2024, 44 countries were still classified as LDC, while eight graduated between 1994 and 2024. The World Trade Organization (WTO) recognizes the UN list and says that &quot;Measures taken in the framework of the WTO can help LDCs increase their exports to other WTO members and attract investment. In many developing countries, pro-market reforms have encouraged faster growth, diversification of exports, and more effective participation in the multilateral trading system.&quot;

== Overview ==
LDC criteria are reviewed every three years by the Committee for Development Policy (CDP) of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Countries may be removed from the LDC classification when indicators exceed these criteria in two consecutive triennial reviews. The United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS) coordinates UN support and provides advocacy services for Least Developed Countries. The classification () applies to 46 countries.

At the UN&#x27;s fourth conference on LDCs, which was held in May 2011, delegates endorsed a goal targeting the promotion of at least half the current LDC countries within the next ten years. As of 2018, ten or more countries were expected to graduate in 2024, with Bangladesh and Djibouti already satisfying all criteria in 2018.

There is one country which presently meets the criteria and two countries which previously met the criteria for LDC status, but declined to be included in the index, questioning the validity or accuracy of the CDP&#x27;s data: Ghana (no longer meets criteria as of 1994), Papua New Guinea (no longer meets criteria as of 2009), and Zimbabwe.

== Usage and abbreviations ==

Least developed countries can be distinguished from developing countries, &quot;less developed countries&quot;, &quot;lesser developed countries&quot;, or other similar terms.

The term &quot;less economically developed country&quot; (LEDC) is also used today. However, in order to avoid confusion between &quot;least developed country&quot; and &quot;less economically developed country&quot; (which may both be abbreviated as LDC), and to avoid confusion with landlocked developing country (which can be abbreviated as LLDC), &quot;developing country&quot; is generally used in preference to &quot;less-developed country&quot;.

During a United Nations review in 2018, the UN defined LDCs as countries meeting three criteria, one of which was a three-year average estimate of gross national income (GNI) per capita of less than US$1,025.

== UN conferences ==

There have been five United Nations conferences on LDCs, held every ten years. The first two were in Paris, in 1981 and 1991; the third was in Brussels in 2001.

The Fourth UN Conference on Least Developed Countries (LDC-IV) was held in Istanbul, Turkey, on 9–13 May 2011. It was attended by Ban Ki-moon, the head of the UN, and close to 50 prime ministers and heads of state. The conference endorsed the goal of raising half the existing Least developed countries out of the LDC category in 2022. As with the Seoul Development Consensus drawn up in 2010, there was a strong emphasis on boosting productive capability and physical infrastructure, with several NGOs not pleased with the emphasis placed on the private sector.

The Fifth UN Conference on Least Developed Countries (LDC-V) was split in two parts almost a year apart, between UN Headquarters in New York on 17 March 2022 and Doha on 5-9 March 2023.

== Trade ==
Issues surrounding global trade regulations and LDCs have gained a lot of media and policy attention thanks to the recently collapsed Doha Round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations being termed a development round. During the WTO&#x27;s Hong Kong Ministerial, it was agreed that LDCs could see 100 percent duty-free, quota-free access to U.S. markets if the round were completed. But analysis of the deal by NGOs found that the text of the proposed LDC deal had substantial loopholes that might make the offer less than the full 100 percent access, and could even erase some current duty-free access of LDCs to rich country markets. Dissatisfaction with these loopholes led some economists to call for a reworking of the Hong Kong deal.

Chiedu Osakwe, as of 2001 the Director, Technical Cooperation Division at the Secretariat of the WTO, and adviser to the Director-General on developing country matters, was appointed as the WTO Special Coordinator for the Least Developed Countries beginning in 1999. He worked closely with the five other agencies that together with the WTO constitute the Integrated Framework of action for the Least Developed Countries. They addressed issues of market access, special and differential treatment provisions for developing countries, participation of developing countries in the multilateral trading system, and development questions, especially the interests of developing countries in competition policy. At the 28th G8 summit in Kananaskis, Alberta, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien proposed and carried the Market Access Initiative, so that the then 48 LDCs could profit from &quot;trade-not-aid&quot;. Additionally, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 advocates for an effective special and differential treatment of LDCs as integral parts of WTO fisheries subsidies negotiation.

=== Market access preferences ===
Several countries grant preferential access to least developed countries. For instance, the European Union has implemented the Everything but Arms scheme, while Switzerland offers free access to its market for all products to LDCs. Access to the Japanese market is also free for LDCs.

Effective 1 December 2024, China eliminated tariffs for goods imported from all of the countries that the United Nations categorizes as least developed and with which China has diplomatic relations. Thirty-three of the countries benefiting from the agreement are in Africa and the non-African countries receiving zero tariff treatment are Yemen, Kiribati, the Solomon Islands, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, and East Timor.

== List of countries ==
The following 44 countries were still listed as least developed countries by the UN as of December 2024: Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Kiribati, Laos, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tuvalu, Uganda, Tanzania, Yemen, and Zambia. 

=== By continent or region ===
There are 32 countries that are classified as least developed countries in Africa, 8 in Asia, 3 in Oceania, and 1 in the Americas.

The list of &quot;least developed countries&quot; according to the United Nations with some that are categorized into the landlocked developing countries and the Small Island Developing States:

=== Delisted countries (graduated countries) ===
The three criteria (human assets, economic vulnerability and gross national income per capita) are assessed by the Committee for Development Policy every three years. Countries must meet two of the three criteria at two consecutive triennial reviews to be considered for graduation. The Committee for Development Policy sends its recommendations for endorsement to the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

After the initiation of the LDC category, eight countries graduated to &quot;developing country&quot; status. The first country to graduate from LDC status was Botswana in 1994. The second country was Cape Verde in 2007. Maldives graduated to &quot;developing country&quot; status at the beginning of 2011, Samoa in 2014, Equatorial Guinea in 2017, Vanuatu in December 2020, Bhutan in December 2023, and São Tomé and Príncipe in December 2024.

The following countries are no longer categorized in the &quot;least developed countries&quot; group:
* (became a state within the Republic of India in 1975)
* (graduated from LDC status in December 1994)
* (graduated in December 2007)
* (graduated in January 2011)
* (graduated in January 2014)
* (graduated in June 2017)
* (graduated in December 2020)
* (graduated in December 2023)
* (graduated in December 2024)

=== Countries expected to graduate soon ===
* Bangladesh met the criteria twice, once in 2018 and again in 2021. The country will officially graduate from LDC status in November 2026, two years after it was supposed to, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
* Laos and Nepal will also graduate in November 2026. The latter was originally selected to graduate to developing country status in 2018. However, the authorities of Nepal requested to postpone graduation until 2021. Graduation was later pushed back an additional five years.
* Solomon Islands will graduate in December 2027.
* Cambodia is expected to graduate in December 2029. It met the criteria in 2021 and was originally expected to graduate in 2027, but this was later postponed to ensure a smooth transition.
* Senegal will graduate in December 2029.
* Djibouti, Kiribati and Tuvalu could graduate from LDC status in 2027 at the earliest.
* Comoros and Myanmar met the graduation criteria at least twice. They could be recommended for graduation in 2027.
* Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania met the graduation criteria for the first time in 2024. They could be recommended for graduation in 2027.
* Angola was expected to graduate in 2021, but the preparatory period was extended by three years because of the economic difficulties of the country and its dependence on commodities. Graduation was further postponed in December 2023, without any specific timeline.

<doc id="209433" wikidata="Q638020" url="?curid=209433" title="Robert Atkins (physician)">
<text>Robert Coleman Atkins (October 17, 1930 April 17, 2003) was an American physician and cardiologist, best known for the Atkins Diet, which requires close control of carbohydrate consumption and emphasizes protein and fat as the primary sources of dietary calories in addition to a controlled number of carbohydrates from vegetables.

The commercial success of Atkins&#x27; diet plan led &quot;Time&quot; to name the doctor a person of the year in 2002. The Atkins diet has been described as &quot;one of the most popular fad diets in the United States&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Atkins was born in 1930 in Columbus, Ohio, the son of Eugene and Norma (Tuckerman) Atkins. His family was Jewish. At the age of 12, his family moved to Dayton, Ohio, where his father owned several restaurants. As a young teen, Atkins held various jobs, including a position selling shoes at the age of 14 and a later gig on a local radio show. He attended Fairview High School in Dayton and, in 1947, finished second among 8,500 seniors on a statewide general scholarship test. Upon graduating from the University of Michigan in 1951, Atkins had thoughts of becoming a comedian and spent the summer as a waiter and entertainer at various resorts in the Adirondacks.

He eventually decided to pursue medicine, however, and received a medical degree from Cornell University Medical College in 1955. Atkins completed an internship at Strong Hospital in Rochester, New York, and finished his residency in cardiology and internal medicine at hospitals affiliated with Columbia University.

==Career==
Atkins specialized in cardiology and complementary medicine, and went on to open a private practice on the Upper East Side of New York City in 1959. His medical practice did not go well at first, and he began to put on weight and became depressed. After doing some research, he decided to pursue a low-carbohydrate approach published by Alfred W. Pennington, based on research Pennington did during World War II at DuPont. He began applying this approach in his practice, and began writing books about low-carb diets that became known as the Atkins diet, publishing his first book in 1972 and a few years later opening a complementary medicine center. He married his wife, Veronica, when he was 56.

==Death==
In 2001, Atkins&#x27;s coronary arteries were 30 to 40 percent blocked, according to Patrick Fratellone, his cardiologist and employee.

In 2002, Atkins went into cardiac arrest, leading many of his critics to point to this episode as proof of the inherent dangers in the consumption of high levels of saturated fat associated with the Atkins diet. In numerous interviews, however, Atkins stated that his cardiac arrest was not the result of poor diet, but was rather caused by a chronic infection.

On April 8, 2003, Atkins was admitted to Weill Cornell Medical Center, where he underwent surgery to remove a blood clot from his brain after having slipped on ice and hit his head, but fell into a coma. He died on April 17, at age 72.

After his death, his widow stated that Atkins&#x27;s coronary-artery disease had progressed in the final years of his life with a new blockage, a procedure to remedy the blockage, and that he was taking heart-rhythm medication.

A report from the New York medical examiner&#x27;s office leaked a year after his death said that Atkins had a history of heart attack, congestive heart failure and hypertension, and that at the time of his death he weighed . According to Stuart Trager, chairman of the Atkins Physicians Council (a group of physicians who work as consultants to the Atkins organization), this report contained incomplete medical records and Atkins did not have a history of heart attacks; instead, according to Trager, Atkins had cardiomyopathy, a heart muscle disease that was probably caused by a virus, not his diet. His widow refused to allow an autopsy. 

==Diet==
The Atkins Diet is a low-carbohydrate diet promoted by Atkins.

His success inspired others to generate low-carb diets, and many companies released low-carb diets and low-carb foods. After his death, the popularity of Atkins&#x27; diet waned, with other low-carb diets eroding its market share and questions being raised about its safety. In 2005, Atkins Nutritionals filed for bankruptcy. It was subsequently purchased by North Castle Partners in 2007 and switched its emphasis to low-carb snacks. In 2010, the company was acquired by Roark Capital Group.

<text>Jerome Morrell Ahern (June 23, 1946 – July 24, 2012) was an American writer of science fiction and action novels, non-fiction books, and articles for various firearms publications. He was considered an expert on firearms and related accessories, produced his own line of holsters, and served as president of firearms company Detonics.

==Biography==
Jerry Ahern was the son of John and Arline Ahern. He was born and raised in Chicago and attended Lindblom High School. He served in the ROTC.

In 1969, he married Sharon and they had two children. Ahern wrote his first novel in 1980 and his first non-fiction book in 1996, and continued his writing career until his death. In addition to writing novels and non-fiction, Ahern was a contributor to various firearms publications such as &quot;Gun Digest&quot;, &quot;Guns Magazine&quot;, Dillon Precision&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Press&quot;, Michael Bane&#x27;s &quot;Down Range TV&quot;, among others. Ahern was considered an expert on firearm-related subjects and worked as an editorial consultant. Ahern and his wife also founded and ran a handgun holster company, Ahern Enterprises. From 2004 to 2007 Ahern was president of Detonics, a manufacturer of custom 1911-style pistols. Ahern died of cancer in Jefferson, Georgia.

==Novels==
Jerry Ahern is best known for his post apocalyptic survivalist series, &quot;The Survivalist&quot;. The books in this series are heavy with descriptions of the weapons the protagonists use to survive and prosecute a seemingly never-ending war amongst the remnants of the superpowers from pre-apocalypse times. The series centers around the attempts of Dr. John Thomas Rourke, an ex-CIA agent, to preserve his family.

Most of the Ahern novels were written as a series, with multiple books containing the same characters. The underlying themes are survival, integrity, and perseverance. Ahern&#x27;s four non-fiction books follow this theme and focus on self-defense and survival. His final published novel, with a semi-autobiographical character, was about a novelist and his family being transported through time to the 19th century. It was titled &quot;Written in Time&quot;. It was co-authored with his wife, Sharon Ahern.

Ahern, in collaboration with his wife Sharon, wrote more than 80 books prior to his death. Most of the books were published under his name but several series used the pseudonyms Axel Kilgore, Red Mitchell, and Nick Carter. Following Ahern&#x27;s death, Sharon Ahern continues the various series, writing in conjunction with long-time family friend and writer Bob Anderson.

The municipality was created in connection with the municipal reform of 1952, when the rural municipalities &quot;Ed&quot;, &quot;Fresta&quot; and &quot;Hammarby&quot; were amalgamated. It got its name from a settlement which had evolved around the railway station.

The name Väsby can be attested (as &quot;Vesby&quot;) from the 13th century. The prefix &quot;Upplands&quot; came to be used by the post station in 1919 as a means of separating it from other Väsbys in the country. The municipality was then named &quot;Upplands-Väsby&quot; for a time, but the dash was removed on 19 September 2002.

==Geography==
Upplands Väsby is located in between Stockholm and Arlanda Airport, and the East Coast Line railroad goes through the municipality. There are local train services to Arlanda Airport, Uppsala, Stockholm Central Station and Älvsjö (Stockholm commuter rail).

The land is covered with good soil, forests, and moraine. The western part border to a creek of the lake Mälaren (not visible on the map), which also marks the border to the municipality Upplands-Bro. There are also other water areas, such as streams and small lakes, in the municipality. One of them is the small river Väsbyån, flowing through Väsby, in which the uncommon fish asp swims.

==History==
Located in the province of Uppland the municipality holds remains from the Stone Age. Runestones and axes from the Bronze Age have also been found. The number of rune inscriptions in the municipality amounts to 76.

When Väsby Centrum, a shopping centre that currently houses some 60 stores, was built in Väsby in 1972 the population grew markedly. The mall is currently undergoing a large increase; 20 new stores will have opened by spring 2007, bringing the mall&#x27;s total up to 80 stores.

<text>The phrase &quot;power behind the throne&quot; refers to a person or group that is understood to &quot;de facto&quot; wield the power of a high-ranking official (originally, and hence the name, a monarch), or whose support must be maintained to continue in office. In politics, it most commonly refers to a nominal subordinate or advisor to an officeholder (often called a &quot;figurehead&quot;) who serves as &quot;de facto&quot; leader, setting policy through influence, manipulation, or both.

The original concept of a power behind the throne was a medieval-era figure of speech referring to the fact that the monarch&#x27;s policies could be set by a counselor not seated in the throne but standing behind it—perhaps whispering in the monarch&#x27;s ear—out of common sight. In recent times, family members and official or unofficial advisers might take on a similar role. Sometimes it is difficult to assess whether such an accusation is true or a conspiracy theory. The term typically has a negative slant, implying that the power behind the throne exercises their influence illegitimately, or at least extralegally. A similar meaning is conveyed by the term &quot;éminence grise&quot;.

==Historical examples==
Historical examples of a &quot;power behind the throne&quot; include:
* Europe
** The Roman Empire – Earlier examples include the &quot;magistri militum&quot; of the later decades of the Western Roman Empire. Examples of such are
*** Stilicho, general and advisor to Emperor Honorius,
*** Aetius, the power behind the throne of Honorius&#x27; nephew Valentinian III,
*** Ricimer the puppet master of Emperors Avitus, Majorian, Libius Severus, Procopius Anthemius, and Olybrius,
*** and then finally Flavius Orestes, the father of the usurper emperor Romulus Augustulus, and the Germanic chieftain Odoacer, who were the masters in the West during the reigns of Emperor Julius Nepos and then Orestes&#x27; son, the aforementioned Romulus. Odoacer then deposed the figurehead Roman ruler, captured and executed Orestes, and established his own Italian kingdom as the &quot;Dux Italiae&quot;, only to be overthrown by the Ostrogothic chieftain Theodoric on the behest of the Eastern Emperor Zeno.
** The Mayor of the Palace under the Merovingian kings in Francia (among the earliest recorded examples of such powerful advisors).
** Chancellor of Germany and Minister President of Prussia Otto von Bismarck, with German Emperor and King of Prussia William I as a de facto figurehead.
** Cardinal Richelieu and his successor Cardinal Mazarin, &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of France during the reign of King Louis XIII and the early years of that of Louis XIV.
** Marquis of Pombal, a Portuguese statesman and diplomat who effectively ruled the Portuguese Empire from 1750 to 1777 as chief minister to King Joseph I.
* West Asia

** In Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani was often called the power behind the throne of Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
* South Asia
** In India, an example was Chanakya, the teacher and advisor of Chandragupta Maurya. A modern example is Sonia Gandhi, acting as the real power behind the erstwhile Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 
** Peshwa of the Maratha Confederacy, under the Bhat family, they became the &quot;de facto&quot; leaders of the Maratha Confederacy, with the Chhatrapati becoming a nominal ruler.
** Sarvadhikari, chief minister of the Kingdom of Mysore.
** In the Kingdom of Nepal, from 1846 to 1951, the Rana dynasty reduced the kings to the status of figurehead, with the post of Prime Minister being transmitted hereditarily.
* East Asia
** Nogai Khan, Mamai, and Edigu in the Golden Horde;
** Yeon Gaesomun, Yeon Namsaeng, and Yeon Nam-geon, Dae Magniji of the Kingdom of Goguryeo;
** Goryeo military regime in the Kingdom of Goryeo;
** Fujiwara clan of Heian period of classical Japan

** The Genrō had this role in Meiji period of Japan.
** The Qianlong Emperor held &quot;de facto&quot; power as the retired emperor during the first three years of his son—the Jiaqing Emperor&#x27;s reign.
**The Empress Dowager Cixi held total power of the Qing dynasty during the reign of three emperors.

==Related terms==
A related term is &quot;éminence grise&quot; (French: &quot;gray eminence&quot;), a powerful advisor or decision-maker who operates secretly or otherwise unofficially. This phrase originally referred to Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s right-hand man, François Leclerc du Tremblay (also known as the &quot;Père Joseph&quot;), a Capuchin friar who wore grey robes. Because the Cardinal de Richelieu, the power behind the throne of King Louis XIII of France, as a Catholic cardinal was styled &quot;Son Eminence&quot; (&quot;His Eminence&quot;), his alter ego Père Joseph was called &quot;l&#x27;éminence grise&quot; (which is also the English title of his biography by Aldous Huxley). Martin Bormann was referred to as the Brown Eminence, brown referring to the brown uniform of the Nazi Party.

The &quot;proconsul&quot;, as analogy for a person from a foreign power manipulating another country&#x27;s internal affairs, is also referred as the &quot;power behind the throne&quot;.

<text>The Perseids are a prolific meteor shower associated with the comet Swift–Tuttle that are usually visible from mid-July to late-August. The meteors are called the Perseids because they appear from the general direction of the constellation Perseus and in more modern times have a radiant bordering on Cassiopeia and Camelopardalis.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the word Perseidai (), the sons of Perseus in Greek mythology.

==Characteristics==

The stream of debris is called the Perseid cloud and stretches along the orbit of the comet Swift–Tuttle. The cloud consists of particles ejected by the comet as it travels on its 133-year orbit. Most of the particles have been part of the cloud for around a thousand years. However, there is also a relatively young filament of dust in the stream that was pulled off the comet in 1865, which can give an early mini-peak the day before the maximum shower. The dimensions of the cloud in the vicinity of the Earth are estimated to be approximately 0.1 astronomical units (AU) across and 0.8 AU along the Earth&#x27;s orbit, spread out by annual interactions with the Earth&#x27;s gravity.

The shower is visible from mid-July each year, with the peak in activity between 9 and 14 August, depending on the particular location of the stream. During the peak, the rate of meteors reaches 60 or more per hour. They can be seen all across the sky; however, because of the shower&#x27;s radiant in the constellation of Perseus, the Perseids are primarily visible in the Northern Hemisphere. As with many meteor showers the visible rate is greatest in the pre-dawn hours, since more meteoroids are scooped up by the side of the Earth moving forward into the stream, corresponding to local times between midnight and noon, as can be seen in the accompanying diagram. While many meteors arrive between dawn and noon, they are usually not visible due to daylight. Some can also be seen before midnight, often grazing the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere to produce long bright trails and sometimes fireballs. Most Perseids burn up in the atmosphere while at heights above .

===Peak times===


==Historical observations and associations==

Some Catholics refer to the Perseids as the &quot;tears of Saint Lawrence&quot;, suspended in the sky but returning to Earth once a year on August 10, the canonical date of that saint&#x27;s martyrdom in 258 AD. The saint is said to have been burned alive on a gridiron. His manner of death is almost certainly the origin of the Mediterranean folk legend claiming that the shooting stars are the sparks of Saint Lawrence&#x27;s martyrdom. The legend holds that during the night of August 9 to 10, cooled embers appear in the ground under plants; these embers are known as the &quot;coal of Saint Lawrence.&quot;

The transition in favor of the Catholic saint and his feast day on August 10, moving away from pagan gods and their festivals — a process known as Christianization — was facilitated by the phonetic assonance of the Latin name Laurentius with Acca Larentia, a goddess previously celebrated during the summer period alongside Priapus, as a fertility deity. Among the Romans, it was believed that the trails of the Perseids represented the benevolent rain of Priapus&#x27; seed. In this context, the god&#x27;s cosmogonic phallus acted as a life-giver, blessing the fields and promoting fertility. During the same period, phallic processions and other sexual rites were common. Christianity, which had a different relationship with sexuality and generativity compared to Greco-Roman culture, replaced this sexual connotation with a reference to martyrdom.

In 1836 Adolphe Quetelet wrote: &quot;J&#x27;ai cru remarquer aussi une fréquence plus grande de ces météores au mois d&#x27;août (du 8 au 15)&quot; &quot;I think I noticed also a greater frequency of these meteors in the month of August (from 8 to 15).&quot; After studying historical records, he predicted a peak on 10 August. He then wrote to other astronomers, who confirmed this prediction on the night of 10 August 1837. Quetelet missed the shower due to bad weather.

In 1866, after the perihelion passage of Swift-Tuttle in 1862, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli discovered the link between meteor showers and comets. The finding is contained in an exchange of letters with Angelo Secchi.

==In popular culture==
In his 2006 novel &quot;Against the Day&quot;, American novelist Thomas Pynchon refers to the Perseid meteor shower being watched by three characters west of the Dolores Valley after playing a game of tarot.
In the TV series &quot;Curious George&quot;, season 7 episode 1b, George and his friends Allie and Bill hunt for the Perseids, which they believe are creatures that look like purses. At the end of the episode, Allie&#x27;s grandfather Mr. Renkins says that the Perseids is a meteor shower happening in early August.

John Denver&#x27;s song &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot; references the showers with the lyric, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen it raining fire in the sky.&quot;

<text>Perseus is a constellation in the northern sky, named after the Greek mythological hero Perseus. It is one of the 48 ancient constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and among the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is located near several other constellations named after ancient Greek legends surrounding Perseus, including Andromeda to the west and Cassiopeia to the north. Perseus is also bordered by Aries and Taurus to the south, Auriga to the east, Camelopardalis to the north, and Triangulum to the west. Some star atlases during the early 19th century also depicted Perseus holding the disembodied head of Medusa, whose asterism was named together as &quot;Perseus et Caput Medusae&quot;; however, this never came into popular usage.

The galactic plane of the Milky Way passes through Perseus, whose brightest star is the yellow-white supergiant Alpha Persei (also called Mirfak), which shines at magnitude 1.79. It and many of the surrounding stars are members of an open cluster known as the Alpha Persei Cluster. The best-known star, however, is Algol (Beta Persei), linked with ominous legends because of its variability, which is noticeable to the naked eye. Rather than being an intrinsically variable star, it is an eclipsing binary. Other notable star systems in Perseus include X Persei, a binary system containing a neutron star, and GK Persei, a nova that peaked at magnitude 0.2 in 1901. The Double Cluster, comprising two open clusters quite near each other in the sky, was known to the ancient Chinese. The constellation gives its name to the Perseus cluster (Abell 426), a massive galaxy cluster located 250 million light-years from Earth. It hosts the radiant of the annual Perseids meteor shower—one of the most prominent meteor showers in the sky.

==History and mythology==


In Greek mythology, Perseus was the son of Danaë, who was sent by King Polydectes to bring the head of Medusa the Gorgon—whose visage caused all who gazed upon her to turn to stone. Perseus slew Medusa in her sleep, and Pegasus and Chrysaor appeared from her body. Perseus continued to the realm of Cepheus whose daughter Andromeda was to be sacrificed to Cetus the sea monster.

Perseus rescued Andromeda from the monster by killing it with his sword. He turned Polydectes and his followers to stone with Medusa&#x27;s head and appointed Dictys the fisherman king. Perseus and Andromeda married and had six children. In the sky, Perseus lies near the constellations Andromeda, Cepheus, Cassiopeia (Andromeda&#x27;s mother), Cetus, and Pegasus.

In Neo-Assyrian Babylonia (911–605 BC), the constellation of Perseus was known as the &quot;Old Man&quot; constellation (SU.GI), then associated with East in the MUL.APIN, an astronomical text from the 7th century.

===In non-Western astronomy===

Four Chinese constellations are contained in the area of the sky identified with Perseus in the West. &quot;Tiānchuán&quot; (天船), the Celestial Boat, was the third paranatellon (A star or constellation which rises at the same time as another star or object) of the third house of the White Tiger of the West, representing the boats that Chinese people were reminded to build in case of a catastrophic flood season. Incorporating stars from the northern part of the constellation, it contained Mu, Delta, Psi, Alpha, Gamma and Eta Persei. &quot;Jīshuǐ&quot; (積水), the Swollen Waters, was the fourth paranatellon of the aforementioned house, representing the potential of unusually high floods during the end of August and beginning of September at the beginning of the flood season. Lambda and possibly Mu Persei lay within it. &quot;Dàlíng&quot; (大陵), the Great Trench, was the fifth paranatellon of that house, representing the trenches where criminals executed en masse in August were interred. It was formed by Kappa, Omega, Rho, 24, 17 and 15 Persei. The pile of corpses prior to their interment was represented by &quot;Jīshī&quot; (積屍, Pi Persei), the sixth paranatellon of the house. The Double Cluster, h and Chi Persei, had special significance in Chinese astronomy.

In Polynesia, Perseus was not commonly recognized as a separate constellation; the only people that named it were those of the Society Islands, who called it &quot;Faa-iti&quot;, meaning &quot;Little Valley&quot;. Algol may have been named &quot;Matohi&quot; by the Māori people, but the evidence for this identification is disputed. &quot;Matohi&quot; (&quot;Split&quot;) occasionally came into conflict with &quot;Tangaroa-whakapau&quot; over which of them should appear in the sky, the outcome affecting the tides. It matches the Maori description of a blue-white star near Aldebaran but does not disappear as the myth would indicate.

== Characteristics ==
Perseus is bordered by Aries and Taurus to the south, Auriga to the east, Camelopardalis and Cassiopeia to the north, and Andromeda and Triangulum to the west. Covering 615 square degrees, it ranks twenty-fourth of the 88 constellations in size. It appears prominently in the northern sky during the Northern Hemisphere&#x27;s spring. Its main asterism consists of 19 stars. The constellation&#x27;s boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a 26-sided polygon. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between and . The International Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted the three-letter abbreviation &quot;Per&quot; for the constellation in 1922.

==Features==
===Stars===

Algol (from the Arabic رأس الغول &quot;Ra&#x27;s al-Ghul&quot;, which means &quot;The Demon&#x27;s Head&quot;), also known by its Bayer designation Beta Persei, is the best-known star in Perseus. Representing the head of the Gorgon Medusa in Greek mythology, it was called Horus in Egyptian mythology and &quot;Rosh ha Satan&quot; (&quot;Satan&#x27;s Head&quot;) in Hebrew. Located 92.8 light-years from Earth, it varies in apparent magnitude from a minimum of 3.5 to a maximum of 2.3 over a period of 2.867 days.
The star system is the prototype of a group of eclipsing binary stars named Algol variables, though it has a third member to make up what is actually a triple star system. The brightest component is a blue-white main-sequence star of spectral type B8V, which is 3.5 times as massive and 180 times as luminous as the Sun. The secondary component is an orange subgiant star of type K0IV that has begun cooling and expanding to 3.5 times the radius of the Sun, and has 4.5 times the luminosity and 80% of its mass. These two are separated by only 0.05 astronomical units (AU)—five percent of the distance between the Earth and Sun; the main dip in brightness arises when the larger fainter companion passes in front of the hotter brighter primary. The tertiary component is a main sequence star of type A7, which is located on average 2.69 AU from the other two stars. AG Persei is another Algol variable in Perseus, whose primary component is a B-type main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 6.69. Phi Persei is a double star, although the two components do not eclipse each other. The primary star is a Be star of spectral type B0.5, possibly a giant star, and the secondary companion is likely a stellar remnant. The secondary has a similar spectral type to O-type subdwarfs.

With the historical name Mirfak (Arabic for &quot;elbow&quot;) or Algenib, Alpha Persei is the brightest star of this constellation with an apparent magnitude of 1.79. A supergiant of spectral type F5Ib located around 590 light-years away from Earth, Mirfak has 5,000 times the luminosity and 42 times the diameter of the Sun. It is the brightest member of the Alpha Persei Cluster (also known as &quot;Melotte 20&quot; and &quot;Collinder 39&quot;), which is an open cluster containing many luminous stars. Neighboring bright stars that are members include the Be stars Delta (magnitude 3.0), Psi (4.3), and 48 Persei (4.0); the Beta Cephei variable Epsilon Persei (2.9); and the stars 29 (5.2), 30 (5.5), 31 (5.0), and 34 Persei (4.7). Of magnitude 4.05, nearby Iota Persei has been considered a member of the group, but is actually located a mere 34 light-years distant. This star is very similar to the Sun, shining with 2.2 times its luminosity. It is a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G0V. Extensive searches have failed to find evidence of it having a planetary system.

Zeta Persei is the third-brightest star in the constellation at magnitude 2.86. Around 750 light-years from Earth, it is a blue-white supergiant 26–27 times the radius of the Sun and 47,000 times its luminosity. It is the brightest star (as seen from Earth) of a moving group of bright blue-white giant and supergiant stars, the Perseus OB2 Association or Zeta Persei Association. Zeta is a triple star system, with a companion blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B8 and apparent magnitude 9.16 around 3,900 AU distant from the primary, and a white main sequence star of magnitude 9.90 and spectral type A2, some 50,000 AU away, that may or may not be gravitationally bound to the other two. X Persei is a double system in this association; one component is a hot, bright star and the other is a neutron star. With an apparent magnitude of 6.72, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye even in perfectly dark conditions. The system is an X-ray source and the primary star appears to be undergoing substantial mass loss. Once thought to be a member of the Perseus OB2 Association, Omicron Persei (Atik) is a multiple star system with a combined visual magnitude of 3.85. It is composed of two blue-white stars—a giant of spectral class B1.5 and main sequence star of B3—which orbit each other every 4.5 days and are distorted into ovoids due to their small separation. The system has a third star about which little is known. At an estimated distance of 1,475 light-years from Earth, the system is now thought to lie too far from the center of the Zeta Persei group to belong to it.

GRO J0422+32 (V518 Persei) is another X-ray binary in Perseus. One component is a red dwarf star of spectral type M4.5V, which orbits a mysterious dense and heavy object—possibly a black hole—every 5.1 hours. The system is an X-ray nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. If the system does indeed contain a black hole, it would be the smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises questions as to what the object actually is as it appears to be too small to be a black hole.

GK Persei, also known as Nova Persei 1901, is a bright nova that appeared halfway between Algol and Delta Persei. Discovered on 21 February 1901 by Scottish amateur astronomer Thomas David Anderson, it peaked at magnitude 0.2—almost as bright as Capella and Vega. It faded to magnitude 13 around 30 years after its peak brightness. Xi Persei, traditionally known as Menkhib, a blue giant of spectral type O7III, is one of the hottest bright stars in the sky, with a surface temperature of 37,500 K. It is one of the more massive stars, being between 26 and 32 solar masses, and is 330,000 times as luminous as the Sun.

Named Gorgonea Tertia, Rho Persei varies in brightness like Algol, but is a pulsating rather than eclipsing star. At an advanced stage of stellar evolution, it is a red giant that has expanded for the second time to have a radius around 150 times that of the Sun. Its helium has been fused into heavier elements and its core is composed of carbon and oxygen. It is a semiregular variable star of the Mu Cephei type, whose apparent magnitude varies between 3.3 and 4.0 with periods of 50, 120 and 250 days. The Double Cluster contains three even larger stars, each over 700 solar radii: S, RS, and SU Persei are all semiregular pulsating M-type supergiants. The stars are not visible to the naked eye; SU Persei, the brightest of the three, has an apparent magnitude of 7.9 and thus is visible through binoculars. AX Persei is another binary star, the primary component is a red giant in an advanced phase of stellar evolution, which is transferring material onto an accretion disc around a smaller star. The star system is one of the few eclipsing symbiotic binaries, but is unusual because the secondary star is not a white dwarf, but an A-type star. DY Persei is a variable star that is the prototype of DY Persei variables, which are carbon-rich R Coronae Borealis variables that exhibit the variability of asymptotic giant branch stars. DY Persei itself is a carbon star that is too dim to see through binoculars, with an apparent magnitude of 10.6.

Seven stars in Perseus have been found to have planetary systems. V718 Persei is a star in the young open cluster IC 348 that appears to be periodically eclipsed by a giant planet every 4.7 years. This has been inferred to be an object with a maximum mass of 6 times that of Jupiter and an orbital radius of 3.3 AU.

===Deep-sky objects===

The galactic plane of the Milky Way passes through Perseus, but is much less obvious than elsewhere in the sky as it is mostly obscured by molecular clouds. The Perseus Arm is a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy and stretches across the sky from the constellation Cassiopeia through Perseus and Auriga to Gemini and Monoceros. This segment is towards the rim of the galaxy.

Within the Perseus Arm lie two open clusters (NGC 869 and NGC 884) known as the Double Cluster. Sometimes known as h and Chi (χ) Persei, respectively, they are easily visible through binoculars and small telescopes. Both lie more than 7,000 light-years from Earth and are several hundred light-years apart. Both clusters are of approximately magnitude 4 and 0.5 degrees in diameter. The two are Trumpler class I 3 r clusters, though NGC 869 is a Shapley class f and NGC 884 is a Shapley class e cluster. These classifications indicate that they are both quite rich (dense); NGC 869 is the richer of the pair. The clusters are both distinct from the surrounding star field and are clearly concentrated at their centers. The constituent stars, numbering over 100 in each cluster, range widely in brightness.

M34 is an open cluster that appears at magnitude 5.5, and is approximately 1,500 light-years from Earth. It contains about 100 stars scattered over a field of view larger than that of the full moon. M34 can be resolved with good eyesight but is best viewed using a telescope at low magnifications. IC 348 is a somewhat young open cluster that is still contained within the nebula from which its stars formed. It is located about 1,027 light-years from Earth, is about 2 million years old, and contains many stars with circumstellar disks. Many brown dwarfs have been discovered in this cluster due to its age; since brown dwarfs cool as they age, it is easier to find them in younger clusters.

There are many nebulae in Perseus. M76 is a planetary nebula, also called the Little Dumbbell Nebula. It appears two arc-minutes by one arc-minute across and has an apparent brightness of magnitude 10.1. NGC 1499, also known as the California Nebula, is an emission nebula that was discovered in 1884–85 by American astronomer Edward E. Barnard. It is very difficult to observe visually because its low surface brightness makes it appear dimmer than most other emission nebulae. NGC 1333 is a reflection nebula and a star-forming region. Perseus also contains a giant molecular cloud, called the Perseus molecular cloud; it belongs to the Orion Spur and is known for its low rate of star formation compared to similar clouds.

Perseus contains some notable galaxies. NGC 1023 is a barred spiral galaxy of magnitude 10.35, around from Earth. It is the principal member of the NGC 1023 group of galaxies and is possibly interacting with another galaxy. NGC 1260 is either a lenticular or tightly wound spiral galaxy about from Earth. It was the host galaxy of the supernova SN 2006gy, one of the brightest ever recorded. It is a member of the Perseus Cluster (Abell 426), a massive galaxy cluster located from Earth. With a redshift of 0.0179, Abell 426 is the closest major cluster to the Earth. NGC 1275, a component of the cluster, is a Seyfert galaxy containing an active nucleus that produces jets of material, surrounding the galaxy with massive bubbles. These bubbles create sound waves that travel through the Perseus Cluster, sounding a B flat 57 octaves below middle C. This galaxy is a cD galaxy that has undergone many galactic mergers throughout its existence, as evidenced by the &quot;high velocity system&quot;—the remnants of a smaller galaxy—surrounding it. Its active nucleus is a strong source of radio waves. 3C 31 is an active galaxy and radio source in Perseus 237 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.0173). Its jets, caused by the supermassive black hole at its center, extend several million light-years in opposing directions, making them some of the largest objects in the universe.

===Meteor showers===
The Perseids are a prominent annual meteor shower that appear to radiate from Perseus from mid-July, peaking in activity between 9 and 14 August each year. Associated with Comet Swift–Tuttle, they have been observed for about 2,000 years. The September Epsilon Perseids, discovered in 2012, are a meteor shower with an unknown parent body in the Oort cloud.

<text>Civil society can be understood as the &quot;third sector&quot; of society, distinct from government and business, and including the family and the private sphere. By other authors, &quot;civil society&quot; is used in the sense of
1) the aggregate of non-governmental organizations and institutions that advance the interests and will of citizens or
2) individuals and organizations in a society which are independent of the government.

Sometimes the term &quot;civil society&quot; is used in the more general sense of &quot;the elements such as freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, etc, that make up a democratic society&quot; (&quot;Collins English Dictionary&quot;). Especially in the discussions among thinkers of Eastern and Central Europe, civil society is seen also as a normative concept of civic values.

==Etymology==
In his work &quot;Politics&quot;, the philosopher Aristotle presents the term &quot;koinōnía politikḗ&quot; (), which means a &quot;political community&quot;, like the city-state (&quot;polis&quot;), established for collective survival. The &quot;telos&quot;, or goal of the &quot;political community&quot;, thus defined, was eudaimonia (, &quot;tò eu zēn&quot;), often translated as human flourishing or common well-being, in which man is defined as a ‘political (social) animal’ ( &quot;zōon politikón&quot;). The concept was used by Roman writers, such as Cicero, where it referred to the ancient notion of a republic (&quot;res publica&quot;). It re-entered into Western political discourse following one of the late medieval translations of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Politics&quot; into Latin by Leonardo Bruni, who translated &quot;koinōnía politikḗ&quot; into &quot;societas civilis&quot; (&quot;civil society&quot;). With the rise of a distinction between monarchical autonomy and public law, the term then gained currency to denote the corporate estates (&quot;Ständestaat&quot;) of a feudal ruling class of land-holders, as opposed to the powers exercised by the prince, or monarch. The term civil society has had a long history in state theory and was revived with particular force in the late 20th century in Eastern Europe, where dissidents such as Václav Havel as late as the 1990s employed it to denote the sphere of civic associations threatened by the intrusive holistic state-dominated regimes of Communist Eastern Europe. The first post-modern usage of civil society as denoting political opposition stems from the writings of Aleksander Smolar in 1978–79. However, the term was not used by the Solidarity labor union in 1980–1981.

==Democracy==
The ancient Romans were aware of the connections between democracy and a cooperative society, versus a monarchy and a competitive, or uncooperative society. The historian Cassius Dio makes an argument in the voice of Augustus&#x27;s general Agrippa beseeching Augustus, having defeated his rivals for power in the Roman civil wars, not to overthrow the Roman republic because of its expected effect on society.

The literature on relations between civil society and democratic political society has its immediate origins in Scottish Enlightenment philosophy, including Adam Ferguson&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on the History of Civil Society&quot;, and in the work of G. W. F. Hegel, from whom the concepts were adapted by Alexis de Tocqueville, Karl Marx, and Ferdinand Tönnies. They were developed in significant ways by 20th century researchers Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba, who identified the role of political culture in a democratic order as vital.

They argued that the political element of political organizations facilitates better awareness and a more informed citizenry, who make better voting choices, participate in politics, and hold government more accountable as a result. Civil society acts as a forum for people with common goals and interests to further develop democratic ideals, which in turn can lead to a more democratic state. Membership in these kinds of associations serves as a source of information which reduces the barriers to collective action. These groups then affect policy by putting pressure on governments. This implies that civil society serves to balance the power of the state. The statutes of these political organizations have been considered micro-constitutions because they accustom participants to the formalities of democratic decision making.

More recently, Robert D. Putnam has argued that even non-political organizations in civil society are vital for democracy because they build social capital, trust, and shared values within a society. Social capital, as defined as the social networks and norms of reciprocity associated with them, can help societies resolve dilemmas of collective action; individuals with dense social networks are more likely to credibly commit to other members of society and leverage their social capital to build public goods. In turn, countries with strong civil societies are more likely to succeed as democracies. Some scholars have built on Putnam&#x27;s claim and argued that the participation of a specific type of civil society organization—non-political organizations rooted in quotidian relationships—in the democratic transition process is what drives successful democratic transitions. Gianfranco Poggi argues this as well, saying that interpersonal trust is needed if republican society is to be maintained.

Others, however, have questioned the link between civil society and robust democracy. As Thomas Carothers points out, civil societies do not necessarily form for worthy reasons nor do they necessarily promote democratic values. For example, Sheri Berman argued that civil society organizations can actually be used to mobilize people against democracy. This was evident in fall of the Weimar Republic in Germany. The Weimar Republic&#x27;s failure to address the ravages of economic depression, and domestic struggles, led to the creation of a multitude of German civil societies. A defining and arguable fatal flaw of these groups was they reinforced societal conflicts and differences among Germans. This separation of German society into individual social groups meant they were incredibly vulnerable to nationalist ideals. Nazis infiltrated these discontent groups where they eventually became the backbone and foundation for the party and its propaganda. As a result, the Nazi party transformed itself from a place of political irrelevancy to the largest party in the German Reichstag after the 1932 elections. Contrary to Putnam&#x27;s argument, in this instance, a dense civil society network had damaged democracy. The Nazi Party exploited the societal organization of Germany ultimately leading to the fall of the nation&#x27;s first ever republic.

Even in well-established democracies, the proliferation of special interest groups—which signal a strong civil society—can potentially impede the functioning of representative institutions and distort policy outcomes in favor of the wealthy, well-connected, or well-organized. Moreover, based on survey data collected by Kenneth Newton, there is little evidence that social and political trust overlap, which renders the relationship between the strength of civil society and democracy obsolete. Indeed, as Larry Diamond asserts, in order to understand the multitude of ways civil society can serve democracy, it is also necessary to understand the tensions and contradictions civil society generates for democracy.

In the United States, Tocqueville states that the tendency to form associations that would manifest into civil societies has propelled its success as a democratic government. Putnam argues that the strength of civil societies in the U.S. have historically brought more social trust and more social capital for citizens. Others state that a dependence on civil societies can lead citizens to question the effectiveness of the U.S. government and can create instability by dividing society.

In modern America, Yuval Levin writes that civil societies are considered to be a gateway between the U.S. government and citizens Some state that civil societies help maintain individual freedoms as a check to the U.S. government&#x27;s power, while others see its role as upholding the state&#x27;s efforts by helping it fuel social causes while constraining the un-democratic consolidation of power. Others, such as David Rieff, point out that the U.S. government is more financially equipped to work on social causes than civil societies like NGOs, who prove inadequate due to their lack of relative strength. Research by Harvard professor Theda Skocpol indicates that though civil societies have brought more democracy to America, the shift from large unions and organizations to smaller movements targeting specific political issues is less likely to spur large-scale participation in democracy. Galston and Levine state these new civil societies have proved to be less likely to engage in the political process and more likely to bring social activism.

==Political participation==
Civil society organizations provide citizens with knowledge crucial to political participation, such as the obligations and rights of citizens with regard to government processes, different types of political issues and policy agendas, ways in which citizens can collaborate to address societal issues, and approaches to creating meaningful change in communities. Professors Carew E. Boulding and Jami Nelson-Núñez assert that civil society organizations are beneficial in that citizens are more inclined to participate politically when they can act collectively and develop associative solidarities with others around shared policy preferences. Other scholars, however, note that there are some drawbacks of civil society organizations as it pertains to political participation and policy processes. Professor Thomas Carothers have explained that, because civil society organizations have such an influential role in political participation, the proliferation of these organizations has made it increasingly difficult for governments to meet both the widening range of policy preferences and rapidly changing social needs. The scholar David Rieff discusses another issue tied to civil society and political participation: single-issue activism. Since most civil society organizations focus on one sector or societal issue, this sometimes causes voters to shift their attention away from the multifaceted broad issues facing society, such as the challenges of globalization, and instead the focus of elections becomes centered on a few specific hot-button topics, such as abortion.

There is a considerable amount of data supporting the notion that civil society organizations significantly increase political participation. Dr. Robert Putnam conducted a study of civil society in Italy in the mid-1900s, and observed that those who were engaged with civil society organizations demonstrated greater “political sophistication, social trust, political participation, and ‘subjective civic competence’” than those not involved in these organizations. Similarly, Dr. Sheri Berman found that the NSDAP (Nazi Party) civil society organization leveraged strong civil society networks among the middle class together for the purpose of mobilizing for political participation in Germany. The powerful influence of these efforts is evidenced by the NSDAP becoming the most potent political force in the nation in the mid-1900s. These case studies provide evidence of the crucial role of social networks in facilitating political participation and civic engagement.

== Economics ==
A strong civil society is often considered to be important for economic growth, with reasoning being that it can give important input on economic decisions, facilitate private enterprise and entrepreneurship, and prevent the state from stifling the economy. For example, labor leaders can ensure that economic growth benefits working people, faith leaders can advocate for greater inclusion in economic affairs, NGOs can flag and document harmful business practices, etc.

Essentially, civil society creates social capital, which the World Bank defines as &quot;the institutions, relationships, and norms that shape the quality and quantity of a society&#x27;s social interactions&quot;. With higher social capital comes a greater amount of social interdependence, which increases productivity and economic growth. For example, one study found that high school drop out rates in areas within the United States with better social networks were lower than in areas with weaker social networks.

Some, like Thomas Carothers, somewhat dispute this narrative. He argues that although civil society is beneficial toward economic growth, it is not &quot;necessary&quot;, which he illustrates through how South Korea&#x27;s great economic success was built without a strong civil society, which only appeared after economic growth had more than took off, as well as how Bangladesh, with an incredibly rich civil society, has largely failed to grow its economy, remaining one of the poorest countries in the world. Going even further, Carothers also points out how too much civil society, at least in certain sectors, can lead to harmful economic impacts, citing how some economists believe labor unions in Latin America have restricted economic growth.

==Constitutional economics==
Constitutional economics is a field of economics and constitutionalism which describes and analyzes the specific interrelationships between constitutional issues and functioning of the economy including budget process. The term &quot;constitutional economics&quot; was used by American economist James M. Buchanan as a name for a new budget planning and the latter&#x27;s transparency to the civil society, are of the primary guiding importance to the implementation of the rule of law. Also, the availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of any previously authorized appropriations, becomes a key element for the success of any influential civil society.

==Global==

Critics and activists currently often apply the term &quot;civil society&quot; to the domain of social life which needs to be protected against globalization, and to the sources of resistance thereto, because it is seen as acting beyond boundaries and across different territories. However, as civil society can be funded by foreign businesses and institutions, who support globalization, this is a contested use. Rapid development of civil society on the global scale after the fall of the communist system was a part of neo-liberal strategies linked to the Washington Consensus. Some studies have also been published, which deal with unresolved issues regarding the use of the term in connection with the impact and conceptual power of the international aid system (see for example Tvedt 1998).

On the other hand, others see globalization as a social phenomenon expanding the sphere of classical liberal values, which inevitably led to a larger role for civil society at the expense of politically derived state institutions.

The integrated Civil Society Organizations (iCSO) System, developed by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), facilitates interactions between civil society organizations and DESA.

Civil societies also have become involved in the environmental policy making process. These groups impact environmental policies by setting an agenda on fixing the harm done to the environment. They also get the public informed about environmental issues, which increases the public demand for environmental change.

==History==

From a historical perspective, the actual meaning of the concept of civil society has changed twice from its original, classical form. The first change occurred after the French Revolution, the second during the fall of communism in Europe.

===Western antiquity===
The concept of civil society in its pre-modern classical republican understanding is usually connected to the early-modern thought of Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century. However, it has much older history in the realm of political thought. Generally, civil society has been referred to as a political association governing social conflict through the imposition of rules that restrain citizens from harming one another. In the classical period, the concept was used as a synonym for the good society, and seen as indistinguishable from the state. For instance, Socrates taught that conflicts within society should be resolved through public argument using ‘dialectic’, a form of rational dialogue to uncover truth. According to Socrates, public argument through ‘dialectic’ was imperative to ensure ‘civility’ in the polis and ‘good life’ of the people. For Plato, the ideal state was a just society in which people dedicate themselves to the common good, practice civic virtues of wisdom, courage, moderation and justice, and perform the occupational role to which they were best suited. It was the duty of the ‘philosopher king’ to look after people in civility. Aristotle thought the polis was an ‘association of associations’ that enables citizens to share in the virtuous task of ruling and being ruled. His &quot;koinonia politike&quot; described a political community.

The concept of &quot;societas civilis&quot; is Roman and was introduced by Cicero. The political discourse in the classical period, places importance on the idea of a ‘good society’ in ensuring peace and order among the people. The philosophers in the classical period did not make any distinction between the state and society. Rather they held that the state represented the civil form of society and ‘civility’ represented the requirement of good citizenship. Moreover, they held that human beings are inherently rational so that they can collectively shape the nature of the society they belong to. In addition, human beings have the capacity to voluntarily gather for the common cause and maintain peace in society. By holding this view, we can say that classical political thinkers endorsed the genesis of civil society in its original sense.

The Middle Ages saw major changes in the topics discussed by political philosophers. Due to the unique political arrangements of feudalism, the concept of classical civil society practically disappeared from mainstream discussion. Instead conversation was dominated by problems of just war, a preoccupation that would last until the end of Renaissance.

===Early modern history===
The Thirty Years&#x27; War and the subsequent Treaty of Westphalia heralded the birth of the sovereign states system. The Treaty endorsed states as territorially-based political units having sovereignty. As a result, the monarchs were able to exert domestic control by circumventing the feudal lords by raising their own armed troops. Henceforth, monarchs could form national armies and deploy a professional bureaucracy and fiscal departments, which enabled them to maintain direct control and authority over their subjects. In order to meet administrative expenditures, monarchs exerted greater control over the economy. This gave birth to absolutism. Until the mid-eighteenth century, absolutism was the hallmark of Europe.

The absolutist concept of the state was disputed in the Enlightenment period. As a natural consequence of Renaissance, Humanism, and the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment thinkers raised fundamental questions such as &quot;What legitimacy does heredity confer?&quot;, &quot;Why are governments instituted?&quot;, &quot;Why do some human beings have more basic rights than others?&quot;, and so on. These questions led them to make certain assumptions about the nature of the human mind, the sources of political and moral authority, the reasons behind absolutism, and how to move beyond absolutism. The Enlightenment thinkers believed in the power of the human mind to reason. They opposed the alliance between the state and the Church as the enemy of human progress and well-being because the coercive apparatus of the state curbed individual liberty and the Church legitimated monarchs by positing the theory of divine origin. Therefore, both were deemed to be against the will of the people.

Strongly influenced by the atrocities of Thirty Years&#x27; War, the political philosophers of the time held that social relations should be ordered in a different way from natural law conditions. Some of their attempts led to the emergence of social contract theory that contested social relations existing in accordance with human nature. They held that human nature can be understood by analyzing objective realities and natural law conditions. Thus they endorsed that the nature of human beings should be encompassed by the contours of state and established positive laws. Thomas Hobbes underlined the need of a powerful state to maintain civility in society. For Hobbes, human beings are motivated by self-interests (Graham 1997:23). Moreover, these self-interests are often contradictory in nature. Therefore, in state of nature, there was a condition of a war of all against all. In such a situation, life was &quot;solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short&quot; (Ibid: 25). Upon realizing the danger of anarchy, human beings became aware of the need of a mechanism to protect them. As far as Hobbes was concerned, rationality and self-interests persuaded human beings to combine in agreement, to surrender sovereignty to a common power (Kaviraj 2001:289). Hobbes called this common power, state, Leviathan.

John Locke had a similar concept to Hobbes about the political condition in England. It was the period of the Glorious Revolution, marked by the struggle between the divine right of the Crown and the political rights of Parliament. This influenced Locke to forge a social contract theory of a limited state and a powerful society. In Locke&#x27;s view, human beings led also an unpeaceful life in the state of nature. However, it could be maintained at the sub-optimal level in the absence of a sufficient system (Brown 2001:73). From that major concern, people gathered together to sign a contract and constituted a common public authority. Nevertheless, Locke held that the consolidation of political power can be turned into autocracy, if it is not brought under reliable restrictions (Kaviraj 2001:291). Therefore, Locke set forth two treaties on government with reciprocal obligations. In the first treaty, people submit themselves to the common public authority. This authority has the power to enact and maintain laws. The second treaty contains the limitations of authority, i. e., the state has no power to threaten the basic rights of human beings. As far as Locke was concerned, the basic rights of human beings are the preservation of life, liberty and property. Moreover, he held that the state must operate within the bounds of civil and natural laws.

Both Hobbes and Locke had set forth a system, in which peaceful coexistence among human beings could be ensured through social pacts or contracts. They considered civil society as a community that maintained civil life, the realm where civic virtues and rights were derived from natural laws. However, they did not hold that civil society was a separate realm from the state. Rather, they underlined the co-existence of the state and civil society. The systematic approaches of Hobbes and Locke (in their analysis of social relations) were largely influenced by the experiences in their period. Their attempts to explain human nature, natural laws, the social contract and the formation of government had challenged the divine right theory. In contrast to divine right, Hobbes and Locke claimed that humans can design their political order. This idea had a great impact on the thinkers in the Enlightenment period.

The Enlightenment thinkers argued that human beings are rational and can shape their destiny. Hence, no need of an absolute authority to control them. Both Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a critic of civil society, and Immanuel Kant argued that people are peace lovers and that wars are the creation of absolute regimes (Burchill 2001:33). As far as Kant was concerned, this system was effective to guard against the domination of a single interest and check the tyranny of the majority (Alagappa 2004:30).

===Modern history===

G. W. F. Hegel completely changed the meaning of civil society, giving rise to a modern liberal understanding of it as a form of non-political society as opposed to institutions of modern nation state. While in classical republicanism civil society where synonymous with political society, Hegel distinguished political state and civil society, what was followed by Tocqueville&#x27;s distinction between civil and political societies and associations, repeated by Marx and Tönnies.

Unlike his predecessors, Hegel considered civil society () as a separate realm, a &quot;system of needs&quot;, that is the, &quot;[stage of] difference which intervenes between the family and the state&quot;. Civil society is the realm of economic relationships as it exists in the modern industrial capitalist society, for it had emerged at the particular period of capitalism and served its interests: individual rights and private property. Hence, he used the German term &quot;bürgerliche Gesellschaft&quot; to denote civil society as &quot;civilian society&quot; – a sphere regulated by the civil code. This new way of thinking about civil society was followed by Alexis de Tocqueville and Karl Marx as well. For Hegel, civil society manifested contradictory forces. Being the realm of capitalist interests, there is a possibility of conflicts and inequalities within it (ex: mental and physical aptitude, talents and financial circumstances). He argued that these inequalities influence the choices that members are able to make in relation to the type of work they will do. The diverse positions in Civil Society fall into three estates: the substantial estate (agriculture), the formal estate (trade and industry), and the universal estate (civil society). A man is able to choose his estate, though his choice is limited by the aforementioned inequalities. However, Hegel argues that these inequalities enable all estates in Civil Society to be filled, which leads to a more efficient system on the whole.

Karl Marx followed the Hegelian way of using the concept of civil society. For Marx, the emergence of the modern state created a realm of civil society that reduced society to private interests competing against each other. Political society was autonomized into the state, which was in turn ruled by the bourgeois class (consider also that suffrage only belonged, then, to propertied men). Marx, in his early writings, anticipated the abolition of the separation between state and civil society, and looked forward to the reunification of private and public/political realms (Colletti, 1975). Hence, Marx rejected the positive role of state put forth by Hegel. Marx argued that the state cannot be a neutral problem solver. Rather, he depicted the state as the defender of the interests of the bourgeoisie. He considered the state to be the executive arm of the bourgeoisie, which would wither away once the working class took democratic control of society.

The above view about civil society was criticised by Antonio Gramsci (Edwards 2004:10). Departing somewhat from Marx, Gramsci did not consider civil society as a realm of private and alienated relationships. Rather, Gramsci viewed civil society as the vehicle for bourgeois hegemony, when it just represents a particular class. He underlined the crucial role of civil society as the contributor of the cultural and ideological capital required for the survival of the hegemony of capitalism. Rather than posing it as a problem, as in earlier Marxist conceptions, Gramsci viewed civil society as the site for problem-solving. Misunderstanding Gramsci, the New Left assigned civil society a key role in defending people against the state and the market and in asserting the democratic will to influence the state. At the same time, neo-liberal thinkers consider civil society as a site for struggle to subvert Communist and authoritarian regimes. Thus, the term civil society occupies an important place in the political discourses of the New Left and neo-liberals.

===Post-modern history===

It is commonly believed that the post-modern way of understanding civil society was first developed by political opposition in the former Soviet bloc East European countries in the 1980s. However, research shows that communist propaganda had the most important influence on the development and popularization of the idea instead, in an effort to legitimize neoliberal transformation in 1989. According to theory of restructurization of welfare systems, a new way of using the concept of civil society became a neoliberal ideology legitimizing development of the third sector as a substitute for the welfare state. The recent development of the third sector is a result of this welfare systems restructuring, rather than of democratization.

From that time stems a political practice of using the idea of civil society instead of political society. Henceforth, postmodern usage of the idea of civil society became divided into two main ones: as political society and as the third sector – apart from plethora of definitions. The Washington Consensus of the 1990s, which involved conditioned loans by the World Bank and IMF to debt-laden developing states, also created pressures for states in poorer countries to shrink. This in turn led to practical changes for civil society that went on to influence the theoretical debate. Initially the new conditionality led to an even greater emphasis on &quot;civil society&quot; as a panacea, replacing the state&#x27;s service provision and social care, Hulme and Edwards suggested that it was now seen as &quot;the magic bullet&quot;.

By the end of the 1990s civil society was seen less as a panacea amid the growth of the anti-globalization movement and the transition of many countries to democracy; instead, civil society was increasingly called on to justify its legitimacy and democratic credentials. This led to the creation by the UN of a high level panel on civil society. However, in the 1990s with the emergence of the nongovernmental organizations and the new social movements (NSMs) on a global scale, civil society as a third sector became treated as a key terrain of strategic action to construct ‘an alternative social and world order.’ Post-modern civil society theory has now largely returned to a more neutral stance, but with marked differences between the study of the phenomena in richer societies and writing on civil society in developing states.

==Link to the public sphere==
Jürgen Habermas said that the public sphere encourages rational will-formation; it is a sphere of rational and democratic social interaction. Habermas analyzes civil society as a sphere of &quot;commodity exchange and social labor&quot; and public sphere as a part of political realm. Habermas argues that even though society was representative of capitalist society, there are some institutions that were part of political society. Transformations in economy brought transformations to the public sphere. Though these transformations happen, a civil society develops into political society when it emerges as non-economic and has a populous aspect, and when the state is not represented by just one political party. There needs to be a locus of authority, and this is where society can begin to challenge authority. Jillian Schwedler points out that civil society emerges with the resurrection of the public sphere when individuals and groups begin to challenge boundaries of permissible behaviour – for example, by speaking out against the regime or demanding a government response to social needs – civil society begins to take shape.
