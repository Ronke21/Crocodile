<text>Escitalopram, sold under the brand names Lexapro and Cipralex, among others, is an antidepressant medication of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It is mainly used to treat major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Escitalopram is taken by mouth. For commercial use, it is formulated as an oxalate salt exclusively.
Common side effects include headache, nausea, sexual problems, mild sedation, and trouble sleeping. More serious side effects may include suicidal thoughts in people up to the age of 24 years. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. Escitalopram is the (&quot;S&quot;)-enantiomer of citalopram (which exists as a racemate), hence the name &quot;es&quot;-citalopram.
Escitalopram was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. Escitalopram is rarely replaced by twice the dose of citalopram; escitalopram is safer and more effective. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the second most prescribed antidepressant and fifteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 30million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023.

The drug is often found to have superior efficacy to other antidepressants in alleviating the symptoms of depression and anxiety, followed by another SSRI, sertraline, but escitalopram is less likely to trigger diarrhea and nausea. Other first-line SSRIs that have similar potency include paroxetine and fluoxetine—the latter is also commonly associated with a gastrointestinal side effect profile.

==Medical uses==
Escitalopram is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents and adults, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults. In European countries including the United Kingdom, it is approved for depression and anxiety disorders; these include: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. In Australia it is approved for major depressive disorder.

===Depression===
Escitalopram is among the most effective and well-tolerated antidepressants for the short-term treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. It is also the safest one to give to children and adolescents.

Controversy existed regarding the effectiveness of escitalopram compared with its predecessor, citalopram. The importance of this issue followed from the greater cost of escitalopram relative to the generic mixture of isomers of citalopram, prior to the expiration of the escitalopram patent in 2012, which led to charges of evergreening. Accordingly, this issue has been examined in at least 10 different systematic reviews and meta analyses. , reviews had concluded (with caveats in some cases) that escitalopram is modestly superior to citalopram in efficacy and tolerability.

=== Anxiety disorders ===
Escitalopram appears to be effective in treating generalized anxiety disorder, with relapse on escitalopram at 20% rather than placebo at 50%, which translates to a number needed to treat of 3.33. Escitalopram appears effective in treating social anxiety disorder as well.

=== Other ===
Escitalopram is effective in reducing the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), whether taken continuously or in the luteal phase only.

==Side effects==
Escitalopram, like other SSRIs, has been shown to affect sexual function, causing side effects such as decreased libido, delayed ejaculation, and anorgasmia.

There is also evidence that SSRIs are correlated with an increase in suicidal ideation. An analysis conducted by the FDA found a statistically insignificant 1.5 to 2.4-fold (depending on the statistical technique used) increase of suicidality among the adults treated with escitalopram for psychiatric indications. The authors of a related study note the general problem with statistical approaches: due to the rarity of suicidal events in clinical trials, it is hard to draw firm conclusions with a sample smaller than two million patients.

Citalopram and escitalopram are associated with a mild dose-dependent QT interval prolongation, which is a measure of how rapidly the heart muscle repolarizes after each heartbeat. Prolongation of the QT interval is a risk factor for torsades de pointes (TdP), a heart rhythm disturbance that is sometimes fatal. Despite the observed change in the QT interval, the risk of TdP from escitalopram appears to be quite low, and it is similar to other antidepressants that are not known to affect the QT interval. A 2013 review discusses several reasons to be optimistic about the safety of escitalopram. It references a crossover study in which 113 subjects were each given four different treatments in randomized order: placebo, 10 mg/day escitalopram, 30 mg/day escitalopram, or 400 mg/day moxifloxacin (a positive control known to cause QTc prolongation). At 10 mg/day, escitalopram increased the QTc interval by 4.5 milliseconds (ms). At 30 mg/day, the QTc increased by 10.7 ms. A QTc increase of less than 60 ms is not likely to confer significant risk. The 30 mg/day escitalopram dose induced significantly less QTc prolongation than a therapeutically equivalent 60 mg/day dose of citalopram, which increased the QTc interval by 18.5 ms. 

More data about the cardiac risk from escitalopram can be found in a large observational study from Sweden that took note of all the medications used by all the patients presenting with TdP, and found the incidence of TdP in escitalopram users to be only 0.7 cases of TdP for every 100,000 patients who took the drug (ages 18-64), and only 4.1 cases of TdP for every 100,000 elderly patients who took the drug (ages 65 and up). Of the 9 antidepressants that were used by patients with TdP, escitalopram ranked 7th by TdP incidence in elderly patients (only venlafaxine and amitriptyline had less risk), and it ranked 5th of 9 by TdP incidence in patients ages 18-64. Antidepressants as a class had a relatively low risk of TdP, and most patients on an antidepressant who experienced TdP were also taking another drug that prolonged QT interval. Specifically, 80% of the escitalopram users who experienced TdP were taking at least one other drug known to cause TdP. For comparison, the most popular antiarrhythmic drug in the study was sotalol with 52,750 users, and sotalol had a TdP incidence of 81.1 cases and 41.2 cases of TdP per 100,000 users in the ≥65 and 18-64-year-old demographics, respectively.

Drugs that prolong the QT interval, such as escitalopram, should be used with caution in those with congenital long QT syndrome or known pre-existing QT interval prolongation, or in combination with other medicines that prolong the QT interval. ECG measurements should be considered for patients with cardiac disease, and electrolyte disturbances should be corrected before starting treatment. In December 2011, the UK implemented new restrictions on the maximum daily doses at 20 mg for adults and 10 mg for those older than 65 years or with liver impairment. The US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada did not similarly order restrictions on escitalopram dosage, only on its predecessor citalopram.

Like other SSRIs, escitalopram has also been reported to cause hyponatremia (low sodium levels), with rates ranging from 0.5 to 32%, which can often be attributed to SIADH. This is typically not dose-dependent and at higher risk for occurrence within the first few weeks of starting treatment.

===Very common effects===
Very common effects (&gt;10% incidence) include:

* Headache (24%)
* Nausea (18%)
* Ejaculation disorder (9–14%)
* Somnolence (4–13%)
* Insomnia (7–12%)

===Common (1–10% incidence)===
Common effects (1–10% incidence) include:
* Abnormal dreams
* Anisocoria
* Anorgasmia
* Anxiety
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Constipation
* Decreased or increased appetite
* Diarrhea
* Dilated pupils
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Excessive sweating
* Fatigue
* Fever
* Impotence (erectile dysfunction)
* Libido changes
* Myalgia (muscular aches and pains)
* Paraesthesia (abnormal skin sensation)
* Restlessness
* Sinusitis (nasal congestion)
* Tremor
* Vomiting
* Yawning
=== Psychomotor effects ===
The most common effect is fatigue or somnolence, particularly in older adults, although patients with pre-existing daytime sleepiness and fatigue may experience paradoxical improvement of these symptoms.

Escitalopram has not been shown to affect serial reaction time, logical reasoning, serial subtraction, multitasking, or Mackworth Clock task performance.

===Sexual dysfunction===
Some people experience persistent sexual side effects when taking SSRIs or after discontinuing them. Symptoms of medication-induced sexual dysfunction from antidepressants include difficulty with orgasm, erection, or ejaculation. Other symptoms may be genital anesthesia, anhedonia, decreased libido, vaginal lubrication issues, and nipple insensitivity in women. Rates are unknown, and there is no established treatment.

===Pregnancy===
Antidepressant exposure (including escitalopram) is associated with shorter duration of pregnancy (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g), and lower Apgar scores (by &lt;0.4 points). Antidepressant exposure is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. There is a tentative association of SSRI use during pregnancy with heart problems in the baby. The advantages of their use during pregnancy may thus not outweigh the possible negative effects on the baby.

===Withdrawal===
Escitalopram discontinuation, particularly abruptly, may cause certain withdrawal symptoms such as &quot;electric shock&quot; sensations, colloquially called &quot;brain shivers&quot; or &quot;brain zaps&quot; by those affected. Frequent symptoms in one study were dizziness (44%), muscle tension (44%), chills (44%), confusion or trouble concentrating (40%), amnesia (28%), and crying (28%). Very slow tapering is recommended. There have been spontaneous reports of discontinuation of escitalopram and other SSRIs and SNRIs, especially when abrupt, leading to dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, anxiety, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. Other symptoms such as panic attacks, hostility, aggression, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), mania, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation can emerge when the dose is adjusted down.

==Overdose==
Excessive doses of escitalopram usually cause relatively minor untoward effects, such as agitation and tachycardia. However, dyskinesia, hypertonia, and clonus may occur in some cases. Therapeutic blood levels of escitalopram are usually in the range of 20–80 μg/L but may reach 80–200 μg/L in the elderly, patients with hepatic dysfunction, and those who are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers or following acute overdose. Monitoring of the drug in plasma or serum is generally accomplished using chromatographic methods. Chiral techniques are available to distinguish escitalopram from its racemate, citalopram.

== Interactions ==
Escitalopram weakly inhibits CYP2D6, and hence may increase plasma levels of some CYP2D6 substrates such as aripiprazole, risperidone, tramadol, codeine, etc. As escitalopram is only a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6, analgesia from tramadol may not be affected. Escitalopram (at the maximum dose of 20mg/day) has been found to increase peak levels of the CYP2D6 substrate desipramine by 40% and total exposure by 100%. Likewise, it has been found to increase peak levels of the CYP2D6 substrate metoprolol by 50% and overall exposure by 82%. Escitalopram does not inhibit CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2E1.

Exposure to escitalopram is increased moderately, by about 50%, when it is taken with omeprazole, a CYP2C19 inhibitor. The authors of this study suggested that this increase is unlikely to be of clinical concern. Combination of citalopram with fluoxetine or fluvoxamine resulted in increased exposure to the escitalopram enantiomer, owing to the strong inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 by these agents. Bupropion, a known strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, has been found to significantly increase citalopram plasma concentration and systemic exposure (peak levels increased by 30%, total exposure increased by 40%); the interaction with escitalopram had not been studied, but some monographs warned of the potential interaction. Citalopram did not affect the pharmacokinetics of bupropion or its metabolites in the study.

Escitalopram should be taken with caution when using St. John&#x27;s wort, ginseng, dextromethorphan (DXM), linezolid, tramadol, and other serotonergic drugs due to the risk of serotonin syndrome. As an SSRI, escitalopram should not be given concurrently with MAOIs.

Escitalopram, similarly to other SSRIs, may increase bleeding risk with NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, mefenamic acid), antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, and garlic supplements due to escitalopram&#x27;s inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation via blocking serotonin transporters on platelets.

Escitalopram can also prolong the QT interval, and hence it is not recommended in patients who are concurrently on other medications that also can prolong the QT interval. These drugs include antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, some antihistamines (astemizole, mizolastine), macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, some 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (except palonosetron), and some antiretrovirals (ritonavir, saquinavir, lopinavir).

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Escitalopram increases intrasynaptic levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin by blocking the reuptake of the neurotransmitter into the presynaptic neuron. Over time, this leads to a downregulation of pre-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which is associated with an improvement in passive stress tolerance, and delayed downstream increase in expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which may contribute to a reduction in negative affective biases.

Of the SSRIs currently available, escitalopram has the highest selectivity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) compared to the norepinephrine transporter (NET), making the side-effect profile relatively mild in comparison to less-selective SSRIs. In addition to its antagonist action at the orthosteric site of SERT, escitalopram also binds to an allosteric site on the transporter, thereby decreasing its disassociation rate. Escitalopram binds to this allosteric site at a greater affinity than other SSRIs. The clinical relevance of this action is unknown. 

===Pharmacokinetics===
Escitalopram is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and hence P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as verapamil and quinidine may improve its blood-brain barrier penetrability. In a preclinical study in rats combining escitalopram with a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, its antidepressant-like effects were enhanced.

==Chemistry==
Escitalopram is the (&quot;S&quot;)-enantiomer (left-handed version) of the racemate citalopram, which is responsible for its name: &quot;es&quot;citalopram. 

==History==

Escitalopram was developed in cooperation between Lundbeck and Forest Laboratories. Its development was initiated in 1997, and the resulting new drug application was submitted to the US FDA in March 2001. The short time (3.5 years) it took to develop escitalopram can be attributed to the previous experience of Lundbeck and Forest with citalopram, which has similar pharmacology.

==Society and culture==
===Brand names===
Escitalopram is sold under many brand names worldwide such as Cipralex, Lexapro, Lexam, Mozarin, Aciprex, Depralin, Ecytara, Elicea, Gatosil, Nexpram, Nexito, Nescital, Szetalo, Stalopam, Pramatis, Betesda, Scippa and Rexipra.

=== Legal status ===
The FDA issued the approval of escitalopram for major depression in August 2002, and for generalized anxiety disorder in December 2003. In May 2006, the FDA approved a generic version of escitalopram by Teva. In July 2006, the U.S. District Court of Delaware decided in favor of Lundbeck regarding a patent infringement dispute and ruled the patent on escitalopram valid.

In 2006, Forest Laboratories was granted an 828-day (2 years and 3 months) extension on its US patent for escitalopram. This pushed the patent expiration date from 7 December 2009, to 14 September 2011. Together with the 6-month pediatric exclusivity, the final expiration date was 14 March 2012.

===Allegations of illegal marketing===
In 2004, separate civil suits alleging illegal marketing of citalopram and escitalopram for use by children and teenagers by Forest were initiated by two whistleblowers: a physician named Joseph Piacentile and a Forest salesman named Christopher Gobble. In February 2009, the suits were joined. Eleven states and the District of Columbia filed notices of intent to intervene as plaintiffs in the action.

The suits alleged that Forest illegally engaged in off-label promotion of Lexapro for use in children; hid the results of a study showing lack of effectiveness in children; paid kickbacks to physicians to induce them to prescribe Lexapro to children; and conducted so-called &quot;seeding studies&quot; that were, in reality, marketing efforts to promote the drug&#x27;s use by doctors. Forest denied the allegations but ultimately agreed to settle with the plaintiffs for over $313 million.

<doc id="201308" wikidata="Q1194725" url="?curid=201308" title="Styrofoam">
<text>Styrofoam is a genericized trademarked brand of closed-cell extruded polystyrene foam (XPS), manufactured to provide continuous building insulation board used in walls, roofs, and foundations as thermal insulation and as a water barrier. This material is light blue in color and is owned and manufactured by DuPont. DuPont also has produced a line of green and white foam shapes for use in crafts and floral arrangements.

The term &quot;styrofoam&quot; is often used in the United States as a colloquial term to refer to expanded (not extruded) polystyrene foam (EPS). Outside the United States, EPS is most commonly referred to as simply &quot;polystyrene&quot; with the term &quot;styrofoam&quot; being used in its capacity to describe all forms of extruded polystyrene, not just the Dupont brand itself. Polystyrene (EPS) is often used in food containers, coffee cups, and as cushioning material in packaging. Styrofoam is, however, a far less dense material than EPS and is more commonly suited to tasks such as thermal insulation.

Additionally, it is moderately soluble in many organic solvents, cyanoacrylate, and the propellants and solvents of spray paint. 

== History ==
In the 1940s, researchers, originally at Dow&#x27;s Chemical Physics Lab, led by Ray McIntire, found a way to make foamed polystyrene. They rediscovered a method first used by Swedish inventor Carl Georg Munters, and obtained an exclusive license to Munters&#x27;s patent in the United States. Dow found ways to adapt Munters&#x27;s method to make large quantities of extruded polystyrene as a closed cell foam that resists moisture. The patent on this adaptation was filed in 1947.

== Uses ==

Styrofoam has a variety of uses. Styrofoam is composed of 98% air, making it lightweight and buoyant.

DuPont produces Styrofoam building materials, including varieties of building insulation sheathing and pipe insulation. The claimed R-value of Styrofoam insulation is approximately 5 °F⋅ft2⋅h/BTU for 1 inch thick sheet.

Styrofoam can be used under roads and other structures to prevent soil disturbances due to freezing and thawing.

DuPont also produces Styrofoam blocks and other shapes for use by florists and in craft products. DuPont insulation Styrofoam has a distinctive blue color; Styrofoam for craft applications is available in white and green.

== Environmental issues ==
The EPA and International Agency for Research on Cancer reported limited evidence that styrene is carcinogenic for humans and experimental animals, meaning that there is a positive association between exposure and cancer and that causality is credible, but that other explanations cannot be confidently excluded.

See also the expansive list of environmental issues of polystyrene, among which it being non-biodegradable.

<doc id="201310" wikidata="Q409672" url="?curid=201310" title="Citalopram">
<text>Citalopram, sold under the brand name Celexa among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It is used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and social phobia. The antidepressant effects may take one to four weeks to occur. It is typically taken orally (swallowed by mouth). In some European countries, it is sometimes given intravenously (injected into a vein) to initiate treatment, before switching to the oral route of administration for continuation of treatment. It has also been used intravenously in other parts of the world in some other circumstances.
Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping, sexual problems, shakiness, feeling tired, and sweating. Serious side effects include an increased risk of suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, glaucoma, and QT prolongation. It should not be used in persons who take or have recently taken an MAO inhibitor. There are concerns that use during pregnancy may harm the fetus.
Citalopram was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 40th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 15million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
===Depression===
In the United States, citalopram is approved to treat major depressive disorder. Citalopram appears to have comparable efficacy and superior tolerability relative to other antidepressants. In the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ranking of ten antidepressants for efficacy and cost-effectiveness, citalopram is fifth in effectiveness (after mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline) and fourth in cost-effectiveness. 

Evidence for the effectiveness of citalopram for treating depression in children is uncertain.

=== Panic disorder ===
Citalopram is licensed in the UK and other European countries for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia.

=== Other ===
Citalopram may be used off-label to treat anxiety, and dysthymia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder.

It appears to be as effective as fluvoxamine and paroxetine in obsessive–compulsive disorder. Some data suggest the effectiveness of intravenous infusion of citalopram in resistant OCD. Citalopram is well tolerated and as effective as moclobemide in social anxiety disorder. There are studies suggesting that citalopram can be useful in reducing aggressive and impulsive behavior. It appears to be superior to placebo for behavioural disturbances associated with dementia. It has also been used successfully for hypersexuality in early Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

A meta-analysis, including studies with fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram versus placebo, showed SSRIs to be effective in reducing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, whether taken continuously or just in the luteal phase. For alcoholism, citalopram has produced a modest reduction alcohol intake and increase in drink-free days in studies of alcoholics, possibly by decreasing desire or reducing the reward.

While on its own citalopram is less effective than amitriptyline in the prevention of migraines, in refractory cases, combination therapy may be more effective.

Citalopram and other SSRIs can be used to treat hot flashes.

A 2009 multisite randomized controlled study found no benefit and some adverse effects in autistic children from citalopram, raising doubts about whether SSRIs are effective for treating repetitive behavior in children with autism.

Some research suggests citalopram interacts with cannabinoid protein-couplings in the rat brain, and this is put forward as a potential cause of some of the drug&#x27;s antidepressant effects.

== Administration ==
Citalopram is typically taken in one dose, either in the morning or evening. It can be taken with or without food. Its absorption does not increase when taken with food, but doing so can help prevent nausea. Nausea is often caused when the 5-HT3 receptors actively absorb free serotonin, as this receptor is present within the digestive tract.

==Adverse effects==
Citalopram theoretically causes side effects by increasing the concentration of serotonin in other parts of the body (e.g., the intestines). Other side effects, such as increased apathy and emotional flattening, may be caused by the decrease in dopamine release associated with increased serotonin. Citalopram is also a mild antihistamine, which may be responsible for some of its sedating properties.

Other common side effects of citalopram include drowsiness, insomnia, nausea, weight changes (usually weight gain), increase in appetite, vivid dreaming, frequent urination, dry mouth, increased sweating, trembling, diarrhea, excessive yawning, severe tinnitus, and fatigue. Less common side effects include bruxism, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmia, blood pressure changes, dilated pupils, anxiety, mood swings, headache, hyperactivity and dizziness. Rare side effects include convulsions, hallucinations, severe allergic reactions and photosensitivity. If sedation occurs, the dose may be taken at bedtime rather than in the morning. Some data suggest citalopram may cause nightmares. Citalopram is associated with a higher risk of arrhythmia than other SSRIs.

Citalopram and other SSRIs can induce a mixed state, especially in those with undiagnosed bipolar disorder.
According to an article published in 2020, one of the other rare side effects of Citalopram could be triggering visual snow syndrome; which does not resolve after the discontinuation of the medicine.

=== Sexual dysfunction ===
Sexual dysfunction is often a side effect of SSRIs. Some people experience persistent sexual side effects when taking SSRIs or after discontinuing them. Symptoms of medication-induced sexual dysfunction from antidepressants include difficulty with orgasm, erection, or ejaculation. Other symptoms may be genital anesthesia, anhedonia, decreased libido, vaginal lubrication issues, and nipple insensitivity in women. Rates are unknown, and there is no established treatment.

=== Abnormal heart rhythm ===
In August 2011, the FDA announced, &quot;Citalopram causes dose-dependent QT interval prolongation. Citalopram should no longer be prescribed at doses greater than 40 mg per day&quot;. A further clarification, issued in March 2012, restricted the maximum dose to 20 mg for subgroups of patients, including those older than 60 years and those taking an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C19.7.

=== Endocrine effects ===
As with other SSRIs, citalopram can cause an increase in serum prolactin level.
Citalopram has no significant effect on insulin sensitivity in women of reproductive age and no changes in glycaemic control were seen in another trial.

=== Exposure in pregnancy ===
Antidepressant exposure (including citalopram) during pregnancy is associated with shorter duration of gestation (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g), and lower Apgar scores (by &lt;0.4 points). Antidepressant exposure is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. It is uncertain whether there is an increased prevalence of septal heart defects among children whose mothers were prescribed an SSRI in early pregnancy.

=== Overdose ===
Overdosage may result in vomiting, sedation, disturbances in heart rhythm, dizziness, sweating, nausea, tremors, and rarely amnesia, confusion, coma, or convulsions. Overdose deaths have occurred, sometimes involving other drugs, but also with citalopram as the sole agent. Citalopram and N-desmethylcitalopram may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma citalopram concentrations are usually in a range of 50-400 μg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 1000–3000 μg/L in patients who survive acute overdosage, and 3–30 mg/L in those who do not survive. It is the most dangerous of SSRIs in overdose.

===Suicidality===
In the United States, citalopram carries a boxed warning stating it may increase suicidal thinking and behavior in those under age 24.

=== Discontinuation syndrome ===
SSRI discontinuation syndrome has been reported when treatment is stopped. It includes sensory, and gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, lethargy, and sleep disturbances, as well as psychological symptoms such as anxiety/agitation, irritability, and poor concentration. Electric shock-like sensations are typical for SSRI discontinuation. Withdrawal symptoms can occur when this medicine is suddenly stopped, such as paraesthesiae, sleeping problems (difficulty sleeping and intense dreams), feeling dizzy, agitated or anxious, nausea, vomiting, tremors, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhea, palpitations, changes in emotions, irritability, and eye or eyesight problems. Treatment with citalopram should be reduced gradually when treatment is finished.

== Interactions ==

=== Serotonin syndrome ===
Citalopram should not be taken with St John&#x27;s wort, tryptophan or 5-HTP as the resulting drug interaction could lead to serotonin syndrome. With St John&#x27;s wort, this may be caused by compounds in the plant extract reducing the efficacy of the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes that process citalopram. Tryptophan and 5-HTP are precursors to serotonin. When taken with an SSRI, such as citalopram, this can lead to levels of serotonin that can be lethal. This may also be the case when SSRIs are taken with SRAs (serotonin releasing agents) such as in the case of MDMA. It is possible that SSRIs could reduce the effects associated with an SRA since SSRIs stop the reuptake of Serotonin by blocking SERT. This would allow less serotonin in and out of the transporters, thus decreasing the likelihood of neurotoxic effects. However, these concerns are still disputed as the exact pharmacodynamic effects of citalopram and MDMA have yet to be fully identified. Citalopram is contraindicated in individuals taking MAOIs, owing to a potential for serotonin syndrome.

=== Other interactions ===
SSRIs, including citalopram, can increase the risk of bleeding, especially when coupled with aspirin, NSAIDs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants. Taking citalopram with omeprazole may cause higher blood levels of citalopram. This is a potentially dangerous interaction, so dosage adjustments may be needed or alternatives may be prescribed.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Citalopram is considered safe and well tolerated in the therapeutic dose range. Distinct from some other agents in its class, it exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and minimal drug interaction potential, making it a better choice for the elderly or comorbid patients.

== Stereochemistry ==
Citalopram has one stereocenter, to which a 4-fluoro phenyl group and an &quot;N, N&quot;-dimethyl-3-aminopropyl group bind. As a result of this chirality, the molecule exists in (two) enantiomeric forms (mirror images). They are termed &quot;S&quot;-(+)-citalopram and &quot;R&quot;-(–)-citalopram.
Citalopram is sold as a racemic mixture, consisting of 50% (&quot;R&quot;)-(−)-citalopram and 50% (&quot;S&quot;)-(+)-citalopram. Only the (&quot;S&quot;)-(+) enantiomer has the desired antidepressant effect. Lundbeck now markets the (&quot;S&quot;)-(+) enantiomer, the generic name of which is escitalopram. Whereas citalopram is supplied as the hydrobromide, escitalopram is sold as the oxalate salt (hydrooxalate). In both cases, the salt forms of the amine make these otherwise lipophilic compounds water-soluble.

==Metabolism==
Citalopram is metabolized in the liver mostly by CYP2C19, but also by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Metabolites desmethylcitalopram and didesmethylcitalopram are significantly less energetic and their contribution to the overall action of citalopram is negligible. The half-life of citalopram is about 35 hours. Approximately 80% is cleared by the liver and 20% by the kidneys. The elimination process is slower in the elderly and in patients with liver or kidney failure. With once-daily dosing, steady plasma concentrations are achieved in about a week. Potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 and 3A4 might decrease citalopram clearance.
Tobacco smoke exposure was found to inhibit the biotransformation of citalopram in animals, suggesting that the elimination rate of citalopram is decreased after tobacco smoke exposure. After intragastric administration, the half-life of the racemic mixture of citalopram was increased by about 287%.

==History==
Citalopram was first synthesized in 1972 by chemist Klaus Bøgesø and his research group at the pharmaceutical company Lundbeck and was first marketed in 1989 in Denmark. It was first marketed in the US in 1998. The original patent expired in 2003, allowing other companies to legally produce and market generic versions.

===European Commission fine===

On 19 June 2013, the European Commission imposed a fine of €93.8 million on the Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck, plus a total of €52.2 million on several generic pharmaceutical-producing companies. This was in response to Lundbeck entering an agreement with the companies to delay their sales of generic citalopram after Lundbeck&#x27;s patent on the drug had expired, thus reducing competition in breach of European antitrust law.

== Other uses ==
Citalopram is also a parasiticide. Schistosomula have high mortality when treated with citalopram.

<text>A mother goddess is a major goddess characterized as a mother or progenitor, either as an embodiment of motherhood and fertility or fulfilling the cosmological role of a creator- and/or destroyer-figure, typically associated the Earth, sky, and/or the life-giving bounties thereof in a maternal relation with humanity or other gods. When equated in this lattermost function with the earth or the natural world, such goddesses are sometimes referred to as the Mother Earth or Earth Mother, deity in various animistic or pantheistic religions. The earth goddess is archetypally the wife or feminine counterpart of the Sky Father or &quot;Father Heaven&quot;, particularly in theologies derived from the Proto-Indo-European sphere (i.e. from Dheghom and Dyeus). In some polytheistic cultures, such as the Ancient Egyptian religion which narrates the cosmic egg myth, the sky is instead seen as the Heavenly Mother or Sky Mother as in Nut and Hathor, and the earth god is regarded as the male, paternal, and terrestrial partner, as in Osiris or Geb who hatched out of the maternal &quot;cosmic egg&quot;.

== Excavations at Çatalhöyük ==

Between 1961 and 1965 James Mellaart led a series of excavations at Çatalhöyük, north of the Taurus Mountains in a fertile agricultural region of South-Anatolia. Striking were the many statues found here, which Mellaart suggested represented a Great goddess, who headed the pantheon of an essentially matriarchal culture. A seated female figure, flanked by what Mellaart describes as lionesses, was found in a grain-bin; she may have intended to protect the harvest and grain. He considered the sites as shrines, with especially the Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük capturing the imagination. There was also a large number of sexless figurines, which Mellaart regarded as typical for a society dominated by women. He wrote that &quot;emphasis on sex in art is invariably connected with male impulse and desire.&quot; The idea that there could have been a matriarchy and a cult of the mother goddess was supported by archaeologist Marija Gimbutas. This gave rise to a modern cult of the Mother Goddess with annual pilgrimages being organized at Çatalhöyük.

Since 1993, excavations were resumed, now headed by Ian Hodder with Lynn Meskell as head of the &quot;Stanford Figurines Project&quot; that examined the figurines of Çatalhöyük. This team came to different conclusions than Gimbutas and Mellaart. Only a few of the figurines were identified as female and these figurines were found not so much in sacred spaces, but seemed to have been discarded randomly, sometimes in garbage heaps. This rendered a cult of the mother goddess in this location as unlikely.

== African religions ==
In Egyptian mythology, sky goddess Nut is sometimes called &quot;Mother&quot; because she bore stars and Sun god. Nut was thought to draw the dead into her star-filled sky, and refresh them with food and wine.

In Kongo religion, the Sky Mother, &quot;Nzambici&quot;, was the female counterpart of the Sky Father and Solar god, Nzambi Mpungu. Originally, they were seen as one spirit with one half male and the other half female. After the introduction of Christianity to Central Africa, the description of Nzambi changed to Creator God and Nzambici to his wife, &quot;God the essence, the god on earth, the great princess, the mother of all the animals, and the mystery of the Earth.&quot;

== Hinduism ==
In Hinduism, Saraswati, Lakshmi, Radha, Parvati, Durga and other goddesses represents both the feminine aspect and the &quot;shakti&quot; (power) of the supreme being known as the &quot;Brahman&quot;. The divine mother goddess, manifests herself in various forms, representing the universal creative force. She becomes Mother Nature (Mula Prakriti), who gives birth to all life forms and nourishes them through her body. Ultimately she re-absorbs all life forms back into herself, or &quot;devours&quot; them to sustain herself as the power of death feeding on life to produce new life. She also gives rise to Maya (the illusory world) and to prakriti, the force that galvanizes the divine ground of existence into self-projection as the cosmos.

The Shakti sect is strongly associated with Samkhya, and Tantra Hindu philosophies and ultimately, is monist. The primordial feminine creative-preservative-destructive energy, Shakti, is considered to be the motive force behind all action and existence in the phenomenal cosmos. The cosmos itself is purusha, the unchanging, infinite, immanent, and transcendent reality that is the divine ground of all being, the &quot;world soul&quot;. This masculine potential is actualized by feminine dynamism, embodied in multitudinous goddesses who are ultimately all manifestations of the one great mother. Shakti, herself, can free the individual from demons of ego, ignorance, and desire that bind the soul in maya (illusion). Practitioners of the Tantric tradition focus on Shakti to free themselves from the cycle of karma.

The worship of the mother deity can be traced back to early Vedic culture. The Rigveda calls the divine female power Mahimata (R.V. 1.164.33) which means &quot;great mother&quot;.

== Christianity ==

Although no Mother Goddess exists in Christianity, both the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church revere Virgin Mary as the Mother of God, a rendering of &quot;Theotokos&quot; and &quot;Deipara&quot; since the Ecumenical Council of Ephesus in 431 AD, and disregard Protestant objections to Marian devotion. She is regarded as &quot;Our Mother&quot;, the &quot;Blessed Mother&quot;, or the &quot;Holy Mother&quot; as she gave birth to Jesus Christ, since Christians alike refer to themselves as &quot;Brothers and Sisters in Christ&quot;. There is a &quot;Pater Noster&quot; but no equivalent &quot;Mater Nostra&quot;, however the Hail Mary and the &quot;Sub Tuum Praesidium&quot; have been popular forms of prayer and praise to Virgin Mary for many centuries. Some may perceive a parallel in calling Mary &quot;Our Mother&quot; and the Almighty Yahweh as &quot;Our Father&quot;. In contrast to the Pagan notion of a fertility goddess, Mary is both the Perpetual Virgin and the Mother of God at the same time, she is not considered the &quot;Heavenly Mother&quot; in reference to God the Father or the &quot;Heavenly Father&quot; as her consort. St Mary has never been referred to as a goddess in the Gospel&#x27;s accounts of the Annunciation, Wedding at Cana, or the Magnificat. Since the Apostolic age the church has believed that Mary entered heaven alive after her death and subsequent resurrection, known as the Assumption in the west and the Dormition in the east. As the foremost saint, some Christians believe she continues to supernaturally intervene in the world through Marian apparitions (Our Lady of Velankanni), Marian shrines (Our Lady of Zeitoun) and Marian devotions (Our Lady of the Rosary). According to Mariology and Scholasticism branches of study, though Mary is venerated as the foremost saint, she is still a creature and never viewed as an equal of the Triune God who is the Creator.

In pre-Islamic Arabia, Collyridians were an unorthodox Christian denomination who reportedly worshipped Virgin Mary by making burnt offerings of dough to her. Ancient Christians viewed the Collyridians as heretics, holding that Mary was only to be honoured, and not to be worshipped like the God-man of Christianity.

== Latter Day Saint movement ==
In the Latter Day Saint movement, particularly the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, many adherents believe in a Heavenly Mother as the wife of God the Father. They are collectively referred to as Heavenly Parents. The theology varies, however, according to the Latter Day Saint denomination. Some believe in multiple Heavenly Mothers married to one Heavenly Father in a polygynous relationship.

== New religious movements ==

Zahng Gil-jah is a South Korean woman, by the World Mission Society Church of God believed to be “God the Mother” (; ). Church members may also call her “New Jerusalem Mother”, “Mother Jerusalem”, or “Heavenly Mother”.

In Theosophy, the Earth goddess is called the &quot;Planetary Logos of Earth&quot;.

The Mother Goddess, or Great Goddess, is a composite of various feminine deities from past and present world cultures, worshiped by modern Wicca and others broadly known as Neopagans. She is considered sometimes identified as a Triple Goddess, who takes the form of Maiden, Mother, and Crone archetypes. She is described as Mother Earth, Mother Nature, or the Creatress of all life. She is associated with the full moon and stars, the Earth, and the sea. In Wicca, the Earth Goddess is sometimes called Gaia. The name of the mother goddess varies depending on the Wiccan tradition. English historian Ronald Hutton, however, has forcefully stated that any use of the term &quot;Mother-Goddess&quot; can be accounted for, and disregarded, as the scholars and mythographers&#x27; own projection of the Virgin Mary onto the evidence and source data. More recently Hutton was criticized in a review for ignoring the evidence of numerous goddesses identified as either mothers or both virgin and mother in pre-Christian antiquity, in addition to providing no evidence or secondary citations with which to substantiate his own position.

Carl Gustav Jung suggested that the archetypal mother was a part of the collective unconscious of all humans; various adherents of Jung, most notably Erich Neumann and Ernst Whitmont, have argued that such an archetype underpins many of its own mythologies and may even precede the image of the paternal &quot;father.&quot; Such speculations help explain the universality of such mother goddess imagery around the world.

The Upper Paleolithic Venus figurines have been sometimes explained as depictions of an Earth Goddess similar to Gaia.

In the Baháʼí Faith, Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah uses the Mother as an attribute of God: &quot;And when He Who is well-grounded in all knowledge, He Who is the Mother, the Soul, the Secret, and the Essence thereof, revealeth that which is the least contrary to their desire, they bitterly oppose Him and shamelessly deny Him.&quot;. Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah further writes that &quot;Every single letter proceeding out of the mouth of God is indeed a Mother Letter, and every word uttered by Him Who is the Well Spring of Divine Revelation is a Mother Word, and His Tablet a Mother Tablet.&quot;

== Prehistoric matriarchy debate ==

There is difference of opinion between the academic and the popular conception of the term &quot;Mother goddess&quot;. The popular view is mainly driven by the Goddess movement and reads that primitive societies initially were matriarchal, worshipping a sovereign, nurturing, motherly earth goddess. This was based upon the nineteenth-century ideas of unilineal evolution of Johann Jakob Bachofen. According to the academic view, however, both Bachofen and the modern Goddess theories are a projection of contemporary world views on ancient myths, rather than attempting to understand the &quot;mentalité&quot; of that time. Often this is accompanied by a desire for a lost civilization from a bygone era that would have been just, peaceful, and wise. However, it is highly unlikely that such a civilization ever existed.

For a long time, feminist authors claimed that these peaceful, matriarchal agrarian societies were exterminated or subjugated by nomadic, patriarchal warrior tribes. An important contribution to this was that of archaeologist Marija Gimbutas. Her work in this field has been questioned. Among feminist archaeologists this vision is nowadays also considered highly controversial.

Since the 1960s, especially in popular culture, the alleged worship of the mother goddess and the social position that women in prehistoric societies supposedly assumed, were linked. This made the debate a political one. According to the goddess movement, the current male-dominated society should return to the egalitarian matriarchy of earlier times (though a matriarchy is not an egalitarian society, but a female-dominated one). That this form of society ever existed was supposedly supported by many figurines that were found.

In academic circles, this prehistoric matriarchy is considered unlikely. Firstly, worshiping a mother goddess does not necessarily mean that women ruled society. In addition, the figurines can also portray ordinary women or goddesses, and it is unclear whether there really ever was a mother goddess.

<text>Samarra (, &quot;&quot;) is a city in Iraq. It stands on the east bank of the Tigris in the Saladin Governorate, north of Baghdad. The modern city of Samarra was founded in 836 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mu&#x27;tasim as a new administrative capital and military base. In 2003 the city had an estimated population of 348,700. During the Iraqi Civil War (2006-08), Samarra was in the &quot;Sunni Triangle&quot; of resistance. 

The archeological site of Samarra still retains much of the historic city&#x27;s original plan, architecture and artistic relics. In 2007, UNESCO designated it a World Heritage Site.

==History==
===Prehistoric Samarra===
The remains of prehistoric Samarra were first excavated between 1911 and 1914 by the German archaeologist Ernst Herzfeld. Samarra became the type site for the Samarra culture. Since 1946, the notebooks, letters, unpublished excavation reports and photographs have been in the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.

The civilization flourished alongside the Ubaid period, as one of the first town states in the Near East. It lasted from 5,500 BCE and eventually collapsed in 3,900 BCE.

=== Neo-Assyrian period ===
A city of Sur-marrati (refounded by Sennacherib in 690 BC according to a stele in the Walters Art Museum) is insecurely identified with a fortified Assyrian site at al-Huwaysh on the Tigris opposite modern Samarra. The State Archives of Assyria Online identifies &quot;Surimarrat&quot; as the modern site of Samarra.

Ancient place names for Samarra noted by the Samarra Archaeological Survey are Greek &quot;Souma&quot; (Ptolemy V.19, Zosimus III, 30), Latin &quot;Sumere&quot;, a fort mentioned during the retreat of the army of Julian in 363 AD (Ammianus Marcellinus XXV, 6, 4), and Syriac &quot;Sumra&quot; (Hoffmann, &quot;Auszüge&quot;, 188; Michael the Syrian, III, 88), described as a village.

The possibility of a larger population was offered by the opening of the Qatul al-Kisrawi, the northern extension of the Nahrawan Canal which drew water from the Tigris in the region of Samarra, attributed by Yaqut al-Hamawi (&quot;Muʿjam&quot;, see under &quot;Qatul&quot;) to Khosrau I (531–578). To celebrate the completion of this project, a commemorative tower (modern Burj al-Qa&#x27;im) was built at the southern inlet south of Samarra, and a palace with a &quot;paradise&quot; or walled hunting park was constructed at the northern inlet (modern Nahr ar-Rasasi) near ad-Dawr. A supplementary canal, the Qatul Abi al-Jund, excavated by the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid, was commemorated by a planned city laid out in the form of a regular octagon (modern Husn al-Qadisiyya), called al-Mubarak and abandoned unfinished in 796.

===Abbasid capital===
In 836 CE, the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mu&#x27;tasim founded a new capital at the banks of the Tigris. Here he built extensive palace complexes surrounded by garrison settlements for his guards, mostly drawn from Central Asia and Iran (most famously the Turks, as well as the Khurasani &quot;Ishtakhaniyya&quot;, &quot;Faraghina&quot; and &quot;Ushrusaniyya&quot; regiments) or North Africa (like the &quot;Maghariba&quot;). Although quite often called Mamluk slave soldiers, their status was quite elevated; some of their commanders bore Sogdian titles of nobility.
The city was further developed under Caliph al-Mutawakkil, who sponsored the construction of lavish palace complexes, such as al-Mutawakkiliyya, and the Great Mosque of Samarra with its famous spiral minaret or Malwiya, built-in 847. For his son al-Mu&#x27;tazz he built the large palace Bulkuwara.
The Nestorian patriarch Sargis (860–72) moved the patriarchal seat of the Church of the East from Baghdad to Samarra, and one or two of his immediate successors may also have sat in Samarra so as to be close to the seat of power.

Samarra remained the residence of the caliph until 892, when al-Mu&#x27;tadid returned the capital to Baghdad. Historical sources report that the city was looted around this time. Its population probably decreased and the city declined, but it remained an important market center. 

From the tenth century onward it turned into an important pilgrimage site. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the river&#x27;s course to the south of the city shifted further east. As a result, the main road between Baghdad and Mosul was moved to the west bank and Samarra lost its importance as a trading town.

===Modern era===
In the eighteenth century, one of the most violent battles of the 1730–1735 Ottoman–Persian War, the Battle of Samarra, took place, where over 50,000 Turks and Persians became casualties. The engagement decided the fate of Ottoman Iraq and kept it under Istanbul&#x27;s suzerainty until the First World War.

During the 1950s, Samarra gained new importance when a permanent lake, Lake Tharthar, was created through the construction of the Samarra Barrage, which was built in order to prevent the frequent flooding of Baghdad. Many local people were displaced by the dam, resulting in an increase in Samarra&#x27;s population.

Samarra is a key city in Saladin Governorate, a major part of the so-called Sunni Triangle where insurgents were active during the Iraq War. Though Samarra is famous for its Shi&#x27;i holy sites, including the tombs of several Shi&#x27;i Imams, the town was traditionally and until very recently, dominated by Sunni Arabs. Tensions arose between Sunnis and the Shi&#x27;a during the Iraq War. On February 22, 2006, the golden dome of the al-Askari Mosque was bombed by Al-Qaeda in Iraq, setting off a period of rioting and reprisal attacks across the country which claimed hundreds of lives. No organization claimed responsibility for the bombing. On June 13, 2007, Sunni insurgents attacked the mosque again and destroyed the two minarets that flanked the dome&#x27;s ruins. On July 12, 2007, the clock tower was blown up. No fatalities were reported. Shiʿi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr called for peaceful demonstrations and three days of mourning. He stated that he believed no Sunni Arab could have been behind the attack, though according to the &quot;New York Times&quot; the attackers were probably Sunnis linked to Al-Qaeda. The mosque compound was closed after the 2006 bombing and a indefinite curfew was placed on the city by the Iraqi police at the time. In 2009, the mosque reopened while restoration was ongoing.

Ever since the end of Iraqi civil war in 2007, the Shia population of the holy city has increased exponentially. However, violence has continued, with bombings taking place in 2011 and 2013. In June 2014, the city was attacked by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) as part of the Northern Iraq offensive. ISIL forces captured the municipality building and university, but were later repulsed by the Iraqi army and SWAT forces after capturing the city and holding it for two days. The nearby Imam Dur Mausoleum, a historic mausoleum dedicated to Muslim ibn Quraysh, a Shi&#x27;i ruler, was destroyed by ISIL in 2014.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Samarra has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;). Most rain falls in the winter. The average annual temperature in Samarra is . About of precipitation falls annually.

== Religious significance ==
The city is also home to al-Askari Shrine, containing the mausolea of the Imams Ali al-Hadi and Hasan al-Askari, the tenth and eleventh Shiʿi Imams, respectively, as well as the place from where Muhammad al-Mahdi, known as the &quot;Hidden Imam&quot;, reportedly went into The Occultation in the belief of the Twelver or Shias. This has made it an important pilgrimage centre for the Imami Shias. In addition, Hakimah and Narjis, female relatives of the Prophet Muhammad and the Imams, held in high esteem by Muslims, are buried there, making this mosque one of the most significant sites of worship.

==Sports==

Samarra is home to the Samarra SC, that plays in the second highest division of the Iraqi football league system, namely Iraqi Premier Division League. Its ground is the Samarra Stadium.

== In popular culture ==
The metaphor of &quot;Having an appointment in Samarra&quot;, signifying death, is a literary reference to an ancient Babylonian myth recorded in the Babylonian Talmud and transcribed by W. Somerset Maugham, in which Death narrates a man&#x27;s futile attempt to escape him by fleeing from Baghdad to Samarra. The story &quot;The Appointment in Samarra&quot; subsequently formed the germ of a novel of the same name by John O&#x27;Hara. The original story was retold in verse by F. L. Lucas in his poem &quot;The Destined Hour&quot; in &quot;From Many Times and Lands&quot; (1953). 

In the 1968 film &quot;Targets&quot;, Byron Orlok, an aging horror film star played by Boris Karloff, tells Maugham&#x27;s version of the story to his younger colleagues.

<text>Lambdopsalis is an extinct multituberculate mammal from the Late Paleocene of China and Mongolia. It is placed within the suborder Cimolodonta and is a member of the superfamily Taeniolabidoidea. Fossil remains have been found in the Late Paleocene Nomogen and Khashat Formations in Nao-mugen and Bayn Ulan of China and Mongolia, dated to 59-55 million years ago from the Thanetian age. &quot;Lambdopsalis bulla&quot; is the type species of this genus. The genus and species were named by Chow and Tao Qi in 1978.

Hair and fur fossilize very infrequently, if at all. This genus of multituberculate mammals provides one of the earliest unequivocal examples of mammal fur (Lower Cretaceous fossils of &quot;Eomaia, Volaticotherium&quot; and &quot;Castorocauda&quot; with the fur preserved still attached are currently the oldest). Indirect evidence suggest that hair first appeared on non-mammalian therapsids (Therapsida), back in the Triassic or even earlier. This is inferred from small hollows on the bone of the snout similar to holes in the skulls of cats which provide space for concentrations of nerves and blood vessels that innervate prominent whiskers (specialized hairs). This adaptation allows cats to use their whiskers as effective tactile sensory organs.

In the same Upper Paleocene strata, exceptionally preserved coprolites, originally excreted by unknown carnivorous animals, were discovered to contain undigested remains, including hair from &quot;Lambdopsalis&quot; and three other different mammal taxa.

Studies on its tooth prism and enamel patterns have been performed. It had deciduous enamel, and there is evidence that adults and juveniles had substantially different diets. Cervical vertebrae C2-C3 or C2-C3-C4 appear to be typically fused in individuals of this genus.
Based on its robust humerus bones, its flat skull, its fused and stiff neck bones, and thick enamel on its lower incisors, it is believed that this genus was either partially or fully adapted to a burrowing (fossorial) lifestyle. Kielan-Jaworowska and Qi suggest similar locomotive behavior to the modern Golden mole. Fully grown &quot;L.bulla&quot; individuals were estimated to have had a body mass of and skull length of about .

<text>Ptilodus (meaning &quot;soft-haired&quot;) is a genus of mammals from the extinct order of Multituberculata, and lived during the Paleocene in North America.

&quot;Ptilodus&quot; was a relatively large multituberculate of in length, which is about the same size as a squirrel. Its feet, legs and long tail suggest it was a good climber, so it very possibly led a squirrel-like lifestyle. 

Like other ptilodontids, it had a very large and elongated last lower premolar which formed a serrated slicing blade. 

The genus was named by paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1881. Cope also mistakenly assigned some material belonging to this genus to &quot;Chirox&quot; in 1884. Elements from &quot;Ectypodus&quot; (Jepsen, 1940) and &quot;Neoplagiaulax&quot; have also been reassigned to this genus.

==Species==
There are seven species, and others have been proposed at one time or another. &quot;P. nellieae&quot; (Bell, 1941) is apparently mentioned in a manuscript, rather than a publication. &quot;P. sinclairi&quot; (Simpson, 1935) seems to have become &quot;Parectypodus sinclairi&quot;. In botany, &quot;Ptilodus pyramidatus&quot; is an extinct Australian plant.

=== &quot;P. fractus&quot; ===

The species &quot;Ptilodus fractus&quot; had a body weight of about . Remains have been found in Wyoming, in the United States, in Dell Creek deposits dated to the Tiffanian stage of the Paleocene.

The species was named by J. A. Door in 1952 (Scott &quot;et al.&quot;, 2002, Dorr, 1952), though it may have been amended to its current state by David Krause in 1987.

=== &quot;P. gnomus&quot; ===

&quot;Ptilodus gnomus&quot; is the smallest known member of the genus. Hence, the species epithet &#x27;gnomus&#x27;, which is Neo-Latin for &#x27;dwarf&#x27;. Remains have been discovered in Wyoming in the United States, and Alberta, Canada. They were recovered from the Cochrane 2 deposits of the Paskapoo Formation, which have been dated to the Tiffanian stage of the Paleocene.

Remains of this species include over 100 teeth, (upper and lower), and at least one fragment of jaw. The teeth range from in length. The fourth lower premolar (p4) is about 51% shorter than the corresponding tooth in &quot;P. mediaevus&quot;; 28% less than &quot;P. kummae&quot;; 15% less than &quot;P. tsosiensis&quot;; and 5% smaller than &quot;P. fractus&quot;, which gives some idea of the relative sizes of the various animals. There are also differences in shape and the number of serrations. (Scott &quot;et al.&quot;, 2002)

:Although more similar in size to homologous teeth referable to &quot;P. tsosiensis&quot; and &quot;P. fractus&quot;, the upper and lower ultimate premolars of this new species most closely resemble those of &quot;P. mediaevus&quot; in overall morphology. (Scott &quot;et al.&quot;, 2002)

A couple of isolated teeth which had been previously identified as perhaps belonging to &quot;Ectypodus&quot;, have been now been placed within this taxon. All referred specimens are held in the collection of the University of Alberta.

The species was named by C. R. Scott, R. C. Fox, and G. P. Youzwyshyn in 2002. Material assigned by Jepsen in 1940, as amended by Gazin in 1956, to &quot;Ectypodus hazeni&quot; has also been assigned to this species.

There are three species of this genus known from the Alberta location, two of which have yet to be described. This will be attended to by David W. Krause. (Scott &quot;et al.&quot;, 2002, pg. 691).

=== &quot;P. kummae&quot; ===
&quot;Ptilodus kummae&quot; has an estimated weight of . Remains have been discovered in Roche Percee, Saskatchewan in Canada, in deposits from the lower Tiffanian stage of the Paleocene.

The species was named by David W. Krause in 1977. (Krause, 1977) The holotype is at Alberta University.

=== &quot;P. mediaevus&quot; ===

Remains of &quot;Ptilodus mediaevus&quot; have been recovered in New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming in the United States. They have been unearthed from the deposits of the San Juan Basin, which are dated to the Torrejonian stage of the Paleocene.

Cope named the species in 1881 (Cope, 1881). The species &quot;Ptilodus feronensis&quot;, or &quot;Ptilodus ferronensis&quot;, was named C. L. Gazin in 1941 (Gazin, 1941), but all material was reassigned to &quot;P. mediaevus&quot; by Rigby in 1980. In 1929, Granger and Simpson did the same thing to the species &quot;P. plicatus&quot;, which was originally named by J. W. Gidley in 1909. &quot;Chirox plicatus&quot; was named by Cope in 1884. He described it as a marsupial in 1884, but it is also part of this species.

=== &quot;P. montanus&quot; ===
&quot;Ptilodus montanus&quot; is a large species, about . A brain cast indicates a well-developed sense of smell. Remains were recovered in Montana, in the rock of the Silberling Quarry, which is dated to the lower Tiffanian stage of the Paleocene.

The species was named by E. Douglass in 1908 (Douglass, 1908). The species &quot;P. admiralis&quot;, first described by Hay in 1930; and &quot;P. gracillis&quot;, first described by J. W. Gidley in 1909 (Gidley, 1909) are now considered part of this species.

=== &quot;P. tsosiensis&quot; ===

&quot;Ptilodus tsosiensis&quot; has been discovered in New Mexico, the Puercan stage deposits of the Lower Paleocene San Juan Basin. The species was named by R. E. Sloan in 1981 (Sloan, 1981).

=== &quot;P. wyomingensis&quot; ===

Remains of &quot;Ptilodus wyomingensis&quot; have been found in the Middle Paleocene deposits of the Rock Bench Quarry, in Wyoming and North Dakota in the United States. The species was named by G. L. Jepsen in 1940 (Jepsen, 1940).

<doc id="201340" wikidata="Q12901024" url="?curid=201340" title="Meniscoessus">
<text>Meniscoessus is a genus of extinct multituberculates from the Upper Cretaceous Period that lived in North America.
It is a member of the order Multituberculata, belonging to the suborder Cimolodonta and family Cimolomyidae. The multituberculates were primitive, rodent-like mammals occupying the modern rodent ecological niche. They were significant for having diverged early in mammalian evolution, co-existing with dinosaurs for ~100 million years, surviving through the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event and lasting until the end of the Paleogene,
likely having been replaced by true rodents.

&quot;Meniscoessus&quot; lived during the Santonian, Campanian and Maastrichtian ages of the Upper Cretaceous. This was a period of significant diversification of multiturbiculates, and evidence that contradicts the popular misconception that mammals were unable to thrive due to being outcompeted by the dinosaurs. 
They are useful as index fossils for the Judithian, Edmontonian, and Lancian faunal stages.
Like most early mammals, &quot;Meniscoessus&quot; fossils mainly consist of teeth. Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska and Jørn Hurum considered them to be the &quot;best known&quot; members of the Cimolomyidae.

==Taxonomy==

===History===
The genus &quot;Meniscoessus&quot; was named by Edward Drinker Cope in 1882. Members of this genus have been previously classified under the following genus names: &quot;Cimolomys &quot; (partly); &quot;Dipriodon&quot; ; &quot;Halodon&quot;; &quot;Oracodon&quot;; &quot;Moeniscoessus&quot;; &quot;Selenacodon&quot; (partly); and &quot;Tripriodon&quot;. As Osborn pointed out in 1891, a number of erroneous discoveries had been made as a result of analyzing different teeth of the same animal, different individuals of the same species, and violating the principle of priority due to workers ignoring previously published discoveries.
There may have been confusion with some teeth described as belonging to small carnivorous dinosaurs. These were further christened &quot;Dipriodon&quot;, &quot;Tripriodon,&quot; and others, including &quot;Triprotodon&quot;. Close similarities were then noticed with an already established dinosaur genus, &quot;Paronychodon&quot; (Cope 1876), also based on teeth from the Laramie Formation. 
Over time, an impressive school of names was synonymized under &quot;P.&quot; However, this is now considered a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;.

=== Species ===

* &quot;Meniscoessus collomensis&quot; – Named by Jason A. Lillegraven in 1987. Fossil remains were first found in Upper Cretaceous strata of the Williams Fork Formation in Colorado. It appears useful as an index fossil for the Edmontonian faunal stage. It weighed an estimated .
* &quot;Meniscoessus conquistus&quot; – Named by Edward Drinker Cope in 1882. Remains were found in Maastrichtian strata of Colorado and St. Mary River Formation of Canada. Cope thought it &quot;was about the size of the Australian bandicoot.&quot; &quot;M.conquistus&quot; is the type species of the genus &quot;Meniscoessus&quot;.
* &quot;Meniscoessus ferox&quot; – Named by Richard C. Fox in 1971. Remains were found in Campanian strata of the Upper Milk River Formation of Alberta, Canada. The holotype, collected in 1968, is in the University of Alberta collection.
* &quot;Meniscoessus intermedius&quot; – Named by Richard C. Fox in 1976. Remains were first found in Campanian and Maastrichtian strata of the Oldman Formation of Alberta and New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. It is estimated to have weighed about , as much as a large rat. They are the oldest member of the genus; their first appearance in the fossil record was 86 Million Years ago, during the Santonian age.
* &quot;Meniscoessus major&quot; – Named by Loris Shano Russell in the 1930s. It is also known as &quot;Cimolomys major&quot; (Russell 1936). Fossils of this species have been found in Campanian and Maastrichtian aged strata, from 79-69 Million years ago. The body mass of this species is estimated at . The holotype is in Alberta.

* &quot;Meniscoessus robustus&quot; – Named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1889. Fossils have been found from Campanian to Maastrichtian strata of Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota and Alberta. There are controversial examples from one site in Alberta that may either be late Cretaceous(Lancian faunal stage) or early Paleocene(Puercan). Marsh thought that these organisms ranged from &quot;rat&quot; to &quot;squirrel&quot; to &quot;rabbit&quot; in size when they had lived. The weight of this species is estimated to have been about . Marsh claimed discoveries of several new taxa in his 1889 work, but Osborn believed that many were synonymous with what is now &quot;M. robustus&quot;.
* &quot;Meniscoessus seminoensis&quot; – Named by Jaelyn J. Eberle and Jason A. Lillegraven in 1998. Remains were found in the Lancian faunal stage of the Maastrichtian strata of the Ferris Formation in Wyoming. A lower jaw fragment was found near the Seminoe Mountains, for which the species was named. It has a close resemblance to &quot;M. robustus&quot;, with the new species distinguished by its characteristic 4th premolar 
 (P4). It was estimated to have a body mass of 
Several other names have been in circulation, such as &quot;Meniscoessus bustus&quot;, and &quot;Meniscoessus coelatus&quot;. The first is probably a variant of &quot;M. robustus&quot;, while the latter seems to have been connected with dinosaur teeth.

<text>Ungermann-Bass, Inc., also known as UB and UB Networks, was a computer networking company in the 1980s to 1990s. Located in Santa Clara, California, UB was the first large networking company independent of any computer manufacturer. Along with competitors 3Com and Sytek, UB was responsible for starting the networking business in Silicon Valley in 1979. UB was founded by Ralph Ungermann and Charlie Bass. John Davidson, vice president of engineering, was one of the creators of NCP, the transport protocol of the ARPANET before TCP.

UB specialized in large enterprise networks connecting computer systems and devices from multiple vendors, which was unusual in the 1980s. At that time most network equipment came from computer manufacturers and usually used only protocols compatible with that one manufacturer&#x27;s computer systems, such as IBM&#x27;s SNA or DEC&#x27;s DECnet. Many UB products initially used the XNS protocol suite, including the flagship Net/One, and later transitioned to TCP/IP as it became an industry standard in the late 1980s.

Before it became the industry standard, the Internet protocol suite TCP/IP was initially a &quot;check box&quot; item needed to qualify on prospective enterprise sales. As a network technology supplier to both Apple Inc. and Microsoft, in 1987-88 UB helped Apple implement their initial MacTCP offering and also helped Microsoft with a Winsock compatible software/hardware bundle for the Microsoft Windows platform. With the success of these offerings and of the Internet protocol TCP/IP, both Apple and Microsoft subsequently brought the Internet technology in-house and integrated it into their core products.

UB marketed a broadband (in the original technical sense) version of Ethernet known as 10BROAD36 in the mid 1980s. It was generally seen as hard to install. UB was one of the first network manufacturers to sell equipment that implemented Ethernet over twisted pair wiring. UB&#x27;s AccessOne product line initially used the pre-standard StarLAN and, when it became standard, 10BASE-T.

UB went public in 1983. It was bought by Tandem Computers in 1988. UB was sold in 1997 by Tandem to Newbridge Networks. Over the next several months, Newbridge laid off the bulk of the Ungermann-Bass employees, and closed the doors of the Santa Clara operation. Newbridge was later acquired by Alcatel, a French telecommunications company.

<doc id="201350" wikidata="Q1049141" url="?curid=201350" title="Vernal Equinox Day">
<text>is a public holiday in Japan that occurs on the date of the Northward equinox in Japan Standard Time (the vernal equinox can occur on different dates in different time-zones), usually March 20 or 21. The date of the holiday is not officially declared until February of the previous year, due to the need for recent astronomical measurements.

Vernal Equinox Day became a public holiday in 1948. Prior to that it was the date of , an event relating to Shinto. Like other Japanese holidays, this holiday was repackaged as a non-religious holiday for the sake of separation of religion and state in Japan&#x27;s postwar constitution.
Pre-1945 State Shinto or Kokka Shinto is defined as the Shinto activities surrounding the support of government ideals that the government would have control over. These include day to day worship at public shrines and their messages, traditional ceremony (Kokutai Cult) and rites performed among the Imperial households, and shrines specifically symbolizing the death of fallen soldiers in battle.
On December 15, 1945, General Douglas MacArthur introduced what would later be called the Shinto Directive. The order was a directive titled the “Abolition of Governmental Sponsorship, Perpetuation, Control, and Dissemination of State Shinto″. This however was difficult due to the Emperor being at the center of many Shinto rituals. The purpose of the mandate was to separate State Shinto and Shrine Shinto which would be separating all government ties to the control of religious activities while supporting public shrines available to everyone and would be supported privately. This would later on be a part of the new Japanese constitution ratified in 1948.

==Celebrations==
Shunbun no Hi is the holiday celebrating the spring (vernal) equinox. It is part of a seven-day period of festival called Haru no Higan. It is one of two points during the year, the other being in the autumn, where the daylight and night hours are of equal length, and is the official change of the seasons. 
Due to the nature of the holiday revolving around astronomical changes the date of the holiday can change from year to year but it will usually fall anywhere between March 19–22. Back in ancient times, the holiday was originally called Higan no Nakaba, which translates to “Middle of the Equinoctial Week.” The holiday was originally a time to visit loved ones&#x27; grave sites and pay homage to the ancestors. The Japanese would also take the time to renew their lives by cleaning their homes and making life changes such as starting or finishing school or a new hobby. 
Today Shunbun no Hi is a national holiday and the majority of Japanese will have the day off work to celebrate with their families. Many people will return to their homes they originally come from to spend the day with their families. The day is celebrated to bring in the spring season and to appreciate the nature blooming after a long winter. Some people will still visit their loved ones&#x27; grave sites, sweep the gravestone clear of debris, and often leave offerings of food or fresh cut flowers.It is common for followers to eat a sweet confection known as botamochi (ぼたもち) that is often used as an offering at shrines, temples, and graves all across Japan during Higan. Botamochi is made using sticky rice and bean paste that is made into a chewy, ball-shaped treat.The holiday is also special to farmers and agriculturalists as a day to pray for good luck and fortune for the crops they may grow in the upcoming season.

<doc id="201352" wikidata="Q2688629" url="?curid=201352" title="Wanksta">
<text>&quot;Wanksta&quot; is a song by American rapper 50 Cent, released on November 5, 2002, as the third single from the soundtrack to the film &quot;8 Mile&quot; (2002). The single, produced by Sha Money XL and John &quot;J-Praize&quot; Freeman, reached number 13 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song originally appeared on 50 Cent&#x27;s mixtape &quot;No Mercy, No Fear&quot;, released in August 2002.

==Background==
&quot;Wanksta&quot; was 50 Cent&#x27;s first single to chart after signing to Eminem&#x27;s and Dr. Dre&#x27;s labels, Shady Records and Aftermath Entertainment, as well as his first single to be released since &quot;Thug Love&quot; in 1999. Originally appearing on his 2002 mixtape, &quot;No Mercy, No Fear&quot;, it received a lot of airplay, and was eventually added to the &quot;8 Mile soundtrack&quot; later the same year. It was then added as a bonus track on his 2003 debut album, &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot;.

Eminem also made a remix, in 2003, aimed at Ja Rule and tweaked the beat to sound high pitched. The song appeared on the CD single box set &quot;The Singles&quot;.

The instrumental for the song was used for &quot;Crackin&quot;, a song by The Psychopathic Rydas, in 2004. It was also used by Murder Inc. artist Black Child in his 50 Cent diss track &quot;You Da Wanksta&quot; in 2002.

R&amp;B girl group Blaque recorded an answer song entitled &quot;No Ganksta&quot; in 2003.

50 cent opens the song with the lyrics &quot;I got a lot of livin&#x27; to do before I die and I ain&#x27;t got no time to waste...let&#x27;s make it&quot; which he took from the intro to Nina Simone&#x27;s 1968 recording of &quot;Do What You Gotta Do.&quot;

==Etymology==
The title is generally accepted as a portmanteau word meaning &quot;self-obsessed, show-off person&quot;. The precise origin is debated, although most theories suggest a blend of &quot;gangsta&quot; and &quot;wannabe&quot;. The term had previously been used in the 1999 track Q.B.G. from The Tunnel, a collaborative album by American DJs Funkmaster Flex and Big Kap.
50 Cent has explicitly stated that the word is not related to &quot;wanker&quot;:
Jake Arnott: And another claim to fame: you introduced the word &#x27;wanksta&#x27; into the language with your track &#x27;Wanksta&#x27;. That word sort of means something in England — does it mean the same in America?

50 Cent: Nah, nah! &#x27;Wanksta&#x27;s like... we use that terminology to mean a fake gangster. When people told me about the word &#x27;wanker&#x27;...
50 Cent may however have simply been unaware of the origin of this established slang term.

The song&#x27;s lyrics were believed to be directed towards long time nemesis Ja Rule, but 50 Cent disputed this himself in a MuchMusic interview, stating that while the song itself was not directed at Ja, he was a good example of a wanksta.

<text>Tandem Computers, Inc. was the dominant manufacturer of fault-tolerant computer systems for ATM networks, banks, stock exchanges, telephone switching centers, 911 systems, and other similar commercial transaction processing applications requiring maximum uptime and no data loss. The company was founded by Jimmy Treybig in 1974 in Cupertino, California. It remained independent until 1997, when it became a server division within Compaq. It is now a server division within Hewlett Packard Enterprise, following Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s acquisition of Compaq and the split of Hewlett-Packard into HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

Tandem&#x27;s NonStop systems use a number of independent identical processors, redundant storage devices, and redundant controllers to provide automatic high-speed &quot;failover&quot; in the case of a hardware or software failure. To contain the scope of failures and of corrupted data, these multi-computer systems have no shared central components, not even main memory. Conventional multi-computer systems all use shared memories and work directly on shared data objects. Instead, NonStop processors cooperate by exchanging messages across a reliable fabric, and software takes periodic snapshots for possible rollback of program memory state.

Besides masking failures, this &quot;shared-nothing&quot; messaging system design also scales to the largest commercial workloads. Each doubling of the total number of processors doubles system throughput, up to the maximum configuration of 4000 processors. In contrast, the performance of conventional multiprocessor systems is limited by the speed of some shared memory, bus, or switch. Adding more than 4–8 processors in that manner gives no further system speedup. NonStop systems have more often been bought to meet scaling requirements than for extreme fault tolerance. They compete against IBM&#x27;s largest mainframes, despite being built from simpler minicomputer technology.

== Founding ==
Tandem Computers was founded in 1974 by James Treybig. Treybig first saw the market need for fault tolerance in OLTP (online transaction processing) systems while running a marketing team for Hewlett-Packard &#x27;s HP 3000 computer division, but HP was not interested in developing for this niche. He then joined the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins and developed the Tandem business plan there. Treybig pulled together a core engineering team hired away from the HP 3000 division: Mike Green, Jim Katzman, Dave Mackie and Jack Loustaunou. Their business plan called for ultra-reliable systems that never had outages and never lost or corrupted data. These were modular in a new way that was safe from all &quot;single-point failures&quot; yet would be only marginally more expensive than conventional non-fault-tolerant systems. They would be less expensive and support more throughput than some existing ad-hoc toughened systems that used redundant but usually required &quot;hot spares&quot;.

Each engineer was confident they could quickly pull off their own part of this complex new design but doubted that others&#x27; areas could be worked out. The parts of the hardware and software design that did not have to be different were largely based on incremental improvements to the familiar hardware and software designs of the HP 3000. Many subsequent engineers and programmers also came from HP. Tandem headquarters in Cupertino, California, were a quarter mile away from the HP offices. Initial venture capital investment in Tandem Computers came from Tom Perkins, who was formerly a general manager of the HP 3000 division.

The business plan included detailed ideas for building a unique corporate culture reflecting Treybig&#x27;s values.

The design of the initial &quot;Tandem/16&quot; hardware was completed in 1975, and the first system shipped to Citibank in May 1976.

The company enjoyed uninterrupted exponential growth through 1983. &quot;Inc.&quot; magazine ranked Tandem as the fastest-growing public company in America. By 1996, Tandem was a $2.3 billion company employing approximately 8,000 people worldwide.

== Tandem NonStop (TNS) stack machines ==
Over 40 years, Tandem&#x27;s main NonStop product line grew and evolved in an upward-compatible way from the initial T/16 fault-tolerant system, with three major changes to its top-level modular architecture or its programming-level instruction set architecture. Within each series, there have been several major re-implementations as chip technology progressed.

While conventional systems of the era, including large mainframes, had mean-time-between-failures (MTBF) on the order of a few days, the NonStop system was designed to failure intervals 100 times longer, with uptimes measured in years. Nevertheless, the NonStop was designed to be price-competitive with conventional systems, with a simple 2-CPU system priced at just over twice that of a competing single-processor mainframe, as opposed to four or more times of other fault-tolerant solutions.

=== NonStop I ===
The first system was the Tandem/16 or T/16, later re-branded NonStop I. The machine consisted of between two and 16 CPUs, organized as a fault-tolerant computer cluster packaged in a single rack. Each CPU had its own private, unshared memory, its own I/O processor, its own private I/O bus to connect to I/O controllers, and dual connections to all the other CPUs over a custom inter-CPU backplane bus called Dynabus. Each disk controller or network controller was duplicated and had dual connections to both CPUs and devices. Each disk was mirrored, with separate connections to two independent disk controllers. If a disk failed, its data was still available from its mirrored copy. If a CPU, controller or bus failed, the disk was still reachable through alternative CPU, controller, and/or bus. Each disk or network controller was connected to two independent CPUs. Power supplies were each wired to only one side of a pair of CPUs, controllers, or buses, so that the system would keep running without loss of connections if one power supply failed. The careful complex arrangement of parts and connections in customers&#x27; larger configurations were documented in a Mackie diagram, named after lead salesman David Mackie, who invented the notation. None of these duplicated parts were wasted &quot;hot spares&quot;; everything added to system throughput during normal operations.

Besides recovering well from failed parts, the T/16 was also designed to detect as many kinds of intermittent failures as possible, as soon as possible. This prompt detection is called &quot;fail fast&quot;. The point was to find and isolate corrupted data before it was permanently written into databases and other disk files. In the T/16, error detection was by added custom circuits that added little cost to the total design; no major parts were duplicated to get error detection.

The T/16 CPU was a proprietary design. It was greatly influenced by the HP 3000 minicomputer. They were both microprogrammed, 16-bit, stack-based machines with segmented, 16-bit virtual addressing. Both were intended to be programmed exclusively in high-level languages, with no use of assembler. Both were initially implemented via standard low-density TTL chips, each holding a 4-bit slice of the 16-bit ALU. Both had a small number of top-of-stack, 16-bit data registers plus some extra address registers for accessing the memory stack. Both used Huffman encoding of operand address offsets, to fit a large variety of address modes and offset sizes into the 16-bit instruction format with good code density. Both relied heavily on pools of indirect addresses to overcome the short instruction format. Both supported larger 32- and 64-bit operands via multiple ALU cycles, and memory-to-memory string operations. Both used &quot;big-endian&quot; addressing of long versus short memory operands. These features had all been inspired by Burroughs B5500–B6800 mainframe stack machines.

The T/16 instruction set changed several features from the HP 3000 design. The T/16 supported paged virtual memory from the beginning. The HP 3000 series did not add paging until the PA-RISC generation, 10 years later (although via MPE V it had a form of paging using the APL firmware, in 1978). Tandem added support for 32-bit addressing in its second machine; HP 3000 lacked this until its PA-RISC generation. Paging and long addresses were critical for supporting complex system software and large applications. The T/16 treated its top-of-stack registers in a novel way; the compiler, not the microcode, was responsible for deciding when full registers were spilled to the memory stack and when empty registers were re-filled from the memory stack. On the HP 3000, this decision took extra microcode cycles in every instruction. The HP 3000 supported COBOL with several instructions for calculating directly on arbitrary-length BCD (binary-coded decimal) strings of digits. The T/16 simplified this to single instructions for converting between BCD strings and 64-bit binary integers.

In the T/16, each CPU consisted of two boards of TTL logic and SRAMs, and ran at about 0.7 MIPS. At any instant, it could access only four virtual memory segments (System Data, System Code, User Data, User Code), each limited to 128 KB in size. The 16-bit address spaces were already small for major applications when it shipped.

The first release of T/16 had only a single programming language, Transaction Application Language (TAL). This was an efficient machine-dependent systems programming language (for operating systems, compilers, etc.) but could also be used for non-portable applications. It was derived from HP 3000&#x27;s System Programming Language (SPL). Both had semantics similar to C but a syntax based on Burroughs&#x27; ALGOL. Subsequent releases added support for Cobol74, Basic, Fortran, Java, C, C++, and MUMPS.

The Tandem NonStop series ran a custom operating system which was significantly different from Unix or HP 3000&#x27;s MPE. It was initially called T/TOS (Tandem Transactional Operating System) but soon named Guardian for its ability to protect all data from machine faults and software faults. In contrast to all other commercial operating systems, Guardian was based on message passing as the basic way for all processes to interact, without shared memory, regardless of where the processes were running. This approach easily scaled to multiple-computer clusters and helped isolate corrupted data before it propagated.

All file system processes and all transactional application processes were structured as master/slave pairs of processes running in separate CPUs. The slave process periodically took snapshots of the master&#x27;s memory state and took over the workload if and when the master process ran into trouble. This allowed the application to survive failures in any CPU or its associated devices, without data loss. It further allowed recovery from some intermittent-style software failures. Between failures, the monitoring by the slave process added some performance overhead but this was far less than the 100% duplication in other system designs. Some major early applications were directly coded in this checkpoint style, but most instead used various Tandem software layers which hid the details of this in a semi-portable way.

=== NonStop II ===
In 1981, all T/16 CPUs were replaced by the NonStop II. Its main difference from the T/16 was support for occasional 32-bit addressing via a user-switchable &quot;extended data segment&quot;. This supported the next ten years of growth in software and was an advantage over the T/16 or HP 3000. Visible registers remained 16-bit, and this unplanned addition to the instruction set required executing many instructions per memory reference compared to most 32-bit minicomputers. All subsequent TNS computers were hampered by this instruction set inefficiency. As the NonStop II lacked wider internal data paths, it had to use additional microcode steps for 32-bit addresses. A NonStop II CPU had three boards, using chips and design similar to the T/16. The NonStop II also replaced core memory with battery-backed DRAM memory.

=== NonStop TXP ===
In 1983, the NonStop TXP CPU was the first entirely new implementation of the TNS instruction set architecture. It was built from standard TTL chips and Programmed Array Logic chips, with four boards per CPU module. It had Tandem&#x27;s first use of cache memory. It had a more direct implementation of 32-bit addressing, but still sent them through 16-bit adders. A wider microcode store allowed a major reduction in the cycles executed per instruction; speed increased to 2.0 MIPS. It used the same rack packaging, controllers, backplane, and buses as before. The Dynabus and I/O buses had been overdesigned in the T/16 so they would work for several generations of upgrades.

=== FOX ===
Up to 14 TXP and NonStop II systems could now be combined via FOX, a long-distance fault-tolerant fibre optic bus for connecting TNS clusters across a business campus; a cluster of clusters with a total of 224 CPUs. This allowed further scale-up for taking on the largest mainframe applications. Like the CPU modules within the computers, the Guardian operating system could failover entire task sets to other machines in the network. Worldwide clusters of 4000 CPUs could also be built via conventional long-haul network links.

=== NonStop VLX ===
In 1986, Tandem introduced a third generation CPU, the NonStop VLX. It had 32-bit data paths, wider microcode, 12 MHz cycle time, and a peak rate of one instruction per cycle. It was built from three boards of ECL gate array chips (with TTL pinout). It had a revised Dynabus with speed raised to 20 MB/s per link, 40 MB/s total. Later, FOX II increased the physical diameter of TNS clusters to 4 kilometers.

Tandem&#x27;s initial database support was only for hierarchical, non-relational databases via the ENSCRIBE file system. This was extended into a relational database called ENCOMPASS. In 1986 Tandem introduced the first fault-tolerant SQL database, NonStop SQL. Developed totally in-house, NonStop SQL includes a number of features based on Guardian to ensure data validity across nodes. NonStop SQL is known for scaling linearly in performance with the number of nodes added to the system, whereas most databases had performance that plateaued quite quickly, often after just two CPUs. A later version released in 1989 added transactions that could be spread over nodes, a feature that remained unique for some time. NonStop SQL continued to evolve, first as NonStop SQL/MP and then NonStop SQL/MX, which transitioned from Tandem to Compaq to HP. The code remains in use in both HP&#x27;s NonStop SQL/MP, NonStop SQL/MX and the Apache Trafodion project.

=== NonStop CLX ===
In 1987, Tandem introduced the NonStop CLX, a low-cost less-expandable minicomputer system. Its role was for growing the low end of the fault-tolerant market, and for deploying on the remote edges of large Tandem networks. Its initial performance was roughly similar to the TXP; later versions improved to where they were about 20% slower than a VLX. Its small cabinet could be installed into any &quot;copier room&quot; office environment. A CLX CPU was one board, containing six &quot;compiled silicon&quot; ASIC CMOS chips. The CPU core chip was duplicated and lock stepped for maximal error detection. This added no additional fault tolerance but assured data integrity as each CPU included checking logic that made certain that the results of both CPU chips were identical. Other processors would provide fault tolerance. Pinout was a main limitation of this chip technology. Microcode, cache, and TLB were all external to the CPU core and shared a single bus and single bank of SRAM. As a result, CLX required at least two machine cycles per instruction.

=== NonStop Cyclone ===
In 1989, Tandem introduced the NonStop Cyclone, a fast but expensive system for the mainframe end of the market. Each self-checking CPU took three boards full of hot-running ECL gate array chips, plus memory boards. Despite being microprogrammed, the CPU was superscalar, often completing two instructions per cache cycle. This was accomplished by having a separate microcode routine for every common pair of instructions. That fused pair of stack instructions generally accomplished the same work as a single instruction of normal 32-bit minicomputers. Cyclone processors were packaged as sections of four CPUs each, and the sections joined by a fiber optic version of Dynabus.

Like Tandem&#x27;s prior high-end machines, Cyclone cabinets were styled with much angular black to suggest strength and power. Advertising videos directly compared Cyclone to the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird Mach 3 spy plane. Cyclone&#x27;s name was supposed to represent its &quot;unstoppable speed in roaring through OLTP workloads&quot;. Announcement day was October 17, 1989. That afternoon, the region was struck by the magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake, causing freeway collapses in Oakland and major fires in San Francisco. Tandem offices were shaken, but no one was badly hurt on site.

== Other product lines ==
=== Rainbow ===
In 1980–1983, Tandem attempted to re-design its entire hardware and software stack to put its NonStop methods on a stronger foundation than its inherited HP 3000 traits. Rainbow&#x27;s hardware was a 32-bit register-file machine that aimed to be better than a Digital Equipment Corporation VAX. For reliable programming, the main programming language was &quot;TPL&quot;, a subset of Ada. At that time, programmers barely understood how to compile Ada to unoptimized code. There was no migration path for existing NonStop system software coded in TAL. The OS, database and Cobol compilers were entirely redesigned. Customers would see it as a totally disjoint product line requiring all-new software from them. The software side of this project took much longer than planned. The hardware was already obsolete and outperformed by TXP before its software was ready, resulting in the Rainbow project being abandoned. All subsequent efforts emphasized upward compatibility and easy migration paths.

Development of Rainbow&#x27;s advanced client/server application development framework called &quot;Crystal&quot; continued awhile longer and was spun off as the &quot;Ellipse&quot; product of Cooperative Systems Incorporated.

=== Dynamite PC ===
In 1985, Tandem attempted to grab a piece of the rapidly growing personal computer market with its introduction of the MS-DOS based Dynamite PC/workstation. Numerous design compromises (including a unique 8086-based hardware platform incompatible with expansion cards of the day and extremely limited compatibility with IBM-based PCs) relegated the Dynamite to serving primarily as a smart terminal. It was quietly and quickly withdrawn from the market.

=== Integrity ===
Tandem&#x27;s message-based NonStop operating system had advantages for scaling, extreme reliability, and efficiently using expensive &quot;spare&quot; resources. But many potential customers wanted just good-enough reliability in a small system, using a familiar Unix operating system and industry-standard programs. Tandem&#x27;s various fault-tolerant competitors all adopted a simpler hardware-only memory-centric design where all recovery was done by switching between hot spares. The most successful competitor was Stratus Technologies, whose machines were re-marketed by IBM as &quot;IBM System/88&quot;.

In such systems, the spare processors do not contribute to system throughput between failures, but merely redundantly execute exactly the same data thread as the active processor at the same instant, in &quot;lock step&quot;. Faults are detected by seeing when the cloned processors&#x27; outputs diverged. To detect failures, the system must have two physical processors for each logical, active processor. To also implement automatic failover recovery, the system must have three or four physical processors for each logical processor. The triple or quadruple cost of this sparing is practical when the duplicated parts are commodity single-chip microprocessors.

Tandem&#x27;s products for this market began with the Integrity line in 1989, using MIPS processors and a &quot;NonStop UX&quot; variant of Unix. It was developed in Austin, Texas. In 1991, the Integrity S2 used TMR, Triple Modular Redundancy, where each logical CPU used three MIPS R2000 microprocessors to execute the same data thread, with voting to find and lock out a failed part. Their fast clocks could not be synchronized as in strict lock stepping, so voting instead happened at each interrupt. Some other versions of Integrity used 4x &quot;pair and spares&quot; redundancy. Pairs of processors ran in lock-step to check each other. When they disagreed, both processors were marked untrusted, and their workload was taken over by a hot-spare pair of processors whose state was already current. In 1995, the Integrity S4000 was the first to use ServerNet (a networked &quot;bus&quot; structure) and moved toward sharing peripherals with the NonStop line.

=== Wolfpack ===
In 1995–1997, Tandem partnered with Microsoft to implement high-availability features and advanced SQL configurations in clusters of commodity Microsoft Windows NT machines. This project was codenamed &quot;Wolfpack&quot; and first shipped as Microsoft Cluster Server in 1997. Microsoft benefited greatly from this partnership; Tandem did not.

== TNS/R NonStop migration to MIPS ==
When Tandem was formed in 1974, every computer company designed and built its CPUs from basic circuits, using its own proprietary instruction set, compilers, etc. With each year of semiconductor progress with Moore&#x27;s Law, more of a CPU&#x27;s core circuits could fit into single chips and run faster and cheaper as a result. However, it became increasingly expensive for a computer company to design those advanced custom chips or build the plants to fabricate the chips. Facing the challenges of this changing marketplace and manufacturing landscape, Tandem partnered with MIPS and adopted its R3000 and successor chipsets and their advanced optimizing compiler. Subsequent NonStop Guardian machines using the MIPS architecture were known to programmers as TNS/R machines and had a variety of marketing names.

=== Cyclone/R ===
In 1991, Tandem released the Cyclone/R, also known as CLX/R. This was a low-cost mid-range system based on CLX components but used R3000 microprocessors instead of the much slower CLX stack machine board. To minimize time to market, this machine was initially shipped without any MIPS native-mode software. Everything, including its NonStop Kernel (NSK) operating system (a follow-on to Guardian) and NonStop SQL database, was compiled to TNS stack machine code. That object code was then translated to equivalent partially optimized MIPS instruction sequences at kernel install time by a tool called the Accelerator. Less-important programs could also be executed directly without pre-translation, via a TNS code interpreter. These migration techniques were successful and remain in use today. End-user software was brought over without extra work, the performance was good enough for mid-range machines, and programmers could ignore the instruction differences, even when debugging at machine code level. These Cyclone/R machines were updated with a faster native-mode NSK operating system in a follow-up release.

The R3000 and later microprocessors had only a typical amount of internal error checking, insufficient for Tandem&#x27;s needs. So, the Cyclone/R ran pairs of R3000 processors in lock step, running the same data thread. This was for purposes of data integrity, and not fault-tolerance – fault tolerance was handled by the other mechanisms still in place. It used a variation of lock stepping. The checker processor ran 1 cycle behind the primary processor. This allowed them to share a single copy of external code and data caches without putting excessive pinout load on the system bus and lowering the system clock rate. To successfully run microprocessors in lock step, the chips must be designed to be fully deterministic. Any hidden internal state must be cleared by the chip&#x27;s reset mechanism. Otherwise, the matched chips can go out of sync for no visible reason and without any faults, long after the chips are restarted. Chip designers agree that these are good principles because it helps them test chips at manufacturing time. But all new microprocessor chips seemed to have bugs in this area and required months of shared work between MIPS (the third-party manufacturer used by Tandem) and Tandem to eliminate or work around the final subtle bugs.

=== NonStop Himalaya K-series ===
In 1993, Tandem released the NonStop Himalaya K-series with the faster MIPS R4400, a native mode NSK operating system, and fully expandable Cyclone system components. These were connected by Dynabus, Dynabus+, and the original I/O bus, which by now were all running out of performance headroom.

=== Open System Services ===
In 1995, the NonStop Kernel was extended with a Unix-like POSIX environment called Open System Services. The original Guardian shell and ABI remained available.

=== NonStop Himalaya S-Series ===
In 1997, Tandem introduced the NonStop Himalaya S-Series with a new top-level system architecture based on ServerNet connections. ServerNet replaced the Dynabus, FOX, and I/O buses. It was much faster, more general, and could be extended to more than just two-way redundancy via an arbitrary fabric of point-to-point connections. Tandem designed ServerNet for its own needs but then promoted its use by others; it evolved into the InfiniBand industry standard.

All S-Series machines used MIPS processors, including the R4400, R10000, R12000, and R14000.

The design of the later, faster MIPS cores was primarily funded by Silicon Graphics Inc. But Intel&#x27;s sixth generation Pentium Pro overtook the performance of RISC designs, and also SGI&#x27;s graphics business shrank. After the R10000, there was no investment in significant new MIPS core designs for high-end servers. So Tandem needed to move its NonStop product line to another microprocessor architecture with competitive fast chips.

== Acquisition by Compaq, attempted migration to Alpha ==

Jimmy Treybig remained CEO of the company he founded until a downturn in 1996. The next CEO was Roel Pieper, who joined the company in 1996 as president and CEO. Re-branding to promote itself as a true Wintel (Windows/Intel) platform was conducted by their in-house brand and creative team led by Ronald May, who later went on to co-found the Silicon Valley Brand Forum in 1999. The concept worked, and shortly thereafter the company was acquired by Compaq.

Compaq&#x27;s x86-based server division was an early outside adopter of Tandem&#x27;s ServerNet/InfiniBand interconnect technology. In 1997, Compaq acquired the Tandem Computers company and NonStop customer base to balance Compaq&#x27;s heavy focus on personal computers (PCs). In 1998, Compaq also acquired the much larger Digital Equipment Corporation and inherited its DEC Alpha RISC servers with OpenVMS and Tru64 Unix customer bases. Tandem was then midway in porting its NonStop product line from MIPS R12000 microprocessors to Intel&#x27;s new Itanium Merced microprocessors. This project was restarted with Alpha as the new target to align NonStop with Compaq&#x27;s other large server lines. But in 2001, Compaq terminated all Alpha engineering investments in favor of the Itanium microprocessors, before any new NonStop products were released on Alpha.

== Acquisition by Hewlett-Packard, TNS/E migration to Itanium ==
In 2001, Hewlett-Packard similarly made the choice to abdicate its successful PA-RISC product lines in favor of Intel&#x27;s Itanium microprocessors that HP helped to design. Shortly thereafter, Compaq and HP announced their plan to merge and consolidate their similar product lines. This contentious merger became official in May 2002. The consolidations were painful and destroyed the DEC and &quot;HP Way&quot; engineer-oriented cultures, but the combined company did know how to sell complex systems to enterprises and profit, so it was an improvement for the surviving NonStop division and its customers.

In some ways, Tandem&#x27;s journey from HP-inspired start-up to an HP-inspired competitor, then to an HP division was &quot;bringing Tandem back to its original roots&quot;, but this was not the same HP.

The porting of the NSK-based NonStop product line from MIPS processors to Itanium-based processors was completed and was branded as &quot;HP Integrity NonStop Servers&quot;. (This NSK Integrity NonStop was unrelated to Tandem&#x27;s original &quot;Integrity&quot; series for Unix.)

Because it was not possible to run Itanium McKinley chips with clock-level lock stepping, the Integrity NonStop machines instead lock stepped using comparisons between chip states at longer time scales, at interrupt points and at various software synchronization points in between interrupts. The intermediate synchronization points were automatically triggered at every n&#x27;th taken branch instruction and were also explicitly inserted into long loop bodies by all NonStop compilers. The machine design supported both dual and triple redundancy, with either two or three physical microprocessors per logical Itanium processor. The triple version was sold to customers needing the utmost reliability. This new checking approach was called NSAA, NonStop Advanced Architecture.

As in the earlier migration from stack machines to MIPS microprocessors, all customer software was carried forward without source changes. &quot;Native mode&quot; source code compiled directly to MIPS machine code was simply recompiled for Itanium. Some older &quot;non-native&quot; software was still in TNS stack machine form. These were automatically ported onto Itanium via object code translation techniques.

== Itanium migration to Intel X86 ==
The next endeavor was to move from Itanium to the Intel x86 architecture. It was completed in 2014 with the first systems being made commercially available.

The inclusion of the fault-tolerant 4X FDR (Fourteen Data Rate) InfiniBand double-wide switches provided more than 25 times increase in system interconnect capacity.

== Outlook, other ==
NSK Guardian also became the base for the HP Neoview OS, the operating system used in the HP Neoview systems that were tailored for use in Business Intelligence and Enterprise Data Warehouse use. NonStop SQL/MX was also the starting point for Neoview SQL, which was tailored to Business Intelligence use. The code was also ported to Linux and served as the basis for the Apache Trafodion project.

== Corporate culture ==
Treybig&#x27;s business plan included detailed ideas for building a corporate culture reflecting Treybig&#x27;s values, such as paid six week sabbaticals every four years for all employees, an annual gift of 100 shares of Tandem stock to all employees, a weekly all-employee party known as Beer Bust Fridays, and a world-wide closed circuit monthly telecast (&quot;First Friday&quot;) to keep employees informed.

<text>Squaring the circle is a problem in geometry first proposed in Greek mathematics. It is the challenge of constructing a square with the area of a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with a compass and straightedge. The difficulty of the problem raised the question of whether specified axioms of Euclidean geometry concerning the existence of lines and circles implied the existence of such a square.

In 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, which proves that pi (formula_1) is a transcendental number.
That is, formula_1 is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients. It had been known for decades that the construction would be impossible if formula_1 were transcendental, but that fact was not proven until 1882. Approximate constructions with any given non-perfect accuracy exist, and many such constructions have been found.

Despite the proof that it is impossible, attempts to square the circle have been common in pseudomathematics (i.e. the work of mathematical cranks). The expression &quot;squaring the circle&quot; is sometimes used as a metaphor for trying to do the impossible. 

The term &quot;quadrature of the circle&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for squaring the circle. It may also refer to approximate or numerical methods for finding the area of a circle. In general, quadrature or squaring may also be applied to other plane figures.

==History==
Methods to calculate the approximate area of a given circle, which can be thought of as a precursor problem to squaring the circle, were known already in many ancient cultures. These methods can be summarized by stating the approximation to that they produce. In around 2000 BCE, the Babylonian mathematicians used the approximation and at approximately the same time the ancient Egyptian mathematicians used Over 1000 years later, the Old Testament &quot;Books of Kings&quot; used the simpler approximation Ancient Indian mathematics, as recorded in the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; and &quot;Shulba Sutras&quot;, used several different approximations Archimedes proved a formula for the area of a circle, according to which formula_4. In Chinese mathematics, in the third century CE, Liu Hui found even more accurate approximations using a method similar to that of Archimedes, and in the fifth century Zu Chongzhi found formula_5, an approximation known as Milü.

The problem of constructing a square whose area is exactly that of a circle, rather than an approximation to it, comes from Greek mathematics. Greek mathematicians found compass and straightedge constructions to convert any polygon into a square of equivalent area. They used this construction to compare areas of polygons geometrically, rather than by the numerical computation of area that would be more typical in modern mathematics. As Proclus wrote many centuries later, this motivated the search for methods that would allow comparisons with non-polygonal shapes:


The first known Greek to study the problem was Anaxagoras, who worked on it while in prison. Hippocrates of Chios attacked the problem by finding a shape bounded by circular arcs, the lune of Hippocrates, that could be squared. Antiphon the Sophist believed that inscribing regular polygons within a circle and doubling the number of sides would eventually fill up the area of the circle (this is the method of exhaustion). Since any polygon can be squared, he argued, the circle can be squared. In contrast, Eudemus argued that magnitudes can be divided up without limit, so the area of the circle would never be used up. Contemporaneously with Antiphon, Bryson of Heraclea argued that, since larger and smaller circles both exist, there must be a circle of equal area; this principle can be seen as a form of the modern intermediate value theorem. The more general goal of carrying out all geometric constructions using only a compass and straightedge has often been attributed to Oenopides, but the evidence for this is circumstantial.

The problem of finding the area under an arbitrary curve, now known as integration in calculus, or quadrature in numerical analysis, was known as &quot;squaring&quot; before the invention of calculus. Since the techniques of calculus were unknown, it was generally presumed that a squaring should be done via geometric constructions, that is, by compass and straightedge. For example, Newton wrote to Oldenburg in 1676 &quot;I believe M. Leibnitz will not dislike the theorem towards the beginning of my letter pag. 4 for squaring curve lines geometrically&quot;. In modern mathematics the terms have diverged in meaning, with quadrature generally used when methods from calculus are allowed, while squaring the curve retains the idea of using only restricted geometric methods.

A 1647 attempt at squaring the circle, &quot;Opus geometricum quadraturae circuli et sectionum coni decem libris comprehensum&quot; by Grégoire de Saint-Vincent, was heavily criticized by Vincent Léotaud. Nevertheless, de Saint-Vincent succeeded in his quadrature of the hyperbola, and in doing so was one of the earliest to develop the natural logarithm. James Gregory, following de Saint-Vincent, attempted another proof of the impossibility of squaring the circle in &quot;Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura&quot; (The True Squaring of the Circle and of the Hyperbola) in 1667. Although his proof was faulty, it was the first paper to attempt to solve the problem using algebraic properties of formula_1. Johann Heinrich Lambert proved in 1761 that formula_1 is an irrational number. It was not until 1882 that Ferdinand von Lindemann succeeded in proving more strongly that is a transcendental number, and by doing so also proved the impossibility of squaring the circle with compass and straightedge.

After Lindemann&#x27;s impossibility proof, the problem was considered to be settled by professional mathematicians, and its subsequent mathematical history is dominated by pseudomathematical attempts at circle-squaring constructions, largely by amateurs, and by the debunking of these efforts. As well, several later mathematicians including Srinivasa Ramanujan developed compass and straightedge constructions that approximate the problem accurately in few steps.

Two other classical problems of antiquity, famed for their impossibility, were doubling the cube and trisecting the angle. Like squaring the circle, these cannot be solved by compass and straightedge. However, they have a different character than squaring the circle, in that their solution involves the root of a cubic equation, rather than being transcendental. Therefore, more powerful methods than compass and straightedge constructions, such as neusis construction or mathematical paper folding, can be used to construct solutions to these problems.

==Impossibility==
The solution of the problem of squaring the circle by compass and straightedge requires the construction of the number formula_8, the length of the side of a square whose area equals that of a unit circle. If formula_8 were a constructible number, it would follow from standard compass and straightedge constructions that formula_1 would also be constructible. In 1837, Pierre Wantzel showed that lengths that could be constructed with compass and straightedge had to be solutions of certain polynomial equations with rational coefficients. Thus, constructible lengths must be algebraic numbers. If the circle could be squared using only compass and straightedge, then formula_1 would have to be an algebraic number. It was not until 1882 that Ferdinand von Lindemann proved the transcendence of formula_1 and so showed the impossibility of this construction. Lindemann&#x27;s idea was to combine the proof of transcendence of Euler&#x27;s number formula_13, shown by Charles Hermite in 1873, with Euler&#x27;s identity
formula_14
This identity immediately shows that formula_1 is an irrational number, because a rational power of a transcendental number remains transcendental. Lindemann was able to extend this argument, through the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem on linear independence of algebraic powers of formula_13, to show that formula_1 is transcendental and therefore that squaring the circle is impossible.

Bending the rules by introducing a supplemental tool, allowing an infinite number of compass-and-straightedge operations or by performing the operations in certain non-Euclidean geometries makes squaring the circle possible in some sense. For example, Dinostratus&#x27; theorem uses the quadratrix of Hippias to square the circle, meaning that if this curve is somehow already given, then a square and circle of equal areas can be constructed from it. The Archimedean spiral can be used for another similar construction. Although the circle cannot be squared in Euclidean space, it sometimes can be in hyperbolic geometry under suitable interpretations of the terms. The hyperbolic plane does not contain squares (quadrilaterals with four right angles and four equal sides), but instead it contains &quot;regular quadrilaterals&quot;, shapes with four equal sides and four equal angles sharper than right angles. There exist in the hyperbolic plane (countably) infinitely many pairs of constructible circles and constructible regular quadrilaterals of equal area, which, however, are constructed simultaneously. There is no method for starting with an arbitrary regular quadrilateral and constructing the circle of equal area. Symmetrically, there is no method for starting with an arbitrary circle and constructing a regular quadrilateral of equal area, and for sufficiently large circles no such quadrilateral exists.

== Approximate constructions ==
Although squaring the circle exactly with compass and straightedge is impossible, approximations to squaring the circle can be given by constructing lengths close to formula_1.
It takes only elementary geometry to convert any given rational approximation of formula_1 into a corresponding compass and straightedge construction, but such constructions tend to be very long-winded in comparison to the accuracy they achieve. After the exact problem was proven unsolvable, some mathematicians applied their ingenuity to finding approximations to squaring the circle that are particularly simple among other imaginable constructions that give similar precision.

=== Construction by Kochański ===

One of many early historical approximate compass-and-straightedge constructions is from a 1685 paper by Polish Jesuit Adam Adamandy Kochański, producing an approximation diverging from formula_1 in the 5th decimal place. Although much more precise numerical approximations to formula_1 were already known, Kochański&#x27;s construction has the advantage of being quite simple. In the left diagram
formula_22 
In the same work, Kochański also derived a sequence of increasingly accurate rational approximations 
=== Constructions using 355/113 ===

Jacob de Gelder published in 1849 a construction based on the approximation
formula_23
This value is accurate to six decimal places and has been known in China since the 5th century as Milü, and in Europe since the 17th century.

Gelder did not construct the side of the square; it was enough for him to find the value 
formula_24
The illustration shows de Gelder&#x27;s construction.

In 1914, Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan gave another geometric construction for the same approximation.
=== Constructions using the golden ratio ===
An approximate construction by E. W. Hobson in 1913 is accurate to three decimal places. Hobson&#x27;s construction corresponds to an approximate value of
formula_25 where formula_26 is the golden ratio, formula_27.

The same approximate value appears in a 1991 construction by Robert Dixon. In 2022 Frédéric Beatrix presented a geometrographic construction in 13 steps.
=== Second construction by Ramanujan ===

In 1914, Ramanujan gave a construction which was equivalent to taking the approximate value for formula_1 to be
formula_29
giving eight decimal places of formula_1. 
He describes the construction of line segment OS as follows.


==Incorrect constructions==
In his old age, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes convinced himself that he had succeeded in squaring the circle, a claim refuted by John Wallis as part of the Hobbes–Wallis controversy. During the 18th and 19th century, the false notions that the problem of squaring the circle was somehow related to the longitude problem, and that a large reward would be given for a solution, became prevalent among would-be circle squarers. In 1851, John Parker published a book &quot;Quadrature of the Circle&quot; in which he claimed to have squared the circle. His method actually produced an approximation of formula_1 accurate to six digits.

The Victorian-age mathematician, logician, and writer Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known by his pseudonym Lewis Carroll, also expressed interest in debunking illogical circle-squaring theories. In one of his diary entries for 1855, Dodgson listed books he hoped to write, including one called &quot;Plain Facts for Circle-Squarers&quot;. In the introduction to &quot;A New Theory of Parallels&quot;, Dodgson recounted an attempt to demonstrate logical errors to a couple of circle-squarers, stating:

A ridiculing of circle squaring appears in Augustus De Morgan&#x27;s book &quot;A Budget of Paradoxes&quot;, published posthumously by his widow in 1872. Having originally published the work as a series of articles in &quot;The Athenæum&quot;, he was revising it for publication at the time of his death. Circle squaring declined in popularity after the nineteenth century, and it is believed that De Morgan&#x27;s work helped bring this about.
Even after it had been proved impossible, in 1894, amateur mathematician Edwin J. Goodwin claimed that he had developed a method to square the circle. The technique he developed did not accurately square the circle, and provided an incorrect area of the circle which essentially redefined formula_1 as equal to 3.2. Goodwin then proposed the Indiana pi bill in the Indiana state legislature allowing the state to use his method in education without paying royalties to him. The bill passed with no objections in the state house, but the bill was tabled and never voted on in the Senate, amid increasing ridicule from the press.

The mathematical crank Carl Theodore Heisel also claimed to have squared the circle in his 1934 book, &quot;Behold! : the grand problem no longer unsolved: the circle squared beyond refutation.&quot; Paul Halmos referred to the book as a &quot;classic crank book.&quot;

==In literature==
The problem of squaring the circle has been mentioned over a wide range of literary eras, with a variety of metaphorical meanings. Its literary use dates back at least to 414 BC, when the play &quot;The Birds&quot; by Aristophanes was first performed. In it, the character Meton of Athens mentions squaring the circle, possibly to indicate the paradoxical nature of his utopian city.
Dante&#x27;s &quot;Paradise&quot;, canto XXXIII, lines 133–135, contain the verse:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 1.6em&quot;&gt;
As the geometer his mind applies
To square the circle, nor for all his wit
Finds the right formula, howe&#x27;er he tries&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 1.6em&quot;&gt;
Qual è ’l geométra che tutto s’affige
per misurar lo cerchio, e non ritrova,
pensando, quel principio ond’elli indige,&lt;/poem&gt;
For Dante, squaring the circle represents a task beyond human comprehension, which he compares to his own inability to comprehend Paradise. Dante&#x27;s image also calls to mind a passage from Vitruvius, famously illustrated later in Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot;, of a man simultaneously inscribed in a circle and a square. Dante uses the circle as a symbol for God, and may have mentioned this combination of shapes in reference to the simultaneous divine and human nature of Jesus. Earlier, in canto XIII, Dante calls out Greek circle-squarer Bryson as having sought knowledge instead of wisdom.

Several works of 17th-century poet Margaret Cavendish elaborate on the circle-squaring problem and its metaphorical meanings, including a contrast between unity of truth and factionalism, and the impossibility of rationalizing &quot;fancy and female nature&quot;. By 1742, when Alexander Pope published the fourth book of his &quot;Dunciad&quot;, attempts at circle-squaring had come to be seen as &quot;wild and fruitless&quot;:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 1.6em&quot;&gt;Mad Mathesis alone was unconfined,
Too mad for mere material chains to bind,
Now to pure space lifts her ecstatic stare,
Now, running round the circle, finds it square.&lt;/poem&gt;

Similarly, the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera &quot;Princess Ida&quot; features a song which satirically lists the impossible goals of the women&#x27;s university run by the title character, such as finding perpetual motion. One of these goals is &quot;And the circle – they will square it/Some fine day.&quot;

The sestina, a poetic form first used in the 12th century by Arnaut Daniel, has been said to metaphorically square the circle in its use of a square number of lines (six stanzas of six lines each) with a circular scheme of six repeated words. writes that this form invokes a symbolic meaning in which the circle stands for heaven and the square stands for the earth. A similar metaphor was used in &quot;Squaring the Circle&quot;, a 1908 short story by O. Henry, about a long-running family feud. In the title of this story, the circle represents the natural world, while the square represents the city, the world of man.

In later works, circle-squarers such as Leopold Bloom in James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; and Lawyer Paravant in Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; are seen as sadly deluded or as unworldly dreamers, unaware of its mathematical impossibility and making grandiose plans for a result they will never attain.

<text>Eomaia (&quot;dawn mother&quot;) is a genus of extinct fossil mammals containing the single species Eomaia scansoria, discovered in rocks that were found in the Yixian Formation, Liaoning Province, China, and dated to the Barremian Age of the Lower Cretaceous about . The single fossil specimen of this species is in length and virtually complete. An estimate of the body weight is . It is exceptionally well-preserved for a 125-million-year-old specimen. Although the fossil&#x27;s skull is squashed flat, its teeth, tiny foot bones, cartilages and even its fur are visible.

==Description==

The &quot;Eomaia&quot; fossil shows clear traces of hair. However, this is not the earliest clear evidence of hair in the mammalian lineage, as fossils of &quot;Volaticotherium&quot;, and the docodont &quot;Castorocauda&quot;, discovered in rocks dated to about , also have traces of fur.

&quot;Eomaia scansoria&quot; possessed several features in common with placental mammals that distinguish them from metatherians, the group that includes modern marsupials. These include an enlarged malleolus (&quot;little hammer&quot;) at the bottom of the tibia (the larger of the two shin bones), a joint between the first metatarsal bone and the medial cuneiform bone in the foot which is offset further back than the joint between the second metatarsal and intermediate cuneiform bones (in metatherians these joints are level with each other), as well as various features of jaws and teeth.

However, &quot;E. scansoria&quot; is not a true placental mammal as it lacks some features that are specific to placentals. These include the presence of a malleolus at the bottom of the fibula, the smaller of the two shin bones, a complete mortise and tenon upper ankle joint, where the rearmost bones of the foot fit into a socket formed by the ends of the tibia and fibula, and an atypical ancestral eutherian dental formula of . &quot;Eomaia&quot; had five upper and four lower incisors (much more typical for metatherians) and five premolars to three molars. Placental mammals have only up to three incisors on each top and bottom and four premolars to three molars, but the premolar/molar proportion is similar to placentals.

&quot;Eomaia&quot;, like other early mammals and living marsupials, had a narrow pelvic outlet suggesting small undeveloped neonates requiring extensive nurturing.
Epipubic bones extend forwards from the pelvis; these are not found in any placental, but are found in all other mammals, including non-placental eutherians, marsupials, monotremes and other Mesozoic mammals as well as in the cynodont therapsids that are closest to mammals. Their function is to stiffen the body during locomotion. This stiffening would be harmful in pregnant placentals, whose abdomens need to expand.

==Classification==

The discoverers of &quot;Eomaia&quot; claimed that, on the basis of 268 characters sampled from all major Mesozoic mammal clades and principal eutherian families of the Cretaceous, &quot;Eomaia&quot; could be placed at the root of the eutherian &quot;family tree&quot; along with &quot;Murtoilestes&quot; and &quot;Prokennalestes&quot;. This initial classification scheme is summarized below.
 
In 2013, a much larger study of mammal relationships (including fossil species) was published by O&#x27;Leary et al. 
The study, which examined 4541 anatomical characters of 86 mammal species (including &quot;Eomaia scansoria&quot;), found &quot;100% jackknife support that &quot;Eomaia&quot; falls outside of Eutheria as a stem taxon to Theria&quot;, and so could not be considered a placental or a eutherian as previously hypothesized. The results of this study are summarized in the cladogram below.
The 2013 study by O&#x27;Leary &quot;et al&quot;. is part of a debate about the age of origin of placental mammals (see discussions.), and in all trees published in that paper &quot;Eomaia&quot; fell outside Theria (i.e., debates about the findings of O&#x27;Leary et al. have not centered on the position of &quot;Eomaia&quot;). Meng (2014), who was a co-author on the O&#x27;Leary et al. (2013) paper, subsequently referred to &quot;Eomaia&quot; as a Eutherian but provided no analysis to support this claim. Gheerbrant et al. 2014 mentioned &quot;Eomaia&quot; in a list of Cretaceous taxa that represented &quot;the primitive eutherian condition&quot; but provided no analytical evidence for this claim; a similar claim was repeated by Sole et al. (2014) again without analytical support.

A 2023 cladistical study again recovered &quot;Eomaia&quot; as a basal eutherian.

<text>The historical Vedic religion, also called Vedicism or Vedism, and sometimes ancient Hinduism or Vedic Hinduism, constituted the religious ideas and practices prevalent amongst some of the Indo-Aryan peoples of the northwest Indian subcontinent (Punjab and the western Ganges plain) during the Vedic period ( 1500–500 BCE). These ideas and practices are found in the Vedic texts, and some Vedic rituals are still practiced today. The Vedic religion is one of the major traditions which shaped modern Hinduism, though present-day Hinduism is significantly different from the historical Vedic religion.

The Vedic religion has roots in the Indo-Iranian culture and religion of the Sintashta ( 2200–1750 BCE) and Andronovo ( 2000–1150 BCE) cultures of Eurasian Steppe. This Indo-Iranian religion borrowed &quot;distinctive religious beliefs and practices&quot; from the non-Indo-Aryan Bactria–Margiana culture (BMAC; 2250–1700 BCE) of south of Central Asia, when pastoral Indo-Aryan tribes stayed there as a separate people in the early 2nd millennium BCE. From the BMAC Indo-Aryan tribes migrated to the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent, and the Vedic religion developed there during the early Vedic period ( 1500–1100 BCE) as a variant of Indo-Aryan religion, influenced by the remnants of the late Indus Valley Civilisation (2600–1900 BCE). 

During the late Vedic period ( 1100–500 BCE) Brahmanism developed out of the Vedic religion, as an ideology of the Kuru-Panchala realm which expanded into a wider area after the demise of the Kuru-Pancala realm and the domination of the non-Vedic Magadha cultural sphere. Brahmanism was one of the major influences that shaped contemporary Hinduism, when it was synthesized with the non-Vedic Indo-Aryan religious heritage of the eastern Ganges plain (which also gave rise to Buddhism and Jainism), and with local religious traditions.

Specific rituals and sacrifices of the Vedic religion include, among others: the Soma rituals; Fire rituals involving oblations (havir); and the Ashvamedha (horse sacrifice). The rites of grave burials as well as cremation are seen since the Rigvedic period. Deities emphasized in the Vedic religion include Dyaus, Indra, Agni, Rudra and Varuna, and important ethical concepts include &quot;satya&quot; and &quot;ṛta&quot;.

==Terminology==

===Vedism and Brahmanism===
&quot;Vedism&quot; refers to the oldest form of the Vedic religion, when Indo-Aryans entered into the valley of the Indus River in multiple waves during the 2nd millennium BCE. &quot;Brahmanism&quot; refers to the further developed form of the late Vedic period which took shape at the Ganges basin around 1000 BCE. According to Heesterman, &quot;It is loosely known as Brahmanism because of the religious and legal importance it places on the brāhmaṇa (priestly) class of society.&quot; During the late Vedic period, the Brahmanas and early Upanishads were composed. Both Vedism and Brahmanism regard the Veda as sacred, but Brahmanism is more inclusive, incorporating doctrines and themes beyond the Vedas with practices like temple worship, puja, meditation, renunciation, vegetarianism, the role of the guru, and other non-Vedic elements important to Hindu religious life.

===Ancient Hinduism and Vedic Hinduism===
The terms &quot;ancient Hinduism&quot; and &quot;Vedic Hinduism&quot; have also been used when referring to the ancient Vedic religion. 

According to Heinrich von Stietencron, in 19th century western publications, the Vedic religion was believed to be different from and unrelated to Hinduism. Instead, Hinduism was thought to be linked to the Hindu epics and the Puranas through sects based on purohita, tantras and &quot;Bhakti&quot;. In response to western colonialism and (Protestant) proselytizing, Hindu reform movements like the Brahmo Samaj and the Neo-Vedanta in the late 19th and early 20th century rejected the &#x27;superstitions&#x27; of Puranic Hinduism, which in their view had deviated from the Vedic heritage, instead propagating a return to the Vedas and to restore an &quot;imagined&quot; original, rational and monotheistic ancient Hinduism with an equal standing as Protestant Christianity.

In the 20th century, the neo-Hindu emphasis on Vedic roots, and a better understanding of the Vedic religion and its shared heritage and theology with contemporary Hinduism, led scholars to view the historical Vedic religion as ancestral to modern Hinduism. The historical Vedic religion is now generally accepted to be a predecessor of modern Hinduism, but they are not the same because the textual evidence suggests significant differences between the two. These include the belief in an afterlife instead of the later developed reincarnation and samsāra concepts. Nevertheless, while &quot;it is usually taught that the beginnings of historical Hinduism date from around the beginning of the Common Era,&quot; when &quot;the key tendencies, the crucial elements that would be encompassed in Hindu traditions, collectively came together,&quot; some scholars have come to view the term &quot;Hinduism&quot; as encompassing Vedism and Brahmanism, in addition to the recent synthesis.

==Origins and development==
===Indo-Aryan Vedic religion===
The Vedic religion refers to the religious beliefs of some Vedic Indo-Aryan tribes, the &quot;aryas&quot;, who migrated into the Indus River valley region of the Indian subcontinent after the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation. The Vedic religion, and subsequent Brahmanism, center on the myths and ritual ideologies of the Vedas, as distinguished from Agamic, Tantric and sectarian forms of Indian religion, which take recourse to the authority of non-Vedic textual sources. The Vedic religion is described in the Vedas and associated with voluminous Vedic literature, including the early Upanishads, preserved into the modern times by the different priestly schools. The religion existed in the western Ganges plain in the early Vedic period from 1500–1100 BCE, and developed into Brahmanism in the late Vedic period ( 1100–500 BCE). The eastern Ganges plain was dominated by another Indo-Aryan complex, which rejected the later Brahmanical ideology and gave rise to Jainism and Buddhism, and the Maurya Empire.

==== Indo-European roots and syncreticism ====
The Indo-Aryans were speakers of a branch of the Indo-European language family which originated in the Sintashta culture and further developed into the Andronovo culture, which in turn developed out of the Kurgan culture of the Central Asian steppes. The commonly proposed period of earlier Vedic age is dated back to 2nd millennium BCE.

The Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesized Proto-Indo-European religion, and shows relations with rituals from the Andronovo culture, from which the Indo-Aryan people descended. According to Anthony, the Old Indic religion probably emerged among Indo-European immigrants in the contact zone between the Zeravshan River (present-day Uzbekistan) and (present-day) Iran. It was &quot;a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo-European elements&quot; which borrowed &quot;distinctive religious beliefs and practices&quot; from the Bactria–Margiana culture (BMAC). This syncretic influence is supported by at least 383 non-Indo-European words that were borrowed from this culture, including the god Indra and the ritual drink Soma. According to Anthony,
The oldest inscriptions in Old Indic, the language of the &quot;Rig Veda&quot;, are found in northern Syria, the location of the Mitanni kingdom. The Mitanni kings took Old Indic throne names, and Old Indic technical terms were used for horse-riding and chariot-driving. The Old Indic term r&#x27;ta, meaning &quot;cosmic order and truth&quot;, the central concept of the &quot;Rig Veda&quot;, was also employed in the Mitanni kingdom. Old Indic gods, including Indra, were also known in the Mitanni kingdom.

====South Asian influences====
The Vedic religion was the product of &quot;a composite of the Indo-Aryan and Harappan cultures and civilizations&quot;. White (2003) cites three other scholars who &quot;have emphatically demonstrated&quot; that Vedic religion is partially derived from the Indus Valley civilization. 

It is unclear if the theory in diverse Vedic texts actually reflect the folk practices, iconography, and other practical aspects of the Vedic religion. The Vedic religion changed when Indo-Aryan people migrated into the Ganges Plain after 1100 BCE and became settled farmers, further syncretizing with the native cultures of northern India. The evidence suggests that the Vedic religion evolved in &quot;two superficially contradictory directions&quot;, namely an ever more &quot;elaborate, expensive, and specialized system of rituals&quot;, which survives in the present-day &quot;srauta&quot;-ritual, and &quot;abstraction and internalization of the principles underlying ritual and cosmic speculation&quot; within oneself, akin to the Jain and Buddhist tradition.

Aspects of the historical Vedic religion still continue in modern times. For instance, the Nambudiri Brahmins continue the ancient Śrauta rituals, and the complex Vedic rituals of Śrauta are practiced in Kerala and coastal Andhra. The Kalash people residing in northwest Pakistan also continue to practice a form of the ancient Vedic religion. It has also been suggested by Michael Witzel that Shinto, the native religion of Japan, contains some influences from the ancient Vedic religion.

===Brahmanism===
====Historical Brahminism====
Brahmanism, also called Brahminism or Brahmanical Hinduism, developed out of the Vedic religion, incorporating non-Vedic religious ideas, and expanding to a region stretching from the northwest Indian subcontinent to the Ganges valley. Brahmanism included the Vedic corpus, but also post-Vedic texts such as the &quot;Dharmasutras&quot; and &quot;Dharmasastras&quot;, which gave prominence to the priestly (Brahmin) caste of the society, Heesterman also mentions the post-Vedic Smriti (Puranas and the Epics), which are also incorporated in the later Smarta tradition. The emphasis on ritual and the dominant position of Brahmins developed as an ideology in the Kuru-Pancala realm, and expanded over a wider area after the demise of the Kuru-Pancala kingdom and its incorporation into the Magadha-based empires. It co-existed with local religions, such as the Yaksha cults.

The word &quot;Brahmanism&quot; was coined by Gonçalo Fernandes Trancoso (1520–1596) in the 16th century. Historically, and still by some modern authors, the word &#x27;Brahmanism&#x27; was used in English to refer to the Hindu religion, treating the term Brahmanism as synonymous with Hinduism, and using it interchangeably. Michael S. Allen criticises the use of &quot;Brahminism&quot; for the &quot;greater Vedic tradition&quot;, arguing that it obscures the contribution of non-Brahmins to the tradition. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Brahminism was the most common term used in English for Hinduism.
Brahmanism gave importance to Absolute Reality (Brahman) speculations in the early Upanishads, as these terms are etymologically linked, which developed from post-Vedic ideas during the late Vedic era. The concept of Brahman is posited as that which existed before the creation of the universe, which constitutes all of existence thereafter, and into which the universe will dissolve, followed by similar endless creation-maintenance-destruction cycles.

The post-Vedic period of the Second Urbanisation saw a decline of Brahmanism. With the growth of political entities, which threatened the income and patronage of the rural Brahmins including; the Sramanic movement, the conquests of eastern empires from Magadha including the Nanda Empire and the Mauryan Empire, and also invasions and foreign rule of the northwestern Indian Subcontinent which brought in new political entities. This was overcome by providing new services and incorporating the non-Vedic Indo-Aryan religious heritage of the eastern Ganges plain and local religious traditions, giving rise to contemporary Hinduism. This &quot;new Brahmanism&quot; appealed to rulers, who were attracted to the supernatural powers and the practical advice Brahmins could provide, and resulted in a resurgence of Brahmanical influence, dominating Indian society since the classical Age of Hinduism in the early centuries CE.

====As a polemical term====
Nowadays, the term Brahmanism, used interchangeably with &quot;Brahminism&quot;, is used in several ways. It denotes the specific Brahmanical rituals and worldview as preserved in the Śrauta ritual, as distinct from the wide range of popular cultic activity with little connection with them. Brahminism also refers specifically to the Brahminical ideology, which sees Brahmins as naturally privileged people entitled to rule and dominate society. The term is frequently used by anti-Brahmin opponents, who object against their domination of Indian society and their exclusivist ideology. They follow the outline of 19th century colonial rulers, who viewed India&#x27;s culture as corrupt and degenerate, and its population as irrational. In this view, derived from a Christian understanding of religion, the original &quot;God-given religion&quot; was corrupted by priests, in this case Brahmins, and their religion, &quot;Brahminism&quot;, which was supposedly imposed on the Indian population. Reformist Hindus, and others such as Ambedkar, structured their criticism along similar lines.

==Textual history==

Texts dating to the Vedic period, composed in Vedic Sanskrit, are mainly the four Vedic Samhitas, but the Brahmanas, Aranyakas, and some of the older Upanishads are also placed in this period. The Vedas record the liturgy connected with the rituals and sacrifices. These texts are also considered as a part of the scripture of contemporary Hinduism.

&lt;poem&gt;
Who really knows?
Who will here proclaim it?
Whence was it produced? Whence is this creation?
The gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe.
Who then knows whence it has arisen?
— Nasadiya Sukta, &quot;Rig Veda&quot;, 10:129-6
&lt;/poem&gt;
==Characteristics==
The idea of reincarnation, or saṃsāra, is not mentioned in the early layers of the historic Vedic religion texts such as the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. The later layers of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; do mention ideas that suggest an approach towards the idea of rebirth, according to Ranade.

The early layers of the Vedas do not mention the doctrine of Karma and rebirth, but mention the belief in an afterlife. According to Sayers, these earliest layers of the Vedic literature show ancestor worship and rites such as &quot;sraddha&quot; (offering food to the ancestors). The later Vedic texts such as the &quot;Aranyakas&quot; and the &quot;Upanisads&quot; show a different soteriology based on reincarnation, they show little concern with ancestor rites, and they begin to philosophically interpret the earlier rituals. The idea of reincarnation and karma have roots in the Upanishads of the late Vedic period, predating the Buddha and the Mahavira. Similarly, the later layers of the Vedic literature such as the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; ( 800 BCE) – such as in section 4.4 – discuss the earliest versions of the Karma doctrine as well as causality.

The ancient Vedic religion lacked the belief in reincarnation and concepts such as Saṃsāra or Nirvana. It was a complex animistic religion with polytheistic and pantheistic aspects. Ancestor worship was an important, maybe the central component, of the ancient Vedic religion. Elements of the ancestors cult are still common in modern Hinduism in the form of Śrāddha.

According to Olivelle, some scholars state that the renouncer tradition was an &quot;organic and logical development of ideas found in the Vedic religious culture&quot;, while others state that these emerged from the &quot;indigenous non-Aryan population&quot;. This scholarly debate is a longstanding one, and is ongoing.

===Rituals===

Specific rituals and sacrifices of the Vedic religion include, among others:
*Fire rituals involving oblations (havir):
**The Agnyadheya, or installation of the fire
**The Agnihotra or oblation to Agni, a sun charm
**The Darshapurnamsa, the new and full moon sacrifices
**The four seasonal (Cāturmāsya) sacrifices
**The Agnicayana, the sophisticated ritual of piling the fire altar
*The Pashubandhu, the (semi-)annual animal sacrifice
*The Soma rituals, which involved the extraction, utility and consumption of Soma:
**The Jyotishtoma
***The Agnishtoma
****The Pravargya (originally an independent rite, later absorbed into the soma rituals)
***The Ukthya
***The Sodashin
***The Atyagnishtoma
***The Atiratra
***The Aptoryama
***The Vajapeya
*The royal consecration (Rajasuya) sacrifice
*The Ashvamedha (horse sacrifice) or a Yajna dedicated to the glory, wellbeing and prosperity of the kingdom or empire
*The Purushamedha
*The rituals and charms referred to in the Atharvaveda are concerned with medicine and healing practices
*The Gomedha or cow sacrifice:
**The Taittiriya Brahmana of the Yajur Veda gives instructions for selecting the cow for the sacrifice depending on the deity.
**Panchasaradiya sava – celebration where 17 cows are immolated once every five years. The Taittiriya Brahmana advocates the Panchasaradiya for those who want to be great.
**Sulagava – sacrifice where roast beef is offered. It is mentioned in the Grihya Sutra
**According to Dr. R. Mitra, the offered animal was intended for consumption as detailed in the Asvalayana Sutra. The Gopatha Brahmana lists the different individuals who are to receive the various parts like Pratiharta (neck and hump), the Udgatr, the Neshta, the Sadasya, the householder who performs the sacrifice (the two right feet), his wife (the two left feet) and so on.

The Hindu rites of cremation are seen since the Rigvedic period; while they are attested from early times in the Cemetery H culture, there is a late Rigvedic reference invoking forefathers &quot;both cremated (&quot;agnidagdhá-&quot;) and uncremated (&quot;ánagnidagdha-&quot;)&quot;. (RV 10.15.14)

===Pantheon===

Though a large number of names for devas occur in the Rigveda, only 33 devas are counted, eleven each of earth, space, and heaven. The Vedic pantheon knows two classes, Devas and Asuras. The Devas (Mitra, Varuna, Aryaman, Bhaga, Amsa, etc.) are deities of cosmic and social order, from the universe and kingdoms down to the individual. The Rigveda is a collection of hymns to various deities, most notably heroic Indra, Agni the sacrificial fire and messenger of the gods, and Soma, the deified sacred drink of the Indo-Iranians. Also prominent is Varuna (often paired with Mitra) and the group of &quot;All-gods&quot;, the Vishvadevas.

===Sages===
In the Hindu tradition, the revered sages of this era were Yajnavalkya, Atharvan, Atri, Bharadvaja, Gautama Maharishi, Jamadagni, Kashyapa, Vasistha, Bhrigu, Kutsa, Pulastya, Kratu, Pulaha, Vishwamitra Narayana, Kanva, Rishabha, Vamadeva, and Angiras.

===Ethics – satya and rta===
Ethics in the Vedas are based on concepts like &quot;satya&quot; and &quot;ṛta&quot;.

In the Vedas and later sutras, the meaning of the word satya () evolves into an ethical concept about truthfulness and is considered an important virtue. It means being true and consistent with reality in one&#x27;s thought, speech and action.

Vedic and its Avestan equivalent &quot;&quot; are both thought by some to derive from Proto-Indo-Iranian &quot;truth&quot;, which in turn may continue from a possible Proto-Indo-European &quot;*&quot; &quot;properly joined, right, true&quot;, from a presumed root &quot;*&quot;. The derivative noun &quot;ṛta&quot; is defined as &quot;fixed or settled order, rule, divine law or truth&quot;. As Mahony (1998) notes, however, the term can be translated as &quot;that which has moved in a fitting manner&quot; – although this meaning is not actually cited by authoritative Sanskrit dictionaries it is a regular derivation from the verbal root -, and abstractly as &quot;universal law&quot; or &quot;cosmic order&quot;, or simply as &quot;truth&quot;. The latter meaning dominates in the Avestan cognate to &quot;Ṛta&quot;, &quot;aša&quot;.

Owing to the nature of Vedic Sanskrit, the term &quot;Ṛta&quot; can be used to indicate numerous things, either directly or indirectly, and both Indian and European scholars have experienced difficulty in arriving at fitting interpretations for &quot;Ṛta&quot; in all of its various usages in the Vedas, though the underlying sense of &quot;ordered action&quot; remains universally evident.

The term is also found in the Proto-Indo-Iranian religion, the religion of the Indo-Iranian peoples. The term &quot;dharma&quot; was already used in the later Brahmanical thoughts, where it was conceived as an aspect of &quot;ṛta&quot;.

===Vedic mythology===
The central myth at the base of Vedic ritual surrounds Indra who, inebriated by Soma, slays the dragon (&quot;ahi&quot;) Vritra, freeing the rivers, the cows, and Dawn.

Vedic mythology contains numerous elements which are common to Indo-European mythological traditions, like the mythologies of Persia, Greece, and Rome, and those of the Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, and Slavic peoples. The Vedic god Indra in part corresponds to Dyaus Pitar, the Sky Father, Zeus, Jupiter, Thor and Tyr, or Perun. The deity Yama, the lord of the dead, is hypothesized to be related to Yima of Persian mythology. Vedic hymns refer to these and other deities, often 33, consisting of 8 Vasus, 11 Rudras, 12 Adityas, and in the late Rigvedas, Prajapati. These deities belong to the 3 regions of the universe or heavens, the earth, and the intermediate space.

Some major deities of the Vedic tradition include Indra, Dyaus, Surya, Agni, Ushas, Vayu, Varuna, Mitra, Aditi, Yama, Soma, Sarasvati, Prithvi, and Rudra.

==Post-Vedic religions==
The Vedic period is held to have ended around 500 BCE. The period between 800 BCE and 200 BCE is the formative period for later Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. According to Michaels, the period between 500 BCE and 200 BCE is a time of &quot;ascetic reformism&quot;, while the period between 200 BCE and 1100 CE is the time of &quot;classical Hinduism&quot;, since there is &quot;a turning point between the Vedic religion and Hindu religions&quot;. Muesse discerns a longer period of change, namely between 800 BCE and 200 BCE, which he calls the &quot;Classical Period&quot;, when &quot;traditional religious practices and beliefs were reassessed. The Brahmins and the rituals they performed no longer enjoyed the same prestige they had in the Vedic period&quot;.

Brahmanism evolved into Hinduism, which is significantly different from the preceding Brahmanism, though &quot;it is also convenient to have a single term for the whole complex of interrelated traditions.&quot; The transition from ancient Brahmanism to schools of Hinduism was a form of evolution in interaction with non-Vedic traditions. This transition preserved many central ideas and theosophy found in the Vedas while synergistically integrating non-Vedic ideas. While part of Hinduism, Vedanta, Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hinduism share their concern with escape from the suffering of existence with Buddhism.

===Continuation of orthodox ritual===
According to Axel Michaels, the Vedic gods declined but did not disappear, and local cults were assimilated into the Vedic-Brahmanic pantheon, which changed into the Hindu pantheon. Deities such as Shiva and Vishnu became more prominent and gave rise to Shaivism and Vaishnavism.

According to David Knipe, some communities in India have preserved and continue to practice portions of the historical Vedic religion, as observed in Kerala and Andhra Pradesh states and elsewhere. According to the historian and Sanskrit linguist Michael Witzel, some of the rituals of the Kalash people have elements of the historical Vedic religion, but there are also some differences such as the presence of fire next to the altar instead of &quot;in the altar&quot; as in the Vedic religion.

===Mīmāṃsā and Vedanta===
Mīmāṃsā philosophers argue that there was no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there was no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a god to validate the rituals. Mīmāṃsā argues that the gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the &quot;mantras&quot; that speak their names. To that regard, the power of the mantras is what is seen as the power of gods.

Of the continuation of the Vedic tradition in the Upanishads, Fowler writes the following:
The Upanishads gradually evolved into Vedanta, which is one of the primary schools of thought within Hinduism. Vedanta considers itself &quot;the purpose or goal [end] of the Vedas&quot;.

===Sramana tradition===
The non-Vedic śramaṇa traditions existed alongside Brahmanism. These were not direct outgrowths of Vedism, but movements with mutual influences with Brahmanical traditions, reflecting &quot;the cosmology and anthropology of a much older, pre-Aryan upper class of northeastern India&quot;. Jainism and Buddhism evolved out of the Shramana tradition.

There are Jaina references to 22 prehistoric tirthankaras. In this view, Jainism peaked at the time of Mahavira (traditionally put in the 6th century BCE). Buddhism, traditionally put from c. 500 BCE, declined in India over the 5th to 12th centuries in favor of Puranic Hinduism and Islam.

<text>Rhabditida is an order of free-living, parasitic and microbivorous nematodes living in soil.

The Cephalobidae, Panagrolaimidae, Steinernematidae, and Strongyloididae seem to be closer to the Tylenchia, regardless of whether these are merged with the Rhabditia or not.

<doc id="201369" wikidata="Q776807" url="?curid=201369" title="Magdalene College, Cambridge">
<text>Magdalene College ( ) is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. The college was founded in 1428 as a Benedictine hostel, in time coming to be known as Buckingham College, before being refounded in 1542 as the College of St Mary Magdalene.

Magdalene counted some of the most prominent men in the realm among its benefactors, including Britain&#x27;s premier noble the Duke of Norfolk, the Duke of Buckingham and Lord Chief Justice Christopher Wray. Thomas Audley, Lord Chancellor under Henry VIII, was responsible for the refoundation of the college and also established its motto—&quot;garde ta foy&quot; (Old French: &quot;keep your faith&quot;). Audley&#x27;s successors in the mastership and as benefactors of the college were, however, prone to dire ends; several benefactors were arraigned at various stages on charges of high treason and executed.

The college remains one of the smaller in the university, numbering around 400 undergraduate and 200 graduate students. It has maintained strong academic performance over the past decade, achieving an average of ninth in the Tompkins Table and coming second in 2015. Magdalene is home to the Pepys Library, which holds the collection of rare books and manuscripts that belonged to the English diarist Samuel Pepys, an alumnus of the college.

==History==

===Buckingham College===
Magdalene College was first founded in 1428 as &quot;Monk&#x27;s Hostel&quot;, which hosted Benedictine student monks. The secluded location of the hostel was chosen because it was separated from the town centre by the River Cam and protected by Cambridge Castle. The main buildings of the college were constructed in the 1470s under the leadership of John de Wisbech, then Abbot of Crowland. Under the patronage of Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, the institution was renamed &quot;Buckingham College&quot;.

In the 16th century, the Church of England broke away from the Papacy. With the subsequent Dissolution of the Monasteries, the parent abbey of Buckingham College, Crowland Abbey, was dissolved. However, the college remained in operation.

===Refoundation===
Walden Abbey, one of the Benedictine abbeys associated with Buckingham College, came into the possession of Thomas Audley after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. On 3 April 1542 Audley refounded Buckingham College as the College of Saint Mary Magdalene. Derived from Audley were the arms of Magdalene, including the motto &quot;Garde Ta Foy&quot; (from Old French for &quot;keep your faith&quot;), and the wyvern as the crest.

Thomas Audley died in 1544 aged 56, only two years after he re-founded the college. He donated to the college seven acres of property at Aldgate in London, which was his reward from Henry VIII for disposing of Anne Boleyn. This property would have brought enormous income had it been retained by the college. However, under the conspiracy of the Elizabethan banker Benedict Spinola, the property was permanently alienated to the Crown in 1574. The transaction involved Spinola luring the master and fellows of the time to accept an increase in the annual rental from £9 to £15 a year in exchange for the property. The loss of the Aldgate property left the college in extreme poverty, and the street front of the college was only completed in the 1580s under the generosity of Christopher Wray, then Lord Chief Justice of the Queen&#x27;s Bench. The transaction was &quot;almost certainly illegal&quot;, and was contested multiple times without success. The first and most famous such lawsuit was pursued in 1615 by Barnaby Goche, who was master of the college between 1604 and 1626. This court case landed Goche and the senior fellow in prison for two years. Goche was subsequently offered £10,000 as a compromise, which he refused to accept. When the Quayside development site of Magdalene College was completed in 1989, a gargoyle of Spinola which spits water into the Cam was installed as a &quot;revenge at last&quot;.

In 1650, Samuel Pepys joined the college. He was best known for his private diaries, known to critics as the &quot;Pepys Diary&quot;, which provided a major eyewitness account for the Great Fire of London of 1666. Pepys was remembered by the Pepys Library, built around 1700, where the original manuscripts of his diaries and naval records are kept, in addition to his collection of printed books and engravings in their original bookcases. Pepys stipulated in his will that the library was to be left to Magdalene, and have been kept at the college since their donation by Pepys&#x27;s nephew, John Jackson, in 1724. The building was also home to Magdalene College library, until the construction of the New Library.

===Enlightenment===
Daniel Waterland, a theologian by training, became master of the college in 1714 and prescribed a new curriculum for undergraduate students at Magdalene. His new curriculum included Mathematics, Newtonian Physics, Geography and Astronomy, as well as Classics, Logic and Metaphysics. Waterland was also successful in attracting financial aid for the college, including funds for scholarships. The mathematician Edward Waring was among those who joined the college during this period.

In 1781, Peter Peckard, one of the earliest abolitionists, became master of Magdalene. The &quot;Zong&quot; massacre of 1781 prompted Peckard to speak strongly against slave trade in his sermons, some of which were published as tracts and pamphlets. Peckard set the college on the course of achieving a wider reputation of scholarship and sound thinking, and was later appointed as vice-chancellor of Cambridge University.

Magdalene continued to be a liberal college through the Victorian era. The college had more liberal admissions policies than most, admitting Arthur Cohen, the first practising Jew to graduate from Cambridge. During the same period, Magdalene also admitted Catholic students such as Charles Januarius Acton, and Asian students who were excluded from many other colleges until after the First World War.

===Modern development===

The modern development of Magdalene was shaped by A. C. Benson, master from 1915 to 1925. His enthusiasm and attention to detail produced outstanding pieces of poems, essays and literary criticism; his diaries were also studied by many later critics. His financial generosity effected significant impact on the modern appearance of the college grounds: at least 20 inscriptions around the college refer to him. In 1930, Benson Court was constructed and named after him.

From 1972, the previously all-male colleges in Cambridge started admitting women, the first three being Churchill, Clare and King&#x27;s. In 1985, Oriel College, Oxford, admitted women, making Magdalene the only surviving all-male Oxbridge college. The following year, Magdalene made the decision to admit women and become co-residential. When women joined the college in 1988, some male undergraduates protested by wearing black arm-bands and flying the college flag at half-mast.

===21st century===
Magdalene has an evenly mixed student body in terms of sex, race and education background. In recent years, Magdalene&#x27;s access programme has attracted many applicants from state schools, especially from North West England; and the college&#x27;s close affiliation with international students&#x27; bursaries such as the Prince Philip Scholarship and the Jardine Foundation has attracted many applicants from Southeast Asia, most notably Wong Yan Lung who went on to become Secretary for Justice for Hong Kong.

In October 2022, the new library designed by Niall McLaughlin Architects won the Stirling Prize for excellence in architecture.

The hereditary visitor of the college is Baron Braybrooke &quot;ex officio&quot; as heir of the founder of the college, Lord Audley.

==Buildings and grounds==
Magdalene College is located at the bend of the River Cam on the northwestern side of the town centre, at the foot of Castle Hill. The college was deliberately built on the opposite end of Magdalene Bridge from the town centre so that the Benedictine student-monks would be secluded from the business and temptations of the town. As such, it was the first Cambridge college to be built on the northwestern side of the Cam. The college&#x27;s main site was previously settled during the Roman occupation of England.

The college&#x27;s buildings are distributed on both sides of the river, and is roughly divided into four areas: the main site, where the oldest buildings including the porter&#x27;s lodge and the Pepys Library are located; &quot;The Village&quot;, which was built in the 1930s and consists exclusively of student accommodation; Quayside, built on the southeastern side of the river in the 1980s as an investment project which also provides student accommodation; and Cripps Court, built in the 2000s for extra conference facilities and accommodation.

Magdalene&#x27;s old buildings are representative of the college&#x27;s ramshackle growth from a monks&#x27; foundation into a centre of education. It is also distinctive in that most of the old buildings are in brick rather than stone (save for the frontage of the Pepys Building). Magdalene Street divides the ancient courts from more recent developments. One of the accommodation blocks in the newer part of the college was built by Sir Edwin Lutyens in the early 1930s. Opened in 2005, Cripps Court, on Chesterton Road, features new undergraduate rooms and conference facilities.

===Main site===
The main site of the college is the area bounded by Magdalene Street, Chesterton Lane and the River Cam. It was the original area of college buildings from the 1470s. This area includes Magdalene&#x27;s First Court, Second Court, Fellows&#x27; Garden, and the buildings surrounding them such as the porters&#x27; lodge, the Master&#x27;s Lodge, and the Pepys Library.

====Porters&#x27; lodge and First Court====
Situated on the north-east side of Magdalene Street is the porters&#x27; lodge, where mail to members of the college is delivered and distributed. Past the gatehouse by which the porters&#x27; lodge is situated lies First Court. The First Court was the earliest court to be built. From 1760 the Court was faced with stucco, but most of the buildings were restored in a project between 1953 and 1966. The chapel was the first to be built in around 1470, while the gatehouse including the porters&#x27; lodge and the street-front of the college did not exist until 1585.

The chapel lies in the north range of First Court, and its original construction dates to 1470-72. However, restoration works meant that little of the original chapel other than the original roof remains. Since the college is dedicated to Mary Magdalene, much of the chapel&#x27;s artwork describes her story. The glass windows on the eastern wall of the chapel are dedicated to the encounters between Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ around the time of the crucifixion of Jesus: anointing Jesus with her jug of ointment, watching the crucifixion, weeping at the tomb and recognising Jesus after his resurrection. Compared to most other Cambridge colleges of medieval origin, Magdalene&#x27;s chapel is smaller in line with the college&#x27;s relatively small population. Despite its smaller size, however, the chapel&#x27;s physical proportions are in keeping with those of other medieval Oxbridge college chapels, reflecting the traditional layout of Solomon&#x27;s Temple: the ratio of Magdalene&#x27;s antechapel, choir, and sanctuary (1:4:2) matches that of the Temple&#x27;s porch, holy place, and holy of holies. In 2000, the chapel received a new Baroque-style pipe organ built by Goetze &amp; Gwynn.

Past the chapel, the hall separates the First Court to the west and the Second Court to the east. This is where formal dinners are served. The hall itself was built in the early 16th century, again with many later refurbishments but never gas or electric lighting — Magdalene&#x27;s hall is unique in Oxbridge in relying solely on candlelight. To the far end of the hall is the High Table, placed on a platform one step above ground level, where fellows and their guests dine. Students dine at three long benches in front of and perpendicular to the High Table and spanning to the entrance. Flanking the entrance is a double staircase leading to a minstrels&#x27; gallery and the senior combination room. The walls of the hall are decorated with 15 portraits of notable benefactors and past members.
Both the old and new Master&#x27;s Lodges are located just to the north of First Court. The old Master&#x27;s Lodge, connected to the building in which the porters&#x27; lodge is situated, was built in the 16th century and vacated in 1835. The Master&#x27;s Lodge then moved to a new location about 50m north of the previous location. This new lodge was rebuilt in 1967 to give the Master a less grandiose, but more comfortable residence. The building which was the first Master&#x27;s Lodge is now known as Old Lodge and is predominantly used for student accommodation. A number of senior fellows and students have rooms in the buildings surrounding First Court, including the Bursar, the Senior Tutor, and the Chaplain, as well as the President of the Middle Combination Room, the President of the Junior Combination Room, and the Captain of Boats.

====Second Court and gardens====
Past the formal hall, the Second Court is marked by the Pepys Building, where the Pepys Library is housed. The architect and polymath Robert Hooke, otherwise best known for coining the idea of a biological cell, participated in designing this building in 1677, and construction carried on from then until the 1700s because of the college&#x27;s lack of money. The inscription on the arch in front of the building, &quot;Bibliotheca Pepysiana 1724&quot;, refers to the year in which the Pepys Diary was donated to the college, rather than the year in which the building was completed. Because of the famous Pepys Diary, the Pepys Library became a popular tourist destination in Cambridge. The ground and basement levels of the Pepys Building hosted the college library where undergraduate course books were available. The Pepys Building was constructed in such a way that it would provide a good view of the Fellows&#x27; Garden. Construction of a new College Library began in 2018; the new building, designed by Niall McLaughlin Architects, offers three times more space.
Also situated on Second Court is Bright&#x27;s Building, named after Mynors Bright, notable for having deciphered the Pepys Diary. It was built in 1908–09 by Aston Webb to provide extra accommodation to host increasing numbers of undergraduate students. The largest room in Bright&#x27;s Building is Ramsay Hall, named after Allen Beville Ramsay. The room was intended to be a lecture room, but it was refurbished in 1949 to become the college&#x27;s canteen.

The Fellows&#x27; Garden, situated behind Pepys Building, included a Roman-era flood barrier bank which became today&#x27;s Monk&#x27;s Walk, a raised footpath leading from the south side of Pepys Building to the exit of the Fellows&#x27; Garden on Chesterton Lane. At the time of the college&#x27;s establishment in 1428, the Fellows&#x27; Garden was a series of fishponds. The fishponds were filled between 1586 and 1609, but it was not until the 1660s that plans to cultivate a garden on the land were realised. Most of the trees planted in the original plan of the garden were chopped down and replaced in a renovation in the early 1900s, under the instruction of botanist Walter Gardiner. Many of the newly planted trees were black poplars and its variant, Lombardy poplars. Some fruit trees, such as quince, cherry and plum trees, were planted in the 1980s-90s. Squirrels, and the occasional woodpecker may be spotted in the garden; there are also a few flowerbeds in the garden in which the gardeners grow seasonal flowers. Near the northwest corner of the Fellows&#x27; Garden lies a Victorian pet cemetery with several gravestones and statues of departed dogs and cats of the College.

Adjacent to the Fellows&#x27; Garden are two other gardens: the Master&#x27;s Garden, which is part of the Master&#x27;s Lodge and separated from the Fellows&#x27; Garden by a brick wall, and the River Court, a small, brick-paved patch of land between Bright&#x27;s Building and the River Cam, where seasonal flowers are on display in the flowerbeds.

===Village===
The area of the college across Magdalene Street from porter&#x27;s lodge, bounded by Magdalene Street, Northampton Street, the River Cam and St John&#x27;s College is known as the Magdalene Village. It includes Benson Court, Mallory Court and Buckingham Court, and consists almost exclusively of student accommodation. The area of the Village was developed over a period of 45 years by three architects, Harry Redfern, Sir Edwin Lutyens and David Roberts. The first building to be developed was Mallory Court B (1925–26) and the last was the new Buckingham Court building (1968–70). Lutyens had an original plan which involved demolishing many existing buildings in the area and constructing new buildings that matched the general look and feel of the college&#x27;s main site, but this plan was scrapped due to insufficient funding and the only part of Lutyens&#x27; plan that was realised was the Lutyens building.

Passing through an obscure wooden gate opposite the porter&#x27;s lodge, the open courtyard of Benson Court can be seen. Benson Court was named after A. C. Benson, master of Magdalene College from 1915 to 1925. Benson was best known for writing the lyrics of &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;, a British patriotic song set to the tune of Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1&quot;. The cottages to either side of the entrance pathway are all pre-existing buildings that were converted into student accommodation in the 1960s. In particular, Benson Court H is one of the few buildings in college whose structure survived from the 16th century, and presents its 17th-century facade which was previously known as Cross Keys Inn to the street front of Magdalene Street. To the left of the courtyard is a gentle grassy slope where the college punts are moored and parties are held in the summer.

Across the courtyard is the Lutyens building, also designated Benson A-E, which was built and named after Sir Edwin Lutyens, the architect who planned much of the Village. Due to a lack of funding, it was the only part of Lutyens&#x27; original grandiose plan that was built. Part of the building&#x27;s cost was sponsored by subscriptions raised by Harvard in memory of Henry Dunster, who studied in Magdalene in 1627–1630 and became a founding father of Harvard University. Hence, the crest of Harvard with the inscription &quot;Veritas&quot; can be found at the entrance to the D staircase. Each staircase in the building had slightly different banister designs, which Lutyens explained was &quot;to help Magdalene men to feel in the dark whether they were entering the correct staircase&quot;. The Lutyens building currently hosts about 60 students and fellows as well as the college launderette.

Another two courts can be found to the northwest of Benson Court: Mallory Court and Buckingham Court. Mallory Court was named after George Mallory, the British mountaineer who famously answered &quot;Because it&#x27;s there&quot; when asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. The court itself comprises student rooms, some new and some converted from existing buildings which include a defunct brewery. Buckingham Court has two groups of buildings, which includes the &quot;Tan Yard Cottages&quot; incorporated to the college and refurbished in 1966, and a new building which contains the college&#x27;s car park. The new Buckingham building, completed in 1970, marked the completion of the Magdalene Village.

===Quayside===

Most of the buildings bounded by the River Cam, Bridge Street and Thompson&#x27;s Lane are owned by Magdalene College, despite being covered by shop-fronts and restaurants on the ground level. Many of these buildings are part of the Quayside development project, built between 1983 and 1989, as part of a business plan of the college. As for student accommodation, this part of the college includes the Bridge Street and Thompson&#x27;s Lane hostels.

===Cripps Court===
Cripps Court is situated on the opposite side of Chesterton Road from the main site of the college. It was built between 2003 and 2005 in response to increasing demands for extra accommodation and conference facilities. The site of Cripps Court is a natural southerly slope, which can be seen from the stepped courtyard in between the buildings. The court was sponsored by, and named after, the Cripps family headed by Humphrey Cripps. It contains a 142-seat auditorium, 5 seminar rooms, an oak-roofed event gallery also called the orangery, and about 60 student rooms.

===New Library===

Officially opened on 2 July 2022, the New Library is the first library building constructed by Magdalene for 330 years and is situated in the western corner of the Fellows&#x27; Garden. Designed by Níall McLaughlin Architects, it won the RIBA Stirling Prize in 2022 for its architectural achievements, the first Oxbridge building to receive this accolade. It holds the College&#x27;s books for undergraduate and postgraduate use, and it provides more than 90 study spaces across three floors with views of the Fellows&#x27; Garden and the River Cam. There is also a group study room, social space, and an archive. The Robert Cripps Gallery provides gallery space for visiting exhibitions and for displaying parts of the College art collection to the wider community.

==Events and traditions==
Magdalene is noted for its &#x27;traditional&#x27; style: it boasts a well-regarded candlelit formal hall (held every evening) and was the last all-male college in Oxford or Cambridge to admit women in 1988 (Oriel College was the last in Oxford, admitting women in 1986).

===Spelling and pronunciation of name===
The college is officially known as &quot;The College of Saint Mary Magdalene&quot;, with &quot;Magdalene&quot; customarily pronounced &quot;Maudlyn&quot; ( ). The name was chosen when Thomas Audley re-founded and dedicated the college to Mary Magdalene in 1542. In early documents, the name of the college was spelt &quot;Maudleyn&quot; as it was pronounced. Although the standard pronunciation of the name &quot;Magdalene&quot; in the English language has changed, the customary pronunciation of the college&#x27;s name was retained.

With the development of the General Post Office during the 19th century, the spelling of the college&#x27;s name was fixed as &quot;Magdalene&quot; with a final &quot;e&quot;, to avoid confusion with Magdalen College, Oxford. The two colleges are pronounced the same.

==People associated with Magdalene==

===Masters===
Master of Magdalene College is the title given to the Head of House. Rowan Williams, former Archbishop of Canterbury (2002–12), became the master on 1 January 2013. Sir Christopher Greenwood succeeded Williams as master of Magdalene on 1 October 2020.

Power to appoint the master was vested until 2012 in the visitor of the college, an hereditary title of the heir of the founder, Lord Audley (now Baron Braybrooke). Following an amendment to the college statutes, which was approved by the Queen in Council in February 2012, the master is now appointed by the governing body of the college. The master usually serves until reaching the statutory fellowship retirement age of 67. Exceptionally, this period may be extended until the master in question reaches 70 as occurred in the case of Duncan Robinson, master from 2002 to 2012.

With the position of master comes college-based residency in the form of the Master&#x27;s Lodge, which may be populated and decorated according to the wishes of the master. Traditionally, every Sunday, the master attends the service in the college chapel before sitting at the head of the high table in hall for formal hall.

<text>Polydor Limited, also known as Polydor Records, is a German-British record label that operates as part of Universal Music Group. It has a close relationship with Universal&#x27;s Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records label, which distributes Polydor&#x27;s releases in the United States. In turn, Polydor distributes Interscope releases in the United Kingdom. Polydor Records Ltd. was established in London in 1954 as a British subsidiary of German company Deutsche Grammophon/Schallplatte Grammophon GmbH. It was renamed Polydor Ltd. in 1972. The company is usually mentioned as &quot;Polydor Ltd. (UK)&quot;, or a similar form, for holding copyrights.

Notable current and past artists signed to the label include Rainbow, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Yngwie J. Malmsteen, the Cure, James Brown, Ray, Goodman &amp; Brown, Atlanta Rhythm Section, John Mayall, Deep Purple, Cream, the Moody Blues, the Who, Jimi Hendrix, Bee Gees, Lana Del Rey, Stephen Fretwell, the Jam, Style Council, the Shadows, James Last, Eric Clapton, Gloria Gaynor, Level 42, Sam Fender, S Club, Girls Aloud and Ellie Goulding.

==Label history==
===Beginnings===
Polydor Records was founded on 2 April 1913 by German Polyphon-Musikwerke AG in Leipzig and registered on 25 July 1914 (Nr. 316613). The label was founded as Firma Brachhausen &amp; Riesener in 1887 by Gustav Adolf Brachhausen and Ernst Paul Riessner, for manufacturing their new mechanical disc-playing music box Polyphon, invented in 1870. During World War I on 24 April 1917, Polyphon-Musikwerke AG acquired the German Deutsche Grammophon-Aktiengesellschaft record plant and company from the German government. The German state had taken over British-held Grammophon as enemy property during World War I.
Polydor was originally an independent branch of the Polyphon-Grammophon-Konzern group. It was used as an export label from 1924. After the British and German branches of the Gramophone Company were separated during World War I, Deutsche Grammophon claimed the rights to the Nipper-dog and gramophone trademark for Germany, where HMV recordings were to be released under the Electrola trademark replacing the company lost during the war. In turn, Deutsche Grammophon records exported from Germany were released on the Polyphon Musik and Polydor labels. New foreign branches were founded, for example in Austria, Denmark, Sweden and France.

In 1941, Deutsche Grammophon (including Polydor) was purchased by Siemens &amp; Halske. Polydor became a popular music label in 1946, while the new Deutsche Grammophon Gesellschaft label became a classical music label in 1949. The previously used label, Grammophon, was disbanded. DGG gave, by an agreement dated 5 July 1949, an exclusive license from 1 July 1951 to use the Nipper-dog with gramophone to the original owner&#x27;s company Electrola, the German branch of EMI. (In Germany, it was impossible to sell the trademark without selling the company.) Polydor remained Deutsche Grammophon&#x27;s export label, including classical music, in France and the Spanish-speaking world for the remainder of the long-playing era, as a result of language and cultural concerns. DGG established a subsidiary in London called Polydor Records Ltd. in 1954.

In the early 1960s, orchestra leader Bert Kaempfert signed unknowns Tony Sheridan and The Beatles, credited as &quot;The Beat Brothers&quot;, to Polydor. Popular International entertainers such as James Last, Bert Kaempfert, Kurt Edelhagen, Caterina Valente and the Kessler Twins appeared on the Polydor label, as well as many French, Spanish and Latin-American figures.

Siemens entered into a joint venture with Philips in 1962 creating the Grammophon-Philips Group, of which Polydor became a subsidiary label. Throughout the late 1960s, Polydor released albums of John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers, Cream, The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Bee Gees and Eric Clapton.

Polydor opened a US branch in 1969 (in years prior, they licensed their catalogue to Atlantic Records), but did not become a real presence in the US record industry until its purchase of the recording contract and back catalogue of R&amp;B performer James Brown in 1971, and the absorption of the MGM Records label by its parent company PolyGram in 1972.

In 1970, Polydor acquired the Hong Kong–based Diamond Records, which had been owned and founded by the local Portuguese merchant Ren da Silva in the late 1950s.

===PolyGram===

In 1972, the Grammophon-Philips Group (GPG) reorganised to create PolyGram, from Polydor and PhonoGram. The &quot;Polydor&quot; label continued to run as a subsidiary label under the new company. Throughout the 1970s, Polydor Incorporated became a major rock label, also releasing records by hit makers such as the Bee Gees, Gloria Gaynor, Atlanta Rhythm Section and Ray, Goodman &amp; Brown.

Into the 1980s, Polydor continued to do respectable business, in spite of becoming increasingly overshadowed by its PolyGram sister label Mercury Records. Polydor took over management of British Decca&#x27;s pop catalogue. A&amp;R manager Frank Neilson was able to score a major top ten hit in March 1981 for the label with &quot;Do the Hucklebuck&quot; by Coast to Coast as well as signing Ian Dury and Billy Fury to the company. In 1984, the company name was parodied in the rockumentary film &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; (whose soundtrack album was distributed by Polydor), where &quot;Polymer Records&quot; was the band&#x27;s record company.

By the early 1990s, Polydor had begun to underperform. PolyGram subsequently trimmed most of Polydor&#x27;s staff and roster, and shifted it to operate under the umbrella of PolyGram Label Group (PLG), a newly constructed &quot;super label&quot; specifically designed to oversee the operations of PolyGram&#x27;s lesser performing imprints, which included Island Records, London Records, Atlas Records and Verve Records at the time.

In 1994, as Island Records recovered from its sales slump, PolyGram dissolved most of PLG into it. Meanwhile, Polydor Records and Atlas Records merged, briefly called &quot;Polydor/Atlas&quot;, and began operating through A&amp;M Records, another PolyGram subsidiary. In 1995, Polydor/Atlas became simply Polydor Records again.

=== Twilight years in the United States ===

Over the next few years, Polydor tried to keep itself afloat with new artist signings, new releases, and reissues, while still becoming more and more dormant. In 1998, PolyGram was purchased by Seagram and absorbed into its Universal Music Group. During the consolidation of these two music giants, Polydor&#x27;s United States operations were folded into Interscope-Geffen-A&amp;M and Universal Records, while its overseas branch remained intact, with its records continuing to be distributed domestically through Interscope and A&amp;M.

Today, in North America, the Polydor Records name and logo is mostly used on reissues of older material from its 1960s and 1970s heyday. Island Records handles the US distribution of most pre-1998 Polydor releases, including the reissues from the British Decca pop/rock collections, while Republic Records handles reissues from James Brown and the MGM Records and Verve Records pop catalog. However, starting in the 2010s, Interscope Records has been signing acts such as Azealia Banks and Lana Del Rey jointly to Polydor and its logo has been seen on both releases.

==Polydor Nashville==
Record producer Harold Shedd founded Polydor&#x27;s Nashville, Tennessee, division in 1994, which specialised in country music. Among the acts signed to Polydor Nashville were Shane Sutton, Tasha Harris, 4 Runner, the Moffatts, Chely Wright, Mark Luna, Clinton Gregory, Amie Comeaux, along with Toby Keith and Davis Daniel, who transferred from Mercury Nashville in 1994. The Nashville division was renamed A&amp;M Nashville in March 1996 and closed in September of the same year, as PolyGram consolidated all its Nashville operations under the Mercury name. Today, Polydor, along with EMI Records in the UK and Australia and UMG itself in Canada distribute Lost Highway Records&#x27; albums in the Commonwealth realms.

==Polydor UK==
In 1972, the British Polydor Records Ltd. was renamed to Polydor Ltd. In the early 1970s, the main source of income for the label was the successful UK band Slade as well as the New Seekers and the Who. At the time, between the 1970s and 1980s, the Polydor/PolyGram Senior VP (who was originally the first head of their new at the time rock department) was Jerry Jaffe, who also signed acts such as Motörhead, Dexys Midnight Runners, and the Jam. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the label was home to the Who and the Jam (as well as its successor act the Style Council). Jaffe also interacted with many famous and successful artists while in his position, including Nick Lowe and John Lennon, as well as going on to work with groups such as the Jesus and Mary Chain and Saint Etienne in the late 1980s and 1990s. 

Although Polydor&#x27;s American branch is nearly inactive, in the United Kingdom Polydor remains one of the most prominent labels in the country—with artists such as Take That, Cheryl, Duffy, Girls Aloud, S Club, the Saturdays, Kaiser Chiefs, Ellie Goulding, Mabel and Lawson. Polydor also has a strong indie roster through the Fiction imprint with acts such as Ian Brown, Bright Eyes, Elbow, Stephen Fretwell, White Lies, Kate Nash, Snow Patrol, Filthy Dukes, and Crystal Castles. Polydor has also survived in Canada, becoming the home label for Drake. It also acts as the UK label for American-based acts under Interscope-Geffen-A&amp;M such as Eminem, the All-American Rejects, the Black Eyed Peas, Billie Eilish, Camila Cabello, Gwen Stefani, Dr. Dre, Lana Del Rey, Lady Gaga, Olivia Rodrigo, Selena Gomez and Sting.

In 2006, Polydor launched Fascination Records, a music label dedicated to pop music. Both Girls Aloud and Sophie Ellis-Bextor transferred to the new label and created groups such as the Saturdays and Girls Can&#x27;t Catch. Several pop acts from US label Hollywood Records, such as Demi Lovato, Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus, and Selena Gomez &amp; the Scene were also signed to Fascination.

In 2008, A&amp;M Records UK was founded as an imprint of Polydor UK. The same year, Polydor obtained distribution of the Rolling Stones&#x27; back catalogue as well as new releases. With the establishment of A&amp;M Records UK, A&amp;M Records&#x27; Canadian division became a separate entity for the first time since the formation of Universal Music Group. Polydor, meanwhile, continued to distribute Interscope, Geffen and selected Lost Highway releases in Canada through Universal Music Canada, as it does to this day.

Polydor UK rejected British singer-songwriter Raye&#x27;s album &quot;My 21st Century Blues&quot; and one of its lead singles, &quot;Escapism&quot; for release under the label, leading her to release the former independently. At the 2024 Brit Awards, Raye received 6 awards, all for works released with labels other than Polydor, breaking the record for the most nominations received by a single artist in a year.

== Polydor Japan ==
In December 2022, Universal Music Japan reorganized Universal J, which previously was known as Universal Polydor until 2002. The label was split into two record labels, UJ and Polydor Records. The changes took place on 1 January 2023.

Polydor&#x27;s Japanese division has three sub-labels which are Perfume Records, Asse!! Records (HY&#x27;s exclusive label), and Utahime Records (Akina Nakamori&#x27;s exclusive label). It also has distribution rights for NHK Records.

The first release under Polydor in Japan was &#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Hiiragi&quot;.

<doc id="201372" wikidata="Q782618" url="?curid=201372" title="Monotrematum">
<text>Monotrematum sudamericanum is an extinct monotreme species from the Paleocene (Peligran) Salamanca Formation in Patagonia, Argentina. It is one of only two monotremes found outside Oceania.

==Taxonomy==
A species described in 1992 and assigned to a new genus Monotrematum as the type. It is currently the only known species of the genus. The authors compared their fossil material to the genus &quot;Obdurodon&quot;, ornithorhynchid species first discovered at Australian fossil sites in 1975. It is considered to possibly be a stem-ornithorhynchid, although this is uncertain given that several divergence estimates have found the family to be significantly younger.

==Description==
&quot;Monotrematum sudamericanum&quot; is known only from two lower and one upper platypus-like teeth. It is the only known non-Australasian ornithorhynchid. The main difference, apart from continent and age, is its size: the teeth of &quot;Monotrematum&quot; are around twice as large as those of other similar species in the related genus &quot;Obdurodon&quot;. The teeth of &quot;M. sudamericanum&quot; presently reside in the collections of Museo de La Plata and Museo Paleontológico Egidio Feruglio, both in Argentina.

According to Pascual, &quot;The preserved enamel in the central region shows that the crown pattern is almost identical to that of &quot;Obdurodon&quot;: it is composed of two V-shaped lobes, the anterior of which is wider, separated from the posterior one by a valley that connects the lingual and buccal sides of the crown separating the anterior and posterior lobes.&quot;

<doc id="201373" wikidata="Q350582" url="?curid=201373" title="Adam Osborne">
<text>Adam Osborne (6 March 1939 – 18 March 2003) was a British author, software publisher, and computer designer who founded several companies in the United States and elsewhere. He introduced the Osborne 1, the first commercially successful portable computer.

== Early life ==
Osborne was born to British parents in Bangkok, Thailand on 6 March 1939. His father, Arthur Osborne, was a teacher of eastern religion and philosophy and a lecturer in English at Chulalongkorn University. All members of the family were fluent in the Tamil language. He spent World War II in Tiruvannamalai, in southern India, with his mother. There they were frequent visitors to Sri Ramana Maharshi&#x27;s Ashram He attended Presentation Convent School in Kodaikanal until Class 6. In 1950, the Osborne family moved back to England. From the age of 11, he was educated at a Catholic boarding school in Warwickshire but from 1954 to 1957 was a pupil at the grammar school Leamington College for Boys, where he played chess. He graduated with a degree in chemical engineering from the University of Birmingham in 1961, and received his PhD from the University of Delaware in 1968. It was while living in the United States that he learned to write computer code. He obtained a position as a chemical engineer with Shell Oil, in California, but was dismissed.

== Publishing ==
Osborne was a pioneer in the computer book field, founding a company in 1972 that specialized in easy-to-read computer manuals. By 1977, Osborne &amp; Associates had 40 titles in its catalogue. In 1979, it was bought by McGraw-Hill and continued as an imprint of McGraw-Hill, &quot;Osborne/McGraw-Hill&quot;. He also wrote several books. One of them, &quot;An Introduction To Microcomputers&quot;, sold 300,000 copies.

== Computers ==

Osborne was known to frequent the Homebrew Computer Club&#x27;s meetings around 1975. He created the first commercially available portable computer, the Osborne 1, released in April 1981. It weighed 24.5 pounds (12 kg), cost US$1795—just over half the cost of a computer from other manufacturers with comparable features—and ran the popular CP/M 2.2 operating system. It was designed to fit under an airline seat. At its peak, Osborne Computer Corporation shipped 10,000 units of &quot;Osborne 1&quot; per month. Osborne was one of the first personal computing pioneers to understand fully that there was a wide market of buyers who were not computing hobbyists: the Osborne 1 included word processing and spreadsheet software. This was at a time when IBM would not bundle hardware and software with their PCs, selling separately the operating systems, monitors, and even cables for the monitor.

Adam Osborne&#x27;s experience in the computer industry gave his new company credibility. Osborne Computer Corporation advertisements compared Adam Osborne&#x27;s influence on the personal computer market to Henry Ford&#x27;s influence on transportation. It is said that in 1983, Osborne bragged about two advanced new computers his company was developing. These statements destroyed consumer demand for the Osborne 1, and the resulting inventory glut forced Osborne Computer to file for bankruptcy on 13 September 1983. This phenomenon, a pre-announcement of a new product causing a catastrophic collapse in demand for older ones, became known as the Osborne effect, but according to some new sources, the real reasons for Osborne Computer&#x27;s bankruptcy were management errors and insufficient cash flow.

===Hypergrowth===
After Osborne Computer&#x27;s collapse, Adam Osborne wrote a best-selling memoir of his experience, &quot;Hypergrowth: The Rise and Fall of the Osborne Computer Corporation&quot;, with John C. Dvorak, which was published in 1984.

== Software ==

In 1984, Osborne founded Paperback Software International Ltd., a company that specialized in inexpensive computer software. Its advertisements featured Osborne himself, arguing that if telephone companies applied the same logic to their pricing as software companies, a telephone would cost $600. One of its products was VP-Planner, an inexpensive clone of Lotus 1-2-3, which led to legal action. In 1987, Lotus sued Paperback Software. As a result of the lawsuit, consumer confidence waned for Paperback Software, and its revenues dropped 80% by 1989, preventing the firm from getting venture capital for expansion. In February 1990, the case went to court and on 28 June, the court ruled that Paperback Software&#x27;s product, by copying Lotus 1-2-3&#x27;s look and feel menu interface, violated Lotus&#x27;s copyright. Osborne stepped down from Paperback Software the same year. Paperback&#x27;s database application, VP-Info continued to sell well for many more years, and acquired a second life as Sharkbase.

His final venture, in 1992, was to found the company Noetics Software, to work on artificial intelligence.
==Personal life and death==

Osborne was a member of Mensa. He married – and divorced – twice, firstly in the mid-1960s, to Cynthia Geddes, an American, and later to Barbara Burdick (Zelnick). Osborne had three children. Both former wives and all his children survived him.

In 1992, Osborne returned to India in declining health, suffering from a brain disorder that triggered frequent minor strokes. He died in his sleep on 18 March 2003, in Kodaikanal, India, aged 64.

<text>Deutsche Grammophon (; DGG) is a German classical music record label that was the precursor of the corporation PolyGram. Headquartered in Berlin Friedrichshain, it is now part of Universal Music Group (UMG) since its merger with the UMG family of labels in 1999. Deutsche Grammophon is the world&#x27;s oldest surviving established record company. Presidents of the company are Frank Briegmann, Chairman and CEO Central Europe of Universal Music Group and Clemens Trautmann.

==History==

Deutsche Grammophon Gesellschaft was founded in 1898 by German-born United States citizen Emile Berliner as the German branch of his Berliner Gramophone Company. Berliner sent his nephew Joseph Sanders from America to set up operations. Based in the city of Hanover (the founder&#x27;s birthplace), the company became a fully owned subsidiary of the Gramophone Company Ltd. in 1900 and an affiliate of the US Victor Talking Machine Company. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the company seceded from the Gramophone Company. Though no longer affiliated with Gramophone Company and Victor, Deutsche Grammophon retained the &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; trademark featuring Nipper the dog for use in Germany until the late 1940s; for several years following its secession, the company even continued selling recordings made from pre-war matrices owned by the Gramophone Company and Victor.

In 1941, Deutsche Grammophon was purchased by Siemens &amp; Halske. In 1949, Deutsche Grammophon sold the German rights of the His Master&#x27;s Voice trademark to the Electrola unit of EMI. The dog and gramophone were replaced by the crown of tulips, designed by Siemens advertising consultant Hans Domizlaff. The distinctive yellow cartouche banner, occupying almost a third of each recording&#x27;s cover, first appeared in 1957 and was a staple of the majority of its full-price recordings until the early years of the 21st century, when it all but disappeared from new releases. It has since enjoyed something of a revival in newer recordings.

In 1962, Siemens formed a joint venture with Netherlands-based Philips to create the DGG/PPI Record Group, which became PolyGram Records in 1972. By this time, DGG had built a reputation for high-quality recording in the classical field as well as a notable roster of contracted singers, musicians, and conductors. Through its subsidiary label Archiv Produktion it also stimulated interest in Western medieval and renaissance music, 15th – 16th century choral polyphony, Gregorian chant, and pioneering use of &quot;historical instruments&quot; and performance practices in recordings.

DGG/Polydor&#x27;s entrance into the US market in 1969 (DGG had previous been distributed in the US by Decca and MGM Records) came at a time when the leading US classical music labels RCA Victor Red Seal and Columbia Masterworks were dropping most of their unlucrative classical artists and pressing inferior quality records. DGG&#x27;s high quality recordings and pressings attracted artists such as Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra (who had recorded for RCA Victor since 1935) and Leonard Bernstein (after several years with Columbia) to DGG/Polydor. In 1987, Siemens sold off its interest in PolyGram, and Philips became the majority shareholder. In 1998, the Seagram company of Canada purchased Deutsche Grammophon and PolyGram on behalf of its Universal Music Group subsidiary. Since then, UMG was sold and became a division of Vivendi until its IPO in September 2021.

Deutsche Grammophon pioneered the introduction of the compact disc to the mass market, debuting classical music performed by Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic for sale in the new medium in 1983, the first recording being Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Eine Alpensinfonie&quot;.

Deutsche Grammophon has a huge back catalogue of notable recordings. The company was reissuing a portion of it in its &quot;Originals&quot; series; compact disc releases are noted for their vinyl record stylized design. It is also releasing some of American Decca Records&#x27; albums from the 1940s and 1950s, such as those that Leonard Bernstein made for Decca in 1953, and the classic Christmas album that features Ronald Colman&#x27;s starring in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; and Charles Laughton&#x27;s narrating &quot;Mr. Pickwick&#x27;s Christmas&quot;. Along with the American Decca Records classical music catalogue, Deutsche Grammophon also manages the classical music catalogue of ABC Records, including Westminster Records which, along with American Decca, were part of MCA Records.

Although Deutsche Grammophon acquired the reputation of releasing mainstream classical recordings, from the 1960s onwards it released an increasing number of avant-garde recordings (initially under the Avant-Garde imprint), including Bruno Maderna, David Bedford, Cornelius Cardew, Luigi Nono and improvisations. It also released the majority of the compositions of Karlheinz Stockhausen until the composer bought the rights to the recordings and re-released them on his own label. Other German composers associated with the label included Paul Hindemith and Hans Werner Henze.

Contemporary composers whose works were released by Deutsche Grammophon include Hildur Guðnadóttir, Sofia Gubaidulina, Oliver Knussen, Mark-Anthony Turnage, Mohammed Fairouz, Péter Eötvös, Luigi Nono, Sven Helbig, Jonny Greenwood, Bryce Dessner, Witold Lutosławski, Philip Glass, Vangelis, Tori Amos and Max Richter.

The conductor most associated with the label is Herbert von Karajan. Other conductors under contract included Ferenc Fricsay, Carlos Kleiber, Karl Böhm, Karl Richter, Eugen Jochum, Rafael Kubelík, Leonard Bernstein, Pierre Boulez, Claudio Abbado, and Christian Thielemann. Recent signings include Long Yu, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, Gustavo Dudamel, Hera Hyesang Park, and Myung-whun Chung.

The label&#x27;s &quot;&quot; series features electronic adaptations of classical works.

<text>Obdurodon is a genus of extinct platypus-like Australian monotreme which lived from the Late Oligocene to the Late Miocene. Three species have been described in the genus, the type species Obdurodon insignis, plus Obdurodon dicksoni and Obdurodon tharalkooschild. The species appeared much like their modern day relative the platypus, except adults retained their molar teeth, and unlike the platypus, which forages on the lakebed, they may have foraged in the water column or surface.

== Taxonomy ==
The &quot;Obdurodon insignis&quot; holotype specimen, SAM P18087, a tooth, was uncovered in 1971 from the Etadunna Formation in the Tirari Desert of South Australia. The second specimen discovered there, AMNH 97228, is an upper right molar. In total, 4 specimens are reported, dating from the Oligocene to the Pliocene.

The holotype tooth was placed into the newly erected genus &quot;Obdurodon&quot; upon description in 1975 by American palaeontologists Michael O. Woodburne and Richard H. Tedford. They named the genus from the Latin &quot;&quot; &quot;persist&quot; and the Greek &quot;&quot; (&quot;odṓn&quot;) &quot;tooth&quot;, in reference to the permanency of the molars, a feature which is lost in the modern platypus. The species name &quot;insignis&quot; &quot;remarkable&quot; refers to the importance of the new taxon&#x27;s &quot;distinguishing mark&quot; in the fossil record.

The genus is one of several to have been placed with the family Ornithorhynchidae, whose only living member is the platypus.

The second species named, &quot;Obdurodon dicksoni&quot;, occasionally called the Riversleigh Platypus, was described by Archer &quot;et al&quot; (1992) who detailed a skull and several teeth found in lower-middle Miocene deposits from the Riversleigh Ringtail Site. The type specimen, an exceptionally well preserved skull, is one of the most intact fossil skulls to be excavated from Riversleigh. The type locality is referred to as the Ringtail Site. Other than the skull and teeth, no other fossilized material of &quot;O. dicksoni&quot; has been identified.

The third known species, &quot;Obdurodon tharalkooschild&quot; is the second species described from the Riversleigh sites, and the largest species. The holotype tooth was discovered in 2012 at the &quot;Two Trees Site&quot;, part of Riversleigh&#x27;s Gag Plateau sequence, and dated to the Miocene though dates as young as the Pliocene have been suggested. The species was described the following year by a team from the University of New South Wales including Rebecca Pian, Mike Archer, and Suzanne Hand, who published the article in the &quot;Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology&quot;.

The specific name was chosen in honour of an indigenous Australian creation story for the platypus, where a duck named Tharalkoo gives birth to a chimeric creature after being ravished by a rakali.

==Description==
&quot;Obdurodon&quot; differed from the modern platypus in that they had more permanent dentition in the spoon-shaped bill, retaining molars and incisors. The species may have foraged in the water column or surface.

===&quot;Obdurodon insignis&quot;===
&quot;O. insignis&quot; is thought to have had a similar build to the modern platypus. The holotype is the front molar of the upper right jaw, corresponding to the M2 molar, with the unusual character of six roots. Fragments of jawbone have also been assigned to the species, along with a single piece of post-cranial material, a pelvis. &quot;O. insignis&quot; had one more canine tooth (NC1) than its ancestor &quot;Steropodon galmani&quot;.

===&quot;Obdurodon dicksoni&quot;===
&quot;Obdurodon dicksoni&quot; was part of the Riversleigh fauna that inhabited pools and streams of freshwater of the Riversleigh rainforest environment. Unlike the modern species, &quot;O. dicksoni&quot; was a large animal that retained its molars into adulthood and had a spoon-shaped bill. The skull&#x27;s profile is comparatively flatter than similar species, and as with crocodilians, this may indicate more foraging or feeding at the surface of the water. The diet is likely to have been crustaceans, the water-borne larvae of insects, or perhaps small vertebrates like fish and frogs. The only known area of its distribution, the Riversleigh site, was closed forest at the freshwater bodies it inhabited, surrounded by more open woodlands over the region&#x27;s limestone karst terrain.

The septomaxilla (a part of the upper jawbone) of &quot;O. dicksoni&quot; is bigger than for the platypus, which supposes a hypertrophied beak. The coronoid and angulary processes of &quot;O. dicksoni&quot; have quite disappeared in the platypus, leaving the platypus&#x27;s skull flat on the sides. This indicates the mastication technique of &quot;O. dicksoni&quot; was different from that of the platypus, using the muscles anchored to these processes. The beak of &quot;O. dicksoni&quot; has an oval hole surrounded by bones in the center, whereas the platypus&#x27; beak has a V-shape and no longer surrounded by bones. &quot;O. dicksoni&quot; retained molar teeth into adulthood, whereas in the modern platypus, the adults only have keratinized pads (juveniles lose their molar teeth upon adulthood). The shape of its beak suggests that &quot;O. dicksoni&quot; sought prey by digging in the sides of rivers, whereas the modern platypus digs in the bottom of the river. &quot;O. dicksoni&quot; had (like the platypus) shearing crests instead of incisor and canine teeth. It bore two premolars and three molars on each side of the lower jaw. The M1 had six roots, the M2 had five, and the M3 only one. The upper jaw bore two premolars and two molars on each side. The M1 had six roots, the M2 four. The premolars had only one root and a very different shape from the molars. They were separated from the shearing crests by an area without dentition. The roots of the molars were barely a third as high as the crown. Molars had only been found apart from skulls, implying that they were not well-anchored.

===&quot;Obdurodon tharalkooschild&quot;===

&quot;Obdurodon tharalkooschild&quot; is assumed to be very similar in form to a modern platypus, but larger, exceeding &quot;Monotrematum&quot; in size and length. and lived in the middle to late Miocene (). The wear patterns on the tooth are suggestive of crushing, perhaps by consuming hard-shelled animals such as turtles, rather than using a shearing action.
&quot;O. tharalkooschild&quot; is thought to have inhabited fresh water and hunted for a variety of animal prey in the forests that dominated the Riversleigh site at the time of deposition. The species diet is assumed to have included crustacea like those consumed by the modern platypus, although larger species were available due to its greater size. The potential prey of the Riversleigh fauna also included frog, turtle, fish and the lungfish, species that are present in the deposition at the Two Tree Site of the Riversleigh formations. The ornithorhynchid species were unknown in the later fossil record at the time of discovery, and it defied the assumptions of a single lineage of a platypus-like animal that progressively lost its teeth and became smaller.

The name given to &quot;O. tharalkooschild&quot; was first discussed in a 1990 paper by Mike Archer, an Australian mammalogist, detailing a creation story with an Ugly Duckling motif in the context of palaeontology. A philosophical examination of historical sciences such as palaeontology, published in 2018, uses the tooth of this platypus as an example of the results obtainable by multiple methods of research into traces of evidence; the author refers to the species by the vernacular &quot;platyzilla&quot;. An illustration of &quot;O. dicksoni&quot; by Jeanette Muirhead, depicted on a rock in a stream within a rainforest, was published by the magazine &quot;Natural History&quot; (AMNH) in 1994.

<text>is a Japanese term describing modern Japanese martial arts. Literally translated it means the &quot;Martial Way&quot;, and may be thought of as the &quot;Way of War&quot; or the &quot;Way of Martial Arts&quot;.

==Etymology==
Budō is a compound of the root &quot;bu&quot; (:ぶ; wǔ in Chinese), meaning &quot;war&quot; or &quot;martial&quot;; and &quot;dō&quot; (:どう; &quot;dào&quot; in Chinese), incorporating the character above for head and below for foot, meaning the unification of mind and body &quot;path&quot; or &quot;way&quot; (including the ancient Indic Dharmic and Buddhist conception of &quot;path&quot;, or &quot;mārga&quot; in Sanskrit). 
Budō is the idea of formulating propositions, subjecting them to philosophical critique and then following a &quot;path&quot; to realize them. &quot;Dō&quot; signifies a &quot;way of life&quot;. &quot;Dō&quot; in the Japanese context is an experiential term in the sense that practice (the way of life) is the norm to verify the validity of the discipline cultivated through a given art form. Modern budō has no external enemy, only the internal one: the ego that must be fought.

Similarly to budō, &quot;bujutsu&quot; is a compound of the roots &quot;bu&quot; (武), and &quot;jutsu&quot; (術:じゅつ), meaning technique. Thus, budō is translated as &quot;martial way&quot;, or &quot;the way of war&quot; while &quot;bujutsu&quot; is translated as &quot;science of war&quot; or &quot;martial craft.&quot; However, both budō and &quot;bujutsu&quot; are used interchangeably in English with the term &quot;martial arts&quot;. Budo and bujutsu have quite a delicate difference; whereas bujutsu only gives attention to the physical part of fighting (how to best defeat an enemy), budo also gives attention to the mind and how one should develop oneself. 

The first significant occurrences of the word budō date back to the Kōyō Gunkan (16th century) and were used to describe the samurai lifestyle rather than the practice of martial techniques. The word was later re-theorized and redefined to the definition we know today. First by Nishikubo Hiromichi and the Dai Nippon Butokukai when the name of their vocational school for martial arts was changed from &quot;bujutsu senmon gakkō&quot; to &quot;budō senmon gakkō&quot;. And later by Kanō Jigorō, judo&#x27;s founder, when he chose to name his art judo instead of jujutsu. 

== Typical budo styles ==

* Aikido
* Iaido
* Jodo
* Judo
* Jujutsu
* Karate
* Kendo
* Kūdō
* Kyūdō
* Shōrinji kempō
* Sumo
==&quot;Bujutsu&quot;==

In modern history usage, &quot;bujutsu&quot; translates as martial art, military science, or military strategy depending on context, and is typified by its practical application of technique to real-world or battlefield situations. Budō, meaning martial way, has a more philosophical emphasis, but in actual usage, budo is considered the general term for all martial arts in Japan.

===Civilian vs. military===
Many consider budō a more civilian form of martial arts, as an interpretation or evolution of the older &quot;bujutsu&quot;, which they categorize as a more militaristic style or strategy. According to this distinction, the modern civilian art de-emphasizes practicality and effectiveness in favor of personal development from a fitness or spiritual perspective. The difference is between the more &quot;civilian&quot; versus &quot;military&quot; aspects of combat and personal development. They see budō and &quot;bujutsu&quot; as representing a particular strategy or philosophy regarding combat systems, but still, the terms are rather loosely applied and often interchangeable.

===Art vs. lifestyle===
One view is that a bujutsu is the martial art you practice, whereas a budo is the lifestyle you live and the path you walk by practicing a bujutsu. For example, one could say that judo and jujutsu practised as a martial art are one and the same, meaning that the practice of the art jujutsu leads to obtaining the lifestyle of judo (Judo was originally known as Kano Jujutsu, after judo&#x27;s founder Kanō Jigorō). That would also be true for arts such as kenjutsu/kendo and iaijutsu/iaido.

===Recreational sport===
Budō was featured in the Summer Olympic Games demonstration programme in 1964.

<text>The artillery loop is a knot with a loop on the bight for non-critical purposes. The artillery loop must have the loop loaded or it will slip and contract easily. It is an inferior knot to the alpine butterfly knot, possibly dangerously so, in that it can be yanked out of shape and turn into a running knot or noose.

Budworth states that this knot is often described as being best suited to take a load on only one of the ends, but reliable information on which end is difficult to find.

==Tying the knot==
==Usage==
The name &quot;harness loop&quot; derives from the fact that the knot was used when assisting horses on difficult terrain. Similarly, the name &quot;artillery loop&quot; or &quot;artilleryman&#x27;s hitch&quot; derives from the fact that it was used when hauling field artillery into position.

<text>An Taibhdhearc is the national Irish language theatre of Ireland. It was founded in 1928.

The word &quot;taibhdhearc&quot; appears as a gloss for the Latin &quot;teatrum&quot; (theatre) in an old Irish document, derived from roots meaning &quot;dream&quot; and &quot;glance.&quot; The modern Irish for a theatre is &quot;amharclann&quot;.

An Taibhdhearc is situated at 19 Middle Street, within the medieval city of Galway. It is built on the ruins of the city&#x27;s original Augustinian friary. The rear wall incorporates a wall from this friary, including some carved stone window frames.

The theatre is used for drama and music productions, and occasionally screens international films. The busiest period for the arts in Galway city each year is the two weeks of the annual Galway International Arts Festival.

==Hiatus==
After suffering extensive smoke damage during a fire in 2007, An Taibhdhearc closed its doors for an extended period of renovation and refurbishment. While the theatre was closed, An Taibhdhearc continued to produce shows in other venues around Galway city and county. The theatre was re-opened by President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins in September 2012.

<doc id="201400" wikidata="Q190552" url="?curid=201400" title="Hindu calendar">
<text>The Hindu calendar, also called [[Panchangam|Panchanga]] (), is one of various lunisolar calendars that are traditionally used in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, with further regional variations for social and Hindu religious purposes. They adopt a similar underlying concept for timekeeping based on sidereal year for solar cycle and adjustment of lunar cycles in every three years, but differ in their relative emphasis to moon cycle or the sun cycle and the names of months and when they consider the New Year to start. Of the various regional calendars, the most studied and known Hindu calendars are the Shalivahana Shaka (Based on the King Shalivahana, also the Indian national calendar) found in the Deccan region of Southern India and the Vikram Samvat (Bikrami) found in Nepal and the North and Central regions of India – both of which emphasize the lunar cycle. Their new year starts in spring. In regions such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the solar cycle is emphasized and this is called the Tamil calendar (though Tamil Calendar uses month names like in Hindu Calendar) and Malayalam calendar and these have origins in the second half of the 1st millennium CE. A Hindu calendar is sometimes referred to as Panchangam (पञ्चाङ्गम्), which is also known as Panjika in Eastern India.

The ancient Hindu calendar conceptual design is also found in the Babylonian calendar, the Chinese calendar, and the Hebrew calendar, but different from the Gregorian calendar. Unlike the Gregorian calendar which adds additional days to the month to adjust for the mismatch between twelve lunar cycles (354 lunar days) and approximately 365 solar days, the Hindu calendar maintains the integrity of the lunar month, but inserts an extra full month, once every 32–33 months, to ensure that the festivals and crop-related rituals fall in the appropriate season.

The Hindu calendars have been in use in the Indian subcontinent since Vedic times, and remain in use by the Hindus all over the world, particularly to set Hindu festival dates. Early Buddhist communities of India adopted the ancient Vedic calendar, later Vikrami calendar and then local Buddhist calendars. Buddhist festivals continue to be scheduled according to a lunar system. The Buddhist calendar and the traditional lunisolar calendars of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand are also based on an older version of the Hindu calendar. Similarly, the ancient Jain traditions have followed the same lunisolar system as the Hindu calendar for festivals, texts and inscriptions. However, the Buddhist and Jain timekeeping systems have attempted to use the Buddha and the Mahavira&#x27;s lifetimes as their reference points.

The Hindu calendar is also important to the practice of Hindu astrology and zodiac system. It is also employed for observing the auspicious days of deities and occasions of fasting, such as Ekadashi.

==Origins==
The Vedic culture developed a sophisticated time keeping methodology and calendars for Vedic rituals, and timekeeping as well as the nature of solar and Moon movements are mentioned in Vedic texts. For example, Kaushitaki Brahmana chapter 19.3 mentions the shift in the relative location of the Sun towards north for 6 months, and south for 6 months.

Time keeping was important to Vedic rituals, and &quot;Jyotisha&quot; was the Vedic era field of tracking and predicting the movements of astronomical bodies in order to keep time, in order to fix the day and time of these rituals. This study is one of the six ancient Vedangas, or ancillary science connected with the Vedas.

Yukio Ohashi states that this Vedanga field developed from actual astronomical studies in ancient Vedic Period. The texts of Vedic Jyotisha sciences were translated into the Chinese language in the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE, and the Rigvedic passages on astronomy are found in the works of Zhu Jiangyan and Zhi Qian. According to Subhash Kak, the beginning of the Hindu calendar was much earlier. He cites Greek historians describing Maurya kings referring to a calendar which originated in 6676 BCE known as &quot;Saptarsi&quot; calendar.

The Vikrami calendar is named after king Vikramaditya and starts in 57 BCE.

==Texts==
Hindu scholars kept precise time by observing and calculating the cycles of Surya (the Sun), Moon and the planets. These calculations about the Sun appear in various astronomical texts in Sanskrit, such as the 5th-century &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; by Aryabhata, the 6th-century &quot;Romaka&quot; by Latadeva and &quot;Panca Siddhantika&quot; by Varahamihira, the 7th-century &quot;Khandakhadyaka&quot; by Brahmagupta and the 8th-century &quot;Sisyadhivrddida&quot; by Lalla. These texts present Surya and various planets and estimate the characteristics of the respective planetary motion. Other texts such as &quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot; dated to have been completed sometime between the 5th century and 10th century present their chapters on various deified planets with stories behind them.

The manuscripts of these texts exist in slightly different versions. They present Surya, planet-based calculations and Surya&#x27;s relative motion to Earth. These vary in their data, suggesting that the text were open and revised over their lives. For example, the 1st millennium CE Hindu scholars calculated the sidereal length of a year as follows, from their astronomical studies, with slightly different results:

The Hindu texts used the lunar cycle for setting months and days, but the solar cycle to set the complete year. This system is similar to the Jewish and Babylonian ancient calendars, creating the same challenge of accounting for the mismatch between the nearly 354 lunar days in twelve months, versus over 365 solar days in a year. They tracked the solar year by observing the entrance and departure of &quot;Surya&quot; (sun, at sunrise and sunset) in the constellation formed by stars in the sky, which they divided into 12 intervals of 30 degrees each. Like other ancient human cultures, Hindus innovated a number of systems of which intercalary months became most used, that is adding another month every 32.5 months on average. As their calendar keeping and astronomical observations became more sophisticated, the Hindu calendar became more sophisticated with complex rules and greater accuracy.

According to Scott Montgomery, the &quot;Siddhanta&quot; tradition at the foundation of Hindu calendars predate the Christian era, once had 18 texts of which only 5 have survived into the modern era. These texts provide specific information and formulae on motions of Sun, Moon and planets, to predict their future relative positions, equinoxes, rise and set, with corrections for prograde, retrograde motions, as well as parallax. These ancient scholars attempted to calculate their time to the accuracy of a &quot;truti&quot; (29.63 microseconds). In their pursuit of accurate tracking of relative movements of celestial bodies for their calendar, they had computed the mean diameter of the Earth, which was very close to the actual 12,742 km (7,918 mi).

Hindu calendars were refined during the Gupta era astronomy by Āryabhaṭa and Varāhamihira in the 5th to 6th century. These, in turn, were based in the astronomical tradition of &quot;Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa&quot;, which in the preceding centuries had been standardised in a number of (non-extant) works known as &quot;Sūrya Siddhānta&quot;. Regional diversification took place in the medieval period. The astronomical foundations were further developed in the medieval period, notably by Bhāskara II (12th century).

===Balinese Hindu calendar===
Hinduism and Buddhism were the prominent religions of southeast Asia in the 1st millennium CE, prior to the Islamic conquest that started in the 14th century. The Hindus prevailed in Bali, Indonesia, and they have two types of Hindu calendar. One is a 210-day based Pawukon calendar which likely is a pre-Hindu system, and another is similar to lunisolar calendar system found in South India and it is called the Balinese saka calendar which uses Hindu methodology. The names of month and festivals of Balinese Hindus, for the most part, are different, though the significance and legends have some overlap.

== Astronomical basis ==

The Hindu calendar is based on a geocentric model of the Solar System. A large part of this calendar is defined based on the movement of the Sun and the Moon around the Earth (saura māna and cāndra māna respectively). Furthermore, it includes synodic, sidereal, and tropical elements. Many variants of the Hindu calendar have been created by including and excluding these elements (solar, lunar, lunisolar etc.) and are in use in different parts of India.

==Year: Samvat==
&quot;Samvat&quot; refers to era of the several Hindu calendar systems in Nepal and India, in a similar manner to the Christian era. There are several &quot;samvat&quot; found in historic Buddhist, Hindu and Jain texts and epigraphy, of which three are most significant: Vikrama era, Old Shaka era and Shaka era of 78 CE.

* Vikram Samvat (Bikram Sambat): A northern Indian almanac which started in 57 BCE, and is also called the &quot;Vikrama Era&quot;. It is related to the Bikrami calendar, and is apocryphally linked to Vikramaditya. The year starts from the month of Baishakh / Vaishakha. This system is common in epigraphic evidence from northern, western, central and eastern Indian subcontinent, particularly after the early centuries of the 1st millennium CE.
* Shaka Samvat: There are two Shaka era systems in scholarly use, one is called &quot;Old Shaka Era&quot;, whose epoch is uncertain, probably sometime in the 1st millennium BCE because ancient Buddhist, Jain and Hindu inscriptions and texts use it. However, the starting point of Old Shaka Era is a subject of dispute among scholars. The second system is called &quot;Saka Era of 78 AD&quot;, or simply &quot;Saka Era&quot;, a system that is common in epigraphic evidence from southern India.
* Saka era of Southeast Asia: The Hindu calendar system in Indonesia is attributed to the legend of Hindus arriving with a sage Aji Saka in 1st-century Java, in March 78 CE. Numerous ancient and medieval era texts and inscriptions found in Indonesian islands use this reference year. In mainland southeast Asia, the earliest verifiable use of Hindu Saka methodology in inscriptions is marked &quot;Saka 533&quot; in Ankor Borei, which corresponds to 611 CE, while the Kedukan Bukit inscription in Sumatra, containing three dates in &quot;Saka 604&quot; (682 CE), is the earliest known use of the Shaka era in the Indonesian islands. However, these inscriptions only set the floruit for the use of the Shaka era in these places, and the Hindu calendar likely existed in southeast Asia before these dates to be used in important monuments. Further, the Hindu calendar system remained popular among the Hindus through to the 15th century, and thereafter in Bali.
* Indian national calendar (modern): combines many Hindu calendars into one official standardized one, but old ones remain in use.

==Months==

===Solar month and seasons===

The Hindu calendar divides the zodiac into twelve division called &quot;rāśi&quot; (&quot;group&quot;). The Sun appears to move around the Earth through different divisions/constellations in the sky throughout the year, which in reality is actually caused by the Earth revolving around the Sun. The &quot;rāśi&quot;s have 30° each and are named for constellations found in the zodiac.

The time taken by the Sun to transit through a &quot;rāśi&quot; is a solar month whose name is identical to the name of the &quot;rāśi.&quot; In practice, solar months are mostly referred as &quot;rāśi&quot; (not months).

The solar months are named differently in different regional calendars. While the Malayalam calendar broadly retains the phonetic Sanskrit names, the Bengali and Tamil calendars repurpose the Sanskrit &quot;lunar month names&quot; (Chaitra, Vaishaka etc.) as follows:
* The Tamil calendar replaces Mesha, Vrisha etc. with Chithirai, Vaigasi etc.
* The Bengali calendar is similar to the Tamil calendar except in that it starts the year with Boiśākh (instead of Choitrô), followed by Jyoisthô etc. The Assamese and Odia calendars too are structured the same way.

The solar months (&quot;rāśi&quot;) along with their equivalent names in the Bangali, Malayalam and Tamil calendar are given below:


The solar months (&quot;rāśi&quot;) along with the approximate correspondence to Hindu seasons and Gregorian months are:

The names of the solar months are also used in the Darian calendar for the planet Mars.

===Lunar months===
Lunar months are defined based on lunar cycles, i.e. the regular occurrence of new moon and full moon and the intervening waxing and waning phases of the moon.

====Paksha====

A lunar month contains two fortnights called &quot;pakṣa&quot; (पक्ष, literally &quot;side&quot;). One fortnight is the bright, waxing half where the moon size grows and it ends in the full moon. This is called &quot;Gaura Paksha&quot; or &quot;Shukla Paksha&quot;. The other half is the darkening, waning fortnight which ends in the new moon. This is called &quot;Vadhya Paksha&quot; or &quot;Krishna Paksha&quot;. The Hindu festivals typically are either on or the day after the full moon night or the darkest night (&quot;amavasya&quot;, अमावास्या), except for some associated with Krishna, Durga or Rama. The lunar months of the hot summer and the busy major cropping-related part of the monsoon season typically do not schedule major festivals.

====Amānta and Purnimānta systems====
Two traditions have been followed in the Indian subcontinent with respect to lunar months: the amānta tradition, which ends the lunar month on new moon day (similar to the Islamic calendar) and the purnimānta tradition, which ends it on full moon day. As a consequence, in the amanta tradition, Shukla paksha precedes Krishna paksha in every lunar month, whereas in the purnimānta tradition, Krishna paksha precedes Shukla paksha in every lunar month. As a result, a Shukla paksha will always belong to the same month in both traditions, whereas a Krishna paksha will always be associated with different (but succeeding) months in each tradition.

The amanta (also known as Amāvasyānta or Mukhyamana) tradition is followed by most Indian states that have a peninsular coastline (except Assam, West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, which use their own solar calendars). These states are Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Nepal and most Indian states north of the Vindhya mountains follow the poornimānta (or Gaunamana) tradition.

The poornimānta tradition was being followed in the Vedic era. It was replaced with the amanta tradition as the Hindu calendar system prior to the 1st century BCE, but the Poornimanta tradition was restored in 57 BCE by king Vikramaditya, who wanted to return to the Vedic roots. The presence of this system is one of the factors considered in dating ancient Indian manuscripts and epigraphical evidence that have survived into the modern era.

The two traditions of Amanta and Purnimanta systems have led to alternate ways of dating any festival or event that occurs in a Krishna paksha in the historic Hindu, Buddhist or Jain literature, and contemporary regional literature or festival calendars. For example, the Hindu festival of Maha Shivaratri falls on the fourteenth lunar day of &quot;Magha&#x27;s&quot; Krishna paksha in the Amanta system, while the same exact day is expressed as the fourteenth lunar day of &quot;Phalguna&#x27;s&quot; Krishna paksha in the Purnimanta system. Both lunisolar calendar systems are equivalent ways of referring to the same date, and they continue to be in use in different regions, though the Purnimanta system is now typically assumed as implied in modern Indology literature if not otherwise specified.

====List====
The names of the Hindu months vary by region. Those Hindu calendars which are based on lunar cycle are generally phonetic variants of each other, while the solar cycle are generally variants of each other too, suggesting that the timekeeping knowledge travelled widely across the Indian subcontinent in ancient times.

During each lunar month, the Sun transits into a sign of the zodicac (sankranti). The lunar month in which the Sun transits into Mesha is named Chaitra and designated as the first month of the lunar year.

A few major calendars are summarized below:


===Corrections between lunar and solar months===
Twelve Hindu mas (māsa, lunar month) are equal to approximately 354 days, while the length of a sidereal (solar) year is about 365 days. This creates a difference of about eleven days, which is offset every (29.53/10.63) = 2.71 years, or approximately every 32.5 months. Purushottam Maas or Adhika Maas is an extra month that is inserted to keep the lunar and solar calendars aligned. The twelve months are subdivided into six lunar seasons timed with the agriculture cycles, blooming of natural flowers, fall of leaves, and weather. To account for the mismatch between lunar and solar calendar, the Hindu scholars adopted intercalary months, where a particular month just repeated. The choice of this month was not random, but timed to sync back the two calendars to the cycle of agriculture and nature.

The repetition of a month created the problem of scheduling festivals, weddings and other social events without repetition and confusion. This was resolved by declaring one month as &quot;Shudha&quot; (pure, clean, regular, proper, also called &quot;Deva&quot; month) and the other &quot;Mala&quot; or &quot;Adhika&quot; (extra, unclean and inauspicious, also called Asura month).

The Hindu mathematicians who calculated the best way to adjust the two years, over long periods of a &quot;yuga&quot; (era, tables calculating 1000s of years), they determined that the best means to intercalate the months is to time the intercalary months on a 19-year cycle, similar to the Metonic cycle used in the Hebrew calendar. This intercalation is generally adopted in the 3rd, 5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 16th and 19th year of this cycle. Further, the complex rules rule out the repetition of Mārgaśīrṣa (also called &quot;Agrahayana&quot;), Pausha and Magha lunar months. The historic Hindu texts are not consistent on these rules, with competing ideas flourishing in the Hindu culture.

====Rare corrections====
The Hindu calendar makes further rare adjustments, over a cycle of centuries, where a certain month is considered &quot;kshaya&quot; month (dropped). This occurs because of the complexity of the relative lunar, solar and earth movements. Underhill (1991) describes this part of Hindu calendar theory: &quot;when the sun is in perigee, and a lunar month being at its longest, if the new moon immediately precedes a sankranti, then the first of the two lunar months is deleted (called &quot;nija&quot; or &quot;kshaya&quot;).&quot; This, for example, happened in the year 1 BCE, when there was no new moon between Makara sankranti and Kumbha sankranti, and the month of Pausha was dropped.

==Day==
Just like months, the Hindu calendar has two measures of a day, one based on the lunar movement and the other on solar. The solar (&quot;saura&quot;) day or civil day, called &quot;divasa&quot; (), has been what most Hindus traditionally use, is easy and empirical to observe, with or without a clock, and it is defined as the period from one sunrise to another. The lunar day is called &quot;tithi&quot; (), and this is based on complicated measures of lunar movement. A lunar day or &quot;tithi&quot; may, for example, begin in the middle of an afternoon and end next afternoon. Both these days do not directly correspond to a mathematical measure for a day such as equal 24 hours of a solar year, a fact that the Hindu calendar scholars knew, but the system of &quot;divasa&quot; was convenient for the general population. The &quot;tithi&quot; have been the basis for timing rituals and festivals, while &quot;divasa&quot; for everyday use. The Hindu calendars adjust the mismatch in &quot;divasa&quot; and &quot;tithi&quot;, using a methodology similar to the solar and lunar months.

A &quot;tithi&quot; is technically defined in Vedic texts, states John E. Cort, as &quot;the time required by the combined motions of the Sun and Moon to increase (in a bright fortnight) or decrease (in a dark fortnight) their relative distance by twelve degrees of the zodiac. These motions are measured using a fixed map of celestial zodiac as reference, and given the elliptical orbits, a duration of a &quot;tithi&quot; varies between 21.5 and 26 hours, states Cort. However, in the Indian tradition, the general population&#x27;s practice has been to treat a tithi as a solar day between one sunrise to next.

A lunar month has 30 &quot;tithi&quot;. The technical standard makes each &quot;tithi&quot; contain different number of hours, but helps the overall integrity of the calendar. Given the variation in the length of a solar day with seasons, and the Moon&#x27;s relative movements, the start and end time for &quot;tithi&quot; varies over the seasons and over the years, and the &quot;tithi&quot; adjusted to sync with &quot;divasa&quot; periodically with intercalation.

===Weekday/Vāsara===
&quot;Vāsara&quot; refers to the weekdays in Sanskrit. Also referred to as &quot;Vara&quot; and used as a suffix. The correspondence between the names of the week in Hindu and other Indo-European calendars are exact. This alignment of names probably took place sometime during the 3rd century CE. The weekday of a Hindu calendar has been symmetrically divided into 60 &quot;ghatika&quot;, each &quot;ghatika&quot; (24 minutes) is divided into 60 &quot;pala&quot;, each &quot;pala&quot; (24 seconds) is subdivided into 60 &quot;vipala&quot;, and so on.


The term -vāsara is often realised as vāra or vaar in Sanskrit-derived and influenced languages. There are many variations of the names in the regional languages, mostly using alternate names of the celestial bodies involved.

===Five limbs of time===
The complete Vedic calendars contain five &quot;angas&quot; or parts of information: lunar day (tithi), solar day (diwas), asterism (naksatra), planetary joining (yoga) and astronomical period (karanam). This structure gives the calendar the name &quot;Panchangam&quot;. The first two are discussed above.

====Yoga====

::&quot;See the main article on yoga.&quot;
The Sanskrit word Yoga means &quot;union, joining, attachment&quot;, but in astronomical context, this word means latitudinal and longitudinal information. The longitude of the Sun and the longitude of the Moon are added, and normalised to a value ranging between 0° to 360° (if greater than 360, one subtracts 360). This sum is divided into 27 parts. Each part will now equal 800&#x27; (where &#x27; is the symbol of the arcminute which means 1/60 of a degree). These parts are called the &quot;yogas&quot;. They are labelled:
# Viṣkambha
# Prīti
# Āyuśmān
# Saubhāgya
# Śobhana
# Atigaṇḍa
# Sukarma
# Dhrti
# Śūla
# Gaṇḍa
# Vṛddhi
# Dhruva
# Vyāghatā
# Harṣaṇa
# Vajra
# Siddhi
# Vyatipāta
# Variyas
# Parigha
# Śiva
# Siddha
# Sādhya
# Śubha
# Śukla
# Brahma
# Māhendra
# Vaidhṛti

Again, minor variations may exist. The &quot;yoga&quot; that is active during sunrise of a day is the prevailing &quot;yoga&quot; for the day.

====Karaṇa====
A karaṇa is half of a tithi. To be precise, a karaṇa is the time required for the angular distance between the Sun and the Moon to increase in steps of 6° starting from 0°. (Compare with the definition of a tithi.)

Since the tithis are 30 in number, and since 1 tithi = 2 karaṇas, therefore one would logically expect there to be 60 karaṇas. But there are only 11 such karaṇas which fill up those slots to accommodate for those 30 tithis. There are actually 4 &quot;fixed&quot; (sthira) karaṇas and 7 &quot;repeating&quot; (cara) karaṇas.

The 4 &quot;fixed&quot; karaṇas are:
# Śakuni (शकुनि)
# Catuṣpāda (चतुष्पाद)
# Nāga (नाग)
# Kiṃstughna (किंस्तुघ्न)

The 7 &quot;repeating&quot; karaṇas are:
# Vava or Bava (बव)
# Valava or Bālava (बालव)
# Kaulava (कौलव)
# Taitila or Taitula (तैतिल)
# Gara or Garaja (गरज)
# Vaṇija (वणिज)
# Viṣṭi (Bhadra) (भद्रा)
* Now the first half of the 1st &quot;tithi&quot; (of Śukla Pakṣa) is always &quot;Kiṃtughna karaṇa&quot;. Hence this karaṇa is &quot;fixed&quot;.
* Next, the 7-repeating karaṇas repeat eight times to cover the next 56 half-&quot;tithis&quot;. Thus these are the &quot;repeating&quot; (cara) karaṇas.
* The 3 remaining half-&quot;tithis&quot; take the remaining &quot;fixed&quot; karaṇas in order. Thus these are also &quot;fixed&quot; (sthira).
* Thus one gets 60 karaṇas from those 11 preset karaṇas.

The Vedic day begins at sunrise. The karaṇa at sunrise of a particular day shall be the prevailing karaṇa for the whole day.
(citation needed )

====Nakshatra====

Nakshatras are divisions of ecliptic, each 13° 20&#x27;, starting from 0° Aries.

==Festival calendar: Solar and Lunar dates==

Many holidays in the Hindu, Buddhist and Jaina traditions are based on the lunar cycles in the lunisolar timekeeping with foundations in the Hindu calendar system. A few holidays, however, are based on the solar cycle, such as the Vaisakhi, Pongal and those associated with Sankranti. The dates of the lunar cycle based festivals vary significantly on the Gregorian calendar and at times by several weeks. The solar cycle based ancient Hindu festivals almost always fall on the same Gregorian date every year and if they vary in an exceptional year, it is by one day.

==Regional variants==
The Hindu Calendar Reform Committee, appointed in 1952, identified more than thirty well-developed calendars, in use across different parts of India.

Variants include the lunar emphasizing &quot;Vikrama&quot;, and the &quot;Shalivahana&quot; calendars, as well as the solar emphasizing Tamil calendar and Malayalam calendar. The two calendars most widely used today are the &quot;Vikrama&quot; calendar, which is in followed in western and northern India and Nepal, the Shalivahana Shaka calendar which is followed in the Deccan region of India (Comprising present day Indian states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Goa).

<text>The Nelson River is a river of north-central North America, in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The river drains Lake Winnipeg and runs before it ends in Hudson Bay. Its full length (including the Saskatchewan River and Bow River) is , it has mean discharge of , and has a drainage basin of , of which is in the United States.

== Geography ==

The Nelson River flows into Playgreen Lake from Lake Winnipeg then flows from two channels into Cross Lake. The east channel and the Jack River flow from the southeast portion of the lake into Little Playgreen Lake then the Nelson east channel continues in a northerly direction passing through Pipestone Lake on its way to Cross Lake. The west channel flows out of the north ends of Playgreen Lake, Kiskittogisu Lake and Kiskitto Lake into Cross Lake at the Manitoba Hydro&#x27;s Jenpeg Generating Station and Dam. From Cross Lake it flows through Sipiwesk Lake, Split Lake and Stephens Lake on its way to the Hudson Bay.

Since it drains Lake Winnipeg, it is the last part of the large Saskatchewan River system, as well as that of the Red River and Winnipeg River. Devils Lake is unusual for a glacial lake in being presently closed, also has been known to overflow into the Red River for at least five separate periods since deglaciation.

Besides Lake Winnipeg, its primary tributaries include the Grass River, which drains a long area north of Lake Winnipeg, and the Burntwood River, which passes through Thompson, Manitoba.

The river flows into Hudson Bay at Port Nelson (now a ghost town), just north of the Hayes River and York Factory. Other communities upriver from there include Bird, Sundance, Long Spruce, Gillam, Split Lake, Arnot, Cross Lake, and Norway House.

=== Transportation ===
North America has just one port on the Arctic Ocean, linked to the North American railway grid—at Churchill, Manitoba, at the mouth of the Churchill River.
Originally port facilities were to have been built at Port Nelson; original proposals for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay rail link would have used that point as a terminus. Practical problems led to the port&#x27;s relocation to Churchill. Those difficulties included a much greater need for dredging, because the Nelson River&#x27;s water was more full of silt, in absolute terms, and carried more silt because of its greater volume of flow. The Nelson estuary is broad and shallow, so port facilities would have to be constructed on artificial islands created in the middle of the river, that would require a causeway approximately a kilometre long to reach.

== History ==

The river was named by Sir Thomas Button, a Welsh explorer from St. Lythans, Glamorganshire, who wintered at its mouth in 1612, after Robert Nelson, a ship&#x27;s master who died there. At that time, the Cree people who lived along its banks called it Powinigow or Powinini-gow, which may have meant &quot;the Rapid Strangers&#x27; river&quot;. The area was fought over for the fur trade, though the Hayes River, whose mouth is near the Nelson&#x27;s, became the main route inland.

Competition over the fur trade drove multiple attempts to establish trading posts at the mouth of the Nelson over a number of years. One 1670 expedition organized by the newly-chartered Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and guided by the French fur trader and adventurer Pierre-Esprit Radisson successfully reached the Nelson estuary. Landing in September, the first overseas governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, Charles Bayly, nailed a brass plate of the English royal arms to a tree, formally claiming the territory for England. They arrived too late in the season to trade with local indigenous people, however, who had migrated inland by that time.

Fort Nelson (1670–1713), a historic Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trading post, was built at the mouth of the Nelson River at Hudson Bay and was a key trading post in the early 18th century. After his pivotal role in establishing the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, Pierre Esprit Radisson, noted French explorer, was chief director of trade at Fort Nelson during one of his sustained periods of service to England. Today, Fort Nelson no longer exists. Port Nelson, the abandoned shipping port, remains on the opposite side of the river mouth on Hudson Bay.

The Nelson River&#x27;s huge volume and long drop make it useful for generating hydroelectricity. Flooding caused by damming of the river has provoked bitter disputes with First Nations in the past although the Northern Flood Agreement was created in the 1970s to help offset the damages caused by flooding.

<text>Alejandro González Malavé (May 20, 1957 in San Juan, Puerto Rico – April 29, 1986 in Bayamón, Puerto Rico) was a Puerto Rican undercover agent who gained infamy with the Cerro Maravilla case scandal. In 1973, still a High School student, Malavé was recruited as an undercover agent.

González from a poor family, he grew up with his parents and a younger brother in the Monacillos neighborhood of Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, an outspoken university political leader, graduated as a police officer in 1979 in the Puerto Rico Police, the same year he went to work undercover. He infiltrated an organization of radical pro independence students and was the driver when Carlos Soto Arriví and Arnaldo Darío Rosado were murdered during a police set up at Cerro Maravilla.

When the &quot;Cerro Maravilla&quot; inquest was televised all over Puerto Rico González, one of the accused, gained widespread infamy all across the island. His face became a common sight on Puerto Rican newspaper covers, and he received constant air time on television, because he had to take the stand many times during the trial. Although the scandal played a role in squashing the reelection plans of Governor Carlos Romero Barceló, the alleged conspiracy was never proven. González was tried, but acquitted on all charges.

On the evening of April 29, 1986, just two months after his acquittal, González was assassinated in front of his mother&#x27;s house in Bayamón. He received three gunshot wounds while his mother was slightly injured. A few hours later, a group calling itself the &quot;Volunteer Organization for the Revolution&quot; called local news agencies claiming responsibility. In their statements they swore to kill, &quot;one by one&quot;, all the police officers involved in the deaths in Cerro Maravilla.

<text>Wētā FX, formerly known as Weta Digital, is a New Zealand–based digital visual effects and computer animation company based in Miramar, Wellington. It was founded by Peter Jackson, Richard Taylor, and Jamie Selkirk in 1993 to produce the digital visual effects for &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;. The company went on to produce some of the highest-grossing films ever made, such as the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy and the &quot;Avatar&quot; series. Considered one of the most influential film companies of the 21st century, Wētā FX has won several Academy Awards and BAFTA Awards. The company is named after the New Zealand wētā, one of the world&#x27;s largest insects, which was historically featured in the company logo.

==History==


The company was founded by Peter Jackson, Richard Taylor, and Jamie Selkirk in 1993 to produce the digital visual effects for the film Heavenly Creatures. As of 2025, Wētā FX has won eight Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects: &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001), &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; (2002), &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; (2003), &quot;King Kong&quot; (2005), &quot;Bridge to Terabithia&quot; (2007), &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009), &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (2016), and &quot;&quot; (2022).

The studio has developed several proprietary software packages to achieve groundbreaking visual effects. The scale of the battles required for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy led to the creation of MASSIVE, a program which can animate huge numbers of agents: independent characters acting according to pre-set rules.

To recreate 1933 New York for &quot;King Kong&quot;, the company created CityBot, an application which could &quot;build&quot; the city on a shot by shot basis. Kong&#x27;s fur also required the development of new simulation and modeling software. A set of tools that combined procedural and interactive techniques added wind to the five million individual strands of fur and modeled interaction with other surfaces. New shaders were written that accounted for the scattering of light from within each hair that added to the volumetric quality of the fur. Large chunks of fur were ripped out and filled in with scars, blood, and the mud of Skull Island. Each frame of fur took two gigabytes of data.

For James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot;, Weta Digital modified MASSIVE to give life to the flora and fauna on Pandora, for which the company did most of the visual effects with Joe Letteri, under a team led by executive and producer Eileen Moran. The film is regarded as a landmark for visual effects. By 2017, Weta Digital had started visual effects development for the sequels.

In 2010, a texture painting application developed by the studio for &quot;Avatar&quot; called Mari has been bought by The Foundry Visionmongers. For &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; and &quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot;, the studio developed a new grooming system called Barbershop where users can interactively manipulate digital hair. This tool received a Sci-tech award in 2015. &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; was Weta Digital&#x27;s first fully animated feature film.

For &quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot; in 2011, the company was able to develop their motion capture technique to be able to leave the studio for shooting on location. The motion capture technology would be improved in the 2014 sequel &quot;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&quot;. This was further refined in &quot;War for the Planet of the Apes&quot; in 2017.

On June 19, 2020, Weta Digital announced that it would be producing original animation content under the name Weta Animated. The company also announced a new chief executive Prem Akkaraju, who comes from Los Angeles. In September 2020, Weta was able to secure a multi-year deal with Amazon Web Services to use the Amazon cloud to forward its VFX and computer animation production.

In December 2020, Weta Digital CEO Prem Akkaraju announced additional board members including Tom Staggs, Jeff Huber and Ken Kamins. They join current board members Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Sean Parker and Joe Letteri.

On June 17, 2021, Weta Digital announced they have partnered with Autodesk to productize Weta&#x27;s proprietary tools based in Autodesk Maya for a cloud service called WetaM. It will first be released in Q4 as a private beta.

On August 23, 2021, Weta Digital announced a collaboration with SideFX for a cloud service combining the studio&#x27;s proprietary tools within SideFX&#x27;s Houdini called WetaH.

On November 9, 2021, Jackson sold the company&#x27;s VFX tools development division to video games software company Unity Technologies for US$1.625 billion. Unity&#x27;s acquired tech assets of Weta will be called Weta Digital, while the visual effects company remained separate and renamed as Wētā FX. The acquisition was completed in December 2021. In April 2022, Wētā FX opened a new studio in Vancouver. It is the company&#x27;s first dedicated VFX and animation studio outside New Zealand.

For &quot;&quot; in 2022, Wētā worked on 3,240 visual effects shots, 2,225 of which involved water. The studio developed new motion capture technology for the film&#x27;s underwater sequences. The digital water in the film was created by artists using Wētā&#x27;s latest Loki simulation software. Wētā also refined their Facial Action Coding System (FACS) from &quot;&quot; for its use in &quot;Avatar: The Way of Water&quot;. The company eventually ended up rendering close to 3.3 billion thread hours. Letteri won his fifth Academy Award for his work on the film.

On November 25, 2023, Unity and Wētā FX mutually agreed to terminate Unity’s service agreement with Wētā FX effective December 10, 2023; this comes after Unity laying off the entire Wētā Digital staff in a &quot;company reset&quot;. Unity will continue to own the software from the Wētā Digital acquisition (with Wētā FX being able to continue using them), but the Wētā Digital name and related intellectual property will be transferred back to Wētā FX with no current plans to use the old Wētā Digital name. Wētā FX will be extending offers to as many of the Digital team as possible &quot;as it looks to expand its research, development and support functions&quot;.

== Workplace culture ==
An investigation into Wētā&#x27;s workplace culture by Kiwi public TV broadcaster &quot;1News&quot;, begun in June 2020 following a social media post by former Wētā Workshop employee Layna Lazar, resulted in more than 40 current and former Weta Digital employees anonymously sharing accounts of &quot;sexism, bullying and harassment&quot; in September 2020.

In their testimonies, workers identified the existence of a male-only pornographic mailing list called &quot;Caveman&quot;, which originated in 2002 following a company-wide tradition known as Porn Friday, and continued to circulate until 2015. Several reports also alleged that the company&#x27;s IT systems required upgrades in order to accommodate the volume of pornographic content hosted on the company intranet, in addition to numerous allegations of sexual harassment, bullying, intimidation, misogyny and homophobia.

In response to these allegations, Wētā owners, including Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and chief executive officer Prem Akkaraju, commissioned an independent review from barrister Miriam Dean, who stated in her report that she received 80 complaints of bullying behavior, 120 complaints of inappropriate conduct and 19 complaints of sexual harassment from amongst the company&#x27;s 1,500 employees. 

Dean put forward 17 recommendations for internal reform, including the establishment of a code of conduct, restricting the executive team, expanding the diversity and inclusion program, and reviewing the company&#x27;s pay structure. Her review also stated that the existing management systems were not sufficient to protect workers &quot;from bullying, sexual harassment, sex discrimination and other inappropriate conduct&quot;.

<text>&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Quercus robur, the pedunculate oak or English oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech and oak family, Fagaceae. It is a large tree, native to most of Europe and western Asia, and is widely cultivated in other temperate regions. It grows on soils of near neutral acidity in the lowlands and is notable for its value to natural ecosystems, supporting a very wide diversity of herbivorous insects and other pests, predators and pathogens.

==Description==

&quot;Quercus robur&quot; is a deciduous tree up to tall, with a single stout trunk that can be as much as in girth (circumference at breast height) or even in pollarded specimens. Older trees tend to be pollarded, with boles (the main trunk) long. These live longer and become more stout than unpollarded trees. The crown is spreading and unevenly domed, and trees often have massive lower branches. The bark is greyish-brown and closely grooved, with vertical plates. There are often large burrs on the trunk, which typically produce many small shoots. Oaks do not produce suckers but do recover well from pruning or lightning damage. The twigs are hairless and the buds are rounded (ovoid), brownish and pointed.

The leaves are arranged alternately along the twigs and are broadly oblong or ovate, long by wide, with a short (typically ) petiole. They have a cordate (auricled) base and 3–6 rounded lobes, divided no further than halfway to the midrib. The leaves are usually glabrous or have just a few simple hairs on the lower surface. They are dark green above, paler below, and are often covered in small disks of spangle gall by autumn.

Flowering takes place in spring (early May in England). It is wind-pollinated. The male flowers occur in narrow catkins some long and arranged in small bunches; the female flowers are small, brown with dark red stigmas, about 2 mm in diameter and are found at the tips of new shoots on peduncles 2–5 cm long.

The fruits (acorns) are borne in clusters of 2–3 on a long peduncle (stalk) 4–8 cm long. Each acorn is 1.5–4 cm long, ovoid with a pointed tip, starting whitish-green and becoming brown, then black. As with all oaks, the acorns are carried in a shallow cup which can be distinctive in identifying the species. It is an &quot;alternate bearing&quot; species, its large crops produced every other year.

=== Chemistry ===
Grandinin/roburin E, castalagin/vescalagin, gallic acid, monogalloyl glucose (glucogallin) and valoneic acid dilactone, monogalloyl glucose, digalloyl glucose, trigalloyl glucose, rhamnose, quercitrin and ellagic acid are phenolic compounds found in &quot;Q. robur&quot;. The heartwood contains triterpene saponins.

=== Similar species ===
&quot;Q. robur&quot; is most likely to be confused with sessile oak, which shares much of its range. Distinguishing features of &quot;Q. robur&quot; include the auricles at the leaf base, the very short petiole, its clusters of acorns being borne on a long peduncle, and the lack of stellate hairs on the underside of the leaf. The two often hybridise in the wild, forming &quot;Quercus × rosacea&quot;.

Turkey oak is also sometimes confused with it, but that species has &quot;whiskers&quot; on the winter buds and deeper lobes on the leaves (often more than halfway to the midrib). The acorn cups are also very different.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Quercus robur&quot; (from the Latin &quot;quercus&quot;, &quot;oak&quot; + &quot;robur&quot; derived from a word meaning robust, strong) was named by Carl Linnaeus in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; (1753). It is the type species of the genus and classified in the white oak section (&quot;Quercus&quot; section &quot;Quercus&quot;).

It has numerous common names, including &quot;common oak&quot;, &quot;European oak&quot; and &quot;English oak&quot;. In French it is called &quot;chêne pédonculé&quot;.

The genome of &quot;Q. robur&quot; has been completely sequenced (GenOak project); the first version was published in 2016. It comprises 12 chromosome pairs (2n = 24), about  genes and 750 million bp.

There are many synonyms, and numerous varieties and subspecies have been named. The populations in Iberia, Italy, southeast Europe, and Asia Minor and the Caucasus are sometimes treated as separate species, &quot;Q. orocantabrica,&quot; &quot;Q. brutia&quot; Tenore, &quot;Q. pedunculiflora&quot; K. Koch and &quot;Q. haas&quot; Kotschy respectively.

&quot;Quercus × rosacea&quot; Bechst. (&quot;Q. petraea&quot; x &quot;Q. robur&quot;) is the only naturally-occurring hybrid, but the following crosses with other white oak species have been produced in cultivation:
* &quot;Q. × bimundorum&quot; (&quot;Q. alba&quot; × &quot;Q. robur&quot;) (two worlds oak)
* &quot;Q. × macdanielli&quot; (&quot;Q. macrocarpa&quot; × &quot;Q. robur&quot;) (heritage oak)
* &quot;Q. × turneri&quot; Willd. (&quot;Q. ilex&quot; × &quot;Q. robur&quot;) (Turner&#x27;s oak)
* &quot;Q. × warei&quot; (&quot;Q. robur fastigiata&quot; x &quot;Q. bicolor&quot;).

There are numerous cultivars available, among which the following are commonly grown:
* &#x27;Fastigiata&#x27;, cypress oak, is a large imposing tree with a narrow columnar habit.
* &#x27;Concordia&#x27;, golden oak, is a small, very slow-growing tree, eventually reaching , with bright golden-yellow leaves throughout spring and summer. It was originally raised in Van Geert&#x27;s nursery at Ghent in 1843.
* &#x27;Pendula&#x27;, weeping oak, is a small to medium-sized tree with pendulous branches, reaching up to .
* &#x27;Purpurea&#x27; is another small form, growing to , with purple leaves.
* &#x27;Pectinata&#x27; (syn. &#x27;Filicifolia&#x27;), cut-leaved oak, is a cultivar where the leaf is pinnately divided into fine, forward-pointing segments.

==Distribution and habitat==

The species is native to most of Europe and western Asia, and is widely cultivated in other temperate regions.

It is a long-lived tree of high-canopy woodland, coppice and wood pasture, and it is commonly planted in hedges. When compared to sessile oak, it is more abundant in the lowlands of the south and east of Britain, and it occurs on more neutral (less acid) soils. It is rare on thin, well-drained calcareous (chalk and limestone) soil. Sometimes it is found on the margins of swamps, rivers and ponds, showing that it is fairly tolerant of intermittent flooding. Its Ellenberg values in Britain are L = 7, F = 5, R = 5, N = 4, and S = 0.

==Ecology==

Within its native range, &quot;Q. robur&quot; is valued for its importance to insects and other wildlife, supporting the highest biodiversity of insect herbivores of any British plant (at least 400 species). The most well-known of these are the ones that form galls, which number about 35. In Britain, the knopper gall is very common, and Andricus grossulariae produces somewhat similar spiky galls on the acorn cups. Also common in Britain are two types of spherical galls on the twigs: the oak marble gall and the cola nut gall. The latter are smaller and rougher than the former. A single, large exit hole indicates that the wasp inside has escaped, whereas several smaller holes show that it was parasitised by another insect, and these emerged instead. The undersides of oak leaves are often covered in spangle galls, which persist after the leaves fall.

One of the most distinctive galls is the oak apple, a 4.5 cm diameter spongy ball created from the buds by the wasp &quot;Biorhiza pallida&quot;. The pineapple gall, while less common, is also easily recognised.

The quantity of caterpillar species on an oak tree increases with the age of the tree, with blue tits and great tits timing their egg hatching to the leaves opening. The most common caterpillar species include the winter moth, the green tortrix and the mottled umber, all of which can become extremely abundant on the first flush of leaves in May, but the oak trees do recover their foliage later in the year.

The acorns are typically produced in large quantities every other year (unlike &quot;Q. petraea&quot;, which produces large crops only every 4-10 years) and form a valuable food resource for several small mammals and some birds, notably Eurasian jays &quot;Garrulus glandarius&quot;. Jays were overwhelmingly the primary propagators of oaks before humans began planting them commercially (and remain the principal propagators for wild oaks), because of their habit of taking acorns from the umbra of its parent tree and burying them undamaged elsewhere.

===Diseases===
* Acute oak decline
* Powdery mildew caused by &quot;Erysiphe alphitoides&quot;
* Sudden oak death

== Uses ==
&quot;Quercus robur&quot; is planted for forestry, and produces a long-lasting and durable heartwood, much in demand for interior and furniture work. The wood is identified by a close examination of a cross-section perpendicular to fibres. The wood is characterised by its distinct (often wide) dark and light brown growth rings. The earlywood displays a vast number of large vessels (around in diameter). There are rays of thin (about ) yellow or light brown lines running across the growth rings. The timber is around per cubic meter in density.

Additionally, although bitter due to their high tannin content, the acorns can be roasted and ground into a coffee substitute.

==In culture==
In the Scandinavian countries, oaks were considered the &quot;thunderstorm trees&quot;, representing Thor, the god of thunder. A Finnish myth is that the World tree, a great oak which grew to block the movement of the sky, sunlight and moonlight, had to be felled, releasing its magic, thus creating the Milky Way. The oak tree also had a symbolic value in France. Some oaks were considered sacred by the Gauls; druids would cut down the mistletoe growing on them. Even after Christianization, oak trees were considered to protect as lightning would strike them rather than on nearby inhabitation. Such struck trees would often be turned into places of worship, like the Chêne chapelle.

In 1746, all oak trees in Finland were legally classified as royal property, and oaks had enjoyed legal protection already from the 17th century. The oak is also the regional tree of the Southwest Finland region.

During the French Revolution, oaks were often planted as trees of freedom. One such tree, planted during the 1848 Revolution, survived the destruction of Oradour-sur-Glane by the Nazis. After the announcement of General Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s death, caricaturist Jacques Faizant represented him as a fallen oak.

In Germany, the oak tree can be found in several paintings of Caspar David Friedrich and in &quot;Of the life of a Good-For-Nothing&quot; written by Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff as a symbol of the state protecting every citizen.

In Serbia the oak is a national symbol, having been part of the historical coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Serbia, the historical coat of arms and flags of the Principality of Serbia, as well as the current traditional coat of arms and flag of Vojvodina.
In England, the oak has assumed the status of a national emblem. This has its origins in the oak tree at Boscobel House, where the future King Charles II hid from his Parliamentarian pursuers in 1650 during the English Civil War; the tree has since been known as the Royal Oak. This event was celebrated nationally on 29 May as Oak Apple Day, which continues to this day in some communities.

Many place names in England include a reference to this tree, including Oakley, Occold and Eyke. Copdock, in Suffolk, probably derives from a pollarded oak (&quot;copped oak&quot;). &#x27;The Royal Oak&#x27; is the third most popular pub name in Britain (with 541 counted in 2007) and HMS &quot;Royal Oak&quot; has been the name of eight major Royal Navy warships. The naval associations are strengthened by the fact that oak was the main construction material for sailing warships. The Royal Navy was often described as &quot;The Wooden Walls of Old England&quot; (a paraphrase of the Delphic Oracle) and the Navy&#x27;s official quick march is &quot;Heart of Oak&quot;. In folklore, the Major Oak is where Robin Hood is purported to have taken shelter.

Oak leaves (not necessarily of this species) have been depicted on the Croatian 5 lipa coin; on old German Deutsche Mark currency (1 through 10 Pfennigs; the 50 Pfennigs coin showed a woman planting an oak seedling), and now on German-issued euro currency coins (1 through 5 cents); and on British pound coins (1987 and 1992 issues).

===Notable trees===

It is often claimed that England has more ancient oaks than the rest of Europe combined. This is based on research by Aljos Farjon at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, who found that there were 115 oaks (of both species) in England with a circumference of 9 m or more, compared with just 96 in Europe. This is attributed to the persistence of mediaeval deer parks in the landscape. The Majesty Oak, with a circumference of , is the thickest such tree in Great Britain. The Brureika (Bridal Oak) in Norway with a circumference of (in 2018) and the Kaive Oak in Latvia with a circumference of are among the thickest trees in Northern Europe. The largest historical oak was known as the Imperial Oak from Bosnia and Herzegovina. This specimen was recorded at 17.5 m in circumference at breast height and estimated at over 150 m³ in total volume. It collapsed in 1998.

Two individuals of notable longevity are the Stelmužė Oak in Lithuania and the Granit Oak in Bulgaria, which are believed to be more than 1500 years old, possibly making them the oldest oaks in Europe; another specimen, called the &#x27;Kongeegen&#x27; (&#x27;Kings Oak&#x27;), estimated to be about 1,200 years old, grows in Jaegerspris, Denmark. Yet another can be found in Kvilleken, Sweden, that is over 1000 years old and around. Of maiden (not pollarded) specimens, one of the oldest is the great oak of Ivenack, Germany. Tree-ring research of this tree and other oaks nearby gives an estimated age of 700 to 800 years. Also the Bowthorpe Oak in Lincolnshire, England is estimated to be 1,000 years old, making it the oldest in the UK, although there is Knightwood Oak in the New Forest that is also said to be as old. The highest density of &quot;Q. robur&quot; with a circumference of and more is in Latvia.

In Ireland, at Birr Castle, a specimen over 400 years old has a girth of , known as the Carroll Oak.

In the Basque Country (Spain and France), the &#x27;tree of Gernika&#x27; is an ancient oak tree located in Gernika, under which the Lehendakari (Basque prime minister) swears his oath of office.

The largest example in Australia is in Donnybrook, Western Australia.

<text>The Turkish alphabet () is a Latin-script alphabet used for writing the Turkish language, consisting of 29 letters, seven of which (Ç, Ğ, I, İ, Ö, Ş and Ü) have been modified from their Latin originals for the phonetic requirements of the language. This alphabet represents modern Turkish pronunciation with a high degree of accuracy and specificity. Mandated in 1928 as part of Atatürk&#x27;s Reforms, it is the current official alphabet and the latest in a series of distinct alphabets used in different eras.

The Turkish alphabet has been the model for the official Latinization of several Turkic languages formerly written in the Arabic or Cyrillic script like Azerbaijani (1991), Turkmen (1993), and recently Kazakh (2021).

==Letters==
The following table presents the Turkish letters, the sounds they correspond to in International Phonetic Alphabet and how these can be approximated more or less by an English speaker.

Of the 29 letters, eight are vowels (A, E, I, İ, O, Ö, U, Ü); the other 21 are consonants.

Dotted and dotless I are distinct letters in Turkish such that ⟨i⟩ becomes ⟨İ⟩ when capitalised, ⟨I⟩ being the capital form of ⟨ı⟩.

Turkish also adds a circumflex over the back vowels ⟨â⟩ and ⟨û⟩ following ⟨k⟩, ⟨g⟩, or ⟨l⟩ when these consonants represent , , and (instead of , , and ):
* â for and/or to indicate that the consonant before â is palatalised; e.g. means &quot;profit&quot;, while means &quot;snow&quot;.
* î for (no palatalisation implied, however lengthens the pronunciation of the vowel).
* û for and/or to indicate palatalisation.

In the case of length distinction, these letters are used for old Arabic and Persian borrowings from the Ottoman Turkish period, most of which have been eliminated from the language. Native Turkish words have no vowel length distinction. The combinations of , , and with and also mainly occur in loanwords, but may also occur in native Turkish compound words, as in the name Dilâçar (from + ).

Turkish orthography is highly regular and a word&#x27;s pronunciation is usually identified by its spelling.

===Distinctive features===

Dotted and dotless I are separate letters, each with its own uppercase and lowercase forms. The lowercase form of &quot;I&quot; is &quot;ı&quot;, and the lowercase form of &quot;İ&quot; is &quot;i&quot;. (In the original law establishing the alphabet, the dotted &quot;İ&quot; came before the undotted &quot;I&quot;; now their places are reversed.) The letter &quot;J&quot;, however, uses a tittle in the same way English does, with a dotted lowercase version, and a dotless uppercase version.

Optional circumflex accents can be used with &quot;â&quot;, &quot;î&quot; and &quot;û&quot; to disambiguate words with different meanings but otherwise the same spelling, or to indicate palatalisation of a preceding consonant (for example, while means &quot;snow&quot;, means &quot;profit&quot;), or long vowels in loanwords, particularly from Arabic.

=== Software localisation ===
In software development, the Turkish alphabet is known for requiring special logic, particularly due to the varieties of i and their lowercase and uppercase versions. This has been called the Turkish-I problem.

==History==

===Early reform proposals and alternate scripts===
The earliest known Turkic alphabet is the Orkhon script, also known as the Old Turkic alphabet, the first surviving evidence of which dates from the 7th century. In general, Turkic languages have been written in a number of different alphabets including Uyghur, Cyrillic, Arabic, Greek, Latin, and some other Asiatic writing systems.

Ottoman Turkish was written using a Turkish form of the Arabic script for over 1,000 years. It was poorly suited to write works that incorporated a great deal of Arabic and Persian vocabulary as their spellings were largely unphonetic and thus had to be memorized. This created a significant barrier of entry as only highly formal and prestige versions of Turkish were top heavy in Arabic and Persian vocabulary. Not only would students have trouble predicting the spellings of certain Arabic and Persian words, but some of these words were so rarely used in common speech that their spellings would not register in the collective conscious of students. However, it was much better suited to the Turkish part of the vocabulary. Although Ottoman Turkish was never formally standardized by a decree of law, words of Turkic origin largely had de facto systematic spelling rules associated with them which made it easier to read and write. On the rare occasion a Turkic word had irregular spelling that had to be memorized, there was often a dialectal or historic phonetic rationale that would be validated by observing the speech of eastern dialects, Azeri, and Turkmen. Whereas Arabic is rich in consonants but poor in vowels, Turkish is the opposite; the script was thus inadequate at distinguishing certain Turkish vowels and the reader was forced to rely on context to differentiate certain words. The introduction of the telegraph in the 19th century exposed further weaknesses in the Arabic script, although this was buoyed to some degree by advances in the printing press and Ottoman Turkish keyboard typewriters.

Some Turkish reformists promoted the adoption of the Latin script well before Atatürk&#x27;s reforms. In 1862, during an earlier period of reform, the statesman Münuf Pasha advocated a reform of the alphabet. At the start of the 20th century similar proposals were made by several writers associated with the Young Turks movement, including Hüseyin Cahit, Abdullah Cevdet, and Celâl Nuri. The issue was raised again in 1923 during the first Economic Congress of the newly founded Turkish Republic, sparking a public debate that was to continue for several years.

A move away from the Arabic script was strongly opposed by conservative and religious elements. It was argued that Romanisation of the script would detach Turkey from the wider Islamic world, substituting a &quot;foreign&quot; (i.e. European) concept of national identity for the traditional sacred community. Others opposed Romanisation on practical grounds; at that time there was no suitable adaptation of the Latin script that could be used for Turkish phonemes. Some suggested that a better alternative might be to modify the Arabic script to introduce extra characters to better represent Turkish vowels. In 1926, however, the Turkic republics of the Soviet Union adopted the Latin script, giving a major boost to reformers in Turkey.

Turkish-speaking Armenians used the Mesrobian script to write the Bible and other books in Turkish for centuries. Karamanli Turkish was, similarly, written with a form of the Greek alphabet.

Atatürk himself had a longstanding conviction that the Turkish alphabet should be Latinised. He told Ruşen Eşref that he had been preoccupied with this idea during his time in Syria (1905-1907), and would later use a French-influenced Latinised rendering of Turkish in his private correspondence, as well as confide in Halide Edip in 1922 about his vision for a new alphabet. An early Latinisation of the Turkish language was made by Gyula Németh in his &quot;Türkische Grammatik&quot;, published in 1917, which had significant variations from the current script, for example using the Greek gamma where today&#x27;s &quot;ğ&quot; would be used. Hagop Martayan (later Dilâçar) brought this to Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s attention in the initial years after the books publication but Kemal did not like this transcription. The encounter with Martayan and looking at Németh&#x27;s transcription represented the first instance where Kemal would see a systematically Latinised version of Turkish.
===Introduction of the modern Turkish alphabet===
The current 29-letter Turkish alphabet was established as a personal initiative of the founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. It was a key step in the cultural part of Atatürk&#x27;s Reforms, introduced following his consolidation of power. Having established a one-party state ruled by his Republican People&#x27;s Party, Atatürk was able to sweep aside the previous opposition to implementing radical reform of the alphabet. He announced his plans in July 1928 and established a Language Commission () consisting of the following members:

* Ragıp Hulusi Özden
* İbrahim Grantay
* Ahmet Cevat Emre
* Mehmet Emin Erişirgil
* İhsan Sungu
* Avni Başman
* Falih Rıfkı Atay
* Ruşen Eşref Ünaydın
* Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoğlu

The commission was responsible for adapting the Latin script to meet the phonetic requirements of the Turkish language. The resulting Latin alphabet was designed to reflect the actual sounds of spoken Turkish, rather than simply transcribing the old Ottoman script into a new form.
Atatürk himself was personally involved with the commission and proclaimed an &quot;alphabet mobilisation&quot; to publicise the changes. He toured the country explaining the new system of writing and encouraging the rapid adoption of the new alphabet. The Language Commission proposed a five-year transition period; Atatürk saw this as far too long and reduced it to three months. The change was formalised by the Turkish Republic&#x27;s law number 1353, the &quot;Law on the Adoption and Implementation of the Turkish Alphabet&quot;, passed on 1 November 1928. Starting 1 December 1928, newspapers, magazines, subtitles in movies, advertisement and signs had to be written with the letters of the new alphabet. From 1 January 1929, the use of the new alphabet was compulsory in all public communications as well the internal communications of banks and political or social organisations. Books had to be printed with the new alphabet as of 1 January 1929 as well. The civil population was allowed to use the old alphabet in their transactions with the institutions until 1 June 1929.

In the Sanjak of Alexandretta (today&#x27;s province of Hatay), which was at that time under French control and would later join Turkey, the local Turkish-language newspapers adopted the Latin alphabet only in 1934.

The reforms were also backed up by the &quot;Law on Copyrights&quot;, issued in 1934, encouraging and strengthening the private publishing sector. In 1939, the &quot;First Turkish Publications Congress&quot; was organised in Ankara for discussing issues such as copyright, printing, progress on improving the literacy rate and scientific publications, with the attendance of 186 deputies.

===Political and cultural aspects===
As cited by the reformers, the old Arabic script was much more difficult to learn than the new Latin alphabet. The literacy rate did indeed increase greatly after the alphabet reform, from around 10% to over 90%, but many other factors also contributed to this increase, such as the foundation of the Turkish Language Association in 1932, campaigns by the Ministry of Education, the opening of Public Education Centres throughout the country, and Atatürk&#x27;s personal participation in literacy campaigns.

Atatürk also commented on one occasion that the symbolic meaning of the reform was for the Turkish nation to &quot;show with its script and mentality that it is on the side of world civilisation&quot;. The second president of Turkey, İsmet İnönü further elaborated the reason behind adopting a Latin alphabet:

The alphabet reform cannot be attributed to ease of reading and writing. That was the motive of Enver Pasha. For us, the big impact and the benefit of an alphabet reform was that it eased the way to cultural reform. We inevitably lost our connection with Arabic culture.
The Turkish writer Şerif Mardin has noted that &quot;Atatürk imposed the mandatory Latin alphabet in order to promote the national awareness of the Turks against a wider Muslim identity. It is also imperative to add that he hoped to relate Turkish nationalism to the modern civilisation of Western Europe, which embraced the Latin alphabet.&quot; The explicitly nationalistic and ideological character of the alphabet reform showed in the booklets issued by the government to teach the population the new script. They included sample phrases aimed at discrediting the Ottoman government and instilling updated Turkish values, such as: &quot;Atatürk allied himself with the nation and drove the sultans out of the homeland&quot;; &quot;Taxes are spent for the common properties of the nation. Tax is a debt we need to pay&quot;; &quot;It is the duty of every Turk to defend the homeland against the enemies.&quot; The alphabet reform was promoted as redeeming the Turkish people from the neglect of the Ottoman rulers: &quot;Sultans did not think of the public, Ghazi commander [Atatürk] saved the nation from enemies and slavery. And now, he declared a campaign against ignorance [illiteracy]. He armed the nation with the new Turkish alphabet.&quot;

The historian Bernard Lewis has described the introduction of the new alphabet as &quot;not so much practical as pedagogical, as social and cultural – and Mustafa Kemal, in forcing his people to accept it, was slamming a door on the past as well as opening a door to the future&quot;. It was accompanied by a systematic effort to rid the Turkish language of Arabic and Persian loanwords, often replacing them with revived early Turkic words. However, the same reform also rid the language of many Western loanwords, especially French, in favor of Turkic words, albeit to a lesser degree. Atatürk told his friend Falih Rıfkı Atay, who was on the government&#x27;s Language Commission, that by carrying out the reform, &quot;we were going to cleanse the Turkish mind from its Arabic roots.&quot;

Yaşar Nabi, a leading journalist, argued in the 1960s that the alphabet reform had been vital in creating a new Western-oriented identity for Turkey. He noted that younger Turks, who had only been taught the Latin script, were at ease in understanding Western culture but were quite unable to engage with Middle Eastern culture. The new script was adopted very rapidly and soon gained widespread acceptance. Even so, older people continued to use the Turkish Arabic script in private correspondence, notes and diaries until well into the 1960s.

The first is known as Turkish F, designed in 1955 by the leadership of İhsan Sıtkı Yener (tr) with an organization based on letter frequency in Turkish words. The second as Turkish Q, an adaptation of the QWERTY keyboard to include six additional letters found in the Turkish language.

<text>Śūnyatā ( ; ; ), translated most often as &quot;emptiness&quot;, &quot;vacuity&quot;, and sometimes &quot;voidness&quot;, or &quot;nothingness&quot; is an Indian philosophical concept. In Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism, and other Indian philosophical traditions, the concept has multiple meanings depending on its doctrinal context. It is either an ontological feature of reality, a meditative state, or a phenomenological analysis of experience.
In Theravāda Buddhism, &#x27; often refers to the [[Anatta|non-self]] (Pāli:&#x27;, Sanskrit: &#x27;) nature of the [[Skandha|five aggregates of experience]] and the [[Āyatana|six sense spheres]].&#x27; is also often used to refer to a meditative state or experience.

In Mahāyāna Buddhism, &quot;&quot; refers to the tenet that &quot;all things are empty of intrinsic existence and nature (&quot;svabhava&quot;)&quot;, but may also refer to the Buddha-nature teachings and primordial or empty awareness, as in Dzogchen, Shentong, or Chan.

==Etymology==
&quot;Śūnyatā&quot; is usually translated as &quot;devoidness&quot;, &quot;emptiness&quot;, &quot;hollow&quot;, &quot;hollowness&quot;, &quot;voidness&quot;. It is the noun form of the adjective &#x27;, plus &#x27;: 
* &quot;,&quot; in the context of buddha dharma, primarily means &quot;empty&quot;, or &quot;void,&quot; but also means &quot;zero,&quot; and &quot;nothing,&quot; and derives from the root &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;hollow&quot;
* &quot;&quot; is a suffix denoting a quality or state of being, equivalent to English &quot;-ness&quot;

==Development of the concept==
The concept of &quot;śūnyatā&quot; as &quot;emptiness&quot; is related to the concept of &quot;anatta&quot; in early Buddhism. Over time, many different philosophical schools or tenet-systems (Sanskrit: &quot;siddhānta&quot;) have developed within Buddhism in an effort to explain the exact philosophical meaning of emptiness.

After the Buddha, emptiness was further developed by the Abhidharma schools, Nāgārjuna and the Mādhyamaka school, an early Mahāyāna school. Emptiness (&quot;positively&quot; interpreted) is also an important element of the Buddha-nature literature, which played a formative role in the evolution of subsequent Mahāyāna doctrine and practice.

==Early Buddhism==
=== Pāli Nikāyas ===
The Pāli Canon uses the term &quot;śūnyatā&quot; (&quot;emptiness&quot;) in three ways: as a meditative dwelling; as an attribute of objects; and as a type of awareness-release.

According to Bhikkhu Analayo, in the Pāli Canon &quot;the adjective suñña occurs with a much higher frequency than the corresponding noun suññatā&quot; and emphasizes seeing phenomena as &#x27;being empty&#x27; instead of an abstract idea of &quot;emptiness&quot;.

One example of this usage is in the &quot;Pheṇapiṇḍūpama Sutta&quot; (SN 22:95), which states that on close inspection, each of the five aggregates are seen as being void (&quot;rittaka&quot;), hollow (&quot;tucchaka&quot;), coreless (&quot;asāraka&quot;). In the text a series of contemplations is given for each aggregate: form is like &quot;a lump of foam&quot; (&quot;pheṇapiṇḍa&quot;); sensation like &quot;a water bubble&quot; (&quot;bubbuḷa&quot;); perception like &quot;a mirage&quot; (&quot;marici&quot;); formations like &quot;a plantain tree&quot; (&quot;kadalik-khandha&quot;); and cognition like &quot;a magical illusion&quot; (&quot;māyā&quot;).

According to Shi Huifeng, the terms &quot;void&quot; (&quot;rittaka&quot;), &quot;hollow&quot; (&quot;tucchaka&quot;), and &quot;coreless&quot; (&quot;asāraka&quot;) are also used in the early texts to refer to words and things which are deceptive, false, vain, and worthless. This sense of worthlessness and vacuousness is also found in other uses of the term &quot;māyā&quot;, such as the following:&quot;Monks, sensual pleasures are impermanent, hollow, false, deceptive; they are illusory (&quot;māyākatame&quot;), the prattle of fools.&quot;The &quot;Suñña Sutta&quot;, part of the Pāli Canon, relates that the monk Ānanda, Buddha&#x27;s attendant, asked,It is said that the world is empty, the world is empty, lord. In what respect is it said that the world is empty?&quot; The Buddha replied, &quot;In so far as it is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self: Thus it is said, Ānanda, that the world is empty.&quot;According to the American monastic Thanissaro Bhikku:

====Meditative state====

Emptiness as a meditative state is said to be reached when &quot;not attending to any themes, he [the bhikkhu] enters &amp; remains in internal emptiness&quot; (MN 122). This meditative dwelling is developed through the &quot;four formless states&quot; of meditation or Arūpajhānas and then through &quot;themeless concentration of awareness&quot;.

The &quot;Cūlasuññata-sutta&quot; (MN III 104) and the &quot;Mahāsuññata-sutta&quot; (MN III 109) outline how a monk can &quot;dwell in emptiness&quot; through a gradual step-by-step mental cultivation process, they both stress the importance of the impermanence of mental states and the absence of a self.

In the &quot;Kāmabhu Sutta&quot; S IV.293, it is explained that a bhikkhu can experience a trancelike contemplation in which perception and feeling cease. When he emerges from this state, he recounts three types of &quot;contact&quot; (&quot;phasso&quot;):
# &quot;emptiness&quot; (&quot;suññato&quot;),
# &quot;signless&quot; (&quot;animitto&quot;),
# &quot;undirected&quot; (&quot;appaihito&quot;).
The meaning of emptiness as contemplated here is explained at M I.297 and S IV.296-97 as the &quot;emancipation of the mind by emptiness&quot; (&quot;suññatā cetovimutti&quot;) being consequent upon the realization that &quot;this world is empty of self or anything pertaining to self&quot; (&quot;suññam ida attena vā attaniyena vā&quot;).

The term &quot;emptiness&quot; (&quot;suññatā&quot;) is also used in two suttas in the &quot;Majjhima Nikāya&quot;, in the context of a progression of mental states. The texts refer to each state&#x27;s emptiness of the one below.

===Chinese Āgamas===

The Chinese Āgamas contain various parallels to the &quot;Pheṇapiṇḍūpama Sutta&quot;. One partial parallel from the Ekottara Āgama describes the body with different metaphors: &quot;a ball of snow&quot;, &quot;a heap of dirt&quot;, &quot;a mirage&quot;, &quot;an illusion&quot; (&quot;māyā&quot;), or &quot;an empty fist used to fool a child&quot;. In a similar vein, the Mūla-Sarvāstivādin &quot;Māyājāla Sūtra&quot;, gives two sets of metaphors for each of the sensory consciousnesses to illustrate their vain, illusory character.

Other Sarvāstivādin Āgama sutras (extant in Chinese) which have emptiness as a theme include Samyukta Āgama 335 - &quot;Paramārtha-śunyatā-sūtra&quot; (&quot;Sutra on ultimate emptiness&quot;) and Samyukta Āgama 297 - &quot;Mahā-śunyatā-dharma-paryāya&quot; (&quot;Greater discourse on emptiness&quot;). These sutras have no parallel Pāli suttas. These sutras associate emptiness with dependent origination, which shows that this relation of the two terms was already established in pre-Nagarjuna sources. The sutra on great emptiness states:

The phrase &quot;when this exists ...&quot; is a common gloss on dependent origination. Sarvāstivādin Āgamas also speak of a certain &quot;emptiness samadhi&quot; (&quot;śūnyatāsamādhi&quot;) as well as stating that all dharmas are &quot;classified as conventional&quot;.

Mun-Keat Choong and Yin Shun have both published studies on the various uses of emptiness in the Early Buddhist texts (Pāli Canon and Chinese Āgamas). Choong has also published a collection of translations of Āgama sutras from the Chinese on the topic of emptiness.

==Early Buddhist schools and Abhidharma==
Many of the early Buddhist schools featured &quot;śūnyatā&quot; as an important part of their teachings.

The Sarvastivadin school&#x27;s Abhidharma texts like the &quot;Dharmaskandhapāda Śāstra&quot;, and the later &quot;Mahāvibhāṣa&quot;, also take up the theme of emptiness vis-a-vis dependent origination as found in the Agamas.

Schools such as the Mahāsāṃghika Prajñaptivādins as well as many of the Sthavira schools (except the Pudgalavada) held that all dharmas were empty (&quot;dharma śūnyatā&quot;). This can be seen in the early Theravada Abhidhamma texts such as the &quot;Patisambhidamagga&quot;, which also speak of the emptiness of the five aggregates and of svabhava as being &quot;empty of essential nature&quot;. The Theravada &quot;Kathavatthu&quot; also argues against the idea that emptiness is unconditioned. The &quot;Mahāvastu&quot;, an influential Mahāsāṃghika work, states that the Buddha&quot;has shown that the aggregates are like a lightning flash, as a bubble, or as the white foam on a wave.&quot;One of the main themes of Harivarman&#x27;s Tattvasiddhi-Śāstra (3rd-4th century) is &quot;dharma-śūnyatā&quot;, the emptiness of phenomena.

== Theravāda ==

Theravāda Buddhists generally take the view that emptiness is merely the not-self nature of the five aggregates. Emptiness is an important door to liberation in the Theravāda tradition just as it is in Mahayana, according to Insight meditation teacher Gil Fronsdal. The classic Theravāda text known as the &quot;Patisambhidamagga&quot; (c. 3rd century BCE) describes the five aggregates as being empty (&quot;suññam&quot;) of essence or intrinsic nature (&quot;sabhava&quot;). The &quot;Patisambhidamagga&quot; also equates not-self with the emptiness liberation in a passage also cited by Buddhaghosa in the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot; (Vism XXI 70):&quot;When one who has great wisdom brings [volitional formations] to mind as not-self, he acquires the emptiness liberation&quot; -Patis. II 58.The &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot; (c. 5th century CE)&quot;,&quot; the most influential classical Theravāda treatise, states that not-self does not become apparent because it is concealed by &quot;compactness&quot; when one does not give attention to the various elements which make up the person. The &quot;Paramatthamañjusa Visuddhimaggatika&quot; of Acariya Dhammapala, a 5th-century Theravāda commentary on the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot;, comments on this passage by referring to the fact that we often assume unity and compactness regarding phenomena or functions which are instead made up of various elements, but when one sees that these are merely empty dhammas, one can understand the not-self characteristic:&quot;when they are seen after resolving them by means of knowledge into these elements, they disintegrate like froth subjected to compression by the hand. They are mere states (&quot;dhamma&quot;) occurring due to conditions and void. In this way the characteristic of not-self becomes more evident.&quot;The modern Thai teacher Buddhadasa referred to emptiness as the &quot;innermost heart&quot; of the Buddhist teachings and the cure for the disease of suffering. He stated that emptiness, as it relates to the practice of Dhamma, can be seen both &quot;as the absence of Dukkha and the defilements that are the cause of Dukkha and as the absence of the feeling that there is a self or that there are things which are the possessions of a self.&quot; He also equated nibbana with emptiness, writing that &quot;Nibbana, the remainderless extinction of Dukkha, means the same as supreme emptiness.&quot; Emptiness is also seen as a mode of perception which lacks all the usual conceptual elaborations we usually add on top of our experiences, such as the sense of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;Mine&quot;. According to Thanissaro Bhikku, emptiness is not so much a metaphysical view, as it is a strategic mode of acting and of seeing the world which leads to liberation:Emptiness is a mode of perception, a way of looking at experience. It adds nothing to and takes nothing away from the raw data of physical and mental events. You look at events in the mind and the senses with no thought of whether there&#x27;s anything lying behind them.
This mode is called emptiness because it&#x27;s empty of the presuppositions we usually add to experience to make sense of it: the stories and world-views we fashion to explain who we are and the world we live in. Although these stories and views have their uses, the Buddha found that some of the more abstract questions they raise — of our true identity and the reality of the world outside — pull attention away from a direct experience of how events influence one another in the immediate present. Thus they get in the way when we try to understand and solve the problem of suffering.

Some Theravādins, such as David Kalupahana, see Nagarjuna&#x27;s view of emptiness as compatible with the Pali Canon. In his analysis of the &quot;Mulamadhyamikakarika&quot;, Kalupahana sees Nagarjuna&#x27;s argument as rooted in the Kaccānagotta Sutta (which Nagarjuna cites by name). Kalupahana states that Nagarjuna&#x27;s major goal was to discredit heterodox views of Svabhava (own-nature) held by the Sarvastivadins and establish the non-substantiality of all dharmas. According to Peter Harvey, the Theravāda view of dhammas and sabhava is not one of essences, but merely descriptive characteristics and hence is not the subject of Madhyamaka critique developed by Nagarjuna (see below).

In Theravāda, emptiness as an approach to meditation is also seen as a state in which one is &quot;empty of disturbance.&quot; This form of meditation is one in which meditators become concentrated and focus on the absence or presence of disturbances in their minds; if they find a disturbance they notice it and allow it to drop away; this leads to deeper states of calmness. Emptiness is also seen as a way to look at sense-experience that does not identify with the &quot;I-making&quot; and &quot;my-making&quot; process of the mind. As a form of meditation, this is developed by perceiving the six sense-spheres and their objects as empty of any self, this leads to a formless jhana of nothingness and a state of equanimity.

Mathew Kosuta sees the Abhidhamma teachings of the modern Thai teacher Ajaan Sujin Boriharnwanaket as being very similar to the Mahayana emptiness view.

==Mahayana Buddhism==

There are two main sources of Indian Buddhist discussions of emptiness: the Mahayana sutra literature, which is traditionally believed to be the word of the Buddha in Mahayana Buddhism, and the shastra literature, which was composed by Buddhist scholars and philosophers.

=== Prajñāpāramitā sūtras ===
The Prajñāpāramitā (Perfection of Wisdom) Sutras taught that all entities, including &quot;dharmas&quot;, are empty of self, essential core, or intrinsic nature (&quot;svabhava&quot;), being only conceptual existents or constructs. The notion of prajña (wisdom, knowledge) presented in these sutras is a deep non-conceptual understanding of emptiness. The Prajñāpāramitā sutras also use various metaphors to explain the nature of things as emptiness, stating that things are like &quot;illusions&quot; (&quot;māyā&quot;) and &quot;dreams&quot; (&quot;svapna&quot;). The &quot;Astasahasrika Prajñaparamita,&quot; possibly the earliest of these sutras&quot;,&quot; states:

If he knows the five aggregates as like an illusion, But makes not illusion one thing, and the aggregates another; If, freed from the notion of multiple things, he courses in peace— Then that is his practice of wisdom, the highest perfection.

Perceiving dharmas and beings like an illusion (&quot;māyādharmatām&quot;) is termed the &quot;great armor&quot; (&quot;mahāsaṃnaha&quot;) of the Bodhisattva, who is also termed the &#x27;illusory man&#x27; (&quot;māyāpuruṣa&quot;). The &quot;Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; adds the following similes to describe how all conditioned things are to be contemplated: like a bubble, a shadow, like dew or a flash of lightning. In the worldview of these sutras, though we perceive a world of concrete and discrete objects, these objects are &quot;empty&quot; of the identity imputed by their designated labels. In that sense, they are deceptive and like an illusion. The Perfection of Wisdom texts constantly repeat that nothing can be found to ultimately exist in some fundamental way. This applies even to the highest Buddhist concepts (bodhisattvas, bodhicitta, and even prajña itself). Even nirvana itself is said to be empty and like a dream or magical illusion.

In a famous passage, the Heart sutra, a later but influential Prajñāpāramitā text, directly states that the five skandhas (along with the five senses, the mind, and the four noble truths) are said to be &quot;empty&quot; (&quot;sunya&quot;):In the Prajñāpāramitā sutras the knowledge of emptiness, i.e. prajñāpāramitā is said to be the fundamental virtue of the bodhisattva, who is said to stand on emptiness by not standing (-stha) on any other dharma (phenomena). Bodhisattvas who practice this perfection of wisdom are said to have several qualities such as the &quot;not taking up&quot; (&quot;aparigṛhīta&quot;) and non-apprehension (&quot;anupalabdhi&quot;) of anything, non-attainment (&quot;aprapti&quot;), not-settling down (&quot;anabhinivesa&quot;) and not relying on any signs (&quot;nimitta,&quot; mental impressions). Bodhisattvas are also said to be free of fear in the face of the ontological groundlessness of the emptiness doctrine which can easily shock others.

=== Mādhyamaka school ===

Mādhyamaka is a Mahāyāna Buddhist school of philosophy which focuses on the analysis of emptiness, and was thus also known as &quot;śūnyatavāda&quot;. The school is traditionally seen as being founded by the Indian Buddhist philosopher Nāgārjuna.

Nāgārjuna&#x27;s goal was to refute the essentialism of certain Abhidharma schools and the Hindu Nyaya school. His best-known work is the &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; (MMK), in which he used &quot;reductio&quot; arguments (Skt: &quot;prasanga&quot;) to show the non-substantiality of everything. Nāgārjuna equated the emptiness of dharmas with their dependent origination, and thus with their being devoid any permanent substance or primary, substantial existence (&quot;svabhava&quot;). Nāgārjuna writes in the MMK:

We state that conditioned origination is emptiness. It is mere designation depending on something, and it is the middle path. (24.18) 

Since nothing has arisen without depending on something, there is nothing that is not empty. (24.19)

Nāgārjuna&#x27;s Mādhyamaka states that since things have the nature of lacking true existence or own being (&quot;niḥsvabhāva&quot;), all things are mere conceptual constructs (&quot;prajñaptimatra&quot;) because they are just impermanent collections of causes and conditions. Because of this, Mādhyamaka is also known as &quot;Niḥsvabhāvavāda&quot;. This also applies to the principle of causality itself, since &quot;everything&quot; is dependently originated. If one is unaware of this, things may seem to arise as existents, remain for a time and then subsequently perish. In reality, dependently originated phenomena do not arise or remain as inherently existent phenomena and yet they still appear as a flow of conceptual constructs.&lt; Thus both existence and nihilism are ruled out. Any enduring essential nature would prevent the process of dependent origination, or any kind of origination at all. For things would simply always have been, and will always continue to be, without any change. For Nāgārjuna, the realization of emptiness is a key understanding which allows one to reach liberation because it is nothing but the elimination of ignorance.

There has been significant debate, both in ancient India and in modern scholarship, as to how to interpret Mādhyamaka and whether it is nihilistic (a claim that Mādhyamaka thinkers vehemently denied). Some scholars like F. Shcherbatskoy have also interpreted emptiness as described by Nāgārjuna as a Buddhist transcendental absolute, while other scholars such as David Kalupahana consider this interpretation to be a mistake. According to Paul Williams, Nāgārjuna associates emptiness with the ultimate truth but his conception of emptiness is not some kind of Absolute, but rather it is the very absence of true existence with regards to the conventional reality of things and events in the world.

For Nāgārjuna the phenomenal world is the limited truth (&quot;samvrtisatya&quot;) and does not really exist in the highest reality (&quot;paramarthasatya&quot;) and yet it has a kind of conventional reality which has its uses for reaching liberation. This limited truth includes everything, including the Buddha himself, the teachings (Dharma), liberation and even Nāgārjuna&#x27;s own arguments. This two-truth schema which did not deny the importance of convention allowed him to defend himself against charges of nihilism. Because of his philosophical work, Nāgārjuna is seen by some modern interpreters as restoring the Middle Way of the Buddha, which had become influenced by absolutist metaphysical tendencies of schools like the Vaibhasika.

Nāgārjuna is also famous for arguing that his philosophy of emptiness was not a view, and that he in fact did not take any position or thesis whatsoever since this would just be another form of clinging. In his &quot;Vigrahavyavartani&quot; Nāgārjuna outright states that he has no thesis (&quot;pratijña&quot;) to prove. This idea would become a central point of debate for later Mādhyamaka philosophers. After Nāgārjuna, his pupil Āryadeva (3rd century CE) commented on and expanded Nāgārjuna&#x27;s system. An influential commentator on Nāgārjuna was Buddhapālita (470–550) who has been interpreted as developing the &#x27;prāsaṅgika&#x27; approach to Nāgārjuna&#x27;s works, which argues that Madhyamaka critiques of essentialism are done only through reductio ad absurdum arguments. Like Nāgārjuna, instead of putting forth any positive position of his own, Buddhapālita merely seeks to show how all philosophical positions are untenable and self contradictory without putting forth a positive thesis.

Buddhapālita is often contrasted with the works of Bhāvaviveka (c. 500 – c. 578), who argued for the use of logical arguments using the pramana-based epistemology of Indian logicians like Dignāga. Bhāvaviveka argued that Madhyamika&#x27;s could put forth positive arguments of one&#x27;s own, instead of just criticizing others&#x27; arguments, a tactic called &quot;vitaṇḍā&quot; (attacking) which was seen in bad form in Indian philosophical circles. He argued that the position of a Mādhyamaka was simply that phenomena are devoid of inherent nature. This approach has been labeled the svātantrika style of Madhyamaka by Tibetan philosophers and commentators. Another influential commentator, Candrakīrti (c. 600–650), critiqued Bhāvaviveka&#x27;s adoption of the pramana tradition on the grounds that it contained a subtle essentialism and argued that Mādhyamikas must make no positive assertions and need not construct formal arguments.

=== Yogācāra school ===

The central text of the Yogācāra school, the &quot;Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra&quot;, explains emptiness in terms of the three natures theory, stating that its purpose is to &quot;establish the doctrine of the three-own-beings (&quot;trisvabhāva&quot;) in terms of their lack of own-nature (&quot;niḥsvabhāvatā&quot;).&quot; According to Andrew Skilton, in Yogācāra, emptiness is the &quot;absence of duality between perceiving subject (lit. &quot;grasper&quot;, Skt: &quot;grāhaka,&quot; Tib: &quot;&#x27;dzin-pa&quot;) and the perceived object (&quot;grasped&quot;, Skt: &quot;grāhya,&quot; Tib: &quot;bzhung-ba&quot;).&quot; This is seen in the following quote from the &quot;Madhyāntavibhāga:&quot; There exists the imagination of the unreal, there is no duality, but there is emptiness, even in this there is that.In his commentary, the Indian Yogācāra philosopher Vasubandhu explains that imagination of the unreal (&quot;abhūta-parikalpa&quot;) is the &quot;discrimination between the duality of grasped and grasper.&quot; Emptiness is said to be &quot;the imagination of the unreal that is lacking in the form of being graspable or grasper.&quot; Thus in Yogacara, it can be said that emptiness is mainly that subject and object and all experiences which are seen in the subject–object modality are empty.

According to Yogācāra thought, everything we conceive of is the result of the working of the Eight Consciousnesses. The &quot;things&quot; we are conscious of are &quot;mere concepts&quot; (&quot;vijñapti&quot;), not &#x27;the thing in itself&#x27;. In this sense, our experiences are empty and false, they do not reveal the true nature of things as an enlightened person would see them, which would be non-dual, without the imputed subject object distinction.

The Yogācāra school philosophers Asaṅga and Vasubandhu criticized those in the Madhyamika school who &quot;adhere to non-existence&quot; (&quot;nāstikas, vaināśkas&quot;) and sought to move away from their negative interpretation of emptiness because they feared any philosophy of &#x27;universal denial&#x27; (&quot;sarva-vaināśika&quot;) would stray into &#x27;nihilism&#x27; (&quot;ucchedavāda&quot;), an extreme which was not the middle way. Yogacarins differed from Madhyamikas in positing that there really was something which could be said to &#x27;exist&#x27; in experience, namely some kind of nonobjective and empty perception. This Yogacara conception of emptiness, which states that there is &quot;something&quot; that exists (mainly, &quot;vijñapti&quot;, mental construction), and that it is empty, can be seen in the following statement of Vasubandhu:Thus, when something is absent [in a receptacle], then one, seeing that [receptacle] as devoid of that thing, perceives that [receptacle] as it is, and recognises that [receptacle], which is left over, as it is, namely as something truly existing there.This tendency can also be seen in Asaṅga, who argues in his &quot;Bodhisattvabhūmi&quot; that there must be something that exists which is described as empty:Emptiness is logical when one thing is devoid of another because of that [other&#x27;s] absence and because of the presence of the empty thing itself.Asaṅga also states:The nonexistence of duality is indeed the existence of nonexistence; this is the definition of emptiness. It is neither existence, nor nonexistence, neither different nor identical.This &quot;existence of nonexistence&quot; definition of emptiness can also be seen in Asaṅga&#x27;s &quot;Abhidharmasamuccaya&quot; where he states that emptiness is &quot;the non-existence of the self, and the existence of the no-self.&quot;

In the sixth century, scholarly debates between Yogacarins and Madhyamikas centered on the status and reality of the &quot;paratantra-svabhāva&quot; (the &quot;dependent nature&quot;), with Madhyamika&#x27;s like Bhāvaviveka criticizing the views of Yogacarins like Dharmapāla of Nalanda as reifying dependent origination.

===Buddha-nature===
An influential division of 1st-millennium CE Buddhist texts develop the notion of &quot;Tathāgatagarbha&quot; or Buddha-nature. The &quot;Tathāgatagarbha&quot; doctrine, at its earliest, probably appeared about the later part of the 3rd century CE, and is verifiable in Chinese translations of 1st millennium CE.

The &quot;Tathāgatagarbha&quot; is the topic of the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha sūtras&quot;, where the title itself means a &quot;garbha&quot; (womb, matrix, seed) containing &quot;Tathāgata&quot; (Buddha). In the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha sūtras&quot; the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self. The ultimate goal of the path is characterized using a range of positive language that had been used in Indian philosophy previously by essentialist philosophers, but which was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary to describe a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.

These Sutras suggest, states Paul Williams, that &#x27;all sentient beings contain a &quot;Tathāgata&quot; as their &#x27;essence, core or essential inner nature&#x27;. They also present a further developed understanding of emptiness, wherein the Buddha-nature, the Buddha and Liberation are seen as transcending the realm of emptiness, i.e. of the conditioned and dependently originated phenomena.

One of these texts, the &quot;Angulimaliya Sutra,&quot; contrasts between empty phenomena such as the moral and emotional afflictions (&quot;kleshas&quot;), which are like ephemeral hailstones, and the enduring, eternal Buddha, which is like a precious gem:

The &quot;Śrīmālā Sūtra&quot; is one of the earliest texts on &quot;Tathāgatagarbha&quot; thought, composed in the 3rd century in south India, according to Brian Brown. It asserted that everyone can potentially attain Buddhahood, and warns against the doctrine of &quot;Śūnyatā&quot;. The &quot;Śrīmālā Sūtra&quot; posits that the Buddha-nature is ultimately identifiable as the supramundane nature of the Buddha, the &quot;garbha&quot; is the ground for Buddha-nature, this nature is unborn and undying, has ultimate existence, has no beginning nor end, is nondual, and permanent. The text also adds that the &quot;garbha&quot; has &quot;no self, soul or personality&quot; and &quot;incomprehensible to anyone distracted by sunyata (voidness)&quot;; rather it is the support for phenomenal existence.

The notion of Buddha-nature and its interpretation was and continues to be widely debated in all schools of Mahayana Buddhism. Some traditions interpret the doctrine to be equivalent to emptiness (like the Tibetan Gelug school); the positive language of the texts &quot;Tathāgatagarbha sutras&quot; are then interpreted as being of provisional meaning, and not ultimately true. Other schools, however (mainly the Jonang school), see &quot;Tathāgatagarbha&quot; as being an ultimate teaching and see it as an eternal, true self, while &quot;Śūnyatā&quot; is seen as a provisional, lower teaching.

Likewise, western scholars have been divided in their interpretation of the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha,&quot; since the doctrine of an &#x27;essential nature&#x27; in every living being appears to be confusing, since it seems to be equivalent to a &#x27;Self&#x27;, which seems to contradict the doctrines in a vast majority of Buddhist texts. Some scholars, however, view such teachings as metaphorical, not to be taken literally.

According to some scholars, the Buddha-nature which these sutras discuss does not represent a substantial self (&quot;ātman&quot;). Rather, it is a positive expression of emptiness, and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. In this view, the intention of the teaching of Buddha-nature is soteriological rather than theoretical. According to others, the potential of salvation depends on the ontological reality of a salvific, abiding core reality – the Buddha-nature, empty of all mutability and error, fully present within all beings. Japanese scholars of the &quot;Critical Buddhism&quot; movement meanwhile see Buddha-nature as an essentialist and thus an un-Buddhist idea.

===Tibetan Buddhism===

In Tibetan Buddhism, emptiness (Wylie: &quot;stong-pa nyid&quot;) is mainly interpreted through the lens of Mādhyamaka philosophy, though the Yogacara- and Tathāgatagarbha-influenced interpretations are also influential. The interpretations of the Indian Mādhyamaka philosopher Candrakīrti are the dominant views on emptiness in Tibetan Buddhist philosophy.

In Tibet, a distinction also began to be made between the autonomist (&quot;svātantrika, rang rgyud pa&quot;) and consequentialist (&quot;prāsaṅgika, thal &#x27;gyur pa&quot;) approaches to Mādhyamaka reasoning about emptiness. The distinction was invented by Tibetan scholarship, and not one made by classical Indian Madhyamikas.

Further Tibetan philosophical developments began in response to the works of the influential scholar Dolpopa (1292–1361) and led to two distinctly opposed Tibetan Mādhyamaka views on the nature of emptiness and ultimate reality.

One of these is the view termed &quot;shentong&quot; (Wylie: &quot;gzhan stong,&quot; &#x27;other empty&#x27;), which is a further development of Indian Yogacara-Madhyamaka and the Buddha-nature teachings by Dolpopa, and is primarily promoted in the Jonang, Nyingma, and modern Kagyu schools. This view states that ultimate reality is empty of the conventional, but it is itself &quot;not&quot; empty of being ultimate Buddhahood and the luminous nature of mind. Dolpopa considered his view a form of Mādhyamaka, and called his system &quot;Great Mādhyamaka&quot;. In Jonang, this ultimate reality is a &quot;ground or substratum&quot; which is &quot;uncreated and indestructible, noncomposite and beyond the chain of dependent origination.&quot;

Dolpopa was roundly critiqued for his claims about emptiness and his view that they were a kind of Mādhyamaka. His critics include Tibetan philosophers such as the founder of the Gelug school Je Tsongkhapa (1357–1419) and Mikyö Dorje, the 8th Karmapa of the Karma Kagyu (1507–1554).

&quot;Rangtong&quot; (Wylie: &quot;rang stong&quot;; &#x27;self-empty&#x27;) refers to views which oppose &quot;shentong&quot; and state that ultimate reality is that which is empty of self-nature in a relative and absolute sense; that is to say ultimate reality is empty of everything, including itself. It is thus not a transcendental ground or metaphysical absolute, but just the absence of true existence (&quot;svabhava&quot;). This view has sometimes been applied to the Gelug school because they tend to hold that emptiness is &quot;an absolute negation&quot; (&quot;med dgag&quot;).

However, many Tibetan philosophers reject these terms as descriptions of their views on emptiness. The Sakya thinker Gorampa Sonam Senge (1429-1489), for example, called his version of Mādhyamaka, &quot;freedom from extremes&quot; or &quot;freedom from proliferations&quot; (&quot;spros bral&quot;) and claimed that the ultimate truth was ineffable, beyond predication or concept. For Gorampa, emptiness is not just the absence of inherent existence, but it is the absence of the four extremes in all phenomena i.e. existence, nonexistence, both and neither (see: &quot;catuskoti&quot;).

The 14th Dalai Lama, who generally speaks from the Gelug perspective, states:

===Chinese Buddhism===
==== Sānlùn school ====

When Buddhism was introduced in China it was initially understood in terms of indigenous Chinese philosophical culture. Because of this, emptiness (Ch., &quot;kong&quot;, 空;) was at first understood as pointing to a kind of transcendental reality similar to the Tao. It took several centuries to realize that &quot;śūnyatā&quot; does not refer to an essential transcendental reality underneath or behind the world of appearances.

Chinese Mādhyamaka (known as &quot;Sānlùn,&quot; or the &quot;three treatise school&quot;) began with the work of Kumārajīva (344–413 CE) who translated the works of Nāgārjuna into Chinese. &quot;Sānlùn&quot; figures like Kumārajīva&#x27;s pupil Sengzhao (384–414), and the later Jizang (549–623) were influential in introducing a more orthodox and non-essentialist interpretation of emptiness to Chinese Buddhism. Sengzhao argues, for example, that the nature of phenomena could not be said to be either existent or non-existent and that it was necessary to go beyond conceptual proliferation to realize emptiness. Jizang (549–623) was another central figure in Chinese Madhyamaka who wrote numerous commentaries on Nāgārjuna and Aryadeva and is considered to be the leading representative of the school. Jizang called his method &quot;deconstructing what is misleading and revealing what is corrective&quot;. He insisted that one must never settle on any particular viewpoint or perspective but constantly reexamine one&#x27;s formulations to avoid reifications of thought and behavior.

In the modern era, one major Chinese figure who has written on Mādhyamaka is the scholar monk Yin Shun (1906–2005)&quot;.&quot;

==== Tiantai and Huayan ====
Later Chinese philosophers developed their own unique interpretations of emptiness. One of these was Zhiyi, the intellectual founder of the Tiantai school, who was strongly influenced by the Lotus sutra. The Tiantai view of emptiness and dependent origination is inseparable from their view of the &quot;interfusion of phenomena&quot; and the idea that the ultimate reality is an absolute totality of all particular things which are &quot;Neither-Same-Nor-Different&quot; from each other.

In Tiantai metaphysics, every event, function, or characteristic is the product of the interfusion of all others, the whole is in the particular and every particular event/function is also in every other particular. This also leads to the conclusion that all phenomena are &quot;findable&quot; in each and every other phenomena, even seemingly conflicting phenomena such as good and evil or delusion and enlightenment are interfused with each other.

The Huayan school understood emptiness and ultimate reality through the similar idea of interpenetration or &quot;coalescence&quot; (Wylie: &quot;zung-&#x27;jug&quot;; Sanskrit: &quot;yuganaddha&quot;), using the concept of Indra&#x27;s net to illustrate this.

====Chán====

Chan Buddhism was influenced by all the previous Chinese Buddhist currents. The Mādhyamaka of Sengzhao, for example, influenced the views of the Chan patriarch Shen Hui (670-762), a critical figure in the development of Chan, as can be seen by his &quot;Illuminating the Essential Doctrine&quot; (&quot;Hsie Tsung Chi&quot;). This text emphasizes that true emptiness or Suchness cannot be known through thought since it is free from thought (&quot;wu-nien&quot;). Shen Hui also states that true emptiness is not nothing, but it is a &quot;Subtle Existence&quot; (&quot;miao-yu&quot;), which is just &quot;Great Prajña.&quot;

The Chinese Chan presentation of emptiness, influenced by Yogacara and the Tathāgatagarbha sutras, also used more positive language and poetic metaphors to describe the nature of emptiness. For example, Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091–1157), a key figure in the Caodong lineage, wrote:&quot;The field of boundless emptiness is what exists from the very beginning. You must purify, cure, grind down, or brush away all the tendencies you have fabricated into apparent habits. [Those tendencies are the clouds in our eyes.] Then you can reside in a clear circle of brightness. Utter emptiness has no image. Upright independence does not rely on anything. Just expand and illuminate the original truth unconcerned by external conditions. Accordingly, we are told to realize that not a single thing exists. In this field birth and death do not appear. The deep source, transparent down to the bottom, can radiantly shine and can respond unencumbered to each speck of dust [each object] without becoming its partner. The subtlety of seeing and hearing transcends mere colors and sounds. The whole affair functions without leaving traces and mirrors without obscurations. Very naturally, mind and Dharmas emerge and harmonize.&quot; &quot;Vast and far-reaching without boundary, secluded and pure, manifesting light, this spirit is without obstruction. Its brightness does not shine out but can be called empty and inherently radiant. Its brightness, inherently purifying, transcends causal conditions beyond subject and object. Subtle but preserved, illumined and vast, also it cannot be spoken of as being or nonbeing, or discussed with images or calculations. Right in here the central pivot turns, the gateway opens. You accord and respond without laboring and accomplish without hindrance. Everywhere turn around freely, not following conditions, not falling into classifications. Facing everything, let go and attain stability. Stay with that just as that. Stay with this just as this. That and this are mixed together with no discriminations as to their places. So, it is said that the earth lifts up the mountain without knowing the mountain&#x27;s stark steepness. A rock contains jade without knowing the jade&#x27;s flawlessness. This is how truly to leave home, how home-leaving must be enacted.&quot;

===Western Buddhism===
Various western Buddhists note that &quot;Śūnyatā&quot; refers to the emptiness of inherent existence, as in Madhyamaka; but also to the emptiness of mind or awareness, as open space and the &quot;ground of being,&quot; as in meditation-orientated traditions and approaches such as Dzogchen and Shentong.

==Hinduism==

===Influence on Advaita Vedanta===
Gaudapada has developed his concept of &quot;ajāta&quot;, which uses the term &quot;anutpāda&quot;:
* &quot;An&quot; means &quot;not&quot;, or &quot;non&quot;
* &quot;Utpāda&quot; means &quot;genesis&quot;, &quot;coming forth&quot;, &quot;birth&quot;

Taken together &quot;anutpāda&quot; means &quot;having no origin&quot;, &quot;not coming into existence&quot;, &quot;not taking effect&quot;, &quot;non-production&quot;.

According to Gaudapada, the Absolute is not subject to birth, change and death. The Absolute is &quot;aja&quot;, the unborn eternal. The empirical world of appearances is considered Maya (unreal as it is transitory), and not absolutely existent. Thus, Gaudapada&#x27;s concept of &quot;ajativada&quot; is similar to Buddhist term &quot;anutpāda&quot; for the absence of an origin or śūnyatā.

But Gaudapada&#x27;s perspective is quite different from Nagarjuna. Gaudapada&#x27;s perspective found in &quot;Mandukya Karika&quot; is based on the &quot;Mandukya Upanishad&quot;. According to Gaudapada, the metaphysical absolute called Brahman never changes, while the phenomenal world changes continuously, so the phenomenal world cannot arise independently from Brahman. If the world cannot arise, yet is an empirical fact, then the perceived world has to be a transitory (unreal) appearance of Brahman. And if the phenomenal world is a transitory appearance, then there is no real origination or destruction, only apparent origination or destruction. From the level of ultimate truth (&quot;paramārthatā&quot;) the phenomenal world is &quot;māyā&quot;, &quot;illusion&quot;, apparently existing but ultimately not metaphysically real.

In &quot;Gaudapada-Karika&quot;, chapter III, verses 46–48, he states that Brahman never arises, is never born, is never unborn, it rests in itself:
In contrast to Renard&#x27;s view, Karmarkar states the Ajativada of Gaudapada has nothing in common with the &quot;Śūnyatā&quot; concept in Buddhism. While the language of Gaudapada is undeniably similar to those found in Mahayana Buddhism, states Comans, their perspective is different because unlike Buddhism, Gaudapada is relying on the premise of &quot;Brahman, Atman or Turiya&quot; exist and are the nature of absolute reality.

===In Shaivism===
&quot;Sunya&quot; and &quot;sunyatisunya&quot; are concepts which appear in some Shaiva texts, such as the Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra, which contains several verses mentioning voidness as a feature of ultimate reality - Shiva:

The Absolute void is Bhairava who is beyond the senses and the mind, beyond all the categories of these instruments. From the point of view of the human mind, He is most void. from the point of view of Reality, He is most full, for He is the source of all manifestation.

The yogi should concentrate intensely on the idea (and also feel) that this universe is totally void. In that void, his mind would become absorbed. Then he becomes highly qualified for absorption i.e. his mind is absorbed in the absolute void (sunyatisunya).

In a series of Kannada language texts of Lingayatism, a Shaivism tradition, &quot;shunya&quot; is equated to the concept of the supreme. In particular, the &quot;Shunya Sampadane&quot; texts present the ideas of Allama Prabhu in a form of dialogue, where &quot;shunya&quot; is that void and distinctions which a spiritual journey seeks to fill and eliminate. It is the described as a state of union of one&#x27;s soul with the infinite Shiva, the state of blissful moksha.

===In Vaishnavism===
&quot;Shunya Brahma&quot; is a concept found in certain texts of Vaishnavism, particularly in Odiya, such as the poetic &quot;Panchasakhas&quot;. It explains the &quot;Nirguna Brahman&quot; idea of Vedanta, that is the eternal unchanging metaphysical reality as &quot;personified void&quot;. Alternative names for this concept of Hinduism, include &quot;shunya purusha&quot; and &quot;Jagannatha&quot; (Vishnu) in certain text. However, both in Lingayatism and various flavors of Vaishnavism such as &quot;Mahima Dharma&quot;, the idea of &quot;Shunya&quot; is closer to the Hindu concept of metaphysical &quot;Brahman&quot;, rather than to the &quot;Śūnyatā&quot; concept of Buddhism. However, there is some overlap, such as in the works of Bhima Bhoi.

In the Vaishnavism of Orissa, the idea of shunya brahman or shunya purusha is found in the poetry of the Orissan Panchasakhas (Five Friends), such as in the compositions of 16th-century Acyutananda. Acyutananda&#x27;s &quot;Shunya Samhita&quot; extols the nature of shunya brahman: 

&quot;nāhi tāhāra rūpa varṇa, adṛsha avarṇa tā cinha.&quot;
&quot;tāhāku brahmā boli kahi, śūnya brahmhati se bolāi.&quot;

It has no shape, no colour, 
It is invisible and without a name
This Brahman is called Shunya Brahman.
The Panchasakhas practiced a form of Bhakti called Jnana-mishrita Bhakti-marga, which saw the necessity of knowledge (Jnana) and devotion - Bhakti.

===In Shaktism===
Mahāśūnya (महाशून्य) refers to the “great void”, according to Arṇasiṃha’s Mahānayaprakāśa verse 134.—Accordingly, “The Śāmbhava (state) is the one in which the power of consciousness (citi) suddenly (sahasā) dissolves away into the Great Void [i.e., mahāśūnya] called the Inactive (niḥspanda) that is profound and has no abode. Cognitive awareness (jñāna) arises here in the form of a subtle wave of consciousness out of that ocean of emptiness, which is the perfectly peaceful condition of the dissolving away of destruction. [...] Again, that same (principle) free of the cognitive process (saṃvittikalanā) is the supreme absolute (niruttara) said to be the Śāmbhava state of emptiness (vyomaśāmbhava)”.

<text>Una Stubbs (1 May 1937 – 12 August 2021) was a British actress, television personality, and dancer who appeared on British television, in the theatre, and occasionally in films. She became known after appearing in the film &quot;Summer Holiday&quot; (1963) and later played Rita Rawlins in the BBC sitcoms &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; (1965–1975) and &quot;In Sickness and in Health&quot; (1985–1992). Her other television roles include Aunt Sally in &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot; (1979–1981) and Miss Bat in &quot;The Worst Witch&quot; (1998–2001). She also appeared as Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s landlady Mrs. Hudson in the BAFTA-winning television series &quot;Sherlock&quot; (2010–2017).

==Career==
As a 16-year-old, in 1953, she danced in a Folies Bergère-style musical revue, &quot;Pardon My French&quot;, at the Prince of Wales Theatre, alongside Frankie Howerd and the pianist Winifred Atwell. She first appeared on television as one of the Dougie Squires Dancers on the British television music show &quot;Cool for Cats&quot; in 1956. She also appeared as a dancer at the London Palladium. and worked in cabaret, clubs and revues in London, and was in Lionel Blair&#x27;s dance ensemble.

During 1958–59, Stubbs was the &quot;cover girl&quot; of Dairy Box chocolates, produced by Rowntree. She referred to herself as the &quot;Rowntree&#x27;s Chocolate Girl&quot;, when describing a visit she made to the Rowntree&#x27;s factory in York (where unknown to her, her grandfather had worked).

In 1963, she joined the cast of new charades-based gameshow &quot;Don&#x27;t Say a Word&quot; (ITV), a forerunner of &quot;Give Us a Clue&quot;. Her first screen role was in the Cliff Richard film &quot;Summer Holiday&quot; (1963). She also appeared in Richard&#x27;s next film, &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; (1964). Soon afterward, she made her breakthrough in television comedy, playing Rita, the married daughter of Alf Garnett in the BBC sitcom &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; (1966–1975). In 1968, as a direct spin-off from the sitcom, she appeared, alongside Warren Mitchell, in a series of television adverts for Findus frozen products.

She also appeared in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Till Death...&quot; (1981), again playing Rita. She played Rita a third time in a few episodes of the BBC sitcom &quot;In Sickness and in Health&quot; (1985–1992). During 1970–71, Stubbs teamed again with Cliff Richard to appear each week on his BBC1 TV Series, &quot;It&#x27;s Cliff Richard!&quot;. When she did not take part in the next series as it was broadcast shortly after she had a baby, her TV &quot;mother&quot;, Dandy Nichols from &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, took her place.

Stubbs featured in the &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; episode &quot;The Anniversary&quot; in 1979. From 1979 to 1981, she played Aunt Sally in the ITV children&#x27;s series &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot; opposite Jon Pertwee and Barbara Windsor, and was for several years a team captain in the weekly game show &quot;Give Us a Clue&quot; in the 1980s, reuniting her with Lionel Blair, the other team captain.

She appeared in the shows &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;, &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, &quot;Casualty&quot;, &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;, &quot;Born and Bred&quot; and &quot;The Worst Witch&quot;. In recent years, Stubbs also appeared in Victoria Wood&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;d Quite Like to Apologise&quot;, &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot;, &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot;, &quot;EastEnders&quot;, &quot;Benidorm&quot; and, from 2010, &quot;Sherlock&quot; as Mrs. Hudson. She appeared in an episode of &quot;Call the Midwife&quot; in 2015.

Stubbs was on the West End stage in Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Star Quality&quot; with Penelope Keith in 2001 and Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot; with Derek Jacobi in 2005. Her other theatre credits included &quot;La Cage Aux Folles&quot; at the Menier Chocolate Factory, &quot;Pygmalion&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Bath and Old Vic and &quot;The Family Reunion&quot; at the Donmar Warehouse. She was in the original cast of &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; at the National Theatre in 2012.

In 2015 she co-presented &quot;The Big Painting Challenge&quot; on BBC One alongside Richard Bacon.

==Personal life==
Stubbs was born in 1937 in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, the daughter of Angela K. Rawlinson and Clarence Reginald Stubbs. She grew up in Hinckley, Leicestershire, and was sent to La Roche dancing school in Slough by her mother. She was married to the actor Peter Gilmore from 1958 to 1969: they adopted a son, Jason. After their divorce in 1969, she married actor Nicky Henson. They divorced in 1975 but remained good friends. She and Henson had two children: composer Christian Henson (born 25 December 1971), and musician-composer Joe Henson (born 18 September 1973).

For many years, Stubbs sketched vignettes of characters around London, and held exhibitions of these near her Mayfair home. On several occasions, paintings by Stubbs were exhibited at the Royal Academy&#x27;s Summer Exhibition, most recently in 2020.

Stubbs had known her &quot;Sherlock&quot; co-star Benedict Cumberbatch since he was four years old, as she had worked with his mother, Wanda Ventham. Stubbs was the subject of an episode of the BBC series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, broadcast on 24 July 2013. It discussed several of her ancestors, including her great-grandfather Sir Ebenezer Howard, who was the founder of the garden city movement, and was the driving force in the design and creation of the first garden cities, Letchworth Garden City and Welwyn Garden City, situated in Hertfordshire.

After several months of ill health, Stubbs died at her home in Edinburgh on 12 August 2021, at the age of 84.

<doc id="201436" wikidata="Q2083614" url="?curid=201436" title="Big lie">
<text>A big lie () is a gross distortion or misrepresentation of the truth primarily used as a political propaganda technique. The German expression was first used by Adolf Hitler in his book &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; (1925) to describe how people could be induced to believe so colossal a lie because they would not believe that someone &quot;could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously&quot;. Hitler claimed that the technique had been used by Jews to blame Germany&#x27;s loss in on German general Erich Ludendorff, who was a prominent nationalist political leader in the Weimar Republic.

According to historian Jeffrey Herf, the Nazis used the idea of the original big lie to turn sentiment against Jews and justify the Holocaust. Herf maintains that Nazi Germany&#x27;s chief propagandist Joseph Goebbels and the Nazi Party actually used the big lie technique that they describedand that they used it to turn long-standing antisemitism in Europe into mass murder. Herf further argues that the Nazis&#x27; big lie was their depiction of Germany as an innocent, besieged nation striking back at &quot;international Jewry&quot;, which the Nazis blamed for starting . Nazi propaganda repeatedly claimed that Jews held outsized and secret power in Britain, Russia, and the United States. It further spread claims that the Jews had begun a war of extermination against Germany, and used these to assert that Germany had a right to annihilate the Jews in self-defense.

In the 21st century, the term has been applied to Donald Trump&#x27;s and his allies&#x27; attempts to overturn the result of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, specifically the false claim that the election was stolen through massive voter and electoral fraud. The scale of the claims resulted in Trump supporters attacking the United States Capitol. Later reports indicate that Trump knew he had genuinely lost the election while promoting the narrative. Scholars say that constant repetition across many different forms of media is necessary for the success of the big lie technique, as is a psychological motivation for the public to believe the extreme assertions.

==Uses related to Nazi Germany==

=== Hitler&#x27;s description ===
Hitler&#x27;s definition is given in Chapter 10 of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; (part of a single paragraph in both the German original and James Murphy&#x27;s translation):

In 1943, &quot;The New York Times&quot; contributor Edwin James asserted that Hitler&#x27;s biggest lie was his revisionist claim that Germany was not defeated in war in 1918, but rather was betrayed by internal groups. This stab-in-the-back myth was spread by right-wing groups, including the Nazis.

=== In enacting the Holocaust ===
According to historian Jeffrey Herf, the Nazis used the idea of the original big lie to turn sentiment against Jews and justify the Holocaust. Herf maintains that Joseph Goebbels and the Nazi Party actually used the big lie technique that they describedand that they used it to turn long-standing antisemitism in Europe into mass murder. Herf further argues that the Nazis&#x27; big lie was their depiction of Germany as an innocent, besieged land striking back at international Jewry, which the Nazis blamed for starting . Nazi propaganda repeatedly claimed that Jews held power behind the scenes in Britain, Russia, and the United States. It further spread claims that the Jews had begun a war of extermination against Germany, and used these to assert that Germany had a right to annihilate the Jews in self-defense.

The Cold War historian Zachary Jonathan Jacobson describes its use:

=== Goebbels&#x27;s description ===
Joseph Goebbels also put forth a theory which has come to be commonly associated with the expression &quot;big lie&quot;. Goebbels wrote the following paragraph in an article dated 12 January 1941, sixteen years after Hitler first used the phrase. The article, titled &quot;Aus Churchills Lügenfabrik&quot; (English: &quot;From Churchill&#x27;s Lie Factory&quot;) was published in &quot;Die Zeit ohne Beispiel:&quot;

==== Alleged quotation ====
The following supposed quotation of Joseph Goebbels has been repeated in numerous books and articles and on thousands of web pages, yet none of them has cited a primary source. According to the research and reasoning of Randall Bytwerk, it is an unlikely thing for Goebbels to have said:
===U.S. psychological profile of Hitler===
The phrase &quot;big lie&quot; was used in a report prepared around 1943 by Walter C. Langer for the United States Office of Strategic Services in describing Hitler&#x27;s psychological profile. The report was later published in book form as &quot;The Mind of Adolf Hitler&quot; in 1972. Langer stated of the dictator:

His primary rules were: never allow the public to cool off; never admit a fault or wrong; never concede that there may be some good in your enemy; never leave room for alternatives; never accept blame; concentrate on one enemy at a time and blame him for everything that goes wrong; people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one; and if you repeat it frequently enough people will sooner or later believe it.

A somewhat similar quote appears in the 1943 &quot;Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler: With Predictions of His Future Behaviour and Suggestions for Dealing with Him Now and After Germany&#x27;s Surrender&quot;, by Henry A. Murray:

... never to admit a fault or wrong; never to accept blame; concentrate on one enemy at a time; blame that enemy for everything that goes wrong; take advantage of every opportunity to raise a political whirlwind.

=== Hitler&#x27;s death ===
A 1947 U.S. book on the death of Adolf Hitler describes the infectious Soviet disinformation concerning his purported survival as an example of the technique, nodding to German philosopher Hans Vaihinger&#x27;s 1911 book &quot;The Philosophy of &#x27;As if&#x27;&quot;, which ponders the acceptance of lies for utilitarian purposes. The U.S. book asserts that Soviet leadership, &quot;realizing that Communist totalitarian systems and secret police methods require a continuing menace as justification for their existence, decided to keep the ghost of Hitler alive ... as a means of dramatizing the continuing menace of Fascism&quot;, bolstering their military.

In his controversial 1968 book, Soviet historian Lev Bezymenski cites the initial announcement of Hitler&#x27;s death by Nazi Germany as an example of the big lie, as it claimed him to have died while acting as a soldier in the line of duty.

== Other uses ==
===Cold War era===
Some U.S. Government officials believed that the technique continued to be employed by antisemitic conspiracy theorists in the decades after World War II. In their 1964 report on a fabricated antisemitic text first published in Russia in 1903, the members of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee stated their belief that &quot;peddlers&quot; of the debunked pamphlet made use of &quot;the Hitler technique of the &#x27;big lie&#x27;&quot; not only as a means of promoting antisemitic canards, but also to exploit American fears of Communist influence.

===Donald Trump&#x27;s false claims of a stolen election===



During his political career, U.S. president Donald Trump has employed what have been characterized as the firehose of falsehood and big lie propaganda techniques. To support his attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election, he and his allies repeatedly and falsely claimed that there had been massive election fraud and that Trump was the true winner of the election. By 2023, major news outlets characterized Trump&#x27;s claims as not merely falsehoods, but as lies.

U.S. Senators Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas subsequently contested the election results in the Senate. Their effort was characterized as &quot;the big lie&quot; by then President-elect Joe Biden: &quot;I think the American public has a real good, clear look at who they are. They&#x27;re part of the big lie, the big lie.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Block_1/16/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Republican senators Mitt Romney of Utah and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, scholars of fascism Timothy Snyder and Ruth Ben-Ghiat, Russian affairs expert Fiona Hill, and others also used the term &quot;big lie&quot; to refer to Trump&#x27;s false claims about massive election fraud. By May 2021, many Republicans had come to embrace the false claim and use it as justification to impose new voting restrictions and attempt to take control of the administrative management of elections. Republicans who opposed the claims faced backlash.

In early 2021, &quot;The New York Times&quot; examined Trump&#x27;s promotion of &quot;the big lie&quot; for political purposes to subvert the 2020 election, and concluded that the lie encouraged the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The attack was cited in a resolution to impeach Trump for a second time. During Trump&#x27;s second impeachment trial, the house managers Jamie Raskin, Joe Neguse, Joaquin Castro, Stacey Plaskett and Madeleine Dean discussed how Trump used &quot;the big lie&quot; to repeatedly make the false claim the election was stolen from him. On October 7, the Senate Judiciary Committee released new testimony and a staff report according to which &quot;we were only a half-step away from a full blown constitutional crisis as President Donald Trump and his loyalists threatened a wholesale takeover of the Department of Justice (DOJ). They also reveal how former Acting Civil Division Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark became Trump&#x27;s &quot;Big Lie Lawyer&quot;, pressuring his colleagues in DOJ to try to force an overturn of the 2020 election.&quot;

In early 2022, &quot;The New York Times&quot; presented a detailed analysis of the continuing efforts by Trump and his allies to further promote &quot;the big lie&quot; and related lies in their attempts to overturn and influence future elections, including those in 2022 and 2024. On June 13, 2022, the U.S. House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack presented testimony that Trump knew he lost the 2020 election, but nevertheless promoted the false claim to exploit donors, and, as a result, raked in &quot;half a billion&quot; dollars. In the days following his first indictment on March 30, 2023, he repeatedly posted similar election-related commentary to social media.

Dominion Voting Systems, which provided voting machines to many jurisdictions in the 2020 U.S. elections, filed four major lawsuits related to the big lie that Dominion fixed the election. From Trump&#x27;s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Dominion seeks in damages, alleging that &quot;he and his allies manufactured and disseminated the &#x27;Big Lie&#x27;, which foreseeably went viral and deceived millions of people into believing that Dominion had stolen their votes and fixed the election.&quot; Separately, in &quot;Dominion Voting Systems v. Fox News Network&quot; it sought $1.6 billion from Fox News. During discovery, Fox News&#x27; internal communications were released, indicating that prominent hosts and top executives were aware the network was reporting false statements but continued doing so to retain viewers for financial reasons. On April 18, 2023, Fox News agreed to pay Dominion a $788 million settlement, described by CNN as the &quot;big price&quot; of telling &quot;the Big Lie&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Darcy_4/19/2023&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dominion is also suing two other TV networks, Newsmax and One America News Network, for $1.6 billion each, as well as My Pillow and its CEO Mike Lindell for $1.2 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivanova_4/19/2023&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 25, 2023, CNN reported that Trump had told a new lie about the 2020 election: &quot;Trump pointedly noted that Biden got more votes than Trump in fewer than a fifth of US counties in 2020. Trump then said, &#x27;Nothing like this has ever happened before. Usually, it&#x27;s very equal, orbut the winner always had the most counties.&#x27;&quot; The statement was described as &quot;complete bunk&quot;. Both Bill Clinton (1992 and 1996) and Barack Obama (2008 and 2012) carried &quot;a minority of counties in each of their victories&quot;. William H. Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, explained:
On July 28, 2023, a federal district court judge dismissed an October 2022 Trump lawsuit against CNN, stating that CNN&#x27;s multiple uses of the term &quot;big lie&quot; about Trump&#x27;s claims of election fraud did not constitute actionable defamation. The judge wrote that CNN&#x27;s statements were opinion, not factually verifiable statements, and that &quot;no reasonable viewer&quot; would infer that &quot;Trump advocates the persecution and genocide of Jews or any other group of people&quot;. The suit was dismissed with prejudice, meaning Trump could not sue again on the same basis.

=== 21st-century usage in American politics ===
The term has been used by prominent American right-wing figures to describe allegations that Trump&#x27;s victory in the 2016 elections was the result of alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia. Former Attorney General William Barr described those allegations as &quot;a very damaging, big lie&quot; that inhibited the administration&#x27;s ability to properly deal with Vladimir Putin, a sentiment also echoed by Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

By early 2021, Trump and several prominent Republicans started to use the term &quot;the big lie&quot;, claiming that it refers to other electoral issues. Trump stated that the term refers to the &quot;Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020&quot;. An opinion piece in the typically center-right &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, as well as Republican politicians Mitch McConnell and Newt Gingrich, referred to &quot;the big lie&quot; as Democratic opposition to what were new and more restrictive voter identification requirements. McConnell&#x27;s office referred to a Democratic attempt to abolish the filibuster to enact voting rights legislation as &quot;the left&#x27;s Big Lie [that] there is some evil anti-voting conspiracy sweeping America&quot;. Timothy Snyder describes attempts to invert the narrative:

The lie is so big that it reorders the world. And so part of telling the big lie is that you immediately say it&#x27;s the other side that tells the big lie. Sadly, but it&#x27;s just a matter of record, all of that is in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;.

By January 2022, Republicans were taking actions to impose new voting restrictions and to take complete control of voting and the administrative management of elections, all while a large majority of Republicans continued to believe that the 2020 election had been stolen from them and asserted that democracy was at risk of failing. Extensive press coverage indicated the Republican efforts themselves appeared to present a threat to democracy.

=== China ===

The Government of China has denied committing human rights abuses against Uyghurs in Xinjiang, and has labelled declarations of Uyghur genocide as a &quot;big lie&quot; perpetrated by hostile forces.

==Analysis==
Psychologists, psychiatrists and others have explained why the big lie technique works. Dr. Ramani Durvasula, a licensed clinical psychologist and professor of psychology who is an expert on narcissistic personality disorder and narcissistic abuse says that:

Repetition is important, because the Big Lie works through indoctrination. The Big Lie then becomes its own evidence baseif it is repeated enough, people believe it, and the very repetition almost tautologically becomes the support for the Lie. ... Hear something enough it becomes truth. People assume there is an evidence base when the lie is big (it&#x27;s like a blind spot). ... [People also fail to realize] that there are people in our midst that lack empathy, have no care for the common good, are grandiose, arrogant, and willing to exploit and manipulate people for solely their own egocentric needs. ... [Instead] a sort of halo effect imbues leaders with presumed expertise and powerwhen that is not at all the case (most if not all megalomaniacal leaders, despots, tyrants, oligarchs share narcissism/psychopathy as a trait).

The importance of repetition in the acceptance of the big lie is stressed by Miriam Bowers-Abbott, an associate professor of logic at Mount Carmel College of Nursing, who states: &quot;What&#x27;s especially helpful is repetition in a variety of contexts. That is, not just the same words over and overbut integration of an idea in lots of ways. It builds its own little web of support.&quot; Such repetition can occur in the physical environment, according to Dr. Matt Blanchard, a clinical psychologist at New York University, who states: &quot;Nothing sells the Big Lie like novelty t-shirts, hats and banners. These items are normally associated with sports teams, not life-and-death political issues. But Trump and his circle have deftly used these items to generate the kind of unbridled loyalty Americans associate with pro football. ... The banners and hats crucially add an air of silliness to everything. If I can buy a novelty hat about it, can it really be so serious? ... It&#x27;s a genius mindf**k.&quot;

Blanchard also notes that people assess information that has a direct impact on their lives differently than more abstract information with less proximity to them. He states that &quot;the act of &#x27;believing&#x27; is not just one thing that humans do. Instead, this one word represents a wide range of relationships that humans have with information. We don&#x27;t truly &#x27;believe&#x27; things, so much as provisionally accept information we find useful.&quot; Because of this, he states that &quot;most people don&#x27;t whole-heartedly &#x27;believe&#x27; the Big Lie, but they are more than happy to provisionally accept it because... why not? It might be entertaining. It might flatter your identity. It might help you bond with other people in your community. Or it might help you vent some rage. ... &#x27;[B]elief&#x27; is always predicated on usefulness.&quot;

Psychiatrist Bandy X. Lee notes that emotional reasons lie beneath the acceptance of outrageous assertions such as the big lie, stating:

Usually, they are trying to find comfort and to avoid pain. ... This happens in states of lesser health, where one is less inclined to venture into new domains or to seek creative solutions. There is comfort in repetition, and so a people or a nation under duress will gravitate more toward what is repeated to them than what is realistic. Adolf Hitler understood this very well, which is why the American psychologist Walter Langer coined the phrase to describe his method.

Social media also plays a role in such emotional responses, according to Bowers-Abbott, who states:It was easier to dislodge untruths before social media. In social media, people tend to take public positions. When that position turns out to be wrong, it&#x27;s embarrassing. And backing down is typically seen as weakness. So they double-down on untrue claims to save face and personal credibility. ... We are way too emotionally attached to being right. It would be better for our culture as a whole to value uncertainty and intellectual humility and curiosity. Those values help us ask questions without the expectation of permanent answers.

Durvasula, Blanchard and Lee agree that it is unlikely that a believer in a big lie can be persuaded through the presentation of factual evidence. Durvasula argues that improvement in critical thinking skills is necessary, stating: &quot;It means ending algorithms that only provide confirmatory news and instead people seeing stories and information that provide other points of view ... creating safe spaces to have these conversations ... encouraging civil discourse with those who hold different opinions, teaching people to find common ground (e.g. love of family) even when belief systems are not aligned.&quot; Blanchard says that &quot;[S]preaders of the Big Lie will only be discredited in the eyes of their supporters if they face their greatest fearaccountability. ... They must be seen to lose at the ballot box, they must be arrested when they break the law, they must be sued for every defamation, they must be pursued with every legal tool available in an open society. ... Above all else they must be seen as weak. Only then will their lies lose their usefulness for the millions who once saw something to gainpersonally, psychologically, politically, financiallyin choosing to believe.&quot; Lee notes that when attempting to disabuse someone of a big lie, it is important not to put them on the defensive: &quot;You have to fix the underlying emotional vulnerability that led people to believing it in the first place. For populations, it is usually the pain of not having a place in the world, which socioeconomic inequality exacerbates. Deprivation of health care, education, an ability to make a living, and other avenues for dignity can make a population psychologically vulnerable to those who look to exploit them.&quot;

<doc id="201438" wikidata="Q1236009" url="?curid=201438" title="Wētā Workshop">
<text>Wētā Workshop is a special effects and prop company as well as a board game and miniatures company and video game developer based in Miramar, Wellington, New Zealand. It mainly produces effects for television and film.

==History==
Founded in 1987 by Richard Taylor and Tania Rodger as RT Effects, Wētā Workshop has produced creatures and makeup effects for the TV series &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; and effects for films such as &quot;Meet the Feebles&quot; and &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;. 

A digital version, Weta Digital (now Wētā FX), was formed in 1993 and operates independently as a separate company. The company is named after the New Zealand wētā, one of the world&#x27;s largest insects.

Wētā Workshop&#x27;s output was used in director Peter Jackson&#x27;s film trilogies &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, producing sets, costumes, armour, weapons, creatures and miniatures. It also aided in the making of Jackson&#x27;s 2005 version of &quot;King Kong&quot;. It supported the creation of &quot;Reclaiming the Blade&quot; (2009), a documentary film on stage combat, historical European and Asian swordsmanship.

Wētā Workshop teamed up with &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, creating weapons and cosmetics based on the company&#x27;s Dr. Grordbort&#x27;s Infallible Aether Oscillators series. Additionally, Wētā Workshop created the Aegis of Champions, the trophy awarded in the International, an esports world championship held annually.

Wētā Workshop&#x27;s video games division was founded in 2014 and has produced multiple games including the augmented reality project &quot;Dr. Grordbort&#x27;s Invaders&quot; for Magic Leap, which was apparently was never released, and the upcoming video game &quot;Tales of the Shire: A &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; Game&quot;.

Wētā Workshop made its American musical theatre debut in 2022 with Workshop designer Rebekah Tisch serving as the art director for the musical stage production of &quot;Other World&quot; at Delaware Theatre Company, creating a digital world for live stage.
== Innovations ==
=== Chainmail ===

For &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, realistic looking chainmail was made for the lead actors and for the hundreds of extras that appeared throughout the films. PVC pipe was cut into rings, assembled by hand into a semblance of armour, and then electroplated. A total of 82.9 million links were manufactured from 7 miles of PVC pipe.

Wētā Workshop makes chainmail for film and creative industries using new techniques developed in-house. PVC injection was used for the armour in &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;, giving better results than the process for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. It produces aluminium or steel mail for high-impact stuntwork.

===Bigatures===
The term &quot;bigature&quot; is Wētā Workshop&#x27;s nickname for a very large miniature model. They are used in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, with the largest of them measuring some 9 metres high. Extensive computer graphics techniques and computer-controlled cameras were used to seamlessly mesh the bigature photography with live actors and scenes.

Bigatures used in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy included models of:
* The Hornburg – the mountain fortress of the Rohirrim
* Minas Tirith – the White City of Gondor
* Rivendell – Elrond&#x27;s city for the Elves
* Caras Galadhon – Galadriel&#x27;s city in Lothlórien
* Argonath – the gateway into Gondor, two statues of Elendil and Isildur
* Osgiliath – the ruined City of Gondor
* Orthanc – Saruman&#x27;s tower
* Cirith Ungol – the tower that guards the pass of Shelob
* Minas Morgul – Sauron&#x27;s &#x27;Dead City&#x27;
* Barad-dûr – Sauron&#x27;s massive tower
* The Black Gate – the gate guarding the gap between the Ered Lithui and the Ephel Dúath
* Grond – the battering ram that smashed down the gates of Minas Tirith

==People==

* Jonathon Brough works as a designer and prop finisher.
* Daniel Falconer is the author of several Wētā Workshop publications including &quot;The Art of District 9: Weta Workshop&quot; He is also a member of the design team for the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film franchise and other films.

== Workplace culture ==

Beginning in June 2020, an investigative project by New Zealand public TV broadcaster &quot;1News&quot; into Wētā&#x27;s workplace culture resulted in over 11 current and former Wētā Workshop employees anonymously sharing accounts of bullying and harassment. Another former employee, Layna Lazar, came public with her own allegation by social media posting the same month that she was sexually harassed repeatedly and after seeking recourse, was fired, this prompted an independent review by Hive Consulting in December of that year. Their reviewer Ashley Benefield cleared the company of the allegations stating that &quot;the majority of allegations in the post including the most serious allegations, have either not been substantiated or were reasonable in the context of circumstances not described in the post&quot;. The review&#x27;s December 2020 report did not address the anonymous allegations of over 11 employees originally reported by &quot;1 News&quot; back in July, and the concerned employees stated they were not informed of the review having finished, in spite of their cooperation in it.

<doc id="201439" wikidata="Q1249439" url="?curid=201439" title="My Brilliant Career">
<text>My Brilliant Career is a 1901 novel written by Miles Franklin. It is the first of many novels by Stella Maria Sarah Miles Franklin (1879–1954), one of the major Australian writers of her time. 

==History==
The book was written while Franklin was still a teenager, as a romance to amuse her friends. She submitted the manuscript to Henry Lawson, who contributed a preface and took it to his publishers in Edinburgh. The popularity of the novel in Australia and the perceived closeness of many of the characters to her own family and circumstances as small farmers in New South Wales near Goulburn caused Franklin a great deal of distress and led her to withdraw the novel from publication until after her death.

Shortly after the publication of &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot;, Franklin wrote a sequel, &quot;My Career Goes Bung,&quot; which would not be published until 1946.

==Plot summary==
The heroine, Sybylla Melvyn, is an imaginative, headstrong girl growing up in rural Australia in the 1890s. Drought and a series of poor business decisions reduce her family to a subsistence level, her father begins to drink excessively, and Sybylla struggles to deal with the monotony of her life. To her relief, she is sent to live on her grandmother&#x27;s property, where life is more comfortable. There, she meets wealthy young Harold Beecham, who loves her and proposes marriage. But Sybylla is convinced that she is ugly and cannot believe he could love her. By this time, her father&#x27;s drinking has plunged the family into debt, and she is sent to work as a governess/housekeeper for the family of an almost illiterate neighbor to whom her father owes money. She finds life there unbearable and eventually suffers a physical breakdown, which leads to her return to the family home. When Harold Beecham returns to ask Sybylla to marry him, she concludes that she would only make him unhappy and sends him away, determined never to marry. The novel ends with no suggestion that she will ever have the &quot;brilliant career&quot; she desires as a writer.

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==

A 1979 film version, produced by Margaret Fink and directed by Gillian Armstrong, features Judy Davis and Sam Neill in starring roles as Sybylla and Harry.

A theatrical version by Kendall Feaver premiered in December 2020 at the Belvoir Street Theatre in Sydney.

A musical theatre adaptation was first performed in 2024 by the Melbourne Theatre Company at the Southbank Theatre.

<doc id="201442" wikidata="Q2333774" url="?curid=201442" title="Lutterworth">
<text>Lutterworth is an historic market town and civil parish in the Harborough district of Leicestershire, England. The town is located in southern Leicestershire, close to the borders with Warwickshire and Northamptonshire. It is located north of Rugby and south of Leicester. At the 2021 UK census, Lutterworth had a population of 10,833.

== History ==
Lutterworth was originally an Anglo-Saxon settlement; its name is probably derived from the Old English &quot;Hlutre Worth&quot;. Lutterworth was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086.

Lutterworth was granted its market charter in 1214 by King John and became a small but busy market town.

In the 14th century, the religious reformer John Wycliffe was rector of Lutterworth between 1374 and 1384, and it was during his time here that he is traditionally believed to have produced the first translation of the Bible from Latin into English. The Irish statesman Robert le Poer was also parish priest here c. 1318.

Lutterworth Grammar School was founded in 1630; by 1676 the population of Lutterworth had reached 644.

In the days of the stagecoach, Lutterworth was an important stopping place on the road from Leicester to Oxford and London, and many former coaching inns remain in the town. The town also contains a number of well-preserved half-timbered buildings.

Sir Frank Whittle, inventor of the jet engine, developed some of the world&#x27;s first jet engines at the British Thomson-Houston works in Lutterworth, and in nearby Rugby, during the late 1930s and the 1940s, with his company Power Jets. A replica of his first jet aircraft, the Gloster E.28/39, stands in the middle of a roundabout just south of the town as a memorial and a number of papers and documents relating to Whittle&#x27;s development of the jet engine are displayed at the town&#x27;s museum.

The M1 motorway was built just to the east of Lutterworth in 1964, and the M6 motorway was built a few miles to the south in 1971.

At the time of the first national census in 1801, Lutterworth had a population of 1,652; this had nearly doubled to 3,197 by 1901. By 2001 it had reached 8,294. Further population growth in the 21st century brought the population up to nearly 10,000 by 2017.

==Notable buildings==
=== St Mary’s Church ===

The parish church of St Mary was originally constructed in the 13th century and underwent major restorations in the 19th when a large tower replaced the original spire. The church contains some notable 15th century wall paintings which have been uncovered and restored.

=== Cavalier Inn ===

One of the landmarks in the town is the 17th century building on the corner of George Street and Leicester Road on the northern edge of the town centre, previously a tavern called the Cavalier Inn. Originally called the &quot;Ram Inn&quot; – that part of George Street was called Ram Lane – it changed its name in the early 1970s after a brewery &quot;makeover&quot;. It is said that the brewery did not like the name Ram Inn and prudishly renamed it &quot;the Cavalier&quot; after claims that wounded royalist soldiers sheltered in Lutterworth following the Battle of Naseby in 1645. The building has been modified over the years; it retains its rustic charm with stone walls and low ceilings and beams. In October 2010 the Cavalier Inn closed and was changed to a log-burning store, retailing log-burning fires and similar products and services.

===Lutterworth Town Hall===

The architect of Lutterworth Town Hall was Joseph Hansom, who also designed Birmingham Town Hall and took out the first patent of the horse-drawn hansom cab.

=== Shambles Inn ===

Another of the landmarks of the town centre is the thatched roof and timber-framed building now known as the &quot;Shambles Inn&quot;. This former abattoir and butcher&#x27;s is the oldest timber-framed building in Lutterworth, dating back to the 16th century. It was first used as a public house from 1791 until 1840, when it was converted back to a home and butcher&#x27;s shop. In 1982 it was converted back into a public house and named the Shambles. 

In February 2023, the Shambles caught fire, causing damage to the upstairs, the B&amp;B and the house. The Inn has since been rethatched and reopened.

== Local economy ==
To the west of the town [] is a large logistics and distribution centre called Magna Park, which is the main source of employment in the Lutterworth area. Magna Park is built upon the site of the old Bitteswell aerodrome. Also near Lutterworth is Stanford Hall.

A controversial issue in the town is how to manage the traffic flows emanating from Magna Park and the nearby M1 and A5 trunk roads. Approximately 3,000 heavy goods vehicles pass through the town every day and pollution levels are reported as being high.

The Census 2011 summary also indicates an overall growth in residents&#x27; vehicles, which is likely to add to traffic and pollution concerns according to the Census summary.

There is a Morrisons Food Store (formerly Safeway) on Bitteswell Road, as well as a Subway on High Street. Waitrose opened on 11 March 2010 on a site previously occupied by Netto. Aldi opened a new store on Rugby Road on 12 Aug 2021.

On the Greenacres housing estate in the town there was an estate public house, recently called &quot;The Sir Frank Whittle&quot; and previously called &quot;The Balloon&quot;. This building was sold by the brewery to the Co-op who changed the use and structure of the premises to be the new Co-op store in the town. The Co-op food store previously located on George Street closed in June 2014 coinciding with the opening of the new store.

== Transport ==
Lutterworth lies on the A426 Leicester–Rugby road, adjacent to the M1 motorway at junction 20. It is also located within a few miles of the M6 motorway and A5 trunk road. A southern bypass, the A4303, was opened in 1999, providing a route for traffic from the M1 to the A5 to avoid Lutterworth town centre.

The nearest railway station to Lutterworth is , about six miles to the south. The town formerly had its own railway station on the former Great Central Main Line, which opened in 1899 and closed in 1969.

Historically there were another two railway stations close to Lutterworth: The first was Ullesthorpe &amp; Lutterworth, about to the north west, on the former Midland Railway (later part of the LMS) line from Rugby to , closed on 1 January 1962. The second was Welford &amp; Kilworth, at one time known as Welford &amp; Lutterworth, some east on the London &amp; North Western Railway (also later LMS) line from Rugby to and , closed on 6 June 1966.

Arriva Midlands and Centrebus are the main operators of bus services around Lutterworth with services into Leicester, Market Harborough, Rugby, and Hinckley.

==Sport==
The town supports two individual local football teams : Lutterworth Athletic, who play at Hall Lane, and Lutterworth Town, who play at Dunley Way, play in the Midland League Division One and the United Counties League Premier South respectively. Lutterworth Tennis Club is located just outside Lutterworth on Hall Lane. Banger Racing was staged on farmland adjacent to the Coventry Road (the A4303} until the late 1990s.

==Education==
===Primary schools===
There are two primary schools in Lutterworth: John Wycliffe Primary School and Sherrier Primary School. Sherrier was originally housed in a Victorian building on Churchgate before moving to a new location on Bitteswell Road in 1983. Sherrier featured on the BBC TV children&#x27;s TV programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot; on 5 February 2008.

===Secondary schools===
The local secondary schools are Lutterworth High School (for ages 11–16) on Woodway Road and Lutterworth College (for ages 11–18) on Bitteswell Road, both of which achieve good results in applicable exams. A new Studio School called Sir Frank Whittle Studio School opened in 2015 (for ages 14–18) that offers purely vocational courses. In 2019 the Sir Frank Whittle Studio School closed due to a lack of students and minimal further interest.

==Health services==
Feilding Palmer Hospital, run by Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust is situated in the town. It has a ward which provides general rehabilitation and palliative and end of life care. Under the Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland Sustainability and transformation plan it is proposed to close.

==Notable people==
*Sir Frank Whittle (1907-1996), developed the first jet engine in Lutterworth.
*Anthony Thistlethwaite, folk rock musician.
*Lauren Henry, world champion rower and Olympic gold medallist.

==In popular culture==
Mark Corrigan of the British television series &quot;Peep Show&quot; describes a trip to Lutterworth by public transport as taking so long that it feels like &quot;going to Mordor&quot;, a reference to Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy.

The 1973 sitcom &quot;Me, myself and Nigel Wright&quot; was set in an ostrich farm near the town.

<text>The Lan Na Kingdom or The Kingdom of Lanna (, , &quot;Kingdom of a Million Rice Fields&quot;; , , ), also known as Lannathai, and most commonly called Lanna or Lanna Kingdom, was an Indianized state centered in present-day Northern Thailand from the 13th to the 18th centuries.

The cultural development of the Northern Thai people had begun long before as successive kingdoms preceded Lan Na. As a continuation of the kingdom of Ngoenyang, Lan Na emerged strong enough in the 15th century to rival the Ayutthaya Kingdom, with whom wars were fought. However, the Lan Na Kingdom was weakened and became a vassal state of the Toungoo dynasty in 1558. Lan Na was ruled by successive vassal kings, though some enjoyed autonomy. The Burmese rule gradually withdrew but then resumed as the new Konbaung dynasty expanded its influence. In 1775, Lan Na chiefs left the Burmese control to join Siam, leading to the Burmese–Siamese War (1775–76).

Following the retreat of the Burmese force, Burmese control over Lan Na came to the end. Siam, under King Taksin of the Thonburi Kingdom, gained control of Lan Na in 1776. From then on, Lan Na became a vassal state of Siam under the succeeding Chakri dynasty.

Throughout the latter half of the 1800s, the Siamese state dismantled Lan Na independence, absorbing it into the emerging Siamese nation-state. Beginning in 1874, the Siamese state reorganized Lan Na Kingdom as Monthon Phayap, brought under the direct control of Siam. The Lan Na Kingdom effectively became centrally administered from through the Siamese &quot;thesaphiban&quot; governance system instituted in 1899. By 1909, Lan Na Kingdom no longer existed formally as an independent state, as Siam finalized the demarcation of its borders with the British and French.

==Names==
The Lan Na kingdom is known by a number of exonyms in neighboring languages. In Burmese chronicles and sources, it is called Zinme Pyi (, ), &quot;Zinme&quot; being a Burmese language transcription of Chiang Mai; or Yun Pyi (, ), &quot;Yun&quot; being the Burmese term for the Northern Thai people. In the Laotian language, it is known as Anachak Lan Na ().

The Pali chronicles refer to the kingdom as Yonaraṭṭha (Kingdom of the Yun) or Bingaraṭṭha (Kingdom of the Mae Ping). In the Chinese &quot;History of the Yuan&quot;, it is called Babai Xifu (Pa-pai-si-fu) (), first attested in 1292.

==History==

===Early establishment===

Mangrai, the 25th king of Ngoenyang (modern Chiang Saen) of the Lavachakkaraj dynasty, whose mother was a princess of a kingdom in Sipsongpanna (&quot;the twelve nations&quot;), centralized the mueangs of Ngoenyang into a unified kingdom or mandala and allied with the neighboring Phayao Kingdom. In 1262, Mangrai moved the capital from Ngoenyang to the newly founded Chiang Rai — naming the city after himself. Mangrai then expanded to the south and subjugated the Mon kingdom of Hariphunchai (centered on modern Lamphun) in 1281. Mangrai moved the capital several times. Leaving Lamphun due to heavy flooding, he drifted until settling at and building Wiang Kum Kam in 1286/7, staying there until 1292 at which time he relocated to what would become Chiang Mai. He founded Chiang Mai in 1296, expanding it to become the capital of Lan Na. Claimed territories of Mangrai&#x27;s Lan Na include the modern northern Thai provinces (with exception of Phrae, which was under the vassalhood of Sukhothai, and Phayao and Nan), Kengtung, Mong Nai, and Chiang Hung (now Jinghong in Yunnan). He also reduced to vassaldom and received tribute from areas of modern Northern Vietnam, principally in the Black and Red river valleys, and most of Northern Laos, plus the Sipsongpanna of Yunnan where his mother originated.

===Disunity and prosperity===
Around 1311, Mangrai died and was succeeded by his second son Grama, or Jayasangrama (Khun Hham). He soon retired to Chiangrai and appointed his son Saen Phu as the Uparaja (Viceroy) of Chiangmai. Mangrai&#x27;s youngest son, ruler of Mong Nai returned to claim the throne, occupying Haripunjaya. Saen Phu and his brother Nam Thuem fled to their father in Chiangrai. Nam Tuam succeeded in driving out their uncle, restoring Saen Phu onto the throne in 1322 or 1324. Saen Phu founded the city of Chiang Saen in 1325 or 1328, before he died in 1334. His son Kham Fu replaced him but reigned only few years, before he was succeeded by his son Pha Yu, who restored the capital to Chiang Mai again. There he fortified the city and built Wat Phra Singh.

Theravada Buddhism prospered in Lan Na during the reign of religious Kue Na who established the dhatu of Doi Suthep in 1386. Kue Na promoted the Lankawongse sect and invited monks from Sukhothai to replace the existing Mon Theravada that Lan Na inherited from Haripunchai.

Lan Na enjoyed peace under Saenmuengma (which means ten thousand cities arrive — to pay tribute). The only disturbing event was the failed rebellion by his uncle Prince Maha Prommatat. Maha Prommatat requested aid from Ayutthaya. Borommaracha I of Ayutthaya sent his troops to invade Lan Na but was repelled. This was the first armed conflict between the two kingdoms. Lan Na faced invasions from the newly established Ming Dynasty in the reign of Sam Fang Kaen.

===Expansions under Tilokkarat===

The Lan Na kingdom was strongest under Tilokkarat (1441–1487). Tilokkarat seized the throne from his father Sam Fang Kaen in 1441. Tilokkarat&#x27;s brother, Thau Choi, rebelled to reclaim the throne for his father and sought Ayutthayan support. Borommaracha II sent his troops to Lan Na in 1442 but was repelled and the rebellion was suppressed. Tilokkarat conquered the neighboring Kingdom of Payao in 1456.

To the south, the emerging Kingdom of Ayutthaya was also growing powerful. Relations between the two kingdoms had worsened since the Ayutthayan support of Thau Choi&#x27;s rebellion. In 1451, Yutthitthira, a Sukhothai royal who had conflicts with Trailokanat of Ayutthaya, gave himself to Tilokkarat. Yuttitthira urged Trilokanat to invade Pitsanulok which he had claims on, igniting the Ayutthaya-Lan Na War over the Upper Chao Phraya valley (i.e. the Kingdom of Sukhothai). In 1460, the governor of Chaliang surrendered to Tilokkarat. Trailokanat then used a new strategy and concentrated on the wars with Lan Na by moving the capital to Pitsanulok. Lan Na suffered setbacks and Tilokkarat eventually sued for peace in 1475.

Tilokkarat was also a strong patron of Theravada Buddhism. In 1477, the Buddhist Council to recompile the Tripitaka was held near Chiang Mai. Tilokkarat also built and rehabilitated many notable temples. Tilokkarat then expanded west to the Shan States of Laihka, Hsipaw, Mong Nai, and Yawnghwe.

===Decline===
After Tilokkarat, Lan Na was then subjected to old-style princely struggles that prevented the kingdom from defending itself against powerful growing neighbors. The Shans then broke themselves free of Lan Na control that Tilokkarat had established. The last strong ruler was Paya Kaew who was the great-grandson of Tilokkarat. In 1507, Kaew invaded Ayutthaya but was repelled — only to be invaded in turn in 1513 by Ramathibodi II and Lampang was sacked. In 1523, a dynastic struggle occurred in Kengtung State. One faction sought Lan Na support while another faction went for Hsipaw. Kaew then sent Lan Na armies to re-exert control there but was readily defeated by Hsipaw armies. The loss was so tremendous that Lan Na never regained such dominance.

In 1538, King Ketklao, son of Kaew, was overthrown by his own son Thau Sai Kam. However, Ketklao was restored in 1543 but suffered mental illness and was executed in 1545. Ketklao&#x27;s daughter, Chiraprapha, then succeeded her father as the queen regnant. As Lan Na was plundered by the dynastic struggles, both Ayutthaya and the Burmese saw this as an opportunity to overwhelm Lan Na. Chairacha of Ayutthaya invaded Lan Na in 1545, but Chiraprapha negotiated for peace. Chairacha returned next year, sacking Lampang and Lamphun, and threatened Chiangmai itself. So, Chiraprapha was forced to put her kingdom under Ayutthaya as a tributary state.

Facing pressures from the invaders, Chiraprapha decided to abdicate in 1546 and the nobility gave the throne to her nephew (son of her sister), Prince Chaiyasettha of Lan Xang. Chaiyasettha moved to Lan Na and thus Lan Na was ruled by a Laotian king. In 1547, Prince Chaiyasettha returned to Lan Xang to claim the throne and ascended as Setthathirath. Setthathirath also brought the Emerald Buddha from Chiangmai to Luang Prabang (the one that would be later taken to Bangkok by Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke). The nobles then chose Mekuti, the Shan saopha of Mong Nai whose family was related to Mangrai, to be the new king of Lan Na. It was said that, as a Shan king, Mekuti violated several Lan Na norms and beliefs.

===Burmese rule===
The kingdom then came to conflict over Shan states with the expansionist Burmese king Bayinnaung. Bayinnaung&#x27;s forces invaded Lan Na from the north, and Mekuti surrendered on 2 April 1558. Encouraged by Setthathirath, Mekuti revolted during the Burmese–Siamese War (1563–64). But the king was captured by Burmese forces in November 1564, and sent to the-then Burmese capital of Pegu. Bayinnaung then made Wisutthithewi, a Lan Na royal, the queen regnant of Lan Na. After her death, Bayinnaung appointed one of his sons Nawrahta Minsaw (Noratra Minsosi), viceroy of Lan Na in January 1579. Burma allowed a substantial degree of autonomy for Lan Na but strictly controlled the corvée and taxation.

After Bayinnaung, his massive empire quickly unraveled. Siam successfully revolted (1584–93), after which all the vassals of Pegu went their own way by 1596–1597. Lan Na&#x27;s Nawrahta Minsaw declared independence in 1596. In 1602, Nawrahta Minsaw became a vassal of King Naresuan of Siam. However, Siam&#x27;s control was short-lived. The actual suzerainty effectively ended with Naresuan&#x27;s death in 1605. By 1614, Siam&#x27;s control over Lan Na was at most nominal. When the Burmese returned, the ruler of Lan Na, Thado Kyaw (Phra Choi), sought and received help from Lan Xang, not his nominal overlord Siam, which did not send any help. After 1614, vassal kings of Burmese descent ruled Lan Na for over one hundred years. Siam did try to take over Lan Na in 1662–1664 but failed.

By the 1720s, the Toungoo dynasty was on its last legs. In 1727, Chiang Mai revolted because of high taxation. The resistance forces drove back the Burmese army in 1727–1728 and 1731–1732, after which Chiang Mai and Ping valley became independent. Chiang Mai became a vassal again in 1757 to the new Burmese dynasty. It revolted again in 1761 with Siamese encouragement but the rebellion was suppressed by January 1763. In the 1765, the Burmese used Lan Na as a launching pad to invade the Laotian states, and Siam itself.

===End of Burmese rule===

In the early 1770s, Burma was at the peak of its military power since Bayinnaung, having defeated Siam (1765–67) and China (1765–69), the Burmese army commanders and governors became &quot;drunk with victory&quot;. This arrogant repressive behavior by the local Burmese government caused a rebellion in Lan Na. The new Burmese governor at Chiang Mai, Thado Mindin, was disrespectful to local chiefs and the people, and became extremely unpopular. One of the local chiefs, Kawila of Lampang revolted with Siamese help, and captured the city on 15 January 1775, ending the 200-year Burmese rule. Kawila was installed as the prince of Lampang and Phraya Chaban as the prince of Chiang Mai, both as vassals of Siam.

Burma tried to regain Lan Na in 1775–76, 1785–86, 1797 but failed each time. In the 1790s, Kawila consolidated his hold of Lan Na, taking over Chiang Saen. He then tried to take over Burma&#x27;s Shan state of Kengtung and Sipsongpanna (1803–1808) but failed.

Nonetheless, the Kingdom of Chiang Mai, as a vassal state of Siam, had come into existence. Under Siamese suzerainty, Lan Na kingdom was divided into five smaller principalities, namely the Chiang Mai, Nan, Lampang, Lamphun, and Phrae. Lan Na ceased to be an entity on its own after it was incorporated into modern Kingdom of Siam.

Chiang Mai, under Burma&#x27;s rule, lasted more than 200 years, but there were some periods that switched to Ayutthaya rule. The reign of King Narai the Great, and there were some independent periods, but was dominated and ruled by the Lao King called Ong Kham from the Kingdom of Luang Prabang for more than 30 years.

== Lan Na language ==

Kham Mueang or &quot;Phasa Mueang&quot; () is the modern spoken form of the old Lan Na language. &quot;Kham Mueang&quot; means &quot;language of the principalities&quot; (&quot;Kham&quot;, language or word; &quot;mueang&quot;, town, principality, kingdom) as opposed to the languages of many hill tribe peoples in the surrounding mountainous areas. The language may be written in the old Lan Na script, which somewhat resembles that of the Thai, but differs significantly in spelling rules. Due to the influence of the latter, it also differs significantly from the modern pronunciation of Kham Mueang.

<doc id="201446" wikidata="Q1056939" url="?curid=201446" title="Libyan Airlines">
<text>Libyan Airlines, formerly known as &quot;Libyan Arab Airlines&quot; over several decades, is the flag carrier of Libya. Based in Tripoli, it operates scheduled passenger and cargo services within Libya and to Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, the majority of which leave from Tripoli International Airport. Benina International Airport in Benghazi serves as a secondary base. Libyan Airlines also operates Hajj services. The company is wholly owned by the government of Libya.

==History==
===Early years===
The carrier traces its roots back to when &quot;Kingdom of Libya Airlines&quot; was set up in conformity with law no. 22. The airline was government-owned, having an initial investment of LYD 2 million. It began operations in , flying regional routes with Sud SE-210 Caravelle aircraft. Following the carrier starting services along the Tripoli–Benghazi run, the Libyans prevented foreign companies that also flew the route from operating there in order to allow the national airline to expand. Absorbing Libavia and United Libya Airlines operations, international flights radiating from Benghazi and Tripoli began in , initially serving Athens, Cairo, London, Malta, Paris, Rome and Tunis.

The early years saw Air France providing the company with technical assistance, KLM managing the sales and reservations, and BOAC taking care of traffic, finance and communications. In , the airline and ATI struck an agreement for the lease of Fokker F27 aircraft to cover short-haul routes, with the agreement coming into effect on 15 June the same year. A third Caravelle was ordered in 1968. That year, a study to increase the airline&#x27;s productivity was carried out by TWA, concluding that operating with five three-engined, 138-seater jet aircraft, and four propeller-powered 60-seater aircraft would be the most suitable choice. The report concluded that the lease of the turboprop F-27s was too costly, and the airline decided to acquire two new aircraft from Fokker in 1969. Regarding the jet aircraft, the Boeing 727 and the Trident were the only options.

===From the Libyan revolution (1969) to the Libyan Civil War (2011)===

Following the 1969 coup d&#x27;état, the airline was renamed &quot;Libyan Arab Airlines&quot;, or &quot;Jamahiriya Libyan Air Lines&quot;, on 1 sep. The company suspended its operations for two weeks after the coup. With Beirut and Geneva already being part of the route network by , nine international destinations were already served. In , Libyan Arab Airlines ordered two Boeing 727-200s for US$14 million. These two aircraft were part of the fleet by , along with three Caravelles and two Fokker F27s. Six Fokker F27s—four Mk600s and two Mk400s—were purchased in , and in May the same year, three additional Boeing 727-200s were ordered, aimed at replacing the Caravelles. In 1975, Libyan Arab Airlines was made the only operator within the country. Furthermore, the government committed to cancel their debts with the company on a monthly basis, and any losses the airline would incur should be compensated by the state. Also in 1975, the six F27s ordered the previous year were delivered, and the three-strong Boeing 727 order was partly fulfilled when two of these aircraft were incorporated into the fleet. By , there were 12 aircraft in the fleet, including four Boeing 727s, four Fokker F27-600s, two Fokker F27-400s, and two Falcon 20s; a Boeing 727-200 and a Boeing 737 were pending delivery. Two more Boeing 727s were acquired in ; in August that year, the carrier took delivery of a Boeing 707-320C to be used by the government. The airline had 1,800 employees at ; at this time, passenger and cargo flights radiating from Benghazi, Tripoli and Sebha to Athens, Algiers, Beirut, Cairo, Casablanca, Damascus, Jeddah, Khartoum, London, Malta, Paris, Rome, Tunis and Zürich were operated. During the year, the Tripoli–Frankfurt–Athens–Tunis–Casablanca and Benghazi–Rome–London routes were launched.
The handover of two Boeing 727-200 Advanced aircraft, due to be delivered in June and , was blocked due to concerns that Libya was supporting terrorism. Despite the US State Department initially authorising the acquisition of three Boeing 747s and two Boeing 727s in March the following year, the transaction was blocked in mid-1979 over concerns the Libyan government would use the aircraft to transport military material and personnel, as there were suspicions that Libya played a role in the deposition of Idi Amin in Uganda. Also in 1979, a cargo subsidiary named Libyan Arab Air Cargo was set up. During the year, Madrid, Moscow, Sofia and Warsaw were included in the airline&#x27;s list of destinations.

By mid-1980, the number of employees had grown to 2,500, and Amman, Belgrade, Cotonou, Istanbul and Niamey were added to the route network; later that year, Karachi was incorporated as a destination. In Libyan Arab Airlines ordered eight 44-seater Fokker F27-600s in a deal worth more than £17 million. Ten Airbuses—six A300s and four A310s—were ordered in October the same year. At that time, Airbuses were equipped either with General Electric (GE) or Pratt &amp; Whitney (P&amp;W) powerplants, but the airline ordered Rolls-Royce engines to power them—something that had not been done before, as the former two were manufactured in the United States and there was a ban in force on providing Libya with technology that could possibly have military uses. The order was at least partly cancelled by Airbus, as neither GE nor P&amp;W would provide the engines for the four A310s in the order book.
The company had managed to buy a number of ageing US-manufactured jets, including Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s, since 1979; many of them were either cannibalised for spare parts or sold. Three Fokker F28-4000s were bought from Fokker in 1984. At , the fleet consisted of four Boeing 707s—two -320Bs and two -320Cs—10 Boeing 727-200s, 17 F27s—two -400s, one -500 and 14 -600s—and three Fokker F28-4000s. Employment at this time was 4,500; destinations served included Algiers, Amman, Amsterdam, Athens, Belgrade, Benghazi, Bucharest, Casablanca, Damascus, Frankfurt, Istanbul, Jeddah, Karachi, Kuwait, Larnaca, London, Madrid, Malta, Milan, Moscow, Paris, Rome, Sebha, Sfax, Sofia, Tripoli, Tunis, Vienna, Warsaw and Zürich, along with an extensive domestic network. However, the airline had to cut most of its international services that year due to a US embargo imposed on the country. In 1986, six more F27-600s were phased in. During the year, Libyan Arab managed to bypass the US economic embargo against the country when the carrier acquired, through intermediary companies, ex-British Caledonian GE-powered A310 aircraft for  million. Owing to both the lack of spare parts and the inability of Libyan Arab to service the GE engines, the airline sold these two aircraft to Air Algérie in 1987; in practice, the aircraft were not sold but leased, and the Algerian airline would have operated these two aircraft on Libyan Arab&#x27;s behalf, but they later rolled back their decision amid concerns that the United States would take action against Air Algérie, and the two A310s were returned to Libya. Finally, British Caledonian was fined  million (£600,000) for its involvement in the deal, and Libyan Arab kept both aircraft, with Swissair training Libyan crews in order to fly them. Unable to order Western-built aircraft, the airline moved to Soviet-made airframers, ordering three Tupolev Tu-154Ms in 1989.

At , the fleet consisted of five Boeing 707-320Cs, ten Boeing 727-200s, three Fokker F28-4000s, 16 Fokker F27s (13 -600s, two -500s and one -400), four Lockheed L-100-200s, 21 Ilyushin Il-76s and five Twin Otters. Another drawback hit the carrier following the United Nations Security Council Resolution 748, adopted as a consequence of the Libyan government allegedly having supported the terrorists responsible for the bombings of Pan Am Flight 103 and UTA Flight 772. The resolution saw a trade embargo imposed on Libya, which included the delivery of new aircraft or spare parts that could possibly boost the military capacity of the country, and Libyan Airlines was denied any landing or overflight rights of third-party countries. Thus, all international flights came to an end, and LAA could only operate on domestic routes.
In , civil sanctions against the country were lifted. It followed Libya handing over two men suspected of being involved in the Lockerbie bombing. Intended to replace an ageing fleet of Boeing 707s, 727s and Fokker F27s, a letter of intent worth US$1.5 billion was signed with Airbus in October that year; it included Airbus A320s, A330s and A340s. The fact that these aircraft had US-manufactured parts once again prevented the deal to be firmed up as a trade embargo over the country, imposed in 1983, was still in force, and Libyan Arab Airlines sought alternative manufacturers to acquire new aircraft for re-fleeting. In the meantime, an Airbus A310 leased from Air Djibouti enabled Libyan Arab Airlines to expand services to the Middle East and North Africa, and Airbus A320s were on wet-lease from TransAer. Amman became the first non-domestic destination to be served again. Fleet and route network grew further when regional carrier Air Jamahiriya was merged into Libyan Arab Airlines in 2001. In 2006, the airline was renamed &quot;Libyan Airlines&quot;. The airline pursues an expansion policy, which is concentrated on European business and tourist customers. Newly introduced destinations like Milan, Ankara, Athens and Madrid have led to a route network similar to the one offered prior to the 1992 trade embargo.

===Libyan Civil Waronwards===

As a consequence of the Libyan Civil War and the resulting no-fly zone over the country enforced by NATO in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, all flight operations with Libyan Airlines were terminated on 17 March 2011. The airline restarted operations in October the same year flying the Tripoli–Cairo route.

In , Libyan Airlines was affected by a ban that was imposed by the European Union (EU) on all carriers having an operator&#x27;s certificate issued in Libya from flying into the member countries. The airline was removed from the list of air carriers banned in the EU in December the same year, as well as from the subsequent list released in . Despite this, Libyan Airlines served the European market with wet-leased aircraft due to the Libyan Civil Aviation Authority (LYCAA) voluntarily opting for a ban until Libyan crews become re-certified. The voluntary ban will continue through 2014. No Libyan carriers have been included in the version of the list of airlines banned in the EU. Despite information regarding LYCAA&#x27;s failure for meeting international safety standards that may lead to an effective ban, an agreement between Libyan authorities and the EU to lift the ban seemed plausible to take effect by mid-2014. However, in December that year all air carriers having an operator&#x27;s certificate issued in Libya have been either banned or subject to restrictions in their operations into European airspace.

==Corporate affairs==

===Ownership and structure===
The company is 100% owned by the government of Libya. Since 31 July 2007, Libyan Airlines has been a subsidiary of the state-owned Libyan Afriqiyah Aviation Holding Company (LAAHC), together with Afriqiyah Airways.

, the CEO position was held by Khaled Ben Alewa.

===Business trends===
Annual reports for the airline do not appear to be published. In the absence of these, the main sources for trends are press and industry reports.

===Proposed merger with Afriqiyah Airways===
On 31 July 2007, Libyan Airlines became a subsidiary of the state owned Libyan Afriqiyah Aviation Holding Company (LAAHC), together with Afriqiyah Airways. LAAHC is owned by the Libyan National Social Fund (30%), the Libyan National Investment Company (30%), the Libya-Africa Investment Fund (25%), and the Libyan Foreign Investment Company (15%). On 21 September 2010, it was announced that the two airlines, which had already begun extensive code-sharing and set up joint ground handling, maintenance and catering services, were to merge by November of that year, which was later postponed indefinitely, though.

The proposed privatisation and merger with Afriqiyah Airways has also been postponed, despite the fact it was originally planned to be effective in November 2010. The two carriers were later expected to merge in late 2011, however the Arab Spring and poor organisation forced this deal to be postponed many more times. Both airlines are to merge by the first half of 2013, according to Libya&#x27;s current Interim Transport Minister Yousef el-Uheshi – 12 to 13 months after negotiations are expected to resume in March 2012. The successful merging of the carriers depends on the government&#x27;s ability to cut costs in both workforce and salaries, which rival European carriers in size.

==Fleet==

===Recent developments===

In order to modernize and expand its fleet, Libyan Airlines placed several orders with aircraft manufacturers. In , at the Paris Air Show, the carrier signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Airbus for new aircraft, including Airbus A350-800s, Airbus A330-200s and A320s; the MOU was converted into a firm order in December the same year, in a deal valued at around  billion. Also in , Libyan Airlines placed an order for three Bombardier CRJ-900s worth  million, and took option for another two aircraft of the type; for an approximate value of  million, this option was exercised in . That month, an order for Airbus A350-800s was placed.

In , Libyan Airlines took delivery of the first of seven Airbus A320s ordered in 2007. In , with five CRJ-900s already in operation, three more aircraft of the type were ordered for  million, and three more were taken on option. In late , the carrier took delivery of the first Airbus A330, becoming a new customer for the type. A second A330 was phased in a month later. In , the A350-800 order was switched to the -900 model, with the addition of more aircraft of the larger variant.

===Damaged aircraft during the Libyan conflict===
In , amid the 2014 Libyan conflict, clashes between antagonistic forces that tried to gain control of Tripoli International Airport damaged or destroyed a number of aircraft parked at the airport, including ones belonging to Afriqiyah Airways and Libyan Airlines. In particular, seven Libyan Airlines aircraft resulted damaged during shelling. In December 2014, the European union banned all Libyan Airlines (along with 6 other Libyan airlines) flights within European skies, citing the ongoing conflicts as a major security threat.

===Current fleet===

The Libyan Airlines fleet consists of the following aircraft ():

==Incidents and accidents==

===Fatal accidents===
*On 21 February 1973 at around 14:10 local time, Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114 from Tripoli to Cairo, which was operated by a Boeing 727-200 (registered 5A-DAH), was shot down by Israeli fighter aircraft because it was thought to be a foreign military attack aircraft. Among the 113 people on board, only one crew member and four passengers survived the subsequent crash-landing in the desert near Ismaïlia.
*On 2 December 1977, a Tupolev 154 (registered LZ-BTN), which was chartered by Libyan Arab Airlines from Balkan Bulgarian Airlines to operate a Hajj flight from Jeddah to Benghazi crashed near Benina International Airport because of fuel exhaustion. The aircraft had been circling the airport because it could not land due to dense fog, and an alternate landing strip could not be reached in time. 59 of the 159 passengers died in the accident, whilst all six crew members survived.
*On 22 December 1992, Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 1103, a Boeing 727-200 registered 5A-DIA, disintegrated on approach to Tripoli International Airport. The official government story was that it had collided with a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 of the Libyan Air Force over Tripoli. Both aircraft crashed, killing all 157 persons on board the Boeing but the 2 crew of the air force jet ejected safely, making it the worst accident in the history of the airline.

===Non-fatal incidents===
*On 28 November 1981, a Libyan Arab Airlines Fokker F27 Friendship (registered 5A-DBE) was damaged beyond repair in a forced landing in the desert near Kufra, which had become necessary because the aircraft had run out of fuel.
*On 6 June 1989, an LAA Fokker F27 (registered 5A-DDV) experienced an engine failure shortly after take-off from Zella Airfield for a flight to Tripoli. The crew tried to return to the airfield, but had to execute a forced landing in the desert instead, during which the aircraft was destroyed. The 36 passengers and three crew members survived the crash.
*On 7 December 1991, a Libyan Arab Airlines Boeing 707 (registered 5A-DJT) crashed on take-off at Tripoli International Airport. There were no fatalities among the 189 passengers and ten crew on board.

===Military occurrences===
Several aircraft of the company were destroyed on the ground in different war events:
*On 5 June 1967, during the Six-Day War, a Kingdom of Libya Airlines Learjet 23 (registered 5A-DAD), which was parked at Damascus International Airport, was destroyed in an Israeli air raid.
*On 15 April 1986, a Libyan Arab Airlines Fokker F27 Friendship (registered 5A-DLP) was destroyed at Benina International Airport during the United States bombing of the airfield as part of Operation &quot;El Dorado Canyon&quot;.
*On 25 August 2011, during the Libyan Civil War, a Libyan Airlines Airbus A300-600 (registered 5A-DLZ) was destroyed during fighting actions at Tripoli International Airport.
*On 15 July 2014, a Libyan Airlines Airbus A330 (registered 5A-LAS) suffered substantial damage in the right hand fuselage during the fighting actions at Tripoli International Airport. The aircraft is now stored for maintenance.
*On 20 July 2014, a Libyan Airlines Bombardier CRJ-900 (registered 5A-LAL) was destroyed during fighting actions at Tripoli International Airport.

===Hijackings===
*On 6 July 1976, an LAA Boeing 727 was hijacked during a flight from Tripoli to Benghazi and forced to land at Palma de Mallorca Airport, where the perpetrator surrendered.
*On 24 August 1979, another Boeing 727 was forced to divert from its Benghazi-Tripoli route and land at Larnaca.
*On 16 October of the same year, a domestic flight from Hun to Tripoli was hijacked by three passengers, who forced the Fokker F27 Friendship (registered 5A-DDU) to divert to Malta. After two days on the ground at Luqa Airport, the perpetrators surrendered.
*On 7 December 1981, an LAA flight from Zürich to Tripoli was hijacked by three persons who thus wanted to press prisoners free. The Boeing 727 was flown to Beirut, were the perpetrators surrendered.
*On 20 February 1983, Flight 484 was hijacked en route a flight from Sabha to Benghazi. The two hijackers forced the 727 (registered 5A-DII) to land in Malta, and surrendered three days later.
*Also in 1983, on 22 June, an LAA Boeing 707 was hijacked during a flight from Athens to Tripoli, by two persons who demanded to be taken to Iran. During the negotiations, the aircraft was flown to Rome and Larnaca, where the hijackers surrendered.

<text>Allan Wesley Eckert (January 30, 1931 – July 7, 2011) was an American novelist and playwright who specialized in historical novels for adults and children, and was also a naturalist. His novel &quot;Incident at Hawk&#x27;s Hill&quot; (1971) was initially marketed to adults and selected by Reader&#x27;s Digest Condensed Books. A runner-up for the Newbery Medal, it was afterward marketed as a children&#x27;s novel and adapted by Disney for a television movie known as &quot;The Boy Who Talked to Badgers&quot; (1975).

Eckert wrote several books of natural history. In addition, he wrote more than 225 episodes of &quot;Mutual of Omaha&#x27;s Wild Kingdom&quot;, for which he received an Emmy Award.

His numerous historical novels were popular, including several that were part of his series &quot;The Winning of America&quot;. In 1996, one of them was adapted for the stage as &quot;1913: The Great Dayton Flood&quot; and premiered at Wright State University, also being produced at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. He wrote the drama &quot;Tecumseh&quot; for an outdoor production at Sugarloaf Mountain Amphitheatre near Chillicothe, Ohio that has been a destination for tourists every summer since 1973.

==Biography==
Eckert was born in Buffalo, New York, in 1931, and raised in the Chicago, Illinois area. He attended college at the University of Dayton and Ohio State before settling near Bellefontaine, Ohio and remaining a longtime resident there.

As a young man, he hitchhiked around the United States, living off the land and learning about wildlife. He began writing about nature and American history at the age of thirteen. He eventually wrote numerous books for children and adults. His children&#x27;s novel, &quot;Incident at Hawk&#x27;s Hill&quot;, was a runner-up for the Newbery Medal in 1972. One of his novels tells how the great auk became extinct.

Eckert published numerous novels of the Ohio Country frontier in what was called his &quot;The Winning of America&quot; series, including accounts of frontiersmen and notable Native Americans, such as Tecumseh. He conducted extensive research for his works, but inserted fictional dialogue for his historical figures.

Eckert also wrote several unproduced screenplays. He wrote more than 225 episodes of &quot;Mutual of Omaha&#x27;s Wild Kingdom&quot;, for which he received an Emmy Award.

In a 1999 poll conducted by the Ohioana Library Association, Eckert shared with Toni Morrison the accolade of &quot;Favorite Ohio Writer of All Time.&quot;

Eckert died in his sleep on July 7, 2011, in Corona, California, at the age of 80.

==Dramatizations and adaptations==

Eckert wrote the outdoor drama &quot;Tecumseh!&quot; which, in 1997, celebrated its 25th year of production at the multi-million-dollar Sugarloaf Mountain Amphitheater near Chillicothe, Ohio. His 1968 children&#x27;s novel &quot;Blue Jacket&quot; was adapted as a drama of the same name designed for outdoor performances. It opened in 1982 at a facility outside Xenia, Ohio. The production eventually closed due to financial difficulties, but it was estimated to have generated more than nine million dollars yearly into the local economy of southwest Ohio.

Eckert&#x27;s 1965 book &quot;A Time of Terror: The Great Dayton Flood&quot; was in 1996 adapted for the stage as &quot;1913: The Great Dayton Flood&quot; by W. Stuart McDowell and Timothy Nevits. It was performed at Wright State University, featuring recorded narration by actors Martin Sheen, Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee. The production won a number of awards from the American College Theatre Festival XXIX at the Riffe Center, Columbus, Ohio. It opened the 1997 festival in the Kennedy Center, returning to Dayton that fall, where it played in the Victoria Theatre.

==Criticism==

While Eckert emphasized the historical basis of his books and stressed the years of research he conducted, he created dialogue and internal thought for his ostensibly historic figures. Reviewers have described his work as &quot;an entertaining blend of fact and fiction.&quot; What Eckert described as &quot;narrative biography” was criticized by Kirkus Reviews as “an apparent euphemism for poetic license”, when discussing his book about Tecumseh. &quot;A Sorrow in Our Heart: The Life of Tecumseh&quot; was described as &quot;A biography that succeeds better as fiction&quot;. The reviewer said that the book &quot;in its interpretative zeal … strays from … the historical record to the point of being suspect&quot;.

<text>The Rescuers is a 1977 American animated adventure comedy-drama film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Distribution. Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor respectively star as Bernard and Bianca, two mice who are members of the Rescue Aid Society, an international mouse organization dedicated to helping abduction victims around the world. Both must free 6 year old orphan Penny (voiced by Michelle Stacy) from two treasure hunters (played by Geraldine Page and Joe Flynn), who intend to use her to help them obtain a giant diamond. The film is based on a series of books by Margery Sharp, including &quot;The Rescuers&quot; (1959) and &quot;Miss Bianca&quot; (1962).

An early version of &quot;The Rescuers&quot; entered development in 1962, but was shelved due to Walt Disney&#x27;s dislike of its political overtones. During the 1970s, the film was revived as a project intended for the younger animators, with the oversight of the senior staff. Four years were spent working on the film. &quot;The Rescuers&quot; was released on June 22, 1977, to positive critical reception and became a box office success, earning $48 million against a budget of $7.5 million during its initial theatrical run. It has since grossed a total of $169 million after two re-releases in 1983 and 1989. Due to the film&#x27;s success, a sequel titled &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; was released in 1990, which made this film the first Disney animated film to have a sequel.

==Plot==

In an abandoned riverboat in Devil&#x27;s Bayou, Louisiana, a 6 year old orphan named Penny drops a message in a bottle, containing a plea for help, into the river. The Rescue Aid Society, an international mouse organization inside the United Nations, finds the bottle when it washes up in New York City. The Hungarian representative, Miss Bianca, volunteers to accept the case. She chooses Bernard, a stammering janitor, as her co-agent. The two visit Morningside Orphanage, where Penny lived, and meet an old cat named Rufus. He tells them about a woman named Madame Medusa who once tried to lure Penny into her car, prompting the mice to investigate her pawn shop for clues.

At the pawn shop, Bianca and Bernard discover that Medusa and her partner, Mr. Snoops, are searching for the world&#x27;s largest diamond, the Devil&#x27;s Eye. The mice learn that Medusa and Snoops are currently at the Devil&#x27;s Bayou with Penny, whom they have kidnapped and placed under the guard of two trained crocodiles, Brutus and Nero. With the help of an albatross named Orville and a dragonfly named Evinrude, the mice follow Medusa to the bayou. There, they learn that Medusa plans to force Penny to enter a small blowhole that leads down into a blocked-off pirates&#x27; cave where the Devil&#x27;s Eye is located.

Bernard and Bianca find Penny and devise a plan of escape. They send Evinrude to alert the local animals, who loathe Medusa, but Evinrude is delayed when he is forced to take shelter from a cloud of bats. The following morning, Medusa and Snoops send Penny down into the cave to find the gem. Unbeknownst to Medusa, Bianca and Bernard are hiding in Penny&#x27;s dress pocket. The three soon find the Devil&#x27;s Eye within a pirate skull. As Penny pries the mouth open with a sword, the mice push the gem through it, but soon the oceanic tide rises and floods the cave. The three barely manage to escape with the diamond.

Medusa betrays Snoops and hides the diamond in Penny&#x27;s teddy bear, while holding Penny and Snoops at gunpoint. When she trips over a cable set as a trap by Bernard and Bianca, Medusa loses the bear and the diamond to Penny, who runs away with them. The local animals arrive at the riverboat and aid Bernard and Bianca in trapping Brutus and Nero, then set off Mr. Snoops&#x27;s fireworks to create more chaos. Meanwhile, Penny and the mice commandeer Medusa&#x27;s swamp-mobile, a makeshift airboat. Medusa unsuccessfully pursues them, using Brutus and Nero as water-skis. As the riverboat sinks from the fireworks&#x27; damage, Medusa crashes and is left clinging to the boat&#x27;s smoke stacks. Mr. Snoops escapes on a raft and laughs at her, while the irritated Brutus and Nero turn on her and circle below.

Back in New York City, the Rescue Aid Society watch a news report of how Penny found the Devil&#x27;s Eye, which has been given to the Smithsonian Institution while it is implied that Medusa and Mr. Snoops have been arrested. It also mentions she has been adopted. The meeting is interrupted when Evinrude arrives with a call for help, sending Bernard and Bianca on a new adventure.

==Cast==
* Bob Newhart as Bernard, Rescue Aid Society&#x27;s timid janitor, who reluctantly tags along with Miss Bianca on her journey to the Devil&#x27;s Bayou to rescue Penny. He is highly superstitious about the number 13 and dislikes flying (the latter being a personality trait of Newhart).
* Eva Gabor as Miss Bianca, the Hungarian representative of the Rescue Aid Society. She is sophisticated and adventurous, and fond of Bernard, choosing him as her co-agent as she sets out to rescue Penny. Her Hungarian nationality was derived from that of her voice actress.
* Geraldine Page as Madame Medusa, a greedy, redheaded, wicked pawn-shop owner. Upon discovering the Devil&#x27;s Eye diamond hidden in a blowhole, she kidnaps the small orphan, Penny, to retrieve it for her, as Penny is the only one small enough to fit in it. She has two pet crocodiles, who turn on her after she is thwarted by Bernard, Bianca, and Penny.
* Joe Flynn as Mr. Snoops, Medusa&#x27;s clumsy and incompetent business partner, who obeys his boss&#x27;s orders to steal the Devil&#x27;s Eye in exchange for half of it. Upon being betrayed by Medusa, however, he turns on her and flees by raft, laughing at her. This was Flynn&#x27;s final role, with the film being released after his death in 1974.
* Jeanette Nolan as Ellie Mae and Pat Buttram as Luke, two muskrats who reside in a Southern-style home on a patch of land in Devil&#x27;s Bayou. Luke drinks very strong, homemade liquor, which is used to help Bernard and Evinrude regain energy when they need it. Its most important usage is for fuel for powering Medusa&#x27;s swamp-mobile in the film&#x27;s climax.
* Jim Jordan as Orville (named after Orville Wright of the Wright brothers, the inventors of the airplane; most likely influenced from Bob Newhart&#x27;s stand-up sketch &quot;Merchandising the Wright Brothers&quot;), an albatross who gives Bernard and Bianca a ride to Devil&#x27;s Bayou. Jordan, 80 years old by the time the film was completed, had been lured out of retirement and had not performed since the death of his wife and comic partner Marian in 1961; it would serve as Jordan&#x27;s last public performance.
* John McIntire as Rufus, an elderly cat who resides at Morningside Orphanage and comforts Penny when she is sad. Although his time onscreen is rather brief, he provides the film&#x27;s most important theme, faith. He was designed by animator Ollie Johnston, who retired after the film following a 40-year career with Disney.
* Michelle Stacy as Penny, a lonely six-year-old orphan girl, residing at Morningside Orphanage in New York City. She is kidnapped by Medusa in an attempt to retrieve the world&#x27;s largest diamond, the Devil&#x27;s Eye.
* Bernard Fox as Mr. Chairman, the chairman to the Rescue Aid Society.
* Larry Clemmons as Gramps, a grumpy, yet kind old turtle who carries a brown cane.
* James MacDonald as Evinrude (named after a brand of outboard motors), a dragonfly who mans a leaf boat across Devil&#x27;s Bayou, giving Bernard and Miss Bianca a ride across the swamp waters.
* George Lindsey as Deadeye, a fisher rabbit who is one of Luke and Ellie Mae&#x27;s friends.
* Bill McMillian as TV Announcer
* Dub Taylor as Digger, a mole.
* John Fiedler as Deacon Owl

==Production==
In 1959, the book &quot;The Rescuers&quot; by Margery Sharp had been published to considerable success. In 1962, Sharp followed up with a sequel titled &quot;Miss Bianca&quot;. That same year, the books were optioned by Walt Disney, who began developing an animated film adaptation. In January 1963, story artist Otto Englander wrote a story treatment based on the first book, centering on a Norwegian poet unfairly imprisoned in a Siberia-like stronghold known as the Black Castle. The story was revised with the location changed to Cuba, in which the mice would help the poet escape into the United States. However, as the story became overtly involved in international intrigue, Disney shelved the project as he was unhappy with the political overtones. In August 1968, Englander wrote another treatment featuring Bernard and Bianca rescuing Richard the Lionheart during the Middle Ages.

A total of four years were spent working on &quot;The Rescuers&quot;, which was made on a budget of $7.5 million. During the early 1970s, &quot;The Rescuers&quot; reentered development as a project for the young animators, led by Don Bluth, with the studio planning to alternate between full-scale &quot;A pictures&quot; and smaller, scaled-back &quot;B pictures&quot; with simpler animation. The animators had selected the most recent book, &quot;Miss Bianca in the Antarctic&quot;, to adapt from. The new story involved a King penguin deceiving a captured polar bear into performing in shows aboard a schooner, causing the unsatisfied bear to place a bottle that would reach the mice. Fred Lucky, a newly hired storyboard artist, was assigned to develop the story adaptation, alongside Ken Anderson. This version of the story was dropped, to which Lucky explained the Arctic setting &quot;was too stark a background for the animators.&quot; Vance Gerry, also a storyboard artist, also explained director Wolfgang Reitherman &quot;decided not to go with Fred Lucky&#x27;s version. He said, It&#x27;s too complicated. I want a simple story: A little girl gets kidnapped and the mice try to get her back, period. According to Burny Mattinson, he stated: &quot;Our problem was that the penguin wasn&#x27;t formidable or evil enough for the audience to believe he would dominate the big bear. We struggled with that for a year or so. We changed the locale to somewhere in America and it was now a regular zoo and we tried to come up with something with the bear in the zoo and needing to be rescued but that didn&#x27;t work either.&quot;

In that version, the bear character was still retained, but was renamed Louie the Bear. Jazz singer Louis Prima was cast in the role and had recorded most of the dialogue and multiple songs that were composed by Floyd Huddleston. The writers also expanded the role of his best friend, Gus the Lion. Huddleston had stated, &quot;It&#x27;s about two animals. One is Louis Prima — he&#x27;s the polar bear — and Redd Foxx is the lion ...Louis gets cornered into leaving and going to the South Pole where he can make himself a bigger star. But he gets homesick; he feels fooled. They send out little mice as &#x27;rescuers&#x27;.&quot; By November 1973, the role of Louie the Bear had been heavily scaled back and then eliminated. In one version, the bear was meant to be Bernard and Bianca&#x27;s connection to Penny. Gerry explained, &quot;We developed the sequence where, while the two mice are searching for clues as to where Penny has been taken, they come across this bear who she had been friends with because the orphanage where Penny was living was near the zoo.&quot; In the final film, the idea was reduced to a simple scene where Bernard enters a zoo and hears a lion&#x27;s roar that scares him away.

While promoting the release of &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1973) in Europe, Reitherman stated: &quot;I took Margery Sharp&#x27;s books along and there was in there a mean woman in a crystal palace. When I got back I called some of the guys together and I said, &#x27;We&#x27;ve got to get a villain in this thing. The villainess and her motive to steal a diamond was adapted from the Diamond Duchess in &quot;Miss Bianca&quot;. The setting was then changed to the bayous found in the Southern United States. By August 1973, the villainess was named the Grand Duchess with Phyllis Diller cast in the role. A month later, Ken Anderson began depicting Cruella de Vil, the villainess from &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; (1961), as the main antagonist of the film. Anderson had drawn several sketches of Cruella de Vil sporting alligator-leathered chic attire and sunglasses; one sketch depicted her wearing bell-bottom pants and platform shoes. However, several staff members such as animator Ollie Johnston stated it felt wrong to attempt a sequel for the character. Furthermore, Mattinson explained that Milt Kahl did not want to animate Cruella de Vil. &quot;Milt, of course, was very strong against that, &#x27;Oh, no no. We&#x27;re gonna have a new character. I&#x27;m not gonna do Cruella&#x27;,&quot; Mattinson recalled, &quot;Because he felt that Marc [Davis] had animated Cruella beautifully. He was not gonna go and take his character.&quot;

The new villain was named Madame Medusa, and her appearance was based on Kahl&#x27;s then-wife, Phyllis Bounds (who was the niece of Lillian Disney), whom he divorced in 1978. This was Kahl&#x27;s last film for the studio, and he wanted his final character to be his best. He was so insistent on perfecting Madame Medusa that he ended up doing almost all the animation for the character himself. The kidnapped child Penny was inspired by Patience, the orphan in the novel. The alligator characters Brutus and Nero was based on the two bloodhounds, Tyrant and Torment, in the novels. For the henchman, the filmmakers adapted the character, Mandrake, into Mr. Snoops. His appearance was caricatured from John Culhane, a journalist, who had been interviewing animators at the Disney studios. Culhane claimed he was practically tricked into posing for various reactions, and his movements were imitated on Mr. Snoops&#x27;s model sheet. However, he stated, &quot;Becoming a Disney character was beyond my wildest dreams of glory.&quot;

The writers had considered depicting Bernard and Bianca as married professional detectives, but decided that depicting them as novices in a new relationship was more compelling and romantic. For the supporting characters, a pint-sized swamp mobile for the mice—a leaf powered by a dragonfly—was created. As they developed the comedic potential of displaying his exhaustion through buzzing, the dragonfly grew from an incidental into a major character. Veteran sound effects artist and voice actor Jimmy MacDonald came out of retirement to provide the effects. Additionally, the local swamp creatures were originally written as a dedicated home guard that drilled and marched incessantly. However, the writers rewrote them into a volunteer group of helpful little bayou creatures. Their leader, a singing bullfrog, voiced by Phil Harris, was cut from the film, as were lines characterizing muskrat Ellie Mae as their outspoken boss. For Bernard and Bianca&#x27;s transportation, a pigeon was proposed (specifically one that would be catapulted, repurposing an unused gag from &quot;Robin Hood&quot;), until Johnston remembered a &quot;True-Life Adventures&quot; film featuring albatrosses and their clumsy take-offs and landings, leading him suggest that ungainly bird instead. A scene of the mice preparing for their adventure, with Bianca choosing outfits and Bernard testing James Bond-like gadgets, was cut for pacing. On February 13, 1976, co-director John Lounsbery died of a heart attack during production. Art Stevens, an animator, was then selected as the new co-director.

===Animation===
After the commercial success of &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (1970), then-vice president Ron Miller pledged that new animators should be hired to ensure &quot;a continuity of quality Disney animated films for another generation.&quot; Eric Larson, one of the &quot;Nine Old Men&quot; animators, scouted for potential artists who were studying at art schools and colleges throughout the United States. More than 60 artists were brought into the training program. Then, the selected trainees were to create a black-and-white animation test, which were reviewed at the end of the month. The process would continue for several months, in which the few finalists were first employed as in-betweeners working only on nights and weekends. By 1977, more than 25 artists were hired during the training program. Among those selected were Glen Keane, Ron Clements, and Andy Gaskill, all of whom would play crucial roles in the Disney Renaissance. Because of this, &quot;The Rescuers&quot; was the first collaboration between the newly recruited trainees and the senior animators. It would also mark the last joint effort by Milt Kahl, Ollie Johnston, and Frank Thomas, and the first Disney film Don Bluth had worked on as a directing animator, instead of as an assistant animator.

Ever since &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; (1961), animation for theatrical Disney animated films had been done by xerography, which had only been able to produce black outlines. By the time &quot;The Rescuers&quot; was in production, the technology had been improved for the cel artists to use a medium-grey toner in order to create a softer-looking line.

==Music==
Sammy Fain was first hired as a lyricist and wrote two original songs &quot;Swamp Volunteers March&quot; and &quot;The Rescuers Aid Society&quot;. Meanwhile, the filmmakers had listened to an unproduced musical composed by the songwriting team of Carol Connors and Ayn Robbins. Both women had first met each other in 1973 on a double date. Before then, Connors had co-composed and sang successful songs such as &quot;To Know Him Is to Love Him&quot; and &quot;Hey Little Cobra&quot; with the Teddy Bears. Meanwhile, Robbins worked as a personal secretary to actors George Kennedy and Eva Gabor and wrote unpublished poetry.

Desiring more contemporary songs for the film, Reitherman called Connors and Robbins into his office and shown them storyboards of Bernard and Bianca flying on Orville. Connors and Robbins then composed &quot;Tomorrow Is Another Day&quot; to accompany the scene. They later composed the symphonic piece &quot;The Journey&quot; to play during the opening titles. Near the end of the film&#x27;s production, Reitherman asked artist Mel Shaw to illustrate pastel sketches to accompany the music. Shaw agreed and was assisted by Burny Mattinson.

Connors and Robbins wrote another song &quot;The Need To Be Loved&quot;, but Reitherman preferred Fain&#x27;s song &quot;Someone&#x27;s Waiting for You&quot;. He nevertheless asked both women to compose new lyrics for the songs. They also recomposed a new version of the &quot;Rescuers Aid Society&quot; song. Most of the songs they had written for the film were performed by Shelby Flint. Also, for the first time since &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942), all the most prominent songs were sung as part of a narrative, as opposed to by the film&#x27;s characters as in most Disney animated films.

Describing their collaborative process, Robbins noted &quot;...Carol plays the piano and I play the pencil.&quot; During production, both women were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;Gonna Fly Now&quot; from &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976) with Bill Conti.

===Songs===
Original songs performed in the film include:

Songs heard in the film but not released on the soundtrack include:

* &quot;Faith is a Bluebird&quot; – Although not an actual song, it is a poem recited by Rufus and partially by Penny in a flashback the old cat has to when he last saw the small orphan girl, and comforted her through the poem, about having faith. The titular bluebird that appears in this sequence originally appeared in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1951).
* &quot;The U.S. Air Force&quot; – Serves as the leitmotif for Orville.
* &quot;For Penny&#x27;s a Jolly Good Fellow&quot; – Sung by the orphan children at the end of the film, as a variation of the song &quot;For He&#x27;s a Jolly Good Fellow&quot;.

==Release==
===Original theatrical run===
On June 19, 1977, &quot;The Rescuers&quot; premiered at the AFI Silver Theatre in Washington, D.C., and was accompanied with the live-action nature documentary film, &quot;A Tale of Two Critters&quot; (1977). By January 1979, the film had earned $15 million in distributor rentals from the United States and Canada, achieving the highest-gross for an animated film during its initial release.

The film was the highest-grossing film in France in 1977, out-grossing &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. It received admissions of 7.2 million in France generating film rentals of around $6 million. The film also became the highest-grossing film in West Germany for 1977, earning $6 million during its first 20 days of release. Altogether, it received admissions of 10.3 million in Germany generating rentals of almost $12 million. During its release, it earned $48–50 million in worldwide gross rentals at the box office.

===Re-releases===
&quot;The Rescuers&quot; was re-released in 1983 and 1989. During its 1983 re-release, the film was accompanied with the new Mickey Mouse featurette, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, which marked the character&#x27;s first theatrical appearance after a 30-year absence. The film grossed $21 million domestically. In 1989, the film earned $21.2 million domestically. The film&#x27;s total lifetime domestic gross is $71.2 million, and its total lifetime worldwide gross is $169 million.

===Marketing===
To tie in with the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary, &quot;The Rescuers&quot; debuted in the Walt Disney Classics Collection line in 2002, with three different figures featuring three of the film&#x27;s characters, as well as the opening title scroll. The three figures were sculpted by Dusty Horner and they were: &quot;Brave Bianca&quot;, featuring Miss Bianca the heroine and priced at $75, &quot;Bold Bernard&quot;, featuring hero Bernard, priced also at $75 and &quot;Evinrude Base&quot;, featuring Evinrude the dragonfly and priced at $85. The title scroll featuring the film&#x27;s name, &quot;The Rescuers&quot;, and from the opening song sequence, &quot;The Journey,&quot; was priced at $30. All figures were retired in March 2005, except for the opening title scroll which was suspended in December 2012.

&quot;The Rescuers&quot; was the inspiration for another Walt Disney Classics Collection figure in 2003. Ken Melton was the sculptor of &quot;Teddy Goes With Me, My Dear&quot;, a limited-edition, 8-inch sculpture featuring the evil Madame Medusa, the orphan girl Penny, her teddy bear &quot;Teddy&quot; and the Devil&#x27;s Eye diamond. Exactly 1,977 of these sculptures were made, in reference to the film&#x27;s release year, 1977. The sculpture was priced at $299 and instantly declared retired in 2003.

In November 2008, a sixth sculpture inspired by the film was released. Made with pewter and resin, &quot;Cleared For Take Off&quot; introduced the character of Orville into the collection and featured Bernard and Bianca a second time. The piece, inspired by Orville&#x27;s take-off scene in the film, was sculpted by Ruben Procopio.

===Home media===
&quot;The Rescuers&quot; premiered on VHS and LaserDisc on September 18, 1992 as part of the Walt Disney Classics series. The release went into moratorium on April 30, 1993. It was on VHS as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection on January 5, 1999, but due to a scandal was recalled three days later and reissued on March 23, 1999.

&quot;The Rescuers&quot; was released on DVD on May 20, 2003, as a standard edition, which was discontinued in November 2011.

On August 21, 2012, a 35th-anniversary edition of &quot;The Rescuers&quot; was released on Blu-ray alongside its sequel in a &quot;2-Movie Collection&quot;.

====Nudity scandal====
On January 8, 1999, three days after the film&#x27;s second release on home video, The Walt Disney Company announced a recall of about 3.4 million copies of the videotapes because there was a blurry image of a topless woman in the background of a scene.

The image appears twice in non-consecutive frames during the scene in which Miss Bianca and Bernard are flying on Orville&#x27;s back through New York City. The two images could not be seen in ordinary viewing because the film runs too fast—at 24 frames per second.

On January 10, 1999, two days after the recall was announced, the London newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; reported:A Disney spokeswoman said that the images in &quot;The Rescuers&quot; were placed in the film during post-production, but she declined to say what they were or who placed them... The company said the aim of the recall was to keep its promise to families that they can trust and rely on the Disney brand to provide the best in family entertainment.

&quot;The Rescuers&quot; home video was reissued on March 23, 1999, with the nudity edited and blocked out.

==Reception==
&quot;The Rescuers&quot; was said to be Disney&#x27;s greatest film since &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), and seemed to signal a new golden age for Disney animation. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the film as &quot;the best feature-length animated film from Disney in a decade or more—the funniest, the most inventive, the least self-conscious, the most coherent, and moving from start to finish, and probably most important of all, it is also the most touching in that unique way fantasy has of carrying vibrations of real life and real feelings.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote the film &quot;is one of the most rousing and appealing animated features ever made by the Disney studio. The last production for several members of the original feature animation unit assembled by Walt Disney in the late &#x27;30s, the film is both a triumphant swan song and gladdening act of regeneration.&quot; Dave Kehr of &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot; praised the film as &quot;a beautifully crafted and wonderfully expressive cartoon feature,&quot; calling it &quot;genuinely funny and touching.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; magazine wrote the film was &quot;the best work by Disney animators in many years, restoring the craft to its former glories. In addition, it has a more adventurous approach to color and background stylization than previous Disney efforts have displayed, with a delicate pastel palette used to wide-ranging effect.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t belong in the same category as the great Disney cartoon features (&quot;Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs,&quot; &quot;Bambi,&quot; &quot;Fantasia&quot;) but it&#x27;s a reminder of a kind of slickly cheerful, animated entertainment that has become all but extinct.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four writing, &quot;To see any Disney animated film these days is to compare it with Disney classics released 30 or 40 years ago. Judged against &quot;Pinocchio,&quot; for example. &quot;The Rescuers&quot; is lightweight, indeed. Its themes are forgettable. It&#x27;s mostly an adventure story.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film three stars out of five, opining that &quot;The Rescuers&quot; &quot;is a beautifully animated film that showed Disney still knew a lot about making quality children&#x27;s fare even as their track record was weakening.&quot; They also praised the voice acting of the characters, and stated that the film is &quot;a delight for children as well as adults who appreciate good animation and brisk storytelling.&quot; Ellen MacKay of Common Sense Media gave the film four out of five stars, writing, &quot;Great adventure, but too dark for preschoolers&quot;.

In his book, &quot;The Disney Films&quot;, film historian Leonard Maltin referred to &quot;The Rescuers&quot; as &quot;a breath of fresh air for everyone who had been concerned about the future of animation at Walt Disney&#x27;s,&quot; praises its &quot;humor and imagination and [that it is] expertly woven into a solid story structure ... with a delightful cast of characters.&quot; Finally, he declares the film &quot;the most satisfying animated feature to come from the studio since &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot;.&quot; He also briefly mentions the ease with which the film surpassed other animated films of its time. The film&#x27;s own animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston stated on their website that &quot;The Rescuers&quot; had been their return to a film with heart and also considered it their best film without Walt Disney. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film received approval rating, with an average rating of based on reviews. The website&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Featuring superlative animation, off-kilter characters, and affectionate voice work by Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor, &quot;The Rescuers&quot; represents a bright spot in Disney&#x27;s post-golden age.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100 based on 8 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===Accolades===
In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated &quot;The Rescuers&quot; for its Top 10 Animated Films list.

====Sequel====

&quot;The Rescuers&quot; was the first Disney animated film to have a sequel. After three successful theatrical releases of the original film, &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; was released theatrically on November 16, 1990.

&quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; takes place in the Australian Outback, and involves Bernard and Bianca trying to rescue a boy named Cody and a giant golden eagle called Marahute from a greedy poacher named Percival C. McLeach. Both Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor reprised their lead roles. Since Jim Jordan, who had voiced Orville, had since died, a new character, Wilbur (Orville&#x27;s brother, another albatross), was created and voiced by John Candy.

==== Scrapped Television Series with The Great Mouse Detective ====
In 2022, &quot;Rapunzel&#x27;s Tangled Adventure&quot;, &quot;Monsters At Work&quot; and &quot;Wish&quot; alumni Tom Caulfield revealed that he alongside &quot;The Ghost and Molly McGee&quot; creators Bill Motz and Bob Roth pitched a crossover series featuring &quot;The Rescuers&quot; and &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; at Disney Television Animation. The series would have featured the descendant of Basil working at a modern version of The Rescue Aid Society more akin to &quot;The Kingsman&quot; or lead by Bianca. According to Caulfield the project was scrapped due the release of the &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot; film&quot;.&quot;

<text>Susuwatari (, ; &quot;wandering soot&quot;), also called Makkuro kurosuke (; &quot;makkuro&quot; meaning &quot;pitch black&quot;, &quot;kuro&quot; meaning &quot;black&quot; and &quot;-suke&quot; being a common ending for male names), is the name of a fictitious sprite that was devised by Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, known from the famous anime-productions &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; (1988) and &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (2001) where, in the former, they are identified as &quot;black soots&quot; in early subtitles, as &quot;soot sprites&quot; or &quot;dust bunnies&quot; in the Streamline Pictures English dub, and as &quot;soot [[gremlin]]s&quot; in the Walt Disney Studios English dubbed version.

== Description ==
Susuwatari are described and shown as golf ball-sized, pitch-black and fuzzy-haired beings with two large eyes and long, thin limbs. They move by hovering around, but they can extend stick-like limbs from their bodies to do certain tasks, and can lift objects many times their own weight. They make a squeaky murmuring sound when excited, and dissolve into powder (soot) if crushed.

==&quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;==
In &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, the house the main characters move into is full of Susuwatari, which are rationalized as &quot;Makkuro Kurosuke&quot;, an optical illusion caused by moving quickly from light into darkness. Seeing that the family consists of good people, the Susuwatari leave the house to move to another abandoned area.

==&quot;Spirited Away&quot;==
They later reappeared in &quot;Spirited Away&quot; as workers in Kamaji&#x27;s boiler room.

The protagonist Sen (Chihiro) befriends a number of them by helping them carry coal. Sen is told that if these Susuwatari are not given a job to do, they turn back into soot. Another character, Lin, feeds the Susuwatari much like farmers feed chickens, throwing handfuls of the Japanese candy konpeitō onto the ground for them to eat. After Sen is accepted among the staff of the bathhouse, chiefly by Kamaji and Lin, the Susuwatari become almost admiring of her, and help her in their small ways.

==&quot;Zen - Grogu and Dust Bunnies&quot;==
In 2022, Studio Ghibli and Lucasfilm collaborated on a Star Wars short for Disney+ where &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; character Grogu interacts with a band of dust bunnies that give him a flower as a gift.

<text>In linguistics, an object is any of several types of arguments. In subject-prominent, nominative-accusative languages such as English, a transitive verb typically distinguishes between its subject and any of its objects, which can include but are not limited to direct objects, indirect objects, and arguments of adpositions (prepositions or postpositions); the latter are more accurately termed &quot;oblique arguments&quot;, thus including other arguments not covered by core grammatical roles, such as those governed by case morphology (as in languages such as Latin) or relational nouns (as is typical for members of the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area).
In ergative-absolutive languages, for example most Australian Aboriginal languages, the term &quot;subject&quot; is ambiguous, and thus the term &quot;agent&quot; is often used instead to contrast with &quot;object&quot;, such that basic word order is often spoken of in terms such as Agent-Object-Verb (AOV) instead of Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). Topic-prominent languages, such as Mandarin, focus their grammars less on the subject-object or agent-object dichotomies but rather on the pragmatic dichotomy of topic and comment.

==Types==

===English===
In English traditional grammar types, three types of object are acknowledged: &quot;direct objects&quot;, &quot;indirect objects&quot;, and &quot;objects of prepositions&quot;. These object types are illustrated in the following table:

Indirect objects are frequently expressed as objects of prepositions, complicating the traditional typology; e.g. &quot;I gave salt &quot;to the man&quot;.&quot;

===Other languages===

Some Chinese verbs can have two direct objects, one being more closely bound to the verb than the other; these may be called &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; objects.

Secundative languages lack a distinction between direct and indirect objects, but rather distinguish primary and secondary objects. Many African languages fall into this typological category.

==Syntactic category==
While the typical object is a pronoun, noun, or noun phrase, objects can also appear as other syntactic categories, as illustrated in the following table for the English language:

==Identification==
A number of criteria can be employed for identifying objects, e.g.:

::1. Subject of passive sentence: Most objects in active sentences can become the subject in the corresponding passive sentences.

::2. Position occupied: In languages with strict word order, the subject and the object tend to occupy set positions in unmarked declarative clauses.

::3. Morphological case: In languages that have case systems, objects are marked by certain cases (accusative, dative, genitive, instrumental, etc.).

Languages vary significantly with respect to these criteria. The first criterion identifies objects reliably most of the time in English, e.g.

::Fred gave me a book. 
::a. A book was given (to) me. 
::b. I was given a book.

The second criterion is also a reliable criterion for analytic languages such as English, since the relatively strict word order of English usually positions the object after the verb(s) in declarative sentences. In the majority of languages with fixed word order, the subject precedes the object. However, the opposite is true for the very small proportion (approximately 2.9%) of the world&#x27;s languages that utilize object–subject word order by default.

==Verb classes==
Verbs can be classified according to the number and/or type of objects that they do or do not take. The following table provides an overview of some of the various verb classes:

Ergative and object-deletion verbs can be transitive or intransitive, as indicated in the following table:

The distinction drawn here between ergative and object-deletion verbs is based on the role of the subject. The object of a transitive ergative verb is the subject of the corresponding intransitive ergative verb. With object-deletion verbs, in contrast, the subject is consistent regardless of whether an object is or is not present.

==In sentence structure==
Objects are distinguished from subjects in the syntactic trees that represent sentence structure. The subject appears (as high or) higher in the syntactic structure than the object. The following trees of a dependency grammar illustrate the hierarchical positions of subjects and objects:

The subject is in blue, and the object in orange. The subject is consistently a dependent of the finite verb, whereas the object is a dependent of the lowest non-finite verb if such a verb is present.

<doc id="201458" wikidata="Q230823" url="?curid=201458" title="Miniskirt">
<text>A miniskirt (sometimes hyphenated as mini-skirt, separated as mini skirt, or sometimes shortened to simply mini) is a skirt with its hemline well above the knees, generally at mid-thigh level, normally no longer than below the buttocks; and a dress with such a hemline is called a minidress or a miniskirt dress. A micro-miniskirt or microskirt is a miniskirt with its hemline at the upper thigh, at or just below crotch or underwear level.

Short skirts have existed for a long time before they made it into mainstream fashion, though they were generally not called &quot;mini&quot; until they became a fashion trend in the 1960s. Instances of clothing resembling miniskirts have been identified by archaeologists and historians as far back as –1370 BC. In the early 20th century, the dancer Josephine Baker&#x27;s banana skirt that she wore for her mid-1920s performances in the Folies Bergère was subsequently likened to a miniskirt. Extremely short skirts became a staple of 20th-century science fiction, particularly in 1940s pulp artwork, such as that by Earle K. Bergey, who depicted futuristic women in a &quot;stereotyped combination&quot; of metallic miniskirt, bra and boots.

 and gradually climbed upward over the next few years. By 1966, some designs had the hem at the upper thigh. Stockings with suspenders (garters) were not considered practical with miniskirts and were replaced with coloured tights. The popular acceptance of miniskirts peaked in the &quot;Swinging London&quot; of the 1960s, and has continued to be commonplace, particularly among younger women and teenage girls. Before that time, short skirts were only seen in sport and dance clothing, such as skirts worn by female tennis players, figure skaters, cheerleaders, and dancers.

Several designers have been credited with the invention of the 1960s miniskirt, most significantly the London-based designer Mary Quant and the Parisian André Courrèges.

== History ==
=== History in China ===
In the Warring States period of China, men could wear short skirts similar to a kilt. In the Qin dynasty, the first imperial dynasty of China, some short skirts worn by men were short enough to reach the mid-thighs as observed in the Terracotta army of Qin Shihuang. Han Chinese women also wore short outer skirts, such as the () and the (); however, they had to be worn over a long skirt. One of the earliest known cultures where women regularly wore clothing resembling miniskirts was a subgroup of the Miao people of China, the (). In albums produced during the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) from the early eighteenth century onward to illustrate the various types of Miao, the women were depicted wearing &quot;mini skirts that barely cover the buttocks.&quot; At least one of the &quot;One Hundred Miao Pictures&quot; albums contains a poem that specifically describes how the women&#x27;s short skirts and navel-baring styles were an identifier for this particular group.

=== History in Europe and America ===

==== Pre-1960s ====
Figurines produced by the Vinča culture (–4500 BC) have been interpreted by archaeologists as representing women in miniskirt-like garments. One of the oldest surviving garments resembling a miniskirt is short and woolen with bronze ornaments. It was worn by the Egtved Girl for her burial in the Nordic Bronze Age (–1370 BCE).

Russian writer Pavel Melnikov-Pechersky has noted numerous times in his ethnographic works about the 19th century Mordvin (Erzya and Moksha) people that their culture valued the beauty of female legs, and Mordvin women could wear short (a kind of traditional skirt).

In 1922, skirts were shortened and could now reach the mid-shin rather than just the ankle. The banana skirt worn by the dancer Josephine Baker for her mid-1920s performances in the Folies Bergère was subsequently likened to a miniskirt. Prior to being censored in 1934, cartoon character Betty Boop also wore a short skirt. In the 20th century until the 1960 woman did generally not wear skirts above the knee. Exceptions included stage performers or showgirls like Josephine Baker, athletes, and competitive dancers. During the 1950s, even the skirts of cheerleaders and many ballerinas fell to the calf. Women were taught to keep their knees covered, seat themselves in ways that kept the legs together, or maintain other postures to avoid being viewed as sexually promiscuous. Nevertheless, miniskirts were beginning to emerge by this time. Two notable examples that showed miniskirts were the science fiction films &quot;Flight to Mars&quot; (1951) and &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; (1956).

===== Mid-20th century science fiction =====

Extremely short skirts became a staple of 20th-century science fiction, particularly in 1940s pulp artwork such as that by Earle K. Bergey, who depicted futuristic women in a &quot;stereotyped combination&quot; of metallic miniskirt, bra and boots. The &quot;sci-fi miniskirt&quot; was seen in genre films and television programmes as well as on comic book covers. The very short skirts worn by regular female characters Carol and Tonga (played by Virginia Hewitt and Nina Bara) in the 1950–55 television series &quot;Space Patrol&quot; are considered as probably the first &#x27;micro-minis&#x27; to have been seen on American television. Only one formal complaint relating to the skirts has been known, by an advertisement agency regarding an upwards shot of Carol climbing a ladder. Hewitt pointed out that even though the complainant claimed they could see up her skirt, her matching tights rendered her effectively clothed from neck to ankle. Otherwise, &quot;Space Patrol&quot; was applauded for being wholesome and family-friendly, even though the women&#x27;s short skirts would have been unacceptable in other contexts. Although the 30th-century women in &quot;Space Patrol&quot; were empowered, experts in their field, and largely treated as equals, &quot;it was the skirts that fuelled indelible memories.&quot; The &quot;Space Patrol&quot; skirts were not the shortest to be broadcast at the time. The German-made American 1954 series &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; showed Dale Arden (played by Irene Champlin) in an even shorter skirt.

=== 1960s ===
The manager of an unnamed shop in London&#x27;s Oxford Street began experimenting in 1960 with skirt hemlines an inch above the knees on window mannequins and noted how positively his customers responded. In August 1961, &quot;Life&quot; published a photograph of two Seattle students at the University of Hawaiʻi wearing above-the-knee garments called &quot;kookie-muus&quot;, an abbreviated version of the traditionally concealing muumuu, and noted a &quot;current teen-age fad for short skirts&quot; that was pushing hemlines well above the knee. The article also showed young fashionable girls in San Francisco wearing hemlines &quot;just above the kneecap&quot; and students at Vanderbilt University wearing &quot;knee ticklers&quot; ending three inches above their knee when playing golf. The caption commented that such short skirts were selling well in the South and that &quot;some Atlanta girls&quot; were cutting old skirts to &quot;thigh high&quot; lengths.

Extremely short skirts, some as much as eight inches above the knee, were observed in Britain in the summer of 1962. The young women who wore these short skirts were called &quot;Ya-Ya girls&quot;, a term derived from &quot;yeah, yeah&quot; which was a popular catcall at the time. One retailer noted that the fashion for layered net crinoline petticoats raised the hems of short skirts even higher. The earliest known reference to the miniskirt is in a humorous 1962 article datelined Mexico City and describing the &quot;mini-skirt&quot; or &quot;Ya-Ya&quot; as a controversial item of clothing that was the latest thing on the production line there. The article characterised the miniskirt as stopping eight inches above the knee. It referred to a writing by a psychiatrist, whose name it did not provide, who had argued that the miniskirt was a youthful protest of international threats to peace. Much of the article described the reactions of men, who were said to favour the fashion on young women to whom they were unrelated, but to oppose it on their own wives and fiancées.

Only a very few people, including an avant-garde in the UK, wore such lengths in the beginning years of the decade. The standard hemline for public and designer garments in the early sixties was mid-knee, just covering the knee. It would gradually climb upward over the next few years, fully baring the knees of mainstream models in 1964, when both André Courrèges and Mary Quant showed above-the-knee lengths, followed shortly thereafter by Rudi Gernreich and Jacques Tiffeau in the US. The following year, skirts continued to rise as British miniskirts were officially introduced to the US in a New York show whose models&#x27; thigh-high skirts stopped traffic. By 1966, many designs had the hem at the upper thigh. Towards the end of the 1960s, an even shorter version of the miniskirt, called the microskirt or micro-mini, emerged.
The shape of miniskirts in the 1960s was distinctive. They were not the squeezingly tight skirts designed to show off every curve that 1950s sheath skirts had been, nor were they shortened versions of the tightly belted, petticoat-bolstered 1950s circle skirt. In the 1990s and later, exhibitions on the sixties would occasionally present vintage miniskirts pulled in tight against gallery mannequins, but sixties miniskirts were not worn tight in that way. Sixties miniskirts were simply-constructed, uninhibiting, slightly flared A-line shapes, with some straight and tapered forms seen in the early years of their existence. This shape was seen as deriving from two forms of the 1950s: (1) the shift dress, a waistless, tapered column introduced by Givenchy in 1955, presaged by Karl Lagerfeld in 1954, and refined by Givenchy and Balenciaga in 1957 under the names sack dress or chemise dress, and (2) the trapeze dresses popularized by Yves Saint Laurent in 1958 that were a variation of Dior&#x27;s 1955 A-line, both of a geometric triangular shaping. In silhouette, the minidresses of the mid-1960s were basically abbreviated versions of the shift dress and trapeze dress, with Paco Rabanne&#x27;s famous metal and plastic minidresses of 1966 and 1967 following the trapeze line and most of Rudi Gernreich&#x27;s following the shift line. Mary Quant and other British designers, as well as Betsey Johnson in the US, also showed minidresses that resembled elongated rugby jerseys, body-skimming but not tight. When skirts were worn alone, they tended to sit on the hips rather than holding the waist, called hipster minis if they were really low on the hips. The fashionable forms of the microminis of the later 1960s were also not tight, often looking somewhat tunic-like and in fabrics like Qiana.

In addition, sixties miniskirts were not worn with high heels but with flats or low heels, for a natural stance, a natural stride, and to enhance the fashionable child-like look of the time, seen as a reaction to 1950s artifice like stiletto heels, constrained waists, padded busts, and movement-inhibiting skirts. Another way youth was indicated in the new short skirts was through using models with slim but muscular legs, as preferred by designers André Courrèges and Emanuel Ungaro at the time. The designer Mary Quant was quoted as saying that &quot;short short skirts&quot; indicated youthfulness, which was seen as desirable, fashion-wise.

In the UK, skirts shortened to less than were classed as children&#x27;s garments rather than adult clothes. Children&#x27;s clothing was not subject to purchase tax whereas adult clothing was. The avoidance of tax meant that the price was correspondingly less.

Stockings with suspenders (American English: &quot;&quot;) were not considered practical with miniskirts and were replaced with coloured tights. Legs could also be covered with knee-high socks or various heights of boots, lower-calf height in 1964–65, knee-heights throughout the period, over-the-knee and thigh-high boots more 1967–69, and even boot-hose or body boots (tights incorporating a shoe sole and heel to form a waist-high boot), often in stretch vinyl. Sandal straps or laces might crisscross or otherwise rise up the leg, even as high as the thigh, and body paints were offered for a time to add colour to the leg in more individualised ways than wearing tights.

During the late 1960s, as most skirts became shorter and shorter, designers began offering a few alternatives. Calf-length midi-skirts were introduced in 1966–67, and floor-length maxi-skirts appeared around the same time after being seen on hippies first around 1965–66. Like miniskirts, these were overwhelmingly casual in feel and simply constructed to a two-straight-side-seams A-line shape. Women in the late sixties welcomed these new styles as options but did not necessarily wear them, feeling societal pressure to shorten their skirts instead.

Decades later, starting in the late nineties, the term midi-skirt would be expanded to refer to any calf-length skirt from any era, including skirts of that length from the 1930s, 1950s, and 1980s of any shape, and the term maxi-skirt would be expanded to apply to any floor-length skirt from any era, including ballgowns. This was not the case during a period from the late 1960s to the 1980s, when the term midi-skirt only applied to casual, simply-cut A-line calf-length skirts of the late sixties and earliest seventies and the term maxi-skirt only applied to casual, simply-cut A-line floor-length skirts of the late sixties and earliest seventies. Even the full, calf-length skirts worn from the mid-seventies to the early eighties were not called midi-skirts at the time, as that was by 1974 considered a passė term restricted only to a specific shape of skirt from the late sixties and earliest seventies.

As designers attempted to require women to switch to midi-skirts in 1969 and 1970, women, especially in the US, responded by ignoring them, continuing to wear minis and microminis and turning to trousers like those endorsed by Yves Saint Laurent in 1968, a trend that would dominate the 1970s.

==== Designer claims ====
Several designers have been credited with the invention of the 1960s miniskirt, most significantly the London-based designer Mary Quant and the Parisian André Courrèges. Although Quant reportedly named the skirt after her favourite make of car, the Mini, there is no consensus as to who designed it first. Valerie Steele has noted that the claim that Quant was first is more convincingly supported by evidence than the equivalent Courrèges claim. However, the contemporary fashion journalist Marit Allen, who edited the influential &quot;Young Ideas&quot; pages for UK &quot;Vogue&quot;, firmly stated that the British designer John Bates was the first to offer fashionable miniskirts. Other designers, including Pierre Cardin and Yves Saint Laurent, had also been raising hemlines at the same time.

;Mary Quant
The miniskirt is one of the garments most widely associated with Mary Quant. Quant herself is ambivalent about the claim that she invented the miniskirt, stating that her customers should take credit, as she herself wore very short skirts, and they requested even shorter hemlines for themselves. Regardless of whether or not Quant invented the miniskirt, it is widely agreed that she was one of its highest-profile champions. Contrary to obvious and popular belief, Quant named the garment after the Mini Cooper, a favourite car of hers, stating that the car and the skirt were both &quot;optimistic, exuberant, young, flirty&quot;, and complemented each other.

Quant had started experimenting with shorter skirts in the late 1950s, when she started making her own designs up to stock her boutique on the King&#x27;s Road. Among her inspirations was the memory of seeing a young tap-dancer wearing a &quot;tiny skirt over thick black tights&quot;, influencing her designs for young, active women who did not wish to resemble their mothers. In addition to the miniskirt, Quant is often credited with inventing the coloured and patterned tights that tended to accompany the garment, although their creation is also attributed to the Spanish couturier Cristóbal Balenciaga who offered harlequin-patterned tights in 1962 or to Bates.

In 2009, a Mary Quant minidress was among the 10 British &quot;design classics&quot; featured on a series of Royal Mail stamps, alongside the Tube map, the Spitfire, and the red telephone box.

;André Courrèges
Courrèges explicitly claimed that he invented the mini, and accused Quant of only &quot;commercialising&quot; it. He presented short skirts measuring four inches above the knee in January 1965 for that year&#x27;s Spring/Summer collection, although some sources claim that Courrèges had been designing miniskirts as early as 1961, the year he launched his couture house. The collection, which also included trouser suits and cut-out backs and midriffs, was designed for a new type of athletic, active young woman. Courrèges had presented &quot;above-the-knee&quot; skirts in his August 1964 haute couture presentation which was proclaimed the &quot;best show seen so far&quot; for that season by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The Courrèges look, featuring a knit bodystocking with a gabardine miniskirt slung around the hips, was widely copied and plagiarised, much to the designer&#x27;s chagrin, and it would be 1967 before he again held a press showing for his work. Steele has described Courrèges&#x27;s work as a &quot;brilliant couture version of youth fashion&quot; whose sophistication far outshone Quant&#x27;s work, although she champions the Quant claim. Others, such as Jess Cartner-Morley of &quot;The Guardian&quot; explicitly credit him, rather than Quant, as the miniskirt&#x27;s creator.

;John Bates and others
The idea that John Bates, rather than Quant or Courrèges, innovated the miniskirt had an influential champion in Marit Allen, who as editor of the influential &quot;Young Ideas&quot; pages for UK &quot;Vogue&quot;, kept track of up-and-coming young designers. In 1966 she chose Bates to design her mini-length wedding outfit in white gabardine and silver PVC. In January 1965 Bates&#x27;s &quot;skimp dress&quot; with its &quot;short-short skirt&quot; was featured in &quot;Vogue,&quot; and would later be chosen as the Dress of the Year. Bates was also famous for having designed mini-coats and dresses and other outfits for Emma Peel (played by Diana Rigg) in the TV series &quot;The Avengers&quot;, although the manufacturers blocked his request for patterned tights to enable Emma Peel to fight in skirts if necessary.

An alternative origin story for the miniskirt came from Barbara Hulanicki of the London boutique Biba, who recalled that in 1966 she received a delivery of stretchy jersey skirts that had shrunk drastically in transit. Much to her surprise, the ten-inch long garments rapidly sold out.

In 1967 Rudi Gernreich was among the first American designers to offer miniskirts, in the face of strongly worded censure and criticism from American couturiers James Galanos and Norman Norell. Criticism of the miniskirt also came from the Paris couturier Coco Chanel, who declared the style &quot;disgusting&quot; despite being herself famed for supporting shorter skirts in the 1920s.

==== Reception ====

Owing to Quant&#x27;s position in the heart of fashionable &quot;Swinging London&quot;, the miniskirt was able to spread beyond a simple street fashion into a major international trend, with not only significant aesthetic value but also considerable political worth. The style came into prominence in Australia when Jean Shrimpton wore a short white shift dress, made by Colin Rolfe, on 30 October 1965 at Derby Day, first day of the annual Melbourne Cup Carnival in Australia, where it caused a sensation. According to Shrimpton, who claimed that the brevity of the skirt was due mainly to Rolfe&#x27;s having insufficient material, the ensuing controversy was as much as anything to do with her having dispensed with a hat and gloves, seen as essential accessories in such a conservative society.

At the same time, there was some opposition in the US to miniskirts as bad influences on the young, but this waned as people became more accustomed to them. Some European countries banned mini-skirts from being worn in public, claiming they were an invitation to rapists. In response, Quant retorted that there was clearly no understanding of the tights worn underneath.

Miniskirts arose at the same time women were beginning to wear trousers more in public, and both were controversial. Just as many schools attempted to control skirt hems via dress codes, many public establishments attempted to restrict women&#x27;s wearing of pants by enforcing their own sartorial rules. Women sometimes forced establishments to make a choice between miniskirts and pants by trying to enter restaurants in tunic-topped pantsuits and then removing their trousers when restaurant staff objected, leaving the women in ultra-short mini-tunics that restaurants had to accept because their own rules stated that it was okay for women to wear skirts, an absurd outcome that eventually helped lead restaurants to relax their dress codes.

The response to the miniskirt was particularly harsh in Africa, where many state governments saw them as an un-African garment and part of the corrupting influence of the West. Young city-dwelling African women who wore Western clothing such as the miniskirt were particularly at risk of attack based on their clothing, although Robert Ross notes that gender roles and politics were also a key factor. The urban woman earning her own living and independence was seen as a threat to masculine authority, particularly if she wore clothing seen as un-African. Short skirts were seen as indicating that their wearer was a prostitute, and by conflation, a witch who drained male-dominated society of its vitality and energy. In addition to prostitutes and witches, miniskirts also became associated with secretaries, schoolgirls and undergraduates, and young women with &quot;&quot; as lovers or boyfriends. Andrew M. Ivaska has noted that these various tropes boiled down to a basic fear of female power, fear that a woman would use her education or sexual power to control men and/or achieve her own independence, and that the miniskirt therefore became a tangible object of these fears.

In 1968, the Youth League of Tanzania&#x27;s ruling TANU party launched Operation Vijana. Organised and run by young men, Vijana was a morality campaign targeting indecent clothing, which led to attacks on women with at least one stoning reportedly triggered by the victim&#x27;s miniskirt. Gangs of youths patrolled bus stations and streets looking for women dressed &quot;inappropriately&quot;, and dealing out physical attacks and beatings. In Ethiopia, an attack on women wearing miniskirts triggered a riot of leftist students in which a hundred cars were set on fire and fifty people injured.

Kamuzu Banda, president of Malawi, described miniskirts as a &quot;diabolic fashion which must disappear from the country once and for all.&quot; It is also reported that Kenneth Kaunda, president of Zambia, cited apartheid and the miniskirt as his two primary hates. By the mid-1970s the Zanzibar revolutionary party had forbidden both women and men from wearing a long list of garments, hairstyles and cosmetics, including miniskirts.

In the Soviet Union, miniskirts became widely known after the 1967 Moscow International Fashion Festival, and quickly made their way into popular media, including movies (&quot;The Diamond Arm&quot;, &quot;Afonya&quot;, &quot;Office Romance&quot;; an earlier 1956 film &quot;Carnival Night&quot; also featured dancers wearing short dresses and a conservative Soviet bureaucrat outraged by their &quot;naked legs&quot;), cartoons (&quot;The Bremen Town Musicians&quot;) and sci-fi works (i.e. &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; and &quot;The Final Circle of Paradise&quot;), despite strong criticism from senior citizens and attempts to control skirt lengths in public (which continued well into the 1980s - for example, hard rock vocalist Elena Sokolova has angered the authorities by wearing an extremely short skirt on stage during her performance at the festival). One of the best known Soviet designers of miniskirts was Vyacheslav Zaitsev. Short skirts and dresses remain popular in modern day Russia (except for some conservative Muslim regions like Dagestan, where wearing miniskirts is strongly frowned upon and discouraged by travel advisories).

=== Post-1960s ===

==== 1970s ====
From 1969 onwards, the fashion industry largely returned to longer skirts such as the midi and the maxi, with even Mary Quant showing no above-the-knee skirts for 1970. Journalist Christopher Booker gave two reasons for this reaction: firstly, that &quot;there was almost nowhere else to go ... the mini-skirts could go no higher&quot;; and secondly, in his view, &quot;dressed up in mini-skirts and shiny PVC macs, given such impersonal names as &#x27;dolly birds&#x27;, girls had been transformed into throwaway plastic objects&quot;. This lengthening of hemlines coincided with the growth of the feminist movement. However, in the 1960s the mini had been regarded as a symbol of liberation, and it was worn by some, such as Germaine Greer and, in the following decade, Gloria Steinem. Greer herself wrote in 1969 that:

In the earliest seventies, particularly in the US, minis and microminis briefly rebounded in popularity after women&#x27;s rejection of designers&#x27; attempt to impose midiskirts as the sole length in 1970, referred to as &quot;the midi debacle.&quot; Women both continued to wear miniskirts and switched even more to trousers, and designers, having been made to understand that they would no longer be respected as arbiters, followed suit for a couple of years and included minis again, often underneath midis and maxis. Unlike in the 1960s, minis during this period might be worn with chunky platform shoes, often with high wedge heels. In 1971, almost all designers, even upper-echelon couture designers, showed hot pants, also presented in combination with midiskirts, maxiskirts, and minis. They continued to express a desire for women to wear longer skirts, though, and soon those women who had not switched entirely to jeans and trousers were often wearing their skirts at the knee. In 1973, Kenzo made calf-length skirts look new by cutting them fuller and in lighter fabrics for a style that was very different from the midi and women soon accepted this, making it one of the characteristic styles of the mid-seventies, one that would last into the early eighties, sometimes dropping to the ankle.

Although miniskirts had mostly disappeared from mainstream fashion by the mid-&#x27;70s, prompting the leading designer of the time, Yves Saint Laurent, to say, &quot;I don&#x27;t think short skirts will ever come back,&quot; they never entirely went away, with women having to be pressured by the fashion industry to abandon above-the-knee skirts as late as 1974, miniskirt stalwart André Courrèges continuing to show them, and even some mainstream designers like Halston, Kenzo, and Karl Lagerfeld offering a few mini-tunics and mini-blousons among the standard calf-length dirndl skirts of the mid-seventies Big Look period. In these occasional high-fashion versions of the mid-seventies, mini was taken to mean any length above the knee. Enough above-the-knee skirts were shown in Paris in 1976 for fashion writers to suggest a possible mini revival, but these were never broadly taken up by the general public, which was still gravitating toward below-the-knee dirndls.

Around 1976, punks began including among their array of clothes intended to shock very short miniskirts in materials like black leather, rubber, PVC, tartan, and even trash bag plastic, the unfashionable length shocking almost as much as the aggressive materials. Punks of this period also introduced the wearing of miniskirts with then-very-out-of-style high-heeled, late-1950s pumps, which they got at thrift shops, a combination not worn in the 1960s and unthinkable during the 1950s. Though not at all mainstream, these punk looks would influence bands that came after them into wearing more sixties-looking miniskirts again, as evidenced by Deborah Harry of the group Blondie, Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson of The B-52&#x27;s, Fay Fife of The Revillos, Rhoda Dakar of The Bodysnatchers, Siouxsie Sioux of Siouxsie and the Banshees, and the group The Slits, who often wore miniskirts during the &quot;new wave&quot; era of the late &#x27;70s. Some of these performers were part of a few sixties-revival subcultures that came in the wake of punk and included Mod revival and ska revival, both of whose female adherents sought out authentic-looking early miniskirts as part of their sixties-revival look. Blondie&#x27;s Deborah Harry had her sixties-ish look provided by fashion designer Stephen Sprouse, who had been responsible for Halston&#x27;s &quot;skimp&quot; minis of 1974 and would become internationally known for his own sixties-revival line during the eighties. The song &quot;(I Don&#x27;t Want to Go to) Chelsea&quot; (1978), by new wave artist Elvis Costello, contains the line in the chorus: &quot;There&#x27;s no place here for the mini-skirt waddle.&quot;

During the seventies, when males and females typically wore identical denim cutoff shorts instead of miniskirts if they wanted short lengths, the female cast members of the US TV show &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, known as the &quot;Hee Haw Honeys&quot;, always wore country-style minidresses even during the miniskirt&#x27;s fashion hiatus in the late &#x27;70s and early &#x27;80s; and as mentioned above, female tennis players, figure skaters, cheerleaders, and dancers also wore short skirts.

Toward the end of the seventies, in 1978 and &#x27;79, some of the above-the-knee skirt looks that would become associated with the eighties began to be introduced, including the flounced, hip-yoked style debuted by Norma Kamali and Perry Ellis in 1979 and called rah-rah skirts in the UK and above-the-knee versions of the tight sheath skirt, with even Yves Saint Laurent showing some above-the-knee lengths. The sixties-revival subcultures emanating from the UK seemed to reach the high fashion world somewhat in 1979, as a few Paris catwalks presented styles seemingly pulled right out of the sixties, including miniskirts inspired by Courrèges, Rabanne, and Gernreich. Courrèges himself revived some of his sixties styles that year. Some fashion writers even proclaimed a miniskirt revival for 1979-80, particularly from Paris designers. At this point, these styles were still considered avant-garde, though, and a variety of mostly longer skirts were worn by the public, with the full, calf-length forms that had dominated the mid-seventies still prevalent but beginning to be made slimmer, slightly shorter, more brightly coloured, and often slit. The mainstream return of the miniskirt would not come until the 1980s.

==== Post 1970s; 1980s and 1990s ====
Miniskirts returned to mainstream acceptance in the 1980s, but with some differences from the 1960s:

Because women had worn skirts that covered the knee and often dropped to the calf for so many years during the 1970s, any skirt above the knee was often called a miniskirt in the late seventies and early eighties, even skirts that hit just above the knee.

They were not presented this time as the only length women should wear, nor was there societal pressure for women to shorten their hemlines, as there had been in the late 1960s when designers also presented a variety of lengths. They were now just one option among a variety of lengths and styles of skirts and pants available to women, and miniskirts tended to be in the minority among all the other kinds of skirts and pants seen on the streets, particularly in the early part of the decade. Throughout the decade, street lengths ranged from ankle to thigh, for both skirts and trousers, and most women wore their skirts just below the knee, as they also had in the seventies.

Miniskirts came in a greater variety of shapes than in the sixties, from full and flouncy to narrow to tight to abbreviated revivals of skirt shapes of the 1940s and &#x27;50s like sheath skirts, trumpet skirts, tulip skirts, and bubble/puffball skirts. Above-the-knee versions of strapless 1950s dresses were seen, as were formal minis with bustles and trains in the back. Even tutus were shown mid-decade. Many above-the-knee dresses had noticeable shoulder pads.

They were worn with a greater range of heel heights than in the sixties, depending on the shape of the miniskirt, with flats preferred for some styles and high-heeled pumps preferred for others. In the early part of the decade, opaque tights, sometimes brightly coloured, and flat, calf-high boots might be worn with the more casual styles, much like in the mid-sixties. Throughout the period, dressier styles with high heels tended to be worn with hose ranging from slightly tinted to opaque. A punk influence was sometimes seen when miniskirts were paired with combat boots or Doc Martens.

Another difference between 1960s miniskirts and 1980s miniskirts is that 1980s miniskirts might be worn over footless tights, long tight shorts, various lengths of thermal underwear, or tight, cropped pants, a trend that began with designers like Norma Kamali, Perry Ellis, and Willi Smith in 1979. In the early eighties, the footless tights might be referred to by the 1950s terms clamdiggers, pedal-pushers, capri pants, or toreadors, depending on their length, but in the second half of the eighties, all footless tights began to be referred to as leggings. Also at the end of the eighties, visible bike shorts were often worn with miniskirts.

In the early eighties, miniskirts were still considered avant-garde and unusual among the public, though designers had begun showing them again in 1979 and had begun shortening some skirts to just above the knee in 1978. Some minis from 1979 and &#x27;80 were modeled after sweatshirts. Others were lifted straight out of the Space Age mid-sixties. Some were inspired by punk.

The most influential designer of miniskirts in the early eighties was probably Norma Kamali. In 1980, when there was a fad for wearing oversized sweatshirts as minidresses, she introduced sweatshirt-fabric versions of the flounced, hip-yoked, above-the-knee skirts she had first presented in 1979, called rah-rah skirts in the UK. In 1981 and &#x27;82, miniskirts from this &quot;Sweats&quot; line would reach mainstream levels of popularity and make Kamali a household name.
In the spring of 1982 (as featured in the June issue of &quot;Time Magazine&quot; that year), short skirts began to re-emerge more strongly among the public, notably in the form of &quot;rah-rahs&quot;, which were modeled on those worn by female cheerleaders at sporting and other events.

By 1983, miniskirts had become more widespread, but the Kamali-style full versions common in 1981-82 had waned in popularity in favor of slim, straight minis in jean-cut blue denim, as well as other trim styles.

Kenzo had been almost the only designer to champion miniskirts during their nadir in the mid-seventies, and he was vindicated in the eighties as several of the miniskirt styles he had shown back then were taken up by other designers.

Yves Saint Laurent had believed short skirts would never return in the mid-seventies, but he led the move to above-the-knee skirts starting in 1978 and during the first half of the eighties was known for his slim, black leather miniskirts and other brief styles.

Karl Lagerfeld had begun showing miniskirts again at the end of the seventies and in 1983 would take over the house of Chanel, where he soon began adding minis and microminis to the offerings, a surprise because Chanel herself had hated 1960s miniskirts, considering the knees to be an ugly part of the body.

Throughout the 1980s, beginning at the end of the seventies, designers experimented with shortening heavily constructed historical dress styles, mostly from the 1950s, with fifties crinoline skirts, fifties sheath skirts, and fifties bubble/puffball skirts shown in above-the-knee lengths as early as 1979. Styles from the deeper past were also shortened. In the early eighties, Perry Ellis referenced the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries by altering the shape of the flouncy, hip-yoked miniskirts he&#x27;d been showing since 1979. In 1980, he bolstered them with petticoats and added stiffening to extend them out to the sides, causing some fashion writers to compare them to panniers. The following year, he added stuffed-organdy padding to the skirts and referred to them as farthingales, a sixteenth-century term for a similarly padded floor-length skirt. A far more influential example of a truncated historical skirt style came from former punk designer Vivienne Westwood. In 1985, British designer Westwood offered her first &quot;mini-crini,&quot; an abbreviated version of the Victorian crinoline. Its mini-length, bouffant silhouette inspired the puffball skirts widely presented by more established designers such as Christian Lacroix. In 1989, Westwood&#x27;s mini-crini was described as having combined two conflicting ideals – the crinoline, representing a &quot;mythology of restriction and encumbrance in woman&#x27;s dress&quot;, and the &quot;equally dubious mythology of liberation&quot; associated with the miniskirt.

Sixties-revivalist Stephen Sprouse showed his first collection in 1983 and favored almost period-perfect shift minidresses and trapeze minidresses in graffiti prints, blacks, and searing sixties brights, including fluorescents, with geometric paillettes and sixties-style cutouts, sometimes of peace signs. Some of his microminis were in patent leather. Unlike in the sixties, he showed these clothes with eighties shoe shapes like high-heeled pumps and Doc Martens.

A style that would be seen off and on throughout the decade but would become common in the second half of the eighties was the tight, stretch minidress worn with high-heeled eighties pumps and often padded shoulders. In silhouette, this was sort of an abbreviated, less heavily constructed version of 1950s sheath skirts. These forms of tight, blatantly seductive 1980s minis were shown on bodies that were voluptuous and/or muscular instead of thin and child-like as in the sixties. When these stretch minidresses were paired with sixties-style makeup and accessories, it was a lesson in the differences between sixties minis and eighties minis.

In the mid-1980s, Azzedine Alaïa began presenting mini and micromini versions of his extremely tight dress designs, his anatomical seaming and occasional sheer fabrics creating a prurient effect that would never have been seen in sixties miniskirts. His miniskirts, though, also included some that resembled flippy skating skirts and others that were grass-like raffia so short they barely covered the wearer. His earlier fitted, curve-accenting skirts, usually in a just-above-the-knee length that sometimes rose to the lower thigh, would be very influential in the second half of the decade, spawning imitations by companies like North Beach Leather and Body Glove.

During the mid- to late eighties, Patrick Kelly put his own whimsical signature on the familiar, high-heel-accompanied, tight, stretch minidresses of the decade, covering them with bright buttons, bright bowties, cartoon faces, etc.

For fall of 1987 and spring of &#x27;88, designers united in presenting a great proportion of miniskirts in almost all collections, with very few mainstream designers bucking the trend. Though a few designers showed these minis in somewhat sixties shapes with flat shoes or boots, most showed truncated versions of eighties suits and cocktail dresses with slightly narrower shoulders, worn with high-heeled over-the-knee boots or high-heeled eighties pumps that looked like pumps from the late fifties/early sixties. Dark hose were recommended for them. Many of the new minis were stretch-fit tight, and some were very short, with Ungaro&#x27;s so brief they were likened to 1950s bathing suits. The fashion industry&#x27;s miniskirt campaign was so intense that newspaper articles appeared on women considering plastic surgery on their knees to suit the new lengths.

However, though there was a rush on miniskirts for a time, the unanimity around mini lengths did not last long, as women continued to consider minis just one option among the many available during the decade and did not replace their entire wardrobes with them as they had in the sixties. This 1987-88 miniskirt push, though, would help cement the mini&#x27;s status as a basic item in the average woman&#x27;s wardrobe for many years to come.

From the 1980s, many women began to incorporate the miniskirt into their business attire, a trend which grew during the remainder of the century. The titular character of the 1990s television program &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, a lawyer portrayed by Calista Flockhart, has been credited with popularising micro-skirts.
The very short skirt is an element of Japanese school uniform, which since the 1990s has been exploited by young women who are part of the &quot;kogal&quot; (or &quot;gyaru&quot;) subculture as part of their look.

==== 2000s and 2010s ====
In the early 2000s, micro-minis were once again revived. In 2003, Tom Ford, at that time described as one of the few designers able to effortlessly dictate changes in fashion, stated that micro-skirts would be the height of fashion for Spring/Summer 2003. For fashionable wear, early 21st century microskirts were often worn with leggings or tights in order to avoid revealing too much.

A BBC article in 2014 wrote that miniskirts remained as contemporary a garment as ever, retaining their associations with youth. In an early 2010s study the department store Debenhams found that women continued buying miniskirts up to the age of 40, whilst 1983 studies showed that 33 years old was when the average woman had stopped buying them. Debenhams&#x27; report concluded that by the 2020s, miniskirts would be seen as a wardrobe staple for British women in their 40s and early 50s.

Despite this, in the early 21st century, miniskirts are still seen as controversial, and remain subject to bans and regulation. Valerie Steele told the BBC in 2014 that even though miniskirts no longer had the power to shock in most Western cultures, she would hesitate to wear one in most parts of the world. She described the garment as symbolic of looking forward to future freedom and backwards to a &quot;much more restricted past&quot; and noted that international rises in extreme conservatism and religious fundamentalism had led to an anti-women backlash, some of which was shown through censure and criticism of women wearing &quot;immodest&quot; clothing. In 2010, the mayor of Castellammare di Stabia in Italy ordered that police fine women for wearing &quot;very short&quot; miniskirts. In the 2000s, a ban on miniskirts at a teacher&#x27;s college in Kemerovo was claimed by lawyers to be against the terms of equality and human rights as laid out by the Russian constitution, whilst in Chile, the women&#x27;s minister, Carolina Schmidt, described a regional governor&#x27;s ban on public employees wearing minis and strapless tops as &quot;absolute nonsense&quot; and challenged their right to regulate other people&#x27;s clothing. In July 2010, Southampton city council also tried to regulate their female employees&#x27;s wardrobes, telling them to avoid miniskirts and dress &quot;appropriately.&quot;

Miniskirts regularly appear in Africa as part of controversies, something that has continued since the 1960s. In the early 21st century alone, instances have included a proposed ban on miniskirts in Uganda justified by claiming that they were a dangerous distraction to drivers and would cause road accidents, and in 2004, a leaflet campaign in Mombasa instructed women to dress modestly and &quot;shun miniskirts&quot;, leading to the Kenyan government denying that they wanted a ban. Since the 1990s, women perceived to be &quot;indecently dressed&quot; might be stripped in public often by gangs of men, but sometimes by other women. These acts took place in Kenya, Zambia and elsewhere, including incidents in Johannesburg in 2008 and 2011 which led to similar attacks in various states including Sudan, Malawi, Zimbabwe and elsewhere. The President of Malawi, Bingu wa Mutharika, was forced to make a statement in 2012 after male gangs forcibly stripped women in Lilongwe and Mzuzu. By this point, &quot;miniskirt protests&quot; regularly followed these acts of violence, with the protesters defiantly wearing miniskirts. In late February 2010, a group of about 200 Ugandan women demonstrated against a so-called &quot;miniskirt law&quot;, an anti-pornography legislation which specifically forbade women to dress &quot;in a manner designed to sexually excite&quot;, or from wearing clothing that revealed their thighs and/or other body parts. Uganda revisited their proposed ban in 2013, with Simon Lokodo, Minister of Ethics and Integrity, proposing another anti-pornography bill which would outlaw revealing &quot;intimate parts&quot;, defined as &quot;anything above the knee&quot;, and vowing that women who wore miniskirts would be arrested. While most of these proposed bans come from male politicians, in 2009, Joice Mujuru, Zimbabwe&#x27;s vice president, had to deal with rumours that she intended to ban miniskirts and trousers for women. In Africa, one of the main issues with the miniskirt since the 1960s is that it is seen as representative of protest against predominantly male authority, an accusation also applied to trousers for women which are perceived as blurring the gender divide.

==== 2020s ====
The resurgence of controversial early 2000s trends, including visible thong strings and low-rise jeans, has extended to miniskirts, now seen on both fashion runways and social media platforms like TikTok. The micro miniskirt trend has been associated with various fashion movements, from the mod style of the 1960s to the edgy looks of the 2000s. The skirts revival has evoked nostalgia for Y2K icons like Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, making it a piece for fashion enthusiasts seeking a contemporary edge with a nod to the past. With brands like Miu Miu and Miaou, the micro miniskirt has made its way back into one of the top fashion trends. The micro mini made its emergence during Paris fashion week across catwalks and street style. Fashion brands like Khaite and Etro are capitalizing on the micro mini skirt trend, driven by customers&#x27; nostalgia and desire for a return to sexier styles.

During Spring/Summer 22, Miu Miu debuted their utilitarian take on the micro trend. It&#x27;s a subversive and deconstructive take on the classic school girl pleated skirt. The skirt was immediately seen on Nicole Kidman, Paloma Elsesser, Zendaya, Lily Rose Depp, Bella Hadid, and many more, and went viral on TikTok and Instagram. The Miu Miu skirt set even has its own instagram account @miumiuset with 6K followers. With its low rise and extreme shortness, the miniskirt captures attention, reflecting Miuccia Prada&#x27;s dedication to bold and unconventional fashion statements. The skirt is priced between $950 and $1,150.

The Diesel belt skirt debuted in Diesel&#x27;s FW22 show in Milan, with leather belts transformed into micro-mini skirts. The belt is another take on the current micro mini skirt trend referencing Paris Hilton&#x27;s iconic quote &quot;skirts should be the size of a belt&quot;. Inspired by the chunky, low-waisted belts of the 1990s, Diesel&#x27;s creative director Glenn Martens envisioned a garment that exudes a nostalgic yet contemporary vibe. A TikTok review by content creator Adrienne Reau, garnering 5.2 million views, has sparked controversy over the skirt design. The Daily Mail labeled it &quot;&#x27;sloppy&#x27;,&quot; while Insider noted its impracticality, stating it&#x27;s impossible to sit in. Diet Prada added humor, questioning if wearers are &quot;ready to expose your buttcheeks to the breeze?&quot;

Critics express concerns over its impracticality due to its extremely short length, while its predominantly showcasing on slender models has prompted calls for more size-inclusive offerings. Miu Miu&#x27;s presentation of the skirt solely on slim young bodies further fueled these criticisms, although subsequent magazine covers featuring plus-sized model Paloma Elsesser and 54-year-old actress Nicole Kidman helped broaden its appeal to a wider audience. Model Jessica Blair highlighted in a TikTok video how clothing options for plus-size individuals were severely limited in the early 2000s, effectively excluding them from fashion. “Clothing options for plus-size people in the early 2000s were virtually non-existent, thereby completely excluding fat people from fashion,” Blair stated.
