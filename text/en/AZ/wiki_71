<text>The Abbey Theatre (), also known as the National Theatre of Ireland () is a theatre in Dublin, Ireland. First opening to the public on 27 December 1904, and moved from its original building after a fire in 1951, it has remained active to the present day. The Abbey was the first state-subsidized theatre in the English-speaking world; from 1925 onwards it received an annual subsidy from the Irish Free State. Since July 1966, the Abbey has been located at 26 Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1.

In its early years, the theatre was closely associated with the writers of the Irish Literary Revival, many of whom were involved in its founding and most of whom had plays staged there. The Abbey served as a nursery for many of leading Irish playwrights, including William Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory, Seán O&#x27;Casey and John Millington Synge, as well as leading actors. In addition, through its extensive programme of touring abroad and its high visibility to foreign, particularly American, audiences, it has become an important part of the Irish cultural brand.

==History==
===Origins===
The Abbey arose from three distinct bases. The first was the seminal Irish Literary Theatre. Founded by Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and W. B. Yeats in 1899—with assistance from George Moore—it presented plays in the Antient Concert Rooms and the Gaiety Theatre, which brought critical approval but limited public interest. Lady Gregory envisioned a society promoting &quot;ancient idealism&quot; dedicated to crafting works of Irish theatre pairing Irish culture with European theatrical methods.

The second base involved the work of two Dublin directors, William and Frank Fay. William worked in the 1890s with a touring company in Ireland, Scotland and Wales, while his brother Frank was involved in amateur dramatics in Dublin. After William returned to Dublin, the Fay brothers staged productions in halls around the city and eventually formed W. G. Fay&#x27;s Irish National Dramatic Company, focused on the development of Irish acting talent. In April 1902, the Fays gave three performances of Æ&#x27;s play &quot;Deirdre&quot; and Yeats&#x27; &quot;Cathleen Ní Houlihan&quot; in St Theresa&#x27;s Hall on Clarendon Street. The performances played to a mainly working-class audience rather than the usual middle-class Dublin theatregoers. The run was a great success, thanks in part to the beauty and force of Maud Gonne, who played the lead in Yeats&#x27; play. The company continued at the Antient Concert Rooms, producing works by Seumas O&#x27;Cuisin, Fred Ryan and Yeats.

The third base was the financial support and experience of Annie Horniman, a middle-class Englishwoman with previous experience in theatre production, having been involved in the presentation of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; in London in 1894. An acquaintance of Yeats from London circles, including the Order of the Golden Dawn, she came to Dublin in 1903 to act as Yeats&#x27; unpaid secretary and to make costumes for a production of his play &quot;The King&#x27;s Threshold&quot;. Her money helped found the Abbey Theatre and, according to the critic Adrian Frazier, would &quot;make the rich feel at home, and the poor—on a first visit—out of place.&quot;

The founding of the Theatre is also connected with a broader wave of change found in European drama at the end of the nineteenth century. The founding of Théâtre Libre in Paris in 1887 and the work of the Moscow Art Theatre in 1895 represented a challenge to a &quot;stale metropolitanism&quot;. This movement echoes Lady Gregory&#x27;s commitment and determination to make the Abbey Theatre a theatre for the people.

===Foundation===

Encouraged by the St Theresa&#x27;s Hall success, Yeats, Lady Gregory, Æ, Martyn, and John Millington Synge founded the Irish National Theatre Society in 1903 with funding from Horniman. They were joined by actors and playwrights from Fay&#x27;s company. At first, they staged performances in the Molesworth Hall. When the Mechanics&#x27; Theatre in Lower Abbey Street and an adjacent building in Marlborough Street became available after fire safety authorities closed it, Horniman and William Fay agreed to buy and refit the space to meet the society&#x27;s needs.

On 11 May 1904, the Society formally accepted Horniman&#x27;s offer of the use of the building. As Horniman did not usually reside in Ireland, the royal letters patent required were granted in the name of Lady Gregory, although paid for by Horniman. The founders appointed William Fay theatre manager, responsible for training the actors in the newly established repertory company. They commissioned Yeats&#x27; brother Jack to paint portraits of all the leading figures in the society for the foyer, and hired Sarah Purser to design stained glass for the same space.

On 27 December, the curtains went up on opening night. The bill consisted of three one-act plays, &quot;On Baile&#x27;s Strand&quot; and &quot;Cathleen Ní Houlihan&quot; by Yeats, and &quot;Spreading the News&quot; by Lady Gregory. On the second night, &quot;In the Shadow of the Glen&quot; by Synge replaced the second Yeats play. These two bills alternated over a five-night run. Frank Fay, playing Cúchulainn in &quot;On Baile&#x27;s Strand&quot;, was the first actor on the Abbey stage. Although Horniman had designed the costumes, neither she nor Lady Gregory was present, as Horniman had already returned to England. In addition to providing funding, her chief role with the Abbey over the coming years was to organise publicity and bookings for their touring productions in London and provincial England.

In 1905 without properly consulting Horniman, Yeats, Lady Gregory and Synge decided to turn the theatre into a limited liability company, the National Theatre Society Ltd. Annoyed by this treatment, Horniman hired Ben Iden Payne, a former Abbey employee, to help run a new repertory company which she founded in Manchester. Leading actors Máire Nic Shiubhlaigh, Honor Lavelle (Helen Laird), Emma Vernon, Máire Garvey, Frank Walker, Seamus O&#x27;Sullivan, Pádraic Colum and George Roberts left the Abbey.

The press was impressed with the building and the &quot;Cork Constitution&quot; wrote that &quot;the theatre has neither orchestra nor bar, and the principal entrance is through a building which was formerly the Dublin morgue.&quot; Theatregoers were surprised and thought it to be scandalous that part of the theatre used to be a morgue. The orchestra was established under the guidance of John F Larchet.

==== Contributions of founders and funders ====

===== Lady Gregory =====
Gregory helped create the Irish Literary Theatre, which would later form one base for the INTS, with W.B. Yeats and Edward Martyn. She met Yeats in 1898, and he admitted to her that it was a dream of his to create a theatre in which new ambitious Irish plays could be performed. The idea seemed more and more possible to achieve as they kept talking and by the end of their first meeting they had a plan for how to make a &quot;national theatre&quot; a reality. In the first year of the theatre, Lady Gregory was in charge of finding money and support from patrons, and she even donated some of her own money. She was critical in making the ILT and the INTS function financially before Annie Horniman&#x27;s support.

In 1903, when Horniman offered the INTS a theatre, Lady Gregory schemed to bypass the terms of the deal. She didn&#x27;t like Horniman and was happy when she left, saying she was &quot;free from her and from further foreign invasion.&quot; She wrote many plays for the theatre, specializing in the one-act play.

===== William Butler Yeats =====
The Abbey Theatre is sometimes called Yeats&#x27; theatre or a manifestation of his own artistic ambitions and ideals. He wanted a theatre in which the playwright&#x27;s words were the most important thing, prevailing over the actor and the audience. It was very important to him that the authors had control. It was because of him and his efforts that Lady Gregory, Synge and he became the Board of Directors of the INTS. It was only after meeting Lady Gregory that Yeats thought the creation of such a theatre possible. He worked closely with her for almost a year before the first production of the ILT, during which his play &quot;Cathleen Ni Houlihan&quot; and Edward Martyn&#x27;s &quot;The Heather Field&quot; were performed to great success, some even calling it &quot;the cultural event of the decade,&quot; though some accused him of being too political or even of writing a heretical play.

He then adopted a new, more inclusive politic, which helped him and Lady Gregory recruit many new patrons, most Protestant and/or Unionist. As early as 1900, Yeats sent a letter to Lady Gregory that implied that he was confident about finding a reliable patron who, at the time, remained anonymous. The patron he was talking about was Annie Horniman, who had anonymously financed Yeats&#x27; first play in 1884. By that point, he was starting to want The Abbey to be seen as nationalist. However, by October 1901, he had lost interest in the ILT as a mean to express his artistic vision, as he was forced to make sacrifices to accommodate co-workers. He chose to stay because of his relationship with Horniman, who he saw as a means to secure his ambitions and those of the Fay Brothers&#x27; troupe of Irish actors.

His relationship with Horniman was essential to his projects, so much so that he declared in front of an audience that he would not accept money from Nationalists and Unionists, which forced him to change the entire politics of the INTS. He gave this speech in 1903 and by 1904 he was the president of the Abbey Theatre. When Horniman left, he wanted to bring back the nationalist aspect the theatre once had but was stopped by a threat from Horniman to close it down; he finally had the last word with the help of Bernard Shaw and Lady Gregory. During the summer of 1909, Shaw offered his play &quot;Blanco Posnet&quot; to the Abbey, a play previously censored that allowed him to challenge British authority and to come back to the good graces of Nationalists, thus giving him a new reputation and making the INTS closer to becoming &quot;a representative Irish Institution.&quot; Following Horniman&#x27;s offer to sell him back the theatre, he then tried to &quot;play&quot; her so that she would pay more. Yeats, with the help of Lady Gregory, bought the Abbey back and sued Horniman for the subsidy he believed that she owed but won only on the principle, and did not receive the money.

===== Miss Annie Horniman =====
Annie Horniman, a British theatre enthusiast and manager, was essential in the creation of the Abbey Theatre, as she was its first significant patron and the woman who offered the edifice in which it would later be established. She was first brought in by Yeats as a costume designer for his play &quot;The King&#x27;s Threshold&quot;, as she greatly loved his art and it was also a way for him to get closer to her. Yeats&#x27;s long relationship with her and her love for theatre made her more likely to accept to become a permanent patron and, by 1901, her money was secured. Her support was so important that he already had a role for her in the Abbey Theatre before it was even created. However, by the time the ITL became the INTS, Yeats had to assure her that her money would not be used to fund a Nationalist rebellion.

She supported him as well as the INTS with financial support as she came from a rich family and, in 1903, after Yeats eloquently declared his apolitical theatrical ideals, she offered to give him a theatre in Dublin worth thirteen thousand pounds, but for the deal to work, she had strict conditions. Firstly, she requested that his speech, essays on the &quot;Irish National Theatre,&quot; and her offer be made public. Secondly, the point she stressed most, there were to be no politics at all. She finally gave the building for the Abbey Theatre in 1904, but remained the owner. Yeats accepted her terms but Gregory and Synge worked on finding ways to finesse their way around them before officially accepting. She didn&#x27;t want to have anything to do with Irish politics, especially not nationalism, and was very reactive to anything she saw as political, which caused several inflammatory feuds with her colleagues. She also did not care for the accessibility of theatre, which was an important issue for the founders, and she created additional rules for ticket pricing, and made the Abbey Theatre one of the most expensive theatres in Dublin. From then, she became the manager of the Abbey Theatre. Over the years, she put many times the theatre&#x27;s value in money back into it in exchange for input on the plays being staged and respect from the company&#x27;s directors.

She remained involved for a few strenuous years and left in 1907, angrily realizing she couldn&#x27;t achieve self-expression at the Abbey, but stayed financially involved until 1910. From 1907 to 1909, she turned on the INTS, essentially threatening to close if anything she deemed political was performed, even if the interpretation was debatable. After the riots following Synge&#x27;s &quot;Playboy of the Western World&quot;, she fully expressed her hatred for Irish nationalism and patriotism and threatened the Abbey once again, but when &quot;Blanco Posnet&quot; was presented and the Nationalists were appeased, she made a deal with Yeats and Lady Gregory to sell them the Theatre. The negotiations dragged on and in 1910, when the Abbey stayed open on the day King Edward VII died, Horniman had a final dispute in court with Yeats before leaving the Abbey Theatre for good.

===Early years===
In the early years, there were challenges in finding plays by Irish playwrights, so the founders established guidelines for playwrights submitting plays and wrote some plays themselves. The emergence of the theatre, the challenge of finding plays by Irish playwrights, the protests surrounding &quot;Playboy of the Western World&quot;, and the work of the Irish Theatre were key developments during this time. As one of the first directors of the new Abbey Theatre, Lady Gregory exchanged correspondence with her counterparts W.B Yeats and JM Synge which chronicled the further development of the new Abbey Theatre including themes such as the critical reception of plays, the challenge of balancing state funding and artistic liberty, and the contributions of actors and others supporting the theatre. The theatre staged many plays by authors, including Padraic Colum, George Bernard Shaw, Oliver St John Gogarty, F. R. Higgins, Thomas MacDonagh, Lord Dunsany, T. C. Murray, James Cousins and Lennox Robinson.

The Abbey&#x27;s fortunes worsened in January 1907 when the opening of Synge&#x27;s &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot; resulted in civil disturbance. The troubles (since known as the &quot;Playboy Riots&quot;) were encouraged, in part, by nationalists who believed the theatre was insufficiently political and who took offence at Synge&#x27;s use of the word &#x27;shift&#x27;, as it was known at the time as a symbol representing Kitty O&#x27;Shea and adultery, and hence was seen as a slight on the virtue of Irish womanhood. Much of the crowd rioted loudly, and the actors performed the remainder of the play in dumbshow. The theatre&#x27;s decision to call in the police further roused the anger of the nationalists. Although press opinion soon turned against the rioters and the protests faded, the management of the Abbey was shaken. They chose not to stage Synge&#x27;s next—and last completed—play, &quot;The Tinker&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1908), for fear of further disturbances. That same year, the Fay brothers&#x27; association with the theatre ended when they emigrated to the United States due to a clash with Yeats&#x27;s outlook; Lennox Robinson took over the Abbey&#x27;s day-to-day management after Horniman withdrew financial support.

In 1909, Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet&quot; led to further protests. The subsequent discussion occupied a full issue of the theatre&#x27;s journal &quot;The Arrow.&quot; Also that year, the proprietors decided to make the Abbey independent of Annie Horniman, who had indicated a preference for this course. Relations with Horniman had been tense, partly because she wished to be involved in choosing which plays were to be performed and when. As a mark of respect for the death of King Edward VII, an understanding existed that Dublin theatres were to close on the night of 7 May 1910. Robinson, however, kept the Abbey open. When Horniman heard of Robinson&#x27;s decision, she severed her connections with the company. By her own estimate, she had invested £10,350—worth approximately $1 million in 2007 US dollars—on the project.

With the loss of Horniman, Synge, and the Fays, the Abbey under Robinson tended to drift, suffering from falling public interest and box office returns. This trend was halted for a time by the emergence of Seán O&#x27;Casey as an heir to Synge. O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s career as a dramatist began with &quot;The Shadow of a Gunman&quot;, staged by the Abbey in 1923. This was followed by &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot; in 1924, and &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot; in 1926. Theatregoers arose in riots over the last play, in a way reminiscent of those that had greeted the &quot;Playboy&quot; 19 years earlier. Concerned about public reaction, the Abbey rejected O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s next play. He emigrated to London shortly thereafter.

World War I and the Irish Rebellion of 1916 almost ended the theatre; however, in 1924, Yeats and Lady Gregory offered the Abbey to the government of the Free State as a gift to the Irish people. Although the government refused, the following year Minister of Finance Ernest Blythe arranged an annual government subsidy of £850 for the Abbey. This made the company the first state-supported theatre in the English-speaking world. The subsidy allowed the theatre to avoid bankruptcy, but the amount was too small to rescue it from financial difficulty.

====Affiliated schools====
The Abbey School of Acting was set up in 1911. The Abbey School of Ballet was established in 1927 by Ninette de Valois — who had provided choreography for a number of Yeats&#x27; plays – and ran until 1933.

====The Peacock and the Gate====

Around this time the company acquired additional space, allowing them to create a small experimental theatre, the &quot;Peacock&quot;, on the ground floor of the main theatre. In 1928, Hilton Edwards, Micheál MacLiammoir, cabaret impresario Daisy Bannard Cogley and Gearóid Ó Lochlainn launched the Gate Theatre Studio, leasing the Peacock from 14 October and using the venue to stage works by European and American dramatists.

The Gate also sought work from new Irish playwrights and moved to its own premises in 1930. Despite the Peacock space, the Abbey itself entered a period of artistic decline. This is illustrated by the story of how one new work was said to have come to the Gate Theatre. Denis Johnston reportedly submitted his first play, &quot;Shadowdance&quot;, to the Abbey; however, Lady Gregory rejected it, returning it to the author with &quot;The Old Lady says No&quot; written across the title page. Johnston decided to re-title the play. The Gate staged &quot;The Old Lady Says &#x27;No&#x27; &quot; in &quot;The Peacock&quot; in 1928. (Note: academic critics Joseph Ronsley and Christine St. Peter have questioned the veracity of this story.)

==1930s to 1950s==
The tradition of the Abbey as primarily a writers&#x27; theatre survived Yeats&#x27; withdrawal from day-to-day involvement. Frank O&#x27;Connor sat on the board from 1935 to 1939, served as managing director from 1937, and had two plays staged during this period. He was alienated from and unable to cope with many of the other board members. They held O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s past adultery against him. Although he fought formidably to retain his position, soon after Yeats died the board began machinations to remove O&#x27;Connor. In 1941 Ernest Blythe, a politician, who had arranged the first State subsidy for the theatre, became managing director.

During the 1940s and 1950s, there was a steady decline in the number of new productions. There were 104 new plays produced from 1930 to 1940, whereas this number dropped to 62 for 1940–1950. Thereafter, there was another decrease. However, the theatre was undeterred by the dwindling amount of productions of original plays and had their audience numbers increase. The attitude of the general public had vastly changed towards the Abbey since the beginning of the century. It was no longer reserved as a theatre for the rich and for a small clique of intellectuals, it had become a theatre for the people. The plays of O&#x27;Casey and Lennox Robinson that were being produced by theatre at the time most likely aided in this shift. Larger audiences also brought a change in the Abbey&#x27;s repertory policy. Rather than the theatre&#x27;s old system of limiting the initial run of a new play to a week, no matter how popular the play became, the Abbey ran their new plays until their audience was exhausted. This change in policy which was brought about partly because of the shortage of new plays was to have serious consequences in future years when the Abbey found its stock of popular revivals exhausted.

During the 1940s and 1950s, the staple fare at the Abbey was a comic farce set in the idealised peasant world of Éamon de Valera. If such a world had ever existed, it was no longer considered relevant by most Irish citizens, and as a result, audience numbers continued to decline. This drift might have been more dramatic but popular actors, including F. J. McCormick, and dramatists, including George Shiels, could still draw a crowd. Austin Clarke staged events for his Dublin Verse Speaking Society—later the Lyric Theatre—at the Peacock from 1941 to 1944 and the Abbey from 1944 to 1951. Long-time servant Nellie Bushell left service as an usher in 1948.

==1950s to 1990s==
On 17 July 1951, a fire damaged the Abbey Theatre, with only the Peacock remaining intact. It is often recounted that the building was destroyed in the fire, but Frank MacDonald contends this is an overstatement, citing the continued use of the building by the Irish Academy of Letters until its eventual demolition in 1960. The company leased the old Queen&#x27;s Theatre in September and continued in residence there until 1966.

The board had plans for rebuilding with a design by the Irish architect Michael Scott which dated back to 1959. The magazine, the &quot;Irish Builder,&quot; argued that it was favourable to refurbish the old building rather than build a new one, as &quot;we feel the tourists who come here would prefer to see the old Abbey of Yeats and Synge, rather than the Abbey of Scott.&quot; On 3 September 1963, the President of Ireland, Éamon de Valera, laid the foundation stone for the new theatre, and the Abbey reopened on 18 July 1966. The cost of the new building was £725,000, an overspend on the original estimated £235,000, and resulted in the Dáil Committee for Public Accounts calling for an investigation into the overrun.

A new building, a new generation of dramatists, including such figures as Hugh Leonard, Brian Friel and Tom Murphy, and tourism that included the National Theatre as a key cultural attraction, helped revive the theatre. Beginning in 1957, the theatre&#x27;s participation in the Dublin Theatre Festival aided its revival. Plays such as Brian Friel&#x27;s &quot;Philadelphia Here I Come!&quot; (1964), &quot;Faith Healer&quot; (1979) and &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot; (1990); Tom Murphy&#x27;s &quot;A Whistle in the Dark&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Gigli Concert&quot; (1983); and Hugh Leonard&#x27;s &quot;Da&quot; (1973) and &quot;A Life&quot; (1980), helped raise the Abbey&#x27;s international profile through successful runs in the West End in London, and on Broadway in New York City.

Irish American writer and W.B Yeats scholar James W. Flannery (born 1936) wrote two books about the Abbey Theatre: &quot;W. B. Yeats and the Idea of a Theatre: The Early Abbey Theatre in Theory and in Practice&quot; (1976) and &quot;Miss Horniman and the Abbey Theatre&quot; (1970). Flannery was the Executive Director of the Yeats International Theatre Festival held at the Abbey Theatre from 1989 to 1993.

==Challenges in the 2000s==
In December 2004 the theatre celebrated its centenary with events that included performances of the original programme by amateur dramatic groups and a production of Michael West&#x27;s &quot;Dublin By Lamplight&quot;, originally staged by Annie Ryan for The Corn Exchange company at the Project Arts Centre in November 2004. Despite the centenary, not all was well: audience numbers were falling, the Peacock was closed for lack of money, the theatre was near bankruptcy, and the staff felt the threat of huge lay-offs.

In September 2004 two members of the theatre&#x27;s advisory council, playwrights Jimmy Murphy and Ulick O&#x27;Connor, tabled a &quot;motion of no confidence&quot; in Artistic Director Ben Barnes, and criticised him for touring with a play in Australia during the deep financial and artistic crisis at home. Barnes returned and temporarily held his position. The debacle put the Abbey under great public scrutiny. On 12 May 2005, Barnes and managing director Brian Jackson resigned after it was found that the theatre&#x27;s deficit of €1.85 million had been underestimated. The new director, Fiach Mac Conghail, due to start in January 2006, took over in May 2005.

==Reestablishment==
On 20 August 2005, the Abbey Theatre&#x27;s Advisory Council approved a plan to dissolve the Abbey&#x27;s owner, the National Theatre Society, and replace it with a company limited by guarantee, the Abbey Theatre Limited. After strong debate, the board accepted the program. Basing its actions on this plan, the Arts Council of Ireland awarded the Abbey €25.7 million in January 2006 to be spread over three years. The grant represented an approximate 43  per cent increase in the Abbey&#x27;s revenues and was the largest ever awarded by the Arts Council. The new company was established on 1 February 2006, with the announcement of a new Abbey Board chaired by High Court Judge Bryan McMahon. In March 2007 the larger auditorium in the theatre was radically reconfigured by Jean-Guy Lecat as part of a major upgrade of the theatre.

In 2009, the Literary Department announced the pilot of a new development initiative, the &quot;New Playwrights Programme&quot;. The six writers who took part in this pilot programme were Aidan Harney, Lisa Keogh, Shona McCarthy, Jody O&#x27;Neill, Neil Sharpson and Lisa Tierney-Keogh.

More than 30 writers were commissioned by the Abbey after Mac Conghail was appointed director in May 2005, and the Abbey produced new plays by Tom Murphy, Richard Dormer, Gary Duggan, Billy Roche, Bernard Farrell and Owen McCafferty. The Abbey also developed a relationship with the Public Theater in New York, where it has presented two new plays: &quot;Terminus&quot; by Mark O&#x27;Rowe and Sam Shepard&#x27;s &quot;Kicking a Dead Horse&quot;. The Abbey also made a historic move in 2009/10 by producing four consecutive new plays by women writers: &quot;B for Baby&quot; by Carmel Winter, &quot;No Romance&quot; by Nancy Harris, &quot;Perve&quot; by Stacey Gregg and &quot;16 Possible Glimpses&quot; by Marina Carr.

The Abbey ran a special programme, &quot;Waking the Nation&quot;, to commemorate the Easter Rising of 1916. Some controversy arose over the fact that of ten productions, only one, a monologue for children, was by a female playwright.

==Co-directors and new building plans==
In 2016, the Abbey&#x27;s direction passed to two co-directors on five-year contracts. Neil Murray from Wales and Graham McLaren from Scotland pursued policies involving significant touring, a wider selection of plays including shorter runs, reduced reliance on Abbey stalwarts such as &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot; (57 productions in the theatre&#x27;s history), free previews, and an emphasis on diversity. They also pursued the project to renew the theatre building, with McLaren describing the current structure as &quot;the worst theatre building I have ever worked in ... Stalinesque ... a terrible, terrible design&quot;.

After discussions about new locations in the Docklands, on O&#x27;Connell Street and elsewhere, it was decided to redevelop the Abbey in situ. Hence, in September 2012, the Abbey Theatre purchased 15-17 Eden Quay, and in 2016, 22-23 Eden Quay. With a budget of up to 80 million euros mentioned, including capital funding from the central government, the plan is to remove the existing building and build on the combined site, creating two new theatre spaces, of 700 and 250 seats, along with a restaurant, modern rehearsal spaces, and new offices. The new theatre would open onto the Liffey quays. As of March 2023, the plans for the redevelopment had not yet been finalised and an application for planning permission had not yet been submitted.

In February 2021, after open competition, two new co-directors were appointed, Caitriona McLaughlin as Artistic Director and Mark O&#x27;Brien as Executive Director.

<doc id="207972" wikidata="Q4748865" url="?curid=207972" title="Amstrad Action">
<text>Amstrad Action was a monthly magazine, published in the United Kingdom, which catered to owners of home computers from the Amstrad CPC range and later the GX4000 console.

It was the first magazine published by Chris Anderson&#x27;s Future Publishing, which with a varied line-up of computing and non-computing related titles has since become one of the foremost magazine publishers in the UK.

The publication, often abbreviated to &quot;AA&quot; by staff and readers, had the longest lifetime of any Amstrad magazine, running for 117 issues from October 1985 until June 1995 - long after the CPC had ceased production and games were no longer available.

==History==
Published by Future plc, a company set up by Chris Anderson (ex-&quot;Personal Computer Games&quot; and &quot;Zzap!64&quot; editor). Launch Editor, Peter Connor, also an ex-&quot;PCG&quot; staff member, shared the writing duties with the only other staff writer, Bob Wade. Bob, another ex-&quot;PCG&quot;/&quot;Zzap!64&quot; staff member, was given the title ‘Software Editor’ and would review the vast majority of the games featured, with Peter given a second opinion. Trevor Gilham, Art Editor, would complete the four man team.

Issue 1 dated October 1985 was released in September 1985 with the cover price of £1; 1p for every one of the 100 pages. It took the new publication a few issues to find its readers, but with the help of a bumper 116 page Christmas 1985 issue with a cover mounted tape, the circulation figures grew rapidly. In October 1986 &quot;Amstrad Action&quot; split into three separate publications. &quot;AA&quot; still catered for the CPC range, while &quot;8000 Plus&quot; and &quot;PC Plus&quot; focused on the Amstrad PCW and PC range respectively.

&quot;AA&quot; eventually gave in to reader&#x27;s pleas to have a permanent cover tape. An announcement was made, in AA66, that the following issue would not only include a cover tape, but contain more colour and be printed on different paper. Review pages were also slightly re-designed.

In April 1992 the Audit Bureau of Circulation figures showed an increase to 37,120, the highest circulation since July–December 1988&#x27;s 38,457.

AA100 looked at the top 100 products for the CPC and took a trip down memory lane, looking back at past editors and staff. As circulation figures wound down further still there was a drastic drop in page numbers from 60 to 36 in July 1994&#x27;s AA106. More compact issues mean no superfluous columns or features. AA107 became the first issue with only one member of official staff.

In AA111 there was no credits list, but the new editor, Karen Levell, answered the Reaction letters and confirmed her appointment. Although everything appeared as normal in June 1995&#x27;s AA117, with AA118 advertised in the next month box, this was the last &quot;AA&quot; ever. The final headline (on issue AA117) was &quot;Publish and be Damned&quot;. 

==Features and editorial style==
&quot;AA&quot; covered both &#x27;games&#x27; and &#x27;serious&#x27; side of the CPC, maintaining a 50/50 coverage throughout its run. The editorial coverage was always seen as being one of the three main areas; games/leisure, serious (programming, business software etc.), and the regulars, such as &#x27;Amscene&#x27;, &#x27;Forum&#x27;, &#x27;Action Test&#x27;, and &#x27;Cheat Mode&#x27;.

; Amscene
The latest CPC news regarding all things in the Amstrad world. Later included the games charts and games preview pages.
; Reaction
The readers letters were answered in the &quot;Reaction&quot; section, where numerous arguments and, usually good natured, humour was found. Later during &quot;AA&quot;s run the standout letter of the month was highlighted and given the star prize award of £25. The technical problems page &#x27;Problem Attic&#x27; started out in the Reaction pages in the early years before getting its own space. &quot;If your CPC’s in danger, if you need help, then you can contact the AA team.&quot;
; Action Test
The review approach included a main write up, a second opinion box, a good news / bad news comparison list and the percentages. Percentages were given to Graphics, Sonics, Grab Factor, Staying Power and an overall AA Rating. High rated games of 80% and above were given an &#x27;AA Rave&#x27; accolade, while the highest rated game of the month received the &#x27;Mastergame&#x27; award. This review style continued well into the early 1990s when the award accolades were scrapped. As budget games became more prominent during the CPC&#x27;s life &quot;AA&quot; covered this growing market by including budget reviews in the &#x27;Budget Bonanza&#x27; and later &#x27;Action Replay&#x27; sections.
; The Pilgrim
Interactive fiction was covered by &quot;The Pilgrim&quot;, then &quot;Balrog&quot; and &quot;The Examiner&quot;. The Pilgrim format included the latest adventure game reviews. &#x27;Clue Sniffing With The Pilgrim&#x27; included adventure clues and tips. &#x27;Pilgrim Post&#x27; was the letters column for adventure game topics. &#x27;Adventure News&#x27; detailed the latest happenings in the world of adventure games.
; Forum
The Forum carried on from the Problem Attic column where the resident Technical Editor answered reader&#x27;s hardware or software problems and queries. As space in the magazine became restrictive other features like &#x27;Helpline&#x27; and &#x27;Ask Alex&#x27; were merged into the new &#x27;Techy Forum&#x27;.
; Type-In
One long running feature of &quot;AA&quot; was the Type-In section. This included utility, games and demo type-ins sent in by the readers. One had to type in the program code into the computer then run it. The core of this split the readership over whether the programs should be put on the covertape instead - over a six-month period this is what happened, until this practice (and ultimately the Type-Ins section) was abandoned due to space restrictions.
; Helpline
The Helpline page was where eager Amstrad readers would offer contact details help fellow readers having problems. It was later merged with Technical Forum.
; Cheat Mode
The tips pages included game pokes, tips, cheats and maps all contributed by the readers.
; Aafterthought
Initially called Rear View, the back page was where all the loose ends were closed off, like competition winner results and last minute happenings.
; Features
As activity in the Amstrad world declined, the editorial staff, and subsequently the editorial content, was constantly being reduced and the magazine adopted an increasingly eccentric style, with one edition in particular featuring an eight-page script for a Christmas pantomime. Later on, a double spread review for the 2nd &quot;Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles&quot; game was split between the review itself and a bizarre transcribed interview between Rod Lawton and Adam Peters (pretending to be one of the turtles). Peters would usually try and promote his band in some way (he featured on the cover of &#x27;music orientated&#x27; issue and had one of his techno-MIDI band&#x27;s songs on the covertape). The magazine is also notable for pioneering the kind of responses – sometimes dry, sometimes surreal, usually humorous and mildly rude – to readers&#x27; letters of a form now seen throughout UK gaming magazine culture. These characteristics, for many readers, added to &quot;AA&quot;&#x27;s charm.

===Cover Tapes===
Chris Anderson using his previous success of covermounted cassette tapes with &quot;Personal Computer Games&quot; included one with the Christmas special issue of 1985. This included two unreleased games from Ocean Software; &quot;Kung Fu&quot; and &quot;Number 1&quot;. The covermount cassette tape was only an occurrence on the Christmas and &quot;AA&quot; birthday issues, not becoming a regular feature until AA67 in 1991, mainly due to requests from many readers. Cover-cassettes featured game demos, applications, software utilities and, in some instances, complete games. Due to the low quality of the cassettes used many Amstrad owners found them to be unreliable, something which was commonly reflected in the letters pages. One solution to fixing the unreliable tapes as posted to the letters section was to unwind the tape and put a warm iron on it. Later, a utility was released on the covertape to convert the contents to the proprietary 3&quot; disk.

; &quot;Dizzy&quot;, &quot;AA&quot; Special Edition
&quot;Codemasters&quot; produced a &quot;Dizzy&quot; game specially for the &quot;AA&quot; birthday covertape in October 1988. This &#x27;Special Edition&#x27; included different rooms and objects to explore.
; Action Pack #1
AA67, dated April 1990, came with the first of the permanent cover tapes called Action Pack #1, along with a new cover price of £2.20. A playable demo of Ocean Software&#x27;s &quot;Total Recall&quot; and complete games &quot;Hydrofool&quot; and Codemasters&#x27; &quot;Dizzy&quot; were included on the tape.
; Action Pack #2
This tape caused some controversy among the readers as one of the featured games &quot;How To Be A Complete Bastard&quot; featured mild swearing, plus the game&#x27;s quest was to be violent and obnoxious throughout a house party.
; &quot;Stormlord&quot; Censored
December 1993 AA99&#x27;s Serious Action cover tape included the complete &quot;Stormlord&quot; game, albeit a censored version. With the self-censoring of the Hewson game it seemed that &quot;AA&quot; was trying to avoid similar controversy that followed AA68&#x27;s Action Pack #2.
; Best Game Ever On Covertape
Voted the best game on the CPC, Firebird&#x27;s &quot;Elite&quot; was the complete game given away with the 100th issue&#x27;s Serious Action cover tape.

===AA Games Accolades===
Initially only the best rated game of the month earned an &quot;AA Mastergame&quot; accolade, but from issue 57 this was changed to all games that received a 90% or higher rating. Games receiving 80–90% were awarded an &quot;AA Rave&quot;. Publishers of CPC games such as Activision, Ocean and Infogrames proudly mounted these awards on their packaging to promote their games to potential customers. The first game to receive a &#x27;Mastergame&#x27; award was Melbourne House&#x27;s &quot;The Way of the Exploding Fist&quot;, gaining an impressive 94% AA Rating. Issue 38 was the first issue not to award any game the Mastergame accolade. Apparently there were no games worthy of the award that month. The lowest rated Mastergame was &quot;Target Renegade&quot;, from Imagine Software, receiving an 86% overall rating. Quite why it was awarded a Mastergame was not explained and remains a mystery.

&quot;Laser Squad&quot;, by Blade Software, which was mentioned many times as being an &quot;AA&quot; staff favourite, was awarded the Mastergame accolade, in AA49, with a 91% rating. March 1990 and the mysterious lost Mastergame that would be &quot;Chase HQ&quot;. The Ocean arcade game conversion received a score of 90%, coupled with being the highest rated game this issue. This would normally justify the Mastergame accolade, however the game only got an AA Rave accolade and no explanation or corrections were made since. June 1990 was the first issue to award the Mastergame accolade to more than one game; &quot;E-Motion&quot; by US Gold and &quot;Turrican&quot; by Rainbow Arts received ratings of 92% and 90% respectively. November 1990 and &quot;Rick Dangerous 2&quot; received the highest rating so far. The MicroStyle game gained a MasterGame award and an AA Rating of 97%.

Psygnosis&#x27; &quot;Lemmings&quot; and Ocean&#x27;s &quot;The Addams Family&quot; were the last games to receive a Mastergame accolade in July 1992&#x27;s AA82; receiving 97% and 90% respectively. Following issues dispensed with AA Rave and Mastergame accolades. &quot;Lemmings&quot; joins &quot;Rick Dangerous 2&quot; as gaining the highest &quot;AA&quot; rating given during its publication. March 1993&#x27;s issue 90 featured the first highest rated game not to receive an AA accolade. &quot;Nigel Mansell&quot;’s World Championship received an overall rating of 93%, but no accolade of either Rave or Mastergame. The long standing AA signature accolade had been discarded.

There were many freelance writers, with many producing a regular, monthly column.

Steve Williams), Tim Blackbond and Keith Wood; fanzine columnist David Crookes; and reviewers Richard Wildey and Angela Cook. David Crookes continues to write about the Amstrad as a freelance writer for &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; magazine.

One of the most memorable, however, was technical writer and covertape editor Richard Fairhurst, a.k.a. CRTC. The latter name matched the initialism of the CPC&#x27;s Cathode Ray Tube Controller and was sometimes expanded to ChaRleyTroniC. He ran a public domain library called Robot PD and was also an accomplished computer programmer, producing the fully-fledged utilities PowerPage and RoutePlanner for the CPC as well as contributing to various demos. In the CPC fan community, he wrote articles about demos for &quot;CPC Attack&quot;, was editor of the Amstrad-centred disczine &quot;Better Than Life&quot;, and was the final editor of the more professional-centric fanzine &quot;WACCI&quot;.

<text>Daniel Abse CBE FRSL (22 September 1923 – 28 September 2014) was a Welsh poet and physician. His poetry won him many awards. As a medic, he worked in a chest clinic for over 30 years.

==Early years==
Abse was born in Cardiff, Wales, as the younger brother of the politician and reformer Leo Abse and the eminent psychoanalyst Wilfred Abse. Unusually for a middle-class Jewish boy, Dannie Abse attended St Illtyd&#x27;s College, a working-class Catholic school in Splott. Abse studied medicine, first at the University of Wales College of Medicine and then at Westminster Hospital Medical School and King&#x27;s College London.

Abse was a passionate supporter of Cardiff City football club. He first went to watch them play in 1934 and many of his writings refer to his experiences watching and lifelong love of the team known as &quot;The Bluebirds&quot;.

==Career as poet==

Abse worked in the medical field, and was a physician in a chest clinic for over thirty years, but he is best known as a poet. He received numerous literary awards and fellowships for his writing. In 1989, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Wales.

His first volume of poetry, &quot;After Every Green Thing&quot;, was published in 1949. His autobiographic work, &quot;Ash on a Young Man&#x27;s Sleeve&quot;, was published in 1954. He won the Welsh Arts Council Award in both 1971 and 1987, and the Cholmondeley Award in 1985. He was a Fellow of The Royal Society of Literature from 1983. In a foreword to &quot;Collected Poems 1948–1976&quot;, Abse noted that his poems are increasingly &quot;rooted in actual experience,&quot; both domestic and professional, and many display a reconciliation between Jewish and Welsh themes and traditions.

Abse lived for several decades in the north-west area of London, mainly near Hampstead, where he had considerable ties. For several years he wrote a column for the local &quot;Hampstead and Highgate Express&quot;. These articles subsequently appeared in book form.

In 2005, his wife Joan was killed in a car accident, while Abse suffered a broken rib. His poetry collection, &quot;Running Late&quot;, was published in 2006, and &quot;The Presence&quot;, a memoir of the year after his wife died, was published in 2007; it won the 2008 Wales Book of the Year award. The book was later dramatised for BBC Radio 4. He was awarded the Roland Mathias prize for &quot;Running Late&quot;.

In 2009, Abse brought out a volume of collected poetry. In the same year, he received the Wilfred Owen Poetry Award. Abse was a judge for the inaugural 2010 Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine. Abse was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to poetry and literature.

Abse died on 28 September 2014, six days after his 91st birthday.

<doc id="207981" wikidata="Q122382" url="?curid=207981" title="Henry Fuseli">
<text>Henry Fuseli ( ; ; 7 February 1741 – 17 April 1825) was a Swiss painter, draughtsman, and writer on art who spent much of his life in Britain.

Many of his successful works depict supernatural experiences, such as &quot;The Nightmare&quot;. He produced painted works for John Boydell&#x27;s Shakespeare Gallery and his own &quot;Milton Gallery&quot;. He held the posts of Professor of Painting and Keeper at the Royal Academy. His style had a considerable influence on many younger British artists, including William Blake.

==Biography==
Fuseli was born on 7 February 1741, in Zürich, the second of 18 children. Among his brothers and sisters were Johann Kaspar and Anna. His father was Johann Caspar Füssli, a painter of portraits and landscapes, and author of &quot;Lives of the Helvetic Painters&quot;. He intended Henry for the church, and sent him to the Caroline college of Zürich, where he received a classical education. One of his schoolmates there was Johann Kaspar Lavater, with whom he became close friends.

After taking orders in 1761, Fuseli was forced to leave the country as a result of having helped Lavater to expose an unjust magistrate, whose powerful family sought revenge. He travelled through Germany, and then, in 1765, visited England, where he supported himself for some time by miscellaneous writing. Eventually, he became acquainted with Sir Joshua Reynolds, to whom he showed his drawings. Following Reynolds&#x27; advice, he decided to devote himself entirely to art. In 1770 he made an art-pilgrimage to Italy, where he remained until 1778, changing his name from Füssli to the more Italian-sounding Fuseli. In Rome he moved in the same circles as the Scottish artist Alexander Runciman and the Swedish sculptor Tobias Sergel.

In early 1779, he returned to Britain, visiting Zürich on the way. In London, he found a commission awaiting him from Alderman Boydell, who was then setting up his Shakespeare Gallery. Fuseli painted a number of pieces for Boydell, and published an English edition of Lavater&#x27;s work on physiognomy. He also gave William Cowper some valuable assistance in preparing a translation of Homer. In 1788, Fuseli married Sophia Rawlins (originally one of his models), and he soon after became an associate of the Royal Academy. The early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, whose portrait he had painted, planned a trip with him to Paris, and pursued him determinedly, but communication between the two was stopped by Rawlins. Fuseli later said &quot;I hate clever women. They are only troublesome&quot;. In 1790, he became a full academician, presenting &quot;Thor Battering the Midgard Serpent&quot; as his diploma work. In 1799 Fuseli was appointed professor of painting to the Academy. Four years later he was chosen as Keeper, and resigned his professorship, but resumed it in 1810, continuing to hold both offices until his death. He was succeeded as keeper by Henry Thomson.

In 1799, Fuseli exhibited a series of paintings from subjects furnished by the works of John Milton, with a view to forming a Milton gallery comparable to Boydell&#x27;s Shakespeare gallery. There were 47 Milton paintings, many of them very large, completed at intervals over nine years. The exhibition proved a commercial failure and closed in 1800. In 1805 he brought out an edition of Matthew Pilkington&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Painters&quot;, which did little for his reputation.

Antonio Canova, when on his visit to England, was much taken with Fuseli&#x27;s works, and on returning to Rome in 1817 caused him to be elected a member of the first class in the Accademia di San Luca.

==Works==
As a painter, Fuseli favoured the supernatural. He pitched everything on an ideal scale, believing a certain amount of exaggeration necessary in the higher branches of historical painting. In this theory he was confirmed by the study of Michelangelo&#x27;s works and the marble statues of the Monte Cavallo, which, when at Rome, he liked to contemplate in the evening, relieved against a murky sky or illuminated by lightning.

Describing his style, William Michael Rossetti in the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition said that:His figures are full of life and earnestness, and seem to have an object in view which they follow with intensity. Like Rubens he excelled in the art of setting his figures in motion. Though the lofty and terrible was his proper sphere, Fuseli had a fine perception of the ludicrous. The grotesque humour of his fairy scenes, especially those taken from &quot;A Midsummer-Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, is in its way not less remarkable than the poetic power of his more ambitious works.

Though not noted as a colourist, Fuseli was described as a master of light and shadow. Rather than setting out his palette methodically in the manner of most painters, he merely distributed the colours across it randomly. He often used his pigments in the form of a dry powder, which he hastily combined on the end of his brush with oil, or turpentine, or gold size, regardless of the quantity, and depending on accident for the general effect. This recklessness may perhaps be explained by the fact that he did not paint in oil until the age of 25.
Fuseli painted more than 200 pictures, but he exhibited only a small number of them. His earliest painting represented &quot;Joseph Interpreting the Dreams of the Baker and Butler&quot;, but the first to excite particular attention was &quot;The Nightmare&quot;, exhibited in 1782, a painting of which he painted several versions. Themes seen in &quot;The Nightmare&quot; such as horror, dark magic and sexuality, were echoed in his 1796 painting, &quot;Night-Hag visiting the Lapland Witches&quot;.

His sketches or designs numbered about 800; they have admirable qualities of invention and design and are frequently superior to his paintings. In his drawings, as in his paintings, his methods included deliberately exaggerating the proportions of the human body and throwing his figures into contorted attitudes. One technique involved setting down arbitrary points on a sheet, which then became the extreme points of the various limbs. Notable examples of these drawings were made in concert with George Richmond when the two artists were together in Rome. He rarely drew figures from life, basing his art on study of the antique and Michelangelo.

He produced no landscapes—&quot;Damn Nature! she always puts me out&quot; was his characteristic exclamation—and painted only two portraits. However, similar to contemporary landscape painters such as J. M. W. Turner, he evoked qualities of terror and the sublime.

Many interesting anecdotes of Fuseli, and his relations to contemporary artists, are given in his &quot;Life&quot; by John Knowles (1831). He influenced the art of Fortunato Duranti.

==Writings==
He was a thorough master of French, Italian, English and German, and could write in all these languages with equal facility and vigour, although he preferred German as the vehicle of his thoughts. His principal written work was his series of twelve lectures delivered to the Royal Academy, begun in 1801.

==Influence==
His pupils included David Wilkie, Benjamin Haydon, William Etty, and Edwin Landseer. William Blake, who was 16 years his junior, recognized a debt to him, and for a time many English artists copied his mannerisms.

==Death==
After a life of uninterrupted good health, he died on 17 April 1825, at the house of the Countess of Guildford on Putney Hill, aged 84, and was buried in the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. He was comparatively wealthy at the time of his death.

<text>The PowerOpen Environment (POE), created in 1991 from the AIM alliance, is an open standard for running a Unix-based operating system on the PowerPC computer architecture.

==History==
The AIM alliance was announced on October 2, 1991, yielding the historic first technology partnership between Apple and IBM. One of its many lofty goals was to somehow eventually merge Apple&#x27;s user-friendly graphical interface and desktop applications market with IBM&#x27;s highly scalable Unix server market, allowing the two companies to enter what Apple believed to be an emerging &quot;general desktop open systems market&quot;. This was touched upon by Apple&#x27;s November 1991 announcement of A/UX 3.0. The upcoming A/UX 4.0 (never actually released) would target the PowerOpen Environment ABI, merge features of IBM&#x27;s AIX variant of Unix into A/UX, and use the OSF/1 kernel from the Open Software Foundation. A/UX 3.0 would serve as an &quot;important migration path&quot; to this new system, making Unix and System 7 applications compliant with PowerOpen. A/UX 4.0 and AIX were intended to run on a variety of IBM&#x27;s POWER and PowerPC hardware, and on Apple&#x27;s PowerPC based hardware.

The need for the POE reduced due to the increasing availability of Unix-like operating systems on PowerPC, such as Linux distributions and AIX. The PowerOpen Association was formed to promote the POE and test for conformance, and disbanded in 1995. That year, other AIM elements disbanded.

==Overview==
The POE contains API and ABI specifications. The presence of the ABI specification in the POE distinguishes it from other open systems such as POSIX and XPG4, since it allows platform-independent binary compatibility, which is otherwise typically limited to particular hardware. Derived from AIX, the POE conforms to industry open standards including POSIX, XPG4, and Motif.

The POE is hardware bus independent. System implementations can range from laptop computers to supercomputers. It requires a multi-user, multitasking operating system. It provides networking support, an X Window System extension, a Macintosh Application Services extension, and Motif.

Macintosh Application Services (MAS) was an Apple software product intended to run existing Mac applications alongside other applications in the X environment, including those written for the 680x0 architecture. Also supporting Mac applications that had been ported to PowerPC, MAS was described as &quot;Apple&#x27;s key contribution to the PowerOpen alliance&quot; and was demonstrated running Mac applications including a QuickTime movie on three different workstation platforms. It was an optional component in the PowerOpen architecture.

<doc id="207985" wikidata="Q1872394" url="?curid=207985" title="Rick Dangerous">
<text>Rick Dangerous is a platform game developed by Core Design for the Acorn Archimedes, Amiga, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS. The game was released in 1989 and published by MicroProse on the Firebird Software label in the UK, and on the MicroPlay label in America. It was also published in Spain by Erbe Software. Later, it was released with two other games, &quot;Stunt Car Racer&quot; and &quot;MicroProse Soccer&quot;, on the Commodore 64 &quot;Powerplay 64&quot; cartridge. The game was followed by a sequel, &quot;Rick Dangerous 2&quot;, in 1990. Loosely based on the Indiana Jones film franchise, the game received mixed reviews from critics.

== Plot ==
The plot of &quot;Rick Dangerous&quot; is largely based on the Indiana Jones film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. Set in 1945, British agent Rick Dangerous travels to the Amazon jungle to search for the lost Goolu tribe. His plane crashes in the jungle, and Rick must escape from the enraged Goolu. When the game starts Rick finds himself in a cave running from a rolling boulder, a famous scene from the Indiana Jones film.

Armed with a pistol and dynamite, Rick must fight hostiles and evade traps in three more levels. The second level of the game is set inside a pyramid located in Egypt. In the third level, Rick must venture to the Nazi stronghold of Schwarzendumpf castle to rescue captured Allied soldiers. The rescued soldiers tell him that the Nazis are planning a missile attack on London. Therefore, in the last level, Rick must infiltrate their secret missile base.

== Gameplay ==
Rick can jump and climb, as well as carry a limited amount of dynamite and ammunition for his gun. This gun is Rick&#x27;s primary means of disposing of enemies. Most traps throughout the game that can kill Rick can also kill his enemies, which can be to the player&#x27;s advantage. The dynamite sticks that Rick carries are generally used for solving puzzles, such as through exploding certain blocks (some of them fly &quot;towards&quot; the explosion, potentially killing Rick in the backfire). Rick is also armed with a pogo stick that allows him to paralyze enemies.

Many of the traps in &quot;Rick Dangerous&quot; have no visible warning, which means that a player&#x27;s initial progress through the game may consist of trial and error. This was criticized by some reviewers.

== Reception ==

&quot;Your Sinclair&quot; awarded &quot;Rick Dangerous&quot; a 78% rating, while &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; gave the Spectrum game an 87%, plus a &quot;C+VG Hit&quot; award, saying that it was &quot;an excellent platform game ...&quot;

The C64 version received an 84% from &quot;CU Amiga-64&quot; and a 73% from &quot;Zzap!64&quot;. &quot;Zzap!64&quot; pointed out that the game was a playable and fun platform-style game but not much more than that. The Amstrad version also received the same response getting a 76% from &quot;The Games Machine&quot;, although the game fared slightly better with &quot;Amstrad Action&quot; who rated it 83% and awarded it with an &quot;AA Rave&quot; accolade.

&quot;ACE&quot; gave the Amiga version an 890 rating, and &quot;Amiga Format&quot; gave an 89%. &quot;Amiga Power&quot; was highly critical of both games and the reliance on pattern learning.

The Atari ST version received positive reviews; 88% and 87% from &quot;The One for 16-bit Games&quot; and &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;, respectively. &quot;The One&quot; magazine opined that &quot;Rick Dangerous&quot; was one of the best 16-bit arcade games at that time.

Game developer David Cage considers &quot;Rick Dangerous&quot; to be his favourite game.

<doc id="207987" wikidata="Q447770" url="?curid=207987" title="Heracles of Macedon">
<text>Heracles of Macedon (; c. 327 – 309 BC) was a reputed illegitimate son of Alexander the Great of Macedon by Barsine, daughter of Satrap Artabazus of Phrygia. Heracles was named after the Greek mythological hero of the same name, from whom the Argeads claimed descent.

==History==
It cannot be established definitively whether Heracles was Alexander&#x27;s son or not. Of the ancient sources, both Plutarch and Justin mention Barsine and Heracles but Arrian in the Alexander&#x27;s Anabasis mentions neither. Plutarch recounts that Alexander took Barsine as his mistress, but on the arguably spurious grounds that she was recommended to him by Parmenion (despite the many disagreements between him and Alexander, and Alexander&#x27;s apparent contempt for his judgement). Of Barsine, Mary Renault states that:

If Heracles &quot;was&quot; Alexander&#x27;s illegitimate child, then it also raises the pointed question as to why he, as Alexander&#x27;s only living son at the time of his death, was not immediately drawn into the succession disputes, and why he was passed over in favour of Philip Arrhidaeus –– who was only a son of Alexander&#x27;s father Philip, and thus a more distant claimant than Heracles. Renault concludes that the romance with Barsine was invented retrospectively to validate Heracles&#x27; parentage.

On Alexander&#x27;s death Nearchus, who was then son-in-law of Barsine, advocated for Heracles&#x27; inheritance, but was unsuccessful.

Either way, Heracles lived in obscurity until Alexander IV&#x27;s murder by Cassander in 310 BC or 309 BC. At that point Polyperchon, a regent of Macedon who had been replaced by Cassander and had all but disappeared for the previous six years, began championing Heracles as Alexander&#x27;s true heir, and Polyperchon began forming an army. Instead of fighting, Cassander negotiated with Polyperchon. By offering Polyperchon various bribes such as a sinecure and a large number of talents, Cassander persuaded him to murder Heracles, and Polyperchon retired to obscurity once more.

<doc id="207992" wikidata="Q9701" url="?curid=207992" title="Emperor Taizong of Tang">
<text>Emperor Taizong of Tang (28January 59810July 649), previously Prince of Qin, personal name Li Shimin, was the second emperor of the Tang dynasty of China, ruling from 626 to 649. He is traditionally regarded as a co-founder of the dynasty for his role in encouraging his father Li Yuan (Emperor Gaozu) to rebel against the Sui dynasty at Jinyang in 617. Taizong subsequently played a pivotal role in defeating several of the dynasty&#x27;s most dangerous opponents and solidifying its rule over China proper.

Taizong is considered to be one of the greatest emperors in China&#x27;s history, and henceforth his reign became regarded as the exemplary model against which all future emperors were measured. His era, the &quot;Reign of Zhenguan&quot; () is considered a golden age in ancient Chinese history and was treated as required studying material for future crown princes. Taizong continued to develop imperial examination systems. He asked his officials to be loyal to policies, not people, in order to eliminate corruption. Under the Zhenguan era, Tang China flourished economically and militarily. For more than a century after his death, China enjoyed prosperity and peace brought about by the solidification of imperial protection over the Chinese regions. In territorial extent, it covered most of the territories previously held by the Han dynasty as well as parts of modern-day Korea, Vietnam, Russia, Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Central Asia. This era of consolidation and conquest laid the foundation for Xuanzong&#x27;s reign, which is considered to be the height of the Tang dynasty.

In 630, Emperor Taizong sent his general Li Jing against the Eastern Turks, defeating and capturing their Jiali Khan Ashina Duobi and destroying their power. This made Tang the dominant power in East and Central Asia, and Emperor Taizong subsequently took the title &quot;Khan of Heaven&quot;. He also launched a series of campaigns against the oasis states of the Tarim Basin, and against their main ally, the Western Turks. During his reign, Tang armies annexed Karakhoja in 640, Karasahr in 644, and Kucha in 648. Eventually, the Tang defeated and annexed the Western Turkic Khaganate after Su Dingfang defeated Qaghan Ashina Helu in 657.

Unlike much of the nobility in his time, Emperor Taizong was a frank rationalist and scholar of logic and scientific reason, openly scorning superstitions and claims of signs from the heavens. He also modified important rites in order to ease the burden of agricultural labour. The modern Chinese historian Bo Yang opined that Emperor Taizong achieved greatness by enduring criticism which others would find difficult to accept whilst trying hard not to abuse his absolute power (using Emperor Yang of Sui as a negative example), as well as by employing capable chancellors such as Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, and Wei Zheng. Emperor Taizong&#x27;s wife Empress Zhangsun also proved to be a capable assistant.

==Early life==
Li Shimin was born in 598 at Wugong, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi. His father Li Yuan, the Duke of Tang, was a general of the Sui dynasty, and a nephew, by marriage, to Sui&#x27;s founding emperor Emperor Wen. Li Shimin&#x27;s grandmother Duchess Dugu was a sister of Empress Dugu, both of whom were daughters of Dugu Xin, a major Xianbei general during Sui&#x27;s predecessor dynasty Northern Zhou. Li Shimin&#x27;s mother, Li Yuan&#x27;s wife Duchess Dou, was a daughter of Dou Yi (), the Duke of Shenwu, and his wife, Northern Zhou&#x27;s Princess Xiangyang. Li Shimin was also of partial Xianbei descent. Duchess Dou bore Li Yuan four sons—an older brother to Li Shimin, Li Jiancheng, and two younger brothers, Li Yuanba (), who would die in 614, and Li Yuanji – and at least one daughter (the later Princess Pingyang). Li Yuan named Li Shimin &quot;Shimin&quot; as a shortened form of the phrase &quot;save the earth and pacify the people&quot; (). Li Shimin apparently showed talent early in his life, and in 613, the official Gao Shilian, impressed with him, gave him a niece (the later Empress Zhangsun) in marriage as his wife; he was 14 and she was 12. In 615, when Emperor Wen&#x27;s son and successor Emperor Yang was ambushed by Eastern Turkic (&quot;Dongtujue&quot;) forces under Shibi Khan at Yanmen Commandery (present-day Daixian in Shanxi), a general call was made for men to join the army to help rescue the emperor. Li Shimin answered that call and served under the general Yun Dingxing (), apparently doing so with distinction. In 616, when Li Yuan was put in charge of the important city of Taiyuan, he brought Li Shimin with him to Taiyuan, while leaving at least three other sonsLi Jiancheng, Li Yuanji, and Li Zhiyun (, by Li Yuan&#x27;s concubine Lady Wan)at the ancestral home Hedong (, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi).

==Participation in the rebellion against Sui rule==

Emperor Yang was soon dissatisfied with Li Yuan and Wang Rengong (), the governor of Mayi Commandery (, roughly modern Shuozhou, Shanxi), over their inability to stop Eastern Turkic incursions and the growing strength of agrarian rebels, particularly the Eastern Turkic-supported Liu Wuzhou, who soon rose against Wang, killed him, and captured Emperor Yang&#x27;s secondary palace near Taiyuan. Li Yuan also became fearful of a prophecy that the next emperor would be named Li—Emperor Yang had previously killed another official, Li Hun (), and Li Hun&#x27;s clan over his fear that Li Hun&#x27;s nephew, Li Min (), would seize the throne.

Fearful for his life, Li Yuan considered rebellion. However, he did not know that Li Shimin had also been secretly discussing plans for rebellion with Li Yuan&#x27;s associates Pei Ji and Liu Wenjing. Once Li Shimin&#x27;s plans matured, he had Pei inform Li Yuan of them—and also had Pei warn Li Yuan that if it were revealed that Li Yuan had had sexual relations with some of Emperor Yang&#x27;s ladies in waiting at the secondary Jinyang Palace (, which Pei was in charge with and had allowed Li Yuan to do so), all of them would be slaughtered. Li Yuan agreed to rebel, and after secretly summoning Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji from Hedong and his son-in-law Chai Shao () from the capital Chang&#x27;an, he declared a rebellion, claiming to want to support Emperor Yang&#x27;s grandson Yang You the Prince of Dai, nominally in charge at Chang&#x27;an with Emperor Yang at Jiangdu (, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), as emperor. He made both Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin major generals and advanced southwest, toward Chang&#x27;an. He gave Li Shimin the title of Duke of Dunhuang. After defeating local Sui forces loyal to Emperor Yang, he defeated a Sui army of 30,000 men under the command of a veteran general of the wars in Korea outside of modern-day Beijing.

However, when Li Yuan arrived near Hedong, his army was bogged down by the weather. With food running out, there were rumors that the Eastern Turks and Liu Wuzhou would attack Taiyuan. Li Yuan initially ordered retreat, but at the earnest opposition by Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin, continued to advance. After defeating Sui forces at Huoyi (, also in modern Yuncheng), he decided to leave a small contingent to watch over Hedong while advancing across the Yellow River into Guanzhong (i.e., the Chang&#x27;an region). Once he did, he headed for Chang&#x27;an himself, while sending Li Jiancheng to capture the territory around the Tong Pass region to prevent Sui forces at Luoyang from reinforcing Chang&#x27;an and Li Shimin north of the Wei River to capture territory there. Meanwhile, Li Shimin&#x27;s sister Pingyang had also risen in rebellion in support of him, and she was able to gather a sizeable army and capture some cities. She joined forces with Li Shimin and her husband Chai Shao. Soon, Li Yuan reconsolidated his forces and put Chang&#x27;an under siege. In winter 617, after defeating a large Sui army, he captured Chang&#x27;an from imperial forces and declared Yang You emperor (as Emperor Gong). He had himself made regent (with the title of grand chancellor) and created the Prince of Tang. (Meanwhile, most of the Sui territories and armies did not recognize Emperor Gong as emperor and continued to recognize Emperor Yang as emperor and not as retired emperor.) He made Li Shimin the Duke of Qin.

Li Yuan&#x27;s control of the Chang&#x27;an region became almost immediately contested by the rebel ruler Xue Ju, the Emperor of Qin, who sent his son Xue Rengao toward Chang&#x27;an. Li Yuan sent Li Shimin to resist Xue Rengao, and Li Shimin defeated Xue Rengao at Fufeng (in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), temporarily causing Xue Ju to toy with the idea of surrendering to Li Yuan, although Xue was subsequently dissuaded by his strategist Hao Yuan () from doing so.

In spring 618, with Sui&#x27;s eastern capital Luoyang (where the officials in charge did not recognize Li Yuan&#x27;s authorities) under attack by the rebel ruler Li Mi the Duke of Wei, Li Yuan sent Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin to Luoyang, ostensibly to aid the Sui forces at Luoyang but instead intending to test whether Luoyang might submit to him. The officials at Luoyang rebuffed his attempt at rapprochement, and Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin, not wanting to fight either them or Li Mi for control of Luoyang at this stage, withdrew. Li Yuan subsequently changed Li Shimin&#x27;s title to Duke of Zhao.

In summer 618, when news arrived at Chang&#x27;an that Emperor Yang had been killed at Jiangdu in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji, Li Yuan had Emperor Gong yield the throne to him, establishing Tang dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu. He created Li Jiancheng crown prince but created Li Shimin the Prince of Qin, also making him &quot;Shangshu Ling&quot; (), the head of the executive bureau of the government () and a post considered one for a chancellor, while continuing to have Li Shimin serve as a major general as well.

==During Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s reign==
===Campaign to reunify the empire===
The first thing that Li Shimin had to deal with was another incursion by Xue Ju, as Xue attacked Jing Prefecture (, roughly modern Pingliang, Gansu) and Emperor Gaozu sent Li Shimin to resist Xue. Li Shimin established his defenses and refused to engage Xue to try to wear Xue Ju out, but at that time, he was afflicted with malaria, and he let his assistants Liu Wenjing and Yin Kaishan () take command, ordering them not to engage Xue Ju. Liu and Yin, however, did not take Xue Ju seriously, and Xue Ju ambushed them at Qianshui Plain (, in modern Xianyang), crushing Tang forces and inflicting 50–60% casualties. Li Shimin was forced to withdraw back to Chang&#x27;an, and Liu and Yin were removed from their posts. (This would be Li Shimin&#x27;s only defeat recorded in historical records until the Goguryeo campaign of 645.) Xue Ju, in light of his victory, was ready to launch an assault on Chang&#x27;an itself, under Hao Yuan&#x27;s advice, but suddenly died of an illness in fall 618 and was succeeded by Xue Rengao. Emperor Gaozu then sent Li Shimin against Xue Rengao. Three months after Xue Rengao took the throne, Li Shimin engaged him, and after a fierce battle between Li Shimin and Xue Rengao&#x27;s major general Zong Luohou (), Li Shimin crushed Zong&#x27;s forces, and then attacked Xue Rengao. Xue Rengao was forced to withdraw into the city of Gaozhi (, in modern Xianyang as well), and once he did, his soldiers began surrendering to Li Shimin en masse. Xue Rengao was himself forced to surrender. Li Shimin had him delivered to Chang&#x27;an, where he was executed. Around new year 619, Emperor Gaozu made Li Shimin &quot;Taiwei&quot; (, one of the Three Excellencies) and put him in charge of Tang operations east of the Tong Pass.

In spring 619, Liu Wuzhou launched a major offensive against Tang. He captured Taiyuan in summer 619, forcing Li Yuanji, who had been in charge there, to flee, and then continued his offensive south. Emperor Gaozu sent Pei Ji against him, but by winter 619, Liu had crushed Pei&#x27;s forces and taken over nearly all of modern Shanxi. Emperor Gaozu, shocked at the development, considered abandoning the region altogether. Li Shimin opposed doing so and offered to lead the army against Liu. Emperor Gaozu agreed and commissioned him with an army. He crossed the Yellow River and approached Liu&#x27;s major general Song Jingang () but did not engage him, choosing to try to wear Song out, only having his subordinates Yin Kaishan and Qin Shubao engage the other Dingyang generals Yuchi Jingde and Xun Xiang () in relatively low-level engagements. Eventually, in spring 620, when Liu and Song ran out of food supplies, they retreated, and Li Shimin gave chase, dealing Song a major defeat. Yuchi and Xun surrendered, and after Li Shimin chased further, both Liu and Song fled to the Eastern Turks. All of Dingyang territory fell into Tang hands.

In summer 620, Emperor Gaozu again commissioned Li Shimin against a major enemy—the former Sui general Wang Shichong, who had Sui&#x27;s last emperor, Emperor Yang&#x27;s grandson Yang Tong, yield the throne to him in 619, establishing a new state of Zheng as its emperor. When Li Shimin arrived at the Zheng capital Luoyang, Wang offered peace, but Li Shimin rebuffed him and put Luoyang under siege. Meanwhile, his subordinates took Zheng cities one by one. By winter 620, most of Zheng territory, other than Luoyang and Xiangyang, defended by Wang Shichong&#x27;s nephew Wang Honglie (), had submitted to Tang. Wang sought aid Dou Jiande the Prince of Xia, who controlled most of modern Hebei. Dou, reasoning that if Tang were able to destroy Zheng, his own Xia state would be next, agreed. He sent his official Li Dashi to try to persuade Li Shimin to withdraw, but Li Shimin detained Li Dashi and gave no response. Meanwhile, during the campaign, Li Shimin chose some 1,000 elite soldiers (), clad in black uniform and black armor, commanded by himself, to serve as advance troops, with Qin Shubao, Yuchi Jingde, Cheng Zhijie (), and Zhai Zhangsun () as his assistants.
By spring 621, Luoyang was in desperate situation, and Xia forces had not yet arrived, but Tang troops had also suffered serious casualties, as Luoyang&#x27;s defenses, aided by powerful bows and catapults, were holding. Emperor Gaozu, hearing that Dou had decided to come to Wang&#x27;s aid, ordered Li Shimin to withdraw, but Li Shimin sent his secretary Feng Deyi to Chang&#x27;an to explain to Emperor Gaozu that if he did withdraw, Wang would recover and again be a major threat in the future. Emperor Gaozu agreed and allowed Li Shimin to continue to siege Luoyang. When Xia forward troops arrived first, Li Shimin surprised and defeated them, and then sent Dou a letter suggesting that he withdraw. Dou would not do so, and, against the advice of his wife Empress Cao and secretary general Ling Jing () that he should instead attack Tang&#x27;s prefectures in modern southern Shanxi, he marched toward Luoyang. Anticipating Dou&#x27;s maneuver, Li Shimin left a small detachment, commanded by Li Yuanji, at Luoyang, while marching east himself, taking up position at the strategic Hulao Pass. When the armies engaged at Hulao, Li Shimin defeated Dou and captured him. He took Dou back to Luoyang and displayed him to Wang Shichong. Wang, in fear, considered abandoning Luoyang and fleeing south to Xiangyang, but as his generals pointed out that his only hope was Dou, he surrendered. Xia forces, after initially fleeing back to their capital Mingzhou (now Guangfu, Hebei), also surrendered. Zheng and Xia territory were Tang&#x27;s. Li Shimin returned to Chang&#x27;an in a grand victory procession and, to reward Li Shimin, Emperor Gaozu awarded both him and Li Yuanji three mints so that they could mint money of their own. He also bestowed on Li Shimin the special title of &quot;Grand General of Heavenly Strategies&quot; (). Meanwhile, Li Shimin&#x27;s staff, already full of generals and strategists, were supplemented with a number of literary men.

The former Xia territory did not remain in Tang hands for long. In the winter of 621, the Xia general Liu Heita rose against Tang rule, claiming to be avenging Dou, whom Emperor Gaozu had executed against Li Shimin&#x27;s wishes after he had been brought back to Chang&#x27;an. Liu was allied with Xu Yuanlang, a former agrarian rebel general who was nominally under Wang Shichong and who had submitted to Tang after Wang&#x27;s defeat. Liu dealt successive defeats to Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s cousin Li Shentong (), the Prince of Huai&#x27;an; Li Xiaochang (), the Prince of Yi&#x27;an; and Li Shiji. By the end, he had recovered almost all of the former Xia territory, established his capital at Mingzhou, and proclaimed himself the Prince of Handong. Emperor Gaozu finally sent Li Shimin and Li Yuanji against him in 622 and, after some indecisive battles, Li Shimin defeated him by first erecting a dam across the Ming River and then destroying it, with the resultant flood destroying the rebel army. Liu fled to the Eastern Turks, while Li Shimin then headed east and defeated Xu. After leaving Li Shiji, Li Shentong, and Ren Gui () to continue attacking Xu, Li Shimin returned to Chang&#x27;an.

===Struggle against Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji===


By this point, Li Shimin and his older brother Li Jiancheng, who was created crown prince in 618, reportedly after Emperor Gaozu first offered the position to Li Shimin due to his contributions, were locked in an intense rivalry, as Li Shimin&#x27;s accomplishments caused people to speculate that he would displace Li Jiancheng as crown prince, and Li Jiancheng, while an accomplished general himself, was overshadowed by his younger brother. The court became divided into a faction favoring the Crown Prince and a faction favoring the Prince of Qin. The rivalry was particularly causing problems within the capital, as the commands of the Crown Prince, the Prince of Qin, and the Prince of Qi Li Yuanji were said to have the same force as the emperor&#x27;s edicts, and the officials had to carry conflicting orders out by acting on the ones that arrived first. Li Shimin&#x27;s staff was full of talented men, but Li Jiancheng was supported by Li Yuanji, as well as Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s concubines, who had better relationships with Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji than they did with Li Shimin.

Late in 622, when Liu Heita returned east after receiving aid from the Eastern Turks, defeating and killing Li Shimin&#x27;s cousin Li Daoxuan (), the Prince of Huaiyang, he again regained most of former Xia territory. Li Jiancheng&#x27;s staff members Wang Gui and Wei Zheng suggested that Li Jiancheng needed to enhance his own reputation in battle, and so Li Jiancheng volunteered for the mission. Emperor Gaozu thus sent Li Jiancheng, assisted by Li Yuanji, to attack Liu. Li Jiancheng defeated Liu around the new year of 623, and Liu was subsequently betrayed by his own official Zhuge Dewei () and delivered to Li Jiancheng. Li Jiancheng executed Liu in his former capital and returned to Chang&#x27;an in triumph. China was, by this point, roughly united under Tang rule.

For the next few years, the rivalry intensified, although during the meantime both Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin served as generals when the Eastern Göktürks made incursions. In 623, when the general Fu Gongshi rebelled at Danyang (, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu), Emperor Gaozu briefly commissioned Li Shimin to attack Fu, but soon cancelled the order and sent Li Shimin&#x27;s cousin Li Xiaogong the Prince of Zhao Commandery instead.

In 624, when Li Jiancheng was found to have, against regulations, tried to add soldiers to his guard corps, Emperor Gaozu was so angry that he put Li Jiancheng under arrest. In fear, Li Jiancheng&#x27;s guard commander Yang Wen&#x27;gan () rebelled. Emperor Gaozu sent Li Shimin against Yang, offering to make him crown prince after he returned. After Li Shimin left, however, Feng Deyi (now a chancellor), Li Yuanji, and the concubines all spoke on Li Jiancheng&#x27;s behalf, and after Li Shimin returned, Emperor Gaozu did not depose Li Jiancheng, but instead blamed the discord between him and Li Shimin on Li Jiancheng&#x27;s staff members Wang Gui and Wei Ting () and Li Shimin&#x27;s staff member Du Yan, exiling them to Xi Prefecture (, roughly modern Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan).

Later that year, Emperor Gaozu, troubled by repeated Göktürk incursions, seriously considered burning Chang&#x27;an to the ground and moving the capital to Fancheng, a suggestion that Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji, and Pei Ji agreed with. Li Shimin opposed, however, and the plan was not carried out. Meanwhile, Li Shimin himself was sending his confidants to Luoyang to build up personal control of the army there. After an incident in which Li Shimin suffered a severe case of food poisoning after feasting at Li Jiancheng&#x27;s palace—an event that both Emperor Gaozu and Li Shimin apparently interpreted as an assassination attempt—Emperor Gaozu considered sending Li Shimin to guard Luoyang to prevent further conflict, but Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji, after consulting each other, believed that this would only give Li Shimin an opportunity to build up his personal power there, and therefore opposed it. Emperor Gaozu therefore did not carry out the plan. Meanwhile, the rivalry continued. Traditional historical accounts also indicated that at one point, when Li Shimin visited Li Yuanji&#x27;s mansion, Li Yuanji wanted to assassinate Li Shimin, but Li Jiancheng, who could not resolve to kill a brother, stopped the plot. There was yet another incident in which Li Jiancheng, knowing that a horse threw its rider easily, had Li Shimin ride it, causing Li Shimin to fall off from it several times.

By 626, Li Shimin was fearful that he would be killed by Li Jiancheng, and his staff members Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, and Zhangsun Wuji were repeatedly encouraging Li Shimin to attack Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji first—while Wei Zheng was encouraging Li Jiancheng to attack Li Shimin first. Li Jiancheng persuaded Emperor Gaozu to remove Fang and Du, as well as Li Shimin&#x27;s trusted guard generals Yuchi Jingde and Cheng Zhijie, from Li Shimin&#x27;s staff. Zhangsun Wuji, who remained on Li Shimin&#x27;s staff, continued to try to persuade Li Shimin to attack first.

In summer 626, the Göktürks were making another attack, and under Li Jiancheng&#x27;s suggestion, Emperor Gaozu, instead of sending Li Shimin to resist the Göktürks as he first was inclined, decided to send Li Yuanji instead. Li Yuanji was given command of much of the army previously under Li Shimin&#x27;s control, further troubling Li Shimin, who believed that with the army in Li Yuanji&#x27;s hands, he would be unable to resist an attack. Li Shimin had Yuchi summon Fang and Du back to his mansion secretly, and then on one night submitted an accusation to Emperor Gaozu that Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji were committing adultery with Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s concubines. Emperor Gaozu, in response, issued summonses to Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji for the next morning, convening the senior officials Pei Ji, Xiao Yu, and Chen Shuda to examine Li Shimin&#x27;s accusations. As Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji approached the central gate leading to Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s palace, Xuanwu Gate (), Li Shimin carried out the ambush he had set. He personally fired an arrow that killed Li Jiancheng. Subsequently, Yuchi Jingde killed Li Yuanji. Li Shimin&#x27;s forces entered the palace and, under the intimidation of Li Shimin&#x27;s forces, Emperor Gaozu agreed to create Li Shimin crown prince. Li Jiancheng&#x27;s and Li Yuanji&#x27;s sons were killed, and Li Shimin took Li Yuanji&#x27;s wife Princess Yang as a concubine. Two months later, with Li Shimin firmly in control of power, Emperor Gaozu yielded the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong).

==As emperor==

=== Early reign (626–633) ===
One of the first actions that Emperor Taizong carried out as emperor was releasing a number of ladies in waiting from the palace and returning them to their homes, so that they could be married. He made his wife Princess Zhangsun the empress, and their oldest son Li Chengqian the crown prince.

Emperor Taizong also immediately faced a crisis, as the Eastern Turkic leader Illig Qaghan (Ashina Duobi), along with his nephew the subordinate Tuli Khan Ashina Shibobi (), launched a major incursion toward Chang&#x27;an, and just 19 days after Emperor Taizong took the throne, the two khans were just across the Wei River from Chang&#x27;an. Emperor Taizong, accompanied by Gao Shilian and Fang Xuanling, was forced to meet Ashina Duobi across the river and personally negotiate peace terms, including tributes to Eastern Turks, before Ashina Duobi withdrew.

Late in 626, Emperor Taizong ranked the contributors to Tang rule and granted them titles and fiefs, naming among the first rank of contributors Zhangsun Wuji, Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, Yuchi Jingde, and Hou Junji. When Li Shentong, as his distant uncle, objected to being ranked under Fang and Du, Emperor Taizong personally explained how Fang and Du&#x27;s strategies allowed him to be successful, and this managed to get the other objectors to quiet down, as Emperor Taizong was even willing to rank low such an honored individual as Li Shentong. Emperor Taizong also buried Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji with honors due imperial princes and had their staff members attend the funeral processions. Meanwhile, he appeared to begin to reshuffle government further—which he had already begun after being created crown prince—by dismissing his father&#x27;s trusted advisors Xiao Yu and Chen Shuda, making his own trusted advisors chancellors. (Xiao, however, was soon restored to being chancellor, although his career during Emperor Taizong&#x27;s reign would see repeated dismissals and repeated restorations.) However, he also began to greatly pay attention to the officials&#x27; submissions and their criticism of imperial governance, making changes where he saw needed. He also particularly began to trust Wei Zheng, accepting much advice from Wei as far as his personal conduct was concerned. He was also willing to demote his own trusted advisors, as he demoted Gao Shilian after finding that Gao had held back submissions from his deputy Wang Gui. Viewing Sui&#x27;s Emperor Yang as a negative example, he frequently solicited criticism, rewarding those officials willing to offer them, particularly Wei and Wang Gui. His openness to opposing ideas was also evident in his attempt to reconcile traditional Taoist religion and Buddhism, as demonstrated in his &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Preface to the Sacred Teachings&quot; (), and Emperor Taizong was at least a nominal Taoist.

====Li Yi&#x27;s Rebellion====
Also in 627, the general Li Yi the Prince of Yan—a late-Sui warlord who later submitted to Tang, who associated with Li Jiancheng—fearing that Emperor Taizong would eventually take action against him, rebelled at Bin Prefecture (, in modern Xianyang), but was quickly crushed by the official Yang Ji () and killed in flight. Later that year, when Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s cousin Li Youliang () the Prince of Changle, the commandant at Liang Prefecture (, roughly modern Wuwei, Gansu), was accused of allowing his staff to oppress the people and to trade with Qiang and Xiongnu tribesmen, Emperor Taizong sent the chancellor Yuwen Shiji (Yuwen Huaji&#x27;s brother) to investigate, and in fear, Li Youliang&#x27;s staff members plotted to hold him hostage and rebel. When this was discovered, Emperor Taizong forced Li Youliang to commit suicide. Late in the year, Wang Junkuo (), the commandant at You Prefecture (, roughly modern Beijing), also rebelled, but was defeated quickly and killed in flight. However, although there were also reports that Feng Ang (), a warlord in the Lingnan region, was rebelling, Emperor Taizong, at Wei&#x27;s suggestion, sent messengers to comfort Feng, and Feng submitted.

Also in 627, Emperor Taizong, seeing that there were too many prefectures and counties, consolidated and merged many of them, and further created another level of local political organization above prefectures—the circuit ()—dividing his state into 10 circuits.

====Campaign against the Eastern Turks====
In 628, with Ashina Duobi and Ashina Shibobi having a falling out, Ashina Shibobi submitted to Emperor Taizong, as did the chieftains of Khitan tribes, who had previously submitted to the Eastern Turks. With their khaganate in turmoil, Ashina Duobi was no longer able to protect the last late-Sui rebel ruler who alone remained standing against Tang pressure—Liang Shidu the Emperor of Liang, and in summer 628, with the Tang generals Chai Shao and Xue Wanjun () sieging the Liang capital Shuofang (in modern Yulin, Shaanxi), Liang Shidu&#x27;s cousin Liang Luoren () killed Liang Shidu and surrendered, finally uniting China. With the Eastern Turkic Khaganate weakened, their vassal Xueyantuo also broke away and formed its own khanate, and Emperor Taizong entered into an alliance with Xueyantuo&#x27;s leader Yinan, creating Yinan the Zhenzhupiqie Khan (or Zhenzhu Khan in short).

In late 629, believing the time ripe for a major attack on the Eastern Turks, Emperor Taizong commissioned the general Li Jing with overall command of a multi-pronged army, assisted by the generals Li Shiji, Li Daozong, Chai Shao, Xue Wanche (, Xue Wanjun&#x27;s brother) and Su Dingfang, attacking the Eastern Turks at multiple points. The army was successful in its attacks, forcing Ashina Duobi to flee, and by late spring 630, Ashina Duobi had been captured, and Eastern-Turkic chieftains all submitted to Tang. Emperor Taizong spared Ashina Duobi but detained him at Chang&#x27;an, and he considered what to do with the Eastern Turks.

The main opposing views were from the chancellors Wen Yanbo (who advocated leaving the Turks within China&#x27;s borders to serve as a defense perimeter) and Wei (who advocated leaving them outside the borders). Emperor Taizong accepted Wen&#x27;s suggestion and established a number of prefectures to accommodate the Turks, leaving them governed by their chieftains without creating a new khan to govern them.

In 631, Emperor Taizong established a feudal scheme, where the contributors to his reign were given, in addition to their current posts, additional posts as prefectural governors, to be passed on to their descendants. Soon, however, receiving much opposition to the plan, the strongest of which came from Zhangsun Wuji, Emperor Taizong cancelled the scheme.
After the conquest of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate, Emperor Taizong&#x27;s officials repeatedly requested that he carry out sacrifices to heaven and earth at Mount Tai, and Emperor Taizong, while at times tempted by the proposal, was repeatedly dissuaded from doing so by Wei, who pointed out the expenses and the labors that would be imposed on the people as a result, and also that this would open China&#x27;s borders to attack.

===Middle reign (634–641)===

In 634, Emperor Taizong sent 13 high level officials, including Li Jing and Xiao Yu, to examine the circuits to see whether the local officials were capable, to find out whether the people were suffering, to comfort the poor, and to select capable people to serve in civil service. (Li Jing initially recommended Wei Zheng, but Emperor Taizong declined sending Wei, stating that Wei needed to stay to point out his faults and that he could not afford to have Wei away even for a single day.)

====Campaign against Tuyuhun====

Around this time, Tang was having increasing conflicts with Tuyuhun, whose Busabo Khan Murong Fuyun, under instigation by his strategist the Prince of Tianzhu, had been repeatedly attacking Tang prefectures on the borders. At one point, Murong Fuyun sought to have a Tang princess marry his son the Prince of Zun, but the marriage negotiations broke down over Emperor Taizong&#x27;s insistence that the Prince of Zun come to Chang&#x27;an for the wedding. In summer 634, Emperor Taizong had the generals Duan Zhixuan and Fan Xing () lead forces against Tuyuhun, but with Tuyuhun&#x27;s forces highly mobile and avoiding direct confrontation, Duan, while not defeated, could not make major gains. Once Duan withdrew, Tuyuhun resumed hostilities. In winter 634, with the Tibetan king Songtsän Gampo making overtures to marry a Tang princess as well, Emperor Taizong sent the emissary Feng Dexia () to Tibet with an eye toward an alliance against Tuyuhun. In winter 634, he commissioned Li Jing, assisted by the other generals Hou Junji, Xue Wanjun, Xue Wanche, Qibi Heli, Li Daozong, Li Daliang, Li Daoyan (), and Gao Zengsheng (), to attack Tuyuhun. In 635, Li Jing&#x27;s forces crushed Tuyuhun forces. Murong Fuyun was killed by his own subordinates, and his son Murong Shun killed the Prince of Tianzhu and surrendered. Emperor Taizong created Murong Shun the new khan, although Murong Shun was soon assassinated. Emperor Taizong then created Murong Shun&#x27;s son Murong Nuohebo as the new khan.

Also in 635, Emperor Gaozu died, and Emperor Taizong, observing a mourning period, briefly had Li Chengqian serve as regent, and after he resumed his authorities less than two months later, he still authorized Li Chengqian to thereafter rule on minor matters.

In spring 636, Emperor Taizong commissioned his brothers and sons as commandants and changed their titles in accordance with the commands that they received, sending them to their posts—with the exception of his son Li Tai the Prince of Wei, who by this point was beginning to be highly favored by him. He further allowed Li Tai to engage literary men to serve as his assistants, as Li Tai favored literature. From this point on, Li Tai would be so favored that there began to be talks that Emperor Taizong might let him displace Li Chengqian, whose favors began to wane.
In fall 636, Empress Zhangsun died. Emperor Taizong mourned her bitterly and personally wrote the text of her monument.

In summer 637, Emperor Taizong recreated the feudal scheme that he had considered and abandoned in 631, creating 35 hereditary prefect posts. (By 639, however, the system was again abandoned after much opposition.)

====Treatment of Noble Clans====

Sometime before 638, Emperor Taizong, disgusted with the traditional noble clans of Cui, Lu, Li, and Zheng and believing that they were abusing their highly honored names, commissioned Gao Shilian, Wei Ting, Linghu Defen, and Cen Wenben to compile a work later to be known as the &quot;Records of Clans&quot; (), with the intent of dividing the clans into nine classes based on their past contributions, good deeds, and ill deeds. In an initial draft that Gao submitted, he nevertheless ranked the branch of the Cui clan that the official Cui Min&#x27;gan () belonged to as the highest, a decision that Emperor Taizong rebuked, as he pointed out that Gao was merely again looking at tradition and not the recent contributions. He therefore personally intervened in revising the work, reducing Cui&#x27;s clan to the third class.

====Tibetan attack on Songzhou====

In fall 638, Tibet&#x27;s Songtsän Gampo, displeased that Emperor Taizong had declined to give him a Tang princess in marriage and believing that Murong Nuohebo had persuaded Emperor Taizong to decline the marriage proposal, launched a major attack with forces of 200,000 on Tuyuhun and then on several Tang prefectures, putting Song Prefecture (, roughly modern Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan) under siege. Emperor Taizong commissioned Hou Junji, assisted by Zhishi Sili (), Niu Jinda (), and Liu Jian (), of a total of force of 50,000 to counterattack, and Niu, who commanded the forward forces, defeated Tibetan forces at Song Prefecture. Songsän Gampo withdrew and sued for peace, but still sought to marry a Tang princess. Emperor Taizong agreed this time.
Also in 638, believing that Xueyantuo was growing increasingly strong and difficult to control, Emperor Taizong granted Yinan&#x27;s sons Bazhuo and Jialibi () both lesser khan titles, to try to create dissensions between them.
In summer 639, Ashina Jiesheshuai (), the younger brother of Ashina Shibobi, whom Emperor Taizong did not favor and gave little recognition to, formed a conspiracy with Ashina Shibobi&#x27;s son Ashina Hexiangu () to assassinate Emperor Taizong. They had planned to wait for Li Zhi the Prince of Jin to depart from the palace in the morning and use that opportunity to attack the palace. On the day they planned, however, Li Zhi did not leave the palace, and Ashina Jiesheshuai attacked anyway but was quickly defeated, captured, and executed. After this incident, however, the officials began advocating sending the Turks away from the heart of the state. In fall 639, Emperor Taizong created a Turkish prince who had served him faithfully, Li Simo (né Ashina Simo) as the khan of a newly recreated Eastern Turkic state (as Qilibi Khan), giving him all of the Turks and Xiongnu who had surrendered as his subordinates, to be settled north of the Great Wall and the Yellow River. However, the Turks were fearful of Xueyantuo and initially refused to head to their new location. Emperor Taizong issued an edict to Yinan that he and Li Simo keep their peace and not attack each other, and after receiving from Yinan the assurance that he would not attack, the Turks advanced to the new location.

====Campaign against Western Turks====
Taizong began a series of campaigns against the Western Turks (&quot;Xitujue&quot;) and their allies, the oasis states of the Tarim Basin, around 640. These hostilities between the Western Turks and Tang would continue until the defeat and conquest of the Western Turks in 657 under Taizong&#x27;s successor, Gaozong. The kingdoms of Shule and Khotan surrendered to the Chinese in 632, as did the kingdom of Yarkand in 635. Qu Wentai (), the king of Gaochang, who had previously been submissive to Tang, had become increasingly hostile to Tang, allying with the Western Turks. In 640, Emperor Taizong commissioned Hou Junji, assisted by Xue Wanjun, to launch a major attack on Gaochang. As they approached Gaochang, Qu Wentai died in fear and was succeeded by his son Qu Zhisheng (). Qu Zhisheng offered to submit, but Hou demanded a surrender, which Qu Zhisheng refused. However, Hou put Gaochang under siege, and with aid from the Western Turks not arriving, Qu Zhisheng surrendered. Wei Zheng suggested that Emperor Taizong allow Qu Zhisheng to remain king, pointing out that the monetary and human costs would be high to keep a permanent garrison at Gaochang, but Emperor Taizong disagreed, and he converted Gaochang into two prefectures and annexed it into his state.

In winter 640, Songsän Gampo sent his prime minister Gar Tongtsen Yülsung (&quot;Lu Dongzan&quot; () in Chinese) as an emissary to Tang, offering tributes and again requesting marriage. Emperor Taizong created a daughter of a clansman as the Princess Wencheng, and in 641 sent Li Daozong to accompany Princess Wencheng to Tibet to preside over the wedding.
In winter 641, believing that Emperor Taizong was about to carry out sacrifices to heaven and earth at Mount Tai and would be unable to aid the Eastern Turks, Yinan launched a major attack on them, commanded by his son Dadu (). Li Simo was forced to retreat inside the Great Wall. Emperor Taizong commissioned Li Shiji, assisted by Zhang Jian (), Li Daliang, Zhang Shigui (), and Li Xiyu (), to attack Xueyantuo. Li Shiji soon defeated Dadu at Nuozhen River (, flowing through modern Baotou, Inner Mongolia), and Dadu fled.

===Late reign (642–649)===
By 642, it was clear that Li Tai had ambitions on replacing his brother Li Chengqian, and the governmental officials began to be divided into pro-Li Chengqian and pro-Li Tai factions. After urging by Wei Zheng and Chu Suiliang to take actions that would clarify that Li Chengqian&#x27;s position was secure, Emperor Taizong attempted to do so by making repeated statements to that effect, but his continued favoring of Li Tai led to continued speculation among officials.

Also by 642, Xueyantuo had posed a sufficiently serious threat (albeit still formally submissive) that Emperor Taizong saw two alternatives—destroying it by force or forming into a &quot;heqin&quot; relationship by marrying one of his daughters to Yinan. This particularly became an issue after the Tang general Qibi Heli (), the chieftain of the Qibi Tribe, was kidnapped by his own subordinates and taken to Xueyantuo. In order to ransom Qibi, Emperor Taizong made a promise to eventually give his daughter Princess Xinxing to Yinan in marriage, and Yinan released Qibi.
In the winter 642, an event took place in Goguryeo that would eventually precipitate wars between Tang and Goguryeo. According to Chinese accounts King Yeongnyu, the king of Goguryeo, was apprehensive about his general Yeon Gaesomun and was plotting with his other officials to kill Yeon. When Yeon received the news, he started a coup and killed the king and the high level officials. He declared King Yeongnyu&#x27;s nephew Go Jang (King Bojang) king, while taking power himself with the title of &quot;Dae Mangniji&quot; (, Generalissimo). When Emperor Taizong received the news, there were suggestions that an attack be launched against Goguryeo, suggestions that Emperor Taizong initially declined.

In spring 643, Wei died, and Emperor Taizong mourned him bitterly, authoring Wei&#x27;s monument himself and, prior to Wei&#x27;s death, promising to give his daughter Princess Hengshan in marriage to Wei&#x27;s son Wei Shuyu (). Later in spring, Emperor Taizong commissioned 24 portraits at Lingyan Pavilion to commemorate the 24 great contributors to his reign.

====Contacts with the Byzantine Empire====

The &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; and &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; mention several embassies made by &quot;Fu lin&quot; (; i.e. the Byzantine Empire), which they equated with Daqin (which may refer to the Roman Empire or Middle East), beginning in 643 with an embassy sent by the king &quot;Boduoli&quot; (, i.e. Constans II Pogonatos) to Emperor Taizong, bearing gifts such as red glass and green gemstones. These histories also provided cursory descriptions of Constantinople and its walls, as well as how it was besieged by &quot;Da shi&quot; (; the Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate) and their commander &quot;Mo-yi&quot; (; i.e. Muawiyah I, governor of Syria before becoming caliph), who forced the Byzantines to pay tribute. Henry Yule highlights the fact that Yazdegerd III (r. 632–651), last ruler of the Sasanian Empire, sent diplomats to China for securing aid from Emperor Taizong (considered the suzerain over Ferghana in Central Asia) during the loss of the Persian heartland to the Islamic Rashidun Caliphate, which may have also prompted the Byzantines to send envoys to China amid their recent loss of Syria to the Muslims. Tang Chinese sources also recorded how Sassanid prince Peroz III (636–679) fled to Tang China following the conquest of Persia by the growing Islamic caliphate.

The expansion of China&#x27;s power into Central Asia under Emperor Taizong seems to have been noticed in the West. Theophylact Simocatta, a Byzantine Greek historian during the reign of Heraclius (r. 610–641), wrote that &quot;Taugast&quot; (or &quot;Taugas&quot;; Old Turkic: &quot;Tabghach&quot;, from Tuoba, the Xianbei clan of Northern Wei), was a great eastern empire in the Far East that ruled over Turkic people, with a capital city roughly 1,500 miles northeast from India that he called &quot;Khubdan&quot; (from the Turkic word &quot;Khumdan&quot;, meaning, Chang&#x27;an), where idolatry was practiced but the people were wise and lived by just laws. He depicted the Chinese empire as being divided by a great river (i.e. the Yangzi) that served as the boundary between two rival states at war, yet during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Maurice (582–602 AD) the northerners wearing &quot;black coats&quot; conquered the &quot;red coats&quot; of the south (black being a distinctive color worn by the people of Shaanxi, location of the Sui capital Sui Chang&#x27;an, according to the 16th-century Persian traveler Hajji Mahomed, or Chaggi Memet). This account may correspond to the conquest of the Chen dynasty and reunification of China by Emperor Wen of Sui (r. 581–604). Simocatta names their ruler as &quot;Taisson&quot;, which he claimed meant Son of God, either correlating to the Chinese &quot;Tianzi&quot; (i.e. Son of Heaven) or even the name of the contemporary ruler Emperor Taizong.

====Succession dispute====
Also in 643, Emperor Taizong would see major turmoil among his own closest family. In spring 643, his son Li You () the Prince of Qi, angry over restrictions that his secretary general Quan Wanji () had often placed on him, killed Quan and declared a rebellion. Emperor Taizong sent Li Shiji against Li You, but before Li Shiji could engage Li You, Li You was captured by his own subordinate Du Xingmin () and delivered to Chang&#x27;an, where Emperor Taizong ordered him to commit suicide and executed 44 of his associates.

The death of Li You drew out news of another plot. Li Chengqian, who had been fearful that Emperor Taizong would eventually remove him and replace him with Li Tai, had begun to conspire with Hou Junji, Li Yuanchang () the Prince of Han (Emperor Taizong&#x27;s brother), the general Li Anyan (), and his brothers-in-law Zhao Jie () and Du He (, Du Ruhui&#x27;s son) to overthrow Emperor Taizong. During the investigations in the aftermaths of Li You&#x27;s rebellion, one of the co-conspirators, Li Chengqian&#x27;s guard Gegan Chengji (), was implicated by association, and in order to save himself, he revealed Li Chengqian&#x27;s plot. Emperor Taizong was shocked by the news, and he appointed Zhangsun Wuji, Fang Xuanling, Xiao Yu, and Li Shiji, along with the officials in charge of the supreme court and the legislative and examination bureaus of the government to carry out a joint investigation. At the suggestion of the mid-level official Lai Ji, Emperor Taizong deposed, but did not kill, Li Chengqian, while ordering Li Yuanchang to commit suicide and executing Hou Junji, Li Anyan, Zhao, and Du.

Taizong&#x27;s eldest son Li Chengqian chose to speak Turkic, dress in Turkic clothes and even set up a tent in his residence in imitation of a Turkic khan. Taizong removed him from the position of heir apparent and chose as his successor Li Zhi, who embraced Han Chinese cultural heritage.

After Li Chengqian was deposed, Emperor Taizong briefly promised Li Tai that he would be made crown prince. However, as the investigations continued, Emperor Taizong came to the belief that Li Chengqian&#x27;s downfall was driven by Li Tai&#x27;s machinations, and therefore resolved to depose Li Tai as well. At Zhangsun&#x27;s suggestion, Emperor Taizong created a younger son, Li Zhi the Prince of Jin (who, like Li Chengqian and Li Tai, were born of Empress Zhangsun), crown prince, who was considered kinder and gentler, while exiling Li Chengqian and Li Tai. However, starting later that year, Emperor Taizong began to doubt whether Li Zhi&#x27;s personality was sufficiently strong to serve as emperor, and he toyed with the idea of making another son, Li Ke the Prince of Wu, a son of his concubine Consort Yang (Emperor Yang of Sui&#x27;s daughter), crown prince, but did not do so due to strong opposition by Zhangsun Wuji.

Meanwhile, coming to the belief that he made an ill-advised promise to Yinan to give him Princess Xinxing in marriage, Emperor Taizong demanded a large amount of bride price – 50,000 horses, 10,000 cows and camels, and 100,000 sheep—a price that Yinan agreed to, but could not immediately collect and deliver. Emperor Taizong used it as an excuse to cancel the marriage agreement. Meanwhile, as Wei Zheng had, prior to his death, recommended Hou Junji and Li Chengqian&#x27;s staff member Du Zhenglun as chancellors, Emperor Taizong came to suspect that Wei was part of the plot as well. He destroyed the monument he had authored for Wei and cancelled the betrothal between Wei Shuyu and Princess Hengshan.

====Campaign against the Karasahr====

In 644, with Yanqi&#x27;s king Long Tuqizhi (), who had assisted the Tang campaign to conquer Gaochang, turning against Tang and allying with the Western Turks, Emperor Taizong sent the general Guo Xiaoke (), the commandant at Anxi (, i.e., Gaochang) to launch a surprise attack on Yanqi. Guo caught Long Tuqizhi by surprise and captured him, making his brother Long Lipozhun () regent. (The Western Turkic viceroy Ashina Quli () subsequently captured Long Lipozhun and briefly occupied Yanqi, although he then, not wanting a direct confrontation with Tang, withdrew, and the Yanqi nobles made Long Tuqizhi&#x27;s cousin Long Xuepoanazhi () king.)

====Goguryeo-Tang War====
Also in 644, with Goguryeo attacking Silla and Silla requesting aid, Emperor Taizong decided to prepare for a campaign to conquer Goguryeo. He arrested the emissaries that Yeon sent to the Tang court, accusing them of disloyalty to King Yeongnyu. By winter 644, the mobilization was in full force. (Apparently because of Tang&#x27;s preparation to attack Goguryeo, however, the reconstituted Eastern Turkic people, fearing an attack from Xueyantuo at a time that Tang would be ill-equipped to assist, panicked and abandoned their khan Li Simo, fleeing into Tang territory. Emperor Taizong reabsorbed the Eastern Turks into Tang, while making Li Simo a general in his army.)

In spring 645, Emperor Taizong departed from Luoyang and led the troops northeast, behind a vanguard of 60,000 commanded by Li Shiji and Li Daozong. At the same time, Zhang Liang led the other 40,000 from sea. By summer 645, Tang forces had captured Yodong Fortress (, in modern Liaoyang, Liaoning), and headed southeast toward the Goguryeo capital Pyongyang. Emperor Taizong personally led about 30,000 Tang and tribal forces and defeated a 150,000 force commanded by two Gogureyo generals and then put Ansi (, in modern Anshan, Liaoning) fortress under siege.

However, the capable defense put up by Ansi&#x27;s commanding general stymied Tang forces and, in late fall, after suffering some casualties, with winter fast approaching and his food supplies running out, Emperor Taizong withdrew. He much regretted launching the campaign and made the comment, &quot;If Wei Zheng were still alive, he would never have let me launch this campaign.&quot; He reerected the monument he authored for Wei and summoned Wei&#x27;s wife and children to meet him, treating them well.

====Campaign against Xueyantuo and conquest of the Kucha====

Meanwhile, in the aftermaths of the Goguryeo campaign, Xueyantuo&#x27;s Duomi Khan Bazhuo (son of Yinan, who had died earlier in 645) launched attacks against Tang&#x27;s border prefectures, with largely inconclusive results. In spring 646, the Tang generals Qiao Shiwang () and Zhishi Sili counterattacked, defeating Bazhuo&#x27;s forces, causing him to flee. His vassals Huige, Pugu (), and Tongluo () tribes took the opportunity to rebel and attack him. Hearing this, Emperor Taizong launched a major attack, commanded by Li Daozong, Ashina She&#x27;er (), Zhishi Sili, Qibi Heli, Xue Wanche, and Zhang Jian, against Xueyantuo. With Xueyantuo under attack from multiple sides, Bazhuo was killed by Huige forces, and the remaining Xueyantuo people fled and supported Bazhuo&#x27;s cousin Duomozhi as Yitewushi Khan, but soon offered to submit to Tang. Emperor Taizong sent Li Shiji toward Duomozhi&#x27;s location, with the direction to either accept his submission or destroy him. Duomozhi surrendered and was taken to Chang&#x27;an, ending Xueyantuo&#x27;s rule over the region. The other tribes formerly submissive to Xueyantuo offered Emperor Taizong the title of &quot;Heavenly Khan&quot; and thereafter largely became submissive to Tang. Tang nominally established seven command posts and six prefectures over the region. (Huige&#x27;s khan Yaoluoge Tumidu (), while submissive to Tang, for some time tried to take control over the region himself, but was subsequently assassinated in 648, and there would be no other organized attempt by Huige to take over the region until for about another century.)
After the victory over Xueyantuo, Emperor Taizong again turned his attention toward to Goguryeo, cutting off relations once more and considering another campaign. Under suggestions by some of his officials, he decided to launch harassment campaigns against Goguryeo&#x27;s northern region on a yearly basis, to weaken Goguryeo gradually. The first of these campaigns was launched in spring 647, with Li Shiji and Niu Jinda in command, and would reoccur. All this was in preparation of another campaign in 649 with forces totaling 300,000, but Taizong died before this campaign and the campaign was stalled into Gaozong&#x27;s reign.

In 648, Emperor Taizong launched another campaign, commanded by Ashina She&#x27;er, aimed at Qiuzi, but first attacking Yanqi and killing Long Xuepoanazhi and replacing him with his cousin Long Xiannazhun (). Ashina She&#x27;er advanced on Qiuzi and captured its king Bai Helibushibi (), making his brother king instead.

==Death==
By summer of 649, Emperor Taizong was seriously ill—with some believing that his illness was caused by the medicine he was administered by Buddhists or his taking of pills given to him by alchemists. Believing Li Shiji to be capable but fearing that he would not be submissive to Li Zhi, he demoted Li Shiji out of the capital to be the commandant at remote Die Prefecture (, roughly modern Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu), with instructions to Li Zhi that if Li Shiji hesitated, to execute him immediately, and if he did not, to recall him after Emperor Taizong&#x27;s death and make him chancellor. Li Shiji, when receiving the order and realizing that his life was at stake, immediately departed for Die Prefecture. (After Emperor Taizong&#x27;s death, Li Zhi would indeed recall Li Shiji and make him chancellor.) Soon thereafter, Emperor Taizong, after entrusting Li Zhi to Zhangsun Wuji and Chu Suiliang, died at his summer palace Cuiwei Palace (). His death was initially kept a secret, and three days later, after his casket had been returned to Chang&#x27;an, his death was announced, and Li Zhi took the throne as Emperor Gaozong.

== Religious views ==
Emperor Taizong stated he believed in the Tao, although his vision of it was a greatly syncretized version. He believed in Jesus as a Taoist hero and Confucian sage, and incorporated elements of Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Islam, Syriac Christianity (as well as the Church of the East, which was a major institution in that branch of Christianity), and other Middle Eastern religions in his personal religion that was enforced by laws that demanded his subjects practice tolerance.

==Monuments==
After consolidating the Tang Empire, Emperor Taizong ordered six large stone panels, known as Zhaoling Liujun (), to be carved with the portraits of his favorite horses. These were the horses he had ridden in overcoming his rivals and securing the borders of the country. 
Emperor Taizong further composed laudatory poems for each of the six horses depicted in the stone reliefs. Constructed between 636 and 649 CE, the stone reliefs &quot;exemplify the beauty of early Tang sculpture; the images are realistic yet powerful, created with simplicity and matured craftsmanship.&quot;

After Taizong&#x27;s death, the monuments were situated along the east and west sides of the &quot;spirit path&quot; at the North Gate of the tomb complex named Zhaoling or Zhao Mausoleum. The six stone horse reliefs remained at the Mausoleum until the early twentieth century, when four were removed to the Beilin Museum in Xi&#x27;an, China and two were sold and subsequently donated to the Penn Museum in Philadelphia in 1921.

<text>Johann Kaspar (or Caspar) Lavater (; 15 November 1741 – 2 January 1801) was a Swiss poet, writer, philosopher, physiognomist and theologian.

==Early life==
Lavater was born in Zürich, and was educated at the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; there, where J. J. Bodmer and J. J. Breitinger were amongst his teachers.

==Corruption fighter==
At barely twenty-one years of age, Lavater greatly distinguished himself by denouncing, in conjunction with his friend Henry Fuseli the painter, an iniquitous magistrate, who was compelled to make restitution of his ill-gotten gains.

==Zwinglian==
In 1769 Lavater took Holy Orders in Zurich&#x27;s Zwinglian Church, and officiated until his death as deacon or pastor in churches in his native city. His oratorical fervor and genuine depth of conviction gave him great personal influence; he was extensively consulted as a casuist, and was welcomed with enthusiasm on his journeys throughout Germany. His writings on mysticism were widely popular as well.

In the same year (1769), Lavater tried to convert Moses Mendelssohn to Christianity, by sending him a translation of Charles Bonnet&#x27;s &quot;Palingénésie philosophique&quot;, and demanding that he either publicly refute Bonnet&#x27;s arguments or convert. Mendelssohn refused to do either, and many prominent intellectuals took Mendelssohn&#x27;s side, including Lichtenberg and Herder.

==Physiognomy==
Lavater is most well known for his work in the field of physiognomy, &quot;Physiognomische Fragmente zur Beförderung der Menschenkenntnis und Menschenliebe&quot;, published between 1775 and 1778. He introduced the idea that physiognomy related to the specific character traits of individuals, rather than general types.

Lavater is attributed with catalysing a golden age for silhouettes through this work in physiognomy. According to him, the character of a person could be elucidated through examining their “lines of countenance”. The most accurate of readings were facilitated by the tracing of a profile outline portrait. This contour line could be filled with black or cut from the white paper and placed over a black backing. More often, the silhouette was simply cut from black paper. In the chapter “On Shades”, Lavater wrote, “What can less the image of a living man be than a shade? Yet how full of speech! Little gold, but the purest.&quot;

The fame of this book, which found admirers in France and England as well as Germany, rested largely upon the handsome style of publication and the accompanying illustrations.

The two principal sources from which Lavater developed his physiognomical studies were the writings of the Italian polymath Giambattista della Porta, and the observations made by Sir Thomas Browne in his &quot;Religio Medici&quot; (translated into German in 1748 and praised by Lavater).

Lavater&#x27;s studies have also been related to Franz Xaver Messerschmidt&#x27;s work as a sculptor. His work being mentioned by Ernst Gombrich described as a physiognomical fallacy.

==Poet==

As a poet, Lavater published &quot;Christliche Lieder&quot; (1776–1780) and two epics, &quot;Jesus Messias&quot; (1780) and &quot;Joseph von Arimathia&quot; (1794), in the style of Klopstock. More relevant to the religious temperament of Lavater&#x27;s times are his introspective &quot;Aussichten in die Ewigkeit&quot; (4 volumes 1768-1778), &quot;Geheimes Tagebuch von einem Beobachter seiner selbst&quot; (2 volumes, 1772–1773), and &quot;Pontius Pilatus, oder der Mensch in allen Gestalten&quot; (4 volumes, 1782–1785).

==Goethe==
From 1774 on, Goethe was intimately acquainted with Lavater, but later had a falling out with him, accusing him of superstition and hypocrisy.

==Blake==
In 1788 William Blake annotated Lavater&#x27;s &quot;Aphorisms of Man&quot;. Lavater published 632 aphorisms in all. Blake considered the following aphorism to be an excellent example of an aphorism. &quot;40. Who, under pressing temptations to lie, adheres to truth, nor to the profane betrays aught of a sacred trust, is near the summit of wisdom and virtue.&quot;

==Last days==
During his later years, Lavater&#x27;s influence waned, and he incurred considerable ridicule due to his vanity. His conduct during the French occupation of Switzerland brought about his death. On the taking of Zürich by the French in 1799, Lavater, while trying to appease the aggressors, was shot by an infuriated grenadier; he died over a year later.

The Swiss artist and illustrator, Warja Honegger-Lavater, was a direct descendant of Johann Kaspar Lavater.

<doc id="207995" wikidata="Q2121419" url="?curid=207995" title="The NewZealand Story">
<text>is a platform game developed and released in arcades by Taito in 1988. The concept and setting were inspired by a holiday trip in New Zealand by one of the Taito programmers. The player controls , a kiwi who must save his girlfriend and several of his other kiwi chick friends who have been kidnapped by a large blue leopard seal. While avoiding enemies, the player has to navigate a scrolling maze-like level, at the end of which they release one of Tiki&#x27;s kiwi chick friends trapped in a cage. In 2007, the arcade game received a remake for the Nintendo DS under the title &quot;New Zealand Story Revolution&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The goal of each level is to safely get Tiki through the level, avoiding enemies, fire, and spikes (Tiki dies in one hit), and rescue one of his kiwi friends at the end. The weaponry starts out as an endless supply of arrows, but pickups can change these into bombs, lasers or bouncing fireballs. These act a little differently, and what is useful depends upon the player&#x27;s location. A distinctive feature of this game is the ability to ride a variety of flying vehicles, including balloons, blimps and UFOs. Vehicles can be found ready for use or can be stolen from an enemy.

The levels Tiki has to explore are quite expansive. Instead of single screen levels, they scroll along with the player and extend in all directions, encouraging the player to explore and navigate to find the exit and the many secrets hidden about the maze. On the lower left corner of the screen, there is a mini-map which shows Tiki&#x27;s position and the location of his caged kiwi friend, which is also the exit of each stage. Often, the vast size of the stages requires that Tiki get some means of transportation, often from enemies, to explore the stage and reach the exit. Though Tiki dies by enemies&#x27; weapons and projectiles, he is not harmed by them directly.

The game features four main zones, each with four rounds, the fourth round featuring a boss fight at the end. Other features include the many secret areas and shortcuts hidden throughout the game, accessed using special hidden &quot;warp&quot; portals. On certain later levels, if the player loses their last life due to being killed by a projectile weapon, they will be sent up to a special &quot;Heaven&quot; round. Here, they can either receive a special ending or find the secret route out of Heaven and continue playing the game.

Each stage has an invisible time limit in which the player should take to reach the exit. If the player takes too long to find it, a jingle will play, accompanied by a &quot;Hurry Up!&quot; message. If enough time passes after the warning, an invincible little red devil will appear onscreen to chase down Tiki and kill him instantly if it catches up to him.

The game shares several elements with previous Taito games (such as collecting letters to spell out &quot;EXTEND&quot;, from &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot;).

==Ports==
After the release of the original arcade game in 1988, the game was converted to most of the game consoles and home computers of the time. Most home releases came in 1989, with some arriving later through 1990–1992. The home computer versions were published by Ocean Software, and their home computer versions refer to Wally as a walrus on the packaging, but the original arcade version specifically mentions him as being a leopard seal during the closing credits. The NES version was developed by Software Creations and published in the PAL regions by Ocean. In North America the NES version was published by Taito as Kiwi Kraze. The game was included in the Amiga 500 Batman Pack, which was launched in September 1989 and sold over 2 million units. Home conversions generally received good reviews in video game magazines. The game was also converted for the Japanese FM Towns and X68000 systems, providing arcade-perfect conversions, but released exclusively in Japan since both computers were only available there.

The Mega Drive version (again, only released in Japan) had its levels based on the prototype version of the arcade game.

The &quot;Taito Legends&quot; pack includes an emulated version of the original arcade version of &quot;The NewZealand Story&quot;, allowing it to be played on the Xbox, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and any PC. In October 2008, the PC-Engine version was released for the Wii Virtual Console in Japan.

Tiki the Kiwi also made some cameo appearances in other Taito games such as &quot;Liquid Kids&quot;, &quot;Bubble Symphony&quot; and (along with his lover Phee Phee) &quot;Pop&#x27;n Pop&quot;.

The arcade version was released on the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch in January 2023 as part of Hamster&#x27;s &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; series.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;The NewZealand Story&quot; on their November 15, 1988 issue as being the ninth most-successful table arcade unit of the month. In Europe, the arcade game received positive reviews from &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; and &quot;The Games Machine&quot;.

The ZX Spectrum conversion of &quot;The NewZealand Story&quot;, published by Ocean in 1989, achieved critical success. &quot;CRASH&quot; awarded 91%, &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; 93%, and &quot;Sinclair User&quot; 82%. On the conversion from arcade to an 8-bit platform, &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; accepted the &quot;disappointing&quot; monochrome display for the sake of smoother play. CRASH commented on the accuracy of the character graphics and animation describing it as &quot;an arcade conversion masterpiece&quot;, but found the multi-load cassette version to be awkward. The gameplay was deemed &quot;addictive&quot;, with the variety of weapons and modes of transport being particular highlights. By November, &quot;The NewZealand Story&quot; was number 2 in the Spectrum full-price games chart. The Spectrum version was voted number 34 in the &quot;Your Sinclair Readers&#x27; Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;. The game was ranked the 19th best game of all time by &quot;Amiga Power&quot;. &quot;Mega&quot; placed the game at #40 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.

The Nintendo DS remake &quot;Revolution&quot; received average critical reception. &quot;IGN&quot; awarded &quot;Revolution&quot; a &quot;mediocre&quot; score of 5.9, and &quot;Eurogamer&quot; gave 6/10. While reviews highlighted the challenging and fun retro gameplay, they criticized the touch-stylus and spot-the-difference events as poorly implemented, and the level design sometimes seen as spiteful.

==Legacy==
In January 2007, Rising Star Games published the Taito-developed Nintendo DS remake titled New Zealand Story Revolution in Australia and in Europe on February 2. In North America, it was published by Ignition Entertainment on February 13. The game was published in Japan by CyberFront as on May 31 of the same year. This version combines the use of both screens for action on the top screen and a map on the bottom screen. During certain instances, the game utilizes the touchscreen, such as opening a door, finding a secret button or flicking Tiki to safety. It also introduces a four-player wireless mode, Normal and Expert game modes, and improved graphics and BGM over the original arcade version. Also, unlike in the original, Tiki can receive multiple hits before losing a life, and can shoot at an angle.

<doc id="208006" wikidata="Q5147243" url="?curid=208006" title="IBM 7040">
<text>The IBM 7040 was a historic but short-lived model of transistor computer built in the 1960s.

==History==
It was announced by IBM in December 1961, but did not ship until April 1963. A later member of the IBM 700/7000 series of scientific computers, it was a scaled-down version of the IBM 7090. It was not fully compatible with the 7090. Some 7090 features, including index registers, character instructions and floating point, were extra-cost options. It also featured a different input/output architecture, based on the IBM 1414 data synchronizer, allowing more modern IBM peripherals to be used. A model designed to be compatible with the 7040 with more performance was announced as the 7044 at the same time.

Peter Fagg headed the development of the 7040 under executive Bob O. Evans.
A number of IBM 7040 and 7044 computers were shipped, but it was eventually made obsolete by the IBM System/360 family, announced in 1964. The schedule delays caused by IBM&#x27;s multiple incompatible architectures provided motivation for the unified System/360 family.

The 7040 proved popular for use at universities, due to its comparatively low price. For example, one was installed in May 1965 at Columbia University. 
One of the first in Canada was at the University of Waterloo, bought by professor J. Wesley Graham. A team of students was frustrated with the slow performance of the Fortran compiler. In the summer of 1965 they wrote the WATFOR compiler for their 7040, which became popular with many newly formed computer science departments.

IBM also offered the 7040 (or 7044) as an input-output processor attached to a 7090, in a configuration known as the 7090/7040 Direct Coupled System (DCS). Each computer was slightly modified to be able to interrupt the other.

IBM used similar numbers for a model of its eServer pSeries 690 RS/6000 architecture much later. The 7040-681, for example, was withdrawn in 2005.

<doc id="208011" wikidata="Q269865" url="?curid=208011" title="Marie Thérèse Geoffrin">
<text>Marie Thérèse Geoffrin (, née Rodet; 26 June 1699 – 6 October 1777) was a French salon holder who has been referred to as one of the leading female figures in the French Enlightenment. From 1750 to 1777, Madame Geoffrin played host to many of the most influential Philosophes and Encyclopédistes of her time. 

Her association with several prominent dignitaries and public figures from across Europe has earned Madame Geoffrin international recognition. Her patronage and dedication to both the philosophical men of letters and talented artists that frequented her house is emblematic of her role as guide and protector. In her salon on the Rue Saint-Honoré, Madame Geoffrin demonstrated qualities of politeness and civility that helped stimulate and regulate intellectual discussion. Her actions as a Parisian salonnière exemplify many of the most important characteristics of Enlightenment sociability.

== Early life ==
Born in 1699, Madame Geoffrin was the first child of a bourgeois named Pierre Rodet, a valet de chambre for the Duchess of Burgundy, and Angélique Thérèse Chemineau, the daughter of a Parisian Banker. Marie Thérèse&#x27;s mother died a year later in giving birth to her son Louis. At age seven, Marie Thérèse and her brother were taken to live with their grandmother Madame Chemineau on the rue Saint-Honoré. At thirteen, she was engaged to be married to the widower Pierre François Geoffrin, a lieutenant-colonel of the National Guard and a prosperous general cashier of the Saint-Gobain Venetian mirror manufactory. Despite the fact that he was forty-nine years old, and Marie Thérèse was barely fourteen years old, Monsieur Geoffrin had inherited a substantial fortune from his first wife, and the chance for &quot;an excellent settlement&quot; was thought to be quite suitable by Madame Chemineau. The marriage took place on 19 July 1713. Nearly two years after the wedding, she gave birth to her first child, a daughter named also Marie Thérèse, and the future Marquise de La Ferté-Imbault. Her second child, a son, (who was to die later in childhood) was born two years later. It was not until Madame Geoffrin was over thirty years old that her connection to the salons would become established. Her husband, Pierre François Geoffrin died 20 December 1749, a fact that was hardly noticed by Mme Geoffrin&#x27;s visitors—indeed, Madame Geoffrin hardly seemed to notice herself.

== Education ==
Geoffrin was unable to receive a formalized education. It has been suggested, most notably by Dena Goodman, that the salon itself acted as a schoolhouse, where Geoffrin and other salonnières could train. Goodman writes, &quot;For Madame Geoffrin, the salon was a socially acceptable substitute for a formal education denied her not just by her grandmother, but more generally by a society that agreed with Madame Chemineau&#x27;s (her grandmother&#x27;s) position.&quot; She also states, &quot;Her earliest schoolmasters were Fontenelle, the abbe de Saint-Pierre, and Montesquieu. Madame de Tencin played a large role in Madame Geoffrin&#x27;s rise in society. Goodman states, &quot;Madame Geoffrin made a daring step for a devout girl when, at the age of eighteen, but already a wife and mother, she began to frequent the afternoon gatherings at the home of Madame de Tencin.&quot; After Madame de Tencin&#x27;s death in December 1749, Madame Geoffrin inherited many of de Tencin&#x27;s former guests, thereby solidifying her own salon.

== Madame Geoffrin and the salons ==

Madame Geoffrin&#x27;s popularity in the mid-eighteenth century came during a time where the center of social life was beginning to move away from the French court and toward the salons of Paris. Instead of the earlier, seventeenth-century salons of the high nobility, Madame Geoffrin&#x27;s salon catered generally to a more philosophical crowd of the Enlightenment period. Goodman, in &quot;Enlightenment Salons,&quot; writes, &quot;In the eighteenth century, under the guidance of Madame Geoffrin, Julie de Lespinasse, and Suzanne Necker, the salon was transformed from a noble, leisure institution into an institution of the Enlightenment.&quot; Goodman writes:
&quot;Geoffrin, who acted as a mentor and model for other salonnières, was responsible for two innovations that set Enlightenment salons apart from their predecessors and from other social and literacy gatherings of the day. She invented the Enlightenment salon. First, she made the one-o&#x27;clock dinner rather than the traditional late-night supper the sociable meal of the day, and thus she opened up the whole afternoon for talk. Second, she regulated these dinners, fixing a specific day of the week for them. After Geoffrin launched her weekly dinners, the Parisian salon took on the form that made it the social base of the Enlightenment Republic of Letters: a regular and regulated formal gathering hosted by a woman in her own home which served as a forum and locus of intellectual activity.&quot;

Her dinners were held twice weekly. Mondays were specifically for artists. Wednesdays were generally reserved for Men of Letters.

Goodman writes, &quot;Enlightenment salons were working spaces, unlike other Eighteenth-century social gatherings, which took place as their model.&quot; She continues, &quot;The Enlightenment was not a game, and the salonnières were not simply ladies of leisure killing time. On the contrary, Enlightenment salonnières were precisely those women who fought the general malaise of the period by taking up their métier.&quot;

== Salons, French society, and the international community ==
Madame Geoffrin&#x27;s role was central to her identity as a French hostess. Historian Denise Yim writes: &quot;The most distinguished salonnières were discerning women who selected their company with care, set the tone, guided the conversation, and could influence the fortunes of those appearing there.&quot; She continues, &quot;The most influential salonnière was perhaps Madame Geoffrin of the rue Saint-Honoré, who managed to attract the largest number of distinguished foreigners to her home.&quot; A lady of great renown, Geoffrin&#x27;s salon catered to a wide range of foreign dignitaries and distinguished guests. &quot;An invitation to the Monday and Wednesday dinners of Madame Geoffrin was an honor greatly coveted by foreigners passing through Paris. The hostess herself had gained a European reputation even before her journey to Poland, and to dine with Madame Geoffrin was by some people considered almost as great an honor as being presented at Versailles.&quot;&quot; Yim continues, &quot;Whether it was Madame Geoffrin&#x27;s design to attract all the most eminent foreigners to her salon, thereby spreading the reputation of her home throughout Europe, as Marmontel wrote, or whether this was the natural consequence of the presence of so many philosophes and Encyclopédistes, it was a fact that no foreign minister, no man or woman of note who arrived in Paris failed to call on Madame Geoffrin in the hope of being invited to one of her select dinners.&quot;

== Salon politeness and gift giving ==
Madame Geoffrin exemplified the qualities of politeness that were required for the participation in French high society. She was completely devoted to the management and organization of her salon, and of the patrons that frequented it. Madame Geoffrin could be defined by the ordered consistency of all her actions. &quot;Regularity was part of a greater sense of organization that defined all aspects of Madame Geoffrin&#x27;s life and every hour of her day, from a 5 a.m. rising, through a morning of domestic duties, letter writing, and errands, to the afternoons she devoted twice a week to her salon.&quot;

Although some historians, such as Dena Goodman, associate Geoffrin and other salonnières with intellectual life, other researchers depict the salons as the realm of anti-intellectual socialites. For example, with no education or remarkable mental gifts of a sort that leave permanent traces, she was the best representative of the women of her time who held their place in the world solely through their skill in organizing and conducting a salon. She was in no sense a luminary; and conscious that she could not shine by her own light, she was bent upon shining by that of others.&quot; Denise Yim adds that &quot;these women considered themselves the purveyors, the disseminators, the nurturers, the very guardians of taste in the belles lettres, in the fine arts, and in the music. Their own peculiar art consisted of pleasing.&quot; &quot;Maintaining the tensions between inner satisfaction and outer negation which made Geoffrin the model salonnière was not easy.&quot;

Antoine Lilti also rejects the notion that Geoffrin and other salonnières &#x27;governed&#x27; an intellectual arena. Lilti focuses, rather, on the salonnières&#x27; practice of politeness and gift giving. In relation to Madame Geoffrin, Lilti writes, &quot;there exists numerous testimonials about the gifts that Madame Geoffrin bestowed upon the writers who regularly attend her salon, from the pieces of the silverware offered to the Suards, the silver pans and 2,000 gold écus presented to Thomas. He continues, &quot;writers were not the only ones to benefit from this generosity. Madame Geoffrin received artists every Monday, securing contracts for them among high society collectors and even commissioned artwork for herself. Madame Geoffrin&#x27;s notebooks mention that these artists also received regular gifts.&quot; For Lilti, Geoffrin&#x27;s gift giving was nothing more than a reaffirmation of social inequities. He states, &quot;the exchange of gifts, of course, was a common practice in all areas of high society, but it took on a particular social signification in the case of gifts given to men of letters, since the absence of reciprocity rendered the relationship asymmetrical. It was more about simply reinforcing a social bond through gift-giving, as it was for the socialites who exchanged little gifts with each other, but instead made a financial relationship part of urbane sociability––especially when the rapport became more or less permanent in the form of allowances, such as the ones that Madame Geoffrin bestowed upon d&#x27;Alembert, Thomas, and the abbé Morellet.&quot;

== Continuity in the salons ==
Madame Geoffrin&#x27;s personal acquaintance with many other influential salonnières indicates a type of formalized continuity in the salons. Though it has been argued that women did not appear in salon societies, the training of salonnières was undertaken by older women in the same position. Dena Goodman states, &quot;Indeed, the history of the eighteenth century salon is a history of female apprenticeships, where younger women, such as Madame Geoffrin learned from older women, such as Madame de Tencin, and Julie de Lespinasse and Suzanne Necker learned in turn from Madame Geoffrin.&quot; Therefore, Madame Geoffrin spent many years in the company of Madame de Tencin, herself a highly influential salonnière, and in turn, spent much time cultivating her own protégées, namely Madame Necker and Madame Lespinasse, who would attempt to continue the salon tradition after her death. One woman allowed admission into Madame Geoffrin&#x27;s salon, Madame d&#x27;Etioles, who was to become Madame la Marquise de Pompadour after earning the French King&#x27;s interest, is reputed to have offered Madame Geoffrin and her daughter opportunities to present themselves at the French Court. It was an honor that was refused (on more than one occasion) by the salonnières. Another salonnière, the Marquise du Deffand, can be said to have competed against Madame Geoffrin for the friendship of many prominent men of letters. Aldis writes, &quot;There had always been a kind of tacit rivalry between Madame Geoffrin and the Marquise du Deffand; the aristocratic Marquise sneered at her rival&#x27;s low origin for the business and want of education, while Madame Geoffrin might well have ignored her taunts in the success of her salon, indisputably, the most celebrated in Paris and the civilized world.&quot;Geoffrin&#x27;s relationship with her daughter is one exception to the continuity between women in the salons. Madame de la Ferté-Imbault, upon hearing her mother&#x27;s suggestion to begin her own salon, organized the Order of Lanurelus, a type of counter-salon that acted in opposition to the serious salons of the Philosophes. The Order of Lanurelus (of which de la Ferté-Imbault proclaimed herself Grand Mistress) ran from 1771 until around the time of Geoffrin&#x27;s death in 1777. &quot;It was a forum not for the philosophes and their Republic of Letters, but for the anti-philosophe campaign. Goodman writes, &quot;The battle of the hearts and minds of the elite of the eighteenth century was, for a few years, fought out in a single house on the rue Saint-Honoré!&quot;
== Patron of the arts ==
The debate surrounding Madame Geoffrin as a patron of the arts centers around gender divisions and sociability in eighteenth century France. Geoffrin, considered by many contemporaries to be one of the most influential patrons of art, supported many artists and commissioned several works. Dena Goodman, in what has been criticized as perhaps an idealized feminist theory, suggests, &quot;The salonnière&#x27;s art...allowed her to manage the egos of others (males) without imposing her own upon them.&quot; In relation to her (possible) conception and patronage of the highly regarded historical artist Carle Van Loo&#x27;s painting, &quot;Une Conversation&quot; the historian Emma Barker writes, &quot;most recent commentators have agreed in locating the interest and significance of these works in their having been commissioned by an exceptional female patron, the hostess of a celebrated Parisian salon whose guests included some of the leading figures of the French Enlightenment.&quot; Barker argues that the Conversation may be seen to represent a self-consciously feminocentric vision of history.&quot; Dena Goodman, in her &quot;Republic of Letters&quot;, claims that, &quot;the paintings embody the serious spirit of Geoffrin&#x27;s salon and observes that they depict two activities that dominated salon sociability: conversation and reading out loud.&quot; Madame Geoffrin as patron of the arts is also emblematic of a more international connection. Her correspondence with both Catherine the Great of Russia and King Stanislaw August of Poland, as well as several other dignitaries and heads of state often centered around the commission of several paintings that were often hung in her salon. On the relationship between Geoffrin and Stanislaw, the academic Maria Gordon-Smith writes, &quot;The King knew Madame Geoffrin in Paris from his youthful days on the grand tour in 1753, when he was entrusted to her care by her father. After his election, Madame Geoffrin became his adviser and agent in all matters connected with the choice and purchase of French Art.&quot;

== Conception ==
In her relationship to salons, Madame Geoffrin occupies a very contentious space in Enlightenment historiography. On the broadest level of representation, Madame Geoffrin stands as one of only a handful of women to participate in the Enlightenment. &quot;The salonnières of the Enlightenment were a small number of women who knew and admired one another, lived lives of regularity rather than dissipation, and were committed both to their own education and the philosophes&#x27; project of Enlightenment.&quot; Dena Goodman&#x27;s notion of the centrality of the salonnières in creating Enlightenment institutions places Madame Geoffrin at the heart of the Enlightenment sociability. She writes, &quot;Under the guidance of Marie-Therese Geoffrin, Julie de Lespinasse and Suzanne Necker, Parisian salons became the civil working spaces of the project of Enlightenment.&quot; Goodman uses Geoffrin to argue that salonnières in the eighteenth century represented a re-shaping of an existing form of sociability that would serve the ambitions of the women who ran them. Goodman states, &quot;In using the social gathering and transforming it to meet their own needs, Madame Geoffrin and salonnières like her created a certain kind of social and intellectual space that could be exploited by the expanding group of intellectuals who were beginning to call themselves &quot;philosophers.&quot; The historian Denise Yim loosely agrees with Goodman on the idea that salonnières did use their position for a more serious educational purpose. She writes, &quot;It is evident, although they do not say so themselves, that Julie de Lespinasse, Madame Geoffrin and Madame Vigee-Lebrun also improved themselves in their own salons.

This representation has been debased by much of the recent literature. Janet Burke and Margaret Jacob write that by placing only, &quot;a handful of selfless salonnières (such as Geoffrin) at the centre of Enlightenment history, Goodman is effectively obliterating a wider version of the Enlightenment cultural practices as well as downgrading &quot;all other seemingly enlightened woman.&quot; Antoine Lilti, in countering many of Goodman&#x27;s arguments, would debase the idea that Madame Geoffrin acted as a participant in the new sociability of Enlightenment society. Instead he claims that the politeness and gift giving would have been unthinkable without the presences of fashionable men of letters, which attracted to her salon the finest representatives of the Parisian and European aristocracy, and which permitted her to appear as a protector of talents and an accomplished socialite.&quot;

The historian Steven Kale discounts the entire theory that Madame Geoffrin (and salonnières in general) played a significant role in the Enlightenment. Kale examines the differences in the roles of men and women in the public sphere before and after 1789. He states, &quot;There is no reason to contradict the widely held view that the salon was a feminist space insofar as it was more often than not presided over by a woman who gave it tone and structure.&quot; However, he states, &quot;But it is one thing to say that the presence of a woman is a distinguishing feature of salons and another to argue that female dominance set them apart from other institutions of elite sociability.&quot; He adamantly believes that, &quot;Salonnières generally exercised no political power outside their role in the formation of public opinion, and salons were not centers of political intrigue. Kale states, &quot;Salonnières were engaged in a common social practice, the goal of which was not to achieve for women a role in public affairs but to serve the public needs of men, whether intellectuals or politicians, who had the power to determine the limits of women&#x27;s public participation.&quot; Kale rejects the notion that Geoffrin held any semblance of power; his argument debases the long-held idea that the female-run salons were, &quot;institutions of democratic sociability.&quot; Instead, he bases much of his critics of earlier historians on the idea that salonnières such as Madame Geoffrin reaffirmed the aristocratic institutions of the Old Regime. He writes, &quot;The genius of salons, and of salonnières, lay in their ability to maintain a delicate balance between exclusivity and openness, between &quot;inclusions and exclusions&quot;, so that the aristocracy could have both a means of producing social cohesion and a vehicle for the dissemination of traits meant to characterize a wider society of elites undergoing redefinition.&quot; Therefore, Kale visualizes Geoffrin&#x27;s salon as confirming the aristocratic conception of the social and political conception of the social and political role of women in the Old Regime.

<text>, trading as , or simply Fuji, is a Japanese multinational conglomerate headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, operating in the areas of photography, optics, office and medical electronics, biotechnology, and chemicals.

The company started as a manufacturer of photographic films, which it still produces. Fujifilm products include document solutions, medical imaging and diagnostics equipment, cosmetics, pharmaceutical drugs, regenerative medicine, stem cells, biologics manufacturing, magnetic tape data storage, optical films for flat-panel displays, optical devices, photocopiers, printers, digital cameras, color films, color paper, photofinishing and graphic arts equipment and materials.

Fujifilm is part of the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group financial conglomerate (&quot;keiretsu&quot;).

== History ==

===20th century===

Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. was established in 1934 as a subsidiary of Daicel producing photographic films. In the 1940s, Fuji Photo entered the optical glasses, lenses and equipment markets. In 1962, Fuji Photo and UK-based Rank Xerox Limited (now Xerox Limited) launched Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd. through a joint venture.

From the mid-1950s, Fuji Photo began establishing overseas sales bases. In the 1980s, the company expanded its production and other operations internationally. During this period, Fuji Photo developed digital technologies for its photography, medical, and printing sectors. This led to the invention of computed radiography (CR), which addressed several problems associated with traditional radiography, including reducing radiation exposure for both technicians and patients. Fujifilm&#x27;s systems were marketed and sold under the FCR brand.

Like its rival Eastman Kodak which dominated in the US, Fuji Photo enjoyed a longtime near-monopoly on camera film in Japan. Fuji increased market share in the US by becoming one of the title sponsors of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, offering cheaper camera film, and establishing a film factory in the US.

In 1994 vice president Juntarō Suzuki announced that the company would halt paying sōkaiya, a type of protection racket bribe, to Yakuza. In retaliation he was murdered in front of his home by Yakuza. In May 1995, Kodak filed a petition with the US Commerce Department under section 301 of the Commerce Act arguing that its poor performance in the Japanese market was a direct result of unfair practices adopted by Fuji. The complaint was lodged by the US with the World Trade Organization. On January 30, 1998, the WTO announced a &quot;sweeping rejection of Kodak&#x27;s complaints&quot; about the film market in Japan.

===21st century===
In March 2006, Noritsu and Fuji announced a strategic alliance for Noritsu to manufacture all of Fuji&#x27;s photofinishing hardware, such as mini labs. Each company produces its own software for the mini labs.

On September 19, 2006, Fujifilm announced plans to establish a holding company, Fujifilm Holdings Corp. Fujifilm and Fuji Xerox would become subsidiaries of the holding company. A representative of the company reconfirmed its commitment to film, which accounts for 3% of sales.

On January 31, 2018, Fujifilm announced that it would acquire a 50.1% controlling stake in Xerox for US$6.1 billion, which will be amalgamated into its existing Fuji Xerox business. The deal was subsequently dropped after intervention by activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason. In late 2019, Fujifilm announced its acquisition of Xerox&#x27;s 25% stake in the 57-year-old joint venture, Fuji Xerox.

In December 2019, Fujifilm acquired Hitachi&#x27;s diagnostic imaging business for US$1.63 billion.

Amid the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, one of Fujifilm Toyama Chemical drugs, i.e. favipiravir, an antiviral commercially named Avigan, is being considered as a possible treatment for the virus, after having been approved by China, Russia, and Indonesia authorities by June 2020.

In June 2020, Fujifilm announced a US$928 million investment to a Denmark-based biologics production facility, which it acquired from Biogen a year earlier for around US$890 million, to double the manufacturing capacity. A tape cartridge using strontium ferrite that could store up to 400TB was showcased by Fujifilm in the late same month.

==Subsidiaries==
Fuji Xerox was a joint venture between Fujifilm and Xerox Corporation of North America. After the dissolution of their partnership in 2019, Fujifilm made it a wholly owned subsidiary. In January 2020, the corporate name change was announced, from Fuji Xerox to Fujifilm Business Innovation Corporation, effective on April 1, 2021.

Fujifilm bought Sericol Ltd., a UK-based printing ink company specializing in screen, narrow web, and digital print technologies in March 2005.

Fujifilm de México is a Fujifilm subsidiary in Mexico that sells Fujifilm products since 1934 and has been recognized as one of The Best Mexican Companies (Las Mejores Empresas Mexicanas) from 2012 to 2015, a recognition promoted by Banamex, Deloitte México and Tecnológico de Monterrey.

Fujifilm is active in pharmaceutical products and contract manufacturing through its subsidiaries including Fujifilm Toyama Chemical, Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies, etc.

As of July 2020, the Fuji film Group has two operating companies, which encompass more than 300 subsidiaries in total, and three &quot;shared services companies&quot; under the umbrella. The group structure and a list of some Fuji film subsidiaries are the following:

<text>Plínio Salgado (; January 22, 1895 – December 8, 1975) was a Brazilian politician, writer, journalist, and theologian. He founded and led Brazilian Integralist Action, a political party inspired by the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini.

Initially a supporter of the dictatorship led by Getúlio Vargas, he was later persecuted and exiled in Portugal for promoting an uprising against the government. After his return, he launched the Popular Representation Party, and was elected to represent Paraná in the Chamber of Deputies in 1958, being re-elected in 1962, this time to represent São Paulo. He was also a candidate in the 1955 presidential election, securing 8.28% of the votes. After the 1964 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, which led to the extinction of political parties, he joined the National Renewal Alliance, obtaining two terms in the Chamber of Deputies. He retired from politics in 1974, just a year before his death.

==Early life==
Born in the small conservative town of São Bento do Sapucaí in the São Paulo state, Plínio Salgado was the son of Colonel Francisco das Chagas Salgado, a local political leader, and Ana Francisca Rennó Cortez, a teacher. A very active child at school, he had special interest for mathematics and geometry. After the loss of his father, at the age of 16, which is said to have made him a bitter young man, his interests shifted towards psychology and philosophy.

At the age of 20, Salgado founded and directed the weekly newspaper &quot;Correio de São Bento&quot;. In 1918, he began his political life by taking part in the foundation of a party called &quot;Partido Municipalista&quot;. This party congregated town leaders from municipalities in the Paraíba Valley region, and advocated municipal autonomy.

Also in that year, Salgado married Maria Amélia Pereira, and on July 6, 1919, his only daughter Maria Amélia Salgado was born. Fifteen days after giving birth to the couple&#x27;s daughter, Salgado&#x27;s wife, Maria Amélia died. Filled with sorrow, Plínio left his original study of materialist philosophers, and found comfort in the Roman Catholic theology, and began to study the works of Brazilian Catholic thinkers, such as Raimundo Farias Brito and Jackson Figueiredo. The death of his wife had a great impact on the course of Salgado&#x27;s life. He would only marry again 17 years later, to Carmela Patti.

Through his articles in &quot;Correio de São Bento&quot;, Salgado became known by fellow journalists in São Paulo, and in 1920 was invited to work there in &quot;Correio Paulistano&quot;, the official newspaper of the Republican Party of São Paulo, where he became a friend of poet Menotti del Picchia. He was a prominent participant in the Modern Art Week in 1922, leading the &quot;Nationalists&quot;, who wanted no foreign influences and sought a &quot;purely Brazilian&quot; form of art, against the &quot;Anthropophagics&quot;, who synthesized a new art from foreign influences.

He published his first novel, &quot;The Stranger&quot; in 1926. After that, alongside Cassiano Ricardo, del Picchia and Cândido Mota Filho, he launched the &quot;Green-Yellow movement&quot;, a nationalistic group inside Modernist movement. The following year, also alongside del Picchia and Ricardo, Salgado launched the &quot;Anta movement&quot;, which exalted the indigenous peoples, particularly the Tupi, as the true carriers of the Brazilian identity.

That same year, he published his book &quot;Literature and Politics&quot;, in which he defended nationalistic ideas with a strong anti-liberal and pro-latifundia stance, inspired by Alberto Torres and Oliveira Viana. His shift to far right-wing politics led Ricardo to launch the &quot;Flag movement&quot;, a social-democratic breakaway from the &quot;Green-Yellow&quot; and &quot;Anta&quot; movements.

==Integralism==
In 1930, Salgado supported the presidential candidacy of Júlio Prestes against Getúlio Vargas. At that time, during a trip to Europe, he became impressed with Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist movement in Italy. After his return to Brazil, on October 4, 1930, a day after the beginning of the 1930 Revolution which deposed President Washington Luís, Salgado wrote two articles in &quot;Correio Paulistano&quot; defending Luís&#x27;s administration. Nevertheless, with the victory of the revolutionaries, he began to support the Vargas regime.

In the newspaper &quot;A Razão&quot;, founded by Alfredo Egidio de Souza Aranha, Salgado developed an intense campaign against the constitutionalization of Brazil. As such, he drew the ire of anti-dictatorship activists, who burned down the newspaper&#x27;s office just before the outbreak of the Constitutionalist Revolution.

At the height of the Vargas dictatorship, Salgado created the Society for Political Studies, which gathered together intellectuals sympathetic to Fascism. Months later, he released the &quot;October Manifesto&quot;, which provided the guidelines of a new political party, the Brazilian Integralist Action.

Salgado adapted virtually all Fascist symbols and forms of organization, such as a paramilitary organization with green-shirted uniformed ranks, highly regimented street demonstrations, and aggressive rhetoric, although he publicly rejected racism. The movement was directly financed, in part, by the Italian embassy. The Roman salute was accompanied by the screaming of the Tupi word &quot;Anauê&quot;, which means &quot;you are my brother,&quot; while the Greek letter sigma (Σ) served as the movement&#x27;s official symbol. Even though Salgado himself was never an anti-Semite, many of the party members adopted anti-semitic views.

Integralist Action drew its support from lower middle class Italian immigrants, a large part of the Portuguese community, lower middle class Brazilians, and military officers, especially in the Navy. As the party grew, Vargas turned to Integralism as his only mobilized base of support on the right wing, which was elated by his Fascist-style crackdown against the Brazilian left. In 1934, Salgado&#x27;s movement targeted the Communist Party, then under the leadership of Luiz Carlos Prestes, as an underground party, mobilizing a conservative support base to engage in street brawls and urban terrorism.

On 1937, Salgado launched his presidential candidacy for the general elections scheduled to take place in January 1938. Aware of Vargas&#x27; intention to cancel the election and remain in power, he supported his Estado Novo coup, hoping to make Integralism the doctrinal basis of the new regime, as Vargas had promised him the office of the Minister of Education. The President, however, banned the Integralist party, treating it the same way he had treated other political parties after transforming Brazil into a one-party state.

In 1938, Integralist militants tried twice, in the months of March and May, to promote uprisings against Vargas. Despite denying involvement in the events, Salgado was arrested after the May uprising and was imprisoned in the 17th-century Santa Cruz Fortress in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro. About a month later, he was sent to a six-year exile in Portugal. During that period, he persistently sought to rehabilitate himself with the Brazilian regime, praising it in several manifestos, including its decision to declare war against Germany and Italy.

==Later career==
Salgado returned to Brazil in 1945, with the end of the Estado Novo regime, and then founded the Party of Popular Representation, reformulating the integralist doctrine. Still driven by the ambition of becoming president, Salgado ran for presidency under the banner of his new party in 1955 but finished last, obtaining just 8% of the votes (around 714,000 votes). Then he supported the inauguration of President-elect Juscelino Kubitschek, challenged by the National Democratic Union, and was named to head the National Institute for Immigration and Colonization.

Salgado was elected to represent Paraná in the Chamber of Deputies in 1958. He would be re-elected in 1962, this time to represent the São Paulo state.

In 1964, he was one of the speakers at the March of Family with God for Freedom rally in São Paulo against President João Goulart. Salgado supported the 1964 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; which overthrew Goulart and, with the introduction of the two-party system, he joined the National Renewal Alliance Party, obtaining two terms as a São Paulo deputy.

Salgado died in São Paulo on 9 December 1975, aged 80. He is buried at Morumbi Cemetery.

<text>Laurence Stephen Lowry ( ; 1 November 1887 – 23 February 1976) was an English artist. His drawings and paintings mainly depict Pendlebury, Greater Manchester (where he lived and worked for more than 40 years) as well as Salford and its vicinity.

Lowry painted scenes of life in the industrial districts of North West England in the mid-20th century. He developed a distinctive style of painting and is best known for his urban landscapes peopled with human figures, often referred to as &quot;matchstick men&quot;. He painted mysterious unpopulated landscapes, brooding portraits and the unpublished &quot;marionette&quot; works, which were only found after his death. He was fascinated by the sea, and painted pure seascapes, depicting only sea and sky, from the early 1940s.

His use of stylised figures which cast no shadows, and lack of weather effects in many of his landscapes led critics to label him a naïve &quot;Sunday painter&quot;.

Lowry holds the record for rejecting British honours—five, including a knighthood (1968). A collection of his work is on display in The Lowry, a purpose-built art gallery on Salford Quays. On 26 June 2013, a major retrospective opened at the Tate Britain in London, his first at the gallery; in 2014 his first solo exhibition outside the UK was held in Nanjing, China.

==Early life==

Lowry was born on 1 November 1887 at 8 Barrett Street, Stretford, which was then in Lancashire. It was a difficult birth, and his mother Elizabeth, who hoped for a girl, was uncomfortable even looking at him at first. Later she expressed envy of her sister Mary, who had &quot;three splendid daughters&quot; instead of one &quot;clumsy boy&quot;. Lowry&#x27;s grandfather Frederick Lowry had emigrated as a boy from Ulster in 1826 and finally settled in Manchester; he built up a career as an estate agent. His father Robert worked as a clerk for the Jacob Earnshaw and Son Property Company and was a withdrawn and introverted man. Lowry once described him as &quot;a cold fish&quot; and &quot;(the sort of man who) realised he had a life to live and did his best to get through it.&quot;

After Lowry&#x27;s birth, his mother&#x27;s health was too poor for her to continue teaching. She is reported to have been a religious woman who was talented and respected, with aspirations of becoming a concert pianist. She was also an irritable, nervous woman brought up to expect high standards by her stern father. Like him, she was controlling and intolerant of failure. She used illness as a means of securing the attention and obedience of her mild and affectionate husband and she dominated her son in the same way. Lowry maintained that he had an unhappy childhood, growing up in a repressive family atmosphere. Although his mother demonstrated no appreciation of her son&#x27;s gifts as an artist, a number of books Lowry received as Christmas presents from his parents are inscribed to &quot;Our dearest Laurie&quot;. At school he made few friends and showed no academic aptitude. His father was affectionate towards him but was, by all accounts, a quiet man who was at his most comfortable fading into the background as an unobtrusive presence.

Much of Lowry&#x27;s early years were spent in the leafy Manchester suburb of Victoria Park, Rusholme, but in 1909, when he was 22, due to financial pressures, the family moved to 117 Station Road in the industrial town of Pendlebury. Here the landscape comprised textile mills and factory chimneys rather than trees. Lowry later recalled: &quot;At first I detested it, and then, after years I got pretty interested in it, then obsessed by it ... One day I missed a train from Pendlebury – [a place] I had ignored for seven years – and as I left the station I saw the Acme Spinning Company&#x27;s mill ... The huge black framework of rows of yellow-lit windows standing up against the sad, damp charged afternoon sky. The mill was turning out ... I watched this scene — which I&#x27;d looked at many times without seeing — with rapture ...&quot;

==Education==

After leaving school, Lowry began a career working for the Pall Mall Company, later collecting rents, he would spend some time in his lunch hour at Buile Hill Park and in the evenings took private art lessons in antique and freehand drawing. In 1905, he secured a place at the Manchester School of Art, where he studied under the French Impressionist, Pierre Adolphe Valette. Lowry was full of praise for Valette as a teacher, remarking &quot;I cannot over-estimate the effect on me of the coming into this drab city of Adolphe Valette, full of French impressionists, aware of everything that was going on in Paris&quot;. In 1915 he moved on to the Royal Technical Institute, Salford (later to become the Royal Technical College, Salford and now the University of Salford) where his studies continued until 1925. There he developed an interest in industrial landscapes and began to establish his own style.

Lowry&#x27;s oil paintings were originally impressionistic and dark in tone but D. B. Taylor of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; took an interest in his work and encouraged him to move away from the sombre palette he was using. Taking this advice on board, Lowry began to use a white background to lighten the pictures. He developed a distinctive style of painting and is best known for his urban landscapes peopled with human figures, often referred to as &quot;matchstick men&quot;. He also painted mysterious unpopulated landscapes, brooding portraits and the unpublished &quot;marionette&quot; works, which were only found after his death.

==Death of his parents==
His father died in 1932, leaving debts. His mother, subject to neurosis and depression, became bedridden and dependent on her son for care. Lowry painted after his mother had fallen asleep, between 10:00 p.m. and 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. Many paintings produced during this period were damning self-portraits (often referred to as the &quot;Horrible Heads&quot; series), which demonstrate the influence of expressionism and may have been inspired by an exhibition of Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s work at Manchester Art Gallery in 1931. He expressed regret that he received little recognition as an artist until his mother died (1939) and that she was not able to enjoy his success. From the mid-1930s until at least 1939, Lowry took annual holidays at Berwick-upon-Tweed. After the outbreak of the Second World War Lowry served as a volunteer fire watcher and became an official war artist in 1943. In 1953, he was appointed Official Artist at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. After his mother&#x27;s death in October 1939, he became depressed and neglected the upkeep of his house to such a degree that the landlord repossessed it in 1948. He was not short of money and bought &quot;The Elms&quot; in Mottram in Longdendale then in Cheshire. The area was much more rural but Lowry professed to dislike both the house and the area:

Although he considered the house ugly and uncomfortable, it was spacious enough both to set up his studio in the dining room and to accommodate the collection of china and clocks that he had inherited from his mother; he stayed there until his death almost 30 years later.

==Personal life==
In later years, Lowry spent holidays at the Seaburn Hotel in Sunderland, painting scenes of the beach and nearby ports and coal mines. When he had no sketchbook, Lowry drew scenes in pencil or charcoal on the back of envelopes, paper napkins and cloakroom tickets and presented them to young people sitting with their families. Such serendipitous pieces are now worth thousands of pounds.

He was a secretive and mischievous man who enjoyed stories irrespective of their truth. His friends observed that his anecdotes were more notable for humour than accuracy and in many cases he set out deliberately to deceive. His stories about the fictional Ann were inconsistent and he invented other people as frameworks on which to hang his tales. The collection of clocks in his living room were all set at different times: to some people, he said that this was because he did not want to know the real time; to others, he claimed that it was to save him from being deafened by their simultaneous chimes. The owner of an art gallery in Manchester who visited him at his home, The Elms, noted that while his armchair was sagging and the carpet frayed, Lowry was surrounded by items such as his beloved Rossetti drawing, &quot;Proserpine&quot;, as well as a Lucian Freud drawing located between two Tompion clocks.

Lowry had many long-lasting friendships, including the Salford artist Harold Riley and painter Pat Gerrard Cooke (1935 – 2000). He made new friends throughout his adult life. He bought works from young artists he admired, such as James Lawrence Isherwood, whose &quot;Woman with Black Cat&quot; hung on his studio wall. He was friends with some of these artists; he befriended the 23-year-old Cumberland artist Sheila Fell in November 1955, describing her as &quot;the finest landscape artist of the mid-20th century&quot;. He supported Fell&#x27;s career by buying several pictures that he gave to museums. Fell later described him as &quot;A great humanist. To be a humanist, one has first to love human beings, and to be a great humanist, one has to be slightly detached from them&quot;. As he never married, this affected his influence but he did have several female friends. At the age of 88 he said that he had &quot;never had a woman&quot;. Although seen as a mostly solitary and private person, Lowry enjoyed attending football matches and was an ardent supporter of Manchester City F.C.

==Retirement==
Lowry retired from the Pall Mall Property Company in 1952 on his 65th birthday. In 1957 an unrelated 13-year-old schoolgirl called Carol Ann Lowry wrote to him at her mother&#x27;s urging to ask his advice on becoming an artist. He visited her home in Heywood and befriended the family. His friendship with Carol Ann Lowry lasted for the rest of his life. BBC Radio 4 broadcast in 2001 a dramatisation by Glyn Hughes of Lowry&#x27;s relationship with Carol Ann.

In the 1960s Lowry shared exhibitions in Salford with Warrington-born artist Reginald Waywell D.F.A.

Lowry joked about retiring from the art world, citing his lack of interest in the changing landscape. Instead, he began to focus on groups of figures and odd imaginary characters. Unknown to his friends and the public, Lowry produced a series of erotic works that were not seen until after his death. The paintings depict the mysterious &quot;Ann&quot; figure, who appears in portraits and sketches produced throughout his lifetime, enduring sexually charged and humiliating tortures. When these works were exhibited at the Art Council&#x27;s Centenary exhibition at the Barbican in 1988, art critic Richard Dorment wrote in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that these works &quot;reveal a sexual anxiety which is never so much as hinted at in the work of the previous 60 years.&quot; The group of erotic works, which are sometimes referred to as &quot;the mannequin sketches&quot; or &quot;marionette works&quot;, are kept at the Lowry Centre and are available for visitors to see on request. Some are also brought up into the public display area on a rotation system. Manchester author Howard Jacobson has argued that the images are just part of Lowry&#x27;s melancholy and tortured view of the world and that they would change the public perception of the complexity of his work if they were more widely seen.

==Death and legacy==
Lowry died of pneumonia at the Woods Hospital in Glossop, Derbyshire, on 23 February 1976, aged 88. He was buried in the Southern Cemetery in Manchester, next to his parents. He left an estate valued at £298,459, and a considerable number of artworks by himself and others to Carol Ann Lowry, who, in 2001, obtained trademark protection of the artist&#x27;s signature.

Lowry left a cultural legacy, his works often sold for millions of pounds and inspired other artists. The Lowry art gallery in Salford Quays was opened in 2000 at a cost of £106 million; named after him, the gallery houses 55 of his paintings and 278 drawings – the world&#x27;s largest collection of his work – with up to 100 on display. In January 2005, a statue of him was unveiled in Mottram in Longdendale 100 yards away from his home from 1948 until his death in 1976. The statue has been a target for vandals since it was unveiled. In 2006 the Lowry Centre in Salford hosted a contemporary dance performance inspired by his work.

To mark the centenary of his birth in 1987, Royston Futter, director of the L. S. Lowry Centenary Festival, on behalf of the City of Salford and the BBC commissioned the Northern Ballet Theatre and Gillian Lynne to create a dance drama in his honour. &quot;A Simple Man&quot; was choreographed and directed by Lynne, with music by Carl Davis and starred Christopher Gable and Moira Shearer (in her last dance role). It was broadcast on BBC, for which it won a BAFTA award as the best arts programme in 1988, and also performed live on stage in November 1987. Further performances were held in London at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in 1988, and again in 2009.

In February 2011 a bronze statue of Lowry was installed in the basement of his favourite pub, Sam&#x27;s Chop House.
In 2013 a retrospective was held at the Tate Britain in London, his first there. In 2014 his first solo exhibition outside the UK was held in Nanjing, China. One of the &#x27;houses&#x27; at Wellacre Academy in Manchester is named after him.

==Awards and honours==

Lowry was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree by the University of Manchester in 1945, and Doctor of Letters in 1961. In April 1955 Lowry was elected as an Associate Member of the Royal Academy of Arts and in April 1962 became a full Royal Academician. At the end of December of the same year his membership status evolved to that of Senior Academician having reached the age of 75. He was given the freedom of the city of Salford in 1965.

In 1975 he was awarded two honorary Doctor of Letters degrees by the Universities of Salford and Liverpool. In 1964, the art world celebrated his 77th birthday with an exhibition of his work and that of 25 contemporary artists who had submitted tributes at Monk&#x27;s Hall Museum, Eccles. The Hallé orchestra performed a concert in his honour and Prime Minister Harold Wilson used Lowry&#x27;s painting &quot;The Pond&quot; as his official Christmas card. Lowry&#x27;s painting &quot;Coming Out of School&quot; was depicted on a postage stamp of highest denomination in a series issued by the Post Office depicting great British artists in 1968.
Lowry twice declined appointment to the Order of the British Empire: as an Officer (OBE) in 1955, and as a Commander (CBE) in 1961, Lowry saying &quot;There seemed little point.. once mother was dead&quot; (as seen in the end credits of the movie &quot;Mrs Lowry &amp; Son&quot;). He turned down a knighthood in 1968, and appointments to the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in 1972 and 1976. He holds the record for the most honours declined.

==Quotations==

* On the industrial landscape
** &quot;We went to Pendlebury in 1909 from a residential side of Manchester, and we didn&#x27;t like it. My father wanted to go to get near a friend for business reasons. We lived next door, and for a long time my mother never got to like it, and at first I disliked it, and then after about a year or so I got used to it, and then I got absorbed in it, then I got infatuated with it. Then I began to wonder if anyone had ever done it. Seriously, not one or two, but seriously; and it seemed to me by that time that it was a very fine industrial subject matter. And I couldn&#x27;t see anybody at that time who had done it – and nobody had done it, it seemed.&quot;
** &quot;Most of my land and townscape is composite. Made up; part real and part imaginary ... bits and pieces of my home locality. I don&#x27;t even know I&#x27;m putting them in. They just crop up on their own, like things do in dreams.&quot;
* On his style
** &quot;I wanted to paint myself into what absorbed me ... Natural figures would have broken the spell of it, so I made my figures half unreal. Some critics have said that I turned my figures into puppets, as if my aim were to hint at the hard economic necessities that drove them. To say the truth, I was not thinking very much about the people. I did not care for them in the way a social reformer does. They are part of a private beauty that haunted me. I loved them and the houses in the same way: as part of a vision.
** &quot;I am a simple man, and I use simple materials: ivory black, vermilion, prussian blue, yellow ochre, flake white and no medium. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve ever used in my paintings. I like oils ... I like a medium you can work into over a period of time.&quot;
* On painting his &quot;Seascapes&quot;
** &quot;It&#x27;s the battle of life – the turbulence of the sea ... I have been fond of the sea all my life, how wonderful it is, yet how terrible it is. But I often think ... what if it suddenly changed its mind and didn&#x27;t turn the tide? And came straight on? If it didn&#x27;t stay and came on and on and on and on ... That would be the end of it all.&quot;
* On art
** &quot;You don&#x27;t need brains to be a painter, just feelings.&quot;
** &quot;I am not an artist. I am a man who paints.&quot;
** &quot;If people call me a Sunday painter, I&#x27;m a Sunday painter who paints every day of the week.&quot;

==Works==

Lowry&#x27;s work is held in many public and private collections. The largest collection is held by Salford City Council and displayed at The Lowry. Its collection has about 400 works. X-ray analyses have revealed hidden figures under his drawings – the &quot;Ann&quot; figures. &quot;Going to the Match&quot;, formerly owned by the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association (PFA), is displayed at The Lowry along with a preparatory pencil sketch.

The Tate Gallery in London owns 23 works. The City of Southampton owns &quot;The Floating Bridge&quot;, &quot;The Canal Bridge&quot; and &quot;An Industrial Town&quot;. His work is featured at MOMA, in New York City. The Christchurch Art Gallery Te Puna o Waiwhetu in Christchurch, New Zealand has &quot;Factory at Widnes&quot; (1956) in its collection. The painting was one of the gallery&#x27;s most important acquisitions of the 1950s and remains the highlight of its collection of modern British art.

In the early days of his career Lowry was a member of the Manchester Group of Lancashire artists, exhibiting with them at Margo Ingham&#x27;s Mid-Day Studios in Manchester. He made a small painting of the Mid-Day Studios which is in the collection of the Manchester City Art Gallery.

During his life Lowry made about 1,000 paintings and over 8,000 drawings.

===Stolen Lowry works===
Five Lowry art works were stolen from the Grove Fine Art Gallery in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport on 2 May 2007. The most valuable were &quot;The Viaduct&quot;, estimated value of £700,000 and &quot;The Tanker Entering the Tyne&quot;, which is valued at over £500,000. &quot;The Surgery&quot;, &quot;The Bridge at Ringley&quot; and &quot;The Street Market&quot; were also stolen. The paintings were later found in a house in Halewood near Liverpool. Only one of the four robbers was caught and convicted; two other men were later convicted for possession of the stolen works.
A further pencil drawing, &quot;The Skater&quot;, has never been returned.

=== Attributed works in 2015 ===
In July 2015 three works – &quot;Lady with Dogs&quot;, &quot;Darby and Joan&quot; and &quot;Crowd Scene&quot; – featured in the BBC One series &quot;Fake or Fortune?&quot;. The presenters concluded that the works were genuine, despite their weak provenance and the fact that Lowry was &quot;probably the most faked British artist, his deceptively simple style of painting making him a soft target for forgers&quot;. An important element in the programme&#x27;s assessment was Lowry&#x27;s claim to have used only five colours including lead white, whereas a contemporary photograph showed that he had also used titanium white and zinc white.

=== Discovered work ===
&quot;The Mill, Pendlebury&quot;, a painting never publicly exhibited or featured in any book, was found in the estate of Leonard D. Hamilton, a British-American researcher, after his death in 2019. Hamilton was a Manchester Grammar School boy who studied at Balliol College, Oxford, and Trinity College, Cambridge, before moving to the US in 1949. The work was listed at Christie&#x27;s with an estimate of £700,000 to £1 million, and sold on 21 January 2020, to a private collector, for £2.65 million.

==Art market==
In March 2014 fifteen of Lowry&#x27;s works, from the A.J. Thompson Collection, were auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s in London; the total sale estimate of £15 million was achieved, even though two paintings failed to reach their reserve price and were withdrawn. Thompson, owner of the &quot;Salford Express&quot;, collected only Lowry paintings, starting in 1982. The auction included the paintings &quot;Peel Park, Salford&quot; and &quot;Piccadilly Circus, London&quot;, Lowry&#x27;s most expensive painting at auction to date, which fetched £5.6 million in 2011 but only £5.1 million in 2014. Lowry painted very few London scenes, and only two depict Piccadilly Circus.

==In popular culture==
* In January 1968, rock band Status Quo paid tribute to Lowry in their first hit single &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot;.
* In 1978, Brian and Michael reached number one in the UK Singles Chart with the tribute single &quot;Matchstalk Men and Matchstalk Cats and Dogs&quot;.
* Manchester rock band Oasis released a music video for the song &quot;The Masterplan&quot;, to promote their 2006 compilation album &quot;Stop the Clocks&quot;, using animation in the style of his paintings. The video sets the group in a number of Lowry scenes, but clues as to their modernity are given by inclusion of such items as a satellite dish.
* In August 2010, the play &quot;Figures Half Unreal&quot; was performed by the Brass Bastion theatre company in Berwick-upon-Tweed where Lowry was a regular visitor.
* On 1 November 2012, Google celebrated his 125th birthday with a Google Doodle.
* Lowry is mentioned in the chorus of the Manic Street Preachers&#x27; song &quot;30-Year War&quot; on their 2013 album &quot;Rewind the Film&quot;:

* The 2019 film &quot;Mrs Lowry &amp; Son&quot;, directed by Adrian Noble and starring Vanessa Redgrave and Timothy Spall, depicts the fraught relationship between Lowry and his elderly bed-ridden mother between 1934 and 1939.
* &quot;Sunday painter&quot; by Dutch band Nits is a song inspired by Lowry.

<text>ISO 10006:2018, Quality management systems - Guidelines for quality management in projects, is an international standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization.

ISO 10006:2018 gives guidance on the application of quality management in projects. It supersedes ISO 10006:2003.

==Basic principles==
ISO 10006 is applicable to organizations working on projects of varying complexity, small or large, of short or long duration, being an individual project to being part of a programme or portfolio of projects, in different environments, and irrespective of the kind of product/service or process involved, with the intention of satisfying project interested parties by introducing quality management in projects. This can necessitate some tailoring of the guidance to suit a particular project.

ISO 10006 defines a project as &quot;unique process undertaken to achieve an objective&quot;. A project generally consists of a set of coordinated and controlled activities with start and finish dates, conforming to specific requirements, including the constraints of time, cost and resources.

==Linked standards==
ISO 10006 is not a guide to &quot;project management&quot; itself. Guidance on quality in project management processes is discussed in this International Standard. Guidance on quality in a project&#x27;s product-related processes, and on the &quot;process approach&quot;, is covered in ISO 9004. A new &quot;Project Management - Guide to project Management&quot; ISO 21500 has been published in September 2012.

Since ISO 10006 is a guidance document, it is not intended to be used for certification/registration purposes.

<text>John Gerard Bruton (18 May 1947 – 6 February 2024) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as Taoiseach from 1994 to 1997 and Leader of Fine Gael from 1990 to 2001. He held cabinet positions between 1981‍ and 1987, including twice as minister for finance. He was Leader of the Opposition from 1990 to 1994 and 1997 to 2001. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for Meath from 1969 to 2004.

During his term as Taoiseach, he led a Fine Gael–Labour–Democratic Left coalition, known as the Rainbow Coalition. After stepping down as a TD, he accepted an offer to become European Union Ambassador to the United States, serving from 2004 to 2009.

==Early and personal life==
John Gerard Bruton was born to a wealthy, Catholic farming family in Dunboyne, County Meath, and educated at Clongowes Wood College.

Oliver Coogan notes in his &quot;Politics and War in Meath 1913–23&quot; that Bruton&#x27;s grand-uncle was one of the farmers in south Meath who prevented the traditionally Anglo-Irish ascendency hunt from proceeding in the area during the Irish War of Independence.

Bruton later went on to study at University College Dublin (UCD), where he received an honours Bachelor of Arts degree and qualified as a barrister from King&#x27;s Inns, but never went on to practice law. Bruton was narrowly elected to Dáil Éireann in the 1969 general election, as a Fine Gael TD for Meath. At the age of 22, he was one of the youngest ever members of the Dáil at that time. He more than doubled his vote in the 1973 general election, which brought Fine Gael to power as part of the National Coalition with the Labour Party. Bruton was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Education, in the National Coalition in 1973. He remained in office until 1977.

In 1978, Bruton married Finola Gill; and they had four children.

==Shadow cabinet and in government==

Following Fine Gael&#x27;s defeat at the 1977 general election, the new leader, Garret FitzGerald, appointed Bruton to the front bench as Spokesperson on Agriculture. He was later promoted as Spokesperson for Finance, making a particularly effective speech in the Dáil in response to the budget of 1980. He played a prominent role in Fine Gael&#x27;s campaign in the 1981 general election, which resulted in another coalition with the Labour Party, with FitzGerald as Taoiseach. Bruton received a personal vote in Meath of nearly 23%, and at the age of only 34 was appointed Minister for Finance, the most senior position in the cabinet. In light of overwhelming economic realities, the government abandoned its election promises to cut taxes. The government collapsed unexpectedly on the night of 27 January 1982, when Bruton&#x27;s budget was defeated in the Dáil. The previously supportive Independent Socialist TD Jim Kemmy, voted against the budget, which proposed among other things the introduction of VAT on children&#x27;s shoes. FitzGerald sought a dissolution of the Dáil, which was granted by the president.

===First leadership bid===

The minority Fianna Fáil government which followed only lasted until November 1982, when Fine Gael once again returned to power in a coalition government with the Labour Party, but when the new government was formed, Bruton was moved from Finance to become Minister for Industry and Energy. After a reconfiguration of government departments in 1983, Bruton became Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism. In a cabinet reshuffle in February 1986, Bruton was appointed again as Minister for Finance. Although he was minister for finance, Bruton never presented his budget. The Labour Party withdrew from the government due to a disagreement over his budget proposals leading to the collapse of the government and another election.

Following the 1987 general election Fine Gael suffered a heavy defeat. Garret FitzGerald resigned as leader immediately, and a leadership contest ensued between Alan Dukes, Peter Barry and Bruton himself. The exact result of the vote was not published. This was a blow to Bruton as the victor, Dukes, had been a TD for 12 years fewer than him. Bruton was on Fine Gael&#x27;s right wing, whereas Dukes was in FitzGerald&#x27;s social democratic and liberal mould. Dukes was perceived to be a lacklustre leader, however, who alienated his party&#x27;s TDs and Senators and made little progress in recovering the ground lost by Fine Gael in 1987. His Tallaght Strategy where he stated that he would support Fianna Fáil on economic reforms was also unpopular. The disastrous performance in the 1990 presidential election, in which the party finished in a humiliating and then unprecedented third in a national election, proved to be the final straw for the party and Dukes was forced to resign as leader shortly after. Bruton, who was the deputy leader of Fine Gael at the time, was unopposed in the ensuing leadership election.

==Leadership of Fine Gael==

Whereas Dukes came from the social democratic wing of Fine Gael, Bruton came from the more conservative wing. However to the surprise of critics and of conservatives, in his first policy initiative, he called for a referendum on a Constitutional amendment permitting the enactment of legislation allowing for divorce in Ireland.

Fine Gael had been in decline for nearly a decade; from the high point of the November 1982 general election when it achieved 70 seats in Dáil Éireann (only five seats short of Fianna Fáil&#x27;s total). The party had lost a considerable number of seats over the following ten years. Following the inexperienced Dukes&#x27; disastrous period of leadership, Bruton&#x27;s election was seen as offering Fine Gael a chance to rebuild under a far more politically experienced leader. However, Bruton&#x27;s perceived right-wing persona and his rural background were used against him by critics and particularly by the media.

By the 1992 general election, the anti-Fianna Fáil mood in the country produced a major swing to the opposition, but that support went to the Labour Party, not Bruton&#x27;s Fine Gael, which lost a further 10 seats. Even then, it initially appeared that Fine Gael was in a position to form a government. However, negotiations stalled in part from Labour&#x27;s refusal to be part of a coalition which would include the libertarian Progressive Democrats, as well as Bruton&#x27;s unwillingness to take Democratic Left into a prospective coalition. The Labour Party broke off talks with Fine Gael and opted to enter a new coalition with Fianna Fáil. It was a humiliating blow to Bruton, as the Labour Party was always seen as a natural ally of Fine Gael rather than Fianna Fáil. Fine Gael, and Bruton personally, continued to perform poorly in opinion polls throughout 1993 and early 1994, Bruton narrowly survived a challenge to his leadership in early 1994. However, a couple of by-election victories, and a good performance in the 1994 European elections, coupled with a disastrous showing by the Labour Party, shored up his position.

In late 1994, the government of Fianna Fáil&#x27;s Albert Reynolds collapsed. Bruton was able to persuade Labour to end its coalition with Fianna Fáil and enter a new coalition government with Fine Gael and Democratic Left. Bruton faced charges of hypocrisy for agreeing to enter government with the Democratic Left, as Fine Gael campaigned in the 1992 general election on a promise not to enter government with the party. Nevertheless, on 15 December, aged 47, Bruton became the then youngest ever Taoiseach. This was the first time in the history of the state that a new government was installed without a general election being held.

==Taoiseach (1994–1997)==

Continued developments in the Northern Ireland peace process and his attitude to Anglo-Irish relations came to define Bruton&#x27;s tenure as Taoiseach. In February 1995, he launched the Anglo-Irish &#x27;Framework Document&#x27; with the British prime minister, John Major. This document outlined new proposed relations between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. Many of Bruton&#x27;s opponents considered him to be too willing to accommodate unionist demands and Albert Reynolds nicknamed him &quot;John Unionist&quot;. However, he took a strongly critical position on the British Government&#x27;s reluctance to engage with Sinn Féin during the IRA&#x27;s 1994–1997 ceasefire. Bruton complained to a local radio reporter in Cork that &quot;I am sick of answering questions about the fucking peace process&quot;, for which he later apologised.

Bruton also established a working relationship with Gerry Adams of Sinn Féin, however, both were mutually distrustful of each other. The relationship became frayed following the ending of the ceasefire in 1996, resulting in a bomb explosion in London. These relations worsened when the IRA killed Jerry McCabe, a member of the Garda Síochána, in a botched post office robbery in County Limerick, and another bomb explosion in Manchester. However, Bruton received widespread praise in the Republic for condemning the Royal Ulster Constabulary for yielding to loyalist threats at Drumcree by allowing members of the Orange Order to parade through a nationalist district. He stated that the RUC had been neither impartial nor consistent in applying the law. His outrage and criticism led to a tense atmosphere between London and Dublin. By the time of the 1997 general election, Sinn Féin stated that they would prefer a Fianna Fáil led government and the IRA resumed their ceasefire soon after Fine Gael lost the 1997 general election.

He also presided over a successful Irish Presidency of the European Union in 1996 and helped finalise the Stability and Growth Pact, which establishes macroeconomic parameters for countries participating in the single European currency, the euro. Bruton was the fifth Irish leader to address a joint session of the United States Congress on 11 September 1996, as head of state or government of an EU country to do so since 1945.

Bruton&#x27;s government suffered from some allegations of corruption, and political embarrassment. In 1996, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communication, Michael Lowry, resigned from the cabinet after allegations that he had not paid income tax on payments from the supermarket tycoon, Ben Dunne, for work he had done for him as a businessman before becoming a Minister. Phil Hogan, Minister of State at the Department of Finance, resigned on 9 February 1995 as a result of leaks of budget information from the Department of Finance on the day the budget was delivered in the Dail. Additionally, many years later Frank Dunlop made allegations before the planning tribunal that he had informed Bruton about demands for a £250,000 bribe made to him by a Fine Gael Dublin City Councillor, Tom Hand, to rezone the Quarryvale development. Dunlop testified that when he informed Bruton of the bribery attempts, Bruton replied, &quot;There are no angels in the world or in Fine Gael.&quot; Bruton vehemently denied this and Fine Gael counsel told the Planning Tribunal in 2003: &quot;I refute entirely Mr Dunlop&#x27;s contention that he advised me then of the alleged demand made to him by the late Tom Hand&quot;. However, following further evidence at the tribunal, Bruton returned to it in October 2007 and conceded that &quot;it gradually came back to me&quot;, and that Dunlop, &quot;did say to me something about a Councillor looking for money&quot;. However, in his evidence to the tribunal in 2007, Dunlop himself said that he had not mentioned any figure of 250,000 to Bruton in his 1993 conversation with him.

Bruton presided over the first official visit by a member of the British royal family since 1912, by Charles, Prince of Wales. His welcome speech was criticised in some newspapers as being too effusive but his assessment was that the visit was helpful in improving Anglo-Irish relations. 

Following the murder of crime journalist Veronica Guerin, his government established the Criminal Assets Bureau.

==Post-Taoiseach period==

At the 1997 general election, Fine Gael won 54 seats, a gain of 9 seats. However, the Labour Party suffered considerable losses, falling from 32 seats to 17, while the Democratic Left also lost two seats. This left Bruton far short of the parliamentary support he needed to retain office. A Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrat coalition led by Bertie Ahern entered office, with Bruton reverting to opposition leadership.

Fine Gael became paralysed in opposition. Bruton was deposed from leadership in 2001, in favour of Michael Noonan, due in part to fears Fine Gael would suffer severe losses in the 2002 election. However, Noonan failed to live up to expectations and the party suffered an even greater collapse than had been expected under Bruton. Having hoped to make gains on its seat count of 54, it only won 31. This not only tied Fine Gael&#x27;s second-worst performance in an election but was 39 seats fewer than at its high point twenty years earlier in 1982.

Bruton, a passionate supporter of European integration, was chosen as one of the two Irish Parliament Representatives to the European Convention, which helped draft the proposed European Constitution. He was one of two National Parliament Representatives to sit on the 12-member Praesidium, which helped steer the European Convention. He was a member of the Comité d&#x27;Honneur of the Institute of International and European Affairs, along with Peter Sutherland and Bertie Ahern. He served as a vice-president of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). He accepted an offer to become European Union Ambassador to the United States, in the summer of 2004, and after resigning from the Dáil on 1 November 2004, he assumed that office.
Bruton was praised by Ahern, who said Bruton had played &quot;a pivotal role in developing Ireland&#x27;s relations with the European Union.&quot;

Bruton received an Honorary Doctorate from Memorial University of Newfoundland in 2003, and from the University of Missouri in 2009.

He regularly lectured at national and international universities. In early 2004, he accepted a position as an Adjunct Faculty Member in the School of Law and Government at Dublin City University. In November 2008, he received the Order of the Polar Star award from the Government of Sweden.

His brother, Richard Bruton, is also a Fine Gael politician and has served in several ministerial roles, most recently as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.

On 29 October 2009, it was announced that he had written to the Ambassadors to the United States of the 27 members of the European Union expressing his interest in applying for the position of President of the European Council following the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty. Bruton was very much an outside shot for the position as EU leaders firmly indicated they want a chairman-style president rather than a high-profile figurehead to fill the post. Herman Van Rompuy, the Belgian Prime Minister, was appointed President of the European Council on 19 November 2009 and took office on 1 December 2009.

On 21 May 2010, it was announced that he would be the chairman of the newly formed financial services body, IFSC Ireland. His main role was to promote Ireland as a location of choice for international financial services.

Bruton was widely discussed as a candidate for the 2011 presidential election and was approached by Fine Gael with the opportunity to become their candidate; on 28 May 2011, however, Bruton stated that he was &quot;flattered&quot; to be asked, but would not be a candidate for the presidency.

From November 2011, Bruton acted as an advisor to Fair Observer focusing mainly on the areas of politics, finance and economics as well as on issues pertaining to Europe.

In September 2014, on the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Government of Ireland Act 1914, Bruton said the 1916 Easter Rising was a mistake and an unjust war.

Bruton supported the &quot;No&quot; campaign during the 2018 Irish referendum on abortion.

==Death==
Bruton died aged 76 on 6 February 2024 at the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin, having had cancer for some time. A state funeral was held on 10 February at St Peter&#x27;s and St Paul&#x27;s Church in Dunboyne.

==Governments led==
Bruton led the following government:
*24th government of Ireland (27th Dáil; December 1994 – June 1997)

<doc id="208033" wikidata="Q742047" url="?curid=208033" title="Luís Carlos Prestes">
<text>Luís Carlos Prestes (January 3, 1898 – March 7, 1990) was a Brazilian revolutionary and politician who served as the general-secretary of the Brazilian Communist Party from 1943 to 1980 and a senator for the Federal District from 1946 to 1948. One of the leading communists in Brazil, Prestes has been regarded by many as one of Brazil&#x27;s most charismatic yet tragic figures for his leadership of the 1924 &quot;tenentist&quot; revolt and his subsequent work with the Brazilian communist movement. The 1924 expedition earned Prestes the nickname &quot;The Knight of Hope.&quot;

Beginning in 1924, as a young army officer, Prestes was a leading figure in an abortive military revolt. After its failure, he led a band of rebel troops, known as the Prestes Column, on a three-year, 14,000-mile trek through the remote Brazilian interior in a futile attempt to stir peasant opposition to the Government. Eventually, the rebels went into exile in Bolivia. Although the effort failed, he became a romantic hero.

He went on to become general-secretary of the Brazilian Communist Party, which advocated ending payments on the national debt, nationalization of foreign-owned companies, and land reform. Imprisoned after a violent uprising in 1935 and sentenced to 30 years in prison for ordering the execution of the teenager Elza Fernandes, he was released after World War II and later served briefly as a senator. He was the communist opposition throughout the Vargas Era in Brazil.

In the 1980s, Prestes accused the Brazilian Communist Party of abandoning Marxist-Leninist philosophy. He was removed from the leadership in 1980 and expelled in 1984. He campaigned for Leonel Brizola, a center-left candidate, in the 1989 presidential election, won by Fernando Collor de Mello.

==Early life and Tenente revolt==
Prestes was born in Porto Alegre in the southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul on January 3, 1898. His father had been an officer in the army. With his family enduring financial difficulties after his father left them, Prestes enrolled in the Military School of Realengo in Rio de Janeiro (where future fellow-tenentes Antônio de Siqueira Campos and Eduardo Gomes also attended) at the age of 21, completing his military training in 1919. Specializing in military engineering, he finished first in his class.

Although he played a key part in the planning of the revolt of 1922, Prestes actually missed out on the fateful &quot;March of the 18,&quot; as he was in bed with typhoid fever when the revolt broke out. Since Prestes was not directly involved in the revolt, he escaped the prison sentences of some of his colleagues, but he was transferred to Rio Grande do Sul.

When the 1924 revolt broke out in an attempt to once again bring an end to the First Republic, Prestes rose to a key position in the Tenentes movement, named for the role the lower-ranking officers played in the revolts of both 1922 and 1924. While not involved in the temporary takeover of São Paulo in July 1924, Prestes rose to fame when, after a failed attempt to take over a garrison, he met the rebels from São Paulo and led the combined group of tenentes and rebels in what came to be known as the &quot;Prestes Column.&quot;

Given his future political trajectory, it is more than a little ironic that Prestes rejected Siqueira Campos’s recommendation the tenentes affiliate with the communists in the international political arena. Over nearly 3 years, the column marched 25,000 kilometers (16,000 miles) across thirteen Brazilian states. The column, organized in protest of the politics and policies of the oligarchical First Republic (1889–1930), lacked the power to threaten the First Republic directly, but was nonetheless strong enough to resist the government’s efforts to apprehend and eliminate the Prestes Column, which ultimately went into exile in Bolivia in 1927. His ability to avoid defeat at the hands of government forces made Prestes somewhat of a folk hero both in Brazil and internationally.

==In exile (1927–1930)==

While in Bolivia, Prestes worked on road-building, sanitation, and other infrastructure projects for the British enterprise Bolivian Company Limited. In late 1927, the secretary-general of the Partido Comunista Brasileiro (Brazilian Communist Party; PCB), Astrojildo Pereira, went to Bolivia to meet Prestes. During the visit, he left some Marxist works with Prestes and recommended an alliance with the Brazilian Communist Party.

Ironically (given Prestes&#x27; future political path), the tenente turned down Pereira&#x27;s recommendation, remaining in Bolivia until late 1928, when he went to Argentina and found work as an engineer. It was at this time that Prestes finally read Marxist works and began to identify with socialism, a process further facilitated by his conversations with the Rodolfo Ghioldi, a key figure in Argentine communist politics, and August Kleine, who was a representative of the Communist International in South America from 1930 through 1934.

==1930 revolution==
The &quot;tenente&quot; revolt heralded the end of the &quot;coffee and milk&quot; &quot;coronelismo&quot; politics and the beginning of social reforms. The Revolution of 1930 ended Brazil&#x27;s Old Republic. Joined by many moderate &quot;tenentes&quot;, but not Prestes, the Revolution of 1930 installed Getúlio Vargas as Brazil&#x27;s provisional president. Although the &quot;tenentes&quot; sympathized with him, Vargas was a far more conservative figure.

Because the &quot;tenentes&quot; wanted Prestes to join Vargas, Prestes decided to meet him in Porto Alegre and explained his idea of socialist revolution to Vargas for about two hours. Vargas was highly impressed by Prestes and even donated 800 &quot;contos de réis&quot; (about $400,000 at the time, or about $5,860,000 in 2017 USD) to the revolutionary cause.

However, Prestes viewed Vargas as the leader of a bourgeois revolution and believing that the Liberal Alliance was merely going to replace one oligarchical system with another, Prestes fatefully declined. He attempted to create the League of Revolutionary Action, a &quot;third path&quot; that differed from the Liberal Alliance and the First Republic, but the movement failed to gain enough adherents to be sustainable. Continuing to deploy Marxist analysis in his consideration of Brazilian politics and society, he nonetheless was excluded from the Brazilian Communist Party, which had begun replacing intellectuals with workers in the party structure. Ultimately, Prestes once again went into a self-imposed exile, this time in Uruguay.

==Alignment to Marxism==
In 1931, he went to the USSR where he worked as an engineer and continued his study of communism. At the end of 1934, he left the Soviet Union to return to Brazil, accompanied by his soon-to-be wife, Olga Benário, an agent of the Communist International assigned to provide security for him.

In 1935, he was made a member of the executive committee of the Communist International and is reported to have earned the confidence of Stalin. In that same year, he became the leader of the Aliança Nacional Libertadora (National Liberation Alliance) (ANL), a left-wing popular front, consisting of socialists, communists, and other progressives led by the Communist Party in opposition to Vargas&#x27; crackdown against organized labor.

Getúlio Vargas, who had by this time become Brazil&#x27;s legally recognized president (no longer merely &quot;ad interim&quot;), thus looked to a form of authoritarian government. He endeavored to suppress his enemies on the left, led by Prestes, through violence and state terror in order to survive with his coalition intact during the agitated years that began in 1934. Vargas had become allied with Brazil&#x27;s agrarian oligarchies, having an established network of economic and political power, and the Integralists, a fascist movement with a mass popular base in urban Brazil. Vargas&#x27;s political power forced the Brazilian Congress to respond to the growth of the communist movement.

While former tenentes and colleagues such as Eduardo Gomes, Juracy Magalhães, and Juarez Távora were increasingly moving rightward, Prestes had soured on the Vargas government after supporting his rise in 1930. With Prestes&#x27;s affiliation with the ANL, its membership grew in the course of 1935, and, in a moment of overconfidence, the ANL issued a manifesto that called for the overthrow of the Vargas government. Vargas used the opportunity to declare the ANL an illegal organization; when Prestes and other members of the ANL launched an insurrection in November 1935 in Rio Grande do Norte, Vargas&#x27;s government quickly cracked down and ended it. Miscalculating Vargas&#x27;s intentions, the ANL ultimately created the pretext that allowed Vargas to further solidify his control, going after a broader range of critics and opponents of his government. Prestes avoided the initial wave of crackdowns, but by March 1936, both he and Olga had been imprisoned. Given her status as a foreigner, Vargas sent a pregnant Olga back to Nazi Germany.

After the revolt failed, the leaders were arrested and tried for sedition in 1937. Prestes was sentenced to 16 years in prison. In 1943, while still in prison, Prestes was elected general secretary of the Communist Party of Brazil.

==Imprisonment==

As a result of Vargas&#x27; increased political power, the Brazilian Congress branded all leftist opposition as &quot;subversive&quot; under a March 1935 National Security Act. The new act allowed the President to ban the ANL. Vested with its new emergency powers, the federal government imposed a crackdown on the entire left, with arrests, torture, and summary trials. By mid-1935 Brazilian politics had become drastically destabilized. In July the government moved against the ANL, with troops raiding offices, confiscating propaganda, seizing records, and jailing leaders. The ANL resorted to its armed insurrection in November, but it was quickly defeated. The authoritarian regime, like its fascist counterparts in Europe, responded by imprisoning and torturing Prestes and violently crushing the communist movement through state terror.

Vargas, seeking to co-opt Brazil&#x27;s fascist movement and paramilitary, known as &quot;Integralism&quot; and led by Plínio Salgado, tolerated a tide of anti-Semitism, and may have targeted Prestes&#x27; wife to appease his new supporters. Vargas deported the pregnant, German-Jewish wife of Luís Carlos Prestes, Olga Benario, to Nazi Germany, where she later was murdered by her Nazi captors in a concentration camp.

==Political career==

After Vargas began abandoning fascist-style autocracy in 1945, following his rapprochement with the World War II Allies in 1943, political prisoners were released. Prestes was released from prison in May 1945 in an amnesty for political prisoners.

With the overthrow of the Vargas regime in October 1945, new elections took place. Prestes gave an astute assessment of Vargas&#x27; politics, commenting, &quot;Getúlio is very flexible. When it was fashionable to be a fascist, he was a fascist. Now that it is fashionable to be democratic, he will be a democrat.&quot; Despite his own treatment at the hands of Vargas, and the fate of his wife, Prestes threw his support behind Vargas in the name of national unity.

Once more he plunged into the political arena. With about 6 months in which to work before the presidential election, Prestes set about reorganising the Communist Party, which numbered only 4000 members. The communists showed unprecedented strength in the ensuing elections, polling some 700,000 or 15 percent of the total.

In the elections of December 2, 1945, Prestes won the highest number of votes in his race for the senator of the Federal District. Prestes&#x27;s election coincided, however, with the beginning of the Cold War.

As a senator, Prestes played a part in the writing of a new constitution in 1946. Later that month, Vargas was ousted by the hard-right wing of the military partly because of his liberalizing moves; the communist movement became persecuted once again. In May 1947, the Brazilian government outlawed the Communist Party, and Congress followed suit by ousting its communist members. Prestes immediately went into hiding and operated underground for 10 years.

He refused to support any of the candidates in the 1950 election, and remained an open critic of Vargas&#x27;s presidency up through the latter&#x27;s suicide in 1954. Prestes did support the candidacy of Juscelino Kubitschek in 1955, and began to play a more public role even while the PCB remained illegal. With the ascendance of João Goulart to the presidency in the wake of Jânio Quadros&#x27;s abrupt resignation in August 1961, Prestes, like others on the left (and not just in the PCB) saw a chance for real reform for Brazil&#x27;s workers and peasants, and he continually publicly pressured Goulart to accelerate reforms in Brazil. Of course, amidst the polarization of the Cold War, the middle classes, conservatives, and military saw the spectre of communism in Goulart&#x27;s eventual leftward shift; determined to prevent a communist &quot;dictatorship,&quot; the military overthrew Goulart and instead ushered in a conservative dictatorship.

Once again living under a right-wing regime, Prestes once again went underground, then exile, as the military targeted other veteran PCB members such as Gregório Bezerra. Even while former tentente Eduardo Gomes served as the Minister of the Air Force during the military dictatorship, former tenente Luís Carlos Prestes was constantly attempting to avoid military repression. Yet that was not the least of Prestes&#x27; problems. Long acknowledged as a leader in Brazilian communism, the heterogeneity of Marxism both globally and in Brazil transformed his role in the 1960s.

Under the presidency of João Goulart (1961–1964), a protégé of Getúlio Vargas, and another gaúcho from Rio Grande do Sul, the closeness of the government to the historically disenfranchised working class and peasantry and even to the Communist Party under none other than Luís Carlos Prestes was equally remarkable. Goulart appeared to have been co-opting the communist movement in a manner reminiscent of Vargas&#x27; co-option of the Integralists shortly, and not coincidentally, before his ouster by reactionary forces. Once again, Prestes was imprisoned and the communist movement was persecuted.

The experience of the failed &quot;tenente&quot; rebellion and Vargas&#x27; suppression of the communist movement left Prestes, and some of his comrades, skeptical of armed conflict for the rest of his life. His well-cultivated skepticism later helped precipitate the permanent schism between hardline Maoists and orthodox Moscow-influenced militants in the Brazilian Communist Party during the early 1960s. Prestes went on to lead the pro-Soviet faction of the party known as the Brazilian Communist Party (or PCB) while the Maoists formed the Communist Party of Brazil (or PCdoB). While the Maoists went underground and engaged in urban combat against the military dictatorship after 1964, Prestes&#x27; faction did not.

==Later life and death==

In 1970, Prestes went to Moscow with his second wife, Maria Prestes, and their children, and only returned to Brazil after amnesty for political offenders was granted ten years later. By the mid-1970s, the dictatorship, having effectively eliminated the other armed leftist movements, turned its sights on the PCB, targeting and killing some of its top leaders, but by that point, Prestes had been in exile for a number of years.

Ultimately, Prestes returned to Brazil with the military&#x27;s general amnesty of 1979 that pardoned political prisoners and exiles (while also pardoning any and all military members and officials tied to torture or the execution of the regime&#x27;s opponents). Despite the return of the man many saw as the figurehead and leader of the Brazilian Communist Party, the remnants of the party remained divided over what paths to pursue as Brazil returned to democratization, riven by questions over whether to support the institutional transition or to demand a more radical revolution. While many could and did acknowledge Prestes&#x27;s historical importance to the left in Brazil, they felt that, at over 80 years old, he was no longer the appropriate leader, and he was removed from his position as secretary-general of the PCB.

He became a supporter of the Brazil&#x27;s Democratic Labour Party and took part in Leonel Brizola&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1989.

In his final days, nearly penniless, Prestes was largely supported by architect Oscar Niemeyer, a long-time communist sympathizer and designer of many buildings in Brasília. Prestes died of a heart attack on March 7, 1990, aged 92.

<text>Franglais () or Frenglish ( ) is a French blend that referred first to the overuse of English words by French speakers and later to diglossia or the macaronic mixture of French () and English ().

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Franglais&quot; was first attested in French in 1959, but it was popularised by the academic, novelist, and critic René Étiemble in his denunciation of the overuse of English words in French, published in 1964. Earlier than the French term was the English label &quot;Frenglish&quot;, first recorded in 1937. Other colloquial blends for French-influenced English include &quot;Franglish&quot; (recorded from 1967), &quot;Frenchlish&quot; (1974), and &quot;Fringlish&quot; (1982).

==English sense==

In English, &quot;Franglais&quot; means a combination of English and French. It evokes the linguistic concepts of mixed language and barbarism. Reasons for this blend could be caused by lexical gaps, native bilingualism, populations trying to imitate a language where they have no fluency (sometimes known as creoles/pidgins), or humorous intent. Franglais usually consists of either filling in gaps in one&#x27;s knowledge of French with English words, using false friends, or speaking French which (although ostensibly &quot;French&quot;) would not be understood by a French speaker who does not also have a knowledge of English (for example, by using a literal translation of English idiomatic phrases).

Some examples of Franglais are:
* &quot;Longtemps, pas voir.&quot;&#x27;Long time, no see.&#x27;
* &quot;Je vais driver downtown.&quot;&#x27;I&#x27;m going to drive downtown.&#x27; ()
* &quot;Je suis tired.&quot;&#x27;I am tired.&#x27; ()
* &quot;Je ne care pas.&quot;&#x27;I don&#x27;t care.&#x27; ()
* &quot;J&#x27;agree.&quot;&#x27;I agree.&#x27; ()

===In English humour===
Chaucer&#x27;s Prioress knew nothing of the French of France, but only that of Stratford-atte-Bow (&#x27;Cockney French&#x27;). Similar mixtures occur in the later stages of Law French, such as the famous defendant who &quot;ject un brickbat a le dit Justice, que narrowly mist&quot; (&quot;threw a at the said Justice, which narrowly missed&quot;).

Another example in English literature is found in &quot;Henry V&quot; by William Shakespeare. In Act 3, Scene 4, a French princess is trying to learn English, but unfortunately, &quot;foot&quot; as pronounced by her maid sounds too much like (vulgar French for &#x27;semen&#x27;, or &#x27;to have sexual intercourse&#x27; when used as a verb) and &quot;gown&quot; like (French for &#x27;cunt&#x27;, also used to mean &#x27;idiot&#x27;). She decides that English is too obscene.

A literary example of the delight in occurs in Robert Surtees&#x27; &quot;Jorrocks&#x27; Jaunts and Jollities&quot;:

The 19th-century American writer Mark Twain, in &quot;Innocents Abroad&quot; (1869), included the following letter to a Parisian landlord:

The humourist Miles Kington wrote a regular column &quot;Let&#x27;s Parler Franglais&quot; which was published in the British magazine &quot;Punch&quot; in the late 1970s. These columns were collected into a series of books: &quot;Let&#x27;s Parler Franglais&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Parler Franglais Again!&quot;, &quot;Parlez-vous Franglais?&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Parler Franglais One More Temps&quot;, &quot;The Franglais Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman and Other Literary Masterpieces&quot;.

A somewhat different tack was taken in Luis van Rooten&#x27;s &quot;Mots d&#x27;Heures: Gousses, Rames: The D&#x27;Antin Manuscript&quot;. Here, English nursery rhymes are written with meaningless French phrases which are meant to recall the sounds of the English words, and the resulting French texts are presented as a historical manuscript and given a pseudo-learned commentary.

Another classic is Jean Loup Chiflet&#x27;s &quot;Sky My Husband! Ciel Mon Mari!&quot; which is a literal translation of French into English. However, in this context, the correct translation of is &#x27;heavens...!&#x27;

In Monty Python&#x27;s 1975 movie &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, the French castle guard (John Cleese) orders, when King Arthur (Graham Chapman) does not want to go away, his fellow guards to &quot;Fetchez la vache.&quot; The other French guards respond with &quot; and he repeats &quot;Fetchez la vache!&quot;&quot; The guards finally get it: fetch (&#x27;the cow&#x27;), which they then catapult at the Britons.

==French sense==
In French, refers to the use of English words sometimes deemed unwelcome borrowings or bad slang. An example would be (also ), which is used in many French dialects which have no synonym; however, Canadians would use &#x27; (&#x27;the end of the week&#x27;) instead, although in France refers to the end of the work week, i.e. Thursday and Friday. also refers to nouns coined from Anglo-Saxon roots or from recent English loanwords (themselves not always English in origin), often by adding &quot;-ing&quot; at the end of a popular word—e.g., (&#x27;a car park or parking lot&#x27; is alternatively &#x27; in Canadian French, although means &#x27;the action of parking or the state of being parked&#x27; in European French); (&#x27;a campsite&#x27;); and (&#x27;shampoo&#x27;, but pronounced , not ), which has been standardized and has appeared on many French hair-care product labels since at least the 1960s. A few words which have entered French are derived from English roots but are not found at all in English, such as (&#x27;a makeover&#x27;), and (&#x27;a rugby player&#x27;). Others are based on misunderstandings of English words, e.g.: &quot;un &quot; meaning &#x27;a jog or a run&#x27; rather than &#x27;a pediment&#x27;; meaning &#x27;a tram&#x27;, not &#x27;a tram-track&#x27;. Still others are based on (with the apostrophe in both singular and plural) meaning &#x27;a lapel pin&#x27;; or meaning &#x27;a walkie-talkie&#x27; (hand-held, two-way radio). For those who do not speak English, such words may be believed to exist as such in English. However, in Canada, where both English and French are spoken, expressions such as and are not used.

Some examples of Franglais are in fact imagined or examples of words being adopted from one language into another in the opposite direction of what many people believe. People who have no linguistic training or do not bother to consult dictionaries tend to create and perpetuate such urban legends about Franglais. For example, many numismatists think that the French spelling of the English term &quot;piedfort&quot; results from an imagined reintroduction of an English misspelling. In fact, the spelling is found in French dictionaries as an alternative of and even as the only spelling given in the 1932–1935 edition of the and the etymology derived by professional linguists and shown in these dictionaries shows the change in spelling happened within French.

Owing to the worldwide popularity of the Internet, relatively new English words have been introduced into French (e.g. and , referring to either e-mail or an e-mail address). An equivalent for the English word &quot;e-mail&quot; derived from French roots was coined in Quebec French and promoted by Quebec government: &quot;&quot; (from ), and this term is now widely used there. The Académie française has also suggested the use of the abbreviation (from ) as an analogy with the abbreviation for &#x27;telephone&#x27;, to be used before an e-mail address; however, the term , which roughly approximates the English pronunciation of &quot;mail&quot;, is now used more broadly in France than that prescribed usage. Another example from French is the word . The equivalent of the English verb &quot;to look at&quot; in French is but the noun &quot;a look&quot; (i.e. the way that something looks or is styled) has become in French, such that the sentence &quot;This Pepsi can has a new look&quot; in French would be &quot;&quot;.

==In France==

After World War II, a backlash began in France over the growing use of English there. &quot;Corruption of the national language&quot; was perceived by some to be tantamount to an attack on the identity of the country itself. During this period, ever greater imports of American products led to the increasingly widespread use of some English phrases in French. Measures taken to slow this trend included government censorship of comic strips and financial support for the French film and French-language dubbing industries. Despite public policies against the spread of English, Franglais is gaining popularity in both writing and speaking.

In recent years, English expressions are increasingly present in French mass media:

* TV reality shows often use English titles such as &quot;Loft Story&quot;, &quot;Star Academy&quot;, &quot;Popstars&quot;, and &quot;Secret Story&quot;.
* A leading national newspaper, &quot;Le Monde&quot;, publishes a weekly article selection of &quot;The New York Times&quot; entirely in English and uses anglicisms such as &quot;newsletter&quot;, &quot;chat&quot;, and &quot;e-mail&quot; instead of French substitutions (/ for &#x27;chat&#x27; or for &#x27;e-mail&#x27;).
** Note that saying to a French person instead of Internet &#x27;chat&#x27; may confuse them, since refers in France to real-life conversation and is rarely used in an Internet context. The word &quot;&quot; (a blend of &#x27;keyboard&#x27; and &#x27;chat&#x27;) is hardly known outside of Canada. The word &quot;chat&quot; in writing can be confusing as well since it natively means &#x27;cat&#x27; in French; thus, the unique respelling is occasionally seen.
* In James Huth&#x27;s blockbuster movie &quot;Brice de Nice&quot; (to be pronounced as if it were in English), Franglais is used in a satirical way to make fun of teens and other trendy people who use English words to sound cool.

Most telecommunication and Internet service providers use English and Franglais expressions in product names and advertising campaigns. The leading operator, France Télécom, has dropped the accents in its corporate logo. In recent years, it has changed its product names with trendier expressions such as Business Talk, Live-Zoom, Family Talk. France Télécom&#x27;s mobile telecommunications subsidiary Orange SA runs a franchise retail network called . Its Internet subsidiary, formerly known as Wanadoo (inspired by the American slang expression &quot;wanna do&quot;) provides a popular triple play service through its &quot;Livebox&quot; cable modem. The second-largest Internet service provider in France is Free, which offers its &quot;freebox&quot;. Set-top boxes that are offered by many other providers are also following this trend (e.g. Neuf-box, Alice-box, etc.) and the word &quot;box&quot; by itself is gradually ending up referring to these set-top boxes.

SNCF, the state-owned railway company, has recently introduced a customer fidelity program called S&#x27;Miles. Meanwhile, Air France has renamed its Fréquence Plus frequent flyer program to Flying Blue. The Paris transportation authority RATP has also recently introduced a contactless smartcard ticketing system (like the Oyster card in London) called NaviGO.

Public authorities such as the Académie française and the Conseil supérieur de la langue française generally propose alternative words for anglicisms. The acceptance of such words varies considerably; for example, and existed before the English words &quot;computer&quot; and &quot;software&quot; reached France, so they are accepted (even outside France in the case of ). On the other hand, failed to replace &quot;weekend&quot; or &quot;&quot; (the latter being in current usage in Canada). The word , equivalent to &#x27;e-mail&#x27;, coined and used in French-speaking Canada, is gaining popularity in written European French. However, most French Internet users generally speak about &quot;mail&quot; without the prefix &quot;e-&quot;. Note that English words are often shorter, and they are usually coined first (the French alternatives are generally thought of only after the original word has already been coined, and then they are debated at length before coming into use). This is partly why they tend to stay in use.

Alternative words proposed by the Académie française are sometimes poorly received by a technologically aware audience and unclear to a non-technologically aware audience. The proposed terms may be ambiguous (often because they are coined based on phonetics, thus hiding their etymology) which results in nonsense (e.g. for CD-RW (literally &#x27;rewritable CD-ROMs&#x27;, despite &quot;ROM&quot; meaning &#x27;read-only memory&#x27;). Some words are considered uncool, for example, (formed by adding &quot;t-&quot; to &quot;chat&quot;) or (formed by writing &quot;DVD&quot; phonetically).

The use of English expressions is very common in the youth language, which combines them with wordplay. The letter &quot;j&quot; is thus sometimes humorously pronounced as in English in words such as (&#x27;youth&#x27;), rendered as /dʒœns/ and thus written , 

==In Canada==

===Quebec===
Quebec is the only French-majority province in Canada and the only &quot;de jure&quot; (but not &quot;de facto&quot;) monolingual jurisdiction. New Brunswick is officially bilingual, and the other provinces, while mostly English-speaking, are not officially English-only.

When a speaker uses calques and loanwords in speech which includes English or French words and grammatical structures in a combination, it is sometimes referred to as Franglais, or a mixed language. The &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; has examined this so-called &quot;linguistic mosaic&quot;.

Quebec French has longstanding borrowings from English due to the historical coexistence of two speech communities within Quebec (and especially around Montreal). Likewise, Quebec English, the language of the English-speaking minority, has borrowed many French words such as &quot;dépanneur&quot; (&#x27;convenience store&#x27;), &quot;autoroute&quot; (&#x27;highway&#x27;), &quot;stage&quot; (&#x27;internship&#x27;), &quot;circular&quot; (&#x27;flyer&#x27;, from the word , a circulated pamphlet), and many others . These are permanent and longstanding features of local usage, rather than the recent slangish improvisation by any speaker or affinity group with poor knowledge of the other language.

These expressions have mainly become part of a common tongue/register born out of mutual concession to each other. In fact, the substantial bilingual community in and around Montreal will occasionally refer to Franglais, usually after it is pointed out by an observer that someone has used various French and English words, expressions or prepositions in the same sentence, a surprisingly common occurrence in various spoken registers.

===Other areas in Canada===

Canadian French is French as it is spoken in Canada. Scholars debate to what extent language mixture can be distinguished from other mechanisms, such as code-switching, substrata, or lexical borrowing. A mixed language arises in a population which is fluent in both languages.

The word &quot;Franglais&quot; refers to the long-standing and stable mixes of English and French spoken in some towns, cities, and rural areas of other Canadian provinces: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Manitoba, and Newfoundland. Such mixing is used in the northern regions of Maine (U.S.) (see Chiac and Acadian French). It has been asserted that this mix uses approximately equal proportions of each language (except in Newfoundland), although it is more likely to be understood by a French-speaker, since it usually uses English words in French pronunciation and grammar.

Franglais is commonly spoken in French-language schools in Ontario and Alberta, as well as in DSFM (&quot;Division scolaire franco-manitobaine&quot;) schools in Manitoba, where students may speak French as their first language but will use English as their preferred language, yet will refer to school-related terms in French specifically (e.g. &quot;Let&#x27;s go to the &quot;, instead of &quot;Let&#x27;s go to the library&quot;). As many French schools and French immersion classes have a strict &quot;French-only&quot; policy, English or Franglais is used out of class, between students.

Because of bilingual product packaging, speakers and readers may form new pronunciations that become terms. For example, someone may pronounce the words on a package of strong cheddar and call it &quot;old fort&quot;.

===Mistaken and unstable usages===

Franglais, in the sense of mistaken usage by second-language speakers, occurs across Canada. An example of an anglicism turned Franglais is the mistranslation of English phrases into French by students who are unaware of the Canadian French word. For example, a hot dog is sometimes called when the French word is simply . (However, the Quebec government has itself promoted expressions such as for &#x27;hot dog&#x27;, and for &#x27;hamburger&#x27;, neither of which has gained widespread acceptance.) In some ways, confusion over which expression is more correct, and the emphasis that many immersion schools place on eliminating anglicisms from students&#x27; vocabulary, has promoted the use of Franglais. Franglais can also slowly creep into use from mispronunciation and misspelling by many bilingual Canadians. Common mistakes that immersion or bilingual students propagate include incorrect inflection and stresses on syllables, incorrect doubling of consonants, strange vowel combinations in their spelling and using combinations of prefixes and suffixes from English.

Recently, Canadian youth culture (especially in British Columbia and southeastern Ontario) purposely uses Franglais for its comical or euphemistic characteristics, for example, in replacing English swear words with French ones. Some English-speaking Canadians, especially Anglo-Quebecers and those in southeastern Ontario, euphemistically use the (i.e., religious words such as as expletives) rather than swearing in English.

===Pseudo-anglicisms===

There is a particular form of Franglish which consists of the adoption of English words with alternative meanings to their usage in English.

These are words like (&#x27;a scramble&#x27;, &#x27;a rush&#x27;, &#x27;a strong effort&#x27;), or (&#x27;a tan&#x27;, &#x27;the act of sunbathing&#x27;), made by adding the English ending &quot;-ing&quot; to a verb from French (e.g. &#x27;to force&#x27; or &#x27;to tan&#x27;) to form a new noun. These are slang or informal at best, and not widely accepted.

Another type of false anglicism comes from the shortening of an English name, keeping only the first word (while the important word is the last). For example, a dress suit is designated by the word , borrowed ultimately from &#x27;smoking jacket&#x27;. Yet the British use &quot;dinner jacket&quot; and Americans use &quot;tuxedo&quot; (or &quot;tux&quot;); in English, &quot;smoking&quot; is used only as a participle and as the gerund. Another example is the use of the word for &#x27;clapperboard&#x27; used in filmmaking.

They are either French constructions which mimic English rules, or shifts of meaning which affect borrowings.

==In Cameroon==

Cameroon has substantial English and French-speaking populations as a legacy of its colonial past as British Southern Cameroons and French Cameroun. Despite linguistically segregated education since independence, many younger Cameroonians in urban centres have formed a version of Franglais/Franglish from English, French and Cameroonian Pidgin English known as Camfranglais or Frananglais. Many educational authorities disapprove of it, and they have banned it in their schools. Nevertheless, the youth-culture argot has gained popularity and has a growing music scene.

==Elsewhere in the world==
Franglais is spoken in London, due to its large French-speaking population.

Franglais also thrives in communities where imperfect English–French bilingualism is common. The United Nations Office at Geneva is so named in an imitation of the French , rather than the expected &quot;&quot;in&quot; Geneva&quot;.

Another example is provided by the civil servants in European Union institutions (European Parliament, European Commission, European Court of Justice), based in bilingual Brussels (French and Dutch) and Luxembourg City (Luxembourgish and German). They often work in English, but they are surrounded by a French-speaking environment, which influences their English (e.g. &quot;I&#x27;m a stagiaire at the Commission and I&#x27;m looking for another stage in a consultancy&quot;, referring to internships).

==Songs==

* A notable song with substantial Franglais lyrics was &quot;(Si Si) Je Suis un Rock Star&quot;, written and recorded by Bill Wyman. The record reached #14 in the UK Singles Chart in 1981.
* The song &quot;Je Suis Une Dolly&quot; by Dolly Rockers references French culture whilst singing to a Frenchman.
* The song &quot;For Me, for Me, Formidable&quot; by Charles Aznavour relates the struggle of a French singer trying to sing a love song to an English girl.
* The song &quot;I Want to Pogne&quot; by Rock et Belles Oreilles.
* &quot;It is not because you are&quot; by Renaud.
* &quot;I went to the market, mon p&#x27;tit panier sous mon bras&quot;, a popular Acadian song made famous by Gilles Vigneault.
* &quot;Michelle&quot; by the Beatles (&#x27;Michelle, ma belle, these are words that go together well: ma Michelle&#x27; and more).
* &quot;L&#x27;amour à la française&quot;, French entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007.
* Québécois musician Daniel Lanois has written many songs in Franglais, including &quot;O Marie&quot; and &quot;Under a Stormy Sky&quot; from his 1989 album &quot;Acadie&quot; and &quot;The Collection of Marie Claire&quot; from his 1993 album &quot;For the Beauty of Wynona&quot;.

<doc id="208042" wikidata="Q1474273" url="?curid=208042" title="Fungibility">
<text>In economics and law, fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are essentially interchangeable. In legal terms, this affects how legal rights (such as ownership and the right to receive goods under a contract) apply to such items. Fungible things can be substituted for each other; for example, a $100 bill (note) is considered entirely equivalent to twenty $5 bills (notes), and therefore a person who borrows $100 in the form of a $100 bill can repay the money with twenty $5 bills. There is no requirement to return the same $100 bill. Non-fungible items are not substitutable in the same manner.

Goods that are fungible are treated as commodities, and markets in commodities are active and liquid because of their fungibility. For example, gold is generally fungible because its value does not depend on any specific form, whether of coins, ingots, or other states. However, a unique item such as a gold statuette would not be considered fungible with the same weight of gold in some other form. Other fungible commodities include other precious metals and grades of crude oil. The legal recognition of fungibility is limited, and even very similar items, such as new cars of the same model and specifications, are not considered fungible with each other in law.

Many financial instruments, such as shares, bonds and currencies, are also fungible.

Fungibility refers only to the equivalence and indistinguishability of each unit of a commodity or other thing with other units of the same thing, and not to the ability to easily trade it for something else.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;fungibility&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;fungibilis&quot;, from the verb &quot;fungī&quot;, meaning &quot;to perform&quot;, via phrases such as &quot;fungi vice&quot;, meaning &quot;serve in place of&quot;. It is related to words such as &quot;function&quot; and &quot;defunct&quot;. 

== Use ==
===Finance===
Fungibility is different from liquidity. A good is said to be liquid if it can be easily exchanged for money or another good. A good is fungible if one unit of the good is substantially equivalent to another unit of the same good of the same quality at the same time, place, etc.

Notably, money is fungible: one US $10 banknote is interchangeable with any other genuine banknote like it. It is also interchangeable with two fives, ten ones, or any other combination of banknotes and coins adding up to $10.

On the other hand, diamonds and other gems are not perfectly fungible because their varying cuts, colors, grades, and sizes make it difficult to find several diamonds expected to have the same value. Packaged products on a retail shelf may be considered fungible if they are of the same type and equivalent in function and form. Customers and clerks can interchange packages freely until purchase, and sometimes afterward. After one opens the package and uses the product, however, it is usually considered unique and no longer interchangeable with unopened packages outside of exceptional circumstances, such as a return or exchange.

The traditional definition of a security, which includes shares, bonds and similar, is a &quot;fungible, negotiable instrument&quot;, where &quot;instrument&quot; refers to its status as a legal document and &quot;negotiable&quot; means that the owner can transfer it with good title, even though it itself may have had defective title. 

==== Cryptocurrency ====
Cryptocurrencies are usually considered to be fungible assets, where one coin is equivalent to another. However, after a major breach in Japanese exchange Coincheck, token developers for cryptocurrency NEM added a special flag to hacked coins to indicate they are not to be traded or used.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are similar to units of blockchain currency, except that they are connected to unique digital files, so that individual tokens can be considered to have a meaningful distinction from others. This distinguishability allows NFTs to have unique use cases, such as their use as blockchain gaming assets, digital collectibles, to indicating ownership of fine art or real assets, used to facilitate decentralized finance loans, and to earn reward tokens.

===Tasking===
Fungibility has been used to describe certain types of tasks that can be broken down into interchangeable pieces that are easily parallelized and are not interdependent on the other pieces. For example: If a worker can hand dig one meter of a ditch in a day, and a ten-meter ditch needs to be dug, that worker can either be given ten days to complete the entire project or nine more workers can be hired for a single day. Each worker can complete their piece of the project without interfering with the other workers, and more importantly, each worker is not &quot;dependent&quot; on the results of any of the other workers to complete their share of the total project.

On the other hand, non-fungible tasks tend to be highly serial in nature and require the completion of earlier steps before later steps can even be started. As an example of a serial task that is &quot;not&quot; fungible, suppose there was a group of nine newly pregnant women. After one month, these women would have experienced a total of nine months of pregnancy, but a complete baby would not have been formed.

===Quantum physics===
Oxford University theoretical physicist David Deutsch has adopted the term &quot;fungible&quot; to describe the physical nature of quantum particles and universes within the quantum multiverse, where, by virtue of being identical in all respects, different particles chaotically divide or combine as a result of physical interactions from a common fungible fund in superposition.

===Law===
====United States====

In legal disputes in the United States, when one party is compelled to remedy another party as the result of a ruling or adjudication, the appropriate legal remedy may depend on the fungibility of the underlying right, obligation or property interest that is intended to be restored. Depending on whether the interests of the aggrieved party are fungible, a determination made by the trier of fact, the appropriate remedy may change. For example, a court may require specific performance (an equitable remedy) as a remedy for breach of contract, instead of the more favored remedy of monetary damages.

====Belgium====
Belgium has adopted fungibility for its domestic central securities depository CIK (later Euroclear Belgium), which was set up in 1967–1968. According to royal decree No. 62, issued on 10 November 1967, depositors of fungible securities have the rights of co-ownership. This change was fundamental to the development of Euroclear, by then beginning to process Eurobonds and build systems.

<doc id="208051" wikidata="Q11860480" url="?curid=208051" title="Gillian Ayres">
<text>Gillian Ayres (3 February 1930 – 11 April 2018) was an English painter. She is best known for abstract painting and printmaking using vibrant colours, which earned her a Turner Prize nomination.

==Early life and education==
Gillian Ayres was born to Florence and Stephen Ayres on 3 February 1930 in Barnes, London, the youngest of three sisters. She started school when she was six. Her parents, a prosperous couple who owned a hatmaking factory, sent her to Ibstock, a progressive school in Roehampton run on Fröbel principles.

In 1941, Ayres was sent to Colet Court, the junior school for St Paul&#x27;s, Hammersmith. She passed the entrance exam for St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School the following year, and developed an interest in art while there. Among her schoolfriends was Shirley Williams, with whom she taught art to children in bomb-damaged parts of London.

Ayres then decided to go to art school. In 1946, she applied to the Slade School of Fine Art and was accepted. However, at sixteen, she was too young to enroll. She was advised to apply to the Camberwell School of Art and studied there from 1946 to 1950.

==Teaching==
Gillian Ayres worked part-time at the AIA Gallery in Soho from 1951-59 before starting a teaching career. She held a number of teaching posts through the 1960s and 1970s, becoming friends with painters such as Howard Hodgkin, Robyn Denny and Roger Hilton. In 1959, she was asked to teach at Bath Academy of Art, Corsham, for six weeks. She remained on the teaching staff until 1965.

For much of her time at Corsham she shared a teaching studio with Malcolm Hughes. She was a senior lecturer at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art, London, from 1965 to 1978 and became head of painting at Winchester School of Art in 1978, the first female teacher in the UK to hold such a position. She left teaching in 1981, and moved to an old rectory on the Llyn Peninsula in north-west Wales to become a full-time painter.

===Painting===

Gillian Ayres&#x27; early works are typically made with thin vinyl paint in a limited number of colours arranged in relatively simple forms, but later works in oil paint are more exuberant and very colourful, with a thick impasto being used. 

One of Ayres&#x27; early projects was a 1957 commission by architect Michael Greenwood to decorate the South Hampstead High School dining hall in north London. The murals, described as &quot;the only true British contribution to American abstract expressionism&quot;, were quickly covered over with wallpaper before being rediscovered in 1983 in nearly perfect condition.

The titles of her paintings, such as &quot;Anthony and Cleopatra&quot; (1982), &quot;A Midsummer Night&quot; (1990) and &quot;Gyre and Gimble&quot; (2013), were usually given after the painting is completed and do not directly describe the content of the painting, but rather are intended to resonate with the general mood of the work.

===Printmaking===
Ayres was a dedicated printmaker, making prints with Jack Shirreff in Wiltshire, and in her later life with Peter Kosowicz at Thumbprint Editions, London. Ayres made her first print project, a group of three etchings, with the Alan Cristea Gallery in 1998. The Alan Cristea Gallery went on to present her works in seven solo exhibitions at the gallery, and numerous group exhibitions, and at art fairs around the world. Several of her solo exhibitions toured to institutes in the UK, and the gallery worked in partnership with institutions and museums, including Jerwood Gallery, Hastings (2010), the National Museum Cardiff, Wales (2017) and CAFA Art Museum, Beijing (2017) to bring Ayres’ work to wider audiences through major exhibitions of her paintings, drawings and prints.

===Solo exhibitions and collections===
Ayres had a number of solo exhibitions, the first at Gallery One, London, in 1956. Since 1980 she has been featured in over 25 solo exhibitions, including the Museum of Modern Art Oxford, Oxford (1981); Serpentine Gallery, London (1983); Royal Academy of Arts, London (1997); Southampton City Art Gallery (2005); Jerwood Gallery (2010); National Museum Wales, Cardiff (2017) and CAFA Art Museum, Beijing (2017). Her art is also featured in the collections of numerous galleries, including Tate Gallery, London; Victoria and Albert Museum, London; Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester; Swindon Museum and Art Gallery; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Yale Center for British Art, New Haven and the Museum of Modern Art, New York.

In 2023 her work was included in the exhibition &quot;Action, Gesture, Paint: Women Artists and Global Abstraction 1940-1970&quot; at the Whitechapel Gallery in London.

===Awards===
Ayres was awarded the Japan International Art Promotion Association Award in 1963, and in 1975 she was awarded a bursary by the Arts Council of Great Britain. In 1982 she was named runner up for the John Moores Painting Prize and shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 1989.

She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1986, and in 1991 became a Royal Academician. She later temporarily resigned from the Academy, following the broadcast of a BBC &quot;Omnibus&quot; television documentary about the preparations for the controversial &quot;Sensation&quot; exhibition hosted by the Academy in 1997 show-casing the Young British Artists. The documentary, according to Ayres, presented an unfair view of the older members of the Academy. She objected to the inclusion of Marcus Harvey&#x27;s portrait of serial killer Myra Hindley in the exhibition.

She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours.

===Momart fire (2004)===

On 24 May 2004, 14 of Ayres&#x27; pieces were destroyed in a fire at a warehouse of the art-storage company Momart in the Cromwell industrial estate in Leyton, east London.

==Personal life==
Ayres married the painter Henry Mundy in 1951. They divorced in 1976, but continued to live together. They had two sons. The couple lived with their younger son, also a painter.

In 1987, Ayres moved from Wales to a 15th-century cottage at Morwenstow, on the Devon–Cornwall border. In the late 1970s, Ayres suffered from pancreatitis and was comatose for four days. In 2003, she suffered a heart attack.

==Death==
Ayres died in hospital in North Devon on 11 April 2018, aged 88. Upon her death, she was described as &quot;immensely courageous, independent and determined in both her art and her lifestyle&quot; by the Alan Cristea Gallery, who represented her for twenty years. Her work was shown posthumously, alongside that of Rachel Jones and Nao Matsunaga in 2019 at the New Art Centre, Salisbury, Wiltshire.

<text>The meerkat (Suricata suricatta) or suricate is a small mongoose found in southern Africa. It is characterised by a broad head, large eyes, a pointed snout, long legs, a thin tapering tail, and a brindled coat pattern. The head-and-body length is around , and the weight is typically between . The coat is light grey to yellowish-brown with alternate, poorly-defined light and dark bands on the back. Meerkats have foreclaws adapted for digging and have the ability to thermoregulate to survive in their harsh, dry habitat. Three subspecies are recognised.

Meerkats are highly social, and form packs of two to 30 individuals each that occupy home ranges around in area. There is a social hierarchy—generally dominant individuals in a pack breed and produce offspring, and the nonbreeding, subordinate members provide altruistic care to the pups. Breeding occurs around the year, with peaks during heavy rainfall; after a gestation of 60 to 70 days, a litter of three to seven pups is born.

They live in rock crevices in stony, often calcareous areas, and in large burrow systems in plains. The burrow systems, typically in diameter with around 15 openings, are large underground networks consisting of two to three levels of tunnels. These tunnels are around high at the top and wider below, and extend up to into the ground. Burrows have moderated internal temperatures and provide a comfortable microclimate that protects meerkats in harsh weather and at extreme temperatures.

Meerkats are active during the day, mostly in the early morning and late afternoon; they remain continually alert and retreat to burrows when sensing danger. They use a broad variety of calls to communicate among one another for different purposes, for example to raise an alarm on sighting a predator. Primarily insectivorous, meerkats feed heavily on beetles and lepidopterans, arthropods, amphibians, small birds, reptiles, and plant material in their diet.

Commonly living in arid, open habitats with little woody vegetation, meerkats occur in southwestern Botswana, western and southern Namibia, and northern and western South Africa; the range barely extends into southwestern Angola. With no significant threats to the population, the meerkat is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Meerkats are widely depicted in television, movies and other media.

==Etymology==
The word &#x27;meerkat&#x27; derives from the Afrikaans language. The origin of the name is uncertain, giving rise to a number of theories, including:
*The provincial Dutch / colloquial Afrikaans word &quot;mier&quot; meaning &#x27;ant&#x27; and &quot;kat&quot;, which means &#x27;cat&#x27;, hence an &#x27;ant cat&#x27; referring to the meerkat&#x27;s preying on ants and termites.
*A Dutch name for a kind of monkey, proposed to come from the Old High German &quot;mericazza&quot; and to be related to the similar (&quot;markat&quot;, or &quot;monkey&quot;), deriving from Sanskrit. The Germanic origin of the word though long predates any known connections to India. The name was used for small mammals in South Africa from 1801 onward, possibly because the Dutch colonialists used the name in reference to many burrowing animals. The name for the meerkat is &#x27;suricate&#x27;, possibly deriving from the French &#x27;surikate&#x27;.
*A combination of &quot;meer&quot; (&#x27;lake&#x27;) and &quot;kat&quot; (&#x27;cat&#x27;); albeit that meerkats are dry land creatures.

In Afrikaans the meerkat is called &quot;graatjiemeerkat&quot; or &quot;stokstertmeerkat&quot;; the term &quot;mierkatte&quot; or &quot;meerkatte&quot; can refer to both the meerkat and the yellow mongoose ().

==Taxonomy==

In 1776, Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber described a meerkat from the Cape of Good Hope, giving it the scientific name &quot;Viverra suricatta&quot;. The generic name &quot;Suricata&quot; was proposed by Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest in 1804, who also described a zoological specimen from the Cape of Good Hope. The present scientific name &quot;Suricata suricatta&quot; was first used by Oldfield Thomas and Harold Schwann in 1905 when they described a specimen collected at Wakkerstroom. They suggested there were four local meerkat races in the Cape and Deelfontein, Grahamstown, Orange River Colony and southern Transvaal, and Klipfontein respectively. Several zoological specimens were described between the late 18th and 20th centuries, of which three are recognised as valid subspecies:

*&quot;S. s. suricatta&quot; occurs in southern Namibia, southern Botswana, and South Africa.
*&quot;S. s. majoriae&quot; occurs in central and northwestern Namibia.
*&quot;S. s. iona&quot; occurs in southwestern Angola.

==Phylogeny and evolution==
Meerkat fossils dating back to have been excavated in various locations in South Africa. A 2009 phylogenetic study of the family Herpestidae suggests it split into two lineages around the Early Miocene (25.4–18.2 mya)—eusocial and solitary mongooses. The meerkat belongs to the monophyletic eusocial mongoose clade along with several other African mongooses: &quot;Crossarchus&quot; (kusimanse), &quot;Helogale&quot; (dwarf mongoose), &quot;Liberiictis&quot; (Liberian mongoose) and &quot;Mungos&quot; (banded mongoose). The solitary mongoose lineage comprises two clades including species such as Meller&#x27;s mongoose (&quot;Rhynchogale melleri&quot;) and the yellow mongoose (&quot;Cynictis penicillata&quot;). The meerkat genetically diverged from the rest of the clade 22.6–15.6 mya. The phylogenetic relationships of the meerkat are depicted as follows:

==Characteristics==

The meerkat is a small mongoose of slim build characterised by a broad head, large eyes, a pointed snout, long legs, a thin tapering tail and a brindled coat pattern. It is smaller than most other mongooses except the dwarf mongooses (genus &quot;Helogale&quot;) and possibly &quot;Galerella&quot; species. The head-and-body length is around , and the weight has been recorded to be between without much variation between the sexes (though some dominant females can be heavier than the rest). The soft coat is light grey to yellowish brown with alternate, poorly-defined light and dark bands on the back. Individuals from the southern part of the range tend to be darker. The guard hairs, light at the base, have two dark rings and are tipped with black or silvery white; several such hairs aligned together give rise to the coat pattern. These hairs are typically between , but measure on the flanks. Its head is mostly white and the underparts are covered sparsely with dark reddish-brown fur, with the dark skin underneath showing through. The eyes, in sockets covering over 20% of the skull length, are capable of binocular vision. The slim, yellowish tail, unlike the bushy tails of many other mongooses, measures , and is tipped with black. Females have six nipples. The meerkat looks similar to two sympatric species—the banded and the yellow mongooses. The meerkat can be told apart from the banded mongoose by its smaller size, shorter tail and bigger eyes relative to the head; the yellow mongoose differs in having a bushy tail and lighter coat with an inner layer of yellow fur under the normal brown fur.

The meerkat has 36 teeth with the dental formula of . It is well adapted for digging, movement through tunnels and standing erect, though it is not as capable of running and climbing. The big, sharp and curved foreclaws (slightly longer than the hindclaws) are highly specialised among the feliforms, and enable the meerkat to dig efficiently. The black, crescent-like ears can be closed to prevent the entry of dirt and debris while digging. The tail is used to balance when standing upright. Digitigrade, the meerkat has four digits on each foot with thick pads underneath.

The meerkat has a specialised thermoregulation system that helps it survive in its harsh desert habitat. A study showed that its body temperature follows a diurnal rhythm, averaging during the day and at night. As the body temperature falls below the thermoneutral zone, determined to be , the heart rate and oxygen consumption plummet; perspiration increases sharply at temperatures above this range. Additionally, it has a basal metabolic rate remarkably lower than other carnivores, which helps in conserving water, surviving on lower amounts of food and decreasing heat output from metabolic processes. During winter, it balances heat loss by increasing the metabolic heat generation and other methods such as sunbathing.

==Ecology and behaviour==
The meerkat is a social mammal, forming packs of two to 30 individuals each comprising nearly equal numbers of either sex and multiple family units of pairs and their offspring. Members of a pack take turns at jobs such as looking after pups and keeping a lookout for predators. Meerkats are a cooperatively breeding species—typically the dominant &#x27;breeders&#x27; in a pack produce offspring, and the nonbreeding, subordinate &#x27;helpers&#x27; provide altruistic care for the pups. This division of labour is not as strictly defined as it is in specialised eusocial species, such as the breeder-worker distinction in ants. Moreover, meerkats have a clear dominance hierarchy with older individuals having a higher social status. A study showed that dominant individuals can contribute more to offspring care when fewer helpers were available; subordinate members increased their contributions if they could forage better.

Packs live in rock crevices in stony areas and in large burrow systems in plains. A pack generally occupies a home range, large on average but sometimes as big as , containing many burrows apart, of which some remain unused. A 2019 study showed that large burrows towards the centre of a range are preferred over smaller ones located near the periphery; this was especially the case with packs that had pups to raise. A pack may shift to another burrow if the dominant female has little success finding prey in an area. The area near the periphery of home ranges is scent marked using anal gland secretions mostly by the dominant individuals; there are communal latrines, large, close to the burrows. Packs can migrate collectively in search of food, to escape high predator pressure and during floods.
Meerkats are highly vigilant, and frequently survey their surroundings by turning their heads side to side; some individuals always stand sentry and look out for danger. Vocal communication is used frequently in different contexts; for instance repetitive, high-pitched barks are used to warn others of predators nearby. They will generally retreat to their burrows for safety, where they will remain until the danger is gone. They stick their heads out of burrows to check the area outside, still barking. Mobs of meerkats fiercely attack snakes that may come near them. Raptors such as bateleurs, martial eagles, tawny eagles, and pale chanting goshawks are major aerial predators; on the ground, meerkats may be threatened by bat-eared foxes, black-backed jackals, and Cape foxes.

===Social behaviour===
Encounters between members of different packs are highly aggressive, leading to severe injuries and often deaths; 19% of meerkats die by conspecific violence, which is the highest recorded percentage among mammals. Females, often the heaviest ones, try to achieve dominance over the rest in many ways such as fierce competition or taking over from the leader of the pack. A study showed that females who grew faster were more likely to assert dominance, though males did not show such a trend. Males seeking dominance over groups tend to scent mark extensively and are not submissive; they often drive out older males in a group and take over the pack themselves. Subordinate individuals face difficulties in breeding successfully; for instance, dominant females often kill the litters of subordinate ones. As such, subordinate individuals might disperse to other packs to find mates during the breeding season. Some subordinate meerkats will even kill the pups of dominant members in order to improve their own offspring&#x27;s position. It can take days for emigrants to secure entry into other packs, and they often face aversion from the members. Males typically succeed in joining existing groups; they often inspect other packs and their burrow systems in search of breeding opportunities. Many often team up in &#x27;coalitions&#x27; for as long as two months and travel nearly a day on twisted paths. Dispersal appears to be less common in females, possibly because continuing to stay within a pack can eventually win them dominance over other members. Dispersed females travel longer than coalitions, and tend to start groups of their own or join other similar females; they aim for groups of emigrant males or those without a breeding female. Subordinate females, unlike subordinate males, might be ousted from their packs, especially in the latter part of the dominant female&#x27;s pregnancy, though they may be allowed to return after the birth of the pups.

===Burrowing===

Meerkat burrows are typically in diameter with around 15 openings, though one of dimensions with as many as 90 holes has been reported. These large underground networks comprise two to three levels of tunnels up to into the ground; the tunnels, around high at the top, become broader after descending around a metre. The entrances, in diameter, are created by digging at an angle of 40 degrees to the surface; the soil accumulated as a result can slightly increase the height of burrow sites. &#x27;Boltholes&#x27; are used for a quick escape if dangers are detected. While constructing or renovating burrows meerkats will line up to form a continuous head-to-tail chain, break the soil into crumbs with their foreclaws, scoop it out with their forepaws joined and throw it behind them between their hindlegs.

Outside temperatures are not reflected at once within burrows; instead there is usually an eight-hour lag which creates a temperature gradient in warrens, so that burrows are coolest in daytime and warmest at night. Temperatures inside burrows typically vary between in summer and in winter; temperatures at greater depths vary to a much lesser extent, with summer temperatures around and winter temperatures around . This reduces the need for meerkats to thermoregulate individually by providing a comfortable microclimate within burrows; moreover, burrowing protects meerkats in harsh weather and at extreme temperatures. Consequently, meerkats spend considerable time in burrows; they are active mainly during the day and return to burrows after dark and often to escape the heat of the afternoon. Activity peaks during the early morning and late afternoon. Meerkats huddle together to sleep in compact groups, sunbathe and recline on warm rocks or damp soil to adjust their body temperatures.

Meerkats tend to occupy the burrows of other small mammals more than constructing them on their own; they generally share burrows with Cape ground squirrels and yellow mongooses. Cape ground squirrels and meerkats usually do not fight for space or food. Though yellow mongooses are also insectivores like meerkats, competition for prey is minimal as yellow mongooses are less selective in their diet. This association is beneficial to all the species as it saves time and efforts spent in making separate warrens. Many other species have also been recorded in the meerkat burrows, including African pygmy mice, Cape grey mongooses, four-striped grass mice, Highveld gerbils, rock hyraxes, slender mongooses, South African springhares and white-tailed rats.

===Vocalisations===

Meerkats have a broad vocal repertoire that they use to communicate among one another in several contexts; many of these calls may be combined by repetition of the same call or mixing different sounds. A study recorded 12 different types of call combinations used in different situations such as guarding against predators, caring for young, digging, sunbathing, huddling together and aggression.

Short-range &#x27;close calls&#x27; are produced while foraging and after scanning the vicinity for predators. &#x27;Recruitment calls&#x27; can be produced to collect meerkats on sighting a snake or to investigate excrement or hair samples of predators or unfamiliar meerkats. &#x27;Alarm calls&#x27; are given out on detecting predators. All these calls differ in their acoustic characteristics, and can evoke different responses in the &#x27;receivers&#x27; (meerkats who hear the call); generally the greater the urgency of the scenario in which the call is given, the stronger is the response in the receivers.

This indicates that meerkats are able to perceive the nature of the risk and the degree of urgency from the acoustics of a call, transmit it and respond accordingly. For instance, upon hearing a terrestrial predator alarm call, meerkats are most likely to scan the area and move towards the source of the call, while an aerial predator alarm call would most likely cause them to crouch down. A recruitment call would cause receivers to raise their tails (and often their hair) and move slowly towards the source.

The complexity of calls produced by different mongooses varies by their social structure and ecology. For instance eusocial mongooses such as meerkats and banded mongooses use calls in a greater variety of contexts than do the solitary slender mongooses. Moreover, meerkats have more call types than do banded mongooses. Meerkat calls carry information to identify the signaling individual or pack, but meerkats do not appear to differentiate between calls from different sources. The calls of banded mongooses also carry a &#x27;vocal signature&#x27; to identify the caller.

===Diet===

The meerkat is primarily an insectivore, feeding heavily on beetles and lepidopterans; it can additionally feed on eggs, amphibians, arthropods (such as scorpions, to whose venom they are immune), reptiles, small birds (such as the southern anteater-chat), plants and seeds. Captive meerkats include plenty of fruits and vegetables in their diet, and also kill small mammals by biting the backs of their skulls. They have also been observed feeding on the desert truffle &quot;Kalaharituber pfeilii&quot;. Meerkats often eat citron melons and dig out roots and tubers for their water content.

Mongooses spend nearly five to eight hours foraging every day. Like other social mongooses, meerkats in a pack will disperse within of one another and browse systematically in areas within their home range without losing visual or vocal contact. Some individuals stand sentry while the rest are busy foraging. Meerkats return to an area only after a week of the last visit so that the food supply is replenished sufficiently. They hunt by scent, and often dig out soil or turn over stones to uncover hidden prey. Meerkats typically do not give chase to their prey, though they may pursue geckos and lizards over several metres. Food intake is typically low during winter.
===Reproduction===
Meerkats breed throughout the year with seasonal peaks, typically during months of heavy rainfall; for instance, maximum births occur from January to March in the southern Kalahari. Generally only dominant individuals breed, though subordinate members can also mate in highly productive years. Females become sexually mature at two to three years of age. Dominant females can have up to four litters annually (lesser for subordinate females), and the number depends on the amount of precipitation. Mating behaviour has been studied in captive individuals. Courtship behaviour is limited; the male fights with his partner, getting hold of her by her snout. He will grip the nape of her neck if she resists mounting, and hold her down by grasping her flanks during copulation.

After a gestation of 60 to 70 days, a litter of three to seven pups is born. Pups weigh around in the first few days of birth; the average growth rate for the first three months is per day, typically the fastest in the first month. A 2019 study showed that growth and survival rates of pups might decrease with increase in temperature.

Infants make continuous sounds that resemble bird-like tweets, that change to a shrill contact call as they grow older. Young pups are kept securely in a den, from where they emerge after around 16 days, and start foraging with adults by 26 days. The nonbreeding members of the pack help substantially with juvenile care, for instance they feed the pups and huddle with them for warmth. A study showed that nearly half of the litters of dominant females, especially those born later in the breeding season were nursed by subordinate females, mostly those that were or recently had been pregnant.

Sex biases have been observed in feeding; for instance, female helpers feed female pups more than male pups unlike male helpers who feed both equally. This is possibly because the survival of female pups is more beneficial to female helpers as females are more likely to remain in their natal pack. Some helpers contribute to all activities more than others, though none of them might be specialised in any of them. Sometimes helpers favour their own needs over those of pups and decide not to feed them; this behaviour, known as &quot;false-feeding&quot;, is more common when the prey is more valued by the meerkat.

The father remains on guard and protects his offspring, while the mother spends a lot of time foraging to produce enough milk for her young. Mothers give out shrill, repetitive calls to ensure their pups follow them and remain close together. Unable to forage themselves, young pups vocalise often seeking food from their carers. Like many species, meerkat pups learn by observing and mimicking adult behaviour, though adults also engage in active instruction. For example, meerkat adults teach their pups how to eat a venomous scorpion by removing the stinger and showing the pups how to handle the creature. The mother runs around with prey in her mouth, prompting her pups to catch it. Pups become independent enough to forage at around 12 weeks of age. Meerkats are estimated to survive for five to 15 years in the wild; the maximum lifespan recorded in captivity is 20.6 years.

Females appear to be able to discriminate the odour of their kin from that of others. Kin recognition is a useful ability that facilitates cooperation among relatives and the avoidance of inbreeding. When mating occurs between meerkat relatives it often results in negative fitness consequences (inbreeding depression), that affect a variety of traits such as pup mass at emergence from the natal burrow, hindleg length, growth until independence and juvenile survival. These negative effects are likely due to the increased homozygosity or higher genetic similarity among individuals that arise from inbreeding and the consequent expression of deleterious recessive mutations.

==Distribution and habitat==

The meerkat occurs in southwestern Botswana, western and southern Namibia, northern and western South Africa; the range barely extends into southwestern Angola. It lives in areas with stony, often calcareous ground in a variety of arid, open habitats with little woody vegetation. It is common in savannahs, open plains and rocky areas beside dry rivers in biomes such as the Fynbos and the Karoo, where the mean yearly rainfall is below . The average precipitation reduces to towards the northwestern areas of the range. It prefers areas with short grasses and shrubs common in velds, such as camelthorn in Namibia and &quot;Acacia&quot; in the Kalahari. It is absent from true deserts, montane regions and forests. Population densities vary greatly between places, and are significantly influenced by predators and rainfall. For instance, a study in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, where predation pressure is high, recorded a lower mean meerkat density relative to a ranch with lower occurrence of predators; in response to a 10% decrease in rainfall over a year, the density fell from .

==Threats and conservation==
The meerkat is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List; the population trend appears to be stable. There are no significant threats except low rainfall, which can lead to deaths of entire packs. Research has shown that temperature extremes have negative impacts on Kalahari Desert meerkats. Increased maximum air temperature is correlated with decreased survival and body mass in pups, perhaps as a result of dehydration from water loss during evaporative cooling or decreased water content in food, or from the heavier metabolic costs of thermoregulation on hot days. Higher temperatures are also associated with increased rates of endemic tuberculosis infection; this may be due to decreased immune function resulting from physiological stress, as well as increased male emigration rates observed during heat waves.

Meerkats occur in several protected areas such as the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park and the Makgadikgadi Pan. The Kalahari Meerkat Project, founded by Tim Clutton-Brock, is a long-term research project run by four different research groups that focuses on understanding cooperative behaviour in meerkats. It began in the Gemsbok National Park but was shifted to the Kuruman River Reserve in 1993.

==In culture==

Meerkats are generally tame animals. However, they are unsuitable as a pet as they can be aggressive and have a strong, ferret-like odour. In South Africa meerkats are used to kill rodents in rural households and lepidopterans in farmlands. Meerkats can transmit rabies to humans, but yellow mongooses appear to be more common vectors. It has been suggested that meerkats may even limit the spread of rabies by driving out yellow mongooses from their burrows; meerkats are generally not persecuted given their economic significance in crop protection, though they may be killed due to rabies control measures to eliminate yellow mongooses. Meerkats can also spread tick-borne diseases.

Meerkats have been widely portrayed in movies, television and other media. A popular example is Timon from the &quot;Lion King&quot; franchise, who is an anthropomorphic meerkat. &quot;Meerkat Manor&quot; (2005–2008), a television programme produced by Oxford Scientific Films that was aired on Animal Planet, focused on groups of meerkats in the Kalahari that were being studied in the Kalahari Meerkat Project. Meerkats populated an acidic floating island in the 2012 film &quot;Life of Pi&quot;.

<text>Everybody&#x27;s Autobiography is a book by Gertrude Stein, published in 1937. 

It is a continuation of her own memoirs, picking up where &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot;, published in 1933, left off. Both were written in a less experimental, more approachable style than most of her other work. 

In chapter four of this book is found the famous quote &quot;There is no there there&quot; which refers to her disappeared childhood home in Oakland, California.

<text>Earth &amp; Beyond was a science fiction massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by Westwood Studios and published by Electronic Arts (EA). The game was released in September 2002 in the United States. EA shut down &quot;Earth &amp; Beyond&quot; on 22 September 2004. It was the last game developed by Westwood Studios.

==History==
Development for &quot;Earth and Beyond&quot; – originally designated as &quot;Project G&quot; – began in 1997. By 2001, Westwood had created content for over 100 sectors of playable space. Public beta for the game began on 9 March 2002, allowing up to 100,000 new players to roam the sectors and test content. The finished game was launched on September 24 the same year. It was initially shipped in limited quantities to retailers to allow for smooth experience as new players sign on to the servers. In January 2003, the main story line and accompanying events began. This required all players to download a patch and wait for servers to be upgraded. This was the first of regular monthly story driven updates designed to gradually change the game environment as the plot unfolded. In June that year, players met a new race called the Vrix. This was a substantial update to the online universe, adding many more missions for higher level players and improving the intelligence of all NPCs in the game.

==Plot==
&quot;Earth &amp; Beyond&quot; was set some time around AD 2575. It featured three races: the Progen, Jenquai and Terran. The Progen were a genetically-altered and advanced race. The Jenquai were philosophers who sought eternal life. The Terrans were the original humans. Each of the three races had descended from the human race on Earth. The game&#x27;s storyline took place in the Milky Way Galaxy. The Progen, Terran and Jenquai were all uneasy of each other, but still managed to live together in peace. The Terrans were known for their extremely large corporations, such as Infiniti Corp. and GetCo. Infiniti Corp. was the manufacturer of the inter-system and inter-sector warp gates. The warp gates were originally created by the mysterious Ancients, an enigmatic and hyper-advanced race who had all but disappeared.

After two centuries of conflict, Humankind&#x27;s three races – the Progen, Terrans and Jenquai – had achieved an uneasy balance of power by dividing known space between them. The Terrans claimed Earth, headquarters to their massive trade corporations. The genetically engineered Progen, bred for perfection, commanded the wastes of Mars. The Jenquai, ever seeking knowledge, created great space stations to orbit the moons of Jupiter. Peace was shattered when the first stargate, an ancient artifact built by an unknown people, was discovered. Coveting its secrets for their own, the Jenquai hid the Gate from the other races, but their efforts were in vain; within months, a spy employed by the Terran conglomerate InfinitiCorp revealed the Gate&#x27;s existence to the outraged Terrans and Progen. Humanity was suddenly thrust into conflict, an epic battle over control of the Gate.

The three races fought a devastating nine-year war, dubbed the Gate War, using weapons far deadlier than any previously conceived. Millions of lives were lost, and millions more would have perished had the Terrans not surprised their foes with a sudden cease-fire proposal. After months of negotiations, the three civilizations agreed to share the Gate, and declared an uneasy peace, but InfinitiCorp had plans of its own. Under utmost secrecy, its scientists had reverse-engineered the Gate&#x27;s technology, and within a few years the mighty conglomerate announced to the astonished worlds the genesis of the Infinitigate.

Fifty years have passed since the invention of the Infinitigate. Progen, Jenquai and Terrans alike have thrived, spreading their civilizations across a dozen star systems, exploiting their riches. Though the races are at peace, acrimony remains. Tension and distrust govern galactic relations and every citizen fears the day when the spectre of war again raises its shadow.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Earth and Beyond&quot; was played by controlling either a humanoid or spaceship avatar in the third-person. Each game server, or Universe, consisted of 12 main star systems. Each system contained multiple sectors. Warp gates were used to travel from sector to sector, and system to system.

Players created a character by choosing one of the three races, and one of three professions: Warrior, Trader or Explorer. Characters gained three types of experience: Combat experience was gained through fighting and completing combat jobs (being incapacitated resulted in &quot;EXP Debt&quot; and the character would only receive half of the normal experience until the debt was repaid), Trade experience was gained from selling loot, by building items and by taking trade jobs, and Exploration experience was gained from visiting navigation points and exploration jobs. In general each system had a number of &quot;nav points&quot;. Visiting a nav point for the first time gave a certain amount of exploration experience. After a nav point was visited, it appeared on the &quot;radar&quot; when the player was in the system.

Player&#x27;s ships were constructed from a reactor, shield and engine. Optionally, a ship could have weapons or other devices that may buff or debuff other ships. Ship equipment could be reverse-engineered, rebuilt and enhanced. Player-made items could have better stats than dropped or purchased items, depending on the skill of the builder.

There were several varieties of boss spawns: Some were activated after a certain number of lower level monsters were killed, while others were time-based. For example, the Crystal Daeva, which produced valuable loot, had a spawn time of 72 hours. Nearly all bosses carried valuable and rare loot, which could be sold for significant amounts of cash on the in-game market.

Some sectors had areas where &quot;Invasions&quot; were staged. Sectors like Aragoth Prime contained a heavily defended Red Dragon base that was surrounded by multiple layers of defense turrets, carriers, battle cruisers, and frigates. Invasions often involved a multitude of clans joined to attack the base and a huge battle would ensue.

===New player zones===
Each race/class combination had its own starting sector. When a new character first logged onto the server they automatically appeared in the appropriate sector to begin the tutorial. The tutorial guided players through the basics of navigation, exploration, combat, and trade. Once the first set of missions was complete, the tutorial guided the player to a warp gate connected to their race&#x27;s home planetary sector.

===Leveling up===
The maximum level in &quot;Earth and Beyond&quot; was 150. It could take many months, even a year for casual players to reach the summit. To &quot;level&quot;, a player must gain experience. Each successive level required more and more experience points. There were three types of activities that reward experience points.

Exploration experience was the first type players saw after leaving their starting sector. Exploration experience is awarded by traveling to &quot;undiscovered&quot; navigation points on the map. The amount of experience gained from each Nav Point was capped, so lower level players received the most benefit from exploring the universe.

Combat experience was awarded by engaging NPCs in the game environment and defeating them. The amount of experience gained from each encounter was based on the player&#x27;s level and the level of the NPC that was killed.

When a player destroyed an enemy NPC, loot was dropped. Players could pick up this loot and sell it to NPC vendors for Trade experience. Players could also earn Trade experience by &quot;learning&quot; how to build their own components and items.

==Cancellation==
Electronic Arts closed &quot;Earth and Beyond&quot; servers on 22 September 2004 (known as the &quot;Earth and Beyond Sunset&quot;).

==Reception==
At the time of its release, the game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

&quot;Earth &amp; Beyond&quot; was a nominee for &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s &quot;2002 Best Massively Multiplayer Game&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call 2: Fallen Kings&quot;. It was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s 2002 &quot;Most Disappointing Game on PC&quot; award, losing to &quot;Civilization III: Play the World&quot;.

<doc id="208066" wikidata="Q235318" url="?curid=208066" title="Paula Rego">
<text>Dame Maria Paula Figueiroa Rego (: 26 January 1935 – 8 June 2022) was a Portuguese visual artist, widely considered the pre-eminent woman artist of the late 20th and early 21st century, known particularly for her paintings and prints based on storybooks. Rego&#x27;s style evolved from abstract towards representational, and she favoured pastels over oils for much of her career. Her work often reflects feminism, coloured by folk-themes from her native Portugal.

Rego studied at the Slade School of Fine Art and was an exhibiting member of The London Group, along with David Hockney and Frank Auerbach. In 1989 she became the second artist-in-residence, after the scheme re-started, at the National Gallery in London, after Jock McFadyen, who was the first in 1981. She lived and worked in London.

== Early life ==
Rego was born on 26 January 1935 in Lisbon, Portugal. Her father was an electrical engineer who worked for the Marconi Company and was ardently anti-fascist. Her mother was a competent artist but, as a conventional Portuguese woman from the early 20th century, gave her daughter no encouragement towards a career, even though she began drawing at age 4. The family was divided in 1936 when her father was posted to work in the United Kingdom. Rego&#x27;s parents left her behind in Portugal in the care of her grandmother until 1939. Rego&#x27;s grandmother was to become a significant figure in her life, as she learned from her grandmother and the family maid many of the traditional folktales that would one day make their way into her art work.

Rego&#x27;s family were keen Anglophiles, and Rego was sent to the only English-language school in the Lisbon area at the time, Saint Julian&#x27;s School in Carcavelos, which she attended from 1945 to 1951. St Julian&#x27;s School was Anglican and this, combined with the hostility of Rego&#x27;s father to the Roman Catholic Church, served to create a distance between Rego and full-blooded Roman Catholic belief, although she was nominally a Roman Catholic and lived in a devoutly Roman Catholic country. Rego described herself as having become a &quot;sort of Catholic&quot;, but as a child she possessed a sense of Catholic guilt and a very strong belief that the Devil was real.

==Education==
In 1951, Rego was sent to the United Kingdom to attend a finishing school called The Grove School, in Sevenoaks, Kent. Unhappy there, Rego attempted in 1952 to start studies in art at the Chelsea School of Art in London, but was advised against this choice by her legal guardian in Britain, David Phillips, who had heard that a young woman had become pregnant while a student there. He suggested to her parents that the Slade School of Fine Art was a more respectable choice and helped her achieve a place there. From 1952 to 1956, she attended the Slade School.

== Career ==
Although Rego was commissioned by her father to produce a series of large-scale murals to decorate the works&#x27; canteen at his electrical factory in 1954, while she was still a student, Rego&#x27;s artistic career effectively began in early 1962, when she began exhibiting with The London Group, a long-established artists&#x27; organization, which had David Hockney and Frank Auerbach among its members. In 1965, she was selected to take part in a group show, &quot;Six Artists,&quot; at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London. That same year she had her first solo show at the Sociedade Nacional de Belas Artes (SNBA) in Lisbon. She was also the Portuguese representative at the 1969 São Paulo Art Biennial. Between 1971 and 1978 she had seven solo shows in Portugal, in Lisbon and Porto, and then a series of solo exhibitions in Britain, including at the AIR Gallery in London in 1981, the Arnolfiniin Bristol in 1983, and the Edward Totah Gallery in London in 1984, 1985 and 1987.

In 1988, Rego was the subject of a retrospective exhibition at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation in Lisbon and the Serpentine Gallery in London. This led to her being invited to become the first Associate Artist at the National Gallery, London, in 1990, in what was the first of a series of artist-in-residence schemes organized by the gallery. From this emerged two sets of work. The first was a series of paintings and prints on the theme of nursery rhymes, which was taken around Britain and elsewhere by the Arts Council of Great Britain and the British Council from 1991 to 1996. The second was a series of large-scale paintings inspired by the paintings of Carlo Crivelli in the National Gallery, known as &quot;Crivelli&#x27;s Garden&quot; which have been housed in the main restaurant at the gallery prior to its temporary shutting to allow for the renovation works planned to renew the Sainsbury Wing in celebration of the National Gallery&#x27;s bicentenary in 2024.

In 1995, Rego used pastels to revise the story of Snow White in her drawing &quot;Swallows the Poisoned Apple&quot;. In her work, Snow White is pictured after she has eaten the poisoned apple and appears older and in some type of physical pain. She &quot;lays clutching her skirts, as if trying to cling to life and her femininity which are slipping away&quot;. This was done to show what a female goes through during the processes of life and ageing over the years, as well as showing the &quot;physical and psychological violation&quot; age plays in a female&#x27;s life. At the time the artwork was made, Rego was about 60 years old and her age did play a significant part in this artwork.

Other exhibitions included a retrospective at Tate Liverpool in 1997, Dulwich Picture Gallery in 1998, Tate Britain in 2005, and Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery in 2007. A major retrospective of her work was held at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid in 2007, which travelled to the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C., the following year.

In 2008, Rego exhibited at the Marlborough Chelsea in New York, and staged a retrospective of her graphic works at the École Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Nîmes, France. As well as her showing at Marlborough Fine Art in London in 2010, the art historian Marco Livingstone organised a retrospective of her work at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Monterrey, Mexico, which was later shown at the Pinacoteca de São Paulo in Brazil. In 2011, Rego appeared in the documentary &quot;Looking for Lowry with Ian McKellen&quot; as an interviewee, commenting on her experience with Lowry at the Slade School of Fine Art.

Rego was commissioned by the Royal Mail in 2004 to produce a set of Jane Eyre stamps.

In March 2017, Rego was the subject of the BBC documentary &quot;Paula Rego, Secrets &amp; Stories&quot;, directed by her son Nick Willing.

Rego&#x27;s work was included in the 2022 exhibition &quot;Women Painting Women&quot; at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. In 2023 some of her art was exhibited at the Pera Museum in Istanbul.

At the time of her death, Rego was represented by the Victoria Miro Gallery and the Cristea Roberts Gallery. Her work can be seen in many public and private institutions around the world. There are 43 of her works in the collection of the British Council, ten works in the collection of the Arts Council of England, and 48 works at the Tate Gallery, London.

A huge embroidery by Paula Rego (250 × 650 centimeters) depicts the Battle of Alcácer Quibir, which pitted the troops of King Sebastian I of Portugal against those of the Moroccan sultan Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik in 1578. The Portuguese were crushed, their king killed, and Spain took the opportunity to invade their country. The embroidery (commissioned to decorate a hotel in the Algarve, but refused by the client) was displayed at the &quot;Paula Rego. Jeux de pouvoir&quot; exhibition (Kunstmuseum, St. Alban-Graben 8, Basel, until February 2, 2025).

=== Women&#x27;s rights and abortion ===
Rego spent much of her career focusing on women&#x27;s rights and abortion rights. A critic of the anti-abortion movement, she used the theme of abortion as a focal point in much of her art. Rego opposed the criminalisation of abortion and said that the anti-abortion movement &quot;criminalises women&quot; and in some instances will force women to find potentially deadly &quot;backstreet solutions&quot;. She also stated that it disproportionately affected poor women, as it was easier for the rich to find a safe abortion (irrespective of the law) because they could afford to travel abroad for the procedure.

Rego created an art series called &quot;Untitled: The Abortion Pastels&quot; documenting illegal abortions in response to Portugal&#x27;s 1998 referendum on abortion. She began the series of ten pastels in July 1998, completing it over the approximately six months up to February 1999. The referendum aimed to legalise abortions although the law was not passed. Rego expressed a feeling of rage, pointing out the &quot;total hypocrisy&quot; of the outcome. The pastels show images of women in positions such as fetal, squatting, etc., either getting ready to have an abortion, in the process of having one, or in pain from the procedure. In a 2002 interview Rego stated:

&quot;The series was born from my indignation... It is unbelievable that women who have an abortion should be considered criminals. It reminds me of the past... I cannot abide the idea of blame in relation to this act. What each woman suffers in having to do it is enough. But all this stems from Portugal&#x27;s totalitarian past, from women dressed up in aprons, baking cakes like good housewives. In democratic Portugal today there is still a subtle form of oppression... The question of abortion is part of all that violent context.&quot;

The paintings were published in several Portuguese newspapers before a second referendum on abortion in 2007, which reversed the 1998 result; it is thought that the paintings significantly affected the result.

Rego used two typical tropes of Western art history: &quot;the gaze&quot; and &quot;the reclining nude&quot;. She utilised &quot;the gaze&quot; in conscious ways to challenge the viewer by having the woman or girl look directly at the viewer or away in agony or closing her eyes in pain. The &quot;reclining nude&quot; brings up the push and pull between sexual attraction, the act of sex and the physical outcomes like pregnancy and miscarriage that occur as a result of sex.

== Personal life and death ==
At the Slade School of Fine Art, Rego began an affair with fellow student Victor Willing, who was already married to another artist, Hazel Whittington. Rego had many abortions during their affair, starting from when she was 18 years old, because Willing had threatened to return to his wife if Rego kept their child.

In 1957, Rego left the UK to live in Ericeira in Portugal because she had decided to keep their latest baby. After the birth of their first child, Willing joined her there. They were able to marry in 1959 following Willing&#x27;s divorce from his wife. Rego had two daughters, Caroline &#x27;Cas&#x27; Willing and Victoria Willing, and a son, Nick Willing, with Victor Willing. Nick is a film-maker, who directed a television film, &quot;Paula Rego, Secrets &amp; Stories&quot;, about his mother in 2017. The Australian sculptor Ron Mueck is her son-in-law.

In 1962, Rego&#x27;s father bought the couple a house in London, at Albert Street in Camden Town, and Rego&#x27;s time was spent divided between Britain and Portugal. Her husband had several extra-marital affairs throughout their marriage, and some of his mistresses were depicted in Rego&#x27;s drawings.

In 1966, Rego&#x27;s father died, and the family electrical business was taken over by Rego&#x27;s husband, Victor, although he had himself been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, had no experience of electrical engineering or management, and spoke only limited Portuguese. Victor&#x27;s heavy drinking had worried his father-in-law, who had advised the couple to sell the business after his death and return to England. The company failed in 1974 following the Carnation Revolution that overthrew the country&#x27;s right-wing Estado Novo dictatorship, when its production works were taken over by revolutionary forces although Rego&#x27;s family had been supporters of the political Left. In response Rego, Willing and their children moved permanently to London and spent most of their time there until Willing&#x27;s death in 1988.

Rego was a supporter of the football club S.L. Benfica, of which her grandfather was a founding member.

She died after a short illness on 8 June 2022 at the age of 87 and was buried with Victor Willing in Hampstead Cemetery.

== Style and influences ==
Rego was a prolific painter and printmaker, and in earlier years also produced collage work. Her well-known depictions of folk tales and images of young girls, made largely since 1990, brought together methods of painting and printmaking that emphasised strong, clearly drawn forms, in contrast to the looser style of her earlier paintings.

In her earliest works, such as &quot;Always at Your Excellency&#x27;s Service&quot;, painted in 1961, Rego was strongly influenced by Surrealism, and particularly the work of Joan Miró. This shows itself not only in the type of imagery that appears in these works, but in the method employed, which is based on the Surrealist idea of automatic drawing, in which the artist attempts to disengage the conscious mind from the drawing process in order to allow the unconscious mind to direct the making of an image. At times these paintings verged on abstraction. However, as exemplified by &quot;Salazar Vomiting the Homeland&quot;, painted in 1960, when Portugal&#x27;s right-wing dictator Salazar was in power, even when her work veered toward abstraction, a strong narrative element remained in place.

There are two principal reasons why Rego adopted a semi-abstract style in the 1960s. First, abstraction dominated in avant-garde artistic circles at the time, which had set figurative art on the defensive. But Rego was also reacting against her training at the Slade School of Art, where there had been a very strong emphasis on anatomical figure drawing. Under the encouragement of her fellow student and later husband Victor Willing while at the Slade, Rego kept alongside her official school sketchbooks a &quot;secret sketchbook&quot; in which she made free-form drawings that would have been frowned upon by her tutors. Rego&#x27;s dislike of crisp drawing techniques in the 1960s revealed itself not only in the style of such works as &quot;Faust&quot; and her &quot;Red Monkey&quot; series of the 1980s, which resembled expressionistic comic-book drawing, but in her acknowledged influences at the time, which included Jean Dubuffet and Chaïm Soutine.

A notable change in Rego&#x27;s style emerged in 1990, following her appointment as the first Associate Artist of the National Gallery in London in what was effectively an artist-in-residence scheme. Her remit was to &quot;make new work that in some way connects to the National Gallery Collection.&quot; The National Gallery is overwhelmingly an Old Masters collection and Rego seems to have been pulled back towards a much clearer, or tighter, linear style reminiscent of the highly-wrought drawing technique that she was taught at the Slade. The result was a series of works that came to characterise the popular perception of her style, combining strong clear drawing with depictions of equally strong women in sometimes disturbing situations. Works such as &quot;Crivelli&#x27;s Garden&quot; had clear links to the paintings by Carlo Crivelli in the National Gallery, but other works made at the time, such as &quot;Joseph&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;The Fitting&quot;, drew from works by Old Masters such as Diego Velázquez, in terms of subject matter and spatial representation.

Rego gave up working with collage in the late 1970s, and began using pastels as a medium in the early 90s. She continued to use pastels up to her death, almost to the exclusion of oil paint. Among her most notable works in pastel were those in her &quot;Dog Women&quot; series, in which women were shown sitting, squatting, scratching, and generally behaving as if they were dogs, the antithesis of what is considered feminine behaviour. Paula Rego challenges traditional female depictions by illustrating women in their natural state of strength and power, showing the reality of womanhood rather than trying to satisfy the gaze of the viewer. Rego embraces sensational behaviors that are not necessarily considered to be feminine by social constructs, yet all people experience this humanistic feeling. The &quot;Dog Women&quot; series acts on the beauty of vulnerability, focusing on the raw aggression of erotic vitality that women have been restrained from outwardly expressing. Using pastels for an immense piece of work, Rego manipulates her medium by physically casting her emotional intensity as oil pastels allow her to showcase her violent passion. This and others of her works in which there appeared to be either the threat of female violence or its actual manifestation caused Rego to be associated with feminism. She acknowledged having read Simone de Beauvoir&#x27;s &quot;The Second Sex&quot;, a key feminist text, at a young age, and that this had made a deep impression on her. Her work also seemed to chime with the interest in Freudian criticism shown by feminist writers on art in the 1990s, such as Griselda Pollock, with works such as &quot;Girl Lifting up her Skirt to a Dog&quot; of 1986 and &quot;Two Girls and a Dog&quot; of 1987 appearing to have disturbing sexual undertones. However, Rego was known to rebuke critics who read too much sexual content into her work. Another explanation for her depiction of women as unfeminine, animalistic or brutal beings is that this reflected the reality of women as human beings in the physical world, rather than the idealised female type in the minds of men.

She used acrylic paint for &quot;The Vivian girls as windmills&quot; (1984, Centro de Arte Moderna Gulbenkian), inspired by Henry Darger&#x27;s &quot;In the Realms of the Unreal.&quot;

She went on to receive honorary degrees: a Master of Arts from the Winchester School of Art in 1992, Doctorate of Letters from the University of St Andrews and the University of East Anglia, both in 1999, the Rhode Island School of Design in 2000, the London Institute in 2002, and the University of Oxford and Roehampton University in 2005. In 2011, she was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Lisbon and in 2013 she was elected Honorary Fellow of Murray Edwards College, Cambridge, receiving an honorary doctorate of letters from the University of Cambridge in 2015.

She was appointed a Grand Officer of the Order of Saint James of the Sword by the President of Portugal in 1995 and a Grand Cross of the order in 2004, and was made a Dame Commander of the British Empire in the 2010 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. In 2019, she was awarded the Portuguese government&#x27;s Medal of Cultural Merit.

In 2009, a museum dedicated to Rego&#x27;s work and designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning architect Eduardo Souto de Moura, the &quot;Casa das Histórias Paula Rego&quot;, was opened in Cascais, Portugal, and several key exhibitions of her work have since been staged there.

Rego also won the MAPFRE Foundation Drawing Prize in Madrid in 2010. In 2017, she was one of the first five recipients of the Maria Isabel Barreno prize.

In 2022, she was posthumously made a Grand Collar of the Order of Camões by the President of the Portuguese Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.

<doc id="208067" wikidata="Q214107" url="?curid=208067" title="DuckTales (1987 TV series)">
<text>DuckTales is an American animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation. It originally premiered on syndication on September 18, 1987, and ran for a total of 100 episodes over four seasons, with its final episode airing on November 28, 1990. Based upon &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; and other Duck universe comic books created by Carl Barks, the show follows Scrooge McDuck, his three grandnephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and close friends of the group, on various adventures, most of which either involve seeking out treasure or thwarting the efforts of villains seeking to steal Scrooge&#x27;s fortune or his Number One Dime.

&quot;DuckTales&quot; has inspired video games, merchandise, and comic books, along with an animated theatrical spin-off film entitled &quot;DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp&quot;, that was released to theaters across the United States on August 3, 1990. The series is notable for being the first Disney cartoon to be produced for weekday syndication, with its success paving the way for future Disney cartoons, such as &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot; and &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, creating the syndication block The Disney Afternoon. The show&#x27;s popular theme song was written by Mark Mueller. Also, Launchpad McQuack later returned to appear in another Disney animated series, becoming a main character in &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;.

In February 2015, Disney XD announced the revival of the show, with the intention of rebooting the series. The rebooted series premiered on August 12, 2017, and concluded on March 15, 2021.

==Premise==
When Donald Duck decides to join the US Navy, he enlists his uncle Scrooge McDuck to look after his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Although reluctant to do so due to their hyperactivity, along with his continual pursuit of increasing his wealth and maintaining harsh business ethics, he eventually warms up to them upon seeing how smart and resourceful they are and takes them into his manor as well as several adventures. Scrooge McDuck is well known for his characteristic Scottish accent, spats, and top hat. We later learn in the series his family comes from Castle McDuck, and he came to America when he was young learning how to &quot;work smarter not harder&quot;. In addition to them, the show features frequent appearances by Gyro Gearloose, an established comic book character, as well as guest appearances by Donald in the first season – this was either a full appearance, or in a cameo scene when Scrooge and his nephews read letters he sends to them, and a few minor appearances by Scrooge&#x27;s old flame, Glittering Goldie, whose character was adapted from the comic books. The show introduced new characters to the Duck universe; while some were minor including the nanny Mrs. Beakley, whom Scrooge hires to babysit the nephews; Mrs. Beakley&#x27;s granddaughter Webby; Scrooge&#x27;s pilot Launchpad McQuack; Doofus Drake, an admirer of Launchpad and a close friend of the nephews; and the McDuck Manor butler, Duckworth. The second season later introduced three new additional characters as part of the show&#x27;s stories: &quot;caveduck&quot; Bubba Duck and his pet triceratops Tootsie; and Fenton Crackshell, Scrooge&#x27;s personal accountant who secretly works as a superhero named Gizmoduck.

The show&#x27;s primary villains consist of those from the comics: Flintheart Glomgold, who seeks to replace Scrooge as the &quot;richest duck in the world&quot;; the Beagle Boys, who seek to rob Scrooge of his fortune and often target his money bin; and Magica De Spell, who seeks to steal his Number One Dime. A few changes were made to these villains – unlike the comics, Flintheart is of Scottish descent and wears a couple of pieces of Scottish attire, including a kilt; Magica, who is Italian in the comics, has an Eastern European accent, always saying &quot;darling&quot; (which shocks Scrooge in an episode when Magica changes into the form of Mrs. Beakly). She has a brother named Poe, who was transformed into a raven; the Beagle Boys have individual personalities and are headed by their mother, Ma Beagle, who sometimes springs them from jail to conduct schemes with her, but always avoids being caught by the police. The animated series also featured a list of minor villains, most of whom sought to either claim Scrooge&#x27;s wealth or beat him to treasure.

Most of the stories used in the show revolve around one of three common themes – the first focuses on the group&#x27;s efforts to thwart attempts by various villains to steal Scrooge&#x27;s fortune or his Number One Dime; the second focuses on a race for treasure; the third focused on specific characters within the show. Although some stories are original or based on Barks&#x27; comic book series, others are pastiches on classical stories or legends, including characters based on either fictional or historical persons. &quot;DuckTales&quot; is well noted for its many references to popular culture, including Shakespeare, Jack the Ripper, Greek mythology, Ancient Egypt, James Bond, Indiana Jones, and Sherlock Holmes. After its first season, the show moved away from globe-trotting stories, with adventures focused mainly within Duckburg.

==History==
===Production===

Walt Disney Television Animation began production on &quot;DuckTales&quot; in 1986, intending to have it ready for a premiere in 1987, and its episodes airing within a 4–6 p.m. placement, at a time when more children would be watching television, rather than within a morning timeslot. Seeking to create a cartoon with high quality animation, in comparison with other 1980s cartoons which had much lower budgets, the animation was handled by Wang Film Productions (some 1987 and 1989–1990 episodes only), Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest Studio, Tokyo Movie Shinsha (season 1 only), and Burbank Films (1 episode only) having previously been used on two other Disney cartoons in 1985 – &quot;The Wuzzles&quot; and &quot;Disney&#x27;s Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot; – both of which had demonstrated better quality cartoons on TV than in previous years. Although the Japanese provided them with more available artists for the cartoon, this also increased production costs, due to the currency exchange rates between the yen and the dollar, though Disney intended to invest heavily in its &quot;DuckTales&quot;″s production, with plans to recuperate its money by having it syndicated via its syndication unit, Buena Vista Television, with a 2.5/3.5 syndicator/station ad split. While this was a concept that worked well with live-action TV reruns, it had only ever been used with inexpensive cartoon series in the past that either recycled theatrical shorts from decades past or only featured limited, low-budget animation, and thus had never been attempted with a high quality animated series, with the heavy investment considered a risky move.

===Broadcast===
The cartoon premiered worldwide between 18 and 20 September 1987 (the time and date varying between markets), with a television movie special entitled &quot;The Treasure of the Golden Suns&quot;, which was later split up into a five-part serial in future reruns. The first season, aired between 1987 and 1988, consisted of 65 episodes, the &quot;magic number&quot; requirement needed for a show to have weekday syndication (five days a week for thirteen weeks). Disney then commissioned three more seasons – the second season (aired between 1988 and 1989) consisted of two television specials entitled &quot;Time Is Money&quot; and &quot;Super DuckTales&quot;, with future reruns splitting them into two five-part serials; the third season (aired between 1989 and 1990) consisted of 18 episodes, with it forming an hour-long syndicated block alongside &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;; and the fourth season (aired during late 1990) consisted of seven episodes (including three unaired episodes meant for the previous season), which was used to form a two-hour-long syndicated block called &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot;, consisting of &quot;DuckTales&quot; and three other half-hour cartoons.

The cartoon continued running within &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot; until 1992. Following its departure from the Disney Afternoon, &quot;DuckTales&quot; reruns remained in syndication until 1995. On April 19, 1997, reruns began airing on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Animal Broadcasting Company&quot; Saturday Morning block, up until August 30, 1997. Two days later, on September 1, 1997, &quot;Ducktales&quot; began reairing again in a new syndication run. Reruns continued on the Disney Channel from October 1995 to 2000, where it was at first part of a new two-hour programming block called &quot;Block Party&quot; that aired on weekday late afternoons, with it returning to syndication between 1997 and 1999. Reruns were later shown on Toon Disney between 1999 and late 2004.

===Legacy===
The show proved an immense success for Disney, who decided to commission other cartoons with a similar level of quality, which included &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;, and &quot;TaleSpin&quot;. In addition, &quot;DuckTales&quot; also spawned its own feature-length movie, entitled &quot;DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp&quot;, which was released to theaters on August 3, 1990, along with a franchise of merchandising, including toys, comic books and video games, a spin-off series, and eventually a revival in 2017, that rebooted the series. In 1990, the same year the original show ended, Russi Taylor-the voice of regular DuckTales characters Huey, Dewey, Louie, and Webby- obtained more voiceover work outside of Disney when she began providing the voices of some recurring characters on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

&quot;DuckTales: Destination Adventure!&quot;, a DVD compilation release of episodes from the 2017 reboot, contains two episodes from the original series as bonus features: &quot;New Gizmo Kids on the Block&quot; and &quot;Ducky Mountain High&quot;. These episodes were available before their inclusion in the Volume 4 release.

The episodes are in the order that they originally aired (except for the five-part serial &quot;Treasure of the Golden Suns&quot;, placed at the beginning of Volume 2). None of the DVD sets contain any special features.

====International (Region 2)====
In the United Kingdom, Disney released one Region 2 volume in 2007, titled &quot;DuckTales First Collection&quot;. Despite the set being similar to the North American version, the DVD contained only 20 episodes, while having 5 language tracks: English, French, German, Spanish and Italian. Other regional versions were distributed to other countries, but only going up to episode #20. On November 12, 2012, the UK received two further releases of Collection 2 and Collection 3, being a Region version of the 2nd and 3rd volumes from North America. Unlike the first release, these 3-disc sets include a Fastplay mode, and only four language tracks: English, Dutch, German and French, but subtitles have not been added.

There are currently no plans to release the rest of the series, or the seven episodes missing between the first two sets.

====Hindi language (Region 2, 4, 5)====
In India where Duck Tales was dubbed in Hindi for TV broadcast on Doordarshan and syndication on Star Plus, 60 episodes out of the first 70 episodes from Seasons 1 and 2 were released by Sony DADC India under license from Disney India, on 20 DVD volumes and Video CDs in PAL format. These discs support Region 2, Region 4 and Region 5. However, due to a limited number of copies, they quickly went out of stock. Each DVD contained only 3 episodes. Episodes 08, 10, 11, 22, 23, 24, 36, 55 and 61 are missing from the released set. The remaining episodes starting from episode 70 to 100 (&quot;Super DuckTales&quot; from Season 2, and entire Seasons 3 and 4) are yet to be released in Hindi on DVD.

===Video on demand===
Season One of &quot;DuckTales&quot; was released on Amazon Video in 2013 and was free for Amazon Prime members but as of February 28, 2014, &quot;DuckTales&quot; Season 1 is no longer accessible through Amazon Video or Amazon Prime accounts.

As of December 11, 2015, some episodes from Season 1 have been made available on Netflix in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. In Denmark, at least, only 20 episodes from season 1 are available on Netflix. The episodes available do follow the correct airdate order but some episodes are simply missing. For instance, the episodes on Netflix do not include a lot of Season 1 episodes, even though they have indeed been dubbed into Danish. Amongst the episodes missing are the Five-Part Miniseries, &quot;Treasure of the Golden Sun&quot;, &quot;Duckman of Aquatraz&quot;, and &quot;Top Duck&quot;.

The entire series is currently available for purchase on Amazon Instant Video in Germany, with the episodes split into eight different seasons.

iTunes and Amazon Instant Video in the United States currently offer the entire series (except the episode &quot;Sphinx for the Memories&quot;) for purchase in SD format, split into six volumes at $9.99 per volume.

The series has been available to stream on Disney+ since its launch on November 12, 2019, however some episodes are out of order and the episodes &quot;Sphinx for the Memories&quot; and &quot;Launchpad&#x27;s Civil War&quot; are missing.

==Music==

The series theme song was written by Mark Mueller, an ASCAP award-winning pop music songwriter who also wrote the theme song to &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot;; Mueller was paid a little over $1,000 to write the tune.

Episode musical scores and background cues were written by at least four musicians. The primary and most known composer was Ron Jones, who wrote and conducted orchestral themes for the program. In contrast to how the other composers were creating a &quot;patronizing&quot; and &quot;cute&quot; score for the show, Jones says he composed the music with regard to the audience and its intelligence. &quot;I would not play the score like a kid&#x27;s show at all. If they went on an adventure I would play it serious like &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. Jones&#x27; score for &quot;DuckTales&quot; has been praised by fans of the show.

Three other musicians worked on creating incidental music cues for &quot;DuckTales&quot;. One musician, Stephen Rucker, also was in charge of conducting and composing tracks, much like Jones. The two other musicians, Steve Zuckerman, and Thomas Chase Jones, composed only synthetic cues for the show, and generally kept the tone lighter, as opposed to Jones and Rucker.

In total, there were approximately 85(?) incidental music cues composed for &quot;DuckTales&quot;. A track was played on different occasions on an episode, appropriate with the current ongoing situation. As of 2019, there has never been an official release of any of the background music on &quot;DuckTales&quot;.

The &quot;DuckTales&quot; Theme was sung by Jeff Pescetto. There are four different versions of the theme song. The original version, serving as the show&#x27;s opening theme, contained one verse, chorus, bridge, and then a chorus. A shorter version of the opening theme was used in The Disney Afternoon lineup with the line, &quot;Everyday they&#x27;re out there making Duck Tales, woo-ooh&quot;, taken out.

A full-length version of the theme song was released on the Disney Afternoon soundtrack, the third volume (which was released in a set with the other two volumes) in &quot;The Music of Disney: a Legacy in Song&quot; along with the full &quot;TaleSpin&quot; theme and in the November 2013 release of the &quot;Disney Classics&quot; collection. Also, it is heard in the end credits of &quot;DuckTales: Remastered&quot; and is also released on its official soundtrack.

The full version contains a second verse, and it includes a guitar solo, which is performed with a wah-wah pedal to make it sound like duck-like noises. It also has a fadeout ending, unlike the other versions. There is also a rare extended version that was used in the read-along cassettes in 1987. It has a sequence order of verse-chorus-bridge-chorus-instrumental break-chorus.

According to an interview conducted with Jeff Pescetto in 2009, he was originally approached by Mark Mueller to cut a demo version of the theme song for Disney&#x27;s approval. Although they were impressed with Pescetto&#x27;s demo, Disney had decided at first to hire pop group The Jets to perform the theme song for broadcast. However, after recording a version with the group, Disney felt that the theme song needed a different vocal style, and instead commissioned Pescetto to perform the theme. After performing on &quot;DuckTales&quot;, Pescetto would later be asked to sing the vocal themes for &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot; (composed by Mueller and produced by Alf Clausen), &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; (composed by Steve Nelson and Thom Sharp and produced by Steve Tyrell), and for &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot; itself. The Jets, meanwhile, later performed a full-length version of the &quot;Rescue Rangers&quot; theme song in a music video aired on The Disney Channel in 1989.

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
Maximilian Leunig of &quot;Collider&quot; wrote, &quot;This classic series brought along characters that hadn&#x27;t been in much media apart from comic books, notably written by Carl Barks and Don Rosa. Among these were famous villains like Magica De Spell, the Beagle Boys, and Flintheart Glumgold, to allies like Gyro Gearloose and Glittering Goldie. Of course, the show also created beloved partners like Launchpad McQuack, Gizmoduck, and Webby, who all brought fun and adventure to this Disney classic.&quot; Emily Ashby of &quot;Common Sense Media&quot; rated the show a 4 out of 5 stars, stating, &quot;&quot;DuckTales&quot; was a huge hit with fans during its four-year run in the &#x27;80s and continues to entertain today with quality stories, wild adventures, and classic Disney characters such as Scrooge McDuck and the dynamic trio of Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Because the stories often are set in far-flung places such as Greece, Antarctica, and the Klondike, kids are introduced to basic concepts of geography and diverse world cultures.&quot;

Jeremy Hayes of &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; ranked &quot;DuckTales&quot; 2nd in their &quot;Best Cartoons From The &#x27;80s&quot; list, saying, &quot;Arguably the greatest Disney cartoon show ever, the animation and voice acting really stand out (from what I&#x27;ve seen of this show). Often considered one of the most underrated cartoons ever, the show ran for four seasons after debuting in September of 1987.&quot; In January 2009, &quot;IGN&quot; listed &quot;DuckTales&quot; as the 18th best show in the Top 100 Best Animated TV Shows, writing, &quot;This was Disney&#x27;s first syndicated animated TV series and it paved the way for other hugely successful shows like &quot;TaleSpin&quot; and &quot;Chip n&#x27; Dale Rescue Rangers&quot;. It even created two spin-offs, &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; and &quot;Quack Pack&quot;. Disney made the smart move of taking classic characters like Scrooge McDuck and Baloo from &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; and giving them a late &#x27;80s reboot.&quot;

==== Theme song ====
The theme song, written by Mark Mueller, has been widely regarded as one of the most memorable for a television program, with Dan Fletcher of &quot;Time&quot; magazine noting its lasting impact despite being just a children&#x27;s song: &quot;Some of the lyrics might not make sense to those older than the age of 10 — we&#x27;re not sure how life in Duckburg is like a hurricane, or exactly what a &#x27;duck blur&#x27; is — but the DuckTales song is still awesome.&quot; An article from &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; noted that the song has a tendency to stick in someone&#x27;s head, a phenomenon known as an earworm. TVLine lists the theme song among the best animated series themes of all time.

===Accolades===
==Theatrical film==

&quot;DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp&quot; was released nationwide in the United States on August 3, 1990, by Walt Disney Pictures and Disney MovieToons, Disney TV Animation division and Disney France. The film follows Scrooge McDuck and his nephews as they try to defeat the evil warlock Merlock from taking over the legendary magic lamp.

The film was well received by critics and audiences, but was considered a financial disappointment by Disney and several planned sequels were abandoned as a result.

==Reboot==

In February 2015, Disney XD announced a reboot of the original &quot;DuckTales&quot; TV series. It premiered on August 11, 2017 and ran for three seasons.

In May 2015, Terry McGovern (the original voice of Launchpad McQuack) stated on Facebook that the entire voice cast would be replaced, stating he felt &quot;heartsick&quot; at the news.

==Merchandise==

===Books===
&quot;DuckTales&quot; releasing on the Picture Books from the part of &quot;Disney Gold&quot; and was Published by Kodansha.

===Comic books and trade paperbacks===
====&quot;DuckTales&quot;====
&quot;DuckTales&quot; had two series of comic books. The first series was published by Gladstone Publishing and ran for 13 issues from 1988 to 1990, and the second series was published by Disney Comics and ran for 18 issues from 1990 to 1991. Disney also published a children&#x27;s magazine based on the show, which also featured comic stories, one of which was written by Don Rosa. Subsequent comic stories were also printed in the magazine &quot;Disney Adventures&quot; from 1990 to 1996.

On August 29, 2007, Gemstone released a trade paperback of &quot;Scrooge&#x27;s Quest&quot; and on October 7, 2008, it was followed by &quot;The Gold Odyssey&quot;; together they collect the majority of the Disney Comics run.

====&quot;Carl Barks&#x27; Greatest DuckTales Stories&quot;====
On May 24 and July 19, 2006, Gemstone published a two-volume trade paperback, &quot;Carl Barks&#x27; Greatest DuckTales Stories&quot;. The trades contain reprints of stories written by Carl Barks which were specifically adapted into television episodes of &quot;DuckTales&quot;.

Both volumes start with an introduction and compare the original comic story with its &quot;DuckTales&quot; episode counterpart. Volume 1 also includes a two-page article delving into details on adapting the show from the comic series.

====BOOM! Studios revival====
On February 17, 2011, BOOM! Studios announced that a new &quot;DuckTales&quot; comic series would begin May 2011 under its BOOM! Kids / Kaboom! imprint. The series was written by Warren Spector (author of the &quot;Epic Mickey&quot; videogame) with art by Leonel Castellani and Jose Massaroli. It lasted for 6 issues, with the final two crossing over with &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;. The BOOM! Studios comic will be reprinted in IDW Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Disney&#x27;s Afternoon Giant&quot; in October 2018.

Before its updated &quot;DuckTales&quot; comic book, BOOM! Kids (later called Kaboom!) featured internationally produced &quot;DuckTales&quot; comic book stories never before seen in the US in issues 392–399 of the &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; comic book. These issues, published 2010–2011, were collected into two trade paperback volumes.

==International release==
The success of &quot;DuckTales&quot; led to the translation of the show into many languages. Featured together with &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot; in a Sunday morning program titled &quot;Walt Disney Presents&quot;, the show premiered in the former Soviet Union in 1991, the first American cartoon shown in the region after the Cold War. One year later, &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; was also added to this lineup.
However, the show&#x27;s theme song (written by Mark Mueller and originally sung by Jeff Pescetto) remained in English for several episodes. The first Russian version of the song was replaced midway through the series with an alternate rendition that contained completely different lyrics.

The series screened in New Zealand weekday afternoons on TVNZ. When TV3 started airing in November 1989 they took over the rights to Disney properties previously held by TVNZ, and as a result &quot;Ducktales&quot; was later repeated on TV3.

The series aired in India on Doordarshan, dubbed in Hindi. The title track for the original series was sung in Hindi by Amit Kumar. The features were dubbed and the episodes have voice cast of Chetan Shasital, Javed Jaffery, Rakshanda Khan and others. In many countries, the theme song was performed by well-known singers (like in Finland, where it was sung by Pave Maijanen).

In Spanish speaking countries of Latin America, the series was called &quot;Pato Aventuras&quot; (Duck Adventures). Scrooge McDuck is called &quot;Rico McPato&quot; and the nephews were translated as Hugo, Paco, and Luis, keeping the names of the translated vintage cartoons and comic books. In Spain, while the Latin American dub was used for the first broadcast, a high-quality local dub was produced afterward, keeping the local &quot;Gilito/Juanito/Jaimito/Jorgito&quot; names for the characters. In Brazil, the series was called &quot;Duck Tales: os Caçadores de Aventuras&quot; (Duck Tales: the Adventure Hunters).

In Italy, the series was called &quot;Avventure di paperi&quot;.

In France, the series was called &quot;La bande à Picsou&quot; (&quot;McDuck&#x27;s gang&quot;). The French name of Scrooge McDuck is &quot;Balthazar Picsou&quot;. Scrooge&#x27;s last name &quot;Picsou&quot; comes from a French expression &quot;Pique-Sou&quot; emphasizing Scrooge&#x27;s stingy behavior. Huey, Dewey, and Louie are called &quot;Fifi&quot;, &quot;Riri&quot; and &quot;Loulou&quot;.

In Hungary, the term &quot;&quot;DuckTales&quot; generation&quot; (&quot;Kacsamesék generáció&quot;) refers to the people who were born in the early to mid-1980s, because the death of József Antall, the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Hungary, was announced during a &quot;DuckTales&quot; episode in 1993. This was the generation&#x27;s first encounter with politics.

<text>Windows Server 2003, codenamed &quot;Whistler Server&quot;, is the sixth major version of the Windows NT operating system produced by Microsoft and the first server version to be released under the Windows Server brand name. It is part of the Windows NT family of operating systems and was released to manufacturing on March 28, 2003 and generally available on April 24, 2003. Windows Server 2003 is the successor to the Server editions of Windows 2000 and the predecessor to Windows Server 2008. An updated version, Windows Server 2003 R2, was released to manufacturing on December 6, 2005. Windows Server 2003 is based on Windows XP.

Its kernel has also been used in Windows XP 64-bit Edition and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition.

It is the final version of Windows Server that supports processors without ACPI.

As of July 2016, 18% of organizations used servers that were running Windows Server 2003.

==Overview==
Windows Server 2003 is the follow-up to Windows 2000 Server, incorporating compatibility and other features from Windows XP. Unlike Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003&#x27;s default installation has none of the server components enabled, to reduce the attack surface of new machines. Windows Server 2003 includes compatibility modes to allow older applications to run with greater stability. It was made more compatible with Windows NT 4.0 domain-based networking. Windows Server 2003 brought in enhanced Active Directory compatibility and better deployment support to ease the transition from Windows NT 4.0 to Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP Professional.

Windows Server 2003 is the first server edition of Windows to support the IA64 and x64 architectures.

The product went through several name changes during the course of development. When first announced in 2000, it was known by its codename &quot;Whistler Server&quot;; it was named &quot;Windows 2002 Server&quot; for a brief time in mid-2001, followed by &quot;Windows .NET Server&quot; and &quot;Windows .NET Server 2003&quot;. After Microsoft chose to focus the &quot;.NET&quot; branding on the .NET Framework, the OS was finally released as &quot;Windows Server 2003&quot;.

Windows Server 2003&#x27;s codebase was reused for the development of Windows Vista under its codename, &quot;Longhorn&quot;. Pre-reset builds of &quot;Longhorn&quot; were based on the Windows .NET Server Release Candidate 1 (3663) codebase, whereas post-reset builds of &quot;Longhorn/Vista&quot; after the development reset in 2004 are based on the works-in-progress Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 (3790.1232) codebase.

==Development==
Windows Server 2003 was the first Microsoft Windows version which was thoroughly subjected to semi-automated testing for bugs with a software system called PREfast developed by computer scientist Amitabh Srivastava at Microsoft Research. The automated bug checking system was first tested on Windows 2000 but not thoroughly. Amitabh Srivastava&#x27;s PREfast found 12% of Windows Server 2003&#x27;s bugs, the remaining 88% being found by human computer programmers. Microsoft employs more than 4,700 programmers who work on Windows, 60% of whom are software testers whose job is to find bugs in Windows source code. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates stated that Windows Server 2003 was Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;most rigorously tested software to date.&quot;

==Changes==

Several improvements and new features have been added to Windows Server 2003.

Internet Information Services (IIS) has been upgraded to v6.0. There have also been significant improvements to Message Queuing and to Active Directory, such as the ability to deactivate classes from the schema, or to run multiple instances of the directory server (ADAM). There was also a notable change in the ability to create a rescue disk, which was removed in favor of Automated System Recovery (ASR). Other Improvements to Group Policy handling and administration have also been made. For the first time in the history of Windows Server, a backup system to restore lost files has been created together with improved disk management, including the ability to back up from shadows of files, allowing the backup of open files. Another important area where improvements have been made are the scripting and command-line tools, with the improvements being part of Microsoft&#x27;s initiative to bring a complete command shell to the next version of Windows. Other notable new features include support for a hardware-based &quot;watchdog timer&quot;, which can restart the server if the operating system does not respond within a certain amount of time. On this version of Windows Server the Themes service is disabled by default, defaulting to the appearance of previous Windows versions (such as Windows 2000).

==Editions==
Windows Server 2003 comes in a number of editions, each targeted towards a particular size and type of business. In general, all variants of Windows Server 2003 have the ability to share files and printers, act as an application server, host message queues, provide email services, authenticate users, act as an X.509 certificate server, provide LDAP directory services, serve streaming media, and to perform other server-oriented functions.

===Web===
Windows Server 2003 Web is meant for building and hosting Web applications, Web pages, and XML web services. It is designed to be used primarily as an IIS web server and provides a platform for developing and deploying XML Web services and applications that use ASP.NET technology. Domain controller and Terminal Services functionality are not included on Web Edition. However, Remote Desktop for Administration is available. Only 10 concurrent file-sharing connections are allowed at any moment. It is not possible to install Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Exchange software in this edition without installing Service Pack 1. Despite supporting XML Web services and ASP.NET, UDDI cannot be deployed on Windows Server 2003 Web. The .NET Framework version 2.0 is not included with Windows Server 2003 Web, but can be installed as a separate update from Windows Update.

Windows Server 2003 Web supports a maximum of two physical processors and a maximum of 2 GB of RAM. It is the only edition of Windows Server 2003 that does not require any client access license (CAL) when used as the internet facing server front-end for Internet Information Services and Windows Server Update Services. When using it for storage or as a back-end with another remote server as the front-end, CALs may still be required.

===Standard===

Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Standard is aimed towards small to medium-sized businesses. Standard Edition supports file and printer sharing, offers secure Internet connectivity, and allows centralized desktop application deployment. A specialized variant for the x64 architecture was released in April 2005. The IA-32 variants supports up to four physical processors and up to 4 GB RAM; the x64 variant is capable of addressing up to 32 GB of RAM and also supports Non-Uniform Memory Access.

===Enterprise===
Windows Server 2003 Enterprise is aimed towards medium to large businesses. It is a full-function server operating system that supports up to 8 physical processors and provides enterprise-class features such as eight-node clustering using Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) software and support for up to 64 GB of RAM through PAE. Enterprise Edition also comes in specialized variants for the x64 and Itanium architectures. With Service Pack 2 installed, the x64 and Itanium variants are capable of addressing up to 1 TB and 2 TB of RAM, respectively. This edition also supports Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA). It also provides the ability to hot-add supported hardware. Windows Server 2003 Enterprise is also the required edition to issue custom certificate templates.

===Datacenter===
Windows Server 2003 Datacenter is designed for infrastructures demanding high security and reliability. Windows Server 2003 is available for IA-32, Itanium, and x64 processors. It supports a maximum of 32 physical processors on IA-32 platform or 64 physical processors on x64 and IA-64 hardware. IA-32 variants of this edition support up to 64 GB of RAM. With Service Pack 2 installed, the x64 variants support up to 1 TB while the IA-64 variants support up to 2 TB of RAM. Windows Server 2003 Datacenter also allows limiting processor and memory usage on a per-application basis.

This edition has better support for storage area networks (SANs): It features a service which uses Windows sockets to emulate TCP/IP communication over native SAN service providers, thereby allowing a SAN to be accessed over any TCP/IP channel. With this, any application that can communicate over TCP/IP can use a SAN, without any modification to the application.

The Datacenter edition, like the Enterprise edition, supports 8-node clustering. Clustering increases availability and fault tolerance of server installations by distributing and replicating the service among many servers. This edition supports clustering with each cluster having its own dedicated storage, or with all cluster nodes connected to a common SAN.

==Derivatives==

===Windows Compute Cluster Server===
Windows Compute Cluster Server 2003 (CCS), released in June 2006, is designed for high-end applications that require high performance computing clusters. It is designed to be deployed on numerous computers to be clustered together to achieve supercomputing speeds. Each Compute Cluster Server network comprises at least one controlling head node and subordinate processing nodes that carry out most of the work.

Compute Cluster Server has a built-in Message Passing Interface, the Microsoft Messaging Passing Interface v2 (MS-MPI) which is used to communicate between the processing nodes on the cluster network. Alternative MPI Stacks can also be used with the OS. It ties nodes together with a powerful inter-process communication mechanism which can be complex because of communications between hundreds or even thousands of processors working in parallel.

The application programming interface consists of over 160 functions. A job launcher enables users to execute jobs to be executed in the computing cluster. MS MPI was designed to be compatible with the reference open source MPI2 specification which is widely used in High-performance computing (HPC). With some exceptions because of security considerations, MS MPI covers the complete set of MPI2 functionality as implemented in MPICH2, except for the planned future features of dynamic process spawn and publishing.

===Windows Storage Server===
Windows Storage Server 2003, a part of the Windows Server 2003 series, is a specialized server operating system for network-attached storage (NAS). Launched in 2003 at Storage Decisions in Chicago, it is optimized for use in file and print sharing and also in storage area network (SAN) scenarios. It is only available through Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Unlike other Windows Server 2003 editions that provide file and printer sharing functionality, Windows Storage Server 2003 does not require any CAL.

Windows Storage Server 2003 NAS equipment can be &quot;headless&quot;, which means that they are without any monitors, keyboards or mice, and are administered remotely. Such devices are plugged into any existing IP network and the storage capacity is available to all users. Windows Storage Server 2003 can use RAID arrays to provide data redundancy, fault-tolerance and high performance. Multiple such NAS servers can be clustered to appear as a single device, which allows responsibility for serving clients to be shared in such a way that if one server fails then other servers can take over (often termed a failover) which also improves fault-tolerance.

Windows Storage Server 2003 can also be used to create a Storage Area Network, in which the data is transferred in terms of chunks rather than files, thus providing more granularity to the data that can be transferred. This provides higher performance to database and transaction processing applications. Windows Storage Server 2003 also allows NAS devices to be connected to a SAN.

Windows Storage Server 2003 led to a second release named Windows Storage Server 2003 R2. This release adds file-server performance optimization, Single Instance Storage (SIS), and index-based search. Single instance storage (SIS) scans storage volumes for duplicate files, and moves the duplicate files to the common SIS store. The file on the volume is replaced with a link to the file. This substitution reduces the amount of storage space required, by as much as 70%.

Windows Storage Server 2003 R2 provides an index-based, full-text search based on the indexing engine already built into Windows server. The updated search engine speeds up indexed searches on network shares. This edition also provides filters for searching many standard file formats, such as ZIP archives, AutoCAD models, XML documents, MP3 audio files, PDF documents, and all Microsoft Office file formats.

Windows Storage Server 2003 R2 includes built in support for Windows SharePoint Services and Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server, and adds a Storage Management snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console. It can be used to manage storage volumes centrally, including DFS shares, on servers running Windows Storage Server R2.

Windows Storage Server 2003 R2 can be used as an iSCSI target with standard and enterprise editions of Windows Storage Server 2003 R2, incorporating WinTarget iSCSI technology which Microsoft acquired in 2006 by from StringBean software. This will be an add-on feature available for purchase through OEM partners as an iSCSI feature pack, or is included in some versions of WSS as configured by OEMs.

Windows Storage Server 2003 can be promoted to function as a domain controller; however, this edition is not licensed to run directory services. It can be joined to an existing domain as a member server.

====Features====
* Distributed File System (DFS): Allows multiple network shares to be aggregated as a virtual file system.
* Support for SAN and iSCSI: Allows computers to connect to a Storage Server over the LAN, without the need for a separate fibre channel network, thus a Storage Area Network can be created over the LAN itself. iSCSI uses the SCSI protocol to transfer data as a block of bytes, rather than as a file. This increases performance of the Storage network in some scenarios, such as using a database server.
* Virtual Disc Service: Allows NAS devices, RAID devices and SAN shares to be exposed and managed as if they were normal hard drives.
* JBOD systems: JBOD (&quot;Just a bunch of discs&quot;) systems, by using VDS, can manage a group of individual storage devices as a single unit. There is no need for the storage units to be of the same maker and model.
* Software and Hardware RAID: Windows Storage Server 2003 has intrinsic support for hardware implementation of RAID. In case hardware support is not available, it can use software enabled RAID. In that case, all processing is done by the OS.
* Multi Path IO (MPIO): It provides an alternate connection to IO devices in case the primary path is down.

====Editions====
Windows Storage Server 2003 R2 was available in the following editions:
Windows Unified Data Storage Server is a variant of Windows Storage Server 2003 R2 with iSCSI target support standard, available in only the standard and enterprise editions.

===Windows Small Business Server===
Windows Small Business Server (SBS) is a software suite which includes Windows Server and additional technologies aimed at providing a small business with a complete technology solution.

The Standard edition of SBS includes Microsoft Remote Web Workplace, Windows SharePoint Services, Microsoft Exchange Server, Fax Server, Active Directory, a basic firewall, DHCP server and network address translation capabilities. The Premium edition of SBS adds Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and Microsoft ISA Server 2004.

SBS has its own type of CAL that is different and costs slightly more than CALs for the other editions of Windows Server 2003. However, the SBS CAL encompasses the user CALs for Windows Server, Exchange Server, SQL Server and ISA Server, and hence is less expensive than buying all other CALs individually.

SBS has the following design limitations, mainly affecting Active Directory:

* Only one computer in a Windows Server domain can be running SBS
* SBS must be the root of the Active Directory forest
* SBS cannot trust any other domains
* SBS is limited to 75 users or devices depending on the type of CAL
* SBS is limited to a maximum of 4 GB of RAM
* SBS domains cannot have any child domains
* Terminal Services only operates in remote administration mode on SBS, meaning that only two simultaneous RDP sessions are allowed

To remove the limitations from an instance of SBS and upgrade to regular Windows Server, Exchange Server, SQL and ISA Server, there is a Windows Small Business Server 2003 R2 Transition Pack.

===Windows Home Server===

Windows Home Server (WHS) is an operating system from Microsoft based on Windows Small Business Server 2003 SP2. Windows Home Server was announced on January 7, 2007, at the Consumer Electronics Show by Bill Gates and is intended to be a solution for homes with multiple connected PCs to offer file sharing, automated backups, and remote access.

Windows Home Server began shipment to OEMs on September 15, 2007.

===Windows Server for Embedded Systems===

Windows Server 2003 for Embedded Systems replaced &quot;Windows 2000 Server for Embedded Systems&quot;. Intended use was for building firewall, VPN caching servers and similar appliances. Variants were available with &quot;Server Appliance Software&quot; and with &quot;Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server&quot; 

Availability of the original version ended May 28, 2003. Availability of R2 ended March 5, 2006. End of extended support was July 14, 2015 (all variants except Storage Server), and End of Licence was May 28, 2018 (R2 and original). The End of Licence date is the last date that OEM&#x27;s may distribute systems using this version. All variants continued to receive Critical security updates until the end of extended support:

Release 2 for Embedded Systems was available in 32 and 64 bit variants, Standard (1-4 CPU) and Enterprise (1-8 CPU):

===Windows XP Professional x64 Edition===

Windows XP Professional x64 Edition was released less than a month after Windows Server 2003 SP1, and used the same kernel and source code tree. While many features of the 32-bit variant of Windows XP were brought over into Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, other limitations imposed by constraints such as only supporting 64-bit drivers, and support for 16-bit programs being dropped led to incompatibilities with the 32-bit Windows XP editions available. It later received a Service Pack update as part of the release of Windows Server 2003 SP2.

==Updates==

===Service Pack 1===
On March 30, 2005, Microsoft released Service Pack 1 for Windows Server 2003. Among the improvements are many of the same updates that were provided to Windows XP users with Service Pack 2. Features that are added with Service Pack 1 include:

* Security Configuration Wizard, which is a tool that allows administrators to more easily research, and make changes to, security policies.
* Hot Patching, a feature made to extend Windows Server 2003&#x27;s ability to take DLL, Driver, and non-kernel patches without a reboot.
* IIS 6.0 Metabase Auditing, a feature allows the tracking of metabase edits.
* Windows Firewall, which brings many of the improvements from Windows XP Service Pack 2 to Windows Server 2003; also with the Security Configuration Wizard, it allows administrators to more easily manage the incoming open ports, as it will automatically detect and select default roles.
* Other networking improvements include support for Wireless Provisioning Services, better IPv6 support, and new protections against SYN flood TCP attacks.
* Post-Setup Security Updates, a panel which is shown only when the operating system is first installed. This window allows you to configure and update your server, and halts incoming connections until it is closed.
* Data Execution Prevention (DEP), a feature to add support for the No Execute (NX) bit which helps to prevent buffer overflow exploits that are often the attack vector of Windows Server exploits.
* Windows Media Player version 10
* Internet Explorer 6 SV1 (e.g. &#x27;IE6 SP2&#x27;)
* Support for fixed disks bearing data organized using the GUID Partition Table system

A full list of updates is available in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

===Service Pack 2===
Service Pack 2 for Windows Server 2003 was released on March 13, 2007. The release date was originally scheduled for the first half of 2006. On June 13, 2006, Microsoft made an initial test version of Service Pack 2 available to Microsoft Connect users, with a build number of 2721. This was followed by build 2805, known as Beta 2 Refresh. The final build is 3790.

Microsoft has described Service Pack 2 as a &quot;standard&quot; service pack release containing previously released security updates, hotfixes, and reliability and performance improvements. In addition, Service Pack 2 contains Microsoft Management Console 3.0, Windows Deployment Services (which replaces Remote Installation Services), support for WPA2, and improvements to IPsec and MSConfig. Service Pack 2 also adds &quot;Windows Server 2003 Scalable Networking Pack&quot; (SNP), which allows hardware acceleration for processing network packets, thereby enabling faster throughput. SNP was previously available as an out-of-band update for Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1.

==Windows Server 2003 R2==

Windows Server 2003 R2 is an updated release of Windows Server 2003. It was released to manufacturing on December 6, 2005 for IA-32 and x64 platforms, but not for IA-64. It was succeeded by Windows Server 2008.

New features of Windows Server 2003 R2 include:
* .NET Framework 2.0, which replaces the .NET Framework 1.0 included with the standard releases
* Active Directory Federation Services, a single sign-on solution for Active Directory Services
* Microsoft Management Console version 3.0. Additionally, several new snap-ins are included:
** Print Management Console, for managing print servers
** File Server Resource Manager, for managing disk quotas on file servers
** Storage Manager for SANs, for managing LUNs 
* A new version of Distributed File System that includes remote differential compression technology
* Microsoft Virtual Server 2005, a hypervisor and the precursor to Hyper-V
* Windows Services for UNIX, a UNIX environment for Windows

Windows Server 2003 R2 was distributed in two CDs, one containing a copy of Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 included and another containing a host of optionally-installed new features needed for Windows Server 2003 R2 installation, similar to that of Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95.

==Support lifecycle==
On July 13, 2010, Windows Server 2003&#x27;s mainstream support expired and the extended support phase began. During the extended support phase, Microsoft continued to provide security updates; however, free technical support, warranty claims, and design changes are no longer being offered. Extended support lasted until July 14, 2015. Mainstream support for Small Business Server edition ended on April 12, 2011 and extended support ended on April 12, 2016. Mainstream support for Storage Server edition ended on October 11, 2011 and extended support ended on October 9, 2016.

Although Windows Server 2003 is unsupported, Microsoft released an emergency security patch in May 2017 for the OS as well as other unsupported versions of Windows (including Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 RTM without a service pack), to address a vulnerability that was being leveraged by the WannaCry ransomware attack.

In 2020, Microsoft announced that it would disable the Windows Update service for SHA-1 endpoints. Since Windows Server 2003 did not get an update for SHA-2, Windows Update Services are no longer available on the OS as of late July 2020. However, as of April 2021, the old updates for Windows Server 2003 are still available on the Microsoft Update Catalog.

== Source code leak ==
On September 23, 2020, the Windows XP Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2003 source code was leaked onto the imageboard 4chan by an unknown user. Anonymous users managed to compile the Windows Server 2003 source code, as well as a Twitter user who posted videos of the process on YouTube proving that the code was genuine, but was removed from the platform on copyright grounds by Microsoft. The leak was incomplete as it was missing the Winlogon source code and some other components. The original leak itself was spread using magnet links and torrent files whose payload originally included Server 2003 and XP source code and which was later updated by additional files among which were previous leaks of Microsoft products, its patents, media about conspiracy theories about Bill Gates by anti-vaccination movements and an assortment of PDF files on different topics.

Microsoft issued a statement stating that it was investigating the leaks.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Country Song (sometimes known as the Country Songwriter&#x27;s Award) has been awarded since 1965. The award is given to the songwriter(s) of the song, not to the artist, except if the artist is also the songwriter.

There have been several minor changes to the name of the award:

*From 1965 to 1968, it was known as &quot;Best Country &amp; Western Song&quot;
*From 1969 to 1983, it was awarded as &quot;Best Country Song&quot;
*In 1984, it was awarded as &quot;Best New Country Song &quot;
*From 1985 to the present, it has again been awarded as &quot;Best Country Song&quot;

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for music released in the previous year. Lori McKenna, Josh Kear, Chris Stapleton, and current winner Kacey Musgraves hold the record of most wins in the category with three wins each.

<text>Dundalk ( ; ) is the county town of County Louth, Ireland. The town is situated on the Castletown River, which flows into Dundalk Bay on the north-east coast of Ireland, and is halfway between Dublin and Belfast, close to and south of the border with Northern Ireland. It is surrounded by several townlands and villages that form the wider Dundalk Municipal District. It is the seventh largest urban area in Ireland, with a population of 43,112 as of the 2022 census.

Dundalk has been inhabited since the Neolithic period. It was established as a Norman stronghold in the 12th century following the Norman invasion of Ireland, and became the northernmost outpost of The Pale in the Late Middle Ages. Located where the northernmost point of the province of Leinster meets the province of Ulster, the town came to be known as the &quot;Gap of the North&quot;. The modern street layout dates from the early 18th century and owes its form to James Hamilton (later 1st Earl of Clanbrassil). The legends of the mythical warrior hero Cú Chulainn are set in this district, and the motto on the town&#x27;s coat of arms is (&quot;I gave birth to brave Cú Chulainn&quot;).

The town developed brewing, distilling, tobacco, textile, and engineering industries during the 19th century. It became prosperous and its population grew as it became an important manufacturing and trading centre, both as a hub on the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) network and with its maritime link to Liverpool from the Port of Dundalk. It suffered from high unemployment and urban decay after these industries closed or were scaled back, both in the aftermath of the Partition of Ireland in 1921 and following the accession of Ireland to the European Economic Community in 1973. New industries were established in the early part of the 21st century, including pharmaceutical, technology, financial services, and specialist foods.

There is one third-level education institute, Dundalk Institute of Technology. The largest theatre in the town, &quot;An Táin&quot; Arts Centre (named after the epic of Irish mythology), is housed in Dundalk Town Hall, and the restored buildings of the nearby former Dundalk Distillery house both the County Museum Dundalk and the Louth County Library. Sporting clubs include Dundalk Football Club (who play at Oriel Park), Dundalk Rugby Club, Dundalk Golf Club, and several clubs competing in Gaelic games. Dundalk Stadium is a horse and greyhound racing venue and is Ireland&#x27;s only all-weather horse racing track.

==History==
===Toponymy===
Dundalk is an anglicisation of that was adopted by the first Norman settlers of the area in the 12th century. It means &quot;the fort of Dealgan&quot; (&quot;Dún&quot; being a type of medieval fort and &quot;Delga&quot; being the name of a mythical Fir Bolg Chieftain). The site of &quot;Dún Dealgan&quot; is traditionally associated with the ringfort known to have existed at Castletown Mount before the arrival of the Normans. The first mention of Dundalk in historical sources appears in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;, which record that Brian Boru met the King of Ulster at &quot;&quot;Dún Delgain&quot; in 1002 to demand submission. 12th century versions of the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; feature &quot;Delga in Muirtheimne&quot;. The manor house built by Bertram de Verdon at Castletown Mount on the site of the earlier settlement is referred to as the &quot;Castle of Dundalc&quot;&quot; in the 12th century records of the Gormanston Register.

===Early history and legend===

Archaeological studies at Rockmarshall on the Cooley peninsula indicate that the Dundalk district was first inhabited circa 3700 BC during the Neolithic period. Pre-Christian archaeological sites in the Dundalk Municipal District include the Proleek Dolmen (a portal tomb) in Ballymascanlon, which dates to around 3000 BC, the nearby &quot;Giant&#x27;s Grave&quot; (a wedge-shaped gallery grave), Rockmarshall Court Tomb (a court cairn), and Aghnaskeagh Cairns (a chambered cairn and portal tomb).

The legends of Cú Chulainn, including the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; (The Cattle Raid of Cooley), an epic of early Irish literature, are set in the first century AD, before the arrival of Christianity to Ireland. &quot;Clochafarmore&quot;, the menhir that Cú Chulainn reputedly tied himself to before he died, is located to the west of the town, near Knockbridge.

Saint Brigid is reputed to have been born in 451 AD in Faughart. A shrine to her is located at Faughart. St Brigid&#x27;s Church in Kilcurry holds what worshippers believe is a relic of the saint, a fragment of her skull.

Most of what is recorded about the Dundalk area between the 5th century and the foundation of the town as a Norman stronghold in the 12th century comes from the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; and the &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot;, which were both written hundreds of years after the events they record. According to the annals, the area that is now Dundalk was known as &quot;Magh Muirthemne&quot; (the Plain of the Dark Sea). It was bordered to the northeast by &quot;Cuailgne&quot; (Cooley) and to the south by the &quot;Ciannachta&quot;. It was ruled by a Cruthin kingdom known as &quot;Conaille Muirtheimne&quot; (who were aligned to the &quot;Ulaid&quot;) in the early Christian period.

There are several references in the annals to battles fought in the district such as the &#x27;Battle of Fochart&#x27; in 732, which are folklore. Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot; recounts the mythical tale of a 10th-century naval battle in Dundalk Bay. Sitric, son of Turgesius and ruler of the &quot;Lochlannaigh&quot; in Ireland, had offered Cellachán Caisil, the King of Munster, his sister in marriage. But it was a trick to take the king prisoner and he was captured and held hostage in Armagh. An army was raised in Munster and marched on Armagh to free the king, but Sitric retreated to Dundalk and moved his hostages to his ship in Dundalk Bay as the Munster army approached. A fleet from Munster commanded by the King of Desmond, Failbhe Fion, attacked the Danes in the bay from the south. During the sea battle, Failbhe Fion boarded Sitric&#x27;s ship and freed Cellachán, but was killed by Sitric who put Failbhe Fion&#x27;s head on a pole. Failbhe Fion&#x27;s second in command, Fingal, seized Sitric by the neck and jumped into the sea where they both drowned. Two more Irish captains each grabbed one of Sitric&#x27;s two brothers and did the same, and the Danes were subsequently routed.

There is a high concentration of souterrains in north Louth, particularly along the western periphery of the town including at Castletown Mount, which is evidence of settlements from early Christian Ireland. This indicates that the area was regularly subject to raids and the discovery of a type of pottery known as &#x27;souterrain ware&#x27;, which has only been found in north Louth, County Down and County Antrim, suggests that these areas shared cultural ties separate from the rest of early historic Ireland. The number of souterrains drops significantly on crossing the River Fane to the south, indicating that the district was a border area between separate kingdoms.

Archaeological and historical research suggests that before the arrival of the Normans, the district was composed of rural settlements of ringforts located on the higher ground that surrounds the present-day town. There are references in the annals and folklore to a pre-Norman town located in the present-day Seatown area, east of the town centre. This area was alternatively called &quot;Traghbaile&quot; and later &quot;Sraidbhaile&quot; in Irish. These names could have derived from the folkloric tale of the death of Bailé Mac Buain—hence &quot;Traghbaile&quot;, meaning &#x27;Bailé&#x27;s Strand&#x27;, or &quot;Sraid Baile mac Buain&quot;, meaning the street town of Bailé Mac Buain. Dundalk continued to be referred to as &#x27;Sraidbhaile&#x27; in Irish into the 20th Century.

===Norman arrival===
By the time of the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, &quot;Magh Muirthemne&quot; had been absorbed into the kingdom of &quot;Airgíalla&quot; (Oriel) under the Ó Cearbhaills. In about 1185, Bertram de Verdun, a counsel of Henry II of England, erected a manor house at Castletown Mount on the ancient site of &quot;Dún Dealgan&quot;. De Verdon founded his settlement seemingly without resistance from &quot;Airgíalla&quot; (the Ó Cearbhaills are recorded as having submitted to Henry by this time), and in 1187 he founded an Augustinian friary under the patronage of St Leonard. He was awarded the lands around what is now Dundalk by Prince John on the death of Murchadh Ó Cearbhaill in 1189.

On de Verdun&#x27;s death in Jaffa in 1192 at the end of the Third Crusade, his lands at Dundalk passed to his son Thomas and then to his second son Nicholas after Thomas died. In 1236, Nicholas&#x27;s daughter Roesia commissioned Castle Roche, 8 km north-west of the present-day town centre, on a large rocky outcrop with a commanding view of the surrounding countryside. It was completed by her son, John, in the 1260s.

Castle Roche was destroyed in 1315 by the armies of Edward Bruce, brother of the Scottish king Robert the Bruce, as they made their way south through Ulster during the Bruce campaign in Ireland. They then attacked the town and massacred its population. After taking possession of the town, Bruce proclaimed himself King of Ireland. Following three more years of battles across the north-eastern part of the island, Bruce was killed and his army defeated at the Battle of Faughart by a force led by John de Birmingham, who was created the 1st Earl of Louth as a reward.

Later generations of de Verduns continued to own lands at Dundalk into the 14th century. Following the death of Theobald de Verdun, 2nd Baron Verdun in 1316 without a male heir, the family&#x27;s landholdings were split. One of Theobold de Verdun&#x27;s daughters, Joan, married the second Baron Furnivall, Thomas de Furnivall, and his family subsequently acquired much of the de Verdun land at Dundalk. The de Furnivall family&#x27;s coat of arms formed the basis of the seal of the &#x27;New Town of Dundalk&#x27;—a 14th-century seal discovered in the early 20th century, which became the town&#x27;s coat of arms in 1968. The &#x27;new town&#x27; that was established in the 13th century is the present-day town centre; the &#x27;old town of the Castle of Dundalk&#x27; being the original de Verdun settlement at Castletown Mount 2 km to the west. The de Furnivalls then sold their holdings to the Bellew family, another Norman family long established in County Meath. The town was granted its first formal charter as a &#x27;New Town&#x27; in the late 14th century under the reign of Richard II of England.

In effect a frontier town as the northernmost outpost of The Pale, Dundalk continued to grow in the 14th and 15th centuries. The town was regularly attacked and was heavily fortified, with at least 14 separate assaults, sieges or demands for tribute by a resurgent native Irish population recorded between 1300 and 1600 (with more than that number being likely).

===English rule===

In 1540, the Priory of St Leonard founded by Bertram de Verdun was surrendered to the Crown because of Henry VIII&#x27;s Dissolution of the Monasteries. During the subsequent Tudor conquest of Ireland, Dundalk remained the northern outpost of English rule. In 1600, the town was used as a base of operations for the English, led by Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy, for their push into Ulster through the &#x27;Gap of the North&#x27; (the Moyry Pass) during the Nine Years&#x27; War.

Following the Flight of the Earls, the subsequent Plantation of Ulster (and the associated suppression of Catholicism) resulted in the Irish Rebellion of 1641. After only token resistance, Dundalk was occupied by an Ulster Irish Catholic army on 31 October. They subsequently tried and failed to take Drogheda and retreated to Dundalk. The Royal Irish Army, who were led by the Duke of Ormond (and known as Ormondists), in turn, laid siege to Dundalk and overran and plundered the town in March 1642, killing many inhabitants.

The Ormondists held the town during the English Civil War until it was occupied by the Northern Parliamentary Army of George Monck. The Parliamentarians held it for two years before surrendering it back to the Ormondists. It was then retaken by the forces of Oliver Cromwell, who had landed in Ireland in August 1649 and sacked Drogheda. After the massacre in Drogheda, Cromwell wrote to the Ormondist commander in Dundalk warning him that his garrison would suffer the same fate if it did not surrender. The Duke of Ormond ordered the commander to have his men burn the town before his retreat, but they did not do so such was their haste to leave. For the remainder of the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, the town was again used as a base for operations against the Irish in Ulster.

After the Restoration of the monarchy, the Corporation of Dundalk was granted a new charter by Charles II on 4 March 1673. The forfeiture of property and settlements carried out during the Restoration saw much of the land of Dundalk granted to Marcus Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon, who had fought for both sides in the civil war. Even though the Bellews were seen as Papists, Sir John Bellew appears to have held onto much of his family&#x27;s legacy landholdings.

When the Williamite War in Ireland began in 1689, the Williamite commander Schomberg landed in Belfast and marched unopposed to Dundalk but, as the bulk of his forces were raw and undisciplined as well as inferior in numbers to the Jacobite Irish Army, he decided against risking a battle. He entrenched himself at Dundalk and declined to be drawn beyond the circle of his defences. With poor logistics and struck by disease, over 5,000 of his troops died.

After the end of the Williamite War, the third Viscount Dungannon, Mark Trevor, sold the Dundalk estate to James Hamilton of Tollymore, County Down. Hamilton&#x27;s son, also James, was created Viscount Limerick in 1719 and then the first Earl of Clanbrassil in 1756. The modern town of Dundalk owes its form to Hamilton. The military activity of the 17th century had left the town&#x27;s walls in ruins. With the collapse of the Gaelic aristocracy and the total takeover of the country by the English, Dundalk was no longer a frontier town and no longer had a need for its 15th-century fortifications. Hamilton commissioned the construction of streets leading to the town centre; his ideas stemming from his visits to Continental Europe. In addition to the demolition of the old walls and castles, he had new roads laid out eastwards of the principal streets.

When the first Earl died in 1758, the estates passed to his son, the second Earl of Clanbrassil, who died without an heir in 1798. The Earl of Roden inherited the Dundalk estate because the second Earl&#x27;s sister, Lady Anne Hamilton, had married Robert Jocelyn, the first Earl of Roden. Portions of the Roden Dundalk estate were sold under the auspices of the various land acts of the 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the Irish Free State government lands purchase acts of the 1920s. The remaining freeholds and ground rents were sold in 2006, severing the links between the Earls of Roden and the town of Dundalk.

During the 18th century, Ireland was controlled by the minority Anglican Protestant Ascendancy via the Penal Laws, which discriminated against both the majority Irish Catholic population and Dissenters. Mirroring other boroughs around the country, Dundalk Corporation was a &#x27;closed shop&#x27;, consisting of an electorate of &#x27;freemen&#x27; (mostly absentee landlords of the Ascendancy). The Earl of Clanbrassil controlled the procedures for both the nomination of new freemen and the nomination of parliamentary candidates, therefore disenfranchising the local populace. In the late 18th century, the United Irishmen movement, inspired by the American and French revolutions, led to the Rebellion of 1798. In north Louth, the authorities had successfully suppressed the activities of the United Irishmen prior to the rebellion with the help of informants, and several local leaders had been rounded up and imprisoned in Dundalk Gaol. An attack on the military barracks and gaol to free prisoners was planned for 21 June 1798. The attack failed because of a thunderstorm, which dispersed the gathered United Irish volunteers, and two of the jailed leaders—Anthony Marmion and John Hoey—were subsequently tried for treason and hanged.

===After the Acts of Union===

Following the Act of Union, which came into force on 1 January 1801, The 19th century saw industrial expansion in the town (see Economy) and the construction of several buildings that are landmarks in the town. The first railway links arrived when the Dundalk and Enniskillen Railway opened a line from Quay Street to Castleblayney in 1849, and by 1860 the company operated a route northwest to Derry. Also in 1849, the Dublin and Belfast Junction Railway opened Dundalk railway station. Following a series of mergers, both lines were incorporated into the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) in 1876.

The established and merchant classes prospered alongside a general population that suffered from poverty. A typhus epidemic struck in the 1810s, potato-crop failures in the 1820s caused famine, and a cholera epidemic struck in the 1830s. During the Great Famine of the 1840s, the town did not suffer to the same extent as the west and south of Ireland. Cereal-based agriculture, new industries, construction projects, and the arrival of the railway all contributed to sparing the town of its worst effects. Nevertheless, so many people died in the Dundalk Union Workhouse that the graveyard was quickly filled. A second graveyard was opened on the Ardee Road—the Dundalk Famine Graveyard—which is known to contain approximately 4,000 bodies. It was closed in 1905 and was left derelict until the 21st century when local volunteers worked to restore it.
The latter part of the 19th century was dominated by the Irish Home Rule movement and Dundalk became a focal point of the politics of the time. The Irish National Land League held a demonstration in Dundalk on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1881, stated by the local press to be the largest gathering ever seen in the town.

As the Home Rule movement developed, the sitting Home Rule League MP, Philip Callan, fell out with party leader Charles Stewart Parnell, who travelled to Dundalk to oversee efforts to have Callan unseated. Parnell&#x27;s candidate, Joseph Nolan, defeated Callan in the election of 1885 after a campaign of voter suppression and intimidation on both sides. Following the split in the Irish Parliamentary Party, the leading anti-Parnellite, Tim Healy, won the North Louth seat in 1892, defeating Nolan (who had stayed loyal to Parnell). The campaign, predicted by Healy to be &quot;the nastiest fight in Ireland&quot;, saw running battles and mass brawls in the streets between Parnellites, &#x27;Healyites&#x27;, and &#x27;Callanites&#x27;—supporters of Philip Callan, who was trying to regain his seat.

The local Sinn Féin cumann was founded in 1907 by Patrick Hughes. It struggled to grow beyond a handful of members because of the dominance of the existing political factions. In 1910, on the accession of George V to the English throne, the local High Sheriff, accompanied by police and soldiers, led a proclamation to the new king at the Market Square. The ceremony was interrupted by the local Sinn Féin members, who raised a tricolour beside the Maid of Erin monument and chanted &quot;God Save Ireland&quot; during a rendition of &quot;God Save the King&quot;—giving the party visibility in the town for the first time.

Approximately 2,500 men from Louth volunteered for Allied regiments in World War I and it is estimated that 307 men from the Dundalk district died during the war. In the months before the outbreak of the war, the G.N.R. converted nine of its carriages into a mobile &#x27;ambulance train&#x27;, which could hold 100 wounded soldiers. &quot;Ambulance Train 13&quot; was kept in service for the duration of the war before being decommissioned in 1919. The war came to Dundalk weeks before the Armistice, when the &quot;S.S. Dundalk&quot; was sunk by a German U-boat on 14 October 1918 on a voyage from Liverpool to Dundalk. 20 crew-members were killed, while 12 were rescued.

Meanwhile, the Easter Rising had changed the political landscape. 80 members of the Irish Volunteers had left Dundalk to take part in the Rising. After the countermanding order of Eoin MacNeill, members of the unit ended up in Castlebellingham, trying to evade the Dundalk RIC. There, they held several RIC men and a British Army officer at gunpoint until one of the Volunteers, believing the army officer was reaching for a hidden weapon, fired at the captives, killing RIC constable Charles McGee. After the Rising ended, the Volunteers went on the run and most were captured. Four were sentenced to death for the murder of Constable McGee but were released in the general amnesty of 1917.

===Independence===
In the 1918 Irish general election, Louth elected its first Sinn Féin MP when John J. O&#x27;Kelly defeated the sitting MP, Richard Hazleton of the Irish Parliamentary Party, in the closest contest of the election—O&#x27;Kelly winning by 255 votes. In the run-up to the election, the local newspapers had supported the Irish Party over Sinn Féin and complained afterwards that the area of Drogheda in County Meath that was included in the Louth constituency had tipped the contest in Sinn Féin&#x27;s favour. Again, the campaign saw reports of widespread violence and intimidation tactics.
There was no strategic military action in north Louth during the Irish War of Independence. Activity consisted of acts of sabotage and attacks on the RIC to seize arms. Arson attacks were a feature of the period in particular. Crown forces committed reprisal attacks in response, hardening support for Sinn Féin. In the aftermath of a shooting of an RIC auxiliary on 17 June 1921, brothers John and Patrick Watters were taken from their home at the Windmill Bar and shot dead. The British authorities subsequently suppressed the &quot;Dundalk Examiner&quot; newspaper for reporting on the incident, and smashed its printing presses. Volunteers from the area led by Frank Aiken were more active in Ulster, and were responsible for the derailing of a military train at Adavoyle railway station, 13 km north of Dundalk, which killed three soldiers, the train&#x27;s guard, and dozens of horses.

The Anglo-Irish Treaty turned Dundalk, once again, into a frontier town. In the new Irish Free State, the split over the treaty led to the Irish Civil War. Before the outbreak of hostilities, Éamon de Valera toured Ireland making a series of anti-treaty speeches. He visited Dundalk on 2 April 1922 and before a large crowd in the Market Square, he said that those who had negotiated the treaty &quot;had run across to Lloyd George to be spanked like little boys&quot;.

Frank Aiken attempted to keep his division neutral during the split over the treaty but on 16 July 1922, Aiken and all of the anti-treaty elements among his men were arrested and imprisoned at Dundalk military barracks and Dundalk Gaol in a surprise move by the pro-treaty Fifth Northern Division, now part of the National Army. On 27 July, anti-treaty &#x27;Irregulars&#x27; blew a hole in the outer wall of the gaol, freeing Aiken and his men. On 14 August, Aiken led an attack on the barracks that resulted in its capture with five National Army and two Irregular soldiers killed. Aiken&#x27;s men killed another dozen National Army soldiers in guerrilla attacks before the town was retaken without resistance on 26 August. Before withdrawing, Aiken called for a truce at a meeting in the centre of Dundalk.

From that point, north Louth ceased to be an area of strategic importance in the war. Guerrilla attacks continued—mostly acts of sabotage, particularly against the railway. In January 1923, six anti-treaty prisoners were executed by firing squad in Dundalk for bearing arms against the state.

===Border town===
The partition of Ireland turned Dundalk into a border town and the Dublin–Belfast main line into an international railway. On 1 April 1923, the Free State government began installing border posts for the purpose of collecting customs duties. Almost immediately, the town started to suffer economic problems. The introduction of the border and tariffs exacerbated the effects of a global post-war slump.

With a population of 14,000 at the time, unemployment was reported to be nearly 2,000 and it was reported that: &quot;Up to a few years ago, Dundalk was one of the most prosperous and go-ahead towns in Ireland... [but] it is a matter of common local knowledge that distress to an acute degree is prevalent&quot;. The Anglo-Irish trade war, in the midst of a global depression, made things more difficult still. The industrial situation stabilised, however, as the protectionist policies adopted allowed local industries to increase employment and prosper.

During the Emergency (as World War II was called in Ireland), there were three aeroplane crashes in what is now the municipal district. A British Hudson bomber crashed in 1941, killing three crew, and a P-51 Mustang fighter of the US Army Air Forces crashed in September 1944, killing its pilot. The worst of the wartime air crashes occurred on 16 March 1942. 15 allied airmen died when their Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber crashed into Slieve na Glogh, which rises above the townland of Jenkinstown. On 24 July 1941, the Luftwaffe dropped bombs near the town. There were no casualties and only minor damage was caused.

The town continued to grow in size after the war—in terms of area, population and employment—despite economic shocks such as the dissolution of the G.N.R. in 1958. The accession of Ireland to the European Economic Community in 1973, however, saw factory closures and job losses in businesses that struggled due to competition, collapsing consumer confidence, and unfavourable exchange rates with cross-border competitors. The downturn resulted in an unemployment rate of 26% by 1986.

In addition, the outbreak of the Troubles in Northern Ireland in 1968 and the town&#x27;s position close to the border saw the town&#x27;s population swell, as nationalists/Catholics fleeing the violence in Northern Ireland settled in the area. As a result of the ongoing sectarianism in the north, there was sympathy for the cause of the Provisional Irish Republican Army and Sinn Féin, and the town was home to several IRA members. It was in this period that Dundalk earned the nickname &#x27;El Paso&#x27;, after the town in Texas on the border with Mexico. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher asked Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald after the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement what his reaction would be if the British bombed Dundalk to stop the IRA from launching attacks in Northern Ireland.

On 19 December 1975, a car bombing in the centre of the town carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force killed two people and injured 15. There were several incidents of British military incursions into North Louth. The town was also the scene of several killings connected to the INLA and its internal feuds and criminal activity. On 1 September 1973, the 27 Infantry Battalion of the Irish Army was established with its headquarters in Dundalk barracks, as a result of the ongoing violence in the border region of North Louth / South Armagh. The barracks was renamed Aiken Barracks in 1986 in honour of Frank Aiken.

Dundalk celebrated its &#x27;official&#x27; 1200th year in 1989, meaning the Irish government recognised 789 as the year in which the first settlement was founded, with then President of Ireland, Dr. Patrick Hillery, attending a celebration at the Market Square.

After the start of the Northern Ireland peace process, and the subsequent Good Friday Agreement, then U.S. president, Bill Clinton chose Dundalk to make an open-air address in December 2000 in support of the peace process. In his speech in the Market Square, witnessed by an estimated 60,000 people, Clinton spoke of &quot;a new day in Dundalk and a new day in Ireland&quot;.

===21st century===

The town was slow to benefit from a &#x27;peace dividend&#x27;, and in the first decade of the new millennium the two Diageo-owned breweries and the Carroll&#x27;s tobacco factory were among several factories to close—finally severing the links to the town&#x27;s industrial past. By 2012, the town was being painted as &quot;one of Ireland&#x27;s most deprived areas&quot; after the global downturn following the Financial crisis of 2007–2008.

Indigenous industry started to recover, with the Great Northern Brewery being reopened as &#x27;the Great Northern Distillery&#x27; in 2015 by John Teeling, who had established and later sold the Cooley Distillery; and locally-driven initiatives led to a flurry of foreign direct investment announcements in the latter half of the 2010s, particularly in the technology and pharmaceutical sectors.

The town&#x27;s association football club, Dundalk F.C., first formed in 1903 by the workers of the Great Northern Railway, received European-wide recognition when it became the first Irish side to win points in the group stage of European competition in the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League.

In April 2023, Joe Biden, who has ancestry in north Louth, became the second sitting US president to visit the town.

==Geography==
Dundalk lies on the 54th parallel north circle of latitude. It is situated where the Castletown River flows into Dundalk Bay on the east coast of Ireland, with the town centre on the south side of the river. It is in County Louth, which shares borders with County Armagh to the north (in Northern Ireland), County Monaghan to the west, and County Meath to the south. It is near the border with Northern Ireland (which is from the town centre by road and at the nearest points by air), and is equidistant between Dublin and Belfast ( from both). The town came to be nicknamed the &#x27;Gap of the North&#x27; where the northernmost point of the province of Leinster meets the province of Ulster (although the actual &#x27;gap&#x27; is the Moyry Pass 8 km to the north at the border with Northern Ireland).

Following the abolition of &#x27;legal towns&#x27; under the Local Government Reform Act 2014, Dundalk is part of the wider Dundalk Municipal District for the purposes of local government, which is approximately equivalent to the pre-1898 baronies of Dundalk Lower and Dundalk Upper, i.e. roughly the northern one-third of the county by area including the Cooley peninsula. The former legal town and its environs (approximately the area north of the River Fane (including Blackrock), south of Exit 18 on the M1, bordered by the M1 to the west and the Irish Sea to the east; and incorporating Knockbridge to the west of the M1) is now the &#x27;census town&#x27;.

===Landscape===

The main part of the census town lies at sea level. Dún Dealgan Motte at Castletown is the highest point in the urban area at an elevation of . The municipal district includes the Cooley Mountains, with Slieve Foy the highest of the peaks at an elevation of .

The urban area straddles two geographical areas. A landscape of drumlins and undulating farmland form a crescent around the town&#x27;s outer limits. This area contains contorted Ordovician and Silurian slates and shales. The flat, low-lying coastal plain of the main part of the urban area consists of alluvial clays, laid down as the sea retreated following the last Ice Age. Land was reclaimed both naturally and because of the drainage schemes undertaken in the 18th century by James Hamilton, the first Earl of Clanbrassil. This has meant that the topography of the district has changed extensively since the area was first inhabited and also since the formation of the original Norman settlements.

===Street layout===

The layout of Dundalk is based around three principal street systems leading to the open, central Market Square. Clanbrassil Street and Bridge Street run north from the square to the bridge over the Castletown River with the Castletown Road running west from Bridge Street towards Castletown Mount—the original Norman settlement of Dundalk. Jocelyn Street, Seatown Place, and Barrack Street run east from the square towards the old Quay Street railway station, the army barracks, and the Port of Dundalk. Park Street, Dublin Street, and Hill Street run south out of the town to the Dublin Road.

===Climate===
Similar to much of northwest Europe, Dundalk experiences an oceanic climate and does not suffer from the extremes of temperature experienced by many other locations at similar latitude. Summers are typically cool and partly cloudy and the winter is typically cold, wet, windy, and mostly cloudy. Over the course of the year, the temperature typically varies from and is rarely below or above .
==Demography==
Dundalk is the seventh largest urban area in Ireland and the second largest town (after Drogheda), with a population of 43,112 as of the 2022 census. Dundalk is the biggest town in Louth, however, because part of the census town of Drogheda is in County Meath. The population density of the census town of Dundalk was measured at in 2022. The population of the wider municipal district is 64,287.

===Language===
The first language of the majority of &#x27;white Irish&#x27; residents of Dundalk is English (a.k.a. Hiberno-English). Approximately 4% of the population speak the Irish language on a daily basis outside of the education system. The Omeath area in Cooley, within the municipal district, was a small Gaeltacht area, with the last speaker of a &#x27;Louth Irish&#x27; dialect dying in 1960.

==Politics and government==
===National and European===
Dundalk is the county town (the administrative centre) of the county of Louth in Ireland. It is represented at the national level in Dáil Éireann as part the Louth parliamentary constituency, which was created under the terms of the Electoral Act 1923, and first used at the 1923 general election.

Before the Act of Union, which came into force on 1 January 1801, Dundalk was a Parliament of Ireland constituency. Following the Act of Union, Dundalk was a UK Parliament constituency until 1885. In 1885, the constituency was combined with the northern part of the County Louth constituency to become North Louth. In 1918, the North Louth constituency was combined with South Louth to form a single County Louth constituency—the precursor of the constituency formed following the creation of Dáil Éireann.

Dundalk is represented in the European Parliament within the Midlands–North-West constituency.

===Local government===
Louth County Council () is the authority responsible for local government in Dundalk. As a county council, it is governed by the Local Government Act 2001. For administrative purposes, the council is sub-divided into three areas, centred around the three main towns in the county—Dundalk, Drogheda and Ardee. The Dundalk Municipal District comprises all of the county to the north of a line running approximately east-to-north west, from the coast to the Monaghan border, across the villages of Castlebellingham and Knockbridge.

The county council has 29 elected members, 13 of whom are from the Dundalk district. Elections are held every five years and are by single transferable vote. For the purpose of elections, the Dundalk Municipal District is sub-divided into two local electoral areas: Dundalk-Carlingford (6 Seats) and Dundalk South (7 Seats).

===Coat of arms===

The coat of arms of Dundalk was officially granted by the Office of the Chief Herald at the National Library of Ireland in 1968, and is a replication of the &quot;seal matrix&quot; of the &#x27;New Town of Dundalk&#x27;, which itself dates to the 14th century. The modern-day coat of arms contains the motto (&quot;I gave birth to brave Cú Chulainn&quot;). It can be seen that the seal displays both Gaelic and Norman elements as the town developed from both origins. The shield is from the coat of arms of the de Furnivall family—a bend between six martlets. The ermine boar supporter is derived from the arms of the Ó hAnluain (O&#x27;Hanlon) family, Kings of Airthir, the main Gaelic Irish family in the area. The precise origins of the lion &quot;passant guardant&quot; and the foot soldier with his spear and sword are not known. It is believed that the foot soldier is of Norman origins and is likely traced to Bertram de Verdon and his family who planned the first wall of Dundalk and the demesne when it was designed as a Norman town. The lion, being a symbol of Norman royalty, can be found on many crests and atop buildings in Dublin and many other former Norman settlements. 

Previously, the town&#x27;s coat of arms was a simpler three gold martlets on an azure field. The earliest recorded use of this coat of arms is when the Corporation of Dundalk was granted a charter by Charles II in 1673. It appears as the Corporation Seal in a town plan dated 1675. It cannot be stated definitively if there is a link between the 14th century seal and the 17th century seal. However, another Anglo-Norman family, the Dowdalls, were also influential landowners in Dundalk in the Middle Ages, and their family coat of arms contains three martlets on a field. The townland of Dowdallshill lies to the north of the Castletown River. The Corporation Seal can be seen carved in stone on Dundalk Town Hall, which was built in the mid-1800s.

In December 1929, the town council proposed to remove the &quot;three black crows&quot; seal because it had supposedly been imposed by King Henry VIII, a historically inaccurate claim that met widespread derision. The majority on the town council pressed ahead and the old seal was replaced by a seal depicting Saint Patrick, Saint Brigid and Saint Colmcille in the form of a shamrock.

Several companies and organisations in the town continued to use the shield with three martlets as their logo. Examples include the Dundalk Race Company Limited (the company that ran Dundalk Racecourse), the Macardle Moore and Company brewery, and Dealgan Milk Products (a dairy company formed in the town in 1960). It also became the crest of Dundalk Football Club in 1927. The club&#x27;s current crest retains the three martlets but on a red shield.

==Economy==
===Industry===
Linen was the first industry established in Dundalk in the mid-18th century but it failed by the end of the century, with the factories becoming derelict. It would be the next century before new industries established themselves: mills, tanneries, a foundry, a distillery, and several breweries. During James Hamilton&#x27;s improvements to the town during the 18th century, the Port of Dundalk was established and became the eighth largest in Ireland in terms of exports.

The second half of the 19th century saw the population of Dundalk increase by 30% (despite the population of Ireland as a whole declining in the same period) as the town&#x27;s industries thrived. The Malcolm Brown &amp; Co. Dundalk Distillery was established c.1780 at Roden Place and operated successfully throughout the 19th century. Brewing was also a key industry in the town, with eight breweries in operation by the end of the 1830s. The famine of the 1840s left just two breweries in operation, which merged to become the Macardle Moore &amp; Co. brewery at Cambricville. The Great Northern Brewery opened later, in 1896. The Dundalk Iron Works was established in 1821 and by the end of the century had expanded to become a leading employer in the town. The P.J. Carroll tobacco factory was started on a small scale in the 1820s and grew throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Great Northern Railway (Ireland) works established in 1881 became the &quot;backbone of the town&quot;.

The town&#x27;s industries suffered after partition and again from the Anglo-Irish trade war. The imposition of tariffs and duties in April 1923 and the establishment of customs checks on the border affected exports and trade with the Newry district, which was now in a different jurisdiction. The iron works and the distillery, which the Distillers Company of Scotland had acquired in 1912, were the first major local industries to close.

Protectionism gave the town&#x27;s industries breathing space, and by 1950 they had recovered from the effects of partition and the trade war. The two breweries were successful and tobacco manufacturing, shoe manufacturing, and the railway works provided thousands of jobs. The town was also a thriving commercial centre, as the increase in bus traffic brought shoppers in from a wide radius. The Northern Ireland government&#x27;s decision to close many of the G.N.R. lines north of the border, however, made the company nonviable, and it was dissolved in 1958 leading to the closure of the works in Dundalk. It was replaced by &quot;Dundalk Engineering Works Ltd&quot; (DEW)—a government-backed initiative to keep the 980 remaining workers in employment. Carroll&#x27;s also continued to expand and modernise, opening a new factory on the Dublin Road in 1970. The design by Ronnie Tallon of Michael Scott &amp; Partners subsequently won architectural awards.

As late as 1969, the town was still in a position to boast of its industrial prowess, with the engineering companies at the DEW prospering. The pressures of trade liberalisation introduced by Ireland&#x27;s accession to the EEC in 1973 caused many businesses to falter during the 1970s and 1980s. The Engineering Works closed in 1985 and the last shoemaking factory closed in 2001. The ECCO (Electronics Components Company Overseas) factory, which had been opened by General Electric in 1966 and become the town&#x27;s leading employer by 1973, employing around 1,500 people at its peak, closed in 2006 after a long period of decline. Diageo closed both of the town&#x27;s breweries—first Cambricville in 2001, then the Great Northern Brewery in 2013 after a decade-long wind down. Also after a long decline, the Carroll&#x27;s factory closed in 2005.

Unemployment in the town reached 27.9% by 1991, and pleas to government for assistance were unsuccessful. The town was slow to benefit from the Celtic Tiger economy that saw an economic boom in Ireland from the mid-1990s and continued to suffer from business closures and job losses. By 2012, the town was being painted as one of Ireland&#x27;s &quot;most deprived areas&quot; after the global downturn following the Financial crisis of 2007–2008.

Indigenous industry started to recover following the financial crisis, with the Great Northern Brewery being reopened as &#x27;the Great Northern Distillery&#x27; in 2015 by John Teeling, who had established the Cooley Distillery. Locally-driven initiatives led to a flurry of Foreign Direct Investment announcements in the latter half of the 2010s, particularly in the technology and pharmaceutical sectors.

===Tourism===
The Dundalk / North Louth region is marketed as part of the &#x27;Ireland&#x27;s Ancient East&#x27; campaign. The &#x27;ancient east&#x27; encompasses Ireland&#x27;s coast from the border with Northern Ireland at Carlingford Lough to Kinsale in County Cork; inland as far as the River Shannon. In contrast to the Wild Atlantic Way, which focuses on landscape, the &#x27;Ireland&#x27;s Ancient East&#x27; campaign is more focused on history and heritage.

Louth is marketed as the &#x27;Land of Legends&#x27;, a campaign which also refers to a &quot;rich and ancient history and heritage&quot; and seeks to increase the number of visitors to the region &quot;by capitalising on County Louth&#x27;s unique location within Ireland&#x27;s Ancient East, as the hub for the Boyne Valley and the Cooley, Mourne and Gullion Regions&quot;. Dundalk is home to Ireland&#x27;s tallest mural, which depicts the warrior god Lugh. It is situated on the Gateway Hotel, Dundalk and measures 41 metres in height.

==Transport==

===Shipping===
Dundalk Port is a cargo import and export facility. There is no passenger traffic.

Shipping services to Liverpool were provided from 1837 by the Dundalk Steam Packet Company. It took over its rivals to become the Dundalk and Newry Steam Packet Company, which shipped cargo, live animals and passengers. It was forced to go into liquidation and allow itself to be taken over by B&amp;I in 1926 following a series of strikes. B&amp;I maintained the Dundalk to Liverpool route as a weekly service until 1968.

===Railway===
Dundalk is the closest station to the border on the southern side along the Belfast–Dublin line. The first railway links arrived when the Dundalk and Enniskillen Railway opened a line from Quay Street to Castleblayney in 1849, and by 1860 the company operated a route northwest to Derry. The line to Quay Street was later extended to Newry and Greenore by the Dundalk, Newry and Greenore Railway.

Also in 1849, the Dublin and Belfast Junction Railway opened its first station in Dundalk. Following a series of mergers, both the Dublin and Belfast and Dundalk and Enniskillen lines were incorporated into the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) in 1876. After partition, the G.N.R. had a border running through its network, with lines crisscrossing it several times, and the Northern Ireland government wanted to close many of the lines in favour of bus transport. By the 1950s, the G.N.R. company had ceased to be profitable and Dundalk saw its secondary routes closed—first the line to Greenore and Newry in 1951, and then the line to Derry in 1957. The G.N.R. was nationalised on both sides of the border in 1953, and the company was finally dissolved in 1958. The closure of the G.N.R. left Dundalk with only one operational line—the Dublin–Belfast &quot;Enterprise&quot; service (as well as commuter services to and from Dublin).

The G.N.R. built the current Dundalk railway station in 1894. It was renamed Clarke Station in 1966, in commemoration of Tom Clarke, one of the executed leaders of the Easter Rising. It houses a small museum in the old first-class waiting room, and has been called, &quot;the finest station on the main Dublin–Belfast line&quot;. It was used as a filming location for the Walt Disney Pictures film, &quot;Disenchanted&quot; in May 2021.

===Bus===
Dundalk&#x27;s Bus Station is operated by Bus Éireann and is located on the Long Walk near the town centre. The company runs a town service—Route 174. It also operates routes from Dundalk to Dublin, Galway, Newry, Clones, Cavan, and towns in between.

The Dundalk-Blackrock route was one of very few bus routes not compulsorily purchased by CIÉ under the Transport Acts of 1932 and 1933. It has been operated by Halpenny Travel since 1920.

===Road===
The M1–N1/A1 connects Dundalk to Dublin and Belfast. Exits 16, 17, and 18 service Dundalk South, Dundalk Centre, and Dundalk North, respectively. The National Secondary Road N52 from Nenagh, County Tipperary travels through the junction for Exit 16 on the M1, runs through the east side of the town, and terminates at the junction for Exit 18 of the M1. The N53 from Castleblayney, County Monaghan, which crosses the border twice, terminates at the junction for Exit 17 on the M1. The R173, which starts and finishes at the junction for Exit 18 of the M1, connects the town to the Cooley peninsula. The R171 connects the town to Ardee, the R177 and A29 connect the town to Armagh, and the R178 connects the town to Virginia, County Cavan via Carrickmacross, Shercock, and Bailieborough.

==Architecture==

Many of the buildings of architectural note in the town were built during the 19th century. Several buildings on the streets off the Market Square are described as being in the &quot;Dundalk style&quot; —ornate buildings, &quot;testifying to the confidence of Dundalk&#x27;s merchant class in the latter part of the 19th-century&quot;.

The Courthouse (completed in 1819) was designed by Edward Parke and John Bowden in the Neoclassical style and modelled on the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens. The Maid of Erin statue, erected in 1898, is located in the Market Square in front of the Court House. The adjacent Town Hall (completed in 1865), is an elaborate Italianate Palazzo Townhall, originally designed by John Murray as a corn exchange. It was sold to the Town Commissioners on completion and now houses &quot;An Táin&quot; Arts Centre, which comprises a 350-seat main theatre, a 55-seat studio theatre, a visual arts gallery, and two workshop spaces.

The Kelly Monument is in nearby Roden Place, in front of St Patrick&#x27;s Church. In 1858, a ship called the &quot;Mary Stoddart&quot;, was wrecked in Dundalk Bay during a storm. While attempting to rescue the crew, Captain James Joseph Kelly and three volunteer crew drowned when the storm overturned their boat. Five of the &quot;Mary Stoddart&quot; crew also drowned and 11 were eventually rescued. The monument in Roden Place was erected 20 years later as a memorial. The Louth County Library is located off Roden Place, in a restored building of what was the Dundalk Distillery. Further up Jocelyn Street, the County Museum Dundalk, documenting the history of County Louth, is housed in another restored building of the former distillery.

Dundalk Gaol was completed in 1855 and closed as a gaol in the 1930s. It was designed by John Neville, who was the county engineer at the time. The Governor&#x27;s House to the front of the Gaol became the Garda Station, and the two prison wings were later restored and divided between the &#x27;Oriel Centre&#x27; and the Louth County Archive. The neighbouring Louth County Infirmary (completed in 1834) was designed by English architect Thomas Smith in a neo-Tudor style with a central entrance-way flanked by two recessed ground floor arcades. It was purchased by Dundalk Grammar School in 2000.

The two oldest buildings in the town centre are Saint Nicholas&#x27;s Church of Ireland church and Seatown Castle. Saint Nicholas&#x27;s was built c. 1400. It comprises elements of 14th- 17th- and 18th-century church buildings, having been extended, damaged, rebuilt over the centuries, and finally reworked by Francis Johnston. It is known locally as the Green Church due to its green copper spire. It contains an epitaph erected to the memory of Scotland&#x27;s National Bard, Robert Burns. His sister, Agnes Burns, is buried in the church&#x27;s graveyard. Seatown Castle is at the junction of Mill Street and Castle Street. It is part of what was a Franciscan friary originally founded in the 13th century. A baptismal font in St. Nicholas&#x27;s is reputed to have come from the friary.

Further out from the town centre are Dún Dealgan Motte and Castle Roche. The former is also known as Cú Chulainn Castle and Byrne&#x27;s Folly and is a national monument. It sits on the site of the manor house built in the late 12th century by Bertram de Verdun when the Normans reached the area. A local pirate named Patrick Byrne built the castellated house now located on the site. Castle Roche was built by Bertram&#x27;s granddaughter, Roesia, and completed by her son, John, in the late 13th century.

A 20th century construction, which has won architectural awards, is the Carroll&#x27;s tobacco factory on the Dublin Road. It has been called &quot;a groundbreaking Irish factory design&quot;. The design, by Ronnie Tallon, is in the Miesian idiom. The first of the Louis le Brocquy Táin illustrations was commissioned for the factory. It became part of the Dundalk Institute of Technology campus in the 2010s. The &#x27;sails&#x27; sculpture to the front was designed by Gerda Frömel.

Many of the churches in the town were also built in the 19th century, including the Presbyterian church (1839), the former Methodist church (1834), and the Roman Catholic churches of St Patrick (1847), St Malachy (1862), St Nicholas (1860), and St Joseph (1890). St Patrick&#x27;s was designed by Thomas Duff, and modelled on King&#x27;s College Chapel, Cambridge. It was completed in 1847. Duff also designed the Presbyterian church on Jocelyn Street. The bell tower at St Patrick&#x27;s was added in 1903, modelled by George Ashlin on that of another English church, Gloucester Cathedral. Ashlin also designed the granite-built St Joseph&#x27;s Redemptorist monastery and church (finished in 1880 and 1892, respectively).

===Public spaces===

The largest park in the town centre is Ice House Hill. It is approximately . The site was once part of Dundalk House demesne (the stately home of the Earl of Clanbrassil). Dundalk House itself was demolished in the early 20th century to make way for an extension of the original P.J. Carroll tobacco factory. The original Ice House, built c. 1780, remains in the park and can be viewed from the outside. The smaller St. Helena Park is approximately and was first laid out in the 1800s. The bandstand was erected in the early 1920s. Most of the land which the park is on was reclaimed from the Castletown River. St Leonard&#x27;s Garden in Seatown is a small park restored in the 1960s from a cemetery that was closed in 1896 and allowed to become overgrown. Within the park are the ruined remains of stone walls from the friary founded by Bertram de Verdun in the 12th century.

The Navvy Bank (from &#x27;navigator&#x27;) is an artificial embankment constructed in the 1840s to facilitate the entry of shipping to Dundalk Port. It is approximately long and runs from Soldiers Point at the entrance to Dundalk Harbour, to near the present-day quay. It is now a public walkway. Along its route, there is a memorial to those who died in the sinking of the &quot;S.S. Dundalk&quot; during World War I. At Soldiers Point there is a bronze sculpture called &quot;The Sea God Managuan and Voyagers&quot; after a Celtic god of the sea.

Adjacent to the town of Dundalk is the village of Blackrock ( from the town centre), which has three public beaches. Blackrock was a fishing village before it became popular as a resort destination in the late 19th century. The promenade and sea wall, originally built in 1851, run along the length of the main beach and main street of the village. There are wetlands on both the north and south sides of the village, which are wildlife sanctuaries. In 2000, to mark the millennium year, a sundial / statue was erected in Blackrock on the promenade. The high gnomon is a bronze sculpture of a female diving figure, which was subsequently named &#x27;Aisling&#x27;.

 to the south-west of the town, between Haggardstown and Knockbridge, is Stephenstown Pond—a nature park. It was originally commissioned by Matthew Fortescue, owner of the nearby Stephenstown House, which is in ruins. It was designed by William Galt, husband of Agnes Burns.

 to the north of the town, within the municipal district, is Ravensdale Forest. It is mixed woodland rising steeply to the summit of Black Mountain, rising , with many kilometres of forest roads and tracks. There are three way-marked trails in the forest, the &quot;Táin Trail&quot;, the &quot;Ring of Gullion&quot; and the shorter &quot;Ravensdale Loop&quot;. It is managed by the Irish Forestry Service, &quot;Coillte&quot;.

==Education==
===Primary schools===
There are over 20 primary schools in Dundalk including some Irish language-medium schools (&quot;Gaelscoileanna&quot;) like &quot;Gaelscoil Dhún Dealgan&quot;. The largest schools in the area include Muire na nGael National School (also known as Bay Estate National School) and Saint Joseph&#x27;s National School, which (as of early 2020) had an enrolment of over 670 and 570 pupils respectively.

===Secondary schools===
Secondary schools in the town include Coláiste Lú (an Irish medium secondary school or &quot;Gaelcholáiste&quot;), De la Salle College, Dundalk Grammar School, St. Mary&#x27;s College (also known as the Marist), O&#x27;Fiaich College, Coláiste Rís, St. Vincent&#x27;s Secondary School, St. Louis Secondary School, and Coláiste Chú Chulainn.

===Tertiary education===
Dundalk Institute of Technology (abbreviated to DkIT) is the focal point for higher education and research on the Belfast-Dublin corridor, serving the North Leinster, South Ulster region. It was established in 1970 as the Regional Technical College, offering primarily technician and apprenticeship courses.

The Ó Fiaich Institute of Further Education also offers further education courses.

==Culture==
===Music and arts===
Dundalk has two centres for the arts—&quot;An Táin&quot; Arts Centre, an independent arts space in the former &quot;Táin&quot; Theatre, Town Hall, Crowe Street; and The Oriel Centre in the former Dundalk Gaol, a regional centre for &quot;Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann&quot;. The Oriel Centre is a resource centre and performance space, and has facilities for teaching, archives, recording, rehearsal, and performance. The Spirit Store, located at George&#x27;s Quay in the Port of Dundalk, is a gig venue in the town.

Dundalk Institute of Technology Department of Creative Arts, Media and Music has several groups and ensembles, including the &quot;Ceol Oirghiallla&quot; Traditional Music Ensemble, the DkIT Choir, the Music Theatre Group, the Oriel Traditional Orchestra, and the Fr. McNally Chamber Orchestra.

The Cross Border Orchestra of Ireland (CBOI) is a youth orchestra based at Coláiste Chu Chulainn, Dundalk. It was started as a peace initiative. Since 1996, it has toured internationally and has played at venues such as Carnegie Hall and the Royal Albert Hall. The Dundalk Brass Band was established in 1976 and performs a cross-section of big band and brass music.

===Festivals===

The Dundalk Show (also known as the Dundalk Agricultural Show and the County Louth Agricultural Show) has run since the 19th century. It was originally held at the Dundalk racecourse in Dowdallshill, before moving to the Fair Green, the grounds of St Mary&#x27;s College, Bellingham Castle, and latterly Bellurgan Park.

Other festivals / events in the town include the &quot;Frostival&quot; winter festival, which is held at the end of November, and an urban art festival called &#x27;Seek Dundalk&#x27;. Street murals painted as part of &quot;Seek&quot; include Edward Bruce, the engineer Peter Rice, and &quot;Cú Chulainn&quot;.

Within the wider Dundalk Municipal District, festivals and events also include the All-Ireland Poc Fada Championship held every year since 1960 on Annaverna Mountain on the Cooley Peninsula, and the Brigid of Faughart Festival.

The St. Gerard Majella Annual Novena is an annual religious festival held over nine days in St. Joseph&#x27;s Redemptorist Church in Dundalk. It runs in October. A patron takes place on 15 August at Ladywell Shrine, during the Feast of the Assumption. The Seatown Patron is held annually on 29 June (the feast day of Saint Peter, who is the patron saint of Seatown). The patron is celebrated by night-time bonfires, which is a tradition believed to have originated in medieval times.

The Dundalk Maytime Festival was the town&#x27;s largest festival and ran for 40 years starting in 1965. It started out as a &#x27;Grape and Grain&#x27; festival before later centring around amateur drama. It eventually ceased because of difficulties in securing sponsorship.

==Twin towns==

Dundalk is twinned with the following towns:
* Rezé, France (1990).
* Pikeville, Kentucky, United States (2015)

==Sport==

Dundalk Football Club is a professional association football club. The club competes in the League of Ireland Premier Division, the top tier of Irish football. The club was founded in 1903 as Dundalk G.N.R., the works-team of the Great Northern Railway. They were a junior club until they joined the Leinster Senior League in 1922–23. They were elected to the Free State League (which later became the League of Ireland) in 1926–27. The club has played at Oriel Park since moving from its original home at the Dundalk Athletic Grounds in 1936.

Gaelic football clubs in the town include Dundalk Gaels GFC, Seán O&#x27;Mahony&#x27;s GFC, Clan na Gael, Na Piarsaigh, Dowdallshill and Dundalk Young Irelands. Young Irelands (representing Louth) contested the first All-Ireland football final in 1888, losing to the Commercials club, representing Limerick.

The two hurling clubs in the town are Knockbridge GAA and Naomh Moninne H.C., who are the leading club in Louth with 22 county titles as of 2020. A founding member of Naomh Moninne, Father Pól Mac Sheáin, introduced the All-Ireland Poc Fada Championship in 1960.

Dundalk R.F.C. is an amateur Irish Rugby football club who compete in the Leinster League. The club first formed in 1877 and became founder members of the Provincial Towns Union, which then merged into what became the Northern Branch of the Irish Rugby Football Union. They moved to their present home ground at Mill Road in 1967.

The Dundalk Racecourse was reopened as Dundalk Stadium in 2007 and now holds both horse racing and greyhound racing meetings. It is Ireland&#x27;s first all-weather horse racing track. The stadium also hosts the Dundalk International greyhound race.
Golf was first played in Dundalk when a nine-hole course was laid out at Deer Park in 1893. The Dundalk Golf Club was founded in December 1904 at Deer Park, then moved to its present location in Blackrock in 1922. The current layout was designed by Peter Alliss and completed in 1980. The Ballymascanlon Hotel also has a parkland course. Greenore Golf Club (which is within the municipal district) was opened in October 1896 by the London and North Western Railway company, who owned a hotel in Greenore and the Dundalk, Newry and Greenore Railway. The members bought the club when the railway company closed the line and pulled out of Ireland. The modern course layout was designed by Eddie Hackett.

Dundalk has several game angling waters including the Dee, Glyde, Fane, Ballymascanlan and Castletown rivers. All these rivers flow into the Irish sea at Dundalk Bay. The rivers contain wild brown trout as well as salmon and sea trout. There is a Salmon Anglers Association and a Brown Trout Anglers Association. Sea Angling is available in several locations in the wider Municipal District and there is also a Sea Angling Club.

The Dundalk Lawn Tennis and Badminton Club was established in 1913. It is located at the Ramparts in the town centre. The club has nine tennis courts, two Olympic-standard badminton courts and two squash courts. A Dundalk and District Snooker League has been active since the 1940s. It was re-branded as the Dundalk Snooker League in 2010 and plays in the Commercial Club in the town centre. The amateur boxing club, Dealgan ABC, was founded in 1938. The first Dundalk Cricket Club was established in 1853 and the current club was formed in 2009. They play in Hiney Park, the former Dundalk F.C. training ground.

There are several athletics clubs, including St. Gerard&#x27;s A.C., St. Peter&#x27;s A.C, Dun Dealgan A.C. and Blackrock A.C., and a triathlon club (Setanta Triathlon Club). Cuchulainn Cycling Club was formed in 1935.

<text>Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion Virtual Machine (ScummVM) is a set of game engine recreations. Originally designed to play LucasArts adventure games that use the SCUMM system, it also supports a variety of non-SCUMM games by companies like Revolution Software and Adventure Soft. It was originally written by Ludvig Strigeus. ScummVM is free software that is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

ScummVM is a re-implementation of the part of the software used to interpret the scripting languages such games used to describe the game world rather than emulating the hardware the games ran on; as such, ScummVM allows the games it supports to be played on platforms other than those for which they were originally released with little or no overhead (due to not emulating the hardware), and without the bugs that might exist in the original software.

The team behind it also add improvements such as bug-fixes and translations and works with commercial companies such as GOG.com about re-releases.

==Features==
ScummVM is a program that supports numerous adventure game engines via virtual machines, allowing the user to play supported adventure games on their platform of choice. ScummVM provides none of the original assets for the games it supports, and expects the user to properly own the original game&#x27;s media so as to use the software legally. The official project website offers games that are freeware that work directly with ScummVM. Atop reimplementing the game executables in portable form, ScummVM enables players to save and load the state of the game at any time, enabling a save system atop whatever the reimplemented game may provide. It has also begun to work at providing alternate controls for newer devices, such as mobile devices with touch screens, which work atop the original games.

While ScummVM appears to function equivalently as a game emulator, the ScummVM team does not consider it as such. Outside of some subsystems like audio engines which they are forced to rely on emulation, ScummVM recreates game engines from older languages into more portable C++ code, so that the high-level opcodes in a game&#x27;s assets will execute in the same manner as their original release, while improving the portability of ScummVM to numerous platforms. The ScummVM team consider this an improvement over simply running the older games and their executables through an operating system emulator, such as DOSBox, since ScummVM&#x27;s implements are more lightweight and require less processing power and memory, allowing use on more limited processing environments like mobile devices.

===Ports===
Portability is a design goal of the project. Ports of ScummVM are available for Microsoft Windows, macOS and a variety of Unix-like systems including Linux (based on RPM, Debian, or source), members of the BSD family (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD) and Solaris. It has also been ported to console systems. Less mainstream personal computer ports include those to Amiga, Atari-FreeMiNT, Haiku-BeOS-ZETA, RISC OS, and OS/2 (including derivatives such as ArcaOS).

A variety of game consoles have official ports. ScummVM has been ported to gaming machines such as the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, GameCube, and Wii, and to handheld consoles including the GCW Zero, GP2X, Nintendo DS, Pandora, PlayStation Portable and the PS Vita. Handheld computer platforms supported include Palm OS Tapwave Zodiac, Symbian (UIQ platform, Nokia 60, 80, and Nokia 7710 90 phone series), Nokia&#x27;s Internet Tablet OS (used by the Nokia 770, N800 and N810), Apple&#x27;s iPhone, MotoMAGX, MotoEZX phones and Windows Mobile. Platforms supported by unofficial ScummVM ports include the Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox gaming console, BlackBerry PlayBook, Zaurus, Gizmondo and GP32 portable device platforms. Mobile phones running Android, webOS or unofficial Samsung&#x27;s bada OS are also supported.

==History==
Work on ScummVM started in September 2001 (with the first public release at October and a site launch at November) by computer science student Ludvig Strigeus. Looking to write his own adventure game, he looked to see how the mechanics of an existing game engine, specifically working to create a way to play &quot;Monkey Island 2&quot; on his Linux machine. At about the same time, Vincent Hamm was also looking to implement a SCUMM system player, and though he had done deeper research into understanding how the SCUMM engine worked, found that Strigeus was much further along, and the two joined to craft the project. While Strigeus finished the required implementation for &quot;Monkey Island 2&quot;, Hamm worked separately to prepare the engine for &quot;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&quot;, and once completed, the two found some dis-coordination on their efforts but eventually got the project working for both games.

News of ScummVM was picked up by the tech news website &quot;Slashdot&quot; in November 2001, drawing a large interest to the project, and several other developers became part of the project to help support other games. These developers often turned to the creators of the original games to obtain information in informal ways, to help create the reimplementation. Further developers helped to support games that did not use SCUMM, such as Adventure Soft&#x27;s &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot;; there was some debate about changing the name of the program at this point, but they ultimately kept the ScummVM title, believing that SCUMM was the most well-recognized adventure game engine. Strigeus had built support for iMUSE, the sound software used by many LucasArts games, but feared including it due to potential backlash from LucasArts. Other developers on the project advised him that there should be no legal issues and it was eventually included. Though Strigeus and Hamm would leave the project in 2002, by then it had a large enough development team to allow it to grow, led by James &quot;Ender&quot; Brown. Following this shift, the engine&#x27;s source code was changed from C to C++, and a graphical user interface (GUI) was added.

With increased awareness of the project, LucasArts sent a cease &amp; desist letter to the project, believing they were using some of LucasArts&#x27; proprietary code. Brown worked over the next four years with LucasArts&#x27; legal representatives to explain the nature of the project and the source of their information to demonstrate that what they had created was legal. Brown considered that LucasArts was trying to be accommodating as ScummVM helped to raise interest in these titles. They ultimately came to a legal agreement to allow ScummVM to continue to be developed.

The project would also incorporate other parallel efforts to make game reimplementations for other adventure games. Games from Sierra Online were of high demand for the project, requiring them to implement the Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) and the more advanced Sierra&#x27;s Creative Interpreter (SCI) engines. AGI support was added in 2006 by incorporating efforts from the Sarien project, but efforts for SCI support were hampered by the parallel project, FreeSCI. Though both ScummVM and FreeSCI aimed to reverse engineer the workings of SCI, FreeSCI had stated that they took a more clean-room approach to avoid any legal question about their reverse engineering, and believed the ScummVM project had run afoul of some of Sierra&#x27;s approaches and thus were hesitant to work together. However, FreeSCI began to languish in interest compared to ScummVM; after a developer took it upon themselves to make the FreeSCI engine work in ScummVM, the FreeSCI saw more participation in their project, and they agreed to merge their efforts into ScummVM. Initial SCI support was subsequently released in a 2010 version of ScummVM.

ScummVM continues to add new games or game engines, though the process to create these is relatively slow. According to the team&#x27;s project lead Eugene Sandulenko (as of 2017), game engines are chosen for inclusion into ScummVM either if they are given the source code that makes it easy to port into the software&#x27;s architecture, or if one or more of the team members are passionate about bringing a game engine into the program to do the difficult task of reconstructing the game&#x27;s code from the compiled versions. Initially ScummVM only included 2D game engines, leaving 3D games to be handled by the sister project &quot;ResidualVM&quot;, but in 2021 the two projects merged, lifting that restriction. The 2.0 version of ScummVM was released in December 2017, adding support for several full motion video games and some very obscure titles, such as &quot;Full Pipe&quot; and &quot;Plumbers Don&#x27;t Wear Ties&quot;. With this release, ScummVM has support for 64 different game engines.

Since around December 2017, ScummVM had been working support for Macromedia Director in coordination with some of the original developers. Macromedia Director was used for many mid-1990s video games such as &quot;The Journeyman Project&quot;. By August 2021, the first versions of ScummVM with Director support were released, with the team continuing to work on improving performance.

An attempt to bring in &quot;Another World&quot; by Éric Chahi brought some internal stress within the project in 2004. &quot;Another World&quot; was not a point-and-click adventure game, and used polygon-based graphics instead of pixel-based ones most adventure games employ, and thus was considered a serious departure from the focus of ScummVM. Though the project was scrapped in a few days after Chahi requested its removal as he was preparing a 15th anniversary remastered for sale, the current leads of the project had to refocus the group and define the ideals that ScummVM should meet.

ScummVM has also had difficulty in bringing games using the Adventure Game Studio (AGS), which is used frequently in indie adventure games, such as the &quot;Blackwell&quot; series. While the source code for AGS had been put into the open by its developer Chris Jones in 2010, the ScummVM team was met with a large backlash of complaints from developers using the AGS engine for their games, stating that they did not want to see their games run in ScummVM. Yet eventually a couple of years later AGS was tested in the development build, with a request to the public to beta test thousands of newly supported games, until all AGS v2.5+ games were officially added to the program, coinciding with its 20th anniversary in October 2021.

ScummVM has been a participant in the Google Summer of Code every year since 2007 except for 2015. A sister project, &quot;ResidualVM&quot;, was started to implement engines for three-dimensional adventure games, such as &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; and &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot;, named as such as these games reflect the residual of those not already covered by ScummVM. By late 2020, ResidualVM officially merged with ScummVM. This was completed with the version 2.5 release, coinciding with the program&#x27;s 20th anniversary in October 2021.

===Developer support===
According to Sandulenko &quot;there is no typical process&quot; when it comes to collaboration with developers: &quot;Everything is ad-hoc. What we do, we try to search for contact info of people who were working on the titles some developer is interested in, and we&#x27;re inquiring access to their original source code, if it still exists somewhere. Then we start working on it at our own pace&quot;.

With increased attention, ScummVM has entered into favorable agreements with adventure game developers to help bring their titles into the engine, or in some cases, being given source code and other assets to work from. Revolution Software helped the developers with source code and technical advice for its games, and once ScummVM supported the company&#x27;s Virtual Theatre engine, Revolution released &quot;Lure of the Temptress&quot; and &quot;Beneath a Steel Sky&quot; as freeware and provided assets from its first two &quot;Broken Sword&quot; games in an open media format. The renewed interest in these games from younger players enabled Revolution to work on two more &quot;Broken Sword&quot; games. Other developers that have worked closely with ScummVM include:

* Adventure Soft provided the original source code of their adventure games, &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot;, &quot;The Feeble Files&quot; and &quot;Elvira&quot; series.
* Alcachofa Soft: Emilio de Paz Aragón released the original source code of the adventure game &quot;&quot; as freeware.
* Creative Reality: Neil Dodwell and David Dew from Creative Reality released the original source code for their adventure &quot;Dreamweb&quot;, and the CD-ROM and floppy disk versions of the game as freeware, available for download on the ScummVM website.
* Gray Design Associates: David P. Gray provided the original source code of the &quot;Hugo&quot; trilogy.
* Interactive Binary Illusions released both the CD-ROM and the floppy disk version of their adventure game, &quot;Flight of the Amazon Queen&quot; as freeware available for download on the ScummVM website.
* Laboratorium Komputerowe Avalon: Janusz Wiśniewski and Mirosław Liminowicz released the original source code of their adventure game &quot;Sołtys&quot; as freeware, available for download on the ScummVM website.
* Perfect Entertainment: John Young, Colin Smythe and Terry Pratchett provided the original source code of their adventure games, &quot;Discworld&quot; and &quot;Discworld II: Missing Presumed...!?&quot;.
* Wyrmkeep Entertainment: Joe Pearce provided the original source code of their adventure game, &quot;Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb&quot;.

The digital storefront GOG.com which specializes in selling digital copies of older games, provides support to ScummVM, and sells titles that include the ScummVM engine as part of their distribution. Disney, which owns the rights to LucasArts adventure games, released &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; on Steam running off ScummVM.

===Development===
&quot;Operation Stealth&quot; and &quot;Future Wars&quot; support was added by integrating another stand-alone recreation of their engine: cinE. TrollVM has also been integrated into ScummVM adding support for three pre-AGI games: &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Space Adventure&quot;, &quot;Troll&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and &quot;Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood&quot;.

===Mistic&#x27;s GPL violations===
ScummVM is distributed as free software under the GPL-2.0-or-later license, enabling anyone to use the project as an engine for a game. For example, Revolution Software repackaged their &quot;Broken Sword&quot; games for a DVD release, using ScummVM with the included &quot;sword1&quot; and &quot;sword2&quot; engines to support modern computers.

In December 2008, the ScummVM team learned that the Wii ports of three Humongous Entertainment &quot;Junior Adventure&quot; titles (&quot;Freddi Fish and the Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds&quot;, &quot;Pajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It&#x27;s Dark Outside&quot;, and &quot;Spy Fox: Dry Cereal&quot;) all used the ScummVM engine without proper attribution. The games were published in August 2008 on request of Atari through Majesco Entertainment, who turned to Mistic Software to port the games. Mistic had used ScummVM for these, but failed to credit the developers. While the ScummVM team contacted gpl-violations.org for legal advice, Atari instead threatened to sue the ScummVM team, as the terms of Nintendo Wii development kit heavily restricted the use of open source software, including the GPL. A settlement was made in 2009, in which ScummVM would drop the investigation of the GPL violation, on the condition that Mistic would sell or destroy all GPL-violating copies of the games, make a donation to the Free Software Foundation, and pay the legal fees.

===ResidualVM===

ResidualVM (formerly Residual) was a cross-platform computer program comprising 3D game engine recreations with a common graphical user interface. It supports &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;, &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot;, and &quot;The Longest Journey&quot;. It merged with ScummVM in October 2020.

ResidualVM was originally designed to play LucasArts adventure games that use the GrimE game engine, and was later adapted to support other ones. Like ScummVM, the &quot;VM&quot; in ResidualVM stood for virtual machine.

ResidualVM is a reimplementation of the part of the software used to interpret the scripting languages by conducting reverse engineering on the original game rather than emulating the hardware on which the games ran. As such, ResidualVM allows the games it supports to be played on platforms other than those for which they were originally released.

The name of the project comes from the fact that it was originally started to support the residual LucasArts adventure games not supported by ScummVM. The original Lua-based engine used by LucasArts in their 3D adventure games was called GrimE (as opposed to SCUMM), so ResidualVM&#x27;s title is also a word pun as grime is a type of residue.

The project was started by former ScummVM team leader James Brown, and was first publicly available on August 15, 2003. Progress on the project was initially slow, and as a result the project&#x27;s main goal of supporting &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; did not occur until April 25, 2011, when the compatibility of &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; was upgraded to &quot;completable with a few minor glitches&quot;.

The project obtained a domain separate from ScummVM in December 2011. As a result of the new domain name, the project name was changed from Residual to ResidualVM. The logo was changed to reflect the new name in January 2012. The first stable release of ResidualVM was released 9 years after the project started, on December 21 the same year. It merged with ScummVM in October 2021.

====Support====
ResidualVM was officially available on multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, AmigaOS 4, and IRIX. In addition, an Android port is available in the source code, and unofficial builds have been made with that source. There is also a port available for the Pandora console, and for FreeBSD, but they are not official as they have not been added to the main branch.

With increased attention, ResidualVM entered into favorable agreements with adventure game developers to help bring their titles into the engine. Cyan Worlds partnered with ResidualVM to release &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot; on digital platforms.

The digital storefront GOG.com which specialized in selling digital copies of older games, sells &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot; with the &quot;ResidualVM&quot; engine as part of its distribution.

====ResidualVM supported games====
The stable release supports &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; and &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot;, which are completable with a few minor glitches.

In the development branch, there is also support for &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot;, which is completable with a few glitches, and The Longest Journey, which is completable with missing features.

Like ScummVM, ResidualVM contains fixes for bugs present in the original executable. The ResidualVM team discovered a workaround for a bug that causes a critical dialog not to play in &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;. In addition, the &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; engine in ResidualVM has fixes for over a dozen other bugs present in the original. There is also a branch of ResidualVM called Grim Mouse, which allows &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; to be played completely with a mouse as a traditional point and click adventure game.

<text>The Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw (), also known as the Kwakiutl (; &quot;Kwakʼwala-speaking peoples&quot;), are an indigenous group of the Pacific Northwest Coast, in southwestern Canada. Their total population, according to a 2016 census, was 3,665 people. Most live in their traditional territories on northern Vancouver Island, as well as nearby smaller islands (such as the Discovery Islands) and inland on the adjacent British Columbia mainland. Some also live outside their traditional homelands, in urban areas such as Victoria and Vancouver. They are politically-organized into 13 band governments.

The Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw language, now spoken by only 3.1% of the population, consists of four dialects of what is commonly referred to as Kwakʼwala, known as Kwak̓wala, &#x27;Nak̓wala, G̱uc̓ala and T̓łat̓łasik̓wala.

==Name==
The name &quot;Kwakiutl&quot; derives from &quot;Kwaguʼł&quot;—the name of a single community of Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw located at Fort Rupert. The anthropologist Franz Boas had done most of his anthropological work in this area and popularized the term for both this nation and the collective as a whole. The term became misapplied to mean all the nations who spoke Kwakʼwala, as well as three other Indigenous peoples whose language is a part of the Wakashan linguistic group, but whose language is not Kwakʼwala. These peoples, incorrectly known as the Northern Kwakiutl, were the Haisla, Wuikinuxv, and Heiltsuk.

Many people who others call &quot;Kwakiutl&quot; consider that name a misnomer.
They prefer the name &quot;Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw&quot;, which means &quot;Kwakʼwala-speaking-peoples&quot;.
One exception is the Laich-kwil-tach at Campbell River—they are known as the Southern Kwakiutl, and their council is the Kwakiutl District Council.

==History==

Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw oral history says their ancestors (&quot;ʼnaʼmima&quot;) came in the forms of animals via the land, sea and from underground. When one of these ancestral creatures arrived at a given spot, it shed its animal appearance and became human. Animals that figure in these origin myths include the Thunderbird and his brother, Kolas, the seagull, orca, grizzly bear, or chief ghost. Some ancestors have human origins and are said to come from distant places.

Historically, the Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw economy was based primarily on fishing, with the men also engaging in some hunting, and the women gathering wild fruits and berries. Ornate weaving and woodwork were important crafts, and wealth, defined by slaves and material goods, was prominently displayed and traded at potlatch ceremonies. These customs were the subject of extensive study by the anthropologist Franz Boas. In contrast to most non-native societies, wealth and status were not determined by how much you had, but by how much you had to give away. This act of giving away your wealth was one of the main acts in a potlatch.

The first documented contact with Europeans was with Captain George Vancouver in 1792. Disease, which developed as a result of direct contact with European settlers along the West Coast of Canada, drastically reduced the Indigenous Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw population during the late 19th-early 20th century. Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw population dropped by 75% between 1830 and 1880. The 1862 Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic alone killed over half of the people.

Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw dancers from Vancouver Island performed at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

An account of experiences of two founders of early residential schools for Aboriginal children was published in 2006 by the University of British Columbia Press. &quot;Good Intentions Gone Awry – Emma Crosby and the Methodist Mission On the Northwest Coast&quot; by Jan Hare and Jean Barman contains the letters and account of the life of the wife of Thomas Crosby, the first missionary in Lax Kwʼalaams (Port Simpson). This covers the period from 1870 to the turn of the 20th century.

A second book was published in 2005 by the University of Calgary Press, &quot;The Letters of Margaret Butcher – Missionary Imperialism on the North Pacific Coast&quot;, edited by Mary-Ellen Kelm. It picks up the story from 1916 to 1919 in Kitamaat Village and details of Butcher&#x27;s experiences among the Haisla people.

A review article entitled &quot;Mothers of a Native Hell&quot;, about these two books, was published in the British Columbia online news magazine &quot;The Tyee&quot; in 2007.

Restoring their ties to their land, culture and rights, the Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw have undertaken much in bringing back their customs, beliefs and language. Potlatches occur more frequently as families reconnect to their birthright, and the community uses language programs, classes and social events to restore the language. Artists in the 19th and 20th centuries, such as Mungo Martin, Ellen Neel and Willie Seaweed, have taken efforts to revive Kwakwakaʼwakw art and culture.

==Divisions==
Each Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw nation has its own clans, chiefs, history, culture and peoples, but remain collectively similar to the rest of the Kwak̓wala-Speaking nations.

==Society ==
===Kinship===
Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw kinship is based on a bilinear structure, with loose characteristics of a patrilineal culture. It has large extended families and interconnected community life. The Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw are made up of numerous communities or bands. Within those communities they are organized into extended family units or &quot;naʼmima,&quot; which means &#x27;of one kind&#x27;. Each &quot;naʼmima&quot; had positions that carried particular responsibilities and privileges. Each community had around four &quot;naʼmima&quot;, although some had more, some had less. 

Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw follow their genealogy back to their ancestral roots. A head chief who, through primogeniture, could trace his origins to that &quot;naʼmima&quot;&#x27;s ancestors delineated the roles throughout the rest of his family. Every clan had several sub-chiefs, who gained their titles and position through their own family&#x27;s primogeniture. These chiefs organized their people to harvest the communal lands that belonged to their family.

Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw society was organized into four classes: the nobility, attained through birthright and connection in lineage to ancestors, the aristocracy who attained status through connection to wealth, resources or spiritual powers displayed or distributed in the potlatch, commoners, and slaves. On the nobility class, &quot;the noble was recognized as the literal conduit between the social and spiritual domains, birthright alone was not enough to secure rank: only individuals displaying the correct moral behavior [sic] throughout their life course could maintain ranking status.&quot;

===Property===
As in other Northwest Coast peoples, the concept of property was well developed and important to daily life. Territorial property such as hunting or fishing grounds was inherited, and from these properties material wealth was collected and stored.

===Economy===
A trade and barter subsistence economy formed the early stages of the Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw economy. Trade was carried out between internal Kwakwakaʼwakw nations, as well as surrounding Indigenous nations such as the Tsimshian, Tlingit, the Nuu-chah-nulth and Coast Salish peoples.

Over time, the potlatch tradition created a demand for stored surpluses, as such a display of wealth had social implications. By the time of European colonialism, it was noted that wool blankets had become a form of common currency. In the potlatch tradition, hosts of the potlatch were expected to provide enough gifts for all the guests invited. This practice created a system of loan and interest, using wool blankets as currency.

As with other Pacific Northwest nations, the Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw highly valued copper in their economy and used it for ornament and precious goods. Scholars have proposed that prior to trade with Europeans, the people acquired copper from natural copper veins along riverbeds, but this has not been proven. Contact with European settlers, particularly through the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, brought an influx of copper to their territories. The Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw nations also were aware of silver and gold, and crafted intricate bracelets and jewellery from hammered coins traded from European settlers. Copper was given a special value amongst the Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw, most likely for its ceremonial purposes. This copper was beaten into sheets or plates, and then painted with mythological figures. The sheets were used for decorating wooden carvings or kept for the sake of prestige.

Individual pieces of copper were sometimes given names based on their value. The value of any given piece was defined by the number of wool blankets last traded for them. In this system, it was considered prestigious for a buyer to purchase the same piece of copper at a higher price than it was previously sold, in their version of an art market. During potlatch, copper pieces would be brought out, and bids were placed on them by rival chiefs. The highest bidder would have the honour of buying said copper piece. If a host still held a surplus of copper after throwing an expensive potlatch, he was considered a wealthy and important man. Highly ranked members of the communities often have the Kwakʼwala word for &quot;copper&quot; as part of their names.

Copper&#x27;s importance as an indicator of status also led to its use in a Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw shaming ritual. The copper cutting ceremony involved breaking copper plaques. The act represents a challenge; if the target cannot break a plaque of equal or greater value, he or she is shamed. The ceremony, which had not been performed since the 1950s, was revived by chief Beau Dick in 2013, as part of the Idle No More movement. He performed a copper cutting ritual on the lawn of the British Columbia Legislature on February 10, 2013, to ritually shame the Stephen Harper government.

==Culture==

The Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw are a highly stratified bilineal culture of the Pacific Northwest. They are many separate nations, each with its own history, culture and governance. The Nations commonly each had a head chief, who acted as the leader of the nation, with numerous hereditary clan or family chiefs below him. In some of the nations, there also existed &quot;Eagle Chiefs&quot;, but this was a separate society within the main society and applied to the potlatching only.

The Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw are one of the few bilineal cultures. Traditionally the rights of the family would be passed down through the paternal side, but in rare occasions, the rights could pass on the maternal side of their family also. Within the pre-colonization times, the Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw were organized into three classes: nobles, commoners, and slaves. The Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw shared many cultural and political alliances with numerous neighbours in the area, including the Nuu-chah-nulth, Heiltsuk, Wuikinuxv and some Coast Salish.

===Language===
The Kwakʼwala language is a part of the Wakashan language group. Word lists and some documentation of Kwakʼwala were created from the early period of contact with Europeans in the 18th century, but a systematic attempt to record the language did not occur before the work of Franz Boas in the late 19th and early 20th century. The use of Kwakʼwala declined significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries, mainly due to the assimilationist policies of the Canadian government. Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw children were forced to attend residential schools, which enforced English use and discouraged other languages. Although Kwakʼwala and Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw culture have been well-studied by linguists and anthropologists, these efforts did not reverse the trends leading to language loss. According to Guy Buchholtzer, &quot;The anthropological discourse had too often become a long monologue, in which the Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw had nothing to say.&quot;

As a result of these pressures, there are relatively few Kwakʼwala speakers today. Most remaining speakers are past the age of child-rearing, which is considered a crucial stage for language transmission. As with many other Indigenous languages, there are significant barriers to language revitalization. Another barrier separating new learners from the native speaker is the presence of four separate orthographies; the young are taught Uʼmista or NAPA, while the older generations generally use Boaz, developed by the American anthropologist Franz Boas.

A number of revitalization efforts are underway. A 2005 proposal to build a Kwakwakaʼwakw First Nations Centre for Language Culture has gained wide support. A review of revitalization efforts in the 1990s showed that the potential to fully revitalize Kwakʼwala still remained, but serious hurdles also existed.

===Arts===
In the old times, the Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw believed that art symbolized a common underlying element shared by all species.

Kwakwakaʼwakw arts consist of a diverse range of crafts, including totems, masks, textiles, jewellery and carved objects, ranging in size from transformation masks to tall totem poles. Cedar wood was the preferred medium for sculpting and carving projects as it was readily available in the native Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw regions. Totems were carved with bold cuts, a relative degree of realism, and an emphatic use of paints. Masks make up a large portion of Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw art, as masks are important in the portrayal of the characters central to Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw dance ceremonies.
Woven textiles included the &quot;Chilkat&quot; blanket, dance aprons and button cloaks, each patterned with Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw designs. The Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw used a variety of objects for jewellery, including ivory, bone, abalone shell, copper, silver and more. Adornments were frequently found on the clothes of important persons.

===Music===
Kwakwakaʼwakw music is the ancient art of the Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw peoples. The music is an ancient art form, stretching back thousands of years. The music is used primarily for ceremony and ritual, and is based on percussive instrumentation, especially log, box, and hide drums, as well as rattles and whistles. The four-day &quot;Klasila&quot; festival is an important cultural display of song and dance and masks; it occurs just before the advent of the &quot;tsetseka&quot;, or winter.

===Ceremonies and events===

====Potlatch====
The potlatch culture of the Northwest is well known and widely studied. It is still practised among the Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw, as is the lavish artwork for which they and their neighbours are so renowned. The phenomenon of the potlatch, and the vibrant societies and cultures associated with it, can be found in &quot;Chiefly Feasts: The Enduring Kwakiutl Potlatch&quot;, which details the incredible artwork and legendary material that go with the other aspects of the potlatch, and gives a glimpse into the high politics and great wealth and power of the Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw chiefs.

When the Canadian government was focused on assimilation of First Nations, it made the potlatch a target of activities to be suppressed. Missionary William Duncan wrote in 1875 that the potlatch was &quot;by far the most formidable of all obstacles in the way of Indians becoming Christians, or even civilized&quot;.

In 1885, the Indian Act was revised to include clauses banning the potlatch and making it illegal to practise. The official legislation read,

Oʼwax̱a̱laga̱lis, Chief of the Kwaguʼł &quot;Fort Rupert Tribes&quot;, said to anthropologist Franz Boas on October 7, 1886, when he arrived to study their culture:
Eventually the Act was amended, expanded to prohibit guests from participating in the potlatch ceremony. The Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw were too numerous to police, and the government could not enforce the law. Duncan Campbell Scott convinced Parliament to change the offence from criminal to summary, which meant &quot;the agents, as justice of the peace, could try a case, convict, and sentence&quot;.

Sustaining the customs and culture of their ancestors, in the 21st century the Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw openly hold potlatches to commit to the revival of their ancestors&#x27; ways. The frequency of potlatches has increased as occur frequently and increasingly more over the years as families reclaim their birthright.

===Housing and shelter===
The Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw built their houses from cedar planks, which are highly water resistant. They were very large, anywhere from long. The houses could hold about 50 people, usually families from the same clan. At the entrance, there was usually a totem pole carved with different animals, mythological figures and family crests.

===Clothing and regalia===
In summer, men wore no clothing except jewelry. In the winter, they usually rubbed fat on themselves to keep warm. In battle the men wore red cedar armor and helmets, and breech clouts made from cedar. During ceremonies they wore circles of cedar bark on their ankles as well as cedar breech clouts. The women wore skirts of softened cedar, and a cedar or wool blanket on top during the winter.

===Transportation===

Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw transportation was similar to that of other coastal people. Being an ocean and coastal people, they travelled mainly by canoe. Cedar dugout canoes, each made from one log, would be carved for use by individuals, families and communities. Sizes varied from ocean-going canoes, for long sea-worthy travel in trade missions, to smaller local canoes for inter-village travel. Some boats had buffalo fur inside to keep protection from the cold winters.

<text>Gary Stewart Hume (born 9 May 1962) is an English artist. Hume&#x27;s work is strongly identified with the YBA who came to prominence in the early 1990s. Hume lives and works in London and Accord, New York.

==Life and career==

Hume was born in 1962 in Tenterden, Kent. He attended Homewood School. He graduated from Goldsmiths College in 1988. His work was included in both Freeze, an exhibition organised by Damien Hirst in 1988, and East Country Yard, a warehouse exhibition organised by Henry Bond and Sarah Lucas in 1990.

Hume has become known for depicting everyday subjects using high-gloss industrial paints. His earliest notable works are his &quot;door paintings&quot;, life-size representations of hospital doors. These proved a critical success, being shown in Germany and the United States, as well as attracting the attention of collector Charles Saatchi. Hume&#x27;s work was included in the 1995 exhibition &quot;Brilliant!&quot;, a showcase of work by YBA artists. In 1997, his work was included in &quot;Sensation&quot;, a touring show of the Charles Saatchi art collection at the Royal Academy, London.

Hume abandoned doors in the mid-1990s, turning to paintings in household gloss paint on aluminium panel, for these often used appropriated images, including pictures of celebrities (e.g. DJ Tony Blackburn) and animals. Their forms and colours are dramatically simplified, with people being reduced to just two or three colours. &quot;Snowman&quot; (1996), for example, is made up of three shades of red, showing a circle on top of a larger circle against a lighter background. At first, Hume used mainly bright colours, but later pieces have used more muted tones.

Around 2005, Hume revisited his &quot;Door&quot; pictures, this time anthropomorphising the doors, arranging them into pairs of lovers and giving them the titles &quot;The Couple&quot; and &quot;The Argument&quot;. Hume&#x27;s &quot;Yellow Window&quot;, from 2002, broke records when sold at auction at Christie&#x27;s (which is now selling some other pieces of his work from George Michael&#x27;s collection). The work inspired a later limited edition entitled &quot;1000 Windows,&quot; produced for London&#x27;s Tate Modern in 2013.

Besides his London studio, Hume maintains a second studio in a converted barn on the grounds of a former chicken farm in New York&#x27;s Catskill Mountains region.
&quot;Liberty Grip&quot; is a 2008 sculpture in bronze by Hume, modelled in three discrete sections using the arm of a mannequin as a template, and exhibited at White Cube gallery in Bermondsey, London in 2013. The sculpture is today situated on a riverside path on the east side of the North Greenwich in south-east London, where it forms part of &quot;The Line&quot;, a public sculpture trail that very roughly follows the path of the Prime Meridian as it crosses the River Thames.

===Philosophy and approach to painting===
In 2012, Hume made an exhibition titled &#x27;Indifferent Owl&#x27;. Speaking about his work in 2011, Hume had stated, &#x27;Where I live in New York, there&#x27;s a wood. I heard an owl in the night. Next day I found one of those &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; balloons caught in the trees. It had almost deflated. I imagined the owl, utterly indifferent, watching the balloon float by as it slowly collapsed. That&#x27;s how I see life. I&#x27;m the owl, totally disengaged as the balloon bobs by...&#x27;
==Exhibitions==
Hume represented Great Britain at the 1999 Venice Biennale, where he showed his &quot;Water&quot; series, a number of superimposed line drawings of women (again, these were gloss paint on aluminium). His work was the subject of a one-person exhibition at Whitechapel Gallery, London, in 1999. Later monographic shows of Hume&#x27;s work were organised at the Kestnergesellschaft, Hannover, and the Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria, in 2004, and Modern Art Oxford mounted a survey show of his &quot;Door&quot; paintings in 2008.

==Recognition==
In 1996, Hume was nominated for the Turner Prize, but lost out to Douglas Gordon. He was later awarded Great Britain&#x27;s 1997 Jerwood Painting Prize. Hume was elected a Royal Academician in 2001.

<text>A food pyramid is a representation of the optimal number of servings to be eaten each day from each of the basic food groups. The first pyramid was published in Sweden in 1974. The 1992 pyramid introduced by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) was called the &quot;Food Guide Pyramid&quot; or &quot;Eating Right Pyramid&quot;. It was updated in 2005 to &quot;MyPyramid&quot;, and then it was replaced by &quot;MyPlate&quot; in 2011.

== Swedish origin ==
Amid high food prices in 1972, Sweden&#x27;s National Board of Health and Welfare developed the idea of &quot;basic foods&quot; that were both cheap and nutritious, and &quot;supplemental foods&quot; that added nutrition missing from the basic foods. Anna-Britt Agnsäter, chief of the test kitchen for Kooperativa Förbundet (a cooperative Swedish retail chain), held a lecture the next year on how to illustrate these food groups. Attendee Fjalar Clemes suggested a triangle displaying basic foods at the base. Agnsäter developed the idea into the first food pyramid, which was introduced to the public in 1974 in KF&#x27;s &quot;Vi&quot; magazine. The pyramid was divided into basic foods at the base, including milk, cheese, margarine, bread, cereals and potato; a large section of supplemental vegetables and fruit; and an apex of supplemental meat, fish and egg. The pyramid competed with the National Board&#x27;s &quot;dietary circle&quot;, which KF saw as problematic for resembling a cake divided into seven slices, and for not indicating how much of each food should be eaten. While the Board distanced itself from the pyramid, KF continued to promote it.

Food pyramids were developed in other Scandinavian countries, as well as West Germany, Japan and Sri Lanka. The United States later developed its first food pyramid in 1992.

== Food pyramid published by the WHO and FAO ==
The World Health Organization, in conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization, published guidelines that can be effectively represented in a food pyramid relating to objectives in order to prevent obesity, improper nutrition, chronic diseases and dental caries based on meta-analysis though they represent it as a table rather than as a &quot;pyramid&quot;. The structure is similar in some respects to the USDA food pyramid, but there are clear distinctions between types of fats, and a more dramatic distinction where carbohydrates are categorized on the basis of free sugars versus sugars in their natural form. Some food substances are singled out due to the impact on the target issues that the &quot;pyramid&quot; is meant to address. In a later revision, however, some recommendations are omitted as they automatically follow other recommendations while other sub-categories are added. The reports quoted here explain that where there is no stated lower limit in the table below, there is &quot;no&quot; requirement for that nutrient in the diet.

All percentages are &quot;percentages of calories&quot;, not of weight or volume. To understand why, consider the determination of an amount of &quot;10% free sugar&quot; to include in a day&#x27;s worth of calories. For the same amount of calories, free sugars take up less volume and weight, being refined and extracted &quot;from the competing carbohydrates in their natural form&quot;. In a similar manner, all the items are in competition for various categories of calories.

The representation as a pyramid is not precise, and involves variations due to the alternative percentages of different elements, but the main sections can be represented.

== USDA food pyramid ==

=== History ===

The USDA food pyramid was created in 1992 and divided into six horizontal sections containing depictions of foods from each section&#x27;s food group. It was updated in 2005 with black and white vertical wedges replacing the horizontal sections and renamed MyPyramid. MyPyramid was often displayed with the food images absent, creating a more abstract design.
In an effort to restructure food nutrition guidelines, the USDA rolled out its new MyPlate program in June 2011. My Plate is divided into four slightly different sized quadrants, with fruits and vegetables taking up half the space, and grains and protein making up the other half. The vegetables and grains portions are the largest of the four.

A modified food pyramid was proposed in 1999 for adults aged over 70.

==== Vegetables ====
A vegetable is a part of a plant consumed by humans that is generally savory but is not sweet. A vegetable is not considered a grain, fruit, nut, spice, or herb. For example, the stem, root, flower, etc., may be eaten as vegetables. Vegetables contain many vitamins and minerals; however, different vegetables contain different balances of micronutrients, so it is important to eat a wide variety of types. For example, orange and dark green vegetables typically contain vitamin A, dark green vegetables contain vitamin C, and vegetables like broccoli and related plants contain iron and calcium. Vegetables are very low in fats and calories, but ingredients added in preparation can often add them.

==== Grains ====
These foods provide complex carbohydrates, which are the body&#x27;s primary source of energy and provide quality nutrition in any case. Examples include corn, wheat, pasta, and rice. Grains, when digested, break down into glucose, the body&#x27;s preferred energy source. Complex carbohydrates also provide dietary fiber, which supports digestive health and lowers the risk of heart disease.

==== Fruits ====
In terms of food (rather than botany), fruits are the sweet-tasting seed-bearing parts of plants, or occasionally sweet parts of plants which do not bear seeds.
These include apples, oranges, grapes, bananas, etc. Fruits are low in calories and fat and are a source of natural sugars, fiber and vitamins. Processing fruit when canning or making into juices may add sugars and remove nutrients. The fruit food group is sometimes combined with the vegetable food group. Note that a massive number of different plant species produce seed pods which are considered fruits in botany, and there are a number of botanical fruits which are conventionally not considered fruits in cuisine because they lack the characteristic sweet taste, e.g., tomatoes or avocados.

==== Dairy ====
Dairy products are produced from the milk of [animals]]s, usually but not exclusively cattle. They include milk, yogurt and cheese. Milk and its derivative products are a rich source of dietary calcium and also provide protein, phosphorus, vitamin A, and vitamin D. However, many dairy products are high in saturated fat and cholesterol compared to vegetables, fruits and whole grains, which is why skimmed products are available as an alternative.
Historically, adults were recommended to consume three cups of dairy products per day. More recently, evidence is mounting that dairy products have greater levels of negative effects on health than previously thought and confer fewer benefits. For example, recent research has shown that dairy products are not related to stronger bones or less fractures; on the contrary, another study showed that milk (and yogurt) consumption results in higher bone mineral density in the hip. Overall, the majority of research suggests that dairy has some beneficial effects on bone health, in part because of milk&#x27;s other nutrients.

==== Meat and beans ====
Meat is the tissue—usually muscle—of an animal consumed by humans. Since most parts of many animals are edible, there is a vast variety of meats. Meat is a major source of protein, as well as iron, zinc, and vitamin B12. The category of meats, poultry, and fish include beef, chicken, pork, salmon, tuna, shrimp, and eggs.

The meat group is one of the major compacted food groups in the food guide pyramid. Since many of the same nutrients found in meat can also be found in foods like eggs, dry beans, and nuts, such foods are typically placed in the same category as meats, as meat alternatives. These include tofu, products that resemble meat or fish but are made with soy, eggs, and cheeses. For those who do not consume meat or animal products (&quot;see Vegetarianism, veganism and Taboo food and drink&quot;), meat analogs, tofu, beans, lentils, chickpeas, nuts and other high-protein vegetables are also included in this group. The food guide pyramid suggests that adults eat 2–3 servings per day. One serving of meat is , about the size of a deck of cards.

==== Oils and sweets ====
A food pyramid&#x27;s tip is the smallest part, so the fats and sweets in the top of the Food Pyramid should comprise the smallest percentage of the diet. The foods at the top of the food pyramid should be eaten sparingly because they provide calories, but not much in the way of nutrition. These foods include salad dressings, oils, cream, butter, margarine, sugars, soft drinks, candies, and sweet desserts. On the 1992–2005 pyramid, the fat circle and sugar triangle are scattered throughout the pyramid to represent the naturally-occurring fats and sugars in various foods. The idea of this is to reduce the temptation to eat so much junk food and excessive fats and sugars, as there is already enough fat and sugar in the rest of the diet. For example, the triangles in the Fruit Group represent the fact that sugar is inevitable in that group.

== Criticism and controversy ==
Certain dietary choices that have been linked to heart disease, such as an serving of hamburger daily, were technically permitted under the pyramid. The pyramid also lacked differentiation within the protein-rich group (&quot;Meat, Poultry, Fish, Dry Beans, Eggs, and Nuts&quot;). The development of the US food pyramid has been influenced by food lobbyists undermining its credibility.

In April 1991, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) halted publication of its Eating Right Pyramid, due to objections raised by meat and dairy lobbying groups concerning the guide’s display of their products. Despite the USDA’s explanations that the guide required further research and testing, it was not until one year later—after its content was supported by additional research—that the Eating Right Pyramid was officially released. This time, even the guide’s graphic design was altered to appease industry concerns. This incident was only one of many in which the food industry attempted to alter federal dietary recommendations in their own economic self-interest.

Some of the recommended quantities for the different types of food in the old pyramid have also come under criticism for lack of clarity. For instance, the pyramid recommends two to three servings from the protein-rich group, but this is intended to be a maximum. The pyramid recommends two to four fruit servings, but this is intended to be the minimum.

The fats group as a whole have been put at the tip of the pyramid, under the direction to eat as little as possible, which some people have considered problematic. The guide instructs people to limit fat intake as much as possible, which can cause health problems because fat is essential to overall health. Research suggests that unsaturated fats aid in weight loss, reduce heart disease risk, lower blood sugar, and even lower cholesterol. Also, they are very long sustaining, and help keep blood sugar at a steady level. On top of that, these fats help brain function as well.

Several researchers have said that food and agricultural associations exert undue political power on the USDA. Food industries, such as milk companies, have been accused of influencing the United States Department of Agriculture into making the colored spots on the newly created food pyramid larger for their particular product. The milk section has been described as the easiest to see out of the six sections of the pyramid, making individuals believe that more milk should be consumed on a daily basis compared to the others. Furthermore, the inclusion of milk as a group unto itself implies that is an essential part of a healthy diet, despite the many people who are lactose intolerant or choose to abstain from dairy, and a number of cultures that have historically consumed little if any dairy products. Joel Fuhrman says in his book &quot;Eat to Live&quot; that U.S. taxpayers must contribute 20 billion on price supports to artificially reduce the price of cattle feed to benefit the dairy, beef and veal industries, and then pay the medical bills for an overweight population. He asks if the USDA is under the influence of the food industry, because a food pyramid based on science would have vegetables at its foundation.

These controversies prompted the creation of pyramids for specific audiences, including a Vegetarian Diet Pyramid.

The successor to the Food Pyramid called MyPlate has also received numerous criticisms, but unlike the Food Pyramid, which was very well known, the MyPlate program has yet to become publicly well known, with as many as &quot;3 out of 4 Americans [having] no idea what the government&#x27;s MyPlate dietary guide [even] is.&quot;

== MyPlate ==

MyPlate is the current nutrition guide published by the United States Department of Agriculture, depicting a place setting with a plate and glass divided into five food groups. It replaced the USDA&#x27;s MyPyramid guide on June 2, 2011, concluding 19 years of USDA food pyramid diagrams.
