<text>John Robert Fowles (; 31 March 1926 – 5 November 2005) was an English novelist, critically positioned between modernism and postmodernism. His work was influenced by Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, among others.

After leaving Oxford University, Fowles taught English at a school on the Greek island of Spetses, a sojourn that inspired &quot;The Magus&quot; (1965), an instant best-seller that was directly in tune with 1960s &quot;hippy&quot; anarchism and experimental philosophy. This was followed by &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1969), a Victorian-era romance with a postmodern twist that was set in Lyme Regis, Dorset, where Fowles lived for much of his life. Later fictional works include &quot;The Ebony Tower&quot; (1974), &quot;Daniel Martin&quot; (1977), &quot;Mantissa&quot; 
(1982), and &quot;A Maggot&quot; (1985).

Fowles&#x27;s books have been translated into many languages, and several have been adapted as films.

==Early life ==

===Birth and family===
Fowles was born in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, England, the only son and elder child (a sister, Hazel, was born fifteen years later) of Robert John Fowles and Gladys May, née Richards. His father had trained as a lawyer—&quot;clerking and reading in a barrister&#x27;s chambers&quot;—but worked for the family business, tobacco importer Allen &amp; Wright, as his father Reginald had been a partner in the company; at Reginald&#x27;s death, Robert was obliged to run the firm as his brother had died in the Battle of Ypres and there were young dependent half-siblings to provide for from his father&#x27;s second marriage. Gladys was daughter of John Richards, a draper, and his wife Elizabeth, who was in service. They came from Cornwall to London, where John became chief buyer for a department store, and gave their daughter a &quot;comfortable upbringing in Chelsea&quot;, but they relocated to Westcliff-on-Sea in Essex on account of the healthier climate following the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. On returning from the First World War in bad health, having served for three years as an officer in the Honourable Artillery Company, Robert Fowles met his future wife at a Westcliff-on-Sea tennis club.

===Education===

During his childhood Fowles was attended by his mother and his cousin Peggy Fowles, who was 18 years his senior. He attended Alleyn Court Preparatory School, where a maternal uncle and aunt were teachers.

In 1939, he won a place at Bedford School, where he remained a pupil until 1944. He became head boy and was an athletic standout: a member of the rugby football third team, the fives first team, and captain of the cricket team, for which he was a bowler.

After leaving Bedford School, Fowles enrolled in a Naval Short Course at the University of Edinburgh and was prepared to receive a commission in the Royal Marines. He completed his training on 8 May 1945 and was then assigned to Okehampton Camp, Devon, for two years.

After completing his military service in 1947, Fowles entered New College, Oxford, where he studied both French and German, although he stopped studying German and concentrated on French for his BA. Fowles was undergoing a political transformation. Upon leaving the marines, he wrote, &quot;I ... began to hate what I was becoming in life—a British Establishment young hopeful. I decided instead to become a sort of anarchist.&quot;

It was also at Oxford that Fowles first considered life as a writer, particularly after reading existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. He has also commented that the ambience of Oxford at the time, where such existentialist notions of &quot;authenticity&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; were pervasive, influenced him. Though Fowles did not identify as an existentialist, their writing was motivated from a feeling that the world was absurd, a feeling he shared.

== Career ==

=== Teaching ===
Fowles spent his early adult life as a teacher. His first year after Oxford was spent at the University of Poitiers. At the end of the year, he received two offers: one from the French department at Winchester, the other &quot;from a ratty school in Greece,&quot; Fowles said: &quot;Of course, I went against all the dictates of common sense and took the Greek job.&quot;

In 1951, Fowles became an English master at the Anargyrios and Korgialenios School of Spetses on the Peloponnesian island of Spetses (also known as Spetsai). This opened a critical period in his life, as the island was where he met his future wife. Inspired by his experiences and feelings there, he used it as the setting of his novel &quot;The Magus&quot; (1966). Fowles was happy in Greece, especially outside the school. He wrote poems that he later published, and became close to his fellow expatriates. But during 1953, he and the other masters at the school were all dismissed for trying to institute reforms, and Fowles returned to England.

On the island of Spetses, Fowles had developed a relationship with Elizabeth Christy, née Whitton, then married to another teacher, Roy Christy. That marriage was already ending because of Fowles. Although they returned to England at the same time, they were no longer in each other&#x27;s company. It was during this period that Fowles began drafting &quot;The Magus&quot;.

His separation from Elizabeth did not last long. On 2 April 1957, they were married. Fowles became stepfather to Elizabeth&#x27;s daughter from her first marriage, Anna. For nearly ten years, he taught English as a foreign language to students from other countries at St. Godric&#x27;s College, an all-girls establishment in Hampstead, London.

===Literary career===

In late 1960, though he had already drafted &quot;The Magus&quot;, Fowles began working on &quot;The Collector&quot;. He finished his first draft of &quot;The Collector&quot; in a month, but spent more than a year making revisions before showing it to his agent. Michael S. Howard, the publisher at Jonathan Cape, was enthusiastic about the manuscript. The book was published in 1963 and when the paperback rights were sold in the spring of that year, it was &quot;probably the highest price that had hitherto been paid for a first novel,&quot; according to Howard. British reviewers found the novel to be an innovative thriller, and several American critics detected a serious promotion of existentialist thought.

The success of &quot;The Collector&quot; meant that Fowles could stop teaching and devote himself full-time to a literary career. Film rights to the book were optioned and it was adapted as a feature film of the same name in 1965. Against the advice of his publisher, Fowles insisted that his second published book be &quot;The Aristos&quot;, a non-fiction collection of philosophy essays. Afterward, he set about collating all the drafts he had written of what would become his most studied work, &quot;The Magus&quot;.

In 1965 Fowles left London, moving to Underhill, a farm on the fringes of Lyme Regis, Dorset. The isolated farm house became the model for &quot;The Dairy&quot; in the book Fowles was writing: &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1969). Finding the farm too remote, (&quot;total solitude gets a bit monotonous,&quot; Fowles remarked), in 1968 he and his wife moved to Belmont, in Lyme Regis (Belmont was formerly owned by Eleanor Coade), which Fowles used as a setting for parts of &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot;. In this novel, Fowles created one of the most enigmatic female characters in literary history. His conception of femininity and myth of masculinity as developed in this text is psychoanalytically informed.

In the same year, he adapted &quot;The Magus&quot; for cinema, and the film was released in 1968. The film version of &quot;The Magus&quot; (1968) was generally considered awful; when Peter Sellers was asked whether he would make changes in his life if he had the opportunity to do it all over again, he jokingly replied, &quot;I would do everything exactly the same except I wouldn&#x27;t see &quot;The Magus&quot;.&quot;

&quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1969) was released to critical and popular success. It was translated into more than ten languages, and established Fowles&#x27;s international reputation. It was adapted as a feature film in 1981 with a screenplay by the noted British playwright (and later Nobel laureate) Harold Pinter, and starring Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons.

Fowles lived the rest of his life in Lyme Regis. His works &quot;The Ebony Tower&quot; (1974), &quot;Daniel Martin&quot; (1977), &quot;Mantissa&quot; (1982), and &quot;A Maggot&quot; (1985) were all written from Belmont House. In 1980 he wrote a highly appreciative introduction to G. B. Edwards&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Ebenezer Le Page&quot; (Hamish Hamilton, 1981), the fictional autobiography set in Guernsey: &#x27;There may have been stranger literary events than the book you are about to read but I rather doubt it&#x27; (reprinted in his &quot;Wormholes: Essays and Occasional Writings&quot;, ed. Jan Relf (Jonathan Cape, 1998), pp. 166–74.

Fowles composed a number of poems and short stories throughout his life, most of which were lost or destroyed. In December 1950 he wrote &quot;My Kingdom for a Corkscrew&quot;. &quot;For A Casebook&quot; (1955) was rejected by various magazines. In 1970 he wrote &quot;The Last Chapter&quot;.

In 2008 Fowles was named by &quot;The Times&quot; as one of the fifty greatest British writers since 1945.

== Personal life ==
Fowles served as the curator of the Lyme Regis Museum from 1979 to 1988, retiring from the museum after having a mild stroke. He was occasionally involved in local politics, writing letters to &quot;The Times&quot; advocating preservation. Despite this involvement, he was generally considered reclusive.

In 1990, his first wife Elizabeth died of cancer, only a week after she was diagnosed. Her death affected him severely, and he did not write for a year. In 1998, he was quoted in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; as saying, &quot;Being an atheist is a matter not of moral choice, but of human obligation.&quot;

In 1998, Fowles married his second wife, Sarah Smith. With Sarah by his side, he died of heart failure on 5 November 2005, aged 79, in Axminster Hospital, from Lyme Regis.

In 2008, Elena van Lieshout presented a series of 120 love letters and postcards for auction at Sotheby&#x27;s. The correspondence started in 1990, when Fowles was aged 65. Elena, a young Welsh admirer and a student at St. Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford, contacted the reclusive author and they developed a sensitive, albeit unconsummated, relationship.

== Controversy ==
Following Fowles&#x27;s death in 2005, his unpublished diaries from 1965 to 1990 were revealed to contain racist and homophobic statements, with particular ire towards Jewish people. He described rare book dealer Rick Gekoski as &quot;Too Jewish for English tastes ... bending to the way of the wind, or the business and money pressure&quot;, and wrote a consciously antisemitic poem about publishers Tom Maschler and Roger Straus.

<text>Sir Barrington Windsor Cunliffe (born 10 December 1939), known as Barry Cunliffe, is a British archaeologist and academic. He was Professor of European Archaeology at the University of Oxford from 1972 to 2007. Since 2007, he has been an emeritus professor.

==Biography==
Cunliffe&#x27;s decision to become an archaeologist was sparked at the age of nine by the discovery of Roman remains on his uncle&#x27;s farm in Somerset. Cunliffe studied at Portsmouth Northern Grammar School (now the Mayfield School) and read archaeology and anthropology at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. While a student at the University of Cambridge, he ran and won an election against his course mate and fellow Johnian Colin Renfrew in order to become president of the University of Cambridge Archaeological Field Club (AFC). He became a lecturer at the University of Bristol in 1963. Fascinated by the Roman remains in nearby Bath he embarked on a programme of excavation and publication.

In 1966, he became an unusually young professor when he took the chair at the newly founded Department of Archaeology at the University of Southampton. There he became involved in the excavation (1961–1968) of the Fishbourne Roman Palace in West Sussex. Another site in southern England led him away from the Roman period. He began a long series of summer excavations (1969–1988) of the Iron Age hill fort at Danebury, Hampshire and was subsequently involved in the Danebury Environs Programme (1989–1995). His interest in Iron Age Britain and Europe generated a number of publications and he became an acknowledged authority on the Celts.

Other sites he has worked on include Hengistbury Head in Dorset, Mount Batten in Devon, Le Câtel in Jersey, and Le Yaudet in Brittany, reflecting his interest in the communities of Atlantic Europe during the Iron Age. In his later works, he sets out the thesis that Celtic culture originated along the length of the Atlantic seaboard in the Bronze Age before being taken inland, which stands in contrast to the more generally accepted view that Celtic origins lie with the Hallstatt culture of the Alps. One of his most recent projects has been in the Najerilla valley, La Rioja, Spain, which straddles &quot;the interface between the Celtiberian heartland of central Iberia and the Atlantic zone of the Bay of Biscay&quot;.

Cunliffe was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy in 1979. He lives with his wife in Oxford.

Cunliffe inspired the name for the character &quot;Currant Bunliffe&quot;, an archaeologist in David Macaulay&#x27;s 1979 book, &quot;Motel of the Mysteries&quot;.

<text>Nelson&#x27;s Column is a monument in Trafalgar Square in the City of Westminster, Central London, built to commemorate Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson&#x27;s decisive victory at the Battle of Trafalgar over the combined French and Spanish navies, during which he was killed by a French sniper. The monument was constructed between 1840 and 1843 to a design by William Railton at a cost of . It is a column of the Corinthian order built from Dartmoor granite. The statue of Nelson was carved from Craigleith sandstone by sculptor Edward Hodges Baily. The four bronze lions around its base, designed by Sir Edwin Landseer, were added in 1867.

The pedestal is decorated with four bronze relief panels, each square, cast from captured French guns. They depict the Battle of Cape St. Vincent, the Battle of the Nile, the Battle of Copenhagen and the death of Nelson at Trafalgar. The sculptors were Musgrave Watson, William F. Woodington, John Ternouth and John Edward Carew, respectively. The ornate capital upon which Nelson stands is by Charles Harriott Smith.

It was refurbished in 2006 at a cost of , at which time it was surveyed and found to be shorter than previously supposed. The whole monument is tall from the bottom of the pedestal to the top of Nelson&#x27;s hat.

==Construction and history==
In February 1838, a group of 121 peers, Members of Parliament (MPs) and other gentry formed a committee to raise a monument to Lord Nelson, funded by public subscription, and the government agreed to provide a site in Trafalgar Square, in front of the newly completed National Gallery. A competition was held for designs with an estimated budget of between £20,000 and £30,000. The deadline for submissions was 31 January 1839.

The winning entry, chosen by the sub-committee headed by the Duke of Wellington was a design by William Railton for a Corinthian column, surmounted by a statue of Nelson, and flanked by four sculpted lions. Flights of steps would lead up between the lions to the pedestal of the column. Several other entrants also submitted schemes for columns. The second prize was won by Edward Hodges Baily who suggested an obelisk surrounded by sculptures.

Criticism of the organisation of the competition caused it to be re-run. Railton submitted a slightly revised design, and was once again declared the winner, with the stipulation that the statue of Nelson should be made by Baily. The original plan was for a column high, including the base and statue, but this was reduced to with a shaft of due to concerns over stability. The base was to have been of granite and the shaft of Craigleith sandstone, but before construction began it was decided that the shaft should also be of granite.

Excavations for the brick foundations had begun by July 1840. On 30 September 1840, the first stone of the column was laid by Charles Davison Scott, honorary secretary of the committee (and son of Nelson&#x27;s secretary, John Scott), at a ceremony conducted, according to the &quot;Nautical Magazine&quot;, &quot;in a private manner, owing to the noblemen and gentlemen comprising the committee being absent from town&quot;. Construction of the monument, by the contractors Grissell and Peto, progressed slowly, and the stonework, ready for the installation of the statue, was not completed until November 1843.

In 1844, the Nelson Memorial Committee ran out of money, having only raised £20,485 in public subscriptions, and the government, in the form of the Office of Woods and Forests took over the project.

Installation of the bronze reliefs on the pedestal did not begin until late 1849, when John Edward Carew&#x27;s depiction of the death of Nelson was put in place on the side facing Whitehall. This was followed early the next year by William F. Woodington&#x27;s relief of the Battle of the Nile on the opposite side. Carew&#x27;s relief was cast by Adams, Christie and Co. of Rotherhithe. The other three were cast by Moore, Fressange and Moore. The last to be made, &quot;The Battle of Cape St. Vincent&quot; became the subject of legal action, when it was discovered that the bronze had been adulterated with iron. The partners in the company were jailed for fraud and the relief was completed by Robinson and Cottam. It was finally put in place in May 1854.
The statue at the top was sculpted by Edward Hodges Baily R.A. from three pieces of Craigleith type sandstone donated by Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch, former chairman of the Nelson Memorial Committee, from his own quarry at Granton, Edinburgh.

The statue stands on a fluted column built from solid blocks of granite from the Foggintor quarries on Dartmoor. The Corinthian capital is made of bronze elements, cast from cannon salvaged from the wreck of HMS &quot;Royal George&quot; at the Woolwich Arsenal foundry. It is based on the Temple of Mars Ultor in Rome, and was modelled by C. H. Smith. The bronze pieces, some weighing as much as are fixed to the column by the means of three large belts of metal lying in grooves in the stone.

The column also had a symbolic importance to Adolf Hitler. If Hitler&#x27;s plan to invade Britain, Operation Sea Lion, had been successful, he planned to move it to Berlin.

==Lions==
The four identical bronze Barbary lions at the column&#x27;s base were not added until 1867. At one stage they were intended to be of granite, and the sculptor John Graham Lough was chosen to carve them. However, in 1846, after consultations with Railton, he turned down the commission, unwilling to work under the restrictions imposed by the architect.

Thomas Milnes received the commission in 1858, and produced four full-scale models in sandstone, each individualised to represent Peace, War, Vigilance and Determination. These were rejected, and the commission was transferred, again, to Sir Edwin Landseer. Subsequently mill owner Sir Titus Salt bought the statues instead for a civic building at the centre of his workers village, installed on pedestals in 1869. The four sandstone Lions now have Grade II* listed building status.

The sculptures eventually installed were designed by Sir Edwin Landseer in collaboration with Carlo Marochetti. Landseer was a hugely popular painter and the favourite of Queen Victoria. Their design may have been influenced by Marschalko János&#x27;s lions at each abutment to the Széchenyi Chain Bridge in Budapest, installed six years before the Trafalgar Square lions were commissioned.

Landseer requested casts of a real lion from Turin which did not arrive until 1860. In the meantime, he made sketches of lions at London Zoo and eventually received the corpse of one to work with. Delays in completing the work meant that the corpse started to decompose, leading to some discrepancies in form. The paws, for example, were based on those of a cat, and the sculpted lion&#x27;s backs are concave rather than convex.

The sculptures were eventually installed in 1867. Landseer was paid £6,000 for his services, and Marochetti £11,000.

In 2011, consultants for the Greater London Authority reported that tourists climbing onto the backs of the lions have caused considerable damage and recommended banning tourists from climbing them.

==Refurbishment==
The column was renovated and cleaned by sandblasting in 1968.

The column was refurbished in 2006, during which time it was scaffolded from top to bottom for access. Steam cleaning was used, together with gentle abrasives, in order to minimise any harmful impact on the bronze and stonework. The £420,000 cost was covered by Zurich Financial Services, which advertised on the scaffolding for the duration of the work. Before restoration began, laser surveys were taken during which it was found that the column was significantly shorter than the usually quoted . In fact, it measures from the bottom of the first step to the tip of the admiral&#x27;s hat.

==Publicity stunts and protests==
John Noakes of the BBC TV children&#x27;s programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot; climbed the column in 1977. Television presenter and entertainer Gary Wilmot climbed the column in 1989 for LWT&#x27;s &quot;Six O&#x27; Clock Show&quot; to recreate the &#x27;topping out&#x27; ceremony of 1843. Dressed in Victorian attire and sporting a boater hat, Wilmot enjoyed tea and sandwiches at the top of the column before climbing down.

The column has also been climbed on several occasions as a publicity stunt to draw attention to social or political causes. Ed Drummond made the first such climb in 1978 for the Anti-Apartheid Movement, making use of the lightning conductor &quot;en route&quot;. On 30 March 1988, Joe Simpson and John Stevenson climbed the column as part of a Greenpeace Campaign against Acid rain. On 14 June 1992, it was climbed by Martin Cotterrel, Joe Simpson and John Stevenson on behalf of Greenpeace to protest against the first Earth Summit meeting in Brazil. On 13 April 1995, Simon Nadin free-climbed Nelson&#x27;s Column with Noel Craine, Jerry Moffatt and Johnny Dawes following on top rope, and graded the climb as &quot;E6 6b/5a&quot;. This protest time was on behalf of Survival International to publicize the plight of Canadian Inuit. On 13 May 1998, the Column was climbed by Al Baker, Peter Morris and John Cunningham on behalf of Greenpeace to protest against Old growth logging activity in British Columbia. In May 2003, BASE jumper and stuntman Gary Connery parachuted from the top of the column, in a stunt designed to draw attention to the Chinese policies in Tibet.

In December 2015, Disney paid £24,000 to cover it in lights to make it resemble a giant lightsaber, to promote &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;.

On 18 April 2016, in the early hours of the morning, Greenpeace activists climbed up the column and placed a breathing mask on Admiral Lord Nelson in protest of air pollution levels.

==Other monuments to Nelson==

The first civic monument to be erected in Nelson&#x27;s honour was the Nelson Monument, a 44-metre high obelisk on Glasgow Green in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1806. Also in Scotland, the foundation stone for Nelson&#x27;s Tower at Forres in Moray was laid in 1806 and it was completed in 1812; while the Nelson Monument stands on top of Calton Hill, Edinburgh. In Dublin, Ireland, Nelson&#x27;s Pillar was erected in 1808 but was destroyed by republicans in 1966, and in the Bull Ring, Birmingham, England, there is a Grade II* listed bronze statue of Nelson by Richard Westmacott, dating from 1809. Westmacott also designed the elaborate monument to Nelson in Liverpool. In Portsmouth, Nelson&#x27;s Needle, on top of Portsdown Hill, was paid for by the company of after arriving back in Portsmouth. There is a column topped with a decorative urn in the Castle Green, Hereford – a statue was planned in place of the urn, but insufficient money was raised. The Britannia Monument in Great Yarmouth, England (1819), is a 144-foot-high doric column design.

Elsewhere in the world, Nelson&#x27;s Column in Montreal was erected by both Britons and Canadians in 1809, and there is also a Mount Nelson, near Invermere, British Columbia. As at London, the column in Montreal has the admiral standing with his back to the waves. A much shorter statue of Lord Nelson in Trafalgar Square, Bridgetown, Barbados, is older than its counterpart in London.

<text>The London Underground is a metro system in the United Kingdom that serves Greater London and the home counties of Buckinghamshire, Essex and Hertfordshire. Its first section opened in 1863, making it the oldest underground metro system in the world – although approximately 55% of the current network is above ground, as it generally runs on the surface in outlying suburbs. 

The system is composed of 11 lines – Bakerloo, Central, Circle, District, Hammersmith &amp; City, Jubilee, Metropolitan, Northern, Piccadilly, Victoria, and Waterloo &amp; City – serving 272 stations. It is operated by Transport for London (TfL).

Most of the system is north of the River Thames, with six of the London boroughs in the south of the city not served by the Underground. The London Borough of Hackney, to the north, has two stations on its border. Some stations at the north-eastern end of the Central line are in the Epping Forest district of Essex and some stations at the north-western end of the Metropolitan line are in the Three Rivers and Watford districts of Hertfordshire, and Buckinghamshire.

There are two instances where two separate stations share the same name: there is one Edgware Road station on the Circle, District, and Hammersmith &amp; City lines and another on the Bakerloo line; and there is one Hammersmith station on the District and Piccadilly lines and another on the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines. Although the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines station at Paddington is on the other side of the main line station to the Bakerloo, Circle and District lines station, it is shown as a single station on the current Tube map, but still counted as two in the official station count. It has been shown as two separate stations at different times in the past.

The opening of the Northern line extension to Battersea in September 2021 added two new stations to the network (Battersea Power Station and Nine Elms), bringing the total to 272.

==Stations==

Listed for each of the 272 stations are the lines serving it, local authority, the fare zone in which it is located, the date it and any earlier main line service opened, previous names and passenger usage statistics in millions per year.

<text>Sir Henry George Norris (23 July 1865 – 30 July 1934) was an English businessman, politician and football club director, most famous for his chairmanship of both Fulham and Arsenal.

==Business and political career==

Born in Kennington, to a working-class family but educated privately, Norris left school at 14 to join a solicitor&#x27;s firm, leaving 18 years later to pursue a career in property development trade, partnering W.G. Allen in the firm Allen &amp; Norris. He made his fortune building houses in south and west London — Fulham in particular. He was commissioned into the 2nd Tower Hamlets Rifle Volunteers in 1896, but resigned the following year. He was later Mayor of the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham from 1909 to 1919, a member of the London County Council from 1916 to 1919, and served as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Fulham East from 1918 to 1922, retiring after falling out with his party on the issue of tariff reform.

During World War I Norris had worked heavily as a military recruitment officer for the British Army. He served in the 3rd Middlesex Artillery Volunteers and in the 1917 Birthday Honours he was knighted and given the honorary rank of colonel for services to his country. He was also a prominent Freemason, rising to become Grand Deacon of the United Grand Lodge of England, and a well-known local philanthropist with close connections to the Church of England; he counted the Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Thomas Davidson as a personal friend.

==Chairmanship of Fulham FC==

A keen football fan, Norris first became a director of Fulham, during which time the Cottagers were elected to the Football League. While chairman of Fulham, between 1903 and 1908, Norris had an indirect role in the foundation of nearby Chelsea Football Club. He was offered the chance to move Fulham to Stamford Bridge, which businessman Gus Mears had recently acquired, but Norris baulked at the £1500 per annum rent, so Mears subsequently created his own team to occupy the ground.

==Chairmanship of Arsenal FC==

In 1910, Norris and William Hall each bought 240 shares (18.75%) of the ailing Woolwich Arsenal (after the club had gone into voluntary liquidation) while still retaining their positions on the Fulham board; Norris became club chairman two years later. With Arsenal&#x27;s low attendances and poor financial performance, Norris tried to create a London superclub by merging the two clubs, but this was blocked by the Football League. Undeterred, he turned his attention to moving Arsenal to a new stadium; he eventually settled on a site in Highbury, north London, on the site of the recreation ground of St John&#x27;s College of Divinity; his close relationship with Randall Davidson helped, and the archbishop personally signed the ground&#x27;s title deed. The Arsenal Stadium opened in 1913, and the club dropped the Woolwich from its name the following year.

Norris&#x27;s most infamous contribution to Arsenal&#x27;s history was his role in the club&#x27;s promotion from the Second Division to the First in 1919. Arsenal were elected to the top flight in spite of only finishing sixth the previous season (1914–15, as competition had been suspended for most of World War I). This promotion came at the expense of other clubs, most notably Arsenal&#x27;s arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur. It has been alleged that Norris bribed or in some way unduly influenced the voting members of the Football League, in particular the league chairman and owner of Liverpool, John McKenna; at the League&#x27;s AGM. Many sources claim that McKenna made a speech recommending Arsenal&#x27;s promotion ahead of Spurs thanks to the former&#x27;s longer spell in the League (Arsenal joined in 1893, Spurs in 1908), although Wolves – who finished in 4th ahead of Arsenal – had been members of the league since its inception in 1888. However, with no newspapers at time reporting on it, it is highly unlikely that any of this actually happened.

Norris made one other lasting contribution to Arsenal&#x27;s history. In 1925, after acrimoniously firing manager Leslie Knighton, Norris hired Huddersfield Town&#x27;s Herbert Chapman as his replacement. After Norris&#x27;s departure, Chapman fulfilled the chairman&#x27;s ambition and turned Arsenal into the dominant side in English football in the 1930s, although later Norris cited Knighton&#x27;s sacking as the only decision he ever regretted.

However, Norris was not in charge by the time Arsenal had come to dominate English football. In 1927, former Arsenal director William Hall requested that the Football Association look into Arsenal&#x27;s financial affairs. An investigation by the Football Association found that Norris had made illegal payments to three players (Clem Voysey, Bert White and Jock Rutherford), had used Arsenal&#x27;s expense accounts for personal use to pay for his chauffeur, and had pocketed the proceeds of £125 from the sale of the reserve team bus. The results of the investigation saw Norris, Hall and two other Arsenal directors - Jack Humble and George Peachey - banned from football for life. Norris sued the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and the FA for libel, but in February 1929, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Hewart, found in favour of the FA.

==Retirement==

He largely left public life after his enforced departure from football. He died in 1934 at his home in Barnes a week after his 69th birthday, of a heart attack.

<text>The Canadian Trusted Computer Product Evaluation Criteria (CTCPEC) is a computer security standard published in 1993 by the Communications Security Establishment to provide an evaluation criterion on IT products. It is a combination of the TCSEC (also called &quot;Orange Book&quot;) and the European ITSEC approaches.

CTCPEC led to the creation of the Common Criteria standard.

The Canadian System Security Centre, part of the Communications Security Establishment was founded in 1988 to establish a Canadian computer security standard.
 The Centre published a draft of the standard in April 1992. The final version was published in January 1993.

<text>A monitor is a relatively small warship that is neither fast nor strongly armored but carries disproportionately large guns. They were used by some navies from the 1860s, during the First World War and with limited use in the Second World War.

The original monitor was designed in 1861 by John Ericsson, who named it . Subsequent vessels of this type were accordingly classed as &quot;monitors&quot;. They were designed for shallow waters and served as coastal ships. The term also encompassed more flexible breastwork monitors, and was sometimes used as a generic term for any turreted ship.

In the early 20th century, the term was revived for shallow-draught armoured shore bombardment vessels, particularly those of the Royal Navy: the s carried guns firing heavier shells than any other warship ever has, seeing action (albeit briefly) against German targets during World War I. The &quot;Lord Clive&quot; vessels were scrapped in the 1920s.

The term &quot;monitor&quot; also encompasses the strongest of riverine warcraft, known as river monitors. During the Vietnam War these much smaller craft were used by the United States Navy. The Brazilian Navy&#x27;s &quot;Parnaíba&quot; and the Romanian Navy&#x27;s three &quot;Mihail Kogălniceanu&quot;-class river monitors are among the last monitors in service.

==Nineteenth century==
===American Civil War===
In Latin, a monitor is someone who admonishes: that is, reminds others of their duties—which is how USS &quot;Monitor&quot; was given its name. It was designed by John Ericsson for emergency service in the Federal navy during the American Civil War (1861–65) to blockade the Confederate States from supply at sea. Ericsson designed her to operate in shallow water and to present as small a target as possible, the water around her acting as protection.

Nathaniel Hawthorne described &quot;Monitor&quot; thus:

The Battle of Hampton Roads (March 1862), between &quot;Monitor&quot; and , was the first engagement between ironclad vessels. Several such battles took place during the course of the American Civil War, and the dozens of monitors built for the United States Navy reflected a ship-to-ship combat role in their designs. However, fortification bombardment was another critical role that the early monitors played, though one that these early designs were much less capable in performing.

Three months after the Battle of Hampton Roads, John Ericsson took his design to his native Sweden, and in 1865 the first Swedish monitor was built at Motala Warf in Norrköping, taking the engineer&#x27;s name. She was followed by 14 more monitors. One of them, &quot;Kanonbåten Sölve&quot;, served until 1922 and is today preserved at the Maritiman marine museum in Gothenburg.

Ericsson and others experimented greatly during the years of the American Civil War. Vessels constructed included a triple-turreted monitor, a class of paddlewheel-propelled ironclads, a class of semi-submersible monitors, and a class of monitors armed with spar torpedoes.

===1866 to 1878===
In the 1860s and 1870s several nations built monitors that were used for coastal defense and took the name &quot;monitor&quot; as a type of ship. Those that were directly modelled on &quot;Monitor&quot; were low-freeboard, mastless, steam-powered vessels with one or two rotating, armoured turrets. The low freeboard meant that these ships were unsuitable for ocean-going duties and were always at risk of swamping, flooding and possible loss. However, it greatly reduced the cost and weight of the armour required for protection, and in heavy weather the sea could wash over the deck rather than heeling the ship over.

Attempts were made to fit monitors with sails, but the provision of masts interfered with the turrets&#x27; ability to operate in a 360-degree arc of fire and the weight of masts and sails aloft made the ships less stable. One ship, , which combined turret and sails with a low freeboard, was lost in heavy weather.

====War of the Pacific====

A late example of a vessel modeled on &quot;Monitor&quot; was , designed by Captain Cowper P. Coles, the advocate and developer of turret ships for the Royal Navy. &quot;Huáscar&quot; was one of many monitor designs to be equipped with a ram. She was built and launched in 1865 for the Peruvian Navy at Birkenhead, England.

&quot;Huáscar&quot;, under the command of Rear Admiral Miguel Grau, fought with distinction during the War of the Pacific. &quot;Huáscar&quot; successfully raided enemy sea lanes for several months and delayed an invasion of the Chilean Army into Peruvian territory until she was captured by the Chilean Navy at the Battle of Angamos in 1879. Once in Chilean hands, &quot;Huáscar&quot; fought a small battle with the Peruvian monitor &quot;Manco Capac&quot;, during the bombardment of Arica, where she was damaged; after the land battle was lost, the crew of the Manco Capac scuttled her to prevent capture.

Over the years, both Chile and Peru came to venerate the ship and the officers from both sides that died on her deck, either commanding her or boarding her, as national heroes. &quot;Huáscar&quot; is currently commissioned in the Chilean Navy, has been restored to a near-original condition and, as a museum ship, is open to visitors at its berth in Talcahuano.

===1884–1897===
In an effort to produce a more seaworthy vessel that was more capable in ship-to-shore combat, a type called the breastwork monitor became more common in the later nineteenth century. These ships had raised turrets and a heavier superstructure on a platform above the hull. They were still not particularly successful as seagoing ships, because of their short sailing range and the poor reliability of their steam engines. The first of these ships was , built between 1868 and 1870. She was later sunk and used as a breakwater near Melbourne, Australia and is still visible there, as her upper works project from the water.

===Spanish–American War===

Monitors were used frequently during the Spanish–American War in 1898. Notable United States Navy monitors which fought in the war were , , , and . These four monitors fought at battles or campaigns such as the Bombardment of San Juan, the Battle of Fajardo, and the Philippines Campaign. Other monitors also participated in the conflict, including original Civil War ships. These were reactivated for coastal defence to allay fears about surprise Spanish raids, but this was pure political posturing as the ships were too slow and obsolete to have any military value.

==Twentieth century==

===World War I===

During World War I, the Royal Navy developed several classes of ships which were designed to give close support to troops ashore. Termed &quot;monitors&quot;, they owed little to the monitors of the 19th century, though they shared the characteristics of poor seaworthiness, shallow draft and heavy armament in turrets.

The first class, the , had been laid down as large river gunboats for the Brazilian navy. Later monitor classes were equally makeshift; they were often designed for carrying whatever spare guns were available from ships scrapped or never built, with the hulls quickly designed and built in &quot;cheap and cheerful&quot; fashion. They were broad beamed for stability (beam was about 1/3 of the overall length) which together with a lack of emphasis on speed made them extremely slow, and they were not suitable for naval combat or any sort of work on the high seas. Monitors of the Royal Navy played a part in consolidating the left wing of the Western Front during the Race to the Sea in 1914.

In addition to these ships, several monitors were built during the course of the war. Their armament typically consisted of a turret taken from a de-commissioned pre-dreadnought battleship. These monitors were designed to be resilient against torpedo attacks—waterline bulges were incorporated into the of 1915. As the war settled to its longer course, these heavier monitors formed patrols along with destroyers on either side of the Straits of Dover to exclude enemy surface vessels from the English Channel and keep the enemy in port. The monitors could also operate into the river mouths. , one of the &quot;Lord Clive&quot;-class monitors, which had a single gun added in 1918, was able to shell a bridge away near Ostend. Other RN monitors served in the Mediterranean.

The dimensions of the several classes of monitor varied greatly. Those of the &quot;Abercrombie&quot; class were by in the beam and drew compared to the s of 1915 that were only long, and the of 1916, which were long. The largest monitors carried the heaviest guns.
By this point the United States Navy had largely stopped using monitors. Only a few still existed, and only seven were still in service, all of which had been relegated to being submarine tenders. This would be the last war in which United States monitor-type vessels would see commissioned service. The last original American monitor, , renamed USS &quot;Cheyenne&quot; in 1908, was removed from the Navy List in 1937.

The Austro-Hungarian Navy had also invested heavily in the construction of river monitors to patrol its internal river systems such as the Danube and its tributaries. These vessels were among the first to fire on Serbian territory at the start of the First World War, and took part in the bombardment of Belgrade, as well as other Balkan campaigns against Serbia and Romania. At the end of the war, the surviving vessels were parceled out to the navies of the new state of Yugoslavia and Romania as war prizes. Several would see action in World War II as well.

The Italian Navy also constructed some monitors including the &quot;Faa di Bruno&quot;, using the main gun barrels for the cancelled Francesco Caracciolo-class battleships.

===World War II===
The smaller Royal Navy monitors were mostly scrapped following World War I, though and survived to fight in World War II. When the requirement for shore support returned, two large new s, &quot;Roberts&quot; and &quot;Abercrombie&quot;, were constructed and fitted with guns from older battleships.
Royal Navy monitors saw service in the Mediterranean in support of the British Eighth Army&#x27;s desert and Italian campaigns. They were part of the offshore bombardment for the Invasion of Normandy in 1944. They were also used to clear the German-mined River Scheldt by the British to utilize the port of Antwerp. &quot;Roberts&quot; and &quot;Abercrombie&quot; were to form part of the British East Indies Fleet in support of Operation Mailfist, the planned liberation of Singapore in late 1945, which was cancelled following the Japanese surrender.

The former Italian WWI monitor &quot;Faa di Bruno&quot; had been redesignated as floating battery by the beginning of WW2, in which role she continued to play until the capitulation of Italy. She was then captured by the Germans and served as monitor &quot;Biber&quot; in Genoa, until the German surrender. She was scrapped after the war.

The German, Yugoslav, Croatian and Romanian navies all operated river monitors on the Danube, all of which saw combat during the war.

===Soviet river monitors===

The Soviet Union built many monitors before World War II, and used them mostly on rivers and lakes. After experiences during WWI, the Russian Civil War and the Manchukuo Imperial Navy raids in the Far East, the Soviets developed a new monitor class for their river flotillas. The lead ship of the new series was &quot;Zheleznyakov&quot;, laid down in the Leninska Kuznia factory in Kiev in late 1934. &quot;Zheleznyakov&quot; is preserved as a museum and monument on the Dnieper.

===1946–1964===

The Royal Navy still had (completed 1943) and (1941) in reserve in 1953. They were typical monitors, trunk-decked vessels, long overall, in the beam and with an mean draught carrying two guns.

The Brazilian Navy presently operates the last true &quot;monitor&quot; as part of their inland waterway force, .

===Vietnam War===
The Vietnam War was the U.S. Navy&#x27;s second riverine war, after the American Civil War. On 18 December 1965, the U.S. Navy, for the second time in a hundred years, authorized the reactivation of a brown-water navy, this time in South Vietnam. After studies were conducted, plans were drawn up by the U.S. Naval Advisory Group in February 1966, and by the summer of 1966 Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara authorized the U.S. Navy a Mobile Riverine Force (MRF).

Although U.S. Navy Patrol Craft Fast (Swift Boats), Patrol Boat River (PBRs) and assorted gunboats had been performing counter-insurgency operations in country prior to 1966, the allies were not gaining success in the Mekong Delta region. A stronger naval force was needed, one that was heavily armored, and heavily gunned.

The U.S. Navy&#x27;s MRF initially consisted of &quot;River Assault Flotilla One&quot;, under Program 4 in 1967, and consisted of four &quot;River Assault Divisions&quot;: RAD-91 which contained 3 Monitors; RAD-92 contained 2 Monitors; RAD-111 had 3 Monitors; and RAD-112 operated 2 Monitors. These &quot;river battleships&quot;, as they were known by the men, operated in conjunction with the CCB (Command Control Boat—also a monitor), ATCs Armored Troop Carrier (ATC) and the Assault Support Patrol Boats (ASPBs) which were also assigned to each RAD.

Vietnam Monitors were originally converted from World War II long all-steel Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM) Mark 6s. They were constructed under two phases: Programs 4 and 5. Under Program 4, 10 Monitors were armed with one 40 mm cannon and then fielded. Program 5 Monitors would correct any deficiencies from the previous vessels, and were fielded as the &quot;Monitor (H) 105 mm&quot; (Howitzer) and the &quot;Monitor (F)&quot; (Flamethrower). The Program 4 monitors mounted their single barrel 40 mm cannon in a Mk 52 turret; while the Program 5 monitors mounted their 105 mm cannon in a T172 turret, and the six flamethrowers were mounted in M8 cupola turrets (one on each side of the vessel&#x27;s 40 mm turret). Because the U.S. Marine Corps was also using the M49 105 mm howitzer, there was a shortage, and only 8 &quot;Monitor (H)&quot; versions could be procured for the brown-water navy.

As fielded, the 24 monitors of the U.S. Navy in Vietnam averaged about 10 tons of armor, were about long, had two screws, were powered by two 64NH9 diesel engines, (maximum speed), wide, draft, and were normally manned by 11 crewmen. When South Vietnam fell on 30 April 1975, all monitors fell into the enemy&#x27;s hands; leaving only one survivor, a training monitor, that never left the US. &quot;Training&quot; monitor #C-18 is on display, along with one Swift Boat and one PBR at the U.S. Naval Amphibious Base in Coronado, California.

===River monitors===

The monitor, by proving the efficacy of turrets over fixed guns, played a part in development of the dreadnought battleship from the ironclad. As a shallow draft vessel it also led to the river gunboats which were used by imperial powers to police their colonial possessions; indeed the largest and most heavily armed river gunboats became known as river monitors. They were used by several navies, including those of the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan.

===Submarine gunboats===
USS &quot;Monitor&quot; had had very little freeboard so as to bring the mass of the gun turret down, thereby increasing stability and making the boat a smaller and therefore harder target for gunfire. At the end of the American Civil War, the U.S. Navy -class monitors had large ballast tanks that allowed the vessels to partially submerge during battle. This idea was carried further with the concept of the Royal Navy&#x27;s R class of submarine gunboats.

The British M-class submarines were initially designed for shore bombardment, but their purpose was changed to attacking enemy merchant vessels as their gun would be more effective at long range than a torpedo against a moving target. Only one, , entered service before the end of World War 1; she was lost in the English Channel after the war in 1925 after being accidentally rammed while submerged: her gun came free of its mount and she was completely flooded.
==Derivative uses of the name==
To overcome the stability problems arising from the heavy turret mounted high in monitors, their hulls were designed to reduce other top weight. After Ericsson&#x27;s ships, monitors developed the trunk deck design as the upper deck had to be heavily armoured against plunging shells. Because of the weight high in the hull, its breadth was minimized, giving rise to a vessel broad-beamed at the waterline, but with a narrow upper deck. The term for this sort of construction was tumblehome. Ships which were far narrower at the deck than the waterline were said to have a &quot;pronounced tumblehome&quot;.

By analogy, nineteenth century railway coaches with clerestory roofs to accommodate ventilators and lamps above the heads of standing passengers in the centre while lower to the sides where passengers were seated were called monitors or monitor cars in the U.S.; the raised part of the roof was known as a turret. In ship design of around 1900, a turret deck was a more austere version of the trunk deck.

<doc id="210647" wikidata="Q333281" url="?curid=210647" title="John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer">
<text>John Poyntz Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer (27 October 1835 – 13 August 1910), known as Viscount Althorp from 1845 to 1857 (and also known as the &quot;Red Earl&quot; because of his distinctive long red beard), was a British Liberal Party politician under, and close friend of, prime minister William Ewart Gladstone. He was twice Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

==Background and education==
Spencer was the son of Frederick Spencer, 4th Earl Spencer, by his first wife Georgiana, daughter of William Poyntz. The prominent Whig politician John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer, was his uncle and Charles Spencer, 6th Earl Spencer, his half-brother. He was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge, from which he graduated in 1857.

==Political career, 1857–1885==
Almost immediately after leaving Cambridge Spencer was elected to parliament for South Northamptonshire as a Liberal, before departing for a tour of North America. He returned in December 1857, and within a few days his father died, leaving him as the new Earl Spencer. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1859 and made a Knight of the Garter in 1864. Spencer split from other whiggish aristocratic Liberals in 1866 on the issue of Russell&#x27;s reform bill, which he supported, and his loyalty was rewarded by his appointment as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland when Gladstone returned to power in 1868. Ireland came to be a major preoccupation of the remainder of Spencer&#x27;s long political career. In this first tenure as Lord Lieutenant, he had to deal with implementation of the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1869 and of the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870, both of which measures he strongly supported. Spencer, in fact, went further than most of his ministerial colleagues, including Gladstone himself, in arguing for the setting up of government tribunals to enforce fair rents on Irish landlords (a reform which would eventually be introduced by the Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881).

Spencer, along with the successive Chief Secretaries for Ireland, Chichester Fortescue and Spencer&#x27;s own cousin, Lord Hartington, supported coercive legislation to deal with the increase in agrarian crime, but at the same time supported a policy of releasing Fenian prisoners when possible. Spencer also had to deal during his tenure with Gladstone&#x27;s Irish Universities Bill. In spite of Spencer&#x27;s efforts to secure the support of the Catholic hierarchy for the bill, they opposed it, and it went down to defeat in the commons in March 1873. The government lingered on for a further year, until the election defeat of February 1874, when Spencer found himself out of office. When Gladstone returned to power for his second government in 1880, Spencer joined the Cabinet as Lord President of the Council, having responsibility for education policy, and was partially responsible for several major educational reforms of the period. The increasingly tense situation in Ireland, however, commanded an increasing portion of Spencer&#x27;s time. In May 1882, Gladstone&#x27;s decision to release the Irish Nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell from prison led to the resignation of the hardline Chief Secretary for Ireland, W. E. Forster. As a result, Spencer, while retaining his seat in the cabinet and position as Lord President, was again appointed Lord Lieutenant to take charge of the government&#x27;s Irish policy.

=== Ireland ===
Spencer and his new chief secretary, Gladstone&#x27;s nephew and Hartington&#x27;s brother Lord Frederick Cavendish, crossed to Ireland on 5 May, but Cavendish and the permanent under-secretary, Thomas Henry Burke, were murdered by extremist Irish nationalists the next day in Phoenix Park, Dublin, while walking to the Viceregal Lodge where Spencer was staying. Spencer, assisted by George Trevelyan, his new secretary, was now faced with the difficult task of pacifying Ireland. Spencer acted quickly to reform the Irish police forces and destroy the secret societies which had been responsible for the murders.

He attracted heavy criticism for his poor handling of a group of murders in Maamtrasna – one of the supposed criminals, Myles Joyce, had been hanged while still proclaiming his innocence, leading to a great deal of condemnation of Spencer from Irish Nationalist sources. The end of Spencer&#x27;s second tenure as viceroy saw the successful visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to Ireland, but Spencer&#x27;s efforts to get the Queen to agree to the creation of a royal residence in Ireland were unsuccessful.

==Political career, 1885–1905==
By 1885, Gladstone&#x27;s second government was in a very weak position, largely as a result of the death of Charles Gordon, and Spencer&#x27;s efforts to renew the Irish Crimes Act and secure passage of a land purchase bill ran into opposition from the radicals in the Cabinet - Joseph Chamberlain and Sir Charles Dilke - who hoped to use the opportunity of the legislation to pass a greater measure of local self-government for Ireland. The issue remained up in the air when Gladstone&#x27;s government fell in early June. During the interval between the fall of Gladstone&#x27;s second government and the beginning of his third, in February 1886, Spencer became a convert to Irish Home Rule, unlike most of the other leading Whigs, who deserted to Liberal Unionism. Spencer would serve as Lord President in Gladstone&#x27;s third government, and was instrumental in the formulation of Gladstone&#x27;s home rule legislation. After the defeat of the bill, Spencer joined his chief in opposition. Spencer&#x27;s position on home rule led to his social ostracism by other members of his class, including the Queen herself, and spent much of his period in opposition getting his personal finances in order. He also acted from 1888 as chairman of the Northamptonshire County Council, and continued to work with Gladstone and other liberal leaders in determining the shape of a home rule bill in the next liberal government.
When the Liberals returned to power in August 1892, Spencer was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. Gladstone&#x27;s opposition to Spencer&#x27;s policy, following the recommendations of the Sea Lords, of naval expansion, led to Gladstone&#x27;s final resignation in March 1894. Gladstone himself nonetheless hoped that Spencer would be his successor, but the Queen did not seek his advice, and chose Lord Rosebery instead. Spencer continued to serve under Rosebery, and went out when the Liberal government fell in June 1895. In his later years, Spencer remained active in politics. Spencer was a key support for the Liberal leader in the Commons, Henry Campbell-Bannerman (who had previously been Spencer&#x27;s Chief Secretary at the end of his second vice-regency) during the Boer War, holding to the Liberal leader&#x27;s middle course between the active anti-war position of the Radicals and the pro-war position of Rosebery&#x27;s Liberal Imperialists. Following Lord Kimberley&#x27;s death in 1902, Spencer was elected Liberal leader in the House of Lords. Despite health problems, he was rumoured as late as February 1905 to be a potential candidate for Liberal prime minister should the Liberals soon return to power, as by then seemed likely as a result of the Unionist split over tariff reform. However, on 11 October of that year he suffered a major stroke which ended his political career, only two months shy of the Liberals&#x27; return to power.
==Rifle Volunteers==
An invasion scare in 1859 led to a War Office decision to call for local Volunteer Corps to be established. The War Office issued a Circular Letter on 12 May inviting volunteers, and within three days Spencer had offered to raise a company from his tenants at Althorp. It became the 1st (Althorp Rifles) Northamptonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps with Spencer appointed to command in the rank of captain on 29 August 1859.

The 1st Northampton RVC sang a song to the tune of The British Grenadiers:
::&quot;Now every man of sense, Sir,Should welcome with three cheersAnd rally round Lord Spencerand the Althorp Volunteers.&quot;

After the separate Northamptonshire RVCs were formed into an administrative battalion the following year, Spencer was promoted to major on 2 April 1861. When the battalion held its annual camp at Althorp in 1864, Spencer&#x27;s hospitality included providing his own cook to direct the officers&#x27; mess.

Also in 1859, Spencer was a leading member of the committee that established the National Rifle Association, and hosted the committee&#x27;s meetings at Spencer House. The Association&#x27;s first competitive meetings were held at Wimbledon Common, part of Spencer&#x27;s manor of Wimbledon. In 1867 he served on a War Office committee to investigate breech-loading rifles.

Lord Spencer was appointed to the honorary colonelcy of the Northamptonshire Imperial Yeomanry (later the Northamptonshire Yeomanry) on 21 May 1902.

==Other public appointments==

In 1865 Spencer chaired a royal commission on cattle plague, alongside Lord Cranborne, Robert Lowe and Lyon Playfair.

Lord Spencer was Chancellor of Manchester&#x27;s Victoria University.

During a visit to Exeter on 12 July 1902, he was presented with the Freedom of the Borough of Exeter.

==Courtier==
Spencer served, for most of the period from 1859 to 1866, in the royal household, as a groom first to Prince Albert and then to the Prince of Wales. In 1876 he hosted Empress Elisabeth of Austria who had come to Northamptonshire for a hunting party. The empress stayed at Easton Neston, which she rented through her sister, ex-queen Maria of the Two Sicilies.

==Personal life==

Lord Spencer married Charlotte Seymour, daughter of Frederick Charles William Seymour and granddaughter of Lord Hugh Seymour, on 8 July 1858. The marriage was recorded as childless. Lady Spencer died in October 1903, aged 68. Spencer died at Althorp in August 1910, aged 74, and was succeeded by his half-brother, Charles.

In 1864, Spencer, as lord of the manor of Wimbledon through his ownership of Wimbledon House, attempted to get a private parliamentary bill to enclose Wimbledon Common for the creation of a new park with a house and gardens and to sell part for building. In a landmark decision for English common land, and following an enquiry, permission was refused and a board of conservators was established in 1871 to take ownership of the common and preserve it in its natural condition.

<doc id="210648" wikidata="Q531152" url="?curid=210648" title="Declarative programming">
<text>In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. 

Many languages that apply this style attempt to minimize or eliminate side effects by describing &quot;what&quot; the program must accomplish in terms of the problem domain, rather than describing &quot;how&quot; to accomplish it as a sequence of the programming language primitives (the &quot;how&quot; being left up to the language&#x27;s implementation). This is in contrast with imperative programming, which implements algorithms in explicit steps.

Declarative programming often considers programs as theories of a formal logic, and computations as deductions in that logic space. Declarative programming may greatly simplify writing parallel programs.

Common declarative languages include those of database query languages (e.g., SQL, XQuery), regular expressions, logic programming (e.g. Prolog, Datalog, answer set programming), functional programming, configuration management, and algebraic modeling systems.

==Definition==
Declarative programming is often defined as any style of programming that is not imperative. A number of other common definitions attempt to define it by simply contrasting it with imperative programming. For example:

* A high-level program that describes what a computation should perform.
* Any programming language that lacks side effects (or more specifically, is referentially transparent).
* A language with a clear correspondence to mathematical logic.

These definitions overlap substantially.

Declarative programming is a non-imperative style of programming in which programs describe their desired results without explicitly listing commands or steps that must be performed. Functional and logic programming languages are characterized by a declarative programming style. In logic programming, programs consist of sentences expressed in logical form, and computation uses those sentences to solve problems, which are also expressed in logical form.

In a pure functional language, such as Haskell, all functions are without side effects, and state changes are only represented as functions that transform the state, which is explicitly represented as a first-class object in the program. Although pure functional languages are non-imperative, they often provide a facility for describing the effect of a function as a series of steps. Other functional languages, such as Lisp, OCaml and Erlang, support a mixture of procedural and functional programming.

Some logic programming languages, such as Prolog, and database query languages, such as SQL, while declarative in principle, also support a procedural style of programming.

==Subparadigms==
Declarative programming is an umbrella term that includes a number of better-known programming paradigms.

===Constraint programming===

Constraint programming states relations between variables in the form of constraints that specify the properties of the target solution. The set of constraints is solved by giving a value to each variable so that the solution is consistent with the maximum number of constraints. Constraint programming often complements other paradigms: functional, logical, or even imperative programming.

===Domain-specific languages===

Well-known examples of declarative domain-specific languages (DSLs) include the yacc parser generator input language, QML, the Make build specification language, Puppet&#x27;s configuration management language, regular expressions, Datalog, answer set programming and a subset of SQL (SELECT queries, for example). DSLs have the advantage of being useful while not necessarily needing to be Turing-complete, which makes it easier for a language to be purely declarative.

Many markup languages such as HTML, MXML, XAML, XSLT or other user-interface markup languages are often declarative. HTML, for example, only describes what should appear on a webpage - it specifies neither control flow for rendering a page nor the page&#x27;s possible interactions with a user.

, some software systems combine traditional user-interface markup languages (such as HTML) with declarative markup that defines what (but not how) the back-end server systems should do to support the declared interface. Such systems, typically using a domain-specific XML namespace, may include abstractions of SQL database syntax or parameterized calls to web services using representational state transfer (REST) and SOAP.

===Functional programming===

Functional programming languages such as Haskell, Scheme, and ML evaluate expressions via function application. Unlike the related but more imperative paradigm of procedural programming, functional programming places little emphasis on explicit sequencing. Instead, computations are characterised by various kinds of recursive higher-order function application and composition, and as such can be regarded simply as a set of mappings between domains and codomains. Many functional languages, including most of those in the ML and Lisp families, are not purely functional, and thus allow the introduction of stateful effects in programs.

===Hybrid languages===

Makefiles, for example, specify dependencies in a declarative fashion, but include an imperative list of actions to take as well. Similarly, yacc specifies a context free grammar declaratively, but includes code snippets from a host language, which is usually imperative (such as C).

===Logic programming===

Logic programming languages, such as Prolog, Datalog and answer set programming, compute by proving that a goal is a logical consequence of the program, or by showing that the goal is true in a model defined by the program. Prolog computes by reducing goals to subgoals, top-down using backward reasoning, whereas most Datalog systems compute bottom-up using forward reasoning. Answer set programs typically use SAT solvers to generate a model of the program.

===Modeling===

Models, or mathematical representations, of physical systems may be implemented in computer code that is declarative. The code contains a number of equations, not imperative assignments, that describe (&quot;declare&quot;) the behavioral relationships. When a model is expressed in this formalism, a computer is able to perform algebraic manipulations to best formulate the solution algorithm. The mathematical causality is typically imposed at the boundaries of the physical system, while the behavioral description of the system itself is declarative or acausal. Declarative modeling languages and environments include Analytica, Modelica and Simile.

==Examples==

===Lisp===
Lisp is a family of programming languages loosely inspired by mathematical notation and Alonzo Church&#x27;s lambda calculus. Some dialects, such as Common Lisp, are primarily imperative but support functional programming. Others, such as Scheme, are designed for functional programming.

In Scheme, the factorial function can be defined as follows:
(define (factorial n)
 (if (= n 0) 
 1 ;;; 0! = 1
 (* n (factorial (- n 1))))) ;;; n! = n*(n-1)!
This defines the factorial function using its recursive definition. In contrast, it is more typical to define a procedure for an imperative language.

In lisps and lambda calculus, functions are generally first-class citizens. Loosely, this means that functions can be inputs and outputs for other functions. This can simplify the definition of some functions.

For example, writing a function to output the first n square numbers in Racket can be done accordingly:
(define (first-n-squares n)
 (map (lambda (x) (* x x)) ;;; A function mapping x -&gt; x^2
 (iota n))) ;;; Lists the first n naturals
The map function accepts a function and a list; the output is a list of results of the input function on each element of the input list.

===ML===
ML (1973) stands for &quot;Meta Language.&quot; ML is statically typed, and function arguments and return types may be annotated. 

&quot;ML&quot; is not as bracket-centric as &quot;Lisp&quot;, and instead uses a wider variety of syntax to codify the relationship between code elements, rather than appealing to list ordering and nesting to express everything. The following is an application of codice_1:

 times_10 2

It returns &quot;20 : int&quot;, that is, codice_2, a value of type codice_3. 

Like &quot;Lisp&quot;, &quot;ML&quot; is tailored to process lists, though all elements of a list must be the same type.
===Prolog===
Prolog (1972) stands for &quot;PROgramming in LOGic.&quot; It was developed for natural language question answering, using SL resolution both to deduce answers to queries and to parse and generate natural language sentences.

The building blocks of a Prolog program are &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;rules&quot;. Here is a simple example:

cat(tom). % tom is a cat
mouse(jerry). % jerry is a mouse

animal(X) :- cat(X). % each cat is an animal
animal(X) :- mouse(X). % each mouse is an animal

big(X) :- cat(X). % each cat is big
small(X) :- mouse(X). % each mouse is small

eat(X,Y) :- mouse(X), cheese(Y). % each mouse eats each cheese
eat(X,Y) :- big(X), small(Y). % each big being eats each small being
Given this program, the query eat(tom,jerry) succeeds, while eat(jerry,tom) fails. Moreover, the query eat(X,jerry) succeeds with the answer substitution X=tom.

Prolog executes programs top-down, using SLD resolution to reason backwards, reducing goals to subgoals. In this example, it uses the last rule of the program to reduce the goal of answering the query eat(X,jerry) to the subgoals of first finding an X such that big(X) holds and then of showing that small(jerry) holds. It repeatedly uses rules to further reduce subgoals to other subgoals, until it eventually succeeds in unifying all subgoals with facts in the program. This backward reasoning, goal-reduction strategy treats rules in logic programs as procedures, and makes Prolog both a declarative and procedural programming language.

The broad range of Prolog applications is highlighted in the Year of Prolog Book, celebrating the 50 year anniversary of Prolog.

===Datalog===
The origins of Datalog date back to the beginning of logic programming, but it was identified as a separate area around 1977. Syntactically and semantically, it is a subset of Prolog. But because it does not have compound terms, it is not Turing-complete.

Most Datalog systems execute programs bottom-up, using rules to reason forwards, deriving new facts from existing facts, and terminating when there are no new facts that can be derived, or when the derived facts unify with the query. In the above example, a typical Datalog system would first derive the new facts:

animal(tom).
animal(jerry).
big(tom).
small(jerry).
Using these facts, it would then derive the additional fact:

eats(tom, jerry).
It would then terminate, both because no new, additional facts can be derived, and because the newly derived fact unifies with the query 
eats(X, jerry).

Datalog has been applied to such problems as data integration, information extraction, networking, security, cloud computing and machine learning.

=== Answer Set Programming===
Answer set programming (ASP) evolved in the late 1990s, based on the stable model (answer set) semantics of logic programming. Like Datalog, it is a subset of Prolog; and, because it does not have compound terms, it is not Turing-complete.

Most implementations of ASP execute a program by first &quot;grounding&quot; the program, replacing all variables in rules by constants in all possible ways, and then using a propositional SAT solver, such as the DPLL algorithm to generate one or more models of the program.

Its applications are oriented towards solving difficult search problems and knowledge representation.

<text>The Phoenix Park Murders were the fatal stabbings of Lord Frederick Cavendish and Thomas Henry Burke in Phoenix Park, Dublin, Ireland, on 6 May 1882. Cavendish was the newly appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland and Burke was the Permanent Under-Secretary, the most senior Irish civil servant. The assassination was carried out by members of a republican organisation known as the Irish National Invincibles, a more radical breakaway from the Irish Republican Brotherhood.

==Murders==
The Irish National Invincibles failed numerous times to kill Chief Secretary William Edward Forster before he resigned his office in protest at the Kilmainham Treaty. The group then settled on a plan to kill the Permanent Under-Secretary Thomas Henry Burke at the Irish Office. Newly installed Chief Secretary Lord Frederick Cavendish, on the evening of his arrival to Ireland, decided to walk alone from Dublin Castle to his new residence in The Phoenix Park. Close to the entrance of Dublin Zoo, Burke, who just happened to also be on his way home to his residence in The Phoenix Park, spotted Cavendish and asked his carriage driver to stop and then continued on foot with Cavendish to the Viceregal Lodge, the &quot;out of season&quot; residence of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

The Invincibles had been following Burke for a number of days previous to this. Seven members of The Invincibles approached Burke and Cavendish. The first assassination was committed by Joe Brady, who stabbed Burke with a 12-inch knife, followed in short order by Tim Kelly, who stabbed Cavendish. Both men used surgical knives, delivered by Mary Ann Byrne, in order to avoid making a lot of noise while carrying out the killings. As previously mentioned, Cavendish had just arrived in Ireland that day so these men were completely unaware of his identity and he was not the intended target, however as he was now a witness to the assassination he could not be left alive. Thomas Myles, resident surgeon at the nearby Dr Steevens&#x27; Hospital, was summoned to render medical assistance to the victims.

The Lord Lieutenant, Lord Spencer, described hearing screams before witnessing a man running to the Lodge grounds shouting, &quot;Lord Frederick Cavendish and Mr. Burke are killed!&quot; The assailants were driven away in a cab by James Fitzharris, known as &quot;Skin-the-Goat&quot;, who served as a getaway driver.

==Investigation==
The hunt for the perpetrators was led by Superintendent John Mallon, a Catholic who came from Armagh. Mallon had a pretty shrewd idea of who was involved, suspecting a number of former Fenian activists. A large number of suspects were arrested and kept in prison claiming they were connected with other crimes. By playing off one suspect against another Mallon got several of them to reveal what they knew.

The case was successfully prosecuted by the Attorney General, Solicitor General James Murphy QC (later Mr Justice Murphy), and Peter O’Brien, before Justice William O’Brien. Invincibles&#x27; leader James Carey, Michael Kavanagh and Joe Hanlon agreed to testify against the others. Joe Brady, Michael Fagan, Thomas Caffrey, Dan Curley and Tim Kelly were convicted of the murders, and were hanged by William Marwood in Kilmainham Gaol in Dublin between 14 May and 9 June 1883. Others, convicted as accessories to the crime, were sentenced to serve long prison terms. Fitzharris was acquitted of murder but retried as an accessory and convicted.

Only the case of Kelly gave any real difficulty. He was 19 and generally said to look much younger, and by referring to him as &quot;a child&quot; his defence counsel created enough unease for two juries to disagree. Only after an unprecedented third trial was he found guilty.

==Implications==

Charles Stewart Parnell&#x27;s policy of allying his Irish Parliamentary Party to Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s Liberal Party in 1886 to enable Home Rule was undone by the murders. Gladstone&#x27;s Minister Lord Hartington, the elder brother of Lord Cavendish, split with Gladstone on the Home Rule bills of 1886 and 1893 and led the breakaway Liberal Unionist Association, which allied itself to Lord Salisbury&#x27;s Conservative governments. In the ensuing 1886 general election the Conservatives and Liberal Unionists swept the board. This delayed Home Rule by twenty-eight years until the Government of Ireland Act 1914, which was technically passed but was never effected.

==Reaction==
Parnell made a speech condemning the murders in 1882, increasing his already huge popularity in both Britain and Ireland. He had just enabled some reforms under the Kilmainham Treaty four days before the murders. Parnell&#x27;s reputation increased in Ireland, being seen as a more moderate reformer who would never excuse such tactics.

In March 1887, &quot;The Times&quot; printed letters purportedly from Parnell claiming sympathy with the murderers and that his public denunciation of them was insincere. It emerged that the letters were forgeries written by the journalist Richard Pigott, and Parnell was personally vindicated by the Parnell Commission in 1888–89.

==Memorial==

There is a cross cut into the grass at the location of the killings. It is long, filled with a small amount of gravel and cut thinly.

<doc id="210661" wikidata="Q12606852" url="?curid=210661" title="Media manipulation">
<text>Media manipulation refers to orchestrated campaigns in which actors exploit the distinctive features of broadcasting mass communications or digital media platforms to mislead, misinform, or create a narrative that advance their interests and agendas.

In practice, media manipulation tactics may include the use of the use of rhetorical strategies including logical fallacies, deceptive content like disinformation, and propaganda techniques, and often involve the suppression of information or points of view by crowding them out, by inducing other people or groups of people to stop listening to certain arguments, or by simply diverting attention elsewhere. In &quot;&quot;, Jacques Ellul writes that public opinion can only express itself through channels which are provided by the mass media of communication – without which there could be no propaganda.
== Contexts ==

=== Activism ===

Activism is the practice or doctrine that has an emphasis on direct vigorous action especially supporting or opposing one side of a controversial matter. It is quite simply starting a movement to affect or change social views. It is frequently started by influential individuals but is done collectively through social movements with large masses. These social movements can be done through public rallies, strikes, street marches, and social media.

=== Advertising ===
Advertising is a form of promotion that seeks to persuade a specific audience to purchase a good or service. One of the first types of marketing, it aims to influence its target market to either buy, sell, or carry out a particular action. 

These advertisements are not only done by businesses but can also be done by other groups. Non-commercial advertisers are those who spend money on advertising in the hope of raising awareness for a cause or promoting specific ideas.

=== Hoaxing ===

A hoax is something intended to deceive or defraud. Misleading public stunts, scientific frauds, false bomb threats and business scams are examples of hoaxes.

=== Propagandizing ===

Propagandizing is a form of communication that is aimed at influencing the attitude of a community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument. Propaganda is commonly created by governments, but some forms of mass communication created by other influential organizations can be considered propaganda. As opposed to impartially providing information, propaganda, in its most basic sense, presents information primarily to influence an audience. Propaganda is usually repeated and dispersed over a wide variety of media in order to create the desired result in audience attitudes. While the term propaganda has justifiably acquired a strongly negative connotation by association with its most manipulative and jingoistic examples (e.g. Nazi propaganda used to justify the Holocaust), propaganda in its original sense was neutral, and could refer to uses that were generally benign or innocuous, such as public health recommendations, signs encouraging citizens to participate in a census or election, or messages encouraging persons to report crimes to the police, among others.

Propaganda uses societal norms and myths that people hear and believe. Because people respond to, understand and remember more simple ideas this is what is used to influence people&#x27;s beliefs, attitudes and values.

=== Psychological warfare ===

Psychological warfare is a term used to denote actions taken by governments with the aim evoking a planned psychological reaction in other people.

This tactic has been used in multiple wars throughout history. During World War II, the western Allies, expected that the Soviet Union would drop leaflets on the US and England. During the conflict with Iraq, American and English forces dropped leaflets, with many of the leaflets telling the people how to surrender. In the Korean War both sides would use loud speakers from the front lines. In 2009 people in Israel in the Gaza war received text messages on their cell phones threatening them with rocket attacks. The Palestinian people were getting phone calls and leaflets warning them that they were going to drop rockets on them. These phone calls and leaflets were not always accurate.

=== Public relations ===

Public relations (PR) is the management of the flow of information between an individual or an organization and the public.

== Techniques ==
Means of influence include, but are not limited to, the methods outlined in &quot;&quot;, which include appealing to authority, and making the person aware of the scarcity of an offer.

===Internet manipulation===
==== Astroturfing ====
Astroturfing is when there is an intent and attempt to create the illusion of support for a particular cause, person, or stance. While this is mainly connected to and seen on the internet, it has also happened in newspapers during times of political elections. Corporations and political parties try to imitate grassroots movements in order to sway the public to believing something that is not true.
==== Clickbait ====
Clickbait refers to headlines of online news articles that are sensationalized or sometimes wholly fake. It uses people&#x27;s natural curiosity to get people to click. In some cases clickbait is used to generate income; more clicks mean more money is made with advertisers. But these headlines and articles can also be used to influence a group of people on social media. In some cases, they are constructed to appeal to the interest group&#x27;s pre-existing biases and thus to be shared within filter bubbles.

==== Information laundering ====
Information laundering is a method of using a less trusted or less popular platform to publish a story of dubious origin or veracity for the purposes of reporting on that report rather than the story itself. This technique serves to insulate the secondary, more established media from having to issue a retraction if the report is false. Generally, secondary reports will report that the original report is reporting without verifying or making the report themselves.

==== Search engine marketing ====

In search engine marketing, websites use market research from past searches and other sources to increase their visibility in search engine results pages. This allows them to guide search results along the lines they desire, thereby influencing searchers.

Businesses have many tactics to entice customers to their websites to generate revenue, such as banner ads, search engine optimization and pay-per-click marketing tools. They all serve a different purposes and use different tools that appeal to multiple types of users. Banner ads appear on sites in an attempt to attract visitors to a linked website. Search engine optimization is a technique in which a website is optimized to received a higher ranking from the search engine, causing it to be returned more often in searches.

=== Distraction ===

==== Distraction by major events ====
Commonly known as &quot;smoke screen&quot;, this technique consists of making the public focus its attention on a topic that is more convenient for the propagandist. This particular type of media manipulation has been referenced in popular culture. For example, the movie Wag the Dog (1997) illustrates how the public can be deceitfully distracted from an important topic by presenting another whose only quality is that of being more attractive.

Politicians might distract the public from domestic issues by diverting attention to global issues in order to reduce pressure domestically.

==== Distracting the public ====
This is a variation of the traditional arguments known, in logic as ad hominem and ad populum but applied to countries instead of individuals. This technique consists of refuting arguments by appealing to nationalism or by inspiring fear and hate toward a foreign country or all foreigners. It has the potential to be important since it gives the propagandists the power to discredit any information coming from other countries.

==== Straw man fallacy ====

An informal fallacy. The &quot;straw man&quot; consists of appearing to refute the opponent&#x27;s argument while attacking another topic. For it to work correctly the topic that was refuted and the one that should have been refuted need to be similar.

=== Audio manipulation ===
Audio manipulation is an artificially generated audio created by artificial intelligence (AI) to create a realistic-replication of someone&#x27;s voice. AI uses machine learning models and can replicate the specific characteristics of a target voice, such as pitch, tone, and cadence. It is commonly used to deceive and cause disruption.

=== Photo manipulation ===
Visual media can be transformed through photo manipulation, commonly called &quot;photoshopping.&quot; This can make a product, person, or idea seem more appealing. Specific product features are highlighted to attract and persuade the public, and specific editing tools are used to enhance the photo. Some techniques include cropping, resizing, airbrushing, color-enhancing, and removing or adding subjects from the original image. The motivation for photo manipulation may be for pure artistic creativity or more nefarious reasons to deceive. Photo manipulation is used extensively in the advertising and fashion industry and has been the subject of controversy for its part in false advertising and promoting unrealistic images of beauty.

===Video manipulation===
Video manipulation is a variant of media manipulation that targets digital video using a combination of traditional video processing and video editing techniques and auxiliary methods from artificial intelligence like face recognition. In typical video manipulation, the facial structure, body movements, and voice of the subject are replicated in order to create a fabricated recording of the subject. The applications of these methods range from educational videos to videos aimed at (mass) manipulation and propaganda, a straightforward extension of the long-standing possibilities of photo manipulation. This form of computer-generated misinformation has contributed to fake news, and there have been instances when this technology was used during political campaigns in an attempt to influence the outcome.

<doc id="210677" wikidata="Q5061609" url="?curid=210677" title="Central Park jogger case">
<text>The Central Park jogger case (sometimes termed the Central Park Five case) was a criminal case concerning the assault and rape of Trisha Meili, a woman who was running in Central Park in Manhattan, New York, on April 19, 1989. Crime in New York City was peaking in the late 1980s and early 1990s as the crack epidemic surged. On the night Meili was attacked, dozens of teenagers had entered the park, and there were reports of muggings and physical assaults.

Six teenagers were indicted in relation to the Meili assault. Charges against one, Steven Lopez, were dropped after Lopez pleaded guilty to a different assault. The remaining five—Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise (known as the Central Park Five, later the Exonerated Five)—were convicted of the charged offenses and served sentences ranging from seven to thirteen years.

More than a decade after the attack, while incarcerated for attacking five other women in 1989, serial rapist Matias Reyes confessed to the Meili assault and said he was the only actor; DNA evidence confirmed his involvement. The convictions against McCray, Richardson, Salaam, Santana, and Wise were vacated in 2002; Lopez&#x27;s convictions were vacated in July 2022.

From the outset the case was a topic of national interest. Initially, it fueled public discourse about New York City&#x27;s perceived lawlessness, criminal behavior by youths, and violence toward women. After the exonerations, the case became a prominent example of racial profiling, discrimination, and inequality in the legal system and the media. All five defendants sued the City of New York for malicious prosecution, racial discrimination, and emotional distress; the city settled the suit in 2014 for $41 million.

== Attacks ==

At 9:00p.m. on April 19, 1989, a group of an estimated 20 to 32 teenagers who lived in East Harlem entered Manhattan&#x27;s Central Park at an entrance in Harlem, near Central Park North. Some of the group committed several attacks, assaults, and robberies against people who were either walking, biking, or jogging in the northernmost part of the park near the reservoir, and victims began to report the incidents to police.

Within the North Woods, between 102nd and 105th Street, assailants were reported attacking several cyclists, hurling rocks at a cab, and attacking a pedestrian, whom they robbed of his food and beer and left unconscious. The teenagers roamed south along the park&#x27;s East Drive and the 97th Street transverse, between 9:00 and 10:00p.m. Police attempted to apprehend suspects after crimes began to be reported between 9:00 and 10:00p.m. Michael Vigna, a competitive bike rider, testified that, at about 9:05 p.m., he was hassled by a group of boys, one of whom tried to punch him. At about 9:15 p.m., Antonio Diaz, who had been walking in the park near 105th Street, was knocked to the ground by teenagers, who stole his bag of food and bottle of beer. And Gerald Malone and Patricia Dean, riding on a tandem, said that a group of boys tried to block their path on East Drive south of 102nd Street at about 9:15 p.m.; Malone said that he and Dean sped towards the boys, causing them to scatter, though Dean said that a few grabbed at her; the couple called police after reaching a call box.

At least some of the group of teenagers traveled farther south to the area around the reservoir, and, there, four male joggers were &quot;set upon&quot; between 9:25 and 9:50p.m. David Lewis testified that he was attacked and robbed about 9:25–9:40p.m. Robert Garner said he was assaulted at about 9:30p.m. David Good testified he was attacked at about 9:47p.m. And, between 9:40 and 9:50, John Loughlin was &quot;knocked to the ground, kicked, punched, and beaten with a pipe and stick&quot;; he sustained &quot;significant but not life-threatening injuries&quot;. At a pretrial hearing in October 1989, a police officer testified that when Loughlin was found, he was bleeding so badly that he &quot;looked like he was dunked in a bucket of blood&quot;.

===Rape of Trisha Meili===

Patricia &quot;Trisha&quot; Ellen Meili, a 28-year-old, was going for a regular run in Central Park shortly before 9:00p.m. While jogging, she was knocked down, dragged nearly off the roadway, and violently physically and sexually assaulted. About four hours later at 1:30 am, she was found naked, gagged, tied, and covered in mud and blood in a shallow ravine about 300 feet north of the 102nd Street Crossing, a wooded area of the park. The first policeman who saw her said: &quot;She was beaten as badly as anybody I&#x27;ve ever seen beaten. She looked like she was tortured.&quot; Meili was so badly injured that she was in a coma for 12 days, not awakening until May 1, according to a May 3 interview with her doctor.

She had severe hypothermia, severe brain damage, severe hemorrhagic shock, loss of 75–80 percent of her blood, and internal bleeding. Her skull had been fractured so badly that her left eye was dislodged from its socket, which in turn was fractured in 21 places.

Meili was not identified for about 24 hours, and it took days for the police to retrace her movements of that night. By the time of the trial of the first three suspects in June 1990, &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized the attack on the jogger as &quot;one of the most widely publicized crimes of the 1980&#x27;s&quot;.

== Arrests and investigation ==
=== Arrests of Lopez, McCray, Richardson, Salaam, Santana and Wise ===
Police took custody of Raymond Santana and Kevin Richardson, both 14 years of age, at approximately 10:15p.m. on Central Park West and 102nd Street. Steven Lopez, 15, was also arrested within an hour of several other attacks being reported to police. He was also interrogated.

Antron McCray and Yusef Salaam, both 15 years of age, were brought in for questioning later that day (April 20). They had been identified by other youths as participants in, or present at, attacks on other victims in Central Park. Korey Wise (then known as Kharey Wise), 16, accompanied Salaam for questioning, because they were friends, but was questioned himself.

Four of the six suspects, Salaam, Wise, Richardson, and Lopez, lived at the Schomburg Plaza, a mixed-income housing complex at the northeast corner of Central Park; two lived further north of there.

Analysis indicated that none of the suspects&#x27; DNA matched either of the two DNA samples collected from the crime scene (from the jogger&#x27;s cervix and running sock), but results were reported as &quot;inconclusive&quot; by the police.

====Confessions====

The videotaped confessions started on April 21, after the detectives finished unrecorded interrogations during which the suspects were in custody for at least seven hours. Santana, McCray, and Richardson made video statements in the presence of parents. Wise made several statements unaccompanied by any parent, guardian or counsel. Lopez was interviewed on videotape in the presence of his parents on April 21, 1989, beginning at 3:30a.m. He named others of the group by first names in the group attacks on other persons but denied any knowledge of the female jogger. None of the six had defense attorneys during the interrogations or videotape process. McCray, Richardson, Salaam, Santana and Wise told police they had been part of a makeshift group of about 30 people, some of whom had committed various crimes, some of who had merely observed those crimes. According to a later statement by District Attorney Nancy Ryan, &quot;[a]ll five implicated themselves in a number of the crimes which had occurred in the park.&quot;

While the accounts offered of the crimes beside the rape were accurate, their accounts of the rape contained discrepancies as to &quot;when, where and how it happened.&quot; Only Wise made any statement about the different times and locations of the jogger attack, and detectives had taken Wise to the park to observe the crime scene before he made his videotaped confession. None of the five said that he had raped the jogger, but each confessed to having been an accomplice—each youth said that he had only helped restrain the jogger, or touched her sexually, while one or more others had raped her. Their confessions varied as to who they identified as having participated in the rape, including naming several youths who were never questioned. In his untaped confession, Salaam went the furthest in admitting some culpability, claiming to have struck the jogger with a pipe at the beginning of the incident.

Although four suspects, all except Lopez and Salaam, confessed on videotape in the presence of a parent or guardian (who had generally not been present during the interrogations), each of the four retracted his statement within weeks. Together they claimed that they had been intimidated, lied to, and coerced by police into making false confessions. While the confessions were videotaped, the hours of interrogation that preceded the confessions were not.

When taken into custody, Salaam told the police he was 16 years old and showed them identification to that effect. If a suspect had reached 16 years of age, his parents or guardians no longer had a right to accompany him during police questioning, or to refuse to permit him to answer any questions. After Salaam&#x27;s mother arrived at the station, she insisted that she wanted a lawyer for her son, and the police stopped the questioning. He neither made a videotape nor signed the earlier written statement, but the court ruled to accept it as evidence before his trial. Detective Tom McKenna falsely told Salaam that his fingerprints had been found on the victim&#x27;s clothing; McKenna reported that Salaam subsequently confessed to being present at the scene of the rape. Years later, Salaam said, &quot;I would hear them beating up Korey Wise in the next room&quot;, and &quot;they would come and look at me and say: &#x27;You realize you&#x27;re next.&#x27; The fear made me feel really like I was not going to be able to make it out.&quot;

Two weeks after their confessions, each of the suspects recanted. They argued that their statements were coerced by police and that their rights to counsel and &quot;Miranda&quot; warnings had been violated.

===April 21 press conference===
On April 21, senior police investigators held a press conference to announce having apprehended about 20 suspects in the attacks of a total of nine people in Central Park two nights before and began to offer their theory of the attack and rape of the female jogger. Her name was withheld as a victim of a sex crime. The police said up to 12 youths were believed to have attacked the jogger.

New York City senior detectives said the term &quot;wilding&quot; was used by the suspects when describing their actions to police. This account of the term &quot;wilding&quot; was soon disputed by investigative reporter Barry Michael Cooper, who said that it originated in a police detective&#x27;s misunderstanding of the suspects&#x27; use of the phrase &quot;doing the wild thing&quot;, lyrics from rapper Tone Loc&#x27;s hit song &quot;Wild Thing&quot;.

==Media coverage==
At a time of concern about crime in general in the city, which was suffering high rates of assaults, rapes, and homicides, these attacks provoked great outrage, particularly the brutal rape of the female jogger. It took place in the public park that is &quot;mythologized as the city&#x27;s verdant, democratic refuge&quot;. New York Governor Mario Cuomo told the &quot;New York Post&quot;: &quot;This is the ultimate shriek of alarm.&quot;

Normal police procedures stipulated that the names of criminal suspects under the age of 16 were to be withheld from the media and the public. But this policy was ignored when the names of the arrested juveniles were released to the press before any of them had been formally arraigned or indicted. For example, the name of Kharey Wise (he later adopted the use of Korey as his first name) was published in an April 25, 1989, article in the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; about the attack on the female jogger.

By that time, more information had been published about the primary suspects in the rape, who did not seem to satisfy typical profiles of perpetrators. Reporters had found that some came from stable, financially secure families; police had ruled out drugs or major robbery, and most had no criminal records. On April 26, 1989, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a cautionary editorial against the use of labels and questioning why such &quot;well-adjusted youngsters&quot; could have committed such a &quot;savage&quot; crime.

After the major media&#x27;s decisions to print the names, photos, and addresses of the juvenile suspects, they and their families received serious threats. Other residents living at the Schomburg Plaza, where four suspects lived, were also threatened. Because of this, editors of &quot;The City Sun&quot; and the &quot;Amsterdam News&quot; chose to use Meili&#x27;s name in their continuing coverage of the events. Reverend Calvin O. Butts of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, who came to support the five suspects, said to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The first thing you do in the United States of America when a white woman is raped is round up a bunch of black youths, and I think that&#x27;s what happened here.&quot;

In most media accounts of the incident at that time, Meili was simply referred to as the &quot;Central Park Jogger&quot;, but two local TV stations violated the media policy of not publicly identifying the victims of sex crimes and released her name in the days immediately following the attack. Two newspapers aimed at the African American community—&quot;The City Sun&quot; and the &quot;Amsterdam News&quot;—and the black-owned talk radio station WLIB continued to cover the case as it progressed. Their editors said this was in response to the media having publicized the names and personal information about the five suspects, who were all minors before they were arraigned. The &quot;Open Line&quot; hosts on WRKS were credited with helping continue to cover the case until the convicted youths were cleared in 2002 of the crime.

===Trump’s ad===
About ten days after the boys started to confess, real estate magnate Donald Trump called on May 1, 1989, for the return of the death penalty for murder in full-page advertisements published in all four of the city&#x27;s major newspapers. Trump said he wanted the &quot;criminals of every age to be afraid&quot;. The advertisement, which cost an estimated , said, in part,
The &quot;New York Times&quot; has pointed out that, “The ad does not name any defendant, instead referring collectively to ‘roving bands of wild criminals.’” As to the particular defendants in this case, Trump said in 2002 that he greatly respected District Attorney Morgenthau, and was “sure the right answer will come out.” However, in 2016, Trump said, “They admitted they were guilty….The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous.” CNN assesses that, “Trump obviously still believes that the Central Park 5 are guilty, so it cannot be said he is lying or even misleading”, though his opinion is contrary to the financial settlement in 2014.

According to a contemporaneous article in the &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot;, the ad was &quot;widely condemned&quot;, including by then-Mayor Koch. Colin Moore, one of the attorneys defending one of the Central Park defendants, said that the ad &quot;proved that anything is possible in America&quot;, and that &quot;even a fool can become a multi-millionaire.&quot; According to defendant Yusef Salaam, quoted in a February 2016 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Trump &quot;was the fire starter&quot; in 1989, as &quot;common citizens were being manipulated and swayed into believing that we were guilty.&quot; Salaam said his family received death threats after papers ran Trump&#x27;s full-page ad urging the death penalty.

==1989–1991 criminal actions==
On May 10, 1989, Lopez, McCray, Richardson, Salaam, Santana, and Wise were indicted with attempted murder and other charges in the attack on and rape of the female jogger and additional charges related to the attack of David Lewis, the attack and robbery of John Loughlin, and riot. The prosecution arranged to try the six defendants in the Meili case in two separate groups. This enabled them to control the order in which certain evidence would be introduced to the court.

Each pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot;. The families of Lopez, Richardson, and Salaam were able to make the $25,000 bail imposed by the court. The two other youths under 16 were returned to a juvenile facility to be held there until trial. Classified as an adult at 16, Korey Wise was separated from the others and held in an adult jail at Rikers Island until trial.

=== Pre-trial hearings ===

Numerous pretrial hearings were conducted by Judge Thomas B. Galligan of the State Supreme Court of Manhattan, who had been assigned the case. Since 1986, judges were generally assigned by lottery, but the court administrator assigned him to this case. The defense attorneys criticized Galligan as being biased in favor of the assistant district attorney and handing down tough sentences. The counsel of the defendants filed a motion for a different judge which was rejected.

Defendants challenged the use of the videotaped confessions and statements, arguing that the confessions were coerced and that they had not been properly &quot;Mirandized&quot;. Salaam argued that his statement should be suppressed because it was made outside of the presence of his parents, despite the fact that New York law entitled children fifteen and younger to have their parents with them during the interrogation process. Galligan ruled that the statements were admissible—finding that they were made voluntarily. In Salaam&#x27;s case, Galligan found that Salaam had lied to the police about his age—telling them he was 16—and held that Salaam should not be able to derive a benefit from the falsehood.

===Trials===

==== First trial ====
In the first trial, which began June 25 and ended on August 18, 1990, defendants Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, and Raymond Santana were tried. Each of the teenagers had his own defense counsel. The jury consisted of four white Americans, four black Americans, three Hispanic Americans, and one Asian American. Meili testified at the trial, but her identity was not given to the court. None of the three defense attorneys cross-examined her. Meili was continually harassed by protesters during the case, both in the halls of the court and in the courtroom itself, who yelled obscenities at her such as &quot;slut&quot; and &quot;whore&quot;. When the defense attorneys refused to cross-examine her, the protesters heckled them as well.

The jury deliberated for 10 days before rendering its verdict on August 18. Each of the three youths was acquitted of attempted murder, but convicted of assault and rape of the female jogger, and convicted of assault and robbery of John Loughlin, a male jogger who was badly beaten that night in Central Park.

At the sentencing hearing, Salaam read aloud a poem in which he said, &quot;I look upon this legal lynching as a test by my God Allah.&quot; Salaam added, &quot;I and many others know I told the truth. I would never disrespect my own religion by lying,&quot; and he told Judge Galligan to ″[g]ive me the max,&quot; as &quot;[s]ooner or later the truth will come out.&quot; McCray told the judge: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to let this stop me. I&#x27;m going to make it.&quot; Santana said, &quot;Everyone knows I&#x27;m innocent of the crime. I never did it.&quot;

Salaam and McCray were 15 years old, and Santana 14 years old, at the time of the crime. Judge Thomas B. Galligan sentenced each of the defendants to the maximum allowed for juveniles, 5–10 years each in a youth correctional facility.

==== Second trial ====
The second trial, of Kevin Richardson and Korey Wise, began October 22, 1990 and also lasted about two months, ending in December. Kevin Richardson, 14 years old at the time of the crime, had been free on $25,000 bail before the trial.

Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer had a lengthy opening statement, and Wise broke down at the defense table after it, weeping and shouting that she had lied. He was removed temporarily from the courtroom. Richardson&#x27;s defense counsel made a motion for a mistrial, because of the potential effect on the jury, but the judge rejected it. The trial proceeded.

The defense attorneys noted that each youth had limited intellectual ability and said that neither was capable of preparing the written statements or videotaped confessions submitted by the prosecution as evidence. They contended that the confessions had been coerced from youths vulnerable to pressure because of their age and their intellectual capacity.

Meili testified again at this trial; again, her name was not given in court. This time one of the defense counsels, Wise&#x27;s lawyer, cross-examined her. She later said in an interview on &quot;Oprah&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you what—I didn&#x27;t feel wonderful about the boys&#x27; defense attorneys, especially the one who cross-examined me. He was right in front of my face and, in essence, calling me a slut by asking questions like &#x27;When&#x27;s the last time you had sex with your boyfriend?&#x27;&quot; Wise&#x27;s lawyer had also asked her whether she had ever been assaulted by men in her life, suggested that a man she knew may have attacked her, and implied that her injuries were not as severe as had been presented.

Richardson was the only one of the five defendants to be convicted of attempted murder of Meili, in addition to sodomy and assault of her, and robbery and riot in the attack on John Loughlin, another jogger in the park. He was sentenced to 5–10 years in a juvenile facility.

Korey Wise, 16 years old at the time of the crime, was acquitted of rape and attempted murder. At trial, Melody Jackson—the sister of one of Wise&#x27;s friends—testified that, while incarcerated in the Rikers Island, he had told her that he had restrained and fondled the jogger. Wise was convicted of lesser charges of sexual abuse, assault, and riot in the attack on the female jogger and on Loughlin. Because of his age and the violent nature of the felony charge, he was tried and sentenced as an adult, receiving 5–15 years in adult prison. After the verdict, Wise shouted at the prosecutor: &quot;You&#x27;re going to pay for this. Jesus is going to get you. You made this up.&quot;

Jurors who agreed to interviews after the trials said that they were not convinced by the youths&#x27; confessions, but were impressed by the physical evidence introduced by the prosecutors: semen, grass, dirt, and two hairs described as &quot;consistent with&quot; the victim&#x27;s hair that were recovered from Richardson&#x27;s underpants.

According to an FBI expert who gave evidence at the trial, all five defendants could be excluded as being the man who had left the semen samples inside Meili and on a sock. In total, 14 men were tested, including the defendants and Meili&#x27;s former boyfriend, and all were excluded. The semen belonged to another, unidentified male. Years later, more advanced DNA testing also revealed that the hairs in Richardson&#x27;s clothes did not match the victim.

====Criticism of the jury verdicts====
In a lengthy 1991 essay for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, Joan Didion suggested that the verdicts were symptomatic of a cultural crisis, writing, &quot;So fixed were the emotions provoked by this case that the idea that there could have been, for even one juror, even a moment&#x27;s doubt in the state&#x27;s case ... seemed, to many in the city, bewildering, almost unthinkable: the attack on the jogger had by then passed into narrative, and the narrative was ... about what was wrong with the city and about its solution&quot;.

In a 2016 &quot;Guardian&quot; article, defense counsel William Warren was reported saying that he thought Trump&#x27;s ads in 1989 had played a role in securing conviction by the juries, saying that &quot;he poisoned the minds of many people who lived in New York City and who, rightfully, had a natural affinity for the victim.&quot; He noted, &quot;Notwithstanding the jurors&#x27; assertions that they could be fair and impartial, some of them or their families, who naturally have influence, had to be affected by the inflammatory rhetoric in the ads.&quot; In 2019 &quot;Time&quot; magazine also assessed Trump&#x27;s ads in 1989 as having adversely affected the case for the defendants.

===Lopez&#x27;s plea deal===
Like the five others, Lopez was indicted for charges related to the attacks on both Meili and Loughlin. He denied any knowledge of the rape in his videotaped confession, but was implicated by other defendants&#x27; statements.

Although Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer had said she would not accept a plea deal for any of the defendants indicted in the rape case, she did come to agreement with Steven Lopez and his attorney in the court on January 30, 1991, prior to a new jury being selected for his trial. He was considered the final of the six defendants in the jogger trial. Because Lopez had not acknowledged participating at all in the rape in his statement to police, and prosecution witnesses had withdrawn from testifying, based on what they said was fear of self-incrimination or &quot;fear [for] their own safety&quot;, according to Lederer, the prosecution&#x27;s case was extremely weak. He was sentenced in March 1991 to to years, after pleading guilty to the mugging of jogger John Loughlin. Because Lopez was younger than 16 at the time of the crime, he was sentenced to serve his time in a juvenile facility.

===Appeals===
Four of the six—all but Santana and Lopez—appealed their convictions, varyingly challenging Judge Galligan&#x27;s decision to admit their confessions and whether their confessions were sufficiently corroborated by other evidence. Their convictions were upheld.

==Incarceration==
Through their time of incarceration, McCray, Richardson, Salaam, Santana, and Wise maintained their innocence in the rape and attack of Meili, including at hearings before parole boards. While they acknowledged &quot;witnessing or participating in other wrongdoing&quot; in the park, they each maintained innocence in the attack of Meili.

Richardson, Salaam, and Santana attended classes and earned a GED and also completed an associate degree while there.

Wise had to serve all of his time in adult prison, and encountered so much personal violence that he asked to stay in isolation for extended periods. He was held at four different prisons, having asked for transfers in the hope of improving his situation. He was released in August 2002, the last of the five men to leave prison.

Santana was released in 1995; McCray in 1996; and Salaam and Richardson in 1997. Wise was released in August 2002.

==Discovery of assailant==

In 2001, Matias Reyes met Wise when they were held at the Auburn Correctional Facility in upstate New York. Reyes subsequently informed a corrections officer that he had raped Meili. In 2002, Reyes told officials that on the night of April 19, 1989, he had assaulted and raped the female jogger. He was 17 years old at the time of the assault and said that he had committed it alone. He also said that he had intended to burglarize the victim&#x27;s apartment. Reyes was then working at an East Harlem convenience store on Third Avenue and 102nd Street, and living in a van on the street.

Reyes was believed to have raped another woman in the same area of the park during the day on April 17, two days before the attack on Meili. Initially the Meili case was investigated as a homicide, and the April 17 rape was investigated as a rape assault, which resulted in a lack of comparison of the DNA recovered in the two cases. The NYPD did not have a DNA database until 1994; after that, detectives and prosecutors had access to common information about DNA from evidence and taken from suspects in certain crimes. During the summer of 1989, Reyes raped four women, killing one, and was interrupted after robbing a fifth—he was sentenced to years to life after he pleaded guilty to the top counts in each case.

District Attorney Robert Morgenthau&#x27;s office was notified of the confession in 2002. Morgenthau appointed a team led by Assistant District Attorneys Nancy Ryan and Peter Casolaro to investigate the case, based on Reyes&#x27;s confession and a review of evidence. Reyes provided officials with a detailed account of the attack, details of which were corroborated by other evidence which the police held. In addition, his DNA matched the DNA evidence at the scene, confirming that he was the sole source of the semen found in and on the victim &quot;to a factor of one in 6,000,000,000 people&quot;. Reyes&#x27; DNA matched the semen found on Meili, and he provided other confirmatory evidence. In announcing these facts, Morgenthau also said that the perpetrator had tied up Meili with her T-shirt in a distinctive fashion that Reyes used again on later victims in crimes for which he was convicted.

Based on interviews and other evidence, the team believed that Reyes had acted alone: The rape appeared to have taken place in the North Woods area after the main body of the thirty teenagers had moved well to the south, and the timeline reconstruction of events made it unlikely that he was joined by any of the defendants. In addition, Reyes was not known to have been associated with any of the six indicted defendants. He lived at 102nd Street, in what locals considered another neighborhood. None of the six defendants in the rape mentioned him by name in association with the rape.

Because Reyes&#x27;s confession occurred after New York&#x27;s then-five-year statute of limitations had passed, he was not charged with the offense.
 Reyes claimed he came forward because &quot;it was the right thing to do&quot;.

==Convictions of the Five and Lopez vacated==
Based on newly discovered evidence—specifically, an affidavit by Reyes confessing to the crime and declaring that he acted alone—Wise, McCray, Santana, Richardson, and Salaam filed motions to have their convictions set aside and for the court &quot;to grant whatever further relief may be just and proper.&quot; In late 2002, Robert Morgenthau, District Attorney for New York County, conducted an investigation into the potential innocence of Wise, McCray, Santana, Richardson, and Salaam. Nancy Ryan, an ADA in Morgenthau&#x27;s office, filed an affirmation supporting motions by the defendants to vacate their convictions in December 2002. Ryan&#x27;s affirmation recommended vacating the convictions of Wise, McCray, Santana, Richardson, and Salaam. Though the &quot;newly discovered evidence&quot; only related to Meili&#x27;s assault, Ryan found that the defendants&#x27; contemporaneous confessions as to the other crimes could not reliably be disentangled from their false rape confessions, and, as such, she recommended granting the defendants&#x27; motions as to each of the convictions.

As to Meili&#x27;s assault, the DA&#x27;s office questioned the veracity of the confessions, pointing to the many inconsistencies between them and their lack of correspondence to established facts.

In addition, the filing noted that, based on a reconstruction of events, the teenagers were either spectating or participating in other crimes in the park at the time that the rape occurred. Ryan continued: &quot;Ultimately, there proved to be no physical or forensic evidence recovered at the scene or from the person or effects of the victim which connected the defendants to the attack on the jogger, or could establish how many perpetrators participated.&quot;

The five defendants&#x27; convictions were vacated by New York Supreme Court Justice Charles J. Tejada on December 19, 2002. As Morgenthau recommended, Tejada&#x27;s order vacated the convictions for all the crimes of which the defendants had been convicted. All five of the defendants had completed their prison sentences at the time of Tejada&#x27;s order; their names were cleared in relation to this case. This also enabled them being removed from New York State&#x27;s sex offender registry. In addition to having had difficulty getting employment or renting housing, as registered offenders, they had been required to report to authorities in person every three months. The city government also withdrew all charges against the men.

On July 25, 2022, Steven Lopez&#x27;s robbery conviction was overturned, and the indictment against him dismissed after District Attorney Alvin Bragg filed a motion to vacate. According to Bragg, &quot;Mr. Lopez was charged and pleaded guilty in the face of false statements, unreliable forensic analysis and immense external pressure.&quot;

==Aftermath==
The DA&#x27;s recommendation to vacate the convictions was strongly opposed by lead detectives on the case and other members of the police department. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly complained at the time that Morgenthau&#x27;s staff had denied his detectives access to &quot;important evidence&quot; needed to conduct a thorough investigation.

Linda Fairstein, who directed the original prosecution, agreed with the decision to vacate the rape charges but said the separate assault charges should have remained. Morgenthau would later express regret assigning the case to Fairstein, saying &quot;I had complete confidence in Linda Fairstein. Turned out to be misplaced. But we rectified it.&quot;

===Armstrong Report===

Following these events, in 2002, New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly commissioned a panel to review the case, &quot;To determine whether the new evidence [from the Reyes affidavit and related evidence, and Morgenthau&#x27;s investigation] indicated that police supervisors or officers acted improperly or incorrectly, and to determine whether police policy or procedures needed to be changed as a result of the Central Park jogger case.&quot; The panel was chaired by attorney Michael F. Armstrong, the former chief counsel to the Knapp Commission, which in 1972 had documented widespread corruption in the NYPD. Two other attorneys were included: Jules Martin, a former police officer and now New York University Vice President; and Stephen Hammerman, deputy police commissioner for legal affairs. The panel issued a 43-page report in January 2003.

In its January 2003 Armstrong Report, the panel &quot;did not dispute the legal necessity of setting aside the convictions of the five defendants based on the new DNA evidence that Mr. Reyes had raped the jogger.&quot; But it disputed acceptance of Reyes&#x27;s claim that he alone had raped the jogger. It said there was &quot;nothing but his uncorroborated word&quot; that he acted alone. Armstrong said the panel believed &quot;the word of a serial rapist killer is not something to be heavily relied upon.&quot;

The report concluded that the five men whose convictions had been vacated had &quot;most likely&quot; participated in the beating and rape of the jogger and that the &quot;most likely scenario&quot; was that &quot;both the defendants and Reyes assaulted her, perhaps successively.&quot; The report said Reyes had most likely &quot;either joined in the attack as it was ending or waited until the defendants had moved on to their next victims before descending upon her himself, raping her and inflicting upon her the brutal injuries that almost caused her death.&quot;

New York City detectives supported the 2003 Armstrong Report by the police department. The panel said there had been &quot;no misconduct in the 1989 investigation of the Central Park jogger case&quot;.

As to the five defendants, the report said:

Edward Conlon, a writer and former New York police officer, said that Armstrong, &quot;[i]n support of his assessment, ... offers a number of tantalizing theories, only partially undergirded by fully explored evidence&quot;. He characterized the report as &quot;resembl[ing] a defense document more than a prosecution brief in its approach, throwing everything against the wall to see what sticks&quot;.

===Lawsuits against New York City===
In 2003, McCray, Richardson, Santana, Salaam, and Wise sued the City of New York in federal court, accusing the city&#x27;s police and prosecutors of false arrest, malicious prosecution and a racially motivated conspiracy to deprive the men of their civil rights. The defendants sought $52 million.

Under Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s mayoral administration, the city refused to pursue a settlement for the lawsuits based on a conclusion that the defendants had had a fair trial. Speaking at a news conference in 2002, Bloomberg spoke of his confidence regarding the actions of the police department. &quot;As far as I can tell, the N.Y.P.D. did exactly what they should have done a number of years ago when the terrible incident took place ... If we see any reason to think that we acted inappropriately, [Police] Commissioner Kelly will certainly take appropriate measures. But so far we believe that the N.Y.P.D. did act appropriately.&quot;

In 2011, Celeste Koeleveld, then New York City&#x27;s Executive Assistant Corporation Counsel for Public Safety, gave a public statement on behalf of the city after receiving public criticism from Councilman Charles Barron for failing to resolve the lawsuits:

After the election of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had run on a campaign promise to resolve the matter, the city endeavored to settle the suit; in a June 2014 press conference, de Blasio announced a proposed settlement payment of about $40 million—nearly $1 million per year of incarceration for each defendant.

The settlement was officially approved in September 2014. Santana, Salaam, McCray, and Richardson each received around $7.1 million from the city for their years in prison, while Wise received $12.2 million because he had served six additional years. The city did not admit to any wrongdoing in the settlement.

The five defendants subsequently sued the state in the New York Court of Claims, before Judge Alan Marin. The New York courts allowed the second suit because, unlike the first suit, which was predicated on civil-rights violations, the second suit was based on claims for economic and emotional devastation caused by incarceration. Speaking of the second suit, against the state, Santana said: &quot;When you have a person who has been exonerated of a crime, the city provides no services to transition him back to society. The only thing left is something like this—so you can receive some type of money so you can survive.&quot;

In 2016, the state-court suit settled for $3.9 million, with varying amounts related to the period of time that each man had served in prison.

====Reaction to settlements====
After New York City had settled the federal suit, some figures returned to the media to dispute the court&#x27;s 2002 decision to vacate the convictions. Retired New York City detective Edward Conlon, who had been involved with the case, in an article published in October 2014 in &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, quoted incriminatory statements allegedly made by some of the youths after they had been taken into custody by police in April 1989.

Similarly, two doctors who had treated Meili after the attack said in 2014, after the settlement, that some of her injuries appeared to be inconsistent with Reyes&#x27;s claim that he had acted alone. But a forensic pathologist who testified at the 1990 trial said that it was impossible to tell from the victim&#x27;s injuries how many people had participated in the assault, as did New York City&#x27;s chief medical examiner in 2002. Meili, who had no memory of what happened, said at the time of the settlement that she believed there had been more than one attacker and expressed her regret that the case had been settled.

Donald Trump also commented on the settlement in a 2014 opinion article for the New York &quot;&quot;Daily News&quot;&quot;. He said the settlement was &quot;a disgrace&quot;, and that the men were likely guilty: &quot;Settling doesn&#x27;t mean innocence. ... Speak to the detectives on the case and try listening to the facts. These young men do not exactly have the pasts of angels.&quot; During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump again said that the Exonerated Five were guilty and that their convictions should not have been vacated. The Exonerated Five criticized Trump at the time for his statement, stating they had falsely confessed under police coercion. Other critics included U.S. Senator John McCain, who said that Trump&#x27;s responses were &quot;outrageous statements about the innocent men in the case&quot;. He cited this as among his reasons to retract his endorsement of the candidate. In June 2019 Trump stated he would not apologize, saying the Exonerated Five &quot;admitted their guilt&quot;.

Meili later commented that she wished the matter would have been retried, rather than settled out of court, and that she believed her attack was not the result of a single person.

===Trisha Meili===

The initial medical prognosis was that Meili would die of her injuries or remain in a permanent coma. She was given last rites. Meili came out of her coma after 12 days on May 1st, unable to talk, read, or walk. She was then treated for seven weeks in Metropolitan Hospital in East Harlem before being transferred to Gaylord Hospital, a long-term acute care center in Wallingford, Connecticut, where she spent six months in rehabilitation. She did not walk until mid-July 1989. She returned to work eight months after the attack. She largely recovered, with some lingering disabilities related to balance and loss of vision. As a result of the severe trauma, she had no memory of the attack or any events up to an hour before the assault, nor of the six weeks following the attack.

Meili returned to work at the investment bank. In April 2003, Meili confirmed her identity to the media when she published a memoir entitled &quot;I Am the Central Park Jogger: A Story of Hope and Possibility&quot;. She began a career as an inspirational speaker. She also works with victims of sexual assault and brain injury in the Mount Sinai Hospital sexual assault and violence intervention program. She had resumed jogging in 1989, three or four months after the attack, and over the years added a variety of other exercise and yoga practice. She continues to manifest some after-effects of the assault, including memory loss.

===Lives of the Exonerated Five===
After being released from prison in September 1996, McCray moved to Maryland and became a forklift operator. He is married, has six children, and lives and works in Georgia.

Richardson acted as an advocate with Santana and Salaam to reform New York State&#x27;s criminal justice practices, advocating methods to prevent false confessions and eyewitness misidentifications. He also participated in a series of talks on criminal-justice reform and wrongful convictions.

Salaam became a board member of the Innocence Project and has advocated for criminal-justice reform, particularly for juveniles. In 2016, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from President Barack Obama. In 2017, he and Fernando Bermudez penned an op ed for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; in support of two criminal-justice-reform measures offered by then-Governor Andrew Cuomo: one proposal would require police interrogations to be recorded from start to finish; the second would provide training to police officers to protect against misidentification. The budget proposal passed, and the video-recording requirement took effect April 1, 2018. Salaam started Yusef Speaks LLC and works as a motivational speaker. Salaam declared his candidacy for the open New York City Council&#x27;s 9th District in 2023, after incumbent Kristin Richardson Jordan declined to run for reelection. Salaam won the Democratic nomination for the seat on June 27, 2023, and officially won the seat on November 7, 2023.

Santana was released from prison in December 1995, and was out of prison for six months before he was found guilty of possession of crack cocaine in 1998 and reincarcerated for a term of 3.5 to 7 years. He was released in 2002 when the prosecutor, agreeing that his sentence had been higher due to his (then-vacated) conviction for raping Meili, reduced it to the 18–48 months that would typically have been given to a first-time offender. Santana started a clothing company, Park Madison NYC, and donates a portion of Park Madison NYC&#x27;s proceeds to the Innocence Project. Santana has also appeared with other involved men in presentations at local schools and colleges.

After his release, Wise changed his first name to Korey; he found work as a construction worker and, for a time, as an office cleaner for Reverend Al Sharpton. Wise remained in New York City, where he works as a speaker and justice reform activist. He donated $190,000 of his 2014 settlement to the chapter of the Innocence Project at the University of Colorado Law School, to aid other wrongfully convicted people to gain exoneration; they renamed the project in his honor as the Korey Wise Innocence Project.

The Five made the news in late March and early April 2023, after Trump was indicted on felony charges of falsifying business records in an alleged hush money payment scheme and cover-up before the 2016 presidential election. Salaam issued a one-word statement: &quot;Karma&quot;. He reminded the world that Trump never apologized for the misdirected vengeance and ran a full-page ad in the &quot;New York Times&quot; with the headline text, &quot;Bring back justice &amp; fairness. Build a brighter future for Harlem!&quot; Raymond Santana, on social media, urged for people to &quot;never forget&quot; Trump&#x27;s actions. Rev. Al Sharpton noted the irony of both trials taking place in the same downtown Manhattan courthouse building: &quot;what goes around comes around.&quot;

During a presidential debate on September 10, 2024, Trump falsely said the Five had initially pleaded guilty to the assault before changing their pleas (actually some of them had confessed but recanted before entering any official plea); Trump also described during the debate his viewpoint at the time of those events: “I said, &#x27;well, if they pled guilty they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately….” Doctors predicted the victim might ultimately die of her injuries, but she survived. On October 21, the Five sued Trump for defamation in federal court in Philadelphia, where he had made the allegedly defamatory statements.

===Legislative and other justice reforms===
Because of the great publicity surrounding the case, the vacated conviction of Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise highlighted the issue of false confessions. The issue of false confessions has become a major topic of study and efforts at criminal justice reform, particularly for juveniles. Juveniles have been found to make false confessions and guilty pleas at a much higher rate than adults.

Advances in DNA analysis and the work of non-profit groups such as the Innocence Project have resulted in 343 people being exonerated of their crimes due to DNA testing. This process has revealed the strong role of false confessions in wrongful convictions. According to a 2016 study by Craig J. Trocino, director of the Miami Law Innocence Clinic, 27 percent of those persons had &quot;originally confessed to their crimes&quot;.

Members of the Five have been among activists who have advocated for videotaped interrogations and related reforms to try to prevent false confessions. Since 1989, New York and some 24 other states have passed laws requiring &quot;electronic records of full interrogations&quot;. In some cases, this requirement is limited to certain types of crimes.

==Contemporaneous cases compared by the media==

The Central Park events, which were attributed at the time to members of the large group of youths who attacked numerous persons in the park, including whites, blacks and Hispanics, were covered as an extreme example of the violence that was occurring in the city, including assaults and robberies, rapes and homicides. Focusing on rapes in the same week as the one in Central Park, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on April 29, 1990, on the &quot;28 other first-degree rapes or attempted rapes reported across New York City&quot;. The fourth one, on April 17, took place during the day in the park and is now tied to Reyes.

Later after the Central Park rape, when public attention was on the theory of a gang of young suspects, a brutal attack took place in Brooklyn on May 3, 1989. A 39-year-old black woman was robbed, raped and thrown from the roof of a four-story building by three young men. She fell 50 feet, suffering severe injuries. The incident received little media coverage in May 1989, when the focus was on the Central Park case. The woman&#x27;s injuries required extensive hospitalization and rehabilitation.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; continued to report on the case, and followed up on prosecution of suspects. Tyrone Prescott, 17, Kelvin Furman, 22, and another young man, Darren Decotea (name corrected a few days later as Darron Decoteau), 17, were apprehended within two weeks and prosecuted for the crimes. They arranged plea deals with the prosecution in October 1990 before trial; the first two were sentenced to six to 18 years in prison. Decoteau had made a plea deal in February in which he agreed to testify against the other two. He was sentenced on October 10, 1990, to four to twelve years in prison. Social justice activists and critics have pointed to the lack of extensive coverage of the attack of the woman in Brooklyn as showing the media&#x27;s racial bias; they have accused it of overlooking violence against minority women.

==Representation in other media==

* Ken Burns, Sarah Burns and her husband David McMahon premiered their &quot;The Central Park Five&quot;, a documentary film about the case, at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2012. Documentarian Ken Burns said he hoped the material of the film would push the city to settle the men&#x27;s case against it. On September 12, 2012, attorneys for New York City subpoenaed the production company for access to the original footage in connection with its defense of the 2003 federal civil lawsuit brought against the city by three of the convicted youths. Celeste Koeleveld, the city&#x27;s executive assistant corporation counsel for public safety, justified the subpoena on the grounds that the film had &quot;crossed the line from journalism to advocacy&quot; for the wrongfully convicted men. In February 2013, U.S. Judge Ronald L. Ellis the city&#x27;s subpoena.
* On May 31, 2019, &quot;When They See Us&quot;, a four-episode miniseries, was released on Netflix. Ava DuVernay co-wrote and directed the drama. Its release and wide viewing on Netflix prompted renewed discussion of the case, the criminal justice system, and of the lives of the five men. It has resulted in a civil libel lawsuit by Fairstein.
* An opera, also called &quot;The Central Park Five&quot;, premiered in Long Beach, California, performed by the Long Beach Opera Company, on June 15, 2019. The music is by composer Anthony Davis and the libretto by Richard Wesley. Davis won the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Music for this work. An earlier version, &quot;Five&quot;, had premiered in Newark, New Jersey, by the Trilogy Company.

<text>A wire-guided missile is a missile that is guided by signals sent to it via thin wires connected between the missile and its guidance mechanism, which is located somewhere near the launch site. As the missile flies, the wires are reeled out behind it (command guidance). This guidance system is most commonly used in anti-tank missiles, where its ability to be used in areas of limited line-of-sight make it useful, while the range limit imposed by the length of the wire is not a serious concern.

The longest range wire-guided missiles in current use are limited to about . 

== History ==
Electrical wire guidance dates back to the early 20th century with an early example being the Lay Torpedo. A prototype ground-based electrical wire-guided torpedo was built by the Germans during World War II.

The pair of deployed German guided air-delivered ordnance designs, the Fritz X and Henschel Hs 293, both used the &quot;Kehl-Strassburg&quot; radio guidance system for control. However, because the British proved to be able to develop countermeasures to interfere with the Germans&#x27; use of the &quot;Kehl-Strassburg&quot; ordnance guidance system, rushed projects were started in 1944 in order to develop alternatives. The first system to be modified in this fashion was the Henschel Hs 293 anti-ship missile. Other examples included the X-4 missile.

The X-7 influenced other military thinkers after the war. By the early 1950s a number of experimental systems had been developed (for example, Malkara missile), leading to their widespread deployment in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Large numbers of Israeli tanks were destroyed using wire-guided AT-3 Sagger missiles during the Yom Kippur War of 1973. Wire guidance has remained the main system for most smaller weapons although newer systems such as laser beam riding have come into use in anti-aircraft and some anti-tank use roles (such as the US Hellfire missile and the Russian 9M133 Kornet).

Some torpedoes can be wire-guided, such as the U.S. Mk 48 Advanced Capability (ADCAP) torpedo, Russian UGST torpedo, or the Swedish Torped 613, which is guided by an insulated wire.

<text>Pertti Olavi &quot;Spede&quot; Pasanen (10 April 1930 – 7 September 2001) was a Finnish film director and producer, comedian, and inventor, who has been called an &quot;all-around entertainer&quot;. During his career he directed, wrote, produced or acted in about 50 movies and participated in numerous TV productions, including the comedy &quot;Spede Show&quot; and the game-show &quot;Speden Spelit&quot;. Much of his more commercial work was in collaboration with Vesa-Matti Loiri (whose most popular character created by Pasanen was Uuno Turhapuro; first in TV sketches and then in a long-lasting series of motion pictures) and Simo Salminen. Pasanen&#x27;s films and TV shows, often made quickly and on a low budget, usually received little critical recognition but were popular among Finnish audiences from the 1960s onwards. He was the owner of his own film production company, Filmituotanto Spede Pasanen Ky. Pasanen was ranked 17th at the &quot;Suuret suomalaiset&quot; competition show broadcast by Yleisradio.

==Childhood and youth==
Pertti Olavi Pasanen was born in April 1930 in Kuopio. He was the eldest child of Kusti and Helmi Pasanen (née Rantala). His father was a forestry technician and worked as the district chief of the paper company Ahlström. Other children in the family included Pertti&#x27;s little sister Virpi and little brother Risto. Pasanen&#x27;s family lived in the Linnanpelto district. By Kuopio standards, the family was of upper middle class. The nickname &quot;Spede&quot; comes from an earlier nickname &quot;Speedy&quot; which he got from playing ice hockey, and was given to him at an early age. The nickname &quot;Speedy&quot; came from the fictional mouse character Speedy Gonzales, the hero of Warner Brothers&#x27; &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;.


Pasanen&#x27;s interests at school age included entertainment, sports, various games and inventions. He was the star of the Kuopio Lyceum&#x27;s evening programs, played ice hockey with passion and performed chemical experiments in his home&#x27;s basement. However, he did badly at school. In spring 1948 he got a report card with five 4 grades (failing grade in the Finnish school system) and stayed behind in his class after spending most of the spring by building a custom scooter from parts he had found from junk shops. After Pertti Pasanen had ended up in arguments with most of his teachers, his parents sent him to another school. In autumn 1950 Spede Pasanen moved to the Iisalmi lyceum, from where he matriculated in the Olympic spring of 1952. He spent the next year doing his military service and completed it with the rank of Sub-lieutenant in the anti-aircraft branch. In the military he also performed in the entertainment parade of the defence forces, which circulated between barracks entertaining soldiers.

In autumn 1953 Pasanen moved to Helsinki and started his studies at the Faculty of State Politics at the University of Helsinki. Instead of studying, he concentrated on social life at the Nation of Savonia, where he usually acted as host and master of ceremonies at parties. Pasanen&#x27;s student indoctrinations and initiations of new students gained fame throughout the university. In the university he also met Jukka Virtanen and Matti Kuusla who became important partners for him. Kuusla, working at Fennada-Filmi as a studio assistant got him a background role in the 1954 film &quot;Laivan kannella&quot;. He appeared in the film as a man at a bar.

==Career==
===Radio career===

During the late 1950s and early 1960s Spede was a noted presence as a radio comedian. He applied to work at Yleisradio twice in 1956 and again in 1959 as an entertainment provider (ajanvietetoimittaja). On the first try Aune Ala-Tuuhonen, a secretary of the entertainment board and an experienced entertainment scriptwriter, was hired instead of Pasanen. Pasanen applied again in 1959 when the popular Niilo Tarvajärvi moved over to television. Pasanen sent another application which was almost completely identical to his first one, and attached a note &quot;my folder is already there&quot;. This time he was hired.

Pasanen brought into radio the screwball comedy style he had assumed in the conventions at the Iisalmi Lyceum and at student nation parties. He was inspired by American film comedians such as Bob Hope, Jerry Lewis and Danny Kaye and wanted to bring the swift and clever style of American comedy into Finnish radio. He felt right at home in front of a live audience and hosted live performances with ease, whereas many other entertainment providers feared them. Pasanen started his radio career by hosting Tarvajärvi&#x27;s former program &quot;Aamutuimaan&quot; broadcast on Sunday mornings, and according to the chief of the entertainment division Antero Alpola the program soon became &quot;Spede&#x27;s personal crazy show produced almost entirely without helping staff&quot;.

The names of the programs varied, but the basic idea remained the same: craziness and tricks with words to amaze the listeners. Pasanen&#x27;s most popular program was &quot;Ruljanssiriihi&quot; which combined sketch-comedy and musical performances. The program eventually developed into the program &quot;Hupiklubi&quot;. Pasanen&#x27;s programs were one-hour-long entertainment shows broadcast on Saturday evenings, combining music, sketch comedy and individual jokes.

Pasanen and actor Leo Jokela also created the break-out character G. Pula-Aho (voiced by Jokela), a smart-talking, Helsinki slang speaking parrot who would insult Pasanen on &quot;Ruljanssiriihi&quot;. Pasanen invented Pula-aho&#x27;s style of talking when he asked Jokela to imitate the quiz show host Tauno Rautiainen. In the sketches, Jokela played Pula-aho by speaking through gritted teeth, in a manner similar to Rautiainen. This made both Pasanen and Jokela more familiar with the audience. These sketches where the clever parrot unashamedly insulted the show&#x27;s stupid host became favourites among the audience and tens of episodes were made from 1960 to 1964. Pasanen published a book called &quot;Papukaija G. Pula-ahon seikkailut&quot; about G. Pula-aho, containing sketches performed by the parrot.

Spede&#x27;s other programs included &quot;Tervahöyry Hyrskynmyrskyn suvisilla laineilla&quot;, &quot;Hyvää iltaa – tulkaa mukaan&quot; and &quot;Kesäterässä&quot;.

Antero Alpola wrote in his memoirs that he was certain that when Spede Pasanen was hired to the radio, he had not even imagined he would stay there for the whole of his career, but instead it would just be one phase of his personal career: &quot;He was such a personal program creator, that a &#x27;normal&#x27; entertainment provider&#x27;s job just isn&#x27;t fit for him. He doesn&#x27;t listen to ready-made tapes by others and make fixes to them, he doesn&#x27;t create ideas for others, he doesn&#x27;t sift through scripts. He doesn&#x27;t contact people unless they are part of his own program. According to my understanding, he isn&#x27;t even a group performer, even though he works with groups and needs them. The group just serves his purpose.&quot;

The radio started becoming cramped for Pasanen in the middle 1960s. He was making more and more of his own entertainment gigs and got into a dispute about his salary with the management board of Yleisradio. This dispute was the main reason why Pasanen quit his job at the radio in 1964 and instead moved wholly to film and television production.

===Film actor career===
In autumn 1953 Pasanen moved to Helsinki and started his studies at the Faculty of Government Sciences at the University of Helsinki. Instead of studying, he concentrated on student nation life at the Savonian Nation, where he acted as a general master of ceremonies and organiser of parties. Especially the initiation parties of new students organised by Pasanen gained fame throughout the university and other student nations. At the university he also met Jukka Virtanen and Matti Kuusla, both of which later became important business colleagues for him. In 1954 Kuusla, who had worked as a studio assistant at Fennada-Filmi, got Pasanen a role as a background extra in the film &quot;Laivan kannella&quot;, where he appeared as a member of a sailors&#x27; club.

Already at the Kuopio Lyceum Pasanen had assembled a band called Bluff Brothers, consisting of Pasanen himself as well as Pentti Nevaluoma and later also Matti Kuusla, who joined the band in Helsinki. In the band, Nevaluoma played the guitar, while Pasanen and Kuusla made various noises to mix in with the guitar playing. Bluff Brothers played in Pasanen&#x27;s own shows and public events. The band split up in 1963 when Nevaluoma moved to Jyväskylä where he founded a restaurant.

In the 1950s, Pasanen got a steady job as an assistant at Fennada-Filmi. After working as a background extra, he got his first significant speaking role in the &quot;Finland Western&quot; film &quot;Villi Pohjola&quot; directed by Aarne Tarkas in 1955. At the same time, Pasanen was looking for a way to get roles at other film companies as well. During the 1950s he appeared in various background roles in comedies produced both by Fennada-Filmi and Suomen Filmiteollisuus, such as &quot;Tyttö lähtee kasarmiin&quot; (1956), &quot;Vääpelin kauhu&quot; (1957) and &quot;Asessorin naishuolet&quot; (1958). He also auditioned for the part of Antero Rokka in the 1955 film &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;, but the part went to Reino Tolvanen. Armand Lohikoski took Pasanen into minor roles in three Pekka ja Pätkä films: &quot;Pekka ja Pätkä ketjukolarissa&quot; (1957), &quot;Pekka ja Pätkä sammakkomiehinä&quot; (1957) and &quot;Pekka ja Pätkä Suezilla&quot; (1958).

In 1958 Pasanen got a unique role: he appeared in the main role at the Finnish National Ballet&#x27;s version of the novel &quot;Don Quijote&quot; by Miguel de Cervantes. The National Ballet was not looking for a ballet dancer as such for the main role, but instead for an actor who was familiar with pantomime and physical comedy, and Pasanen had made an impression on the choreographer George Gé at the audition. The ballet &quot;Don Quijote&quot; became a great success for the Finnish National Opera and Ballet in 1958. The production also visited Germany during the same year, which also became Pasanen&#x27;s first trip abroad in his life.

Mikko Niskanen&#x27;s film &quot;Hopeaa rajan takaa&quot; (1963) was an important point in Pasanen&#x27;s career: his first and only main role in a serious film, and his final role in a film produced by someone else. Despite the seriousness of the film, Pasanen played the part of Toivo Paukku, the most comical role in the film, always singing and longing after women. Since the late 1950s Pasanen started a career at the radio and television.

===Film director career===
Spede Pasanen and Jaakko Pakkasvirta met each other at the shooting of the film &quot;Hopeaa rajan takaa&quot;. Pakkasvirta and Risto Jarva, two young filmmakers, were part of the key personnel at the film production company Filminor owned by the student body of the Helsinki University of Technology. Their debut film &quot;Yö ja päivä&quot; (1962) had caused a great loss for the company. Jarva and Pakkasvirta made a contract with Pasanen about a new comedy film which could be a great success. According to the contract, Filminor would handle the technical aspects of the film, while Pasanen would get the financing, create the content and personally act in the main role. This resulted in the comedy &quot;X-Paroni&quot; (1964) which was the most successful film in Finland in the year of its debut.
The film&#x27;s success encouraged Pasanen to go into business for himself and thus he founded a company called Filmituotanto Spede Pasanen. He chose his old friend Jukka Virtanen and the young director Ere Kokkonen from Mainostelevisio as his business partners. The trio Pasanen-Virtanen-Kokkonen soon started producing a series of successful comedies including &quot;Millipilleri&quot; (1966), the parodical film celebrating the 50th anniversary of Finland&#x27;s independence &quot;Pähkähullu Suomi&quot; (1967), the Finnish version of Robin Hood &quot;About Seven Brothers&quot; (1968) and the television satire &quot;Näköradiomiehen ihmeelliset siekailut&quot; (1969). &quot;Millipilleri&quot; also introduced moviegoers to Simo Salminen who became a fixture of Spede&#x27;s acting troupe, often playing the side-kick to Spede&#x27;s own characters. It was also the first movie Spede co-directed with Jukka Virtanen and Ere Kokkonen who would alternate directing Spede&#x27;s future motion pictures, while Spede focused more on writing and producing. With his films in the 1960s Pasanen established himself as the most popular comedian in Finland.

The 1967 period-comedy &quot;About Seven Brothers&quot; was a parody of Robin Hood which Spede had worked on since the 1950s and introduced Vesa-Matti Loiri as an adult actor (having made his on-screen debut years earlier as a child actor in Pojat). The success of these movies led to Spede producing and releasing three movies in 1969, &quot;Näköradiomiehen ihmeelliset siekailut&quot;, &quot;Leikkikalugangsteri&quot; as well as his first colour feature &quot;Pohjan Tähteet&quot;. &quot;Näköradiomies&quot; performed well despite being a more serious movie but it and &quot;Pohjan Tähteet&quot; underperformed in comparison to the more typically comical &quot;Leikkikalugangsteri&quot;.

&quot;Pohjan Tähteet&quot; made a loss and was expensive to produce. Pasanen was in no hurry to switch to colour film, as he wanted his films to make as much money as possible. He kept making black-and-white films up to 1978.

Despite &quot;Pohjan Tähteet&quot; winning a shared Jussi Award for Kari Sohlberg in the category of best cinematography (with Spede&#x27;s own Leikkikalugangsteri and Jörn Donner&#x27;s Sixtynine 69), Pasanen did not produce another colour feature until the late 1970s.

Jukka Virtanen left the company after &quot;Näköradiomies&quot; but Ere Kokkonen became Pasanen&#x27;s closest business partner for the whole of his film career. At the same time Pasanen also found two men who became his trusted actors in both film and television: Simo Salminen who had already played a part in &quot;X-Paroni&quot; and Vesa-Matti Loiri whose debut was in &quot;About Seven Brothers&quot;.

Spede continued to experience success with &quot;Speedy Gonzales – noin 7 veljeksen poika&quot; and the tragic comedy &quot;Jussi Pussi&quot; both released in 1970. &quot;Speedy Gonzales&quot; performed well, despite Vesa-Matti Loiri being absent due to a leg injury just prior to shooting (he instead received a writing credit). Spede had to finance most of his films during this period due to his poor relations with the Finnish Film Foundation. &quot;Jussi Pussi&quot; was written and directed by Kokkonen, while Pasanen was responsible for the production but did not appear in the film and was not interested in the plot. The film is completely unlike Pasanen&#x27;s previous films, as it is more romantic and melancholic than Pasanen&#x27;s earlier screwball comedies. The film is about the great love between two penniless students during the political and sexual student radicalism of its time. The film gathered about 167 thousand viewers, which was enough to cover the production costs.

&quot;Speedy Gonzales&quot; was based on the themes of the American Old West, which had been a favourite of Pasanen already in his childhood. Pasanen found suitable shooting scenes at the sand pits in Hyrylä and on the sandy beaches of Yyteri. Pasanen himself played the role of the lead character Speedy Gonzales, the fastest gun in the west. One day the producers were shooting a scene where the sheriff played by Leo Jokela sneaks up behind Speedy Gonzales, sticks a gun on his back and the hero lifts his arms up. Then another villain points his revolver at the sheriff, and some other person points his at the villain. This results in a queue where about twenty men each point their gun at the man in front of him. Virtanen commented to Pasanen that they can&#x27;t make such a scene as the Marx Brothers had already done such a scene in their 1940 classic film &quot;Go West&quot;. Pasanen had never heard of this film. According to Virtanen, Pasanen did not need inspiration, as his ideas were entirely his own. The film was a financial success and made a profit of 45 thousand markka. Pasanen&#x27;s company managed to pay off its earlier losses, but at the same time, Pasanen and Kokkonen got into arguments for many years.

In 1971, Spede released three motion-pictures, &quot;Kahdeksas Veljes&quot; (his debut as a solo director) and &quot;Hirttämättömät&quot; (the sequel to &quot;Speedy Gonzales&quot;) both starring himself as well as &quot;Saatanan Radikaalit&quot;, which was co-directed by its four starring actors Paavo Piironen, Heikki Nousiainen, Timo Nissi and Heikki Huopainen, all fresh from the Helsinki Theatre Academy. Spede only produced this film which was intended to give its four stars a chance to complete a motion-picture on their own. All three films under-performed, with &quot;Saatanan Radikaalit&quot; being the financial all-time low of Pasanen&#x27;s career so far. This led to Spede taking a two-year hiatus from film-making during which he focused exclusively on his TV work. Regardless, Spede won the 1971 Producers&#x27; Jussi Award for all three films. Pasanen started planning a new colour film and to his surprise, he got a loan of 75 thousand markka from the Finnish Film Foundation. In the end, this film was left unfilmed, and another film that Pasanen had in mind was also left at planning stage. Pasanen ended up using the loan to cover the losses caused by &quot;Hirttämättömät&quot;.

In 1973, Spede released the first Uuno Turhapuro movie based on the popular skit-character by the same name. To save costs, Spede filmed and edited the movie entirely on video and had it transferred to film for theatrical distribution. Uuno became a hit and a further four Uuno films were finished during the 1970s. Spede resumed filming small budget comedies with 1974&#x27;s Viu-Hah-Hah-Taja, directed by Ere Kokkonen and mostly starring Spede&#x27;s TV actors. Spede only appeared in a cameo and went uncredited as the film&#x27;s writer. In 1979, he released Koeputkiaikuinen ja Simon enkelit, his first colour feature since Pohjantähteet. The movie was a surprise hit and led to a sequel Tup Akka Lakko being released the following year.

In the 1980s, the Uuno series peaked in popularity with 1984&#x27;s Uuno Turhapuro armeijan leivissä breaking the record of the most popular Finnish domestic film. Spede cranked out movies on an annual basis, using his stock actors and frequently utilizing the popular skit characters for movies such as Kliffaa Hei, Pikkupojat, Fakta Homma and Onks Viljoo Näkyny. The last of these skit-comedy films is considered to be 1990s Rampe &amp; Naukkis - Kaikkien aikojen superpari, which was lampooned on the popular characters created by Pirkka-Pekka Petelius and Aake Kalliala for the TV show Pulttibois.

During the 1990s, Spede focused almost exclusively on producing rather than writing or directing films with TV work taking more and more of his time. By this point his relationship with the Finnish Film Foundation had improved and he received grants for most of his films. The final movie directed by Pasanen was Naisen Logiikka, released in 1999 though production of it began in 1992. The film was hastily completed for release to prevent Pasanen from having to pay back his grant for the movie.

In his films, Pasanen never made fun of religion, his fatherland or politicians. He thought it was a matter of honour to make films for the whole family, and the films never showed any nudity or contained any profanity.

===TV career===

Pasanen&#x27;s television career started from visits in commercials for lottery tickets and beer, which brought out his talents as a comedian. However, the director of the advertisement studio that had filmed the commercials featuring him announced he could not stand the &quot;Spede style&quot;, so Pasanen made a suggestion to Mainostelevisio to make a program all of his own.

Starting from 1964, Pasanen began making live 15-minute sketch programming for Yleisradio produced by Mainos-TV, in addition to his film career. The first of these shows was called &quot;Spede Show&quot; (1964), followed by &quot;Speden Saluuna&quot; (1965), &quot;Spedevisio&quot; (1965 to 1970) and &quot;50 pientä minuuttia&quot; (1967 to 1971). Only parts of these early Pasanen shows have survived, because MTV3 could not afford many expensive picture tapes and thus had to record new shows on top of old ones.

The show which alternated between the titles Spedevisio, Speden Saluuna as well as Spede Show established many of the tropes and core actors whom Spede would use in his films. Most of the early skit work is now lost due to live broadcasts not being routinely recorded. Spede appeared on TV continuously until 1976 when he started to focus primarily on film work.
Starting from 1981, Spede once again put priority on TV work. First airing surviving black and white skits on YLE. He began making new skits in 1984 with Spede, Simo Salminen and Vesa-Matti Loiri. Hannele Lauri also joined as a regular cast-member. Mainos-TV also moved Spede&#x27;s programming to the newly formed Kolmoskanava channel. The new Spede Show continued to air until 1987 when Spede and Loiri had a mock-feud which led to the launch of Vesa-Matti Loiri&#x27;s own TV sketch show, Vesku Show. Throughout the 1980s, Spede also produced other programs such as the comedy program &quot;Fakta Homma&quot; and the competition show &quot;Kymppitonni&quot; with host Riitta Väisänen.

Pasanen wanted a trustworthy long-time partner for his sketches to perform comedy with. This actor had to be the opposite of the tall and sturdy Pasanen. Of the available short male actors, Pasanen contemplated Matti Kuusla, but he was already running his own entertainment company along with Jukka Virtanen and Aarre Elo. Leo Jokela had a tendency towards alcohol abuse which Pasanen despised. Pasanen ended up pairing himself with Simo Salminen, who was already a famous show jumper in the 1960s. Their cooperation started from the television and continued well up to the 1990s.

By the 1990s, Spede was himself tired of sketch-work but produced Aake Kalliala&#x27;s and Pirkka-Pekka Petelius&#x27;s Pulttibois and Tsa Tsa Tsaa as well as the sporty competition show Speden Spelit. Pasanen also produced more drama-programming such as &quot;Hynttyyt Yhteen&quot;, &quot;Blondi tuli taloon&quot; (&quot;The Blonde That Came to the House&quot;), and &quot;Ihmeiden tekijät&quot; (as well as its follow-up, &quot;Parhaat Vuodet&quot;). Many of these shows became stables of MTV3 with many of them airing for several seasons. Spede also approved the production of the dramedy-series &quot;Kuumia Aaltoja&quot;, which aired in 2003 (two years after his death).

Television brought a new dimension to Pasanen&#x27;s comedy, because he no longer had to make do with the aural acrobatics of the radio. Pasanen had a principle of defining the limits of good taste himself. The sketch shows were always made with the content first and without any definite overall view, and Pasanen seldom paid attention to the filming or other artistic viewpoints. &quot;Spede Show&quot; remained on television up to 1974.

===1970s===
Since the latter half of the 1960s Spede Pasanen made comedy films he had written himself under his own production company almost every year; often he would make two or three films during the same year. In front of the camera he took a minor role and made Vesa-Matti Loiri the star of the &quot;Uuno Turhapuro&quot; films. Only male actors performed comedy in Pasanen&#x27;s films. According to Marjatta Raita who played Uuno&#x27;s wife, Pasanen had the opinion that women were not allowed to be funny. Because of this, Pasanen thought of women either as beautiful decorations or as formidable battle-axes.

The character Uuno Turhapuro played by Loiri, who had already starred earlier in the &quot;Spede Show&quot; in 1971, soon became a popular sketch character. Pasanen invented the character and Loiri designed his make-up. Uuno has been called the lovechild of Pasanen and Loiri. The character appeared in about 20 sketches until Pasanen started thinking if there would be enough material for a film. He began making a script and managed to entice Ere Kokkonen back to his team. Kokkonen agreed mostly because the film was shot with multiple cameras and Loiri starred in the lead role. The film &quot;Uuno Turhapuro&quot; was shot in summer 1973 and became a huge success: over half a million viewers. The plot was multi-faceted and was essentially a collection of sketches. The Turhapuro films showed the debut of the character Härski Hartikainen invented and played by Pasanen, the character became one of his most famous roles.

Pasanen quit his ten-year-old TV show in 1974 after getting in an argument with the show director. He concentrated on his films and inventions instead. He thought of Loiri as professionally irreplaceable and would have wanted him to all of his projects, but Loiri had his own family and job in Turku to take care of. Pasanen contemplated taking a year off from making films, but instead decided to make a film about the new fashion of streaking with new stars. The film &quot;Viu-hah hah-taja&quot; was made in 1974 starring the comedians Seppo Laine and Jyrki Kovaleff, who had appeared earlier on the &quot;Spede Show&quot;. Pasanen did not intend to make a sequel to the Turhapuro film, but after its huge success, he reconsidered the possibility. The film &quot;Viu-hah hah-taja&quot; had made a considerable profit, but Pasanen did not see it as a full hit considering its content. Pasanen understood that the public was fond of the Turhapuro character, so from 1975 to 1978 he wrote and produced a new Turhapuro film every year, and they were huge successes each. The films were shot at a fast pace and production costs were kept low, and because of this the films are of poor technical quality.

After the fifth Turhapuro film the series was shelved for a while, as Pasanen and Kokkonen got into arguments behind the scenes. Pasanen distanced himself from the films and in 1979 he made a new film &quot;Koeputkiaikuinen ja Simon enkelit&quot; without Kokkonen as a director. In this film Pasanen put himself back in the lead role. The film was a parody of contemporary foreign news: the first test tube baby had been born in 1978 and the television show &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; was very popular at the time. The film gathered almost half a million viewers. Pasanen made a sequel for it in the same pattern called &quot;Tup-akka-lakko&quot;, inspired by Pasanen once again failing to quit smoking.

===1980s===
The film is my medium. I enjoy making films, if I feel they are needed.- Spede Pasanen in &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; in 1990

In 1981 Pasanen publicly expressed his frustration at the Finnish Film Foundation not granting financial support for his films despite his applications. As a concrete proof of this he threatened to destroy all the film negatives of his first three films. He even went as far as to invite a newspaper photographer to witness the fulfilment of his threat. &quot;Ilta-Sanomat&quot; wrote prominently about it right on the front page and in the article itself with a series of photographs, where Pasanen cut up a series of film reels into pieces with an axe at the floor of his storage room. A new scandal happened in September 1982 when Pasanen accused the Finnish Film Foundation of playing favourites. According to him, the foundation only granted support to those films whose producer was a member of the board at the foundation. Later it became apparent that when the photographer was present, Pasanen had only really destroyed a couple of ready-to-show film reels of his films while the original negatives had survived. This allowed Pasanen to add further drama to his one-man protest.

Both the Turhapuro films and all other produced entertainment was strictly only business to Pasanen, and he wanted to make a profit from them. Already in the 1970s his fortune was massive, and in 1983 he sold off his shares of his television and film companies to MTV. At that time, Spede-yhtiöt consisted of ten different limited companies, including Filmituotanto Spede Pasanen Oy, Amusement Films Oy and Funny Films Oy. Pasanen continued as the CEO of the new fusion company and wanted to hire Ere Kokkonen who had moved over to MTV as the chief of production. Kokkonen agreed on the condition that he would be allowed to write the scripts of any future Turhapuro films himself.

In 1982 Pasanen planned on restarting &quot;Spede Show&quot;, but Vesa-Matti Loiri&#x27;s problems with time prevented this. Two collective episodes of &quot;Spede Show&quot; were made in the spring of the same year, showing old black-and-white sketches and intermediary speeches by Pasanen, Simo Salminen and Vesa-Matti Loiri in colour. A new &quot;Spede Show&quot; in colour started in 1984, which became a favourite among both the public and the critics and also became a competitor for &quot;Velipuolikuu&quot; broadcast by Yleisradio. In the new &quot;Spede Show&quot; Pasanen once again assumed a minor role and put Vesa-Matti Loiri in the spotlight, allowing him to bring one of his most popular characters, Nasse-setä, into the show. The show received many television awards and Pasanen was also awarded the Telvis prize in 1985. In the late 1980s Pasanen also started producing programs that he did not appear in himself or otherwise have much of an effect on the content. Among the most popular of these sketch shows are &quot;Vesku Show&quot; (1988 to 1991) and &quot;Pulttibois&quot; (1989 to 1991).

The 1980s were a golden era for the Uuno Turhapuro films and they became the biggest commercial successes for Pasanen. A total of eight Turhapuro films were made from 1981 to 1988, of which five were written by Pasanen. Pasanen had to direct one of these films, &quot;Uuno Turhapuro – kaksoisagentti&quot;, all by himself after he had got into an argument with Kokkonen. As well as the Turhapuro films, Pasanen produced so-called &quot;secondary productions&quot; according to his contract with MTV. Among these were for example &quot;Lentävät luupäät&quot; (1984) and &quot;Liian iso keikka&quot; (1986). Many of these secondary productions were based on characters familiar from television shows. Among these were &quot;Hei kliffaa hei&quot; (1985), &quot;Pikkupojat&quot; (1986), &quot;Fakta homma&quot; (1987), &quot;Onks Viljoo näkynyt&quot; (1988) and &quot;Rampe &amp; Naukkis – kaikkien aikojen superpari&quot; (1990).

In 1986, a video game called &quot;Uuno Turhapuro muuttaa maalle&quot; for the Commodore 64 based on Pasanen&#x27;s film with the same name was published, programmed by Pasi Hytönen and published by Amersoft. This was the first video game based on a film licence of a Finnish film. The game sold about 2000 copies and was never published outside Finland. Although the game was made with an official licence from Spede Pasanen, Pasanen himself was not involved in the development.

===Games and quizzes===
Pasanen stopped producing &quot;Spede Show&quot; in December 1987 and instead started producing new shows about his lifelong passion: various games. Pasanen invented and designed one of the longest-lived quiz shows in the history of Finnish television, &quot;Kymppitonni&quot;, in 1984, when the pilot episodes of the show were shot. &quot;Kymppitonni&quot; was shown on MTV3 from January 1985 to November 2005, after which it has been shown on SuomiTV from 2009 to 2011.

===1990s===

The 1990s were a period of recession for Finnish films. In 1989 the Uuno Turhapuro films came close to being discontinued when Pasanen and the film theatre company Finnkino had a dispute about the splitting of income from ticket sales. Regardless of this, Pasanen kept on making a new Turhapuro film every year from 1990 to 1993. This time the Finnish Film Foundation also understood their financial value and granted Pasanen several million markka in support. After Kokkonen had resigned as a director of Turhapuro films Pasanen hired Hannu Seikkula and Pertti Melasniemi in his stead. The creators began to run out of ideas, which was evident from reusing old material. In the 1990s the Turhapuro films were no longer as big successes as earlier but each of them was still the most popular Finnish film at the time of its release.

Pasanen and Kokkonen resolved their disputes and the 1991 film &quot;Uuno Turhapuro - herra Helsingin herra&quot; and the 1992 film &quot;Uuno Turhapuro – Suomen tasavallan herra presidentti&quot; were once again made by the old gang. Kokkonen did not want to direct any Turhapuro films any more, so it fell on Pasanen to direct the new films. At this time he had started to lose his grip and make misjudgements. According to Loiri the last three films felt dull and he decided to have a break from the role of Uuno. Pasanen took a huge risk in making the film &quot;Uuno Turhapuron veli&quot; that did not feature Loiri at all and instead starred Esko Salminen as the lead male actor. The film was a complete flop just like the creators had expected, and so Pasanen decided that there would be no new Turhapuro films without Loiri.

In 1993 Pasanen began producing the drama comedy series &quot;Blondi tuli taloon&quot; (1994 to 1995) written by Elina Halttunen for MTV3, which was followed by the two hospital series &quot;Ihmeidentekijät&quot; (1996 to 1998) and &quot;Parhaat vuodet&quot; (2000 to 2002). In 1995 Pasanen caused a surprise with the &quot;Bingolotto&quot; game show he had produced for Yle TV1 also incorporating Veikkaus. In spring 1996 Pasanen wrote and produced 23 episodes of the &quot;Uuno Turhapuro&quot; series which fell short of its expectations. As well as these series Pasanen also produced &quot;Kymppitonni&quot; and &quot;Speden Spelit&quot; through the 1990s, which kept Pasanen as the nondisputed viewer rating king of MTV3.

Although Pasanen, Kokkonen and Loiri had made a common decision not to make any new Turhapuro films, this decision had already been overturned in 1998. The film &quot;Johtaja Uuno Turhapuro - pisnismies&quot; was named the 25th anniversary film of the series. It was produced as a joint operation between Pasanen&#x27;s and Kokkonen&#x27;s own production companies. This was the last Turhapuro film to be made during Pasanen&#x27;s lifetime.

The last Spede film &quot;Naisen logiikka&quot; was made in 1999. Production had started already in 1991 but was cut off many times. In 1998 Pasanen was forced to finish the film off to avoid having to pay his support grant back to the Finnish Film Foundation. The film was a total failure and was only shown at one theatre in Helsinki for two weeks. Pasanen said at the time that &quot;Naisen logiikka&quot; will come to the theatre but no one was allowed to go see it.

===2000s===
After the turn of the millennium, Pasanen did not produce any films any more, even though he still had plans for new sketch comedy shows. The threshold to start producing them again was too high after Pasanen had already begun to lose his confidence. On television he continued hosting &quot;Speden Spelit&quot; every week. &quot;Kymppitonni&quot; and the new show &quot;Parhaat vuodet&quot; (2000 to 2002) continuing after &quot;Ihmeidentekijät&quot; were still being produced. The last episode of &quot;Speden Spelit&quot; hosted by Pasanen himself was shown on television on 6 September 2001, one day before Pasanen&#x27;s death.

Before his death Pasanen made a decision to produce the television series &quot;Kuumia aaltoja&quot; written by Anna-Leena Härkönen, which was made in 2003. Pasanen was also planning a new television series about inventions, but this never went to production.

==Influences and comedy==
Spede Pasanen named Bob Hope as one of his biggest comedy influences.

Spede Pasanen is considered emblematic of Savonian ironic humor varying between the fullest extremes of understatement and hyperbole. As he himself explained: &quot;A Savonian never tells a thing exactly like it is.&quot; Spede&#x27;s comedy denounced elitism and he explicitly sought to write and perform comedy for the largest possible audience. His early films in particular, featured elements uncommon to Finnish cinema such as fist-fights, car chases, other elaborate stunt-work as well as unconventional special effects. Many of his movies also featured unconventional settings (such as the medieval period or the wild west), though his later films focused almost entirely on poking fun at Finnish stereotypes.

His Uuno Turhapuro movies can be considered conventional farces. An unemployed slacker will, with comically incredible luck, a father-in-law who is rich and connected but unlucky (mainly due to Uuno), and with slick charm, end up in roles of minister, general officer, or rich man, usually causing havoc in the father-in-law&#x27;s businesses.

==Other achievements==

Pasanen was also an inventor and jack-of-all-trades; he submitted dozens of patent applications, of which ten were registered, and many of his films include Rube Goldberg-style gadgets. Besides gadgets involved with industrial production, his inventions include:

*The Ski jumping sling
*A Boat ski (to alleviate *bumps* in aquaplaning boat)
*A self-extinguishing, one-size-fits-all candlestick.

For a period of time Pasanen was also obsessed with inventing a perpetual motion device. His crude drawings of it also appeared in his sketches shows and films. Once he became convinced that perpetual motion is theoretically impossible, he openly ridiculed himself in the character of &quot;Härski Hartikainen&quot; in one of the Uuno Turhapuro movies.

==Personal life==
&quot;Spede saved Simo when Simo was badly cheated in the restaurant business. This was the level of Pasanen&#x27;s friendship: you save your buddy, even if you lose your own money.&quot; - Kari Sohlberg

===Family and close friends===
Pasanen was related to singer Kaija Koo (daughter of Pasanen&#x27;s cousin) and to actor Antti Holma (son of Pasanen&#x27;s second cousin). Actor Veijo Pasanen was Pasanen&#x27;s distant relative, a seventh cousin.

Spede Pasanen lived in the Lauttasaari district of Helsinki from 1956 up to his death in 2001.

When Pasanen was starting the production of his first starring picture &quot;X-Paroni&quot;, he was looking for a suitable female actress. He visited a party of the advertisement association of Turku in March 1964 and fell in love with Pirjo Vainimäki who was selling lottery tickets there. Vainimäki got a part in Spede&#x27;s first film of his own and in the next year she became Mrs. Pasanen - they were married on 14 July 1965. On 31 December 1965 the couple&#x27;s daughter Pirre Päivikki was born. In the late 1970s the couple started drifting apart and Pirjo Pasanen moved to an apartment of her own in Lauttasaari. She told in an interview by &quot;Apu&quot; magazine in 1981 that their marriage was still ongoing even though she and Pertti lived at different addresses. Pirre Pasanen stayed living with her father. The Pasanens divorced officially after many years.

Pasanen had an eye for feminine beauty and he often dated beauty pageants. In the early 1960s he had brief romances with Anja Mustamäki chosen as Paulig&#x27;s new &quot;Paula Girl&quot; and with the Yleisradio filming secretary Arja Laine, who later married actor Tommi Rinne.

A family private individual, Pasanen did not discuss his personal relationships in public. He had a long relationship with the 1976 Miss Europe, Riitta Väisänen. They met through Jukka Virtanen, who had been on a trip organised by the Zoom sports club together with Väisänen. Pasanen got Väisänen a part in his next film &quot;Lentävät luupäät&quot; (1984) and planned a television quiz show for her own called &quot;Kymppitonni&quot; (1985 - 2005 and 2009 - 2011). Pasanen and Väisänen appeared in many &quot;celebrity parties&quot; together for many years. Their relationship was an open secret for many years, until Väisänen admitted to their relationship after Spede&#x27;s death. The relationship ended in the early 1980s when Väisänen started dating Karl Erik Mäkkylä.

Pasanen valued loyalty and friendship, and even after separation, kept employing and financially supporting previous companions. During and after relationships, he vouchsafed confidentiality and privacy for all involved in his private life. His good relations with the media might have helped with this.

In 1997, Pasanen appointed the 1997 Miss Finland runner-up Maria Drockila as the CEO of his companies. The appointment of Drockila, only 19 years old at the time, to lead an empire of companies with a total revenue of 27 million Finnish markka in 1996, caused a huge controversy. Although Drockila came from an entrepreneur family, she had no commercial training at all. In an interview with &quot;Apu&quot; magazine in 1997 Pasanen said he had faith in his protegée. He wanted to make Drockila a figurehead for his companies, but in reality he still held control over them himself from the background. The paparazzi followed them, and at the same time gossip magazines reported Pasanen and Drockila were dating. Pasanen had a few arguments with some of the journalists, which they felt were threatening. Already in the 1970 Pasanen disowned the magazine publisher Urpo Lahtinen, and after that Pasanen&#x27;s name was never mentioned in &quot;Hymy&quot; magazine any more.

In the early 1960s Pasanen became acquainted with Simo Salminen who had become famous as a clown jumper. Salminen became Pasanen&#x27;s trusted actor and a comedic partner for his television shows. Salminen and Pasanen remained close friends in private life and were also partly business partners. On the other hand, neither Ere Kokkonen or Vesa-Matti Loiri were part of Pasanen&#x27;s close friends, and in his last years he hadn&#x27;t had anything to do with Salminen either. For the most part, the relationship between Pasanen and Loiri had been strictly collegial, but they started becoming close friends shortly before Pasanen&#x27;s death.

In the 1960s and 1970s Pasanen spent a lot of time at his cabin at the Pallastunturi fell in Muonio, which he had named Mesopotamia. In the 1960s Salminen and Pasanen founded a few restaurants and other places for entertainment, of which the most famous were Simon Rysä in Lappeenranta, Raikulimaa in Lemi and Speden Saluuna in Kouvola. At the time, Pasanen became the victim of fraud, when his business partner Timo T. Kaukonen abused mortage payments and disappeared into Spain. Pasanen&#x27;s restaurants went bankrupt one after another, but he only gave up ownership of Speden Saluuna in 1971.

===Other private life===
In the 1960s Spede Pasanen got in a car accident, where he was unscathed except a bad-looking scar in his chin. To cover it he grew a beard, which became a permanent trademark for him. In summertime, Pasanen did not want to leave Finland, but since the late 1970s he started spending wintertime in Florida, where he acquired two apartments for his free time. In Florida Pasanen became interested in golf, which he became so enthusiastic about that it replaced many of his other hobbies at the time.

According to Spede Pasanen&#x27;s close friends, the mirror side of his jolly nature was his aggression towards journalists, who published stories and pictures of Pasanen or his friends without his permission. In these cases, Pasanen got more angry about his friends than about himself. One of the targets of his aggression was Isto Lysmä, the editor of &quot;Nyrkkiposti&quot;, who published a fake story about a relationship between Pasanen&#x27;s trusted actor Ville-Veikko Salminen and 1968 Miss Finland Leena Brusiin. Pasanen demanded that Lysmä write a correction, threatening him with the revenge of the group &quot;Musta käsi&quot; (Finnish for &quot;Black Hand&quot;) that he had founded. The name is a reference to the secret society of the same name active in Serbia in the 1910s, whose member Gavrilo Princip had shot the archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in June 1914 and thus indirectly caused the outbreak of World War I. The outcome of the case was that neither Pasanen or any of his close friends were ever mentioned again in &quot;Nyrkkiposti&quot;. Pasanen made a similar threat to Urpo Lahtinen, at which point the temperamental Lahtinen drew a &quot;puukko&quot; knife from his pocket and struck its point into the table in front of Pasanen.

Pasanen got into a scandal in autumn 1986 when the police suspected that about two hundred Finns had taken Finnish currency abroad to the United States illegally in order to buy an apartment or to engage in business. When buying free time apartments in Florida in 1979 Pasanen had taken 12 thousand US dollars and 4 thousand Finnish markka to the United States. According to him, he was arrested for eight days because of the case. The case went into court in spring 1987. For most of the accused, including Pasanen, the charges were dropped, because the suspected crime had expired and at the point of time of the investigation, the suspected act was no longer illegal in the first place.

One of Pasanen&#x27;s hobbies was backgammon which he did well at on an international level. He became the Finnish champion in backgammon in 1979. In 1976 he got elected as the director of the Finnish Backgammon Society. Pasanen also took part in international backgammon tournaments in West Germany, Spain and the United States. Pasanen was also a member of Mensa International. In 1998 Mensa International awarded its annual prize to Pasanen.

Pasanen has been described as having been very different in his private life than the Spede known publicly. He was quick to get angry and calm down, preferred to keep to himself and was social only with people he knew closely. Pasanen felt disgust towards alcoholic beverages and drunken people. In his youth he was a teetotaller, but later started consuming alcohol in moderation. He had a lifetime habit of smoking, which he started in 1958 when he got a role in the ballet &quot;Don Quijote&quot;.

==Death==

Pasanen turned 70 in 2000. His circle of family and friends had already noticed his weakening condition. He had previously been sportsmanlike, but also chainsmoked cigarettes and drank about four litres of full-fat milk every day. Pasanen was aware of his weak condition, so he decided to sell off his entire entertainment empire and only concentrate on the things he felt were most important for himself: golf and new inventions. Despite advice from his friends, Pasanen refused to see a doctor. Pasanen signed the last documents about the sale of his Spede-Yhtiöt companies on the morning of 7 September 2001, mere hours before his death.

On 7 September 2001 Pasanen was playing a round of golf at the Sarfvik golf course in Kirkkonummi, Finland. In the middle of the course, his golf mates noticed he was feeling unwell and was tired. At the 9th hole he began to feel ill and was taken to the outdoor terrace of the café of the club house, where his condition rapidly deteriorated. Pasanen lay down on the couch at the lobby of the club house, where he suffered a cardiac arrest. Despite resuscitation by a doctor who happened to be at the scene and a rapid response of emergency medical services Pasanen died. His death was attributed to advanced coronary artery disease.

Pasanen is buried at the &quot;Artists&#x27; Hill&quot; at the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki.

===Legacy===
Spede Pasanen died very wealthy, and his daughter Pirre Alanen inherited almost the entirety of her father&#x27;s wealth of about 10 million euro. Pasanen left 170 thousand euro to his ex-wife Pirjo. From 1998 to 1999, Pasanen had lent Maria Drockila a total sum of 1.85 million markka for a period of 30 years without interest. According to Pasanen&#x27;s will on 26 July 2000 Drockila&#x27;s debts were forgiven so that they are annulled and finally expired and the inheritance tax resulting from the annullation is paid from the funds of the estate. Alanen and Drockila had an argument about paying the inheritance tax and about the sum of 220 thousand markka that Pasanen lent Drockila after making his will. They resolved their arguments before the matter went to court.

===After death===
After Pasanen&#x27;s death almost all of films have been published on DVD (and in the beginning also on VHS). The television channel MTV3 has shown Pasanen&#x27;s films on television. From 2005 to 2008 almost all surviving episodes of the sketch comedy &quot;Spede Show&quot; were published on DVD. The last episode of 1987 was not published. In 2002, EMI published all surviving radio sketches of &quot;Papukaija G. Pula-aho&quot; played by Pasanen and Leo Jokela on CD (the title of the CD was &quot;Pure nenääs!&quot; (&quot;Bite your nose&quot;)), which remained at the Finnish official list for a total of 20 weeks, of which five weeks at the top spot. The last Uuno Turhapuro film, &quot;Uuno Turhapuro – This Is My Life&quot;, was made in 2004 in memory of Pasanen.

After Pasanen&#x27;s death, Saija Hakola replaced him as the host of &quot;Speden Spelit&quot;, having acted as his back-up already in a few earlier episodes. A twist of fate was that the first episode of &quot;Speden Spelit&quot; after Pasanen&#x27;s death was shot on 11 September 2001, when the producers had the time to see one of the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City collapse on live television. The show &quot;Speden Spelit&quot; was originally planned to end at the end of 2001, but after Saija Hakola was well received by the audience, it was continued by one year. The last episode was broadcast on 27 December 2002. The show &quot;Kymppitonni&quot; hosted by Riitta Väisänen, which still had over 400 thousand viewers per week, stayed on the screen longer, up to autumn 2005. In 2009, the short-lived channel SuomiTV took it into its programming for a few years, after which Spede Pasanen&#x27;s name disappeared from the credits of Finnish television programmes forever. There were remakes of the programme since 2012.

A concert was held in memory of Pasanen on 1 November 2001. Performers appearing at the concert included Vesa-Matti Loiri, Jari Sillanpää, Linda Lampenius, Danny, Samuli Edelmann and Paula Koivuniemi. The city of Kuopio founded an inventors&#x27; competition named after Pasanen after his death. This competition was held up to 2012.

A play about Pasanen&#x27;s life, concentrating on his youth, was made at the Kuopio summer theatre in 2018. The play was directed by Ismo Apeli.

In Pasanen&#x27;s honour, a beer named Härski &amp; Sörsselson after Pasanen and Simo Salminen was made in 2017. The beer can shows the pictures of Pasanen&#x27;s and Salminen&#x27;s characters and the beer was brewed by the Saku Brewery in Estonia.

Pasanen appeared as one of the characters in the board game &quot;Steampunk Rally Fusion&quot; by the Canadian game publisher Roxley Games Laboratory in spring 2020.

A biographical film was made about Pasanen&#x27;s life, called &quot;Spede&quot; directed by Aleksi Delikouras, based on Tuomas Marjamäki&#x27;s 2017 book &quot;Spede, nimittäin&quot; and the 2021 book &quot;Uuno on numero yksi - Turhapuron koko tarina&quot;. The film stars Riku Nieminen as Spede Pasanen and it was premiered in autumn 2023.

===2022 revelations===
In 2022, famous Finnish businesswoman and former TV host Lenita Airisto accused Pasanen of having attempted to rape her in the early 1990s. Hannele Lauri and Riitta Väisänen, who had been working closely with Pasanen for years, said they were completely surprised with Airisto&#x27;s statement.

Reporter Katariina Souri reported of similar behaviour in a Facebook post. The model Marita Hakala commented on the news: &quot;I would have sufficed on my own, and I was not offered a job via the bed - except in Finland. With that, I was referring to Spede.&quot;

Former MTV manager and director Jorma Sairanen also confirmed that Airisto&#x27;s and Souri&#x27;s allegations were not a surprise to him due to Pasanen&#x27;s importance and status at the network. Sairanen had told about the matter himself in his 2017 memoirs.

== Criticism ==
Since the 1960s, critics were particularly harsh towards Pasanen&#x27;s films. The criticism was mainly targeted towards the shallow nature of the scripts. The critics thought the films mostly seemed like sketch comedies without a supporting plot. According to Veijo Hietala, the critics missed the fact that Pasanen was carrying on the tradition of farce that had started already in the period of silent films, where the plot is only secondary and mostly serves to create a background for slapstick humour and individual comedic scenes.

In the 1970s, the critics were clearly against Pasanen&#x27;s entertainment. The Uuno Turhapuro films were seen as spreading wrong attitudes and as tasteless standard products preventing the use of thought and recognition. These criticisms were not only directed towards the content of the films, but also towards the use of cinema, which the critics thought was as shabby as Uuno himself. The criticism grew even harsher as the films themselves grew more popular.

According to Ere Kokkonen, Pasanen&#x27;s movies were not always reviewed fairly. Sometimes the films even received negative criticism before they had been shown in the first place. Sakari Toiviainen once wrote that he had not seen the new Spede Pasanen film yet, but it must be a bad one.

Pasanen usually ignored criticism towards him, but in a way he got back to his criticisers. In 1981 he put an announcement in &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; promising a reward for killing critic Mikael Fränti who had given a negative review of &quot;Uuno Turhapuron aviokriisi&quot;.

<text>Antonio Franz Theus &quot;Tonio&quot; Selmair-Selwart (June 9, 1896 – November 2, 2002) was a German actor and stage performer.

==Biography==

Selwart was born in Wartenberg, Bavaria, Germany, and raised in Munich. After studying medicine like his father (a well known surgeon), he decided instead to become an actor, following a lifelong interest in theater. Selwart thereafter studied acting and appeared in many plays throughout Europe. He appeared in a variety of stage productions, including classics such as Shakespeare and modern popular works like Heinrich von Kleist&#x27;s romantic dream play, &quot;The Prince of Homburg&quot;, in which he played the title role.

After further honing his skills as a director, Selwart decided to try his luck in the United States of America. His luck panned out in New York City, where he landed the lead part in Lawrence Langner&#x27;s and Armina Marshall&#x27;s play &quot;The Pursuit of Happiness&quot; for the Theatre Guild in 1930. The comedy proved to be his first big success in America, running from 1933 to 1934, and made him, as he often put it, &quot;a matinee idol for a whole year!&quot; Riding high on this success, Selwart decided to emigrate permanently and became an American citizen. Selwart was himself an officer and fought in World War I on the Austro-Hungarian side, as a lieutenant in the cavalry.

He derived his nickname &quot;Tonio&quot; from his first name and from his family background – his parents were Austrian, and he had an Italian grandmother. He was familiar with the novella &quot;Tonio Kröger&quot;, which dealt with a half-German, half-Italian young artist in pre-World War I Germany and was written by Thomas Mann (a friend of his) and had a tape recording of the story being read by Mann himself. His wife, Claire Volkhart, a painter and sculptor, died in Germany in 1935 and his longtime companion, Ilse Jennings, a Paris-born Spanish artist, died in 1967. He died at the age of 106 in New York City on November 2, 2002.

==Acting career==

===Film===
Selwart made a total of 21 film appearances. His debut was in Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Hangmen Also Die!&quot; (1943), as a Nazi Gestapo chief. In &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot; (1954),he appeared as the Pretender King, with Ava Gardner and Humphrey Bogart. His last film appearance, &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot; for Orson Welles, was left unreleased for decades. According to Welles in a letter to Selwart, it contains an excellent performance by this actor as the Baron. Selwart was much concerned that this &quot;swan song&quot; of his had never been released and even in 1992, at the age of 96, regretted that he would probably never see it. This was not only because of his age but because of his gradual loss of sight. The film was finally released in 2018, 16 years after Selwart&#x27;s death.

Other titles include: &quot;Anzio&quot; (1968) by Edward Dmytryk, his last Hollywood film appearance; &quot;The North Star&quot; (1943), directed by Lewis Milestone with a script by playwright Lillian Hellman, with Erich von Stroheim; &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; (1943), also by Milestone, his first film role, where he played his first film German soldier role, opposite Judith Anderson; &quot;Wilson&quot; (1944), where he played the German ambassador to Washington, D.C. during World War I, Count von Bernstorff; &quot;The Cross of Lorraine&quot; (1943), with Gene Kelly; &quot;The Hitler Gang&quot; (1944), playing the Nazi official Alfred Rosenberg and &quot;Romanoff and Juliet&quot; (1961), written, directed and starring Peter Ustinov, and an Italian-American adaptation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad,&quot; &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; (1956), directed by Robert Wise, with Rossanna Podesta, Jacques Sernas, and in two featured roles, Selwart played opposite a then almost unknown Brigitte Bardot, in 1956.

While he played only supporting roles in English-language cinema, Selwart starred in Italian and French films, including &quot;Lupo della Frontiere&quot; (&quot;Wolf of the Frontier&quot;, 1951), during the 1950s; he never appeared in a German film. He also made a brief speaking part appearance in Luchino Visconti&#x27;s Italian film &quot;Senso&quot; (1954), at the beginning opera house scene, as an Austrian officer. He spoke fluent Italian, English and French, which helped him with roles in several countries. Starting from the late 1940s until the 1950s and 1960s, he also appeared on American television, making guest appearances in drama programs, including &quot;The Fifth Column&quot; for &quot;Buick-Electra Playhouse&quot; on CBS in 1960, playing an almost-deaf Nazi officer in a group of fifth columnists operating behind the lines in Madrid during the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s (the program was adapted from a story by Ernest Hemingway and directed by John Frankenheimer).

===Stage===
Selwart appeared on stage around the country (including Broadway) and in Canada. His performances included: &quot;The Pursuit of Happiness&quot; (touring with it across the U.S. and England), &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; by Maxwell Anderson with Helen Hayes (where he played his first German Nazi officer role, a type of character he came to specialize in), &quot;The Laughing Woman&quot; with Helen Menken, &quot;Autumn Crocus&quot;, &quot;Seeds in the Wind&quot;, &quot;Liliom&quot; by Ferenc Molnár (in which Selwart played the title role), and &quot;The Hidden River&quot; in 1957, among many others.

Selwart&#x27;s last American stage appearances were with the Lotte Lenya in the 1964 tour of &quot;Brecht on Brecht&quot; and in the 1965 Carnegie Hall performance of &quot;Die Dreigroschenoper&quot; (&quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;). He studied at the Actors Studio in New York and with Michael Chekhov in California. Selwart had referred to Chekov as &quot;My best teacher in America.&quot; As a member of Eva Le Gallienne&#x27;s Civic Repertory he appeared in &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, and Frank Wedekind&#x27;s &quot;Spring&#x27;s Awakening&quot;—a tragedy about adolescence which he also directed. Writer and poet May Sarton appeared in this production—one of her earliest stage roles.

In 1995, now legally blind, Selwart was interviewed by William F. Powers for his book, &quot;Alive and Well: The Emergence of the Active Nonagenarian&quot; (Rutledge Books, 1996). In the interview, Selwart reflected: &quot;If I died today, I could say only that I had lived a very beautiful and charmed life. Even when it looked at times like something bad had happened, it soon turned back again to something positive. The loss of my eyesight, although difficult, did not make me bitter. I figured that at my age I have to expect something and remembered all those poor people who suffer from cancer and are in terrible pain. I say to myself that I may have trouble seeing, but I don&#x27;t suffer any physical, mental, or emotional pain.&quot;

<doc id="210684" wikidata="Q123041" url="?curid=210684" title="Germaine de Staël">
<text>Anne Louise Germaine de Staël-Holstein (; ; 22 April 176614 July 1817), commonly known as Madame de Staël (), was a prominent philosopher, woman of letters, and political theorist in both Parisian and Genevan intellectual circles. She was the daughter of banker and French finance minister Jacques Necker and Suzanne Curchod, a respected salonist and writer. Throughout her life, she held a moderate stance during the tumultuous periods of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era, persisting until the time of the French Restoration.

Her presence at critical events such as the Estates General of 1789 and the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen underscored her engagement in the political discourse of her time. However, Madame de Staël faced exile for extended periods: initially during the Reign of Terror and subsequently due to personal persecution by Napoleon. She claimed to have discerned the tyrannical nature and ambitions of his rule ahead of many others.

During her exile, she fostered the Coppet group, a network that spanned across Europe, positioning herself at its heart. Her literary works, emphasizing individuality and passion, left an enduring imprint on European intellectual thought. De Staël&#x27;s repeated championing of Romanticism contributed significantly to its widespread recognition.

While her literary legacy has somewhat faded with time, her critical and historical contributions hold undeniable significance. Though her novels and plays may now be less remembered, the value of her analytical and historical writings remains steadfast. Within her work, de Staël not only advocates for the necessity of public expression but also sounds cautionary notes about its potential hazards.

==Childhood==
Germaine (or &quot;Minette&quot;) was the only child of the Swiss governess Suzanne Curchod, who had an aptitude for mathematics and science, and prominent Genevan banker and statesman Jacques Necker. Jacques was the son of Karl Friedrich Necker from Brandenburg (Holy Roman Empire), himself a lawyer and professor. Jacques became the Director-General of Finance under King Louis XVI of France. Mme Staël would later host one of the most popular salons in Paris in Rue de la Chaussée-d&#x27;Antin. Mme Necker wanted her daughter educated according to the principles of the Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau; Germaine&#x27;s father instilled in her intellectual rigor and Calvinist discipline. On Fridays, Mme Necker regularly brought Germaine to sit at her feet in the salon. Even at a young age, Germaine engaged in stimulating conversations with her mother&#x27;s guests. Celebrities such as the Comte de Buffon, Jean-François Marmontel, Melchior Grimm, Edward Gibbon, the Abbé Raynal, Jean-François de la Harpe, Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, Denis Diderot, and Jean d&#x27;Alembert were frequent visitors. At the age of 13, she read Montesquieu, Shakespeare, Rousseau and Dante. Her parents&#x27; social life led to a somewhat neglected and wild Germaine, unwilling to bow to her mother&#x27;s demands.

Her father &quot;is remembered today for taking the unprecedented step in 1781 of making public the country&#x27;s budget, a novelty in an absolute monarchy where the state of the national finances had always been kept secret, leading to his dismissal by the King in May of that year.&quot; The family eventually took up residence in 1784 at Château Coppet, an estate on Lake Geneva. The family returned to the Paris region in 1785.

==Marriage==

Aged 11, Germaine had suggested to her mother that she marry Edward Gibbon, a visitor to her salon, whom she found most attractive. Then, she reasoned, he would always be around for her. In 1783, at seventeen, she was courted by William Pitt the Younger and by Comte de Guibert, whose conversation, she thought, was the most far-ranging, spirited and fertile she had ever known. When she did not accept their offers Germaine&#x27;s parents became impatient. With the help of Marie-Charlotte Hippolyte de Boufflers, a marriage was arranged with Baron Erik Magnus Staël von Holstein, a Protestant and attaché of the Swedish legation to France. The wedding took place on 14 January 1786 in the Swedish embassy at 97, Rue du Bac; Germaine was 19, and her husband 37. On the whole, the marriage seems to have been workable for both parties, although neither seems to have had much affection for the other. Madame de Staël continued to write miscellaneous works, including the three-act romantic drama &quot;Sophie&quot; (1786) and the five-act tragedy &quot;Jeanne Grey&quot; (1787). The baron, also a gambler, obtained great benefits from the match as he received 80,000 pounds and was confirmed as lifetime ambassador to Paris.

==Revolutionary activities==

In 1788, de Staël published &quot;Letters on the works and character of J.J. Rousseau&quot;. De Staël was at this time enthusiastic about the mixture of Rousseau&#x27;s ideas about love and Montesquieu&#x27;s on politics.

In December 1788 her father persuaded Louis XVI to double the number of deputies at the Third Estate in order to gain enough support to raise taxes to pay for the excessive costs of supporting the revolutionaries in America. This approach had serious repercussions on Necker&#x27;s reputation; he appeared to consider the Estates-General as a facility designed to help the administration rather than to reform the government. In an argument with the king, whose speech on 23 June he did not attend, Necker was dismissed and exiled on 11 July. Her parents left France on the same day in unpopularity and disgrace. On Sunday, 12 July the news became public, and an angry Camille Desmoulins suggested storming the Bastille. On 16 July he was reappointed; Necker entered Versailles in triumph. His efforts to clean up public finances were unsuccessful and his idea of a National Bank failed. Necker was attacked by Jean-Paul Marat and Count Mirabeau in the Constituante, when he did not agree with using assignats as legal tender. He resigned on 4 September 1790. Accompanied by their son-in-law, Necker and his wife left for Switzerland, without the two million livres, half of his fortune, that he had loaned as an investment in the public treasury in 1778.

The increasing disturbances caused by the Revolution made her privileges as the consort of an ambassador an important safeguard. Germaine held a salon in the Swedish embassy, where she gave &quot;coalition dinners&quot;, which were frequented by moderates such as Talleyrand and De Narbonne, monarchists (Feuillants) such as Antoine Barnave, Charles Lameth and his brothers Alexandre and Théodore, the Comte de Clermont-Tonnerre, Pierre Victor, baron Malouet, the poet Abbé Delille, Thomas Jefferson, the one-legged Minister Plenipotentiary to France Gouverneur Morris, Paul Barras (from the Plain) and the Girondin Condorcet.

During this time of her political thoughts, de Staël was focused on the problem of leadership, or the perceived lack of it. In her later works she often returned to the idea that &quot;the French Revolution has been characterized by a surprising absence of eminent personalities&quot;. She experienced the death of Mirabeau, accused of royalism, as a sign of great political disorientation and uncertainty.

Following the 1791 French legislative election, and after the French Constitution of 1791 was announced in the National Assembly, she resigned from a political career and decided not to stand for re-election. &quot;Fine arts and letters will occupy my leisure.&quot; She did, however, play an important role in the succession of Comte de Montmorin the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and in the appointment of Narbonne as minister of War and continued to be centre stage behind the scenes. Marie Antoinette wrote to Hans Axel Fersen: &quot;Count Louis de Narbonne is finally Minister of War, since yesterday; what a glory for Mme de Staël and what a joy for her to have the whole army, all to herself.&quot;
In 1792 the French Legislative Assembly saw an unprecedented turnover of ministers, six ministers of the interior, seven ministers of foreign affairs, and nine ministers of war. On 10 August 1792 Clermont-Tonnere was thrown out of a window of the Louvre Palace and trampled to death. De Staël offered baron Malouet a plan of escape for the royal family to Dieppe. On 20 August De Narbonne arrived in England on a German passport. As there was no government, militant members of the Insurrectionary Commune were given extensive police powers from the provisional, executive council, &quot; to detain, interrogate and incarcerate suspects without anything resembling due process of law&quot;. She helped De Narbonne, dismissed for plotting, to hide under the altar in the chapel in the Swedish embassy, and lectured the sans-culottes from the section in the hall.

On Sunday 2 September, the day the Elections for the National Convention and the September massacres began, she fled herself in the garb of an ambassadress. Her carriage was stopped and the crowd forced her into the Paris town hall, where Robespierre presided. That same evening she was conveyed home, escorted by the procurator Louis Pierre Manuel. The next day the commissioner to the Commune of Paris Jean-Lambert Tallien arrived with a new passport and accompanied her to the edge of the barricade.

==Salons at Coppet and Paris==
After her flight from Paris, de Staël moved to Rolle in Switzerland, where Albert was born. She was supported by de Montmorency and the Marquis de Jaucourt, whom she had previously supplied with Swedish passports. In January 1793, she made a four-month visit to England to be with her then-lover, the Comte de Narbonne, at Juniper Hall. (Since 1 February, France and Great Britain had been at war.) Within a few weeks, she was pregnant; it was apparently one of the reasons for the scandal she caused in England. According to Fanny Burney, the result was that her father urged Fanny to avoid the company of de Staël and her circle of French Émigrés in Surrey. De Staël met Horace Walpole, James Mackintosh, Lord Sheffield, a friend of Edward Gibbon, and Lord Loughborough, the new Lord Chancellor. She was not impressed with the condition of women in English society, finding that they were not afforded the voice and respect they deserved. Staël viewed freedom as twofold: political freedom from institutions and individual freedom from social norms.

In the summer of 1793, de Staël returned to Switzerland, probably because De Narbonne had cooled towards her. She published a defence of the character of Marie Antoinette, entitled, &quot;Réflexions sur le procès de la Reine&quot;, 1793 (&quot;Reflections on the Queen&#x27;s trial&quot;). In de Staël&#x27;s view, France should have adapted from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy as was the case in England. Living in Jouxtens-Mézery, farther away from the French border than Coppet, Germaine was visited by Adolph Ribbing. Count Ribbing was living in exile, after his conviction for taking part in a conspiracy to assassinate the Swedish king, Gustav III. In September 1794, the recently divorced Benjamin Constant visited her, wanting to meet her before he committed suicide.

In May 1795, de Staël moved to Paris, now with Constant in tow, as her protégé and lover. De Staël rejected the idea of the right of resistance – which had been introduced into the never implemented French Constitution of 1793, and was removed from the Constitution of 1795. In 1796, she published &quot;Sur l&#x27;influence des passions&quot;, in which she praised suicide and discussed how passions affect the happiness of individuals and societies, a book which attracted the attention of the German writers Schiller and Goethe. 

Still absorbed by French politics, de Staël reopened her salon. It was during these years that Mme de Staël arguably exerted most political influence. For a time she was still visible in the diverse and eccentric society of the mid-1790s. However, on the 13 Vendémiaire the &quot;Comité de salut public&quot; ordered her to leave Paris after accusations of politicking, and put Constant in detention for one night. De Staël spent that autumn in the spa of Forges-les-Eaux. She was considered a threat to political stability and mistrusted by both sides in the political conflict. She corresponded with Franciso de Miranda whom she wished to see again. The couple moved to Ormesson-sur-Marne where they stayed with Mathieu Montmorency. In Summer 1796 Constant founded the &quot;Cercle constitutionnel&quot; in Luzarches with de Staël&#x27;s support. In May 1797, she was back in Paris and eight months pregnant. She organized the Club du Salm in Hôtel de Salm. De Stael succeeded in getting Talleyrand from the list of Émigrés and on his return from the United States to have him appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in July. From the coup of 18 Fructidor it was announced that anyone campaigning to restore the monarchy or the French Constitution of 1793 would be shot without trial. Germaine moved to Saint-Ouen, on her father&#x27;s estate and became a close friend of the beautiful and wealthy Juliette Récamier to whom she sold her parents&#x27; house in the Rue de la Chaussée-d&#x27;Antin.

De Staël completed the initial part of her first most substantial contribution to political and constitutional theory, &quot;Of present circumstances that can end the Revolution, and of the principles that must found the republic of France&quot;.

==Conflict with Napoleon==
On 6 December 1797 de Staël had the first meeting with Napoleon Bonaparte in Talleyrand&#x27;s office and met him again on 3 January 1798 during a ball. She made it clear to him that she did not agree with his planned invasion of Switzerland. He ignored her opinions and would not read her letters. 
In January 1800, Napoleon appointed Benjamin Constant a member of the Tribunat; not long after, Constant became his enemy. Two years later, Napoleon forced him into exile on account of his speeches which he took to be actually written by Mme de Staël. In August 1802, Napoleon was elected first consul for life. This put de Staël into opposition to him both for personal and political reasons. In her view, Napoleon had begun to resemble Machiavelli&#x27;s princes in The Prince (in fact tyrants); while for Napoleon, Voltaire, J.J. Rousseau and their followers were the cause of the French Revolution. This view was cemented when Jacques Necker published his &quot;Last Views on Politics and Finance&quot; and his daughter, her &quot;De la littérature considérée dans ses rapports avec les institutions sociales&quot;. It was her first philosophical treatment of the Europe question: it dealt with such factors as nationality, history, and social institutions. Napoleon started a campaign against her latest publication. He did not like her cultural determinism and generalizations, in which she stated that &quot;an artist must be of his own time&quot;. In his opinion a woman should stick to knitting. He said about her, according to the Memoirs of Madame de Rémusat, that she &quot;teaches people to think who had never thought before, or who had forgotten how to think&quot;. It became clear that the first man of France and de Staël were not likely ever to get along together.

De Staël published a provocative, anti-Catholic novel &quot;Delphine&quot;, in which the &quot;femme incomprise&quot; (misunderstood woman) living in Paris between 1789 and 1792, is confronted with conservative ideas about divorce after the Concordat of 1801. In this tragic novel, influenced by Goethe&#x27;s &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot; and Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse&quot;, she reflects on the legal and practical aspects on divorce, the arrests and the September Massacres, and the fate of the émigrés. (During the winter of 1794 it seems De Staël was pondering a divorce and whether to marry Ribbing.) The main characters have traits of the unstable Benjamin Constant, and Talleyrand is depicted as an old woman, herself as the heroine with the liberal view of the Italian aristocrat and politician Melzi d&#x27;Eril. 

When Constant moved to Maffliers in September 1803 de Staël went to see him and let Napoleon know she would be wise and cautious. Thereupon her house immediately became popular again among her friends, but Napoleon, informed by Madame de Genlis, suspected a conspiracy. &quot;Her extensive network of connections – which included foreign diplomats and known political opponents, as well as members of the government and of Bonaparte&#x27;s own family – was in itself a source of suspicion and alarm for the government.&quot; Her protection of Jean Gabriel Peltier – who plotted the death of Napoleon – influenced his decision on 13 October 1803 to exile her without trial.

==Years of exile==
For ten years, de Staël was not allowed to come within 40 leagues (almost 200 km) of Paris. She accused Napoleon of &quot;persecuting a woman and her children&quot;. On 23 October, she left for Germany &quot;out of pride&quot;, in the hope of gaining support and to be able to return home as soon as possible.

===German travels===

With her children and Constant, de Staël stopped off in Metz and met Kant&#x27;s French translator Charles de Villers. In mid-December, they arrived in Weimar, where she stayed for two and a half months at the court of the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and his mother Anna Amalia. Goethe who had become ill hesitated about seeing her. After meeting her, Goethe went on to refer to her as an &quot;extraordinary woman&quot; in his private correspondence. Schiller complimented her intelligence and eloquence, but her frequent visits distracted him from completing &quot;William Tell&quot;. De Staël was constantly on the move, talking and asking questions. Constant decided to abandon her in Leipzig and return to Switzerland. De Staël travelled on to Berlin, where she made the acquaintance of August Schlegel who was lecturing there on literature. She appointed him on an enormous salary to tutor her children. On 18 April they all left Berlin when the news of her father&#x27;s death reached her. 

===Mistress of Coppet===
On 19 May, de Staël arrived in Coppet now its wealthy and independent mistress. She spent the summer at the chateau sorting through his writings and published an essay on his private life. In April 1804, Friedrich Schlegel married Dorothea Veit in the Swedish embassy. In July Constant wrote about de Staël, &quot;She exerts over everything around her a kind of inexplicable but real power. If only she could govern herself, she might have governed the world.&quot; In December 1804 she travelled to Italy, accompanied by her children, August Wilhelm Schlegel, and the historian Sismondi. There she met the poet Monti and the painter, Angelica Kauffman. &quot;Her visit to Italy helped her to develop her theory of the difference between northern and southern societies...&quot;

De Staël returned to Coppet in June 1805, moved to Meulan (Château d&#x27;Acosta), and spent nearly a year writing her next book on Italy&#x27;s culture and history. In &quot;Corinne ou l&#x27;Italie&quot; (1807), her own impressions of a sentimental and intellectual journey, the heroine appears to have been inspired by the Italian poet Diodata Saluzzo Roero. The book tells the story of two lovers: Corinne, the Italian poet, and Lord Nelvil, the English noble, traveling through Italy on a journey in part mirroring Staël’s own travels. (Staël appears to have identified with her character, and there are several portraits of Staël represented as Corinne.) She combined romance with travelogue, showed all of Italy&#x27;s works of art still in place, rather than plundered by Napoleon and taken to France. The book&#x27;s publication acted as a reminder of her existence, and Napoleon sent her back to Coppet. Her house became, according to Stendhal, &quot;the general headquarters of European thought&quot; and was a debating club hostile to Napoleon, &quot;turning conquered Europe into a parody of a feudal empire, with his own relatives in the roles of vassal states&quot;. Madame Récamier, also banned by Napoleon, Prince Augustus of Prussia, Charles Victor de Bonstetten, and Chateaubriand all belonged to the &quot;Coppet group&quot;. Each day the table was laid for about thirty guests. Talking seemed to be everybody&#x27;s chief activity.

For a time de Staël lived with Constant in Auxerre (1806), Rouen (1807), Aubergenville (1807). Then she met Friedrich Schlegel, whose wife Dorothea had translated &quot;Corinne&quot; into German. The use of the word Romanticism was invented by Schlegel but spread more widely across France through its persistent use by de Staël. Late in 1807 she set out for Vienna and visited Maurice O&#x27;Donnell. She was accompanied by her children and August Schlegel who gave his famous lectures there. In 1808 Benjamin Constant was afraid to admit to her that he had married Charlotte von Hardenberg in the meantime. &quot;If men had the qualities of women&quot;, de Staël wrote, &quot;love would simply cease to be a problem.&quot; De Staël set to work on her book about Germany – in which she presented the idea of a state called &quot;Germany&quot; as a model of ethics and aesthetics and praised German literature and philosophy. The exchange of ideas and literary and philosophical conversations with Goethe, Schiller, and Wieland had inspired de Staël to write one of the most influential books of the nineteenth century on Germany.

===Return to France===
Pretending she wanted to emigrate to the United States, de Staël was given permission to re-enter France. She moved first into the Château de Chaumont (1810), then relocated to Fossé and Vendôme. She was determined to publish &quot;De l&#x27;Allemagne&quot; in France, a multi-volume book about German culture and in particular the growing movement of German Romanticism. The book was considered &quot;dangerous&quot; by Napoleon as it favorably presented &quot;new and foreign ideas&quot; that challenged existing French political structures. Constrained by censorship, she wrote to the emperor a letter of complaint. The minister of police Savary had emphatically forbidden her to publish her &quot;un-French&quot; book. In 1810, after de Staël had successfully published her book in France, Napoleon ordered the destruction of all 10,000 copies. In October of the same year, she was exiled again and had to leave France within three days. August Schlegel was also ordered to leave the Swiss Confederation as an enemy of French literature. De Staël found consolation in a wounded veteran officer named Albert de Rocca, twenty-three years her junior, to whom she got privately engaged in 1811 but did not marry publicly until 1816.

===East European travels===
The operations of the French imperial police in the case of de Staël are rather obscure. She was at first left undisturbed, but by degrees, the chateau itself became a source of suspicion, and her visitors found themselves heavily persecuted. François-Emmanuel Guignard, De Montmorency and Mme Récamier were exiled for the crime of visiting her. She remained at home during the winter of 1811, planning to escape to England or Sweden with the manuscript. On 23 May 1812, she left Coppet under the pretext of a short outing, but journeyed through Bern, Innsbruck and Salzburg to Vienna, where she met Metternich. There, after some trepidation and trouble, she received the necessary passports to go on to Russia.

During Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia, de Staël, her two children, and Schlegel travelled through Galicia in the Habsburg empire from Brno to Łańcut where de Rocca, having deserted the French army and having been searched by the French gendarmerie, was waiting for her. The journey continued to Lemberg. On 14 July 1812 they arrived in Volhynia. In the meantime, Napoleon, who took a more northern route, had crossed the Niemen River with his army. In Kyiv, she met Miloradovich, governor of the city. De Staël hesitated to travel on to Odessa, Constantinople, and decided instead to go north. Perhaps she was informed of the outbreak of plague in the Ottoman Empire. In Moscow, she was invited by the governor Fyodor Rostopchin. According to de Staël, it was Rostopchin who ordered his mansion in Italian style near Winkovo to be set on fire. She left only a few weeks before Napoleon arrived there. Until 7 September, her party stayed in Saint Petersburg. According to John Quincy Adams, the American ambassador in Russia, her sentiments appeared to be as much the result of personal resentment against Bonaparte as of her general views of public affairs. She complained that he would not let her live in peace anywhere, merely because she had not praised him in her works. She met twice with the tsar Alexander I of Russia who &quot;related to me also the lessons a la Machiavelli which Napoleon had thought proper to give him.&quot;

For de Staël, that was a vulgar and vicious theory. General Kutuzov sent her letters from the Battle of Tarutino; before the end of that year he succeeded, aided by the extreme weather, in chasing the Grande Armée out of Russia.

After four months of travel, de Staël arrived in Sweden. In 1811, she began writing her &quot;Ten Years&#x27; Exile&quot;, detailing her travels and encounters. She traveled to Stockholm the following year, and continued work there. She did not finish the manuscript and after eight months, she set out for England, without August Schlegel, who meanwhile had been appointed secretary to the Crown Prince Carl Johan, formerly French Marshal Jean Baptiste Bernadotte (She supported Bernadotte as the new ruler of France, as she hoped he would introduce a constitutional monarchy). In London she received a great welcome. She met Lord Byron, William Wilberforce, the abolitionist, and Sir Humphry Davy, the chemist and inventor. According to Byron, &quot;She preached English politics to the first of our English Whig politicians ... preached politics no less to our Tory politicians the day after.&quot; In March 1814 she invited Wilberforce for dinner and devoted the remaining years of her life to the fight for the abolition of the slave trade. Her stay was severely marred by the death of her son Albert, who as a member of the Swedish army had fallen in a duel with a Cossack officer in Doberan as a result of a gambling dispute. In October John Murray published &quot;De l&#x27;Allemagne&quot; both in French and English translation, in which she reflected on nationalism and suggested a re-consideration of cultural rather than natural boundaries. In May 1814, after Louis XVIII had been crowned (Bourbon Restoration) she returned to Paris. She wrote her &quot;Considérations sur la révolution française&quot;, based on Part One of &quot;Ten Years&#x27; Exile&quot;. Again her salon became a major attraction both for Parisians and foreigners.

==Restoration and death==

When news came of Napoleon&#x27;s landing on the Côte d&#x27;Azur, between Cannes and Antibes, early in March 1815, de Staël fled again to Coppet, and never forgave Constant for approving of Napoleon&#x27;s return. Although she had no affection for the Bourbons she succeeded in obtaining restitution for the huge loan Necker had made to the French state in 1778 before the Revolution (see above). In October, after the Battle of Waterloo, she set out for Italy, not only for the sake of her own health but for that of her second husband, de Rocca, who was suffering from tuberculosis. In May her 19-year-old daughter Albertine married Victor, 3rd duc de Broglie in Livorno.

The whole family returned to Coppet in June. Lord Byron, at that time in debt, left London in great trouble and frequently visited de Staël during July and August. For Byron, she was Europe&#x27;s greatest living writer, but &quot;with her pen behind her ears and her mouth full of ink&quot;. &quot;Byron was particularly critical of de Staël&#x27;s self-dramatizing tendencies&quot;. Byron was a supporter of Napoleon, but for de Staël Bonaparte &quot;was not only a talented man but also one who represented a whole pernicious system of power&quot;, a system that &quot;ought to be examined as a great political problem relevant to many generations.&quot; &quot;Napoleon imposed standards of homogeneity on Europe that is, French taste in literature, art and the legal systems, all of which de Staël saw as inimical to her cosmopolitan point of view.&quot; Byron wrote she was &quot;sometimes right and often wrong about Italy and England – but almost always true in delineating the heart, which is of but one nation of no country, or rather, of all.&quot;

Despite her increasingly ill health, de Staël returned to Paris for the winter of 1816–17, living at 40, rue des Mathurins. Constant argued with de Staël, who had asked him to pay off his debts to her. A warm friendship sprang up between de Staël and the Duke of Wellington, whom she had first met in 1814, and she used her influence with him to have the size of the Army of Occupation greatly reduced.

De Staël became confined to her house, paralyzed since 21 February 1817 following a stroke. She died on 14 July 1817. Her deathbed conversion to Roman Catholicism, after reading Thomas à Kempis, was reported but is subject to some debate. Wellington remarked that, while he knew that she was greatly afraid of death, he had thought her incapable of believing in the afterlife. Wellington makes no mention of de Staël reading Thomas à Kempis in the quote found in Elizabeth Longford&#x27;s biography of the Iron Duke. Furthermore, he reports hearsay, which may explain why two modern biographies of de Staël – Herold and Fairweather – discount the conversion entirely. Herold states that &quot;her last deed in life was to reaffirm in her &#x27;Considerations, her faith in Enlightenment, freedom, and progress&#x27;.&quot; Rocca survived her by little more than six months. The first edition of her complete works was published by his son with the publishing house Treuttel &amp; Würtz in 1820-1821.

==Offspring==

In total, Madame de Staël had six children, who were all acknowledged by her husband (except her last son, who was born after his death). In all likelihood, only the first two children were actually fathered by Erik de Staël-Holstein:

# Gustavine Sophie Madeleine de Staël-Holstein (July 1787), died in infancy. 
# Gustava Hedwig de Staël-Holstein (August 1789), died in infancy.

It is believed Louis, Comte de Narbonne-Lara (himself a reputed unacknowledged illegitimate child of Louis XV), fathered her next two sons:

3. Louis Auguste de Staël-Holstein (1 September 1790 - 11 November 1827), an abolitionist. 

4. Mattias Albert de Staël-Holstein (2 October 1792 - 12 July 1813), killed in a duel in Mecklenburg.

It is believed that Benjamin Constant was the biological father of her daughter:

5. Albertine Ida Gustavine de Staël-Holstein (8 June 1797 - 22 September 1838), who married Victor, Duc de Broglie. 

With her second husband, Albert de Rocca, de Staël then aged 46, had one disabled son:

6. Théodore Gilles Louis Alphonse de Rocca (7 April 1812 - 12 November 1842), who married Marie-Louise-Antoinette de Rambuteau, daughter of Claude-Philibert Barthelot de Rambuteau, and granddaughter of De Narbonne.

Even as she gave birth, there were fifteen people in her bedroom.

After the death of de Staël&#x27;s husband, Mathieu de Montmorency became the legal guardian of her children. Like August Schlegel he was one of her intimates until the end of her life.

==Legacy==
Albertine Necker de Saussure, married to de Staël&#x27;s cousin, wrote her biography in 1821 and published it as part of the collected works. Auguste Comte included Mme de Staël in his 1849 &quot;Calendar of Great Men&quot;. &quot;In one version of the calendar, the 24th day of the month of Dante is dedicated to Madame de Staël, who finds herself among such poets as Milton, Cervantes, and Chaucer. In another version, Staël finds herself honored, instead, on the 19th day of the tenth month, known as “Shakespeare,” among the likes of Goethe, Racine, Voltaire, and Madame de Sevigné.&quot; Her political legacy has been generally identified with a stout defence of &quot;liberal&quot; values: equality, individual freedom, and the limitation of state power by constitutional rules. &quot;Yet although she insisted to the Duke of Wellington that she needed politics in order to live, her attitude towards the propriety of female political engagement varied: at times she declared that women should simply be the guardians of domestic space for the opposite sex, while at others, that denying women access to the public sphere of activism and engagement was an abuse of human rights. This paradox partly explains the persona of the &quot;homme-femme&quot; she presented in society, and it remained unresolved throughout her life.&quot;

Comte&#x27;s disciple Frederic Harrison wrote about de Staël that her novels &quot;precede the works of Walter Scott, Byron, Mary Shelley, and partly those of Chateaubriand, their historical importance is great in the development of modern Romanticism, of the romance of the heart, the delight in nature, and in the arts, antiquities, and history of Europe.&quot;

===Precursor of feminism===
Recent studies by historians, including feminists, have been assessing the specifically feminine dimension in de Staël&#x27;s contributions both as an activist-theorist and as a writer about the tumultuous events of her time. Some scholars call her a precursor of feminism.
Staël had a robust theory of female liberation. At the time that Staël was writing, in the peak years of the French Revolution, early French feminism was animated over the issue of legal and political equality for the sexes. At the advent of the French Revolution in 1789, the image of a traditional homemaking woman had given way to a more militant feminist approach found in pamphlets that circulated in France at the time. In this sea of tumultuous events, Staël’s use of the novel and more implicit methods to communicate her beliefs about the Revolution and gender equality, coupled with her social status, aided in ensuring her endurance on the political and literary scene.
Staël’s extensive set of writings, from her correspondence with lovers to her philosophy to her fiction, betray not just the tension between intellectual and romantic fulfillment but also between feminist political equality and romantic fulfillment. Her work indicates that she finds her two desires, personal freedom and emotional intimacy, to be diametrically opposed in practice, especially in post-Revolutionary French society. In particular, she deplored that men took the central roles in Enlightenment philosophy and politics, neither of which included avenues for women’s direct participation.

=== Abolition ===
Staël was a strong advocate for the abolition of slavery in the French colonies. In her later years, her salon was frequented by abolitionists, and emancipation was a recurring topic of their discussions. After meeting the famous abolitionist William Wilberforce in 1814, Staël published a preface for his essay on the slave trade in which she called for the end of slavery in Europe. In that text, Staël argued in particular against those who defended slavery on the grounds that the economic impact of abandoning the slave trade would be too grave: 

&quot;When it is proposed that some abuse of power be eliminated, those who benefit from that abuse are certain to declare that all the benefits of the social order are attached to it. ‘This is the keystone,’ they say, while it is only the keystone to their own advantages; and when at last the progress of enlightenment brings about the long-desired reform, they are astonished at the improvements which result from it. Good sends out its roots everywhere; equilibrium is effortlessly restored; and truth heals the ills of the human species, as does nature, without anyone’s intervention.&quot; (Kadish and Massardier-Kenney 2009, 169)  

Staël argues here that the claim that abolition would have “dire consequences” for the French economy is nothing but an illusory threat used by those who benefit from the institution of slavery (Kadish and Massardier-Kenney 2009, 169). Staël believed that the termination of the slave trade would improve France and bring about a positive consequence that ‘sends out its roots everywhere.

=== Letters to Jefferson ===
In 1807, Jacques Le Ray de Chaumont sent Jefferson a copy of &quot;Corinne&quot;, and also conveyed to Staël Jefferson’s first letter addressed to her. This marked the beginning of a series of eight letters between the two, the last of which was sent from Staël to Jefferson shortly before her passing in 1817. 

The correspondence between Staël and Jefferson sheds light upon the fascinating relationship between two momentous figures, covering the personal (such as Staël’s son Auguste’s desire to visit the United States to “make a pilgrimage toward reason and freedom”) and the global (the War of 1812 is the pressing topic, and there is even an interlude where Jefferson details the state of South American geopolitics, replete with a map).

Famously, in 1816, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson, Staël writes, “If one succeeds in destroying slavery in the South, at least one government in the world will be as perfect as human reason can possibly conceive.” Although this is generally understood by scholars to be a criticism of slavery in the southern states of the United States, due to ambiguity in translating the word &quot;south&quot; from the original French, other scholars have suggested that de Staël could be referring to colonization in South America.

=== Staël and the Adams family ===
The Adams family (including former American presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams and former First Lady Abigail Adams) was an important political family in the U.S during the 18th and early 20th century. Staël was a frequent topic of discussion amongst the Adams. John Quincy Adams, the 6th U.S president, in particular, recommended and sent many copies of Staël’s works to his father, John Adams; mother, Abigail Adams; and wife, Louisa Catherine Adams. In letters written between the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century, these members of the Adams family discussed &quot;Delphine&quot;, &quot;A Treatise on the Influence of the Passions, Upon the Happiness of Individuals and of Nations&quot;, and &quot;The Reflections Upon Peace&quot;.

==In popular culture==

* Republican activist Victor Gold quoted Madame de Staël when characterizing American Vice President Dick Cheney, &quot;Men do not change, they unmask themselves.&quot;
* De Staël is credited in Tolstoy&#x27;s epilogue to &quot;War and Peace&quot; as a factor of the &#x27;influential forces&#x27; which historians say led to the movement of humanity in that era.
* The popular wrestling compilation series &quot;Botchamania&quot; has referenced her on several occasions saying &quot;One must choose in life, between boredom and suffering&quot; which is normally followed by a humorous joke.
* On the popular HBO television show, The Sopranos, character Meadow Soprano quotes Madame de Staël in Season 2, Episode 7, &quot;D-Girl&quot;, when she says, &quot;Madame de Staël said, &#x27;In life one must choose between boredom or suffering.&#x27;&quot;
* Mme de Staël is used several times to characterize Mme de Grandet in Stendhal&#x27;s &quot;Lucien Leuwen&quot;.
* Mme de Staël is mentioned several times, always approvingly, by Russia&#x27;s national poet, Alexander Pushkin. He described her in 1825 as a woman whose persecution distinguished her and who commanded respect from all of Europe, and gave her a positive portrayal in his unfinished 1836 novel &quot;Roslavlev&quot;. Her high stature in Russia is attested by Pushkin&#x27;s warning to a critic: &quot;Mme de Staël is ours, do not touch her!&quot;
* Pushkin&#x27;s friend Pyotr Vyazemsky was also an admirer of her life and works.
* Mme de Staël is frequently quoted by Ralph Waldo Emerson and she is credited with introducing him to recent German thought.
* Herman Melville considered de Staël among the greatest women of the century and Margaret Fuller consciously adopted de Staël as her role model.
* Danish radical Georg Brandes gave pride of place to de Staël in his survey of &quot;Emigrantlitteraturen&quot; and highly esteemed her novels, particularly &quot;Corinne&quot;, which was also admired by Henrik Ibsen and used as a guidebook for his travels through Italy.
* Talleyrand observed with his customary cynicism that Germaine enjoyed throwing people overboard simply to have the pleasure of fishing them out of the water again.
* Sismondi accused De Staël of a lack of tact, when they were travelling through Italy and wrote Mme De Staël was easily bored if she had to pay attention to things.
* For Heinrich Heine she was the &quot;grandmother of doctrines&quot;.
* For Byron she was &quot;a good woman at heart and the cleverest at bottom, but spoilt by a wish to beshe knew not what. In her own house she was amiable; in any other person&#x27;s, you wished her gone, and in her own again&quot;.

<text>Gilan province () is one of the 31 provinces of Iran, in the northwest of the country. Its capital is the city of Rasht. The province lies along the Caspian Sea, in Iran&#x27;s Region 3, west of the province of Mazandaran, east of the province of Ardabil, and north of the provinces of Zanjan and Qazvin. It borders Azerbaijan (Astara District) in the north.

The northern section of the province is part of the territory of South (Iranian) Talysh. At the center of the province is Rasht. Other cities include Astaneh-ye Ashrafiyeh, Astara, Fuman, Hashtpar, Lahijan, Langarud, Masuleh, Manjil, Rudbar, Rudsar, Shaft, Siahkal, and Sowme&#x27;eh Sara. The main port is Bandar-e Anzali, formerly known as Bandar-e Pahlavi.

==History==
===Paleolithic===
Early humans were present at Gilan since Lower Paleolithic. Darband Cave is the earliest known human habitation site in Gilan province; it is located in a deep tributary canyon of the Siah Varud and contains evidence for the earliest prehistoric human cave occupation during the Lower Paleolithic in Iran.

Stone artifacts and animal fossils were discovered by a group of Iranian archaeologists that dates back to the late Chibanian. Yarshalman is a Middle Paleolithic shelter that was probably occupied by Neanderthals about 40,000 to 70,000 years ago. Later Paleolithic sites in Gilan are Chapalak Cave and Khalvasht shelter.

===Early history===
It seems that the Gelae, or Gilites, entered the region south of the Caspian coast and west of the Amardos River (now called the Sefid-Rud) in the second or first century BCE, Pliny identifies them with the Cadusii who were living there previously. It is more likely that they were a separate people, had come from the region of Dagestan, and taken the place of the Kadusii. That the native inhabitants of Gilan have some originating roots in the Caucasus is supported by genetics and language, as the Y-DNA of Gilaks most closely resemble that of Georgians and other South Caucasus peoples, while their mtDNA closely resembles other Iranian groups. Their languages shares typologic features with the languages of the Caucasus.

===Medieval history===
Gilan province was the place of origin of the Ziyarid dynasty and Buyid dynasty in the mid-10th century. Previously, the people of the province had a prominent position during the Sassanid dynasty through the 7th century, so that their political power extended to Mesopotamia.

The first recorded encounter between Gilak and Deylamite warlords and invading Muslim armies was at the Battle of Jalula in 637 AD. Deylamite commander Muta led an army of Gils, Deylamites, Persians and people of the Rey region. Muta was killed in the battle, and his defeated army managed to retreat in an orderly manner.

However, this appears to have been a Pyrrhic victory for the Arabs, since they did not pursue their opponents. Muslim Arabs never managed to conquer Gilan as they did with other provinces in Iran. Gilanis and Deylamites successfully repulsed all Arab attempts to occupy their land or to convert them to Islam.

In fact, it was the Deylamites under the Buyid king Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla who finally shifted the balance of power by conquering Baghdad in 945. Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla, however, allowed the Abbasid caliphs to remain in comfortable, secluded captivity in their palaces.

The Church of the East began evangelizing Gilan in the 780s, when a metropolitan bishopric was established under Shubhalishoʿ. In the 9th and 10th centuries AD, Deylamites and later Gilanis gradually converted to Zaydi Shiʿism.

Several Deylamite commanders and soldiers of fortune who were active in the military theaters of Iran and Mesopotamia were openly Zoroastrian (for example, Asfar Shiruyeh a warlord in central Iran, and Makan, son of Kaki, the warlord of Rey) or were suspected of harboring pro-Zoroastrian (for example Mardavij) sentiments. Muslim chronicles of Varangian (Rus&#x27;, pre-Russian Norsemen) invasions of the littoral Caspian region in the 9th century record Deylamites as non-Muslim. These chronicles also show that the Deylamites were the only warriors in the Caspian region who could fight the fearsome Varangian Vikings as equals. Deylamite mercenaries served as far away as Egypt, al-Andalus, and in the Khazar Kingdom.

The Buyids established the most successful of the Deylamite dynasties of Iran.


In the 9th–11th century AD, there were repeated military raids undertaken by the Rus&#x27; between 864 and 1041 on the Caspian Sea shores of Iran, Azerbaijan, and Dagestan as part of the Caspian expeditions of the Rus&#x27;. Initially, the Rus&#x27; appeared in Serkland in the 9th century traveling as merchants along the Volga trade route, selling furs, honey, and slaves. The first small-scale raids took place in the late 9th and early 10th century. The Rus&#x27; undertook the first large-scale expedition in 913; having arrived on 500 ships, they pillaged the westernmost parts of Gorgan as well as Gilan and Mazandaran, taking slaves and goods.

The Turkish invasions of the 10th and 11th centuries CE, which saw the rise of Ghaznavid and Seljuk dynasties, put an end to Deylamite states in Iran. From the 11th century CE to the rise of Safavids, Gilan was ruled by local rulers who paid tribute to the dominant power south of the Alborz range but ruled independently.
In 1307 the Ilkhan Öljeitü conquered the region. This was the first time the region came under the rule of the Mongols after the Ilkhanid Mongols and their Georgian allies failed to do it in the late 1270s. After 1336, the region seemed to be independent again.

Before the introduction of silk production (date unknown but a pillar of the economy by the 15th century AD), Gilan was a poor province. There were no permanent trade routes linking Gilan to Persia. There was a small trade in smoked fish and wood products. It seems that the city of Qazvin was initially a fortress-town against marauding bands of Deylamites, another sign that the economy of the province did not produce enough on its own to support its population. This changed with the introduction of the silk worm in the late Middle Ages.

===Early modern and modern history===
Gilan recognized twice, for brief periods, the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire without rendering tribute to the Sublime Porte, in 1534 and 1591.

The Safavid emperor, Shah Abbas I ended the rule of Khan Ahmad Khan (the last semi-independent ruler of Gilan) and annexed the province directly to his empire. From this point onward, rulers of Gilan were appointed by the Persian Shah. In the Safavid era, Gilan was settled by large numbers of Georgians, Circassians, Armenians, and other peoples of the Caucasus whose descendants still live or linger across Gilan. Most of these Georgians and Circassians are assimilated into the mainstream Gilaks. The history of Georgian settlement is described by Iskandar Beg Munshi, the author of the 17th century &quot;Tarikh-e Alam-Ara-ye Abbasi&quot;, and the Circassian settlements by Pietro Della Valle, among other authors.

The Safavid empire became weak towards the end of the 17th century CE. By the early 18th century, the once-mighty empire was in the grips of civil war and uprisings. The ambitious Peter I of Russia (Peter the Great) sent a force that captured Gilan and many of the Iranian territories in the North Caucasus, Transcaucasia, as well as other territories in northern mainland Iran, through the Russo-Persian War (1722–1723) and the resulting Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1723). Gilan and its capital of Rasht, which was conquered between late 1722 and late March 1723, stayed in Russian possession for about ten years.

Qajars established a central government in Persia (Iran) in the late 18th century CE. They lost a series of wars to Russia (Russo-Persian Wars 1804–1813 and 1826–28), resulting in an enormous gain of influence by the Russian Empire in the Caspian region, which would last up to 1946. The Gilanian cities of Rasht and Anzali were all but occupied and settled by Russians and Russian forces. Most major cities in the region had Russian schools and significant traces of Russian culture can be found today in Rasht. Russian class was mandatory in schools and the significant increase of Russian influence in the region lasted until 1946 and had a major impact on Iranian history, as it directly led to the Persian Constitutional Revolution.

Gilan was a major producer of silk beginning in the 15th century CE. As a result, it was one of the wealthiest provinces in Iran. Safavid annexation in the 16th century was at least partially motivated by this revenue stream. The silk trade, though not the production, was a monopoly of the Crown and the single most important source of trade revenue for the imperial treasury. As early as the 16th century and until the mid 19th century, Gilan was the major exporter of silk in Asia. The Shah farmed out this trade to Greek and Armenian merchants and, in return, received a handsome portion of the proceeds.

In the mid-19th century, a fatal epidemic among the silk worms paralyzed Gilan&#x27;s economy, causing widespread economic distress. Gilan&#x27;s budding industrialists and merchants were increasingly dissatisfied with the weak and ineffective rule of the Qajars. Re-orientation of Gilan&#x27;s agriculture and industry from silk to production of rice and the introduction of tea plantations were a partial answer to the decline of silk in the province.

After World War I, Gilan came to be ruled independently of the central government of Tehran and concern arose that the province might permanently separate. Before the war, Gilanis had played an important role in the Constitutional Revolution of Iran. Sepahdar-e Tonekaboni (Rashti) was a prominent figure in the early years of the revolution and was instrumental in defeating Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar.

In the late 1910s, many Gilanis gathered under the leadership of Mirza Kuchik Khan, who became the most prominent revolutionary leader in northern Iran in this period. Khan&#x27;s movement, known as the Jangal movement of Gilan, had sent an armed brigade to Tehran that helped depose the Qajar ruler Mohammad Ali Shah. However, the revolution did not progress the way the constitutionalists had strived for, and Iran came to face much internal unrest and foreign intervention, particularly from the British and Russian empires.

During and several years after the Bolshevik Revolution, the region saw another massive influx of Russian settlers (the so-called &quot;White émigrées&quot;). Many of the descendants of these refugees are in the region. During the same period, Anzali served as the main trading port between Iran and Europe.

The Jangalis are glorified in Iranian history and effectively secured Gilan and Mazandaran against foreign invasions. However, in 1920 British forces invaded Bandar-e Anzali, while being pursued by the Bolsheviks. In the midst of this conflict, the Jangalis entered into an alliance with the Bolsheviks against the British. This culminated in the establishment of the Persian Socialist Soviet Republic (commonly known as the Socialist Republic of Gilan), which lasted from June 1920 until September 1921.

In February 1921 the Soviets withdrew their support for the Jangali government of Gilan and signed the Russo-Persian Treaty of Friendship (1921) with the central government of Tehran. The Jangalis continued to struggle against the central government until their final defeat in September 1921 when control of Gilan returned to Tehran.

==Demographics==
===Language and ethnicity===

Gilaks form the majority of the population, while Azerbaijanis, Kurds, Talysh and Persians are significant minorities in the province. Gilaks live in most of the cities and villages in the province, except Astara and Hashtpar counties.

The city and county of Astara are inhabited by majority Azerbaijanis, and a Talysh minority.

There are four groups of Kurds in the province with different origins. Amarlou in Rasht and Rudbar (Districts of Ammarlu, Deylaman, and Raḥmatabad), Reshvand in Rasht, Jalalvand in Langroud, and Kormanj in Hashtpar.

In Talysh county (Hashtpar), the majority are Talysh, and Azerbaijanis make up a significant portion of the population. There are also Kurdish-speaking Gormanj in Talysh county who are immigrants from Khalkhal of Ardabil province.

Persians are concentrated in the city of Rasht and are divided into immigrants from Tehran and other central Iranian cities, and the local Gilak people who have adopted the Persian language and became Persianized.

The Gilaki language is a Caspian language, and a member of the northwestern Iranian language branch, spoken in Iran&#x27;s Gilan, Mazandaran and Qazvin provinces. Gilaki is one of the main languages spoken in the province of Gilan and is divided into three dialects: Western Gilaki, Eastern Gilaki, and Galeshi (in the mountains of Gilan and Mazandaran). The western and eastern dialects are separated by the Sefid Roud.

Although Gilaki is the most widely spoken language in Gilan, the Talysh language is also spoken in the province. There are only two cities in Gilan where Talyshi is exclusively spoken: Masal and Masoleh (although other cities speak Talyshi alongside Gilaki) while Talyshi is spoken mostly in the city of Astara, Hashtpar and surrounding towns.

The Kurdish language is used by Kurds who have moved to the Amarlu region.

Persian is also spoken in the province of Gilan as it is Iran&#x27;s official language, requiring everyone to know Persian.

==Geography and climate==


Gilan has a humid subtropical climate with, by a large margin, the heaviest rainfall in Iran: reaching as high as in the southwestern coast and generally around . Rasht, the capital of the province, is known internationally as the &quot;City of Silver Rains&quot; and in Iran as the &quot;City of Rain&quot;.

Rainfall is heaviest between September and December because the onshore winds from the Siberian High are strongest, but it occurs throughout the year though least abundantly from April to August. Humidity is very high because of the marshy character of the coastal plains and can reach 90 percent in summer for wet bulb temperatures of over . The Alborz range provides further diversity to the land in addition to the Caspian coasts.

The coastline is cooler and attracts large numbers of domestic and international tourists. Large parts of the province are mountainous, green and forested. The coastal plain along the Caspian Sea is similar to that of Mazandaran and mainly used for rice paddies. Due to successive cultivation and selection of rice by farmers, several cultivars including Gerdeh, Hashemi, Hasani, and Gharib have been bred.

<text>Sadr City (), formerly known as Al-Thawra () and Saddam City (), is a suburb district of the city of Baghdad, Iraq. It was built in 1959 by Prime Minister Abdul Karim Qassim and named Al-Rafidain District. After the US-led invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam, it was unofficially renamed Sadr City after Ayatollah Muhammad al-Sadr.

Sadr City – or more accurately Thawra District () – is one of nine administrative districts in Baghdad. A public housing project neglected by Saddam Hussein, Sadr City holds around 1 million residents.

==History==

The City (or District) was built in 1959 by Prime Minister Abdul Karim Qassim in response to grave housing shortages in Baghdad. At the time it was officially named Al-Rafidain District (), but was colloquially called Al-Thawra () and so it came to be known by that name. It provided housing for Baghdad&#x27;s urban poor, many of whom had come from the countryside and who had until then lived in appalling conditions. Naziha al-Dulaimi was instrumental in turning the vast slums of eastern Baghdad into a massive public works and housing project that came to be known as Revolution City. It quickly became a stronghold of the Iraqi Communist Party, with resistance to the Baathist-led coup of 1963 becoming prevalent within the city itself. The development was devised by the Greek planner Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis, who also designed Islamabad and Riyadh. The original plans for the city were designed as part of Doxiadis’s Plans for Baghdad which were not fully completed as a result of the cancellation of the plans in 1959. Doxiadis Associates managed to develop the northeast side of Baghdad. This later developed as the nucleus for Al-Thawra City.

During urban development of Baghdad, Al-Habibiyah Jewish Cemetery was built by Saddam Hussein in 1975. In 1982, the district was renamed Saddam City. In the 1980s, the district became known for poverty and communist organizing, with illegal documents and, in some cases, people themselves being hidden from the authorities in overflowing septic tanks. The proliferation of communism in the district was seen by some as ironic, given how Doxiadis&#x27;s design had been considered &quot;anticommunist&quot; with the view that it promoted a village atmosphere in an effort to ease the transition of rural migrants to the city.

After Saddam Hussein was removed from power in April 2003, the district was unofficially renamed Sadr City after deceased Shiite leader Mohammad Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr.

===2003===
In April, 2003, the US Army 2d Squadron, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment established their headquarters at the abandoned Sumer cigarette factory located on the eastern side of Sadr City. In honor of the history of the factory, the military named their new camp Camp Marlboro. 
During the fall and winter of 2003, American forces focused on rebuilding civilian infrastructure and training local leaders in democracy. District and neighborhood councils were established, giving the residents of Sadr City representation in the new Iraqi government. The municipal building became the centerpiece of the reconstruction effort, and it was the site of a forward outpost of American soldiers that met daily with council members and citizens. Progress was slow due to escalating tensions and violence, and attacks against the American military increased significantly in late 2003.

On October 9, 2003, the Mahdi Army in Sadr City ambushed an American convoy, inflicting multiple casualties. The Combat Patrol, made up of vehicles from the 2/2 ACR was attacked by approximately 100 men with several improvised explosive devices, RPGs and automatic weapons fire from the surrounding rooftops and streets killing and injuring soldiers from E Trp 2/2 ACR. The Mahdi Army attempted to capture several soldiers during the ambush, but they were ultimately unsuccessful in their efforts to obtain hostages.

On November 9, 2003, a violent confrontation erupted between the chairman of the District Council, elements of the 2d ACR, and a team from the 490th Civil Affairs Battalion. The chairman refused to surrender a pistol during security screening and was shot by an American soldier during a shoving match. The death of the chairman caused a serious setback to reconstruction efforts and led to increased violence.

===2004===

Throughout March 2004 through July 2004, FOB IronHorse, in Sadr City, elements of the 1st Brigade Combat Team and the 13th Signal Battalion were hit almost daily with Mortars and RPGs. TF Lancer was located at FOB War Eagle, northern side of Sadr City. There was no American media in the area to report the multiple mortar and RPG fire which hit both FOBs almost daily.
In late March, 2004, Task Force Lancer, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Gary Volesky arrived at Camp War Eagle on the north-east corner of Sadr City, to assume responsibility for the governance and security of Sadr City. Task Force Lancer consisted primarily of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment from the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division under the command of Colonel Robert B. Abrams.

On April 4, 2004 the Mahdi Army ambushed a U.S. Army patrol in Sadr City, killing eight American soldiers, and wounding 57 more. This sparked fierce urban fighting between the Mahdi Army and newly arrived soldiers of the B Company 20th Engineer Battalion 2–5, C Battery 1-82 Field Artillery, 2-8 and 1-12 CAV of the 1st Cavalry Division (1CD); alongside the just-relieved 1st Squadron, 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment and elements from 2-37 AR of the 1st Armored Division.

In late 2004 the Mahdi Army enacted a cease-fire with U.S. troops, and offered to help repair and rebuild the city&#x27;s main infrastructure which was leaving millions without electricity, water or sewage. On October 10, Camp Marlboro was hit by three mortars launched from within the city, which saw the U.S. beef up security and attach an additional 28 tanks and 14 Bradley Fighting Vehicles to the camp. The following day, on October 11, the Weapons Handover Program began in the city, which was designed to purchase weapons from militants.

===2005===
On May 15, 2005 the bodies of 13 Iraqis were discovered in a shallow grave, each blindfolded, tied and shot multiple times in the back of the head. They had been hastily buried in a vacant lot. On May 18, gunmen shot and killed Ali Mutib Sakr, a Transport Ministry driver. On May 23, a car bomb exploded outside a crowded restaurant, killing eight Iraqis and wounding an additional 89. On March 12 three car bombs exploded, killing thirty-five people. On July 1 a car bomb exploded in an open-air market killing 77 and wounding 96.

In August 2005 the Iraqi government and the U.S. Army locked down Sadr City for three days to search houses for hostages and death squads. Some hostages were found and freed. Multiple death squad leaders were arrested. In these three days, the number of murders in Baghdad reached the lowest level ever compared to the average of the previous months of the U.S.-led war.

===2006===
On October 24, 2006, the U.S. Army locked down Sadr City while searching for a kidnapped U.S. soldier. During the lock down, deaths dropped by 50%. When Prime Minister al-Maliki demanded the end of the blockade, the murder rate returned to previous levels.

On November 23, 2006, a series of car bombs exploded, followed by mortar attacks, which killed at least 215 people. See 23 November 2006 Sadr City bombings for further details.

=== 2007 Surge ===
As the U.S. began a surge of forces into Iraq, Operation Imposing Law was implemented in Sadr City. On station US army units included 82nd Airborne DIV 2/325 INF White Falcons and 2nd INF DIV C- CO 2/3 INF SBCT.

=== 2008 fighting ===
In March 2008, during the Battle of Basra, clashes erupted in Sadr City between U.S. forces and the Mahdi Army. At that time, Sadr City was secured with the use of Strykers from the 1st Squadron, 2d Stryker Cavalry Regiment led by LTC Daniel Barnett. The fighting grew so intense that armored vehicles including M2A3 Bradley IFVs and M1A1/2 Abrams MBTs were called in for assistance. The Mahdi Army relied heavily in the use of improvised explosive devices allegedly smuggled from Iran and engaged U.S. forces with sniper fire and intense small arms engagements in the heavily congested urban area. The U.S. launched at least one air strike, killing 10 reported militants. As of March 29, 2008, about 75 Iraqis have been killed and 500 injured. The Iraq Health Ministry claims these are all civilians, but the U.S. disputes this.

The Mahdi Army intensified rocket attacks on the Green Zone and other U.S. bases, killing at least three American soldiers and several civilians. On April 6 Iraqi and U.S. forces moved into the southern third of Sadr City to prevent rocket and mortar fire being launched from the area. 1st Squadron, 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment then took control of southern Sadr City and hosted Charlie Company, 1-64 Armor, Bravo Company, 1-14 Infantry and Delta Company, 4-64 Armor along with U.S. combat engineers from the 3rd Brigade Heavy Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division. 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, the headquarters brigade for the operation, began construction of a concrete barrier along Al-Quds street to seal the southern third of the city off and allow reconstruction to take place. C/1-68, a tank and mechanized infantry company team under command and control of 1-68 Armor Combined Arms Battalion, and D/4-64, a tank and mechanized infantry company team, attached to 1-2 SCR, were the primary wall build company level organizations. On May 1, 2008, D/4-64 and B/1-14 killed 28 Mahdi Fighters just north of the concrete barrier. Over the next month, the Mahdi Army launched a number of attacks on the troops building the barrier, but sustained heavy losses. On May 3, 2008 soldiers from Charlie Company, 2-30 Infantry, 10th Mountain Division placed additional barriers along the eastern boundary of Sadr City to isolate the militants&#x27; stronghold, but met heavy resistance as Mahdi Fighters attacked the soldiers with RPGs, IEDs, and small arms fire. The Mahdi fighters were able to destroy two HMMWVs and two MRAPs, however, the unit responded with combined air and ground strikes and used tanks, attack helicopters, and heavy weapons to repel the assault while claiming the deaths of nearly 30 militants.

On May 10, a ceasefire was ordered by Muqtada Al-Sadr, allowing Iraqi troops into all of Sadr City. On May 20, in an entirely Iraqi-planned and executed operation, six battalions of Iraqi troops, including troops from the 1st (Quick Reaction Force) division stationed in Al-Anbar and armored forces from the 9th Division based in Taji, operating without the involvement of U.S. ground forces, (except Marines from 1st ANGLICO, SALT B Provided over watch) pushed deep into Sadr City. The Iraqi Security Forces met little resistance in moving through Sadr City and took up positions formerly occupied by the Mahdi Army, including the Imam Ali and Al-Sadr hospitals and Al-Sadr&#x27;s political office. Sadr City then became the main base for Shi&#x27;a Insurgent group Kata&#x27;ib Hezbollah, an offshoot of the Mahdi Army.

===2009===
After a year of relative calm, Sadr City was struck by a massive bomb blast on June 24, 2009 when a bomb-laden vegetable cart or motorcycle was detonated in the Muraidi Market of the town, killing at least 69 civilians and wounding over 150.

Voters in Sadr City allowed the Iraqi National Alliance to make huge gains in provincial elections in 2009 and parliamentary elections in 2010.

===Reconstruction efforts===
In 2010, a Turkish consortium of contractors won the bid for the reconstruction of Baghdad&#x27;s Sadr City, offering to complete the massive project for $11.3 billion. The project involves construction of a modern city of 75,000 housing units to accommodate up to 600,000 people.

<doc id="210708" wikidata="Q1642480" url="?curid=210708" title="Isaac in Islam">
<text>The biblical patriarch Isaac, Isak ( or &quot;&quot;) is recognized as a prophet of God by Muslims. As in Judaism and Christianity, Islam maintains that Isaac was the son of the patriarch and prophet Abraham from his wife Sarah. Muslims hold Isaac in deep veneration because they believe that both Isaac and his older half-brother Ishmael continued their father&#x27;s spiritual legacy through their subsequent preaching of the message of Allah after the death of Abraham. Isaac is mentioned in fifteen passages of the Quran. Along with being mentioned several times in the Quran, Isaac is held up as one of Islam&#x27;s prophets.

==Early life==
Because of Allah&#x27;s grace and covenant with Abraham, Sarah was gifted with a child in her old age. Isaac was the age of 10 when his half-brother Ishmael went out from Abraham&#x27;s house into the desert. While in the desert Ishmael took a wife of the daughters of Moab named &quot;ʿAʾishah&quot;.

==In the Quran==
Isaac is mentioned seventeen times by name in the Quran, often with his father and his son, Jacob (&quot;Yaʿqūb&quot;). The Quran states that Abraham received &quot;good tidings of Isaac, a prophet, of the righteous&quot;, and that God blessed them both (37: 112). &quot;And We gave him glad tidings of Isaac, a prophet from among the righteous. And We blessed him and Isaac. And among their progeny are the virtuous and those who clearly wrong themselves&quot; In a fuller description, when angels came to Ibrahim to tell him of the future punishment to be imposed on Sodom and Gomorrah, his wife, Sarah, &quot;laughed, and We gave her good tidings of Isaac, and after Isaac of (a grandson) Jacob&quot; (11: 71–74); and it is further explained that this event will take place despite Abraham and Sarah&#x27;s old age. Several verses speak of Isaac as a &quot;gift&quot; to Abraham (6: 84; 19: 49–50), and 29: 26-27 adds that God made &quot;prophethood and the Book to be among his offspring&quot;, which has been interpreted to refer to Abraham&#x27;s two prophetic sons, his prophetic grandson Jacob, and his prophetic great-grandson Joseph. In the Quran, it later narrates that Abraham also praised God for giving him Ishmael and Isaac in his old age (XIV: 39–41).

Elsewhere in the Quran, Isaac is mentioned in lists: Joseph follows the religion of his forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (12: 38) and speaks of God&#x27;s favor to them (12: 6); Yaʿqūb&#x27;s sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the God that their forefathers, &quot;Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac&quot;, worshiped (2: 127); and the Quran commands Muslims to believe in the revelations that were given to &quot;Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Patriarchs&quot; (2: 136; III: 84).

==Burial site==
His tomb and that of his wife Rebekah is considered to be in the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, the West Bank, known in Islam as the &quot;Masjid-i-Ibrahim&quot; (&quot;Mosque of Abraham&quot;). Alongside Isaac&#x27;s tomb are those of some of the other Qur&#x27;anic/Biblical patriarchs and their wives: Abraham and Sarah and Jacob and Leah.

<doc id="210710" wikidata="Q2031644" url="?curid=210710" title="History of the Jews in Russia">
<text>The history of the Jews in Russia and areas historically connected with it goes back at least 1,500 years. Jews in Russia have historically constituted a large religious and ethnic diaspora; the Russian Empire at one time hosted the largest population of Jews in the world. Within these territories, the primarily Ashkenazi Jewish communities of many different areas flourished and developed many of modern Judaism&#x27;s most distinctive theological and cultural traditions, while also facing periods of antisemitic discriminatory policies and persecution, including violent pogroms.

Many analysts have noted a &quot;renaissance&quot; in the Jewish community inside Russia since the beginning of the 21st century; however, the Russian Jewish population has experienced precipitous decline since the dissolution of the USSR which continues to this day, although it is still among the largest in Europe.

== Overview and background ==
The largest group among Russian Jews are Ashkenazi Jews, but the community also includes a significant proportion of non-Ashkenazi from other Jewish diaspora including Mountain Jews, Sephardi Jews, Georgian Jews, Crimean Karaites, Krymchaks and Bukharan Jews.

The presence of Jewish people in the European part of Russia can be traced to the 7th–14th centuries CE. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the Jewish population in Kiev, in present-day Ukraine, was restricted to a separate quarter. Evidence of the presence of Jewish people in Muscovite Russia is first documented in the chronicles of 1471. Since the reign of Catherine II in the 18th century, Jewish people were restricted to the Pale of Settlement (1791–1917) within Russia, the territory where they could live or to which they could immigrate. The three partitions of Poland brought much additional territory to Russia, along with the Jews who were long settled in those lands. Alexander III of Russia escalated anti-Jewish policies. Beginning in the 1880s, waves of anti-Jewish pogroms swept across different regions of the empire for several decades. More than two million Jews fled Russia between 1880 and 1920, mostly to the United States and Palestine. The Pale of Settlement took away many of the rights that the Jewish people of the late 17th century Russia had enjoyed. At this time, the Jewish people were restricted to an area of what is current day Belarus, Lithuania, eastern Poland and Ukraine. Where Western Europe was experiencing emancipation at this time, in Russia the laws for the Jewish people were getting more strict. They were allowed to move further east, towards a less crowded region, though it was only a minority of Jews who took to this migration option. The sporadic and often impoverished communities were formed in small settlements known as &quot;shtetls&quot;.

Before 1917 there were 300,000 Zionists in Russia, while the main Jewish socialist organization, the Bund, had 33,000 members. Only 958 Jews had joined the Bolshevik Party before 1917; thousands joined after the Revolution. The chaotic years of World War I, the February and October Revolutions, and the Russian Civil War had created social disruption that led to antisemitism. Some 150,000 Jews were killed in the pogroms of 1918–1922, 125,000 of them in Ukraine, 25,000 in Belarus. The pogroms were mostly perpetrated by anti-communist forces; although sometimes, Red Army units engaged in pogroms as well. Anton Denikin&#x27;s White Army was a bastion of antisemitism, using &quot;Strike at the Jews and save Russia!&quot; as its motto. The Bolshevik Red Army, although individual soldiers committed antisemitic abuses, had a policy of opposing antisemitism, and as a result, it won the support of much of the Jewish population. After a short period of confusion, the Soviets started executing guilty individuals and even disbanding the army units whose men had attacked Jews. Although pogroms were still perpetrated after this, in general the Jews regarded the Red Army as the only force which was able and willing to defend them. The Russian Civil War pogroms shocked world Jewry and rallied many Jews to the Red Army and the Soviet regime, strengthening the desire for the creation of a homeland for the Jewish people. In August 1919 the Soviet government arrested many rabbis, seized Jewish properties, including synagogues, and dissolved many Jewish communities. The Jewish section of the Communist Party labeled the use of the Hebrew language &quot;reactionary&quot; and &quot;elitist&quot; and the teaching of Hebrew was banned. Zionists were persecuted harshly, with Jewish communists leading the attacks.

Following the civil war, however, the new Bolshevik government&#x27;s policies produced a flourishing of secular Jewish culture in Belarus and western Ukraine in the 1920s. The Soviet government outlawed all expressions of antisemitism, with the public use of the ethnic slur &quot;жид&quot; (&quot;Yid&quot;) being punished by up to one year of imprisonment, and tried to modernize the Jewish community by establishing 1,100 Yiddish-language schools, 40 Yiddish-language daily newspapers and by settling Jews on farms in Ukraine and Crimea; the number of Jews working in the industry had more than doubled between 1926 and 1931. At the beginning of the 1930s, the Jews were 1.8 percent of the Soviet population but 12–15 percent of all university students. In 1934 the Soviet state established the Jewish Autonomous Oblast in the Russian Far East. This region never came to have a majority Jewish population. The JAO is Russia&#x27;s only autonomous oblast and, outside of Israel, the world&#x27;s only Jewish territory with an official status. The observance of the Sabbath was banned in 1929, foreshadowing the dissolution of the Communist Party&#x27;s Yiddish-language Yevsektsia in 1930 and worse repression to come. Numerous Jews were victimized in Stalin&#x27;s purges as &quot;counterrevolutionaries&quot; and &quot;reactionary nationalists&quot;, although in the 1930s the Jews were underrepresented in the Gulag population. The share of Jews in the Soviet ruling elite declined during the 1930s, but was still more than double their proportion in the general Soviet population.

In the 1930s, many Jews held high rank in the Red Army High Command: Generals Iona Yakir, Yan Gamarnik, Yakov Smushkevich (Commander of the Soviet Air Forces) and Grigori Shtern (Commander-in-Chief in the war against Japan and Commander at the front in the Winter War). During World War Two, an estimated 500,000 soldiers in the Red Army were Jewish; about 200,000 were killed in battle. About 160,000 were decorated, and more than a hundred achieved the rank of Red Army general. Over 150 were designated Heroes of the Soviet Union, the highest award in the country. More than two million Soviet Jews are believed to have died during the Holocaust in warfare and in Nazi-occupied territories. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, many Soviet Jews took the opportunity of liberalized emigration policies, with more than half of the population leaving, most for Israel and the West: Germany, the United States, Canada and Australia. For many years during this period, Russia had a higher rate of immigration to Israel than any other country. Russia&#x27;s Jewish population is still the third biggest in Europe, after France and United Kingdom. In November 2012, the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center, one of the world&#x27;s biggest museums of Jewish history, opened in Moscow.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

Jews have been present in contemporary Armenia and Georgia since the Babylonian captivity. Records exist from the 4th century showing that there were Armenian cities possessing Jewish populations ranging from 10,000 to 30,000 along with substantial Jewish settlements in the Crimea. The presence of Jewish people in the territories corresponding to modern Belarus, Ukraine, and the European part of Russia can be traced back to the 7th–14th centuries CE.

=== Kievan Rus&#x27; ===
In the 11th and 12th centuries, the Jewish population may have been restricted to a separate quarter in Kiev, known as the Jewish Town (Old East Slav: Жидове, &quot;Zhidovye&quot;, i.e. &quot;The Jews&quot;), the gates probably leading to which were known as the Jewish Gates (Old East Slavic: Жидовская ворота, &quot;Zhidovskaya vorota&quot;). The Kievan community was oriented towards Byzantium (the Romaniotes), Babylonia and Palestine in the 10th and 11th centuries, but appears to have been increasingly open to the Ashkenazim from the 12th century on. Few products of Kievan Jewish intellectual activity exist, however. Other communities, or groups of individuals, are known from Chernigov and, probably, Volodymyr-Volynskyi. At that time, Jews were probably found also in northeastern Russia, in the domains of Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky (1169–1174), although it is uncertain to which degree they would have been living there permanently.

=== Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ===

Although northeastern Russia had a low Jewish population, countries just to its west had rapidly growing Jewish populations, as waves of anti-Jewish pogroms and expulsions from the countries of Western Europe marked the last centuries of the Middle Ages, a sizable portion of the Jewish populations there moved to the more tolerant countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the Middle East.

Expelled en masse from England, France, Spain and most other Western European countries at various times, and persecuted in Germany in the 14th century, many Western European Jews migrated to Poland upon the invitation of Polish ruler Casimir III the Great to settle in Polish-controlled areas of Eastern Europe as a third estate, although restricted to commercial, middleman services in an agricultural society for the Polish king and nobility between 1330 and 1370, during the reign of Casimir the Great.

After settling in Poland (later Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) and Hungary (later Austria-Hungary), the population expanded into the lightly populated areas of Ukraine and Lithuania, which were to become part of the expanding Russian Empire. In 1495, Alexander the Jagiellonian expelled Jewish residents from Grand Duchy of Lithuania, but reversed his decision in 1503.

In the &quot;shtetls&quot; populated almost entirely by Jews, or in the middle-sized town where Jews constituted a significant part of population, Jewish communities traditionally ruled themselves according to halakha, and were limited by the privileges granted them by local rulers. (See also Shtadlan). These Jews were not assimilated into the larger eastern European societies, and identified as an ethnic group with a unique set of religious beliefs and practices, as well as an ethnically unique economic role.

=== Tsardom of Russia ===
Documentary evidence as to the presence of Jews in Muscovite Russia is first found in the chronicles of 1471. The relatively small population of them were subject to discriminatory laws, but these laws do not appear to have been enforced at all times. Jews residing in Russian and Ukrainian towns suffered numerous religious persecutions. Converted Jews occasionally rose to important positions in the Russian State, for example Peter Shafirov, vice-chancellor under Peter the Great. Shafirov came, as most Russian Jews after the fall of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, from a Jewish family of Polish origin. He had extraordinary knowledge of foreign languages and served as the chief translator in the Russian Foreign Office, subsequently he began to accompany Tsar Peter on his international travels. Following this, he was raised to the rank of vice-chancellor because of his many diplomatic talents and skills, but was later imprisoned, sentenced to death, and eventually banished.

=== Russian Empire ===

Their situation changed radically during the reign of Catherine II, when the Russian Empire acquired large Lithuanian and Polish territories which historically included a high proportion of Jewish residents, especially during the second (1793) and the third (1795) Partitions of Poland. Under the Commonwealth&#x27;s legal system, Jews endured economic restrictions euphemised as &quot;disabilities&quot;, which also continued following the Russian occupation. Catherine established the Pale of Settlement, which included Congress Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus, Bessarabia, and Crimea (the latter was later excluded). Jews were required to live within the Pale and could not migrate elsewhere in Russia without special permission. Within the Pale, the Jewish residents were permitted to vote in municipal elections, but their vote was limited to one third of the total number of voters, even though their proportion in many areas was much higher, even a majority. This served to provide an aura of democracy, while institutionalizing local inter-ethnic conflict.

Jewish communities in Russia were governed internally by local administrative bodies, called the Councils of Elders (&quot;Qahal&quot;, &quot;Kehilla&quot;), constituted in every town or hamlet possessing a Jewish population. These councils had jurisdiction over Jews in matters of internal litigation, as well as fiscal transactions relating to the collection and payment of taxes (poll tax, land tax, etc.). Later, this right of collecting taxes was much abused, and the councils lost civil authority in 1844.

Under Alexander I and Nicholas I, decrees were put forth requiring a Russian-speaking member of a Jewish community to be named to act as an intermediary between his community and the Imperial government to perform certain civil duties, such as registering births, marriages, and divorces. This position came to be known as the crown rabbi although they were not always rabbis and often were not respected by members of their own communities because their main job qualification was fluency in Russian, and they often had no education in, or knowledge of Jewish law.
The beginning of the 19th century was marked by intensive movement of Jews to Novorossiya, where towns, villages and agricultural colonies rapidly sprang up.

In 19th century, legally the Jews were a subcategory of the &quot;inorodtsy&quot; category, special ethnicity-based category of non-Slavic population that received a special treatment under the law.

==== Forcible conscription of Jewish cantonists ====
The &#x27;decree of August 26, 1827&#x27; made Jews liable for military service, and allowed their conscription between the ages of twelve and twenty-five. Each year, the Jewish community had to supply four recruits per thousand of the population. However, in practice, Jewish children were often conscripted as young as eight or nine years old. At the age of twelve, they would be placed for their six-year military education in cantonist schools. They were then required to serve in the Imperial Russian army for 25 years after the completion of their studies, often never seeing their families again. Strict quotas were imposed on all communities and the &quot;qahals&quot; were given the unpleasant task of implementing conscription within the Jewish communities. Since the merchant-guild members, agricultural colonists, factory mechanics, clergy, and all Jews with secondary education were exempt, and the wealthy bribed their way out of having their children conscripted, fewer potential conscripts were available; the adopted policy deeply sharpened internal Jewish social tensions. Seeking to protect the socio-economic and religious integrity of Jewish society, the &quot;qahals&quot; did their best to include “non-useful Jews” in the draft lists so that the heads of tax-paying middle-class families were predominantly exempt from conscription, whereas single Jews, as well as &quot;heretics&quot; (Haskalah influenced individuals), paupers, outcasts, and orphaned children were drafted. They used their power to suppress protests and intimidate potential informers who sought to expose the arbitrariness of the &quot;qahal&quot; to the Russian government. In some cases, communal elders had the most threatening informers murdered (such as the Ushitsa case, 1836).

The zoning rule was suspended during the Crimean War, when conscription became annual. During this period the &quot;qahals&quot; leaders would employ informers and kidnappers (Russian: &quot;&quot;, , ), as many potential conscripts preferred to run away rather than voluntarily submit. In the case of unfulfilled quotas, younger Jewish boys of eight and even younger were frequently taken. The official Russian policy was to encourage the conversion of Jewish cantonists to the state religion of Orthodox Christianity and Jewish boys were coerced to baptism. As kosher food was unavailable, they were faced with the necessity of abandoning of Jewish dietary laws. Polish Catholic boys were subject to similar pressure to convert and assimilate as the Russian Empire was hostile to Catholicism and Polish nationalism.

==== Haskalah in the Russian Empire ====
The cultural and habitual isolation of the Jews gradually began eroding. An ever-increasing number of Jewish people adopted Russian customs and the Russian language. Russian education was spread among the Jewish population. A number of Jewish-Russian periodicals appeared.

Alexander II was known as the &quot;Tsar liberator&quot; for the 1861 abolition of serfdom in Russia. Under his rule Jewish people could not hire Christian servants, could not own land, and were restricted in travel.

Alexander III was a staunch reactionary and an antisemite (influenced by Pobedonostsev) who strictly adhered to the old doctrine of Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality. His escalation of anti-Jewish policies sought to ignite &quot;popular antisemitism&quot;, which portrayed the Jews as &quot;Christ-killers&quot; and the oppressors of the Slavic, Christian victims.

A large-scale wave of anti-Jewish pogroms swept Ukraine in 1881, after Jews were scapegoated for the assassination of Alexander II. In the 1881 outbreak, there were pogroms in 166 Ukrainian towns, thousands of Jewish homes were destroyed, many families reduced to extremes of poverty; large numbers of men, women, and children were injured and some killed. Disorders in the south once again recalled the government attention to the Jewish question. A conference was convened at the Ministry of Interior and on May 15, 1882, so-called &quot;Temporary Regulations&quot; were introduced that stayed in effect for more than thirty years and came to be known as the May Laws.

The repressive legislation was repeatedly revised. Many historians noted the concurrence of these state-enforced antisemitic policies with waves of pogroms that continued until 1884, with at least tacit government knowledge and in some cases policemen were seen inciting or joining the mob. The systematic policy of discrimination banned Jewish people from rural areas and towns of fewer than ten thousand people, even within the Pale, assuring the slow death of many shtetls. In 1887, the quotas placed on the number of Jews allowed into secondary and higher education were tightened down to 10% within the Pale, 5% outside the Pale, except Moscow and Saint Petersburg, held at 3%, even though the Jewish population was a majority or plurality in many communities. It was possible to evade these restrictions upon secondary education by combining private tuition with examination as an &quot;outside student&quot;. Accordingly, within the Pale such outside pupils were almost entirely young Jews. The restrictions placed on education, traditionally highly valued in Jewish communities, resulted in ambition to excel over the peers and increased emigration rates. Special quotas restricted Jews from entering profession of law, limiting number of Jews admitted to the bar.

In 1886, an Edict of Expulsion was enforced on the historic Jewish population of Kiev. Most Jews were expelled from Moscow in 1891 (except few deemed useful) and a newly built synagogue was closed by the city&#x27;s authorities headed by the Tsar&#x27;s brother. Tsar Alexander III refused to curtail repressive practices and reportedly noted: &quot;But we must never forget that the Jews have crucified our Master and have shed his precious blood.&quot;

In 1892, new measures banned Jewish participation in local elections despite their large numbers in many towns of the Pale. The &quot;Town Regulations&quot; prohibited Jews from the right to elect or be elected to town Dumas. Only a small number of Jews were allowed to be members of a town Duma, through appointment by special committees.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Russian Empire had not only the largest Jewish population in the world, but actually a majority of the world&#x27;s Jews living within its borders. In 1897, according to Russian census of 1897, the total Jewish population of Russia was 5,189,401 persons of both sexes (4.13% of total population). Of this total, 93.9% lived in the 25 provinces of the Pale of Settlement. The total population of the Pale of Settlement amounted to 42,338,367—of these, 4,805,354 (11.5%) were Jews.

About 450,000 Jewish soldiers served in the Russian Army during World War I, and fought side by side with their Slavic fellows. When hundreds of thousands of refugees from Poland and Lithuania, among them innumerable Jews, fled in terror before enemy invasion, the Pale of Settlement de facto ceased to exist. Most of the education restrictions on the Jews were removed with the appointment of count Pavel Ignatiev as Minister of Education.

==== Mass emigration ====
Even though the persecutions provided the impetus for mass emigration, there were other relevant factors that can account for the Jews&#x27; migration. After the first years of large emigration from Russia, positive feedback from the emigrants in the U.S. encouraged further emigration. Indeed, more than two million Jews fled Russia between 1880 and 1920. While a large majority emigrated to the United States, some turned to Zionism. In 1882, members of Bilu and Hovevei Zion made what came to be known the First Aliyah to Palestine, then a part of the Ottoman Empire.

The Tsarist government sporadically encouraged Jewish emigration. In 1890, it approved the establishment of &quot;The Society for the Support of Jewish Farmers and Artisans in Syria and Palestine&quot; (known as the &quot;Odessa Committee&quot; headed by Leon Pinsker) dedicated to practical aspects in establishing agricultural Jewish settlements in Palestine.

==== Jewish members of the Duma ====
In total, there were at least twelve Jewish deputies in the First Duma (1906–1907), falling to three or four in the Second Duma (February 1907 to June 1907), two in the Third Duma (1907–1912) and again three in the fourth, elected in 1912. Converts to Christianity like Mikhail Herzenstein and Ossip Pergament were still considered as Jews by the public (and antisemitic) opinion and are most of the time included in these figures.

At the 1906 elections, the Jewish Labour Bund had made an electoral agreement with the Lithuanian Labourers&#x27; Party (&quot;Trudoviks&quot;), which resulted in the election to the Duma of two (non-Bundist) candidates in the Lithuanian provinces: Dr. Shmaryahu Levin for the Vilnius province and Leon Bramson for the Kaunas province.

Among the other Jewish deputies were Maxim Vinaver, chairman of the League for the Attainment of Equal Rights for the Jewish People in Russia (&quot;Folksgrupe&quot;) and cofounder of the Constitutional Democratic Party (&quot;Kadets&quot;), Dr. Nissan Katzenelson (Courland province, Zionist, &quot;Kadet&quot;), Dr. Moisei Yakovlevich Ostrogorsky (Grodno province), attorney Simon Yakovlevich Rosenbaum (Minsk province, Zionist, &quot;Kadet&quot;), Mikhail Isaakovich Sheftel (Ekaterinoslav province, &quot;Kadet&quot;), Dr. Grigory Bruk, Dr. Benyamin Yakubson, Zakhar Frenkel, Solomon Frenkel, Meilakh Chervonenkis. There was also a Crimean Karaim deputy, Salomon Krym.

Three of the Jewish deputies, Bramson, Chervonenkis and Yakubson, joined the Labour faction; nine others joined the Kadet fraction. According to Rufus Learsi, five of them were Zionists, including Dr. Shmaryahu Levin, Dr. Victor Jacobson and Simon Yakovlevich Rosenbaum.

Two of them, Grigori Borisovich Iollos (Poltava province) and Mikhail Herzenstein (b. 1859, d. 1906 in Terijoki), both from the Constitutional Democratic Party, were assassinated by the Black Hundreds antisemite terrorist group. &quot;The &quot;Russkoye Znamya&quot; declares openly that &#x27;Real Russians&#x27; assassinated Herzenstein and Iollos with knowledge of officials, and expresses regret that only two Jews perished in crusade against revolutionaries.

The Second Duma included seven Jewish deputies: Shakho Abramson, Iosif Gessen, Vladimir Matveevich Gessen, Lazar Rabinovich, Yakov Shapiro (all of them Kadets) and Avigdor Mandelberg (Siberia Social Democrat), plus a convert to Christianity, the attorney Ossip Pergament (Odessa).

The two Jewish members of the Third Duma were the Judge Leopold Nikolayevich (or Lazar) Nisselovich (Courland province, Kadet) and Naftali Markovich Friedman (Kaunas province, Kadet). Ossip Pergament was reelected and died before the end of his mandate.

Friedman was the only one reelected to the Fourth Duma in 1912, joined by two new deputies, Meer Bomash, and Dr. Ezekiel Gurevich.

==== Jews in the revolutionary movement ====

Many Jews were prominent in Russian revolutionary parties. The idea of overthrowing the Tsarist regime was attractive to many members of the Jewish intelligentsia because of the oppression of non-Russian nations and non-Orthodox Christians within the Russian Empire. For much the same reason, many non-Russians, notably Latvians or Poles, were disproportionately represented in the party leaderships.

In 1897 General Jewish Labour Bund (The Bund), was formed. Many Jews joined the ranks of two principal revolutionary parties: Socialist-Revolutionary Party and Russian Social Democratic Labour Party—both Bolshevik and Menshevik factions. A notable number of Bolshevik party members were ethnically Jewish, especially in the leadership of the party, and the percentage of Jewish party members among the rival Mensheviks was even higher. Both the founders and leaders of Menshevik faction, Julius Martov and Pavel Axelrod, were Jewish.

Because some of the leading Bolsheviks were Ethnic Jews, and Bolshevism supports a policy of promoting international proletarian revolution—most notably in the case of Leon Trotsky—many enemies of Bolshevism, as well as contemporary antisemites, draw a picture of Communism as a political slur at Jews and accuse Jews of pursuing Bolshevism to benefit Jewish interests, reflected in the terms Jewish Bolshevism or &quot;Judeo-Bolshevism&quot;. The original atheistic and internationalistic ideology of the Bolsheviks (&quot;See proletarian internationalism, bourgeois nationalism&quot;) was incompatible with Jewish traditionalism. Bolsheviks such as Trotsky echoed sentiments dismissing Jewish heritage in place of &quot;internationalism&quot;.

Soon after seizing power, the Bolsheviks established the Yevsektsiya, the Jewish section of the Communist party in order to destroy the rival Bund and Zionist parties, suppress Judaism and replace traditional Jewish culture with &quot;proletarian culture&quot;.

In March 1919, Vladimir Lenin delivered a speech &quot;On Anti-Jewish Pogroms&quot; on a gramophone disc. Lenin sought to explain the phenomenon of antisemitism in Marxist terms. According to Lenin, antisemitism was an &quot;attempt to divert the hatred of the workers and peasants from the exploiters toward the Jews&quot;. Linking antisemitism to class struggle, he argued that it was merely a political technique used by the tsar to exploit religious fanaticism, popularize the despotic, unpopular regime, and divert popular anger toward a scapegoat. The Soviet Union also officially maintained this Marxist-Leninist interpretation under Joseph Stalin, who expounded Lenin&#x27;s critique of antisemitism. However, this did not prevent the widely publicized repressions of Jewish intellectuals during 1948–1953 when Stalin increasingly associated Jews with &quot;cosmopolitanism&quot; and pro-Americanism.

Jews were prominent in the Russian Constitutional Democrat Party, Russian Social Democratic Party (Mensheviks) and Socialist-Revolutionary Party. The Russian Anarchist movement also included many prominent Jewish revolutionaries. In Ukraine, Makhnovist anarchist leaders also included several Jews.

=== Dissolution and seizure of Jewish properties and institutions ===
In August 1919 Jewish properties, including synagogues, were seized and many Jewish communities were dissolved. New laws against all expressions of religion and religious education were imposed upon Jews and other religious groups. Many Rabbis and other religious officials were forced to resign from their posts under the threat of violent persecution. This type of persecution continued into the 1920s.

In 1921, a large number of Jews opted for Poland, as the Peace of Riga entitled them to choose the country they preferred. Several hundred thousand joined the already numerous Jewish population of Poland.

The chaotic years of World War I, the February and October Revolutions, and the Civil War were fertile ground for the antisemitism that was endemic to tsarist Russia. During the World War, Jews were often accused of sympathizing with Germany and often persecuted.

Pogroms were unleashed throughout the Russian Civil War, perpetrated by virtually every competing faction, from Polish and Ukrainian nationalists to the Red and White Armies. 31,071 civilian Jews were killed during documented pogroms throughout the former Russian Empire; the number of Jewish orphans exceeded 300,000. A majority of pogroms in Ukraine during 1918–1920 were perpetrated by the Ukrainian nationalists, miscellaneous bands and anti-Communist forces.

== Soviet Union ==

=== Before World War II ===

Continuing the policy of the Bolsheviks before the Revolution, Lenin and the Bolshevik Party strongly condemned the pogroms, including official denunciations in 1918 by the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars. Opposition to the pogroms and to manifestations of Russian antisemitism in this era were complicated by both the official Bolshevik policy of assimilationism towards all national and religious minorities, and concerns about overemphasizing Jewish concerns for fear of exacerbating popular antisemitism, as the White forces were openly identifying the Bolshevik regime with Jews.

Lenin recorded eight of his speeches on gramophone records in 1919. Only seven of these were later re-recorded and put on sale. The one suppressed in the Nikita Khrushchev era recorded Lenin&#x27;s feelings on antisemitism:

Despite the Soviet state&#x27;s official opposition to antisemitism, the spring of 1918 saw widespread anti-Jewish violence perpetrated by members of the Red Guard in the former Pale of Settlement. In February 1918, as Russian forces advanced on the capital of Petrograd, the Soviet government signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which stipulated that Russia would withdraw from World War I and cede large swaths of territory in eastern Russia to the German Empire. Even after the signing of the treaty, however, the Germans continued to advance and seize territory, as the Soviets had no choice but to retreat across Ukraine. At this point in the war, the Red Guard comprised mostly untrained workers and peasants with no overarching command structure, leaving the state with virtually no control over the volunteer forces. Between March and May 1918, various Red Guard squadrons, embittered by their military defeat and animated by revolutionary sentiment, attacked Jews in cities and towns across the Chernihiv region of Ukraine. One of the most brutal instances of this violence occurred in the city of Novhorod-Siverskyi, where it was reported that 88 Jews were killed and 11 injured in a pogrom incited by Red Guard soldiers. Similarly, after the successful capture of the city of Hlukhiv, the Red Guard murdered at least 100 Jews, whom the soldiers accused of being &#x27;exploiters of the proletariat.&#x27; In all, Jewish activist Nahum Gergel estimated that the Red forces were responsible for about 8.6% of pogroms during the years 1918–1922, while Ukrainian and White Army forces were responsible for 40% and 17.2%, respectively. 

Lenin was supported by the Labor Zionist (Poale Zion) movement, then under the leadership of Marxist theorist Ber Borochov, which was fighting for the creation of a Jewish workers&#x27; state in Palestine and also participated in the October Revolution (and in the Soviet political scene afterwards until being banned by Stalin in 1928). While Lenin remained opposed to outward forms of antisemitism (and all forms of racism), allowing Jewish people to rise to the highest offices in both party and state, certain historians such as Dmitri Volkogonov argue that the record of his government in this regard was highly uneven. A former official Soviet historian (turned staunch anti-communist), Volkogonov claims that Lenin was aware of pogroms carried out by units of the Red Army during the war with Poland, particularly those carried out by Semyon Budyonny&#x27;s troops, though the whole issue was effectively ignored. Volkogonov writes that &quot;While condemning antisemitism in general, Lenin was unable to analyze, let alone eradicate, its prevalence in Soviet society&quot;. Likewise, the hostility of the Soviet regime towards all religion made no exception for Judaism, and the 1921 campaign against religion saw the seizure of many synagogues (whether this should be regarded as antisemitism is a matter of definition—since Orthodox Christian churches received the same treatment). In any event, there was still a fair degree of tolerance for Jewish religious practice in the 1920s: in the Belarusian capital Minsk, for example, of the 657 synagogues existing in 1917, 547 were still functioning in 1930.

According to Zvi Gitelman: &quot;Never before in Russian history—and never subsequently has a government made such an effort to uproot and stamp out antisemitism.&quot;

According to the census of 1926, the total number of Jews in the USSR was 2,672,398—of whom 59% lived in Ukrainian SSR, 15.2% in Byelorussian SSR, 22% in Russian SFSR and 3.8% in other Soviet republics.

Russian Jews were long considered to be a non-native ethnic group among the Slavic Russians, and such categorization was solidified when ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union were categorized according to ethnicity (). In his 1913 theoretical work &quot;Marxism and the National Question&quot;, Stalin described Jews as &quot;not a living and active nation, but something mystical, intangible and supernatural. For, I repeat, what sort of nation, for instance, is a Jewish nation which consists of Georgian, Daghestanian, Russian, American and other Jews, the members of which do not understand each other (since they speak different languages), inhabit different parts of the globe, will never see each other, and will never act together, whether in time of peace or in time of war?!&quot; According to Stalin, who became the People&#x27;s Commissar for Nationalities Affairs after the revolution, to qualify as a nation, a minority was required to have a culture, a language, and a homeland.

Yiddish, rather than Hebrew, would be the national language, and proletarian socialist literature and arts would replace Judaism as the quintessence of culture. The use of Yiddish was strongly encouraged in the 1920s in areas of the USSR with substantial Jewish populations, especially in the Ukrainian and Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republics. Yiddish was one of the Belarusian SSR&#x27;s four official languages, alongside Belarusian, Russian, and Polish. The equality of the official languages was taken seriously. A visitor arriving at main train station of the Belarusian capital Minsk saw the city&#x27;s name written in all four languages above the main station entrance. Yiddish was a language of newspapers, magazines, book publishing, theater, radio, film, the post office, official correspondence, election materials, and even a Central Jewish Court. Yiddish writers like Sholem Aleichem and Mendele Mocher Seforim were celebrated in the 1920s as Soviet Jewish heroes.

Minsk had a public, state-supported Yiddish-language school system, extending from kindergarten to the Yiddish-language section of the Belarusian State University. Although Jewish students tended to switch to studying in Russian as they moved on to secondary and higher education, 55.3 percent of the city&#x27;s Jewish primary school students attended Yiddish-language schools in 1927. At its peak, the Soviet Yiddish-language school system had 160,000 students in it. Such was the prestige of Minsk&#x27;s Yiddish scholarship that researchers trained in Warsaw and Berlin applied for faculty positions at the university. All this leads historian Elissa Bemporad to conclude that this “very ordinary Jewish city” was in the 1920s “one of the world capitals of Yiddish language and culture.&quot;

Jews also played a disproportionate role in Belarusian politics through the Bolshevik Party&#x27;s Yiddish-language branch, the Yevsekstsia. Because there were few Jewish Bolsheviks before 1917 (with a few prominent exceptions like Zinoviev and Kamenev), the Yevsekstia&#x27;s leaders in the 1920s were largely former Bundists, who pursued as Bolsheviks their campaign for secular Jewish education and culture. Although for example only a bit over 40 percent of Minsk&#x27;s population was Jewish at the time, 19 of its 25 Communist Party cell secretaries were Jewish in 1924. Jewish predominance in the party cells was such that several cell meetings were held in Yiddish. In fact, Yiddish was spoken at citywide party meetings in Minsk into the late 1930s.

To offset the growing Jewish national and religious aspirations of Zionism and to successfully categorize Soviet Jews under Stalin&#x27;s definition of nationality, an alternative to the Land of Israel was established with the help of Komzet and OZET in 1928. The Jewish Autonomous Oblast with its center in Birobidzhan in the Russian Far East was to become a &quot;Soviet Zion&quot;. Despite a massive domestic and international state propaganda campaign, however, the Jewish population in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast never reached 30% (in 2003 it was only about 1.2%). The experiment ground to a halt in the mid-1930s, during Stalin&#x27;s first campaign of purges.

In fact the Bolshevik Party&#x27;s Yiddish-language Yevsekstia was dissolved in 1930, as part of the regime&#x27;s overall turn away from encouraging minority languages and cultures and towards Russification. Many Jewish leaders, especially those with Bundist backgrounds, were arrested and executed in the purges later in the 1930s, and Yiddish schools were shut down. The Belasusian SSR shut down its entire network of Yiddish-language schools in 1938.

In his January 12, 1931, letter &quot;Antisemitism: Reply to an Inquiry of the Jewish News Agency in the United States&quot; (published domestically by &quot;Pravda&quot; in 1936), Stalin officially condemned antisemitism:
In answer to your inquiry: National and racial chauvinism is a vestige of the misanthropic customs characteristic of the period of cannibalism. Antisemitism, as an extreme form of racial chauvinism, is the most dangerous vestige of cannibalism.
 Antisemitism is of advantage to the exploiters as a lightning conductor that deflects the blows aimed by the working people at capitalism. Antisemitism is dangerous for the working people as being a false path that leads them off the right road and lands them in the jungle. Hence Communists, as consistent internationalists, cannot but be irreconcilable, sworn enemies of antisemitism.
 In the U.S.S.R. antisemitism is punishable with the utmost severity of the law as a phenomenon deeply hostile to the Soviet system. Under U.S.S.R. law active antisemites are liable to the death penalty.

The Molotov–Ribbentrop pact—the 1939 non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany—created further suspicion regarding the Soviet Union&#x27;s position toward Jews. According to the pact, Poland, the nation with the world&#x27;s largest Jewish population, was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union in September 1939. While the pact had no basis in ideological sympathy (as evidenced by Nazi propaganda about &quot;Jewish Bolshevism&quot;), Germany&#x27;s occupation of Western Poland was a disaster for Eastern European Jews. Evidence suggests that some, at least, of the Jews in the eastern Soviet zone of occupation welcomed the Russians as having a more liberated policy towards their civil rights than the preceding antisemitic Polish regime. Jews in areas annexed by the Soviet Union were deported eastward in great waves; as these areas would soon be invaded by Nazi Germany, this forced migration, deplored by many of its victims, paradoxically also saved the lives of several hundred thousand Jewish deportees.

Jews who escaped the purges include Lazar Kaganovich, who came to Stalin&#x27;s attention in the 1920s as a successful bureaucrat in Tashkent and participated in the purges of the 1930s. Kaganovich&#x27;s loyalty endured even after Stalin&#x27;s death, when he and Molotov were expelled from the party ranks in 1957 due to their opposition to destalinization.

Beyond longstanding controversies, ranging from the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact to anti-Zionism, the Soviet Union did grant official &quot;equality of all citizens regardless of status, sex, race, religion, and nationality&quot;. The years before the Holocaust were an era of rapid change for Soviet Jews, leaving behind the dreadful poverty of the Pale of Settlement. Forty percent of the population in the former Pale left for large cities within the USSR.

Emphasis on education and movement from countryside &quot;shtetls&quot; to newly industrialized cities allowed many Soviet Jews to enjoy overall advances under Stalin and to become one of the most educated population groups in the world.

Because of Stalinist emphasis on its urban population, interwar migration inadvertently rescued countless Soviet Jews; Nazi Germany penetrated the entire former Jewish Pale—but were kilometers short of Leningrad and Moscow. The migration of many Jews farther East from the Jewish Pale, which would become occupied by Nazi Germany, saved at least 40 percent of the Pale&#x27;s original Jewish population.

By 1941, it was estimated that the Soviet Union was home to 4.855 million Jews, around 30% of all Jews worldwide. However, the majority of these were residents of rural western Belarus and Ukraine—populations that suffered greatly due to the German occupation and the Holocaust. Only around 800,000 Jews lived outside the occupied territory, and 1,200,000 to 1,400,000 Jews were eventually evacuated eastwards. Of the three million left in occupied areas, the vast majority is thought to have perished in German extermination camps.

=== World War II and the Holocaust ===


Over two million Soviet Jews are believed to have died during the Holocaust, second only to the number of Polish Jews who fell victim to Hitler (see The Holocaust in Poland). Among some of the larger massacres which were committed in 1941 were: 33,771 Jews of Kiev shot in ditches at Babi Yar; 100,000 Jews and Poles of Vilnius killed in the forests of Ponary, 20,000 Jews killed in Kharkiv at Drobnitzky Yar, 36,000 Jews machine-gunned in Odessa, 25,000 Jews of Riga killed in the woods at Rumbula, and 10,000 Jews slaughtered in Simferopol in the Crimea. Although mass shootings continued through 1942, most notably 16,000 Jews shot at Pinsk, Jews were increasingly shipped to concentration camps in German Nazi-occupied Poland.

Local residents of German-occupied areas, especially Ukrainians, Lithuanians, and Latvians, sometimes played key roles in the genocide of other Latvians, Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Slavs, Romani, homosexuals and Jews alike. Under the Nazi occupation, some members of the Ukrainian and Latvian Nazi police carried out deportations in the Warsaw Ghetto, and Lithuanians marched Jews to their death at Ponary. Even as some assisted the Germans, a significant number of individuals in the territories under German control also helped Jews escape death (&quot;see Righteous Among the Nations&quot;). In Latvia, particularly, the number of Nazi-collaborators was only slightly more than that of Jewish saviours. It is estimated that up to 1.4 million Jews fought in Allied armies; 40% of them in the Red Army. In total, at least 142,500 Soviet soldiers of Jewish nationality lost their lives fighting against the German invaders and their allies
The typical Soviet policy regarding the Holocaust was to present it as against Soviet citizens, not emphasizing the genocide of the Jews. For example, after the liberation of Kiev from the Nazi occupation, the &quot;Extraordinary State Commission&quot; (Чрезвычайная Государственная Комиссия; &quot;Chrezv&#x27;chaynaya Gosudarstvennaya Komissiya&quot;) was set out to investigate Nazi crimes. The description of the Babi Yar massacre was officially censored as follows:


=== Stalinist antisemitic campaigns ===
The revival of Jewish identity after the war, stimulated by the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, was cautiously welcomed by Stalin as a means to put pressure on Western imperialism in the Middle East, but when it became evident that many Soviet Jews expected the revival of Zionism to enhance their own aspirations for separate cultural and religious development in the Soviet Union, a wave of repression was unleashed.

In January 1948 Solomon Mikhoels, a popular actor-director of the Moscow State Jewish Theater and the chairman of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, was killed in a suspicious car accident. Mass arrests of prominent Jewish intellectuals and suppression of Jewish culture followed under the banners of campaign against &quot;rootless cosmopolitans&quot; and anti-Zionism. On August 12, 1952, in the event known as the Night of the Murdered Poets, thirteen of the most prominent Yiddish writers, poets, actors and other intellectuals were executed on the orders of Joseph Stalin, among them Peretz Markish, Leib Kvitko, David Hofstein, Itzik Feffer and David Bergelson. In the 1955 United Nations General Assembly&#x27;s session a high Soviet official still denied the &quot;rumors&quot; about their disappearance.

The Doctors&#x27; Plot allegation in 1953 was a deliberately antisemitic policy: Stalin targeted &quot;corrupt Jewish bourgeois nationalists&quot;, eschewing the usual code words like &quot;rootless cosmopolitans&quot; or &quot;cosmopolitans&quot;. Stalin died, however, before this next wave of arrests and executions could be launched in earnest. A number of historians claim that the Doctors&#x27; Plot was intended as the opening of a campaign that would have resulted in the mass deportation of Soviet Jews had Stalin not died on March 5, 1953. Days after Stalin&#x27;s death the plot was declared a hoax by the Soviet government.

These cases may have reflected Stalin&#x27;s paranoia, rather than state ideology—a distinction that made no practical difference as long as Stalin was alive, but which became salient on his death.

In April 1956, the Warsaw Yiddish language Jewish newspaper &quot;Folkshtimme&quot; published sensational long lists of Soviet Jews who had perished before and after the Holocaust. The world press began demanding answers from Soviet leaders, as well as inquiring about the current condition of the Jewish education system and culture. The same autumn, a group of leading Jewish world figures publicly requested the heads of Soviet state to clarify the situation. Since no cohesive answer was received, their concern was only heightened. The fate of Soviet Jews emerged as a major human rights issue in the West.

=== The Soviet Union and Zionism ===

Marxist anti-nationalism and anti-clericalism had a mixed effect on Soviet Jews. Jews were the immediate benefactors, but they were also long-term victims, of the Marxist notion that any manifestation of nationalism is &quot;socially retrogressive&quot;. On one hand, Jews were liberated from the religious persecution of the Tsarist years of &quot;Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality&quot;. On the other, this notion was threatening to Jewish cultural institutions, the Bund, Jewish autonomy, Judaism and Zionism.

Political Zionism was officially stamped out as a form of bourgeois nationalism during the entire history of the Soviet Union. Although Leninism emphasizes the belief in &quot;self-determination&quot;, this fact did not make the Soviet state more accepting of Zionism. Leninism defines self-determination by territory or culture, rather than by religion, which allowed Soviet minorities to have separate oblasts, autonomous regions, or republics, which were nonetheless symbolic until its later years. Jews, however, did not fit such a theoretical model; Jews in the Diaspora did not even have an agricultural base, as Stalin often asserted when he attempted to deny the existence of a Jewish nation, and they certainly did not have a territorial unit. Marxist notions even denied the existence of a Jewish identity beyond the existence of a religion and caste; Marx defined Jews as a &quot;chimerical nation&quot;.
Lenin, who claimed to be deeply committed to egalitarian ideals and the universality of all humanity, rejected Zionism as a reactionary movement, &quot;bourgeois nationalism&quot;, &quot;socially retrogressive&quot;, and a backward force that deprecates class divisions among Jews. Moreover, Zionism entailed contact between Soviet citizens and westerners, which was dangerous in a closed society. Soviet authorities were likewise fearful of any mass-movement which was independent of the monopolistic Communist Party, and not tied to the state or the ideology of Marxism-Leninism.

Without changing his official anti-Zionist stance, from late 1944 until 1948 Joseph Stalin adopted a &quot;de facto&quot; pro-Zionist foreign policy, apparently believing that the new country would be socialist and hasten the decline of British influence in the Middle East.

In a May 14, 1947 speech during the UN Partition Plan debate, published in &quot;Izvestiya&quot; two days later, the Soviet ambassador Andrei Gromyko announced:

Soviet approval in the United Nations Security Council was critical to the UN partitioning of the British Mandate of Palestine, which led to the founding of the State of Israel.
Three days after Israel declared its independence, the Soviet Union legally recognized it de jure. In addition, the USSR allowed Czechoslovakia to continue supplying arms to the Jewish forces during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, even though this conflict took place after the Soviet-supported Czechoslovak coup d&#x27;état of 1948. At the time, the U.S. maintained an arms embargo on both sides in the conflict. See Arms shipments from Czechoslovakia to Israel 1947–1949.

By the end of 1957 the USSR switched sides in the Arab–Israeli conflict and throughout the course of the Cold War unequivocally supported various Arab regimes against Israel. The official position of the Soviet Union and its satellite states and agencies was that Zionism was a tool used by the Jews and Americans for &quot;racist imperialism&quot;.

As Israel was emerging as a close Western ally, the specter of Zionism raised fears of internal dissent and opposition. During the later parts of the Cold War, Soviet Jews were suspected of being possible traitors, Western sympathisers, or a security liability. The Communist leadership closed down various Jewish organizations and declared Zionism an ideological enemy. Synagogues were often placed under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of informers.

As a result of the persecution, both state-sponsored and unofficial, antisemitism was ingrained in the society and remained for years: ordinary Soviet Jews often suffered hardships, epitomized by often not being allowed to enlist in universities, work in certain professions, or participate in government. However, it should be mentioned that this was not always the case and this kind of persecution varied depending on the region. Still many Jews felt compelled to hide their identities by changing their names.

The word &quot;Jew&quot; was also avoided in the media when criticising undertakings by Israel, which the Soviets often accused of racism, chauvinism etc. Instead of &quot;Jew&quot;, the word &quot;Israeli&quot; was used almost exclusively, so as to paint its harsh criticism not as antisemitism but anti-Zionism. More controversially, the Soviet media, when depicting political events, sometimes used the term &#x27;fascism&#x27; to characterise Israeli nationalism (e.g. calling Jabotinsky a &#x27;fascist&#x27;, and claiming &#x27;new fascist organisations were emerging in Israel in the 1970s&#x27; etc.).

=== 1967–1985 ===

According to the census of 1959 the Jewish population of the city of Leningrad numbered 169,000 and the Great Choral synagogue was open in the 1960s with some 1,200 seats. The rabbi was Avraham Lubanov. This synagogue has never been closed. The great majority of the Leningrad Jews were not religious, but several thousand used to visit the synagogue on great holidays, mostly on Simchat Torah.

A mass emigration was politically undesirable for the Soviet regime. As increasing numbers of Soviet Jews applied to emigrate to Israel in the period following the 1967 Six-Day War, many were formally refused permission to leave. A typical excuse given by the &quot;OVIR&quot; (ОВиР), the MVD department responsible for the provisioning of exit visas, was that persons who had been given access at some point in their careers to information vital to Soviet national security could not be allowed to leave the country.

After the Dymshits–Kuznetsov hijacking affair in 1970 and the crackdown that followed, strong international condemnations caused the Soviet authorities to increase the emigration quota. From 1960 to 1970, only 4,000 people left the USSR; in the following decade, the number rose to 250,000.

In 1972, the USSR imposed the so-called &quot;diploma tax&quot; on would-be emigrants who received higher education in the USSR. In some cases, the fee was as high as twenty annual salaries. This measure was possibly designed to combat the brain drain caused by the growing emigration of Soviet Jews and other members of the intelligentsia to the West. Although Jews now made up less than 1% of the population, some surveys have suggested that around one-third of the emigrating Jews had achieved some form of higher education. Furthermore, Jews holding positions requiring specialized training tended to be highly concentrated in a small set of specialties, including medicine, mathematics, biology and music. Following international protests, the Kremlin soon revoked the tax, but continued to sporadically impose various limitations. Besides, an unofficial Jewish quota was introduced in the leading institutions of higher education by subjecting Jewish applicants to harsher entrance examinations.

At first almost all of those who managed to get exit visas to Israel actually made aliyah, but after the mid-1970s, most of those allowed to leave for Israel actually chose other destinations, most notably the United States.

=== Glasnost and end of the USSR ===
In 1989 a record 71,000 Soviet Jews were granted exodus from the USSR, of whom only 12,117 immigrated to Israel. At first, American policy treated Soviet Jews as refugees and allowed unlimited numbers to emigrate, but this policy eventually came to an end. As a result, more Jews began moving to Israel, as it was the only country willing to take them unconditionally.

In the 1980s, the liberal government of Mikhail Gorbachev allowed unlimited Jewish emigration, and the Soviet Union itself collapsed in 1991. As a result, a mass emigration of Jews from the former Soviet Union took place. Since the 1970s, over 1.1 million Russians of Jewish origin immigrated to Israel, of whom 100,000 emigrated to third countries such as the United States and Canada soon afterward and 240,000 were not considered Jewish under &quot;Halakha&quot;, but were eligible under the Law of Return due to Jewish ancestry or marriage. Since the adoption of the Jackson–Vanik amendment, over 600,000 Soviet Jews have emigrated.

=== Modern-day Russia ===

Judaism today is officially designated as one of Russia&#x27;s four &quot;traditional religions&quot;, alongside Orthodox Christianity, Islam and Buddhism. However, the Jewish community continues to decrease rapidly, going from 232,267 people in the 2002 census to 83,896 in 2021, not counting 500 Crimean Karaites, of which 28,119 lived in Moscow and 5,111 lived in the surrounding Moscow Oblast for a total of 33,230, or 39.61% of the entire Russian Jewish population. A further 9,215 lived in Saint-Petersburg with 851 in the surrounding Leningrad Oblast for a total of 10,066, or 12.00% of the entire Russian Jewish population; thus, Russia&#x27;s two largest cities and surrounding areas hosted 51.61% of the total Russian Jewish population.
The third most populous community was Crimea, which had a population of 2,522 (of which 864 Krymchaks) in the Autonomous Republic in addition to 517 (including 35 Krymchaks) in Sevastopol, for a total of 3,039 (of which 29.58% Krymchaks), not counting 215 Crimean Karaites. This amounts to 3.62% of the total Russian Jewish population.

After Crimea, the most numerically significant populations were Sverdlovsk with 2,354 (2.81%) and Samara, with 2,266 (2.70%), followed by Tatarstan with 1,792 (2.14%), Rostov Oblast with 1,690 (2.01%), Chelyabinsk with 1,677 (2.00%), Krasnodar Krai with 1,620 (1.93%), Stavropol with 1,614 (1.92%), Nizhny Novgorod with 1,473 (1.76%), Bashkortostan with 1,209 (1.44%), Saratov with 1,151 (1.37%) and Novosibirsk with 1,150 (1.37%). The remaining 20,565 (24.52%) of Russian Jews lived in regions with communities numbering fewer than 1,000 Jews.

Despite being designated as a Jewish oblast, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast has only 837 self-identifying Jews, or 0.56% of the total population of the Autonomous Oblast. This is down 64.03% from the 2,327 recorded in the 2002 census, or 1.22% of the Oblast&#x27;s population at the time.
As of the 2021 census, most Russian Jews are Ashkenazi (82,644 of the 83,896 total, or 98.51%). The second largest community are the Krymchaks, who numbered 954, or 1.14% of the Jewish population. There were 266 Mountain Jews (0.32%) and some Bukharan and Georgian Jews, who numbered 18 (0.02%) and 14 (0.02%) respectively. In addition to this, there were 500 Crimean Karaites, who have historically not identified as Jews.

Most Crimean Karaites lived in Crimea (215, or 43.00%) or Moscow (60); most Krymchaks lived in Crimea (864, or 90.57% of the total) or Sebastopol (35, or 3.68%) meaning 899, or 94.23% of the Russian Krymchak population, still lives on the Crimean peninsula, largely rurally. The Crimean Karaite population in Crimea has declined by well over 50% since the Ukrainian census of 2001. Conversely, most Juhurim have left the Caucasus region, and the largest single community still in Russia (84, 31.58%) is found in Moscow. Of the Jewish populations remaining in the northern Caucasus, most are now Ashkenazi, with only a few being Mountain Jews. There are still 145 Mountain Jews scattered throughout the northern Caucasus, of which 60 are in Dagestan (amounting to 6.49% of the republic&#x27;s Jewish population), 47 are in Kabardino-Balkaria (6.02%), 29 are in Stavropol (1.80%), 6 are in Krasnodar (0.37%) and 3 are in Adygea (2.24%). There are no Mountain Jews remaining in Chechnya, Ingushetia, North Ossetia-Alania or Karachay-Cherkessia.

Most Russian Jews are secular and identify themselves as Jews via ethnicity rather than religion, although interest about Jewish identity as well as practice of Jewish tradition amongst Russian Jews is growing. The Lubavitcher Jewish Movement has been active in this sector, setting up synagogues and Jewish kindergartens in Russian cities with Jewish populations. In addition, most Russian Jews have relatives who live in Israel.

There are several major Jewish organizations in the territories of the former USSR. The central Jewish organization is the Federation of Jewish Communities of the CIS under the leadership of Chief Rabbi Berel Lazar.
A linguistic distinction remains to this day in the Russian language where there are two distinct terms that correspond to the word &quot;Jew&quot; in English. The word &quot;еврей&quot; (&quot;yevrey&quot; – Hebrew) typically denotes a Jewish ethnicity, as &quot;Hebrew&quot; did in English up until the early 20th century. The word &quot;иудей&quot; (&quot;iudey&quot; – Judean, etymologically related to the English &quot;Jew&quot;) is reserved for denoting a follower of the Jewish religion, whether he or she is ethnically Jewish or ethnically Gentile; this term has largely fallen out of use in favor of the equivalent term &quot;иудаист&quot; (&quot;iudaist&quot;-Judaist). For example, according to a 2012 Russian survey, &quot;евреи&quot; account for only 32.2% of &quot;иудаисты&quot; in Russia, with nearly half (49.8%) being Ethnic Russians (&quot;русские&quot;). An ethnic slur, жид (borrowed from the Polish &quot;Żyd&quot;, Jew), also remains in widespread use in Russia.

Antisemitism is one of the most common expressions of xenophobia in post-Soviet Russia, even among some groups of politicians, despite laws against fomenting hatred based on ethnic or religious grounds (Article 282 of Russian Federation Penal Code). In 2002, the number of antisemitic neo-Nazi groups in the republics of the former Soviet Union, led &quot;Pravda&quot; to declare in 2002 that &quot;Anti-Semitism is booming in Russia&quot;. In January 2005, a group of 15 Duma members demanded that Judaism and Jewish organizations be banned from Russia. In 2005, 500 prominent Russians, including some 20 members of the nationalist Rodina party, demanded that the state prosecutor investigate ancient Jewish texts as &quot;anti-Russian&quot; and ban Judaism. An investigation was in fact launched, but halted after an international outcry.
Overall, in recent years, particularly since the early 2000s, levels of antisemitism in Russia have been reportedly low, and steadily decreasing. In 2019, Ilya Yablogov wrote that many Russians were keen on antisemitic conspiracy theories in 1990s but it declined after 2000 and many high-ranking officials were forced to apologize for the antisemitic behavior.

In Russia, both historical and contemporary antisemitic materials are frequently published. For example, a set (called &quot;Library of a Russian Patriot&quot;) consisting of twenty five antisemitic titles was recently published, including &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; translated to Russian (2002), which although was banned in 2010, &quot;The Myth of Holocaust&quot; by Jürgen Graf, a title by Douglas Reed, &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, and others.
Antisemitic incidents are mostly conducted by extremist, nationalist, and Islamist groups. Most of the antisemitic incidents are against Jewish cemeteries and buildings (such as community centers and synagogues) such as the assault against the Jewish community&#x27;s center in Perm in March 2013 and the attack on Jewish nursery school in Volgograd in August 2013. Nevertheless, there were several violent attacks against Jews in Moscow in 2006 when a neo-Nazi stabbed 9 people at the Bolshaya Bronnaya Synagogue, the failed bomb attack on the same synagogue in 1999.

Attacks against Jews made by extremist Islamic groups are rare in Russia although there has been increase in the scope of the attacks mainly in Muslim populated areas. On July 25, 2013, the rabbi of Derbent was attacked and badly injured by an unknown person near his home, most likely by a terrorist. The incident sparked concerns among the local Jews of further acts against the Jewish community.

After the passage of some anti-gay laws in Russia in 2013 and the incident with the &quot;Pussy-riot&quot; band in 2012 causing a growing criticism on the subject inside and outside Russia a number of verbal antisemitic attacks were made against Russian gay activists by extremist activists and antisemitic writers such as Israel Shamir who viewed the &quot;Pussy-riot&quot; incident as the war of Judaism on the Christian Orthodox church.

Today, the Jewish population of Russia is shrinking due to small family sizes, and high rates of assimilation and intermarriage. This shrinkage has been slowed by some Russian-Jewish emigrants having returned from abroad, especially from Germany. The great majority of up to 90% of children born to a Jewish parent are the offspring of mixed marriages, and most Jews have only one or two children.

The EuroStars young adults program provides Jewish learning and social activities in 32 cities across Russia. Some have described a &#x27;renaissance&#x27; in the Jewish community inside Russia since the beginning of the 21st century.

The Chief Rabbi of Russia, Rabbi Berel Lazar, spoke out against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, called Russia to withdraw and for an end to the war, and offered to mediate. The Chief Rabbi of Moscow, Pinchas Goldschmidt, left Russia after he refused a request from state officials to publicly support the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 30 June 2023, Goldschmidt was designated in Russia as a foreign agent.

== Historical demographics ==




== Russian Jewish aliyah and immigration to countries outside Israel ==
=== Israel ===

In present times, the largest number of Russian Jews are &quot;olim&quot; (עוֹלים) and &quot;sabras&quot;. In 2011 Russians were around 15% of Israel&#x27;s 7.7 million population (including Halakhally non-Jews who constituted about 30% of immigrants from the former Soviet Union). The Aliyah in the 1990s accounts for 85–90% of this population.
The population growth rate for Former Soviet Union (FSU)-born &quot;olim&quot; were among the lowest for any Israeli groups, with a Fertility rate of 1.70 and natural increase of just +0.5% per year. The increase in Jewish birth rate in Israel during the 2000–2007 period was partly due to the increasing birth rate among the FSU &quot;olim&quot;, who now form 20% of the Jewish population of Israel.
96.5% of the enlarged Russian Jewish population in Israel either belong to Judaism or are non-religious, while 3.5% (35,000) belong to other religions (mostly Christianity) and about 10,000 identifying as Messianic Jews separate from Jewish Christians.

The Total Fertility Rate for FSU-born &quot;olim&quot; in Israel is given in the table below. The TFR increased with time, peaking in 1997, then slightly decreased after that and then again increased after 2000.

In 1999, about 1,037,000 FSU-born &quot;olim&quot; lived in Israel, of whom about 738,900 made aliyah after 1989. The second largest &quot;oleh&quot; (עוֹלֶה) group (Moroccan Jews) numbered just 1,000,000. From 2000 to 2006, 142,638 FSU-born &quot;olim&quot; moved to Israel, while 70,000 of them emigrated from Israel to countries like the U.S. and Canada—bringing the total population to 1,150,000 by
January 2007. The natural increase was around 0.3% in the late 1990s. For example, 2,456 in 1996 (7,463 births to 5,007 deaths), 2,819 in 1997 (8,214 to 5,395), 2,959 in 1998 (8,926 to 5,967) and 2,970 in 1999 (9,282 to 6,312). In 1999, the natural growth was +0.385%. (Figures only for FSU-born &quot;olim&quot; moved in after 1989).

An estimated 45,000 illegal immigrants from the Former Soviet Union lived in Israel at the end of 2010, but it is not clear how many of them are actually Jews.

In 2013, 7,520 people, nearly 40% of all &quot;olim&quot;, made &quot;aliyah&quot; from the Former Soviet Union. In 2014 4,685 Russian citizens relocated to Israel, more than double than usual in any of the previous 16 years. In 2015, nearly 7,000 or just over twenty percent of all olim came from the former Soviet Union. As a consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Jewish Agency reported in March 2022 that hundreds of Jewish refugees sheltering in Poland, Romania and Moldova were scheduled to leave for Israel the following week. Of an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 Jews in Ukraine, over 26.3% have fled the country; between 10,000 and 15,200 refugees had arrived in Israel. In September 2023 it was reported that over 43,000 Jews from Russia and over 15,000 Jews from Ukraine have fled to Israel. By August 2024, out of an estimated 30,000 Jews who immigrated to Israel since 7 October 2023, 17,000 Jews were from Russia and 900 Jews from Ukraine. One estimate in 2024 is that at current rates within 7 years 50% of Jewish population in Russia will have moved to Israel.

Recent &quot;olim&quot; and &quot;olot&quot; (עוֹלות) from the Former Soviet Union include notables such as Anna Zak, Natan Sharansky, Yuri Foreman, Yuli-Yoel Edelstein, Ze&#x27;ev Elkin, Nachman Dushanski, Boris Gelfand, Natasha Mozgovaya, Avigdor Lieberman, Roman Dzindzichashvili, Anastassia Michaeli, Haim Megrelashvili, Victor Mikhalevski, Evgeny Postny, Maxim Rodshtein, Tatiana Zatulovskaya, Maria Gorokhovskaya, Katia Pisetsky, Aleksandr Averbukh, Anna Smashnova, Jan Talesnikov, Vadim Alexeev, Michael Kolganov, Alexander Danilov, Evgenia Linetskaya, Marina Kravchenko, David Kazhdan, Leonid Nevzlin, Vadim Akolzin, Roman Bronfman, Michael Cherney, Arcadi Gaydamak, Sergei Sakhnovski, Roman Zaretski, Alexandra Zaretski, Larisa Trembovler, Boris Tsirelson, Ania Bukstein, and Margarita Levieva.

=== United States ===

The second largest Russian Jewish population is in the United States. According to RINA, there is a core Russian Jewish population of 350,000 in the U.S. The enlarged Russian Jewish population in the U.S. is estimated to be 700,000.

Notable Russia, Imperial Russia, Soviet Union, and former Soviet Union, born Jewish Americans (living and deceased) include Alexei Abrikosov, Isaac Asimov, Leonard Blavatnik, Sergey Brin, Joseph Brodsky, Sergei Dovlatov, Anthony Fedorov, Israel Gelfand, Emma Goldman, Vladimir Horowitz, Gregory Kaidanov, Avi Kaplan, Anna Khachiyan, Jan Koum, Savely Kramarov, Mila Kunis, Leonid Levin, Lev Loseff, Alexander Migdal, Eugene Mirman, Alla Nazimova, Leonard Nimoy, Ayn Rand, Markus Rothkovich (Mark Rothko), Dmitry Salita, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Yakov Sinai, Mikhail Shifman, Mikhail Shufutinsky, Regina Spektor, Willi Tokarev, and Arkady Vainshtein.

Large Russian Jewish communities include Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay in the Brooklyn Borough of New York City; Fair Lawn and nearby areas in Bergen County, New Jersey; Bucks and Montgomery Counties near Philadelphia; Pikesville, Maryland, a predominantly-Jewish suburb of Baltimore; Washington Heights in the Sunny Isles Beach neighborhood of South Florida; Skokie and Buffalo Grove, suburbs of Chicago; and West Hollywood, California.

=== Germany ===
The fourth largest Russian-Jewish community exists in Germany with a core Russian-Jewish population of 119,000 and an enlarged population of 250,000.

In the 1991–2006 period, approximately 230,000 ethnic Jews from the FSU immigrated to Germany. In the beginning of 2006, Germany tightened the immigration program. A survey conducted among approximately 215,000 enlarged Russian Jewish population (taking natural decrease into consideration) indicated that about 81% of the enlarged population was religiously Jewish or Atheist, while about 18.5% identified as Christian. That gives a core Russian Jewish population of 111,800 (religiously Jewish, 52%) or 174,150 (religiously Jewish or Atheist).

Notable Russian Jews in Germany include Valery Belenky, Maxim Biller, Friedrich Gorenstein, Wladimir Kaminer, Lev Kopelev, Elena Kuschnerova, Alfred Schnittke, Vladimir Voinovich, and Lilya Zilberstein.

=== Canada ===
The fifth largest Russian Jewish community is in Canada. The core Russian Jewish population in Canada numbers 30,000 and the enlarged Russian Jewish population numbered 50,000+, mostly in Montreal and Toronto. Notable Russian Jewish residents include judoka Mark Berger, ice hockey player Eliezer Sherbatov, voice actress Tara Strong, and the musical group Tasseomancy.

=== Australia ===
Jews from the former Soviet Union settled in Australia in two migration waves in the 1970s and 1990s. About 5,000 immigrated in the 1970s and 7,000 to 8,000 in the 1990s. The estimated population of Jews from the former Soviet Union in Australia is 10,000 to 11,000, constituting about 10% of the Australian Jewish population. About half of the Jews from the former Soviet Union are from Ukraine and a third from the Russian Federation.

=== Finland ===
Hundreds of Russian Jews have moved to Finland since 1990 and have helped to stem the negative population growth of the Jewish community there. The total number of Jews in Finland have grown from 800 in 1980 to 1,200 in 2006. Of all the schoolgoing Jewish children, 75% have at least one Russian born parent.

=== Other countries ===
Austria, Belgium, Britain, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand and Switzerland also have small populations of Russian Jews. The addition of Russian Jews have neutralized the negative Jewish population trends in some European countries like the Netherlands and Austria. Notable Russian Jews in France include Léon Bakst, Marc Chagall, Leon Poliakov, Evgeny Kissin, Alexandre Koyré, Ida Rubinstein, Lev Shestov, and Anatoly Vaisser. Some other notable Russian Jews are Roman Abramovich, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Boris Berezovsky, and Maxim Vengerov (United Kingdom), Gennadi Sosonko (Netherlands), Viktor Korchnoi (Switzerland), and Maya Plisetskaya (Spain).

<doc id="210716" wikidata="Q2580029" url="?curid=210716" title="Canon d'Infanterie de 37 modèle 1916 TRP">
<text>The &quot;Canon d&#x27;Infanterie de&quot; 37 &quot;modèle&quot; 1916 TRP (37mm mle.1916) was a French infantry support gun, first used during World War I. TRP stands for &quot;tir rapide, Puteaux&quot; (&quot;fast-firing&quot;, designed by the Puteaux arsenal). The tactical purpose of this gun was the destruction of machine gun nests. 

It was also used on aircraft such as the Beardmore W.B.V and the Salmson-Moineau. Fighter ace René Fonck used a 37mm mle.1916 on a SPAD S.XII.

==Description==
A gun fitted with a [[gun shield]], [[Flash suppressor]] and wheels, displayed at the [[United States Army Ordnance Museum]], 2007 / transferred to [[U.S. Army Armor &amp; Cavalry Collection]]], [[Fort Moore]]
The &quot;modèle 1916&quot; gun&#x27;s 37mm caliber was the smallest allowed for explosive shells under the 1899 Hague Convention and hence was used by many nations for small guns.

The guns were fitted to a tripod, to which wheels could be attached for transport. The guns could also be carried by four soldiers, after being broken down into two loads: the gun and recoil mechanism, and the trails, each of which could be carried by two soldiers. Some were equipped with a gun shield.
The breech-block of the gun was essentially a smaller version of that fitted to the well-known French 75 gun.

The guns could be crewed by two soldiers, a loader and an aimer, and had a maximum rate of fire of around 35 rounds per minute. They were equipped with a removable APX telescopic sight for direct fire, and a quadrant sight for indirect fire.

In U.S. service, each gun was assigned an ammunition limber, which carried 14 boxes containing 16 rounds of ammunition each as well as tools and accessories. The gun and its limber were normally together towed by a single horse or mule, but were manhandled forward if contact with the enemy was expected.

U.S. high explosive ammunition for the TRP was the Mark II HE shell with a projectile weighing and a TNT bursting charge of 27.2 grams. The French Army used the &quot;Obus explosif Mle1916&quot; HE round with a projectile weighing and a bursting charge of 30 grams. Captured rounds of this type were designated &quot;Sprgr 147(f)&quot; by the German military in World War II.

==Service history==

During the First World War, the guns saw widespread use with both French and United States forces and were designated the
37mm M1916 in U.S. service. In combat they were found to be wanting, and it was found their intended task of destroying gun emplacements was better done by mortars. As well as infantry use, the guns were also fitted to the M1917 light tank, the first mass-produced U.S. tank. These tanks entered service too late for World War I, and none ever saw action.
During the interwar years the U.S. Army organized its infantry regiments with &quot;howitzer companies,&quot; armed, with among other heavy infantry weapons for want of actual infantry support howitzers, 37 mm M1916 guns. The Regular Army could not afford to maintain full companies (instead using platoons), but the National Guard could. The Army adopted a .22 caliber sub-caliber device as an economic measure that allowed training with the guns on indoor ranges. By 1941, the howitzer companies of regiments were disbanded and converted to antitank platoons; the Army put most of the M1916 guns into storage, scrapped them, or converted their mechanisms for use as sub-caliber training devices for heavy guns. Some were used in the Philippines campaign in 1941-42 as antitank weapons due to shortages of the 37 mm gun M3. The Japanese Type 11 37 mm infantry gun was based on this design.

The French Army still had the cannon in service in 1940 as a substitute for the 25 mm Hotchkiss anti-tank gun, which was in short supply. After the defeat of France by Germany, the Wehrmacht began using the TRP under the designation &quot;3.7 cm IG 152(f)&quot;.

Some were used by the Việt Minh at the beginning of the First Indochina War.

==Aircraft use==
The gun was fitted on some aircraft, firing through the propeller&#x27;s spinner to avoid hitting the blades. It was used in combat on the 1917 French SPAD S.XII. The prototype 1917 British Beardmore W.B.V shipborne fighter was fitted with a 37mm for use against airships, but the gun was considered dangerous and removed.

<text>The Colbys (originally titled Dynasty II: The Colbys) is an American prime time soap opera that originally aired on ABC from November 20, 1985, to March 26, 1987. Created by Richard and Esther Shapiro and Eileen and Robert Pollock and produced by Aaron Spelling, it is a spin-off of &quot;Dynasty&quot; and revolves around the Colbys, another vastly wealthy family who own a large multinational conglomerate and are connected to the Carringtons of &quot;Dynasty&quot;. Intended to surpass its predecessor in opulence, the series&#x27; producers were handed an immensely high budget for the era, and cast a handful of well-known movie stars among its leads.

&quot;The Colbys&quot; stars Charlton Heston as tycoon Jason Colby, Barbara Stanwyck as his sister Constance, Stephanie Beacham as his wife Sable, Katharine Ross as Sable&#x27;s sister and Jason&#x27;s lover Francesca, and Ricardo Montalbán as Jason&#x27;s business rival Zach Powers. John James and Emma Samms also star as their &quot;Dynasty&quot; characters Jeff Colby and Fallon Carrington. &quot;The Colbys&quot; was ultimately a ratings disappointment, and was cancelled after two seasons.

==Premise==

On &quot;Dynasty&quot;, presumed-dead heiress Fallon Carrington Colby (Emma Samms) reappears alive, suffering from amnesia and using the name Randall Adams. Drawn to California after recognizing the name &quot;Colby&quot;, she meets playboy Miles Colby (Maxwell Caulfield), not realizing that he is the cousin of her ex-husband, Jeff (John James). A mutual business venture brings the Colbys of California to the Denver mansion of Fallon&#x27;s father Blake Carrington (John Forsythe).

Set in Los Angeles, &quot;The Colbys&quot; focuses on the extended Colby family as Jeff relocates to California to start his life anew—and comes face to face with Fallon, now married to his cousin Miles. A fierce rivalry is sparked between Jeff and Miles, and the love triangle spans the series. Miles&#x27; father, billionaire Jason Colby (Charlton Heston), has a rocky marriage to the manipulative Sable (Stephanie Beacham), and a longtime attraction to Sable&#x27;s sister Francesca (Katharine Ross)—Jeff&#x27;s estranged mother, and the former wife of Jason&#x27;s deceased brother Philip. Other characters include Jason&#x27;s powerful sister Constance Colby (Barbara Stanwyck), Miles&#x27; twin sister Monica (Tracy Scoggins) and their third sibling Bliss (Claire Yarlett).

In addition to Forsythe&#x27;s Blake, &quot;Dynasty&quot; characters Adam Carrington (Gordon Thomson), Steven Carrington (Jack Coleman), and Dominique Deveraux (Diahann Carroll) also made guest appearances on the show between 1985 and 1986.

==Storylines==
The first season&#x27;s storylines include the construction of an oil pipeline; Zach Powers&#x27; vendetta against the Colbys; the romance between Jason and his brother Philip&#x27;s widow Francesca; the subsequent collapse of Jason&#x27;s marriage to Sable; and eventually the revelation that Jason, not Philip, is in fact Jeff&#x27;s father. There were initially a number of crossovers featuring members of the &quot;Dynasty&quot; cast, most notably Blake Carrington, his sons Adam and Steven, and half-sister Dominique Deveraux. At the end of the season, Fallon learns that Miles could be the father of her unborn child, Monica&#x27;s plane crashes, and Sable has Jason arrested for assault and battery, claiming that he had inflicted the injuries she actually sustained by falling down a flight of stairs.

In the second season, Jason manages to divorce Sable and plans to marry Francesca, but the presumed-dead Philip reappears alive. Previously romantically linked to both Zach&#x27;s nephew and former stepson, Bliss falls in love with a Russian dancer watched by the KGB, the son Monica had given up eight years before re-enters her life, and Constance and Hutch are killed in a plane crash in India. At the end of the season, Miles&#x27; wife Channing phones to say she will abort their unborn baby; Sable kidnaps Monica&#x27;s son; Francesca seemingly dies after a car crash involving herself and Philip; and Fallon, stranded in the desert, is seemingly abducted by aliens who land in a UFO in the finale. The series&#x27; most infamous cliffhanger proved to be its last when the series was subsequently cancelled.

===Aftermath===
Following the cancellation of &quot;The Colbys&quot;, the characters of Jeff and Fallon were immediately reintroduced into &quot;Dynasty&quot; during that series&#x27; eighth-season premiere, &quot;The Siege – Part 1&quot; in order for her to recover from her alien abduction experience, though Jeff disbelieves her. Sable (now divorced from Jason, who was still involved with Frankie, who survived the car crash) and Monica (who no longer had contact with ex-lover Cash or their son Scott) also later reappeared on &quot;Dynasty&quot; for the series&#x27; ninth (and final) season in 1988–89. During the final season of &quot;Dynasty&quot;, it is revealed that Monica and her twin Miles might not have been Jason&#x27;s children, as Sable had been raped around the time they were conceived. Miles (who refers to Jeff as his half-brother, leading to the assumption that Jason was his and Monica&#x27;s father after all) later appears in the miniseries &quot;&quot; (1991), reunited with Fallon, and participates in Jeff&#x27;s rescue from the Consortium. The Jeff-Fallon-Miles love triangle is finally resolved, as Fallon leaves Miles for Jeff once again, and it is loosely implied that Miles becomes involved with Sammy Jo (Heather Locklear).

==Production and broadcast==

In early 1985, news outlets began reporting that ABC was developing a spin-off of &quot;Dynasty&quot;, then the #1 rated show in the US. &quot;Dynasty&quot; actors Rock Hudson, Ali MacGraw, Jack Coleman, Heather Locklear, and John James were mentioned as potential stars of the new series, tentatively titled &quot;The Colbys&quot;, and ABC was purportedly wooing Pamela Sue Martin to reprise her role as Fallon Carrington. It was also reported that &quot;Dynasty&quot; stars John Forsythe, Linda Evans, Joan Collins, and guest star Elizabeth Taylor would appear in the first two episodes of the spin-off, which would initially air after &quot;Dynasty&quot; on Wednesdays but would move to a time slot opposite &quot;Dallas&quot; on Fridays.

In March 1985, ABC announced that its rumored &quot;Dynasty&quot; spin-off had been greenlighted, to debut the following season. &quot;The Colbys&quot; would star John James as his &quot;Dynasty&quot; character Jeff Colby, with &quot;General Hospital&quot; actress Emma Samms as Fallon Carrington. The project was originally titled &quot;Dynasty II: The Colbys of California&quot;, which was shortened to &quot;Dynasty II: The Colbys&quot; and ultimately simplified to &quot;The Colbys&quot;. In May 1985, ABC unveiled its fall 1985 schedule, which placed &quot;The Colbys&quot; into the Thursday 9 pm time slot, preceded by &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; and followed by &quot;20/20&quot;.

In June 1985, &quot;Dynasty&quot; co-creator Esther Shapiro approached Charlton Heston about the role of patriarch Jason Colby, the brother of &quot;Dynasty&quot; Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner). Doris Day was considered, and both Burt Lancaster and Katharine Hepburn reportedly turned down roles in the series. In early July 1985, it was reported that in addition to Heston, ABC was pursuing Barbara Stanwyck and Faye Dunaway for starring roles, as well as James Coburn to play Ben Carrington, the brother of &quot;Dynasty&quot; Blake Carrington (John Forsythe). On July 9, 1985, it was reported that &quot;The Colbys&quot;″ versions of &quot;Dynasty&quot; rivals Krystle Carrington (Linda Evans) and Alexis Colby (Joan Collins) were going to be called Anthea (later changed to Francesca) and Sabella (nicknamed &quot;Sable&quot;).

Heston&#x27;s casting was confirmed in July 1985, as producers were negotiating with Angie Dickinson to play his character&#x27;s wife. Ultimately, Dunaway, Dickinson, Elizabeth Ashley, and Diana Rigg all turned down the role of Jason&#x27;s wife Sable. In August 1985, producers cast British actress Stephanie Beacham, &quot;a household name&quot; in the UK who had starred in the title role of the ITV drama &quot;Connie&quot;. Stanwyck and Maxwell Caulfield joined the cast in July 1985 as Jason&#x27;s sister Constance and son Miles, with Stanwyck having a clause in her contract that she would not be required to do press interviews. That month, Elizabeth Taylor made a statement that she would not be appearing on &quot;Dynasty&quot; or &quot;The Colbys&quot;, then or in the future.

In August 1985, it was reported Heston would be paid $85,000 per episode and Stanwyck would be paid $75,000. The same month, Katharine Ross was cast as Francesca. In September 1985, it was reported that Ricardo Montalbán would appear as a &quot;conniving shipping tycoon&quot; described as &quot;ambitious and scheming, but with a kind of charm that can allow him to get away with almost anything.&quot; The final cast included Tracy Scoggins and Claire Yarlett as Jason and Sable&#x27;s daughters, Monica and Bliss Colby.

The 13 bedroom, 15,000 sqftJay Paley House in Holmby Hills (at the time owned by business magnate Barron Hilton) featured as the family palatial Bel Air mansion, &quot;The Belvedere&quot;. The &#x27;masterpiece&#x27; gallery paintings in the mansion were painted by Lucia Vinograd. The attached stables were filmed at the Will Rogers State Historic Park.

&quot;The Colbys&quot; premiered at 10 pm on Wednesday, November 20, 1985, after &quot;Dynasty&quot; eighth episode of the season, and was initially a ratings success. The next episode of &quot;The Colbys&quot; was scheduled to air the next night, Thursday, November 21, in the show&#x27;s own new time slot, but was preempted by a televised speech by US President Ronald Reagan. It was later reported that Heston, an old friend of Reagan&#x27;s, had phoned the President to request the speech be rescheduled, to no avail. Episode two aired on Wednesday, November 27, 1985, before &quot;Dynasty&quot;, and then &quot;The Colbys&quot; moved to its new night on Thursday, November 28, 1985.

Ratings for &quot;The Colbys&quot; dropped considerably in the new time slot, though a March 1986 episode featuring Jeff and Fallon&#x27;s wedding garnered a high rating at a level not seen since the series&#x27; first two episodes. In January 1986, it was reported that Heston had extended his stay on &quot;The Colbys&quot; from 17 to 24 episodes, and Stanwyck ultimately extended from 13 to 24 episodes. ABC renewed &quot;The Colbys&quot; for a second season in March 1986, with Stanwyck stating she only wanted to appear in 6 or 7 episodes. The same month, Ron Miller of the &quot;Evening Independent&quot; suggested that &quot;The Colbys&quot; &quot;appears to be so prohibitively expensive that future payoff in syndication seems very chancy.&quot;

In June 1986, it was reported that Stanwyck would not be returning for season two. She had purportedly complained for some time about her character&#x27;s development, and in leaving suggested that Constance be killed. In July 1986, Kim Morgan Greene was cast as magazine reporter Channing Carter. In December 1986, it was reported that Heston had sent co-star Caulfield a letter admonishing him for unprofessional behavior on set, while calling the rest of &quot;The Colbys&quot; team &quot;the best I&#x27;ve worked with in 30 years.&quot; ABC cancelled &quot;The Colbys&quot; after its second season.

==Ratings and criticism==
The fifth season of &quot;Dynasty&quot; was ranked No. 1 in the Nielsen ratings in the United States. &quot;The Colbys&quot; debuted during &quot;Dynasty&quot; sixth season, which saw &quot;Dynasty&quot; drop to 7th in the ratings. Although &quot;The Colbys&quot; garnered high ratings for its premiere episode and won a 1986 People&#x27;s Choice Award for New Dramatic TV Program, the first season finished in 35th place, in part due to competition with NBC&#x27;s &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Night Court&quot; on Thursday nights. &quot;The Colbys&quot; was renewed for a second season but, scheduled opposite &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Night Court&quot;—as well as a few weeks against rival soap &quot;Knots Landing&quot; on CBS -- &quot;The Colbys&quot; finished 64th for the year and was subsequently cancelled. &quot;Dynasty&quot; fell to No. 24 for its seventh season.

Like &quot;Dynasty&quot;, the series employed the standard melodrama of soap operas and added well-known performers and elaborate sets and wardrobe. Lee Margulies of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s not a spin-off, it&#x27;s a clone—as close a replica as ABC and the &quot;Dynasty&quot; producers could concoct, right down to the credits.&quot; In their &quot;Directory To Primetime TV Shows&quot;, television historians Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh stated that the series likely failed because it was &quot;too close a copy&quot; of &quot;Dynasty&quot;. Barbara Holsopple of &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; compared the scripts to &quot;Dick and Jane&quot; books for children, and criticized the acting.

When Stanwyck opted to end her contract and leave the series after its first season in 1986, she reportedly called the show &quot;a turkey&quot;, and told co-creator Esther Shapiro &quot;This is the biggest pile of garbage I ever did&quot; and that &quot;It&#x27;s one thing to know you&#x27;re making a lot of money off vulgarity, but when you don&#x27;t &quot;know&quot; it&#x27;s vulgar—it&#x27;s plain stupid.&quot; Conversely, Heston always supported the show and stated its cancellation &quot;was premature&quot; as &quot;we were coming closer to being a creative production team that could make the kind of show we&#x27;d planned on from the beginning.&quot; &quot;Dynasty&quot; star Joan Collins categorically refused to make any appearances in &quot;The Colbys&quot; herself, believing it would have caused &quot;massive confusion between the two shows&quot;.

==Home media==
On May 12, 2015, Shout! Factory released &quot;The Colbys: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time. The 12-disc set features all 49 episodes of the series as well as all new cast interviews with Stephanie Beacham, John James and Maxwell Caulfield.

On July 20, 2015, &quot;The Colbys&quot; was released in Germany (Region 2). The DVD is split in two, the first season and the second season. The DVDs have a German cover (&quot;Die Colbys - Das Imperium&quot;) but are spoken in English and dubbed in German. The series has also been released on DVD in Spain in four volumes (two per season). In the UK, it was released as a single boxset of 12 discs (identical to the US release) by the DVD distributor MediumRare Entertainment in 2018.

The distribution rights to &quot;The Colbys&quot;, originally owned by Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution, transferred to CBS Paramount Network Television in 2006.

<text>The Canon de 65 M modele 1906 where M stands for &quot;montagne&quot;, or briefly 65 mm Mle 1906 where &quot;mle&quot; stands for &quot;modèle&quot;, was a French mountain gun which entered service with the &quot;régiments d&#x27;artillerie de montagne&quot; in 1906 and was one of the first soft-recoil guns in service. The carriage of the Mle 1906 was hinged and could be broken down into four mule loads for transport. By 1939, the weapon was generally used as an infantry support gun. After 1940, the Germans used the guns as the 6,5 cm GebK 221(f). The gun was also used by Israel in 1948 Arab–Israeli War as Napoleonchik, and by Albania, Poland and Greece.

==Combat history==
===France===
During World War I the French Armée d’Orient used the Mle 1906 against the forces of the Central Powers in the mountains of Macedonia. There were 72 Mle 1906 guns in service in the Balkans theatre during the allied breakout from the Salonica bridgehead on September 15–29, 1918. The initial success of this allied offensive led Bulgaria to capitulate on October 9, 1918, later in October 1918 Serbia was liberated and lastly Austria-Hungary capitulated in November 1918 when faced with invasion from Italian forces from the south.

Still in service with the French Army in 1939-1940, a few were taken over by the Wehrmacht, as &quot;6,5 cm Gebirgskanone 221 (f)&quot;.

===Israel===
The Canon de 65 M (Montagne) Modèle 1906 was used by the Israel Defence Forces in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and was nicknamed &quot;Napoleonchik&quot; by the Israelis due to its old look.

The first use of two of these cannons, lacking sights, was made in the Battle of Degania in northern Israel, which was also the first time the Israeli side employed field artillery. Subsequent uses were made in numerous major operations in the war, including Operation Bin Nun and Operation Pleshet.

<text>A BB gun is a type of air gun designed to shoot metallic spherical projectiles called BBs (not to be confused with similar-looking bearing balls), which are approximately the same size as BB-size lead birdshot used in shotguns ( in diameter). Modern BB guns usually have a smoothbore barrel with a caliber, and use steel balls that measure in diameter and in weight, usually zinc- or copper-plated for corrosion resistance. Some manufacturers still make the slightly larger traditional lead balls that weigh around , which are generally intended for use in rifled barrels (because lead is more malleable and exerts less wear on riflings).

The term &quot;BB gun&quot; is frequently used colloquially to describe airsoft guns, which shoot plastic pellets (also often referred to as &quot;BBs&quot;) that are larger (usually in diameter) but much less dense than metal BBs, and have significantly lower ballistic performance. The term is also sometimes used to describe a pellet gun, which shoots diabolo-shaped (not spherical) lead projectiles at higher power and velocity. Although some BB guns can also shoot pellets, the reverse situation is not true: steel BB balls have greater stiffness and are not meant to be shot from pellet guns, whose barrels are typically rifled and thus can get stuck (similar to a squib load in firearms) and lead to a damage or mechanical failure within the pellet gun.

== History ==

The term &quot;BB&quot; originated from the nomenclature of the size of lead shots used in a smoothbore shotgun. Size &quot;BB&quot; shots were nominally , but tended to vary considerably in size because of the loose tolerances in shotshells. The largest shotgun pellet commonly used was named &quot;00&quot; or &quot;double ought&quot; and was used for hunting deer and thus called &quot;buckshot&quot;, while the smaller BB-sized shot was typically used to shoot small/medium-sized game birds and called &quot;birdshot&quot;.

In 1886, the Markham Air Rifle Company in Plymouth, Michigan produced the first wooden-construct spring-piston air rifle design as a youth training gun, and used the BB-size birdshot as the chosen ammunition. Two years later, the neighbouring Plymouth Air Rifle Company (later renamed Daisy Manufacturing Company in 1895) introduced the first full-metal airgun that also fired BB shots – the Daisy BB Gun, which became a very popular household name because of successful marketing. Around 1900, Daisy changed their BB-size bore diameter to , and began to market precision-made lead shot specifically for their BB guns. They called these &quot;round shots&quot;, but the &quot;BB&quot; name was already well established, and consequently most users continued calling their guns &quot;BB guns&quot;, and the projectiles as &quot;BB shots&quot; or just &quot;BBs&quot;.

Subsequently, the term &quot;BB&quot; became generic, and is used loosely referring to any small spherical projectiles of various calibers and materials. This includes bearing balls often utilized by anti-personnel mines, .177 caliber lead/steel shots used by air guns, plastic round balls (such as the pellets used by airsoft guns), small marbles and many others. It has become ubiquitous to refer to any steel ball, such as a BB, as a &quot;ball bearing&quot;. However, BBs should not be confused with a ball bearing, which is a mechanical component using small internal rolling balls to reduce friction between moving parts of machines.

==Operation==

BB guns can use any of the operating mechanisms used for air guns. However, because the projectile inherently has limited accuracy and short effective range, only the simpler and less expensive mechanisms are generally used for guns designed to fire only BBs.

Because the strength of the steel BB does not allow it to be swaged with the low propelling force used to accelerate it through the barrel, BBs are slightly smaller () than the internal diameter of the barrel (). This limits accuracy because little spin is imparted on the BB. It also limits range, because some of the pressurized gas used to accelerate the BB leaks around it and reduces the overall efficiency. Since a BB will easily roll unhindered down the barrel, it is common to find guns that use a magnet in the loading mechanism to hold the BB at the rear of the barrel until it is fired.

The traditional and still most common powerplant for BB guns is the spring-piston pump, usually patterned after a lever-action rifle or a pump-action shotgun. The lever-action rifle was the first type of BB gun, and still dominates the inexpensive youth BB gun market. The Daisy Model 25, modeled after a pump-action shotgun with a trombone pump-action mechanism, dominated the low-price, higher-performance market for over 50 years (19141978). Lever-action models generally have very low velocities, around , a result of the weak springs used to keep cocking efforts low for use by youths. The Daisy Model 25 typically achieved the highest velocities of its day, ranging from .

Multiple-pump pneumatic guns are also common. Many pneumatic pellet guns provide the ability to use BBs as a cheaper alternative to lead shot. Some of these guns have rifled barrels, but the slightly undersized BBs do not swage in the barrel, so the rifling does not impart a significant spin. These are the types of guns that will benefit most from using precision lead BB shot. Pneumatic BB guns can also attain higher velocities than traditional spring-piston types.

The last common type of power for BB guns is compressed gas, most commonly the Powerlet cartridges. The powerlet is a disposable metal gas cylinder containing of compressed carbon dioxide, with a self-contained valve to release the CO2 which expands to propel the BB. These are primarily used in BB pistols, and are capable of rapid firing unlike spring-piston or pneumatic types. A typical CO2 BB pistol uses a spring-loaded magazine to feed BBs, and a double-action trigger mechanism to chamber a BB and cock the hammer. However some guns (either to stay true to the original gun or to make the trigger pull easier) do have a single-action trigger. Either type of gun may also have blowback action, where CO2 will push the slide back in addition to firing a BB. When firing, the hammer strikes an internal valve linked to the CO2 source, which releases a measured amount of CO2 gas to fire the BB; this also gives it realistic recoil and muzzle report features. Many CO2 BB guns are patterned after popular firearms such as the Colt M1911, and can be used for training as well as recreation.

Some gas-powered BB guns use a larger source of gas, and provide machine gun-like fire. These types, most notably the Shooting Star Tommy Gun (originally known as the Feltman) are commonly found at carnivals. The MacGlashan BB Gun was used to train antiaircraft gunners in the United States Army Air Corps and United States Navy during World War II. A popular commercial model was the Larc M-19, which used 1 pound (454 g) canisters of Freon-12 refrigerant. These types have very simple operating mechanisms, based on a venturi pump. The gas is released in a constant stream, and this is used to suck the BBs up into the barrel at rates as high as 3600 rounds per minute.

==Safety==
BB guns can shoot faster than , but are often less powerful than a conventional pellet airgun. Pellet airguns have the ability to fire considerably faster, even beyond . Although claims are often exaggerated, a few airguns can actually fire a standard 0.177 caliber lead pellet faster than , but these are generally not BB-firing guns.

A BB with a velocity of only has skin-piercing capability, and a velocity reaching can fracture bone. This is potentially lethal, and this potential increases with velocity, but also rapidly decreases with distance. The effective penetrating range of a BB gun with a muzzle velocity of is approximately . A person wearing jeans at this distance would not sustain serious injury. However, even at this distance a BB still might penetrate bare skin, and even if not, could leave a severe and painful bruise. The maximum range of a BB gun in the range is 100–200 metres approximately, provided the muzzle is elevated to the optimum angle.

Steel BBs are prone to ricochet off hard surfaces such as brick, concrete, metal, or wood end grain. Unlike lead pellets which usually flatten and absorb energy upon impact, a BB bouncing off a hard surface can retain a large portion of its initial energy, and could easily cause serious eye damage. Wearing eye protection is essential when shooting BBs at these materials, more so than when shooting lead pellets.

==Quick Kill training==
The U.S. Army trained recruits in Quick Kill techniques using Daisy Model 99 BB guns to improve soldiers using their weapons in the Vietnam War from 1967 to 1973. The technique was developed for the Army by Bobby Lamar &quot;Lucky&quot; McDaniel and Mike Jennings.

==Legal status==
BB guns are often regulated as a typical air gun. Air gun laws vary widely by local jurisdiction.

<doc id="210728" wikidata="Q1465619" url="?curid=210728" title="History of the Jews in the United States">
<text>The history of the Jews in the United States goes back to the 1600s and 1700s. There have been Jewish communities in the United States since colonial times, with individuals living in various cities before the American Revolution. Early Jewish communities were primarily composed of Sephardi immigrants from Brazil, Amsterdam, or England, many of them fleeing the Inquisition.

Private and civically unrecognized local, regional, and sometimes international networks were noted in these groups in order to facilitate marriage and business ties. This small and private colonial community largely existed as undeclared and non-practicing Jews, a great number deciding to intermarry with non-Jews. Later on, the vastly more numerous Ashkenazi Jews that came to populate New York, New Jersey, and elsewhere in what became the United States of America altered these demographics.

Until the 1830s, the Jewish community of Charleston, South Carolina, was the largest in North America. In the late 1800s and the beginning of the 1900s, many Jewish immigrants arrived from Europe. For example, many German Jews arrived in the middle of the 19th century, established clothing stores in towns across the country, formed Reform synagogues, and were active in banking in New York. Immigration of Eastern Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews, in 1880–1914, brought a new wave of Jewish immigration to New York City, including many who became active in socialism and labor movements, as well as Orthodox and Conservative Jews.

Refugees arrived from diaspora communities in Europe during and after the Holocaust and, after 1970, from the Soviet Union. Politically, American Jews have been especially active as part of the liberal New Deal coalition of the Democratic Party since the 1930s, although recently there is a conservative Republican element among the Orthodox. They have displayed high education levels and high rates of upward social mobility compared to several other ethnic and religious groups inside America. The Jewish communities in small towns have declined, with the population becoming increasingly concentrated in large metropolitan areas. Antisemitism in the U.S. has endured into the 21st century, although numerous cultural changes have taken place such as the election of many Jews into governmental positions at the local, state, and national levels.

In the 1940s, Jews comprised 3.7% of the national population. , at about 7.1 million, the population is 2% of the national total—and shrinking as a result of low birth rates and Jewish assimilation. The largest Jewish population centers are the metropolitan areas of New York (2.1 million), Los Angeles (), Miami (), Washington, D.C. (), Chicago () and Philadelphia ().

==Jewish immigration==

The Jewish population of the U.S. is the product of waves of immigration primarily from diaspora communities in Europe; emigration was initially inspired by the pull of American social and entrepreneurial opportunities, and later was a refuge from the peril of ongoing antisemitism in Europe. Few ever returned to Europe, although many have made aliyah to Israel. Statistics demonstrate that there was a myth that no Jews returned to their previous diasporic lands, but while the rate was around 6%, it was much lower than for other ethnic groups.

From a population of 1,000–2,000 Jewish residents in 1790, mostly Sephardic Jews who had immigrated to Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, the American Jewish community grew to about 15,000 by 1840, and to about 250,000 by 1880. Most of the mid-19th century Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants to the U.S. came from diaspora communities in German-speaking states, in addition to the larger concurrent Christian German migration. They initially spoke German, and settled across the nation, assimilating with their new countrymen; the Jews among them commonly engaged in trade, manufacturing, and operated dry goods (clothing) stores in many cities.

Between 1880 and the start of World War I in 1914, about 2,000,000 Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews immigrated from diaspora communities in Eastern Europe, where repeated pogroms made life untenable. They came from Jewish diaspora communities of Russia, the Pale of Settlement (modern Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova), and the Russian-controlled portions of Poland. The latter group clustered in New York City, created the garment industry there, which supplied the dry goods stores across the country, and were heavily engaged in the trade unions. They immigrated alongside non-Jewish eastern and southern European immigrants, which was unlike the historically predominant American demographic from northern and western Europe; Records indicate between 1880 and 1920 that these new immigrants rose from less than five percent of all European immigrants to nearly 50%. This change caused renewed nativist sentiment, the birth of the Immigration Restriction League, and congressional studies by the Dillingham Commission from 1907 to 1911. The Emergency Quota Act of 1921 established immigration restrictions specifically on these groups, and the Immigration Act of 1924 further tightened and codified these limits. With the ensuing Great Depression, and despite worsening conditions for Jews in Europe with the rise of Nazi Germany, these quotas remained in place with minor alterations until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.

Jews quickly created support networks consisting of many small synagogues and Ashkenazi Jewish &quot;Landsmannschaften&quot; (German for &quot;Territorial Associations&quot;) for Jews from the same town or village.

Leaders of the time urged assimilation and integration into the wider American culture, and Jews quickly became part of American life. During World War II, 500,000 American Jews, about half of all Jewish males between 18 and 50, enlisted for service, and after the war, Jewish families joined the new trend of suburbanization, as they became wealthier and more mobile. The Jewish community expanded to other major cities, particularly around Los Angeles and Miami. Their young people attended secular high schools and colleges and met non-Jews, so that intermarriage rates soared to nearly 50%. Synagogue membership, however, grew considerably, from 20% of the Jewish population in 1930 to 60% in 1960.

The earlier waves of immigration and immigration restriction were followed by the Holocaust that destroyed most of the European Jewish community by 1945; these also made the United States the home for the largest Jewish diaspora population in the world. In 1900 there were 1.5 million American Jews; in 2005 there were 5.3 million. See Historical Jewish population comparisons.

The most recent Jewish communities to immigrate to the United States en masse are Iranian Jews, who primarily immigrated to the United States in the aftermath of the Islamic Revolution, and Soviet Jews who came after the fall of the Soviet Union.

On a theological level, American Jews are divided into a number of Jewish denominations, of which the most numerous are Reform Judaism, Conservative Judaism and Orthodox Judaism. However, roughly 25% of American Jews are unaffiliated with any denomination. Conservative Judaism arose in America and Reform Judaism was founded in Germany and popularized by American Jews.

==Colonial era==

Luis de Carabajal y Cueva, a Spanish conquistador and converso first set foot in what is now Texas in 1570. The first Jewish-born person to set foot on American soil was Joachim Gans in 1584. Elias Legarde (a.k.a. Legardo) was a Sephardic Jew who arrived at James City, Virginia, on the &quot;Abigail&quot; in 1621. According to Leon Huhner, Legarde was from Languedoc, France, and was hired to go to the Colony to teach people how to grow grapes for wine. Elias Legarde was living in Buckroe in Elizabeth City in February 1624. Legarde was employed by Anthonie Bonall, who was a French silk maker and vigneron (cultivator of vineyards for winemaking), one of the men from Languedoc sent to the colony by John Bonall, keeper of the silkworms of King James I. In 1628, Legarde leased on the west side of Harris Creek in Elizabeth City. Josef Mosse and Rebecca Isaake are documented in Elizabeth City in 1624. John Levy patented of land on the main branch of Powell&#x27;s Creek, Virginia, around 1648, Albino Lupo who traded with his brother, Amaso de Tores, in London. Two brothers named Silvedo and Manuel Rodriguez are documented to be in Lancaster County, Virginia, around 1650. None of the Jews in Virginia were forced to leave under any conditions.

Solomon Franco, a Jewish merchant, arrived in Boston in 1649; subsequently, he was given a stipend from the Puritans there, on the condition that he leave on the next passage back to Holland. In September 1654, shortly before the Jewish New Year, twenty-three Jews from the Sephardic community in the Netherlands, coming from Recife, Brazil, then a Dutch colony, arrived in New Amsterdam (New York City). Governor Peter Stuyvesant tried to enhance his Dutch Reformed Church by discriminating against other religions, but religious pluralism was already a tradition in the Netherlands and his superiors at the Dutch West India Company in Amsterdam overruled him. In 1664 the English conquered New Amsterdam and renamed it New York.

Religious tolerance was also established elsewhere in the colonies. The charter of the colony of South Carolina granted liberty of conscience to all settlers, expressly mentioning &quot;Jews, heathens, and dissenters.&quot; As a result, Charleston, South Carolina has a particularly long history of Sephardic settlement, which, in 1816, numbered over 600—then the largest Jewish population of any city in the United States. Sephardic Dutch Jews were also among the early settlers of Newport (where Touro Synagogue, the country&#x27;s oldest surviving synagogue building, stands), Savannah, Philadelphia and Baltimore. In New York City, Congregation Shearith Israel is the oldest continuous congregation started in 1687 having their first synagogue erected in 1728, and its current building still houses some of the original pieces of that first.

==Revolutionary era==
By the beginning of the Revolutionary War in 1776, around 2,000 Jews lived in the British North American colonies, most of them Sephardic Jews who immigrated from the Dutch Republic, Great Britain, and the Iberian Peninsula. Many American Jews supported the Patriot cause, with some enlisting in the Continental Army; South Carolinian planter Francis Salvador became the first American Jew to be killed in action during the war, while businessman Haym Solomon joined the New York branch of the Sons of Liberty and became one of the key financiers to the Continental Army. The highest ranking Jewish officer in the Patriot forces was Colonel Mordecai Sheftall; whether or not Brigadier general Moses Hazen was Jewish is still the subject of debate among historians. Other American Jews, including David Franks, suffered from their association with Continental Army officer Benedict Arnold (Franks served Arnold as an aide-de-camp) during his defection to the British in 1780.

U.S. President George Washington remembered the Jewish contribution when he wrote to the Sephardic congregation of Newport, Rhode Island, in a letter dated August 17, 1790:
 May the children of the stock of Abraham who dwell in the land continue to merit and enjoy the goodwill of the other inhabitants. While everyone shall sit safely under his own vine and fig-tree and there shall be none to make him afraid. 

A small Jewish community had developed in Newport over the 18th century; this included Aaron Lopez, a Jewish merchant who played a significant role in the town&#x27;s involvement in the slave trade.

In 1790, the approximate 2,500-strong American Jewish community faced a number of legal restrictions in various states that prevented non-Christians from holding public office and voting, though the state governments of Delaware, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Georgia soon eliminated these barriers, as did the U.S. Bill of Rights in 1791 more generally. Sephardic Jews became active in community affairs in the 1790s, after achieving &quot;political equality in the five states in which they were most numerous.&quot; Other barriers did not officially fall for decades in the states of Rhode Island (1842), North Carolina (1868), and New Hampshire (1877). Despite these restrictions, which were often enforced unevenly, there were really too few Jews in 17th- and 18th-century America for anti-Jewish incidents to become a significant social or political phenomenon at the time. The evolution of Jews from toleration to full civil and political equality that followed the American Revolution helped ensure that antisemitism would never become as common as in Europe.

==19th century==

Following traditional religious and cultural teachings about improving a lot of their brethren, Jewish residents in the United States began to organize their communities in the early 19th century. Early examples include a Jewish orphanage set up in Charleston, South Carolina in 1801, and the first Jewish school, Polonies Talmud Torah, established in New York in 1806. In 1843, the first national secular Jewish organization in the United States, the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith was established.

Jewish Texans have been a part of Texas History since the first European explorers arrived in the 16th century. Spanish Texas did not welcome easily identifiable Jews, but they came in any case. Jao de la Porta was with Jean Laffite at Galveston, Texas in 1816, and Maurice Henry was in Velasco in the late 1820s. Jews fought in the armies of the Texas Revolution of 1836, some with Fannin at Goliad, others at San Jacinto. Dr. Albert Levy became a surgeon to revolutionary Texan forces in 1835, participated in the capture of Béxar, and joined the Texas Navy the next year.

By 1840, Jews constituted a tiny, but nonetheless stable, middle-class minority of about 15,000 out of the 17 million Americans counted by the U.S. Census. Jews intermarried rather freely with non-Jews, continuing a trend that had begun at least a century earlier. However, as immigration increased the Jewish population to 50,000 by 1848, negative stereotypes of Jews in newspapers, literature, drama, art and popular culture grew more commonplace, and physical attacks became more frequent.

During the 19th century, (especially the 1840s and 1850s), Jewish immigration was primarily of Ashkenazi Jews from Germany, bringing a liberal, educated population that had experience with the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment. It was in the United States during the 19th century that two of the major branches of Judaism were established by these German immigrants: Reform Judaism (out of German Reform Judaism) and Conservative Judaism, in reaction to the perceived liberalness of Reform Judaism.

===Civil War===

During the American Civil War, approximately 3,000 Jews (out of around 150,000 Jews in the United States) fought on the Confederate side and 7,000 fought on the Union side. Jews also played leadership roles on both sides, with nine Jewish generals serving in the Union Army, the most notable of whom were brigadier generals Edward S. Salomon (who attained the rank at the age of 29) and Frederick Knefler. There were also twenty-one Jewish colonels who fought for the Union, including Marcus M. Spiegel of Ohio. and Max Friedman, who commanded the 65th Pennsylvania Regiment, 5th Cavalry, known as Cameron&#x27;s Dragoons or the Cameron Dragoons, which had a sizable number of German Jewish immigrants from Philadelphia in its ranks. Several dozens of Jewish officers also fought for the Confederacy, most notably Colonel Abraham Charles Myers, a West Point graduate and quartermaster general of the Confederate Army.

Judah P. Benjamin served as Secretary of State and acting Secretary of War of the Confederacy.

Several Jewish bankers played key roles in providing government financing for both sides of the Civil War: the Speyer family and the Seligman family for the Union, and Emile Erlanger and Company for the Confederacy.

In December 1862 Major General Ulysses S. Grant, angry at the illegal trade in smuggled cotton, issued General Order No. 11 expelling Jews from areas under his control in western Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky:

The Jews, as a class violating every regulation of trade established by the Treasury Department and also department orders, are hereby expelled ... within twenty-four hours from the receipt of this order.

Jews appealed to President Abraham Lincoln, who immediately ordered General Grant to rescind the order. Sarna notes that there was a &quot;surge in many forms of anti-Jewish intolerance&quot; at the time. Sarna, however, concludes that the long-term implications were highly favorable, for the episode:

also empowered Jews with the knowledge that they could fight back against bigotry and win, even against a prominent general. The overturning of Grant&#x27;s order, especially on top of the victory in the chaplaincy affair, appreciably strengthened the Jewish community and increased its self-confidence. The successes also validated an activist Jewish communal policy that based claims to equality on American law and values, while relying on help from public officials to combat prejudice and defend Jews&#x27; minority rights.

===Participation in politics===
Jews also began to organize as a political group in the United States, especially in response to the United States reaction to the 1840 Damascus Blood Libel. The first Jewish member of the United States House of Representatives, Lewis Charles Levin, and Senator David Levy Yulee, were elected in 1845 (although Yulee converted to Episcopalianism the following year). Official government antisemitism continued, however, with New Hampshire only offering equality to Jews and Catholics in 1877, the last state to do so.

Grant very much regretted his wartime order; he publicly apologized for it. When he became president in 1869, he set out to make amends. Sarna argues:

Eager to prove that he was above prejudice, Grant appointed more Jews to public office than had any of his predecessors and, in the name of human rights, he extended unprecedented support to persecuted Jews in Russia and Romania. Time and again, partly as a result of this enlarged vision of what it meant to be an American and partly in order to live down General Orders No. 11, Grant consciously worked to assist Jews and secure them equality. ... Through his appointments and policies, Grant rejected calls for a &#x27;Christian nation&#x27; and embraced Jews as insiders in America, part of &quot;we the people.&quot; During his administration, Jews achieved heightened status on the national scene, anti-Jewish prejudice declined, and Jews look forward optimistically to a liberal epoch characterized by sensitivity to human rights and interreligious cooperation.

===Banking===
In the middle of the 19th century, a number of German Jews founded investment banking firms which later became mainstays of the industry. Most prominent Jewish banks in the United States were investment banks, rather than commercial banks. Important banking firms included Goldman Sachs (founded by Samuel Sachs and Marcus Goldman), Kuhn Loeb (Solomon Loeb and Jacob Schiff), Lehman Brothers (Henry Lehman), Salomon Brothers, and Bache &amp; Co. (founded by Jules Bache). J. &amp; W. Seligman &amp; Co. was a large investment bank from the 1860s to the 1920s. By the 1930s, Jewish presence in private investment banking had diminished dramatically.

===Western settlements===
In the nineteenth-century, Jews began settling throughout the American West. The majority were immigrants, with German Jews comprising most of the early nineteenth-century wave of Jewish immigration to the United States and therefore to the Western states and territories, while Eastern European Jews migrated in greater numbers and comprised most of the migratory westward wave at the close of the century. Following the California Gold Rush of 1849, Jews established themselves prominently on the West Coast, with important settlements in Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; and especially San Francisco, which became the second-largest Jewish city in the nation.

Eisenberg, Kahn, and Toll (2009) emphasize the creative freedom Jews found in western society, unburdening them from past traditions and opening up new opportunities for entrepreneurship, philanthropy, and civic leadership. Regardless of origin, many early Jewish settlers worked as peddlers before establishing themselves as merchants. Numerous entrepreneurs opened shop in large cities like San Francisco to service the mining industry, as well as in smaller communities like Deadwood, South Dakota and Bisbee, Arizona, which sprung up throughout the resource-rich West. The most popular specialty was clothing merchant, followed by the small-scale manufacturing and general retailing. For example, Levi Strauss (1829 – 1902) started as a wholesale dealer in with clothing, bedding, and notions; by 1873 he introduced the first blue jeans, an immediate hit for miners, and later, informal urban wear. Everyone was a newcomer, and the Jews were generally accepted with few signs of discrimination, according to Eisenberg, Kahn, and Toll (2009).

Though many Jewish immigrants to the West found success as merchants, others worked as bankers, miners, freighters, ranchers, and farmers. Otto Mears helped to build railroads across Colorado, while Solomon Bibo became the governor of the Acoma Pueblo Indians. Though these are by no means the only two Jewish immigrants to make names for themselves in the West, they help to showcase the wide variety of paths that Jewish settlers pursued. Organizations like the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and Baron Maurice de Hirsch&#x27;s Jewish Agricultural Society served as a conduit for connecting Jewish newcomers arriving from Europe with settlements in the Upper Midwest, Southwest, and Far West. In other cases, family connections served as the primary network drawing more Jews to the West.

Jeanette Abrams argues persuasively that Jewish women played a prominent role in the establishment of Jewish communities throughout the West. For example, the first synagogue in Arizona, Tucson&#x27;s Temple Emanu-El, was established by the local Hebrew Ladies Benevolent Society, as was the case for many synagogues in the West. Likewise, many Jewish activists and community leaders became prominent in municipal and state politics, winning election to public office with little attention paid to their Jewish identity. They set up Reform congregations and generally gave little support to Zionism down to the 1940s.

In the 20th century, Metropolitan Los Angeles became the second-largest Jewish base in the United States. The most dramatic cast of newcomers there was in Hollywood, where Jewish producers were the dominant force in the film industry after 1920.

==1880–1925==
===Immigration of Ashkenazi Jews===
None of the early migratory movements assumed the significance and volume of that from Russia and neighboring countries. Between the last two decades of the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth century, there was a mass emigration of Jewish peoples from Eastern and Southern Europe. During that period, 2.8 million European Jews immigrated to the United States, with 94% of them coming from Eastern Europe. This emigration, mainly from diaspora communities in Russian Poland and other areas of the Russian Empire, began as far back as 1821, but did not become especially noteworthy until after German immigration fell off in 1870. Though nearly 50,000 Russian, Polish, Galician, and Romanian Jews went to the United States during the succeeding decade, it was not until the pogroms, anti-Jewish riots in Russia, of the early 1880s, that the immigration assumed extraordinary proportions. From Russia alone the emigration rose from an annual average of 4,100 in the decade 1871–80 to an annual average of 20,700 in the decade 1881–90. Antisemitism and official measures of persecution over the past century combined with the desire for economic freedom and opportunity have motivated a continuing flow of Jewish immigrants from Russia and Central Europe over the past century.

The Russian pogroms, beginning in 1900, forced large numbers of Jews to seek refuge in the U.S. Though most of these immigrants arrived on the Eastern seaboard, many came as part of the Galveston Movement, through which Jewish immigrants settled in Texas as well as the western states and territories. In 1915, the circulation of the daily Yiddish newspapers was half a million in New York City alone, and 600,000 nationally. In addition, thousands more subscribed to the numerous weekly Yiddish papers and the many magazines. Yiddish theater was very well attended and provided a training ground for performers and producers who moved to Hollywood in the 1920s.

====Response to Russian pogroms====

Repeated large-scale murderous pogroms in the late 19th and early 20th century increasingly angered American opinion. The well-established German Jews in the United States, although they were not directly affected by the Russian pogroms, were well organized and convinced Washington to support the cause of Jews in Russia. Led by Oscar Straus, Jacob Schiff, Mayer Sulzberger, and Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise, they organized protest meetings, issued publicity, and met with President Theodore Roosevelt and Secretary of State John Hay. Stuart E. Knee reports that in April 1903, Roosevelt received 363 addresses, 107 letters, and 24 petitions signed by thousands of Christians leading public and church leaders—they all called on the Tsar to stop the persecution of Jews. Public rallies were held in scores of cities, topped off at Carnegie Hall in New York in May. The Tsar retreated a bit and fired one local official after the Kishinev pogrom, which Roosevelt explicitly denounced. But Roosevelt was mediating the war between Russia and Japan and could not publicly take sides. Therefore, Secretary Hay took the initiative in Washington. Finally Roosevelt forwarded a petition to the Tsar, who rejected it claiming the Jews were at fault. Roosevelt won Jewish support in his 1904 landslide reelection. The pogroms continued, as hundreds of thousands of Jews fled Russia, most heading for London or New York. With American public opinion turning against Russia, Congress officially denounced its policies in 1906. Roosevelt kept a low profile as did his new Secretary of State Elihu Root. In late 1906, Roosevelt appointed the first Jew to the cabinet: Oscar Straus, becoming Secretary of Commerce and Labor.

==== Restricting immigration from Eastern Europe – 1924-1965====
By 1924, 2 million Jews had arrived from Central and Eastern Europe. Anti-immigration feelings growing in the United States at this time resulted in the National Origins Quota of 1924, which severely restricted immigration from many regions, including Eastern Europe. The Jewish community took the lead in opposing immigration restrictions. In the 1930s they worked hard to allow in Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. They had very little success; the restrictions remained in effect until 1965, although temporary opportunities were given to refugees from Europe after 1945.

==Local developments 1600s to 1900s ==

=== Chicago, Illinois ===
The first Jews to settle in Chicago after its 1833 incorporation were Ashkenazi. In the late 1830s and early 1840s German Jews arrived in Chicago, mostly from Bavaria. Many Jews in Chicago became street peddlers or eventually opened stores, some of which grew to larger companies. In the early 20th century, a wave of Ashkenazi Jews arrived, fleeing the pogroms in Eastern Europe.

=== Clarksburg, West Virginia ===
In 1900, five of seven clothing merchants in Clarksburg, West Virginia, were Jewish, and into the 1930s the Jews here were primarily merchants. Because of the need to expand their synagogue, the Orthodox Jewish congregation merged with a smaller Reform group to form a compromise Conservative congregation in 1939, and Jewish community life in Clarksburg centered on this synagogue. The community, which reached a population peak of about three hundred in the mid-1950s, is still represented by about thirty families.

=== Wichita, Kansas ===
The Jews of Wichita, Kansas, fashioned an ethnoreligious world that was distinct, vibrant, and tailored to their circumstances. They had migrated west with capital, credit, and know-how, and their family-based businesses were extensions of family businesses in the east. They distinguished themselves in educational, leadership, and civic positions. Predominantly German Jews through the 1880s, their remoteness and small numbers encouraged the practice of Reform Judaism. The arrival of conservative Jews from Eastern Europe after the 1880s brought tension into the Wichita Jewish community, but also stirred an ethnoreligious revival. The German Jews were well respected in the Wichita community, which facilitated the integration of the Eastern European newcomers. The Jewish community was characterized by a &quot;dynamic tension&quot; between tradition and modernization.

=== Oakland, California ===
The Jewish community in Oakland, California, is representative of many cities. Jews played a prominent role, and were among the pioneers of Oakland in the 1850s. In the early years, the Oakland Hebrew Benevolent Society, founded in 1862, was the religious, social, and charitable center of the community. The first synagogue, the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland, was founded in 1875. The synagogue, also known as Temple Sinai, took over the religious and burial functions for the community. Jews from Poland predominated in the community, and most of them worked in some aspect of the clothing industry. David Solis-Cohen, the noted author, was a leader in the Oakland Jewish community in the 1870s. In 1879 Oakland&#x27;s growing Jewish community organized a second congregation, a strictly orthodox group, Poel Zedek. Women&#x27;s religious organizations flourished, their charitable services extending to needy gentiles as well as Jews. Oakland Jewry was part of the greater San Francisco community, yet maintained its own character. In 1881 the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland, elected Myer Solomon Levy as its rabbi. The London-born Levy practiced traditional Judaism. Oakland&#x27;s Jews were pushed hard to excel in school, both secular and religious. Fannie Bernstein was the first Jew to graduate from the University of California at Berkeley, in 1883. First Hebrew Congregation sponsored a Sabbath school which had 75 children in 1887.
Oakland Jewry was active in public affairs and charitable projects in the 1880s. Rabbi Myer S. Levy was chaplain to the state legislature in 1885. The Daughters of Israel Relief Society continued its good works both inside and outside the Jewish community. Beth Jacob, the traditional congregation of Old World Polish Jews, continued its separate religious practices while it maintained friendly relations with the members of the first Hebrew Congregation. Able social and political leadership came from David Samuel Hirshberg. Until 1886 he was an officer in the Grand Lodge of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith. He served as Under Sheriff of Alameda County in 1883 and was active in Democratic party affairs. In 1885 he was appointed Chief Clerk of the U.S. Mint in San Francisco. As a politician, he had detractors who accused him of using his position in B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith to foster his political career. When refugees from the fire-stricken, poorer Jewish quarter of San Francisco came to Oakland, the synagogue provided immediate aid. Food and clothing were given to the needy and 350 people were given a place to sleep. For about a week the synagogue fed up to 500 people three times a day. A large part of the expenses were paid by the Jewish Ladies&#x27; organization of the synagogue.

=== New Orleans, Louisiana ===
Because of the Code Noir, Jews were excluded from the French territory of Louisiana until 1803. Abraham Cohen Labatt, a Sephardic Jew from South Carolina, helped found the first Jewish congregation in Louisiana in the 1830s. Leon Godchaux, a Jewish immigrant from Lorraine, opened a clothing business in 1844. Isidore Newman established the Maison Blanche store on Canal Street. In 1870, the city&#x27;s elite German Jews founded Temple Sinai, the first synagogue in New Orleans founded as a Reform congregation. Most Jews in New Orleans were loyal supporters of the Confederacy but Orthodox Eastern European Jews never outnumbered the Reform &quot;German Uptown&quot; Jews. Elizabeth D. A. Cohen was the first female physician in Louisiana. Leon C. Weiss became Governor Huey Long&#x27;s favorite architect, and designed the new state capitol in Baton Rouge. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, only about 70% of the city&#x27;s pre-Katrina Jewish population had returned.

=== Maine ===

Jews have been living in Maine for 200 years, with significant Jewish communities in Bangor as early as the 1840s and in Portland since the 1880s. The arrival of Susman Abrams in 1785 was followed by a history of immigration and settlement that parallels the history of Jewish immigration to the United States. What initially brought people to these various towns around Maine was the promise of work, often linked with opportunities that supported Maine&#x27;s shipbuilding, lumber and mill industries.

=== New York City, New York ===
In 1654, the first group of Jews came as refugees from Recife, Brazil to New Amsterdam, which became New York City. Over the years, German, Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews continued to arrive, playing an important part in the city&#x27;s history and cultural life. In the late 1800s and early 20th century, a wave of Ashkenazi Jews fleeing the pogroms in Eastern Europe came to the city, bringing New York&#x27;s Jewish population to over 1 million in 1910, the world&#x27;s largest Jewish population in any city at that time.

=== San Francisco, California ===

Jews formed a community in San Francisco during the California Gold Rush, 1848–55. Levi Strauss, founder of the first company to manufacture blue jeans (Levi Strauss &amp; Co.), and Harvey Milk, LGBT rights activist and politician, were famous Jewish San Franciscans.

==Progressive movement==
With the influx of Jews from Central and Eastern Europe many members of the Jewish community were attracted to labor and socialist movements and numerous Jewish newspapers such as &quot;Forwerts&quot; and &quot;Morgen Freiheit&quot; had a socialist orientation. Left wing organizations such as The Workmen&#x27;s Circle and the Jewish People&#x27;s Fraternal Order played an important part in Jewish community life until World War II.

Jewish Americans were not just involved in nearly every important social movement but in the forefront of promoting such issues as workers rights, civil rights, civil liberties, woman&#x27;s rights, freedom of religion, peace movements, and various other progressive causes such as fighting prejudice.

== Americanization ==
The rapid assimilation into American culture of recent immigrants, dubbed Americanization, was a high priority for the established German Jews. Jacob Schiff played a major role. As a wealthy German Jew, Schiff shaped key decisions providing help to Eastern European Jews and fought against immigration restriction. A Reform Jew, he backed the creation of the Jewish Theological Seminary even though it was a Conservative project. He took a stand favoring a modified form of Zionism, reversing his earlier opposition. Above all, Schiff believed that American Jewry could live in both the Jewish and American worlds, creating a balance that made possible an enduring American Jewish community.

The National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW), founded in Chicago in 1893, promoted philanthropy and the Americanization of newly arrived Jewish women. Responding to the plight of Jewish women and girls from Eastern Europe, the NCJW created its Department of Immigrant Aid to assist their travels. The NCJW&#x27;s Americanization program included assisting immigrants with housing, health, and employment problems, connecting them with organizations where women could begin to socialize, and conducting English classes while helping them maintain a strong Jewish identity. The council, pluralistic rather than conformist, continued its Americanization efforts and fought against restrictive immigration laws after World War I. At the forefront of its activities was the religious education of Jewish girls, who were ignored by the Orthodox community.

==Philanthropy==
Since the 1820s organized philanthropy has been a core value of the American Jewish community. In most cities the philanthropic organizations are the center of the Jewish community and activism is highly valued. Much of the money now goes to Israel, as well as hospitals and higher education; previously it went to poor Jews. This meant in the 1880-1930 era wealthy German Reform Jews were subsidizing poor Orthodox newcomers, and helping their process of Americanization, thus helping bridge the cultural gap. This convergence brought Jews into the political debates in the 1900-1930 period over immigration restriction. Jews were the leading opponents of restrictions, but could not stop their passage in 1924 or their use to keep out most refugees from Hitler in the 1930s.

Julius Rosenwald (1862–1932) moved to Chicago in the late 1880s. Purchasing a half-interest in 1895, he transformed a small mail order house Sears, Roebuck into the largest retailer in America. He used his wealth for philanthropy targeted especially at the plight of rural blacks in collaboration with Booker T. Washington. From 1917 to 1932 the Julius Rosenwald Foundation set up 5,357 public schools for blacks. He funded numerous hospitals for blacks in the South as well as 24 YMCA&#x27;s; he was a major contributor to the NAACP and the National Urban League. His major contributions to the University of Chicago and to various Jewish philanthropies were on a similar grand scale. He spent $11 million to fund the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry.

==Lynching of Leo Frank==
In 1913, a Jewish factory manager in Atlanta named Leo Frank was convicted for the murder of Mary Phagan, a 13-year-old Christian girl in his employ. Frank was sentenced to death. Today, the consensus of researchers is that Frank was wrongly convicted.

In response to attacks on Jews, in October 1913, Sigmund Livingston founded the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) under the sponsorship of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith. The Leo Frank affair was mentioned by Adolf Kraus when he announced the creation of the ADL, but was not the reason for the group&#x27;s founding. The ADL became the leading Jewish group fighting antisemitism in the United States.

In 1915, Georgia governor John Marshall Slaton, commuted Frank&#x27;s death sentence to life imprisonment. As a result of public outrage over this act, a Georgia mob kidnapped Frank from prison and lynched him.

On November 25, 1915, two months after Frank was lynched, a group led by William J. Simmons burned a cross on top of Stone Mountain, inaugurating a revival of the Ku Klux Klan. The event was attended by 15 charter members and a few aging survivors of the original Klan. The Klan disseminated the view that anarchists, communists and Jews were subverting American values and ideals.

==World War I==
Jewish American sympathies likewise broke along ethnic lines, with recently arrived Yiddish speaking Jews leaning towards support of Zionism, and the established German-American Jewish community largely opposed to it. In 1914–1916, there were few Jewish voices in favor of American entry into the war. Many regarded the British government as hostile to Jewish interests. New York City, with its well-organized Jewish community numbering 1.5 million Jews, was the center of anti-war activism.

Of greatest concern to Jews was the tsarist regime in Russia because it was notorious for tolerating pogroms and issuing antisemitic policies. As historian Joseph Rappaport reported through his study of Yiddish press during the war, &quot;The pro-Germanism of America&#x27;s immigrant Jews was an inevitable consequence of their Russophobia&quot;. The fall of the tsarist regime in March 1917 removed a major obstacle for many Jews who refused to support tsarism. The draft went smoothly in New York City, and left-wing opposition to the war largely collapsed when Zionists saw the possibility of using the war to demand a state of Israel.

The number of Jews who served in the American military during World War I was disproportionate to their representation in the American population at large. The 250,000 Jews who served represented approximately 5% of the American armed forces whereas Jews only constituted 3% of the general population.

Starting in 1914, the American Jewish community mobilized its resources to assist the victims of the European war. Cooperating to a degree not previously seen, the various factions of the American Jewish community—native-born and immigrant, Reform, Orthodox, secular, and socialist—coalesced to form what eventually became known as the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. All told, American Jews raised $63 million in relief funds during the war years and became more immersed in European Jewish affairs than ever before.

==1930s and World War II==

While earlier Jewish elements from Germany were business oriented and voted as conservative Republicans, the wave of Eastern European Jews starting in the 1880s, were more liberal or left wing and became the political majority. Many came to America with experience in the socialist and anarchist movements as well as the Bund, based in Eastern Europe. Many Jews rose to leadership positions in the early 20th century American labor movement and helped to found unions in the &quot;needle trades&quot; (clothing industry) that played a major role in the CIO and in Democratic Party politics. Sidney Hillman of the CIO was especially powerful in the early 1940s at the national level. By the 1930s, Jews were a major political factor in New York City, with strong support for the most liberal programs of the New Deal. However their leaders were excluded from the Irish-controlled Tammany Hall, which was in full charge of the Democratic Party in New York City. Therefore, they worked through third parties, such as the American Labor Party and the Liberal Party of New York. By the 1940s they were inside the Democratic Party, and helped overthrow Tammany Hall. They continued as a major element of the New Deal coalition, giving special support to the Civil Rights Movement. By the mid-1960s, however, the Black Power movement caused a growing separation between blacks and Jews, though both groups remained solidly in the Democratic camp.

In Washington, 15% of FDR&#x27;s appointees were Jewish, including top positions such as Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. in 1933 and Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter in 1939. Roosevelt&#x27;s programs were not designed to overthrow capitalism as the left wanted, but instead created economic opportunities for working-class city people, especially Catholics and Jews in their roles as voters in a dominant New Deal coalition and as union members. Roosevelt&#x27;s coalition was so delicate that he could not afford to let ethnic or racial tensions tear it apart. His deliberate policy (until &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in 1938) was not to publicly criticize the atrocities developing in Nazi Germany, nor the domestic anti-Semitism typified by Catholic priest Charles Coughlin which blamed Jews for the Great Depression and the international crises in Europe. As a result of what Roosevelt did accomplish, &quot;For liberal American Jews, the New Deal was a program worth fighting for even if it meant deferring concerns about the fate of German Jews.&quot; According to Henry Feingold, &quot;It was the welfare-state aspect of the New Deal, rather than Roosevelt&#x27;s foreign policy, which attracted the Jewish voter. The war and the holocaust tended to reinforce the left-wing political sentiments of many Jewish voters.&quot;

In the 1930s, increasing antisemitism in the United States (see History of Antisemitism in the United States) led to restrictions on Jewish American life from elite circles. Restrictions were mostly informal and affected Jewish presence in various universities, professions, and high-end housing communities. Many of the restrictions originated in the 1920s, but popularized and became more practiced throughout the 1930s and into the 1940s due to increasing antisemitic climate. In the East Coast, the Midwest, and the South, public and private universities imposed limits on the number of Jewish applicants they accepted, regardless of high scholastic standing. Harvard University believed that if it accepted students based only on merit, the student body would become majority Jewish, and for the same reason, the New Jersey College for Women (present-day Douglass College) only accepted 31% of Jewish applicants, versus 61% of all others. Similar patterns emerged among elite professions and communities. Law firms hired fewer Jewish lawyers, hospitals gave fewer patients to Jewish doctors, and universities hired fewer Jewish professors. Across the entire United States, only 100 Jewish American professors were employed in 1930. High-end housing communities across the United States, including the social clubs, resorts, and hotels within them, adhered to pacts that prevented Jewish Americans from buying homes and sleeping in rooms in their communities. These pacts limited high-end communities to American &quot;gentiles&quot;.

===Refugees from Nazi Germany===
In the period between 1934 and 1943, the Congress, the Roosevelt Administration, and public opinion expressed concern about the fate of Jews in Europe but consistently refused to permit large-scale immigration of Jewish refugees. In a report issued by the State Department, Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat noted that the United States accepted only 21,000 refugees from Europe and did not significantly raise or even fill its restrictive quotas, accepting far fewer Jews per capita than many of the neutral European countries and fewer in absolute terms than Switzerland.

According to David Wyman, &quot;The United States and its Allies were willing to attempt almost nothing to save the Jews.&quot;

===MS St. Louis===

The SS &quot;St. Louis&quot; sailed from Germany in May 1939 carrying 936 (mainly German) Jewish refugees. On 4 June 1939, it was also refused permission to unload on orders of President Roosevelt as the ship waited in the Caribbean Sea between Florida and Cuba. Initially, Roosevelt showed limited willingness to take in some of those on board. But the Immigration Act of 1924 made that illegal and public opinion was strongly opposed. The ship returned to Europe. 620 of the passengers were eventually accepted in continental Europe, of these only 365 survived the Holocaust.

===Immigration restrictions===

The United States&#x27; tight immigration policies were not lifted during the Holocaust, news of which began to reach the United States in 1941 and 1942 and it has been estimated that 190,000–200,000 Jews could have been saved during the Second World War had it not been for bureaucratic obstacles to immigration deliberately created by Breckinridge Long and others.

Asylum of the European Jewish population was not a priority for the U.S. during the war, and the American Jewish community did not realize the severity of the Holocaust until late in the conflict. This is in part because the Nazis did not allow Jews to leave Occupied Europe or Germany during this time.

===American Jewish response to The Holocaust===
During the World War II period the American Jewish community was bitterly and deeply divided, and was unable to form a common front. Most Eastern European Jews favored Zionism, which saw a return to their homeland as the only solution; this had the effect of diverting attention from the horrors in Nazi Germany. German Jews were alarmed at the Nazis but were disdainful of Zionism. Proponents of a Jewish state and Jewish army agitated, but many leaders were so fearful of an antisemitic backlash inside the U.S. that they demanded that all Jews keep a low public profile. One important development was the sudden conversion of most (but not all) Jewish leaders to Zionism late in the war.

The Holocaust was largely ignored by American media as it was happening. Why that was is illuminated by the anti-Zionist position taken by Arthur Hays Sulzberger, publisher of the &quot;New York Times,&quot; during World War II. Committed to classical Reform Judaism, which defined Judaism as a religious faith and not as a people, Sulzberger insisted that as an American he saw European Jews as part of a refugee problem, not separate from it. As publisher of the nation&#x27;s most influential newspaper, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he permitted only a handful of editorials during the war on the extermination of the Jews. He supported the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism. Even after it became known that the Nazis had singled out the Jews for destruction, Sulzberger held that all refugees had suffered. He opposed the creation of Israel. In effect, he muted the enormous potential influence of the &quot;Times&quot; by keeping issues of concern regarding Jews off the editorial page and burying stories about Nazi atrocities against Jews in short items deep inside the paper. In time he grew increasingly out of step with the American Jewish community by his persistent refusal to recognize Jews as a people and despite obvious flaws in his view of American democracy.

While Jews owned few prestigious newspapers other than the &quot;New York Times&quot;, they had a major presence in Hollywood and in network radio. Hollywood films and radio with few exceptions avoided questioning Nazi persecution of Europe&#x27;s Jews prior to Pearl Harbor. Jewish studio executives did not want to be accused of advocating Jewish propaganda by making films with overtly antifascist themes. Indeed, they were pressured by such organizations as the Anti-Defamation League and by national Jewish leaders to avoid such themes lest American Jews suffer an antisemitic backlash.

Despite strong public and political sentiment to the contrary, however, there were some who encouraged the U.S. government to help victims of Nazi genocide. In 1943, just before Yom Kippur, 400, mostly Orthodox, rabbis marched in Washington to draw attention to the plight of Holocaust victims. A week later, Senator William Warren Barbour (R; New Jersey), one of a handful of politicians who met with the rabbis on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, proposed legislation that would have allowed as many as 100,000 victims of the Holocaust to emigrate temporarily to the United States. Barbour died six weeks after introducing the bill, and it was not passed. A parallel bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Samuel Dickstein (D; New York). This also failed to pass.

During the Holocaust, fewer than 30,000 Jews a year reached the United States, and some were turned away due to immigration policies. The U.S. did not change its immigration policies until 1948.

As of 2021, laws requiring teaching of the Holocaust are on the books in 16 U.S. states.

====Impact====
The Holocaust had a profound impact on the community in the United States, especially after 1960, as Jews tried to comprehend what had happened, and especially to commemorate and grapple with it when looking to the future. Abraham Joshua Heschel summarized this dilemma when he attempted to understand Auschwitz: &quot;To try to answer is to commit a supreme blasphemy. Israel enables us to bear the agony of Auschwitz without radical despair, to sense a ray [of] God&#x27;s radiance in the jungles of history.&quot;

==Postwar==
500,000 American Jews (or half of the eligible men) fought in World War II, and after the war younger families joined the new trend of suburbanization. There, Jews became increasingly assimilated and demonstrated rising intermarriage. The suburbs facilitated the formation of new centers, as Jewish school enrollment more than doubled between the end of World War II and the mid-1950s, and synagogue affiliation jumped from 20% in 1930 to 60% in 1960; the fastest growth came in Reform and, especially, Conservative congregations.

Having never been subjected to the Holocaust, the United States stood after the Second World War as the largest, richest, and healthiest center of Judaism in the world. Smaller Jewish communities turned increasingly to American Jewry for guidance and support.

Immediately after the Second World War, some Jewish refugees resettled in the United States, and another wave of Jewish refugees from Arab nations settled in the U.S. after expulsion from their home countries.

===Politics===
American Jews voted 90% against the Republicans and supported Democrats Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman in the elections of 1940, 1944 and 1948, despite both party platforms supporting the creation of a Jewish state in the latter two elections. During the 1952 and 1956 elections, they voted 60% or more for Democrat Adlai Stevenson, while General Eisenhower garnered 40% for his reelection; the best showing to date for the Republicans since Harding&#x27;s 43% in 1920. In 1960, 83% voted for Democrat John F. Kennedy, a Catholic, against Richard Nixon, and in 1964, 90% of American Jews voted for Lyndon Johnson; his Republican opponent, Barry Goldwater, was raised Episcopalian but his paternal grandparents were Jewish. Hubert Humphrey garnered 81% of the Jewish vote in the 1968 elections, in his losing bid for president against Richard Nixon; such a high level of Jewish support has not been seen since.

During the Nixon re-election campaign of 1972, Jewish voters were apprehensive about George McGovern and only favored the Democrat by 65%, while Nixon more than doubled Republican Jewish support to 35%. In the election of 1976, Jewish voters supported Democrat Jimmy Carter by 71% over incumbent president Gerald Ford&#x27;s 27%, but in 1980 they abandoned Carter, leaving him with only 45% support, while Republican winner, Ronald Reagan, garnered 39%, and 14% went to independent John Anderson.

During the Reagan re-election campaign of 1984, the Jews returned home to the Democratic Party, giving Reagan only 31% compared to 67% for Democrat Walter Mondale. The same 2–1 pattern reappeared in 1988 as Democrat Michael Dukakis had 64%, while victorious George Bush polled 35%. Bush&#x27;s Jewish support collapsed during his re-election in 1992, to just 11%, with 80% voting for Bill Clinton and 9% going to independent Ross Perot. Clinton&#x27;s re-election campaign in 1996 maintained high Jewish support at 78%, with 16% supporting Bob Dole and 3% supporting Perot.

In the 2000 US Presidential Election, Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, was chosen by Al Gore to be his running mate and the vice presidential candidate for the Democratic Party, marking the first time in history that a practicing Jew was included on a major party&#x27;s presidential ticket.

Bernie Sanders won the New Hampshire Democratic primary on February 9, 2016, by 22.4% of the vote (60.4% to Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 38.0%); he received strong support from voters who considered it important to nominate a candidate who is &quot;honest and trustworthy.&quot; This made him the first Jewish American to win a U.S. presidential primary.(Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican presidential nominee, was the first winner of Jewish heritage, but was a Christian).

===Exceptionalism===
Historians believe American Jewish history has been characterized by an unparalleled degree of freedom, acceptance, and prosperity that has made it possible for Jews to bring together their ethnic identities with the demands of national citizenship far more effortlessly than Jews in Europe. American Jewish exceptionalism differentiates Jews from other American ethnic groups by means of educational and economic attainments and, indeed, by virtue of Jewish values, including a devotion to political liberalism. Historian Marc Dollinger has found that for the last century the most secular Jews have tended toward the most liberal or even leftist political views, while more religious Jews are politically more conservative. Modern Orthodox Jews have been less active in political movements than Reform Jews. They vote Republican more often than less traditional Jews. In contemporary political debate, strong Orthodox support for various school voucher initiatives undermines the exceptionalist belief that the Jewish community seeks a high and impenetrable barrier between church and state.

Most of the discussions of American Exceptionalism refer to the nation as a whole. However, there have been discussions of how American Exceptionalism has applied to specific subgroups, especially minorities. Scholars comparing the record of persecution of Jews in Europe and the Middle East with the highly favorable circumstances in the United States, debate to what extent the American treatment of Jews has been unique in world history, and how much it has become a model of pluralism at least in regards to this group.

===Creation of the State of Israel===
With its establishment in 1948, the State of Israel became the focal point of American Jewish life and philanthropy, as well as the symbol around which American Jews united.

===Six-Day War===
The Six-Day War of June 1967 marked a turning point in the lives of many 1960s-era Jews. The paralyzing fear of a &quot;second Holocaust&quot; followed by tiny Israel&#x27;s seemingly miraculous victory over the combined Arab armies arrayed to destroy it struck deep emotional chords among American Jews. Their financial support for Israel rose sharply in the war&#x27;s wake, and more of them than ever before chose in those years to make Israel their permanent home.

A lively internal debate commenced, following the Six-Day War. The American Jewish community was divided over whether they agreed with the Israeli response; the great majority came to accept the war as necessary. A tension existed especially for leftist Jews, between their liberal ideology and Zionist backing in the midst of this conflict. This deliberation about the Six-Day War showed the depth and complexity of Jewish responses to the varied events of the 1960s.

===Civil rights===
Jews proved to be strong supporters of the American Civil Rights Movement. Jews were highly visible as leaders of movements for civil rights for all Americans, including themselves and African Americans. Seymour Siegel argues the historic struggle against prejudice faced by Jewish people led to a natural sympathy for any people confronting discrimination. This further led Jews to discuss the relationship they had with African Americans. Jewish leaders spoke at the two iconic marches of the era. Joachim Prinz, president of the American Jewish Congress, appeared at the March on Washington on 28 August 1963, noting that &quot;As Jews we bring to this great demonstration, in which thousands of us proudly participate, a twofold experience--one of the spirit and one of our history&quot; Two years later Abraham Joshua Heschel of the Jewish Theological Seminary marched in the front row of the Selma-to-Montgomery march.

Within Judaism, increasing involvement in the civil rights movement caused some tension. Rabbi Bernard Wienberger exemplified this point of view, warning that &quot;northern liberal Jews&quot; put at risk southern Jews who faced hostility from white southerners because of their northern counterparts. However, most known Jewish responses to the civil rights movement and black relations lean toward acceptance and against prejudice, as the disproportionate involvement of Jews in the movement would indicate. Despite this history of participation, relations between African Americans and Jews have sometimes been strained by their close proximity and class differences, especially in New York and other urban areas.

===Jewish feminism===

In its modern form, the Jewish feminist movement can be traced to the early 1970s in the United States. According to Judith Plaskow, who has focused on feminism in Reform Judaism, the main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or &quot;minyan&quot;, the exemption from positive time-bound &quot;mitzvot&quot;, and women&#x27;s inability to function as witnesses, and to initiate divorce. Sally Priesand was ordained by the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion on June 3, 1972, at the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati, thus becoming America&#x27;s first female rabbi ordained by a rabbinical seminary, and the second formally ordained female rabbi in Jewish history, after Regina Jonas.

===Immigration from the Soviet Union===
The last large wave of immigration came from the Soviet Union after 1988, in response to heavy political pressure from the U.S. government. After the 1967 Six-Day War and the liberalization tide in Eastern Europe in 1968, Soviet policy became more restrictive. Jews were denied educational and vocational opportunities. These restrictive policies led to the emergence of a new political group—the &#x27;refuseniks&#x27;—whose main goal was emigrating. The refuseniks (Jews who were refused exit visas) attracted the attention of the West, particularly the United States, and became an important factor influencing economic and trade relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. The 1975 Jackson Amendment to the Trade Reform Act linked granting the USSR &#x27;most favored nation&#x27; status to liberalization of Soviet emigration laws.

Beginning in 1967 the Soviet Union allowed some Jewish citizens to leave for family reunification in Israel. Due to the break in diplomatic relations between Israel and the USSR, most émigrés traveled to Vienna, Austria, or Budapest, Hungary, from where they were then flown to Israel. After 1976 the majority of émigrés who left on visas for Israel &#x27;dropped out&#x27; in Vienna and chose to resettle in the West. Several American Jewish organizations helped them obtain visas and aided their resettlement in the United States and other countries. However Israel wanted them and tried to prevent Soviet Jewish émigrés from resettling in the United States after having committed to immigrating to Israel. Israeli officials pressured American Jewish organizations to desist from aiding Russian Jews who wanted to resettle in the United States. Initially, American Jews resisted Israeli efforts. Following Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s decision in the late 1980s to allow free emigration for Soviet Jews, the American Jewish community agreed to a quota on Soviet Jewish refugees in the U.S., which resulted in most Soviet Jewish émigrés settling in Israel.

The Russian Jewish population in the United States is the second only to the population of Russian Jews in Israel. According to RINA, there is a core Russian-Jewish population of 350,000 in the U.S. The enlarged Russian Jewish population in the U.S. is estimated to be 700,000. Some 100,000 Ashkenazi and Bukharian Jews emigrated to the United States. Large pockets of Russian-Jewish Communities include Brooklyn, New York, specifically Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay, and in the Sunny Isles Beach neighborhood of South Florida. Another large pocket of Russian Jewish residence is Northeast Philadelphia and surrounding Bucks and Montgomery Counties, as well as Northern New Jersey.

==Local developments 20th and 21st centuries==

=== Nashville, Tennessee ===
Reform Jews, predominantly German, became Nashville&#x27;s largest and most influential Jewish community in the first half of the 20th century; they enjoyed good relations with the Orthodox and Conservative congregations. Some German Jewish refugees resettled in Nashville from 1935 to 1939, helped by prominent Nashville families. Both the Orthodox and Conservative congregations had relocated their synagogues to the suburbs by 1949, and the entire Jewish community had shifted southwest by about five miles. Although subtle social discrimination existed, Nashville&#x27;s Jews enjoyed the respect of the larger community. Public acceptance, however, required complicity in racial segregation. The Observer, Nashville&#x27;s Jewish newspaper, tried to find a middle ground between assimilation and particularism, but after years of calling for group solidarity, accepted that the Jewish community was pluralistic.

=== Palm Springs, California ===
About 32,000 Jews reside in the Palm Springs area, reports the United Jewish Congress of the Desert. The world-famous desert resort community has been widely known for its Hollywood celebrities. Philadelphia publisher Walter Annenberg opened the Tamarisk Country Club in 1946, after being refused membership in the Los Angeles Lakeside country club. But his connections with Hollywood and corporations alike made his country club a success, and made it a policy to allow Jews and all people, regardless of race and religion, to have access to his facility.

Many elderly American Jews from the East coast and the Los Angeles metropolitan area come to retire in the warm climates such as the Coachella Valley, favoring golf course and mobile home communities. By the 1990s they were a large component of demography in the desert resort. There are 12 Jewish places of worship, including a Jewish community center in Palm Desert, where an estimated 20–25 percent of the population are of Jewish descent.

Palm Springs has the annual &quot;Winter Festival of Lights&quot; parade, which began as a separate parade to celebrate Chanukah in the 1960s. Over time, that and the Christmas-themed parade merged into the one celebrating the season&#x27;s lights of menorahs, Christmas trees and the calendar new year.

=== Miami ===
After 1945 many northeastern Jews moved to Florida, especially to Miami, Miami Beach, and nearby cities. They found familiar foods and better weather, and founded more open, less tradition-bound communities, where greater materialism and more leisure-oriented, less disciplined Judaism developed. Many relaxed their religiosity and attended services only during Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. In South Florida synagogue affiliation, Jewish community center membership, and per capita contributions to the United Jewish Appeal and the Jewish Federation are among the lowest of any Jewish community in the United States.

=== Princeton, New Jersey ===
The development of Jewish (particularly Orthodox) student life at Princeton University improved rapidly since the end of World War II, when Jewish students were few and isolated. In 1958 Jewish students were more numerous; they protested against the Bicker system of eating club member selection. In 1961 Yavneh House was established as Princeton&#x27;s first kosher kitchen. In 1971 Stevenson Hall opened as a university-managed kosher eating facility in the midst of the older private eating clubs. Jewish student initiative and Princeton administration openness deserve credit for this progress.

=== Beverly Hills, California ===
An estimated 20-25 percent of the population of this affluent Los Angeles suburb is Jewish, and about 20 percent is Persian. About a quarter of the membership of Sinai Temple, a prominent synagogue in nearby Westwood, is Persian Jews who largely came to the United States in the aftermath of the Islamic Revolution in Iran.

=== New York City ===

, New York state has an estimated Jewish population of about 1.8 million; of these 1.1 million live in New York City.

==Rise to affluence in the 20th century==
In 1983, economist Thomas Sowell of Stanford University wrote &quot;Jewish family incomes are the highest of any large ethnic group in the US—72% above the national average.&quot; Sowell points out that Episcopalians have also experienced similar prosperity—as a group—as Jews, but it is the &quot;social and economic distance covered in a relatively short time&quot; that makes the Jewish experience in America unique.

Gerald Krefetz discusses the prosperity that Jews earned in the United States following their emigration from Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, and he attributes their success to their familiarity with &quot;trading and exchanging, commerce, city living, property rights, ... and accumulation of funds for future investment.&quot;

Historian Edward S. Shapiro cites a &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine survey from the 1980s, which showed that, of the 400 richest Americans, over 100 were Jewish, which was nine times greater than would be expected based on the overall population. Shapiro also estimates that over 30% of American billionaires are Jewish, and he cites a 1986 issue of &quot;Financial World&quot; that listed the top 100 money makers in 1985, and &quot;half the people mentioned&quot; were Jewish, including George Soros, Asher Edelman, Michael Milken, and Ivan Boesky.

Very few Jewish lawyers were hired by White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (&quot;WASP&quot;) upscale, white-shoe law firms, but they started their own. The WASP dominance in law ended when a number of major Jewish law firms attained elite status in dealing with top-ranked corporations. As late as 1950 there was not a single large Jewish law firm in New York City. However, by 1965 six of the 20 largest firms were Jewish; by 1980 four of the ten largest were Jewish.

By the 1990s Jews were becoming prominent in Congress and state governments throughout the country.

==Current situation==


American Jews continued to prosper throughout the early 21st century. According to a 2016 study by the Pew Research Center, Jewish ranked as the most financially successful religious group in the United States, with 44% of Jews living in households with incomes of at least $100,000, followed by Hindu (36%), Episcopalians (35%), and Presbyterians (32%), though owing to their numbers, more Catholics (13.3 million) reside in households with a yearly income of $100,000 or more than any other religious group. The 2021 Forbes 400 includes several Jews among the top 10 wealthiest Americans: Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Larry Ellison, Steve Ballmer, and Michael Bloomberg. American Jews are disproportionately represented in business, academia and politics. Thirty percent of American Nobel prize winners in science and 37 percent of all American Nobel winners are Jewish. 

However, a 2007 study found that 15% of American Jews live below the poverty line; the 2016 Pew study found that number to be 16%. A 2019 study found 20% of American Jews to be in or near poverty, with 45% of Jewish children living in poor or near-poor households. The percentage of Jews at Ivy League Universities has dropped steadily in the past decade.

Demographically, the population is not increasing. With their success, American Jews have become increasingly assimilated into American culture, with high intermarriage rates resulting in either a falling or steady population rate at a time when the country was booming. It has not grown appreciably since 1960, comprises a smaller percentage of America&#x27;s total population than it had in 1910, and seems likely to witness an actual decline in numbers in the decades ahead.

Jews also began to move to the suburbs, with major population shifts from New York and the Northeast to Florida and California. New Jewish organizations were founded to accommodate an increasing range of Jewish worship and community activities, as well as geographic dispersal.

Politically, the Jewish population remained strongly liberal. The heavily Democratic pattern continued into the 21st century. Since 1936 the great majority of Jews have been Democrats. In 2004 74% of Jews voted for Democrat John Kerry, a Catholic of partial Jewish descent, and in 2006 87% voted for Democratic candidates for the House.

===Self identity===
Social historians analyze the American population in terms of class, race, ethnicity, religion, gender, region and urbanism. Jewish scholars generally emphasize ethnicity. First, it reflects the suppression of the term &quot;Jewish race,&quot; a contested but fairly common usage right into the 1930s and its replacement by the more acceptable &quot;ethnic&quot; usage. Second, it reflects a post-religious evaluation of American Jewish identity, in which &quot;Jewishness&quot; (rather than &quot;Judaism&quot;) is taken to be more inclusive, embracing the secularized as well as the religious experiences of Jews.

Korelitz (1996) shows how American Jews during the late 19th and early 20th centuries abandoned a racial definition of Jewishness in favor of one that embraced ethnicity and culture. The key to understanding this transition from a racial self-definition to a cultural or ethnic one can be found in the &quot;Menorah Journal&quot; between 1915 and 1925. During this time contributors to the Menorah promoted a cultural, rather than a racial, religious, or other view of Jewishness as a means to define Jews in a world that threatened to overwhelm and absorb Jewish uniqueness. The journal represented the ideals of the menorah movement established by Horace Kallen and others to promote a revival in Jewish cultural identity and combat the idea of race as a means to define or identify peoples.

Siporin (1990) uses the family folklore of &quot;ethnic&quot; Jews to their collective history and its transformation into an historical art form. They tell us how Jews have survived being uprooted and transformed. Many immigrant narratives bear a theme of the arbitrary nature of fate and the reduced state of immigrants in a new culture. By contrast, ethnic family narratives tend to show the ethnic more in charge of his life, and perhaps in danger of losing his Jewishness altogether. Some stories show how a family member successfully negotiated the conflict between ethnic and American identities.

After 1960 memories of the Holocaust, together with the Six-Day War in 1967 that resulted in the survival of Israel had major impacts on fashioning Jewish ethnic identity. The provided Jews with a rationale for their ethnic distinction at a time when other minorities were asserting their own.

==Antisemitism in the United States==
During the Civil War, General Ulysses S. Grant issued an order (quickly rescinded by President Abraham Lincoln) of expulsion against Jews from the portions of Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi which were under his control. (&quot;See General Order No. 11&quot;)

Antisemitism continued to be widespread in the United States into the first half of the 20th century. Jews were discriminated against in some fields of employment, they were not allowed to join some social clubs and they were also not allowed to stay in some resort areas, their enrollment at colleges was limited by quotas, and they were also not allowed to buy certain properties. In response, Jews established their own country clubs, summer resorts, and universities, such as Brandeis.

Antisemitism in America reached its peak during the interwar period. The rise of the second Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s, the antisemitic works of Henry Ford, and the radio speeches of Father Coughlin in the late 1930s indicated the intensity of attacks on the Jewish community.

Antisemitism in the United States has rarely erupted into physical violence against Jews. Some notable cases in which acts of violence were committed against Jews in the United States include the attack on the funeral procession of Rabbi Jacob Joseph by Irish workers and police in New York City in 1902, the lynching of Leo Frank in 1915, the murder of Alan Berg in 1984, and the Crown Heights riot of 1991.

Following the Second World War and the American Civil Rights Movement, anti-Jewish sentiment waned. However, some members of the Nation of Islam and some members of other Black Nationalist organizations accused Jews of exploiting black laborers, bringing alcohol and drugs into black communities, and unfairly dominating the economy. Furthermore, according to annual surveys which have been conducted by the Anti-Defamation League since 1964, a Jewish organization, African Americans are significantly more likely to hold antisemitic beliefs than white Americans are, but among members of all races, there is a strong correlation between a person&#x27;s level of education and his or her rejection of antisemitic stereotypes. However, black Americans of all education levels are significantly more likely to be antisemitic than whites who are of the same education level. In the 1998 survey, blacks (34%) were nearly four times more likely (9%) to fall into the most antisemitic category (those who agreed with at least 6 out of 11 statements that were potentially or clearly antisemitic) than whites were. Among blacks with no college education, 43% of them fell into the most antisemitic group (vs. 18% of the general population), which fell to 27% among blacks with some college education, and 18% among blacks with a four-year college degree (vs. 5% of the general population).

The 2005 Anti-Defamation League survey includes data on the attitudes of Hispanics, with 29% of Hispanics being the most antisemitic (vs. 9% of whites and 36% of blacks); being born in the United States helped alleviate this attitude: 35% of foreign-born Hispanics were antisemitic, but only 19% of those Hispanics who were born in the U.S. were antisemitic.

As an example of religious tensions, in 2010, a widespread debate erupted over the building of an Islamic cultural center and a mosque in New York City near the World Trade Center site. The city of New York has officially endorsed the project, but nationwide, public opinion has been hostile. A &quot;Time&quot; poll of 1000 individuals which was conducted in August 2010 indicated that only 13 percent of Americans have unfavorable views of Jews, by contrast, the same pole indicated that 43 percent of Americans have unfavorable views of Muslims, however, only 17 percent of Americans have unfavorable views of Catholics and only 29 percent of Americans have unfavorable views of Mormons according to the pole. By contrast, antisemitic attitudes are much higher in Europe and are growing.

A July 2013 report which was published by the Anti-Defamation League indicated that there had been a 14 percent decline in the number of recorded antisemitic incidents across the United States. The audit of the 2012 records identified 17 physical assaults, 470 cases of harassment or threat, and 440 cases of vandalism in which the target was Jewish and the alleged motive was hatred.

In April 2014, the Anti-Defamation League published its 2013 audit of antisemitic incidents. According to the audit, the number of recorded antisemitic incidents had declined by 19 percent in 2013. The total number of antisemitic attacks which had occurred across the U.S. in 2013 was 751, including 31 physical assaults, 315 incidents of vandalism and 405 cases of harassment.

In the first few months of 2014, at least two antisemitic incidents of swastika drawings on Jewish belongings occurred in universities. On April 1, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan arrived at the Jewish center of Kansas City and murdered three people, two of whom were on their way to the church. After his capture, the suspect was heard saying &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;. Later that month a sprayed swastika was found in Price Hill, Cincinnati, on the door of a Jewish family&#x27;s house. In May 2014, the Vassar Students for Justice in Palestine published a Nazi World War II propaganda poster. The poster displays Jews as part of a monster who tries to destroy the world. Vassar college president Catharine Hill denounced the antisemitic post.

As a result of operation Protective Edge, there were more antisemitic attacks during July. Some of the attacks were directly connected to the operation, such as graffiti paintings of swastika and the word &quot;Hamas&quot; outside a synagogue in South Florida.

Another antisemitic trend which is spreading across the country is the republication of antisemitic leaflets which were originally published in Nazi Germany. In August 2014, two cases of this occurred, one case of this occurred during a pro-Palestinian rally which was held in Chicago and the other case of this occurred in Westwood, Los Angeles, where a Jewish store owner received handwritten flyers which contained swastikas and threats. Earlier that year the SJP in Poughkeepsie published on Twitter an antisemitic picture first published in Germany in 1944.

In September 2014, the &quot;New York Post&quot; released the contents of a report which was originally published by the NYPD. The report stated that since 2013, the number of antisemitic incidents in the city had increased by 35%. On the other hand, a report of the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations revealed a significant decrease of 48 percent in anti-Jewish crimes in LA compared to 2013.

In October 2014, the Anti-Defamation League published a report which documented Anti-Israel activities on campuses after Protective Edge. The report emphasizes that protests and rallies against Israel frequently become antisemitic:

Not all criticism of Israel is anti-Israel in nature, and not all anti-Israel rhetoric and activity reflect antisemitism. However, anti-Israel sentiment increasingly crosses the line to antisemitism by invoking antisemitic myths of Jewish control and demonic depictions of Israelis or comparing Israel&#x27;s actions to those of the Nazis during the Holocaust.

A survey which was published in February 2015 by Trinity College and the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law found that 54 percent of its participants had been subjected to or had witnessed antisemitism on their campuses. The survey included 1,157 self-identified Jewish students at 55 campuses nationwide. The most significant origin for antisemitism, according to the survey, was &quot;from an individual student&quot; (29 percent). Other origins were in clubs or societies, in lectures and classes, and in student unions. The findings of the research were similar to a parallel study conducted in the United Kingdom.

In April 2015, the Anti-Defamation League published its 2014 audit of antisemitic incidents. According to it, there were 912 antisemitic incidents across the U.S. during 2014. This represents a 21 percent increase from the 751 incidents which were reported during the same period in 2013. Most of the incidents (513) belonged to the category of &quot;harassments, threats and events&quot;. Another finding of the audit shows that most of the vandalism incidents occurred in public areas (35%). A review of the results shows that during operation Protective Edge there was a significant increase in the number of antisemitic incidents, as compared to the rest of the year. As usual, the highest totals of antisemitic incidents occurred in states with large Jewish populations: New York State – 231 incidents, California – 184 incidents, New Jersey – 107 incidents, Florida – 70 incidents. In all of these states, more antisemitic incidents were counted in 2014 than in the previous year. In the first two months of 2017, nearly 50 bomb threats were made to Jewish community centers across the country.

After the massacres of October 7th, the United States saw the most significant explosion of antisemitism in American history.

==Jewish historical archives and collections==
===Audio interviews===
The University of Pittsburgh houses and has made available a collection of audio interviews produced by the NCJW. Over one hundred audio interviews produced by the Pittsburgh Chapter of NCJW are available online. Those interviewed describe their interactions and affiliations with historical events such as emigration, synagogue events, professional activities and other topics with which they were personally involved. These interviews also include information about personal life events, episodes of discrimination against Jews, moving from Europe to America, meeting Enrico Caruso, Robert Oppenheimer, Jonas Salk and other historical figures. Others that were interviewed came to America but were born elsewhere. Jews from Austria, Brazil, Cuba, Haiti, Hungary, India, Israel, Korea, Poland, and other countries describe their experiences.

<text>Invariance of domain is a theorem in topology about homeomorphic subsets of Euclidean space formula_1. 
It states: 
:If formula_2 is an open subset of formula_1 and formula_4 is an injective continuous map, then formula_5 is open in formula_1 and formula_7 is a homeomorphism between formula_2 and formula_9.

The theorem and its proof are due to L. E. J. Brouwer, published in 1912. 
The proof uses tools of algebraic topology, notably the Brouwer fixed point theorem.

==Notes==

The conclusion of the theorem can equivalently be formulated as: &quot;formula_7 is an open map&quot;.

Normally, to check that formula_7 is a homeomorphism, one would have to verify that both formula_7 and its inverse function formula_13 are continuous; 
the theorem says that if the domain is an subset of formula_1 and the image is also in formula_15 then continuity of formula_13 is automatic. 
Furthermore, the theorem says that if two subsets formula_2 and formula_9 of formula_1 are homeomorphic, and formula_2 is open, then formula_9 must be open as well. 
(Note that formula_9 is open as a subset of formula_15 and not just in the subspace topology. 
Openness of formula_9 in the subspace topology is automatic.) 
Both of these statements are not at all obvious and are not generally true if one leaves Euclidean space.
It is of crucial importance that both domain and image of formula_7 are contained in Euclidean space . 
Consider for instance the map formula_26 defined by formula_27 
This map is injective and continuous, the domain is an open subset of formula_28, but the image is not open in formula_29 
A more extreme example is the map formula_30 defined by formula_31 because here formula_32 is injective and continuous but does not even yield a homeomorphism onto its image.

The theorem is also not generally true in infinitely many dimensions. Consider for instance the Banach space formula_33 of all bounded real sequences. 
Define formula_34 as the shift formula_35 
Then formula_7 is injective and continuous, the domain is open in formula_33, but the image is not.

==Consequences==

If formula_38, there exists no continuous injective map formula_39 for a nonempty open set formula_40. To see this, suppose there exists such a map formula_41 Composing formula_7 with the standard inclusion of formula_43 into formula_1 would give a continuous injection from formula_1 to itself, but with an image with empty interior in formula_1. This would contradict invariance of domain.

In particular, if formula_47, no nonempty open subset of formula_1 can be homeomorphic to an open subset of formula_43.

And formula_1 is not homeomorphic to formula_43 if formula_52

==Generalizations==

The domain invariance theorem may be generalized to manifolds: if formula_53 and formula_54 are topological -manifolds without boundary and formula_55 is a continuous map which is locally one-to-one (meaning that every point in formula_53 has a neighborhood such that formula_7 restricted to this neighborhood is injective), then formula_7 is an open map (meaning that formula_59 is open in formula_54 whenever formula_2 is an open subset of formula_53) and a local homeomorphism.

There are also generalizations to certain types of continuous maps from a Banach space to itself.

Some of his best known films are &quot;Audition&quot;, &quot;Ichi the Killer&quot;, &quot;Visitor Q&quot;, &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, &quot;One Missed Call&quot;, and various remakes: &quot;13 Assassins&quot;, &quot;Hara-kiri&quot;, and &quot;Graveyard of Honor&quot;. He has also acted in more than 20 films.

==Early life==
Miike was born in Yao, Osaka Prefecture. During World War II, his grandfather was stationed in China and Korea, and his father was born in Seoul in today&#x27;s South Korea. His father worked as a welder and his mother as a seamstress. Although he claimed to have attended classes only rarely, he graduated from Yokohama Vocational School of Broadcast and Film (Yokohama Hōsō Eiga Senmon Gakkō) under the guidance of renowned filmmaker Shohei Imamura, the founder and Dean of that institution.

==Career==
Miike&#x27;s first films were television productions, but he also began directing several direct-to-video V-Cinema releases. Miike still directs V-Cinema productions intermittently, due to the creative freedom afforded by the less stringent censorship of the medium and the riskier content that the producers will allow.

Miike&#x27;s theatrical debut was the film &quot;The Third Gangster&quot; (&quot;Daisan no gokudō&quot;), but &quot;Shinjuku Triad Society&quot; (1995) was his first theatrical release to gain public attention. The film showcased his extreme style and his recurring themes, and its success allowed him to work on higher-budgeted pictures. &quot;Shinjuku Triad Society&quot; was the first film in what is labeled his &quot;Black Society Trilogy&quot;, which also includes &quot;Rainy Dog&quot; (1997) and &quot;Ley Lines&quot; (1999). He gained international fame in 2000 when his romantic horror film &quot;Audition&quot; (1999), his violent yakuza epic &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; (1999), and his controversial adaptation of the manga &quot;Ichi the Killer&quot; played at international film festivals. He has since gained a strong cult following in the West that is growing with the increase in DVD releases of his works. His film &quot;Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai&quot; premiered In Competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. His 2013 film &quot;Straw Shield&quot; was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.

==Themes of his work==
Miike achieved notoriety for depicting shocking scenes of extreme violence and sexual perversions. Many of his films contain graphic and lurid bloodshed, often portrayed in an over-the-top, cartoonish manner. Much of his work depicts the activities of criminals (especially yakuza) or concern themselves with gaijin, non-Japanese or foreigners living in Japan. He is known for his dark sense of humor and for pushing the boundaries of censorship as far as they will go.

Miike has directed films in a range of genres. He has created lighthearted children&#x27;s films (&quot;Ninja Kids!!!&quot;, &quot;The Great Yokai War&quot;), period pieces (&quot;Sabu&quot;), a road movie (&quot;The Bird People in China&quot;), a teen drama (&quot;Andromedia&quot;), a farcical musical comedy horror (&quot;The Happiness of the Katakuris&quot;), video game adaptations (&quot;Like a Dragon&quot;, &quot;Ace Attorney&quot;), manga adaptations (&quot;Blade of the Immortal&quot;, &quot;Jojo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable&quot;, &quot;Terra Formers&quot;, &quot;The Mole Song&quot; Trilogy) and character driven crime dramas (&quot;Ley Lines&quot;, &quot;Agitator&quot;).

While Miike often creates films that are less accessible and target arthouse audiences and fans of extreme cinema, such as &quot;Izo&quot; and the &quot;Box&quot; segment in &quot;Three... Extremes&quot;, he has created several mainstream and commercial titles such as the horror film &quot;One Missed Call&quot; and the fantasy drama &quot;The Great Yokai War&quot;.

Miike has cited &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; as his favorite film. He expressed admiration for directors Akira Kurosawa, Hideo Gosha, David Lynch, David Cronenberg, and Paul Verhoeven.

==Controversies==
Several of Miike&#x27;s films have been subject to scrutiny due to heavy violence. His 2001 horror film &quot;Ichi the Killer&quot;, adapted from a manga of the same name and starring Tadanobu Asano as a sadomasochistic yakuza enforcer, was highly controversial; during its international premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2001, the audience received &quot;barf bags&quot; emblazoned with the film&#x27;s logo as a promotional gimmick. The British Board of Film Classification refused to allow the release of the film uncut in the United Kingdom, citing its extreme levels of sexual violence towards women; the film required 3 minutes and 15 seconds of mandated cuts to be allowed release. In Hong Kong, 16 minutes and 59 seconds of footage were cut. &quot;Ichi the Killer&quot; was also banned outright in Norway, Germany and Malaysia.

In 2005, Miike was invited to direct an episode of the &quot;Masters of Horror&quot; anthology series. The series, featuring episodes by a range of established horror directors such as John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper and Dario Argento, was supposed to provide directors with relative creative freedom and relaxed restrictions on violent and sexual content (some sexual content was edited from the Argento-directed episode &quot;Jenifer&quot;). However, when the Showtime cable network acquired the rights to the series, Miike&#x27;s episode, &quot;Imprint&quot;, was deemed too disturbing for the network. Showtime cancelled it from the broadcast lineup even after extended negotiations, though it was retained as part of the series&#x27; DVD release. Mick Garris, creator and executive producer of the series, described the episode as &quot;amazing, but hard even for me to watch... definitely the most disturbing film I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. While &quot;Imprint&quot; has yet to air in the United States, it has aired on Bravo in the United Kingdom, on FX in Mexico, South and Central America, the Dominican Republic, France, Israel, Turkey, on Nelonen in Finland, and on Rai Tre in Italy. Anchor Bay Entertainment, which has handled the DVD releases for the &quot;Masters of Horror&quot; series in the US, released &quot;Imprint&quot; uncut on Region 1 DVD on September 26, 2006.

<text>The United States Fleet Forces Command (USFFC) is a service component command of the United States Navy that provides naval forces to a wide variety of U.S. forces. The naval resources may be allocated to Combatant Commanders such as United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) under the authority of the Secretary of Defense. Originally formed as United States Atlantic Fleet (USLANTFLT) in 1906, it has been an integral part of the defense of the United States of America since the early 20th century. In 2002, the Fleet comprised over 118,000 Navy and Marine Corps personnel serving on 186 ships and in 1,300 aircraft, with an area of responsibility ranging over most of the Atlantic Ocean from the North Pole to the South Pole, the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the waters of the Pacific Ocean along the coasts of Central and South America (as far west as the Galapagos Islands).

In 2006 the U.S. Atlantic Fleet was renamed United States Fleet Forces Command.

The command is based at Naval Support Activity Hampton Roads in Norfolk, Virginia and is the Navy&#x27;s service component to U.S. Northern Command and is the Joint Functional Maritime Component Command under the U.S. Strategic Command.

The command&#x27;s mission is to organize, man, train, and equip naval forces for assignment to Unified Command Combatant commanders; to deter, detect, and defend against homeland maritime threats; and to articulate Fleet warfighting and readiness requirements to the Chief of Naval Operations.

==History==
===Expansion and contraction===
The Atlantic Fleet was established by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906, at the same time as the Pacific Fleet, as protection for new bases in the Caribbean acquired as a result of the Spanish–American War. The Fleet was a combination of the North Atlantic Fleet and the South Atlantic Squadron.

The first commander of the fleet was Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans, who hoisted his flag in the battleship on 1 January 1906. The following year, he took his 16 battleships, now dubbed the Great White Fleet, on a round-the-world cruise that lasted until 1909, a goodwill tour that also served the purpose of advertising the United States&#x27; naval strength and reach to all other nations of the globe.

In January 1913 the fleet consisted of six first-line divisions, a torpedo flotilla, submarines, and fleet auxiliaries. The fleet was under the command of Rear Admiral Hugo Osterhaus. 
* The First Division, under Rear Admiral Bradley A. Fiske, consisted of (flag), , and . 
* The Second Division, under Rear Admiral Nathaniel R. Usher with his flag aboard the , consisted of , , , and . 
* The Third Division, under Rear Admiral Cameron McR. Winslow, comprised (flag), , , , and . 
* The Fourth Division, under Rear Admiral Frank F. Fletcher, consisted of the , , , , and . (See United States occupation of Veracruz).
* Fifth and Sixth Divisions were made up of protected cruisers, , , , and , , , and .

The Cruiser and Transport Force, under Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves served in Atlantic waters during World War I moving the American Expeditionary Forces to Europe. United States Battleship Division Nine joined the Grand Fleet in the UK.

The Atlantic Fleet was reorganized into the Scouting Force in 1923, which was under the United States Fleet along with the Pacific Fleet. In January 1939 the Atlantic Squadron, United States Fleet, was formed, with Vice Admiral Alfred Wilkinson Johnson commanded. The aircraft carrier was transferred to the Atlantic Ocean, to join three battleships.

On 1 November 1940 the Atlantic Squadron was renamed the Patrol Force. The Patrol Force was organized into type commands: Battleships, Patrol Force; Cruisers, Patrol Force; Destroyers, Patrol Force; and, Train, Patrol Force (the logistics arms).

===World War II===
On 1 February 1941, the Atlantic Fleet was resurrected and organized from the Patrol Force. Along with the Pacific Fleet and Asiatic Fleet, the fleet was to be under the command of a full admiral, which jumped the fleet&#x27;s commander Ernest J. King from a two-star to a four-star. King&#x27;s flagship was .

Subsequently, the headquarters was in a rather odd assortment of ships; the , then the old wooden ship , , and then . In 1948, the HQ moved into the former naval hospital at Norfolk, Virginia, and has remained there ever since.

In July 1942, eight months after the United States entered the war, the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy&#x27;s America and West Indies Station based at Admiralty House, Bermuda had his title changed to &quot;Senior British Naval Officer, Western Atlantic.&quot; visited Bermuda in September, 1941.

====Composition of the Atlantic Fleet in December 1941====

On 7 December 1941 the Fleet comprised a number of separate components:

*United States Atlantic Fleet - Commander: Admiral Ernest J. King (Flagship: )
**Battleships, Atlantic Fleet (made up of three Battleship Divisions) - Commander: Rear Admiral David M. LeBreton (Flagship: USS &quot;New York&quot;)

=====Other elements of the Atlantic Fleet=====
During World War II &quot;Transports, Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet&quot; was part of this command (ComTransPhibLant). Smaller units included the Antisubmarine Development Detachment, Atlantic Fleet (ASDEVLANT) located at Quonset Point, Rhode Island. The detachment was responsible for the study and development of antisubmarine gear during World War II. The Commander of the detachment was known as COMASDEVLANT.

Admiral King was appointed Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet, on 20 December 1941. Rear Admiral Royal E. Ingersoll was designated, with the rank of vice admiral, to relieve him as Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet. He took command on 1 January 1942, and was advanced to the rank of admiral on 1 July 1942. To carry out this mission and other tasks CinCLant had in the meantime been reorganized, as of 1 March 1941, into ten task forces (commanded by flag officers) numbered from one to ten and named according to their intended employment. Task Force One was the Ocean Escort Force, TF2—Striking Force, TF3—Scouting Force, TF4—Support Force, TF5—Submarine Force, TF6—Naval Coastal Frontier Forces, TF7—Bermuda Force, TF8—Patrol Wings, TF9—Service Force, and Task Force 10, 1st Marine Division (commanded by a Brigadier General).

Of many significant engagements, Captain Daniel Gallery&#x27;s capture of the German submarine U-505 stands out. The capture was so top secret (because of the enigma code books captured) that the ship&#x27;s flag was kept by the Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet, and not handed over to Navy authorities until after the war.

===Cold War===
On 1 January 1946, Commander Minesweeping Forces, Atlantic Fleet (ComMinLant) was activated to command minesweepers assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. The Commander, Mine Forces, Atlantic was responsible for all Fleet mine warfare operations. Units under his command were divided into Minesweeping Squadrons (MineRon)s.

Between 1947 and 1985, the fleet command was a concurrent appointment with the United States Atlantic Command. The Commander-in-Chief Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT) was traditionally a navy four-star admiral who also then held the positions of Commander-in-Chief United States Atlantic Command (CINCLANT) and NATO&#x27;s Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT). But after a major reorganization of the U.S. armed forces structure following the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, CINCLANFLT was separated from the two other billets. The admiral commanding the Atlantic Fleet was designated as the Deputy Commander in Chief of the Atlantic Command until 1986.

Major crises the Atlantic Fleet was involved in during the Cold War included the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and the 1965 United States occupation of the Dominican Republic.

The general purpose forces of the Army, Navy, and Air Force began to be reorganized in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis on 16 October 1962. The command organization, as finally developed, called for the Commander in Chief, Atlantic (CINCLANT), Admiral Robert Dennison, to provide the unified command. He also retained control of all naval components involved in tactical operations, as the Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet. The responsibility for Army and Air Force components was assigned to the Continental Army Command (CONARC) and the Tactical Air Command under the designation of Army Forces, Atlantic (ARLANT), and Air Forces, Atlantic (AFLANT). The commander of the Army XVIII Airborne Corps was designated Joint Task Force Commander to plan for any joint operations that might become necessary. Over-all direction was exercised by the President and the Secretary of Defense through the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who named the Chief of Naval Operations as their representative for the quarantine.

Major elements of the Strategic Army Corps were designated for use by ARLANT and placed in advanced alert status. Logistic support for the more than 100,000 men involved was directed by a newly established Peninsula Base Command. Preparatory steps were taken to make possible the immediate callup of high priority Army National Guard and Army Reserve units. Tactical Air Command moved hundreds of tactical fighter, reconnaissance, and troop carrier aircraft to the southeast. To make room for all these units, the bombers, tankers, and other aircraft not required for the current operations were ordered to other bases in the United States.

From the late 1960s, nuclear ballistic missile submarines of the fleet began to make thousands of deterrent patrols. The first patrol in the Atlantic Fleet area of operations was made by .

In 1972, Commander, Anti-Submarine Warfare Force, Atlantic Fleet (Task Force 81) was headquartered at Quonset Point Naval Air Station. Under ASWFORLANTFLT was Hunter-Killer Force, Atlantic Fleet (Task Force 83), with Carrier Divisions 14 and 16 (Wasp and Intrepid, respectively), as well as the Quonset ASW Group (TG 81.2) with Fleet Air Wing 3 and surface units. More information on Anti-Submarine Warfare Force, Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s, activities during the Cuban crisis can be found at the National Security Archive&#x27;s document collections.

The Commander, Naval Surface Force Atlantic was formed on 1 July 1975, incorporating a number of previously separate smaller commands – mine warfare vessels/units, service vessels, and frigates, destroyers and cruisers, along with associated destroyer squadrons and cruiser/destroyer groups.

As part of a reorganization announced in July 1995 of the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s surface combatant ships into six core battle groups, nine destroyer squadrons, and a new Western Hemisphere Group, was reassigned to Destroyer Squadron 24. The re-organization was to be phased in over the summer and take effect 31 August 1995, with homeport shifts occurring through 1998. In September 1995 the following ship assignments were intended to apply at the end of the transitional period:
*Western Hemisphere Group (to be homeported at Naval Station Pascagoula and Naval Station Mayport): , , (to move to Pascagoula in FY 98), , &quot;Conolly&quot;, &quot;Scott,&quot; DDG-993, &quot;Moosebrugger&quot;, &quot;Dewert&quot;, &quot;McInerney&quot;, &quot;Boone&quot;, &quot;Doyle&quot;, &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; and &quot;Stark.&quot;
*Cruiser-Destroyer Group 2/Washington Battle Group: CGN-37, CG-60
*Carrier Group 2/Stennis Joint Task Group: , 
*Carrier Group 6/Kennedy/America Joint Task Group: , , and until &quot;Gates&quot; was transferred to the Western Hemisphere Group
*Cruiser-Destroyer Group 8/Eisenhower Joint Task Group: , 
*Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12/Enterprise Joint Task Group: , 

===2000s===
In February 2000, U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command was established in Puerto Rico, and the Western Hemisphere Group became Naval Surface Group 2.

After the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Atlantic Fleet sent aircraft carriers and cruisers towards New York, on the fleet commander&#x27;s own initiative. 
On 1 October 2001, the Chief of Naval Operations designated Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT) as concurrent Commander, Fleet Forces Command (CFFC). In October–November 2002, the title of Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet was amended to Commander, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (COMLANTFLT).

In the CNO Guidance for 2003, Admiral Vernon Clark stipulated that the terms Carrier Battle Group and Amphibious Readiness Group would be replaced by Carrier Strike Groups (CSG) and Expeditionary Strike Groups (ESGs), respectively, by March 2003. Cruiser-Destroyer and Carrier Groups (CARGRU) were also redesignated, as Carrier Strike Groups (CSG), and aligned directly under the numbered fleet commanders. The two sets of staffs were formerly under the administrative authority of their respective air and surface U.S. Navy type commands. This realignment allowed key operational leaders authority and direct access to the personnel required to more effectively accomplish the navy&#x27;s mission.

The numbered fleet commanders are now responsible for the training and certification of the entire Strike Group. The organizational structure to support the carrier strike groups focuses more on placing Strike Group commanders under the authority of the certifying officer, or the numbered fleet commander. Under this new division of responsibility, the air-side type commander gains authority over the air wing, and the surface-side type commander gains authority over the carrier itself and the rest of the ships of the battle group.

On 23 May 2006, the Chief of Naval Operations renamed COMLANTFLT to Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command (COMUSFLTFORCOM or CUSFFC), ordered to carry out the missions currently performed by COMFLTFORCOM (CFFC) and serve as primary advocate for fleet personnel, training, requirements, maintenance, and operational issues, reporting administratively directly to the CNO as an Echelon 2 command. The previous title CFFC was disestablished at the same time. CUSFFC previously served as the Naval component of the US Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) until the disestablishment of USJFCOM in August 2011. CFFC is also assigned as the supporting service component commander to Commander, United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) as well as to Commander, United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM).

&quot;Enterprise&quot; entered an ESRA in 2008, but the refit took longer than expected. Thus on 11 September 2009, it was announced that the carrier strike group deployment schedule would be changed to accommodate the delay in the return of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; from its current overhaul. This resulted in extending both Carrier Strike Group Eleven&#x27;s 2009–2010 deployment and Carrier Strike Group Ten&#x27;s 2010 deployment to eight months. &quot;Enterprise&quot; returned to Naval Station Norfolk on 19 April 2010 after completing its post-overhaul sea trials, signifying the beginning of its pre-deployment training cycle.

On 24 July 2009, Admiral John C. Harvey, Jr. relieved Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert as Commander.

===2010s===
News reports in July 2011 said that in connection with the disestablishment of the United States Second Fleet, Fleet Forces Command would take over Second Fleet&#x27;s duties on 30 September 2011. Effectively this meant Task Force 20 (TF 20), under a deputy commander of the fleet, took over that mission. Task Force 20 was succeeded by Task Force 80 effective 1 October 2012, with TF-80 being under the command of the director of the Maritime Headquarters, Fleet Forces Command.

The Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC), United States Naval Observatory (USNO), Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO), Naval Oceanography Operations Command, Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Professional Development Center, were all realigned under U.S. Navy Information Dominance Forces on 1 October 2014.

Beginning in Fiscal Year 2015, the Optimized Fleet Response Plan will align carrier strike groups to a 36-month training and deployment cycle. All required maintenance, training, evaluations, plus a single eight-month overseas deployment, are scheduled throughout this 36-month cycle in order to reduce costs while increasing overall fleet readiness. This new plan streamlined the inspection and evaluation process while maintaining a surge capacity for emergency deployments. The ultimate objective is to reduce time at sea while increasing in-port time from 49% to 68%. While initially to be used by U.S. Navy carrier strike groups, the Optimized Fleet Response Plan will be adopted for all fleet operations.

Accordingly, the carrier will be the first carrier to deploy under this new O-FRP cycle, replacing the previously-scheduled &quot;Eisenhower&quot; in the deployment lineup. Additionally, the Carrier Strike Group Eight command staff will deploy with the &quot;Truman&quot; while the &quot;Eisenhower&quot; will serve as the new flagship for Carrier Strike Group Ten.

On 2 December 2020, Secretary Kenneth Braithwaite announced that U.S. Fleet Forces Command will be renamed back to United States Atlantic Fleet to focus more on the growing maritime threats coming from the Atlantic. The renaming of the command has been placed on hold, pending further review of the U.S. military footprint, resources, strategy and missions, from the global force posture review.

== Structure 2013 ==

In accordance with the &quot;Navigation Plan 2013–2017&quot; guidance from the Chief of Naval Operations, U.S. Fleet Forces Command was to be based upon the three tenets of war-fighting, forward operations, and readiness. To achieve these objectives, Fleet Forces Command was realigned to a Maritime Operations Center (MOC) and Maritime Headquarters (MHQ) command structure. Additionally, the Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command (COMUSFLTFORCOM) is designated as the Joint Forces Maritime Component Commander North (JFMCC-N) to the U.S. Northern Command. Joint Forces Maritime Component Commander North consists of two Maritime Command Elements (MCE), with Maritime Command Element-East (MCE-E) being Task Force 180 and Maritime Command Element-West (MCE-W) provided from units assigned to the U.S. Pacific Fleet.

Effective 17 May 2013, Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command was officially designated as the naval component commander for the U.S. Northern Command.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNS-33/13U102246&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In this new capacity, the Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command is to contribute to the defense of North America through the coordination, collaboration, and communication with allied, coalition, and joint forces within the U.S. Northern Command&#x27;s area of responsibility. Under this reorganization, the Commander, Navy Installations Command is responsible for area coordination for U.S. Naval Forces Northern Command. Additionally, Commander, Navy Region Mid-Atlantic is responsible for regional coordination for U.S. Naval Forces Northern Command.

===Maritime Operations===
The Maritime Operations directorate leads all phases of the pre-deployment fleet response training plan (FRTP) cycle involving those naval units assigned to the Fleet Forces Command. The directorate transitions all naval units from their operational phase to their tactical phase prior to their overseas deployment.

The Director of Maritime Operations (DMO) is an active-duty two-star rear admiral in the U.S. Navy while the Deputy Director of Maritime Operations is a one-star rear admiral from the United States Naval Reserve. As of 2013, the DMO was Rear Admiral Dan Cloyd. Maritime Operations is organized into the following directorates:

* N2/39 – Intelligence and Information Warfare

<text>The Canon de 75 M (montagne) modèle 1919 Schneider (75 mm mle.1919) was a French mountain gun designed as a replacement of the 65 mm mle 1906. The mle 1919 was manufactured by Schneider et Cie and used during World War II. For transport, the gun could be broken down into seven sections. This weapon was used by Brazil, Paraguay, Yugoslavia and Greece. When captured by the Germans in World War II, the French guns were designated 7.5 cm GebK 237(f); the Yugoslav guns were designated 7.5 cm GebK 283(j). The gun crew was protected by an armoured shield.

==Greek service==
This gun was used by the Greek Army in the Greek–Italian War from October 1940 to April 1941. It was used in divisional service in conjunction with the Schneider 105 mountain gun. Each Greek division had an artillery regiment with 16 mountain 75 mm and 8 mountain 105 mm guns. A total of 192 Mle 1919 75mm were procured by Greece, that equipped 12 (of 15) divisional artillery regiments.

==Survivors==
* In 1923 the Brazilian Army ordered several Schneider Model 1919 75mm Mountain guns. At least 3 of them are now on display at the Fort Copacabana Museum in Rio de Janeiro, and 4 more still in use by the Brazilian Army as ceremonial guns in Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil.
* Several of the original 24 purchased are still used as gate guardians or exposed at Paraguayan museums, as they served during Chaco War.
* At least one example is exhibited in Hellenic War Museum in Athens, Greece.
* A gun from Nexter collection in St. Chamond is now exhibited in the Musée des Blindés in Saumur.
* A World War I monument near Coligny Caserne in Orléans features this artillery piece.
* Mle 1919/28 is exhibited in the Amis du Musée de l&#x27;Artillerie in Draguignan.

<doc id="210755" wikidata="Q211086" url="?curid=210755" title="Hydrogen chloride">
<text>The compound hydrogen chloride has the chemical formula and as such is a hydrogen halide. At room temperature, it is a colorless gas, which forms white fumes of hydrochloric acid upon contact with atmospheric water vapor. Hydrogen chloride gas and hydrochloric acid are important in technology and industry. Hydrochloric acid, the aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride, is also commonly given the formula HCl.

== Reactions ==
Hydrogen chloride is a diatomic molecule, consisting of a hydrogen atom H and a chlorine atom Cl connected by a polar covalent bond. The chlorine atom is much more electronegative than the hydrogen atom, which makes this bond polar. Consequently, the molecule has a large dipole moment with a negative partial charge (δ−) at the chlorine atom and a positive partial charge (δ+) at the hydrogen atom. In part because of its high polarity, HCl is very soluble in water (and in other polar solvents).

Upon contact, and HCl combine to form hydronium cations and chloride anions through a reversible chemical reaction:

The resulting solution is called hydrochloric acid and is a strong acid. The acid dissociation or ionization constant, &quot;K&quot;a, is large, which means HCl dissociates or ionizes practically completely in water. Even in the absence of water, hydrogen chloride can still act as an acid. For example, hydrogen chloride can dissolve in certain other solvents such as methanol:

Hydrogen chloride can protonate molecules or ions and can also serve as an acid-catalyst for chemical reactions where anhydrous (water-free) conditions are desired.

Because of its acidic nature, hydrogen chloride is a corrosive substance, particularly in the presence of moisture.

=== Structure and properties ===
Frozen HCl undergoes a phase transition at . X-ray powder diffraction of the frozen material shows that the material changes from an orthorhombic structure to a cubic one during this transition. In both structures the chlorine atoms are in a face-centered array. However, the hydrogen atoms could not be located. Analysis of spectroscopic and dielectric data, and determination of the structure of DCl (deuterium chloride) indicates that HCl forms zigzag chains in the solid, as does HF (see figure on right).

The infrared spectrum of gaseous hydrogen chloride, shown on the left, consists of a number of sharp absorption lines grouped around 2886 cm−1 (wavelength ~3.47 μm). At room temperature, almost all molecules are in the ground vibrational state &quot;v&quot; = 0. Including anharmonicity the vibrational energy can be written as:
::formula_1

To promote an HCl molecule from the &quot;v&quot; = 0 to the &quot;v&quot; = 1 state, we would expect to see an infrared absorption about &quot;ν&quot;o = &quot;ν&quot;e + 2&quot;x&quot;e&quot;ν&quot;e = 2880 cm−1. However, this absorption corresponding to the Q-branch is not observed due to it being forbidden by symmetry. Instead, two sets of signals (P- and R-branches) are seen owing to a simultaneous change in the rotational state of the molecules. Because of quantum mechanical selection rules, only certain rotational transitions are permitted. The states are characterized by the rotational quantum number &quot;J&quot; = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... selection rules state that Δ&quot;J&quot; is only able to take values of ±1.
::formula_2
The value of the rotational constant &quot;B&quot; is much smaller than the vibrational one &quot;ν&quot;o, such that a much smaller amount of energy is required to rotate the molecule; for a typical molecule, this lies within the microwave region. However, the vibrational energy of HCl molecule places its absorptions within the infrared region, allowing a spectrum showing the rovibrational transitions of this molecule to be easily collected using an infrared spectrometer with a gas cell. The latter can even be made of quartz as the HCl absorption lies in a window of transparency for this material.

Naturally abundant chlorine consists of two isotopes, 35Cl and 37Cl, in a ratio of approximately 3:1. While the spring constants are nearly identical, the disparate reduced masses of H35Cl and H37Cl cause measurable differences in the rotational energy, thus doublets are observed on close inspection of each absorption line, weighted in the same ratio of 3:1.
== Production ==
Most hydrogen chloride produced on an industrial scale is used for hydrochloric acid production.

===Historical routes===
In the 17th century, Johann Rudolf Glauber from Karlstadt am Main, Germany used sodium chloride salt and sulfuric acid for the preparation of sodium sulfate in the Mannheim process, releasing hydrogen chloride. Joseph Priestley of Leeds, England prepared pure hydrogen chloride in 1772, and by 1808 Humphry Davy of Penzance, England had proved that the chemical composition included hydrogen and chlorine.

=== Direct synthesis ===

Hydrogen chloride is produced by combining chlorine and hydrogen:
As the reaction is exothermic, the installation is called an HCl oven or HCl burner. The resulting hydrogen chloride gas is absorbed in deionized water, resulting in chemically pure hydrochloric acid. This reaction can give a very pure product, e.g. for use in the food industry.

The reaction can also be triggered by blue light.

=== Organic synthesis ===
The industrial production of hydrogen chloride is often integrated with the formation of chlorinated and fluorinated organic compounds, e.g., Teflon, Freon, and other CFCs, as well as chloroacetic acid and PVC. Often this production of hydrochloric acid is integrated with captive use of it on-site. In the chemical reactions, hydrogen atoms on the hydrocarbon are replaced by chlorine atoms, whereupon the released hydrogen atom recombines with the spare atom from the chlorine molecule, forming hydrogen chloride. Fluorination is a subsequent chlorine-replacement reaction, producing again hydrogen chloride:
:RCl + HF → RF + HCl
The resulting hydrogen chloride is either reused directly or absorbed in water, resulting in hydrochloric acid of technical or industrial grade.

=== Laboratory methods ===
Small amounts of hydrogen chloride for laboratory use can be generated in an &quot;HCl generator&quot; by dehydrating hydrochloric acid with either sulfuric acid or anhydrous calcium chloride. Alternatively, HCl can be generated by the reaction of sulfuric acid with sodium chloride:

This reaction occurs at room temperature. Provided there is NaCl remaining in the generator and it is heated above 200 °C, the reaction proceeds further:
For such generators to function, the reagents should be dry.

Hydrogen chloride can also be prepared by the hydrolysis of certain reactive chloride compounds such as phosphorus chlorides, thionyl chloride (), and acyl chlorides. For example, cold water can be gradually dripped onto phosphorus pentachloride () to give HCl:

== Applications ==
Most hydrogen chloride is consumed in the production of hydrochloric acid. It is also used in the production of vinyl chloride and many alkyl chlorides. Trichlorosilane, a precursor to ultrapure silicon, is produced by the reaction of hydrogen chloride and silicon at around 300 °C.

== History ==
Around 900, the authors of the Arabic writings attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan (Latin: Geber) and the Persian physician and alchemist Abu Bakr al-Razi (c. 865–925, Latin: Rhazes) were experimenting with sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride), which when it was distilled together with vitriol (hydrated sulfates of various metals) produced hydrogen chloride. It is possible that in one of his experiments, al-Razi stumbled upon a primitive method to produce hydrochloric acid. However, it appears that in most of these early experiments with chloride salts, the gaseous products were discarded, and hydrogen chloride may have been produced many times before it was discovered that it can be put to chemical use.

One of the first such uses was the synthesis of mercury(II) chloride (corrosive sublimate), whose production from the heating of mercury either with alum and ammonium chloride or with vitriol and sodium chloride was first described in the &quot;De aluminibus et salibus&quot; (&quot;On Alums and Salts&quot;), an eleventh- or twelfth century Arabic text falsely attributed to Abu Bakr al-Razi and translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona (1144–1187).

Another important development was the discovery by pseudo-Geber (in the &quot;De inventione veritatis&quot;, &quot;On the Discovery of Truth&quot;, after c. 1300) that by adding ammonium chloride to nitric acid, a strong solvent capable of dissolving gold (i.e., &quot;aqua regia&quot;) could be produced.

After the discovery in the late sixteenth century of the process by which unmixed hydrochloric acid can be prepared, it was recognized that this new acid (then known as &quot;spirit of salt&quot; or &quot;acidum salis&quot;) released vaporous hydrogen chloride, which was called &quot;marine acid air&quot;. In the 17th century, Johann Rudolf Glauber used salt (sodium chloride) and sulfuric acid for the preparation of sodium sulfate, releasing hydrogen chloride gas (see production, above). In 1772, Carl Wilhelm Scheele also reported this reaction and is sometimes credited with its discovery. Joseph Priestley prepared hydrogen chloride in 1772, and in 1810 Humphry Davy established that it is composed of hydrogen and chlorine.

During the Industrial Revolution, demand for alkaline substances such as soda ash increased, and Nicolas Leblanc developed a new industrial-scale process for producing the soda ash. In the Leblanc process, salt was converted to soda ash, using sulfuric acid, limestone, and coal, giving hydrogen chloride as by-product. Initially, this gas was vented to air, but the Alkali Act of 1863 prohibited such release, so then soda ash producers absorbed the HCl waste gas in water, producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale. Later, the Hargreaves process was developed, which is similar to the Leblanc process except sulfur dioxide, water, and air are used instead of sulfuric acid in a reaction which is exothermic overall. In the early 20th century the Leblanc process was effectively replaced by the Solvay process, which did not produce HCl. However, hydrogen chloride production continued as a step in hydrochloric acid production.

Historical uses of hydrogen chloride in the 20th century include hydrochlorinations of alkynes in producing the chlorinated monomers chloroprene and vinyl chloride, which are subsequently polymerized to make polychloroprene (Neoprene) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), respectively. In the production of vinyl chloride, acetylene () is hydrochlorinated by adding the HCl across the triple bond of the molecule, turning the triple into a double bond, yielding vinyl chloride.

The &quot;acetylene process&quot;, used until the 1960s for making chloroprene, starts out by joining two acetylene molecules, and then adds HCl to the joined intermediate across the triple bond to convert it to chloroprene as shown here:

This &quot;acetylene process&quot; has been replaced by a process which adds  to the double bond of ethylene instead, and subsequent elimination produces HCl instead, as well as chloroprene.

== Safety ==
Hydrogen chloride forms corrosive hydrochloric acid on contact with water found in body tissue. Inhalation of the fumes can cause coughing, choking, inflammation of the nose, throat, and upper respiratory tract, and in severe cases, pulmonary edema, circulatory system failure, and death. Skin contact can cause redness, pain, and severe chemical burns. Hydrogen chloride may cause severe burns to the eye and permanent eye damage.

The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have established occupational exposure limits for hydrogen chloride at a ceiling of 5 ppm (7 mg/m3), and compiled extensive information on hydrogen chloride workplace safety concerns.

<text>A tachanka (Russian and ) was a horse-drawn cart (such as charabanc) or an open wagon with a heavy machine gun mounted on the rear side. A tachanka could be pulled by two to four horses and required a crew of two or three (one driver and a machine gun crew).

A number of sources attribute its invention to Nestor Makhno.

== Etymology ==
At least two plausible hypotheses account for the origin of the word &quot;tachanka&quot;. Vasmer&#x27;s etymological dictionary suggests that the word derives from Ukrainian &quot;netychanka&quot; (&quot;нетичанка&quot;), Polish &quot;najtyczanka&quot;, a type of a carriage named after the town of Neutitschein, present-day Nový Jičín in the Czech Republic. Another account references a Ukrainian diminutive or endearing form of the word &quot;tachka&quot; (, meaning &quot;wheelbarrow&#x27;&quot;). Still another etymology postulates a contracted form of the word &quot;tavrichanka&quot; - used for rugged carriages known in Southern Ukraine and Crimea, and derived from the name &quot;Taurida&quot; for this area. However the latter derivation remains dubious: the &quot;tavrichanka&quot;, a large, rugged agricultural carriage, has a completely different design.

== Adoption ==

A regular civilian horse cart could be easily converted to military use and back. This made the tachanka very popular during the Great War on the Eastern Front, where it was used by the Russian cavalry. The use of tachankas reached its peak during the Russian Civil War (1917–1920s), particularly in the peasant regions of Southern Russia and Ukraine, on fronts where fluid mobile warfare gained much significance. With up to 4 horses abreast pulling a tachanka, it could easily keep up with cavalry units and support them with mobile firepower.

Tachanka tactics were centered around taking advantage of its speed to surprise the enemy. Tachankas, before the introduction of the tank or automobile to the battlefield, were the only way to provide high-speed mobility for the heavy, bulky machine guns of World War I. The speed of the horse-drawn cart would be used to move the machine gun platform to a favorable firing position, and then the enemy would be fired upon before they had a chance to react. Since the machine gun pointed towards the rear of the cart, the tachankas also provided effective suppressive fire onto pursuing enemy cavalry after raids and during retreats. Ukrainian anarchist leader Nestor Makhno pioneered the use of the tachanka en masse during the Russian Civil War. Makhno&#x27;s forces relied so heavily upon the use of the tachanka that one Makhnovite referred to himself and his fellow troops as &quot;a republic on tachanki&quot;. The Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine used tachankas mainly against enemy cavalry. Makhnovists also used tachankas to transport infantry, thus improving mobility of the army (about 100 km each day). Tachankas soon became used by the Red Army, with the famous example of Vasily Chapayev.

Later, it was adopted by a number of armies, notably the Polish Army which used it during the Polish-Soviet War. Initially mostly improvised, with time the Polish Army also adopted two models of factory-made &quot;taczanka&quot;s, as they were called in Poland. They were used during the Invasion of Poland of 1939 to provide cavalry squadron support. They were attached to every cavalry HMG squadron and HMG company of infantry.

== Armament ==
Despite a certain degree of standardisation, the tachanka&#x27;s armament was, in most cases, improvised. In Russia, the PM M1910 heavy machine gun was often used. The Polish cavalry of the Polish-Soviet War often used all kinds of machine guns available, including the Maxim, Schwarzlose MG M.07/12, Hotchkiss machine gun and Browning machine gun. The late models of standardised tachankas of the Polish Army were all equipped with Ckm wz.30, a Polish modification of the M1917 Browning machine gun which was also suitable for anti-air fire.

== Cultural references ==
One of the songs glorifying the Red Army during the Russian Civil War was called &quot;Tachanka&quot;. The concluding lyrics, roughly translated, run:

:&quot;And to this day, the foe has nightmares&quot;
:&quot;Of the thick rain of lead,&quot;
:&quot;The battle-chariot&quot;
:&quot;And the young machine gunner.&quot;

Tachankas can be seen in the classic Soviet films such as &quot;Chapayev&quot; and &quot;The Burning Miles&quot;. A modern variant of tachanka can be seen in a cult Russian film &quot;Brother 2&quot;. In modern Russian slang the word &quot;tachanka&quot; is used for any heavily armed non-standard tactical vehicles.

On 7 November 1987, some tachankas marched within Soviet Army historical segments during the October Revolution Day Parade in Moscow, which commemorated the 70th anniversary of the October Revolution.

In the video game &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six Siege&quot;, there is a playable Russian operator by the name of Alexsandr &quot;Tachanka&quot; Senaviev, who operates a DP-27 light machinegun (which was originally on a tripod and had a bulletproof glass shield), and an incendiary grenade launcher.

In North Korea, the Korean People&#x27;s Army showed Tachankas during the 2023 parades held in Pyongyang, one is commemorated the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People&#x27;s Army on 8 February, another is commemorated the 70th anniversary of the end of the Korean War on 27 July.

<text>Burtnieki () is a village (population 488) in Burtnieki Parish, Valmiera Municipality, in the Vidzeme region of Latvia, near Lake Burtnieks. Administrative centre of Burtnieki Parish. Burtnieki was first mentioned in the Livonian Chronicle of Henry in 1208 and has several historic sites: Burtnieki castle-ruins, Burtnieki manor and Burtnieki church.

==Burtnieki castle and manor==

Burtnieki was a site of a Livonian Order castle, built in 1284. The house was burned down in the 16th century, during the Livonian War. A part of stone wall on the Southern side remains.

In the 14th century, a manor estate was built near the castle ruins, on the bank of Lake Burtnieks. In 1860s, baron J.F. von Schroder created a park near the estate (now known as the Burtnieki park) with about 70 species of trees and bushes.

==Lutheran church of Burtnieki==

The Lutheran church of Burtnieki is located on the Eastern bank of the lake. The first church was built there in 1234. It was a Catholic church, built from wood. It burned down and was replaced by a stone wall church between 1283-1287. It was destroyed in 1654, during the Polish-Russian War.

The current church was built in 1688. Near the church is located a minister estate building complex, renovated in 1992. The estate building has been defined as a protected architectural monument.

==Horse farm of Burtnieki==

Burtnieki has a horse-farm, first established in 1941. Several notable horses have been bred here. Burtnieki-bred horse Rusty, with the rider Ulla Salzgeber of Germany, won bronze medal in individual dressage and gold medal in team dressage in 2000 Summer Olympics. After Olympics, Rusty and Ulla Salzgeber have won two European Championships (in 2001 and 2003) and World Cup.

The former &quot;Briedes&quot; pub (built in 1840) hosts a horse breeding and agriculture museum. It was one of the sites of 2000 European Heritage Days.

==Burtnieki school==

Burtnieki school was established in 1685 and was one of the first 15 rural schools in Latvia. It is currently known as Burtnieki Auseklis Secondary School.

<text>Cyane was a Royal Navy sailing sixth-rate ship of 22 guns, built in 1806 at Topsham, near Exeter, England. She was ordered in January 1805 as HMS &quot;Columbine&quot; and was renamed &quot;Cyane&quot; on 6 December of that year.

Under Captain Thomas Staines she captured the Spanish privateer &quot;Medusa&quot; in 1808 which was the last ship captured by the British before Spain turned against Napoleon. In May 1809 she was badly damaged during a battle with French gunboats and the French frigate &quot;Ceres&quot;.

She was captured with on 20 February 1815 by after a 40-minute night engagement off Madeira. With &quot;Constitution″&quot;s second lieutenant Hoffman as prize master, she successfully escaped recapture by a pursuing British squadron on 12 March and arrived in America on 10 April. She was adjudicated by a prize court and purchased by the Navy and renamed USS &quot;Cyane&quot;.

&quot;Cyane&quot; cruised off the west coast of Africa from 1819–1820 and in the West Indies from 1820–1821 protecting the Liberian colony and suppressing piracy and the slave trade. In this regard she was a predecessor to the Africa Squadron. She cruised in the Mediterranean 1824–1825, and on the Brazil Station 1826–1827. Laid up at Philadelphia Navy Yard, she sank in 1835 and was raised and broken up the following year.

The April/May 1983 issue of &quot;American Heritage&quot; magazine carried an article &quot;What it was like to be Shot up by Old Ironsides&quot; concerning the discovery of three pages of HMS &quot;Cyane&quot;″s logbook from 13 to 20 February 1815, with a transcription of 20 February 1815 battle.
