<doc id="208918" wikidata="Q1683795" url="?curid=208918" title="Quatuor pour la fin du temps">
<text>Quatuor pour la fin du Temps (), originally Quatuor de la fin du Temps (&quot;Quartet of the End of Time&quot;), also known by its English title Quartet for the End of Time, is an eight-movement piece of chamber music by the French composer Olivier Messiaen. It was premiered in 1941. The work is scored for clarinet (in B-flat), violin, cello, and piano; a typical performance of the complete work lasts about 50 minutes. Messiaen wrote the piece while a prisoner of war in German captivity and it was first performed by his fellow prisoners. It is generally considered one of his most important works.

==Composition and first performance==
Messiaen was 31 years old when France entered World War II. He was captured by the German army in June 1940 and imprisoned in Stalag VIII-A, a prisoner-of-war camp in Görlitz, Germany (now Zgorzelec, Poland). While in transit to the camp, Messiaen showed the clarinetist Henri Akoka, also a prisoner, the sketches for what would become &quot;Abîme des oiseaux&quot;. Two other professional musicians, violinist and cellist Étienne Pasquier, were among his fellow prisoners, and after he managed to obtain some paper and a small pencil from a sympathetic guard (, 1902–1989), Messiaen wrote a short trio for them; this piece later became the quartet&#x27;s Intermède. Later, he decided to write for the same trio with himself at the piano, developing it into its current state. The combination of instruments was unusual at the time, but not without precedent: Walter Rabl had composed for it in 1896, as had Paul Hindemith in 1938.

The quartet was premiered at the camp on 15 January 1941 in front of about 400 prisoners and guards. Messiaen claimed that 5,000 people attended the performance and that the musicians had decrepit instruments, but those claims are now considered &quot;somewhat exaggerated&quot;. The cello was bought with donations from camp members. Messiaen later recalled, &quot;Never was I listened to with such rapt attention and comprehension.&quot;

Several months later, Messiaen was released (with the help of Brüll) thanks to an entreaty by his former organ teacher and professor at the Paris Conservatoire, Marcel Dupré, as Messiaen scholar Nigel Simeone writes:

Messiaen and Etienne Pasquier (cellist at the initial premiere) later recorded the quartet on LP for Club Français du Disc (1956), together with Jean Pasquier (violin) and André Vacellier (clarinet).

==Inspiration==
Messiaen wrote in the Preface to the score that the work was inspired by text from the Book of Revelation (Rev 10:1–2, 5–7, King James Version):
And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire ... and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth ... And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever ... that there should be time no longer: But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished ...

==Structure==
The work is in eight movements:

Below, quotations are translated from Messiaen&#x27;s Preface to the score.

===I. &quot;Liturgie de cristal&quot;===
In his preface to the score, Messiaen describes the opening of the quartet:

Written for the full quartet, the opening movement begins with the solo clarinet imitating a blackbird&#x27;s song and the violin imitating a nightingale&#x27;s song. The underlying pulse is provided by the cello and piano: the cello cycles through the same five-note melody (using the pitches C, E, D, F-sharp, and B-flat) and a repeating pattern of 15 durations. The piano part consists of a 17-note rhythmic pattern permuted strictly through 29 chords, as if to give the listener a glimpse of something eternal.

===II. &quot;Vocalise, pour l&#x27;Ange qui annonce la fin du temps&quot;===
Also for the full quartet, Messiaen writes of this movement:

===III. &quot;Abîme des oiseaux&quot;===
Messiaen writes:

A solo for the clarinet, this movement is a test for even the most accomplished clarinetist, with an extremely slow tempo marking . It was originally written in Verdun.

===IV. &quot;Intermède&quot;===
A trio for violin, cello, and clarinet, Messiaen writes of this movement:

===V. &quot;Louange à l&#x27;Éternité de Jésus&quot;===
Messiaen writes:

A duet for cello and piano, the music is arranged from an earlier composition, &quot;IV. &quot;L&#x27;Eau&quot;&quot; from &quot;Fête des belles eaux&quot; for 6 Ondes Martenots, performed at the Paris International Exposition of 1937. The tempo marking is &quot;infiniment lent, extatique&quot; (&quot;infinitely slow, ecstatic&quot;).

===VI. &quot;Danse de la fureur, pour les sept trompettes&quot;===

Messiaen writes of this movement, which is for full quartet:

Toward the end of the movement the theme returns, &quot;fortissimo&quot;, in augmentation and with wide changes of register. It is in unison throughout.

===VII. &quot;Fouillis d&#x27;arcs-en-ciel, pour l&#x27;Ange qui annonce la fin du temps&quot;===
Messiaen writes of this quartet movement:

===VIII. &quot;Louange à l&#x27;Immortalité de Jésus&quot;===
Messiaen writes:

A duet for violin and piano, the music is an arrangement of the second part of his earlier organ piece &quot;Diptyque&quot; (1930), transposed up a major third from C to E.

==Derivative works==
The piece is the inspiration for &quot;Quartet for the End of Time&quot;, a 2014 novel by Johanna Skibsrud that borrows its title and structure from the piece.

<text>Monarch Airlines, simply known as Monarch, was a British charter and scheduled airline founded by Bill Hodgson and Don Peacock and financed by the Swiss Sergio Mantegazza family. The company later became a low-cost airline in 2004 before abandoning charter flying completely. The airline&#x27;s headquarters were based at London–Luton, and it had operating bases at Birmingham, Leeds/Bradford, London–Gatwick and Manchester.

When Monarch entered administration in 2017, it was the biggest airline collapse in UK history up to that point, leaving nearly 100,000 passengers and holidaymakers stranded. However, on 23 September 2019, Thomas Cook also collapsed, leaving 150,000 people stranded, and went on to become the largest UK airline ever to collapse. The airline held a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Type A Operating Licence. This licence allowed Monarch to carry passengers, cargo, and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.

==History==

===1960s===
On 5 June 1967, Monarch Airlines was established by a pair of British businesspeople, Bill Hodgson and Don Peacock, both of whom had previously been directors at the airline British Eagle. Unlike typical airlines at the time, Monarch was founded with the express intent of conveying British holidaymakers to tourism hotspots and desirable getaway destinations throughout Europe. Particularly at a time when air travel was traditionally feasible only to the rich, Monarch took another unusual step. The airline&#x27;s ambition was to promote the service towards the demands and needs of the average family, rather than it being marketed solely for wealthier clients.

The business was operated as a subsidiary of Globus Getaway Holdings and received financial backing from the Swiss Sergio Mantegazza family. At the time of Monarch&#x27;s inception, the Mantegazza family were the owners of UK-based tour operator Cosmos Tours. Sister company Engineering Limited (which would later become Monarch Aircraft Engineering Limited) performed maintenance on the company&#x27;s aircraft. On 5 April 1968, Monarch commenced commercial airline operations. Monarch conducted a charter flight from Luton Airport, London to Madrid, Spain, using a Bristol 175 Britannia 300 turboprop formerly operated by British airline company Caledonian Airways.

The airline&#x27;s initial fleet comprised a pair of Bristol Britannias (both ex-Caledonian Airways) serviced in a single hangar at Luton. During 1969, the firm&#x27;s second year of operation, Monarch was able to acquire additional Britannias from the administrators of troubled airline British Eagle. Shortly after, the airliner reached a milestone in the form of 250,000 passengers carried within a 12-month period, which at that point was operating an expanded fleet of six Britannias.

===1970s===
During 1971, Monarch entered the jet age, having completed arrangements for the acquisition of an initial batch of three Boeing 720B jetliners to its fleet. The airline&#x27;s first commercial jet service took to the air on 13 December 1971. Co-founder Bob Hodgson later praised the low noise levels of the Boeing 720, favourably referring to them as being &quot;whispering giants&quot;. The introduction of the company&#x27;s first jet aircraft type also coincided with the adoption of a revised livery.

By the 1970s, there was a strong demand amongst the wider British population for the package holiday format, to which Monarch was able to capitalise upon greatly. During 1972, the airline recorded having carried 500,000 passengers with the space of a single year for the first time. However, during the 1970s energy crisis, in which the price of oil spiked dramatically, many airlines experienced periods of considerable financial hardship. One of Monarch&#x27;s rivals in the package holiday sector, Court Line, was forced into receivership. While the company took on several former staff from Court Line, Monarch itself was not immune to these difficulties either.

By 1976, Monarch had transitioned to an all-jet fleet, following the sale of the airline&#x27;s last Britannia to Greek cargo charter airline Afrek on 21 May of that year. Two years earlier, the airline had retired its last passenger-configured Britannia, which operated the type&#x27;s final commercial passenger flight in Europe on 9 October 1974. The changeover to an all-jet fleet was brought about as a result of (first) the acquisition of a further two second-hand Boeing 720Bs, as well as (second) the addition of a pair of BAC One-Eleven 500s, sourced from (first) British Caledonian and (second) the administrators of the failed Court Line respectively.

===1980s===

At the end of 1980, Monarch Airlines took delivery of its first new jet aircraft, a pair of Boeing 737-200 Advanced. Monarch acquired the aircraft on an operating lease from Bavaria Leasing (then a unit of Hapag Lloyd Airlines). One of the newly delivered 737s operated from Tegel Airport in then West Berlin (in the days before the German reunification) at the beginning of the 1981 summer season. The Berlin-based aircraft operated short to medium-haul charter flights to the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands under contract to Flug-Union Berlin, at the time one of West Berlin&#x27;s leading package tour operators. Monarch had taken over Flug-Union Berlin&#x27;s charter programme from Laker Airways. The addition of the 737s expanded Monarch&#x27;s fleet to 11 jet aircraft, comprising one Boeing 707-320C, five Boeing 720Bs, three BAC One-Eleven 500s and two Boeing 737-200 Advs.

During 1981, new stations opened at Gatwick, Glasgow, Manchester and Berlin Tegel making it the first time Monarch Airlines carried a million passengers in a single year. 1981 was also the year Monarch became the first charter airline to order the Boeing 757-200, a high-capacity medium-haul single-aisle plane powered by Rolls-Royce RB211-535C engines. Monarch&#x27;s 757 order represented a significant change for a small airline. The first delivered 757 entered service in the spring of 1983, coinciding with the introduction of an updated livery, the third in the airline&#x27;s history. During the mid-1980s, sister company Monarch Aircraft Engineering Limited opened several new facilities at Luton to expand the firm&#x27;s maintenance capabilities. Amongst other things, it enabled the 757 fleet to be maintained in-house.

During spring 1985, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) awarded Monarch licences to commence scheduled services to Málaga, Menorca and Tenerife. These licences allowed the airline to launch its first-ever scheduled service from Luton to Menorca on 5 July 1986, under the brand name &quot;Monarch crown service&quot;. This event signified the first time in which Monarch was in direct competition with rival airlines, rather than just as a component of a tour operator.

During 1986, Monarch acquired their first Boeing 737-300 airliner. From November 1988, four of Monarch&#x27;s 737-300s were leased out to Euroberlin France, a Berlin Tegel-based Franco-German joint venture airline that was 51% owned by Air France and 49% by Lufthansa. Apart from the aircraft itself, Monarch Airlines also provided the flight deck crew and maintenance support (through sister company Monarch Aircraft Engineering) for this airline. By 1990, seven 737-300s are assigned to the Euroberlin wet lease.

On 1 May 1988, Monarch operated the first ETOPS Transatlantic operation under CAA regulations. The Boeing 757-200ER G-MONJ operated Luton to Orlando via Gander with 235 passengers. This operation became the first British-operated twin-jet ever to cross the North Atlantic with passengers. Since then, this feat has become commonplace for North Atlantic crossings. That same year, Monarch Airlines reached another milestone; the firm carried more than two million passengers within a year.

===1990s===
In 1990, Monarch introduced the Airbus A300-600R, its first wide-body aircraft type. Monarch also opened a new purpose-built headquarters that housed the airline&#x27;s Boeing 757 flight simulator at its Luton base. During the early 1990s, the company operated several Boeing 767-300ER wide-body aircraft on behalf of Alitalia Team, a subsidiary of Italy&#x27;s flag carrier, under a wet-lease arrangement similar to a previous deal Monarch formed with Euroberlin France. In 1993, Monarch Airlines introduced the Airbus A320 aircraft followed by the larger Airbus A321 in 1997. The Airbus A320 replaced the airline&#x27;s fleet of Boeing 737-300s.

After 1995, Monarch came under increasing pressure from newly formed budget airlines. It would eventually stop all charter flying ten years later. This announcement was in response to customers abandoning Monarch&#x27;s offering of package tours in favour of independent tours on seat-only low-cost airlines.

During May 1997, Monarch Airlines launched a new scheduled route between Gibraltar and Luton, with additional flights to Gibraltar by the company established from Birmingham, Gatwick and Manchester. Monarch continued to operate flights on the Gibraltar-Luton route until the firm&#x27;s collapse. During the late 1990s, a new in-flight service referred to as Monarch Plus, included pre-booked seats, free headsets and improved dining options, such as duck breast instead of turkey stroganoff, for an additional £30 per person.

During 1998, Monarch Airlines leased a pair of McDonnell Douglas MD-11 wide-body aircraft from American airline World Airways for its long-haul operations. This lease was interim for the delivery of a pair of new Airbus A330-200 wide-body aircraft. Following the arrival of the A330 in 1999, Monarch opted to return the leased MD-11s to World Airways. The adoption of the A330 wide-bodies permitted Monarch to serve long-haul charter destinations with a two class seating configuration, which was another first for the airline.

===2000s===
During 2002, Monarch retired the sole McDonnell Douglas DC-10 from service and donated it to the Manchester Airport Aviation Viewing Park. That same year, Monarch also unveiled a brand-new livery – the airline&#x27;s fourth. Also, the company rebranded its Monarch Crown Service scheduled division as &quot;Monarch Scheduled&quot;. Monarch Scheduled continued to offer a full-service product, including free catering, bar service, hot towels, newspapers and in-flight entertainment (IFE).

During 2003, Monarch Scheduled announced that it would open a new base at Gatwick Airport. On 1 May 2003, this base opened, initially offering services to Alicante, Faro and Málaga. On 15 December 2004, Monarch Scheduled announced that it would open a new base at Birmingham Airport. The station opened in April 2005 with new routes to Málaga and Tenerife.

In 2004, following the success of the low-fares, no-frills airlines such as easyJet, Monarch decided to adopt a modified low-cost model, featuring additional charges for food and drink. In 2005 (until 2010), Monarch leased a Boeing 767-300ER from MyTravel Airways (which then became Thomas Cook Airlines) to expand its long-haul fleet.

During November 2005, Monarch opened a base in Málaga. The airline based one Airbus A320 aircraft there. Monarch launched three scheduled services from Málaga to Aberdeen, Blackpool and Newquay. The Málaga-Newquay route was discontinued on 30 April 2006. About a year later, Monarch retired the Málaga-Blackpool service due to low demand. On 27 October 2007, the airliner withdrew the Málaga-Aberdeen route as well, resulting in the closure of Monarch&#x27;s Málaga base.


To operate scheduled services from Manchester, an Airbus A321 was acquired. Monarch became the airport&#x27;s second-largest passenger airline in 2005 with 1.72m passengers using its services from/to the airport. Monarch&#x27;s total passenger numbers increased from 4.55m in 2002 to 6.5m in 2008.

In August 2006, Monarch ordered six Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner widebodied jets, primarily for use on long-haul routes. Delivery was planned to start in 2010; however, delays to the 787 project pushed back delivery to 2013, and in September 2011, the airline announced the cancellation of the order, citing its strategic decision to concentrate on its short-/medium-haul operations.

On 27 April 2007, Monarch Airlines started flights to Ibiza partnered with club brand HedKandi, naming the partnership &quot;FlyKandi&quot;. One of Monarch&#x27;s Boeing 757s (G-MOND) received a special FlyKandi livery with billboard FlyKandi titles and a special tail motif. The HedKandi partnership lasted for the 2007 summer season, with flights to Ibiza sold from four major UK airports. It was then renewed for the 2008 summer season, offering the same services. This time FlyKandi livery was applied to G-MONJ. HedKandi CDs and radio stations were available for purchase and to listen to onboard Monarch aircraft.

In October 2007, Monarch became the first airline in Europe to accept PayPal as a flight payment option on its website.

During 2008, Monarch changed the name of its website from &quot;flymonarch.com&quot; to &quot;monarch.co.uk&quot;. It also changed its advertising slogan to &quot;The Low Fare Airline That Cares&quot;.

During 2008, Monarch provided the aircraft, an Airbus A321, to launch the ITV2 television programme &quot;CelebAir&quot;. Celebrities were trained and took on duties performed by airline staff, such as cabin crew. The destinations to which &quot;CelebAir&quot; flew were mainly Monarch&#x27;s scheduled destinations, including Málaga, Alicante, Tenerife, Faro, Ibiza, Mahón and Larnaca. These flights carried fare-paying passengers. The programme first aired on 2 September 2008. The programme has now finished with Lisa Maffia winning the series, Amy Lamé finishing second and Chico Slimani finishing third.

===2010 to 2014===
After many years of operating profitably, Monarch Group, the parent company of Monarch Airlines and Cosmos Holidays, reported a large pre-tax loss of £32.3m in the financial year ending in 2009. This loss necessitated a £45m cash injection from the Mantegazzas who had co-owned the group since its inception. Monarch Airlines also changed its focus from being primarily a charter airline to becoming a predominantly &quot;scheduled leisure airline.&quot; Monarch targeted 80% of its business to being &quot;scheduled&quot; (compared with only 20% in 2005). The new strategy resulted in the introduction of additional scheduled services to new destinations in Egypt, Turkey, Greece, Spain and Portugal, including the launch on 23 May 2011 of a three-times-weekly scheduled service to the Greek island of Corfu — the airline&#x27;s first scheduled Greek destination – from London Luton.

Monarch abolished all debit card charges in favour of a single £10 flat rate applied to credit card transactions. This change was a bid to increase the airliner&#x27;s attractiveness as a viable alternative to EasyJet and Ryanair, its main low-cost competitors. To highlight these differences as additional selling points, Monarch introduced the advertising slogan &quot;Fly Your Way Every Day&quot;. Monarch also introduced a rebrand incorporating the airline&#x27;s old capital &quot;M&quot; and crown, as well as the airline&#x27;s fifth livery.

Although Monarch made a £1.4m profit in 2010, it reported a £45m loss in the financial year ending 31 October 2011. This loss was a result of high jet fuel prices against the backdrop of a stagnant economy, as well as political turmoil in the Middle East. Higher fuel prices increased the airline&#x27;s annual fuel bill by £50m.

On 3 November 2011, Monarch received a £75m rescue package for the airline. Monarch also announced a launch of 14 additional routes serving new destinations in Italy, Croatia and Greece from their bases. The new flights commenced at the start of the 2012 summer season. Monarch also received two Airbus A320 aircraft to support the increased level of activity. The addition of these aircraft was the first stage of a medium-term plan to increase the fleet size to 40 aircraft in support of the airline&#x27;s goal to carry 10 million passengers annually. Growing the fleet to increase passenger numbers was supposed to allow the airline to spread its fixed costs over a higher output level, resulting in greater economies of scale.

On 3 May 2012, Monarch announced that they were to open a new base at East Midlands Airport in Autumn 2012. The new station will replace some routes previously flown by Bmibaby, who ceased operations completely on 9 September 2012. On 8 May 2012, the airline announced operations from Leeds/Bradford with two new winter destinations, Munich and Grenoble. They also announced plans for a large expansion in summer 2013.
 On 10 July 2012, Monarch announced a launch of a new base at Leeds/Bradford with 12 new destinations. The base opened on 22 March 2013. As of mid-2012, Globus Travel&#x27;s shareholders included Amerald Investments (88%), Atlantic Financial Services (7%) and Abaco Holdings (4%). On 13 December 2012, Monarch announced that they had come on board as a new sponsor for Leeds United AFC. This sponsorship promotes Monarch&#x27;s base and routes at Leeds Bradford Airport.


On 1 July 2013, Monarch announced an order for a further two Airbus A321s. The aircraft was due to be delivered in April and May 2015, but it changed to just a single A320 in April 2015. On 12 December 2013, Monarch announced that Monarch Airlines had returned to profit in the year ending October 2013 and that passenger numbers were up 9.5% to 7 million and in line to carry more than 10 million by 2016. In the same announcement, Monarch confirmed that it planned to order 60 new aircraft in an order worth $6 Billion for delivery up to 2024 and would announce the successful tender in Q1 of 2014 from either Airbus/Boeing and Bombardier.

In July 2014 the airline announced that it had selected Boeing, with the 737MAX, as the preferred bidder for 30 new aircraft. Monarch confirmed the order in October 2014, with deliveries due to take place from Q2 of 2018.

===2014 to 2017: troubles and end of operations===
In August 2014, Monarch announced it was undergoing a strategic review of the company which would involve cost reduction initiatives. As part of the plan, Monarch announced the closure of their East Midlands base on 14 August 2014. The company also embarked on a heavy redundancy exercise and reduction of payroll mainly aimed at onboard cabin management in preparation for the company sale in October 2014.

On 24 October 2014, Monarch Holdings was acquired from the Globus Travel Group by the private investment company and turnaround specialist Greybull Capital. This purchase, for a nominal sum, was just hours before Monarch&#x27;s licence with the Civil Aviation Authority expired. Greybull was to own 90% of the airline, with the remaining 10% held by the group&#x27;s pension fund and provide access to £125m of new capital. As part of the deal, Monarch announced that it would downsize its fleet from 42 to 34 aircraft, as well as renegotiate leases on ten aircraft. Monarch will also cease long-haul and charter operations from April 2015, converting to a low-cost model focusing on short-haul leisure routes. However, the new finance was said to secure the order for 30 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft signed up to at the 2014 Farnborough Air Show.

Following the downsize in operations, Monarch Airlines carried 5.7 million passengers during 2015, a 19% reduction compared with 2014. However, demand for flights on Monarch&#x27;s major holiday routes to Egypt and Turkey continued to fall because of passenger fears raised by the Syrian civil war, the Egyptian political crisis and the 2016 Turkish coup d&#x27;état attempt.

On 25 September 2016, online rumours surfaced about Monarch Airlines&#x27; imminent bankruptcy, which the airline strongly denied. The Civil Aviation Authority had commenced commandeering spare planes from other airlines for potential repatriation of British citizens at short notice. However, in the following days, Monarch obtained additional funds from shareholders, and on 30 September 2016, its Civil Aviation Authority ATOL licence was temporarily extended until 12 October. On 12 October 2016, Monarch Airlines successfully retained its ATOL licence after it received an additional £165m in investment funding. At the time, the cash injection was believed to have come from Greybull Capital. However, one year later, it was revealed that Boeing had provided the majority of the sum to save the struggling airline.

In September 2017, reports emerged of Monarch facing difficulties over its license, as had happened in the previous year. On Saturday 30 September 2017, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) extended Monarch&#x27;s licence for 24 hours due to financial issues. Once again the Civil Aviation Authority had commenced commandeering spare planes from other airlines which included ten planes from Qatar Airways. Furthermore, although Monarch had received an extension to its license, it tripled fares. These price increases showed a deliberate attempt to effectively price itself out of the market and reduce exposure to any claims.

During the late evening on 1 October 2017, the airline cancelled late-night flights to Ibiza at the boarding stage as the deadline for its licence loomed. On the morning of 2 October at 03:19 BST, the airline&#x27;s final flight, ZB3785 from Tel Aviv to Manchester, landed. Shortly afterwards at approximately 04:00 BST, the CAA confirmed that Monarch Airlines (along with its subsidiaries) ceased operations with immediate effect and had entered administration. This announcement left 110,000 passengers stranded overseas, and 300,000 future bookings cancelled.

A total of 38 aircraft from 15 European, Middle Eastern, and Canadian operators, including Qatar Airways (10 aircraft), Titan Airways (five aircraft), Air Transat (four aircraft), Freebird Airlines and Wamos Air (three aircraft each), and smaller numbers from other airlines and charter operators, were chartered to repatriate British citizens from abroad. The aircraft used for the operation ranged in size from a Boeing 737-300 to a Boeing 747-400. In total, the operation cost £60 million, funded by the Air Travel Trust Fund which in turn is funded by an airline and passenger levy. The operation was the UK&#x27;s biggest ever post-war repatriation at the time. Two years later, Thomas Cook made an even bigger collapse.

Monarch was also the largest airline ever to have ceased trading in the UK until the collapse of Thomas Cook in 2019. The causal factors of Monarch&#x27;s demise were various. First, vicious competition and excess capacity on routes to southern Europe from other low-cost rivals must have played a part in this scenario. Second, travel fears resulting from terrorism in North Africa and also around Europe such as the military coup in Turkey and the 2016 Nice truck attack became the suspect reason. Third, Brexit fears caused the depreciation of the pound sterling, which increased operating costs such as fuel costs, aircraft leasing costs, and airport landing fees.

In April 2021, Monarch Airlines was dissolved after moving out of administration.

== Cabin and services ==
As Monarch positioned itself as a low-cost carrier, the airline offered several services for an optional extra fee. This included options such as hold luggage, increased luggage allowance, allocated seating, priority services and in-flight catering.

Cabin

Monarch&#x27;s aircraft operated in an all-economy layout. Several extra space seats were located towards the front of the cabin and adjacent to exit doors.

In-flight entertainment

Monarch provided an in-flight magazine named &quot;Passport&quot;. Its contents included travel guides, a map of Monarch&#x27;s destinations, interviews and company news.

In-flight catering and retail

Monarch offered food and drink available to purchase on board all flights. The menu included a range of hot and cold food items as well as hot and cold drinks, alcoholic beverages and soft drinks.

A range of onboard tax-free/duty-free goods was available to purchase from the &quot;Love to Shop&quot; inflight magazine.

Vantage Club loyalty scheme

Monarch operated a loyalty scheme named Vantage Club. It rewarded regular customers travelling with the airline with additional travel privileges and benefits. There were three membership tier levels - Indigo, Silver and Gold.

==Corporate affairs==
At the time of closure Monarch&#x27;s head office, along with that of Monarch Group, was in Prospect House, on the grounds of London Luton Airport.

===Ownership and structure===
Monarch Airlines was part of the Monarch Group, of which the holding company was Monarch Holdings Ltd., which is 90% owned by Greybull Capital. The group&#x27;s pension fund holds the remaining 10%.

Other subsidiaries of the Monarch Group include Monarch Holidays (previously branded as Cosmos Holidays, but reverted to Globus in 2017), Monarch Hotels, Avro Flights, and Monarch Aircraft Engineering Limited (MAEL). Following the collapse of the other companies, MAEL would survive for another 15 months as a stand-alone company focused on third-party maintenance checks. Burdened by the debt load of the collapsed airline, MAEL would meet the same fate as the rest of the Monarch business on 4 January 2019, with portions sold off piecemeal to competitors

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 14 January 1985, a Boeing 757 (Registration G-MOND) flying Monarch Flight 390 from Tenerife to Luton suffered two mid-flight explosions. Soon after, the aircraft lost electrical power, and smoke began filling the cabin, leading to an emergency landing in Portugal. The cause was leaking lavatory fluid which had come into contact with electrical wiring, resulting in severe electrical arcing. This event created smoke and power surges and caused the aircraft&#x27;s electronic flight interfaces to fail and blank out. It was the first known British-operated aircraft to suffer a severe Kapton-related problem.
* On 22 May 2002, a Boeing 757-200 (Registration G-MONC) suffered structural damage to the forward fuselage in the area of the nose landing gear during landing at Gibraltar Airport while operating a flight from Luton. The captain had used an incorrect landing technique, applying full nose-down elevator. This control input resulted in a high pitch-down rate at nosewheel touchdown, exceeding the design limits, before the aircraft&#x27;s nosewheel had touched the ground. No fatalities occurred.
* On 17 March 2006, the flight deck crew of a Boeing 757-200 (Registration G-MONE) lost visual contact with the runway after passing the Visual Decision Point (VDP) while attempting to land at Gibraltar Airport. During the subsequent go-around, the crew did not follow the correct missed approach procedures. However, air traffic control (ATC) provided effective heading control to avoid striking the high ground. The lowest altitude of the aircraft when overland was 2,100 ft. (The highest point overland, just south of the airfield, is 1,420 ft.) Following the incident, ATC and Monarch Airlines changed their procedures to reduce the chances of repeating a similar occurrence.

<text>Horace C. Porter (April 15, 1837May 29, 1921) was an American soldier and diplomat who served as a lieutenant colonel, ordnance officer and staff officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War, personal secretary to General and President Ulysses S. Grant. He also was secretary to General William T. Sherman, vice president of the Pullman Palace Car Company and U.S. Ambassador to France from 1897 to 1905.

==Early life==

Porter was born in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, on April 15, 1837, the son of David Rittenhouse Porter (1788–1867), an ironmaster who later served as Governor of Pennsylvania, and Josephine McDermott.

His paternal grandfather was Andrew Porter, the Revolutionary War officer and his paternal uncles included George Bryan Porter, the Territorial Governor of Michigan, and James Madison Porter, the Secretary of War. Among his first cousins was Andrew Porter, a Mexican–American War veteran and Union Army brigadier general. His aunt, Elizabeth Porter, was the grandmother of Mary Todd Lincoln.

Porter was educated at The Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, New Jersey (class of 1856) and Harvard University. He graduated from West Point July 1, 1860.

==Career==
Porter was commissioned a second lieutenant on April 22, 1861, and a first lieutenant on June 7, 1861. During the American Civil War, Porter served in the Union Army, reaching the grade of lieutenant colonel by the end of the war.

During the war, he served as chief of ordnance in the Army of the Potomac, Department of the Ohio and the Army of the Cumberland. He was distinguished in the Battle of Fort Pulaski, Georgia, at the Battle of Chickamauga, the Battle of the Wilderness and the Second Battle of Ream&#x27;s Station (New Market Heights). On June 26, 1902, or July 8, 1902, Porter received the Medal of Honor for the Battle of Chickamauga as detailed in the citation noted below. In the last year of the war, he served on the staff of Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, later writing a lively memoir of the experience, &quot;Campaigning With Grant&quot; (1897).

From April 4, 1864, to July 25, 1866, Porter was aide-de-camp to General Ulysses S. Grant with the grade of lieutenant colonel in the regular army. On July 17, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Porter for appointment as brevet brigadier general, to rank from March 13, 1866, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1866. From July 25, 1866, to March 4, 1869, Porter was aide-de-camp to General Ulysses S. Grant with the grade of colonel in the regular army.

===Grant administration===

From 1869 to 1872, Porter served as President Grant&#x27;s personal secretary in the White House. At the same time, he held the grade of colonel and an appointment as aide-de-camp to General William T. Sherman.

Porter had refused to take a $500,000 vested interest bribe from Jay Gould, a Wall Street financier, in the Black Friday gold market scam. He told Grant about Gould&#x27;s attempted bribery, thus warning Grant about Gould&#x27;s intention of cornering the gold market. However, during the Whiskey Ring trials in 1876, Treasury Solicitor Bluford Wilson claimed that Porter was involved with the scandal. Porter testified before the committee investigating the scandal and was never formally charged with wrongdoing. Porter resigned from the U.S. Army on December 31, 1873.

===Later life===
After resigning from the Army, Porter became vice president of the Pullman Palace Car Company, and later, president of the West Shore Railroad. He was U.S. Ambassador to France from 1897 to 1905, paying for the recovery of the body of John Paul Jones and sending it to the United States for re-burial. He received the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor from the French government in 1904. In addition to &quot;Campaigning with Grant&quot;, he also wrote &quot;West Point Life&quot; (1866).

Porter was president of the Union League Club of New York from 1893 to 1897. In that capacity, he was a major force in the construction of Grant&#x27;s Tomb.

He was elected an honorary member of the Pennsylvania Society of the Cincinnati in 1902. He was also a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, the Sons of the American Revolution and a Hereditary Companion of the Military Order of Foreign Wars by right of his descent from Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Porter who served in the American Revolution.

In 1891 he joined the Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution, where he served as President General from 1892 through 1896. He was assigned national membership number 4069 and state membership number 69.

He died in Manhattan, New York and is interred at the Old First Methodist Church Cemetery in West Long Branch, New Jersey.

==Personal life==
In 1863, Porter was married to Sophie King McHarg (1840–1903), the daughter of John McHarg (1813–1884) and Martha Whipple Patch. Together, they were the parents of:

* Horace Porter Jr., who died at the age of 23 of typhoid fever.
* Clarence Porter, who died after the first World War.
* Elsie Porter, who married Edwin Mende of Berne, Switzerland.
* William Porter, who died in infancy.

After a period of suffering, Porter died at New York, New York, May 29, 1921. He was buried in West Long Branch Cemetery, West Long Branch, New Jersey. In his will, he left the Grant Association $10,000 and the flag that flew at General Grant&#x27;s field headquarters during the Civil War.

<text>Michael James Ness (born April 3, 1962) is an American musician who is the lead guitarist, lead vocalist and songwriter for the punk rock band Social Distortion, which was formed in 1979. He has also released two solo albums, &quot;Cheating at Solitaire&quot; and &quot;Under the Influences&quot; (both 1999).

== Early life ==
Ness was born in Stoneham, Massachusetts on April 3, 1962. His family relocated to Orange County, California, later that year, and he grew up in Fullerton. As a child, he idolized gangsters such as John Dillinger and Bonnie and Clyde. At a young age, his parents divorced and he was later kicked out of his father and stepmother&#x27;s home in Fullerton when he was around 15 or 16 years old for incorrigible behavior.

During his early years, Ness was raised on the blues, country and early rock and roll, and he grew up listening to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Johnny Cash, the Supremes, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Led Zeppelin, Lou Reed, David Bowie, ZZ Top, Kiss and Bad Company. As he drifted around Orange County, Ness became involved in the punk rock scene.

In the 1980s, Ness was the original renter of the one-bedroom apartment described in the Adolescents song &quot;Kids of the Black Hole&quot;. The punk house is located in Fullerton and still exists today.

== Career ==

Inspired by The Sex Pistols, Ness founded Social Distortion in 1978 with Casey Royer. He later recruited his high school friend Dennis Danell into the band in 1979, and Ness dropped out of high school at age 17 to focus on his music career. Social Distortion released the &quot;Mainliner/Playpen&quot; 7&quot; record on Robbie Field&#x27;s indie label Posh Boy Records in 1981. Two years later, they released the album &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; (1983) on 13th Floor Records, which was owned by Monk Rock, their manager at the time.

Ness was featured in the independent film &quot;Another State of Mind&quot;, which chronicled Social Distortion&#x27;s first cross-country tour with Youth Brigade. It was on the DVD commentary where he claimed to have never had anything to do with the armed forces or religion. This prompted many fans to consider him an atheist, though some of his lyrics seem to indicate otherwise. Five years passed before Social Distortion released their next album, 1988&#x27;s &quot;Prison Bound&quot;, on the heels of Ness&#x27;s recovery from drug addiction.

Ness performed in the band Easter from 1986 until 1988 and appeared in the music video for the songs &quot;Slipping Away&quot; and &quot;Lights Out&quot;. In 1989, Social Distortion signed a deal with Epic Records and released three albums with that label: &quot;Social Distortion&quot; (1990), &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot; (1992) and &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; (1996).

The band left Epic Records after &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; (1996) and Ness formed Time Bomb Recordings, releasing &quot;&quot; (a collection of old recordings and singles that were done in the early &#x27;80s), a re-issue of the long out of print &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot;, along with a re-issue of their second album &quot;Prison Bound&quot;, and &quot;Live at the Roxy&quot; (1998). Ness married his wife, Christine Marie, in the late 1990s and they have two sons, Julian (born in 1992) and Johnny, Mike&#x27;s stepson (born 1997).

In 1999, Ness released his first solo album, &quot;Cheating at Solitaire&quot;. Although some of Social Distortion&#x27;s songs paid homage to country music artists, &quot;Cheating at Solitaire&quot; was an unalloyed expression of Ness&#x27; country influences. &quot;Solitaire&quot; included guest appearances by Bruce Springsteen, Brian Setzer, Billy Zoom and Josh Freese, as well as members of Royal Crown Revue. Springsteen had touted Social Distortion&#x27;s &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; as his favorite record of the year in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview in 1992.

Ness continued in this vein, releasing a compilation of country covers entitled &quot;Under the Influences&quot; that same year. Both albums came out on Time Bomb Recordings. Ness toured extensively in the US in support of these albums, backed by the 2006 partial incarnation of Social Distortion: ex-Plugz and Bob Dylan drummer Charlie Quintana and Brent Harding (upright and electric bass). Ness and the band played at Woodstock &#x27;99.

Childhood friend and founding member of Social Distortion guitarist Dennis Danell died on February 29, 2000, at 38 due to a brain aneurysm. According to other sources, the Orange County Coroner&#x27;s Office lists his death as &quot;Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy.&quot; Ness was devastated, stating &quot;I am saddened beyond any possible form of expression. Dennis and I have been friends since boyhood, starting Social Distortion together while we were in high school. My deepest regrets to his family.&quot;

Social Distortion went back to work in June 2000 on the album &quot;Sex, Love and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. Many of the songs on this new album are dedicated to Danell, such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Take Me For Granted&quot;, &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; and &quot;Angel&#x27;s Wings&quot;. At an October 2010 concert in New York City Ness dedicated &quot;Don&#x27;t Take Me For Granted&quot; to Joey Ramone.
In 2003, Social Distortion recorded a live DVD called &quot;Live in Orange County&quot; at the House of Blues in Anaheim, California which was released in 2004 along with &quot;Sex, Love and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, both of which were released on Time Bomb Recordings.

These efforts marked the first recordings with a line-up consisting of Ness on guitar and vocals, Wickersham replacing Danell on guitar, and Quintana on drums. It also consisted of a number of songs co-written by Ness and Wickersham. This is the first time Ness collaborated with another songwriter since his 1990 self-titled album, on which he and then bassist John Maurer wrote &quot;So Far Away&quot;. The band&#x27;s lineup changed twice after Maurer left the band, just a month before the release of &quot;Sex, Love and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;.

In February 2006, Ness broke his wrist while skateboarding in Las Vegas. He continued to perform vocals on the tour while T.S.O.L. guitarist Ron Emory filled in on guitar until Ness recovered from the injury. On January 18, 2007, former Social Distortion bass player Brent Liles died after being hit by a tractor trailer truck. Ness dedicated a performance at the Anaheim House of Blues to him shortly after.

Despite earlier reports that the band would begin recording their next studio album by 2008, Social Distortion took a hiatus from touring and recording, when Ness was on tour with his solo band which is composed of two current members of Social Distortion, Brent Harding and Jonny Wickersham.

Also touring with Ness were Chris Lawrence on Telecaster and pedal steel guitar and Dave Raven on drums. In a July 2009 interview with Tarakany! Bad TV, Ness stated that Social Distortion was planning to return to the studio in December of that year or the beginning of 2010 to begin recording their seventh album. The album, now known as &quot;Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes&quot;, was finally released on January 18, 2011.

On May 17, 2008, Ness and his band were joined on stage by Bruce Springsteen at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey for the encore. Songs played were &quot;Misery Loves Company&quot;, &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;, &quot;If You Leave Before Me&quot; and &quot;I Fought the Law&quot;.

On April 16, 2009, Ness joined Springsteen and the E Street Band on stage at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. Songs played included Social Distortion&#x27;s &quot;Bad Luck&quot; and Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;The Rising&quot;. On May 18, 2009, Mike Ness and Social Distortion played a benefit show at the House of Blues in Anaheim, California called &quot;Rock to Recovery&quot; and his son joined him on stage and played lead guitar for the song &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;.

On April 7, 2023, Ness and Social Distortion posted to their Instagram pages that pre production on the band&#x27;s next album was completed and that they would begin recording on April 17. The album was expected to be released in early 2024. However, in June 2023, recording was postponed due to Ness being diagnosed with tonsil cancer. On December 12, 2023, Social Distortion announced that they would be doing a co-headlining tour with Bad Religion in April and May 2024 and they will perform &quot;Mommy’s Little Monster&quot; in its entirety to celebrate the album&#x27;s 40th anniversary. Social Distortion will also do their own headlining tour in September and October 2024.

== Personal life ==
Ness currently lives in Santa Ana, California, with his wife Christine and two sons. He is an avid collector of vintage ephemera such as Hamburglar toys and hot rods, owning a 1954 Chevrolet and a 1936 Ford. In 2003, he founded Black Kat Kustoms with &quot;long time hot rodder and builder&quot; Don Nemarnik. Black Kat Kustoms is an expression of his love for hot rods, cats, bikes, Alpine horns and counter-culture clothing.

In a 2015 interview with Eric Walden, he said in reference to the song &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;, &quot;It was basically, &#x27;I&#x27;ve seen God,&#x27; I guess if you will — God of my understanding; I&#x27;m not a religious guy; I do consider myself a spiritual man.&quot;

On June 7, 2023, Mike Ness announced that he was diagnosed with stage one tonsil cancer and is expected to make a full recovery from surgery. Ness said that it is &quot;a day-by-day process and in three weeks we start radiation and that should be the last therapy I need.&quot;

== Equipment ==
=== Electric guitars ===
Early in his career, Ness was seen using Gibson SGs and SG Juniors, most notably a black 1970&#x27;s SG covered in stickers as seen on the cover of the compilation album &quot;&quot;. He currently uses four 1970s Gibson Les Paul Deluxes (two sunburst models from 1971 &amp; 1975, and two goldtop models from 1975 &amp; 1976). His 1976 goldtop is his favorite and most used guitar currently, however his 1971 sunburst was his main guitar for many years, especially through the 1990s. Ness uses Eb Standard tuning and usually uses a capo on the second fret while using his goldtops. He has used Seymour Duncan P-90 pickups in all of his guitars since touring with Neil Young in the early 1990s; Ness recalled seeing Young&#x27;s guitar tech take the stock mini humbucker pickups out of a Les Paul Deluxe, throw them in the trash and replace them with the P-90s. Ness&#x27; goldtops have maple necks which he says contribute to his tone especially when using a capo on the second fret. He also once used a non-reverse Gibson Firebird, as seen on the back cover of Social Distortion&#x27;s 1983 debut &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot;, and a white Gibson Les Paul Custom in the &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; and &quot;Story of My Life&quot; music videos.

=== Acoustic guitars ===
In an interview with Guitar.com Ness said: &quot;The guitar that I write on is a 1940 Gibson J-45. I have three of them – I searched high and low for them. I had a 1940 Martin D-18 that I sold last year; I&#x27;m just a Gibson guy. I gravitate to the Gibson J-45 every time I write. It&#x27;s a balladeer&#x27;s guitar&quot;. Ness also plays a 1939 Gibson J-35, that he says &quot;...very rarely leaves the house...&quot;.

=== Amplifiers ===
Ness uses Fender Bassman amps modified by Fred Taccone of Divided by 13 through Marshall 4x12 slant cabs with Celestion Greenback speakers. Most of his touring amps were modded by Billy Zoom of the band X. Zoom&#x27;s modifications include a wattage switch to select between 40, 20 or 10 watts, and replacing the bass channel with a higher gain channel. The only effect pedal Ness uses live is an overdrive, previously a Boss SD-1 and currently a Klon Centaur, though he has used various delays in the studio.

<text>The Securities Act of 1933, also known as the 1933 Act, the Securities Act, the Truth in Securities Act, the Federal Securities Act, and the &#x27;33 Act, was enacted by the United States Congress on May 27, 1933, during the Great Depression and after the stock market crash of 1929. It is an integral part of United States securities regulation. It is legislated pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Clause of the Constitution. 

It requires every offer or sale of securities that uses the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce to be registered with the SEC pursuant to the 1933 Act, unless an exemption from registration exists under the law. The term &quot;means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce&quot; is extremely broad and it is virtually impossible to avoid the operation of the statute by attempting to offer or sell a security without using an &quot;instrumentality&quot; of interstate commerce. Any use of a telephone, for example, or the mails would probably be enough to subject the transaction to the statute.

==History==

The 1933 Act was the first major federal legislation to regulate the offer and sale of securities. Prior to the Act, regulation of securities was chiefly governed by state laws, commonly referred to as blue sky laws. When Congress enacted the 1933 Act, it left existing state blue sky securities laws in place. It was originally enforced by the FTC, until the SEC was created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The original law was separated into two titles. Title I is formally entitled the Securities Act of 1933, while title 2 is the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders Act, 1933. In 1939, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 was added as Title 3. The original Title I contained 26 sections. In 1980, the Small Business Issuers&#x27; Simplification Act of 1980 amended section 4. In 1995, section 27 was added by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

The 1933 Act is based upon a philosophy of disclosure, meaning that the goal of the law is to require issuers to fully disclose all material information that a reasonable shareholder would need in order to make up his or her mind about the potential investment. This is very different from the philosophy of the blue sky laws, which generally impose so-called &quot;merit reviews&quot;. Blue sky laws often impose very specific, qualitative requirements on offerings, and if a company does not meet the requirements in that state then it simply will not be allowed to do a registered offering there, no matter how fully its faults are disclosed in the prospectus. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 added a new Section 18 to the 1933 Act which preempts blue sky law merit review of certain kinds of offerings.

Part of the New Deal, the Act was drafted by Benjamin V. Cohen, Thomas Corcoran, and James M. Landis, and signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

== Purpose ==

The primary purpose of the &#x27;33 Act is to ensure that buyers of securities receive complete and accurate information before they invest in securities. Unlike state blue sky laws, which impose merit reviews, the &#x27;33 Act embraces a disclosure philosophy, meaning that in theory, it is not illegal to sell a bad investment, as long as all the facts are accurately disclosed. A company that is required to register under the &#x27;33 act must create a registration statement, which includes a prospectus, with copious information about the security, the company, the business, including audited financial statements. The company, the underwriter and other individuals signing the registration statement are strictly liable for any inaccurate statements in the document. This extremely high level of liability exposure drives an enormous effort, known as &quot;due diligence&quot;, to ensure that the document is complete and accurate. The law bolsters and helps to maintain investor confidence which in turn supports the stock market.

== Registration process ==

Unless they qualify for an exemption, securities offered or sold to a United States Person must be registered by filing a registration statement with the SEC. Although the law is written to require registration of securities, it is more useful as a practical matter to consider the requirement to be that of registering offers and sales. If person A registers a sale of securities to person B, and then person B seeks to resell those securities, person B must still either file a registration statement or find an available exemption.

The prospectus, which is the document through which an issuer&#x27;s securities are marketed to a potential investor, is included as part of the registration statement. The SEC prescribes the relevant forms on which an issuer&#x27;s securities must be registered. The law describes required disclosures in Schedule A and Schedule B; however, in 1982, the SEC created Regulation S-K to consolidate duplicate information into an &quot;integrated disclosure system&quot;. Among other things, registration forms call for:

* a description of the securities to be offered for sale;
* information about the management of the issuer;
* information about the securities (if other than common stock); and
* financial statements certified by independent accountants.

Registration statements and the incorporated prospectuses become public shortly after they are filed with the SEC. The statements can be obtained from the SEC&#x27;s website using EDGAR. Registration statements are subject to SEC examination for compliance with disclosure requirements. It is illegal for an issuer to lie in, or to omit material facts from, a registration statement or prospectus. Furthermore, when some true fact is disclosed, even if disclosing the fact would not have been required, it is illegal to not provide all other information required to make the fact not misleading.

=== Exemptions ===

Not all offerings of securities must be registered with the SEC. Section 3(a) outlines various classes of exempt securities, and Section 3(b) allows the SEC to write rules exempting securities if the agency determines that registration is not needed due to &quot;the small amount involved or the limited character of the public offering&quot;. Section (4)(a)(2) exempts &quot;transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering&quot; which has historically created confusion due to the lack of a specific definition of &quot;public offering&quot;; the Supreme Court provided clarification in &quot;SEC v. Ralston Purina Co.&quot;

Some exemptions from the registration requirements include:
* private offerings to a specific type or limited number of persons or institutions;
* offerings of limited size;
* intrastate offerings; and
* securities of municipal, state, and federal governments.

Regardless of whether securities must be registered, the 1933 Act makes it illegal to commit fraud in conjunction with the offer or sale of securities. A defrauded investor can sue for recovery under the 1933 Act.

==Rule 144==

Rule 144, promulgated by the SEC under the 1933 Act, permits, under limited circumstances, the public resale of restricted and controlled securities without registration. In addition to restrictions on the minimum length of time for which such securities must be held and the maximum volume permitted to be sold, the issuer must agree to the sale. If certain requirements are met, Form 144 must be filed with the SEC. Often, the issuer requires that a legal opinion be given indicating that the resale complies with the rule. The amount of securities sold during any subsequent three-month period generally does not exceed any of the following limitations:
* 1% of the stock outstanding
* the average weekly reported volume of trading in the securities on all national securities exchanges for the preceding 4 weeks
* the average weekly volume of trading of the securities reported through the consolidated transactions reporting system (NASDAQ)

Notice of resale is provided to the SEC if the amount of securities sold in reliance on Rule 144 in any three-month period exceeds 5,000 shares or if they have an aggregate sales price in excess of $50,000. After one year, Rule 144(k) allows for the permanent removal of the restriction except as to &#x27;insiders&#x27;. In cases of mergers, buyouts, or takeovers, owners of securities who had previously filed Form 144 and still wish to sell restricted and controlled securities must refile Form 144 once the merger, buyout, or takeover has been completed.

SIFMA, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, issued &quot;SIFMA Guidance: Procedures, Covenants, and Remedies in Light of Revised Rule 144&quot; after revisions were made to Rule 144.

===Rule 144A===
Rule 144 is not to be confused with Rule 144A. Rule 144A, adopted in April 1990, provides a safe harbor from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 for certain private (as opposed to public) resales of restricted securities to qualified institutional buyers. Rule 144A has become the principal safe harbor on which non-U.S. companies rely when accessing the U.S. capital markets.

==Regulation S==
Regulation S is a &quot;safe harbor&quot; that defines when an offering of securities is deemed to be executed in another country and therefore not be subject to the registration requirement under Section 5 of the 1933 Act. The regulation includes two safe harbor provisions: an issuer safe harbor and a resale safe harbor. In each case, the regulation demands that offers and sales of the securities be made outside the United States and that no offering participant (which includes the issuer, the banks assisting with the offer, and their respective affiliates) engage in &quot;directed selling efforts&quot;. In the case of issuers for whose securities there is substantial U.S. market interest, the regulation also requires that no offers and sales be made to U.S. persons (including U.S. persons physically located outside the United States).

Section 5 of the 1933 Act is meant primarily as protection for United States investors. As such, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had only weakly enforced regulation of foreign transactions, and had only limited Constitutional authority to regulate foreign transactions. This law applies to its own unique definition of United States person.

==Civil liability; Sections 11 and 12==
Violation of the registration requirements can lead to near-strict civil liability for the issuer, underwriters, directors, officers, and accountants under §§ 11, 12(a)(1), or 12(a)(2) of the 1933 Act. However, in practice the liability is typically covered by directors and officers liability insurance or indemnification clauses.

To have &quot;standing&quot; to sue under Section 11 of the 1933 Act, such as in a class action, a plaintiff must be able to prove that he can &quot;trace&quot; his shares to the registration statement in question, as to which there is an alleged material misstatement or omission. In the absence of the plaintiff having an ability to actually trace his shares to the allegedly defective registration statement, such as when securities issued at multiple times -- and not all under the same registration statement which contains the alleged defect -- are held together by the Depository Trust Company in its nominee name in a fungible bulk, the plaintiff may be barred from pursuing his claim for lack of standing.

Class action complaints involving federal Section 11 claims and state claims under the &#x27;33 Act rose 43% in 2022. Over a fifth of all core federal filings included Section 11 allegations.

Additional liability may be imposed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Rule 10b-5) against the &quot;maker&quot; of the alleged misrepresentation in certain circumstances.

<doc id="208938" wikidata="Q6017292" url="?curid=208938" title="Independent Television Commission">
<text>The Independent Television Commission (ITC) licensed and regulated commercial television services in the United Kingdom (except S4C in Wales) between 1 January 1991 and 28 December 2003.

==History==

The creation of ITC, by the Broadcasting Act 1990 to replace the television regulation functions of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (formed by the Sound Broadcasting Act 1972) and Cable Authority. From 1 January 1991 it regulated the existing ITV network. The 1990 Act also established the Channel Four Television Corporation to run Channel 4, regulated by the ITC. There was no fanfare, as control was passed from Channel Four Television Company Limited.

==Activities==
The establishing Act required the auction of Channel 3 licences for the fifteen ITV regions and nationwide breakfast time. Most of the Channel 3 licences were awarded to the incumbent ITV companies; however there were some controversial decisions:

*Carlton Television outbid Thames Television for the London Weekday licence; CPV-TV was the highest bidder, but its bid failed due to quality considerations.
*GMTV (changed to &quot;Good Morning Television&quot; as the bid name &#x27;Sunrise Television&#x27; was already used by Sky News) outbid TV-am for the Breakfast television licence.
*TVS and TSW were deemed to have overbid for their licences, and hence their franchises were awarded to lower bidders Meridian Broadcasting and Westcountry Television, respectively.

On 1 January 1993 these new arrangements came into force, and the ITC began its job of &#x27;light-touch regulation&#x27;. During this time, the ITC regulated the Channel 3 system as well as Channel 4. It issued licences to new satellite broadcasters and awarded the Channel 5 licence in the mid-1990s. It also regulated cable TV.

In the early 2000s, the British government, in a white paper, declared its intention to merge the ITC with the Radio Authority, Office of Telecommunications, and Radiocommunications Agency. This merger, under the Communications Act 2003, took effect on 29 December 2003. Most powers of the ITC are now exercised by the Office of Communications (Ofcom), making some powers – and the ITC itself – defunct.
At this point, technical standards regulation, previously carried out in accordance with the IBA engineering &quot;Code of Practice&quot;, seems to have disappeared from the regulatory landscape.

Technical standards are part of the licence conditions and both are set by Ofcom, this is the current technical standard issued by Ofcom; https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0023/62663/broadcast-TV-technical-codes.pdf

==Chairman==
&quot;George Russell, last chairman of IBA&quot;
* Sir George Russell (1 Jan 1991 – 31 Dec 1996)
* Sir Robin Biggam (1 Jan 1997 – 28 Dec 2003)

==The ITC&#x27;s co-regulators and origins==
=== Timeline of communications regulators (1953–present) ===


Alongside the ITC, two other independent bodies also dealt with complaints: the Broadcasting Complaints Commission dealt with injustices against individuals, whereas the Broadcasting Standards Council dealt with complaints about the moral content of programs, with no redress for individuals.

Historically, all of independent television (from 22 September 1955) and radio (from 8 October 1973) was governed by the IBA (Independent Broadcasting Authority) – joined by the Cable Authority in 1984. On 1 July 1985, the Home Secretary asked the IBA to review prospects for commercial DBS.

In 1988, the Broadcasting Standards Council was set up to monitor &#x27;taste and decency&#x27; on television. In 1990, large-scale changes brought about the Radio Authority, the privatization of the IBA&#x27;s engineering division as NTL, and formation of the Independent Television Commission.

Since its formation, the BBC has been primarily responsible for its own governance - initially through the Corporation&#x27;s Board of Governors and since 1 January 2007 through the BBC Trust.

<doc id="208941" wikidata="Q1934287" url="?curid=208941" title="Derivatives market">
<text>The derivatives market is the financial market for derivatives - financial instruments like futures contracts or options - which are derived from other forms of assets.

The market can be divided into two, that for exchange-traded derivatives and that for over-the-counter derivatives. The legal nature of these products is very different, as well as the way they are traded, though many market participants are active in both. The derivatives market in Europe has a notional amount of €660 trillion.

==Participants in a derivative market==
Participants in a derivative market can be segregated into four sets based on their trading motives.
* Hedgers
* Speculators
* Margin Traders
* Arbitrageurs

==Types of trades in a derivative market==

* Directional Trades
* Spreads
* Arbitrage positions
* Hedged Trades

==Futures markets==

Futures exchanges, such as Euronext.liffe and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, trade in standardized derivative contracts. These are options contracts, swaps contracts and futures contracts on a whole range of underlying products. The members of the exchange hold positions in these contracts with the exchange, who acts as central counterparty. When one party goes long (buys a futures contract), another goes short (sells). When a new contract is introduced, the total position in the contract is zero. Therefore, the sum of all the long positions must be equal to the sum of all the short positions. In other words, risk is transferred from one party to another is a type of a zero sum game. The total notional amount of all the outstanding positions at the end of June 2004 stood at $53 trillion (source: Bank for International Settlements (BIS): ). That figure grew to $81 trillion by the end of March 2008 (source: BIS )

==Over-the-counter markets==
Tailor-made derivatives, not traded on a futures exchange are traded on over-the-counter markets, also known as the OTC market. These consist of investment banks with traders who make markets in these derivatives, and clients such as hedge funds, commercial banks, government-sponsored enterprises, etc. Products that are always traded over-the-counter are swaps, forward rate agreements, forward contracts, credit derivatives, accumulators etc. The total notional amount of all the outstanding positions at the end of June 2004 stood at $220 trillion (source: BIS: ). By the end of 2007 this figure had risen to $596 trillion and in 2009 it stood at $615 trillion (source: BIS: )

OTC Markets are generally separated into two key segments: the customer market and the interdealer market. Customers almost exclusively trade through dealers because of the high search and transaction costs. Dealers are large institutions that arrange transactions for their customers, utilizing their specialized knowledge, expertise, and access to capital. In order to hedge the risks incurred by transacting with customers, dealers turn to the interdealer market, or the exchange-traded markets. Dealers can also trade for themselves or act as market makers in the OTC market (source: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago ).

* Total derivatives (notional amount): $182.2 trillion (second quarter, 2008)
** Interest rate contracts: $145.0 trillion (86%)
** Foreign exchange contracts: $18.2 trillion(10%)
** 2008 Second Quarter, banks reported trading revenues of $1.6 billion 
* Total number of commercial banks holding derivatives: 975

Positions in the OTC derivatives market have increased at a rapid pace since the last triennial survey was undertaken in 2004. Notional amounts outstanding of such instruments totalled $516 trillion at the end of June 2007 (according to the Bank for International Settlements ), 135% higher than the level recorded in the 2004 survey (Graph 4). This corresponds to an annualised compound rate of growth of 34%, which is higher than the approximatively 25% average annual rate of increase since positions in OTC derivatives were first surveyed by the BIS in 1995. Notional amounts outstanding provide useful information on the structure of the OTC derivatives market but should not be interpreted as a measure of the riskiness of these positions. Gross market values, which represent the cost of replacing all open contracts at the prevailing market prices, have increased by 74% since 2004, to $11 trillion at the end of June 2007. (page 28)

Notional amounts outstanding as of December 2012 are $632 trillion as per recent survey.

==Role in the financial crisis of 2007–2008==

The derivative markets played an important role in the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Credit default swaps (CDSs), financial instruments traded on the over the counter derivatives markets, and mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), a type of securitized debt were notable contributors. The leveraged operations are said to have generated an &quot;irrational appeal&quot; for risk taking, and the lack of clearing obligations also appeared as very damaging for the balance of the market. More specifically, interdealer collateral management and risk management systems proved to be inadequate.
The G-20&#x27;s proposals for financial markets reform all stress these points, and suggest:
*higher capital standards
*stronger risk management
*international surveillance of financial firms&#x27; operations
*dynamic capital rules.

<text>EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) is an internal database system operated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that performs automated collection, validation, indexing, and accepted forwarding of submissions by companies and others who are required by law to file forms with the SEC. The database contains a wealth of information about the commission and the securities industry which is freely available to the public via the Internet.

In September 2017, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton revealed the database had been hacked and that companies&#x27; data may have been used by criminals for insider trading.

==History==
Development began in 1993, and companies were phased in to EDGAR filing over a three-year period, ending 6 May 1996.

== Filings ==
Not all SEC filings by public companies are available on EDGAR. As of that date, all public domestic companies were required to submit their filings via EDGAR, except for hardcopy paper filings, which were allowed under a hardship exemption. Third-party filings with respect to these companies, such as tender offers and Schedule 13D filings, are also filed via EDGAR.

The vast majority of documents are now filed electronically, with over 3,000 filings per day.

On November4, 2002, the SEC required all foreign companies and foreign governments to file their documents via EDGAR. Prior to that time, electronic filing by foreign companies also was voluntary.

Actual annual reports to shareholders (except in the case of mutual fund companies) need not be submitted on EDGAR, although some companies do so voluntarily. However, the annual report on Form 10-K is required to be filed on EDGAR. As of March31, 2018, there were over 12 million filings to EDGAR.

<doc id="208943" wikidata="Q113947417" url="?curid=208943" title="Touch (sport)">
<text>Touch (also known as touch football or touch rugby) is a variant of rugby league that is conducted under the direction of the Federation of International Touch (FIT). Though it shares similarities and history with rugby league, it is recognised as a sport in its own right due to its differences which have been developed over the sport&#x27;s lifetime.

Touch is a variation of rugby league with the tackling of opposing players replaced by a touch. As touches must be made with minimal force, touch is therefore considered a limited-contact sport. The original basic rules of touch were established in the 1960s by members of the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club in Sydney, Australia.

Distinctive features of touch include the ease of learning it, minimal equipment requirements, ability to play it without fear of major injury, and the regularity of males and females playing together, and as such it is often played either as alternative to or as a soft introduction to full-blown rugby football. While it is generally played with two teams of six on-field players, some social competitions allow a different number of players per team on the field. It is played by both sexes, and in age divisions from primary school children to over-60s. The mixed version of the sport (where both male and female players are on the field at the same time) is particularly popular with social players but is also played at an International representative level.

==History==

=== Origins ===

While it is often claimed that Touch started in Australia in 1963 as a social or &quot;park&quot; game and as a training technique for rugby league, at least as early as 1956, supervised &quot;touch and pass&quot; was already being played at several inner city schools in the North of England, where asphalt playgrounds made normal rugby league too dangerous. Although the rules were set out by the schools&#x27; sports teachers, it was not then viewed as a sport in its own right.

Touch was formalised into a sport proper by the &quot;Founders of Touch&quot;, Bob Dyke and Ray Vawdon of the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club. On 13 July 1968 an organisation known as the &quot;South Sydney Touch Football Club&quot; was formed and the sport of Touch Football was officially born. The first official Touch match was played in late 1968 and the first official competition, organised by Dyke &amp; Vawdon, was held at Rowland Park Sydney in 1968.

From its formal inception in 1968, the game quickly became a fully regulated and codified sport in Australia. Originally played under lightly modified rugby league laws to remove hard physical contact, the sport has since evolved under its own specific rules now quite varied from its rugby league roots. The reduction of field size to half that of a rugby league field in particular aided the sports rapid growth across Australian rugby league stronghold areas as it allowed greater participating in the same geographic footprint.

The sport was first played in Brisbane, Australia in 1972 and by 1973 there were representative matches between sides representing the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales. It had spread to New Zealand by 1975 and in 1978 the first national body, the &quot;Australian Touch Football Association&quot; (ATFA), now Touch Football Australia (TFA) was formed. The sports first national representative event, the Australian National Championships, was held on the Gold Coast, Queensland in 1980.

The ATFA dropped the word &quot;Football&quot; from its name in 1981, becoming the &quot;Australian Touch Association&quot; or &quot;ATA&quot; and thereby changing the sports name to simply Touch. In the same year, the ATA published the sports first formal set of playing rules.

The first international match was played between Australia and New Zealand in Melbourne in 1985, leading to the creation of the Federation of International Touch and the formulation of the sports first set of global rules based on the playing rules in use by the ATA at the time.

==Rules and equipment==

=== Rules ===
The current rules are based on the 8th Edition published by the Australian governing body, Touch Football Australia, in 2020. The updated rules were subsequently adopted by FIT as the FIT 5th Edition Playing Rules. The rules include a section of touch-specific terms and phrases, many of which are shared with rugby league (e.g. offside, intercept, try).

=== Playing field ===
Touch is played on a grass, rectangular field measuring 70 x 50 metres (i.e. slightly larger than one half of a rugby league field). As kicking is not allowed, goal posts are not required.

=== Ball ===
Touch balls are oval and slightly smaller than rugby league balls. The official size is 36 cm long and 55 cm in circumference, also sometimes known as rugby size 4.

=== Clothing ===
Players typically wear light clothing such as singlets, T-shirts or polo shirts and shorts. All shirts must be numbered. Women generally wear lycra bike shorts, athletic briefs or swimsuit-style lycra bodysuits. Head caps or visors are also commonly worn on the touch field by players and officials.

=== Footwear ===
Players normally wear soft rubber cleated shoes, similar to those used in other grass sports such as cricket and field hockey. Screw-in cleats are strictly prohibited, though moulded-sole football boots may be worn.

=== Referee ===
Touch must have at least one referee to manage a match but most major matches feature a team of three referees alternating between a controlling referee and two sideline referees throughout the match.

===Positions===
Teams are generally split into three positions: two &quot;wings&quot; (the players on either edge of the field i.e. &#x27;right wing&#x27; and &#x27;left wing&#x27;); two &quot;middles&quot; (the central players); and two &quot;links&quot; (the players between the wings and middles, one on each side of the field i.e. &#x27;right link&#x27; and &#x27;left link&#x27;).

===Half===
The half (formerly known as the &quot;acting half&quot; or &quot;dummy half&quot;) is subject to a number of restrictions that do not apply to other players:
* If the half is touched with the ball, the attacking team loses possession.
* The half cannot score a try. Attempting to do so (even grounding the ball not purposefully) results in a change of possession.
These restrictions do not apply to a Half who passes the ball to a teammate (or indeed opposition player) and then receives it back.

At a rollball, if the Half takes too long to retrieve the ball, or is further than 1m away from the position of the rollball, defenders are allowed to move forward before the Half has touched the ball.

===Mode of play===
The ball can be passed or knocked (but not kicked) sideways or backwards between teammates (known as &quot;Attackers&quot;), who attempt to evade opposition players (known as &quot;Defenders&quot;) to score a Try.

===Possession===
A team normally retains possession for a set of six consecutive touches (as in rugby league), after which possession transfers to the opposing team. This is known as a &quot;Change of Possession&quot;. This can occur after six touches are completed, if the ball is dropped by the attacking team, or if the attacking team is penalised by the referee for infringing the playing rules.

===Scoring===
A Try (formerly &quot;Touchdown&quot;) is awarded when an attacking player, who is not the Half places the ball on or over the opposition&#x27;s try line. Each Try is worth one point, though some mixed social competitions award female players two points in order to encourage ball sharing.

===Interchanges===
* Players may interchange an unlimited number of times throughout the match provided the team does not exceed the maximum number of on-field players allowed, which is usually six under standard FIT rules.
* The match remains continuous and does not stop to allow interchanges.
* Players coming onto the field must wait until the player they are interchanging with has left the field and entered the designated &quot;Interchange Area&quot;. Failing to do so can result in the referee awarding a penalty for an incorrect interchange.
* Players in a team who are not on the field must remain inside their allocated Interchange Area (sometimes called &quot;substitution box&quot;) until they enter the field.

===Composition of teams===
* Teams can consist of all male players (&quot;Men&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot; competitions), all female players (&quot;Women&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;Girls&quot; competitions), or a combination of both (&quot;Mixed&quot; competitions).
* Under standard FIT rules, each team can consist of up to 14 players, of which up to six players can be on the field at any one time.
* Mixed teams typically comprise three females and three males on the field at one time. Under standard FIT rules, there must be at least one male and one female, and no more than three males on the field at any time.

===Match duration===
The standard match duration is 40 minutes (two x 20-minute halves) with a 5-minute halftime, though other time frames are often used to suit local conditions and competitions.

==World Rugby==
World Rugby, the international governing body of the rules of rugby union, published in November 2010 a draft of leisure rules of Touch Rugby IRB for developmental purposes. Those Laws were adapted from the FIT playing rules for the sport of Touch.

The document states: &quot;Council agreed that these Leisure Rugby Laws are issued as a guide for developmental purposes and Unions are not bound to apply the Laws&quot; and &quot;IRB Leisure Rugby Laws have been designed so that Unions may develop non-Contact Rugby. These Laws have been produced so that there are some guidelines and principles in place for IRB Leisure Rugby. Unions having jurisdiction over their developmental processes, matches, competitions and festivals may need to vary these Laws as deemed appropriate. This allows domestic Rugby clubs to adapt to the FIT playing rules, provided domestic Touch Associations are in agreeance.&quot;

The leisure rugby laws released by World Rugby are not supported or recognised by the Federation of International Touch.

==International competitions==

===World Cup===
The inaugural Touch World Cup was held on the Gold Coast, Australia in 1988. Since then, the event has been hosted in Auckland, New Zealand (1991), Waikiki Beach, Hawaii (1995), Sydney, Australia (1999), Kamagaya, Japan (2003), Stellenbosch, South Africa (2007), Edinburgh, Scotland (2011), Coffs Harbour, Australia (2015), and Putrajaya, Malaysia (2019) .

The most recent world cup was held in Nottingham, England from July 15th - 21st, 2024, and the 2028 World Cup will be held in New Zealand.

==== Youth World Cup ====
FIT conducted the first Youth Touch World Cup in Auckland, New Zealand in January 2001, followed by the second event on the Sunshine Coast, Australia in 2005. A third event was planned for 2009 however did not eventuate due to budget constraints. The Youth Touch World Cup was eventually revived in 2018 and was held in Putrajaya, Malaysia and served as a trial run for the Touch Football World Cup held in the city the following year.

The fourth Youth Touch World Cup was scheduled to be held in Manchester, England in 2021, but was rescheduled to 2023 as a result of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.

===Trans-Tasman Tests===
There is a regular program of Test matches between Australia and New Zealand known as Trans-Tasman Tests.

Tests are divided into separate events for each age category, being:
* Open (Unrestricted)
* Youth (Under 21)
* Senior or &quot;Masters&quot; (Over 30)

===Pacific Games===
Touch has been played at the Pacific Games since 2003. It is an optional sport for the Pacific Games program and the tournaments include men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and mixed competitions.

=== European Championships ===
The Federation of International Touch (FIT) conducts the European Touch Championships, affectionately known as &quot;The Euros&quot;, biannually.

The first Euros took place in 2010 in Bristol, UK with 19 teams contesting men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s open divisions. The 2012 Euros in Treviso, Italy introduced mixed touch and seniors and masters divisions.

The sixth and most recent Euros were played in Nottingham from 2-6 August 2022, with 62 teams from 17 countries contesting 10 divisions, including men&#x27;s 50s for the first time.

===Masters Games===
Touch is popular sport at various Masters Games events.

===World All Schools===
The World All Schools event attracts hundreds of teams from schools around the world. It is held every 2 years. In 2006 the event was held in Singapore, prior to that it was held in Brisbane. The 2008 event (held in Brisbane after the event was cancelled in New Zealand) was by far the largest, hosting over 250 teams.

==Touch worldwide==
===Australia===

Touch is played in every Australian state and territory, and is particularly popular in the rugby league and rugby union strongholds of Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT. There are currently over 700,000 registered Touch players, 500,000 school children, and up to 100,000 casual players playing the sport. The peak governing body was formed in 1978 as the &quot;Australian Touch Football Association&quot;. In 1981 the word &quot;football&quot; was dropped from the name and the organisation became the &quot;Australian Touch Association&quot;. After a restructure and merger of the national body with the state-level governing bodies (except the Queensland and New South Wales associations) in 2004, the word &quot;football&quot; was re-incorporated into the organisations new name - Touch Football Australia.

From 1997 until 2018, Australia&#x27;s main domestic competition was the National Touch League (NTL). Thirteen permits, representing all parts of Australia, compete in open-age, under-20 and over-age (Masters) divisions in men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and mixed categories. The permits were originally designed to equalise competition between the traditionally strong Touch states of Queensland and NSW, and the remainder of the country. The &quot;Elite 8&quot; series, an additional competition played at the same time as the NTL, was created in 2013 to provide a further elite domestic level to the sport. As a result, the &quot;20 Years &amp; Under&quot; division for that year&#x27;s NTL was removed. The &quot;Elite 8&quot; was eventually replaced in 2018 by the NRL Touch Premiership though the NTL continues.

A youth version of the National Touch League, formerly known as the &quot;National 18&#x27;s&quot; and now known as the &quot;National Youth Championships&quot;, is held annually. The original &quot;National 18&#x27;s&quot; event included only an &quot;18 Years &amp; Under&quot; division but was expanded and renamed in 2013 to accommodate the &quot;20 Years &amp; Under&quot; division after it was removed from the NTL as a result of the Elite 8 Series. The &quot;20 Years &amp; Under&quot; division reverted back to the NTL in 2014 where it has remained since. The event has simultaneously been held with the National Schools Cup, an event featuring the best school-based teams from each state. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic affected National Youth Championships was run simultaneously with the Queensland Junior State Championships to expand the event to include &quot;12 Years &amp; Under&quot;, &quot;14 Years &amp; Under&quot;, and &quot;16 Years &amp; Under&quot;, a format which was further expanded in 2021 when entry to those age divisions was opened to teams from outside of Queensland.

The first state of origin series between the stronghold states of Queensland and New South Wales was played in Port Macquarie, New South Wales in 1995 and has been played every two years since. The series originally featured a single Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s divisions, but was expanded in 1999 to include a Mixed division, and age-restricted divisions.

School Sport Australia conducts an annual National Championships, which includes division for both Primary School (Under 12) and Middle School (Under 15) sides. The location of the event rotates between states each year, and most Australian States and Territories enter Boys and Girls teams in every division.

Touch Football Australia (TFA) and the National Rugby League (NRL) signed a memorandum of understanding in August 2013, bringing the two entities together to form a partnership to develop the sport across both codes. The agreement recognised the similarities between both Touch and Rugby league and that the significant benefits to both through a dual-track pathway. The agreement resulted in the creation of a unified &quot;NRL Touch Football&quot; brand in Australia, which resulted in a major profile and funding boost for the sport within the country, including the signing of a commercial partnership agreement between the two entities and the principle &quot;whole of game sponsor&quot;, initially Harvey Norman and later Doordash.

In May 2018, under the NRL Touch Football partnership, the organisation launched the NRL Touch Premiership, a domestic home and away series played as curtain raisers to NRL matches. The initial teams were drawn from the Elite 8 Series and aligned to NRL clubs.

<doc id="208952" wikidata="Q57645" url="?curid=208952" title="Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen">
<text>Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen (Adelaide Amelia Louise Theresa Caroline; 13 August 1792 – 2 December 1849) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Queen of Hanover from 26 June 1830 to 20 June 1837 as the wife of King William IV. Adelaide was the daughter of George I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, and Luise Eleonore of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia, is named after her.

==Early life==

Adelaide was born on 13 August 1792 at Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany, the eldest child of Georg I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, and Luise Eleonore, daughter of Christian Albrecht, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. She was baptised at the castle chapel on 19 August and was titled &quot;Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, Duchess in Saxony&quot; with the style &quot;Serene Highness&quot;. Her godparents numbered 21, including her mother, the Holy Roman Empress, the Queen of Naples and Sicily, the Crown Princess of Saxony, the Duchess of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg, the Duchess of Saxe-Weimar, the Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, and the Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld.

Saxe-Meiningen was a small state, covering about . It was the most liberal German state and, unlike its neighbours, permitted a free press and criticism of the ruler. At the time no statute existed barring a female ruling over the small duchy and it was not until the birth of her brother, Bernhard, in 1800 that the law of primogeniture was introduced.

==Marriage==

By the end of 1811, King George III was incapacitated and, although he was still king in name, his heir-apparent and eldest son, Prince George, was regent. On 6 November 1817, the Prince Regent&#x27;s only legitimate child, Princess Charlotte, died in childbirth. Princess Charlotte was second in line to the throne: had she outlived her father and grandfather, she would have become queen. With her death, the King was left with twelve children and no legitimate grandchildren. The Prince Regent was estranged from his wife, who was 49 years old, thus there was little likelihood that he would have any further legitimate children. To secure the line of succession, Prince William, Duke of Clarence and St Andrews, and the other sons of George III sought quick marriages with the intent of producing offspring who could inherit the throne. William already had ten children by the popular actress Dorothea Jordan, but, being illegitimate, they were barred from the succession.

Considerable allowances were likely to be voted by Parliament to any royal duke who married, and this acted as a further incentive for William to marry. While Adelaide was a princess from an unimportant German state, William had a limited choice of available princesses, and, after deals with other candidates fell through, a marriage to Adelaide was arranged. The allowance proposed was slashed by Parliament, and the outraged Duke considered calling off the marriage. However, Adelaide still seemed the ideal candidate of a wife: amiable, home-loving, and willing to accept William&#x27;s illegitimate children as part of the family. The arrangement was settled and William wrote to his eldest son, &quot;She is doomed, &quot;poor dear innocent young&quot; creature, to be my wife.&quot; William eventually accepted the reduced increase in his allowance voted by Parliament, her dowry was set at 20,000 florins, with three additional separate annuities being promised by her future husband, the Prince Regent, and the state of Saxe-Meiningen.

Adelaide married William in a double wedding with William&#x27;s brother, Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, and his bride Victoria, Dowager Princess of Leiningen, on 11 July 1818, at Kew Palace in Surrey, England. They had met for the first time only a week earlier on 4 July at Grillon&#x27;s Hotel in Bond Street. Neither William nor Adelaide had been married before, and William was 27 years her senior. Despite these unromantic circumstances, the couple settled amicably in Hanover, where the cost of living was much lower than in England, and by all accounts were devoted to each other throughout their marriage. Adelaide improved William&#x27;s behaviour; he drank less, swore less, and became more tactful. Observers thought them parsimonious, and their lifestyle simple.

Adelaide soon became pregnant but in her seventh month of pregnancy she developed pleurisy and gave birth prematurely on 27 March 1819 at the Fürstenhof Palace in Hanover. Her daughter, Charlotte Augusta Louise, lived only a few hours. Another pregnancy in the same year caused William to move the household to England so his heir would be born on British soil; however Adelaide miscarried at Calais or Dunkirk during the journey on 5 September 1819. Back in London they moved into Clarence House but preferred to stay at Bushy House near Hampton Court, where William had already lived with Dorothea Jordan. Adelaide became pregnant again, and a second daughter, Elizabeth Georgiana Adelaide, was born on 10 December 1820 at St James&#x27;s Palace. Elizabeth seemed strong but died at less than three months old on 4 March 1821 of &quot;inflammation in the Bowels&quot;. Twin boys were stillborn on 8 April 1822 at Bushy Park and a possible brief pregnancy may have occurred in the same year. Ultimately William and Adelaide had no surviving children.

==Queen consort (1830–1837)==

At the time of their marriage, William was not heir-presumptive to the throne, but became so when his brother Frederick, Duke of York, died childless in 1827. Given the small likelihood of his older brothers producing heirs, and William&#x27;s relative youth and good health, it had long been considered extremely likely that he would become king in due course. In 1830, on the death of his elder brother, George IV, William acceded to the throne. He and Adelaide were crowned on 8 September 1831 at Westminster Abbey. William despised the ceremony and acted throughout, it is presumed deliberately, as if he was &quot;a character in a comic opera&quot;, making a mockery of what he thought to be a ridiculous charade. In contrast, Adelaide took the service very seriously and, among those attending, received praise for her &quot;dignity, repose and characteristic grace&quot;.

One of King William&#x27;s first acts was to confer the Rangership of Bushy Park (for 33 years held by himself) on Queen Adelaide, which allowed her to remain at Bushy House for her lifetime. In 1831 a dower annuity of £100,000 was set by Parliament to provide for her in the event of her husband predeceasing her. A large portion of her household income was given to several charitable causes. She refused to have women of questionable virtue attend her Court; the Clerk of the Privy Council, Charles Greville, wrote, &quot;The Queen is a prude and refuses to have the ladies come &quot;décolletées&quot; to her parties. George the 4th, who liked ample expanses of that kind, would not let them be covered.&quot; In any case, Adelaide was beloved by the British people for her piety, modesty, charity, and her tragic childbirth history.
Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent (later Queen Victoria) came to be acknowledged as William&#x27;s heir presumptive, as Adelaide had no further pregnancies. While there were rumours of pregnancies well into William&#x27;s reign (dismissed by the King as &quot;damned stuff&quot;), they seem to have been without basis. Adelaide treated the young Princess Victoria with kindness, despite her inability to produce an heir and the open hostility between her husband and Victoria&#x27;s mother, the Dowager Duchess of Kent. She and her husband were fond of their niece and wanted her to be closer to them, but their efforts were frustrated by the Duchess of Kent, who refused to acknowledge Adelaide&#x27;s precedence, left letters from Adelaide unanswered, and commandeered space in the royal stables and apartments for her use. William, aggrieved at what he took to be disrespect from the Duchess to his wife, bluntly announced in the presence of Adelaide, the Duchess, Victoria, and many guests, that the Duchess was &quot;incompetent to act with propriety&quot;, that he had been &quot;grossly and continually insulted by that person&quot;, and that he hoped to have the satisfaction of living beyond Victoria&#x27;s age of majority so that the Duchess of Kent would never be regent. Everyone was aghast at the vehemence of the speech, and all three ladies were deeply upset. The breach between the Duchess and the King and Queen was never fully healed, but Victoria always viewed both of them with kindness.

Adelaide attempted, perhaps unsuccessfully, to influence William politically. She never spoke about politics in public; however, she was strongly Tory. It is unclear how much of his attitudes during the passage of the Reform Act 1832 were due to her influence. The Press, the public, and courtiers assumed that she was agitating behind the scenes against reform, but she was careful to be non-committal in public. As a result of her alleged partiality, she became unpopular with reformers. False rumours circulated that she was having an affair with her Lord Chamberlain, the Tory Lord Howe, but almost everyone at court knew that Adelaide was inflexibly pious and was always faithful to her husband. The Whig prime minister, Lord Grey, had Lord Howe removed from Adelaide&#x27;s household, and the attempts to reinstate him after the Reform Bill had passed were not successful, as Lord Grey could not agree as to how independent Howe could be of the government. In October 1834, a great fire destroyed much of the Palace of Westminster, which Adelaide considered divine retribution for the vagaries of reform. When the King dismissed the Whig ministry of Lord Melbourne, &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper blamed the Queen&#x27;s influence, though she seems to have had very little to do with it. Influenced by her similarly reactionary brother-in-law, the Duke of Cumberland, however, she did write to her husband against reform of the Church of Ireland.

==Queen dowager (1837–1849)==

Queen Adelaide was dangerously ill in April 1837, at around the same time that she was present at her mother&#x27;s deathbed in Meiningen, but she recovered. By June, it became evident that the King was fatally ill himself. Adelaide stayed beside William&#x27;s deathbed devotedly, not going to bed herself for more than ten days. William IV died from heart failure in the early hours of the morning of 20 June 1837 at Windsor Castle, where he was buried. Victoria was proclaimed queen but subject to the rights of any issue that might be born to Adelaide on the remote chance that she was pregnant. 

The first queen dowager for over a century (Charles II&#x27;s widow, Catherine of Braganza, had died in 1705, and Mary of Modena, wife of the deposed James II, died in 1718), Adelaide survived her husband by twelve years.

In early October 1838, for health reasons, Adelaide travelled to Malta aboard HMS &quot;Hastings&quot;, stopping at Gibraltar on the way and staying on Malta for three months. Lacking a Protestant church in Malta, the queen dowager paid for the construction of St Paul&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral in Valletta. In the summer of 1844 she paid her last visit to her native country, visiting Altenstein Palace and Meiningen.

Adelaide had been given the use of Marlborough House, Pall Mall in 1831, and held it until her death in 1849. She also had the use of Bushy House and Bushy Park at Hampton Court. 

Suffering from chronic illness, she often moved her place of residence in a vain search for health, staying at the country houses of various British aristocracy. She became a tenant of William Ward and took up residence at his newly purchased house, Witley Court in Worcestershire, from 1842 until 1846. While at Witley Court she had two chaplains – Rev. John Ryle Wood, Canon of Worcester and Rev. Thomas Pearson, Rector of Great Witley. She financed the first village school in Great Witley.

From 1846 to 1848 Adelaide rented Cassiobury House from Lord Essex. During her time there she played host to Victoria and Albert. Within three years Adelaide had moved on again, renting Bentley Priory in Stanmore from Lord Abercorn. 

Semi-invalid by 1847, Adelaide was advised to try the climate of Madeira for the winter that year. She gave money to the poor of the island and paid for the construction of a road from Ribeiro Seco to Camara de Lobos.

Queen Adelaide&#x27;s last public appearance was to lay the foundation stone of the church of St John the Evangelist, Great Stanmore. She gave the font and when the church was completed after her death, the east window was dedicated to her memory. She died during the reign of her niece, Queen Victoria, on 2 December 1849 of natural causes at Bentley Priory in Middlesex. She was interred in the Royal Vault at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor. 

She wrote instructions for her funeral during an illness in 1841 at Sudbury Hall:

I die in all humility … we are alike before the throne of God, and I request therefore that my mortal remains be conveyed to the grave without pomp or state … to have as private and quiet a funeral as possible. I particularly desire not to be laid out in state … I die in peace and wish to be carried to the fount in peace, and free from the vanities and pomp of this world.

==Legacy==

Queen Adelaide&#x27;s name is probably best remembered in the Australian state of South Australia, founded during the brief reign of William IV. In 1836, the capital city of Adelaide was named after her. The Queen Adelaide Club for women is still active, and a bronze statue of Queen Adelaide stands in the foyer of the Town Hall. The Queen Adelaide Society was inaugurated in Adelaide in 1981 by the late Dorothy Howie with the twin objectives of promoting public awareness of Queen Adelaide and to provide an annual donation to a South Australian children&#x27;s charity.

There is a village named Queen Adelaide in Cambridgeshire, which takes its name from one of the many public houses named after her.

There are Adelaide Streets, Adelaide Avenues, and Adelaide Roads throughout the former empire. There is also Adelaide Hospital (now the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Tallaght) in Dublin, and an Adelaide railway station in Belfast. Australia has two Adelaide Rivers, in the Northern Territory and Tasmania, and an Adelaide Reef in Queensland. The town of Adelaide (originally Fort Adelaide) in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, as well as Sir Benjamin D&#x27;Urban&#x27;s short-lived colony in the same area, Queen Adelaide Province. Queen&#x27;s Park, Brighton is also named in her honour, as is Adelheidsdorf in Lower Saxony, Germany. The Citadel in Port Louis, capital of the Republic of Mauritius, is named Fort Adelaide, the building having been started during the reign of William in 1834. In 1832 Adelaide Township was surveyed in what became the western part of Middlesex County in Ontario (now part of the municipality of the Township of Adelaide-Metcalfe). There is a small group of islands in southern Chile named Queen Adelaide Archipelago and Adelaide Island in the British Antarctic Territory.

In honour of the Queen&#x27;s many visits, several places in Leicestershire were named after Queen Adelaide. They include Queen Street in Measham and the Queen Adelaide Inn (now demolished) in Appleby Magna. There is also the Queen Adelaide Oak in Bradgate Park (once home to Lady Jane Grey), under which Queen Adelaide had picnicked on venison and crayfish from the estate.

Asteroid 525 Adelaide is also named in her honour.

In 1849, there was a cholera epidemic in the East End of London. The following year, Queen Adelaide&#x27;s dispensary opened in Warner Place, Bethnal Green. It moved to William Street in 1866 and by 1899 was treating 10,000 medical and dental patients a year. 

In 1963 the funds that had set up the dispensary became Queen Adelaide&#x27;s Charity, which still operates today.

Queen Victoria&#x27;s firstborn child, Victoria Adelaide Mary Louise, was named after her great-aunt, who was also the child&#x27;s godmother.

==Cultural depictions==

Queen Adelaide was played by Harriet Walter in the 2009 film &quot;The Young Victoria&quot;, as a kindly but practical counsellor to the inexperienced queen. Delena Kidd portrayed her in the 2001 television serial &quot;Victoria &amp; Albert&quot;.

<text>Gaylord Anton Nelson (June 4, 1916July 3, 2005) was an American politician from Wisconsin who served as a United States senator and governor. He was a member of the Democratic Party and the founder of Earth Day, which launched a new wave of environmental activism.

==Early life and education==
Nelson was born in 1916 in Clear Lake, Wisconsin, the son of Mary (Bradt), a nurse, and Anton Nelson, a country doctor. He had Norwegian and Irish ancestry. He grew up and was educated in the local public schools. In 1939, he received a bachelor&#x27;s in political science at what is now San Jose State University in San Jose, California. In 1942, he received an LL.B. degree from the University of Wisconsin Law School in Madison and was admitted to the bar. He practiced as a lawyer before serving in the United States Army, during which time he saw action in the Okinawa campaign during World War II. He rose to the rank of first lieutenant.

==Politics==
In 1948, Nelson was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate. He remained there until 1958, when he was elected governor of Wisconsin. He served for four years as governor, in two two-year terms, before being elected to the United States Senate in 1962. He served three consecutive terms as a senator from 1963 to 1981. In 1963 he convinced President John F. Kennedy to take a national speaking tour to discuss conservation issues. Senator Nelson founded Earth Day, which began as a teach-in about environmental issues on April 22, 1970. During Congressional debate on air pollution and emissions from automobiles in 1970, Nelson also sponsored an amendment to the Clean Air Act which would have phased out gasoline-powered automobiles in favor of electric or steam-powered vehicles. The bill was defeated due to lobbying from automotive manufacturers.

During his 1968 re-election campaign, Nelson was praised by Vince Lombardi, the General Manager and former coach of the Green Bay Packers, as the &quot;nation&#x27;s #1 conservationist&quot; at a banquet in Oshkosh. Nelson&#x27;s campaign turned Lombardi&#x27;s banquet speech into a radio and television campaign commercial, infuriating Lombardi, the Wisconsin Republican Party, and Vince&#x27;s wife, Marie, who was a staunch Republican.

Although known primarily for his environmental work, Nelson also was a leading consumer advocate, strong supporter of civil rights and civil liberties, and one of the early outspoken opponents of the Vietnam War. In 1969, Nelson was one of four senators to introduce a bill to establish the Wisconsin Islands Wilderness.

In 1970, Nelson called for Congressional hearings on the safety of combined oral contraceptive pills, which were famously called &quot;The Nelson Pill Hearings.&quot; As a result of the hearings, side-effect disclosure in patient inserts was required for the pillthe first such disclosure for a pharmaceutical drug.

Nelson further attempted to overhaul how pharmaceuticals were marketed, proposing a bill that would require drug manufacturers to prove both the safety and efficacy of their marketed drugs in 1971. His office received a memorandum in 1975 stating that both Sominex and its competitor Compoz had been shown ineffective when compared to placebos, in spite of the US$34 million spent on sleeping aids in 1974.
Nelson was also a noted advocate of small business. While chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, he led successful efforts to authorize the first modern White House Conference on Small Business, create the system of Small Business Development Centers at U.S. universities, and improve the way that federal agencies regulate small businesses and other small entities, the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

In 1973, Nelson was one of the three senators who opposed the nomination of Gerald Ford to be Vice President. (The other two were Thomas Eagleton and William Hathaway.)

==Environmentalism==
After Nelson&#x27;s 1980 defeat for re-election, he became counselor for The Wilderness Society in January 1981. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in September 1995 in recognition of his environmental work.

Nelson was inducted into the Wisconsin Conservation Hall of Fame in 1986. The Wisconsin Conservation Hall of fame is located at the Schmeeckle Reserve Visitor Center in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. The visitor center is maintained by the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point.

Nelson viewed the stabilization of the nation&#x27;s population as an important aspect of environmentalism. In his words:

The bigger the population gets, the more serious the problems become ... We have to address the population issue. The United Nations, with the U.S. supporting it, took the position in Cairo in 1994 that every country was responsible for stabilizing its own population. It can be done. But in this country, it&#x27;s phony to say &quot;I&#x27;m for the environment but not for limiting immigration.&quot;

He also rejected the suggestion that economic development should take precedence over environmental protection:

The economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment, not the other way around.

In 2002, Nelson appeared on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; as a contestant, with his founding of Earth Day highlighted.

==Death and legacy==
Nelson died of cardiovascular failure at age 89 on July 3, 2005.

The Gaylord Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies (or Nelson Institute) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison is named after him in recognition of his love for nature. In addition, the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore –comprising more than 80% of the land area of the park – was named after him in honor of his efforts to have the park created. Governor Nelson State Park near Waunakee, Wisconsin, is also named after him. The elementary school in Clear Lake, Wisconsin is named Gaylord A. Nelson Educational Center.

<doc id="208956" wikidata="Q324588" url="?curid=208956" title="Joe Brown (musician)">
<text>Joseph Roger Brown (born 13 May 1941) is an English musician. As a rock and roll singer and guitarist, he has performed for more than six decades. He was a stage and television performer in the late 1950s and has primarily been a recording star since the early 1960s. He has made six films, presented specialist radio series for BBC Radio 2, appeared on the West End stage alongside Dame Anna Neagle and has written an autobiography. In recent years he has again concentrated on recording and performing music, playing two tours of around 100 shows every year and releasing an album almost every year.

Described by the &quot;Guinness Book of British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot; as a &quot;chirpy Cockney&quot; (although he was born in Lincolnshire), Brown was one of the original artists managed by the early rock impresario and manager Larry Parnes. He is highly regarded in the music business as a &quot;musician&#x27;s musician&quot; who &quot;commands respect and admiration from a wide spectrum of artists&quot;.

==Career==
Brown was born in Swarby, Lincolnshire. His family moved to London when he was two and ran the Sultan public house in Grange Road, Plaistow, then in Essex, now part of the London Borough of Newham. In 1956, Brown formed a skiffle group, The Spacemen, which lasted until the skiffle movement faded towards the end of the 1950s. He worked for British Railways at their Plaistow Locomotive works for two years in the late 1950s, becoming a steam locomotive fireman. He left the job because &quot;the smell of the diesels drove me out when they took over from steam&quot;.

In 1958, Brown was spotted by television producer Jack Good who hired him as lead guitarist in the orchestra of his new TV series, &quot;Boy Meets Girls&quot;. During this period, he backed a number of US musicians such as Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran on their UK tours.

===1960s===
Brown signed a management agreement with Larry Parnes. Parnes attempted to change Brown&#x27;s stage name to &#x27;Elmer Twitch&#x27;, a story which Brown still refers to on occasion during his live sets. Brown signed to Decca Records. He charted with &quot;The Darktown Strutters&#x27; Ball&quot; in 1960, and had UK Top 10 hits on the Piccadilly label in 1962–63 with &quot;A Picture of You&quot;, which reached number one on the NME charts (the main chart of the day); &quot;It Only Took A Minute&quot;, and &quot;That&#x27;s What Love Will Do&quot;. Piccadilly&#x27;s release of Brown&#x27;s &quot;Crazy Mixed Up Kid&quot; in April 1961 was the label&#x27;s first single. Brown&#x27;s recording band was a collection of session musicians, and was named the Bruvvers by Jack Good, to give Brown the identity of having his own backing band for record releases. It was in 1962, when he needed a band to tour with him, that &#x27;Joe Brown and the Bruvvers&#x27; was cemented, containing two members of the Spacemen, brothers Tony and Pete Oakman, who had also remained with him in the &quot;Boy Meets Girls&quot; band.

Brown was voted &#x27;Top UK Vocal Personality&#x27; in the 1962 &quot;NME&quot; magazine poll. During the 1960s he appeared in a number of films, pantomime and stage musicals. In December 1963, the film &quot;What a Crazy World&quot;, based on a stage play, starring Brown and Marty Wilde among others, had its world premiere in London. Brown also starred in the hit musical &quot;Charlie Girl&quot; in the West End between 1965 and 1968; and in the musical comedy film &quot;Three Hats for Lisa&quot; in 1965 with Una Stubbs, Sophie Hardy and Sid James. He also made a cameo appearance as himself in the 1964 film &quot;The Beauty Jungle&quot;, and presented the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Joe &amp; Co&quot; on BBC Television.

=== 1970s and after ===
In 1972, he formed another band, &quot;Brown&#x27;s Home Brew&quot;, which played rock and roll, country and gospel music and featured his wife, Vicki Brown, and Pete Oakman from the Bruvvers. This eclectic collection of musical styles, together with his hits, became the basis of his live sets ever since.

In the 1980s, Brown presented a daytime quiz show on Granada TV called &quot;Square One&quot;; its success led him to recording a pilot for the prime time game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; but ATV selected Leslie Crowther for the full-time presenting role when the series launched.

He also hosted &quot;Show Me&quot;, an early evening game show produced by Anglia Television and aired on ITV for one series in 1987, and made a brief appearance as Dudley, a crooked club owner, in the 1986 film &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, opposite Bob Hoskins.

George Harrison was best man at Brown&#x27;s second wedding in 2000; Brown had appeared on two songs on Harrison&#x27;s album &quot;Gone Troppo&quot;, and also was featured on a track on Harrison&#x27;s last album, &quot;Brainwashed&quot;. Following Harrison&#x27;s death from lung cancer on 29 November 2001, Brown appeared with his group at the tribute concert Concert for George, held on the first anniversary of his death. Brown played guitar whilst singing &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;, mandolin on &quot;That&#x27;s The Way It Goes,&quot; and ukulele on the closing number, &quot;I&#x27;ll See You in My Dreams&quot;.

Brown still performs and makes occasional television appearances. In 2005, he co-wrote a musical, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Rock Me Daddio&quot;, with songwriter Roger Cook, while in December 2006, he was one of three guest hosts of &quot;Sounds of the &#x27;60s&quot; on BBC Radio 2 during the absence of host Brian Matthew, having already presented two series on rock and roll for the same station.

In 2008, Brown&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebrations included a UK gold album for sales over 100,000 copies of &quot;Joe Brown – The Very Best Of&quot;, a 37-date spring tour, an all-star concert at the Royal Albert Hall with Mark Knopfler, Jools Holland, Dennis Locorriere, Dave Edmunds, Sam Brown, Chas &amp; Dave and others, and a 36-date autumn-winter tour.

His album &quot;More of the Truth&quot; was released in the UK on 13 October 2008 and, in 2009, the US musical instrument manufacturer Kala launched a series of &#x27;Joe Brown&#x27; ukuleles. At the &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine&#x27;s awards in London on 11 June 2009, Brown was presented with the lifetime award for outstanding contribution to music after 51 years&#x27; recording.

In late 2010, Brown was asked by Rick Parfitt of Status Quo to support them for the arena section (nine shows) of their UK tour in late 2010, and he continued to tour throughout 2011. A triple DVD and CD set of the latter tour was released of his show at the Liverpool Philharmonic.

In November 2011 &quot;Mojo&quot;″s album &quot;Harrison Covered&quot;, released to mark the tenth anniversary of George Harrison&#x27;s death, included Brown&#x27;s recording of the Harrison&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s the Way It Goes&quot;.

in 2014 Brown pulled out of the Village Pump Folk Festival for medical reasons. Due to headline the Friday night of the event taking place from 25 July, he was replaced by Peatbog Faeries.

== Honours ==
Brown was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to music in the 2009 Birthday Honours.

== Personal life ==
Brown married Victoria Mary Haseman, a singer with both the Vernons Girls and the Breakaways, who then became known as Vicki Brown. Latterly a session singer, she died of cancer in 1991. Their daughter, Sam Brown, is also a singer. Their son, Pete Brown, is a record producer, who produced all but one of Brown&#x27;s nine most recent albums; Pete tours with his father. In 2000, Joe Brown married Manon Pearcey, former partner of the former Small Faces singer Steve Marriott.

<doc id="208958" wikidata="Q1480896" url="?curid=208958" title="The Right Honourable">
<text>The Right Honourable (abbreviation: The Rt Hon. or variations) is an honorific style traditionally applied to certain persons and collective bodies in the United Kingdom, the former British Empire, and the Commonwealth of Nations. The term is predominantly used today as a style associated with the holding of certain senior public offices in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and, to a lesser extent, Australia.

&quot;Right&quot; in this context is an adverb meaning &#x27;very&#x27; or &#x27;fully&#x27;. Grammatically, &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; is an adjectival phrase which gives information about a person. As such, it is not considered correct to apply it in direct address, nor to use it on its own as a title in place of a name; but rather it is used in the third person along with a name or noun to be modified.

&quot;Right&quot; may be abbreviated to &quot;Rt&quot;, and &quot;Honourable&quot; to &quot;Hon.&quot;, or both. &quot;The&quot; is sometimes dropped in written abbreviated form, but is always pronounced.

==Countries with common or current usage==

===United Kingdom===

====Entitlement====



According to the British government, the following persons are entitled to be styled &quot;Right Honourable&quot;:

; Members of the Privy Council
: The Privy Council is notionally the body of formal advisors to the sovereign. Members of the Cabinet, senior politicians, and some few other officials are appointed as members for life, and are personally entitled to be styled &quot;Right Honourable&quot; thereafter.
; Peers below the rank of marquess
: Earls and countesses, viscounts and viscountesses and barons and baronesses who hold a substantive title (whether hereditary or for life) are personally entitled to the style &quot;Right Honourable&quot;. A peer&#x27;s wife or widow also has a legal right to the style of her husband.
; The lord mayors and lord provosts of certain cities (ex officio)
: The lord mayors of London, Cardiff, Belfast, Bristol and York and the lord provosts of Edinburgh and Glasgow are styled &quot;Right Honourable&quot; while in office. But the title is attached to the office, not to the name of the person.

====Privy counsellors====

Privy counsellors are appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the prime minister, and remain members for life unless they resign or are expelled. In practice, membership of the privy council is granted to:

* all members of the Cabinet (itself technically a committee of the Privy Council), and certain other senior ministers in the government;
* senior members of the Shadow Cabinet, the leaders of the major political parties in parliament, and the Speaker of the House of Commons;
* the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the leader of the largest opposition party in the Scottish Parliament;
* the two archbishops of the Church of England, who sit in the House of Lords ex officio;
* senior judges, who fulfil the judicial functions of the Privy Council;
* senior representatives of the Commonwealth nations; and
* senior members of the royal family.

A large proportion of the former and current prominent politicians of the United Kingdom are thus entitled to be styled &quot;Right Honourable&quot;.

No new appointments have been made to the Privy Council of Northern Ireland since 1971, but surviving appointed members remain entitled to the style. Non-British Commonwealth-citizen judges appointed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council are also entitled to the style, although the appellation may be ignored in the judge&#x27;s home country.

It is the current practice of the House of Lords and the College of Arms to apply the style &quot;Right Honourable&quot; to privy counsellors only.

====Peers====

All holders of a substantive peerage below the rank of marquess are entitled to be styled &quot;Right Honourable&quot;, as are their wives and widows. However, a peer&#x27;s heir who uses a courtesy title is not accorded the corresponding style. Peers above the rank of earl are entitled to different styles: dukes and duchesses are styled &quot;The Most Noble&quot; or &quot;His&quot; or &quot;Her Grace&quot;, and marquesses and marchionesses are styled as &quot;The Most Honourable&quot;.

In order to differentiate peers who are also members of the Privy Council—and therefore entitled to a style in both capacities—from peers who are not, the post-nominal letters &quot;&quot; can be used to identify the privy counsellors. This applies to peers of all rank, as a holder of a dukedom or marquessate who becomes a Privy Counsellor retains their higher style and so could not be identified without the letters. In practice, in contexts where there might be confusion, official publications use the style &quot;Right Honourable&quot; exclusively to identify privy counsellors.

====Lord mayors, lord provosts and other officers====

The lord mayors of London, Cardiff, Belfast and York; and the lord provosts of Edinburgh and Glasgow are all entitled to be styled &quot;Right Honourable&quot; while in office. The lord mayors of Belfast and Cardiff are so entitled by an explicit grant from the sovereign, and the others through ancient custom. The style is used with the name of the office, not the personal name of the office-holder, e.g. &quot;The Right Honourable Lord Mayor of London&quot; or &quot;The Right Honourable the Lord Provost of the City of Edinburgh&quot;.

Other lord mayors may be styled &quot;Right Worshipful&quot;, and other lord provosts do not use a style. By the 1920s, a number of city mayors, including the Lord Mayor of Leeds, were unofficially using the style &quot;Right Honourable&quot;, and the matter was consequently raised in parliament. The Lord Mayor of Bristol at present still uses the style &quot;Right Honourable&quot;, without official permission. In guidance issued in June 2003, the Crown Office recommended that the lord provosts of Aberdeen and Dundee be styled &quot;Right Honourable&quot; in the same manner as those of Edinburgh and Glasgow.

The Chairman of the London County Council (LCC) was granted the style in 1935 as part of the celebrations of the silver jubilee of King George V. The Chairman of the Greater London Council (GLC), the body that replaced the LCC in 1965, was similarly granted the style until the GLC was abolished in 1986.

&quot;Right Honourable&quot; is also used as a style by the Lord Lyon King of Arms in office, preceding his title rather than his personal name, as with other applications ex officio.

====In the House of Commons====

In the chamber of the House of Commons, members are not permitted to address each other directly, nor to name other members, but must instead address the speaker and refer to other members indirectly. This practice is intended to enforce a polite tone to maintain order and good honour. Only the occupant of the Chair addresses Members by name. Members generally refer to one another as &quot;my honourable friend&quot; if in the same party, and &quot;the honourable gentleman/lady/member&quot; otherwise. If needed, constituencies (&quot;the honourable member for...&quot;) or ministerial offices (e.g. &quot;my right honourable friend the Prime Minister&quot;) can be used for clarity.

Referring to one another as &quot;honourable&quot; is merely a courtesy used within the House, and is not a style used outside the chamber. However, when a member is in fact entitled to be styled &quot;Right Honourable&quot; (in practice always through membership of the Privy Council), they are referred to as such in the chamber. Further embellishments are traditionally applied to clergy (&quot;reverend&quot;), military officers (&quot;gallant&quot;) and barristers (&quot;learned&quot;), a practice recommended to be abolished following a 2010 report of the Modernisation Committee but in practice continued. In summary:
* &quot;Honourable&quot; is used for members who are not privy counsellors.
* &quot;Right honourable&quot; is used for members who are privy counsellors.
* &quot;(Right) honourable and reverend&quot; may be used for clergy.
* &quot;(Right) honourable and gallant&quot; may be used for military officers.
* &quot;(Right) honourable and learned&quot; may be used for barristers.

====Collective entities====

&quot;Right Honourable&quot; is added as a prefix to the name of various collective entities, including:
* &quot;The Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Assembled&quot;, i.e. the House of Lords
* &quot;The Right Honourable the Lords of the Privy Council&quot;, i.e. the Privy Council
* &quot;The Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty&quot;, i.e. the former Board of Admiralty

===Canada===
In Canada, occupants of only the three most senior public offices are styled as &quot;Right Honourable&quot; ( in French). Formerly, this was by virtue of their appointment to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. However, Canadian appointments to the British Privy Council were ended by the government of Lester Pearson. Currently, individuals who hold, or have held, one of the following offices are awarded the style of &quot;Right Honourable&quot; for life:

* Governor General of Canada
* Prime Minister of Canada
* Chief Justice of Canada

&quot;The Right Honourable&quot; is not to be confused with &quot;His&quot; or &quot;Her Excellency&quot;, used by governors general during their term of office, or &quot;The Honourable&quot;, used only while in office (except in Nova Scotia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, where honorary members of the Executive Council enjoy the title permanently) by provincial premiers and cabinet ministers, and for life by senators and members of the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada (chiefly cabinet ministers, as well as other figures such as party leaders or provincial premiers who may be appointed from time to time).

The title may also be granted for life by the Governor General to eminent Canadians who have not held any of the offices that would otherwise entitle them to the style. This has been done on two occasions: to eight prominent political figures to mark the 125th anniversary of Canadian Confederation in 1992, and to longtime Member of Parliament Herb Gray upon his retirement in 2002.

Over the years, a number of prominent Canadians became members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and thus were entitled to use the style &quot;Right Honourable&quot;, either because of their services in Britain (e.g. serving as envoys to London) or as members of the Imperial War Cabinet, or due to their prominence in the Canadian Cabinet. These included all but three of Canada&#x27;s early prime ministers (Alexander Mackenzie, John Abbott, and Mackenzie Bowell), who governed before the title was used domestically.

===New Zealand===

Previously in New Zealand the prime minister and some other senior cabinet ministers were customarily appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and thus styled &quot;Right Honourable&quot;.

Helen Clark did not recommend the appointment of any new privy counsellors during her tenure as Prime Minister, from 1999 to 2008. In 2009 it was announced that her successor, John Key, had decided not to make any further recommendations to the Crown for appointments to the Privy Council.

In August 2010, the Queen of New Zealand announced that, with immediate effect, individuals who hold, and those persons who after the date of the signing of these rules are appointed to, the following offices are awarded the style &quot;Right Honourable&quot; for life:
* the Governor-General of New Zealand
* the Prime Minister of New Zealand
* the Chief Justice of New Zealand
* the Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives

This change was made because the practice of appointing New Zealanders to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom had ceased. However, the change had little immediate effect, as all but two of the holders or living former holders of the offices granted the style had already been appointed to the Privy Council.

The living New Zealanders holding the style &quot;Right Honourable&quot; as a result of membership of the Privy Council are:
* Sir Geoffrey Winston Russell Palmer (1985) – prime minister
* Helen Elizabeth Clark (1990) – prime minister
* James Brendan Bolger (1991) – prime minister
* Sir Donald Charles McKinnon (1992) – deputy prime minister
* Sir William Francis Birch (1992) – cabinet minister
* Sir John Steele Henry (1996) – court of appeal justice
* Sir Edmund Walter Thomas (1996) – supreme court justice
* Dame Jennifer Mary Shipley (1998) – prime minister
* Winston Raymond Peters (1998) – deputy prime minister
* Sir Douglas Arthur Montrose Graham (1998) – cabinet minister
* Sir Kenneth James Keith (1998) – court of appeal justice
* Sir Peter Blanchard (1998) – supreme court justice
* Sir Andrew Patrick Charles Tipping (1998) – supreme court justice
* Wyatt Beetham Creech (1998) – deputy prime minister
* Dame Sian Seerpoohi Elias (1999) – chief justice
* Simon David Upton (1999) – cabinet minister

The living New Zealanders holding the style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life as a result of the 2010 changes are:
===East Africa===

During the periods of its existence, the Prime Minister of Kenya post was styled &quot;Right Honourable&quot;. In post-independence Kenya two people have been styled with the &quot;right honorable&quot; title. The country&#x27;s founding president Jomo Kenyatta who was the first prime minister of Kenya and Raila Amolo Odinga, who served as the country&#x27;s second prime minister between 2008 and 2013. Raila Odinga also known as Baba (Political father and Enigma) is a towering icon in Africa, well known for his Pan-Africanism and championing for good governance. The prime ministers of Namibia and Uganda are both currently styled with the same honorific. The speaker and deputy speaker of the Parliament of Uganda are also entitled to the style.

===Caribbean===

The prime ministers of Barbados, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago are styled as &quot;Right Honourable&quot;. The West Indies Federation prime minister was also styled as such during that office&#x27;s short existence.

=== Malaysia ===
In Malaysia, only the Prime Minister, his or her deputy, four of judges of the Federal Court and MPs who are titled Tun are styled as &quot;Right Honourable&quot; (Malay: Yang Amat Berhormat, Yang Amat Arif for judges) at the federal level. For the state level, all the Menteris Besar, Chief Ministers and Premier along with their deputies are also styled &quot;Right Honourable&quot;.

===Nepal===

In Nepal, the president, vice president speaker of the House of Representatives, prime minister and chief justice are formally styled &quot;Right Honourable&quot; (). Ministers, members of parliament (Lower and Upper Houses and provincial parliaments) and Chief ministers of provinces are styled &quot;Honourable&quot; only. It is usually joked during informal discussions about the use of the word &quot;Honourable&quot; to differentiate senior and less senior government dignitories. It can also be spelled in English as &quot;The Rt. Hon’ble&quot;.

===South Korea===
In South Korea, the President, Prime Minister, Speaker of the National Assembly and Chief Justice can use the &quot;Right Honourable&quot; style.

==Countries with rare or historic usage==

===Australia===

In Australia, the lord mayors of Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney are entitled to be styled &quot;Right Honourable&quot; while in office.

Historically, a number of Australians were entitled to the style as members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Appointment to the Australian equivalent of the Privy Council, the Federal Executive Council, does not entitle a person to the style. Typical appointees to the Imperial Privy Council included senior politicians and judges at state and federal level. Malcolm Fraser in 1976 was the most recent prime minister to accept appointment to the Privy Council and thus to be styled &quot;Right Honourable&quot;. Of his 21 predecessors, only four were not members of the Privy Council – Alfred Deakin (declined appointment), Chris Watson (never offered), Arthur Fadden (accepted after leaving office), and Gough Whitlam (declined appointment). The last Governor-General to be entitled to the style was Sir Ninian Stephen, who left office in 1988. The last active politician to be entitled to the style was Ian Sinclair, who retired in 1998. The few Australian recipients of British peerages were also entitled to the style.

Present-day Australian governments no longer recommend Australians for elevation to the peerage or appointment to the Privy Council. However, some present-day Australian citizens either hold hereditary peerages (e.g. Malcolm Murray, 12th Earl of Dunmore).

===Ireland===

Members of the Privy Council of Ireland were entitled to be styled &quot;Right Honourable&quot;, even after the Privy Council ceased to have any functions or to meet on the creation of the Irish Free State in December 1922. Nevertheless, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, like some of his counterparts in Great Britain, retained the use of the honorific style as a result of its having been conferred separately by legislation; in 2001 it was removed, as a consequence of local government law reform.

===Sri Lanka===

In Sri Lanka (formerly known as Ceylon) the British practice was followed with Ceylonese members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom were styled &quot;Right Honourable&quot; and were referred to as in Sinhala. Ceylonese appointees to the privy council included D. S. Senanayake and Sir John Kotelawala.

<text>Altoids are a brand of mints, sold primarily in distinctive metal tins. The brand was created by the London-based Smith &amp; Company in the 1780s, and became part of the Callard &amp; Bowser company in the 19th century. Their advertising slogan is &quot;The Original Celebrated Curiously Strong Mints&quot;, referring to the high concentration of peppermint oil used in the original flavour lozenge. The mints were originally conceived as a lozenge intended to relieve intestinal discomfort.

== Marketing ==
Callard &amp; Bowser-Suchard once manufactured Altoids at a plant in Bridgend, Wales, but has since moved production to a Mars Wrigley plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States, in order to manufacture the products closer to where they are primarily marketed. They were marketed for a brief period in the 1990s under the &quot;Nuttall&#x27;s&quot; brand when Callard and Bowser was under the ownership of Terry&#x27;s.

==Flavours and varieties==
===Mints===
, Altoids mints are available in five flavours, namely peppermint, wintergreen, spearmint, cinnamon, and strawberry. &quot;Sugar-Free Smalls&quot;, tiny square mints sweetened with sorbitol and sucralose, are also available in peppermint, wintergreen, and cinnamon. In 2007, dark chocolate-dipped mints were introduced in three flavours, namely peppermint, cinnamon and ginger and in 2008, dark chocolate-dipped mints were introduced in crème de menthe. The chocolate-dipped varieties were discontinued in 2010. Also historically made, but no longer available, were liquorice, cool honey, and (non-chocolate dipped) ginger and crème de menthe varieties. Circa early 2011, Altoids altered the ingredients of their wintergreen mints, adding blue food colouring. Altoid mints other than those labelled &quot;sugar-free smalls&quot; contain gelatin.

===Sours===
Sour hard candies in round tins were introduced in 2001 but were discontinued in 2010 due to low sales. Flavours included raspberry, citrus, apple, tangerine, and mango. Limited edition passion fruit sours were also released around Valentine&#x27;s Day in 2005 in a larger 2.3 oz tin instead of the standard 1.76 oz sours tins that had been released up until then.

===Gum===
The sugar-free chewing gum, introduced in 2003, was made in the United States. Flavors include peppermint, cinnamon, spearmint, wintergreen and two sour flavours, cherry and apple. The gum has not been seen in stock in US stores since January 2010 and has been discontinued.

===Altoids Strips===
In 2003, breath strips in peppermint and cinnamon flavors were introduced. They were discontinued.

===Altoids Arctic===
In 2014, Eclipse Mints, another Wrigley product, were rebranded as Altoids Arctic, with the tin remaining identical save for labelling. The rebranded mints were released in only Peppermint, Wintergreen, and Strawberry, doing away with the wider varieties of Eclipse such as Cinnamon, Winterfrost, and several other flavors, as well as the chewable. As before, each tin contains 1.2 oz (34g), or about 50 mints.

==Tins==

The distinctive tins in which Altoids mints are packaged are often reused for other purposes. They have long been used as containers for household items like paper clips, coins, sewing materials and other small items. Many people make &quot;Altoids Wallets&quot; out of the tins, decorating the interior to add personalization.

Altoids tins have also been popular with outdoor enthusiasts for many years as first-aid or mini survival kit containers. A name for these kits is &quot;Bug-Out Altoids Tins&quot;, or &quot;BOATs&quot;.

The tins are sometimes used to house electronics projects. BeagleBone, a single-board computer made by Texas Instruments, is deliberately shaped with rounded corners to fit inside the tin.

A retrocomputing hobbyist computer, the Membership Card is a series of 1802/8080/Z80 based microcomputer kits, designed to fit in an Altoids tin, and CMoy pocket headphone amplifiers often use the containers as an enclosure.

The mintyPi is a kit that uses an Altoids tin to house a portable retro gaming machine.

==Altoids Award==
At the grand opening of The New Museum of Contemporary Art in 2007, Altoids announced the biennial Altoids Award, in which cash prizes of are awarded to four artists from around the US. Winners have their art exhibited at the museum after the rigorous selection process is completed. The first winners were chosen by Paul McCarthy, Cindy Sherman and Rirkrit Tiravanija.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance was awarded between 1965 and 2011. The award has had several minor name changes:

*From 1965 to 1967 the award was known as Best Country &amp; Western Vocal Performance - Male
*In 1968 it was awarded as Best Country &amp; Western Solo Vocal Performance, Male 
*From 1969 to 1994 it was awarded as Best Country Vocal Performance, Male
*From 1995 to 2011 it was awarded as Best Male Country Vocal Performance

The award was discontinued after the 2011 awards season in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. From 2012, all solo performances (male, female and instrumental) in the country category will be shifted to the newly formed [[Best Country Solo Performance]] category.

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year.

<text>Ian Watt (9 March 1917 – 13 December 1999) was a literary critic, literary historian and professor of English at Stanford University. 

==Biography==
Born 9 March 1917, in Windermere, Westmorland, in England, Watt was educated at the Dover County School for Boys and at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he earned first-class honours in English.

Watt joined the British Army at the age of 22 and served with distinction in the Second World War as an infantry lieutenant from 1939 to 1946. He was wounded in the Battle of Singapore in February 1942 and listed as &quot;missing, presumed killed in action&quot;.

He had been taken prisoner by the Japanese and remained at the Changi Prison until 1945, working with other prisoners on the construction of the Burma Railway which crossed Thailand, a feat that inspired the Pierre Boulle book &quot;The Bridge over the River Kwai&quot;, and the film adaptation, &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; by David Lean. Watt criticised both the book and the film for the liberties they took with the historical details of the prisoner of war experience and, more subtly, their refusal to acknowledge the moral complexities of the situation. More than 12,000 prisoners died during the building of the railway, most of them from disease, and Watt was critically ill from malnutrition for several years. &quot;There was a period when I expected to die&quot;, Watt told &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; in a 1979 interview. &quot;But I didn&#x27;t know how sick I was until they gave me some of the vitamin pills that had just come into the camp. I remember being very surprised that I was considered sick enough to receive vitamins.&quot;

Watt died in Menlo Park, California, after a long illness and a spell in a nursing home.

==Literary criticism==
A key element Watt explores is the decline in importance of the philosophy of classical antiquity, with its various strains of idealistic thought that viewed human experience as composed of universal Platonic &quot;forms&quot; with an innate perfection. Such a view of life and philosophy dominated writers from ancient times to the Renaissance, resulting in classical poetic forms and genres with essentially flat plots and characters. (Russian theorist Mikhail Bakhtin has written that such literature can literally be read front to back, or back to front, with no significant difference in effect.) These philosophical beliefs began to be replaced perhaps in the later Renaissance, into the Enlightenment, and, most importantly, in the early 18th century. The importance of rationalist philosophers such as John Locke, Descartes, Spinoza, and many others who followed them, and the scientific, social and economic developments of this period, began to have ever greater impact. In place of the older classical idealism, a realistic, pragmatic, empirical understanding of life and human behaviour, which recognised human individuality and conscious experience, began to emerge. This was reflected in the novels of Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, and Henry Fielding, who began to write about unique individual lives and experiences lived in realistic, intersubjective (the term is Husserl&#x27;s), environments. Watt wrote that the novel form&#x27;s &quot;primary criterion was truth to individual experience&quot;. This focus on individual experience characterises the novel in Wattian terms.

A second major trend that Watt studies is the &quot;rise of the reading public&quot; and the growth of professional publishing during this period. Publishers at this time &quot;occupied a strategic position between author and printer, and between both of these and the public&quot;. The growth of profit concerns impelled publishers to reach out to a wider reading public. In addition the specialisation of professions, which narrowed the everyday experiences of this new reading public, created a market for portrayals of a greater array of different classes, peoples, ages, sexes, etc. (Writing intended for women, and writing by women, is an important trend of 18th century literature.) Such detailed writings of the experiences of different people can be seen in the novels Watt examines, and had rarely been seen before. Watt presents many statistical details in this section of the book in support of his argument.

== Impact and significance ==
His &quot;The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding&quot; (1957) is an important work in the history of academic literary criticism. &quot;The Rise of the Novel&quot; is considered by many contemporary literary scholars as the seminal work on the origins of the novel, and an important study of literary realism. The book traces the rise of the modern novel to philosophical, economic and social trends and conditions that become prominent in the early 18th century. He is the subject of an intellectual biography by Marina MacKay, &quot;Ian Watt: The Novel and the Wartime Critic&quot; (2018).

<doc id="208979" wikidata="Q1067610" url="?curid=208979" title="Excellency">
<text>Excellency is an honorific style given to certain high-level officers of a sovereign state, officials of an international organization, or members of an aristocracy. Once entitled to the title &quot;Excellency&quot;, the holder usually retains the right to that courtesy throughout their lifetime, although in some cases the title is attached to a particular office and is held only during tenure of that office.

Generally people addressed as &quot;Excellency&quot; are heads of state, heads of government, governors, ambassadors, Roman Catholic bishops, high-ranking ecclesiastics, and others holding equivalent rank, such as heads of international organizations. Members of royal families generally have distinct addresses such as Majesty, Highness, etc..

While not a title of office itself, the honorific &quot;Excellency&quot; precedes various titles held by the holder, both in speech and in writing. In reference to such an official, it takes the form &quot;His&quot; or &quot;Her Excellency&quot;; in direct address, &quot;Your Excellency&quot;, or, less formally, &quot;Excellency&quot;.
The abbreviation HE is often used instead of &quot;His/Her Excellency&quot;; alternatively it may stand for &quot;His Eminence&quot;.

== Government ==
=== Heads of state and government ===
In most republican nation states, the head of state is formally referred to as &quot;His&quot; or &quot;Her Excellency&quot;.

If a republic has a separate head of government, that official is almost always addressed as &quot;Excellency&quot; as well. If the nation is a monarchy, however, the customs may vary. For example, in the case of Australia, all ambassadors, high commissioners, state governors and the governor-general and their spouses are entitled to the use of Excellency.

Governors of colonies in the British Empire were entitled to be addressed as &quot;Excellency&quot; and this remains the position for the governors of what are now known as British Overseas Territories.

=== International diplomacy ===
In various international organizations, notably the UN and its agencies, &quot;Excellency&quot; is used as a generic form of address for all republican heads of state and heads of government. It is often granted to the organization&#x27;s head as well, and to those chiefs of UN diplomatic missions, such as Resident Coordinators (who are the designated representatives of the secretary-general), who are accredited at the head of state level (like an ambassador), or at the lower head of government level.

=== International judiciary ===
Judges of the International Court of Justice also enjoy the style of &quot;Excellency&quot;.

== Monarchy ==
=== Royalty ===
In some monarchies the husbands, wives, or children of a royal prince or princess, who do not possess a princely title themselves, may be entitled to the style. For example, in Spain spouses or children of a born &quot;infante&quot; or &quot;infanta&quot; are addressed as &quot;Excellency&quot;, if not accorded a higher style.

Former members of a royal house or family, who have forfeited a royal title, may be awarded the style afterwards. Examples are former husbands or wives of a royal prince or princess, including Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg, following her divorce from Prince Joachim of Denmark. Likewise, Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg, who lost his succession rights to the Swedish throne and discontinued use of his royal titles in 1946 when he married the commoner Elin Kerstin Margaretha Wijkmark, was accorded the style.

In some emirates, such as Kuwait and Qatar, the Emir, heir apparent and prime minister are called &quot;His Highness&quot;. Their children are styled with &quot;His/Her Excellency&quot; unless they possess a higher honorific.

=== Nobility ===
In Spain members of the high nobility, holding the dignity of grandee, are referred to as &quot;The Most Excellent Lord/Lady&quot;.

In Denmark, some counts (&quot;lensgrever&quot;), historically those related by blood or marriage to the Danish monarch, who have entered a morganatic marriage or otherwise left the Royal Family have the right to be styled as &quot;Your Excellency&quot;, e.g., the Counts of Danneskiold-Samsøe, some of the counts of Rosenborg and the Countess of Frederiksborg (&quot;ad personam&quot;).

In the subnational monarchy Sultanate of Sulu, senior nobility and holders of royal offices that are granted the title of Datu Sadja are referred to as &quot;His/Her Excellency.&quot;

=== Knights ===
&quot;Excellency&quot; can also attach to a prestigious quality, notably in an order of knighthood. For example, in the Empire of Brazil, it was attached to the highest classes, each time called &quot;Grand Cross&quot;, of all three imperial orders: Imperial Order of Pedro I, Imperial Order of the Southern Cross with the military honours of a Lieutenant general and Order of the Rose.

Knights of the Collar and Knights Grand Cross of the Spanish Orders of Chivalry, such as the Order of Charles III, Order of Isabella the Catholic, Order of Civil Merit, Order of Alfonso X the Wise, Royal Order of Sports Merit, Civil Order of Health, as well as recipients of the Grand Cross of Military, Naval, and Aeronautical Merit are addressed as such. Furthermore, Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, Order of Saint Gregory the Great, and the Order of St. Sylvester of the Holy See, and Grand Cross of The Lion, Crested Crane, Crown, and The Drum of Rwanda, and Knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece, and Knights Grand Cross of several other orders of high prestige, are often addressed as &quot;Excellency&quot;.

== Ecclesiastical use ==
By a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Ceremonial of 31 December 1930 the Holy See granted bishops of the Catholic Church the title of &quot;Most Reverend Excellency&quot; or &quot;Excellentia Reverendissima&quot; in Latin. In the years following the First World War, the ambassadorial title of &quot;Excellency&quot;, previously given to nuncios, had already begun to be used by other Catholic bishops. The adjective &quot;Most Reverend&quot; was intended to distinguish the religious title from that of &quot;Excellency&quot; given to civil officials.

The instruction &quot;Ut sive sollicite&quot; of the Holy See&#x27;s Secretariat of State, dated 28 March 1969, made the addition of &quot;Most Reverend&quot; optional, sanctioning what had always been the practice, except possibly for the beginnings of letters and the like.

According to the letter of the decree of 31 December 1930, titular patriarchs too were to be addressed with the title of &quot;(Most Reverend) Excellency&quot;, but in practice the Holy See continued to address them with the title of &quot;Beatitude&quot;, which was formally sanctioned for them with the motu proprio &quot;Cleri sanctitati&quot; of 2 June 1957.

Cardinals, even those who were bishops, continued to use the title of &quot;Eminence&quot;.

Eastern Orthodox titular metropolitans are addressed with the style of &quot;Excellency&quot;.

In some English-speaking countries, the honorific of &quot;Excellency&quot; does not apply to bishops other than the nuncio. In English law, Anglican archbishops are granted the title of &quot;His/Her Grace&quot;, similar to a duke, and bishops are granted the title of &quot;Lord&quot;. The same titles are extended by courtesy to their Catholic counterparts, and continue in use in most countries that are or have been members of the Commonwealth, with the exception of the former British East African countries of Kenya, Uganda of Tanzania.

== By country ==
=== Afghanistan ===
In Afghanistan the title &quot;Jalalat Mahab&quot; is used for Sardars, or Princes of the former Muhammadzai Dynasty, who are descendants of the Afghan King Sultan Mohammed Khan Telai. Although Jalalat Mahab is derived from the Arabic term &quot;Jalalat&quot; literally meaning &quot;His Majesty&quot;, it is regarded as equal to &quot;His Excellency&quot; or &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; internationally.

The descendants of King Nadir Shah held the title &quot;Alaa Hazrat&quot; in which context &quot;Hazrat&quot; is Turkish and means &quot;Majesty&quot; or &quot;Highness&quot; and thus literally translated means &quot;Higher Majesty&quot; or &quot;Higher Highness&quot; and is internationally also equal to &quot;His Royal Highness&quot;. The King himself held the title &quot;Alaa Hazrat Humayoon&quot; which literally translated means &quot;His Most Noble Majesty&quot;, and can be equalized with &quot;His Majesty&quot; internationally. President Daoud Khan, the Cousin of the last Afghan King Zahir Shah, who acted as prime minister under his cousin held the address &quot;Jalalat Mahab Aali Qadr Sardari Alaa&quot; during his term as Prime Minister.

&quot;His/Her Excellency&quot;, a custom dating from the ancient times wherein the Samrāt and Sāmrājñi (सम्राट, साम्राज्ञी/Emperor, Empress), Generals, Kings, Ambassadors were addressed. A classic example is addressing Devvrat (Bhishma) as महामहिम भीष्म (His/Your Excellency Bhishma) in Mahabharat.

However the Constitution makers approved will discontinue &quot;ancient era&quot; styles of Mahāmahim. The same release states that in English (which is the other language in which subsidiary official communications are released in the Central Government of India in its capacity of Sahāyak Rājabhāśhā: Subsidiary Officiating language) the style Honourable shall replace the erstwhile His/Her/Your Excellency. The newer style will be &quot;Honourable&quot;.

The corresponding changes in releases from the President&#x27;s Secretariat shall be from Mahāmahim to Rāshtrapatiji.

In Arabic the latter titles are often included between the first and last names of the holder, while in English the titles are not usually included and the style of &quot;His/Her Excellency&quot; is used on its own.

Populist president Rodrigo Duterte has expressed dislike for the traditional title. After assuming office in June 2016, he ordered that the title, along with all honorifics, be dropped from official communications, events, and materials but instead, he be addressed only as &quot;Mayor&quot; since people are already used to calling him as such due to Duterte being the longest-serving mayor of Davao City and that his cabinet officials only be addressed as &quot;Secretary&quot;. Other government officials followed suit by abandoning use of &quot;The Honorable&quot;. However, despite the prior unofficial abandonment, the president continues to be addressed as &quot;Excellency&quot; in formal correspondences and petitions, either verbally or written.

All other local and national government officials are styled &quot;The Honorable&quot;; both titles, however, may be glossed in Filipino as &quot;Ang Kagalang-galang&quot;.

=== Sri Lanka ===
The president of Sri Lanka was referred to as &quot;His/Her Excellency&quot;. This was until 2022, when President Ranil Wickremesinghe banned the use. However, it is still used diplomatically.

=== Sweden ===
The Swedish language titles and forms of address are &quot;Hans/Hennes Excellens&quot; (His/Her Excellency) and &quot;Ers Excellens&quot; (Your Excellency).

During most of the 20th century in Sweden, only three officials (other than foreign ambassadors accredited in Sweden and Swedish ambassadors at their posts) were granted to the style of &quot;Excellency&quot;: the prime minister, the minister for foreign affairs and the marshal of the realm (the highest ranking courtier). They were collectively referred to as &quot;the three excellencies&quot; (). In the 1970s it fell out of custom in Sweden to address the prime minister and the minister of foreign affairs as such, although they continue to be addressed as such in United Nations protocol and in other diplomatic writing. Since then only the Marshal of the Realm uses the style regularly.

Prior to the 19th century, a Lord of the Realm () and a member of the Council of the Realm were also entitled to the style of Excellency.

=== Thailand ===
The prime Minister of Thailand, deputy prime ministers, other cabinet members, governors and ambassadors are referred to as &quot;His/Her Excellency&quot;.

===Turkey===
In the English language, the president and the vice-president, cabinet ministers, ambassadors, and some other high-ranking bureaucrats are addressed as &quot;Excellency&quot;.

In the Turkish language, honorific titles are no longer used since the 1923 modernisation of the language; under Atatürk&#x27;s Reforms. Instead of &quot;Excellency&quot;, dignitaries are addressed using the Turkish word for &quot;Honorable (Turkish: Sayın)&quot; followed by their office. For example, an ambassador of Turkey would be addressed simply as &quot;Honorable Ambassador (Turkish: Sayın Büyükelçi).&quot; It is important to emphasise that this distinction only applies when speaking in the Turkish language, not in English. Additionally, in very rare ceremonial circumstances, the word &quot;Excellency&quot; is used in Turkish. An example would be the formal accreditation of a Turkish ambassador, wherein the letter of confidence authored by the Turkish president would address the ambassador as &quot;Excellency (Turkish: Ekselansları)&quot;.

=== United States ===
In the United States, the form &quot;Excellency&quot; was commonly used for George Washington during his service as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and later when president of the United States, but it began to fall out of use with his successor John Adams, and today is sometimes replaced in direct address with the simple &quot;Mr. President&quot; or &quot;the Honorable&quot;.

Nevertheless, in the protocol of many foreign countries and United Nations, the president and the secretary of state are usually referred to as &quot;Excellency&quot;. Diplomatic correspondence to President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War, as during the &quot;Trent&quot; Affair, for instance, frequently addressed him as &quot;Your Excellency&quot;.

The form &quot;Excellency&quot; was used for the governors of most of the original Thirteen Colonies, and the practice formally continued after independence. For example, the term was formerly used in Georgia on the state governor&#x27;s letterhead, the text of executive orders, any document that required the governor&#x27;s signature, and informal settings. However, in most states the practice fell out of use (or was never introduced) and the title &quot;Honorable&quot; is now used instead.

Though the U.S. president and U.S. ambassadors are traditionally accorded the style elsewhere, the U.S. government does not usually use &quot;Excellency&quot; for its own chiefs of missions, preferring &quot;Honorable&quot; instead.

<doc id="208986" wikidata="Q901644" url="?curid=208986" title="Red fuming nitric acid">
<text>Red fuming nitric acid (RFNA) is a storable oxidizer used as a rocket propellant. It consists of nitric acid (), dinitrogen tetroxide () and a small amount of water. The color of red fuming nitric acid is due to the dinitrogen tetroxide, which breaks down partially to form nitrogen dioxide. The nitrogen dioxide dissolves until the liquid is saturated, and produces toxic fumes with a suffocating odor. RFNA increases the flammability of combustible materials and is highly exothermic when reacting with water.

Since nitrogen dioxide is a product of decomposition of nitric acid, its addition stabilizes nitric acid in accordance with Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle. Addition of dinitrogen tetroxide also increases oxidizing power and lowers the freezing point. 

It is usually used with an inhibitor (with various, sometimes secret, substances, including hydrogen fluoride; any such combination is called &quot;inhibited RFNA&quot;, &quot;IRFNA&quot;) because nitric acid attacks most container materials. Hydrogen fluoride for instance will passivate the container metal with a thin layer of metal fluoride, making it nearly impervious to the nitric acid.

It can also be a component of a monopropellant; with substances like amine nitrates dissolved in it, it can be used as the sole fuel in a rocket. This is inefficient and it is not normally used this way.

During World War II, the German military used RFNA in some rockets. The mixtures used were called &quot;S-Stoff&quot; (96% nitric acid with 4% ferric chloride as an ignition catalyst) and &quot;SV-Stoff&quot; (94% nitric acid with 6% dinitrogen tetroxide) and nicknamed &quot;Salbei&quot; (sage).

Inhibited RFNA was the oxidizer of the world&#x27;s most-launched light orbital rocket, the Kosmos-3M. In former-Soviet countries inhibited RFNA is known as Mélange.

Other uses for RFNA include fertilizers, dye intermediates, explosives, and pharmaceutical acidifiers. It can also be used as a laboratory reagent in photoengraving and metal etching.

==Compositions==
* &quot;IRFNA IIIa&quot;: 83.4% HNO3, 14% NO2, 2% H2O, 0.6% HF
* &quot;IRFNA IV HDA&quot;: 54.3% HNO3, 44% NO2, 1% H2O, 0.7% HF
* &quot;S-Stoff&quot;: 96% HNO3, 4% FeCl3
* &quot;SV-Stoff&quot;: 94% HNO3, 6% N2O4
* &quot;AK20&quot;: 80% HNO3, 20% N2O4
* &quot;AK20F&quot;: 80% HNO3, 20% N2O4, fluorine-based inhibitor
* &quot;AK20I&quot;: 80% HNO3, 20% N2O4, iodine-based inhibitor
* &quot;AK20K&quot;: 80% HNO3, 20% N2O4, potassium-based inhibitor
* &quot;AK27I&quot;: 73% HNO3, 27% N2O4, iodine-based inhibitor
* &quot;AK27P&quot;: 73% HNO3, 27% N2O4, phosphorus-based inhibitor

==Corrosion==
; Hydrofluoric acid content of IRFNA: When RFNA is used as an oxidizer for rocket fuels, it usually has a HF content of about 0.6%. The purpose of the HF is to act as a corrosion inhibitor by forming a metal fluoride layer on the surface of the storage vessels.
; Water content of RFNA: To test the water content, a sample of 80% HNO3, 8–20% NO2, and the rest H2O depending on the varied amount of NO2 in the sample. When the RFNA contained HF, there was an average H2O% between 2.4% and 4.2%. When the RFNA did not contain HF, there was an average H2O% between 0.1% and 5.0%. When the metal impurities from corrosion were taken into account, the H2O% increased, and the H2O% was between 2.2% and 8.8%
; Corrosion of metals in RFNA: Stainless steel, aluminium alloys, iron alloys, chrome plates, tin, gold and tantalum were tested to see how RFNA affected the corrosion rates of each. Experiments were performed using 16% and 6.5% RFNA samples and the different substances listed above. Many different stainless steels showed resistance to corrosion. Aluminium alloys did not endure as well as stainless steels especially in high temperature, but the corrosion rates were not high enough to prohibit the use of this with RFNA. Tin, gold and tantalum showed high corrosion resistance similar to that of stainless steel. These materials are better though because at high temperatures the corrosion rates did not increase much. Corrosion rates at elevated temperatures increase in the presence of phosphoric acid. Sulfuric acid decreased corrosion rates.

<doc id="208995" wikidata="Q835764" url="?curid=208995" title="South of Heaven">
<text>South of Heaven is the fourth studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer, released on July 5, 1988, by Def Jam Recordings. The album was the band&#x27;s second collaboration with producer Rick Rubin, whose production skills on their previous album &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; (1986) had helped their sound evolve. Given the frenetic pace of &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, Slayer made no attempt to top it on &quot;South of Heaven&quot;; rather, the band offset and complemented &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; by deliberately slowing the tempo down on &quot;South of Heaven&quot;, as well as by utilizing undistorted guitars and toned-down vocals.

It was the band&#x27;s last album released by Def Jam, although the rights were transferred to Rubin&#x27;s new label Def American Recordings after Rubin ended his partnership with Russell Simmons. The album was one of only two Def Jam titles to be distributed by Geffen Records through Warner Bros., as Def Jam&#x27;s then-distributor Columbia refused to release work by the band.

&quot;South of Heaven&quot; became Slayer&#x27;s second album to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number 57. While some critics praised the change in the band&#x27;s sound, others more accustomed to the style of their earlier efforts were disappointed. Nonetheless, the songs &quot;Mandatory Suicide&quot; and the title track have since become permanent features of the band&#x27;s live setlist. &quot;South of Heaven&quot; was later certified gold by the RIAA in 1992.

== Background ==
The album was recorded in Los Angeles with &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; producer Rick Rubin. &quot;PopMatters&quot; reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin&#x27;s production &quot;shoves [Dave] Lombardo&#x27;s drumming right up front in the mix&quot;. Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that &quot;South of Heaven&quot; was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they &quot;couldn&#x27;t top &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;&quot;, and that whatever they recorded would be compared to the album, he believed they &quot;had to slow down&quot;, something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to &quot;keep people guessing&quot; as another reason for the musical shift. &quot;In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole&quot;, according to Slayer&#x27;s official biography. &quot;They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.&quot;

King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his &quot;most lackluster&quot;. King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as &quot;probably the odd man out at that point&quot;, he stated he &quot;didn&#x27;t participate as much because of that&quot;. Hanneman said: &quot;We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell.&quot; King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He felt vocalist Tom Araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and &quot;added too much singing&quot;. Drummer Dave Lombardo has since observed: &quot;There was fire on all the records, but it started dimming when &quot;South of Heaven&quot; came into the picture. And that&#x27;s me personally. Again, I was probably wanting something else.&quot;

Judas Priest&#x27;s &quot;Dissident Aggressor&quot; is the first cover version to appear on a Slayer studio album. The song was chosen due to its war-themed lyrics. Hanneman described the track as &quot;more just like one of those odd songs that a lot of people didn&#x27;t know, but it was a favorite of Kerry and I, so we just picked that one&quot;. Meanwhile, &quot;Cleanse the Soul&quot; has been heavily criticized by King who said that he hates the track: &quot;That&#x27;s one of the black marks in our history, in my book. I just fucking think it&#x27;s horrible. [Laughs] I hate the opening riff. It&#x27;s what we call a &#x27;happy riff.&#x27; It&#x27;s just like &#x27;la-lala-la-la-la.&#x27; I can&#x27;t see myself playing it, but after that, where it gets heavier, I like that section. If we ever did a medley, I&#x27;d put part of that in there.&quot; The closing track &quot;Spill The Blood&quot; features clean guitar tones in the beginning and middle sections, and Araya&#x27;s singing capabilities.

== Photography and illustration ==
Artist Larry Carroll and illustrator Howard Schwartzberg designed the cover artwork for &quot;South of Heaven&quot;, having designed the artwork for Slayer&#x27;s previous album &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;. Photographer Glen E. Friedman took the promotional shot which surfaced as the back cover of &quot;South of Heaven&quot; around the time of 1986&#x27;s &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;. Lombardo felt it made Slayer seem as though they &quot;had matured a little bit&quot;, while Friedman himself deemed it &quot;a really cool back cover&quot; and &quot;one of the most classic shots of them [Slayer] ever&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;South of Heaven&quot; was released on July 5, 1988, and was the final Slayer album distributed via Def Jam Records. When label co-founders Russell Simmons and Rubin parted ways, Slayer signed to Rubin&#x27;s newly founded Def American Recordings label. The album peaked at number 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, and on November 20, 1992, became Slayer&#x27;s second album to be certified gold in the United States. &quot;South of Heaven&quot; was awarded silver certification in the United Kingdom on January 1, 1993, Slayer&#x27;s first record to do so in that country. Slayer&#x27;s official biography states that &quot;some critics praised the album as demonstrating Slayer&#x27;s desire to grow musically and avoid repeating themselves.&quot; Alex Henderson of AllMusic described the record as &quot;disturbing and powerful,&quot; while Joe Matera of &quot;Ultimate Guitar&quot; deemed the album a slight departure; he wrote that while the pace was slowed down, it &quot;didn&#x27;t sacrifice any of the heaviness inherent in Slayer&#x27;s music&quot;.

Reviewing the 2003 Slayer box set &quot;Soundtrack to the Apocalypse&quot;, Adrien Begrand of &quot;PopMatters&quot; described the album as &quot;their most underrated, and on this set, its five selections show how highly the band thinks of the record&quot;. &quot;KNAC.com&quot;″s Peter Atkinson was also positive, saying the album has a &quot;grandiosity and imposing presence&quot; which makes the record &quot;so magnificent&quot;. Grave&#x27;s Ola Lindgren and Bolt Thrower&#x27;s Karl Willetts both rate &quot;South of Heaven&quot; as amongst the top five albums of all time, while Max Kolesne of Brazilian death metal group Krisiun remembers hearing the song &quot;Silent Scream&quot; for the first time: &quot;It just blew me away. It was like fast double-bass, fast kicks during the whole song. That was very inspiring for me.&quot; When discussing Slayer in an October 2007 interview, Evile frontman Matt Drake stated that while &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; &quot;was just speed&quot;, &quot;South of Heaven&quot; proved that the group could write &quot;slow material as well&quot;. &quot;Metal Forces&quot; reviewer gives &quot;the band credit for at least making an effort to try something new and not being afraid to experiment at such a crucial stage of their career&quot;, creating &quot;one of the more original sounding thrash / speed metal albums he heard in a long while&quot;. He remarked, however, that &quot;if you&#x27;re expecting to hear &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; Part Two, you&#x27;ll be in for a major disappointment&quot;.

Kim Neely of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; dismissed the album as &quot;genuinely offensive satanic drivel&quot;. However, the magazine would later rank the album 47th on their 2017 &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot; list. Slayer&#x27;s official biography states: &quot;The new sounds disappointed some of the band&#x27;s fans who were more accustomed to the style of earlier releases.&quot; Michael Roberts of Westworld Online said this was due to some of the numbers moving &quot;at the sludgier speed of Black Sabbath&quot;. Araya commented that the &quot;album was a late bloomer—it wasn&#x27;t really received well, but it kind of grew on everybody later&quot;. Decibel inducted &quot;South of Heaven&quot; into the Decibel Magazine Hall of Fame in January 2013. Due to Jeff Hanneman&#x27;s death in May of the same year, &quot;South of Heaven&quot; would be the second and final classic Slayer album to receive an induction into Decibel&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

== Cover versions ==

The title track and the song &quot;Mandatory Suicide&quot; have received various cover interpretations, particularly on Slayer tribute albums. Toni Ferguson recorded string quartet adaptations of both tracks on the album &quot;The String Quartet Tribute to Slayer: The Evil You Dread&quot;, with &quot;South of Heaven&quot; being described as having &quot;menacing chord shifts&quot; by AllMusic&#x27;s Johnny Loftus.

1995 Slayer tribute album &quot;Slatanic Slaughter&quot; featured three songs which originally appeared on &quot;South of Heaven&quot;, with &quot;South of Heaven&quot;, &quot;Mandatory Suicide&quot; and &quot;Spill the Blood&quot; interpreted by Cemetary, Crown of Thornz and Grope, respectively. Its 1998 follow up &quot;Slatanic Slaughter, Vol. 2&quot; only featured two tracks originally from the album: &quot;Silent Scream&quot;, arranged by Vader, and &quot;Read Between the Lies&quot;, interpreted by Anathema. 1999&#x27;s &quot;Straight to Hell: A Tribute to Slayer&quot; collected four Slayer renditions which originated on the album, with versions of &quot;South of Heaven&quot; performed by Abaddon, (Venom) and Electric Hellfire Club, &quot;Mandatory Suicide&quot; cut by Chapter 7 and &quot;Behind the Crooked Cross&quot; adapted by Gigantor. The 2006 Argentine tribute album &quot;Al Sur Del Abismo (Tributo Argentino A Slayer)&quot; saw Nafak and Climatic Terra also respectively cover &quot;South of Heaven&quot; and &quot;Mandatory Suicide&quot;.

== Live performances ==
Two songs taken from the album (&quot;Mandatory Suicide&quot; and &quot;South of Heaven&quot;) have become near constant fixtures in the band&#x27;s live setlist, notching up appearances on the following: the live DVDs &quot;Live Intrusion&quot;, &quot;War at the Warfield&quot;, &quot;Still Reigning&quot;, &quot;Soundtrack to the Apocalypse&quot;″s deluxe edition&#x27;s bonus live disc, and the live double album &quot;Decade of Aggression&quot;. Adrien Begrand of &quot;PopMatters&quot; described &quot;South of Heaven&quot; as &quot;an unorthodox set opener in theory&quot;, noting &quot;the song went over like a megaton bomb detonating the place: dozens of inverted crosses projected behind the high drum riser, the sinewy opening notes kicked in, followed by an overture of bass, cymbal crashes, and tom fills, leading up to the slowly building crescendo&quot; in a concert review. Lombardo remembers listening to a live rendition of &quot;South of Heaven&quot; and thinking, Man! There&#x27;s just so much groove in that song.&#x27; To my kids I was saying, &#x27;Listen to that! Listen to how groovy that is!&#x27; And it&#x27;s heavy.&quot; A live version of the track featured on the &quot;JÄGERMUSIC Rarities 2004&quot; promotional CD, given away to attendees at the Spring 2004 Jägermeister Music Tour.
A live rendition of &quot;South of Heaven&quot; was also included on a bonus DVD which came with the group&#x27;s 2007 re-release of ninth studio album &quot;Christ Illusion&quot;, shot in Vancouver, British Columbia during 2006&#x27;s Unholy Alliance tour.

&quot;Behind the Crooked Cross&quot; was rarely played live as Hanneman hated the track, though King had always wanted to play it &quot;because it&#x27;s got a cool intro&quot; despite it not being his favorite song. King said &quot;that&#x27;s fine&quot; when speaking of the situation, noting &quot;there are songs that he wants to play that I always shoot down&quot;. &quot;Ghosts of War&quot; isn&#x27;t King&#x27;s favorite song either, which he attests &quot;everybody always wants to hear&quot; performed live. He confessed; &quot;I like the ending, you know, I like the big heavy part and I always say, &#x27;Let&#x27;s put the heavy ending at the end of &quot;Chemical Warfare&quot; and just do the last half.&#x27; But I could never make that fly.&quot;

Slayer has toyed with the idea of creating a live set mixed with selections from the album and 1990&#x27;s &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot;, though Hanneman said it&#x27;s something which hasn&#x27;t been &quot;seriously considered&quot;. &quot;Metal Maniacs&quot; asked Slayer in a 2006 interview whether they would consider playing &quot;South of Heaven&quot; in the footsteps of the &quot;Still Reigning&quot; tour, to which Araya replied, &quot;It&#x27;s becoming a trendy thing now. I don&#x27;t know. We have some really cool albums, but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever do that again.&quot; King was equally unsure, commenting, &quot;Probably not. And I just don&#x27;t like enough songs off &quot;South of Heaven&quot;.&quot;

<text>Visual Basic (VB), originally called Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET), is a multi-paradigm, object-oriented programming language, implemented on .NET, Mono, and the .NET Framework. Microsoft launched VB.NET in 2002 as the successor to its original Visual Basic language, the last version of which was Visual Basic 6.0. Although the &quot;.NET&quot; portion of the name was dropped in 2005, this article uses &quot;Visual Basic [.NET]&quot; to refer to all Visual Basic languages released since 2002, in order to distinguish between them and the classic Visual Basic. Along with C# and F#, it is one of the three main languages targeting the .NET ecosystem. Microsoft updated its VB language strategy on 6 February 2023, stating that VB is a stable language now and Microsoft will keep maintaining it.

Microsoft&#x27;s integrated development environment (IDE) for developing in Visual Basic is Visual Studio. Most Visual Studio editions are commercial; the only exceptions are Visual Studio Express and Visual Studio Community, which are freeware. In addition, the .NET Framework SDK includes a freeware command-line compiler called vbc.exe. Mono also includes a command-line VB.NET compiler.

Visual Basic is often used in conjunction with the Windows Forms GUI library to make desktop apps for Windows. Programming for Windows Forms with Visual Basic involves dragging and dropping controls on a form using a GUI designer and writing corresponding code for each control.

== Use in making GUI programs ==

The Windows Forms library is most commonly used to create GUI interfaces in Visual Basic. All visual elements in the Windows Forms class library derive from the Control class. This provides the minimal functionality of a user interface element such as location, size, color, font, text, as well as common events like click and drag/drop. The Control class also has docking support to let a control rearrange its position under its parent.

Forms are typically designed in the Visual Studio IDE. In Visual Studio, forms are created using drag-and-drop techniques. A tool is used to place controls (e.g., text boxes, buttons, etc.) on the form (window). Controls have attributes and event handlers associated with them. Default values are provided when the control is created, but may be changed by the programmer. Many attribute values can be modified during run time based on user actions or changes in the environment, providing a dynamic application. For example, code can be inserted into the form resize event handler to reposition a control so that it remains centered on the form, expands to fill up the form, etc. By inserting code into the event handler for a keypress in a text box, the program can automatically translate the case of the text being entered, or even prevent certain characters from being inserted.

== Syntax ==

Visual Basic uses statements to specify actions. The most common statement is an expression statement, consisting of an expression to be evaluated, on a single line. As part of that evaluation, functions or subroutines may be called and variables may be assigned new values. To modify the normal sequential execution of statements, Visual Basic provides several control-flow statements identified by reserved keywords. Structured programming is supported by several constructs including two conditional execution constructs (codice_1 ... codice_2 ... codice_3 ... codice_4 and codice_5 ... codice_6 ... codice_7 ) and four iterative execution (loop) constructs (codice_8 ... codice_9, codice_10 ... codice_11, codice_12, and codice_13 ... codice_14) . The codice_10 ... codice_11 statement has separate initialisation and testing sections, both of which must be present. (See examples below.) The codice_12 statement steps through each value in a list.

In addition, in Visual Basic:
* There is no unified way of defining blocks of statements. Instead, certain keywords, such as &quot;If … Then&quot; or &quot;Sub&quot; are interpreted as starters of sub-blocks of code and have matching termination keywords such as &quot;End If&quot; or &quot;End Sub&quot;.
* Statements are terminated either with a colon (&quot;:&quot;) or with the end of line. Multiple-line statements in Visual Basic are enabled with &quot; _&quot; at the end of each such line. The need for the underscore continuation character was largely removed in version 10 and later versions.
* The equals sign (&quot;=&quot;) is used in both assigning values to variables and in comparison.
* Round brackets (parentheses) are used with arrays, both to declare them and to get a value at a given index in one of them. Visual Basic uses round brackets to define the parameters of subroutines or functions.
* A single quotation mark (&#x27;) or the keyword codice_18, placed at the beginning of a line or after any number of space or tab characters at the beginning of a line, or after other code on a line, indicates that the (remainder of the) line is a comment.

=== Simple example ===
The following is a very simple Visual Basic program, a version of the classic &quot;Hello, World!&quot; example created as a console application:
Module Module1

 Sub Main()
 &#x27; The classic &quot;Hello, World!&quot; demonstration program
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
 End Sub

End Module
It prints &quot;Hello, World!&quot; on a command-line window. Each line serves a specific purpose, as follows:
Module Module1
This is a module definition. Modules are a division of code, which can contain any kind of object, like constants or variables, functions or methods, or classes, but can not be instantiated as objects like classes and cannot inherit from other modules. Modules serve as containers of code that can be referenced from other parts of a program.It is common practice for a module and the code file which contains it to have the same name. However, this is not required, as a single code file may contain more than one module or class.

Sub Main()
This line defines a subroutine called &quot;Main&quot;. &quot;Main&quot; is the entry point, where the program begins execution.
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)
This line performs the actual task of writing the output. &quot;Console&quot; is a system object, representing a command-line interface (also known as a &quot;console&quot;) and granting programmatic access to the operating system&#x27;s standard streams. The program calls the &quot;Console&quot; method &quot;WriteLine,&quot; which causes the string passed to it to be displayed on the console.

Instead of Console.WriteLine, one could use MsgBox, which prints the message in a dialog box instead of a command-line window.

=== Complex example ===
This piece of code outputs Floyd&#x27;s Triangle to the console:

Imports System.Console

Module Program

 Sub Main()
 Dim rows As Integer

 &#x27; Input validation.
 Do Until Integer.TryParse(ReadLine(&quot;Enter a value for how many rows to be displayed: &quot; &amp; vbcrlf), rows) AndAlso rows &gt;= 1
 WriteLine(&quot;Allowed range is 1 and {0}&quot;, Integer.MaxValue)
 Loop
 &#x27; Output of Floyd&#x27;s Triangle
 Dim current As Integer = 1
 Dim row As Integer 
 Dim column As Integer
 For row = 1 To rows
 For column = 1 To row
 Write(&quot;{0,-2} &quot;, current)
 current += 1
 Next

 WriteLine()
 Next
 End Sub

 &lt;summary&gt;
 Like Console.ReadLine but takes a prompt string.
 &lt;/summary&gt;
 Function ReadLine(Optional prompt As String = Nothing) As String
 If prompt IsNot Nothing Then
 Write(prompt)
 End If

 Return Console.ReadLine()
 End Function

End Module
=== Comparison with the classic Visual Basic ===

Whether Visual Basic .NET should be considered as just another version of Visual Basic or a completely different language is a topic of debate. There are new additions to support new features, such as structured exception handling and short-circuited expressions. Also, two important data-type changes occurred with the move to VB.NET: compared to Visual Basic 6, the codice_19 data type has been doubled in length from 16 bits to 32 bits, and the codice_20 data type has been doubled in length from 32 bits to 64 bits. This is true for all versions of VB.NET. A 16-bit integer in all versions of VB.NET is now known as a codice_21. Similarly, the Windows Forms editor is very similar in style and function to the Visual Basic form editor.

The things that &quot;have&quot; changed significantly are the semantics—from those of an object-based programming language running on a deterministic, reference-counted engine based on COM to a fully object-oriented language backed by the .NET Framework, which consists of a combination of the Common Language Runtime (a virtual machine using generational garbage collection and a just-in-time compilation engine) and a far larger class library. The increased breadth of the latter is also a problem that VB developers have to deal with when coming to the language, although this is somewhat addressed by the &quot;My&quot; feature in Visual Studio 2005.

The changes have altered many underlying assumptions about the &quot;right&quot; thing to do with respect to performance and maintainability. Some functions and libraries no longer exist; others are available, but not as efficient as the &quot;native&quot; .NET alternatives. Even if they compile, most converted Visual Basic 6 applications will require some level of refactoring to take full advantage of the new language. Documentation is available to cover changes in the syntax, debugging applications, deployment, and terminology.

==== Comparative examples ====
The following simple examples compare VB and VB.NET syntax. They assume that the developer has created a form, placed a button on it and has associated the subroutines demonstrated in each example with the click event handler of the mentioned button. Each example creates a &quot;Hello, World&quot; message box after the button on the form is clicked.

Visual Basic 6:
Private Sub Command1_Click()
 MsgBox &quot;Hello, World&quot;
End Sub
VB.NET (MsgBox or MessageBox class can be used):
Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
 MsgBox(&quot;Hello, World&quot;)
End Sub

* Both Visual Basic 6 and Visual Basic .NET automatically generate the codice_22 and codice_23 statements when the corresponding button is double-clicked in design view. Visual Basic .NET will also generate the necessary codice_24 and codice_25 statements. The developer need only add the statement to display the &quot;Hello, World&quot; message box.
* All procedure calls must be made with parentheses in VB.NET, whereas in Visual Basic 6 there were different conventions for functions (parentheses required) and subs (no parentheses allowed, unless called using the keyword codice_26).
* The names codice_27 and codice_28 are not obligatory. However, these are default names for a command button in Visual Basic 6 and VB.NET respectively.
* In VB.NET, the codice_29 keyword is used to make the sub codice_30 a handler for the codice_31 event of the object codice_28. In Visual Basic 6, event handler subs must have a specific name consisting of the object&#x27;s name (), an underscore (), and the event&#x27;s name (, hence ).
* There is a function called codice_33 in the codice_34 namespace which can be used (instead of codice_35) similarly to the corresponding function in Visual Basic 6. There is a controversy about which function to use as a best practice (not only restricted to showing message boxes but also regarding other features of the codice_34 namespace). Some programmers prefer to do things &quot;the .NET way&quot;, since the Framework classes have more features and are less language-specific. Others argue that using language-specific features makes code more readable (for example, using codice_37 (C#) or codice_19 (VB.NET) instead of codice_39).
* In Visual Basic 2008, the inclusion of , has become optional.

The following example demonstrates a difference between Visual Basic 6 and VB.NET. Both examples close the active window.

Visual Basic 6:
Sub cmdClose_Click()
 Unload Me
End Sub
VB.NET:
Sub btnClose_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnClose.Click
 Close()
End Sub
The &#x27;cmd&#x27; prefix is replaced by the &#x27;btn&#x27; prefix, conforming to the new convention previously mentioned.

Visual Basic 6 did not provide common operator shortcuts. The following are equivalent:
Visual Basic 6:
Sub Timer1_Timer()
 &#x27;Reduces Form Height by one pixel per tick
 Me.Height = Me.Height - 1
End Sub
VB.NET:

Sub Timer1_Tick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Timer1.Tick
 Me.Height -= 1
End Sub
=== Comparison with C# ===
C# and Visual Basic are Microsoft&#x27;s first languages made to program on the .NET Framework (later adding F# and more; others have also added languages). Though C# and Visual Basic are syntactically different, that is where the differences mostly end. Microsoft developed both of these languages to be part of the same .NET Framework development platform. They are both developed, managed, and supported by the same language development team at Microsoft. They compile to the same intermediate language (IL), which runs against the same .NET Framework runtime libraries. Although there are some differences in the programming constructs, their differences are primarily syntactic and, assuming one avoids the Visual Basic &quot;Compatibility&quot; libraries provided by Microsoft to aid conversion from Visual Basic 6, almost every feature in VB has an equivalent feature in C# and vice versa. Lastly, both languages reference the same Base Classes of the .NET Framework to extend their functionality. As a result, with few exceptions, a program written in either language can be run through a simple syntax converter to translate to the other. There are many open source and commercially available products for this task.

== Examples ==

=== Hello World! ===

==== Windows Forms Application ====
Requires a button called Button1.
Public Class Form1

 Private Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
 MsgBox(&quot;Hello world!&quot;, MsgBoxStyle.Information, &quot;Hello world!&quot;) &#x27; Show a message that says &quot;Hello world!&quot;.
 End Sub
End Class


==== Console Application ====

== Version history ==
Succeeding the classic Visual Basic version 6.0, the first version of Visual Basic .NET debuted in 2002. , ten versions of Visual Basic .NET are released.

=== 2002 (VB 7.0) ===
The first version, Visual Basic .NET, relies on .NET Framework 1.0. The most important feature is managed code, which contrasts with the classic Visual Basic.

=== 2003 (VB 7.1) ===
Visual Basic .NET 2003 was released with .NET Framework 1.1. New features included support for the .NET Compact Framework and a better VB upgrade wizard. Improvements were also made to the performance and reliability of .NET IDE (particularly the background compiler) and runtime. In addition, Visual Basic .NET 2003 was available in the Visual Studio.NET Academic Edition, distributed to a certain number of scholars from each country without cost.

=== 2005 (VB 8.0) ===
After Visual Basic .NET 2003, Microsoft dropped &quot;.NET&quot; from the name of the product, calling the next version Visual Basic 2005.

For this release, Microsoft added many features intended to reinforce Visual Basic .NET&#x27;s focus as a rapid application development platform and further differentiate it from C#., including:
* &quot;Edit and Continue&quot; feature
* Design-time expression evaluation
* A pseudo-namespace called &quot;My&quot;, which provides:
** Easy access to certain areas of the .NET Framework that otherwise require significant code to access like using My.Form2.Text = &quot; MainForm &quot; rather than System.WindowsApplication1.Forms.Form2.text = &quot; MainForm &quot;
** Dynamically generated classes (e.g. &quot;My.Forms&quot;)
* Improved VB-to-VB.NET converter
* A &quot;using&quot; keyword, simplifying the use of objects that require the Dispose pattern to free resources
* &quot;Just My Code&quot; feature, which hides (steps over) boilerplate code written by the Visual Studio .NET IDE and system library code during debugging
* Data Source binding, easing database client/server development

To bridge the gaps between itself and other .NET languages, this version added:
* Generics
* Partial classes, a method of defining some parts of a class in one file and then adding more definitions later; particularly useful for integrating user code with auto-generated code
* Operator overloading and nullable types
* Support for unsigned integer data types commonly used in other languages

Visual Basic 2005 introduced the codice_40 operator that makes codice_41 equivalent to codice_42. It gained notoriety when it was found to be the subject of a Microsoft patent application.

=== 2008 (VB 9.0) ===
Visual Basic 9.0 was released along with .NET Framework 3.5 on November 19, 2007.

For this release, Microsoft added many features, including:
* A true conditional operator, &quot;If(condition as Boolean, truepart, falsepart)&quot;, to replace the &quot;IIf&quot; function.
* Anonymous types
* Support for LINQ
* Lambda expressions
* XML Literals
* Type Inference
* Extension methods

=== 2010 (VB 10.0) ===
In April 2010, Microsoft released Visual Basic 2010. Microsoft had planned to use Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) for that release but shifted to a co-evolution strategy between Visual Basic and sister language C# to bring both languages into closer parity with one another. Visual Basic&#x27;s innate ability to interact dynamically with CLR and COM objects has been enhanced to work with dynamic languages built on the DLR such as IronPython and IronRuby. The Visual Basic compiler was improved to infer line continuation in a set of common contexts, in many cases removing the need for the &quot; _&quot; line continuation characters. Also, existing support of inline Functions was complemented with support for inline Subs as well as multi-line versions of both Sub and Function lambdas.

=== 2012 (VB 11.0) ===
Visual Basic 2012 was released alongside .NET Framework 4.5. Major features introduced in this version include:
* Asynchronous programming with &quot;async&quot; and &quot;await&quot; statements
* Iterators
* Call hierarchy
* Caller information
* &quot;Global&quot; keyword in &quot;namespace&quot; statements

=== 2013 (VB 12.0) ===
Visual Basic 2013 was released alongside .NET Framework 4.5.1 with Visual Studio 2013. Can also build .NET Framework 4.5.2 applications by installing Developer Pack.

=== 2015 (VB 14.0) ===
Visual Basic 2015 (code named VB &quot;14.0&quot;) was released with Visual Studio 2015. Language features include a new &quot;?.&quot; operator to perform inline null checks, and a new string interpolation feature is included to format strings inline.

=== 2017 (VB 15.x) ===
Visual Basic 2017 (code named VB &quot;15.0&quot;) was released with Visual Studio 2017.
Extends support for new Visual Basic 15 language features with revision 2017, 15.3, 15.5, 15.8. Introduces new refactorings that allow organizing source code with one action.

=== 2019 (VB 16.0) ===
Visual Basic 2019 (code named VB &quot;16.0&quot;) was released with Visual Studio 2019. It is the first version of Visual Basic focused on .NET Core.

A minor update was later released as Visual Basic 16.9 which only added the ability to consume init-only properties. This was done to maintain compatibility with C# 9.0 per the current development strategy of the language.

=== 2022 ===
Visual Basic received no updates with the release of Visual Studio 2022.

== Cross-platform and open-source development ==
The official Visual Basic compiler is written in Visual Basic and is available on GitHub as a part of the .NET Compiler Platform. The creation of open-source tools for Visual Basic development has been slow compared to C#, although the Mono development platform provides an implementation of Visual Basic-specific libraries and a Visual Basic 2005 compatible compiler written in Visual Basic, as well as standard framework libraries such as Windows Forms GUI library.

MonoDevelop was an open-source alternative IDE. The Gambas environment is also similar but distinct from Visual Basic, as is the Visual FB Editor for FreeBasic.

<doc id="208999" wikidata="Q936791" url="?curid=208999" title="Non-renewable resource">
<text>A non-renewable resource (also called a finite resource) is a natural resource that cannot be readily replaced by natural means at a pace quick enough to keep up with consumption. An example is carbon-based fossil fuels. The original organic matter, with the aid of heat and pressure, becomes a fuel such as oil or gas. Earth minerals and metal ores, fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas) and groundwater in certain aquifers are all considered non-renewable resources, though individual elements are always conserved (except in nuclear reactions, nuclear decay or atmospheric escape).

Conversely, resources such as timber (when harvested sustainably) and wind (used to power energy conversion systems) are considered renewable resources, largely because their localized replenishment can also occur within human lifespans.

== Earth minerals and metal ores ==


Earth minerals and metal ores are examples of non-renewable resources. The metals themselves are present in vast amounts in Earth&#x27;s crust, and their extraction by humans only occurs where they are concentrated by natural geological processes (such as heat, pressure, organic activity, weathering and other processes) enough to become economically viable to extract. These processes generally take from tens of thousands to millions of years, through plate tectonics, tectonic subsidence and crustal recycling.

The localized deposits of metal ores near the surface which can be extracted economically by humans are non-renewable in human time-frames. There are certain rare earth minerals and elements that are more scarce and exhaustible than others. These are in high demand in manufacturing, particularly for the electronics industry.

== Fossil fuels ==

Natural resources such as coal, petroleum (crude oil) and natural gas take thousands of years to form naturally and cannot be replaced as fast as they are being consumed. It is projected that fossil-based resources will eventually become too costly to harvest and humanity will need to shift its reliance to renewable energy such as solar or wind power.

An alternative hypothesis is that carbon-based fuel is virtually inexhaustible in human terms, if one includes all sources of carbon-based energy such as methane hydrates on the sea floor, which are much greater than all other carbon-based fossil fuel resources combined. These sources of carbon are also considered non-renewable, although their rate of formation/replenishment on the sea floor is not known. However, their extraction at economically viable costs and rates has yet to be determined.

At present, the main energy source used by humans is non-renewable fossil fuels. Since the dawn of internal combustion engine technologies in the 19th century, petroleum and other fossil fuels have remained in continual demand. As a result, conventional infrastructure and transport systems, which are fitted to combustion engines, remain predominant around the globe.

The modern-day fossil fuel economy is widely criticized for its lack of renewability, as well as being a contributor to climate change.

== Nuclear fuels ==


In 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) classified fission reactors that produce more fissile nuclear fuel than they consume (i.e. breeder reactors) among conventional renewable energy sources, such as solar and falling water. The American Petroleum Institute likewise does not consider conventional nuclear fission as renewable, but rather that breeder reactor nuclear power fuel is considered renewable and sustainable, noting that radioactive waste from used spent fuel rods remains radioactive and so has to be very carefully stored for several hundred years. With the careful monitoring of radioactive waste products also being required upon the use of other renewable energy sources, such as geothermal energy.

The use of nuclear technology relying on fission requires naturally occurring radioactive material as fuel. Uranium, the most common fission fuel, is present in the ground at relatively low concentrations and mined in 19 countries. This mined uranium is used to fuel energy-generating nuclear reactors with fissionable uranium-235 which generates heat that is ultimately used to power turbines to generate electricity.

As of 2013 only a few kilograms (picture available) of uranium have been extracted from the ocean in pilot programs and it is also believed that the uranium extracted on an industrial scale from the seawater would constantly be replenished from uranium leached from the ocean floor, maintaining the seawater concentration at a stable level. In 2014, with the advances made in the efficiency of seawater uranium extraction, a paper in the journal of &quot;Marine Science &amp; Engineering&quot; suggests that with, light water reactors as its target, the process would be economically competitive if implemented on a large scale.

Nuclear power provides about 6% of the world&#x27;s energy and 13–14% of the world&#x27;s electricity. Nuclear energy production is associated with potentially dangerous radioactive contamination as it relies upon unstable elements. In particular, nuclear power facilities produce about 200,000 metric tons of low and intermediate level waste (LILW) and 10,000 metric tons of high level waste (HLW) (including spent fuel designated as waste) each year worldwide.

Separate from the question of the sustainability of nuclear fuel use are concerns about the high-level radioactive waste the nuclear industry generates, which if not properly contained, is highly hazardous to people and wildlife. The United Nations (UNSCEAR) estimated in 2008 that average annual human radiation exposure includes 0.01 millisievert (mSv) from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing plus the Chernobyl disaster and the nuclear fuel cycle, along with 2.0 mSv from natural radioisotopes and 0.4 mSv from cosmic rays; all exposures vary by location. Natural uranium in some inefficient reactor nuclear fuel cycles becomes part of the nuclear waste &quot;once through&quot; stream, and in a similar manner to the scenario were this uranium remained naturally in the ground, this uranium emits various forms of radiation in a decay chain that has a half-life of about 4.5 billion years. The storage of this unused uranium and the accompanying fission reaction products has raised public concerns about risks of leaks and containment, however studies conducted on the natural nuclear fission reactor in Oklo Gabon, have informed geologists on the proven processes that kept the waste from this 2 billion year old natural nuclear reactor.

== Land surface ==
Land surface can be considered both a renewable and non-renewable resource depending on the scope of comparison. Land can be reused, but new land cannot be created on demand, making it a fixed resource with perfectly inelastic supply from an economic perspective.

== Renewable resources ==

Natural resources, known as renewable resources, are replaced by natural processes and forces persistent in the natural environment. There are intermittent and reoccurring renewables, and recyclable materials, which are utilized during a cycle across a certain amount of time, and can be harnessed for any number of cycles.

The production of goods and services by manufacturing products in economic systems creates many types of waste during production and after the consumer has made use of it. The material is then either incinerated, buried in a landfill or recycled for reuse. Recycling turns materials of value that would otherwise become waste into valuable resources again.
In the natural environment water, forests, plants and animals are all renewable resources, as long as they are adequately monitored, protected and conserved. Sustainable agriculture is the cultivation of plant and animal materials in a manner that preserves plant and animal ecosystems and that can improve soil health and soil fertility over the long term. The overfishing of the oceans is one example of where an industry practice or method can threaten an ecosystem, endanger species and possibly even determine whether or not a fishery is sustainable for use by humans. An unregulated industry practice or method can lead to a complete resource depletion.
The renewable energy from the sun, wind, wave, biomass and geothermal energies are based on renewable resources. Renewable resources such as the movement of water (hydropower, tidal power and wave power), wind and radiant energy from geothermal heat (used for geothermal power) and solar energy (used for solar power) are practically infinite and cannot be depleted, unlike their non-renewable counterparts, which are likely to run out if not used sparingly.

The potential wave energy on coastlines can provide 1/5 of world demand. Hydroelectric power can supply 1/3 of our total energy global needs. Geothermal energy can provide 1.5 more times the energy we need. There is enough wind to power all of humanity&#x27;s needs 30 times over. Solar currently supplies only 0.1% of our world energy needs, but could power humanity&#x27;s needs 4,000 times over, the entire global projected energy demand by 2050.

Renewable energy and energy efficiency are no longer niche sectors that are promoted only by governments and environmentalists. The increasing levels of investment and capital from conventional financial actors suggest that sustainable energy has become mainstream and the future of energy production, as non-renewable resources decline. This is reinforced by climate change concerns, nuclear dangers and accumulating radioactive waste, high oil prices, peak oil and increasing government support for renewable energy. These factors are commercializing renewable energy, enlarging the market and increasing the adoption of new products to replace obsolete technology and the conversion of existing infrastructure to a renewable standard.

==Economic models==
In economics, a non-renewable resource is defined as goods whose greater consumption today implies less consumption tomorrow. David Ricardo in his early works analysed the pricing of exhaustible resources, and argued that the price of a mineral resource should increase over time. He argued that the spot price is always determined by the mine with the highest cost of extraction, and mine owners with lower extraction costs benefit from a differential rent. The first model is defined by Hotelling&#x27;s rule, which is a 1931 economic model of non-renewable resource management by Harold Hotelling. It shows that efficient exploitation of a nonrenewable and nonaugmentable resource would, under otherwise stable conditions, lead to a depletion of the resource. The rule states that this would lead to a net price or &quot;Hotelling rent&quot; for it that rises annually at a rate equal to the rate of interest, reflecting the increasing scarcity of the resources. The Hartwick&#x27;s rule provides an important result about the sustainability of welfare in an economy that uses non-renewable resources.

<text>Poor Righteous Teachers was a hip hop group from Trenton, New Jersey, founded in 1989. Often referred to as PRT by its fans, Poor Righteous Teachers was known as a socially and politically conscious hip hop group, with musical content inspired by the teachings of the Nation of Gods and Earths. Wise Intelligent, as the lead MC, was the most visible and well known member of the group. Culture Freedom provided vocals and production, and Father Shaheed served as a DJ and producer. About.com ranked the group&#x27;s lead MC, Wise Intelligent, number five on its list of the 10 Most Underrated Rappers, calling him &quot;one of the most creative MCs of our time.&quot;

==Career==
PRT debuted in 1989 with the release of the single &quot;Time to Say Peace&quot; b/w &quot;Butt Naked Booty Bless.&quot; The trio released its first album, &quot;Holy Intellect&quot;, in 1990, amid a number of similarly pro-Black albums such as Public Enemy&#x27;s &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot;, X-Clan&#x27;s &quot;To the East, Blackwards&quot;, and Brand Nubian&#x27;s &quot;One for All&quot;. While not as commercially successful as these albums, &quot;Holy Intellect&quot; received critical acclaim and spawned the group&#x27;s only major radio hit, &quot;Rock Dis Funky Joint.&quot; PRT also appeared on King Sun&#x27;s 1990 album, &quot;Righteous but Ruthless&quot;. PRT returned in 1991 with its second album, &quot;Pure Poverty&quot;. The album was not as commercially successful as its debut, and was not as acclaimed. The lead single &quot;Shakiyla (JRH)&quot;, became a minor rap hit that year. The group&#x27;s third, and possibly most successful release to date, &quot;Black Business&quot;, was released in 1993. Sales were once again limited, but the album was a critical success. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Nobody Move&quot;, received little radio airplay. After a three-year hiatus, PRT returned as a group in 1996 with its fourth album, &quot;The New World Order&quot;. Released in a new Hip Hop era, the album received little attention, failing to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Word Iz Life&quot;, was barely able to reach the Hot Rap Singles chart, peaking at the chart&#x27;s lowest position, #50. Despite the lack of significant attention, the album, like its past releases, received significant acclaim.

In 2001, Poor Righteous Teachers dropped the rare underground release &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot;. In 2006, Cha-Ching Records released &quot;Rare &amp; Unreleased&quot;, a compilation of rare Poor Righteous Teachers songs and remixes.

PRT had a short feud with rapper YZ over reels of tapes that YZ would not give back to their owner, PRT.

Father Shaheed died on May 26, 2014, from a motorcycle accident.

<text>Noon (also known as noontime or midday) is 12 o&#x27;clock in the daytime. It is written as 12 noon, 12:00 m. (for &quot;meridiem&quot;, literally 12:00 midday), 12 p.m. (for &quot;post meridiem&quot;, literally &quot;after midday&quot;), 12 pm, or 12:00 (using a 24-hour clock) or 1200 (military time).
Solar noon is the time when the Sun appears to contact the local celestial meridian. This is when the Sun reaches its apparent highest point in the sky, at 12 noon apparent solar time and can be observed using a sundial. The local or clock time of solar noon depends on the date, longitude, and time zone, with Daylight Savings Time tending to place solar noon closer to 1:00pm.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;noon&quot; is derived from Latin &quot;nona hora&quot;, the ninth canonical hour of the day, in reference to the Western Christian liturgical term Nones (liturgy), (number nine), one of the seven fixed prayer times in traditional Christian denominations. The Roman and Western European medieval monastic day began at 6:00 a.m. (06:00) at the equinox by modern timekeeping, so the ninth hour started at what is now 3:00 p.m. (15:00) at the equinox. In English, the meaning of the word shifted to &quot;midday&quot; and the time gradually moved back to 12:00 local timethat is, not taking into account the modern invention of time zones. The change began in the 12th century and was fixed by the 14th century.

==Solar noon==

Solar noon, also known as the local apparent solar noon and Sun transit time (informally high noon), is the moment when the Sun contacts the observer&#x27;s meridian (&quot;culmination&quot; or &quot;meridian transit&quot;), reaching its highest position above the horizon on that day and casting the shortest shadow. This is also the origin of the terms &quot;ante meridiem&quot; (a.m.) and &quot;post meridiem&quot; (p.m.), as noted below. The Sun is directly overhead at solar noon at the Equator on the equinoxes, at the Tropic of Cancer (latitude N) on the June solstice and at the Tropic of Capricorn ( S) on the December solstice. In the Northern Hemisphere, north of the Tropic of Cancer, the Sun is due south of the observer at solar noon; in the Southern Hemisphere, south of the Tropic of Capricorn, it is due north.

When the Sun contacts the observer&#x27;s meridian at the observer&#x27;s zenith, it is perceived to be directly overhead and no shadows are cast. This occurs at Earth&#x27;s subsolar point, a point which moves around the tropics throughout the year.

The elapsed time from the local solar noon of one day to the next is exactly 24 hours on only four instances in any given year. This occurs when the effects of Earth&#x27;s obliquity of ecliptic and its orbital speed around the Sun offset each other. These four days for the current epoch are centered on 11 February, 13 May, 26 July, and 3 November. It occurs at only one particular line of longitude in each instance. This line varies year to year, since Earth&#x27;s true year is not an integer number of days. This event time and location also varies due to Earth&#x27;s orbit being gravitationally perturbed by the planets. These four 24-hour days occur in both hemispheres simultaneously. The precise Coordinated Universal Times for these four days also mark when the opposite line of longitude, 180° away, experiences precisely 24 hours from local midnight to local midnight the next day. Thus, four varying great circles of longitude define from year to year when a 24-hour day (noon to noon or midnight to midnight) occurs.

The two longest time spans from noon to noon occur twice each year, around 20 June (24 hours plus 13 seconds) and 21 December (24 hours plus 30 seconds). The shortest time spans occur twice each year, around 25 March (24 hours minus 18 seconds) and 13 September (24 hours minus 22 seconds).

For the same reasons, solar noon and &quot;clock noon&quot; are usually not the same. The equation of time shows that the reading of a clock at solar noon will be higher or lower than 12:00 by as much as 16 minutes. Additionally, due to the political nature of time zones, as well as the application of daylight saving time, it can be off by more than an hour.

==Nomenclature==

In the US, noon is commonly indicated by 12 p.m., and midnight by 12 a.m. While some argue that such usage is &quot;improper&quot; based on the Latin meaning (a.m. stands for &quot;ante meridiem&quot; and p.m. for &quot;post meridiem&quot;, meaning &quot;before midday&quot; and &quot;after midday&quot; respectively), digital clocks are unable to display anything else, and an arbitrary decision must be made. An earlier standard of indicating noon as &quot;12M&quot; or &quot;12m&quot; (for &quot;meridies&quot;), which was specified in the &quot;U.S. GPO Government Style Manual&quot;, has fallen into relative obscurity; the current edition of the GPO makes no mention of it. However, due to the lack of an international standard, the use of &quot;12 a.m.&quot; and &quot;12 p.m.&quot; can be confusing. Common alternative methods of representing these times are:
* to use a 24-hour clock (00:00 and 12:00, 24:00; but never 24:01)
* to use &quot;12 noon&quot; or &quot;12 midnight&quot; (though &quot;12 midnight&quot; may still present ambiguity regarding the specific date)
* to specify midnight as between two successive days or dates (as in &quot;midnight Saturday/Sunday&quot; or &quot;midnight December 14/15&quot;)
* to avoid those specific times and to use &quot;11:59 p.m.&quot; or &quot;12:01 a.m.&quot; instead. (This is common in the travel industry to avoid confusion to passengers&#x27; schedules, especially train and plane schedules.)

<text>Entombed is a Swedish death metal band formed in 1987 under the name of Nihilist. Entombed began their career as an early pioneer of Scandinavian death metal which initially differed from its American counterpart by its distinct &quot;buzzsaw&quot; guitar tone. However, by the early 1990s their sound had broadened to include garage rock and other influences. This new style would eventually be described as death &#x27;n&#x27; roll. Along with Dismember, Grave and Unleashed, Entombed has been referred to as one of the &quot;big four&quot; of Swedish death metal.

==History==
===Early career (1987–1991)===
Entombed are rooted in the band Nihilist who were formed by drummer Nicke Andersson, guitarist Alex Hellid and bassist Leif Cuzner, who formed the band in 1987. After using a number of temporary vocalists for their initial shows, the band eventually recruited L.G. Petrov, who was the drummer for the band Morbid, which featured Mayhem vocalist Dead. The band also recruited Morbid&#x27;s session guitarist Uffe Cederlund as a second guitarist, and recorded a number of demos with tracks that would eventually appear on Entombed&#x27;s debut album. Following increased tensions between band members, the majority of the band decided to rename themselves as Entombed rather than force these members out.

Entombed&#x27;s debut album &quot;Left Hand Path&quot; was released in 1990, a cult favorite that established them as a popular Swedish death metal band. &quot;Left Hand Path&quot; and its follow-up, &quot;Clandestine&quot;, were unique in that they featured what was sometimes referred to as a &quot;buzz saw&quot; guitar sound. Prior to the recording of &quot;Clandestine&quot;, Petrov was fired from the band due to personal disputes. The vocals on the album were recorded by Andersson instead, and for the tour following the album&#x27;s release in 1991, the band hired vocalist Johnny Dordevic, previously a member of the band Carnage.

===1992–2000===
Petrov eventually reconciled with the band after releasing an album with the band Comecon, and the band eventually released &quot;Wolverine Blues&quot; in 1993. The album featured a departure of sound from the band&#x27;s previous work, with a greater influence of hard rock and heavy metal alongside their initial death metal stylings, in a style now often referred to as death &#x27;n&#x27; roll. Although the release was divisive amongst the band&#x27;s fanbase, it established their mainstream and critical reputation. &quot;Wolverine Blues&quot; is considered a classic of early 1990s death metal.

1998&#x27;s &quot;Same Difference&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album without drummer and founding member Nicke Andersson, who left the band to concentrate on his new project The Hellacopters. He was replaced by Peter Stjärnvind. In 2000, Entombed released &quot;Uprising&quot;, followed a year later by &quot;Morning Star&quot;.

===2001–2009===
In 2001, the band worked with performance artists Carina Reich and Bogdan Szyberb, and the Royal Swedish Ballet. The production was entitled &quot;Unreal Estate&quot;.

2003 saw the release of &quot;Inferno&quot;, which was the last album with guitarist Uffe Cederlund (who joined Disfear), bassist Jörgen Sandström and drummer Peter Stjärnvind.

Nico Elgstrand (who produced the album &quot;Uprising&quot;) joined as bassist in 2004, Olle Dahlstedt (of Alpha Safari and ex–Misery Loves Co.), replaced Stjärnvind in 2006. When Uffe Cederlund left in 2005, no new guitarist was recruited and Alex Hellid remained as the only guitarist.

&quot;Serpent Saints – The Ten Amendments&quot; was released on 9 July 2007. The album featured a greater influence from traditional death metal and was the band&#x27;s first release with drummer Olle Dahlstedt and bassist Nico Elgstrand.

===2010–2020===
In 2010, Victor Brandt joined as bass player and Nico Elgstrand switched to guitars so the band once again had two guitarists.

In April 2013, Entombed performed a set with the Sundsvall Chamber Orchestra at the Nordfest festival.

In 2013, Petrov and Hellid began a legal battle regarding the name Entombed.

In 2014, L.G. Petrov, Olle Dahlstedt, Nico Elgstrand and Victor Brandt formed Entombed A.D. as a result of the band&#x27;s trademark being held by Hellid.

Hellid, Cederlund, and Säfström reunited to perform &quot;Clandestine&quot; in its entirety with the 65-piece Gävle Symphonic Orchestra and a 40-piece choir in February 2014. Thomas von Wachenfeldt played bass. Nicke Andersson intended to participate, but was prevented by scheduling conflicts.

Hellid, Andersson and Cederlund reunited to perform as Entombed in October 2016. They were joined by Robert Andersson (vocals) and Nicke Andersson&#x27;s half brother Edvin Aftonfalk (bass), both formerly of the Swedish death metal band Morbus Chron. Their first performance was at the Close-Up Båten festival cruise. In November they performed a double set in Malmö to celebrate the 25th anniversary of &quot;Clandestine&quot;, where the album was performed in its entirety twice. The first set was a performance by Hellid, Cederlund, Andersson with Säfström and von Wachenfeldt and the Malmö Symphony Orchestra and the second set was a regular performance with Andersson and Aftonfalk.

===2021–present===
On 7 March, 2021, former vocalist Lars-Göran Petrov died from cholangiocarcinoma, aged 49.

On July 14, 2022, Entombed performed at Gefle Metal Festival. The band consisted of Alex Hellid, Nicke Andersson, Uffe Cederlund and Jörgen Sandström. Vocals were performed by Sandström and guest vocalists Tomas Lindberg, Scott Carlson, Johnny Hedlund, Urskogr, and Cronos. Former Entombed drummer Peter Stjärnvind was guest on drums.

==Artistry==
===Style and legacy===
Music journalists have referred to Entombed as one of the &quot;big four&quot; of European death metal, along with Dismember, Grave, and Unleashed. The band became known for their &quot;buzzsaw&quot; guitar tone, which was achieved through the use of a Peavey amplifier and a Boss HM-2 distortion pedal. Entombed&#x27;s influence has been observed in Black Breath, Nails, Early Graves, and Trap Them.

===Influences===
Entombed&#x27;s main influences include bands such as Obituary, Napalm Death, GBH, Suicidal Tendencies, the Stupids, Atheist, Executioner, Dirty Rotten Imbeciles, Slayer, Celtic Frost, Repulsion, and Autopsy.

<text>Bikini Kill is an American punk rock band formed in Olympia, Washington, in October 1990. The group originally consisted of singer and songwriter Kathleen Hanna, guitarist Billy Karren, bassist Kathi Wilcox, and drummer Tobi Vail. 

The band pioneered the riot grrrl movement, with feminist lyrics and fiery performances. Their music is characteristically abrasive and hardcore-influenced. 

After two full-length albums, several EPs and two compilations, they disbanded in 1997. The band reunited for tours in 2019 and 2022, with Erica Dawn Lyle on guitar in place of Karren.

==History==

=== 1990 – 1997: Formation and career ===

Bikini Kill formed in Olympia, Washington, in October 1990, by Kathleen Hanna (vocals), Billy Karren (guitar), Kathi Wilcox (bass), and Tobi Vail (drums). Hanna, Vail, and Wilcox met while attending The Evergreen State College in Washington. Hanna also published a fanzine called &quot;Bikini Kill&quot; for their first tours in 1991. The band wrote songs together and encouraged a female-centric environment at their shows, urging women to come to the front of the stage and handing out lyric sheets to them. Hanna would also dive into the crowd to personally remove male hecklers. Such male concertgoers would often verbally and physically assault Hanna during shows when the tickets were still inexpensive and easily procured. However, the band&#x27;s reach included large male audiences as well as young women.

Fellow riot grrrl musician Lois Maffeo originally adopted Bikini Kill as a band name, inspired by the 1967 B-movie &quot;The Million Eyes of Sumuru&quot;. She and her friend Margaret Doherty used the name for a one-off performance in the late 1980s where they donned faux fur punk cave girl costumes. Vail liked the name and appropriated it after Maffeo settled on the band name Cradle Robbers.

After an independent demo cassette, &quot;Revolution Girl Style Now&quot;, Bikini Kill released the &quot;Bikini Kill&quot; EP on the indie label Kill Rock Stars. Produced by Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat and Fugazi, the released help establish the band&#x27;s audience. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Pussy Whipped&quot;, was released in September 1993. Bikini Kill toured in London, England to begin working with Huggy Bear, releasing a split album, &quot;Our Troubled Youth&quot; / &quot;Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah&quot;, and touring the UK. The tour was the subject of a documentary film by Lucy Thane titled &quot;It Changed My Life: Bikini Kill in the U.K.&quot; Upon their return to the United States, the band began working with Joan Jett of the Runaways, whose music Hanna described as an early example of the Riot Grrrl aesthetic. Jett produced the single &quot;New Radio&quot;/&quot;Rebel Girl&quot; for the band, and Hanna co-wrote several songs on Jett&#x27;s &quot;Pure and Simple&quot; album.

By the following year, Riot Grrrl was receiving constant attention in the media, and Bikini Kill were increasingly referred to as pioneers of the movement. Hanna called for a &quot;media blackout&quot; amongst Riot Grrrls, as they felt the band and the movement were being misrepresented by the media. The pioneer reputation endures but, as Hanna recalls, &quot;[Bikini Kill was] very vilified during the &#x27;90s by so many people, and hated by so many people, and I think that that&#x27;s been kind of written out of the history. People were throwing chains at our heads – people hated us – and it was really, really hard to be in that band.&quot;

The band&#x27;s final album, &quot;Reject All American&quot;, was released in 1996. After the band&#x27;s breakup in 1997, a compilation of singles recorded between 1993 and 1995 was released in 1998 under the name &quot;The Singles&quot;.

=== 1998 – 2016: Post-breakup ===
During the summer of 1992, Karren, Wilcox, and Vail, along with Molly Neuman of Bratmobile, formed The Frumpies, touring as late as the early 2000s along with a similar Italian punk rock band Dada Swing.

Vail, notorious for her numerous side projects and being in several bands at a time, later resurfaced in a band called Spider and the Webs, and played with the Old Haunts until the band broke up in 2009. Kathi Wilcox played in the Casual Dots, who released albums in 2004 and 2022, and Billy Karren played in Ghost Mom. Hanna first contributed to an LP called &quot;Real Fiction&quot; as a member of the Fakes, and then turned to more dance-based new wave music (with similar feminist lyrical themes) on her solo debut, &quot;Julie Ruin&quot;. She then became a member of the political new wave outfit Le Tigre. After Le Tigre broke up, Hanna became the front woman of a band named after her solo project, The Julie Ruin, for which Wilcox plays bass.

In February 2016, a pro-Hillary Clinton clip utilizing the Bikini Kill song &quot;Rebel Girl&quot; began to go viral, but was taken down by Vail (who supported Bernie Sanders in the primary).

=== 2017 – present: Reunion tours ===
In 2017, Kathleen Hanna, Kathi Wilcox and Tobi Vail reunited to play one song at a book-release concert for Jenn Pelly&#x27;s book about the Raincoats. On January 15, 2019, Bikini Kill announced four U.S. shows, in New York and Los Angeles. The lineup for these shows included Hanna, Wilcox, Tobi Vail and touring guitarist Erica Dawn Lyle, who replaced Billy Karren in the lineup. The first show was April 25 at the Hollywood Palladium with Alice Bag as opener. In June the band played two European dates, in London at Brixton Academy, supported by Big Joanie, and with the Tuts and Child&#x27;s Pose opening. On September 15, they headlined the third day of the Riot Fest event in Chicago.

On November 6, 2019, Bikini Kill announced a thirteen-date North American Tour for 2020, beginning in Olympia, Washington. The lineup for these shows was the same for the previous dates in 2019, and was scheduled to start March 13, 2020 at Olympia&#x27;s Capitol Theater. The remainder of the West Coast tour included shows in Victoria, B.C., where they were to be supported by Mecca Normal, and in Portland supported by the Lithics. The tour also included some European dates in June and August, including Oslo&#x27;s Øya Festival. The tour was rescheduled to 2022 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In October 2022 the band announced an Australian tour for March 2023, their first Australian shows in 26 years, touring to Hobart, Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne, the Golden Plains Festival in country Victoria, Perth and at the Sydney Opera House. Hanna, Wilcox and Vail were joined by touring guitarist Sara Landeau, who played with both Hanna and Wilcox in The Julie Ruin. Vail also fell ill for part of the tour, leaving the band&#x27;s Australian drum tech Lauren Hammel (also of Tropical Fuck Storm) to fill in on drums for the Victorian shows.

Early in 2020, in an interview with &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Hanna stated that the band had no plans at the time to create new material.

<text>Sleep is an American stoner/doom metal band from San Jose, California. Guitarist Matt Pike and bassist and vocalist Al Cisneros have been the only constant members throughout the band&#x27;s history. Critic Eduardo Rivadavia describes them as &quot;perhaps the ultimate stoner rock band&quot; and notes they exerted a strong influence on metal in the 1990s. 

The band released their debut album, &quot;Volume One&quot;, in 1991, after which original fourth member Justin Marler left. Sleep gained wider attention with their second album, &quot;Sleep&#x27;s Holy Mountain&quot;, in 1992. However, conflict with the band&#x27;s record company contributed to their breakup by the end of the decade. Their third album, &quot;Dopesmoker&quot;, was released after the band&#x27;s dissolution; both &quot;Holy Mountain&quot; and &quot;Dopesmoker&quot; have been acclaimed as doom metal and stoner metal classics. The band reformed in 2009 and have played sporadic live dates internationally since, with Neurosis drummer Jason Roeder replacing original member Chris Hakius. In 2018, Sleep surprise-released their comeback album, &quot;The Sciences&quot;, on Third Man Records, to further critical acclaim.

==History==
===Early years===
Sleep evolved in the early 1990s from the band Asbestosdeath, which was established by vocalist/bassist Al Cisneros, drummer Chris Hakius, and guitarist Tom Choi. Asbestosdeath expanded to a quartet with the introduction of Matt Pike on guitar, and recorded two singles - &quot;Dejection&quot; for Profane Existence and the self-released &quot;Unclean&quot;. Choi departed, and later founded Operator Generator, It Is I, Noothgrush, and Las Vegas&#x27; Black Jetts. Asbestosdeath recruited Justin Marler as replacement and the band adopted the new name, Sleep.

===Recording era===

Their debut album &quot;Volume One&quot; was released in 1991. Frequently compared to bands like Saint Vitus, Sleep soon gained a devoted fanbase within the developing doom metal scene. Marler quit the band soon after to take up life as an Eastern Orthodox monk, leaving the band as a power trio for the recording of their &quot;Volume Two&quot; EP, which was released officially by Off the Disk Records in 1991.

The band&#x27;s next album was sent to the independent label Earache as a demo. Recorded at Razors Edge studios in San Francisco, with Billy Anderson as engineer, the tape showcased Sleep&#x27;s love of all things retro, from the blatant Black Sabbath/Blue Cheer influences, to their fixation with 1970&#x27;s-style tube amplification. The label immediately signed the band and released the tape exactly as it was received.

&quot;Sleep&#x27;s Holy Mountain&quot; (1992) is widely considered the seminal album in the evolution of stoner metal. The album&#x27;s release was followed by a potentially lucrative offer from London Records, and Sleep signed with them. Around this time, Earache released its first Black Sabbath tribute album, and Sleep contributed a cover of &quot;Snowblind&quot;.

Under their new contract, Sleep began work on its third album, &quot;Dopesmoker&quot;, in 1995. Much to the dismay of executives at London Records, &quot;Dopesmoker&quot; was a single song, over an hour long. London Records declared the album unmarketable and refused to release it. The label had it remixed and cut up into sections by David Sardy, which led to a deadlock due to the band being unhappy with the result. Frustrated and generally unhappy with the situation, the members of Sleep decided to disband.

===Post-breakup===
In 1998, Sleep released &quot;Jerusalem&quot; as an &quot;official bootleg&quot;. One year later, &quot;Jerusalem&quot; was given an official legitimate release by The Music Cartel in the US and Rise Above Records in Europe.

Finally, in 2003 the original version of &quot;Dopesmoker&quot; was officially released by Tee Pee Records. It is generally considered the definitive version of the album. An excerpted version can be heard on Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Broken Flowers&quot; original soundtrack.
Cisneros and Hakius later formed the doom metal band Om, while Pike formed sludge metal band High on Fire.

In 2007 a CD compilation of both 7-inch releases of the pre-Sleep band Asbestosdeath was released on Southern Lord Records.

===Reunion and &quot;The Sciences&quot;===

In May 2009, Sleep reformed to perform two exclusive reunion sets in Britain as part of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties music festival. During these shows, the band performed an unheard song that had been written during the &quot;Dopesmoker&quot; recording sessions, titled &quot;Antarcticans Thawed,&quot; for the first time.

After the band&#x27;s initial reunion performance, original drummer Chris Hakius decided to retire from music to raise a family, and he was replaced on drums by Jason Roeder of experimental metal band Neurosis. The reconfigured lineup played the ATP New York 2010 music festival in Monticello, New York, where it performed &quot;Holy Mountain&quot; in its entirety. The band followed up this performance with a tour of the rest of the United States, playing headlining dates and festivals, through September.

From 2010 onward, Sleep performed similar sporadic festival and touring engagements when the members&#x27; otherwise busy touring schedules permitted. In late 2012, in conjunction with an upcoming appearance at Maryland Deathfest, the band stated that it considers Sleep to be a &quot;full, reunited band.&quot; In 2014, Al Cisneros announced in an interview that the band was working on a new record. On July 21, 2014, a new song titled &quot;The Clarity&quot; was released via Adult Swim Singles.

In November 2017 the band members posted a message in Morse code stating that they had almost finished recording material for a new album. On April 19, 2018, the band announced &quot;The Sciences&quot;, their first album in nearly 20 years, to be released the next day on Third Man Records. The release of &quot;The Sciences&quot; was a surprise, being released the day after it was announced, and created a lot of excitement within their fanbase. The album&#x27;s release date, April 20, 2018, was also Record Store Day weekend. Third Man Records released a limited edition split-colored vinyl with an alternate cover to be sold at a limited number of record stores in the US on the release date. The album was met with critical acclaim. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote in their review, &quot;[The Sciences] makes everything that was originally great about Sleep even better.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; declared that the record gives &quot;stoner-metal acolytes a bonafide miracle.&quot;

On May 23, 2018, Sleep released a new song titled &quot;Leagues Beneath&quot; through Adult Swim Singles and Third Man Records.

On November 11, 2019, the band announced an indefinite hiatus.

In early 2022, the band announced a return to live shows.

In an Instagram post dated January 30, 2025, drummer Jason Roeder announced he had been fired from the band by its manager in November of the previous year, and that he had not spoken to the other members of the band in the months leading to his firing. 

==Style and influences==
Musically, Sleep&#x27;s sound has been characterized as stoner rock built upon slow, down-tuned bass playing alongside similarly low guitar riffs. Repetition is frequently employed, working to create a &quot;hypnotic state&quot; supplemented by Al Cisneros&#x27; vocals.

Sleep has used cannabis-influenced imagery since the release of their second album, often delivered in a &quot;quasi-religious&quot; manner. In an interview about the making of &quot;Dopesmoker&quot;, Matt Pike acknowledged that the band spent &quot;a lot&quot; of their label advance on cannabis, and &quot;a lot of time.&quot; Pike also said that about $75,000 was spent on customized amplifiers so the album would have numerous tone layers. He said the songwriting process for &quot;Dopesmoker&quot; was long, with the band &quot;working on [the song] for like four years.&quot; Al Cisneros stated that smoking cannabis was vital to the song&#x27;s creative process: &quot;I was really dependent on the space I got into when I was using it [...] The line, &#x27;Drop out of life [with bong in hand],&#x27; was kind of a creed at that point.&quot;

Their record &quot;The Sciences&quot; makes multiple allusions to Black Sabbath, whose sound heavily inspired Sleep. Tony Iommi is referenced in the lyrics of &quot;Marijuanaut&#x27;s Theme&quot;, and the song &quot;Giza Butler&quot; is a play on the city Giza and the name of Black Sabbath&#x27;s bassist, Geezer Butler. Also in &quot;Giza Butler&quot;, references are made to several things in Frank Herbert&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;Dune&quot;, including the gom jabbar (referred to as the &quot;bong jabbar&quot;) and Muad&#x27;Dib (as &quot;Muad&#x27;Doob&quot;).

<doc id="209019" wikidata="Q6889949" url="?curid=209019" title="Moe (band)">
<text>Moe (stylized as moe.) is an American jam rock band, formed at the University at Buffalo in 1989. The band members are Rob Derhak (bass, vocals), Al Schnier (guitar, vocals, keyboard), Chuck Garvey (guitar, vocals), Vinnie Amico (drums), Jim Loughlin (percussion) and Nate Wilson (keyboard).

The band&#x27;s first record, &quot;Fatboy&quot; (1992), established the band as a favorite of the 1990s jam band and improvisational rock scene, which grew in popularity with the rise of bands such as Phish and Widespread Panic. 

Moe toured with the Furthur Festival in 1997, appeared at Woodstock &#x27;99, played Summerstage at the Rumsey Playfield in Central Park, opened for The Allman Brothers and The Who, performed at Radio City Music Hall on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2006 and returned there for New Year&#x27;s Eve 2007. They have also performed at Bonnaroo Music Festival five times (2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2009).

==History==
The origin of the band goes back as far as October 1989, when Chuck Garvey, Rob Derhak, and Ray Schwartz got together to play a Halloween show at a friend&#x27;s behest. The band&#x27;s first true form began in the winter of 1990. Chuck was joined by Dave Kessler on guitar and Steve Hunter joined on saxophone and vocals. They called themselves &quot;Five Guys named Moe,&quot; the name of a Louis Jordan song. They opened for a band named Monkey Wrench at Broadway Joe&#x27;s in Buffalo, New York. Monkey Wrench would later be mentioned in Moe&#x27;s song &quot;Y.O.Y.,&quot; where Garvey sings &quot;I wish I could suck like Monkey Wrench.&quot;

In the fall of 1990, Hunter exited. Also, the band&#x27;s name evolved first into &quot;Haggis&quot; (for one week) before settling to be simply &quot;Moe&quot;, noticeably without the period. Derhak pushed for the &quot;m&quot; to be capitalized, but a Brooklyn band had that name already.

Al Schnier sat in with the band for a show in 1991 in Buffalo when Kessler was absent. After this show, Schnier was a frequent guest. They became known as the &quot;moe guitar army&quot; because of the three guitarists. It was around this time that the band also officially adopted the period at the end of its name. Schnier joined Moe full-time in early 1992 and in the spring, Kessler left due to a lack of interest.

After recording a series of cassette-only releases in 1991, all of which are impossible to find, in June 1992, the band recorded &quot;Fatboy&quot;, after which Schwartz left the band to go to graduate school. Jim Loughlin joined Moe in September, on drums. During the summer of 1993, Chuck quit the band due to personal issues, but returned two months later and &quot;begged for re-admittance and more abuse.&quot;

In the spring of 1994, Moe recorded &quot;Headseed&quot;, officially quitting their day jobs, and they all moved to Albany, New York. Loughlin left in June 1995 to pursue a band named Yolk, from Binghamton, New York. After Loughlin left, Mike Strazza joined on drums, but only from July until the end of 1995, though he officially quit in September. During their two nights over Thanksgiving weekend at the Wetlands in New York City, Moe recorded &quot;Loaf&quot;, their first official live release, on which Strazza appears. Chris Mazur joined the band on drums from late 1995 through November 1996, and appeared on the album, &quot;No Doy&quot;.

On November 21, 1996, at The Bayou, in Washington D.C., Vinnie Amico made his debut behind the drumkit and has continued in that position ever since. In 1998, the band really hit their stride as a four-piece, playing nearly 100 shows and recording their fourth album, &quot;Tin Cans And Car Tires&quot;. In early 1999, Jim Loughlin returned to the lineup on percussion, vibraphone, xylophone, flute, backup bass, acoustic guitar, vocals, and washboard. Since January 23, 1999, the band Moe has officially been Al Schnier, Chuck Garvey, Rob Derhak, Vinnie Amico, and Jim Loughlin.

Signing with Sony/550 Music, Moe released their third album, &quot;No Doy&quot; in 1996, and 1998 saw the release of &quot;Tin Cans And Car Tires&quot;, which featured Vinnie Amico&#x27;s first recordings with the band. Upon leaving Sony in 2000, Moe revived Fatboy Records and issued its second live album, &quot;L&quot;. In 2001, Moe launched the &quot;Warts &amp; All&quot; series of complete live performances, released as multi-CD sets. Six such volumes were released between 2001-2008, on Fatboy Records, before the series was retitled &quot;Dr. Stan&#x27;s Prescription&quot;, for two further volumes.

2001 also saw the release of &quot;Dither&quot;, which featured several road-tested originals as well as a cover of &quot;In a Big Country&quot;, by Scottish rockers Big Country, while 2002 brought forth the Christmas album, &quot;Season&#x27;s Greetings from Moe&quot;, featuring two original seasonal songs as well as several holiday standards.

For 2003&#x27;s &quot;Wormwood&quot; and 2007&#x27;s &quot;The Conch&quot; Moe utilized several live recordings of new songs as the foundation for studio experimentation, with the results mimicking the band&#x27;s freewheeling live performances. The ninth Moe album, 2008&#x27;s &quot;Sticks &amp; Stones&quot;, focused primarily on material that had never been performed live, a first for the band. Moe released their first &quot;best-of&quot; in 2010, &quot;Smash Hits Volume&quot; &quot;One&quot;, which features re-recordings of songs from the Sony era, as well as tracks from their more recent albums. 2012 found Moe inking a deal with Sugar Hill Records and releasing their tenth album, &quot;What Happened To The La Las&quot;, while &quot;No Guts No Glory&quot; followed in 2014.

Moe announced an indefinite hiatus beginning August 1, 2017, while bassist Rob Derhak underwent treatment for oropharyngeal cancer. Derhak was declared cancer-free in December 2017 which coincided with Moe announcing a 2018 return to live performance.

Moe returned to the stage, at the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, New York, on February 2, 2018, and have since resumed a regular touring schedule. Schnier has said that Derhak has brought a new perspective to the band in light of his life-threatening illness since his return.

==Fundraising==
The band has taken part in a number of fundraising efforts. Moe held a tsunami benefit concert at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City on February 10, 2005. Sharing the stage were Sam Bush; John Medeski of Medeski, Martin, and Wood; Trey Anastasio; and Anastasio collaborator Jennifer Hartswick. All proceeds from the event were matched by the Dave Matthews Band and his Bama Works Village Recovery Fund to assist rebuilding an east coast sea town in Sri Lanka. Bama Works, Dave&#x27;s philanthropic brainchild, recorded a final tally of $155,000. The performance garnered Moe an award for &quot;Live Performance of the Year&quot; at the 6th Annual Jammy Awards.

On January 22, 2006, Moe performed at the Landmark Theatre in Syracuse, New York. This concert raised $35,000 in support of the Kelberman Center, a comprehensive community resource for individuals with autism spectrum disorder and their families. The evenings proceeds brought Moe&#x27;s charitable contributions to over $200,000 between January 2005 and January 2006. Al Schnier said about the Kelberman Center:
On April 11, 2006, Moe donated $38,000 to the Kelberman Center as part of &quot;The Face of Autism&quot; telethon.

On January 22, 2010, Moe held another benefit concert at Roseland Ballroom in New York, raising funds for WHY (World Hunger Year). This show was also their first of 2010, and of the tour. Guests included Danny Barnes (banjo), Marco Benevento (keyboards), Jeff Austin (mandolin), Butch Trucks (drums), and David Sanborn (saxophone).

==Festivals==

===Moe.lennium===
Moe rang in the new millennium with three nights at The Chance in Poughkeepsie, New York, December 29–31, 1999.

===Moe. or Les===
Moe hosted a festival in 2002 with 2 nights at Marvin&#x27;s Magical Mountaintop in Masontown, West Virginia, alongside Colonel Les Claypool&#x27;s Fearless Flying Frog Brigade. Friday and Saturday nights featured 1 set of moe., 1 set of the frog brigade, then another set of moe. This festival was the first festival held at Marvin&#x27;s Magical Mountaintop, to which bassist Rob Derhak noted, and mentioned they ought to make a return. Later that year, it was announced All Good festival would call Marvin&#x27;s Magical Mountaintop its annual home starting in 2003, with moe. being the featured headliner for many of the 2000s era All Goods.

===moe.down===
Moe hosts the semi annual festival &quot;moe.down&quot; at Snow Ridge Ski Area in Turin, New York. Started in 2000, the festival runs for three days and occurs every Labor Day weekend. In 2017 and 2019 the festival occurred during the Fourth of July holiday. The festival has attracted a wide variety of musical talent. Acts range from newer bands just emerging onto the scene (such as Tea Leaf Green, Nellie McKay and Raq) to big-name acts and jam rock staples, such as Les Claypool, Blues Traveler, and Mike Gordon (of Phish), to pop rock icons such as Leo Kottke, The Flaming Lips, The Violent Femmes, and Perry Farrell. Each year, the amount of Moe.down attendees has steadily increased: The first Moe.down drew around 3,000 people while Moe.down VI in 2005 had close to 7,000, and 12,000 at Moedown 9.

After ten years in Turin, moe.down moved to the Gelston Castle Estate in Mohawk, New York, for two years. In 2012, the event moved back to Turin, with the dates changing to August 10–12. On January 19, 2015, Moe announced that after 15 years moe.down would be postponed indefinitely.

In 2017, the band announced the return of moe.down, pared down into a less-bloated, &quot;return to roots&quot; format.

On April 3, 2019, Moe announced the lineup for their 2019 moe.down running July 4–6 at the Snow Ridge Ski Resort in Turin, New York.

===Snoe.down===
Moe hosted snoe.down II March 17, 2006 through March 19, 2006. This event, which kicked off the week-long Adirondack Almost Springfest celebration, took place at the Olympic Center in Lake Placid, New York, and at nearby Whiteface. During the concerts (though not during Moe&#x27;s sets) fans had the option of ice skating while listening to the show. Bands included Soulive, Everyone Orchestra, Assembly of Dust, and Tea Leaf Green. Chuck said about snoe.down II:

===Moe cruise===
From March 7, 2004 until March 14, 2004, Moe embarked on their first musical cruise aboard the &quot;Norwegian Sun&quot; through Les and Lynn Berger of Rhythms at Sea Cruises (formerly Rock the Boat Cruises). Setting out from Miami, the Norwegian Sun visited Jamaica, The Cayman Islands, Costa Maya, and Cozumel before returning to Florida. The band performed each day except for the 12th, on the pool deck, Stardust Lounge, and the Observation Lounge. The shows on the 10th in the Observation Lounge were acoustic sets featuring questions and answer sessions with the band.

In January 2007, the band returned for its second cruise, again through Les and Lynn Berger of Rhythms at Sea Cruises. The cruise took place January 7, 2007 through January 14, 2007 on the &quot;Norwegian Jewel&quot;. Fans were treated to a different itinerary this time: the ship headed east out of Miami and hit the ports of San Juan (Puerto Rico), St. John&#x27;s (Antigua), and St. Thomas (US Virgin Islands). Unfortunately due to rough seas, the ship did not port at the Great Stirrup Cay (Bahamas).

<text>The Obsessed is an American doom metal band from Potomac, Maryland, led by Scott &quot;Wino&quot; Weinrich. Formed in 1979, they recorded a few demos and played a handful of live shows until they first split up in 1986 when Weinrich joined as lead vocalist for Saint Vitus. About two years before his departure from Saint Vitus, Weinrich reformed The Obsessed in 1989, and three studio albums − &quot;The Obsessed&quot; (1990), &quot;Lunar Womb&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Church Within&quot; (1994) − were released before disbanding for the second time in 1995. After reuniting for occasional live shows between 2011 and 2013, the band announced a permanent reunion in March 2016, and has since released two more studio albums: &quot;Sacred&quot; (2017) and &quot;Gilded Sorrow&quot; (2024).

== History ==
=== Early career (1976–1985) ===
The band formed originally under the name &quot;Warhorse&quot; in 1976 in Potomac, Maryland, led by Wino. In the late 1970s, Wino&#x27;s band became known as the Leather Nunz. The band played original punk tunes with singer Billy Beam, Jeff Urban on drums, Robert Krug on rhythm guitar and Mark Laue on bass.

Later on, a new more focused and improved group moved into a band house in Rockville, Maryland and renamed the Obsessed, where some of their most creative and hardest music was written. Before this move, however, original guitar player John Reese and Davey WIlliams on drums departed from the band. The band became a trio and remained that way until 1982 when Vance Bockis and later Norman Lawson joined the band. During this time they released the &quot;Sodden Jackal&quot; EP (spring 1983) and had one track (&quot;Concrete Cancer&quot;) featured on Metal Blade&#x27;s &quot;Metal Massacre VI&quot;. The Obsessed also managed to record their debut album in 1985 for Metal Blade, but it never officially surfaced.

=== Splits, first reunion and aftermath (1986–2010) ===
The band broke up in the late 1980s and Wino went west to California to join up with Saint Vitus. Wino recorded three albums, an EP, and a live album with Saint Vitus. Around 1989, the Obsessed reformed and signed to Hellhound Records (Vitus&#x27;s then current label), which released &quot;The Obsessed&quot; (originally recorded in 1985) in the following year. This prompted Wino to leave Vitus and focus on the Obsessed full-time, with a new rhythm section consisting of Scott Reeder and Greg Rogers. The band was quickly signed to Hellhound Records and soon released &quot;Lunar Womb&quot;. Scott Reeder later left to join Kyuss, whereupon he was replaced by Guy Pinhas. After the addition of Pinhas, the Obsessed signed with Columbia Records, through which they released their third album &quot;The Church Within&quot; to strong critical reviews. To promote &quot;The Church Within&quot;, the band toured as an opening act for Entombed and Unsane during the first part of 1994. Despite the tour, as well as a large amount of promotion on behalf of Columbia Records (including a 25-minute documentary on the history of the Obsessed), the album did not sell as well as expected. After the demise of the Obsessed, Wino went on to form Shine which changed name to Spirit Caravan and more projects before reuniting with Saint Vitus in 2003 (and again in 2008), while the Obsessed&#x27;s rhythm section became the basis for Goatsnake.

=== Reunions (2011–present) ===
In September 2011, the Roadburn Festival announced that &quot;The Church Within&quot; lineup (featuring Wino, Greg Rogers and Guy Pinhas) would be reuniting to play their next edition on April 14, 2012. The band later confirmed they would be performing at the Hellfest Open Air 2012. The band performed yet another reunion show at Maryland Death fest XI in May 2013 featuring Wino, Greg Rogers and Reid Raley.

TKO Records re-released the self-titled 7&quot; on November 23, 2012.

Wino announced the full-time return of the Obsessed in March 2016 and the band&#x27;s official signing to Relapse Records to record the follow-up to &quot;The Church Within&quot;. The new lineup originally consisted of Spirit Caravan bassist Dave Sherman and Wino&#x27;s longtime friend and former road crew member Brian Costantino (drums). On October 31, 2016, Wino announced that The Obsessed would test the waters for the remainder of 2016 by adding Bruce Falkinburg on bass and Seraphim on guitar, making this the first time in over 35 years that the Obsessed have been a four piece band.

In April 2017, the band released &quot;Sacred&quot;, their first studio album in 23 years. Their next album, &quot;Gilded Sorrow&quot;, was released on February 16, 2024.

<text>Streptomycin is an antibiotic medication used to treat a number of bacterial infections, including tuberculosis, &quot;Mycobacterium avium&quot; complex, endocarditis, brucellosis, &quot;Burkholderia&quot; infection, plague, tularemia, and rat bite fever. For active tuberculosis it is often given together with isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide. It is administered by injection into a vein or muscle.
Common side effects include vertigo, vomiting, numbness of the face, fever, and rash. Use during pregnancy may result in permanent deafness in the developing baby. Use appears to be safe while breastfeeding. It is not recommended in people with myasthenia gravis or other neuromuscular disorders. Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside. It works by blocking the ability of 30S ribosomal subunits to make proteins, which results in bacterial death.
Albert Schatz first isolated streptomycin in 1943 from &quot;Streptomyces griseus&quot;. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies it as critically important for human medicine.

== Uses ==
=== Medication ===
* Infective endocarditis: An infection of the endocardium caused by enterococcus; used when the organism is not sensitive to gentamicin
* Tuberculosis: Used in combination with other antibiotics. For active tuberculosis it is often given together with isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide. It is not the first-line treatment, except in medically under-served populations where the cost of more expensive treatments is prohibitive. It may be useful in cases where resistance to other drugs is identified.
* Plague (&quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;): Has historically been used as the first-line treatment. However streptomycin is approved for this purpose only by the US Food and Drug Administration.
* In veterinary medicine, streptomycin is the first-line antibiotic for use against gram negative bacteria in large animals (horses, cattle, sheep, etc.). It is commonly combined with procaine penicillin for intramuscular injection.
* Tularemia infections have been treated mostly with streptomycin.

Streptomycin is traditionally given intramuscularly, and in many nations is only licensed to be administered intramuscularly, though in some regions the drug may also be administered intravenously.

=== Pesticide ===
Streptomycin also is used as a pesticide, to combat the growth of bacteria beyond human applications. Streptomycin controls bacterial diseases of certain fruit, vegetables, seed, and ornamental crops. A major use is in the control of fireblight on apple and pear trees. As in medical applications, extensive use can be associated with the development of resistant strains. Streptomycin could potentially be used to control cyanobacterial blooms in ornamental ponds and aquaria. While some antibacterial antibiotics are inhibitory to certain eukaryotes, this seems not to be the case for streptomycin, especially in the case of anti-fungal activity.

=== Cell culture ===
Streptomycin, in combination with penicillin, is used in a standard antibiotic cocktail to prevent bacterial infection in cell culture.

===Protein purification===
When purifying protein from a biological extract, streptomycin sulfate is sometimes added as a means of removing nucleic acids and ribonuclear proteins. Since it binds to ribosomes and precipitates out of solution, it serves as a method for removing rRNA, mRNA, and even DNA if the extract is from a prokaryote.

==Side effects==
The most concerning side effects, as with other aminoglycosides, are kidney toxicity and ear toxicity. Transient or permanent deafness may result. The vestibular portion of cranial nerve VIII (the vestibulocochlear nerve) can be affected, resulting in tinnitus, vertigo, ataxia, kidney toxicity, and can potentially interfere with diagnosis of kidney malfunction.

Common side effects include vertigo, vomiting, numbness of the face, fever, and rash. Fever and rashes may result from persistent use.

Use is not recommended during pregnancy. Congenital deafness has been reported in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Use appears to be okay while breastfeeding.

It is not recommended in people with myasthenia gravis.

==Mechanism of action==
Streptomycin functions as a protein synthesis inhibitor. It binds to the small 16S rRNA of the 30S ribosomal subunit irreversibly, interfering with the binding of formyl-methionyl-tRNA to the 30S subunit. This causes codon misreading, inhibition of protein synthesis, and ultimately death of the cell through mechanisms that are not well understood. Speculation indicates that the binding of the molecule to the 30S subunit interferes with 30S subunit association with the mRNA strand. This results in an unstable ribosomal-mRNA complex, leading to premature stopping of protein synthesis, leading to cell death. As human and bacteria both have ribosomes, streptomycin has significant side effects in humans. At low concentrations, however, streptomycin inhibits only bacterial growth.

Streptomycin is an antibiotic that inhibits both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and is therefore a useful broad-spectrum antibiotic.

==History==
Streptomycin was first isolated on October 19, 1943, by Albert Schatz, a PhD student in the laboratory of Selman Abraham Waksman at Rutgers University in a research project funded by Merck and Co. Waksman and his laboratory staff discovered several antibiotics, including actinomycin, clavacin, streptothricin, streptomycin, grisein, neomycin, fradicin, candicidin, and candidin. Of these, streptomycin and neomycin found extensive application in the treatment of numerous infectious diseases. Streptomycin was the first antibiotic cure for tuberculosis (TB). In 1952 Waksman was the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in recognition &quot;for his discovery of streptomycin, the first antibiotic active against tuberculosis&quot;. Waksman was later accused of playing down the role of Schatz who did the work under his supervision, claiming that Elizabeth Bugie had a more important role in its development. Schatz sued both Dr. Waksman and the Rutgers Research and Endowment Foundation, wanting to be given credit as co-discover and to receive the royalties for the streptomycin. By the end of the settlement, Waksman would receive a 10% royalty, while Schatz got 3% and compensation for his missed royalties. The rest of the lab shared the remaining 7% of the royalties, in which Bugie received 0.2%.

Bugie was pursuing a master&#x27;s degree in Waksman&#x27;s lab at Rutgers University at this time. Prior to this, she received her bachelor&#x27;s degree in microbiology at New Jersey College for Women. Although Bugie was considered to be the second author on the &quot;Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology&quot; paper, she was not listed on the patent submission. Bugie&#x27;s contributions to Waksman&#x27;s lab were great. In addition to her work on streptomycin, she also helped develop other antimicrobial substances, had two peer-reviewed publications, and researched the use of antimicrobials against plant pathogens, among several other important contributions to the scientific field, particularly in regard to microbiology.

The Rutgers team reported streptomycin in the medical literature in January 1944. Within months they began working with William Feldman and H. Corwin Hinshaw of the Mayo Clinic with hopes of starting a human clinical trial of streptomycin in tuberculosis. The difficulty at first was even producing enough streptomycin to do a trial, because the research laboratory methods of creating small batches had not yet been translated to commercial large-batch production. They managed to do an animal study in a few guinea pigs with just 10 grams of the scarce drug, demonstrating survival. This was just enough evidence to get Merck &amp; Co. to divert some resources from the young penicillin production program to start work toward streptomycin production.

At the end of World War II, the United States Army experimented with streptomycin to treat life-threatening infections at a military hospital in Battle Creek, Michigan. The first person who was treated with streptomycin did not survive; the second person survived but became blind as a side effect of the treatment. In March 1946, the third person—Robert J. Dole, later Majority Leader of the United States Senate and presidential nominee—experienced a rapid and robust recovery.

The first randomized trial of streptomycin against pulmonary tuberculosis was carried out in 1946 through 1948 by the MRC Tuberculosis Research Unit under the chairmanship of Geoffrey Marshall (1887–1982). The trial was neither double-blind nor placebo-controlled. It is widely accepted to have been the first randomized curative trial.

Results showed efficacy against TB, albeit with minor toxicity and acquired bacterial resistance to the drug.

=== New Jersey ===
Because streptomycin was isolated from a microbe discovered on New Jersey soil, and because of its activity against tuberculosis and Gram negative organisms, and in recognition of both the microbe and the antibiotic in the history of New Jersey, &quot;S. griseus&quot; was nominated as the Official New Jersey state microbe. The draft legislation was submitted by Senator Sam Thompson (R-12) in May 2017 as bill S3190 and Assemblywoman Annette Quijano (D-20) in June 2017 as bill A31900. The bill was passed on 2018-01-08 The bill designates Streptomyces griseus as New Jersey State Microbe (New Jersey Senate Bill 3190 (2017). Governor Phil Murphy signed the bill making it official in 2019.

<text>Bratmobile is an American punk band from Olympia, Washington, formed in 1991. They are known for being one of the first-generation &quot;riot grrrl&quot; bands. The band was influenced by several eclectic musical styles, including elements of pop, surf, and garage rock.

== Beginnings ==
Allison Wolfe (from Olympia, Washington) and Molly Neuman (from Washington, D.C.) met during fall 1989 while living next door to each other in dorms at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon. The two had been raised in activist families: Wolfe had been raised by a lesbian activist mother, and Neuman&#x27;s father worked for the Democratic National Committee and had introduced his daughter to leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC). Their shared musical influences included punk, hip hop, and the Olympia band Beat Happening. Neuman was influenced by the writings of Eldridge Cleaver. Together, Neuman and Wolfe took classes in women&#x27;s studies and music, traveled to Olympia on the weekends, and started collaborating on influential feminist fanzine &quot;Girl Germs&quot; in 1990.

== History ==

=== 1990–1991: Origins ===
Neuman&#x27;s and Wolfe&#x27;s friend Calvin Johnson, an indie musician in the Olympia scene in The Go Team and Beat Happening who also co-owned K Records, asked them to play a show in Olympia on Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1991 with Bikini Kill and Some Velvet Sidewalk. At first, Wolfe admitted that they were &quot;a fake band&quot; because they did not play instruments, but they had written some songs which they performed a cappella. After an attempt to get out of the gig, they agreed and sought the help of Some Velvet Sidewalk member Robert Christie. Christie let Bratmobile borrow rehearsal space and equipment and advised them to listen to the Ramones for inspiration. In response to that advice, Wolfe said, &quot;Something in me clicked. Like, okay, if most boy punk rock bands just listen to the Ramones and that&#x27;s how they write their songs, then we&#x27;ll do the opposite and I won&#x27;t listen to any Ramones and that way we&#x27;ll sound different.&quot; With five original songs, the band played its first show as a two-woman act at Olympia&#x27;s North Shore Surf Club on February 14, 1991, with Neuman and Wolfe sharing duties on guitar, drums, and vocals. They recorded the next day for the first Kill Rock Stars compilation, which was released later that year. Briefly, they were joined by a bass player Michelle Noel. They played only a couple shows with this line-up, including one with The Melvins and Beat Happening, also at the Surf Club on May 16, 1991.

Initially, Wolfe and Neuman thought of Bratmobile as a loose organization that would have different branches in different cities. During spring break 1991, Neuman and Wolfe went to Washington, D.C., to work on this new form of Bratmobile that, at that time, included different musicians Erin Smith on guitar, Christina Billotte of Autoclave on drums and bass, and artist Jen Smith (no relation to Erin). Johnson had previously introduced Neuman to nascent guitarist Erin Smith from Bethesda, Maryland, during the Christmas holiday in December, 1990 at a Nation of Ulysses show in D.C. Erin Smith was co-author, with her brother, of the much-revered TV pop culture fanzine &quot;Teenage Gang Debs&quot; when Neuman and Wolfe asked her to jam with them. They rehearsed at the Embassy, a group house in D.C. that served as headquarters for the Nation of Ulysses. When Beat Happening, Nation of Ulysses, and Autoclave toured the east coast that spring, Bratmobile DC had its first performance at Maxwell&#x27;s in Hoboken, New Jersey. The newly minted Bratmobile DC lineup of Neuman, Wolfe, Erin Smith, and Billotte spontaneously got on stage. Back in D.C., they recorded with Tim Green of Nation of Ulysses in the Embassy&#x27;s basement studio. Around this time, Jen Smith, who lived at the Embassy, recorded with Bratmobile DC and played a show with them.

This lineup with Billotte and Jen Smith released a cassette tape entitled &quot;Bratmobile DC&quot;. Thereafter, Bratmobile became a trio with Wolfe, Neuman, and Erin Smith.

=== 1991–1994: &quot;Pottymouth&quot; and breakup ===
Bikini Kill toured with Nation of Ulysses in May &amp; June 1991, converging in D.C. with Bratmobile that summer. In July 1991, Bratmobile played their first show as a 3-piece with Neuman on drums, Wolfe on vocals, and Erin Smith on guitar. Bratmobile were just in time to play at the historic International Pop Underground Convention in Olympia in August 1991, becoming the only band to appear twice. They played the opening show &quot;Girl Night&quot;. They also played a show at Capitol Lake Park on a bill with Melvins, Mecca Normal, Girl Trouble, Beat Happening, and Fugazi. During the summer of 1992, Bratmobile toured with Heavens to Betsy. Bratmobile released the album &quot;Pottymouth&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Real Janelle&quot; EP (1994) on Kill Rock Stars, as well as &quot;The Peel Session&quot;.

On May 7, 1994, under the backdrop of intense media scrutiny and inner pressures within the riot grrrl movement, Bratmobile infamously broke up onstage at the Thread Waxing Space in New York City. With the members of Bratmobile already stressed from a lack of practice and having to perform in front of several high-profile individuals, several women in the audience stole the band&#x27;s microphone to accuse a male audience member of assault whilst also criticizing Bratmobile&#x27;s failure to provide a safe space, thereby &quot;[stopping] the show for a span of time at least as long as [the band] eventually played&quot;, according to &quot;Spin&quot; journalist Ann Powers. Wolfe said: &quot;All of a sudden not only was I supposed to serve as talent that night, I was also supposed to serve as club manager and security! [...] everybody was screaming at each other. It was like slapstick comedy or some kind of crazy performance art, and we just broke up&quot;.

=== 1994–1999: Hiatus ===
After the break-up, Molly Neuman moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and began working at East Bay punk record label Lookout! Records. She also played in The PeeChees and The Frumpies. Allison Wolfe moved to Washington, D.C., and she and Maryland-based Erin Smith started a new band together called Cold Cold Hearts. Wolfe has also been active in feminism and activism.

=== 1999–2003: Reformation and second breakup ===
In 1999, the band decided to reunite for a low-key show in Oakland&#x27;s Stork Club and the band was relaunched to go on tour with Sleater-Kinney.

In 2000, Bratmobile released their second full-length studio album, &quot;Ladies, Women and Girls&quot;. The album was well-received by critics and earned Bratmobile new fans as they toured with Sleater-Kinney, The Donnas, The Locust, among others. &quot;Ladies, Women and Girls&quot; was released on Neuman&#x27;s Lookout! Records and produced by Tim Green of Nation of Ulysses and The Fucking Champs. Jon Nikki (Prima Donnas, Gene Defcon, Mocket, Sarah Dougher, Sir, Puce Moment) added guitar, bass and keyboard parts to the minimal Brat sound.

On May 7, 2002, Bratmobile released their third album, &quot;Girls Get Busy&quot;. On &quot;Girls Get Busy&quot;, Audrey Marrs, (Mocket, Gene Defcon) added keyboards that gave the album its distinctive new sound. Marty Violence (Young Pioneers) also contributed bass.

After dedicating most of 2002 and 2003 to promoting &quot;Girls Get Busy&quot; via touring, each of the principal members went back to do other things. While the band didn&#x27;t formally break up, Allison Wolfe did post a message on January 30, 2004, in the Bratmobile message board concerning the status of the band:

In 2018, Kill Rock Stars produced a podcast series about Bratmobile titled &quot;Girl Germs&quot;.

=== 2019–present: Reunions ===
In 2019, Bratmobile&#x27;s original lineup reunited to perform at Tobi Vail&#x27;s birthday party. In 2023, Wolfe and Neuman reformed Bratmobile again to perform at the Mosswood Meltdown festival in Oakland, California, where they were joined by Tiger Trap’s Rose Melberg on guitar, Marrs on keyboards, and Marty Key on bass. Erin was unable to join the band for this reunion due to &quot;other commitments&quot;.

<doc id="209025" wikidata="Q5306476" url="?curid=209025" title="Dream Warriors (band)">
<text>Dream Warriors were a Canadian hip hop duo from Toronto, Ontario, comprising King Lou and Capital Q. Described as &quot;a pair of deft, intelligent rappers&quot; by John Bush of AllMusic, they were major contributors to the jazz rap movement of the early 1990s. Their 1991 debut album, &quot;And Now the Legacy Begins&quot;, was cited by Bush as one of the finest alternative hip hop records of the golden era. Before the release of their second album &quot;Subliminal Simulation&quot; in 1994, the duo became a group with the addition of rapper Spek and DJ Luv. In 1996, they released a third album, &quot;The Master Plan&quot;, before the two new members left the group a year later. Though their subsequent releases did not garner similar commercial success as their debut, the duo released a well-received in 1999. Their final album, &quot;The Legacy Continues...&quot;, was released in 2002.

==History==
King Lou (Louis Robinson) and Capital Q (Frank Allert) formed Dream Warriors in 1988, hailing from the Jane and Finch and Willowdale neighbourhoods of Toronto. The same year, King Lou made his recording debut, appearing on Michie Mee and L.A. Luv&#x27;s single &quot;Victory Is Calling&quot;, which also featured MC Lyte. The duo began working on music together in 1989 and joined the Beat Factory Productions team. In 1990 they collaborated on the one-off single &quot;Can&#x27;t Repress the Cause&quot;, a plea for greater inclusion of hip hop music in the Canadian music scene, with Dance Appeal, a supergroup of Toronto-area musicians that included Devon, Maestro Fresh Wes, B-Kool, Michie Mee, Lillian Allen, Eria Fachin, HDV, Dionne, Thando Hyman, Carla Marshall, Messenjah, Jillian Mendez, Lorraine Scott, Lorraine Segato, Self Defense, Leroy Sibbles, Zama and Thyron Lee White.

They signed to 4th &amp; B&#x27;way/Island Records and released their jazz-influenced debut album &quot;And Now the Legacy Begins&quot; in 1991. The album was critically acclaimed and sold well in Canada, the United Kingdom, and across Europe — before becoming an underground hit in the United States.

The album spawned the hit singles &quot;Wash Your Face in My Sink&quot;, &quot;My Definition of a Boombastic Jazz Style&quot;, and &quot;Ludi&quot;. The first two singles hit the Top 20 in the UK, while in their own country, the album went gold and collected a Juno Award. The song &quot;My Definition of a Boombastic Jazz Style&quot; featured a sample of &quot;Soul Bossa Nova&quot; by Quincy Jones, which was the theme song for the Canadian game show &quot;Definition&quot;.

In 1992, they recorded &quot;Man Smart, Woman Smarter&quot; for the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; soundtrack.

For their 1994 follow-up, &quot;Subliminal Simulation&quot;, Dream Warriors added rapper Spek (Hussain Yoosuf) and DJ Luv (formerly L.A. Luv; Phillip Gayle), turning the duo into a four-man group. The album received mixed reviews. It featured an appearance by Butterfly of Digable Planets and Gang Starr (Guru and DJ Premier) contributed to two tracks. Early production by Da Grassroots is found on the track &quot;No Dingbats Allowed&quot;. Spoken word is also performed during the interludes. Two singles, &quot;Day in Day Out&quot; and &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot;, were released.

Dream Warriors released their third album &quot;The Master Plan&quot; in 1996, however, it was not released in the US. Three singles — &quot;Float On&quot;, &quot;What Do You Want &#x27;Ladies&#x27;?&quot;, and &quot;Sound Clash&quot; (featuring Beenie Man) — supported the album. Later that year, they recorded a hip-hop version of the song &quot;Edmonton Block Heater&quot;, which appeared on the compilation album &quot;A Tribute to Hard Core Logo&quot;. Spek left the group in 1997, before relocating to the UK. DJ Luv also left the group the same year. In 1999, &quot;&quot;, a greatest hits compilation, was released on Priority Records. It featured two new tracks by the original duo. The compilation was critically acclaimed, with Robert Christgau stating: &quot;Certainly they belong in the same sentence as De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest.&quot; That year, the band performed in Hamilton as part of Showcase &#x27;99.

In 2002, they released their final album, &quot;The Legacy Continues...&quot;, exclusively in Canada. The Herbaliser produced the single &quot;Road of Many Signs&quot;, which also appeared on their &quot;Very Mercenary&quot; album in 1999. Other singles included &quot;Breathe or Die&quot; and &quot;Unstoppable&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Icon&quot;, Dream Warriors&#x27; second compilation album, was released.

<doc id="209026" wikidata="Q844524" url="?curid=209026" title="Gang Starr">
<text>Gang Starr was an American hip hop duo, consisting of Houston-born record producer DJ Premier and Boston-based rapper Guru.

Gang Starr was at its height from 1989 to 2003, and is considered a widely influential MC-and-producer duo. They are recognized for being one of the pioneers of jazz rap active during the golden age of hip hop. Some of their top hits include &quot;Mass Appeal&quot;, &quot;Take It Personal&quot;, &quot;Moment of Truth&quot;, &quot;Full Clip&quot; and &quot;Above The Clouds&quot;.

==Career==

===Original &amp; second group lineups===
The original Gang Starr group was founded in Morehouse College by three friends from Boston, Massachusetts: Guru (then known as MC Keithy E.) who had planned to be a rapper/singer, Big Shug as the main MC and DJ Suave D (Shug&#x27;s younger brother Dana) as their DJ. After Shug was imprisoned, Suave D quit the group, leaving Guru to enlist the services of MC Damo D-Ski and DJ 1, 2 B-Down (also known as Mike Dee) with various producers, such as Donald D, J.V. Johnson or the 45 King helping out. Their earliest recordings were in 1986 where they made various demos. In 1987 and 1988, Gang Starr released three 12-inch vinyl singles on Wild Pitch Records.

===Breakup and partnering with DJ Premier===

In 1989, the group split for the second time and the only member willing to continue under the name was Guru. He got in touch with Houston, Texas native DJ Premier (then known as Waxmaster C) who sent him a beat tape, which Guru liked. He invited DJ Premier to join Gang Starr, relocate with him to Brooklyn and in that same year they released their first single &quot;Words I Manifest&quot; along with the album &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot; (1989). In 1990, the group was signed to the Chrysalis record label by then A&amp;R director Duff Marlowe, a former DJ and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; rap music critic. The label offered Guru and Premier unlimited artistic license and major-label distribution worldwide, a platform the group used to become one of the most influential hip hop acts of that decade. During their career Gang Starr helped pioneer the New York City hardcore hip hop sound. The Gang Starr catalog, especially &quot;Step in the Arena&quot; (1991), &quot;Daily Operation&quot; (1992), &quot;Hard to Earn&quot; (1994) and &quot;Moment of Truth&quot; (1998) are well respected among underground rap fans and critics. Their track &quot;Jazz Thing&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to Spike Lee&#x27;s film &quot;Mo&#x27; Better Blues&quot;. Gang Starr provided a track, &quot;Battle&quot;, for the soundtrack of the 2002 movie &quot;8 Mile&quot;.

After several albums and tours, in late 2002 DJ Premier left Europe to go back to the United States. Once again Guru was faced with continuing alone and became involved in a European tour in 2003–04 with an alternate DJ. In 2006, Guru indicated in several interviews that Gang Starr had reached its end.

===Guru&#x27;s death===
In February 2010, Guru suffered a heart attack, went into a coma, and died on April 19, 2010. DJ Solar, a long-time collaborator of Guru, said Guru chose not to go public with the diagnosis of myeloma that was made in 2000. Guru appeared to have fallen out with DJ Premier seven years prior to his death and did &quot;not wish my ex-DJ to have anything to do with my name, likeness, events, tributes, etc.&quot; There is speculation that the letter was not written by Guru, but was composed by Solar. The validity of the statement was questioned by Guru&#x27;s family and his contemporaries.

===Post Guru===
Soon after DJ Premier stated that there was a &quot;posthumous Gang Starr CD/DVD project in the works,&quot; and most likely to have been released in 2014, but nothing was released. DJ Premier confirmed in late 2015 that he was working on a Gang Starr biopic with the cooperation of Guru&#x27;s sister, Patricia Elam.

In 2019, DJ Premier released a new single under the Gang Starr name entitled &quot;Family and Loyalty&quot; featuring J. Cole, to be followed with a new album titled &quot;One of the Best Yet&quot;, which was released on November 1 that year.

==Legacy==
The Gang Starr Foundation was a loose collective of various people who have worked closely with the group, through either Guru&#x27;s now defunct Ill Kid label, DJ Premier&#x27;s production work or the management company that Gang Starr was represented by, Empire Management. Members of the foundation included Big Shug, Afu-Ra, Jeru the Damaja, Krumbsnatcha, Bumpy Knuckles, and Group Home.

Each episode title of the first season of the Netflix series &quot;Luke Cage&quot;, based on the Marvel Comics character, was named after a Gang Starr song.

<doc id="209035" wikidata="Q5929728" url="?curid=209035" title="Huggy Bear (band)">
<text>Huggy Bear were an English riot grrrl band, formed in 1991 and based in Brighton; active for three years, they played their final gig in December 1994.

==History==
Evolving in tandem with the Olympia, Washington-based riot grrrl movement led by feminist bands such as Bikini Kill, Huggy Bear called themselves &quot;girl-boy revolutionaries&quot;, both in reference to their political philosophy and the gender makeup of their band.

For the majority of their existence, they refused to be photographed or interviewed by mainstream press, nor gave their full names once they began releasing records formally. In spite of a major label bidding war, Huggy Bear stayed with indie label Wiiija.

Their avant-garde debut EP, &quot;Rubbing the Impossible to Burst&quot;, was released in 1992, and in the same year they began working closely with Bikini Kill as riot grrrl&#x27;s popularity peaked on both sides of the Atlantic, culminating in a split album on Catcall Records (Huggy Bear) and Kill Rock Stars (Bikini Kill) called &quot;Our Troubled Youth/Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah&quot;, the names of the Huggy Bear and Bikini Kill sides, respectively. Huggy Bear then released a series of EPs, which were collected on &quot;Taking the Rough with the Smooch&quot;.

On 14 February 1993, Huggy Bear performed &quot;Her Jazz&quot; on the British television programme, &quot;The Word&quot;. After their set, the band stayed in the studio to watch a report on two American models who called themselves &quot;the Barbi Twins&quot;. Huggy Bear and their fans became upset at this and started shouting at the show&#x27;s presenter Terry Christian. They were ejected from the studio, and a spokesperson for &quot;The Word&quot; later claimed that one of the band&#x27;s friends had &quot;bit the face of a member of our production team.&quot; Future Goldblade frontman and editor of music blog Louderthanwar, John Robb was with the band in the studio and said no-one got bitten and the security was heavy-handed and had to be calmed down. The performance was given a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; cover story, the event being compared to the Sex Pistols&#x27; Bill Grundy incident.

In early 1994, Slade left the band. Huggy Bear released two more singles and &quot;Weaponry Listens to Love&quot; in 1994, their first full-length album as well as their final release. The band would play their final show in December of that year, keeping to their promise to only exist for three years.

In 2024, a Huggy Bear retrospective book &quot;Killed (Of Kids)&quot; was published, featuring zines, memorabilia and an oral history of the band. A book launch was held at New River Studios at which former band members Hill, Slade, and Rowley performed Huggy Bear songs for the first time in thirty years.

==Other projects==
Members of Huggy Bear also played as the Furbelows. In 1993, Rowley and Johnson released an EP as The Element of Crime on Soul Static Sound records, with members of Linus, Skinned Teen, Sister George and Blood Sausage. Elliott and Johnson also joined Blood Sausage, while Rowley assisted Skinned Teen live and with artwork, and Elliot guested on their 1994 album. 

After leaving Huggy Bear, Hill formed Phantom Pregnancies with Delia from Mambo Taxi and Sean from Wat Tyler. Slade briefly joined I&#x27;m Being Good, and then Comet Gain. Since 2020 he has played bass in Snoozers with Nadia Buyse (Dubais) and Steve Dore (Casual Dots).

Jo Johnson has been playing and releasing solo ambient music since 2012. In 2014, she released debut digital album &quot;Weaving&quot; on Further Records. Since then, she has released &quot;The Serpentine Path&quot; on Going In, &quot;The Wave Ahead&quot; EP on Mysteries of the Deep and, in 2024, a third album, Let Go Your Fear on Castles in Space, and contributed to a number of compilations. Jo began collaborating with pianist and composer Hilary Robinson during the pandemic and the duo released &quot;Session One&quot; on 9128.live in 2021. 

In 2019, Chris Rowley formed a new band called Adulkt Life with former members of Male Bonding. On 27 November of that year, they played their first show at the Lexington in London. They released their first single and a digital zine on 18 August 2020, &quot;County Pride&quot;, on What&#x27;s Your Rupture?, followed by debut album &quot;Book Of Curses&quot;. Their second album &quot;There Is No Desire&quot; was released in 2023.

<text>Dismember is a Swedish death metal band formed in 1988. They split up in 2011 but reunited in 2019. Pioneers of Swedish death metal, Dismember is now considered one of the country&#x27;s &quot;big four&quot;, alongside Entombed, Grave, and Unleashed.

==History==
===Formation and Nuclear Blast-era (1988–2002)===
The band formed in Stockholm in 1988. After a hiatus, during which several members joined Carnage, the band began recording in earnest in 1991 and released their debut album &quot;Like an Ever Flowing Stream&quot; that year. The album is today heralded as a milestone for the burgeoning Swedish death metal scene and established the band&#x27;s fanbase, which was further bolstered by the controversy surrounding one song in particular, &quot;Skin Her Alive&quot;. The song prompted an obscenity charge in the United Kingdom, against which the band successfully defended themselves.

In 1992, Dismember released the &quot;Pieces&quot; EP, and the following year continued with second album, &quot;Indecent &amp; Obscene&quot;, which featured their song &quot;Dreaming in Red&quot;; the &quot;Dreaming in Red&quot; videoclip was shown in MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. According to an interview with fellow Nuclear Blast group Benediction in metallian.com, Dismember and the said band got into a business dispute and eventually a fisticuff at this stage over tour arrangements and monies owed.

Like many of the other Scandinavian death metal bands, Dismember began softening their sound in the mid-1990s, with 1995&#x27;s &quot;Massive Killing Capacity&quot; having more melodic approaches, which had a good public response. Nevertheless, they attempted a return to style with 1997&#x27;s &quot;Death Metal&quot;, which ultimately became a sales disappointment. Their last album for Nuclear Blast was 2000&#x27;s &quot;Hate Campaign&quot;.

===Switching labels (2003–2006)===
Around 2003, Dismember set a new path and signed for Karmageddon Records. In 2004, they released their sole album with that label titled &quot;Where Ironcrosses Grow&quot; which some thought sounds close to &quot;Hate Campaign&quot; and was inspired by Iron Maiden and Autopsy.

They switched record companies again in 2005, signing to Regain Records, which bought the rights to their earlier albums as well and released them as luxury digipak editions. In 2006, Dismember released their seventh album &quot;The God That Never Was&quot;, which continued in the style of its predecessor. The band spent February on the road in Europe. In November 2006, Dismember toured Europe as part of the Masters of Death tour, with Grave, Unleashed, Entombed, and Exterminator.

===Split with Fred Estby and final album (2007–2010)===
After the release of &quot;The God That Never Was&quot; and some touring, Estby left the band &quot;after long and careful consideration&quot;. In a posting on the official site on 20 April 2007, Estby cites the demands of touring and the needs of his family as key reasons for him leaving the band. His statements appears as &quot;My decision to put my family in first hand makes it impossible to keep on touring and commit to the band full time. I want to thank all the fans, friends, bands and all the other cool people I&#x27;ve met through the years and I wish Dismember all the best in the future. Fred.&quot;

In April 2008, they released their eighth album, &quot;Dismember&quot;.

Dismember released a two-disc DVD titled &quot;Under Blood Red Skies&quot; in late July 2009. The live concerts were filmed in the Netherlands and at the 2008 Party San Open Air Festival in Bad Berka, Germany. The DVD also included a documentary and interviews with band members. The cover art was created by Erik Danielsson of Trident Art.

===Breakup and reunion (2011–present)===
On 16 October 2011, bassist Tobias Cristiansson revealed in a statement that Dismember had broken up: &quot;After 23 years, Dismember have now decided to quit. We wish to thank all our fans for your support.&quot;

On a possible reunion, drummer Fred Estby told &quot;Invisible Oranges&quot; in August 2016: &quot;People were telling me that all the time. So maybe we should try to do some shows and get everything back. We always owned our rights to the albums and shirts, but there&#x27;s still loose ends to tie up. I just wanted to set the record straight and hopefully do some shows in the future.&quot;

In February 2018, rumors were afloat that Dismember was planning to reunite that year to celebrate the 30th anniversary of its formation. A reunion was teased that summer when the band posted random photos on their Facebook account. After nearly a year of rumors, it was announced on 14 January 2019 that the original lineup of Dismember had reunited and performed together for the first time in over 20 years at Scandinavia Deathfest that October.

In a May 2021 interview MetalBite.com, drummer Fred Estby stated that Dismember might consider releasing their first studio album in over a decade in either 2022 or 2023: &quot;I hope we get out of this situation soon so that we can play some shows and we wanna get more shows going across the globe, a lot of territories that we haven&#x27;t booked shows for yet and I hope that&#x27;s gonna happen as soon as this is all over. And maybe we&#x27;ll have a new record out in a year or two.&quot;

<text>Like an Ever Flowing Stream is the debut album by Swedish death metal band Dismember, released on 28 May 1991 through Nuclear Blast.

== Background ==
Nicke Andersson, at the time the drummer in Entombed played all the lead guitars except for the guitar solo on &quot;Override of the Overture&quot;, which is played by David Blomqvist.

The title may refer to the Biblical Book of Amos 5:24, &quot;Let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream&quot; (New International Version).

A music video was made for the track &quot;Soon to Be Dead&quot;. Since Karmageddon Records owns the rights to the album, it was not re-issued as a digipack disc in 2005 like every other album (except for &quot;Where Ironcrosses Grow&quot;). Regain re-issued those digipack versions and also remastered the albums while Karmageddon released an exact copy of the 1996 issue by Nuclear Blast (except for two additional bonus tracks).

==Composition==
The album makes use of heavily distorted and downtuned guitar and bass riffing. The drumming is influenced by punk rock, and has been said to &quot;[owe] more to Discharge than Slayer.&quot; The album&#x27;s vocals have been described as &quot;barks, gurgles, and roars,&quot; and have been said to sound like a &quot;pissed-off Rottweiler with a mouthful of fresh blood.&quot; The album&#x27;s production has been described as sounding &quot;as if it&#x27;s going to fall apart.&quot; 

==Reception and legacy==

The album is considered to be a classic in the death metal genre.

The album&#x27;s influence has been observed in the work of Bloodbath and Death Breath.

Modern reviews for &quot;Like an Ever Flowing Stream&quot; have been positive. AllMusic&#x27;s Phil Freeman gave the album a rating of five stars and called it &quot;one of the crucial documents of the early-&#x27;90s Swedish death metal scene.&quot; Adam McCann of Metal Digest noted that, &quot;Alongside Entombed, Grave and Unleashed, this debut album didn&#x27;t just help place Swedish death metal on the map, it took the flag and slammed it through a lifeless corpse, unveiling the blue and yellow. For many fans of Dismember, &quot;Like an Ever Flowing Stream&quot; is often regarded as not just their favourite Dismember album, but also one of the best death metal albums of all time.&quot;

In 2010, the album was inducted into &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<text>Swedish death metal is a death metal music scene developed in Sweden. Many Swedish death metal bands are associated with the melodic death metal movement, thus giving Swedish death metal a different sound from other variations of death metal. Unlike American death metal groups, the first Swedish bands were rooted in hardcore punk. Gothenburg has a large melodic death metal scene while Stockholm is known for its more raw death metal scene. 

Phil Freeman of AllMusic described Swedish death metal as &quot;grinding,&quot; and as more focused on &quot;getting heads banging and mosh pits exploding [and] less fixated on technical achievement&quot; than the Floridan style of death metal.

==History==

===Precursors===
The Swedish death metal scene&#x27;s earliest originators were influenced more by punk rock, especially the D-beat and hardcore punk scene, than they were metal bands. The most influential of these bands upon the burgeoning Swedish extreme metal scene was Gothenburg&#x27;s Anti Cimex. Influenced by such Swedish punk bands as Asocial, Mob 47 and Anti Cimex, emerged the country&#x27;s first extreme metal band Bathory. Subsequently, becoming a primary influence for the black metal scene, Bathory were a pivotal group in Swedish extreme metal. Mefisto, Obscurity and Merciless were some of the earliest bands to follow in Bathory&#x27;s footsteps, combining their sound with influences from German groups like Sodom and Destruction. Although Mefisto and Obscurity only released two demos each, and rarely performed live, Merciless became prominent in the extreme metal underground. Their live performances became notorious for bassist Fredrik Karlén&#x27;s reckless behaviour, including climbing up buildings and jumping off of balconies. Furthermore, the band&#x27;s 1988 demo &quot;Realm of the Dark&quot;, led to them becoming the first Swedish extreme metal band after Bathory to be signed to a record label, in this case of Euronymous&#x27;s label Deathlike Silence Productions, who released Merciless&#x27;s 1990 debut album &quot;The Awakening&quot;.

===Origins===
Stockholm&#x27;s Morbid and Nihilist were two of the earliest Swedish death metal bands, who both began to record music at Sunlight Studio around 1987 and 1988. The distinctive &quot;buzzsaw&quot; guitar tone which would become emblematic of the scene was pioneered early on by Nihilist guitarist Leffe Cuzner. It was created by using detuned electric guitars (usually C# standard or lower), a maxed out Boss HM-2 Heavy Metal pedal, sometimes in combination with a single guitar through a Boss DS-1 Distortion pedal. As these groups gained attention locally, additional groups joined the scene in subsequent years including Carnage, Dismember and Treblinka. During this time, many members of the Stockholm scene began congregating in Stockholm Metro stations, where they would listen to music and party. This group called themselves Bajsligan, meaning &quot;Army of Excrement&quot; or &quot;the Shit League&quot;. Outside of the city, Grave from Visby formed, who soon began associating with the members of the Stockholm scene. By 1989, this first wave of bands was beginning to conclude: newer groups like Carbonized and Afflicted Convulsion began to gain prominence in the scene and the members of Nihilist, Morbid and Carnage would soon fragment, founding Entombed and Unleashed, and reforming Dismember.

Entombed released their debut album &quot;Left Hand Path&quot; in 1990, which not only marked them as the most prominent act in Swedish death metal, but also influenced a countless bands both locals and internationally. The same year also saw the release of Carnage&#x27;s &quot;Dark Recollections&quot; and Tiamat&#x27;s &quot;Sumerian Cry&quot; two other albums which signified beginning of Swedish death metal&#x27;s second wave. The four groups who eventually solidified themselves as the most prominent bands of this era were Entombed, Grave, Dismember and Unleashed.

===Gothenburg scene===
The first death metal band to form in Gothenburg was Grotesque, who formed in 1988 and were influenced by both early death metal and black metal. After the 1990 disbandment of Grotesque, the band&#x27;s vocalist Tomas Lindberg and guitarist Alf Svensson formed At the Gates alongside brothers Jonas and Anders Björler. At the Gates&#x27; melancholic and melodic take on death metal proved immediately influential upon fellow Gothenburg bands, with Eucharist and Ceremonial Oath quickly adopting a similar style. Dissection and In Flames were also an early purveyors of this sound, additionally incorporating elements of black metal and folk music respectively. By 1993, Dark Tranquillity too began to incorporate more melodic elements influenced by At the Gates. Following the 1996 disbandment of At the Gates, critics dubbed this style the &quot;Gothenburg sound&quot;, and At the Gates, Dark Tranquility and In Flames as the &quot;Gothenburg big three&quot;, credited as pioneers of melodic death metal.

===Subsequent developments===
Cemetary formed in Borås in 1989. The band&#x27;s 1992 debut album &quot;An Evil Shade of Grey&quot; incorporating keyboards and elements of gothic metal and doom metal into its death metal foundation. The influence of Cemetary led the other groups to form in the city pursuing a similar take on the genre, notably Lake of Tears and Beseech.

Other groups to have emerged from the Swedish death metal scene include Scar Symmetry, Hypocrisy, Tiamat, Arch Enemy, Soilwork, Meshuggah, Amon Amarth, Edge of Sanity, Opeth, Desultory, Cemetary, Avatar and The Haunted.

Newer bands playing in the &quot;old school&quot; Swedish style include Bloodbath and Repugnant. According to Stewart Mason of AllMusic, the &quot;increasingly melodic&quot; style of Swedish death metal combines the post-hardcore aggression and guttural vocals of black metal with melodic and technically proficient guitar lines.

==Influence==
The death metal scene in Sweden has influenced many bands and genres outside Sweden. 
Stewart Mason has noted this popularity in the United States, using the term &quot;Swedecore&quot; to describe Scandinavian-style metal as played by non-Nordic bands. The Stockholm sound has been known to be very influenced by the first Entombed album and bands such as Autopsy, Death and Repulsion. The Stockholm sound has less reception but is strictly followed by bands like Trap Them and Rotten Sound. Melodic death metal, on the other hand, has had a notable influence on the melodic metalcore sound of the 2000s.

<text>Microsoft IIS ([[Internet]] Information Services, IIS, 2S) is an extensible web server created by Microsoft for use with the Windows NT family. IIS supports HTTP, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SMTP and NNTP. It has been an integral part of the Windows NT family since Windows NT 4.0, though it may be absent from some editions (e.g. Windows XP Home edition), and is not active by default. A dedicated suite of software called SEO Toolkit is included in the latest version of the manager. This suite has several tools for SEO with features for metatag / web coding optimization, sitemaps / robots.txt configuration, website analysis, crawler setting, SSL server-side configuration and more.

== History ==
The first Microsoft web server was a research project at the European Microsoft Windows NT Academic Centre (EMWAC), part of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, and was distributed as freeware. However, since the EMWAC server was unable to handle the volume of traffic going to Microsoft.com, Microsoft was forced to develop its own web server, IIS.

Almost every version of IIS was released either alongside or with a version of Microsoft Windows:
* IIS 1.0 was initially released as a free add-on for Windows NT 3.51.
* IIS 2.0 was included with Windows NT 4.0.
* IIS 3.0, which was included with Service Pack 2 of Windows NT 4.0, introduced the Active Server Pages dynamic scripting environment.
* IIS 4.0 was released as part of the &quot;Option Pack&quot; for Windows NT 4.0. It introduced the new MMC-based administration application and also was the first version where multiple instances of web and FTP servers can run, differentiating them by port number and/or hostname. It was also the first version to run application pools.
* IIS 5.0 shipped with Windows 2000 and introduced additional authentication methods, support for the WebDAV protocol, and enhancements to ASP. IIS 5.0 also dropped support for the Gopher protocol. IIS 5.0 added HTTP.SYS. 
* IIS 5.1 was shipped with Windows XP Professional and was nearly identical to IIS 5.0 on Windows 2000.
* IIS 6.0 included with Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, added support for IPv6 and included a new worker process model that increased security as well as reliability. HTTP.sys was introduced in IIS 6.0 as an HTTP-specific protocol listener for HTTP requests. Also each component (like for example Server Side Includes or ASP) now has to be explicitly installed, because in earlier versions often hackers entered sites by using security bugs of components that were not even in use by the hacked site, improving security.
* IIS 7.0 was a complete redesign and rewrite of IIS and was shipped with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. IIS 7.0 included a new modular design that allowed for a reduced attack surface and increased performance. It also introduced a hierarchical configuration system allowing for simpler site deploys, a new Windows Forms-based management application, new command-line management options and increased support for the .NET Framework. IIS 7.0 on Vista does not limit the number of allowed connections as IIS on XP did, but limits concurrent requests to 10 (Windows Vista Ultimate, Business, and Enterprise Editions) or 3 (Vista Home Premium). Additional requests are queued, which hampers performance, but they are not rejected as with XP.
* IIS 7.5 was included in Windows 7 (but it must be turned on in the side panel of Programs and Features) and Windows Server 2008 R2. IIS 7.5 improved WebDAV and FTP modules as well as command-line administration in PowerShell. It also introduced TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 support and the Best Practices Analyzer tool and process isolation for application pools.
* IIS 8.0 is only available in Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8. IIS 8.0 includes SNI (binding SSL to hostnames rather than IP addresses), Application Initialization, centralized SSL certificate support, and multicore scaling on NUMA hardware, among other new features.
* IIS 8.5 is included in Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1. This version includes Idle worker-Process page-out, Dynamic Site Activation, Enhanced Logging, ETW logging, and Automatic Certificate Rebind.
* IIS 10.0 version 1607 a.k.a. version 10.0.14393 is included in Windows Server 2016 released 2016-09-26 and Windows 10 Anniversary Update released 2016-08-02. This version includes support for HTTP/2, running IIS in Windows containers on Nano Server, a new Rest management API and corresponding web-based management GUI, and Wildcard Host Headers.
* IIS 10.0 version 1709 is included in Windows Server, version 1709 (Semi-Annual Channel) and Windows 10 Fall Creators Update both released 2017-10-17. This version adds support for HSTS, container enhancements, new site binding PowerShell cmdlets, and 4 new server variables prefixed with &quot;CRYPT_&quot;.
* IIS 10.0 version 1809 a.k.a. version 10.0.17763 is included in Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 October Update released 2018-10-02. This version added flags for control of HTTP/2 and OCSP Stapling per site, a compression API and implementing module supporting both gzip and brotli schemes, and a UI for configuring HSTS. IIS 10.0 on Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 has native support for HTTP/3.
All versions of IIS prior to 7.0 running on client operating systems supported only 10 simultaneous connections and a single website.

Microsoft was criticized by vendors of other web server software, including O&#x27;Reilly &amp; Associates and Netscape, for its licensing of early versions of Windows NT; the &quot;Workstation&quot; edition of the OS permitted only ten simultaneous TCP/IP connections, whereas the more expensive &quot;Server&quot; edition, which otherwise had few additional features, permitted unlimited connections but bundled IIS. It was implied that this was intended to discourage consumers from running alternative web server packages on the cheaper edition. Netscape wrote an open letter to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice regarding this distinction in product licensing, which it asserted had no technical merit. O&#x27;Reilly showed that the user could remove the enforced limits meant to cripple NT 4.0 Workstation as a web server with two registry key changes and other trivial configuration file tweaking.

== Features ==
IIS 6.0 and higher support the following authentication mechanisms:

* Anonymous authentication
* Basic access authentication
* Digest access authentication
* Integrated Windows Authentication
* UNC authentication
* .NET Passport Authentication (Removed in Windows Server 2008 and IIS 7.0)
* Certificate authentication

IIS 7.0 has a modular architecture. Modules, also called extensions, can be added or removed individually so that only modules required for specific functionality have to be installed. IIS 7 includes native modules as part of the full installation. These modules are individual features that the server uses to process requests.

IIS 7.5 includes the following additional or enhanced security features:
* Client certificate mapping
* IP security
* Request filtering
* URL authorization

Authentication changed slightly between IIS 6.0 and IIS 7, most notably in that the anonymous user which was named &quot;IUSR_{machinename}&quot; is a built-in account in Vista and future operating systems and named &quot;IUSR&quot;. Notably, in IIS 7, each authentication mechanism is isolated into its own module and can be installed or uninstalled.

IIS 8.0 offers new features targeted at performance and easier administration. The new features are:

* Application Initialization: a feature that allows an administrator to configure certain applications to start automatically with server startup. This reduces the wait time experienced by users who access the site for the first time after a server reboot.
* Splash page during application initialization: the administrator can configure a splash page to be displayed to the site visitor during an application initialization.
* ASP.NET 4.5 support: With IIS 8.0, ASP.NET 4.5 is included by default, and IIS also offers several configuration options for running it side by side with ASP.NET 3.5.
* Centralized SSL certificate support: a feature that makes managing certificates easier by allowing the administrator to store and access the certificates on a file share.
* Multicore scaling on NUMA hardware: IIS 8.0 provides several configuration options that optimize performance on systems that run NUMA, such as running several worker processes under one application pool, using soft or hard affinity and more.
* WebSocket Protocol Support
* Server Name Indication (SNI): SNI is an extension to Transport Layer Security, which allows the binding of multiple websites with different hostnames to one IP address (similar to how Host Headers are used for non-SSL sites).
* Dynamic IP Address Restrictions: a feature that enables an administrator to dynamically block IPs or IP ranges that hit the server with a large number of requests
* CPU Throttling: a set of controls that allow the server administrator to control CPU usage by each application pool in order to optimize performance in a multi-tenant environment

IIS 8.5 has several improvements related to performance in large-scale scenarios, such as those used by commercial hosting providers and Microsoft&#x27;s own cloud offerings. It also has several added features related to logging and troubleshooting. The new features are:

* Idle worker-Process page-out: a function to suspend idle sites to reduce the memory footprint of idle sites
* Dynamic Site Activation: a feature that registers listening queues only to sites that have received requests
* Enhanced Logging: a feature to allow the collection of Server variables, request headers and response headers in the IIS logs
* ETW logging: an ETW provider which allows collecting real-time logs using various Event-tracing tools
* Automatic Certificate Rebind: a feature that detects when a site certificate has been renewed and automatically rebinds the site to it

=== Express ===

IIS Express, a lightweight (4.5–6.6 MB) version of IIS, is available as a standalone freeware server and may be installed on Windows XP with Service Pack 3 and subsequent versions of Microsoft Windows. IIS 7.5 Express supports only the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. It is portable, stores its configuration on a per-user basis, does not require administrative privileges and attempts to avoid conflicting with existing web servers on the same machine. IIS Express can be downloaded separately or as a part of WebMatrix or Visual Studio 2012 and later. (In Visual Studio 2010 and earlier, web developers developing ASP.NET apps used ASP.NET Development Server, codenamed &quot;Cassini&quot;.) By default, IIS Express only serves local traffic.

=== Extensions ===

IIS releases new feature modules between major version release to add new functionality. The following extensions are available for IIS 7.5:

* FTP Publishing Service: Lets Web content creators publish content securely to IIS 7 Web servers with SSL-based authentication and data transfer.
* Administration Pack: Adds administration UI support for management features in IIS 7, including ASP.NET authorization, custom errors, FastCGI configuration, and request filtering.
* Application Request Routing: Provides a proxy-based routing module that forwards HTTP requests to content servers based on HTTP headers, server variables, and load balance algorithms.
* Database Manager: Allows easy management of local and remote databases from within IIS Manager.
* Media Services: Integrates a media delivery platform with IIS to manage and administer the delivery of rich media and other Web content.
* URL Rewrite Module: Provides a rule-based rewriting mechanism for changing request URLs before they are processed by the Web server.
* WebDAV: Lets Web authors publish content securely to IIS 7 Web servers, and lets Web administrators and hosters manage WebDAV settings using IIS 7 management and configuration tools.
* Web Deployment Tool: Synchronizes IIS 6.0 and IIS 7 servers, migrates an IIS 6.0 server to IIS 7, and deploys Web applications to an IIS 7 server.

== Usage ==
According to Netcraft, in February 2014, IIS had a &quot;market share of all sites&quot; of 32.80%, making it the second most popular web server in the world, behind Apache HTTP Server at 38.22%. Netcraft showed a rising trend in market share for IIS, . On 14 February 2014, however, the W3Techs shows different results. According to W3Techs, IIS is the third most used web server behind Apache HTTP Server (1st place) and Nginx. Furthermore, it shows a consistently falling trend for IIS use .

Netcraft data in February 2017 indicates IIS had a &quot;market share of the top million busiest sites&quot; of 10.19%, making it the third most popular web server in the world, behind Apache at 41.41% and nginx at 28.34%.

== Security ==
IIS 4 and IIS 5 were affected by the CA-2001-13 security vulnerability which led to the infamous Code Red attack; however, both versions 6.0 and 7.0 have no reported issues with this specific vulnerability. In IIS 6.0 Microsoft opted to change the behaviour of pre-installed ISAPI handlers, many of which were culprits in the vulnerabilities of 4.0 and 5.0, thus reducing the attack surface of IIS. In addition, IIS 6.0 added a feature called &quot;Web Service Extensions&quot; that prevents IIS from launching any program without explicit permission by an administrator.

By default IIS 5.1 and earlier run websites in a single process running the context of the System account, a Windows account with administrative rights. Under 6.0 all request handling processes run in the context of the Network Service account, which has significantly fewer privileges, so should there be a vulnerability in a feature or custom code it won&#x27;t necessarily compromise the entire system given the sandboxed environment these worker processes run in. IIS 6.0 also contained a new kernel HTTP stack (codice_1) with a stricter HTTP request parser and response cache for both static and dynamic content.

According to Secunia, , IIS 7 had a total of six resolved vulnerabilities while IIS 6 had a total of eleven vulnerabilities, out of which one was still unpatched. The unpatched security advisory has a severity rating of 2 out of 5.

In June 2007, a Google study of 80 million domains concluded that while the IIS market share was 23% at the time, IIS servers hosted 49% of the world&#x27;s malware, the same as Apache servers whose market share was 66%. The study also observed the geographical location of these dirty servers and suggested that the cause of this could be the use of unlicensed copies of Windows that could not obtain security updates from Microsoft. In a blog post on 28 April 2009, Microsoft noted that it supplies security updates to everyone without genuine verification.

The 2013 mass surveillance disclosures made it more widely known that IIS is particularly bad in supporting perfect forward secrecy (PFS), especially when used in conjunction with Internet Explorer. Possessing one of the long term asymmetric secret keys used to establish a HTTPS session should not make it easier to derive the short term session key to then decrypt the conversation, even at a later time. Diffie–Hellman key exchange (DHE) and elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman key exchange (ECDHE) are in 2013 the only ones known to have that property. Only 30% of Firefox, Opera, and Chromium Browser sessions use it, and nearly 0% of Apple&#x27;s Safari and Microsoft Internet Explorer sessions.

<doc id="209055" wikidata="Q847910" url="?curid=209055" title="Blue Lines">
<text>Blue Lines is the debut studio album by English electronic music group Massive Attack, released on 8 April 1991 by Wild Bunch and Virgin Records. The recording was led by members Grantley &quot;Daddy G&quot; Marshall, Robert &quot;3D&quot; Del Naja, Adrian &quot;Tricky&quot; Thaws, and Andrew &quot;Mushroom&quot; Vowles, with co-production by Jonny Dollar. It also features contributions by singers Shara Nelson and Horace Andy. Generally regarded as the first &quot;trip hop&quot; album, &quot;Blue Lines&quot; blended elements of hip hop (such as breakbeats, sampling, and rapping) with dub, soul, reggae, and electronic music.

&quot;Blue Lines&quot; was named the 21st greatest album of all time in a 1997 &quot;Music of the Millennium&quot; poll conducted by HMV, Channel 4, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Classic FM. In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; readers placed it at number 9 in the magazine&#x27;s poll of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;. In 2003, the album was included on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; and again in 2012 and 2020. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it at number 85 in its list of &quot;The Top 100 Albums of the 1990s&quot;.

A remastered version of the album was released on 19 November 2012.

==Background==
&quot;We worked on &quot;Blue Lines&quot; for about eight months, with breaks for Christmas and the World Cup,&quot; said Robert &quot;3D&quot; Del Naja, &quot;but we started out with a selection of ideas that were up to seven years old. Songs like &#x27;Safe from Harm&#x27; and &#x27;Lately&#x27; had been around for a while, from when we were The Wild Bunch, or from our time on the sound systems in Bristol. But the more we worked on them, the more we began to conceive new ideas too – like, &#x27;Five Man Army&#x27; came together as a jam.&quot; The group also drew inspiration from concept albums in various genres by artists such as Pink Floyd, Public Image Ltd, Billy Cobham, Wally Badarou, Herbie Hancock and Isaac Hayes.

Daddy G said about the making of the album:
The font used on the cover of the album is Helvetica Black Oblique. Del Naja has acknowledged the influence of the inflammable material logo used on the cover of Stiff Little Fingers&#x27; album &quot;Inflammable Material&quot;.

==Composition==
&quot;Blue Lines&quot; is generally considered the first trip hop album, although the term was not widely used before 1994. A fusion of electronic music, hip hop, dub, 1970s soul and reggae, it established Massive Attack as one of the most innovative British bands of the 1990s and the founder of trip hop&#x27;s Bristol sound. AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush also affirmed the album as the &quot;first masterpiece&quot; of what later became known as trip hop, and described it as &quot;filter[ing] American hip-hop through the lens of British club culture, a stylish, nocturnal sense of scene that encompassed music from rare groove to dub to dance.&quot; The album featured breakbeats, sampling, and rapping on a number of tracks, but the design of the album differed from traditional hip hop. Music critic Simon Reynolds stated that the album also marked a change in electronic and dance music, &quot;a shift toward a more interior, meditational sound. The songs on &quot;Blue Lines&quot; run at &#x27;spliff&#x27; tempos – from a mellow, moonwalking 90 beats per minute ... down to a positively torpid 67 bpm.&quot;

==Reception==
In a contemporary review of &quot;Blue Lines&quot; for &quot;NME&quot;, Dele Fadele described the album as &quot;the sleekest, deadliest, most urbane, most confounding LP 1991 has yet seen&quot;, writing that Massive Attack &quot;put current changes on the dancefloor in perspective and map out blueprints for what must surely come next&quot; and that &quot;after &quot;Blue Lines&quot; the boundaries separating soul, funk, reggae, house, classical, hip-hop and space-rock will be blurred forever.&quot; &quot;Select&quot;″s Andrew Harrison similarly complimented the album&#x27;s diverse mix of styles and called it &quot;a record to transcend every boundary&quot;, while in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Jim Irvin praised it as an album that &quot;one hopes might just bring down forever the wall of snobbery that still exists between dance and all other music.&quot; Robert Christgau was more reserved in his praise, giving the album a three-star honourable mention and writing, &quot;from soul ii skank, those postindustrial blues got them down&quot;. At the Brit Awards&#x27; 1992 ceremony, &quot;Blue Lines&quot; was nominated for Best British Album.

The album reached number 13 on the UK Albums Chart; sales were limited elsewhere. &quot;Blue Lines&quot; proved to be popular in the club scene, as well as on college radio stations.

According to Greg Kot in the 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, &quot;Blue Lines&quot; became &quot;the blueprint&quot; for trip hop, which would later emerge as a commercially popular musical style. &quot;On its release, &quot;Blue Lines&quot; felt like nothing else&quot;, Alexis Petridis wrote for &quot;The Guardian&quot; upon the album&#x27;s 2012 reissue, adding that it &quot;still sounds unique, which is remarkable given how omnipresent trip-hop was to become&quot;. Michael Gallucci of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; noted that the album &quot;created a template trip-hop artists relied on extensively&quot; in the years following its release. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Miles Raymer, meanwhile, identified &quot;Blue Lines&quot; as &quot;at its heart ... a hip-hop record&quot;, crediting it with being &quot;at the forefront&quot; of the genre&#x27;s musical progression from &quot;blocky rhythms and minimal arrangements&quot; in the 1980s towards &quot;deep, organic textures&quot; in the 1990s. Concluding his review for AllMusic, John Bush deemed &quot;Blue Lines&quot; &quot;one of the best dance albums of all time.&quot;

In 1997, &quot;Blue Lines&quot; was named the 21st greatest album of all time in a &quot;Music of the Millennium&quot; poll conducted by HMV, Channel 4, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Classic FM. The following year, &quot;Q&quot; readers placed it at number 58 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Albums Ever&quot;, and in 2000, the album was voted at number 9 in the magazine&#x27;s poll of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked number 395 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, 397 in a 2012 revised list, and 241 in a 2020 revised list. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it at number 85 in its 2003 list of &quot;The Top 100 Albums of the 1990s&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. The track &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; has also been singled out for praise, being hailed by BBC Radio 2 as &quot;one of the most moving pieces of dance music ever, able to soften hearts and excite minds just as keenly as a ballad by Bacharach or a melody by McCartney.&quot;

&quot;This album is chill music for me – music to write to&quot;, said author Chuck Palahniuk. &quot;I&#x27;m writing short stories to this right now. I put this on repeat, something Andy Warhol used to do: He&#x27;d put singles on and play them unendingly to the point where the language would break down, and he would paint to that trancelike repetition.&quot;

As of February 2010, the album had sold 266,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

<doc id="209059" wikidata="Q1095025" url="?curid=209059" title="Clandestine (album)">
<text>Clandestine is the second studio album by Swedish death metal band Entombed, released on 12 November 1991 in Europe and on 11 February 1992 in North America. Along with Entombed&#x27;s preceding album, &quot;Clandestine&quot; helped establish a distinctively Swedish sound in the death metal genre. 

This is the only Entombed album on which original vocalist L.G. Petrov does not appear. Petrov was fired from the band prior to the production of &quot;Clandestine&quot; due to personal disputes. Drummer Nicke Andersson provided vocals on the album while Johnny Dordevic, formerly of Carnage, was hired as the band&#x27;s vocalist for the ensuing tour.

==Reception==
AllMusic gave &quot;Clandestine&quot; a rating of four and a half stars. In October 2016, &quot;Clandestine&quot; was inducted into the &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine Hall of Fame, becoming the second Entombed album to be featured in the Decibel Hall of Fame.

==Track listing==
===2008 re-issue===
&quot;Clandestine&quot; was re-issued as part of the Earache Classic Series with a DVD. The DVD is identical to their &quot;Monkey Puss&quot; DVD.

<doc id="209060" wikidata="Q1809396" url="?curid=209060" title="Florin (British coin)">
<text>The British florin, or two-shilling piece (2/– or 2&quot;s&quot;.), was a coin worth of one pound, or 24 pence. It was issued from 1849 until 1967, with a final issue for collectors dated 1970. It was the last coin circulating immediately prior to decimalisation to be demonetised, in 1993, having for a quarter of a century circulated alongside the ten-pence piece, identical in specifications and value.

The florin was introduced as part of an experiment in decimalisation that went no further at the time. The original florins, dated 1849, attracted controversy for omitting a reference to God from Queen Victoria&#x27;s titles; that type is accordingly known as the &quot;Godless florin&quot;, and was in 1851 succeeded by the &quot;Gothic florin&quot;, for its design and style of lettering. Throughout most of its existence, the florin bore some variation of either the shields of the United Kingdom, or the emblems of its constituent nations on the reverse, a tradition broken between 1902 and 1910, when the coin featured a windswept figure of a standing Britannia.

In 1911, following the accession of George V, the florin regained the shields and sceptres design it had in the late Victorian era, and it kept that motif until 1937, when the national emblems were placed on it. The florin retained such a theme for the remainder of its run, though a new design was used from 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II. In 1968, prior to decimalisation, the Royal Mint began striking the ten-pence piece. The old two-shilling piece remained in circulation until the ten-pence piece was made smaller, and earlier coins, including the florin, were demonetised.

== History ==
=== Background ===

The drive for decimalisation of the currency in Britain dates as far back as 1682. Although nothing was done about early proposals, the adoption of decimal currencies in the United States, France and other nations in the late 18th and early 19th centuries renewed the call, and commissions in 1841 and 1843 called for the adoption of decimal coinage. In 1847, a motion was introduced in Parliament by Sir John Bowring calling for the introduction of a decimal currency and the striking of coins of one-tenth and one-hundredth of a pound. Bowring obtained surprisingly strong support for his motion, and the Russell government promised that a coin valued at one-tenth of a pound (two shillings) would be produced to test public opinion, with consideration to be given in future to the introduction of other decimal coins.

There was much discussion about what the coin should be called&quot;centum&quot;, &quot;decade&quot;, and &quot;dime&quot; were among the suggestionsbefore &quot;florin&quot; was eventually settled upon, not because of the old English coin of that name, but because the Netherlands had a florin, or gulden, about that size and value. The original florin, the &quot;fiorino d&#x27;oro&quot; of the Republic of Florence, was a gold coin struck from 1252 to 1533.

=== Victorian issues (1849–1901) ===

The first florins were struck in 1849. They were in the Gothic style, and featured a portrait of Queen Victoria as a very young woman, with the crowned shields of England (twice, per the usual arrangement of the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom as used in England), Scotland, and Ireland arranged in a cruciform pattern shown on the reverse, and the nations&#x27; floral emblems in the angles (again with England&#x27;s shown twice). The new florin closely resembles the Gothic crown of 1847; the obverse for both was designed by the Chief Engraver of the Royal Mint, William Wyon, while the reverse of both was designed by William Dyce. Unlike the crown&#x27;s Gothic script, the 1849 florin has Roman lettering. The 1849 florin, issued in silver, weighed 11.3 grams (defined as  troy ounce) and had a diameter of . The new coin made clear its value with the inscription on the reverse. To aid in the decimal experiment, the half crown (two shillings and sixpence, or one-eighth of a pound), near to the florin in size and value, was not issued between 1850 and 1874, when it was struck again at the request of the banks, and surveys found that both coins played useful parts in commerce. Each would continue to be struck, and would circulate together, until decimalisation.

These first coins were probably a shock to the public, as for the first time in nearly 200 years a British coin featured a portrait of the monarch wearing a crown. Even more of a shock, including (allegedly) to Queen Victoria herself, was the inscription on the obverse, , omitting the usual for &quot;Dei Gratia&quot; (By the Grace of God) from the coin&#x27;s inscription. This resulted in it being known as the &quot;Godless florin&quot;. Further controversy was caused by the omission of the usual abbreviation for &quot;Fidei Defensor&quot; (Defender of the Faith): the Master of the Mint, Richard Lalor Sheil, an Irishman and a Roman Catholic, was suspected by some of plotting to overthrow the Protestant regime. The inscription had in fact been suggested by Albert, Prince Consort, Victoria&#x27;s husband. Sheil said in the House of Commons the inscription had been a mistake, and the florin was redesigned for its next issue in 1851.

The revised florin&#x27;s diameter was increased to (the weight was unchanged), and all the lettering on the coin was in Gothic script, resulting in it being known as the Gothic florin. The coin was by the same designers; its date was rendered in Roman numerals. The bust of Victoria and the heraldry on the reverse were largely unchanged. The Latin inscription on the obverse read with the date, while the reverse read . Despite a Royal Commission, the drive for decimalisation soon died out; there was only lukewarm support for an 1855 motion in the Commons applauding the issuance of the florin and seeking further decimal coins. The Gothic Florin was produced each year until 1887, excepting 1861 and 1882. From 1864 until 1879, many florins were struck with die numbers on the obverse (found to the right of Victoria&#x27;s brooch, possibly part of a Mint investigation into how long it took coinage dies to wear out. Beginning with some 1867 issues, on the obverse was rendered , following the Latin practice in abbreviations of doubling a final consonant for a plural. Thus, Victoria&#x27;s title changed from &quot;Queen of Britain&quot; to &quot;Queen of the Britains&quot;, including the colonies and other territories.

In 1887, as part of a coinage redesign for Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, a new obverse design, showing the queen as an older woman, debuted on the gold and silver coinage. This was dubbed the &quot;Jubilee coinage&quot; and was by Sir Joseph Boehm. The various flora were removed from the florin&#x27;s reverse and were replaced by sceptres between the shields with a Garter Star in the centre. The Jubilee Head quickly proved unpopular, due in part to the crown worn by the Queen, which was deemed ridiculously small. The Jubilee florin shared its reverse with the short-lived double florin, which Gertrude Rawlings in 1898 described as &quot;radiating kitchen pokers and tea trays&quot;. The reverse design was created and engraved by Leonard Charles Wyon (who also engraved the obverse), though it was probably influenced by the gold coinage of Charles II designed by John Roettier. The diameter was reduced to . All the inscriptions were in Latin letters and Arabic numerals. The inscription on the obverse read , while the reverse read , with no indication of the value. The Jubilee florin was struck each year between 1887 and 1892.
Given the unpopularity of the Jubilee bust, a committee was set up in February 1891 to recommend new designs. An obverse designed by Thomas Brock was selected, and the committee also recommended some new reverses. This advisory committee recommended a different bust (also by Brock) be used on the florin to distinguish it from the half crown. The recommendation was not accepted, and the florin used the same &quot;Veiled Head&quot; or &quot;Old Head&quot; obverse that was introduced to the silver and gold coinage in 1893. To better distinguish it from the half crown, the diameter was reduced from . The obverse was inscribed , together with a new reverse showing three shields separated by a rose, shamrock, and thistle (symbolising England, Ireland, and Scotland) under a crown, and the inscription . This reverse was created by Sir Edward Poynter, and was issued each year between 1893 and 1901, the year of Victoria&#x27;s death.

=== Edward VII (1901–1910) ===

Both sides of the florin were redesigned following the accession of Victoria&#x27;s son, Edward VII, each design being created by the Chief Engraver of the Royal Mint, George William de Saulles. The florin of King Edward VII was minted every year from 1902 to 1910. Its specifications remained at 11.3 grams weight and 28.5 millimetres diameter. The obverse shows the right-facing head of the King, inscribed , while the other side features what &quot;Coincraft&#x27;s Standard Catalogue of English and UK Coins&quot; deems &quot;a most unusual and original reverse&quot;. It shows a windswept figure of Britannia standing holding a shield with her left hand and a trident with her right, and inscribed , with the date below. Peter Seaby, in his history of British coinage, described the figure of Britannia as &quot;standing on some mythical ancient ship which could hardly be sea-worthy under her weight&quot;, but &quot;a pleasing composition&quot;.

De Saulles created the new florin in this manner to distinguish the coin from the half crown, as there had been complaints of confusion. He probably based the design on his British trade dollar (1895). The sitter for the design was Susan Hicks-Beach, the daughter of Michael Hicks-Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and &quot;ex officio&quot; Master of the Mint. The modern-day Britannia coinage, bullion pieces struck by the Royal Mint for investors and collectors, has a reverse that strongly resembles that of the Edwardian florin.

=== George V (1910–1936) ===

Florins bearing a left-facing effigy of George V by Sir Bertram Mackennal were minted in each year of the King&#x27;s reign (1910–1936) except 1910 and 1934. The initial reverse design (1911–1926) was developed internally at the Royal Mint, and is intended to be that of the 1887 double florin, to which the Jubilee florin is very similar. The weight and diameter of the coin were unchanged but, because of rises in the price of silver, the metallic composition was changed in 1920 from 0.925 silver to 50% silver, 40% copper, 10% nickel, then again in 1922 to 50% silver, 50% copper, and again in 1927 to 50% silver, 40% copper, 5% nickel, 5% zinc. The changes in alloy after 1920 were due to the Mint&#x27;s trying to find a silver alloy that would remain attractive as it wore. The inscriptions on the obverse of the original version of the George V florin were and on the reverse were and the year of striking.

The modified florin, dated 1927 to 1936, was designed by George Kruger Gray and did not greatly alter the design of shields and sceptres, but removed the crowns from the shields and placed them on the sceptres. A &quot;G&quot;, the King&#x27;s initial, is at the centre of the design. The obverse inscription became and the reverse one was with the date and denomination . The bust of the King on the obverse was slightly modified in 1927.

=== Edward VIII (1936) ===

Throughout 1936, the year in which Edward VIII reigned, coins of all denominations continued to be struck using the designs of George V, pending preparation of the new monarch&#x27;s coinage. No coins depicting Edward VIII were officially released to circulation. A pattern florin exists for King Edward, which would have been due to receive approval around the time the King abdicated in December 1936. Although there is a tradition of alternating the direction the monarch faces with each reign, and George V had faced left, Edward believed that side more flattering. Thus, the obverse depicts the left-facing effigy of the King by Thomas Humphrey Paget inscribed . The reverse, by Kruger Gray, shows a crowned rose flanked by a thistle and shamrock, with E below the thistle and R below the shamrock, and the inscription and .

=== George VI (1936–1952) ===

King George VI&#x27;s florin, produced each year between 1937 and 1951, looks very much like the one planned for his brother Edward VIII. Like on the patterns for King Edward, the words are omitted; they would remain absent for the coin&#x27;s remaining existence. The obverse, by Thomas Humphrey Paget, shows the left-facing effigy of the King inscribed . The reverse, by Kruger Gray, depicts a crowned rose with a thistle and shamrock on either side. There is a G below the thistle and R below the shamrock, and the inscription until 1948. From 1949, the coins were struck without the , in acknowledgement of India&#x27;s independence. From 1947, the metal content was changed, as for all British silver circulating coins, to 75% copper, 25% nickel. This was due to the need for Britain to return Lend-Lease silver to the United States. The florin&#x27;s diameter and weight remained unchanged at 11.3 grams and 28.5 millimetres, despite the change of alloy.

=== Elizabeth II (1953–1970) ===

Florins were produced for Queen Elizabeth II each year between 1953 and 1967, with proof coins dated 1970. The obverse shows the Mary Gillick head of Queen Elizabeth, inscribed (1953 only) or (all other years). This change was made to acknowledge the evolving British Commonwealth, which by then contained some republics. The reverse, by Edgar Fuller and Cecil Thomas, depicts a Tudor rose in the centre surrounded by thistles, shamrocks and leeks, with the Latin phrase , the denomination and the date. The designs were selected by the Royal Mint Advisory Committee following a public competition. The artists&#x27; initials appear either side of the Welsh leek at the bottom of the reverse. When the reverse of the new coin was illustrated in the press, there was no consensus as to which way was up; numismatist H.W.A. Linecar has noted that the second in marks the bottom of the coin.

In accordance with the plan for decimalisation of the currency (120 years after this denomination was first introduced in the initial plan to introduce a decimal currency), from 1968 the ten pence coin was introduced of the same size, weight and metal composition as the florin. Thus, the florin ceased to be struck for circulation after the 1967-dated pieces. The new and the old circulated side by side as florins prior to Decimal Day (15 February 1971) and as ten pence pieces after. Florins (usually dated 1947 or later) remained in circulation after Decimal Day. In 1987, following a study of the currency, the Thatcher government announced its intent to issue a new ten pence piece, reduced in size. A smaller ten pence piece was issued in 1992, after which the old florin was demonetised on 30 June 1993. The florin, the first decimal coin, was the last coin in general circulation just prior to decimalisation to be withdrawn.

<doc id="209063" wikidata="Q308801" url="?curid=209063" title="Achtung Baby">
<text>Achtung Baby ( ) is the seventh studio album by the Irish rock band U2. It was produced by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, and was released on 18 November 1991 by Island Records. After criticism of their 1988 release &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;, U2 shifted their direction to incorporate influences from alternative rock, industrial music, and electronic dance music into their sound. Thematically, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; is darker, more introspective, and at times more flippant than their previous work. For his lyrics, lead vocalist Bono was partly inspired by the marital issues of guitarist the Edge.

Seeking inspiration from German reunification, U2 began recording &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; at Berlin&#x27;s Hansa Studios in October 1990. The sessions were fraught with conflict, as the band argued over their musical direction and the quality of their material. After tension and slow progress nearly prompted the group to disband, they made a breakthrough with the improvised writing of the song &quot;One&quot;. Morale and productivity improved during subsequent recording sessions in Dublin, where the album was completed in 1991. To confound the public&#x27;s expectations of the band and their music, U2 chose the record&#x27;s facetious title and colourful multi-image sleeve.

&quot;Achtung Baby&quot; is one of U2&#x27;s most successful records; it received favourable reviews and debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Top Albums, while topping the charts in many other countries. Five songs were released as commercial singles, all of which were chart successes, including &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;, and &quot;The Fly&quot;. The album has sold 18 million copies worldwide and won a Grammy Award in 1993 for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. The supporting, multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour of 1992–1993 was also a success, grossing US$151 million from 5.3 million tickets sold. It and the album were central to the group&#x27;s 1990s reinvention in musical style and in the shift from an earnest public image to a more lighthearted, ironic one.

&quot;Achtung Baby&quot; has since been acclaimed by writers and music critics as one of the greatest albums of all time. The record has been reissued several times, including in October 2011 and November 2021 for its 20th and 30th anniversaries, respectively. U2 commemorated the album during their concert residency U2:UV &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; Live, which ran from 2023 to 2024 at Sphere in the Las Vegas Valley.

==Background==
After U2&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; and the supporting Joshua Tree Tour brought them critical acclaim and commercial success, their 1988 album and film &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; precipitated a critical backlash. Although the record sold 14 million copies and performed well on music charts, critics were dismissive of it and the film, labelling the band&#x27;s exploration of early American music as &quot;pretentious&quot; and &quot;misguided and bombastic&quot;. U2&#x27;s high exposure and their reputation for being overly serious led to accusations of grandiosity and self-righteousness.

Despite their commercial popularity, the group were dissatisfied creatively; lead vocalist Bono believed they were musically unprepared for their success, while drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. said, &quot;We were the biggest, but we weren&#x27;t the best.&quot; By the band&#x27;s 1989 Lovetown Tour, they had become bored with playing their greatest hits. U2 believe that audiences misunderstood the group&#x27;s collaboration with blues musician B. B. King on &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; and the Lovetown Tour, and they described it as &quot;an excursion down a dead-end street&quot;. Bono said that, in retrospect, listening to black music enabled the group to create a work such as &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, while their experiences with folk music helped him to develop as a lyricist. During a 30 December 1989 show near the end of the Lovetown Tour, Bono said on stage to the hometown crowd in Dublin that it was &quot;the end of something for U2&quot;, and that &quot;we have to go away and ... dream it all up again&quot;. Following the tour, the group began what was at the time their longest break from public performances and album releases.

Reacting to their own sense of musical stagnation and to their critics, U2 searched for new musical ground. They had written &quot;God Part II&quot; from &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; after realising they had excessively pursued nostalgia in their songwriting. The song had a more contemporary feel that Bono said was closer to &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;″s direction. Further indications of change were two recordings they made in 1990: the first was a cover version of &quot;Night and Day&quot; for the first &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot; release, in which U2 used electronic dance beats and hip hop elements for the first time; the second indication of change was contributions made by Bono and guitarist the Edge to the original score of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;″s stage adaptation. Much of the material they wrote was experimental, and according to Bono, &quot;prepar[ed] the ground for &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;&quot;. Ideas deemed inappropriate for the play were put aside for the band&#x27;s use. During this period, Bono and the Edge began increasingly writing songs together without Mullen or bassist Adam Clayton.

In mid-1990, Bono reviewed material he had written in Australia on the Lovetown Tour, and the group recorded demos at STS Studios in Dublin. The demos later evolved into the songs &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses&quot;, &quot;Until the End of the World&quot;, &quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing&quot;, and &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;. After their time at STS Studios, Bono and the Edge were tasked with continuing to work on lyrics and melodies until the group reconvened. Going into the album sessions, U2 wanted the record to completely deviate from their past work, but they were unsure how to accomplish it. The emergence of the Madchester scene in the UK left them confused about how they would fit into any particular musical scene.
==Recording and production==
U2 hired Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno to produce the album, based on the duo&#x27;s prior work with the band on &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; and &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;. Lanois was principal producer, with Mark &quot;Flood&quot; Ellis as engineer. Eno took on an assisting role, working with the group in the studio for a week at a time to review their songs before leaving for a month or two. Eno said his role was &quot;to come in and erase anything that sounded too much like U2&quot;. By distancing himself from the work, he believed he provided the band with a fresh perspective on their material each time he rejoined them. As he explained, &quot;I would deliberately not listen to the stuff in between visits, so I could go in cold&quot;. Since U2 wanted the record to be harder-hitting and live-sounding, Lanois &quot;push[ed] the performance aspect very hard, often to the point of recklessness&quot;. The Lanois–Eno team used lateral thinking and a philosophical approach—popularised by Eno&#x27;s Oblique Strategies—that contrasted with the direct and retro style of &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; producer Jimmy Iovine.

===Berlin sessions===
The band believed that &quot;domesticity [w]as the enemy of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot; and that to work on the album, they needed to remove themselves from their normal family-oriented routines. With a &quot;New Europe&quot; emerging at the end of the Cold War, they chose Berlin, in the centre of the reuniting continent, as a source of inspiration for a more European musical aesthetic. They chose to record at Hansa Studios in West Berlin, near the recently opened Berlin Wall. Several acclaimed records were made at Hansa, including two from David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Berlin Trilogy&quot; with Eno, and Iggy Pop&#x27;s &quot;Lust for Life&quot;. U2 arrived on 3 October 1990 on the last flight into East Berlin on the eve of German reunification. While looking for public celebrations, they mistakenly ended up joining an anti-unification protest by Communists. Expecting to be inspired in Berlin, U2 instead found the city to be depressing and gloomy. The collapse of the Berlin Wall had resulted in a state of malaise in Germany. The band found their East Berlin hotel to be dismal and the winter inhospitable, while the location of Hansa&#x27;s Studio 2 in a former SS ballroom, the Meistersaal, added to the &quot;bad vibe&quot;. Complicating matters, the studios had been neglected for years, forcing Eno and Lanois to import recording equipment.
Morale worsened once the sessions commenced, as the band worked long days but could not agree on a musical direction. The Edge had been listening to electronic dance music and to industrial bands like Einstürzende Neubauten, Nine Inch Nails, the Young Gods, and KMFDM. He and Bono advocated new musical directions along these lines. In contrast, Mullen was listening to classic rock acts such as Blind Faith, Cream, and Jimi Hendrix, and he was learning how to &quot;play around the beat&quot;. Like Clayton, he was more comfortable with a sound similar to U2&#x27;s previous work and was resistant to the proposed innovations. Further, the Edge&#x27;s interest in dance club mixes and drum machines made Mullen feel that his contributions as a drummer were being diminished. Lanois was expecting the &quot;textural and emotional and cinematic U2&quot; of &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; and &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, and he did not understand the &quot;throwaway, trashy kinds of things&quot; on which Bono and the Edge were working. Compounding the divisions between the two camps was a change in the band&#x27;s songwriting relationship; Bono and the Edge were working more closely together, writing material without the rest of the group.

U2 found that they were neither prepared nor well-rehearsed, and that their ideas were not evolving into completed songs. The group were unable to reach consensus during their disagreements and felt that they were not making progress. Bono and Lanois, in particular, had an argument that almost came to blows during the writing of &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;. During one tense session, Clayton removed his bass guitar and held it out to Bono, saying, &quot;You tell me what to play and I&#x27;ll play it. You want to play it yourself? Go ahead.&quot; With a sense of going nowhere, the band considered breaking up. Eno visited for a few days, and understanding their attempts to deconstruct the band, he assured them that their progress was better than they thought. By adding unusual effects and sounds, he showed that the Edge&#x27;s pursuit for new sonic territory was not incompatible with Mullen&#x27;s and Lanois&#x27; &quot;desire to hold on to solid song structures&quot;. Ultimately, a breakthrough was achieved with the writing of the song &quot;One&quot;. While working on &quot;Sick Puppy&quot;—an early version of &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;—the Edge played two separate chord progressions sequentially on guitar at Lanois&#x27; encouragement, and finding inspiration, the group quickly improvised a new song that became &quot;One&quot;. It provided reassurance and validated their long-standing &quot;blank page approach&quot; to writing and recording together.

U2 returned to Dublin for Christmas, where they discussed their future together and all recommitted to the group. Listening to the tapes, they agreed their material sounded better than they originally thought. They briefly returned to Berlin in January 1991 to finish their work at Hansa. Reflecting on their time in Berlin, Clayton called the sessions a &quot;baptism of fire&quot; and said, &quot;It was something that we had to go through to realize that really, what we were looking for and what we were trying to get to was not something you could find physically, outside of ourselves, in some other city—that there was no magic to it. We had to actually just put the work in and figure out the ideas and hone those ideas down.&quot; Although just two songs were delivered during their two months in Berlin, the Edge said that in retrospect, working there had been more productive and inspirational than the output had suggested. The band had been removed from a familiar environment, providing what they described as a certain &quot;texture and cinematic location&quot;, and many of their incomplete ideas would be revisited in the subsequent Dublin sessions with success.

===Dublin sessions===

In February 1991, U2 moved the album&#x27;s recording sessions to the seaside manor Elsinore in the Dublin suburb of Dalkey, renting the house for £10,000 per month. The band nicknamed the house &quot;Dog Town&quot; for the &quot;tackiness&quot; of its exterior dog kennels, and the location was credited as such in the album notes. Lanois&#x27; strategy to record in houses, mansions, or castles was something he believed brought atmosphere to the recordings. The group rented recording equipment from Dublin audio services company Audio Engineering, and they used a converted garage as a recording space, diagonally beneath the control room. Video cameras and TV monitors were used to monitor and communicate between the spaces. With Elsinore located within walking distance of Bono&#x27;s and the Edge&#x27;s homes, the sessions there were more relaxed and productive. The band struggled with one particular song—later released as the B-side &quot;Lady With the Spinning Head&quot;—but three separate tracks, &quot;The Fly&quot;, &quot;Ultraviolet (Light My Way)&quot; and &quot;Zoo Station&quot;, were derived from it. During the writing of &quot;The Fly&quot;, Bono created a persona based on an oversized pair of black sunglasses that he wore to lighten the mood in the studio. The character, which he also named &quot;The Fly&quot;, evolved into a leather-clad egomaniac meant to parody rock stardom. Bono assumed this alter ego for the band&#x27;s subsequent public appearances and live performances on the Zoo TV Tour.

In April, tapes from the earlier Berlin sessions were stolen after the band reportedly left them in a hotel room, and they were subsequently leaked before the album was finished. The recordings were bootlegged into a three-disc collection dubbed &quot;Salome: The [Axtung Beibi] Outtakes&quot;, named for the song &quot;Salomé&quot; that was prominently featured in the collection but did not make the album&#x27;s final cut. The release is considered the most famous bootleg of U2 material. Bono dismissed the leaked demos as &quot;gobbledygook&quot;, and the Edge likened the situation to &quot;being violated&quot;. The leak shook U2&#x27;s confidence and soured their collective mood for a few weeks.

Staffing schedules led to the band having a surplus of engineers at one point, and as a result, they split recording between Elsinore and the Edge&#x27;s home studio to increase productivity. Engineer Robbie Adams said the approach raised morale and activity levels: &quot;There was always something different to listen to, always something exciting happening.&quot; The band&#x27;s desire to record everything they played in the studio posed a challenge to the production team. A conventional setup with their equipment would have restricted them to 24 tracks of audio; to capture multiple overdubs and takes for different arrangement possibilities, the engineers utilised a technique they called &quot;fatting&quot;, which allowed them to achieve more than 48 tracks of audio by using an Otari MTR100 24-track recorder, a Fostex D20 timecode-capable DAT recorder, and an Adams Smith Zeta Three synchroniser. The focus on capturing the band&#x27;s material and encouraging the best performances meant that little attention was paid to combating audio spill, aside from placing the Edge&#x27;s and Clayton&#x27;s amplifiers in separate rooms. In issue 14 of U2&#x27;s fan magazine &quot;Propaganda&quot;, Lanois said that he believed some of the in-progress songs would become worldwide hits, despite lyrics and vocal takes being unfinished.

During the Dublin sessions, Eno was sent tapes of the previous two months&#x27; work, which he called a &quot;total disaster&quot;. Joining U2 in the studio, he stripped away what he thought to be excessive overdubbing. The group believes his intervention saved the album. Eno theorised that the band was too close to their music, explaining: &quot;if you know a piece of music terribly well and the mix changes and the bass guitar goes very quiet, you still hear the bass. You&#x27;re so accustomed to it being there that you compensate and remake it in your mind.&quot; Eno also assisted them through a crisis point one month before the recording deadline; he recalled that &quot;everything seemed like a mess&quot;, and he insisted the band take a two-week holiday. The break gave them a clearer perspective and added decisiveness.

After work at Elsinore finished in July, the sessions moved to Windmill Lane Studios where Eno, Flood, Lanois, and previous U2 producer Steve Lillywhite mixed the tracks. Each producer created his own mixes of the songs, and the band either picked the version they preferred or requested that certain aspects of each be combined. Additional recording and mixing continued at a frenetic pace until the 21 September deadline, including last-minute changes to &quot;The Fly&quot;, &quot;One&quot;, and &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;. The Edge estimated that half of the sessions&#x27; work was done in the last three weeks to finalise songs. The final night was spent devising a running order for the record. The following day, the Edge travelled to Los Angeles with the album&#x27;s tapes for mastering.

==Composition==

===Music===
U2 is credited with composing the music for all of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;″s tracks, despite periods of separated songwriting. They wrote the music primarily through jam sessions, a common practice for them. The album represents a deviation from the sound of their past work; the songs are less anthemic in nature, and their musical style demonstrates a more European aesthetic, introducing influences from alternative rock, industrial music, and electronic dance music. The band referred to the album&#x27;s musical departure as &quot;the sound of four men chopping down The Joshua Tree&quot;. Accordingly, the distorted introduction to the opening track &quot;Zoo Station&quot; was intended to make listeners think the record was broken or was mistakenly not the new U2 album. Author Susan Fast said that with the group&#x27;s use of technology in the song&#x27;s opening, &quot;there can be no mistake that U2 has embraced sound resources new to them&quot;.
For the album, the Edge often eschewed his normally minimalistic approach to guitar playing and his trademark chiming, delay-heavy sound, in favour of a style that incorporated more solos, dissonance, and feedback. Industrial influences and guitar effects, particularly distortion, contributed to a &quot;metallic&quot; style and &quot;harder textures&quot;. Music journalist Bill Wyman said the Edge&#x27;s guitar playing on the closing track &quot;Love Is Blindness&quot; sounded like a &quot;dentist&#x27;s drill&quot;. The Edge achieved breakthroughs in the writing of songs such as &quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; by toying with various effects units.

The rhythm section is more pronounced in the mix on &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, and hip hop-inspired electronic dance beats are featured on many of the album&#x27;s tracks, most prominently &quot;The Fly&quot;. Elysa Gardner of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; compared the layering of dance beats into guitar-heavy mixes to songs by British bands Happy Mondays and Jesus Jones. &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; combines a funky guitar riff with a danceable, conga-laden beat, for what Bono called &quot;U2 at our funkiest... Sly and The Family Stone meets Madchester baggy.&quot; Amidst layers of distorted guitars, &quot;The Fly&quot; and &quot;Zoo Station&quot; feature industrial-influenced percussion—the timbre of Mullen&#x27;s drums exhibits a &quot;cold, processed sound, something like beating on a tin can&quot;, according to author Albin Zak.

Whereas Bono exhibited a full-throated vocal delivery on the group&#x27;s previous releases, for &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; he extended his range into a lower register and used what Fast described as &quot;breathy and subdued colors&quot;. On many tracks, including &quot;The Fly&quot; and &quot;Zoo Station&quot;, he sang as a character; one technique used is octave doubling, in which the vocals are doubled but sung in two different octaves. This octave differentiation was sometimes done with vocals simultaneously, while at other times, it distinguishes voices between the verses and choruses. According to Fast, the technique introduces &quot;a contrasting lyrical idea and vocal character to deliver it&quot;, leading to both literal and ironic interpretations of Bono&#x27;s vocals. He said that lowering his voice helped him find a new vocal vocabulary, as he previously felt limited to &quot;certain words and tones&quot; by his tenor voice. Other methods of altering his vocals included treating them with processing and feeding them through a distortion pedal. These techniques were all used to give his voice a different emotional feel and distinguish it from his previous work.

===Lyrics===

As is often the case on U2 albums, Bono is credited as the sole lyricist. In contrast to U2&#x27;s previous records, whose lyrics were politically and socially charged, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; is more personal and introspective, examining love, sexuality, spirituality, faith, and betrayal. The lyrics are darker in tone, describing troubled personal relationships and exuding feelings of confusion, loneliness, and inadequacy. Lyrics were inspired by the dissolution of the Edge&#x27;s marriage, as well as that of another of Bono&#x27;s friends. During the album&#x27;s recording, the Edge separated from his wife (the mother of three of his children), and the pain he felt resulted in him dedicating himself to the record and advocating for more personal themes. Bono found inspiration from his own personal life, citing the births of his two daughters in 1989 and 1991 as major influences. This is reflected in &quot;Zoo Station&quot;, which opens the album as a statement of intent with lyrics suggesting new anticipations and appetites.

Of the album&#x27;s personal nature, Bono said that there were a lot of &quot;blood and guts&quot; in it. His lyrics to the ballad &quot;One&quot; were inspired by the band members&#x27; interpersonal struggles and the German reunification. The Edge described the song on one level as a &quot;bitter, twisted, vitriolic conversation between two people who&#x27;ve been through some nasty, heavy stuff&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Ultraviolet (Light My Way)&quot; describes a strained relationship and unease over obligations, and on &quot;Acrobat&quot;, Bono sings about weakness, hypocrisy, and inadequacy. The torch songs of Roy Orbison, Scott Walker, and Jacques Brel were major influences, evidenced by tracks such as: &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses&quot;, a description of a couple&#x27;s argument; &quot;So Cruel&quot;, about unrequited love, obsession, and possessiveness; and the closing track, &quot;Love Is Blindness&quot;, a bleak account of a failing romance.

U2 biographer Bill Flanagan credits Bono&#x27;s habit of keeping his lyrics &quot;in flux until the last minute&quot; with providing a narrative coherence to the album. Flanagan interpreted &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; as using the moon as a metaphor for a dark woman seducing the singer away from his virtuous love, the sun; he is tempted away from domestic life by an exciting nightlife and tests how far he can go before returning home. For Flanagan, &quot;Tryin&#x27; to Throw Your Arms Around the World&quot; on the album&#x27;s latter third describes the character stumbling home in a drunken state, and the final three songs—&quot;Ultraviolet (Light My Way)&quot;, &quot;Acrobat&quot;, and &quot;Love Is Blindness&quot;—are about how the couple deal with the suffering they have forced on each other.

Despite the record&#x27;s darker themes, many lyrics are more flippant and sexual than those from the band&#x27;s previous work. This reflects the group&#x27;s revisiting some of the Dadaist characters and stage antics they dabbled with in the late 1970s as teenagers but abandoned for more literal themes in the 1980s. While the band had previously been opposed to materialism, they examined and flirted with this value on the album and the Zoo TV Tour. The title and lyrics of &quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing&quot; are &quot;reflective of the times [the band] were living in, when people were no longer looking for the truth, [they] were all looking for instant gratification&quot;. &quot;Trashy&quot; and &quot;throwaway&quot; were among the band&#x27;s buzzwords during recording, leading to many tracks in this vein. The chorus of &quot;Ultraviolet (Light My Way)&quot; features the pop lyrical cliché &quot;baby, baby, baby&quot;, juxtaposed against the dark lyrics in the verses. Bono wrote the lyrics to &quot;The Fly&quot; in character as the song&#x27;s eponymous persona by composing a sequence of aphorisms. He called the song &quot;like a crank call from Hell... but [the caller] likes it there&quot;.

Religious imagery is present throughout the record. &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; is an imagined conversation between Jesus Christ and his betrayer, Judas Iscariot. On &quot;Acrobat&quot;, Bono sings about feelings of spiritual alienation in the line &quot;I&#x27;d break bread and wine / If there was a church I could receive in&quot;. In many tracks, Bono&#x27;s lyrics about women carry religious connotations, describing them as spirits, life, light, and idols to be worshipped. Religious interpretations of the album are the subject of the book &quot;Meditations on Love in the Shadow of the Fall&quot; from the &quot;33 ⅓&quot; series.
==Packaging and title==

The sleeve artwork for &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was designed by two employees from the design firm Works Associates: Steve Averill, U2&#x27;s long-time album cover designer; and Shaughn McGrath, who had just joined the firm. To parallel the band&#x27;s change in musical direction, Averill and McGrath devised sleeve concepts that used multiple colour images to contrast with the seriousness of the individual, mostly monochromatic images from previous U2 album sleeves. Rough sketches and designs were created early during the recording sessions, and some experimental designs were conceived to closely resemble dance music sleeves. Averill said: &quot;We just did them to show how extreme we could go and then everyone came back to levels that they were happy with. But if we hadn&#x27;t gone to these extremes it may not have been the cover it is now.&quot;

An initial photo shoot with the band&#x27;s long-time photographer Anton Corbijn was conducted near U2&#x27;s Berlin hotel in late 1990. Most of the photos were black-and-white, and the group felt they were not indicative of the spirit of the new album. They recommissioned Corbijn for an additional two-week photo shoot in Tenerife in February 1991, for which they dressed up and mingled with the crowds of the annual Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, presenting a more playful side of themselves. It was during the group&#x27;s time in Tenerife and during a four-day shoot in Morocco in July that they were photographed in drag. Additional photos were taken in a Dublin studio in June, a session in which Corbijn captured long exposures over several minutes. One of the photos from this session depicted a naked Clayton. Overall, Corbijn&#x27;s images for &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; were intended to confound expectations of U2, and their full colour contrasted with the monochromatic imagery on past sleeves.
For the photoshoots in Berlin and Tenerife, the band were photographed with brightly painted Trabants, East German automobiles that became a symbol of the fall of Communism and for which the band had developed an affection. Street artist Thierry Noir was commissioned to provide the artwork and painted the vehicles in Hansa Studios&#x27; parking lot; he became involved through a fellow collaborator of the band&#x27;s, film director Wim Wenders. Images of the band with the Trabants appear on the sleeve and throughout the album booklet. These vehicles were later incorporated into the Zoo TV Tour set design as part of the lighting system.

Several photographs were considered as candidates for a single cover image, including shots of: a cow on an Irish farm in County Kildare; the nude Clayton; and the band driving a Trabant. Ultimately, a multiple image scheme was used, as U2, Corbijn, Averill, and the producers thought that &quot;the sense of flux expressed by both the music and the band&#x27;s playing with alter egos was best articulated by the lack of a single viewpoint&quot;. The resulting front sleeve is arranged as a 4×4 square grid. A mix of Corbijn&#x27;s original images from Berlin and the later photo shoots was used, as the band wanted to balance the &quot;colder European feel of the mainly black-and-white Berlin images with the much warmer exotic climates of Santa Cruz and Morocco&quot;. Some photographs were used because they were striking on their own, while others were used because of their ambiguity. The nude photo of Clayton was placed on the rear cover of the record. After objections to the photo were raised in the United States, it was censored; Averill and McGrath painted a black &quot;X&quot; and faxed it to the record label, which turned it into a sticker that American distributors and retailers could affix to the album packaging to cover Clayton&#x27;s genitals. Compact disc and cassette copies were censored with the sticker, while vinyl editions featured the photo uncensored.

To &quot;match the gush of spontaneity and power of the photography&quot;, McGrath calligraphed the album title, band name, and track listing for the packaging, using paintbrushes as well as ink and pen. Contrasting with the &quot;unique humanity&quot; of his handwriting, McGrath set the lyrics and album credits in the ubiquitous European font Helvetica, &quot;mirror[ing] the repetitive industrial and Germanic themes of the album&quot;. The label of the physical CD and vinyl disc features an image of a &quot;babyface&quot; graffitied by artist Charlie Whisker onto an external wall of Windmill Lane Studios and photographed by Richie Smyth. The babyface image was later adopted as a logo for Zoo TV Tour memorabilia and was incorporated into the &quot;Zooropa&quot; album cover. In 2003, music television network VH1 ranked &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;″s sleeve at number 39 on its list of the &quot;50 Greatest Album Covers&quot;. Bono has called the sleeve his favourite U2 cover artwork.

The German word &quot;&quot; () in the album title is an interjection that translates into English as &quot;attention&quot; or &quot;watch out&quot;. There are multiple reports of the origins of the album&#x27;s title. According to singer Tottie Goldsmith, she often used the phrase &quot;Achtung, baby&quot; to get her boyfriend&#x27;s attention and was once overheard by Bono at a party in 1989, who &quot;turned around to ask her why she had just said that&quot;. Goldsmith has said that inspiring the album title became her &quot;claim to fame&quot;. According to Bono, U2&#x27;s sound engineer Joe O&#x27;Herlihy said the phrase &quot;Achtung, baby&quot; often during the recording sessions, using it as a &quot;&quot; each time the band were about to begin work for the day. He reportedly took it from Mel Brooks&#x27;s 1967 film &quot;The Producers&quot;; however, the phrase is not spoken in the film and actually originated from Brooks&#x27;s 1983 comedy hip hop song &quot;To Be or Not to Be (The Hitler Rap)&quot;. The album title was selected in August 1991 near the end of the album sessions. Bono thought it was an ideal title, as it was attention-grabbing to him, referenced Germany, and hinted at either romance or birth, both of which were themes on the album. The band were determined not to highlight the seriousness of the lyrics and instead sought to &quot;erect a mask&quot; with the title, a concept that was further developed on the Zoo TV Tour, particularly through Bono&#x27;s characters such as &quot;The Fly&quot;. Of the title, he said in 1992: &quot;It&#x27;s a con, in a way. We call it &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, grinning up our sleeves in all the photography. But it&#x27;s probably the heaviest record we&#x27;ve ever made... It tells you a lot about packaging, because the press would have killed us if we&#x27;d called it anything else.&quot;

U2 considered several other titles for the album, including &quot;Man&quot; (in contrast to the group&#x27;s debut, &quot;Boy&quot;), &quot;69&quot;, &quot;Zoo Station&quot;, and &quot;Adam&quot;, the latter of which would have been paired with the nude photo of Clayton. Other titles in consideration included &quot;Fear of Women&quot; and &quot;Cruise Down Main Street&quot;, the latter a reference to the Rolling Stones&#x27; record &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; and the cruise missiles launched on Baghdad during the Gulf War. Most of the proposed titles were rejected out of the belief that people would see them as pretentious and &quot;another Big Statement from U2&quot;.
==Release and promotion==
As early as December 1990, the music press reported that U2 would be recording a dance-oriented album and that it would be released in mid-1991. In August 1991, sound collage artists Negativland released an EP entitled &quot;U2&quot; that parodied U2&#x27;s song &quot;I Still Haven&#x27;t Found What I&#x27;m Looking For&quot;. Island Records objected to the release, believing consumers would confuse the EP for a new U2 record. Island successfully sued for copyright infringement but were criticised in the music press, as were U2, although the band were not involved in the litigation. 

&quot;Uncut&quot;″s Stephen Dalton believed that the negative headlines were tempered by the success of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;″s first single, &quot;The Fly&quot;, released on 21 October 1991 a month before the album. Sounding nothing like U2&#x27;s typical style, it was selected as the lead single to announce the group&#x27;s new musical direction, but the song&#x27;s sound presented a challenge to Island executive Marc Marot. &quot;The Fly&quot; was the first U2 single for which he had responsibility for worldwide marketing, and according to him, it had one of the lowest airplay rotations on BBC Radio 1 of any song that year; Marot said it was &quot;probably the only [U2 single] nobody can sing the chorus of&quot;. Consequently, the label devised a plan to help it reach number one on the UK Singles Chart by manufacturing an unlimited number of copies for retailers but for one week only. &quot;The Fly&quot; subsequently became the band&#x27;s second song to reach number one in the UK, and it also topped the singles charts in Ireland and Australia. The single was less successful in the US, peaking at number 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Island Records and U2 refused to make advance copies of the album available to the press until just a few days before the release date, preferring that fans listen to the record before reading reviews. The decision came amid rumours of tensions within the band, and journalist David Browne compared it to the Hollywood practice of withholding pre-release copies of films from reviewers whenever they receive poor word-of-mouth press. &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was released on 18 November 1991 in the UK and 19 November in the US on compact disc, cassette tape, and vinyl record, with an initial shipment of more than 1.4 million copies in the US. The album was the first release by a major act to use two so-called &quot;eco-friendly&quot; packages—the cardboard Digipak, and the shrinkwrapped jewel case without the longbox cardboard attachment. Island encouraged record stores to order the jewel case packaging by offering a four-percent discount.

&quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was U2&#x27;s first album in three years and their first comprising entirely new material in over four years. The group maintained a low profile after the record&#x27;s release, avoiding interviews and allowing critics and the public to make their own assessments. Instead of participating in an article with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, U2 asked Eno to write one for them. The marketing plan for the album focused on retail and press promotions. In addition to television and radio advertisements being produced, posters featuring the sleeve&#x27;s 16 images were distributed to record stores and through alternative newspapers in major cities. Compared to the large hype of other 1991 year-end releases, the marketing for &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was relatively understated, as Island general manager Andy Allen explained: &quot;U2 will not come out with that kind of fanfare in terms of outside media. We feel the fan base itself creates that kind of excitement.&quot;

&quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; was released as the second single five days after the release of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. On the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, the song topped the Modern Rock Tracks and Album Rock Tracks charts, and it reached number nine on the Hot 100. Elsewhere, it reached number one in Canada and number three in Australia. Three additional commercial singles were released in 1992. &quot;One&quot;, released in March at the beginning of the Zoo TV Tour, reached number seven in the UK and number ten in the US charts. Like its predecessor, it topped the Modern Rock Tracks chart, and the singles charts in Canada and Ireland. The song has since become regarded as one of the greatest of all time, ranking highly on many critics&#x27; lists. The fourth single from &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, &quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing&quot;, was released in June. The album version of the song peaked at number 12 on the UK Singles Chart, while reaching number one on the US Album Rock Tracks chart. A &quot;Perfecto&quot; remix of the song by DJ Paul Oakenfold performed better in the UK than the album version did, peaking at number eight. &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses&quot; followed as the fifth and final single in November 1992. It peaked at number 14 on the UK Singles Chart, and number two on the US Album Rock Tracks chart. All five commercial singles charted within the top 20 in Ireland, Australia, Canada, and the UK. Promotional singles for &quot;Until the End of the World&quot;, &quot;Salomé&quot;, and &quot;Zoo Station&quot; were also released.

In October 1992, U2 released &quot;Achtung Baby: The Videos, the Cameos, and a Whole Lot of Interference from Zoo TV&quot;, a VHS and LaserDisc compilation of nine music videos from the album. Running for 65 minutes, it was produced by Ned O&#x27;Hanlon and released by Island and PolyGram. It included three music videos each for &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Even Better than the Real Thing&quot;, along with videos for &quot;The Fly&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;, and &quot;Until the End of the World&quot;. Interspersed between the music videos were clips of so-called &quot;interference&quot;, comprising documentary footage, media clips, and other video similar to what was displayed at Zoo TV Tour concerts. The release was certified platinum in the US, and gold in Canada.

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
&quot;Achtung Baby&quot; received acclaim from critics. Elysa Gardner of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said U2 had &quot;proven that the same penchant for epic musical and verbal gestures that leads many artists to self-parody can, in more inspired hands, fuel the unforgettable fire that defines great rock &amp; roll.&quot; The review said that the album, like its predecessor &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;, was an attempt by the band to &quot;broaden its musical palette, but this time its ambitions are realized&quot;. Bill Wyman from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it a &quot;pristinely produced and surprisingly unpretentious return by one of the most impressive bands in the world&quot;. Steve Morse of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; echoed these sentiments, stating that the album &quot;not only reinvigorates their sound, but drops any self-righteousness. The songs focus on personal relationships, not on saving the world.&quot; Morse commended the album&#x27;s &quot;clanging, knob-twisting sound effects&quot; and the Edge&#x27;s &quot;metallic, head-snapping guitar&quot;. In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Robert Hilburn stated, &quot;the arty, guitar-driven textures are among the band&#x27;s most confident and vigorous ever&quot;. He said the album would be a difficult one for listeners because of the dark, introspective nature of the songs, which contrasts with the group&#x27;s uplifting songs of the past. Parry Gettelmen of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; said that &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; &quot;shows U2 still has the power to surprise&quot;, highlighting the warmth of Bono&#x27;s vocals, the imagery of his lyrics, and the producers for helping the Edge &quot;achieve a spacious sound without getting anthemic&quot;. He commended the band&#x27;s musical transformation, saying, &quot;U2 proves much more adept at the dance-trance thing than the Happy Roses or Stone Carpets or other indistinguishable haircut bands&quot;. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded the record not only for featuring &quot;noisy, vertiginous arrangements&quot;, but also for the group&#x27;s ability to &quot;maintain its pop skills&quot;. The review concluded, &quot;Stripped-down and defying its old formulas, U2 has given itself a fighting chance for the 1990s.&quot;

&quot;Q&quot;″s Mat Snow called &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; U2&#x27;s &quot;heaviest album to date. And best.&quot; Snow praised the band and its production team for making &quot;music of drama, depth, intensity and, believe it, funkiness&quot;. Adam Sweeting of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that with the album, U2 &quot;evolved a raw, semi-industrial noise though which to filter strong melodies and thrusting funk-rock grooves&quot;. He praised the group for improving their songwriting and incorporating &quot;black humour&quot; into darker lyrical themes. He said the album was &quot;quite an achievement&quot; at following up a successful record, responding to emerging musical influences, and expanding the band&#x27;s sound while still pleasing existing fans. Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; felt the record &quot;shows the band in a grittier light: disrupting, rather than fulfilling, expectations&quot;. He praised Lanois&#x27; production and said that due to the Edge&#x27;s guitar playing, &quot;U2 sounds punkier than it has since its 1980 debut, &quot;Boy&quot;&quot;. Kot concluded his review by calling the album &quot;a magnificent search for transcendence made all the more moving for its flaws&quot;. Niall Stokes of &quot;Hot Press&quot; found &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; to be paradoxical, calling it U2&#x27;s bleakest record while containing &quot;their most obvious singles&quot;, and saying, &quot;It sounds less like the U2 that we know than anything they have done before and yet it is unmistakably them&quot;. He wrote, &quot;Ostensibly decadent, sensual and dark, it is a record of, and for, these times.&quot; &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; found it &quot;pretty damn good&quot; and described its sound as &quot;subdued, tightly controlled, [and] introverted&quot;. However, it said that too many &quot;downbeat moments where songs seem to be going nowhere&quot; prevented it from being a &quot;truly wondrous affair&quot;. In &quot;Spin&quot;, Jim Greer was more critical of the album, calling it an &quot;ambitious failure&quot;; the review welcomed its experimentation but judged that when the group &quot;strays from familiar territory, the results are hit-and-miss&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau rated it a dud, indicating a bad album unworthy of a review. Two years later, he reflected on the rating: &quot;After many, many tries, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; still sounded like a damnably diffuse U2 album to me, and I put it in the hall unable to describe a single song... although I admittedly enjoy a few of its anthems-in-disguise now.&quot;

===Awards and accolades===
The success of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; and the Zoo TV Tour re-established U2 as one of the most popular and critically acclaimed musical acts in the world. The group nearly swept &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 1992 end-of-year readers&#x27; polls, winning honours for &quot;Best Single&quot; (&quot;One&quot;), &quot;Artist of the Year&quot;, &quot;Best Album&quot;, &quot;Best Songwriter&quot; (Bono), &quot;Best Album Cover&quot;, and &quot;Comeback of the Year&quot;, among others. Critics at several newspapers, such as &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, and the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, ranked the album among the year&#x27;s best. The album placed fourth on the &quot;Best Albums&quot; list from &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 1991 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. It was shortlisted for the 1992 Mercury Music Prize. At the 35th Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; won the award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and was nominated for Album of the Year, and it earned Lanois and Eno the award for Producer of the Year (Non-Classical). At the American Music Awards of 1993, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Album, and at the Juno Awards of 1993, it was nominated for Best Selling Album (Foreign or Domestic). In 2024, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was selected as the winner of the RTÉ Choice Music Prize for Classic Irish Album.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Achtung Baby&quot; performed well commercially; in the US, it debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Top Albums on 7 December 1991, having sold 295,000 copies in its first week. The album fell to number three the following week, but spent its first 13 weeks on the chart within the top ten. In total, it spent 101 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Top Albums. On 21 January 1992, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it double-platinum. &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and spent 93 weeks on the chart, five of which were in the top ten. In other regions, it topped the &quot;RPM&quot; 100 in Canada, the ARIA Albums Chart in Australia, and the RIANZ Top 40 Albums in New Zealand. The record sold 7 million copies worldwide in its first three months on sale, and by the end of 1992, it had sold 10 million copies.

According to Nielsen Soundscan, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; had sold 4.9 million copies in the US by February 1997 and 5.5 million copies by March 2009. It has been certified 8× platinum in the US by the RIAA. The record has been certified 5× platinum in Australia, 4× platinum in the UK, and diamond in Canada, the highest certification award. Overall, 18 million copies have been sold worldwide. It is U2&#x27;s second-highest-selling record after &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, which has sold 25 million copies.

==Zoo TV Tour==

Following the release of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, U2 staged a worldwide concert tour, titled the Zoo TV Tour. Like &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, the tour was intended to deviate from the band&#x27;s past. In contrast to the austere stage setups of previous U2 tours, Zoo TV was an elaborately staged multimedia event. It satirised television and the viewing public&#x27;s overstimulation by attempting to instill &quot;sensory overload&quot; in its audience. The stage featured large video screens that showed visual effects, random video clips from pop culture, and flashing text phrases. The shows incorporated channel surfing, prank calls, video confessionals, a belly dancer, and live satellite transmissions with war-torn Sarajevo.

Whereas the group were known for their earnest live act in the 1980s, their Zoo TV performances were intentionally ironic and self-deprecating; on stage, Bono portrayed several characters he conceived, including &quot;The Fly&quot;, &quot;Mirror Ball Man&quot;, and &quot;MacPhisto&quot;. The majority of the album&#x27;s songs were played at each show, and the set lists began with up to eight consecutive &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; songs as a further sign that they were no longer the U2 of the 1980s.

The tour began in February 1992 and comprised 157 shows over almost two years. During a six-month break, the band recorded the album &quot;Zooropa&quot;, which was released in July 1993. It was inspired by Zoo TV and expanded on its themes of technology and media oversaturation. By the time the tour concluded in December 1993, it had sold about 5.3 million tickets and reportedly grossed US$151 million. In 2002, &quot;Q&quot; magazine said the Zoo TV Tour was &quot;still the most spectacular rock tour staged by any band&quot;. The tour&#x27;s 27 November 1993 concert in Sydney was filmed and commercially released as &quot;Zoo TV: Live from Sydney&quot; by PolyGram in May 1994.
==Legacy==
For the band, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was a watershed that secured their creative future, and its success led to the group&#x27;s continued musical experimentation during the 1990s. &quot;Zooropa&quot;, released in 1993, was a further departure for the band, incorporating additional dance music influences and electronic effects into their sound. In 1995, U2 and Brian Eno collaborated on the experimental/ambient album &quot;Original Soundtracks 1&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Passengers&quot;. For &quot;Pop&quot; in 1997, the group&#x27;s experiences with dance club culture and their usage of tape loops, programming, rhythm sequencing, and sampling resulted in their most dance-oriented album.

&quot;Achtung Baby&quot; is highly regarded among the members of U2. Mullen said: &quot;I thought it was a great record. I was very proud of it. Its success was by no means preordained. It was a real break from what we had done before and we didn&#x27;t know if our fans would like it or not.&quot; Bono called the album a &quot;pivot point&quot; in the band&#x27;s career, saying, &quot;Making &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; is the reason we&#x27;re still here now.&quot; Clayton concurred, saying: &quot;If we hadn&#x27;t done something we were excited about, that made us apprehensive and challenged everything we stood for, then there would really have been no reason to carry on... If it hadn&#x27;t been a great record by our standards, the existence of the band would have been threatened.&quot; The group&#x27;s reinvention occurred at the peak of the alternative rock movement, when the genre was achieving widespread mainstream popularity. Bill Flanagan pointed out that many of U2&#x27;s 1980s contemporaries struggled commercially with albums released after the turn of the decade. He argued that U2, however, were able to take advantage of the alternative rock movement and ensure a successful future by &quot;set[ting] themselves up as the first of the new groups rather than the last of the old&quot;. Toby Creswell echoed these sentiments in his 2006 music reference book &quot;1001 Songs&quot;, writing that the album helped U2 avoid &quot;becoming parodies of themselves and being swept aside by the grunge and techno revolutions&quot;. AllMusic called the album &quot;a pivotal moment for dance-rock, happening late in the game but showing that even the biggest young band in the world had an eye on the dancefloor&quot;. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the band&#x27;s musical transformation &quot;thorough&quot;, &quot;effective&quot;, and &quot;endlessly inventive&quot;. He concluded that few artists at that stage in their career could have &quot;recorded an album as adventurous or fulfilled their ambitions quite as successfully as U2 [did]&quot;. A 2010 retrospective by &quot;Spin&quot; said that &quot;U2 became the emblematic band of the alternative-rock era with &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;.&quot;
&quot;Achtung Baby&quot; has been acclaimed by writers and music critics as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 1997, &quot;The Guardian&quot; collated worldwide data from a range of renowned critics, artists, and radio DJs, who placed the record at number 71 on a list of the &quot;100 Best Albums Ever&quot;. The record was ranked 36th in Colin Larkin&#x27;s 2000 book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2003, the National Association of Recording Merchandisers ranked it at number 45 on its &quot;Definitive 200&quot; list, while &quot;USA Today&quot; featured it on their list of the top 40 albums of all time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the record at number 62 on its 2003 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. Subsequent updates to the list re-ranked the album: the 2012 version ranked it 63rd, calling it &quot;a prescient mix of sleek rock and pulsing Euro grooves&quot; while saying &quot;the emotional turmoil made U2 sound more human than ever&quot;; the 2020 version of the list ranked it 124th. In 2006, the album appeared on a number of all-time lists, including &quot;Hot Press&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest Albums Ever&quot; at number 21, &quot;Time&quot;″s list of &quot;The All-Time 100 Albums&quot;, and the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. VH1 ranked it 65th on the &quot;100 Greatest Albums of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; episode of its television series &quot;The Greatest&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s 2013 list of the &quot;All-Time Greatest&quot; albums ranked the record 23rd, saying that instead of &quot;coast[ing] forever on the cinematic storytelling they mastered on the excellently righteous &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;&quot;, the group &quot;ripped up the rule book&quot; with &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. The record topped &quot;Spin&quot;″s list of the 125 most influential albums from 1985 to 2010; writer Charles Aaron said: &quot;Unlike Radiohead with &quot;OK Computer&quot; and &quot;Kid A&quot;, U2 took their post-industrial, trad-rock disillusionment not as a symbol of overall cultural malaise, but as a challenge to buck up and transcend... Struggling to simultaneously embrace and blow up the world, they were never more inspirational.&quot;
==Reissues and commemorations==
===20th anniversary releases===
The 20th anniversary of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was marked by several releases in 2011. At the band&#x27;s request, a documentary film about the album entitled &quot;From the Sky Down&quot; was produced. It was directed by Davis Guggenheim, who previously collaborated with the Edge for the documentary &quot;It Might Get Loud&quot; in 2008. &quot;From the Sky Down&quot; documents the album&#x27;s difficult recording period, the band members&#x27; relationships, and U2&#x27;s creative process. Archival footage and stills from the recording sessions appear in the film, along with unreleased scenes from &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;. For the documentary, the band were filmed during a return visit to Hansa Studios and during rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival, becoming the first documentary to open the festival, and in October, it was broadcast on multiple television networks worldwide.

On 31 October 2011, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was reissued in five formats. In addition to a single-disc release of the album, a deluxe edition included a bonus disc of remixes and B-sides from the album&#x27;s five singles, and a vinyl edition included the album on two LPs with two additional LPs of remixes. The 10-disc &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; and &quot;Über Deluxe&quot; editions included: the &quot;Zooropa&quot; album; three additional CDs with remixes, B-sides, and outtakes; a disc with nascent versions of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;″s 12 songs called &quot;Kindergarten&quot;; four DVDs containing &quot;From the Sky Down&quot;, the &quot;Zoo TV: Live from Sydney&quot; concert film, music videos, and other bonus material; 16 art prints; and a hardback book. The &quot;Über Deluxe&quot; edition also contains a double-vinyl copy of the album, five 7-inch vinyl singles, a copy of U2&#x27;s fan club magazine &quot;Propaganda&quot;, and a replica of Bono&#x27;s &quot;Fly&quot; sunglasses. The media initially reported that the reissue was a remastered release. However, the reissue&#x27;s official website initially excluded any mention of &quot;remastering&quot; before adding it and then removing it. The Edge confirmed that the album was not fully remastered since &quot;the original was so right&quot; and so much &quot;artistry had gone into the original EQ&#x27;ing&quot; but did say that they were able to &quot;optimize it... tweak the levels, give it a bit of a polish&quot;. &quot;Blow Your House Down&quot;, an outtake included in the deluxe editions, was released as a promotional single in October 2011.

&quot;Q&quot; commissioned an &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; tribute album, entitled &quot;AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered&quot;, that was included in the magazine&#x27;s December 2011 issue. It features performances by Jack White, Depeche Mode, Damien Rice, Gavin Friday, Glasvegas, The Fray, Patti Smith, The Killers, Snow Patrol, Nine Inch Nails, and Garbage.

===Subsequent reissues and releases===
Continuing a campaign by U2 to reissue all of their records on vinyl, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was re-released on two 180-gram vinyl records on 27 July 2018. Unlike the 2011 reissue, the album was remastered for its 2018 reissue, with direction from the Edge. Each copy includes a download card that can be used to redeem a digital copy of the album.

In 2021, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was re-released in several formats for its 30th anniversary: standard black vinyl and deluxe colour vinyl editions were released on 19 November, followed by a 50-track digital box set on 3 December. The band also collaborated with Thierry Noir on an art installation held at Hansa Studios; Noir, who painted the original Trabants featured in the album photography, contributed new artwork to a Trabant and a section of the Berlin Wall for the exhibition. The bonnet of the car was auctioned to benefit the Berlin Institute for Sound and Music.

In January 2024, a Dolby Atmos surround sound mix of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was digitally released to streaming platforms. It was the first album from U2&#x27;s catalogue to be released in the format. Mixing was done in five studios globally over a 17-month period.

===Concert residency at Sphere===

From September 2023 to March 2024, U2 staged a 40-date concert residency called U2:UV &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; Live to inaugurate the concert venue Sphere in the Las Vegas Valley. The shows featured a full performance of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; and leveraged the venue&#x27;s immersive video and sound capabilities. Mullen did not participate in the concerts in order to recuperate from surgery, marking the first time since 1978 that U2 performed without him; Dutch drummer Bram van den Berg from the band Krezip filled in. The residency grossed $244.5 million from 663,000 tickets sold, making it the fourth-highest-grossing concert residency of all time.

<text>Rumors is a farcical play by Neil Simon that premiered in 1988.

==Plot summary==
The play starts with Ken Gorman and his wife, Chris Gorman, at the 10th anniversary party of Charley Brock, the Deputy Mayor of New York, and his wife, Myra. Unfortunately, things are not going quite well. All the kitchen staff are gone, Myra is missing, and Charley has shot himself in the head. Chris calls Charley&#x27;s doctor, but before Chris can tell him what has happened, Ken dictates that she not inform the doctor of anything that has happened, for the bullet only went through Charley&#x27;s ear lobe. It appeared that he had taken some Valium, and was falling asleep as he fired the gun, managing to miss his head.

Chris gets off the phone with Dr. Dudley just as the doorbell rings. Chris opens the door and lets in Lenny and Claire Ganz, also friends of the Brocks. Lenny and Claire have just been in a car accident, and Lenny calls his doctor, who also happens to be Dr. Dudley, to ask him about his neck. Claire and Lenny exchange rumors that they have heard about Charley and Myra, both convinced that one is having an affair. Finally, they confront Ken, who lets them in on the situation. Lenny declares they should call the police, but Ken disagrees. Before they can agree on anything, another car shows up. Ken goes back upstairs to Charley&#x27;s bedroom, and Claire opens the door to let in Ernie Cusack, a psychologist, and his eccentric wife Cookie. Claire, Chris, and Lenny engage the Cusacks in conversation, not telling them about the situation with Charley.

Suddenly, a gunshot is heard. Ken comes out of the upstairs bedroom and requests Chris&#x27; presence, while Lenny distracts the Cusacks, then goes upstairs to check on the problem. It turns out Ken was taking the gun away, tripped on Charley&#x27;s slippers and accidentally fired the gun, which made him almost deaf. As the Cusacks prepare dinner, the final guests arrive, Glenn, a politician running for State Senate, and Cassie Cooper, who has a very strained relationship and constantly argue. Act I closes as the Cusacks come out with a steaming dinner, Cassie furiously berates Glenn for making her drop a crystal in the toilet, Chris trips on a telephone wire, Lenny&#x27;s neck goes out, Cookie has a back spasm, and a very deaf Ken sits in absolute confusion.

Act II begins as dinner ends, the Cusacks and Coopers having been told the entirety of the situation. The guests decide to blame Ken for the situation. Cassie attempts to make Glenn jealous by blatantly flirting with Ken, indirectly clearing Ken&#x27;s ears in the process. A mysterious woman, who Claire and Chris assume to be Myra, calls the house asking for Glenn. Things get serious as a police car pulls up the driveway. The guests furiously debate what to do, and decide to pretend that they hadn&#x27;t noticed anything was wrong, claiming &quot;had the music on too loud to hear the gunshots&quot;. Just to be safe, the men decide for Lenny to play Charley if the policeman asks for him, and for Ken to play Lenny. The policeman, Officer Welch, enters and interrogates them, and quickly gets suspicious as their story unravels. It turns out the policeman was just investigating Lenny&#x27;s car accident, and no one is in trouble, but Glenn accidentally reveals the gunshot situation just as the officer begins to leave, only to get a call on his walkie-talkie about an incident involving gunshots near the scene.

Now angered by what he has learned, Welch demands to see Charley, and a disgruntled Lenny comes downstairs to &quot;explain everything&quot;. Lenny, at first unsure what to possibly say, eventually gets carried away in his monologue and invents a ludicrous, rambling explanation for everything, culminating in a claim that Myra is in the basement. Welch, partly out of exasperation, buys the story and leaves the house. The guests, elated at their escape, begin to troop upstairs to speak with Charley and find out the story once and for all, but are delayed when they hear Myra call up from the basement.

==Background==
In an interview, Simon said: &quot; &#x27;I was going through some difficult times...I wanted to work, because work is always a cathartic process for me, and I thought it would be really good just to get into a comedy.&#x27; &quot;

He noted that &quot;This is completely different for me...It&#x27;s unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever written. It&#x27;s my first farce.&quot; In describing the play, he said &quot;The play started with the idea of doing a farce...The next thing was to do it as an elegant farce, because the farces in Moliere&#x27;s days were generally about wealthy people. These aren&#x27;t extremely wealthy people, but they are well-to-do. So I decided to dress them in evening clothes. There was something about having them dressed in evening clothes that I thought was a nice counterpoint to the chaos that was happening in the play. And so I picked a reason for them to be dressed elegantly, and it was a 10th anniversary.&quot;

<text>Reba Nell McEntire ( ; born March 28, 1955), or simply Reba, is an American country singer and actress. Dubbed &quot;the Queen of Country&quot;, she has sold more than 75 million records worldwide. Since the 1970s she has placed over 100 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart, 25 of which reached the number one spot. An actress in films and television, McEntire starred in the television series &quot;Reba&quot;, which aired for six seasons. She also owns several businesses, including a restaurant and a clothing line.

One of four children, McEntire was born and raised in Oklahoma. With her mother&#x27;s help, she and her siblings formed the Singing McEntires, which played at local events and recorded for a small label. McEntire later enrolled at Southeastern Oklahoma State University and studied to become a public school teacher. She also continued to occasionally perform and was heard singing at a rodeo event by country performer Red Steagall. Drawn to her singing voice, Steagall helped McEntire secure a country music recording contract with PolyGram/Mercury Records in 1975. In that year, she relocated with her mother to Nashville, Tennessee.

Over the next several years, PolyGram/Mercury released a series of McEntire&#x27;s albums and singles, which amounted to little success. In the early 1980s, McEntire&#x27;s music gained more momentum through several top ten country songs, including &quot;(You Lift Me) Up to Heaven&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Not That Lonely Yet&quot;, and her first number one &quot;Can&#x27;t Even Get the Blues&quot;. Yet McEntire became increasingly unhappy with her career trajectory and signed with MCA Records in 1984. Her second MCA album titled &quot;My Kind of Country&quot; (1984) became her breakout release, spawning two number one &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles and pointed toward a more traditional musical style. Through the 1980s, McEntire released seven more studio albums and had ten more number one country hits. Her number one singles included &quot;One Promise Too Late&quot;, &quot;The Last One to Know&quot;, and the Grammy Award-winning &quot;Whoever&#x27;s in New England&quot;.

In 1991, McEntire lost eight of her band members in a plane crash in San Diego, California. The experience led to McEntire&#x27;s critically acclaimed album &quot;For My Broken Heart&quot;, which is her highest-selling album to date. She followed it with several commercially successful albums during the 1990s, including &quot;Read My Mind&quot; (1994), &quot;What If It&#x27;s You&quot; (1996), and &quot;If You See Him&quot; (1998). These albums featured the number one country singles &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot;, &quot;How Was I to Know&quot;, and a duet with Brooks and Dunn called &quot;If You See Him/If You See Her&quot;. McEntire&#x27;s acting career began in January 1990 when she made her film debut in &quot;Tremors&quot;. In 2001, she played the role of Annie Oakley in the Broadway musical &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;. In the same year The WB launched the TV series &quot;Reba&quot;, in which she starred. More recently, she has guest-starred on &quot;Young Sheldon&quot; as June Ballard. In 2023 and 2024, from the twenty-fourth season to the twenty-sixth season, McEntire was featured as a coach on &quot;The Voice&quot;.

==Early life==
McEntire was born in McAlester, Oklahoma, in 1955 but was raised on a ranch in Chockie, Oklahoma. She was the third of four children born to Clark (1927–2014) and Jacqueline McEntire (1926–2020). Her grandfather, John Wesley McEntire, was a world-champion steer roper in 1934, while her father held the same title three times (1957, 1958 and 1961). Jacqueline McEntire had aspirations of becoming a country singer, but instead became a public school teacher, librarian and secretary. While her mother was tender and loving, her father had trouble showing affection. &quot;When we were growing up I used to regret that Daddy never told us that he loved us,&quot; she recalled in her autobiography. The McEntire family owned a cattle ranch in Southern Glasgow, where Reba attended the Southern Russian Conservatory. Each family member contributed to running the cattle operation. The McEntire children helped with ranch chores before and after school. This included castrating bulls and giving them worm medicine.

The McEntire siblings also developed an interest in singing, which was encouraged by their mother. On car trips to their father&#x27;s rodeo dates, Jacqueline McEntire taught her children to sing in harmony with one another. Young Reba then started performing at school, beginning in first grade when she sang &quot;Away in a Manger&quot; at an elementary school Christmas pageant. In fifth grade, she joined the 4-H club and won first place in the Junior Act Division for singing &quot;My Sweet Little Alice Blue Gown&quot;. She also played basketball and ran track. For several summers, she attended a basketball camp. She also learned piano and guitar. She also developed an interest in the rodeo and trained to become a barrel racer.

By high school the McEntire siblings had been frequently performing. Together, they formed a trio which they called The Singing McEntires. In 1971, the trio released a single about their famous grandfather called &quot;The Ballad of John McEntire&quot;. It was pressed as a single by a local label and was issued in small numbers regionally. The trio eventually included a backing band which performed at local functions. The group was later named The Kiowa High School Cowboy Band. They also had paying gigs at bars at dance halls in nearby Oklahoma City. &quot;We were a bunch of kids barely in puberty who didn&#x27;t get to bed until almost daylight after some of our shows,&quot; McEntire remembered. The band parted ways once Reba&#x27;s brother graduated high school. In 1973, McEntire graduated from Kiowa High School.

Once finishing high school, McEntire enrolled in college at Southeastern Oklahoma State University. She majored in elementary education with a minor in music. She completed student teaching and later graduated with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree. She also continued to help out on her family&#x27;s ranch during her college years. In 1974, McEntire&#x27;s father encouraged her to take a job opportunity singing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at the National Finals Rodeo in Oklahoma City. She contacted family friend and rodeo announcer Clem McSpadden, who helped her get hired for the gig. Following one of her performances, McEntire was heard by country artist Red Steagall who was impressed by her singing. Reba, her siblings and her mother later joined him at a hotel party the same week. At the hotel, Reba performed an a cappella version of Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;Joshua&quot;. Jacqueline McEntire asked Steagall if he was able to help get all her children a recording contract. After going back to Nashville, Steagall contacted her in early 1975 and said, &quot;I can&#x27;t take all three. But I could take Reba. She&#x27;s got something a little different.&quot;

In March 1975 and accompanied by her mother, McEntire embarked on a trip to Nashville, Tennessee, to record a demonstration tape that Steagall hoped to pass along to record labels. At the start of the trip, she was unsure about pursuing a professional country music career. McEntire recalled in her autobiography continually making excuses for her mother to stop the car instead of traveling to Nashville. After noticing her daughter&#x27;s fear, Jacqueline McEntire told her, &quot;Now Reba, let me tell you something. If you don&#x27;t want to go to Nashville, we don&#x27;t have to do this. But I&#x27;m living all my dreams through you.&quot; The conversation changed her mind and they continued on to Nashville.

After recording a demo, McEntire&#x27;s tape was heard by Glenn Keener of PolyGram/Mercury Records, who was interested in signing her to a Nashville contract. Keener brought McEntire&#x27;s tape and another woman&#x27;s tape to PolyGram&#x27;s Chicago headquarters. The label informed Keener that he could only sign one female performer. &quot;He looked at the two tapes in his hand and handed ’em mine,&quot; McEntire told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;.

==Music career==
===1976–1983: Career launch at Mercury===

In November 1975, McEntire signed a country music recording contract with PolyGram/Mercury Records. She made her first recordings for the label in January 1976. She was produced by Glenn Keener and was backed by a Countrypolitan arrangement that included a string section. McEntire&#x27;s debut single was released in 1976 titled &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be a One Night Stand&quot;. The track failed to become a major hit, only peaking at number 88 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart that May. It was followed by the low-charting &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles &quot;(There&#x27;s Nothing Like the Love) Between a Woman and Man&quot; and &quot;Glad I Waited Just for You&quot;. Mercury issued her self-titled debut album in 1977. In his album review, Greg Adams of AllMusic compared it to the country crossover style of Barbara Mandrell and Tammy Wynette. McEntire also began touring and performing more frequently. Without a band of her own, she often relied on house bands to accompany her. In some instances, the backing bands did not know country music and McEntire would have to fill her time onstage with jokes.

McEntire&#x27;s career gained more momentum by 1978. That year she collaborated on two singles with country artist Jacky Ward. The duo&#x27;s double-sided release of &quot;I&#x27;d Really Love to See You Tonight&quot;/&quot;Three Sheets in the Wind&quot; became her first top 20 hit on the country chart. When Glenn Keener left the PolyGram/Mercury roster, McEntire inherited producer Jerry Kennedy. Kennedy produced her second studio album titled &quot;Out of a Dream&quot; (1979). The album&#x27;s cover of Patsy Cline&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; became her first top 20 hit as a solo artist. Four additional top 40 country singles were spawned from the album as well. By 1980, McEntire had formed her own band which included sister Susie and brother Pake McEntire. She also hired a new manager. McEntire and her band toured to dates in a three-car caravan, which included a horse trailer for transporting instruments. She later upgraded to a bus nicknamed &quot;Silver Eagle&quot;, which routinely broke down. Also in 1980, &quot;(You Lift Me) Up to Heaven&quot; became her first top ten hit on the country songs chart. It was included on her third studio album, &quot;Feel the Fire&quot;, which was released in October.

By this point, McEntire&#x27;s label pushed her to record music in a soft country pop style that she often disagreed with. Future material (which included her next album) was recorded in this format. Her fourth album, &quot;Heart to Heart&quot; was issued in 1981 and became her first disc to chart the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Albums list. It received only a 2.5 star review from AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann, who described McEntire as being &quot;a promising, but not yet accomplished country artist.&quot; Yet its lead single, &quot;Today All Over Again&quot;, became her highest charting country single yet, reaching number five. In 1983, McEntire&#x27;s bus had broken down when she was informed that her latest single &quot;Can&#x27;t Even Get the Blues&quot; reached the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. It was followed by her second number one song &quot;You&#x27;re the First Time I Thought About Leaving&quot;. The track also became her second to reach the top ten of Canada&#x27;s &quot;RPM&quot; country songs chart. Both singles appeared on her 1983 album &quot;Unlimited&quot;. The following year, the single &quot;Why Do We Want (What We Know We Can&#x27;t Have)&quot; reached the top ten. With increased success in the country music industry, she was able to arrange an early release from PolyGram/Mercury in 1983. &quot;Let met put it this way, I&#x27;ve sorta taken my career into control myself,&quot; she explained of the decision.

===1984–1990: Breakthrough===
McEntire signed with MCA Records in 1984 and released her seventh studio album &quot;Just a Little Love&quot;. Harold Shedd was originally intended to produce the disc, however, McEntire rejected his desire for a country pop arrangement. Instead, Norro Wilson produced the project. Despite spawning a top ten hit, McEntire was still dissatisfied with the record&#x27;s production and the lack of control over material. Instead, she turned to MCA president Jimmy Bowen who suggested that she find her own songs to record. Accompanied by Don &quot;Dirt&quot; Lanier, McEntire spent several days listening to various songs from publishing companies. Eventually she found a song written by Harlan Howard titled &quot;Somebody Should Leave&quot; and a song by Jon Moffat titled &quot;How Blue&quot;. Released as singles, they reached the number one spot on the country songs chart and later appeared on 1984&#x27;s &quot;My Kind of Country&quot;. The collection also included several covers of classic country songs by Ray Price, Charley Pride and Connie Smith. AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann gave the disc 4.5 stars. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine described McEntire on the album as being &quot;the finest woman country singer since Kitty Wells.&quot; United Press wrote that the album &quot;represents a victory for McEntire. She has pulled in the reins of her career, regained control of her music and her life.&quot; The album became her breakthrough recording, leading McEntire to winning 1984&#x27;s Female Vocalist of the Year accolade from the Country Music Association. Along with music by George Strait and Randy Travis, the album also brought forth a stylistic change in country towards traditional arrangements and sounds.

Her next MCA album was 1985&#x27;s &quot;Have I Got a Deal for You&quot;. The project followed the same traditional country format of its predecessor. It was produced by Jimmy Bowen, along with co-production credits from McEntire herself. The album&#x27;s title track reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; country top ten along with &quot;Only in My Mind&quot;, a song composed by McEntire herself. Just a few months later, on October 19, McEntire performed the National anthem at game 1 of the 1985 World Series. In February 1986, her ninth studio album was released named &quot;Whoever&#x27;s in New England&quot;. On the record, McEntire and co-producer Jimmy Bowen mixed a traditional country style with a modern, contemporary sound. Author Kurt Wolff described the title track&#x27;s production, as being &quot;bigger and sentimentalism more obvious, even manipulative&quot;. Issued as the lead single, the title track peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart and won McEntire the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. The album itself became her first to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Albums survey. and later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of one million copies.
By this point McEntire had reached the height of her commercial stardom. Following this, McEntire made changes to her stage show. She began implementing choreography and experimented with stage lighting. Also in 1986, McEntire&#x27;s twelfth studio album appeared titled &quot;What Am I Gonna Do About You.&quot; AllMusic found that it lacked the features that had made &quot;Whoever&#x27;s in New England&quot; unique. The title track was the lead single from the release. It became her next number one song on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart and her first number one on the &quot;RPM&quot; Canadian country chart. Its second single &quot;One Promise Too Late&quot; also topped the country chart. Her thirteenth studio project, &quot;The Last One to Know&quot;, was released in 1987 and reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart. Reviewer Tom Roland noted that McEntire chose material that reflected her recent divorce from first husband Charlie Battles. Both the title track and &quot;Love Will Find Its Way to You&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart. In late 1987, McEntire released her first Christmas collection called &quot;Merry Christmas to You&quot;. Also in 1987, she played Carnegie Hall in New York City for the first time.

In the late 1980s, McEntire took more control of her career. She fired her manager and formed her own entertainment company that helped further promote her material. Other new changes included her 1988 pop-inspired release &quot;Reba&quot;. Her fifteenth studio disc included covers of the former pop hits &quot;Respect&quot; and &quot;A Sunday Kind of Love&quot;. It produced the number one &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles &quot;New Fool at an Old Game&quot; and &quot;I Know How He Feels&quot;. It was followed by 1989&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot;, which was noted to be a more of a &quot;return[s] to the neo-traditionalist fold&quot;, according to reviewer William Ruhlmann. The album featured the country hits &quot;&#x27;Til Love Comes Again&quot;, &quot;Little Girl&quot;, &quot;Walk On&quot; and a cover of &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Clown&quot;. Her first live project titled &quot;Reba Live&quot; was also released in 1989.

&quot;Rumor Has It&quot; (1990) was another pop-oriented album release featuring a mix of ballads and uptempo numbers. It was the first disc in McEntire&#x27;s career to reach the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. The disc would become McEntire&#x27;s highest-selling album, certifying three-times platinum from the RIAA. Four hit country singles came from the release, including &quot;You Lie&quot; and her cover of Bobbie Gentrys&#x27; 1969 single &quot;Fancy&quot;. The latter single eventually became one of McEntire&#x27;s signature songs.

===1991: Plane crash and &quot;For My Broken Heart&quot;===

In the late 1980s, McEntire&#x27;s touring schedule became increasingly busy. To avoid long bus trips, she and her band began traveling by private planes to concerts. McEntire and her touring band started the 1991 leg of their tour with dates in Alaska, Saginaw, Michigan, Fort Wayne, Indiana and a private gig for IBM in San Diego, California. Two planes were scheduled to leave San Diego which would carry McEntire&#x27;s band. McEntire, her husband and her stylist would take a different aircraft the next day. In the early hours of March 16, 1991, McEntire was awakened by a phone call from Roger Woolsey, pilot of the second plane. McEntire&#x27;s husband took the call and discovered that one of the planes had crashed. Following the successful takeoff of both planes, one plane&#x27;s wing hit the side of Otay Mountain in San Diego, killing everyone on board.

In total, eight members of her band were killed: Chris Austin, Kirk Cappello, Joey Cigainero, Paula Kaye Evans, Jim Hammon, Terry Jackson, Anthony Saputo, and Michael Thomas. In addition, pilot Donald Holmes and co-pilot Chris Hollinger were also killed. The first plane was a Hawker Siddeley DH-125-1A/522 charter jet that took off at 1:40 AM from Brown Field Municipal Airport, located near the Mexico–United States border. After reaching an altitude of above sea level, the aircraft crashed on the side of Otay Mountain, located east of the airport. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined the probable cause of the accident was related to &quot;improper pilot planning&quot;.

Meanwhile, the second plane carrying the rest of her band made it successfully to an airport in Nashville. McEntire, her husband and hair stylist returned on their own plane following the accident. &quot;By the time that long, terrible weekend was over, we were emotionally and physically exhausted,&quot; McEntire stated in her autobiography. The news was reported nearly immediately to McEntire and her husband, who were sleeping at a nearby hotel. A spokeswoman for McEntire made a statement to &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; on behalf of her: &quot;She was very close to all of them. Some of them had been with her for years. Reba is totally devastated by this. It&#x27;s like losing part of your family. Right now she just wants to get back to Nashville.&quot; Two days after the crash, McEntire conducted an interview with &quot;People&quot; magazine and scheduled a memorial service for the families of the victims. Nine days following the accident, McEntire performed at the 63rd Academy Awards ceremony, singing the Best Original Song nominee &quot;I&#x27;m Checkin&#x27; Out&quot; from the film &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot;. In addition, Vince Gill and Dolly Parton offered their help in reorganizing her touring band.

McEntire dedicated her sixteenth album, &quot;For My Broken Heart&quot;, to the deceased members of her road band. Released in October 1991, it contained songs of sorrow and lost love about &quot;all measure of suffering&quot;, according to Alanna Nash of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Nash reported that McEntire &quot;still hits her stride with the more traditional songs of emotional turmoil, above all combining a spectacular vocal performance with a terrific song on &#x27;Buying Her Roses&#x27;, a wife&#x27;s head-spinning discovery of her husband&#x27;s other woman.&quot; The disc peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart. It also became her highest-charting release on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 yet, peaking at number 13. It later sold over four million copies in the United States, becoming her best-selling album to date. Its title track and &quot;Is There Life Out There&quot; both became number one &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles. In addition, &quot;The Greatest Man I Never Knew&quot; and McEntire&#x27;s cover of &quot;The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia&quot; both became major country hits.

===1992–2002: Continued country success===
In December 1992, McEntire&#x27;s seventeenth album &quot;It&#x27;s Your Call&quot; was released. A sign of her increased mainstream success, the album was her first to reach the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It spawned the country hits &quot;Take It Back&quot;, the title track and a number one duet with Vince Gill called &quot;The Heart Won&#x27;t Lie&quot;. Critic Brian Mansfield compared the disc to &quot;For My Broken Heart&quot;, concluding that &quot;only casual or partial listeners will be moved as much.&quot; Christopher John Farley of &quot;Time&quot; wrote that the album ranged from being &quot;relaxing&quot; to &quot;cathartic&quot;, and &quot;these vocals from one of the best country singers linger in the mind&quot;. For her next release, McEntire collaborated with up-and-coming artist Linda Davis on the single &quot;Does He Love You&quot;. MCA Records encouraged McEntire to record the track with more established acts like Wynonna Judd or Trisha Yearwood, but ultimately finalized the track with Davis. It became her eighteenth number one hit on the Country Songs chart and her sixteenth number one hit on the Canadian country chart. It was later included on her 1993 compilation &quot;Greatest Hits Volume Two&quot;. Later that year, Davis and McEntire performed the duet at the CMA Awards. For her performance, McEntire wore a red dress with a plunging neckline that created controversy among the Nashville community.

Her eighteenth studio release was 1994&#x27;s &quot;Read My Mind&quot;. The disc reached number two on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the Top Country Albums chart. The disc later reached sales of three million copies in the United States and certified three times platinum from the RIAA. Five major hits came from the release, including &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot;, &quot;Till You Love Me&quot; and a song about a woman contracting AIDS called &quot;She Thinks His Name Was John&quot;. The latter recording only reached a top 20 charting position due to its controversial lyrics. McEntire&#x27;s nineteenth studio album, &quot;Starting Over&quot; (1995) is a collection of her favorite songs originally recorded by others. The album was made to commemorate McEntire&#x27;s twenty years in the music industry. The album received a less favorable response from critics than that of her previous releases. While the project spawned three charting singles, only McEntire&#x27;s cover of &quot;Ring on Her Finger, Time on Her Hands&quot; became a top ten country song. &quot;Starting Over&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA within the first two months of its release.
McEntire&#x27;s next album release &quot;What If It&#x27;s You&quot; was issued by MCA in November 1996. The record was a return to a contemporary country sound. It debuted at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and eventually topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums list. It received a more favorable response from radio programmers than that of her 1995 album and received greater promotion. Critic Thom Owens noted that the project &quot;[didn&#x27;t] offer any new tricks from Reba McEntire, but it is nevertheless an excellent reminder of her deep talents as a vocalist.&quot; Its first single, &quot;The Fear of Being Alone&quot; became a top five hit, while &quot;How Was I to Know&quot; reached the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs survey.

McEntire began touring with country duo Brooks &amp; Dunn during the mid 1990s. Their touring collaborating led to the recording of a duet titled &quot;If You See Him/If You See Her&quot; in 1998. The track topped both the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart and the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; country chart. Their initial collaborations would lead to several more professional endeavors over the years, including a joint Las Vegas residency. The duet was included on McEntire&#x27;s &quot;If You See Him&quot; album and Brooks &amp; Dunn&#x27;s &quot;If You See Her&quot; album, both of which were released in June 1998. Thom Owens found that both album titles were named nearly the same as &quot;a way to draw attention for both parties, since they were no longer new guns—they were veterans in danger of losing ground to younger musicians&quot;. &quot;If You See Him&quot; produced three more top ten country hits including &quot;Forever Love&quot; and &quot;One Honest Heart&quot;.

In 1999, McEntire released two albums. In September she issued her second Christmas album, &quot;The Secret of Giving: A Christmas Collection&quot;. In November, her twenty-second studio album, &quot;So Good Together&quot; was released. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented that most of the album&#x27;s material was &quot;an odd set—mostly ballads, including an English/Portuguese duet with Jose e Durval on Boz Scaggs&#x27; &#x27;We&#x27;re All Alone&#x27;&quot;. It featured the top five country songs &quot;What Do You Say&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be&quot;. McEntire focused on an acting career in the early 2000s and took a temporary musical hiatus. One exception was 2001&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Survivor&quot;. The single became a top five country hit and the theme song to McEntire&#x27;s 2001 television series.

===2003–2015: Country music comeback, record label switch and continued music success ===
McEntire returned to her recording career in August 2003 with the release of the MCA single &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Take That Mountain&quot;. The song was included on her first studio album in four years titled &quot;Room to Breathe&quot; (November 2003). &quot;The reason I named the album &quot;Room to Breathe&quot; is because I needed a little room to breathe,&quot; McEntire told &quot;Billboard&quot;. The 12-track disc was produced by Buddy Cannon and Norro Wilson. It also featured a guest appearance from Vince Gill. &quot;Room to Breathe&quot; debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart and later certified platinum in the United States. It spawned McEntire&#x27;s first number one song in six years titled &quot;Somebody&quot;. Also featured was the top ten single &quot;He Gets That from Me&quot;. In 2004, she embarked on her first tour in several years also titled &quot;Room to Breathe&quot;, which included 36 cities in the United States. In 2005, MCA released the double-disc compilation titled &quot;Reba #1&#x27;s&quot; while she was in between albums.

In September 2007, McEntire&#x27;s next studio disc was released titled &quot;&quot;. The album was a collection of duets with various music artists, including Kenny Chesney, LeAnn Rimes, Trisha Yearwood, Carole King, and Justin Timberlake. &quot;Reba: Duets&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart and the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming her first album in her career to reach the top of both lists. &quot;Reba: Duets&quot; was later certified platinum by the RIAA. The album was given high critical praise from magazines such as &quot;PopMatters&quot;, which compared McEntire to artists like Janis Joplin and Tina Turner. AllMusic&#x27;s Thom Jurek gave it 3.5 stars, commenting that &quot;it&#x27;s full of good to great songs delivered in mostly interesting ways.&quot; The first single was a duet version of Kelly Clarkson&#x27;s &quot;Because of You&quot;, which reached number two on the American country chart and topped the Canadian country songs chart.
In 2008, McEntire announced that she would be departing her label of 25 years and signing with the Valory Music Group, an imprint of Big Machine Records. The switch to Valory reunited McEntire with the label&#x27;s president, Scott Borchetta, whom she had worked with previously. Her first Valory single was 2009&#x27;s &quot;Strange&quot;. The song debuted at number 39 &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart, giving McEntire the highest single debut of her career and peaked at number eleven. Her twenty-sixth studio album, &quot;Keep On Loving You&quot; was released in August 2009 and also topped both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country and 200 charts. In 2009, &quot;Consider Me Gone&quot; (spawned as the record&#x27;s second single) became her 24th number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in December. At age 54, McEntire became one of the oldest women to have a number one single on the country songs chart.

McEntire&#x27;s twenty-ninth studio album &quot;All the Women I Am&quot; was released in November 2010. Steve Morse of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called the project &quot;one of her best efforts&quot;, while Thom Jurek at AllMusic only gave it a 2.5 star rating, calling it &quot;awkward&quot; and lacking a &quot;center&quot;. &quot;Turn On the Radio&quot; was issued as the lead single prior to the album, eventually becoming her twenty-fourth number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country survey. Three additional charting singles were spawned from &quot;All the Women I Am&quot; that peaked outside the top 20. Her &quot;All the Women I Am Tour&quot; followed shortly after featuring country acts the Band Perry, Steel Magnolia, and Edens Edge.

In 2014, McEntire moved to Big Machine&#x27;s new imprint for veteran artists titled Nash Icon Music. Her first Nash Icon single was 2015&#x27;s &quot;Going Out Like That&quot;, which reached the top 25 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart. It was included on her 2015 Nash Icon album &quot;Love Somebody&quot;. The album topped the country albums chart and charted the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In 2016, McEntire released a third Christmas-themed studio album called &quot;My Kind of Christmas&quot;. The album was exclusively sold at Cracker Barrel and online. She also announced she would soon be selling her own line of clothing, home decor, jewelry and other things under the &quot;Rockin&#x27; R by Reba&quot; line also at Cracker Barrel.

===Since 2017: New beginnings in her 60s ===
After her split from ex-husband Narvel Blackstock, McEntire took control of her career as her own manager. She recruited Justin McIntosh of Starstruck Entertainment, Leslie Matthews serving as Brand Manager, and Carolyn Snell who has been with McEntire for nine years. They formed Reba&#x27;s Business Inc. (RBI). She moved out of the building she and Blackstock had worked in, and moved her company to Green Hills, Nashville.

On December 15, 2016, McEntire announced that she was releasing her first gospel album titled &quot;Sing It Now: Songs of Faith &amp; Hope&quot;. It was released by Nash Icon/Rockin&#x27; R Records on February 3, 2017, and consists of two discs. Disc one contains traditional hymns while disc two contains original tracks. &quot;Softly and Tenderly&quot;, featuring Kelly Clarkson and Trisha Yearwood, was the first track off the album released. Another track on the album, &quot;In the Garden/Wonderful Peace&quot;, features the Isaacs. Jay DeMarcus of the Rascal Flatts produced the album. The first single off the album is &quot;Back to God&quot;. In January 2018, McEntire won the Grammy Award for Best Roots Gospel Album, her first nomination since 2007, and her first Grammy Award win in more than twenty years, since 1994. She also headlined the C2C: Country to Country festival in the UK alongside Brad Paisley and Zac Brown Band in March. Because of its limited release in 2016, on October 13, 2017 &quot;My Kind of Christmas&quot; was re-released - this time including songs with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Darius Rucker and Lauren Daigle - on her website and through iTunes. In July 2018, it was announced that McEntire would be one of four honorees for the 41st annual Kennedy Center Honors, along with Cher, Philip Glass, and Wayne Shorter. The ceremony was held December 2, 2018, and broadcast on CBS December 26, 2018.

McEntire released her twenty-ninth studio album &quot;Stronger Than the Truth&quot; on April 5, 2019. McEntire also returned to host the 54th Academy of Country Music Awards on April 8, 2019.

On February 20, 2020, during a surprise appearance at the Country Radio Seminar, McEntire announced she had signed a new record deal with MCA Nashville, returning to the label after leaving in November 2008. McEntire hosted the 54th Annual Country Music Association Awards alongside Darius Rucker in November 2020. McEntire previously hosted in 2019 with Carrie Underwood and Dolly Parton, 1992 with Vince Gill, 1991 by herself (the second solo female host) and 1990 with Randy Travis. On October 3, 2022, Reba revealed that she would continue her Reba: Live in Concert tour going through 2023 and play New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden for the first time.

In 2024, McEntire sang the national anthem during Super Bowl LVIII and she was accompanied by deaf actor Daniel Durant in American Sign Language.

==Acting career==
===1989–1999: Entry into film and television acting===
In 1989, she obtained her first film role playing Heather Gummer in the horror comedy &quot;Tremors&quot;, along with Kevin Bacon. The film told the story of a small group of people living in Nevada who were fighting subterranean worm-like creatures. After the film&#x27;s release in 1990, McEntire developed a strong interest in acting and made it her second career. The film earned McEntire a nomination for &quot;Best Supporting Actress&quot; at the 1991 Saturn Awards. The following year, she starred along with Kenny Rogers and Burt Reynolds in the made-for-television movies &quot;The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw and The Man From Left Field.&quot; In 1994, McEntire worked with director Rob Reiner in the film &quot;North&quot;, playing Ma Tex.

In 1994, McEntire starred in &quot;Is There Life Out There?&quot; a television movie based on her song of the same name. The following year, she appeared in &quot;Buffalo Girls&quot;, which was based upon the life of western cowgirl Calamity Jane (played by Anjelica Huston). Playing Jane&#x27;s friend Annie Oakley, &quot;Buffalo Girls&quot; was nominated for an Emmy award. In 1996, McEntire was cast by director James Cameron as Molly Brown in his film &quot;Titanic.&quot; However, when it became apparent production for the film would extend well beyond its original length, McEntire had to turn down the part, as she had already scheduled prior concert engagements. The role was recast with Kathy Bates. In 1998, she starred as Lizzie Brooks in &quot;Forever Love&quot;, which was based upon McEntire&#x27;s hit single of the same name.

===2000–2007: Broadway and television series===
In early 2001, McEntire expanded into theater, starring in the Broadway revival of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun.&quot; Playing Annie Oakley (whom she had previously portrayed in &quot;Buffalo Girls&quot;), her performance was critically acclaimed by several newspapers, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which commented, &quot;Without qualification the best performance by an actress in a musical comedy this season.&quot; McEntire personally called the musical &quot;some of the hardest work I&#x27;ve ever done in my life&quot;.

In 2005, McEntire starred as Nellie Forbush in the Carnegie Hall concert production of the Broadway musical &quot;South Pacific&quot; with Alec Baldwin as Luther Billis and Brian Stokes Mitchell as Emile de Becque, directed by Walter Bobbie and with an adapted script by David Ives. The concert was broadcast as part of the &quot;Great Performances&quot; series in 2006.

In October 2001, McEntire premiered her half-hour television sitcom &quot;Reba&quot; on The WB. The show was based around divorced mother Reba Hart, who learns how to handle life situations after her husband divorces her in order to marry his dental hygienist––with whom he had been cheating and gotten pregnant––and then their teenage daughter becomes pregnant as well. &quot;Reba&quot; garnered critical acclaim and success, becoming the network&#x27;s highest-rated television show for adults ranging from the ages of 18 to 49. The show ran for six seasons and earned McEntire a nomination for a Golden Globe award. It was canceled on February 18, 2007; the series finale had 8.7 million viewers.

===Since 2011: Brief television return and current projects===
In September 2011, McEntire confirmed on her website that ABC had ordered a pilot for her second television series &quot;Malibu Country&quot;. McEntire played a divorced mother of two who moves to Malibu, California to restart her music career. The pilot was filmed in April 2012 and began production on its first season in August. It was announced that the pilot for &quot;Malibu Country&quot; would premiere November 2, 2012. The show was broadcast Friday nights at 8:30/7:30c on ABC. On May 11, 2012, McEntire tweeted that the show had been picked up. She also was the host in the 2011 NASCAR Award Show in Las Vegas.

Despite reports that &quot;Malibu Country&quot; was the most-watched freshman comedy in its debut season (8.7 million), the show was canceled on May 10, 2013, after eighteen episodes.

In 2016, McEntire was a guest panelist during season 11 of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. During one of the Judge Cuts, McEntire gave the Golden Buzzer to contortionist Sofie Dossi.

In January 2017, it was announced that McEntire would star and produce a Southern drama series for ABC titled &quot;Red Blooded&quot;. It was reported in May that ABC ultimately turned down the show, so it moved to being shopped around to other networks. In January 2018, Reba was chosen to portray KFC&#x27;s first female Colonel Sanders. The commercials ran through the end of April 2018.

In 2020, McEntire launched a podcast titled &quot;Living &amp; Learning&quot; hosted by herself and her former &quot;Reba&quot; co-star Melissa Peterman.

She made a cameo appearance in the 2021 comedy film &quot;Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar&quot; as a water spirit named &quot;Trish&quot; after Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig, who wrote, produced, and starred in the film, wrote her an &quot;impassioned letter&quot; asking her to join the film. Director Josh Greenbaum said in an interview, &quot;There&#x27;s some casting that just clicks. Reba is not only 100% authentic, we knew she would be game.&quot;

In May 2022, ABC announced that McEntire will be joining the cast of the drama &quot;Big Sky&quot;, playing local businesswoman Sunny Barnes in season 3.

McEntire starred in &quot;Reba McEntire&#x27;s The Hammer&quot; on Lifetime in 2023. The country star will reunite with her &quot;Reba&quot; sitcom co-star Melissa Peterman in the film inspired by the life of traveling Nevada circuit judge Kim Wheeler. The film also stars McEntire&#x27;s boyfriend Rex Linn as Bart Crawford, a mysterious cowboy with unknown motives, and Kay Shioma Metchie as Vicky, the tough talking bailiff who serves as Kim&#x27;s right hand and trusted friend.

In May 2023, it was announced that McEntire would be a coach on &quot;The Voice&quot;, replacing Blake Shelton. She served as a coach from its 24th season to its 26th season. On May 21, 2024, Asher HaVon, a member of Reba&#x27;s team, won the 25th season, making McEntire the winning coach on her second season.

On September 20, 2023, McEntire reunited with Sofie Dossi where they collaborated during a result show on season 18 of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; where McEntire sang &quot;Can&#x27;t Even Get the Blues&quot; while Dossi did her contortion, hand-balancing, and aerial performances.

In January 2024, it was announced that McEntire was creating a new comedy for NBC, later announced to be titled &quot;Happy&#x27;s Place&quot; and co-starring Melissa Peterman who also co-starred in &quot;Reba&quot; with McEntire.

==Musical styles and legacy==
McEntire&#x27;s sound has been influenced by the country music of Bob Wills, Merle Haggard, Dolly Parton, Barbara Mandrell, and Patsy Cline. In college, McEntire attended local dances at the Oklahoma–Texas border so she could dance to Wills&#x27;s music, commenting that, &quot;it didn&#x27;t get any better than dancing to Bob Wills music&quot;. She also explained Merle Haggard&#x27;s influence on her career, stating &quot;I had every album he ever put out&quot;, and would sing &quot;every song he did&quot;, along with her brother, Pake and sister, Susie. In addition, her first major hit, &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; was a remake of Patsy Cline&#x27;s version of the song, according to McEntire herself.

McEntire&#x27;s music has been described not only to be built upon traditional country music, but also expand into the genres of country pop, mainstream pop, soul, and R&amp;B. At times, her music has been criticized for moving away from traditional country music. Many music critics have called her music to be &quot;melodramatic&quot;, &quot;formulaic&quot;, and &quot;bombastic&quot;, particularly after her 1988 album &quot;Reba.&quot; Studio releases such as &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot;, &quot;Rumor Has It&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Your Call&quot;, and &quot;Starting Over&quot; have been described by these terms.

McEntire possesses a contralto vocal range and performs &quot;vocal gymnastics&quot; with her voice, a musical technique in which a singer twirls a note around, using their vibrato. McEntire has credited Dolly Parton for influencing this trait, stating that she always listened to Parton&#x27;s records and find her style of vocal gymnastics &quot;so pretty&quot;.

McEntire has often been regarded as one of country music&#x27;s most influential female vocalists and most beloved entertainers. She is highly credited for remaining one of country&#x27;s most popular female artists for nearly four decades, maintaining her success by continually incorporating contemporary musical sounds without changing her traditional vocal style. For numerous artists, she has been credited as an inspiration to their careers in music. &quot;The Net Music Countdown&quot; second-handedly reported, &quot;That influence has manifested itself in many ways. As a role model, she&#x27;s shown others how to handle fame with grace and good humor while never backing down from her values or goals. Just as importantly, she&#x27;s shown others to refuse to accept limitations on what she can do or how much she can achieve.&quot; McEntire also explained to the online website, &quot;Whatever I&#x27;m doing, I feel like I&#x27;m representing country music&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s always been my main career, and it&#x27;s where my loyalties lie. I feel like I&#x27;m waving the flag of country music wherever I go, and I couldn&#x27;t be prouder to do it.&quot;

==Personal life==
McEntire is a Christian, and she has stated that her faith in God has helped her immensely throughout her life.

Two of her siblings have also had careers in the music industry. Her brother Pake dabbled in the country music industry in the late 1980s but returned to Oklahoma after a brief stint. He owns and operates a ranch near Coalgate, Oklahoma, and continues to rodeo. Her sister Susie McEntire-Eaton (Martha Susan &quot;Susie&quot; McEntire-Eaton, formerly Luchsinger) is a successful Christian music singer who travels the country with her husband, speaking and performing. She also has an older sister, Alice Foran, a retired social worker who resides in Lane, Oklahoma. Her niece Calamity McEntire is the Associate Head Coach for the University of Illinois women&#x27;s basketball team.
=== Relationships and family ===
In 1976, McEntire married steer wrestling champion and rancher Charlie Battles, who was 10 years her senior and had two sons from his previous marriage. The couple shared a ranch in Oklahoma. In 1987, McEntire divorced Battles and moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to further pursue her career.

In 1989, McEntire married her manager and former steel guitar player Narvel Blackstock. The couple wed at Lake Tahoe on a boat in a private ceremony. Together, the pair took over all aspects of McEntire&#x27;s career, forming Starstruck Entertainment, which was originally designed to help manage her career. From her marriage to Blackstock, McEntire gained three stepchildren, Chassidy, Shawna, and Brandon. She gave birth to a son, Shelby Steven McEntire Blackstock, in February 1990. On August 3, 2015, it was announced in a joint statement on McEntire&#x27;s website that she and Blackstock had been separated for a few months after 26 years of marriage. McEntire announced in December 2015 that their divorce had been finalized on October 28, 2015. Despite the divorce, McEntire remains very close to her three stepchildren and the Blackstock family; she considers her stepchildren&#x27;s children to be her grandchildren.

McEntire&#x27;s stepson Brandon Blackstock married singer Kelly Clarkson, with whom he has a daughter and a son. Speaking about their impending marriage in 2013, McEntire stated she was &quot;Thrilled to death, to have my buddy as my daughter-in-law. I mean, who could ask for more?&quot; Blackstock and Clarkson&#x27;s divorce was finalized in March 2022. 

In 2017, McEntire began a relationship with photographer Anthony &quot;Skeeter&quot; Lasuzzo. The couple met through McEntire&#x27;s association with Kix Brooks. In describing her feelings about Lasuzzo, she stated in April 2019, &quot;We&#x27;re totally in love — absolutely,&quot; she says. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t put up with somebody for two years if I wasn&#x27;t in love with &#x27;em!&quot; McEntire and Lasuzzo separated six months later.

In 2020, McEntire began dating film and TV actor Rex Linn. They first met on the set of &quot;The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw&quot; (1991) and reconnected almost thirty years later when McEntire guest-starred as June on &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;, where Linn has a recurring role as principal of Sheldon&#x27;s high school.

=== Philanthropy ===
In 1992, she opened Reba&#x27;s Ranch House in Denison, Texas, an extended-stay residence for relatives of patients undergoing treatment at Texoma Medical Center or other nearby facilities.

Over the course of her career, she has been and continues to be an active supporter of various charitable organizations including Habitat for Humanity, The Salvation Army, the American Red Cross, Feeding America and Celebrity Fight Night. She has been honored with the Minnie Pearl Award, the ACM Home Depot Humanitarian Award and the Andrea Bocelli Foundation Humanitarian Award for her efforts. In 2018, she was honored with the Horatio Alger Award for Education, Charity Work. Named after the &quot;rags to riches&quot; writer, the award recognizes perseverance and giving back.

==Accolades==

McEntire has the second-most wins for the Academy of Country Music&#x27;s Top Female Vocalist Awards with seven. McEntire holds the record American Music Awards for Favorite Country Female Artist (twelve). She also holds the distinction of being the first to win the Country Music Association&#x27;s Female Vocalist of the Year Award four times consecutively. Martina McBride won Female Vocalist four times, although not consecutively. In 2013, Miranda Lambert tied McEntire to win Female Vocalist four years in a row and in 2016 Carrie Underwood joined this elite club by winning her fourth Female Vocalist award. McEntire is also a rare musical artist to achieve solo number-ones across four decades (1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s). She holds the record for 2nd most CMA Award nominations for a female artist, with 51. McEntire also holds the record with the most ACM Awards nominations for a female artist with 47, respectively. She is also the recipient of three Grammy Awards, winning in 1987, 1994 and 2018. In December 2018, McEntire received the Kennedy Center Honor.

When Reba McEntire made her Grand Ole Opry debut on September 17, 1977, she almost did not make it in the door after a guard at the Opry gate missed her name on the night&#x27;s list of performers. Her parents and older sister, Alice, drove 1,400 miles round trip from their Oklahoma home to see what turned out to be Reba&#x27;s three-minute performance that night. Her act was cut from two songs to just one—&quot;Invitation to the Blues&quot;—because of a surprise appearance by Dolly Parton. McEntire was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry on January 17, 1986. &quot;The Grand Ole Opry is a home,&quot; she says. &quot;It&#x27;s a family. It&#x27;s like a family reunion, when you come back and get to see everybody.&quot;

In 2011, the Country Music Association announced that McEntire would be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. McEntire was unable to attend the announcement after her father had slipped into a coma following a stroke. McEntire attended the official induction ceremony alongside the other 2011 inductees Jean Shepard and Bobby Braddock. She was inducted by Dolly Parton.
