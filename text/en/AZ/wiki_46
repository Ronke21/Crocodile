<text>Michael A. Fumento (born 1960) is an American author, analyst, attorney, and investigative journalist who currently resides in the Philippines.

==Life and career==
Fumento grew up in Champaign, Illinois. He is the son of Tobey and Rocco Fumento, the latter being a professor emeritus in English, film, and creative writing who has worked at the University of Illinois.

Fumento&#x27;s father is Italian American and Catholic, and Fumento&#x27;s mother is Jewish. Fumento is Catholic.

A graduate of the University of Illinois College of Law and a member of the Pennsylvania Bar Association, he has a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from Fayetteville State University, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, which he earned while he served as a paratrooper in the US Army. He embedded three times in Iraq and once in Afghanistan and observed combat operations of the Navy SEALs and the 101st Airborne Division.

His work comprises over 70 subject areas. Google Scholar has almost 1,200 citations of his work. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; stated that he has &quot;knack for debunking popular beliefs and revealing the true state of things,&quot; and &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; stated, &quot;His arguments, statistics and perceptions appear almost as irrefutable as they are controversial.&quot; 

&quot;Nature&quot; stated that in some of Fumento&#x27;s work, &quot;some important scientific issues are dismissed or glossed over&quot; and that &quot;there is a fine line between persuasion and persecution.&quot; 

After he was fired from Scripps Howard News Service in 2006, he was described by &quot;Science&quot; as &quot;a vigorous defender of the pharmaceutical and biotech industries over the years&quot;.

He is best known for science and health issues, especially what he considers faux crises, including the 1987 &quot;heterosexual AIDS explosion,&quot; swine flu and the alleged epidemic of runaway Toyotas.

===Journalism===
Fumento has been a nationally syndicated columnist for the Scripps Howard News Service (before his firing in 2006), a legal writer for &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, a science correspondent for &quot;Reason&quot; magazine, an editorial writer for the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; in Denver, and the first national issues reporter for &quot;Investor&#x27;s Business Daily&quot;. When he was embedded four times in Iraq and Afghanistan, his research and reporting from Ramadi was praised by General David Petraeus: &quot;Great stuff with a great unit in a very tough neighborhood!&quot; Some of his combat video footage has aired on the History Channel.

A finalist for the National Magazine Award, he has had articles appear in such magazines as &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, Forbes.com, &quot;USA Weekend&quot;, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The Washington Monthly&quot;, &quot;Reason&quot;, &quot;Policy Review&quot;, &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, &quot;Nature Medicine&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot; (London), a3Umwelt (Austria), and &quot;The Bulletin&quot; (Australia). He has appeared in newspapers including the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;, &quot;Sunday Times&quot; of London, &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; of London, and the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;.

His television appearances include Nightline; ABC World News; ABC News 20/20, numerous programs on CBS, NBC, CNN, and Fox; PBS; MacNeil-Lehrer; CNBC; the BBC; the Canadian Broadcasting Network; C-SPAN; the Christian Broadcasting Network; Donahue; This Week with David Brinkley, the History Channel, ESPN, and many others. Fumento has lectured throughout the world.

Fumento has been outspoken in his support of adult stem cell research and critical of embryonic stem cell research and has criticized what he regards as a liberal and corporate bias in favor of the latter.

For &quot;Science Under Siege&quot;, he received two awards, including the American Council on Science and Health&#x27;s Distinguished Science Journalist of 1993.

===&quot;Debunking&quot; crises===

Fumento argues that many reports of threats to society are based on bad science and misused statistics. In addition to AIDS, Fumento&#x27;s writing on science has covered such topics as global warming, ADHD, obesity, the health dangers of breast implants, teen drug use, and agrarian utopianism. He has been highly critical of what he considers extreme alarmism over such diseases as SARS and the potential of a human avian flu pandemic.

A common theme is his claim that many liberal environmental groups have a hysterical response to most artificial chemicals. He writes that naturally-occurring food chemicals are often as toxic as artificial compounds and that there is no scientific reason to view natural compounds as inherently safer. Environmental groups, he holds, willingly accept claims that manmade compounds cause cancer but gloss over the fact that the toxicity tests often involve quantities that are millions of times larger than what a human would ever ingest.

Several articles deal with the agricultural chemical Alar, banned as a carcinogen in the United States. Fumento noted that the dosages in one Alar study were the equivalent of almost 30 thousand apples a day for life. In his view, it is impossible to test megadoses of chemicals on mice or rats and to extrapolate the results to conclusions about small doses on humans. The statistical nature of these studies, often analyzed by non-statisticians, leaves them vulnerable to extrapolation error. Researchers remain divided on the utility of such tests and on the safety of Alar, in particular.

He has been a frequent critic of activist Erin Brockovich since her eponymous movie first appeared in 2000.

Fumento describes himself as a political conservative. He has drawn criticism from liberal and veterans&#x27; activist groups for his views on Gulf War Syndrome (his &quot;Reason&quot; article &quot;Gulf Lore Syndrome&quot; was a National Magazine Award finalist in 1998) and for his writings since 1987, which state that the threat of AIDS to the heterosexual population was greatly overstated. He promotes a position of &quot;skepticism&quot; toward claims that manmade chemicals cause cancer in humans.

===Heterosexual AIDS===

Fumento has argued that the perception of infectious disease outbreaks becomes exaggerated or distorted by those who exploit them to serve various agendas. In November 1987, he published an article, &quot;AIDS: Are Heterosexuals at Risk?&quot; in &quot;Commentary&quot; that in 1990 became the basis of a controversial book, &quot;The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS: How a Tragedy Has Been Distorted by the Media and Partisan Politics&quot;. He wrote dozens of subsequent pieces on the subject. In &quot;Commentary&quot;, he challenged the presumption of &quot;Life&quot; magazine, whose July 1985 cover declared in bold red letters, &quot;Now No One Is Safe from AIDS.&quot;

By 1987, the theme had become common. A January &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; cover story declared, &quot;The disease of them is suddenly the disease of us... finding fertile growth among heterosexuals.&quot; A &quot;New York Times&quot; headline that month read: &quot;AIDS May Dwarf the Plague,&quot; citing remarks of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Otis R. Bowen, that AIDS could be worse than the &quot;Black Death,&quot; which is estimated to have killed 30 percent to 60 percent of Europe&#x27;s population. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop made remarks giving rise to the term &quot;heterosexual AIDS explosion.&quot; Oprah Winfrey told her audience, &quot;Research studies now project that one in five—listen to me, hard to believe—one in five heterosexuals could be dead from AIDS at the end of the next three years.&quot;

Fumento challenged that orthodoxy for which he and even those who wrote about him were condemned and even threatened. He did so by interviewing and citing the work of epidemiologists, including the top Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) AIDS epidemiologist, Dr. Harold Jaffe, who told him, &quot;Those who are suggesting that we are going to see an explosive spread of AIDS in the heterosexual population have to explain why this isn&#x27;t happening.&quot;

Although he would be accused of claiming heterosexuals have no AIDS risk, the back cover of his AIDS book stated, &quot;The &#x27;myth&#x27; of heterosexual AIDS consists of a series of myths, one of which is not that heterosexuals get AIDS. They certainly do get it... &quot; Rather, he argued that while white middle-class heterosexuals were the target of AIDS propaganda, &quot;the profile of the typical victim of heterosexually transmitted AIDS is a lower-class black woman who is the regular sex partner of an IV drug user.&quot;

As of 2007, the CDC&#x27;s &quot;estimated numbers of cases and rates (per 100,000 population) of HIV/AIDS,&quot; was 60.6 for black women but only 3.3 for white women.
In a theme discussed in &quot;Commentary&quot; and in his book, Fumento described various agendas served by promoting &quot;AIDS hysteria:&quot; &quot;On the opposite side of the spectrum Christian fundamentalists deploy it in order to underline their vision of morality,&quot; he wrote in &quot;Commentary&quot;. He also discussed it in a 1988 &quot;New Republic&quot; cover story.

===Monsanto controversy===
On January 13, 2006, Scripps Howard announced it would terminate its business relationship with Fumento and cease carrying his column. At issue were opinion columns Fumento had written concerning the biotechnology firm Monsanto Company while he was a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank. The connection between Fumento and Monsanto was first revealed by investigative reporter Eamon Javers in &quot;Business Week.&quot; General manager Peter Copeland explained that Fumento &quot;did not tell SHNS editors, and therefore we did not tell our readers, that in 1999 Hudson received a $60,000 grant from Monsanto... Our policy is that he should have disclosed that information. We apologize to our readers.&quot;

Fumento acknowledged that he benefited from Monsanto&#x27;s grant to Hudson, which was meant for his book on agribusiness, &quot;BioEvolution&quot;. He wrote on the Townhall website: &quot;It was a $60,000 book grant to my employer, solicited back in 1999, which was applied to pre-established salary and benefits.&quot; He told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that he didn&#x27;t disclose the Monsanto grant in his book because &quot;Monsanto asked me not to&quot;, that he had no obligation to inform Scripps Howard or its readers about the past payment, and that he had feared that disclosure would lead his critics to call him a &quot;corporate whore&quot;. He wrote that of approximately 100 columns he had written, three mentioned Monsanto. 

=== Swine flu ===
During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, Fumento opined in a February 2010 Forbes article that the World Health Organization (WHO) had faked the pandemic and that &quot;The agency needed to bounce back after the avian flu embarrassment.&quot; In an August 2010 &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; article, Fumento said in response to the WHO declaring the swine flu pandemic over that &quot;the WHO had no business labeling it a &quot;pandemic.&quot; It did so purely for its own interests, wreaking worldwide havoc.&quot;

=== Break with &quot;extreme right&quot; ===
In a May 2012 essay, Fumento said that he considered himself part of the &quot;Old Right&quot; but that he rejected the &quot;extreme right,&quot; which, he wrote, had taken over the Republican Party and dominated conservative media. He wrote, &quot;I&#x27;m horrified that these people have co-opted the name &#x27;conservative&#x27; to scream their messages of hate and anger.&quot;

===COVID-19===
In a January 23, 2020, &quot;New York Post&quot; opinion article, &quot;Don’t buy the media hype over the new China virus,&quot; he called concerns about COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic &quot;tinfoil-hat paranoia&quot; and wrote that &quot;there appears to be nothing very special about this outbreak&quot;. In a March 8, 2020, followup opinion article, he decried the &quot;pure hysteria&quot; about the virus,&quot; noting that there had been only 19 deaths in the US at the time, and maintained that &quot;the spread of the virus continues to slow.&quot;

<text>King Ratsadanay (1874–1945) was the last king of Champasak. He was the father of Boun Oum.

Upon the death of his father, he was appointed as Chao Muang Nakhon Champassak (Prince Governor of the State of Champasakti) by the King of Siam on 28 July 1900 and invested with the personal title of Somdet Brhat Chao Buvanarabarna Rajadhanaya Negara Champasakti. He was forced to accept French protection when Siam transferred sovereignty to the French Republic on 19 September 1904, under the terms of the Franco-Siamese Treaty of 13 February 1904. The principality was abolished by the French on 22 November 1904, although he retained his styles, titles and honours for life.

He was appointed Governor of the Province of Bassac under the French colonial authorities on 14 October 1905, with the capital of the new province being established at Pakse in 1908. He served in that capacity until forced into retirement upon reaching the age of sixty on 21 December 1934. He was subsequently recognised on 11 March 1941 as Hereditary Prince of Champasakti, which comprised all of the former territories of the old kingdom following the Thai conquest on 22 January 1941. France was forced to retrocede the province to Thailand following Japanese mediation on 9 May 1941, but the French were invited by Prince Boum Oum to reoccupy Pakse on 14 September 1945.

He had eleven sons and seventeen daughters. He died from cancer, at Bassac, in November 1945.

<doc id="204745" wikidata="Q3177150" url="?curid=204745" title="Michael Novak">
<text>Michael John Novak Jr. (September 9, 1933 – February 17, 2017) was an American Catholic philosopher, journalist, novelist, and diplomat. The author of more than forty books on the philosophy and theology of culture, Novak is most widely known for his book &quot;The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism&quot; (1982). In 1993 Novak was honored with an honorary doctorate at Universidad Francisco Marroquín due to his commitment to the idea of liberty. In 1994 he was awarded the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, which included a million-dollar purse awarded at Buckingham Palace. He wrote books and articles focused on capitalism, religion, and the politics of democratization.

Novak served as United States Ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1981 and 1982 and led the US delegation to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in 1986. Additionally, Novak served on the board of directors of the now-defunct Coalition for a Democratic Majority, a conservative anti-Communist faction of the Democratic Party, which sought to influence the party&#x27;s policies in the same direction that the Committee on the Present Danger later did. Novak was George Frederick Jewett Scholar in Religion, Philosophy, and Public Policy at the American Enterprise Institute. In 2004, he claimed to be a lifelong Democrat, while noting that he has supported many Republican candidates.

==Early life, education, and family==
Novak was born on September 9, 1933, in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, to a Slovak-American family, the son of Irene (Sakmar) and Michael J. Novak. He was married to Karen Laub-Novak, a professional artist and illustrator, who died of cancer in August 2009. They have three children (Richard, Tanya, and Jana) and four grandchildren.

Novak earned a Bachelor of Arts degree &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in philosophy and English from Stonehill College in 1956, a Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome in 1958, and a Master of Arts degree in history and philosophy of religion from Harvard University in 1966. Novak attended Harvard University to study philosophy and religion, intending to obtain a doctorate in philosophy of religion. Novak stated that he thought the philosophy department was too focused on analytic philosophy, neglecting religion. He left Harvard after receiving his master&#x27;s degree and began work as a writer.

==Early writings==

=== Second Vatican Council ===

Novak worked as a correspondent for the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot; during the second session of the Second Vatican Council in Rome, where he also got the opportunity to fulfill a book contract for a fellow reporter who was not able to complete the project. The result was Novak&#x27;s second book, &quot;The Open Church&quot;, a journalistic account of the events of the second session of the council.

His writings at the time were criticized by the more conservative factions in the church, and apostolic delegate Egidio Vagnozzi advised US churchmen to silence him.

Early in his career, Novak published two novels: &quot;The Tiber Was Silver&quot; (1961) and &quot;Naked I Leave&quot; (1970). At the time, he considered the modest $600 advance to be &quot;a fortune.&quot;

===&quot;Rise of the Unmeltable Ethnics&quot;===
Novak proposed that the white ethnic was a distinct race of whites from WASPs who had attempted to erase their cultural heritage and assimilate them. He supported the notion of separate but equal while rejecting multiculturalism and melting pot theory. He argues that white ethnics will reject assimilation and live separately from other races. He argues that African Americans and white ethnics should unite due to their common class struggle while also denouncing &quot;socialist&quot; integration policies that &quot;unfairly&quot; supported women and African Americans to the detriment of taxpaying &quot;white ethnics&quot;.

==Stanford years==
Novak&#x27;s friendship with the Presbyterian theologian Robert McAfee Brown during the Second Vatican Council led to a teaching post at Stanford University, where he became the first Roman Catholic to teach in the humanities program. Novak taught at Stanford University from 1965 to 1968, during the key years of student revolt throughout California. During this period, he wrote &quot;A Time to Build&quot; (1967), discussing problems of belief and unbelief, ecumenism, sexuality, and war. In 1968, he signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. In &quot;A Theology for Radical Politics&quot; (1969), Novak makes theological arguments in support of the New Left student movement, which he urged to advance the renewal of the human spirit rather than merely to reform social institutions. His book &quot;Politics: Realism and Imagination&quot; includes accounts of visiting American Vietnam War deserters in France (&quot;Desertion&quot;), the birth and development of the student movement at Stanford (&quot;Green Shoots of Counter-Culture&quot;) and philosophical essays on nihilism and Marxism.

==SUNY Old Westbury==
Novak left Stanford for a post as dean of a new &quot;experimental&quot; school at the newly founded State University of New York at Old Westbury, Long Island.

Novak&#x27;s writings during this period included the philosophical essay &quot;The Experience of Nothingness&quot; (1970, republished in 1998), in which he cautioned the New Left that utopianism could lead to alienation and rootlessness. Novak&#x27;s novel &quot;Naked I Leave&quot; (1970) chronicles his experiences in California and in the Second Vatican Council and his journey from seminarian to reporter.

==Later career==
After serving at Old Westbury/SUNY from 1969 to 1972, Novak launched the humanities program at the Rockefeller Foundation in 1973–1974. In 1976, he accepted a tenured position at Syracuse University as University Professor and Ledden-Watson Distinguished Professor of Religion. In the fall semesters of 1987 and 1988, Novak held the W. Harold and Martha Welch chair as Professor of American Studies at the University of Notre Dame.

In the spring of 1978, Novak joined the American Enterprise Institute for Social Policy Research as a Resident Scholar, a position he held for more than a decade. He would later stay with the American Enterprise Institute as the George Frederick Jewett Chair of Religion, Philosophy, and Public Policy, and as the Institute&#x27;s Director of Social and Political Studies.

Novak was a frequent contributor to magazines and journals including &quot;First Things&quot; and &quot;National Review&quot;. In 1994, he was a signer of the document Evangelicals and Catholics Together. On December 12, 2007, Novak declared his support for the presidential candidacy of Republican Mitt Romney.

In 2012, he authored an article entitled &#x27;The Moral Imperative of a Free Economy&#x27; in &quot;The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs&quot;, published by the George W. Bush Presidential Center.

Novak was a founding board member of the Institute on Religion and Democracy. He was also a founding member of the Board of Trustees of Ave Maria University and was a member of the Ave Maria Mutual Funds Catholic Advisory Board. A portrait of Novak by Igor Babailov hangs in the Canizaro Library on campus.

In 2016 he joined the Tim and Steph Busch School of Business and Economics of the Catholic University of America as a distinguished visiting professor.

Novak died of complications from colon cancer February 17, 2017, in Washington, D.C., at the age of 83.

<doc id="204746" wikidata="Q1148532" url="?curid=204746" title="Grumman C-2 Greyhound">
<text>The Grumman C-2 Greyhound is a twin-engine, high-wing cargo aircraft designed to carry supplies, mail, and passengers to and from aircraft carriers of the United States Navy. Its primary mission is carrier onboard delivery (COD). The aircraft provides critical logistics support to carrier strike groups. The aircraft is mainly used to transport high-priority cargo such as jet engines and special stores, mail, and passengers between carriers and shore bases.

Prototype C-2s first flew in 1964, and production followed the next year. The initial Greyhound aircraft were overhauled in 1973. In 1984, more C-2As were ordered under designation Reprocured C-2A or C-2A(R). In 2010, all C-2A(R) aircraft received updated propellers (from four to eight blades) and navigational updates (glass cockpit). The U.S. Navy is to start replacing the remaining 27 C-2As with 38 Bell Boeing CMV-22Bs Osprey tiltrotors in 2020, with full fielding in 2028.

==Design and development==
===Origins===

The C-2 Greyhound, a derivative of the Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye, shares the folding &quot;Sto-Wings&quot; and engines with the E-2, but has a widened fuselage with a rear loading ramp. The first of two prototypes flew in 1964. After successful testing, Grumman began production of the aircraft in 1965. The C-2 replaced the piston-engine Grumman C-1 Trader in the carrier onboard delivery (COD) role. The original C-2A aircraft were overhauled to extend their operational life in 1973.

Powered by two Allison T56 turboprop engines, the C-2A can deliver up to 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) of cargo or up to 28 passengers, and is normally configured for a cargo/passenger mix. It can also carry litter patients in medical-evacuation missions. A cage system or transport stand restrains cargo during carrier launch and landing accelerations to prevent weight redistribution, which might adversely affect in-flight stability. The large aft cargo ramp and door and a powered winch allow straight-in rear cargo loading and unloading for fast turnaround. The Greyhound&#x27;s ability to airdrop supplies and personnel, fold its wings, and generate power for engine starting and other uses provide greater operational versatility. Some parts are shared with the E-2 Hawkeye and the Grumman A-6 Intruder to ease logistics support.

The C-2 has four vertical stabilizers, of which three are fitted with rudders. A single vertical stabilizer large enough for adequate directional control would have made the aircraft too tall to fit on an aircraft carrier hangar deck. The four-stabilizer configuration has the advantage of placing the outboard rudder surfaces directly in line with the propeller wash, providing effective yaw control down to low airspeeds, such as during takeoff and landing. The inner-left stabilizer lacks a rudder, and has been called the &quot;executive tail&quot;, as it has nothing to do compared to the other three. A single C-2 (2797) was equipped with an air-to-air refueling probe, but this was not installed in other aircraft.

In 1984, the Navy ordered 39 new C-2A aircraft to replace older airframes. Dubbed the Reprocured C-2A or C-2A(R) due to the similarity to the original, the new aircraft has airframe improvements and better avionics. The older C-2As were phased out in 1987, and the last of the new models was delivered in 1990.

===Upgrades===
The 36 C-2A(R)s underwent a critical service life extension program (SLEP). The C-2A(R)&#x27;s lifespan was 10,000 hours, or 15,000 carrier landings; plans require the C-2A to perform its mission supporting battle group operational readiness through 2015. The lower landing limit was approaching for most airframes, and the SLEP will increase their projected life to 15,000 hours or 36,000 landings. Once complete, the SLEP will allow the 36 aircraft to operate until 2027. The SLEP includes structural improvements to the center wing, an eight-bladed NP2000 propeller, navigational upgrades including the addition of GPS and the dual CAINS II navigation system, the addition of crash-survivable flight-incident recorders, and a ground proximity warning system. The first upgraded C-2A(R) left NAVAIR Depot North Island on 12 September 2005, after sitting on the ground for three and a half years while the SLEP was developed and installed. All aircraft were to receive the SLEP by 2015.
In November 2008, the company also obtained a $37M contract for the maintenance, logistics, and aviation administration services over five years for the C-2A fleet assigned to VX-20 test and evaluation squadron at Patuxent River. Northrop Grumman worked on an upgraded C-2 version, and offered to modernize the fleet with components common to the E-2D Hawkeye.

==Operational history==

Between November 1985 and February 1987, VR-24 (former Navy Transport Squadron) and its seven reprocured C-2As demonstrated the aircraft&#x27;s exceptional operational readiness. The squadron delivered of cargo, of mail, and 14,000 passengers in the European and Mediterranean theaters. The C-2A(R) also served the carrier battle groups during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm during the Gulf War, as well as Operation Enduring Freedom during the war in Afghanistan.

On 2 June 2011, the US Navy loaned two C-2A(R) Greyhounds from VRC-40 to the French Navy. The two aircraft were stationed at Toulon-Hyères Airport, Hyères, to assist in improving the flow of logistics and supplies to the operating in the Mediterranean Sea off Libya in support of the NATO intervention in Libya. After 16 days, both aircraft returned to the U.S. via Shannon Airport, Ireland, on 18 June 2011.

===Replacement===
The Common Support Aircraft was once considered as a replacement for the C-2, but failed to materialize. The U.S. Navy was exploring a replacement for the C-2 in September 2009. Three options were suggested as replacements for the aging C-2s: a new batch of updated C-2s, a transport version of the Lockheed S-3 Viking, and the tilt-rotor Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey.

The C-2 competed with the V-22 Osprey for use as the future COD aircraft. Northrop Grumman proposed modernizing the C-2 by installing the same wings, glass cockpit, and engines as the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye. Installing the Rolls-Royce T56-427A engines would cut fuel consumption by 13–15% with the same eight-bladed propeller, enabling take-offs with a payload in temperature and a range in excess of ; similar performance by the C-2A requires engine temperatures at , trading fuel for payload. Adopting the E-2D&#x27;s cockpit would deliver a 10% savings on lifetime logistical support. One of the Greyhound&#x27;s most important features is its internal volume of of cargo space. Northrop Grumman stated that their approach could cost far less than the V-22, including saving $120 million from C-2 and E-2D commonality.

In February 2015, the Navy&#x27;s FY 2016 budget confirmed the V-22&#x27;s selection for the COD mission, replacing the C-2A. The Navy is to order 44 of the Osprey, designated CMV-22B, with deliveries to start in 2020. The C-2 was originally planned to be retired in 2027, but this was accelerated to 2024. The fleet is expected to be fully transitioned to the Osprey by 2028.

==Accidents==
* On 29 April 1965, YC-2A BuNo 148147 was on a test flight when it was ditched into Long Island Sound, where the four crewmen died of exposure.
* On 2 July 1969, Lieutenant Commander Peter Monroe Kennedy was presented the Air Medal with bronze star, the first award for heroic achievement in aerial flights for a carrier onboard delivery aircraft. While returning to Naval Air Station Cubi Point from operating in Southeast Asia, a failure in the engine gearbox and propeller assembly resulted in the loss of the entire port propeller assembly and substantial portions of the gearbox and nacelle. The separated propeller penetrated the fuselage, causing decompression at over 20,000 feet. Kennedy and his copilot secured the engine, descended to a lower altitude, and returned to Cubi Point.

* On 2 October 1969, C-2A of VRC-50, carrying six crew members and 21 passengers, crashed in the Gulf of Tonkin en route from Cubi Point to . All aboard are officially listed as missing in action, as their bodies were never recovered.
* On 15 December 1970, a C-2A of VRC-50 crashed shortly after launch from , killing all four crew members and five passengers.
* On 12 December 1971, C-2A crashed en route from Cubi Point to Tan Son Nhat International Airport, killing all four crew members and six passengers.
* On 29 January 1972, C-2A crashed while attempting to land on the in the Mediterranean Sea, killing both crewmen.
* On 16 November 1973, C-2A crashed into the sea after takeoff from Chania International Airport, killing seven of 10 persons on board.
* On 22 November 2017, C-2A of VRC-30 carrying 11 crew and passengers crashed in the waters southeast of Japan&#x27;s Okinawa Island in the Philippine Sea while in flight to the aircraft carrier . Eight of the 11 were rescued. The aircraft was located on the ocean floor at a depth of during the last week of December 2017, when a salvage ship used a pinger receiver to locate the aircraft&#x27;s emergency signal. The Navy salvaged the aircraft and recovered the remains of the three sailors inside, in late May 2019.

<text>Thonburi () is an area of modern Bangkok. During the era of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya, its location on the right (west) bank at the mouth of the Chao Phraya River had made it an important garrison town, which is reflected in its name: &quot;thon&quot; () a loanword from Pali &quot;dhána&quot; &#x27;wealth&#x27;, and &quot;buri&quot; (), from &quot;púra,&quot; &#x27;fortress&#x27;. The full formal name was Thon Buri Si Mahasamut ( &#x27;City of Treasures Gracing the Ocean&#x27;). For the informal name, see the history of Bangkok under Ayutthaya.

In 1767, after the sack of Ayutthaya by the Burmese, General Taksin took back Thonburi and, by right of conquest, made it the capital of the Thonburi Kingdom, crowning himself king until 6 April 1782, when he was deposed. Rama I, the newly enthroned king, moved the capital across the river, where stakes driven into the soil of Bangkok for the City Pillar at 06:45 on 21 April 1782 marked the official founding of the new capital. Thonburi remained an independent town and province, until it was merged with Bangkok in 1971. Thonburi stayed less developed than the other side of the river. Many of the traditional small waterways, &quot;khlongs&quot;, still exist there, while they are nearly gone from the other side of the river.

In 1950, Bangkok had around 1.3 million inhabitants, and the municipality of Thonburi around 400,000. In 1970 Thonburi was Thailand&#x27;s second largest city proper with around 600,000 residents.

Wongwian Yai is a landmark of Thonburi District.

==Administration==

At the time of the merger, Thonburi province consisted of nine districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;).
#Thonburi District ()
#Bangkok Yai District ()
#Khlong San District ()
#Taling Chan District ()
#Bangkok Noi District ()
#Bang Khun Thian District ()
#Phasi Charoen District ()
#Nong Khaem District ()
#Rat Burana District ()

As of 2012, these have been reorganized into 15 districts.

<doc id="204753" wikidata="Q532428" url="?curid=204753" title="Grumman EA-6B Prowler">
<text>The Northrop Grumman (formerly Grumman) EA-6B Prowler is a twin-engine, four-seat, mid-wing electronic-warfare aircraft. Operated by both the United States Marine Corps and United States Navy between 1971 and 2019, it was derived from the A-6 Intruder airframe.

The aircraft&#x27;s immediate predecessor, the &quot;EA-6A&quot;, was an interim conversion of the A-6 airframe to perform electronic warfare missions during the 1960s. In 1966, work on the more advanced EA-6B commenced. It featured an enlarged four-seat cockpit, a fully integrated electronic warfare system, and advanced electronic countermeasures. Furthermore, it was suitable for long-range, all-weather carrier-based operations in addition to land-based uses. Typically, the aircrew of an EA-6B consisted of a single pilot and three Electronic Countermeasures Officers, though it was not uncommon for only two ECMOs to be used on missions. It was capable of firing anti-radiation missiles (ARMs), such as the AGM-88 HARM. Although designed as an electronic warfare and command-and-control aircraft for air strike missions, the EA-6B was also capable of attacking some surface targets on its own, in particular enemy radar sites and surface-to-air missile launchers. In addition, the EA-6B was capable of gathering electronic signals intelligence.

On 25 May 1968, the EA-6B performed its maiden flight; a total of three prototype were converted from A-6As while five EA-6Bs participated in the development programme. During July 1971, Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 132 (VAQ-132) became the first operational squadron to be equipped with the type; the EA-6B&#x27;s first combat deployment took place 11 months later in the latter half of the Vietnam War. It frequently carried out electronic warfare operations, such as the jamming of enemy radar systems, as well as the gathering of radio intelligence on enemy radar and air defense systems. The EA-6B would also play an active role during the 1983 invasion of Grenada, Operation El Dorado Canyon (1986 Libya), Operation Praying Mantis (Iran 1988), and Operation Desert Storm (Iraq 1991). It would also be called on during the Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan 2001–2014) and Operation Inherent Resolve (Iraq 2014) in addition to other lower intensity duties.

By the twenty-first century, efforts to eventually replace the EA-6B had been launched, such as the abortive Common Support Aircraft initiative. As a result of the type being heavily used during its lengthy service life, the EA-6B had become a relatively high-maintenance aircraft during its latter years of service. Nevertheless, it had undergone frequent equipment upgrades throughout its service life; major programmes included the Advanced Capability EA-6B and the Improved Capability (ICAP) II schemes. The type&#x27;s final overseas deployment occurred in late 2014; the EA-6B was withdrawn from U.S. Navy service in June 2015 while the U.S. Marine Corps retired its last aircraft in March 2019. It has been effectively succeeded by the EA-18G Growler, an electronic warfare derivative of the F/A-18F Super Hornet. 

==Development==
===Origins===
By the 1960s, the United States Marine Corps (USMC) was operating several aging Electronic countermeasure (ECM) platforms, including the EF-10B Skyknight and AD Skyraider. The service sought to procure more modern platforms; this desire led to the development of the EA-6A &quot;Electric Intruder&quot;. The EA-6A was a direct conversion of the standard Grumman A-6 Intruder airframe, equipped with a twin-seat cockpit along with assorted electronic warfare (EW) equipment. During December 1965, the EA-6A entered squadron service with the USMC; shortly thereafter, it saw action in Operation Rolling Thunder during the Vietnam War. A total of three USMC squadrons were equipped with the type in the conflict; a total of 27 EA-6As were produced, 15 of which were newly manufactured while the others were conversions. The majority of these EA-6As were retired from service in the 1970s; the final handful of aircraft were operated by two electronic attack &quot;aggressor&quot; squadrons of the United States Navy (USN). These last examples were finally retired during the 1990s. The EA-6A was essentially an interim warplane until the more-advanced EA-6B could be designed and built.
During 1966, development of the EA-6B, a substantially redesigned and more advanced model, commenced as a replacement for the EKA-3B Skywarriors then being operated by the United States Navy. The redesign included the lengthening of the forward fuselage to create a rear area that accommodated a larger four-seat cockpit while an antenna fairing was added to the tip of the vertical stabilizer. The EA-6B was powered by a pair of Pratt &amp; Whitney J52 turbojet engines, which enable it to attain high subsonic speeds. On 14 November 1966, Grumman was awarded a $12.7 million contract to develop an EA-6B prototype. On 25 May 1968, the EA-6B performed its maiden flight; it entered regular service on aircraft carriers during July 1971. Three prototype EA-6Bs were converted from A-6As, and five EA-6Bs were developmental airplanes. Between 1966 and 1991, a total of 170 EA-6B production aircraft were manufactured.

The EA-6B was continually upgraded over the years. The first such upgrade was named &quot;expanded capability&quot; (EXCAP) beginning in 1973. Then came &quot;improved capability&quot; (ICAP) in 1976 and ICAP II in 1980. The ICAP II upgrade provided the EA-6B with the capability of firing Shrike missiles and AGM-88 HARM missiles.

===Advanced Capability EA-6B===
The &quot;Advanced Capability EA-6B Prowler (ADVCAP)&quot; was a development program initiated to improve the flying qualities of the EA-6B and to upgrade the avionics and electronic warfare systems. The intention was to modify all EA-6Bs into the ADVCAP configuration, however the program was removed from the Fiscal Year 1995 budget due to financial pressure from competing Department of Defense acquisition programs.

The ADVCAP development program was initiated in the late 1980s and was broken into three distinct phases: Full-Scale Development (FSD), Vehicle Enhancement Program (VEP) and the Avionics Improvement Program (AIP).

FSD served primarily to evaluate the new AN/ALQ-149 Electronic Warfare System. The program utilized a slightly modified EA-6B to house the new system.

The VEP added numerous changes to the aircraft to address deficiencies with the original EA-6B flying qualities, particularly lateral-directional problems that hampered recovery from out-of-control flight. Bureau Number 158542 was used. Changes included:
* Leading edge strakes (to improve directional stability)
* Fin pod extension (to improve directional stability)
* Ailerons (to improve slow speed lateral control)
* Re-contoured leading edge slats and trailing edge flaps (to compensate for an increase in gross weight)
* Two additional wing stations on the outer wing panel (for jamming pods only)
* New J52-P-409 engines (increased thrust by 2,000 lbf (8.9 kN) per engine)
* New digital Standard Automatic Flight Control System (SAFCS)

The added modifications increased the aircraft gross weight approximately and shifted the center of gravity 3% MAC aft of the baseline EA-6B. In previous models, when operating at sustained high angles of attack, fuel migration would cause additional shifts in CG with the result that the aircraft had slightly negative longitudinal static stability. Results of flight tests of the new configuration showed greatly improved flying qualities and the rearward shift of the CG had minimal impact.
The AIP prototype (bureau number 158547) represented the final ADVCAP configuration, incorporating all of the FSD and VEP modifications plus a completely new avionics suite which added multi-function displays to all crew positions, a head-up display for the pilot, and dual Global Positioning/Inertial navigation systems. The initial joint test phase between the contractor and the US Navy test pilots completed successfully with few deficiencies.

After the program was canceled, the three experimental Prowlers, BuNo 156482, 158542 and 158547, were mothballed until 1999. Over the next several years, the three aircraft were dismantled and reassembled to create a single aircraft, b/n 158542, which the Navy dubbed &quot;FrankenProwler&quot;. It was returned to active service on 23 March 2005.

===Improved Capability (ICAP) III===
Northrop Grumman received contracts from the United States Navy to deliver new electronic countermeasures gear to Prowler squadrons; the heart of each ICAP III set consists of the ALQ-218 receiver and new software that provides more precise selective-reactive radar jamming and deception and threat location. The ICAP III sets also are equipped with the Multifunction Information Distribution System (MIDS), which includes the Link 16 data link system. Northrop delivered two lots and delivered two more beginning in 2010. The EA-6B Prowlers in service toward the end of its life were the ICAP III version, carrying the ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System.

==Design==

Designed for carrier-based and advanced base operations, the EA-6B was a fully integrated electronic warfare system combining long-range, all-weather capabilities with advanced electronic countermeasures. A forward equipment bay and pod-shaped fairing on the vertical fin housed the additional avionics equipment. It was the primary electronic warfare aircraft for the U.S Navy and U.S. Marine Corps. The EA-6B&#x27;s primary mission was to support ground-attack strikes by disrupting enemy electromagnetic activity. As a secondary mission it could also gather tactical electronic intelligence within a combat zone, and another secondary mission was attacking enemy radar sites with anti-radiation missiles.

The Prowler was operated by a crew of four, a pilot and three Electronic Countermeasures Officers (known as ECMOs). The two ECMOs in the rear cockpit operated the Prowler&#x27;s primary jamming equipment, while the ECMO in the front right seat handled navigation, communications, and defensive electronic countermeasures. Powered by two non-afterburning Pratt &amp; Whitney J52-P-408A turbojet engines, it was capable of speeds of over , with a range of over .

Design particulars included the refueling probe being asymmetrical, appearing bent to the right to improve pilot visibility over that of the A-6 Intruder. It contained an antenna near its root. The canopy had a shading of gold to protect the crew against the radio emissions that the electronic warfare equipment produces.

==Operational history==
===Twentieth century===
In September 1970, the EA-6B entered service with Fleet Replacement Squadron VAQ-129; ten months later, Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 132 (VAQ-132) became the first operational squadron to be equipped with the type. during June 1972, VAQ-132 began its first combat deployment to Vietnam on ; it was promptly followed by VAQ-131 on and VAQ-134 on . Two squadrons of Prowlers flew 720 sorties during the Vietnam War in support of US Navy attack aircraft as well as the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bombers of the United States Air Force; typically, they would suppress enemy air defenses just prior to the attack/bomber aircraft deploying their own payloads.

During the 1983 invasion of Grenada, four Prowlers supported the operation from . Two years later, in response to the Achille Lauro hijacking, Prowlers from provided ESM support during the interception of the EgyptAir 737 carrying four of the hijackers on 10 October 1985.

Prowlers jammed Libyan radar and air defenses during Operation El Dorado Canyon in April 1986. Similarly, Prowlers from VAQ-135 on jammed Iranian Ground Control Intercept radars, surface-to-air missile guidance radars and communication systems during Operation Praying Mantis on 18 April 1988.

During 1991, a total of 39 EA-6Bs were involved in Operation Desert Storm; 27 were based on six aircraft carriers while 12 from USMC shore bases. During 4,600 flight hours, Prowlers fired over 150 AGM-88 HARM missiles, the majority of which were targeted at radars and communications nodes across Iraqi&#x27;s integrated air defense system. In total, U.S. Navy Prowlers flew 1,132 sorties while USMC EA-6Bs flew 516 sorties; no losses were incurred.

Following the retirement of the EF-111 Raven in 1998, the EA-6B was the only dedicated aerial radar jammer aircraft of the United States Armed Forces, until the fielding of the Navy&#x27;s EA-18G Growler in 2009. The EA-6B was flown in almost all American combat operations from 1972 until its retirement in 2019, and was frequently flown in support of missions undertaken by the United States Air Force.

===Twenty-first century===

In 2001, 124 Prowlers remained, divided between twelve Navy, four Marine, and four joint Navy-Air Force &quot;Expeditionary&quot; squadrons. A Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) staff study recommended that the EF-111 Raven be retired to reduce the types of aircraft dedicated to the same mission, which led to an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) program memorandum to establish 4 land based &quot;expeditionary&quot; Prowler squadrons to meet the needs of the Air Force. Between 2004 and 2014, the U.S. Air Force augmented Navy Prowler units with Electronic Warfare Officers from the 388th and 390th Electronic Combat Squadrons assigned to the 366th Operations Group at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho.

In 2007, it was reported that the Prowler had been used in counter improvised explosive device operations in the conflict in Afghanistan for several years by jamming remote detonation devices such as garage door openers or cellular telephones. Two Prowler squadrons were also based in Iraq, working with the same mission. According to Chuck Pfarrer in his book &quot;SEAL Target Geronimo&quot;, an EA-6B was also used to jam Pakistani radar and assist the 2 MH-60 Black Hawk stealth helicopters and 2 Chinook helicopters raiding Osama Bin Laden&#x27;s compound in Operation Neptune Spear.
During June 2014, VMAQ-3 began flying Prowler missions against Islamic State militants over Iraq. Two months later, Operation Inherent Resolve began and VMAQ-4 took over. The Prowlers were the first Marine Corps aircraft in Syria, where they were involved in strike packages, air drops, and electronic warfare requirements against militants. By January 2015, the five aircraft of VMAQ-4 had flown 800 hours during 110 sorties in support of operations in both countries, including supporting coalition airstrikes and providing EW support for Iraqi Army forces to degrade enemy systems. Marine Prowlers had not dropped munitions themselves and host nations basing them have not been revealed.

Though once considered being replaced by Common Support Aircraft, that plan failed to materialize. In 2009, the Navy EA-6B Prowler community began transitioning to the EA-18G Growler, a electronic warfare derivative of the F/A-18F Super Hornet. All but one of the active duty Navy EA-6B squadrons were based at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island. VAQ-136 was stationed at Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Japan, as part of Carrier Air Wing 5, the forward deployed naval forces (FDNF) air wing that embarks aboard the Japan-based . VAQ-209, the Navy Reserve&#x27;s sole EA-6B squadron, was stationed at Naval Air Facility Washington, Maryland. All Marine Corps EA-6B squadrons were located at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina.

During 2013, the USN planned to fly the EA-6B until 2015 while the USMC expected to phase out the Prowler in March 2019. The last Navy deployment was on in November 2014, with VAQ-134. The USN&#x27;s last operational flight took place on 27 May 2015. NAS Whidbey held a retirement commemoration for the EA-6B from 25 to 27 June 2015 of the EA-6B culminating on the last day with the Navy&#x27;s last operational EA-6B Prowler, bureau number 163890, taking off from NAS Whidbey Island.

In April 2016, a squadron of EA-6B Prowlers from Marine Corps Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 4 (VMAQ-4), based at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, was deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey for operations over Syria. U.S. European Command confirmed that the deployment was expected to last through September 2016. The Center for Strategic and International Studies suggested that the Prowlers may be used to prevent Russian and Syrian air defense systems from tracking U.S. and coalition aircraft.

During November 2018, Prowlers of VMAQ-2 completed their last operational deployment to Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar. The squadron, being the last equipped with the EA-6B, was disbanded on 8 March 2019, after which its remaining pair of Prowlers were reallocated to museums.

The Marine Corps&#x27; four members of VAMQ-2 flew the last EA-6B on its final flight on 14 March 2019 from their station at Cherry Point, North Carolina, to the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.

==Operators==
The EA-6B Prowler was operated by the U.S. Armed Forces with squadrons in the U.S. Marine Corps and Navy.

===USMC squadrons===
VMAQ squadrons operated the EA-6B Prowler. Each of the three squadrons operated five aircraft; the squadrons were land-based, although they were capable of operating aboard U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and did so in the past.

In 2013, VMAQ-1 converted from an active to a training squadron as the USN stopped training on the Prowler and switched over to the Growler. The Marine Training squadron first received students for training in October 2013 and produced its first training flights in April 2014.

In 2008, the USMC investigated an electronic attack role for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II to replace their Prowlers. The Marines began retiring the EA-6 in 2016 and replaced them with the Marine Air-Ground Task Force Electronic Warfare (MAGTF-EW) concept, which calls for a medium to high-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle to off-load at least some of the electronic warfare mission.

In November 2018, VMAQ-2 returned from performing the final deployed operations of USMC Prowlers. The Marines retired the aircraft on 8 March 2019, with some placed in storage and on static display at the Smithsonian Institution Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air and Space Museum in Chantilly, Virginia and the Frontiers of Flight Museum at Dallas Love Field.

===USN squadrons===
While in U.S. Navy service four EA-6B Prowlers were typically assigned to a Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron. These Navy Electronic Attack squadrons carried the letters VAQ (V-fixed wing, A-attack, Q-electronic); most of these squadrons were carrier-based, while others were &quot;expeditionary&quot; and deployed to overseas land bases.

====Disestablished Squadrons====
VAQ-128: Established as an expeditionary squadron in October 1997, utilizing the insignia and heritage of the former A-6 Intruder Fleet Replacement Squadron at NAS Whidbey Island. Disestablished in September 2004 due to budget reductions.

VAQ-309: Established as a Naval Air Reserve Force squadron at NAS Whidbey Island in 1979 with EA-6A aircraft, transitioning to the EA-6B in 1989 as part of Carrier Air Wing Reserve THIRTY (CVWR-30). Disestablished on 31 Dec 1994 following the decommissioning of CVWR-30 due to budget cuts; aircraft returned to the Regular Navy.

==Notable accidents==
While no Prowler was ever lost during combat operations, nearly fifty of the 170 aircraft built were destroyed in various accidents as of 2013. In 1998, a memorial at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island was dedicated to 44 crew members lost in EA-6B aircraft accidents.
* On 26 May 1981, a USMC EA-6B crashed onto the flight deck of and caused a fire, killing 14 crewmen and injuring 45 others. The Prowler was running out of fuel after a missed approach (&quot;bolter&quot; in Navy parlance), and its crash and the subsequent fire and explosions destroyed or damaged 19 other aircraft.
* On 3 November 1992, a US Navy EA-6B (161776,P99 First lCAP ll) from VAQ 129 crashed after takeoff outside of Naval Air Facility, El Centro killing all three crew members aboard; Crew included Capt. Peter Limoge (USMC), LT. Charles Gurley (USN), LT. Dave Roberts (USN).
* On 3 February 1998, a USMC EA-6B, BuNo 163045, from VMAQ-2 struck the cables of a cable car system in Cavalese, Italy. The crew broke rules to fly low at high speed in mountainous terrain, cut the cables and caused the death of 20 people when a cable car running on the line fell to the ground. The aircraft also suffered severe damage to its vertical stabiliser and wings as a result of striking the cable, but was landed successfully at Aviano Air Base.
* On 8 November 1998, a USN EA-6B landed on a Lockheed S-3 Viking during night landing qualifications on ; four crew members were killed.
* On 11 March 2013, a USN EA-6B of Electronic Attack Squadron VAQ-129 in Washington State, crashed during a training exercise. LTJG Valerie Cappelaere Delaney (Pilot), LTJG William Brown McIlvaine III (Flight Officer), and LCDR Alan A. Patterson (Instructor and Flight Officer) were killed. A year later, an investigation determined that the Prowler experienced a controlled flight into terrain that was due to pilot error.

== Variants ==

* EA-6A: Two early production A-6As converted to EA-6As as prototypes. Total of 25 EA-6As were built, including 10 conversions of A-6As and 15 production EA-6As.
* EA-6B: Three A-6As converted as initial prototypes. Total of 170 EA-6Bs were built.

<doc id="204756" wikidata="Q5612369" url="?curid=204756" title="Grutter v. Bollinger">
<text>Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), was a landmark case of the Supreme Court of the United States concerning affirmative action in student admissions. The Court held that a student admissions process that favors &quot;underrepresented minority groups&quot; did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause so long as it took into account other factors evaluated on an individual basis for every applicant. The decision largely upheld the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Regents of the University of California v. Bakke&quot; (1978), which allowed race to be a consideration in admissions policy but held racial quotas to be unconstitutional. In its companion case, &quot;Gratz v. Bollinger&quot; (2003), the Court struck down a points-based admissions system that awarded an automatic bonus to the admissions scores of minority applicants.

The case arose after a prospective student to the University of Michigan Law School alleged that she had been denied admission because the school gave certain minority groups a significantly greater chance of admission. The school admitted that its admission process favored certain minority groups, but argued that there was a compelling state interest to ensure a &quot;critical mass&quot; of students from minority groups. In a majority opinion joined by four other justices, Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor held that the Constitution &quot;does not prohibit the law school&#x27;s narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.&quot;

In her majority opinion, O&#x27;Connor wrote that &quot;race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time,&quot; adding that the &quot;Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.&quot; Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer joined the Court&#x27;s opinion, but did not subscribe to the belief that the affirmative measures in question would be unnecessary in 25 years. In a dissent joined by three other justices, Chief Justice William Rehnquist argued that the university&#x27;s admissions system was, in fact, a thinly veiled and unconstitutional quota system.

In 2023, the Supreme Court effectively overruled &quot;Grutter v. Bollinger&quot; in &quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard&quot; and &quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina&quot;, finding that affirmative action in student admissions violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

==Dispute==

When the University of Michigan Law School denied admission to Barbara Grutter, a Michigan resident with a 3.8 GPA and 161 LSAT score, she filed this suit, alleging that respondents had discriminated against her on the basis of race in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as 42 U.S.C. § 1981; that she was rejected because the Law School uses race as a &quot;predominant&quot; factor, giving applicants belonging to certain minority groups a significantly greater chance of admission than students with similar credentials from disfavored racial groups; and that respondents had no compelling interest to justify that use of race. Lee Bollinger (then-President of the University of Michigan), was the named defendant of this case.

The University argued that there was a compelling state interest to ensure a &quot;critical mass&quot; of students from minority groups, particularly African Americans and Hispanics, which is realized within the student body. They argued that this aims to &quot;ensure that these minority students do not feel isolated or like spokespersons for their race; to provide adequate opportunities for the type of interaction upon which the educational benefits of diversity depend; and to challenge all students to think critically and re-examine stereotypes.&quot;

==Lower courts==
In March 2001, U.S. District Court Judge Bernard A. Friedman ruled that the admissions policies were unconstitutional because they &quot;clearly consider&quot; race and are &quot;practically indistinguishable from a quota system.&quot; Due to the significance of the case, the Court of Appeals agreed to hear the case &quot;en banc&quot;. In May 2002, in a closely divided 5–4 ruling, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision, citing the &quot;Bakke&quot; decision and allowing the use of race to further the &quot;compelling interest&quot; of diversity. The plaintiffs subsequently requested the Supreme Court review. The Court agreed to hear the case, the first time the Court had heard a case on affirmative action in education since the landmark &quot;Bakke&quot; decision of 25 years prior.

On April 1, 2003 the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments for &quot;Grutter&quot;. The Court allowed the recordings of the arguments to be released to the public the same day, only the second time the Court had allowed same-day release of oral arguments. The first time was &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;, 531 U.S. 98 (2000), the case that ultimately ended the 2000 presidential election.

==Supreme Court&#x27;s decision==
The Court&#x27;s majority ruling, authored by Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, held that the United States Constitution &quot;does not prohibit the law school&#x27;s narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.&quot; The Court held that the law school&#x27;s interest in obtaining a &quot;critical mass&quot; of minority students was indeed a &quot;tailored use&quot;. O&#x27;Connor noted that sometime in the future, perhaps twenty-five years hence, racial affirmative action would no longer be necessary in order to promote diversity. It implied that affirmative action should not be allowed permanent status and that eventually a &quot;colorblind&quot; policy should be implemented. The opinion read, &quot;race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time.&quot; &quot;The Court takes the Law School at its word that it would like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula and will terminate its use of racial preferences as soon as practicable. The Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.&quot; The phrase &quot;25 years from now&quot; was echoed by Justice Thomas in his dissent. Justice Thomas, writing that the system was &quot;illegal now&quot;, concurred with the majority only on the point that he agreed the system would still be illegal 25 years hence.

The decision largely upheld the position asserted in Justice Powell&#x27;s concurrence in &quot;Regents of the University of California v. Bakke&quot;, which allowed race to be a consideration in admissions policy, but held that quotas were illegal.

Public universities and other public institutions of higher education across the nation are now allowed to use race as a plus factor in determining whether a student should be admitted. While race may not be the only factor, the decision allows admissions bodies to take race into consideration along with other individualized factors in reviewing a student&#x27;s application. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s opinion answers the question for the time being as to whether &quot;diversity&quot; in higher education is a compelling governmental interest. As long as the program is &quot;narrowly tailored&quot; to achieve that end, it seems likely that the Court will find it constitutional.

In the majority were Justices O&#x27;Connor, Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas dissented. Much of the dissent concerned a disbelief in the validity of the law school&#x27;s claim that the system was necessary to create a &quot;critical mass&quot; of minority students and provide a diverse educational environment. In the dissent, Chief Justice Rehnquist used admissions data to argue that unconstitutional discrimination occurred, despite the precedent set in &quot;McCleskey v. Kemp&quot; that dismisses statistical racial disparities as doctrinally irrelevant in equal protection claims.

The case was heard in conjunction with &quot;Gratz v. Bollinger&quot;, , in which the Court struck down the University of Michigan&#x27;s more rigid, point-based undergraduate admission policy, which was essentially deemed a quota system. The case generated a record number of amicus curiae briefs from institutional supporters of affirmative action. A lawyer who filed an amicus curiae brief on behalf of members and former members of the Pennsylvania legislature, State Rep. Mark B. Cohen of Philadelphia, said that Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s majority decision in &quot;Grutter v. Bollinger&quot; was a &quot;ringing affirmation of the goal of an inclusive society.&quot; In both &quot;Grutter&quot; and &quot;Gratz&quot;, O&#x27;Connor was the swing vote.

==Dissent==
Chief Justice Rehnquist, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas, argued the Law School&#x27;s admissions policy was an attempt to achieve an unconstitutional type of racial balancing. The Chief Justice attacked the Law School&#x27;s asserted goal of reaching a &quot;critical mass&quot; of minority students, finding the absolute number of African-American, Hispanic, and Native American students varied markedly, which is inconsistent with the concept in that one would think the same size critical mass would be needed for all minority groups. He noted that &quot;[f]rom 1995 through 2000, the Law School admitted... between 13 and 19... Native American[s], between 91 and 108... African American[s], and between 47 and 56... Hispanic[s]... One would have to believe that the objectives of &#x27;critical mass&#x27; offered by respondents are achieved with only half the number of Hispanics, and one-sixth the number of Native Americans as compared to African Americans.&quot; Citing admissions statistics, the Chief Justice noted the tight correlation between the percentage of applicants and admittees of a given race and argued that the numbers were &quot;far too precise to be dismissed as merely the result of the school paying &#x27;some attention to [the] numbers.&#x27;&quot;

Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, issued a strongly worded opinion, concurring in part and dissenting in part, arguing that if Michigan could not remain a prestigious institution and admit students under a race-neutral system, the &quot;Law School should be forced to choose between its classroom aesthetic and its exclusionary admissions system.&quot; In Justice Thomas&#x27; opinion, there is no compelling state interest in Michigan maintaining an elite law school, because a number of states do not have law schools, let alone elite ones. Moreover, Justice Thomas noted that in &quot;United States v. Virginia&quot;, , the Court required the Virginia Military Institute to radically reshape its admissions process and the character of that institution.

Another criticism raised by Justice Thomas compared Michigan Law to the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, where California&#x27;s Proposition 209 had barred Berkeley Law from &quot;granting preferential treatment on the basis of race in the operation of public education.&quot; Despite Proposition 209, however, Berkeley Law was still able to achieve a diverse student body. According to Thomas, &quot;the Court is willfully blind to the very real experience in California and elsewhere, which raises the inference that institutions with &#x27;reputations for excellence&#x27;...rivaling [Michigan Law&#x27;s] have satisfied their sense of mission without resorting to prohibited racial discrimination.&quot;

A final criticism leveled at Justice O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s opinion was the length of time the racial admissions policy will be lawful. Justice Thomas concurred that racial preferences would be unlawful in 25 years, however, he contended that in fact the Court should have found race-based affirmative action programs in higher education unlawful now:

I therefore can understand the imposition of a 25-year ban limit only as a holding that the deference the Court pays to the Law School&#x27;s educational judgments and refusal to change its admissions policies will itself expire. At that point these policies will clearly have failed to &quot;&#x27;eliminate the [perceived] need for any racial or ethnic&#x27;&quot; discrimination because the academic credentials gap will still be there. [citation omitted] The Court defines this time limit in terms of narrow tailoring, [internal citation omitted] but I believe this arises from its refusal to define rigorously the broad state interest vindicated today. [internal citation omitted]. With these observations, I join the last sentence of Part III of the opinion of the Court.
==Timeline of federal courts&#x27; decisions==
*The District Court found the Law School&#x27;s use of race as an admissions factor unlawful.
*The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that Justice Powell&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Bakke&quot; was binding precedent establishing diversity as a compelling state interest, and that the Law School&#x27;s use of race was narrowly tailored because race was merely a &quot;potential &#x27;plus&#x27; factor&quot; and because the Law School&#x27;s program was virtually identical to the Harvard admissions program described approvingly by Justice Powell and appended to his Bakke opinion.
*The Supreme Court affirmed the Sixth Circuit&#x27;s reversal of the District Court decision, thereby upholding the University&#x27;s admissions policy.

==Law adopted post case==
Following the decision, petitions were circulated to change the Michigan State Constitution. The measure, called the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative, or Proposal 2, passed in November 2006 and prohibited the use of race in the Law School admissions processes. In this respect, Proposal 2 is similar to California&#x27;s Proposition 209 and Washington&#x27;s Initiative 200, other initiatives that also banned the use of race in public university admissions decisions.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit overturned MCRI on July 1, 2011. Judges R. Guy Cole Jr. and Martha Craig Daughtrey said that &quot;Proposal 2 reorders the political process in Michigan to place special burdens on minority interests.&quot; This decision was upheld by the full Court of Appeals on November 16, 2012. After the ruling, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette announced he would appeal the court ruling to the Supreme Court. On March 25, 2013 the Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari, agreeing to hear the case. The Court ultimately upheld MCRI in &quot;Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action&quot;.

The Supreme Court decided a challenge to the University of Texas at Austin&#x27;s admission policy, Fisher v. University of Texas, in June 2013. In this case, the Court reaffirmed that universities were entitled to deference on their judgment that diversity is a compelling state interest. Importantly, though, the Court ruled that a university was entitled to &quot;no deference&quot; on its judgment that race-based affirmative action was necessary to achieve diversity and its educational benefits. The Court remanded the case to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for reconsideration, and that court again upheld UT&#x27;s use of race. The plaintiff again appealed to the Supreme Court in 2016, which held that the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit correctly found that the University of Texas at Austin&#x27;s undergraduate admissions policy survived strict scrutiny, in accordance with Fisher v. University of Texas (2013).

The same advocacy group and legal team challenging UT Austin also filed lawsuits against Harvard University (&quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard&quot;) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (&quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina&quot;) in November 2014. On June 29, 2023, the Roberts Court decided in &quot;Harvard&quot; that the university&#x27;s affirmative action program constituted unlawful racial discrimination, effectively overturning &quot;Grutter&quot;.

==Further challenge==
The Supreme Court granted certiorari to &quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College&quot; and &quot;Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. University of North Carolina&quot;, two cases dealing with race-based admissions at Harvard College and The University of North Carolina in January.
The Court issued its opinion in the two cases and found that the colleges did not properly follow the &quot;Grutter&quot; standard in the manner in which race was incorporated into the admissions process.

<doc id="204758" wikidata="Q858887" url="?curid=204758" title="Pathet Lao">
<text>The Pathet Lao (), officially the Lao People&#x27;s Liberation Army, was a communist political movement and organization in Laos, formed in the mid-20th century. The group ultimately gained control over the entire country of Laos in 1975, after the Laotian Civil War. The Pathet Lao were always closely associated and dependent on Vietnamese communists and North Vietnam since their foundation, with the group being established after advice from Hanoi to create a Laotian counterpart of the Viet Minh or Viet Cong. During the civil war, it was effectively organised, equipped and even led by the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN). They fought against the anti-communist forces in the Vietnam War. Eventually, the term became the generic name for Laotian communists.
Under orders from Mao Zedong, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army provided 115,000 guns, 920,000 grenades and 170 million bullets, and trained more than 700 of its military officers.

== Organization ==
The political movement of the Pathet Lao was called first the &quot;Lao People&#x27;s Party&quot; (1955–1972) and later the &quot;Lao People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party&quot; (1972–present).

Key Pathet Lao leaders include Prince Souphanouvong, Kaysone Phomvihane, Phoumi Vongvichit, Nouhak Phoumsavanh and Khamtay Siphandone.

The political wing of the Pathet Lao, called the &quot;Lao Patriotic Front&quot; () served in multiple coalition governments, starting in 1956. Through the 1960s and 1970s the Pathet Lao battled the Royal Lao government during the Laotian Civil War, gaining control of the north and east of Laos. The Pathet Lao gained power throughout the country by early 1975. In December, the US-backed government fell and the Lao People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party formed a new government. 
==History==
=== 1940s and 1950s ===

The organization can trace its roots from the Second World War, similar to the Khmer Issarak in Cambodia and the Viet Minh in Vietnam. Originally the Lao Issara, an anti-French, non-communist nationalist movement formed on 12 October 1945, it was renamed the &quot;Pathet Lao&quot; in 1950 when it was adopted by Lao forces under Souphanouvong, who joined the Viet Minh&#x27;s revolt against colonial French authorities in Indochina during the First Indochina War.

Souphanouvong, who had spent seven years in Nha Trang during his sixteen years in Vietnam, met Ho Chi Minh, married a Vietnamese woman while in Vietnam, and solicited Viet Minh aid in founding a guerrilla force.

In August 1950, Souphanouvong joined the Viet Minh in their headquarters north of Hanoi, and became the head of the Pathet Lao, along with its political arm dubbed &quot;Neo Lao Issara&quot; (Free Lao Front). The Pathet Lao founded resistance government with members: Souphanouvong (Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs), Kaysone Phomvihane (Minister of Defence), Nouhak Phoumsavanh (Minister of Finance), Phoumi Vongvichit (Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of the Interior), Souk Vongsak, Sithon Kommadam, and Phaydang Lobliayao. This was an attempt to give a false front of authority to the Lao communist movement by claiming to represent a united non-partisan effort. Two of its most important founders were members of the Indochinese Communist Party, which advocated an overthrow of the monarchy as well as the expulsion of the French.

In 1953, Pathet Lao fighters accompanied an invasion of Laos from Vietnam led by Viet Minh forces; they established a government at Viengxay in Houaphanh province, northeast Laos. The communists began to make incursions into central Laos with the support of the Viet Minh, and a civil war erupted; the Pathet Lao quickly occupied substantial sections of the country.

The 1954 Geneva Conference agreements required the withdrawal of foreign forces, and allowed the Pathet Lao to establish itself as a regime in Laos&#x27;s two northern provinces. The Viet Minh and North Vietnamese, in spite of the agreement, never really withdrew from the border areas of Laos and the Pathet Lao continued to operate almost as a branch organization of the Viet Minh. Two months after the conference, the North Vietnamese formed Group 100 with headquarters at Na Mèo. The unit effectively controlled and directed the Pathet Lao movement.

It was formed into an official party, the Lao Patriotic Front (Neo Lao Hak Sat (NLHS)), on 6 January 1956. Its stated goal was to wage the communist struggle against capitalism, as well as Western colonialism and imperialism.Unstated was its subordination to the Communist Party of Vietnam.

A coalition government was established in 1957 between the monarchists and communists. In May 1959 two Pathet Lao battalions which had been selected for integration into the Royal Lao Army (RLA) were surrounded by RLA troops who attempted to disarm them. Part of one battalion was captured but the remainder fled to North Vietnam. Then in July 1959 Lao police arrested 16 Neo Lao Hak Sat members, including seven who had been elected to the National Assembly, on charges of treason. These actions brought about a resumption of fighting.

===1959 to 1975===
In late 1959, North Vietnam had reoccupied areas of eastern Laos. The area was used as a transit route for men and supplies destined for the Viet Cong insurgency in South Vietnam which became known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail. In September 1959, North Vietnam formed Group 959 in Laos with the aim of securing the supply route to South Vietnam and building the Pathet Lao into a stronger counterforce against the Lao Royal government. Group 959 openly supplied, trained and militarily supported the Pathet Lao. The typical strategy during this era was for PAVN regulars to attack first but then send in the Pathet Lao at the end of the battle to claim victory.

In the early 1960s, more attempts at neutrality agreements and coalition government were attempted, principally the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos signed in Geneva on 23 July 1962, but as North Vietnam had no intention of withdrawing from Laos, these agreements all failed. The Pathet Lao entered into another coalition government in June 1962 but by April 1963 the Pathet Lao abandoned the coalition and resumed fighting.

By the mid-1960s, the country had fallen into proxy warfare between pro-US and pro-North Vietnamese irregular military groups. The PAVN/Pathet Lao battled the RLA, US irregular forces (including Air America and other contract employees and Hmong commandos) and Thai volunteer forces in Laos winning effective control in the north and east. The government itself was effectively powerless.

Until 1968 military operations were conducted by small units, usually of company or at most battalion size. Typically the RLA would be dominant in the wet season from May through October when the PAVN/Pathet Lao were immobilized by the rains and the PAVN/Pathet Lao would dominate during the dry season from November through April. PAVN forces in Laos were primarily focused on supporting and defending the Ho Chi Minh Trail, with support for the Pathet Lao revolution as a secondary role. In 1968 of the estimated 40,000 PAVN troops in Laos, 25,000 were engaged in supporting the Trail, 700 as advisers to the Pathet Lao and the remainder in mobile units supporting Pathet Lao operations. Publicly the North Vietnamese maintained that they did not have any troops in Laos and were respecting the Geneva Agreement, while the United States and its allies were violating it; the United States asserted the exact opposite.

The Pathet Lao supreme headquarters or center was located in the Viengxay caves near Xam Neua manned by approximately 500 personnel. NLHS membership was estimated as being 11,000 in 1965 and 14,000 in 1978.

In October 1965 the armed forces were renamed the Lao People&#x27;s Liberation Army (LPLA). The LPLA&#x27;s estimated strength was 25,000 in June 1965, 33,000 in April 1967, 48,000+ in 1970 and 35,000 in late 1972. The LPLA was divided into regular, regional/popular and militia/guerrilla forces. LPLA forces had PAVN advisers assigned to them but were not mixed with PAVN forces. Recruitment into the LPLA was based on appeals to the patriotism of young Laotians who were told that their country was rich in natural resources but the people were poor because of capitalism and US imperialism. If volunteers were not forthcoming then youth would be drafted, with the draft age of 15, but in many cases conscripts were as young as 12. Training was rudimentary with a greater emphasis placed on political indoctrination than on military skills as the &quot;fighting will&quot; was deemed to be the most important source of military strength. Military units had political commissars down to company level. The LPLA were entirely dependent on the PAVN for the supply of weapons and munitions and were generally outgunned by the RLA.

In May 1968, the PAVN launched a multi-division invasion of Laos. The Pathet Lao effectively served as an auxiliary force to the PAVN. In June 1969 the PAVN/Pathet Lao launched Campaign Toan Thang, their first wet season offensive. Even though US air bombardments contributed to the majority of PAVN/Pathet casualties, the RLA were unable to match the numerical strength of the PAVN/Pathet Lao forces, and the RLA took heavy losses. In September 1969 the RLA attacked PAVN/Pathet Lao positions on the Plain of Jars and along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. While initially successful, the RLA forces were eventually pushed back by the PAVN/Pathet Lao Campaign 139.

On 2 February 1971 the PAVN/Pathet Lao launched Campaign 74B temporarily capturing the Plain of Jars and shelling Long Tieng, the base of Vang Pao&#x27;s RLA aligned army before withdrawing. On 28 October 1972 the PAVN/Pathet Lao launched Campaign 972 scoring a series of victories over the war-weary RLA forces.

With the signing of the Paris Peace Accords on 27 January 1973 all U.S. prisoners were to be released under Operation Homecoming. The United States Department of Defense (DOD) listed 311 Americans as missing in Laos, however on 1 February 1973 the North Vietnamese handed the Americans a list of prisoners of war in Laos which included only nine Americans: seven servicemen and two civilians. U.S. agencies believe that as many as 41 Americans may have been held prisoner by the Pathet Lao. Charles Shelton who was captured on 29 April 1965 was listed as a prisoner by the DOD until September 1994. As of 26 July 2019 the DOD&#x27;s Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency listed 286 Americans as missing in Laos, of which 263 were classified as further pursuit, 12 deferred and 11 non-recoverable.
Shortly after the Paris Peace Accords ended U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, the Pathet Lao and the government of Laos signed a cease-fire agreement, the Vientiane Treaty, on 21 February 1973.

On 4 April 1974 the Provisional Government of National Union (PGNU) was formed in Laos.

On 14 December 1974, the Pathet Lao killed Charles Dean and Neil Sharman, backpackers who were captured near Vientiane.

The peace envisaged by the Vientiane Treaty lasted only two years. The Pathet Lao refused to disarm and the PAVN did not leave the country.In late February 1975, the Pathet Lao, with PAVN assistance, began attacking government strongholds on the Plain of Jars.

With the fall of the Cambodian government to the Khmer Rouge on 17 April and the fall of the South Vietnamese government to the PAVN on 30 April 1975 the non-communist elements of the national government decided that allowing the Pathet Lao to enter power would be better than to have them take it by force.Long Tieng was evacuated in mid-May. On 23 August 1975, Pathet Lao forces quietly entered the capital Vientiane.

On 2 December 1975, the Pathet Lao firmly took over the government, abolishing the monarchy and establishing the Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic. Shortly thereafter, the Pathet Lao signed an agreement with Vietnam that allowed Vietnam to station part of its army in the country and to send political and economic advisors into Laos.Vietnam afterward forced Laos to cut any remaining economic ties to its other neighbours, including Thailand and Cambodia.

After the Pathet Lao took over the country in 1975, the conflict continued in isolated pockets. In 1977, a communist newspaper promised the party would hunt down the &quot;American collaborators&quot; and their families &quot;to the last root&quot;. With the demise of the Soviet Union, control of Laos by Vietnam waned at the end of the 1980s. Today, &quot;Pathet Lao&quot; is often invoked as a general term signifying Lao nationalism.

<doc id="204760" wikidata="Q254018" url="?curid=204760" title="Jessica Lynch">
<text>Jessica Dawn Lynch (born April 26, 1983) is an American teacher, actress, and former United States Army soldier who served in the 2003 invasion of Iraq as a private first class.

On March 23, 2003, she was serving as a unit supply specialist with the 507th Maintenance Company when her convoy was ambushed by Iraqi troops during the Battle of Nasiriyah; Lynch was seriously injured during the offensive and captured by Iraqi soldiers shortly afterwards. Her subsequent recovery by U.S. special operations forces on April 1, 2003, received considerable media coverage as it was the first successful rescue of an American prisoner of war since World War II and the first ever of a woman.

Initial official reports on Lynch&#x27;s capture and rescue in Iraq were incorrect. On April 24, 2007, she testified in front of United States Congress that she had never fired her weapon (her M16 rifle reportedly having jammed), and that she had been knocked unconscious when her vehicle crashed during the ambush. Lynch has been outspoken in her criticism of the original stories that were reported regarding her combat experience. When asked about her heroine status, she stated: &quot;That wasn&#x27;t me. I&#x27;m not about to take credit for something I didn&#x27;t do... I&#x27;m just a survivor.&quot;

In 2014, Lynch made her acting debut as specialist Summer L. Gabriel in the 2014 film &quot;Virtuous&quot;. Her role was loosely based on her own experiences during the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.

==Early life==
Lynch was born on April 26, 1983 in Palestine, West Virginia, the second child and first daughter to Deidre Lynch and Gregory Lynch, Sr. Her family could not afford to send her to college; her older brother had to drop out for financial reasons as well. Searching for a way to pay for the children&#x27;s educations, the Lynch family met with an army recruiter in the summer of 2000 when Lynch was seventeen and still attending high school. &quot;He did not lie to the kids,&quot; her mother said, &quot;he said there was always the possibility of war in the future.&quot; &quot;But at that time it was before September 11, and there was no terrorism,&quot; Lynch recalls, &quot;so we were like, &#x27;that would never happen to On September 19, 2001, Lynch entered basic training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. She later completed Advanced Individual Training for her Military Occupational Specialty as a unit supply specialist (MOS 92Y) in the Quartermaster Corps at Fort Lee, Virginia.

==Military career==
===Battle of Nasiriyah===
On March 23, 2003, a convoy of the United States Army&#x27;s 507th Maintenance Company and the 3rd Combat Support Battalion elements, led by a Humvee driven by Lori Piestewa, made a wrong turn and were ambushed near Nasiriyah, a major crossing point over the Euphrates northwest of Basra. The convoy was supposed to detour around the town but instead turned directly into it, eventually running into an ambush. The ambush was unlikely to have been set up in advance, because the Iraqis did not know which course the convoy would take. Although some vehicles had GPS receivers, military GPS systems, unlike civilian equivalents, provide only grid references and not turn-by-turn navigation. Maps of the area lack the detail required to properly navigate through tight city streets. Apparently, the convoy took more than one wrong turn. The convoy came under attack by enemy fire. The Humvee in which Lynch was riding was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and crashed into the rear of a tractor-trailer. Lynch was severely injured.

Lynch, then a supply clerk with the 507th Maintenance Company from Fort Bliss, Texas, was wounded and captured by Iraqi forces. She was initially listed as missing in action. Eleven other soldiers in the company were killed in the ambush. Five other soldiers were captured and subsequently rescued 21 days later. Lynch&#x27;s best friend, Lori Piestewa, received a serious head wound and died in an Iraqi civilian hospital.

A video of some of the American prisoners of war, including Piestewa, was later shown around the world on Al Jazeera television. Later, footage was discovered of both Lynch and Piestewa at an Iraqi hospital before the latter died.

===Prisoner of war===
After some time in the custody of the Iraqi army regiment that had captured her, Lynch was taken to a hospital in Nasiriyah. Iraqi hospital staff, including doctors Harith Al-Houssona and Anmar Uday, said they shielded Lynch from Iraqi military and government agents who were using the hospital as a base of military operations. US forces were tipped off as to Lynch&#x27;s whereabouts by an Iraqi, who told them she had been tortured and injured but was still alive. The Iraqi was described as a 32-year-old lawyer, initially described only as &quot;Mohammed&quot; and later identified as Mohammed Odeh al Rehaief. In light of Mohammed&#x27;s role in Lynch&#x27;s rescue, he and his family were granted refugee status by the United States.

Initial reports indicated that al Rehaief&#x27;s wife was a nurse in the hospital where Lynch was being held captive, and that while visiting his wife at the hospital, al Rehaief noticed that security was heightened and inquired as to why. However, hospital personnel later confirmed only part of al Rehaief&#x27;s story, indicating that while al Rehaief had indeed visited the hospital, his wife was not a nurse there. While visiting the hospital from which Lynch was eventually extracted, al Rehaief also claimed that he had observed an Iraqi colonel slapping Lynch. &quot;My heart stopped&quot;, said al Rehaief, &quot;I knew then I must help her be saved. I decided I must go to tell the Americans.&quot;

Al Rehaief&#x27;s story has been disputed by doctors working at the hospital, who say that Lynch was shielded and protected from Iraqi military personnel by hospital staff and was treated well throughout her stay at the hospital. Lynch&#x27;s own story concurs with these accounts, saying that she was treated humanely, with a nurse even singing to her.

Moreover, according to reports, on March 30, Al-Houssona reportedly attempted to have Lynch delivered to the U.S. forces, an attempt which had to be abandoned when the Americans fired on the Iraqi ambulance carrying her.

According to al Rehaief&#x27;s version of the events leading up to Lynch&#x27;s rescue, he walked six miles to a US Marine checkpoint to inform American forces that he knew where Lynch was being held. After talking with the Marines, al Rehaief was then sent back to the hospital to gather more information, which was used to plan Lynch&#x27;s rescue. Allegedly, al Rehaief returned to the checkpoint with five different maps of the hospital and the details of the security layout, reaction plan, and shift changes.

The US military reportedly learned of Lynch&#x27;s location from several informants, one of whom was al Rehaief.

===Hospital retrieval===
On April 1, 2003, U.S. Marines from 3rd Battalion 4th Marines, 2nd Battalion 8th Marines and 2nd Battalion 1st Marines, as well as members from the Navy SEALs under the command of the U.S. Army, staged a diversionary attack, besieging nearby Iraqi irregulars to draw them away from Saddam Hospital (now named the Imam Hussein Teaching Hospital - 31°03&#x27;31.2&quot;N 46°14&#x27;45.8&quot;E) in Nasiriyah. Meanwhile, an element from the Joint Special Operations Task Force 121 composed of U.S. Army Special Forces (Green Berets), Air Force Pararescuemen (PJs), Army Rangers, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) and Delta Force launched a nighttime raid on the hospital, and successfully retrieved Lynch and the bodies of eight other American soldiers.

According to certain accounts of doctors present during the raid, they were gathered into groups at gunpoint and treated as possible hostiles until they could be identified as being hospital staff. Many military and Special Operations Forces experts have defended the tactics of the operators who led the raid, saying that Special Operations Forces teams are trained to expect the worst and move quickly, initially treating each person they encounter as a possible threat. Additionally, the doctors stated that the Iraqi military had left the hospital the day before, and that no one in the hospital had offered any resistance to the American forces during the raid.

One witness account claimed that the Special Operations Forces had foreknowledge that the Iraqi military had fled a day before they raided the hospital, and that the entire event was staged, even going so far as to use blanks to create the appearance that they were firing. The use of blanks was disputed by weapons experts who pointed out that there was no sign of blank adapters being used on the weapons of those who appeared in the video of the raid.

In the initial press briefing on April 2, 2003, the Pentagon released a five-minute video of the rescue and claimed that Lynch had stab and bullet wounds, and that she had been slapped while on her hospital bed and interrogated.

Iraqi doctors and nurses later interviewed, including Harith Al-Houssona, a doctor in the Nasiriyah hospital, described Lynch&#x27;s injuries as &quot;a broken arm, a broken thigh, and a dislocated ankle&quot;. According to Al-Houssona, there was no sign of gunshot or stab wounds, and Lynch&#x27;s injuries were consistent with those that would be suffered in a car accident, which Lynch verified when she stated that she got hurt when her Humvee flipped and broke her leg. Al-Houssona&#x27;s account of events was later confirmed in a U.S. Army report leaked on July 10, 2003.

US Army medical reports later indicated that Lynch had been raped during the first three hours of her captivity, while she was unconscious. The authorized biography, &quot;I Am A Soldier Too: The Jessica Lynch Story,&quot; by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Rick Bragg describes Lynch as being sodomized during captivity, although the Iraqi doctors who rescued and treated her denied that they had found evidence of sexual assault.

Аlthough articles, citing medical records and the nature of Jessica&#x27;s injuries, claim that Jessica was raped while in captivity, Jessica herself says that she does not remember any sexual assault. She was categorically against mentioning the rape in the book, but Rick Bragg insisted, arguing that &quot;people need to know what can happen to female soldiers in war&quot;.

===Departure from Iraq===
From Kuwait, Lynch was transported to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Germany, where she was expected to recover fully from her injuries. On the flight to Ramstein Air Base in Germany, the military medics kept her sedated and hydrated. Her family flew to Germany on April 5 to be reunited with her. In a statement, the hospital said, &quot;Lynch had a big smile on her face when her parents arrived.&quot;

Lynch underwent back surgery on April 3 to correct a vertebra that was putting pressure on her spinal cord. Since then, she has undergone several more surgeries to stabilize her fractures.

Eleven bodies were recovered at the same time of Lynch&#x27;s rescue, nine from a shallow gravesite and two from the morgue. Following forensic identification, eight were identified as fellow members of her company, including Private First Class Lori Piestewa. All were subsequently given posthumous Purple Hearts. Details of their deaths are unclear.

Lynch was shown during a controversial display on Al Jazeera television of four other supply-unit POWs. That video also showed a number of dead soldiers from that unit with gunshot wounds to the forehead.

After learning of Mohammed Odeh al-Rehaief&#x27;s role in Lynch&#x27;s rescue, &quot;Friends of Mohammed&quot;, a group based in Malden, West Virginia, was formed to press for al Rehaief to be naturalized as a U.S. citizen and to bring him to West Virginia. On April 29, 2003, Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge announced that Mohammed Odeh al Rehaief, his wife, and their five-year-old daughter had been granted humanitarian asylum on April 28. Al Rehaief and his family were brought to the United States at his request April 10. Al Rehaief published a book, &quot;Because Each Life Is Precious&quot; in October 2003, for a reported US$150,000. He now works in the U.S.

===Return home===
Upon her return she was greeted by thousands of West Virginia residents including her then-boyfriend, Army Sergeant Ruben Contreras. Lynch and Contreras became engaged after her return but later separated.

On April 12, 2003, Lynch was flown to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., to undergo specialized treatment and rehabilitation. On April 17, she underwent surgery to repair a bone in her right foot.

While recovering in Washington, Lynch was inundated with gifts and flowers from well-wishers, so much so that she asked the public to send cards instead. Her family suggested that the public send money to charity and relief organizations.

Lynch was released from the hospital on July 22, more than three months after her injury.

On August 27, 2003, Lynch was given an honorable discharge.

== Awards and decorations ==

==Controversy regarding coverage==
Lynch blamed the U.S. government for embellishing the story as part of the Pentagon&#x27;s propaganda effort.

Soon after Lynch was rescued, Pentagon officials disputed a report appearing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that Lynch had fought back, and the first official report of Lynch&#x27;s actions during her capture released by the Pentagon weeks later said that she did not appear to have fought back against her captors, in contradiction of earlier Pentagon press releases. According to one former Pentagon official, the stories of her supposed heroics that day were spread by the news media, and congressmen from West Virginia were instrumental in pushing the Pentagon to award her honors based on reports of her actions during her capture.

Months after returning, Lynch finally began speaking to the public. Her statements tended to be sharply critical of the original story that was reported by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. When asked about her heroine status, &quot;That wasn&#x27;t me. I&#x27;m not about to take credit for something I didn&#x27;t do ... I&#x27;m just a survivor.&quot;

Despite the letters of support she received after her testimony before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, Lynch says that she still gets hate mail from Americans who accuse her of making up the heroic acts attributed to her. &quot;I was captured, but then I was OK and I didn&#x27;t go down fighting. OK, so what?&quot; she says. &quot;It was really hard to convince people that I didn&#x27;t have to do any of that. That I was injured, that I still needed comfort.&quot;

She did not claim that she fought until being wounded, but she did say her weapon jammed immediately and that she could not have done anything anyway. Interviewed by Diane Sawyer, Lynch claimed, concerning the media and the Pentagon: &quot;They used me to symbolize all this stuff. It&#x27;s wrong. I don&#x27;t know why they filmed [the rescue mission] or why they say these things.&quot; She also stated &quot;I did not shoot, not a round, nothing. I went down praying to my knees. And that&#x27;s the last I remember.&quot;

Critics have also accused the media of bias in the coverage of Lynch versus that of her fellow soldiers, Shoshana Johnson and Lori Piestewa. All three were ambushed in the same attack during the Iraq War on March 23, 2003, with Piestewa being killed and Lynch and Johnson being injured and taken prisoner.

===Congressional hearings===
On April 24, 2007, Lynch gave congressional testimony before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that the Pentagon had erroneously portrayed her as a &quot;Rambo from the hills of West Virginia&quot; when, in fact, she never fired a shot after her truck was ambushed.

She began her testimony by noting for the record that her appearance was not politically motivated. In a prepared statement, she said:

==Later life==
Lynch attended West Virginia University at Parkersburg on a full scholarship because of her military service. She graduated with her Bachelor of Arts Degree in Elementary Education K-6 on December 16, 2011, after completing her student-teacher training at the same elementary school she had attended, in Wirt County, West Virginia. She had joined the U.S. Army at 18 in order to &quot;earn money for college and become a school teacher&quot;.

On May 6, 2006, Allison Barker of the Associated Press reported that Lynch, who had completed her freshman year, avoided talking about her military service at school, despite wearing a brace on her left foot protecting nerve damage from her capture: &quot;I think people recognize who I am; they just don&#x27;t make it obvious. That&#x27;s good for me because it gives me the opportunity to blend in and not stick out and really experience the college life, just like they are.&quot; Lynch also talked about her career plans and legacy: &quot;I know I want to do something with children. [But] I haven&#x27;t really found my direction, with everything I&#x27;ve been through ... I want people to remember me as being a soldier who went over there and did my job. Nothing special. I&#x27;m just a country girl at heart.&quot;

On August 24, 2006, &quot;Good Morning America Weekend Edition&quot; co-anchor Kate Snow reported that Lynch wrote a letter stating she would have a baby by the end of the year. Fox News reported that Lynch and her then-boyfriend Wes Robinson would have their first child in January. She made the statement: &quot;I was not sure if this could ever happen for me, learning to walk again and coping with the internal injuries that I still deal with pale in comparison to the tremendous joy of carrying this child.&quot; She gave birth on January 19, 2007, through a caesarean section, and named her daughter &quot;Dakota Ann&quot; after her fallen friend, Lori Ann Piestewa, the first woman of the U.S.-led Coalition killed in the Iraq War and the first Native American woman killed on foreign soil in an American war.

As of 2015, Lynch worked occasionally as a substitute teacher and made her living as a motivational speaker. She suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.

As of 2018, Lynch was a 5th grade teacher in West Virginia.

<text>Kam Mueang (, กำเมือง) or Northern Thai language () is the language of the Northern Thai people of Lanna, Thailand. It is a Southwestern Tai language. Kam Mueang has approximately six million speakers, most of whom live in the native Northern Thailand, with a smaller community of Lanna speakers in northwestern Laos.

Speakers of this language generally consider the name &quot;Tai Yuan&quot; to be pejorative. They refer to themselves as &#x27; (, [[:wikt:คน|คน]][[:wikt:เมือง|เมือง]], – literally &quot;people of [[Mueang]]&quot; meaning &quot;city dwellers&quot;), Lanna, or Northern Thai. The language is also sometimes referred to as&#x27; (พายัพ, ), &quot;Northwestern (speech)&quot;.

The term Yuan is still sometimes used for Northern Thai&#x27;s distinctive Tai Tham alphabet, which is closely related to the old Tai Lue alphabet and the Lao religious alphabets. The use of the &quot;&quot;, as the traditional alphabet is known, is now largely limited to Buddhist temples, where many old sermon manuscripts are still in active use. There is no active production of literature in the traditional alphabet, and when used in writing standard Thai script is invariably used. The modern spoken form is called . There is a resurgence of interest in writing it in the traditional way, but the modern pronunciation differs from that prescribed in spelling rules.

== Classification ==

Northern Thai is classified as one of the Chiang Saen languages—others being Thai, Southern Thai and numerous smaller languages, which together with the Northwestern Tai and Lao-Phutai languages, form the Southwestern branch of Tai languages. The Tai languages are a branch of the Kra–Dai language family, which encompasses a large number of indigenous languages spoken in an arc from Hainan and Guangxi south through Laos and Northern Vietnam to the Cambodian border.

From a purely genealogical standpoint, most linguists consider Northern Thai to be more closely related to Central Thai than to Lao or Isan, but the language has been heavily influenced by both Lao and Central Thai throughout history. All Southwestern Tai languages form a coherent dialect continuum of more or less mutually intelligible varieties, with few sharp dividing lines. Nevertheless, Northern Thai has today become closer to the Central Thai language, as Standard Thai is the principal language of education and government and spoken throughout Thailand. 

== Names ==
The Northern Thai language has various names in Northern Thai, Thai, and other Tai languages. 
* In Northern Thai, it is commonly called &#x27; (, , literally &quot;city language&quot;; cf. Standard Thai: คำเมือง ), or &#x27; (, ภาษาล้านนา , literally &quot;the language of Lan Na&quot;). 
* In Central Thai and Southern Thai, Northern Thai is known as &quot;phasa thin phayap&quot; (ภาษาถิ่นพายัพ , literally &quot;the language of the northwestern region&quot;), or &quot;phasa thai thin nuea&quot; (ภาษาไทยถิ่นเหนือ , literally &quot;the Thai language of the northern region&quot;, or colloquially it is known as &quot;phasa nuea&quot; (ภาษาเหนือ , literally &quot;the northern language&quot;). 
* In Lao, it is known as &#x27; or &#x27; ( or respectively, or respectively, literally &quot;the Tai Yuan language&quot;). 
* In Tai Lü, it is known as &quot;kam yon&quot; ( , literally &quot;the Tai Yuan language&quot;). 
* In Shan it is known as &quot;kwam yon&quot; ( , literally &quot;the Tai Yuan language&quot;).

== History ==
=== Tai migration ===

The ancestors of the Northern Thai people were speakers of Southwestern Tai dialects that migrated from what is now southeastern China, specifically what is now Guangxi and northern Vietnam where the diversity of various Tai languages suggests an &quot;Urheimat&quot;. The Southwestern Tai languages began to diverge from the Northern and Central branches of the Tai languages, covered mainly by various Zhuang languages, sometime around 112 AD, but likely completed by the sixth century. Due to the influx of Han Chinese soldiers and settlers, the end of the Chinese occupation of Vietnam, the fall of Jiaozhi and turbulence associated with the decline and fall of the Tang dynasty led some of the Tai peoples speaking Southwestern Tai to flee into Southeast Asia, with the small-scale migration mainly taking place between the eighth and twelfth centuries. The Tais split and followed the major river courses, with the ancestral Northern Thai originating in the Tai migrants that followed the Mekong River.

=== Indianized kingdoms ===
Ancestors of the Northern Thai people established Ngoenyang, an early kingdom that existed between the 7th to 13th centuries, as well as smaller kingdoms like Phayao, in what is now modern-day northern Thailand. They settled in areas adjacent to the kingdom of Hariphunchai, coming into contact with Mon-speaking people whose writing system was eventually adapted for the Northern Thai language as the Tai Tham script. In the 13th century, King Mangrai consolidated control of these territories, establishing the kingdom of Lan Na. In the 15th century, King Tilokkarat ushered in a golden age for Northern Thai literature, with a profusion of palm leaf manuscripts written in Tai Tham, using vernacular Northern Thai and interspersed with Pali and Buddhist Indic vocabulary.

=== Thai subordination ===
In 1775, Kawila of Lampang revolted with Siamese assistance, and captured the city, ending 200 years of Burmese rule. Kawila was installed as the prince of Lampang and Phraya Chaban as the prince of Chiang Mai, both as vassals of Siam. In 1899, Siam annexed the Northern Thai principalities, effectively dissolving their status as sovereign tributary states.

The Compulsory Education Act of 1921 banned schools and temples from using languages other than Central Thai (standard Thai), in an effort to bring remote regions under Siamese control. Northern Thai was relegated from the public sphere, with influential religious leaders like Khruba Srivichai jailed for using Northern Thai in sermons. In the 1940s, authorities promulgated Thai cultural mandates that reinforced the importance of learning and using Central Thai as the prestige language.

These economic and educational pressures have increased the use of standard Thai to the detriment of other regional languages like Northern Thai. Today, Northern Thai is typically code-switched with standard Thai, especially in more developed and urbanized areas of Northern Thailand, whereas exclusive use of Northern Thai remains prevalent in more remote areas.

== Dialects ==
Thanajirawat (2018) classifies Tai Yuan into five major dialect groups based on tonal split and merger patterns. (&quot;See also Proto-Tai language#Tones&quot;)

#most Tai Yuan varieties in Thailand, Laos and Myanmar
#Bokeo Province, Laos (A12-34 and BCD123-4 (B4=DL4=DS4))
#Mae Chaem District, Chiang Mai Province and Laplae District, Uttaradit Province, Thailand (A12-34 and BCD123-4 (A34=B123=DL123))
#Tha Pla District, Uttaradit Province and Xayaburi Province, Laos (A12-34, BDL1234, and CDS123-4)
#Ratchaburi Province, Thailand (A12-34 and BCD123-4 (A34=B123=DL123, B4=C4=DL4))

==Phonology==

===Consonants===

====Initial consonants====
Northern Thai consonant inventory is similar to that of Lao (Isan); both languages have the sound and lack .


====Initial consonant clusters====
There are two relatively common consonant clusters:

*/kw/ (กว)
*/kʰw/ (ขว, คว)

There are also several other, less frequent clusters recorded, though apparently in the process of being lost:

*/ŋw/ (งว)
*/tɕw/ (จว)
*/sw/ (ซว, สว)
*/tw/ (ตว)
*/tʰw/ (ถว, ทว)
*/nw/ (นว)
*/ɲw/ (ญว, ยว)
*/jw/ (ยว)
*/lw/ (ลว)
*/ʔw/ (อว)
==== Final consonants ====
All plosive sounds (besides the glottal stop /ʔ/) are unreleased. Hence, final , , and sounds are pronounced as , , and respectively.

===Vowels===
The basic vowels of the Northern Thai language are similar to those of Standard Thai. They, from front to back and close to open, are given in the following table. The top entry in every cell is the symbol from the , the second entry gives the spelling in the Thai alphabet, where a dash (–) indicates the position of the initial consonant after which the vowel is pronounced. A second dash indicates that a final consonant must follow.

The vowels each exist in long-short pairs: these are distinct phonemes forming unrelated words in Northern Thai, but usually transliterated the same: เขา (&quot;khao&quot;) means &quot;they/them&quot;, while ขาว (&quot;khao&quot;) means &quot;white&quot;.

The long-short pairs are as follows:

The basic vowels can be combined into diphthongs. For purposes of determining tone, those marked with an asterisk are sometimes classified as long:

Additionally, there are three triphthongs, For purposes of determining tone, those marked with an asterisk are sometimes classified as long:

====Allophones====
The following section largely concerns the Nan dialect of Northern Thai.
===Tones===

There are six phonemic tones in the Chiang Mai dialect of Northern Thai: low-rising, low-falling, high-level with glottal closure, mid-level, high-falling, and high-rising. or low-rising, mid-low, high-falling, mid-high, falling, and high rising-falling

==== Contrastive tones in smooth syllables ====
The table below presents six phonemic tones in the Chiang Mai and Nan dialects in smooth syllables, i.e. closed syllables ending in sonorant sounds such as [m], [n], [ŋ], [w], and [j] and open syllables. Sources have not agreed on the phonetic realization of the six tones in the Chiang Mai dialect. The table presents information based on two sources, one from Gedney (1999) and the other one from the Lanna dictionary (2007) which is a Northern Thai-Thai dictionary. Although published in 1999, Gedney&#x27;s information about the Chiang Mai dialect is based on data he collected from one speaker in Chiang Mai in 1964 (p. 725). As tones may change within one&#x27;s lifetime (e.g., Bangkok Thai tones have changed over the past 100 years), the information about the six tones from Gedney (1999) should be considered with caution.

The Gedney boxes for the tones are shown below the descriptions.

==== Contrastive tones in checked syllables ====
The table below presents four phonemic tones in checked syllables, i.e. closed syllables ending in a glottal stop [ʔ] and obstruent sounds such as [p], [t], and [k].
==Grammar==
The grammar of Northern Thai is similar to those of other Tai languages. The word order is subject–verb–object, although the subject is often omitted. Just as Standard Thai, Northern Thai pronouns are selected according to the gender and relative status of speaker and audience.

===Adjectives and adverbs===
There is no morphological distinction between adverbs and adjectives. Many words can be used in either function. They succeed the word which they modify, which may be a noun, verb, or another adjective or adverb. 
* / แม่ญิงเฒ่า (&quot;&quot;, ) &quot;an old woman&quot;
* / แม่ญิงตี้เฒ่าโวย (&quot;&quot;, ) &quot;a woman who became old quickly&quot;

Because adjectives can be used as complete predicates, many words used to indicate tense in verbs (see Verbs:Aspect below) may be used to describe adjectives.
* / ข้าหิว (&quot;&quot;, ) &quot;I am hungry.&quot;
* / ข้าจะหิว (&quot;&quot;, ) &quot;I will be hungry.&quot;
* / ข้ากะลังหิว (&quot;&quot;, ) &quot;I am hungry right now.&quot;
* / ข้าหิวแล้ว (&quot;&quot;, ) &quot;I am already hungry.&quot;

===Verbs===
Verbs do not inflect. They do not change with person, tense, voice, mood, or number; nor are there any participles.
* / ข้าตี๋เปิ้น (&quot;&quot;, ), &quot;I hit him&quot;.
* / เปิ้นตี๋ข้า (&quot;&quot;, ), &quot;He hit me&quot;.
The passive voice is indicated by the insertion of / โดน (&quot;, ) before the verb. For example:
* / เปิ้นโดนตี๋ (&quot;, ), &quot;He is hit&quot; or &quot;He got hit&quot;. This describes an action that is out of the receiver&#x27;s control and, thus, conveys suffering.

To convey the opposite sense, a sense of having an opportunity arrive, / ได้ (&quot;dai&quot;, , can) is used. For example:
* / เปิ้นจะได้ไปแอ่วเมืองลาว (&quot;&quot;, ), &quot;He gets to visit Laos.&quot;
* / เปิ้นตี๋ได้ (&quot;&quot;, ), &quot;He is/was allowed to hit&quot; or &quot;He is/was able to hit&quot;

Negation is indicated by placing บ่ (&quot;bor&quot;, or not) before the verb.
* / เปิ้นบ่ตี๋, (&quot;&quot;, ) &quot;He is not hitting.&quot; or &quot;He not hit.&quot;

Aspect is conveyed by aspect markers before or after the verb.
:Present can be indicated by / กะลัง (&#x27;, , currently) or / กะลังหะ (&#x27;, , currently) before the verb for ongoing action (like English -ing form), by / อยู่ (&quot;, ) after the verb, or by both. For example:
:* / เปิ้นกะลังหะล่น (&quot;, ), or
:* / เปิ้นล่นอยู่ (&quot;, ), or
:* / เปิ้นกะลังหะล่นอยู่ (&quot;, ), &quot;He is running.&quot;

:Future can be indicated by / จะ (&quot;cha&quot;, , will) before the verb or by a time expression indicating the future. For example:
:* / เปิ้นจะล่น (&quot;&quot;, ), &quot;He will run&quot; or &quot;He is going to run.&quot;

:Past can be indicated by / ได้ (&quot;dai&quot;, ) before the verb or by a time expression indicating the past. However, / แล้ว (&quot;laew&quot;, :, already) is often used to indicate the past aspect by being placed behind the verb. Or, both ได้ and แล้ว are put together to form the past aspect expression. For example:
:* / เปิ้นได้กิ๋น (&quot;&quot;, ), &quot;He ate.&quot;
:* / เปิ้นกิ๋นแล้ว (&quot;&quot;, , &quot;He has eaten.&quot;
:* / เปิ้นได้กิ๋นแล้ว (&quot;&quot;, ), &quot;He&#x27;s already eaten.&quot;
Aspect markers are not required.
:* / ข้ากิ๋นตี้หั้น (&quot;&quot;, ), &quot;I eat there.&quot;
:* / ข้ากิ๋นตี้หั้นตะวา (&quot;&quot;, ), &quot;I ate there yesterday.&quot;
:* / ข้ากิ๋นตี้หั้นวันพูก (&quot;&quot;, ), &quot;I&#x27;ll eat there tomorrow.&quot;

Words that indicate obligation include &quot;at cha&quot; ( / อาจจะ), &quot;na cha&quot; ( / หน้าจะ), &quot;khuan cha&quot; ( / ควรจะ), and &quot;tong&quot; ( / ต้อง).
*&quot;&quot; ( / อาจจะ, ) &quot;Might&quot;
:* / เปิ้นอาจจะมา (&quot;&quot;, ) &quot;He might come.&quot;
*&quot;&quot; ( / น่าจะ, ) &quot;Likely to&quot;
:* / เปิ้นน่าจะมา (&quot;&quot;, ) &quot;He is likely to come.&quot;
*&quot;&quot; ( / ควรจะ, ) &quot;Should&quot;
:* / เปิ้นควรจะมา (&quot;&quot;, ) &quot;He should come.&quot;
*&quot;&quot; ( / ต้อง, ) &quot;Must&quot;
:* / เปิ้นต้องมา (&quot;&quot;, ) &quot;He must come.&quot;

Actions that wherein one is busily engaged can be indicated by มัวก่า (&quot;mua ka&quot;, ).
:* / ก่อมัวก่ากิ๋นหั้นเนาะ (&quot;kor mua ka kin han nor&quot;, ) &quot;(It&#x27;s that you/he/she) just keeps on eating it like that, you know?&quot;

Words that express one&#x27;s desire to do something can by indicated by &quot;khai&quot; (ใค่) and &quot;kan&quot; (กั๊น).
*&quot;&quot; ( / ใค่, , &quot;to want, to desire&quot;)
:* / ข้าเจ้าใค่กิ๋น (&quot;&quot;, ) &quot;I want to eat.&quot;
*&quot;&quot; ( / กั๊น, , &quot;to try&quot;)
:* / ข้าเจ้ากั๊นกิ๋น (&quot;&quot;, ) &quot;I try to eat.&quot;

&quot; ( / ผ่อท่าว่า, ) is used to give the impression or sensation of being something or having a particular quality. 
:* / ผ่อท่าว่าเปิ้นปิ๊กมาแล้ว (&quot;, ) &quot;It seems that he has returned.&quot;

=== Final particles ===
Northern Thai has a number of final particles, which have different functions.

==== Interrogative particles ====
Some of the most common interrogative particles are &#x27; ( / ก่อ, ) and &#x27; ( / กา, )
*&quot; ( / ก่อ, , denoting yes/no question)
:* / ม่วนก่อ (&quot;, ) &quot;Is it fun?&quot;
*&quot; ( / กา (and its variants: ก๋า, กา), , denoting confirmative question) 
:* / ม่วนกา (&quot;, ) &quot;It is fun, right?&quot;

==== Imperative particles ====
Some imperative particles are (แล่), (จิ่ม), and (เตอะ).

&quot; ( / แล่, )
:* / กิ๋นแล่ (&quot;, ) &quot;Eat! (Authoritative)&quot;.
&quot; ( / จิ่ม, )
:* / ขอกิ๋นจิ่ม (&quot;, ) &quot;May I eat please?&quot;
&quot; ( / เหีย, )
:* / กิ๋นเหีย (&quot;, ) &quot;Eat! (because I know it will be beneficial to you)&quot;.
&quot; ( / เต๊อะ, )
:* / กิ๋นเต๊อะ (&quot;, ) &quot;Eat, please.&quot;

==== Polite particles ====
Polite particles include (คับ) and (เจ้า).
*&quot; ( / คับ, , used by males)
:* / กิ๋นเข้าแล้วคับ (&quot;, ) &quot;I have eaten, sir/ma&#x27;am&quot;.
*&quot; ( / เจ้า, , used by females)
:* / กิ๋นเข้าแล้วเจ้า (&quot;, ) &quot;I have eaten, sir/ma&#x27;am&quot;.

===Nouns===
Nouns are uninflected and have no gender; there are no articles.

Nouns are neither singular nor plural. Some specific nouns are reduplicated to form collectives: / ละอ่อน (&#x27;, , child) is often repeated as ละอ่อน ๆ (&#x27;, ,) to refer to a group of children.

The word / หมู่(&#x27;, ) may be used as a prefix of a noun or pronoun as a collective to pluralize or emphasise the following word. ( / หมู่ผม, &#x27;, , &quot;we&quot; (exclusive), masculine; / หมู่เฮา &#x27;, , emphasised &quot;we&quot;; / หมู่หมา &#x27;, , &quot;(the) dogs&quot;).

Plurals are expressed by adding classifiers, used as measure words (ลักษณนาม), in the form of noun-number-classifier ( / คูห้าคน, &quot;teacher five person&quot; for &quot;five teachers&quot;).

===Pronouns===
Pronouns may be omitted once they have already been established in the first sentence, unless the pronoun in the following sentences is different from the first sentence. The pronoun &quot;you&quot; may also be omitted if the speaker is speaking directly to a second person. Moreover, names may replace pronouns, and they can even replace the first person singular pronoun.
==Vocabulary==
Northern Thai shares much vocabulary with Standard Thai, especially scientific terms, which draw many prefixes and suffixes from Sanskrit and Pali, and it also has its own distinctive words. Just like Thai and Lao, Northern Thai has borrowed many loanwords from Khmer, Sanskrit, and Pali.
== Writing system ==

Currently, different scripts are used to write Northern Thai. Northern Thai is traditionally written with the Tai Tham script, which in Northern Thai is called &#x27; ( ตั๋วเมือง ) or &#x27; ( ตั๋วธัมม์ ). However, native speakers are presently illiterate in the traditional script; therefore, they instead use the Thai script to write the language. In Laos, the Lao script is commonly used to write Northern Thai.
Some problems arise when the Thai script is used to write Northern Thai. In particular, Standard Thai script cannot transcribe all Northern Thai tones. The two falling tones in Northern Thai correspond to a single falling tone in Thai. Specifically, Northern Thai has two types of falling tones: high-mid falling tone () and high-falling tone (). However, Thai lacks the distinction between the two falling tones, not having a high-falling tone (). When using Thai script to write Northern Thai tones, the distinction of the two falling tones is lost because Thai script can only indicate a low falling tone (). As an example, the tonal distinction between (ก้า ( กล้า) &quot;to be brave&quot;) and (ก้า ( ค่า) &quot;value&quot;) is lost when written in Thai since as only (ก้า) is permitted. Consequently, the meaning of ก้า is ambiguous as it can mean both &quot;to be brave&quot; and &quot;value&quot;. Similarly, (ป้าย ( ป้าย) &quot;sign&quot;) and (ป้าย ( พ่าย) &quot;to lose&quot;) have the same problem and only (ป้าย) is permitted. As a result, the spelling ป้าย is ambiguous because it can mean both &quot;sign&quot; or &quot;to lose&quot;. Such tonal mergence ambiguity is avoided when the language is written with the Northern Thai script.
==Northern Thai and Standard Thai==
The tables below present the differences between Northern Thai and Standard Thai.

===Different sounds===
Unlike Northern Thai, Standard Thai lacks alveolo-palatal nasal sound (/ɲ/). Thus, the alveolo-palatal nasal sound (/ɲ/) and the palatal approximant sound (/j/) in Northern Thai both correspond to the palatal approximant sound in Standard Thai:
Unlike Northern Thai, Standard Thai lacks a high-mid-falling tone ([˥˧]). The high-mid falling tone ([˥˧]) and high-falling tone ([˦˩]) in Northern Thai both correspond to the falling tone in Standard Thai ([˦˩]).
===Different words===
Many words differ from Standard Thai greatly:

===Similar words===
There is not a straightforward correspondence between the tones of Northern and Standard Thai. It also depends on the initial consonant, as can be seen from the merged Gedney tone boxes for Standard Thai and the accent of Chiang Mai:

Note that the commonalities between columns are features of the Chiang Mai accent. On the other hand, the relationships between rows are typical of Northern Thai, being found for at least for Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Phayao,

Nan and Prae, and extending at least to Tak and the old 6-tone accent of Tai Khuen, except that the checked syllables of Chiang Rai are more complicated.

The primary function of a tone box is etymological. However, it also serves as a summary of the rules for tone indication when the writing system is essentially etymological in that regard, as is the case with the major Tai-language writing systems using the Thai, Lanna, New Tai Lue, Lao and Tai Dam scripts.

Some words differ only as a result of the regular tone correspondences:
Other tone differences are unpredictable, such as:

Some words differ in a single sound and associated tone. In many words, the initial ร (/r/) in Standard Thai corresponds to ฮ (/h/) in Northern Thai:
==== Aspiration of initial consonants ====
Some aspirated consonants in the low-class consonant group (อักษรต่ำ /ʔàk.sɔ̌ːn.tàm/) in Standard Thai correspond to unaspirated sounds in Northern Thai. These sounds include ค, ช, ท, and พ (/kʰ/, /tɕʰ/, /tʰ/, and /pʰ/ respectively), but sounds such as ฅ, คร, ฆ, ฒ, พร, ภ (/kʰ/, /kʰr/, /kʰ/, /tʰ/, /pʰr/, and /pʰ/ respectively) remain aspirated. Such aspirated consonants that are unaspirated in Northern Thai correspond to unaspirated voiced sounds in Proto-Tai which are *ɡ, *ɟ, *d, and *b (ค, ช, ท, and พ respectively).:

But not:

Though a number of aspirated consonants in Standard Thai often correspond to unaspirated sounds in Northern Thai, when an unaspirated consonant is followed by ร (/r/) the unaspirated consonant becomes aspirated:

<text>Vaporization (or vapo(u)risation) of an element or compound is a phase transition from the liquid phase to vapor. There are two types of vaporization: evaporation and boiling. Evaporation is a surface phenomenon, whereas boiling is a bulk phenomenon (a phenomenon in which the whole object or substance is involved in the process).

==Evaporation==

Evaporation is a phase transition from the liquid phase to vapor (a state of substance below critical temperature) that occurs at temperatures below the boiling temperature at a given pressure. Evaporation occurs &quot;on the surface&quot;. Evaporation only occurs when the partial pressure of vapor of a substance is less than the equilibrium vapor pressure. For example, due to constantly decreasing pressures, vapor pumped out of a solution will eventually leave behind a cryogenic liquid.

==Boiling==
Boiling is also a phase transition from the liquid phase to gas phase, but boiling is the formation of vapor as bubbles of vapor &quot;below the surface&quot; of the liquid. Boiling occurs when the equilibrium vapor pressure of the substance is greater than or equal to the atmospheric pressure. The temperature at which boiling occurs is the boiling temperature, or boiling point. The boiling point varies with the pressure of the environment.

==Sublimation==
Sublimation is a direct phase transition from the solid phase to the gas phase, skipping the intermediate liquid phase.

==Other uses of the term &#x27;vaporization&#x27;==
The term &quot;vaporization&quot; has also been used in a colloquial or hyperbolic way to refer to the physical destruction of an object that is exposed to intense heat or explosive force, where the object is actually blasted into small pieces rather than literally converted to gaseous form. Examples of this usage include the &quot;vaporization&quot; of the uninhabited Marshall Island of Elugelab in the 1952 &quot;Ivy Mike&quot; thermonuclear test. Many other examples can be found throughout the various MythBusters episodes that have involved explosives, chief among them being Cement Mix-Up, where they &quot;vaporized&quot; a cement truck with ANFO.

At the moment of a large enough meteor or comet impact, bolide detonation, a nuclear fission, thermonuclear fusion, or theoretical antimatter weapon detonation, a flux of so many gamma ray, x-ray, ultraviolet, visual light and heat photons strikes matter in a such brief amount of time (a great number of high-energy photons, many overlapping in the same physical space) that all molecules lose their atomic bonds and &quot;fly apart&quot;. All atoms lose their electron shells and become positively charged ions, in turn emitting photons of a slightly lower energy than they had absorbed. All such matter becomes a gas of nuclei and electrons which rise into the air due to the extremely high temperature or bond to each other as they cool. The matter vaporized this way is immediately a plasma in a state of maximum entropy and this state steadily reduces via the factor of passing time due to natural processes in the biosphere and the effects of physics at normal temperatures and pressures.

A similar process occurs during ultrashort pulse laser ablation, where the high flux of incoming electromagnetic radiation strips the target material&#x27;s surface of electrons, leaving positively charged atoms which undergo a coulomb explosion.

<text>Muang Phuan (, ; ; ; Country of Phuan) or Xieng Khouang (, ; ), also known historically to the Vietnamese as Trấn Ninh (chữ Hán: 鎮寧; lit. &quot;securement of peace&quot;), was a historical principality on the Xiang Khouang Plateau, which constitutes the modern territory of Xiangkhouang Province, Laos.

==Background==
The Xiang Khouang Plateau is semi-arid but has important iron ore resources and has been inhabited since the Bronze Age (the Plain of Jars is an important UNESCO archeological site). The region is an important area for trade as it occupies the major passes along the Annamite Cordillera to access Vietnam and the coast.

==History==
The Tai Phuan or Phuan people are a Theravada Buddhist Tai-Lao ethnic group that migrated to the area that is now Laos during the 13th century. According to legend, the Phuan people were led by Chet Chuong, the second son of Khun Borom who founded the city-state of Muang Phuan. In the mid-14th century Muang Phuan was incorporated into the Lan Xang Kingdom under King Fa Ngum. Under the Mandala model, cities or even kingdoms would enter into tributary relationships with their neighbors depending on regional power; in exchange the tribute would maintain local autonomy. It was not uncommon to pay tribute to more than one power even concurrently. In 1434, Muang Phuan entered into a tributary relationship with the Dai Viet. However, by 1478 the Dai Viet attempted to annex Muang Phuan as a prefecture, which contributed to war between Lan Xang and the Dai Viet. The Dai Viet army ultimately withdrew during that conflict, and Muang Phuan returned as a tributary to Lan Xang. However, the peace was short-lived and by 1531 Muang Phuan rebelled against King Photisarath who put down the rebellion after two years. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, Muang Phuan remained part of Lan Xang.

During the 16th century, expressive Buddhist art and architecture flourished. The capital was dotted with temples in a distinct Xieng Khouang style, i.e., simple low roofs with a characteristic ‘waist’ at the foundation. In 1930, Le Boulanger described it as ‘a large and beautiful city protected by wide moats and forts occupying the surrounding hills and the opulence of the sixty-two pagodas and their stupas, of which the flanks concealed treasures, obtained the capital a fame that spread fear wide and far.” In 1707 when Lan Xang was divided between the Kingdoms of Vientiane and Luang Prabang, Muang Phuan entered into tributary relations with the Kingdom of Luang Prabang.
By the 1720s Muang Phuan was supporting the Kingdom of Luang Prabang in wars against the Burmese, and Siamese. Under Chao Kham Sattha again, Muang Phuan went to war against the Governor of Thakhek, a tributary to the Kingdom of Vientiane. In 1751 Chao Ong Lo went so far as to directly attack the Kingdom of Vientiane and was totally defeated, retreating to Houa Phan (today Sam Neua) where he began to raise another army. The Kingdom of Vientiane named Chao Ong Lo&#x27;s brother Ong Bun as regional governor of Muang Phuan. The armies of Muang Phuan split between the brothers in civil war, and ultimately Chao Ong Lo prevailed. However, the conflict drained the region so much so that for the next 37 years Muang Phuan remained a tributary to Vientiane.

In 1779 the Kingdom of Vientiane was captured by the Siamese led by General Taksin, Muang Phuan as a tributary of Vientiane became a Siamese vassal state while maintaining tributary relations with Dai Viet. Siam was severely depopulated from the history of warfare with the Burmese in the 18th century, and the destruction of Ayutthaya in 1767. To exert greater control of the lands and people of Muang Phuan, the Siamese launched the first of several forced migration campaigns to resettle large parts of the Phuan population to regions under firm Siamese control. Chao Somphou, the son of Chao Ong Lo, set about restoring and rebuilding the temples and defenses of Muang Phuan. According to some accounts, his palace grew to rival that of the King of Vientiane. In 1789 or 1790, King Nanthasen of Vientiane believed rebellion was possible and sent an army to capture Muang Phuan. Chao Somphou fled to Houaphanh, King Nanthasen continued north to capture Luang Prabang in 1792. In 1793 Chao Somphou was captured by King Nanthasen and imprisoned in Vientiane. Muang Phuan appealed to the Dai Viet, and a combined force of 6,000 Phuan and Vietnamese crossed into Xiengkhouang and began to march toward Vientiane. King Nanthasen, not wanting to create a wider conflict, negotiated an arrangement where Muang Phuan would pay equal tribute to the Kingdoms of Vientiane and the Dai Viet in exchange for the release of Chao Somphou. Chao Somphou returned to Muang Phuan where he began another building campaign. By 1800, King Inthavong of Vientiane feared a resurgence of power in Muang Phuan, and sent his brother Chao Anouvong to capture Chao Somphou. Chao Somphou died as a prisoner in Vientiane around 1803.

Chao Somphou&#x27;s nephew Chao Noy took control of Muang Phuan in 1803. He was an authoritarian ruler who increased taxes to augment his palace and the military. In 1814, he violently suppressed a Khmu rebellion. In 1823, he was accused by a half-brother of seeking independence, and was summoned to Vientiane under the guise of answering for his actions during 1814. King Inthavong imprisoned Chao Noy for three years. On the death of his brother King Anouvong of Vientiane, allowed Chao Noy to return to Muang Phuan where he sought a tributary relationship with the Dai Viet Emperor Minh Mang. Whether Anouvong&#x27;s actions were part of a wider plot to rebel against the Siamese is controversial, what is clear is that ultimately Anouvong did rebel and sought to draw all the Lao lands together in opposition to Siam. The Lao rebellion of 1826–1828 ultimately failed, and Chao Noy handed over the fleeing King Anouvong to the Siamese. As King Anouvong was also a tributary to the Dai Viet, Emperor Minh Mang summoned Chao Noy in 1831 and had him executed for having acted without consultation.

In 1832 the Dai Viet annexed Muang Phuan and named the region &quot;Tran Ninh&quot; meaning “To Keep the Peace” and imposed Vietnamese taxes, culture and dress on the population. Under the guise of protecting the Tai peoples in Muang Phuan, a Siamese garrison of 1,000 invaded and killed the Vietnamese officials. The Thais then began a second population transfer, moving several thousand Muang Phuan. Several hundred tried to escape and return to Muang Phuan but were caught by the Vietnamese and committed suicide. Disease and harsh treatment killed a number of the families that stayed with the Siamese, and left only around a thousand to be resettled around Bangkok. In late 1831, Siam and Vietnam had a series of wars (Siamese-Vietnamese War 1831–1834, and Siamese-Vietnamese War 1841–1845) over control of Cambodia, and the Xieng Khouang region came under heavy Vietnamese presence. During this period, Chao Po (son of Chao Noy) was allowed to return to Muang Phuan. In the 1850s Siam agitated a rebellion against the Vietnamese, and Muang Phuan came under Siamese suzerainty.

Beginning in the 1840s the Chinese sought to expand their military control and tax system over the hill peoples in southern China. Lao Sung people including the Hmong and Meo began to move into the mountainous uplands of Xieng khouang. The migration of these first peoples was relatively peaceful, as the peoples preferred to maintain their own communities in the upland territories which were not farmed by the Lao Theung or Lao Loum in the area. By the 1860s, the failed Taiping Rebellion in China created a flood of new refugees along with marauders organized into gangs identified by the design of their flags including the Red, Yellow, Black and Striped. The gangs looted, burned, and warred in the areas of northern Laos and Xieng Khouang. The capital of Muang Phuan was looted and destroyed repeatedly by warring bands of Haw or Ho pirates. Due to the instability, the Siamese conducted a series of military campaigns known as the Haw Wars in the region. The Siamese were unsuccessful at restoring order, and used the opportunity for more forced population transfers in 1875–1876. These deportations were recorded by a British observer in 1876.


The instability caused by the Haw engulfed the territories of Tonkin and Annam, which were possessed by the French in the 1880s. The French were aware that Siamese control of territory was weak. In 1889, Auguste Pavie produced letters from King Mantha Tourath of Luang Prabang seeking vassalage with Emperor Minh Mang from the period of the 1830s, and presented them to Bangkok as evidence for the French right to extend a protectorate to Xieng Khouang and Luang Prabang. Under the terms of the Franco-Siamese Treaty of 1893, Muang Phuan came under French colonial protection. In 1899, the Phuan regions lost autonomy and became part of the French Protectorate of Laos in French Indochina.

<doc id="204766" wikidata="Q313596" url="?curid=204766" title="Leslie Cheung">
<text>Leslie Cheung Kwok-wing (born Cheung Fat-chung; 12 September 1956 – 1 April 2003) was a Hong Kong singer and actor. One of the most influential cultural icons in the Chinese world, Cheung was known for his debonair demeanor, flamboyant screen characters, and avant-garde, androgynous stage presence. Throughout his 26-year career, he released over 40 music albums and acted in 56 films.

Born in Kowloon, British Hong Kong, Cheung studied in England since the age of 12 until he returned home in 1976. He garnered attention in 1977 when entering RTV&#x27;s &quot;Asian Singing Contest&quot; and achieved popularity in 1984 with a hit single &quot;Monica.&quot; Cheung is regarded as one of the founding fathers of Cantopop for defining the music genre in the 1980s. He announced his &quot;retirement&quot; from music in 1989 and emigrated to Canada the following year, but returned to Hong Kong in 1994. His reemergence from the musical retirement in the late 1990s, particularly in his 1996 album &quot;Red&quot;, was marked by sonic experimentation and daring imagery.

In addition to music, Cheung achieved pan-Asian fame with such films as &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; (1986) and &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; (1987). He won the Best Actor at the 1991 Hong Kong Film Awards for his role in &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; (1990), and became world-renowned for his performances in &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; (1993) and &quot;Happy Together&quot; (1997).

On 1 April 2003, Cheung, suffering from clinical depression, committed suicide by jumping off the 24th floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel, Hong Kong.

==Early life==
Cheung was born in Kowloon, British Hong Kong, the youngest of 10 children in a middle-class Hakka family. His father, Cheung Wut-hoi, was a well-known tailor who specialised in suits, whose customers included Western celebrities such as film director Alfred Hitchcock and actors Marlon Brando and Cary Grant. Despite his father&#x27;s reputation in the fashion industry, Cheung was uninspired by the profession. Cheung told many interviewers that he had an unhappy childhood, feeling emotionally estranged from his father and siblings, and frequently witnessing arguments and fights in the household. He felt &quot;depressed sometimes&quot; and longed for affection from his parents who were absent most of the time in his childhood. His father&#x27;s abusive treatment of his mother had a lasting effect on Cheung&#x27;s perspectives on marriage. When Cheung&#x27;s father married another woman, his emotional life further deteriorated. He was brought up by his grandmother, whom he was very close to. Cheung summed up his upbringing as a &quot;silent resentment&quot; with &quot;nothing worth remembering&quot;, except for the death of his grandmother when he was in primary school, which was the &quot;one thing that I do remember about my childhood.&quot;

Cheung attended Rosaryhill School for secondary education in Hong Kong and, at age 12, enrolled at an independent boys boarding school Eccles Hall School Quideham near Norwich in England. During his time at Rosaryhill, Cheung did poorly academically, except that he excelled in the English language. He discovered a newfound interest in Western films and immersed himself in music, studying the original soundtrack of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. He recalled that there were &quot;racial problems&quot; when he was in England, but he managed to make friends. During weekends, he worked as a bartender and sometimes did amateur singing at his relatives&#x27; restaurant in Southend-on-Sea. He came across the film &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and chose Leslie as his English name inspired by the actor Leslie Howard, feeling that &quot;The name can be a man&#x27;s or woman&#x27;s, it&#x27;s very unisex.&quot;

Cheung attended the University of Leeds, where he studied textile management. After one year of study, in 1976, he returned to Hong Kong when his father became paralysed on one side of the body after a stroke. As the father wanted all of his children to be at home, Cheung abandoned his study and became a salesman for Levi&#x27;s for a living. Cheung recalled that during this time, &quot;I had no plans; there I was, feeling like I was hanging in the middle of nowhere.&quot;

==Career==
===Beginnings===
Upon returning to Hong Kong Cheung went back to high school as a mature student and formed a band, in which he was the lead singer with his classmates. In May 1977, the band members signed up individually for RTV&#x27;s Asian Singing Contest. Only Cheung remained until the final round of the Hong Kong division, where he finished as the first runner-up with a rendition of &quot;American Pie&quot;. He proceeded to the pan-Asian division, finishing fifth. Soon after the competition, RTV offered Cheung a three-year contract as a second-rate actor for RTV. He also signed with Polydor Records with hopes of releasing music albums.

Cheung&#x27;s career in show business did not take off immediately. His first film role was in &quot;Erotic Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; (, 1978), a softcore porn production that features his bare buttocks. His first two albums were solely recorded in English, and his third album, &quot;Lover&#x27;s Arrow&quot; (, 1979) was recorded in Cantonese. The albums failed commercially, and critics lambasted Cheung&#x27;s voice as &quot;chicken-like&quot;. Cheung&#x27;s first public performance at the 1977 Hong Kong Pop Folk Music Festival was booed off the stage by the audience. He described his early days into show business as &quot;full of uncertainty ... I remember well that my singing career at the early stage was like &#x27;a person running into a rock&#x27;, full of despair and obstacles.&quot; Seeing little potential in Cheung, Polydor allowed him to depart on his own terms.

===1982–1989: Cantopop success and film crossover===
Cheung signed with Capital Artists, a record label closely associated with the then-dominant television network TVB, in 1982. His first hit single, &quot;The Wind Blows On&quot; (), is a cover version of Momoe Yamaguchi&#x27;s Japanese single &quot;The Other Side of Goodbye&quot; . The song was successful on charts, revitalising Cheung&#x27;s image as a Cantopop singer. The titular album was Cheung&#x27;s first to be certified gold by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) Hong Kong. His second album with Capital, &quot;Craziness&quot; (), is a compilation of songs he recorded for TVB dramas. The album was also a success, receiving a gold certification from the IFPI Hong Kong. He continued his movie crossover with roles mostly in teenage films, and earned his first major recognition for starring in &quot;Nomad&quot; (1982). While Cheung had already been a well-known actor with likeable personae in TVB productions, his role as a disillusioned teenager in &quot;Nomad&quot; foresaw his future reputation as an icon of rebel. The role garnered Cheung a nomination for Best Actor at the 1983 Hong Kong Film Awards.

The year 1984 was when Cheung achieved mass stardom. He released the hit single &quot;Monica&quot;, a cover of the single by Japanese singer Kōji Kikkawa. The song topped charts in Hong Kong and was one of the 10 gold-certified songs honoured at TVB&#x27;s 1984 Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards and the 1984 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards. The song&#x27;s upbeat dance production introduced a new musical trend to Cantopop, in addition to the traditional sentimental ballads that had dominated the scene. Cheung&#x27;s 1984 self-titled album, which included &quot;Monica&quot;, was his first to be certified platinum by the IFPI Hong Kong and sold over 200,000 copies. He starred in the TVB drama &quot;Once Upon an Ordinary Girl&quot; (, 1984) and the film &quot;Behind the Yellow Line&quot; (1984). In the latter, he co-starred with actress Maggie Cheung and singer-actress Anita Mui. Both productions were commercially successful and put Cheung into the limelight as a prominent entertainer. As Cheung&#x27;s fame expanded, the media began to pit him against fellow singer-actor Alan Tam, as the two were the most successful male Cantopop singers at the moment. The publicised so-called rivalry contributed to Cantopop&#x27;s booming sales and lasted until the end of the 1980s.

Cheung&#x27;s next albums with Capital were met with similar success. &quot;For Your Heart Only&quot; (, 1985) yielded the hit single &quot;Wild Wind&quot; (), which was among the 10 gold-certified songs honoured at both TVB&#x27;s Jade Solid Gold and RTHK Top 10 awards. The album also included songs Cheung recorded for TVB dramas, propelling his image as a romantic male lead. His 1986 single &quot;Who Feels the Same?&quot; () won the Gold Song Gold Award, the distinction for the most popular song of the year, at TVB&#x27;s Jade Solid Gold Awards. With this achievement, Cheung became an arguably undisputed royalty of Cantopop. After the release of &quot;Who Feels the Same?&quot;, he left Capital and joined Cinepoly Records, under which his first album was &quot;Summer Romance&quot; (1987). The album was the best-selling Cantopop release of the year, earning seven times platinum certification from the IFPI Hong Kong and sold over 350,000 copies. Its lead single, &quot;Sleepless Night&quot; (), won the Gold Song Gold Award at the 1987 Jade Solid Gold Awards. The next two albums, &quot;Virgin Snow&quot; and &quot;Hot Summer&quot;, both were released in 1988 and sold well, receiving gold and platinum certifications from the IFPI Hong Kong.

A turning point in his burgeoning acting career came when he was cast in John Woo‘s action film &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; (1986), in which he played a youthful and impulsive police officer torn between justice and his criminal brother. The film, along with &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; (1987), propelled him to pan-Asian fame, especially in South Korea and Japan. He then starred opposite his real life friend Anita Mui in &quot;Rouge&quot; (1988), which consolidated the pair&#x27;s reputation as the top Hong Kong entertainers. Yiu-wai Chu, author of the book &quot;Hong Kong Cantopop: A Concise History&quot; (2017), noted that Cheung and Mui formed an &quot;unprecedented&quot; chemistry showcasing &quot;mystic power of charisma&quot;, not only in films but also on stage performances together.

Cheung embarked on a 23-date tour at the Hong Kong Coliseum in mid-1988, sponsored by Pepsi. The tour was a sold-out and accumulated over 250,000 spectators. He also held several shows catering to the Chinese community in North America, visiting Atlantic City, Calgary, Toronto, and Vancouver. In light of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and the upcoming handover of Hong Kong, many Hong Kongers emigrated to Western countries. Following suit, Cheung announced his &quot;retirement&quot; from singing and emigrated to Vancouver, Canada, in 1989. Prior to his retirement, Cheung released three further albums under Cinepoly—&quot;Leslie &#x27;89&quot;, &quot;Salute&quot;, &quot;Final Encounter&quot;—all of which received platinum certifications from the IFPI Hong Kong. He won Most Popular Male Artist twice, at the 1988 and 1989 Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards. His &quot;farewell concert tour&quot;, in support of the album &quot;Final Encounter&quot;, ran for 33 consecutive sold-out shows at the Hong Kong Coliseum. Cheung donated profits of his 1989 album &quot;Salute&quot; to the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, which was named the Leslie Cheung Memorial Scholarship after his death.

===1990–1995: Music hiatus and major film roles===

After giving up singing, Cheung focused on his film career. He won the Best Actor at the 1991 Hong Kong Film Awards for his role in Wong Kar-Wai&#x27;s &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot; (1990). He gained international acclaim for his role as a cross-dressing Peking opera actor in &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; (1993), which became the first Chinese film to win the Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes. According to Chen Kaige and Lu Wei, director and scriptwriter of the film, respectively, Cheung lost Best Actor by one vote because a Cannes jury member mistook Cheung for a woman and voted him for Best Actress.

Although Cheung quit his singing career from 1989 to 1995, he composed more than ten songs during that time. In 1993, he won &quot;Best Original Movie Song Award&quot; from Golden Horse Film Festival for the theme song &quot;Red Cheek, White Hair&quot; for &quot;The Bride with White Hair&quot; (as a film score composer). In 1995, he wrote all three theme songs for the film &quot;The Phantom Lover&quot; (1995). As for songwriting, Cheung won four nominations for &quot;Best Original Movie Song Award&quot; at the Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards and two nominations for &quot;Best Original Film Song&quot; at the Hong Kong Film Awards.

===1995–2003: Return to music and &quot;Passion Tour&quot;===

In 1995 Cheung signed a contract with Rock Records. The same year he released his comeback album, &quot;Beloved,&quot; winning the award of IFPI Best Selling Album. Since his 1996 album &quot;Red&quot;, Cheung started a full-on collaboration with composer C. Y. Kong and lyricist Lin Xi, embracing a daring, self-reflective, and sexually ambiguous style of expression. Cheung&#x27;s 1999 song &quot;Left and Right Hand&quot; (左右手) suggests at his sexuality and his 2000 song &quot;I&quot; (我), with two versions of lyrics in Mandarin and Cantonese by Lin Xi, is known as his come-out song. In 2001, Cheung directed the music video for his song &quot;Bewildered&quot; (夢到內河) with the help of William Chang, the production designer of &quot;The Days of Being Wild&quot;. The video, featuring intimacy between Japanese ballet dancer Nishijima Kazuhiro and Cheung, was banned by Hong Kong&#x27;s public broadcaster TVB for promoting homosexuality; Cheung refused to edit the scenes out.

Cheung was consecutively nominated for Best Actor at Cannes for Chen Kaige&#x27;s &quot;Temptress Moon&quot; (1996) and Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s &quot;Happy Together&quot; (1997). In 1998, he was a member of the jury at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival. Cheung&#x27;s last concert tour, &quot;Passion Tour&quot;, took place in Hong Kong and overseas from 2000 to 2001. He collaborated with fashion designer Jean Paul Gaultier, who transformed Cheung &quot;From Angel to Devil&quot; in four costumes: the Angel, the Pretty Boy, the Latin Lover, and the Devil – denoting cross-cultural drag and focusing on Cheung&#x27;s androgyny and bisexuality. The &quot;Passion Tour&quot; broke attendance records throughout Asia, including a record for the first foreign artist to hold 16 concerts in Japan. Although the concert was acclaimed in Japan, Korea, and Canada, it was panned in Hong Kong mainly for his gender-crossing. Both Cheung and his agent Florence Chen attributed his later depression to the hostile reception from the Hong Kong media about the tour. In 2011, CCTV-15 commented that the &quot;Passion Tour&quot; represented the highest standard of Chinese concerts in performance, art concept, costume props and audience response, and had never been surpassed.

===Philanthropy===
Cheung was a supporter of several charities concerning children&#x27;s welfare. He was a patron of the Children&#x27;s Cancer Foundation, a charity that cares for young children with cancer and their families. Cheung donated HK$1 million (US$128,000) in 1996 and launched five sets of RED cards to help raise funds for the Children&#x27;s Cancer Foundation. He was the first Cantopop star to launch a charity fundraising at a concert. In 1996, although he rarely sang in public at that time, he sang three theme songs from his films to raise money for the elderly. For his 1997 concert at the HK Coliseum, Cheung set up a collection booth for the RED Card charity. Donations of HK$100 or above could obtain a set of cards. Cheung said, &quot;I will lead the way, so I donated HK$1,000,000 to Hong Kong children&#x27;s cancer fund in my own name.&quot; The concert raised more than HK$800,000, to which Cheung and his friends added more than HK$100,000, and made up a million Hong Kong dollars to donate to the cancer fund. He was also a patron of the End Child Sexual Abuse Foundation (ECSAF) (護苗基金), founded by veteran actress Josephine Siao ().

In 1999, at a party to raise relief funds in the aftermath of the Taiwan earthquake, Cheung participated in a fried rice tasting event. He donated HK$250,000 for a bowl of rice; this was matched by fan donations, bringing the total to HK$500,000. In 2000, Sun Entertainment opened the &quot;Star Second-hand Shop&quot;, where second-hand goods donated by celebrities were auctioned to raise money for the &quot;Sun Love Fund&quot;. Leslie Cheung was known for his very good fashion sense and he was the first to donate three well-loved, carefully selected pieces to the auction. Leslie also donated his beloved badminton racket to IDclub Taiwan, to be auctioned to raise money for the children&#x27;s cancer fund. In 1999 and 2000, he appeared in TVB charity shows to help raise funds for ECSAF, in which he was appointed a goodwill ambassador in 2002. In 2003, Cheung donated HK$100,000 to the Seedling protection fund, who were holding a large-scale charity night on 12 March. He told his party guests to give him cash instead of presents, then he donated all of the money that he received to the fund.

==Personal life==

In 1977, during the filming of the RTV series &quot;Love Story&quot;, the then 20-year-old Cheung met and fell in love with his 17-year-old co-star, Teresa Mo (毛舜筠), and they began dating after finishing the series. In 1979, Cheung proposed to Mo, but his sudden proposal startled her and she began to distance herself from him. Although Cheung and Mo eventually broke up after the proposal and briefly lost contact, they remained close friends after they had reunited for the 1992 film &quot;All&#x27;s Well, Ends Well&quot;.

Cheung later went into a brief relationship with actress (雪梨), the younger sister of Michelle Yim, but they broke up in 1980, due to their incompatibility for each other&#x27;s lifestyles. Cheung and Ngai Sze-pui (), a Hong Kong model and actress whom he met on the set of ATV series &quot;Agency 24&quot;, were in a relationship for two years from 1981 to 1983. In 1984, at the house of Albert Yeung, Cheung met Cindy Yeung (楊諾詩), the youngest daughter of Albert Yeung who had recently returned from Boston. Yeung was also a fan of Cheung and was seven years younger than him. They went out on several dates until Yeung returned to Boston. They continued their relationship through phone calls and letters, but would part ways in the following year, still remaining good friends. Cheung felt that if he had not been in show business, he could have already been married with children, like most of his friends.

Cheung and Daffy Tong Hok-tak (唐鶴德), godson of Cheung&#x27;s mother, knew each other since childhood. During his concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum in 1997, Cheung sang the love song “The Moon Represents My Heart” (月亮代表我的心) and dedicated it to his mother and Tong. This moment is seen as an official recognition of Cheung&#x27;s relationship with Tong, making him one of the first public figures in the Chinese world to come out.

In an interview in 1992, Cheung stated that &quot;My mind is bisexual. It&#x27;s easy for me to love a woman. It&#x27;s also easy for me to love a man, too&quot; and &quot;I believe that a good actor would be androgynous, and ever changing.&quot; In 2000, Cheung talked about his love life: &quot;In terms of lovers, I think I can be a better friend than a lover. Because I am a workaholic. To share my romance, that person has to compromise something.&quot; In a 2001 interview with &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Cheung said: &quot;It&#x27;s more appropriate to say I&#x27;m bisexual. I&#x27;ve had girlfriends. When I was 22 or so, I asked my girlfriend Teresa Mo to marry me.&quot;

==Death and legacy==

Cheung died by suicide on 1 April 2003 at 6:43 pm (HKT). He leapt from the 24th floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel, located in the Central district of Hong Kong Island. He left a suicide note saying that he had been suffering from depression.

After the jumping, an informant told police, &quot;someone fainted on the roadside&quot;, so only ambulances arrived at the scene and did not attract a large number of reporters; thus there were no photos of the scene.

The news of Cheung&#x27;s death shocked the Chinese community worldwide. The day after Cheung&#x27;s death, his partner Daffy Tong confirmed that Cheung had been suffering from clinical depression and had been seeing Professor Felice Lieh Mak for treatment for almost a year. He also revealed that Cheung had previously attempted suicide in November 2002.

Despite the epidemic of SARS and the WHO&#x27;s warning on travelling to Hong Kong, tens of thousands attended Cheung&#x27;s memorial service on 7 April 2003, including celebrities and fans from mainland China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia, the United States, and Canada. Cheung&#x27;s funeral was held on 8 April 2003. Three of Cheung&#x27;s friends, director Tsui Hark, lyricist James Wong, and singer Jacky Cheung, delivered eulogies. Tsui Hark, Jacky Cheung, Stanley Kwan, Eddie Lau, Tony Leung Ka-Fai, Lin Xi, Lau Chun-Ho, and Law Kin-Kei served as pallbearers. Cheung was buried in Po Fook Hill, Shatin. His final album, &quot;Everything Follows the Wind&quot; (), was released three months after his death.

Taiwanese writer Li Ao said in a 2003 TV program that Cheung died by suicide due to AIDS, but the accuracy of this statement has been questioned. In a 2012 interview, Cheung&#x27;s eldest sister, Ophelia, stated Cheung was diagnosed with clinical depression caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. She mentioned that reporters were frequently found outside her brother&#x27;s home, hampering his ability to visit his doctor. Thus, he would come over to her house to consult with his doctor. He would ask his sister, &quot;Why am I depressed? I have money and so many people love me.&quot; He was reluctant to take medication for his depression.

Many memorial events were held over the years since Cheung&#x27;s death, including the memorial concerts in 2003, 2008, 2013, and 2023 organized by Cheung&#x27;s agent Florence Chan. In 2010, he was voted in a CNN poll as the third most iconic musician of all time, after Michael Jackson and The Beatles. In 2013, Cheung became the first contemporary celebrity to be included in &quot;the Cihai&quot;. The same year, Cheung&#x27;s fans set a Guinness World Record in 2013 for the largest origami crane exhibition by creating 1,956,921 origami cranes, a tribute to his birth date. In 2018, 55383 Cheungkwokwing, a main-belt asteroid discovered by Bill Yeung at the Desert Eagle Observatory in 2003, was named in memory of Cheung.

The proliferation of memorial events has attracted scrutiny and doubts over commercialization and opacity of revenues. Cheung&#x27;s agent Florence Chan faced criticism in 2013 for her much-hyped revelation of an important secret about Cheung at the year&#x27;s memorial concert, which turned out to be a dream she had about Cheung telling her he could finally rest. Chinese writer Han Songluo commented then: &quot;In the ten years of commemorating Leslie Cheung, what we observe is an exhaustive Leslie Cheung Commemorating Contest, where the focus is not on commemoration but on novelty. It must feature new information, new developments, and new perspectives.&quot; In 2023, concerns about overexploitation were raised again when two memorial concerts, organized by Chan and Universal Music, Cheung&#x27;s agent and label respectively, took place on the same day of April 1 in Hong Kong, featuring separate groups of celebrities covering his songs.

<doc id="204768" wikidata="Q270791" url="?curid=204768" title="State-owned enterprise">
<text>A state-owned enterprise (SOE) is a business entity created or owned by a national or local government, either through an executive order or legislation. SOEs aim to generate profit for the government, prevent private sector monopolies, provide goods at lower prices, implement government policies, or serve remote areas where private businesses are scarce. The government typically holds full or majority ownership and oversees operations. SOEs have a distinct legal structure, with financial and developmental goals, like making services more accessible while earning profit (such as a state railway). They can be considered as government-affiliated entities designed to meet commercial and state capitalist objectives.

== Terminology ==

The terminology around the term state-owned enterprise is murky. All three words in the term are challenged and subject to interpretation. First, it is debatable what the term &quot;state&quot; implies (e.g., it is unclear whether municipally owned corporations and enterprises held by regional public bodies are considered state-owned). Next, it is contestable under what circumstances a SOE qualifies as &quot;owned&quot; by a state (SOEs can be fully owned or partially owned; it is difficult to determine categorically what level of state ownership would qualify an entity to be considered as state-owned since governments can also own regular stock, without implying any special interference). Finally, the term &quot;enterprise&quot; is challenged, as it implies statutes in private law which may not always be present, and so the term &quot;corporations&quot; is frequently used instead.

Thus, SOEs are known under many other terms: state-owned company, state-owned entity, state enterprise, publicly owned corporation, government business enterprise, government-owned company, government controlled company, government controlled enterprise, government-owned corporation, government-sponsored enterprise, commercial government agency, state-privatised industry public sector undertaking, or parastatal, among others. In some Commonwealth realms, ownership by The Crown is highlighted in the predominant local terminology, with SOEs in Canada referred to as a &quot;Crown corporation&quot;, and in New Zealand as a &quot;Crown entity&quot;.

The term &quot;government-linked company&quot; (GLC) is sometimes used, for example in Malaysia, to refer to private or public (listed on a stock exchange) corporate entities in which the government acquires a stake using a holding company. The two main definitions of GLCs are dependent on the proportion of the corporate entity a government owns. One definition purports that a company is classified as a GLC if a government owns an effective controlling interest (more than 50%), while the second definition suggests that any corporate entity that has a government as a shareholder is a GLC.

The act of turning a part of government bureaucracy into a SOE is called corporatization.

== Economic theory ==
In economic theory, the question of whether a firm should be owned by the state or by the private sector is studied in the theory of incomplete contracts developed by Oliver Hart and his co-authors. In a world in which complete contracts were feasible, ownership would not matter because the same incentive structure that prevails under one ownership structure could be replicated under the other ownership structure. Hart, Shleifer, and Vishny (1997) have developed the leading application of the incomplete contract theory to the issue of state-owned enterprises. These authors compare a situation in which the government is in control of a firm to a situation in which a private manager is in control. The manager can invest to come up with cost-reducing and quality-enhancing innovations. The government and the manager bargain over the implementation of the innovations. If the negotiations fail, the owner can decide about the implementation. It turns out that when cost-reducing innovations do not harm quality significantly, then private firms are to be preferred. Yet, when cost-reductions may strongly reduce quality, state-owned enterprises are superior. Hoppe and Schmitz (2010) have extended this theory in order to allow for a richer set of governance structures, including different forms of public-private partnerships.

== Use ==
=== Economic reasons ===
==== Natural monopolies ====
SOEs are common with natural monopolies, because they allow capturing economies of scale while they can simultaneously achieve a public objective. For that reason, SOEs primarily operate in the domain of infrastructure (e.g., railway companies), strategic goods and services (e.g., postal services, arms manufacturing and procurement), natural resources and energy (e.g., nuclear facilities, alternative energy delivery), politically sensitive business, broadcasting, banking, demerit goods (e.g., alcoholic beverages), and merit goods (healthcare).

==== Infant industries ====
SOEs can also help foster industries that are &quot;considered economically desirable and that would otherwise not be developed through private investments&quot;. When nascent or &#x27;infant&#x27; industries have difficulty getting investments from the private sector (perhaps because the good that is being produced requires very risky investments, when patenting is difficult, or when spillover effects exist), the government can help these industries get on the market with positive economic effects. However, the government cannot necessarily predict which industries would qualify as such &#x27;infant industries&#x27;, and so the extent to which this is a viable argument for SOEs is debated.

=== Political reasons ===
SOEs are also frequently employed in areas where the government wants to levy user fees, but finds it politically difficult to introduce new taxation. Next, SOEs can be used to improve efficiency of public service delivery or as a step towards (partial) privatization or hybridization. SOEs can also be a means to alleviate fiscal stress, as SOEs may not count towards states&#x27; budgets.

== Effects ==
=== Compared to government bureaucracy ===
Compared to government bureaucracy, state owned enterprises might be beneficial because they reduce politicians&#x27; influence over the service. Conversely, they might be detrimental because they reduce oversight and increase transaction costs (such as monitoring costs, i.e., it is more difficult and costly to govern and regulate an autonomous SOE than it is the public bureaucracy). Evidence suggests that existing SOEs are typically more efficient than government bureaucracy, but that this benefit diminishes as services get more technical and have less overt public objectives.

=== Compared to regular enterprises ===
Compared to a regular enterprise, state-owned enterprises are typically expected to be less efficient due to political interference, but unlike profit-driven enterprises they are more likely to focus on government objectives.

== Around the world ==
=== Asia ===
==== OPEC countries ====
In most OPEC countries, the governments own the oil companies operating on their soil. A notable example is the Saudi Arabian national oil company, Saudi Aramco, which the Saudi government bought in 1988, changing its name from Arabian American Oil Company to Saudi Arabian Oil Company. The Saudi government also owns and operates Saudi Arabian Airlines, and owns 70% of SABIC as well as many other companies.

==== China ====
China&#x27;s state-owned enterprises are owned and managed by the State-owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC). China&#x27;s state-owned enterprises generally own and operate public services, resource extraction or defense. , China has more SOEs than any other country, and the most SOEs among large national companies.

China&#x27;s SOEs perform functions such as: contributing to central and local governments revenues through dividends and taxes, supporting urban employment, keeping key input prices low, channeling capital towards targeted industries and technologies, supporting sub-national redistribution to poorer interior and western provinces, and aiding the state&#x27;s response to natural disasters, financial crises and social instability.

China&#x27;s SOEs are at the forefront of global seaport-building, and most new ports constructed by them are done within the auspices of the Belt and Road Initiative.

==== India ====

In India, government enterprises exist in the form of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs).

==== Japan ====
During the Meiji era, Japan developed modern industry through direct state intervention. Government-owned enterprises were important to the development of key economic sectors like railways.

After Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931 and occupied the region, Japan took over Chinese public enterprises in Manchuria (many of which originated from the Zhang Zuolin and Zhang Xueliang regimes) and converted them to state-owned enterprises of the Japanese puppet-state of Manchukuo.

==== Malaysia ====
The Malaysian government launched a GLC Transformation Programme for its linked companies and linked investment companies (&quot;GLICs&quot;) on 29 July 2005, aiming over a ten-year period to transform these businesses &quot;into high-performing entities&quot;. The Putrajaya Committee on GLC High Performance (&quot;PCG&quot;), which oversaw this programme, was chaired by the Prime Minister, and membership included the Minister of Finance II, the Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department in charge of the Economic Planning Unit, the Chief Secretary to the Government, Secretary General of Treasury and the heads of each of the GLICs (the Employees Provident Fund, Khazanah Nasional Berhad, Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera (the armed forces pension fund), Lembaga Tabung Haji and Permodalan Nasional Berhad. Khazanah Nasional Berhad provided the secretariat to the PCG and managed the implementation of the programme, which was completed in 2015.

==== Oman====
==== Philippines ====

As of 2024, Philippines Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) was the most profitable state-owned enterprise in the Philippines. It is the third-largest contributor to government revenues, following taxes and customs.

=== Africa ===
==== Ethiopia ====

As of at least 2024, an Ethiopian SOE is Africa&#x27;s largest and most profitable airline, as well as Ethiopia&#x27;s largest earner of foreign exchange.

=== Europe ===

In Eastern Europe and Western Europe, there was a massive nationalization throughout the 20th century, especially after World War II. In the Eastern Bloc, countries adopted very similar policies and models to the USSR. Governments in Western Europe, both left and right of centre, saw state intervention as necessary to rebuild economies shattered by war. Government control over natural monopolies like industry was the norm. Typical sectors included telephones, electric power, fossil fuels, iron ore, railways, airlines, media, postal services, banks, and water. Many large industrial corporations were also nationalized or created as government corporations, including, among many others: British Steel Corporation, Equinor, and Águas de Portugal.

, multiple European countries have dedicated ministries and agencies to manage their state-run enterprises, eg. the in France.

A state-run enterprise may operate differently from an ordinary limited liability corporation. For example, in Finland, state-run enterprises (&quot;liikelaitos&quot;) are governed by separate laws. Even though responsible for their own finances, they cannot be declared bankrupt; the state answers for the liabilities. Stocks of the corporation are not sold and loans have to be government-approved, as they are government liabilities.

==== Belarus ====
State-owned enterprises are a major component of the economy of Belarus. The Belarusian state-owned economy includes enterprises that are fully state-owned, as well as others which are joint-stock companies with partial ownership by the state. Employment in state-owned or state-controlled enterprises is approximately 70% of total employment. State-owned enterprises are thus a major factor behind Belarus&#x27;s high employment rate and a source of stable employment.

<text>Enrique Badía Romero (who signed his work simply Romero; 24 April 1930 – 15 February 2024) was a Spanish comics artist, best known to English-speaking audiences for his work on &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;. He was also the co-creator of the post-apocalyptic science fiction strip &quot;Axa&quot;, as well as a substantial body of work in his native Spain.

==Biography==
Romero&#x27;s career began at the age of 15 when he was taken on as an apprentice of the artist Emilio Freixas. After contributing to the publication &quot;Susy&quot; in 1949, he went on to produce artwork for several series under the signature &quot;Badia&quot;. He launched the magazine &quot;Alex&quot; in 1953 and two years later founded the publishing firm Ruiz Romero for which he produced the series &quot;Cromos&quot;, &quot;Hombres de Lucha&quot; and &quot;Historia de la Guerra&quot;.

Enrique Badía Romero often collaborated with his brother Jordi Badía Romero (1938–1984). He died on 15 February 2024, at the age of 93.

===&quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;===

Romero began his association with writer Peter O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; strip in 1970 when he was called in to finish the storyline &quot;The War-Lords of Phoenix&quot; due to artist Jim Holdaway&#x27;s unexpected death. Initially, Romero intentionally imitated Holdaway&#x27;s style in order to make the changeover less noticeable, but soon established his own take on the character of Modesty Blaise, portraying her in a more exotic and voluptuous style than Holdaway did. Romero drew the &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; strip until 1978, and while doing episodes of André Chéret&#x27;s &quot;Rahan&quot; for the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Pif gadget&quot; from 1976, and beginning in 1978, Romero collaborated with Donne Avenell to create the science fiction series &quot;Axa&quot; for the English tabloid newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot;.

In 1986 Romero returned to &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; and remained with the strip until O&#x27;Donnell retired in 2001. In 2002, Romero was commissioned to draw a graphic novel adaptation of the &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; short story &quot;The Dark Angels&quot;; this work was initially published exclusively in Scandinavia but was later reprinted in a special issue of &quot;Comics Revue&quot; in the United States. Romero&#x27;s entire run on the &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; strip is continually reprinted in an ongoing series of compilation volumes published by the UK company Titan Books since 2005, while &quot;Comics Revue&quot; in the USA has reprinted all of his post-1986 work on the strip.

In the 2000s and on, Romero worked on &quot;Durham Red&quot;, and other projects for the magazines &quot;2000 AD&quot; and &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot;, as Enric Romero, and in 2011 he drew for the Italian market some short stories of &quot;Djustine&quot;, the horror-western character created by Enrico Teodorani.

<text>Farewell My Concubine is a 1993 Chinese-Hong Kong epic historical drama film directed by Chen Kaige, starring Leslie Cheung, Gong Li and Zhang Fengyi. Adapted for the screen by Lu Wei, based on the novel by Lilian Lee, the film is set in politically tumultuous 20th-century China, from the early days of the Republic of China to the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution. It chronicles the troubled relationships between two lifelong friends, the Peking opera actors Cheng Dieyi (Cheung) and Duan Xiaolou (Zhang), and Xiaolou&#x27;s wife Juxian (Gong).

The film&#x27;s themes include identity confusion and blurred lines between real life and the stage, portrayed by the revered opera actor Dieyi, whose unrequited love for Xiaolou persists throughout. The film also addressed themes of political and societal disturbances in 20th-century China, which is typical of Chinese Fifth Generation cinema.

&quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; premiered on 1 January 1993, in Hong Kong. Upon release the film received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics, and jointly won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival, becoming the first Chinese-language film to achieve the honour. It won further accolades, including a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film and a BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and received two nominations at the 66th Academy Awards for Best Cinematography and Best Foreign Language Film.

A few weeks after its release in China, the politburo demanded changes to be made to the film due to unconventional depictions of traditional values and political decisions. While allowing a premiere in Beijing, the government objected to the representation of homosexuality, the suicide of a leading character, and a depiction of the turmoil of the 1960s.

The film was approved for further exhibition in September 1993, less than a year after its original release. Upon its re-release it became clear the Chinese censors had made numerous cuts, removing 14 minutes. Chinese officials felt that a re-release, as opposed to maintaining a full ban, would silence an ever-growing international backlash and also help their bid to host the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2000.

&quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; is considered one of the landmark films of the Fifth Generation movement that brought Chinese film directors to world attention. In 2005, the film was selected as one of the &quot;100 Best Films in Global History&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

==Plot==
A young boy, Douzi, is abandoned by his prostitute mother to a Peking opera troupe supervised by Master Guan. There, Douzi befriends another boy about his age, Shitou.

A teenage Douzi is trained to play &quot;dan&quot; (female heroine roles), while Shitou learns &quot;jing&quot; (male hero roles). When practicing the play &quot;Dreaming of the World Outside the Nunnery&quot;, Douzi misstates the line &quot;I am by nature a girl, not a boy&quot; with &quot;I am by nature a boy, not a girl,&quot; for which he receives severe physical punishment. Douzi and another student, Laizi, attempt to run away, but Douzi decides to pursue acting seriously after witnessing an opera performance. Upon returning, they find the whole troupe being punished for their desertion, and Douzi is beaten. As a result, Laizi hangs himself.

An agent who provides funding for opera plays comes to the troupe to seek potential actors. When Douzi repeats the same mistake in front of the agent, Shitou commands him to start over. Douzi finally delivers the entire monologue successfully and secures the agent. The troupe is invited to perform for eunuch Zhang. Shitou and Douzi are brought to Zhang&#x27;s house where they find a finely crafted sword, which Shitou promises to one day gift to Douzi, as the hero would do for his concubine. Zhang asks to meet Douzi in his room and sexually assaults him. Shitou implicitly knows what happened although Douzi does not speak of the assault. On their way home, Douzi rescues an abandoned baby, who later comes under Master Guan&#x27;s training.
Years later, Douzi and Shitou have become Peking opera stars, taking the names Cheng Dieyi and Duan Xiaolou, respectively. Their signature performance is the play &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;, where Cheng Dieyi plays Consort Yu and Duan Xiaolou plays the hero Xiang Yu. Their fame attracts the attention of Yuan Shiqing, a reputable person who attends their performances. Yuan Shiqing has come to possess the sword which was once in Eunuch Zhang&#x27;s house and gifts the sword to Dieyi. The adult Cheng Dieyi is in love with Duan Xiaolou; when Xiaolou marries Juxian, a headstrong courtesan at an upscale brothel, Dieyi and Xiaolou&#x27;s relationship begins to fall apart. The love triangle between Dieyi, Xiaolou, and Juxian leads to jealousy and betrayal, which is further complicated by the successive political upheavals following the Second Sino-Japanese War. When Master Guan dies, the abandoned baby, now Xiao Si, comes under Dieyi&#x27;s training to continue learning &quot;dan&quot; roles.

When the communist forces win the civil war, Xiao Si becomes an avid follower of the new government. Dieyi&#x27;s addiction to opium negatively affects his performances, but he ultimately rehabilitates with the help of Xiaolou and Juxian. Xiao Si nurtures resentment against Dieyi because of his rigorous teachings and usurps his role in &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; during one performance, without anyone telling Dieyi beforehand. Devastated by the betrayal, Dieyi secludes himself and refuses to reconcile with Xiaolou. As the Cultural Revolution continues, the entire opera troupe is put on a struggle session by the Red Guards where, under pressure, Dieyi and Xiaolou accuse each other of counterrevolutionary acts. Dieyi also tells the guards that Juxian was a prostitute. To protect himself from further prosecution, Xiaolou swears that he does not love her and will &quot;make a clean break&quot; with her. Juxian is heartbroken and returns the sword to Dieyi before committing suicide. Afterward, Xiao Si is caught by the Red Guards when he is singing Consort Yu&#x27;s lines to the mirror alone in a practice room.

In 1977, Dieyi and Xiaolou reunite, seeming to have mended their relationship. They once again practice &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;. During a break, Xiaolou begins reciting the line &quot;I am by nature a boy,&quot; to which Dieyi makes the same mistake of finishing with &quot;I am not a girl.&quot; The film ends with both of them finishing the rehearsal, but Dieyi takes Xiaolou&#x27;s sword and cuts his own throat, paralleling the concubine&#x27;s final act in the opera.

==Cast==
==Production==
Chen Kaige was first given a copy of Lilian Lee&#x27;s novel in 1988, and although Chen found the story of the novel to be &quot;compelling&quot;, he found the emotional subtext of the novel &quot;a bit thin&quot;. After meeting with Lee, they together recruited Chinese writer Lu Wei for the screenplay, and in 1991, he completed the first draft of the screenplay. The director chose the heroic suicide of Dieyi over the original story&#x27;s banality in order to present the &quot;Lie nu&quot; image of Dieyi and to accentuate women&#x27;s liberation which was a big theme in Fifth Generation films.

Jackie Chan was originally considered for the role of Cheng Dieyi, but he declined the offer. John Lone later lobbied for the role but failed to progress past contractual negotiations with producer Hsu Feng.

Hong Kong actor Leslie Cheung was used in the film to attract audiences because melodramas were not a popular genre. It was believed that it was the first film where Cheung spoke Mandarin Chinese. However, for most of the movie Cheung&#x27;s voice is dubbed by Beijing actor Yang Lixin. Director Chen left Cheung&#x27;s original voice in two scenes, where Cheung&#x27;s voice is distorted by physical and mental distress. Due to Gong Li&#x27;s international stardom, she was cast as one of the main characters in the film.

==Historical background==
The historical background of the film is multi-layered and complicated, which contributes to the plot and the composition of the film. The 1990s saw the Chinese government trying to improve the country&#x27;s image after controversial protests that involved students, workers, and foreign government agencies . David Shambaugh writes that the government&#x27;s new agenda focused on &quot;restoring the appearance of unity in the leadership, ensuring the loyalty of the military, reestablishing social order, reasserting central control over the provinces, recentralizing and retrenching the economy, and redefining China&#x27;s role in a post-Cold War international environment&quot;. In addition to the government&#x27;s attempts at improving the country&#x27;s image, by the time of the film&#x27;s release, the atmosphere toward criticism of Cultural Revolution shifted. As Luo Hui notes &quot;criticizing the Cultural Revolution had become permissible, even fashionable&quot;, allowing the film to highlight the devastation in the world of art, as well as other aspects of Chinese society like medicine and education, suffered at the hands of the Cultural Revolution movement.

The film delves deeply into the psychological and emotional complexities of its central characters. Cheng Dieyi is shaped not only by the rigid and grueling training of the Peking Opera, but also by the societal and political forces of his time, which profoundly influence his identity as both an artist and a person. His role as the Concubine blurs the lines between performance and reality, leaving him unable to separate his true self from the character he plays. Roger Ebert noted that Dieyi was “essentially raised by the opera as a homosexual whether or not he consents,” highlighting the film’s exploration of identity as shaped by societal and cultural forces.
Farewell My Concubine is both an epic historical drama and an intimate melodrama. Roger Ebert praised the film for its ambitious narrative, noting that it “helped him to feel and imagine what it was like to live in China during those times.” The film also examines the survival of traditional art forms like Peking Opera amidst political turmoil, with the Peking opera presenting as both a cultural foundation and a site of personal conflict. Director Chen Kaige’s personal experiences during the Cultural Revolution, including denouncing his father, informed his vision for the film, adding authenticity to its depiction of the era’s hardships.

==Release==

===Release in China===
The film premiered in Shanghai in July 1993 but was removed from theatres after two weeks for further censorial review, and was subsequently banned in August. Because the film won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival, the ban was met with an international outcry. Feeling that there was &quot;no choice&quot; and fearing the ban hurt China&#x27;s bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, officials allowed the film to resume public showings in September. This release was censored; scenes dealing with the Cultural Revolution (led by the Chinese Communist Party) and homosexuality were cut, and the final scene was revised to &quot;soften the blow of the suicide&quot;.

===Box office and reception===
The film was released to three theaters on 15 October 1993, and grossed $69,408 in its opening weekend. The film grossed $5,216,888 in the US.

In 2005, some 25,000 Hong Kong film fans voted it their favorite Chinese-language film of the century (the second was Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot;).

==International audience==
The attractiveness of the film for international markets was raised by some critics who were concerned that the film&#x27;s visual and artistic settings were too culturally specific. On the other hand, the film was internationally attractive. The rich political and cultural imagery is presented as a colorful east Asian tableaux that intrigues westererners. China&#x27;s image is a key feature of the film, and the image of that cultural and political iconography is presented for an international audience. Thus, some critics charge the filmmakers with playing into stereotypes perpetuated about China.

Some critics point to the fact that Chen had created the film to fit domestic and international audiences&#x27; tastes, as Chen understands some of the international audience&#x27;s perceptions and attitudes about Chinese history and sexuality.

===Miramax edited version===
At Cannes, the film was awarded the highest prize, the Palme d&#x27;Or. Miramax Films mogul Harvey Weinstein purchased distribution rights and removed fourteen minutes, resulting in a 157-minute cut. This is the version seen theatrically in the United States and United Kingdom.

According to Peter Biskind&#x27;s book, &quot;Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance and the Rise of Independent Film&quot;, Louis Malle, Cannes jury president that year, said: &quot;The film we admired so much in Cannes is not the film seen in this country [the U.S.], which is twenty minutes shorter – but seems longer because it doesn&#x27;t make any sense. It was better before those guys made cuts.&quot;

The uncut 171-minute version has been released by Miramax on DVD.

=== 4K re-release ===
In the fall of 2023, distributor Film Movement released the 4K restoration of the film theatrically in celebration of its 30th anniversary. It was the first time the uncut version was released in North American theaters.

The Criterion Collection later announced a 4K Ultra HD/Blu-ray package for a July 2024 release.

==Music and soundtrack==

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Roger Ebert awarded the film four stars, praising the plot as &quot;almost unbelievably ambitious&quot; and executed with &quot;freedom and energy&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Vincent Canby hailed it for &quot;action, history, exotic color&quot;, positively reviewing the acting of Gong Li, Leslie Cheung and Zhang Fengyi. In &quot;New York&quot;, David Denby criticized the &quot;spectacle&quot; but felt it would excel internationally, portraying a triumph of love and culture through the darkness. Hal Hinson, writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, highlighted &quot;its swooning infatuation with the theater- with its colors, its vitality and even its cruel rigors&quot;. Desson Howe for the same publication was less positive, writing that the first half had impact but gives way to &quot;novel-like meandering&quot;, with less point, as the film reaches its conclusion.

The film was included in &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s 2004 list of The Best 1000 Movies Ever Made and &quot;Time&quot;″s 2005 list of Best Movies of All Time. It was ranked  97 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema&quot; in 2010, and No. 1 in &quot;Time Out&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Best Mainland Chinese Films&quot; feature in 2014. The film has a 90% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 52 reviews, with an average rating of 7.80/10. The critics consensus reads, &quot;Chen Kaing&#x27;s epic is grand in scope and presentation, and, bolstered by solid performances, the result is a film both horrifying and enthralling.&quot; The BBC placed the film at number 12 on its 2018 list of the 100 greatest foreign language films. It ranked at number 55 on the Hong Kong Film Awards Association (HKFAA)&#x27;s list of the Best 100 Chinese-Language Motion Pictures in 2005. The public ranked &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; atop a 2005 poll of the most beloved films in Hong Kong conducted by Handerson ArtReach.

===Year-end lists ===

===Accolades===
At the Cannes Film Festival, the film shared the Palme d&#x27;Or with Jane Campion&#x27;s &quot;The Piano&quot; from New Zealand. &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; was the first, and as of 2023, remained the only, Chinese-language film to win the Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes.

<text>The governor of South Carolina is the head of government of South Carolina and serves as commander-in-chief of the U.S. state&#x27;s military forces. The current governor is Henry McMaster.

==Governors==

South Carolina was one of the original Thirteen Colonies and was admitted as a state on May 23, 1788. Before it declared its independence, South Carolina was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain. It seceded from the Union on December 20, 1860, and was a founding member of the Confederate States of America on February 4, 1861. Following the end of the American Civil War, South Carolina during Reconstruction was part of the Second Military District, which exerted some control over governor appointments and elections. South Carolina was readmitted to the Union on July 9, 1868.

Under the first constitution of South Carolina, a president of the state was elected for a term of two years, who then could not run again until four years had passed. The 1865 constitution briefly increased terms to four years, but that was changed in the 1868 constitution back to two years, with no term limit. An amendment in 1926 increased term lengths to four years, but limited governors to not being able to succeed themselves; an amendment in 1981 allowed governors to succeed themselves once. The 1776 constitution created the office of vice-president, renamed to lieutenant governor in 1778, to succeed to the governorship should it become vacant.

<doc id="204790" wikidata="Q7547763" url="?curid=204790" title="Sniffles (Merrie Melodies)">
<text>Sniffles is an animated cartoon and comic-book mouse character in the Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; and &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series of cartoons and comics.

==Appearance==
Sniffles&#x27; head is almost as large as his body, which allows his infant-like face to dominate his look. He has large, baby-like eyes, a small bewhiskered nose, and a perpetual smile. His ears grow from the sides of his head, placed so as to hearken more to a human infant than to Mickey Mouse. The character wears a blue sailor cap, a red shirt, blue pants, a yellow scarf, white gloves and tan shoes. His fur is brown with light markings on the face.

==History==
Director Chuck Jones created Sniffles as a potential new star for the studio in 1939.

Jones debuted the character in the short &quot;Naughty but Mice&quot; (1939). In &quot;Naughty but Mice&quot;, Sniffles has a cold and is searching for a remedy. He eventually stumbles upon an alcoholic cold medicine, drinks it, and becomes intoxicated. He then pals around with an electric shaver, which eventually saves him from a hungry cat. Sniffles was played by voice actresses Margaret Hill-Talbot and Marjorie Tarlton.

Jones went on to direct 12 cartoons featuring Sniffles, most of which showcase the naïveté of Sniffles by placing him in a dangerous world. For example, in &quot;Sniffles Takes a Trip&quot; (1940), a simple drive into the country turns into a nightmare as Sniffles is constantly frightened and awed by his surroundings. Some of Sniffles&#x27; films pair him with a bookworm character who accompanies the mouse into a sort of fantasyland where books and toys come to life, such as &quot;Toy Trouble&quot; (1941). Others simply focus on the inescapable sweetness of the character. In &quot;Bedtime for Sniffles&quot; (1940), for example, he struggles to stay awake into the wee hours on Christmas Eve in order to glimpse Santa Claus. This scene is a showcase for Jones&#x27; facility of realizing character through facial expression.

By the end of the series, Jones transformed Sniffles into an incessant chatterbox who serves more as a nuisance than a cute protagonist. For example, in &quot;The Unbearable Bear&quot; (1943), Sniffles foils a robbery attempt by perpetually pestering the perpetrator. Theses traits were originally part of Little Blabbermouse, another Merrie Melodies character that appeared in two shorts, directed by Friz Freleng (&quot;Little Blabbermouse&quot; (1940) and &quot;Shop, Look, and Listen&quot; (1940)) before being retired. Jones was moving out of his Disney-esque stage in the late 1940s, and Sniffles was retired in 1946 as the director took to more sadistic characters such as the Three Bears, fellow mice Hubie and Bertie, Marvin the Martian, and Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner. The mouse&#x27;s final cartoon was &quot;Hush My Mouse&quot; (his only entry in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series) in 1946.
Sniffles faded into obscurity in the animation arena. However, he would find new life in the &quot;Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies Comics&quot; begun in 1940 by Dell Comics (writer Chase Craig used several minor Warner Bros. characters to fill pages). These comics teamed Sniffles with a little girl named Mary Jane who could shrink herself to mouse size, originally by sprinkling magic sand borrowed from the Sandman. Throughout most of the series, she could shrink just by reciting &quot;First I close my eyes real tight / Then I wish with all my might / Magic words of poof poof piffles / Make me just as small as Sniffles.&quot; By now Sniffles had lost most of his animated film personality and was just a companion to Mary Jane as she explored something found in a garden or entered a sort of magical toyland. Mary Jane surpassed the mouse in popularity, and got top billing in later issues. Artist Roger Armstrong drew the series until Al Hubbard took over in the 1950s. These adventures proved a favorite with readers, and the series continued until 1961. This series was resurrected in 2006 for a story in issue #140 of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; comic book published by DC Comics.

With the exception of &quot;Naughty but Mice&quot;, every cartoon in the Sniffles series was given a Blue Ribbon reissue. All 12 Sniffles cartoons were included on that &quot;Looney Tunes Mouse Chronicles: The Chuck Jones Collection&quot; DVD and Blu-ray set.

The 1990 television series &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; features a younger counterpart to Sniffles named Li&#x27;l Sneezer, a baby mouse with a propensity for having hurricane-force sneezes.

Sniffles has a cameo in the movie &quot;Space Jam&quot;, voiced by Colleen Wainwright. He plays for the Looney Tunes team and is squashed flat by one of the Monstars after he chats very quickly and very annoyingly to one of them.

He appears in &quot;The Sylvester &amp; Tweety Mysteries&quot;, voiced by Kath Soucie. In the episode &quot;The Tail End&quot;, he is depicted as a scientifically created Manx mouse with no tail, and unlike his other appearances in this episode, he does not wear any clothes except for a cap.

Sniffles appears in the &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot; segments &quot;DarkBat&quot;, &quot;Bonjour, DarkBat&quot; and &quot;Smoothie Operator&quot;, voiced again by Kath Soucie. He has a superhero alter-ego called DarkBat (voiced by Daran Norris) who is a parody of Batman.

Sniffles appears in &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot;, where he is voiced by Dawson Griffin.

<text>USS &quot;Badger was an [[auxiliary cruiser]] of the [[United States Navy]], the first U.S. Navy ship named after the [[badger (animal)|burrowing mammal]]. &quot;Badger&quot; was sold to the War Department in April 1900 to serve as theU.S. Army Transport &quot;Lawton.

She was built in 1889 by Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works, Chester, Pennsylvania, as merchant ship Yumuri, purchased for use in the Spanish–American War on 19 April 1898 and converted to an auxiliary cruiser at New York Navy Yard, then commissioned on 25 April 1898, Commander A. S. Snow in command; and joined the North Patrol Squadron.

==Service history==
From 1 July to 18 August 1898, &quot;Badger&quot; served on the blockade of Cuba. On 26 July 1898, off the Dry Tortugas, she seized a Spanish tug with two vessels in tow, each with a quarantine flag hoisted. They were given medical assistance, provisioned, and kept in port until 3 August when a prize crew was put aboard the tug to sail her to New York. The other two vessels with 399 prisoners of war were sent to Havana.

&quot;Badger&quot; left Guantánamo Bay on 18 August 1898 with a contingent of Army troops, landing them at Montauk Point, New York, 24 August. &quot;Badger&quot; remained on the east coast until 26 December 1898 when she sailed to the Pacific, arriving at San Francisco 15 April 1899. From there she carried the Joint High Commission to Samoa (26 April – 13 May 1899) and then cruised in Samoan waters. Following her return to Mare Island Navy Yard on 14 August 1899, she cruised along the Pacific coast until 6 October 1899 with the Oregon and California Naval Militia. Decommissioned on 31 October 1899, &quot;Badger&quot; was transferred to the War Department on 7 April 1900, where she was renamed &quot;Lawton&quot; and used as an army transport.

USAT &quot;Lawton&quot;, , was fitted for troop and supply service to Alaska with a capacity for 700 passengers. In June 1900 the ship was engaged in returning destitute citizens from Alaska to the United States. Over the next fiscal year (1 July 1900 – 30 June 1901) &quot;Lawton&quot; was also engaged in transport to China and interisland service in the Philippines. The ship transported troops to China in July 1900 in response to the Boxer Rebellion.

<doc id="204804" wikidata="Q235381" url="?curid=204804" title="Joanna I of Naples">
<text>Joanna I, also known as Johanna I (; December 1325 – 27 July 1382), was Queen of Naples, and Countess of Provence and Forcalquier from 1343 to 1381; she was also Princess of Achaea from 1373 to 1381.

Joanna was the eldest daughter of Charles, Duke of Calabria and Marie of Valois to survive infancy. Her father was the son of Robert the Wise, King of Naples, but he died before his father in 1328. Three years later, King Robert appointed Joanna as his heir and ordered his vassals to swear fealty to her. To strengthen Joanna&#x27;s position, he concluded an agreement with his nephew, King Charles I of Hungary, about the marriage of Charles&#x27;s younger son, Andrew, and Joanna. Charles I also wanted to secure his uncle&#x27;s inheritance to Andrew, but King Robert named Joanna as his sole heir on his deathbed in 1343. He also appointed a regency council to govern his realms until Joanna&#x27;s 21st birthday, but the regents could not actually take control of state administration after the King&#x27;s death.

Joanna&#x27;s personal life crucially affected the political stability of the Kingdom of Naples (murder of her first husband Andrew in 1345, the invasions of King Louis I of Hungary—justified as avenging the death of his brother—and her three later marriages with Louis of Taranto, James IV, titular King of Majorca and Otto, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen) and undermined her position with the Holy See; moreover afterwards, during the Western Schism, she chose to support the Avignon Papacy against Pope Urban VI, who in retaliation declared her a heretic and usurper on 11 May 1380.

With all her children having predeceased her, Joanna&#x27;s heirs were the descendants of her only surviving sister Maria, whose first marriage with their cousin Charles, Duke of Durazzo was performed without her permission, becoming both spouses in the heads of the political faction against Joanna. Trying to reconcile with the Durazzo branch and with the purpose of securing her succession, Joanna arranged the marriage of her niece Margaret of Durazzo with her first cousin (and Joanna&#x27;s second cousin) Charles of Durazzo, who eventually captured and imprisoned Joanna, and finally ordered her assassination on 27 July 1382.

==Early years==

Joanna was the eldest surviving child of Charles, Duke of Calabria (only surviving son of Robert the Wise, King of Naples), and Marie of Valois (sister of King Philip VI of France). The Renaissance historian Donato Acciaioli claimed that she had been born in Florence, but she may have actually been born during her parents&#x27; travel towards the town, according to scholar Nancy Goldstone. The precise date of Joanna&#x27;s birth is unknown; according to some researchers, she was most probably born in 1326 or 1327; however, given the fact that her mother gave birth to four or five children during her four years&#x27; marriage, Joanna was probably born in either December 1325 or early 1328. The early deaths of two of her siblings —A daughter, variously named Eloisa, Louise or Maria (born in January/February 1325; died 27 December 1325) and Charles Martel (born 13 April 1327; died eight days later)— left Joanna as the second in line to the Neapolitan throne after her own father. 
Charles of Calabria died unexpectedly on 9 November 1328. With his death, his father faced the problem of succession, because Charles&#x27; posthumous child was also a daughter, Maria, born on 6 May 1329. Although Neapolitan law did not prevent women from inheriting the throne, the concept of a reigning queen was unusual. The agreement between the Holy See and Robert the Wise&#x27;s grandfather, Charles I of Anjou, had explicitly acknowledged the right of Charles I&#x27;s female descendants to inherit the throne, but it also stipulated that a female monarch was to marry and to allow her husband to rule. Furthermore, the Neapolitan royal house was a branch of the Capet dynasty of France and the French had recently excluded women from royal succession. Robert&#x27;s nephew, Charles I of Hungary, had been disinherited in Robert&#x27;s favor in 1296, but he did not abandon his claim to the &quot;Regno&quot; (or the Kingdom of Naples). Pope John XXII had ignored Charles&#x27;s demands for years, but Robert&#x27;s support for the Spiritual Franciscans (whom the Pope regarded as heretics) and his negligence to pay the yearly tribute to the Holy See gave rise to tensions between Naples and the Papacy. Robert&#x27;s two younger brothers, Philip I, Prince of Taranto, and John, Duke of Durazzo, could also claim the throne against a female monarch.

Robert was determined to secure the succession to his descendants and named Joanna and Maria as his heirs at a public ceremony at the Castel Nuovo in Naples on 4 December 1330. John of Durazzo and his wife, Agnes of Périgord, accepted Robert&#x27;s decision (possibly in the hope that one of their three sons could marry Joanna), but Philip I of Taranto and his wife, Catherine of Valois, decided not to obey. When Joanna was invested with the right to succeed her grandfather on 30 November, John and Agnes were among the Neapolitan vassals who swore fealty to her, but Philip and Catherine did not attend the ceremony. Even the Pope could only persuade Philip to send a deputy to Naples to pay homage to Joanna on his behalf on 3 March 1331.

Charles I of Hungary had meanwhile asked the Pope to persuade Robert to restore the two fiefs that his father, Charles Martel, had held in the &quot;Regno&quot;the Principality of Salerno and the Honor of Monte Sant&#x27; Angeloto him and his sons. He also put forward a marriage alliance, asking Joanna&#x27;s hand for one of his sons. The Pope supported the plan and kept urging Robert to accept it. The widowed Catherine of Valois approached her half-brother, Philip VI of France, to intervene and block the marriage. She proposed her sons, Robert, Prince of Taranto and Louis, as suitable husbands for Joanna and Maria. The Pope was resolute and issued a bull on 30 June 1331, ordering that Joanna and her sister were to marry Charles I&#x27;s sons. Initially, Charles I&#x27;s eldest son, Louis, was designated for husband to Joanna. His younger brother, Andrew, was only Louis&#x27;s substitute in case of his premature death. At one point during the negotiations, Charles I changed his decision and appointed Andrew to marry Joanna.

After Marie of Valois died during a pilgrimage to Bari in 1332, Robert&#x27;s second wife (Joanna&#x27;s stepgrandmother), Sancia of Majorca, assumed responsibility for her daughters&#x27; education. Queen Sancia, a fervent patron of the Spiritual Franciscans, lived like a Clarisse nun, although the Pope had refused to annul her marriage to King Robert. Joanna and Maria&#x27;s nurse, Philippa of Catania, exercised an even greater influence on their education, and became a sort of second mother for the orphaned princesses. Sancia and Philippa were the most influential personalities in the court of Robert who did not make decisions without their consent, according to Boccaccio.

Raised in the cultured and refined court of her grandfather, Joanna apparently received no formal education or, if she did, was not very accurate, given that the Angevin documents do not mention the names of her tutors. She probably studied the books in the royal library, which contained the writings of Titus Livius, Paolo da Perugia, Saint Gregory and Marco Polo. However, it seems that when she reached adulthood she was able to express herself in Latin (as her remaining letters could prove), French, Italian and Provençal. The chronicler Domenico da Gravina affirms that both Joanna and her sister Maria had been &quot;informed of every art and virtue by the same Lord King Robert and by Queen Sancia&quot;.

Charles I of Hungary came personally to Naples to complete the negotiations with his uncle about the marriage of Joanna and Andrew in the summer of 1333. He had not spared money during the journey, because he wanted to demonstrate his wealth and power. The two kings came to terms after further negotiations. According to the agreement, Andrew and Joanna were engaged, but Robert and Charles I also stipulated that Andrew was to marry Maria if he outlived Joanna and one of Charles I&#x27;s surviving sonsLouis or Stephenshould marry Joanna if Andrew died before her. The marriage contract was ceremoniously signed on 26 September. Next day, Robert invested Joanna and Andrew with the Duchy of Calabria and the Principality of Salerno. The Pope granted the necessary dispensations for the marriages in November 1333. The marriage remained unconsummated for years, most probably because of Andrew&#x27;s immaturity, but it gave rise to conflicts between the different branches of the House of Anjou.

Andrew grew up in Naples, but he and his Hungarian retainers were regarded as foreigners. His cousins (the sons of Philip of Taranto and John of Durazzo), and even Joanna often made fun of him. Both contemporaneous and later authors were convinced that King Robert initially wanted to appoint Andrew as his successor. For instance, Giovanni Villani, claimed that the King &quot;wanted his nephew, son of the King of Hungary, to succeed him after his death&quot;. However, miniatures of the &quot;Anjou Bible&quot; depict only Joanna wearing a crown in the late 1330s. Since the King had commissioned it, the pictures suggests that he had decided to ignore Andrew&#x27;s claim to the throne. Indeed, in his last will, he named Joanna as his sole heir to Naples, Provence, Forcalquier and Piedmont, and also bequeathed his claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem to her. He also stipulated that Maria was to inherit Joanna&#x27;s realms if she died childless. King Robert did not order Andrew&#x27;s coronation, thus excluding him from the administration of Naples. The dying king also set up a regency council, consisting of his most trusted advisorsthe Vice-Chancellor Philippe de Cabassoles, Bishop of Cavaillon, Fillipo di Sanginetto, Great Seneschal of Provence, and Admiral Giffredo di Marzanoand headed by Sancia. He ordered that Joanna could only start to rule alone after her 21st birthday, ignoring customary law which established 18 as the age of majority.

==Reign==

===Accession===

King Robert died on 20 January 1343, at the age of 67, after 34 years as king of Naples. Two days later, Andrew was knighted and his marriage to Joanna was consummated in accordance with the late king&#x27;s last wishes. Thereafter, they mainly met with each other only at important state and religious ceremonies. Otherwise, they went to separate churches, they visited separate places and Joanna even forbade her husband to enter her bedchamber without her permission. The fifteen-year-old Andrew did not have his own treasury and Joanna&#x27;s courtiers controlled his daily spending.

When writing about the political situation in the &quot;Regno&quot; after Robert&#x27;s death, Petrarch described Joanna and Andrew as &quot;two lambs entrusted to the care of a multitude of wolves, and I see a kingdom without a king&quot;. Most political factors resented the establishment of the regency council. Joanna approached Pope Clement VI and asked him to grant the title of king to her husband, most probably because she wanted to secure the Hungarian Angevins&#x27; support to shorten the term of her minority. The Pope regarded the establishment of the regency council as a usurpation of his sovereign rights, but he wanted to control the administration of Naples. He rejected Joanna&#x27;s proposal, but he rarely addressed letters directly to the council.

Agnes of Périgord wanted to secure the marriage of Joanna&#x27;s sister Maria to her eldest son, Charles of Durazzo. The Dowager Queen Sancia and Joanna supported her plan, but they knew that Catherine of Valois would oppose the marriage. Agnes&#x27;s brother, Hélie de Talleyrand-Périgord, was the most influential cardinal at the Pope&#x27;s court in Avignon. He persuaded Clement VI to issue a papal bull on 26 February 1343, authorizing Charles of Durazzo to marry any woman. In possession of the bull, Maria was engaged to Charles of Durazzo in the presence of Joanna, Sancia and other members of the regency council at Castel Nuovo on 26 March. The betrothal outraged Catherine of Valois who appealed to King Philip VI of France and the Pope, demanding them to achieve its annulment. Two days after the betrothal, Charles of Durazzo abducted Maria to his castle where a priest secretly married them and the marriage was soon consummated.

Catherine of Valois&#x27;s second son, Louis of Taranto, invaded Charles of Durazzo&#x27;s domains. Charles of Durazzo gathered his troops to secure the defence of his estates. Her sister&#x27;s secret marriage infuriated Joanna and she sent letters to the Pope demanding the annulment of the marriage. Pope Clement VI refused and commanded Cardinal Talleyrand-Périgord to send an envoy to Naples to mediate a compromise. The cardinal&#x27;s emissary persuaded the parties to sign an agreement on 14 July 1343. The legitimacy of Charles and Maria&#x27;s marriage was acknowledged, but Catherine of Valois and her sons received cash settlement from the royal treasury. Joanna lost confidence both in her sister and in the Durazzo branch of her family and started to promote the career of her most trusted retainers, including Philippa of Catania&#x27;s son, Roberto de&#x27; Cabanni, and her illegitimate uncle, Charles d&#x27;Artois.

===Conflicts===

Andrew&#x27;s Hungarian retainers informed his mother, Elizabeth of Poland, about Andrew&#x27;s uncertain position. She and her eldest son, Louis I of Hungary, sent envoys to Avignon, urging the Pope to order Andrew&#x27;s coronation. She also decided to visit the &quot;Regno&quot; to strengthen Andrew&#x27;s position. Before departing from Hungary, Queen Elizabeth collected 21,000 marks of gold and 72,000 marks of silver from the Hungarian treasury, because she was ready to spend a large amount of money to buy the support of the Holy See and the Neapolitan aristocrats for her son. She and her retinue landed at Manfredonia in the summer of 1343. She and her son met at Benevento, but Joanna received her only days later at Somma Vesuviana. When meeting with her mother-in-law, Joanna was wearing her crown to emphasize her royal status.

Queen Elizabeth and her retinue entered Naples on 25 July. She first approached Joanna&#x27;s stepgrandmother, but the ailing Sancia of Majorca did not interfere in favor of Andrew. Joanna did not openly oppose her husband&#x27;s coronation, but her mother-in-law soon realized that she only applied delaying tactics. Queen Elizabeth left Naples for Rome and sent envoys to Avignon, urging the Pope to sanction Andrew&#x27;s coronation. Petrarch, who visited Naples in October as Cardinal Giovanni Colonna&#x27;s envoy, experienced that the kingdom had moved towards anarchy after King Robert&#x27;s death. He recorded that bands of bullying noblemen terrorized the people during the nights and gladiator games were regularly held in the presence of Joanna and Andrew. He also claimed that a hypocrite Franciscan friar, Fra&#x27; Roberto, controlled the regency council, describing him as a &quot;terrible three-footed beast, with its feet naked, with its head bare, arrogant about its poverty, dripping with pleasure.&quot;

Petrarch wanted to achieve the liberation of Colonna&#x27;s relatives, the Pipini brothers, who had been imprisoned for various crimes in 1341. Their property was distributed among various members of the royal family and the Neapolitan aristocracy and Petrarch could persuade the regency council to grant an amnesty to them. Queen Elizabeth, who was still staying in Rome, realized that the conflict between the influential cardinal and the Neapolitan leaders gave an opportunity to strengthen her son&#x27;s position. Andrew took sides with the Pipini and promised to achieve their liberation. Petrarch&#x27;s reports from Naples convinced the Pope that the regency council could not administer the kingdom effectively. Emphasizing that Joanna was still a minor, the Pope appointed Cardinal Aymery de Châlus as his legate and charged him with the government of the &quot;Regno&quot; in a bull on 28 November 1343. Joanna&#x27;s envoys made several efforts to delay the papal legate&#x27;s departure from Avignon.

The negotiations between her mother-in-law and the Holy See alarmed Joanna and she asked the Pope in a letter on 1 December to stop discussing Neapolitan issues with the Hungarian envoys. The Pope addressed Andrew as the &quot;illustrious king of Sicily&quot; and urged his coronation in a letter on 19 January 1344, but he soon emphasized Joanna&#x27;s hereditary right to rule. Five days later, Joanna urged the Pope to withdraw his legate and to authorize her to rule alone. The Pope soon responded, declaring that Joanna would alone rule the kingdom &quot;just as if she were a man&quot; even after she and her husband were jointly crowned. Around the same time, Queen Elizabeth returned to Naples and Andrew&#x27;s courtiers informed her that they had learnt of plots against Andrew&#x27;s life. She decided to take her son back to Hungary, but Joanna, Agnes of Périgord and Catherine of Valois jointly dissuaded her. Joanna and her grandaunts most probably feared that Andrew would return from Hungary to Naples accompanied by Hungarian troops. Queen Elizabeth departed from Italy on 25 February, leaving her son behind. The Angevins&#x27; northern Italian enemies took advantage of the weakened position of the &quot;Regno&quot;. John II, Marquess of Montferrat and the Visconti of Milan captured Alessandria and Asti in Piedmont and continued their military campaign against other Piedmontese towns that acknowledged Joanna&#x27;s sovereignty. They forced Tortona, Bra and Alba into submission in 1344.

Joanna started distributing large parcels of the royal domains to her most trusted supporters, among them Roberto de&#x27; Cabanni, who was rumoured to be her lover. Joanna&#x27;s donations outraged the Pope who started to hint that he was ready to strengthen Andrew&#x27;s role in state administration. The Pope also ordered Aymery de Châlus to move to Naples without any delay. Chalus reached Naples on 20 May 1344. Joanna wanted to swear fealty to the Pope alone in a private ceremony, but the papal legate resisted her demands. Joanna had to take the oath of obedience along with her husband in a public ceremony. Joanna fell sick and her illness enabled Andrew to achieve the Pipini brothers&#x27; liberation, but his act outraged other Neapolitan aristocrats. On 28 August, the papal legate formally recognized Joanna as the legitimate heir to Naples, but she had to acknowledge the papal legate&#x27;s right to administer the kingdom. Chalus dissolved the regency council and appointed new officials to govern the provinces. However, the royal officials ignored the legate&#x27;s orders and Joanna refused to pay the yearly tribute to the Holy See, saying that she had been deprived of the &quot;Regno&quot;.

Cardinal Talleyrand-Périgord and Joanna&#x27;s envoy, Louis of Durazzo, urged Pope Clement VI to dismiss his legate who was also willing to abdicate. After King Philip VI intervened against the legate, the Pope decided to recall him, declaring that the 18-year-old Joanna had matured under the legate&#x27;s auspices in December 1344. In February 1345, the Pope issued a bull, forbidding Joanna&#x27;s most trusted advisorsPhilippa of Catania and her relativesto intervene in politics, but he also replaced Chalus with Guillaume Lamy, Bishop of Chartres. To placate the Pope, Joanna decided to conciliate Andrew and their conjugal union was restored. Before long, she became pregnant.

Joanna had meanwhile instructed Reforce d&#x27;Agoult, Senechal of Provence, to invade Piedmont. The burghers of Chieri and James of Savoy-Achaea joined the Provençal army. They reoccupied Alba in the spring, but John II of Montferrat and the Visconti gathered their troops near Chieri and defeated Agoult&#x27;s army in the Battle of Gamenario on 23 April. Agoult died fighting in the battlefield and Chieri surrendered to the victors.

The relationship between Joanna and the Pope became tense because she again started to alienate royal estates and ignored the Pope&#x27;s proposals. On 10 June, Clement VI urged her to stop obstructing Andrew&#x27;s coronation, but she was determined to exclude her husband from state administration. She answered that she was in the best position to look after her husband&#x27;s interests, implying that her &quot;understanding of gender roles within her marriage&quot; was atypical, according to historian Elizabeth Casteen. On 9 July, the Pope announced that he would excommunicate her if she continued to give away royal estates. Queen Sancia died on 28 July. Before long, Joanna abandoned her husband. Rumours about a love affair between Joanna and Louis of Taranto started to spread in Naples, but her unfaithfulness was never proven. Pope Clement VI decided to achieve Andrew&#x27;s coronation and charged Cardinal Chalus with performing the ceremony.

Hearing of the Pope&#x27;s reversal, a group of noble conspirators determined to forestall Andrew&#x27;s coronation. During a hunting trip at Aversa in 1345, Andrew left his room in the middle of the night from 18 to 19 September and was set upon by the conspirators. A treacherous servant barred the door behind him; and with Joanna in her own bedroom, a terrible struggle ensued, Andrew defending himself furiously and shrieking for aid. He was finally overpowered, strangled with a cord, and flung from a window with a rope tied to his genitals. Isolde, Andrew&#x27;s Hungarian nurse, heard his cries, and with her own screams chased the murderers off. She took the Prince&#x27;s corpse to the church of the monks and remained with it until next morning in mourning. When the Hungarian knights arrived she told them everything in their mother tongue so no one else would learn about the truth, and soon they left Naples, telling everything to the Hungarian King. Opinions are divided on the real involvement of the Queen in the assassination. For some, she was the instigator of the murder; for others, like Émile-Guillaume Léonard, Joanna&#x27;s involvement has not been demonstrated.

Joanna informed the Papacy, as well as other states in Europe of the murder, expressing her disgust in letters, but her inner circle of friends were thought to be most suspect. On 25 December 1345, she gave birth to a son, Charles Martel, Andrew&#x27;s posthumous child. The infant was proclaimed Duke of Calabria and Prince of Salerno on 11 December 1346 as heir of the Kingdom of Naples.

===Murder and wars===
When Joanna took the throne, several lords in northern Italy saw this as an opportunity to expand their territory at her expense. In 1344 John II, Marquess of Montferrat led attacks which conquered her cities of Alessandria, Asti, Tortona, Bra, and Alba. She sent her seneschal, Reforce d&#x27;Agoult, to deal with it. He engaged the invaders on 23 April 1345 at the Battle of Gamenario, but was soundly defeated and killed.

Montferrat then went on to capture Chieri, within the lands of James of Piedmont, who had supported Joanna. James called for help from his cousin and lord, Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy in 1347. Together, they drove back the attackers through that July. John then added more forces to his alliance, bringing in Thomas II, Marquess of Saluzzo and Humbert II of Viennois. Together, they captured nearly all of Joanna&#x27;s lands in the region.

When she made public her plans to marry one of her Taranto cousins and not Andrew&#x27;s younger brother Stephen, the Hungarians openly accused her of the murder.

Louis of Taranto was a seasoned warrior, who understood Neapolitan politics from his lifetime experiences, raised at the court of Catherine of Valois, Joanna&#x27;s aunt. After Joanna stated her intention to marry him, his brother Robert banded together with his cousin (and erstwhile rival) Charles of Durazzo against them. Some of Joanna&#x27;s courtiers and servants were tortured and later executed, including her Sicilian governess Philippa of Catania and the latter&#x27;s family. Louis was successful in driving his brother&#x27;s forces back, but just as he reached Naples, it became known that the Hungarians planned to invade. Joanna made a pact with the Kingdom of Sicily, preventing them from invading at the same time. She married Louis on 22 August 1347, without seeking the necessary Papal dispensation, because of their being closely related.

In anticipation of his marriage, Louis was made Joint-Protector and Defender of the Kingdom (1 May 1347), jointly with Charles of Durazzo. One month later (20 June), Louis was made Vicar-General of the Kingdom. The marriage caused the Queen&#x27;s popularity within her own Kingdom to fall.
Louis the Great, Andrew&#x27;s older brother, took this opportunity to seek the annexation of the Kingdom of Naples. He launched a military expedition and the first troops made their entrance to L&#x27;Aquila on 10 May 1347.

On 11 January 1348, the Hungarian troops were at Benevento ready to invade the Kingdom of Naples. Faced with this threat, Joanna, who had retired at Castel Nuovo and trusted the loyalty of Marseille, prepared her escape from the vengeance of Louis. Without waiting for the return of her husband, she embarked on 15 January 1348 on two galleys –property of the Marseille citizen Jacques de Gaubert– to Provence, taking with her the still devoted Enrico Caracciolo. Louis of Taranto arrived in Naples the next day and escaped in another galley.

After easily taking the city of Naples, Louis the Great ordered the execution of Charles of Durazzo, Joanna&#x27;s cousin and brother-in-law: he was beheaded on 23 January 1348 in the same place where Louis&#x27; brother Andrew was murdered. Joanna and Andrew&#x27;s son, Charles Martel (betrothed to Charles of Durazzo&#x27;s eldest daughter), who was left behind by his mother, was sent by his uncle to Visegrád in the Kingdom of Hungary, where he died after 10 May 1348, aged 2.

After a stop-over in the Fort de Brégançon, Joanna arrived in Marseille on 20 January 1348, where she received a warm welcome. She swore to observe the privileges of the city and received the oath of allegiance of its inhabitants. She signed the letters patent that united the upper and lower towns, ensuring the administrative unit. She then went to Aix-en-Provence, where her reception was very different; the Provençal barons clearly demonstrated their hostility to her. She had to take an oath to do nothing against Provence and to appoint only locals in the county posts.

Joanna arrived in Avignon on 15 March, to have a personal meeting with the Pope. Louis of Taranto joined her in Aigues-Mortes, and the couple was received by Clement VI. Joanna&#x27;s visit had a triple purpose: to obtain a dispensation for her marriage to Louis of Taranto, to receive the absolution or exoneration of Andrew&#x27;s murder and to prepare the reconquest of her Kingdom. The Pope granted the couple the dispensation, appointed a commission to investigate the charges of involvement in the murder of Andrew and bought the city of Avignon for 80,000 florins, which became effectively separate from Provence. Eventually, Joanna was exonerated for the crime by the Pope. During her stay in Avignon, by the end of June, Joanna gave birth to her second child and first-born from her marriage with Louis of Taranto, a daughter called Catherine.

Having learned that Louis the Great abandoned Naples after the outbreak of the Black Death, Joanna, with her husband and newborn daughter, left Avignon on 21 July and stayed in Marseille during 24–28 July, then moved to Sanary-sur-Mer on 30 July, then to the Fort de Brégançon on 31 July and finally arrived in Naples on 17 August 1348. One month after her arrival, she broke her previous promises on 20 September by removing Raymond d&#x27;Agoult from his post of Seneschal and appointing in his place the Neapolitan Giovanni Barrili. The public discontent forced Joanna to restore d&#x27;Agoult in his post.

Over time, the Hungarians came to be viewed as barbarians by the Neapolitan people, including Giovanni Boccaccio (who described Louis the Great as “’rabid’ and ‘more vicious than a snake’”), so it was easy for the Queen and her husband to gain popularity after their return.

===Louis of Taranto===

From early 1349 onwards, all documents for the Kingdom were issued in the names of both husband and wife, and Louis was indisputably in control of military fortresses. On coins issued during their joint reign, Louis&#x27; name always preceded Joanna&#x27;s. Although he was not officially recognised by Pope Clement VI as king and co-ruler until 1352, Neapolitans likely considered him their monarch from the moment he started acting as such.

Louis took advantage of the turmoil caused by yet another Hungarian attack to wrest complete royal authority from his wife. He purged the court of her supporters, and struck down her favourite, Enrico Caracciolo, whom he accused of adultery in April 1349 and very likely had executed. Two months later, on 8 June 1349, Catherine, Joanna and Louis&#x27; daughter, died aged 1.

After another Hungarian offensive which led to the walls of Naples in 1350, Pope Clement VI sent a Legate, Raymond Saquet, Bishop of Saint-Omer, with a fleet commanded by Hugues des Baux. Following this, Louis of Taranto promised to respect Joanna&#x27;s independence. Shortly after, Louis the Great, seriously injured, returned to his country.

In October 1351, Joanna gave birth to her second child with Louis, another daughter, Françoise. Five months later, on 23 March 1352, Louis received Pope Clement VI&#x27;s formal recognition as his wife&#x27;s co-ruler in all her realms. On 27 May, Louis was crowned with her by the Archbishop of Braga in the Hotel di Taranto in Naples. A few days later, on 2 June, Françoise, by then the couple&#x27;s only surviving child, died aged 8 months.

In 1356 Louis and Joanna organized the reconquest of Sicily. They formally entered Messina on 24 December 1356 after the victory of Niccolò Acciaioli, only to be forced to leave again after a serious naval defeat by the Catalans (29 June 1357) at Acireale.

At the same time, the troops of mercenary Arnaud de Cervole (called &quot;the Archpriest&quot;), crossed the Durance on 13 July 1357 and plundered Provence. Philip II of Taranto, Louis&#x27; brother (and third husband of Joanna&#x27;s sister Maria since April 1355), was sent to Provence as Vicar General to fight against the forces that ravaged Provence. He bought the support of the troops of the Count of Armagnac which also showed daunting for local people. Finally Pope Innocent VI obtained the discharge of these bands with payments.

Louis of Taranto, who caught a cold while bathing, fell ill. His condition worsened over the course of a month and he died on 25 May 1362.

===Personal rule===

The death of Louis of Taranto, a brutal and authoritarian husband, finally gave Joanna the opportunity to take back the power she had been denied. During the next three years, the Queen would take a series of measures that made her popular: she granted a pardon to Raymond des Baux on 20 March 1363, replaced Roger of San Severino by Fouques d&#x27;Agoult as Seneschal of Provence, and promulgated various edicts to prevent internal disorders.

On 14 December 1362, Joanna contracted by proxy her third marriage, with James IV, titular King of Majorca and Prince of Achaea, who was ten years her junior. The wedding took place in person five months later, in May 1363 at Castel Nuovo. Unfortunately, this marriage was also turbulent: her new husband had been imprisoned for almost 14 years by his uncle King Peter IV of Aragon in an iron cage, an experience which left him mentally deranged. In addition to his poor mental state, another bone of contention between the couple was James IV&#x27;s efforts to be involved in the government, although he was excluded from any role in the government of Naples in his marriage contract. Despite her marital troubles, in January 1365 Joanna was found to be pregnant with James IV&#x27;s child, but unfortunately in June she had a miscarriage, as was noted in a letter of condolence sent to her by Pope Urban V dated 19 July 1365. She never conceived again.

Without hope of being King of Naples, James IV left Naples for Spain by the end of January 1366 and made an unsuccessful attempt to recapture Majorca. He was captured by King Henry II of Castile, who transferred him to Bertrand du Guesclin, who held him captive in Montpellier. He was ransomed by Joanna in 1370 and returned to her briefly, only to depart again, this time for good. He failed in an attempt to recapture Roussillon and Cerdanya in 1375, and fled to Castile where he died of illness or poison at Soria in February 1375.

To assert the rights of the Holy Roman Empire over the Kingdom of Arles, Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia crossed Avignon, and was crowned on 4 June 1365 as King of Arles at the Church of St. Trophime, but guaranteed the rights of Joanna over Provence.

Louis I, Duke of Anjou, brother of King Charles V of France and Lieutenant of Languedoc, asserted a claim to Provence. With the help of the armies of Bertrand du Guesclin, he launched an attack. Avignon was ransomed, Arles and Tarascon were besieged, but while the first was captured, the latter was saved by Provençal troops after nineteen days of unsuccessful siege. The troops of Seneschal Raymond II d&#x27;Agoult were defeated at Céreste. The intervention of both Pope Urban V and King Charles V, as well the excommunication against du Guesclin on 1 September 1368, caused the retreat of the latter and the signing of a peace Treaty on 13 April 1369, which was followed by a truce signed on 2 January 1370.

After these periods of unrest, Joanna experienced a period of relative calm, thanks to her good relations with the Holy See under Popes Urban V and Gregory XI. Elzéar of Sabran was canonized in 1371. Bridget of Sweden visited Naples in 1372. Through the mediation of Gregory XI, the final peace treaty with Louis I of Anjou was signed on 11 April 1371, under which he gave up his claim over Tarascon. In addition, the Queen recovered her domains in Piedmont thanks to the success of the condottiero Otto of Brunswick, with whom she later married.

By the Treaty of Villeneuve (1372), Joanna officially recognised as permanent the loss of Sicily, suffered ninety years earlier in 1282. Joanna then immersed herself fully in the running of her kingdom and enjoyed every aspect of government. Although she was a fair and judicious ruler, no law or edict, however minor, was ever carried out without her personal approval and seal. Joanna&#x27;s reign was also marked by her support and protection of local businesses, the creation of new industries, and her refusal to debase the currency. Crime was greatly reduced and she was an ardent promoter of peace within her vast realm.

Despite the Queen&#x27;s deep spirituality and friendships with Catherine of Siena and Bridget of Sweden, her court was notable for its extravagance, with her collection of exotic animals and servants of various origins including Turkish, Saracen, and African.

The contemporary writer Giovanni Boccaccio has left us with the following description of Queen Joanna in his &quot;De mulieribus claris&quot;: &quot;Joanna, queen of Sicily and Jerusalem, is more renowned than other woman of her time for lineage, power, and character&quot;. Extant images reveal her to have been blonde-haired and fair-skinned.

===Western Schism===
Without surviving children, Joanna sought a solution to her succession by arranging the marriage in January 1369 between her niece Margaret of Durazzo (youngest daughter of her sister Maria and her first husband Charles, Duke of Durazzo), and her first-cousin Charles of Durazzo (in turn Joanna&#x27;s second cousin; son of Louis, Count of Gravina). This wedding was opposed by her former brother-in-law and Margaret&#x27;s stepfather Philip II, Prince of Taranto. During a near-fatal illness in November 1373, he bequeathed his claims to his brother-in-law Francis of Baux, Duke of Andria, and his son James. Francis laid claim by force to the rights of Philip II, which Joanna had reverted to the crown. Joanna then confiscated his property by grounds of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; on 8 April 1374.

Joanna was now determined to undermine the position of Charles of Durazzo as a potential heir. Indeed, with the approval of Pope Gregory XI, on 25 December 1375, she signed her fourth marriage contract, with Otto, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen, who valiantly defended her rights in Piedmont. The wedding in person took place three months later, on 25 March 1376 at Castel Nuovo. Although the new husband was reduced to the status of Prince consort, Charles of Durazzo was irritated by this union and approached Louis the Great of Hungary, Joanna&#x27;s enemy.

During this time, the Western Schism developed, one of the largest fractures of Christianity in the Middle Ages. Two Popes were elected: Bartolomeo Prignano, Archbishop of Bari (who took the name of Urban VI) and Robert, Cardinal of Geneva (who became Clement VII). The first lived in Rome, the second in Avignon. After some hesitation, Joanna decided for Clement VII and supported him with 50,000 florins. Urban VI for his part encouraged the enemies of Joanna: the King of Hungary, the Duke of Andria and Charles of Durazzo. Being in a critical situation, Joanna appealed to Clement VII, who advised her to use Louis I of Anjou in her favor. France and Avignon counted on Naples to give them a foothold in Italy, if it came to resolving the schism by force. However, for Joanna, the main factor of her support to Clement VII was Urban VI&#x27;s attempts to take Naples away from her and to cede part of her Kingdom to his nephew, Francesco Prignano. On 11 May 1380 Urban VI declared her a heretic and her Kingdom, a papal fief, to be forfeit and bestowed it upon Charles of Durazzo.

In exchange for his help, Joanna adopted Louis I of Anjou as her heir on 29 June 1380, replacing Charles of Durazzo. This agreement realized the ambitions that the Duke of Anjou harboured for a long time. Charles of Durazzo then invaded Naples in November 1380 at the head of an army mainly composed by Hungarians.

Louis I of Anjou may not have understood the gravity of the situation in Naples and didn&#x27;t intervene immediately because he was forced to remain in France after his brother&#x27;s death as a regent of his nephew and new King Charles VI.
Joanna entrusted her husband Otto of Brunswick with the few troops she could muster, but he was unable to stop the forces of Charles of Durazzo, who on 28 June 1381 crossed the borders of the Kingdom of Naples. After Otto&#x27;s defeat at Anagni, and bypassing the Neapolitan defences at Aversa, Charles entered Naples on 16 July at 7 p.m. and besieged Joanna in Castel Nuovo. Without any help, Joanna was forced to surrender on 25 August and was imprisoned, firstly in Castel dell&#x27;Ovo and later, in December, she was transferred to the Castello del Parco at Nocera Inferiore.

Catherine of Siena viewed Joanna as a demonically misguided ruler due to her support for Clement VII over Urban VI. In her letter to Joanna, Catherine told Joanna to consider her temporal position invalid by supporting the Pope in Avignon: “And if I consider your condition akin to those temporal and transitory goods that pass like the wind, you yourself have deprived yourself of them by your actions.” What Catherine was referring to was the legal position of Naples in relation to the Papacy. While Joanna had been established as the legitimate ruler of the Neapolitan Kingdom, she was also under the rule of the Pope in Rome. The Neapolitan throne had been under legal oversight of the Papacy &quot;since the mid-thirteenth century, and the kingdom was a valuable source of revenue, prestige, and soldiers for the Church.&quot;

==Assassination==
Louis I of Anjou finally decided to act and went to Avignon at the head of a powerful army on 31 May 1382 in order to rescue Joanna. He passed through Turin and Milan. Towards the beginning of September, he was in Amatrice, near Rome. But by that time the Queen was already dead. Charles of Durazzo, thinking that he couldn&#x27;t resist Louis I of Anjou, decided on 28 May 1382 that Joanna should be transferred from the Castello del Parco to the Castle of Muro Lucano held by Palamede Bozzuto, where she was killed on 27 July 1382, aged 56.

In his official statement, Charles claimed Joanna died of natural causes. However, other documentary sources unanimously claim she was murdered. Because of the nature of the remote and clandestine act, the accounts of the manner in which Joanna was slain vary. The two most authentic sources:

*Thomas of Niem, secretary to Urban VI, states Joanna was strangled with a silken chord whilst kneeling in prayer in the private chapel at Muro castle by Hungarian soldiers.
*Marie of Blois, wife of Louis I of Anjou, states Joanna was killed by four men, presumably Hungarian, with her hands and feet tied and then smothered between two feather mattresses.

Since there is no testimony from witnesses present at the time of her murder, it is impossible to say definitively which of the reports is accurate. Another account states she was smothered with pillows.

Her body was brought to Naples where for several days it was put on display to the public as proof of her death. As Urban VI had excommunicated Joanna, the Queen could not be consecrated in church property and was therefore tossed into a deep well on the grounds of Santa Chiara Church. The Neapolitan Kingdom was left to decades of recurring wars of succession. Louis I of Anjou was able to retain the mainland counties of Provence and Forcalquier. James of Baux, the nephew of Philip II of Taranto, claimed the Principality of Achaea after her deposition in 1381.

==In literature==
* Giovanni Boccaccio wrote a biography of Joanna in his series of biographies known as &quot;De mulieribus claris&quot; (en: &quot;On Famous Women&quot;). Boccaccio devoted part of his biography of Joanna to dispelling any idea that Joanna was not the rightful ruler of Naples, which Boccaccio did by proclaiming that Joanna was a descendant of a noble bloodline. Boccaccio claimed that Joanna I&#x27;s bloodline could be traced all the way back to “Dardanus, the founder of Troy, whose father the ancients said was Jupiter.&quot; Boccaccio also definitively and unequivocally proclaimed Joanna to be the lawful ruler of Naples by discussing the manner in which she ascended the Neapolitan throne. Boccaccio mentioned in his biography of Joanna that she rightfully inherited the kingdom from her grandfather because Joanna&#x27;s father had died in his youth. In addition to demonstrating for his readers that Joanna was the rightful Queen of Naples, Boccaccio revealed his personal support for Joanna during the chaos of her reign and the controversy surrounding it. In Boccaccio&#x27;s view, the question of whether a woman could reign or if there were other nobles who were more fit to rule was irrelevant because of Joanna. Boccaccio also discussed her capabilities and the aspects of her reign that made her a great ruler in his eyes. When Boccaccio summarized all of the areas and provinces that Joanna ruled over, he described Naples as having remarkable towns, fruitful fields, great nobles, and great wealth, but he also emphasized that “Joanna&#x27;s spirit [was] equal to ruling it”. Additionally, Boccaccio claimed that the reason why Naples was a prosperous Kingdom was because it was no longer inhabited by the Hungarian Royal Family and their supporters whom he disliked. Boccaccio claimed that Joanna “bravely attacked and cleaned out the bands of wicked men” who had occupied Naples.
* Alexandre Dumas, &quot;père&quot; wrote a romance, &quot;Joan of Naples&quot;, part of his eight-volume series &quot;Celebrated Crimes&quot; (1839–40).
* A fictionalised account of her life can also be found in the novel &quot;Queen of Night&quot; by Alan Savage.
* László Passuth wrote a novel &quot;Napolyi Johanna&quot; (&quot;Joanna of Naples&quot;, 1968) about her life.
* Marcel Brion, &quot;La reine Jeanne&quot; (Queen Joanna), Société des Bibliophiles de Provence, 1936 (Artist&#x27;s book illustrated with etchings by Hungarian born French artist Làszlò Barta); 1944 (published by Robert Laffont).
* The Nobel Prize in Literature Frédéric Mistral wrote in 1890 the drama &quot;La Rèino Jano&quot;, narrating the passage of the Queen on her Provençal domains during her flying by Naples.

==Titles and styles==
Joanna&#x27;s full style as queen was: &quot;Joanna, by the Grace of God, Queen of Jerusalem and of Sicily, Duchess of Apulia, Princess of Capua, and Countess of Provence, Forqualquier, and Piedmont&quot;.

<doc id="204805" wikidata="Q74096" url="?curid=204805" title="Bosko the Doughboy">
<text>Bosko the Doughboy is the fourteenth title in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; series featuring Bosko It was released as early as October 10, 1931. It was directed by Hugh Harman, and the film score was composed by Frank Marsales.

==Plot==
The cartoon opens with images of explosions, gunfire, and heavy artillery; one character even fires into the camera. It is World War I, and the ever-cheerful Bosko is a doughboy eating down in a trench. Enemy fire destroys his meal, and later a picture of his girlfriend, Honey. Bosko shows a rare moment of anger but is quickly cheered up by a fellow soldier. The two begin to dance, only to be interrupted by more gunfire. Bosko finally decides to fight back and downs an enemy bomber (actually a pelican) by using a fellow soldier as a cannon. A friendly hippopotamus is shot down by heavy artillery, which Bosko destroys with a pair of Longjohns-turned-catapult. He then saves the wounded soldier by unzipping his navel and retrieving the shell inside. The projectile explodes anyway, turning the already black-faced Bosko even blacker and prompting him to exclaim &quot;Mammy!&quot; &quot;à la&quot; Al Jolson.

==Notes==
&quot;Bosko the Doughboy&quot; is notable for its departure from the standard cartoon formula of its era. Bosko is usually infallibly happy and chipper; &quot;Doughboy&quot; forces him to drop this demeanor and fight back. Other Bosko shorts concentrate primarily on Bosko cavorting with other characters in a musical wonderland; in &quot;Doughboy&quot;, Bosko can&#x27;t dance more than a few seconds before coming under enemy fire. Bosko&#x27;s cartoons generally have little to no conflict; &quot;Doughboy&quot; is nothing but fighting. In short, &quot;Bosko the Doughboy&quot; is almost a total departure from other shorts in the series (and from those of other studios of the time). It is usually regarded as a high point of the character&#x27;s cartoon career.

==Home media==
&quot;Bosko the Doughboy&quot; is available on Disc 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6 and on Uncensored Bosko: Vol 1.

<doc id="204809" wikidata="Q300356" url="?curid=204809" title="A Chinese Ghost Story">
<text>A Chinese Ghost Story () is a 1987 Hong Kong horror film starring Leslie Cheung, Joey Wong and Wu Ma, directed by Ching Siu-tung and produced by Tsui Hark. The plot is loosely based on a short story about Nie Xiaoqian from Qing dynasty writer Pu Songling&#x27;s &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot; and is also inspired by the 1960 Shaw Brothers Studio film &quot;The Enchanting Shadow&quot;. The film was popular in Hong Kong and several Asian countries, including South Korea and Japan. Although the film could not gain access to movie theaters in mainland China when it was first released, it became a cult film among young people in the mainland. At that time the film generated a phenomenal cult following among audiences, especially the generation born in the 1980s. In 2011, the Hong Kong producers screened a restored version officially in mainland China.

Most notably it boosted the stardom of Joey Wong, won Leslie Cheung popularity in Japan, and sparked a trend of folklore ghost films in the Hong Kong film industry, including two sequels, an animated film, a television series and a 2011 remake. The film was ranked number 50 of the Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures presented at the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards, the Special Jury Special Award of the 16th French Science Fiction Film Festival and the Best Film Award of the Portuguese Science Fiction Film Festival.

==Plot==
Ning Choi-san, a timid debt collector, goes to a rural town to collect taxes but fails and runs out of money. He has no choice but to take shelter in a deserted temple in the forest on the outskirts of the town. That night, he meets a beautiful and alluring young maiden, Nip Siu-sin, and falls in love with her. In the morning, however, after he recalls that night&#x27;s events, he becomes increasingly fearful and superstitious because Yin Chik-ha, a Taoist priest, told him that the people he saw in the temple are ghosts. That night, he returns to the temple and confirms his theory that Nip is actually a ghost.

Nip tells Ning her story of how she became eternally bound to the servitude of a sinister Tree Demoness. She explains that as long as her remains are buried at the foot of the tree, her spirit will be forever enslaved by the Tree Demoness. Ning attempts to free her from her suffering, so he seeks help from Yin Chik-ha. Yin fights with the Tree Demoness and attempts to free Nip&#x27;s soul but fails. As punishment for betraying her master, Nip&#x27;s soul is banished to the Underworld.

Ning is unwilling to give up on Nip and he insists that Yin help him. Yin reluctantly opens a temporary portal into the Underworld and brings Ning along to search for Nip. As the Underworld is full of spirits, they have a hard time finding her. Ning and Nip are eventually able to see each other briefly near dawn when they manage to leave the Underworld. When sunlight shines on the urn containing Nip&#x27;s cremated remains, Ning uses a curtain to shield the urn to prevent Nip&#x27;s soul from being destroyed by exposure to sunlight. Before leaving for good, she tells him that the only way to save her soul is to rebury her remains at a more auspicious burial site. Ning follows her instructions and, acting on Yin&#x27;s advice, he buries her remains near the crest of a hill. He burns a joss stick for her and prays for her soul while Yin watches solemnly behind him.

Ning and Yin are then seen riding off seeking a new adventure, with rainbow visible in the sky above them.

==Production==
Producer Tsui Hark was interested in creating &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; as early as 1978, where he suggested it as a television production at TVB. The producer turned it down, feeling it would not be suitable for television. &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; uses elements of several stories from Pu Songling&#x27;s 17th century collection &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot;. Tsui Hark stated that they changed a lot of the stories for their adaptation as they found out the stories were against their initial interpretation. On developing the film, Tsui Hark noted that director Ching Siu-tung wanted to work with him. Ching Siu-tung had previously worked as a director and an action choreographer on various Film Workshop productions such as &quot;Peking Opera Blues&quot; and &quot;A Better Tomorrow II&quot;. Hark suggested developing &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot;, describing it as a love story which Siu-tung was not as interested in developing as either a romance film or a non-horror based ghost story. Hark noted that his higher up approached him to develop the film into being about a female cop, not being aware that it was based on a book or that it was a period film. While working on the film, Hark and Siu-tung did not really know what it would end up being like, as Siu-tung was still apprehensive on creating a romance film and desired to add horror film elements. Rumours persist around the production suggesting that Tsui Hark effectively directed the film. British critic Tony Rayns stated that effectively, most Film Workshop productions were &quot;redirected or hijacked by Tsui Hark&quot; Joey Wong was a professional basketball player and model before starting her film career. Prior to working on the film, she appeared in films such as the Taiwanese production &quot;It&#x27;ll Be Very Cold at the Lakeside This Year&quot;. She would show up in a few Shaw Brothers produced Hong Kong films and Tsui Hark&#x27;s film &quot;Working Class&quot;.

Actors in the film include Leslie Cheung who was also a cantopop singer. Cheung had previously worked with Tsui Hark productions such as &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;A Better Tomorrow II&quot;. Cheung also sung the films theme song. Wu Ma had previously appeared in several Hong Kong horror film productions such as &quot;Spooky Encounters&quot;, &quot;The Dead and the Deadly&quot; and &quot;Mr. Vampire&quot;. The film used the services of Cinefex Workshop, Hong Kong&#x27;s first proper special effects studio who had previously worked on Hark&#x27;s film &quot;Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain&quot;. The film script called for a giant slithering tongue and zombies, which were developed by Cinefex technician Man Xian Liang, who taught himself stop motion animation in order to make the effects happen. James Wong contributed to the score of the film. Wong was primarily known for writing songs for pop stars and television programs and completed his first score for Hark&#x27;s &quot;Shanghai Blues&quot;.

===2011 re-release and remake===

In memory of the late Leslie Cheung, director Ching Siu-tung and producer Ng See-yuen re-released the film in cinemas across mainland China on 30 April 2011. China Radio International reported that the film was remastered with color timing that took about half a year. In addition, premieres took place in both Beijing and Shanghai. Ching Siu-tung, Ng See-yuen and Lau Siu-ming were present. However, Wu Ma and Joey Wong, who were invited, did not attend the premiere. Ching Siu-tung had difficulty tracking down Joey Wong and had to contact her through her family in Taiwan. He received a telephone call at the last minute from Wong&#x27;s father, stating that the actress was in poor health and not in good condition to attend the premiere. Wong&#x27;s father also quoted her daughter saying that acting in the film were her best memories. That same year, a a new adaptation of the short story was released. It starred Louis Koo and Crystal Liu and was directed by Wilson Yip.

==Reception and legacy==
From contemporary reviews, Walter Goodman (&quot;The New York Times&quot;) noted poor subtitling on the print he viewed, opining that &quot;If there are any Eastern profundities emanating from the temple, this Westerner did not recognize them.&quot; and that &quot;The kick you get from all this will depend on how exciting you find explosive exhibitions of extraterrestrial exercises.&quot; Kim Newman (&quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;) described the film as &quot;an excellent example of the distinctive type of ghost/horror film that has been coming out of Hong Kong for many years&quot; and that the film &quot;affords an insight into a movie mythos at least as highly developed and ritualized as the Universal horror cycle of the 30s or the Hammer films of the 50s and 60s&quot;. The film was reviewed by a critic credited as &quot;Mel&quot; in &quot;Variety&quot; who praised the film, stating that &quot;Cinema City is to be congratulated for searching original Chinese material. The art direction, costumes, cinematography and soundtrack music are all exceptional.&quot; The review went on to state that the &quot;storyline portray the beauty and grafility of life on earth&quot; which led to &quot;an entertaining love story with a tantalizing horror background, mixed with fantasy escapism that won&#x27;t insult adult viewers.&quot;

From retrospective reviews, &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the film as &quot;one of the breakthrough films of modern Hong Kong cinema&quot; and that it was &quot;dubious knockabout comedy [...] spiced with frantic set piece stunts (mid-air fights, thousand-foot tongues); not for those who value comprehensibility over panache.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film four stars out of five, noting &quot;gorgeous imagery&quot; and that it was not &quot;quite as completely demented as &quot;Mr Vampire&quot;, but it is truly strange.&quot; Donald C Willis wrote in his book &quot;Horror and Science Fiction Film IV&quot; that &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; was &quot;an entertaining fantasy extravaganza&quot; and that &quot;the movie is very inventive, occasionally even poetic, but not quite moving&quot;. John Charles gave the film an eight out of ten rating, noting that some horror elements in the film were in debt to the film &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;, but noted that the &quot;cinematography and art direction are superb, the action is invigorating, and the love story surprisingly touching, making this one of the most captivating and enjoyable fantasies of the post-New Wave period.&quot;

In mainland China, before the film was officially released in 2011, it was already widely circulated through unofficial channels- including smuggled videocassettes, pirated VCDs and DVDs, and later, video-sharing websites- and celebrated as a cult classic. The Chinese generation born in the 1980s, aka. the &quot;post-80s&quot; (), are among the most devout fans of this film, which they see as an embodiment of idealism, rebellion, nostalgia, and social criticism. Some scholars consider its comic nature, or &quot;half-seriousness,&quot; to be the main reason for this cult following.

The modern reception of the film in Hong Kong and Taiwan is positive. At the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards various Asian film critics, film makers and actors voted for the top Chinese films from Hong Kong, Taiwan and China. &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; was listed at 50th place on the list. In 2011, the Tapei Golden Horse Film Festival had 122 industry professionals take part in the survey. The voters included film scholars, festival programmers, film directors, actors and producers to vote for the 100 Greatest Chinese-Language Films. &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; tied with Jia Zhangke&#x27;s &quot;Xiao Wu&quot; (1997) and Zhang Yimou&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Qiu Ju&quot; (1992) for 35th place on the list.

<text>Heidi (; ) is a work of children&#x27;s fiction published between 1880 and 1881 by Swiss author Johanna Spyri, originally published in two parts as Heidi: Her Years of Wandering and Learning () and Heidi: How She Used What She Learned (). It is a novel about the events in the life of a 5-year-old girl in her paternal grandfather&#x27;s care in the Swiss Alps. It was written as a book &quot;for children and those who love children&quot; (as quoted from its subtitle).

&quot;Heidi&quot; is one of the best-selling books ever written and is among the best-known works of Swiss literature.

==Plot==
In the town of Domleschg lived two brothers. The older wasted the family fortune on drinking and gambling, while the younger ran away to serve in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies&#x27;s Army in Naples. Years later the younger brother returns with a son, Tobias. After Tobias serves an apprenticeship to Mels, father and son move to Dörfli (&#x27;small village&#x27; in Swiss German) in the municipality of Maienfeld. The villagers spread rumors about the father&#x27;s life in Naples. The man becomes known as The Alm-Uncle, as he lives in seclusion on the mountain Alm. Two village girls, sisters Dete and Adelheid, befriend Tobias. Adelheid and Tobias marry and have a daughter, also named Adelheid but affectionately nicknamed Heidi. Soon after, Tobias is killed in a work accident and Adelheid dies of shock. The Alm-Uncle holds this against God and becomes bitter. 

Heidi is raised by her maternal grandmother and Dete in Maienfeld. Shortly after the grandmother&#x27;s death, Dete is offered a job as a maid in the big city, and takes 5-year-old Heidi to live with the Alm-Uncle. He resents Heidi&#x27;s arrival, but the girl&#x27;s intelligence and cheerful yet unaffected demeanour soon earn his love. Heidi befriends her new neighbours: young Peter the goatherd, his mother Brigitte, and his blind maternal grandmother. With each season that passes, the mountaintop inhabitants, especially Peter and the grandmother, grow more attached to Heidi, and she to them. However, the grandfather refuses to allow Heidi to attend school, quarrelling with the local pastor and schoolmaster when they try to encourage him to do so, and Heidi is illiterate as a result.

Three years later, Dete returns to take Heidi to Frankfurt to be a hired lady&#x27;s companion to a wealthy girl named Klara Sesemann, who is unable to walk and regarded as an invalid. Klara is charmed by Heidi&#x27;s simple friendliness and her descriptions of life on the Alm, and delights in all the funny mishaps brought about by Heidi&#x27;s naïvety and lack of experience with city life, but the Sesemanns&#x27; strict housekeeper, Fräulein Rottenmeier, views the household disruptions as wanton misbehaviour, and places the free-spirited Heidi under more and more restraint, forbidding her to talk of the Alps or to cry for home. Soon, Heidi becomes terribly homesick for the Alm, and grows alarmingly pale and thin. Her one diversion is learning to read and write using a collection of Biblical stories, motivated by Klara&#x27;s grandmother Frau Sesemann who shows her trust and affection, and encourages her to believe in God and to pray. Later Frau Sesemann gifts Heidi the book.

Heidi&#x27;s homesickness leads to episodes of sleepwalking where she goes downstairs and opens the front door, which the household initially takes as the work of ghosts. The family doctor recommends she be sent home before she becomes seriously ill. She gladly returns to the mountains laden with presents for her friends and the book from Frau Sesemann, but finds one of her greatest pleasures is reading hymns to Peter&#x27;s blind grandmother, who can no longer do so for herself. Her faith in God speaks to something in the Alm-Uncle. One day Heidi reads to him &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; from a book Frau Sesemann gave her. That night Alm-Uncle prays for the first time in years. He accompanies Heidi to church, and that winter takes accommodation in the village so that she can attend school.

Heidi and Klara continue to keep in touch and exchange letters. A visit by the doctor to Heidi leads him to recommend that Klara visit Heidi, believing that the mountain environment and the wholesome companionship will do her good. Klara makes the journey the next season and spends a wonderful summer with Heidi, becoming stronger on goat&#x27;s milk and fresh mountain air. Peter, jealous of Heidi&#x27;s and Klara&#x27;s friendship, pushes her empty wheelchair down the mountain. He is soon wracked with guilt about what he did and ultimately confesses to it. Without her wheelchair, Klara has no choice but to learn to walk; she attempts to do so and is gradually successful. Her grandmother and father are overcome with joy to see Klara walking again. The Sesemann family promises to provide permanent care for Heidi, if there ever comes a time when her grandfather is no longer able to do so.

==Characters==
* Heidi: A joyful and free-spirited young girl who is orphaned as a toddler. At the beginning of the story, she is five years old. Heidi loves her grandfather (uncle Alp) and the beauty and fresh air of the mountains. Only Fräulein Rottenmeier calls her by her given name &quot;Adelheid&quot;, in some translations &quot;Adelaide&quot;.
* Grandfather: Heidi&#x27;s paternal grandfather, a cantankerous loner who lives in a hut high in the mountains. By people other than Heidi, he is called (in some translations) &quot;Uncle Alp&quot;.
* Adelheid: Heidi&#x27;s mother, she died from fever soon after her husband Tobias died. It is spelled &quot;Adelaide&quot; in some translations.
* Tobias: Heidi&#x27;s father who was killed by a beam falling on his head when Heidi was a baby.
* Dete: Heidi&#x27;s selfish and insensitive aunt, the sister of Heidi&#x27;s mother. Heidi lived with her after her parents died.

It is spelled &quot;Deta&quot; or &quot;Detie&quot; in some translations.
* Peter: A goat herder who lives with his mother and grandmother in a hut up the mountain located between the village Dörfli and the hut where Heidi&#x27;s grandfather lives. He is eleven years old at the beginning of the story. He is sullen, pessimistic, and fond of Heidi to the point of being insanely jealous of anyone around her more than him.

* Grannie: Peter&#x27;s blind grandmother, Heidi gets attached to her.
* Klara Sesemann: A frail girl who cannot walk. Her mother died when she was young. Her father is often away on business trips.

==Translations==
Thirteen English translations were done between 1882 and 1959, by British and American translators: Louise Brooks, Helen B. Dole, H.A. Melcon, Helene S. White, Marian Edwardes, Elisabeth P. Stork, Mabel Abbott, Philip Schuyler Allen, Shirley Watkins, M. Rosenbaum, Eileen Hall, and Joy Law. As of 2010, only the Brooks, Edwardes and Hall translations are still in print. The preface of the 1924 English translation was written by Adeline Zachert.

==Basis for &quot;Heidi&quot;==
In April 2010, a Swiss scholar named Peter Otto Büttner, uncovered a book written in 1830 by German author Hermann Adam von Kamp entitled &quot;Adelaide: The Girl from the Alps&quot; (German: &quot;Adelaide, das Mädchen vom Alpengebirge&quot;). The two stories share many similarities in plotline and imagery. Spyri&#x27;s biographer Regine Schindler said it was entirely possible that Spyri may have been familiar with the story, as she grew up in a literate household with many books.

==Adaptations==
===Film and television===
About 25 film or television productions of the original story have been made. The &quot;Heidi&quot; films were popular far and wide, becoming a huge hit, and the Japanese animated series became iconic in several countries around the world. The only incarnation of the Japanese-produced animated TV series to reach the English language was a dubbed feature-length compilation film using the most pivotal episodes of the television series, released on video in the United States in 1985. Although the original book describes Heidi as having dark, curly hair, she is usually portrayed as blonde.

This was the version that became notorious for interrupting an American football game that was broadcast the same day (November 17) on NBC. The game between the Oakland Raiders and the New York Jets was cut off a few minutes before the end of the game when it looked as if the Jets were going to win, but after the cutoff, the Raiders made a comeback and beat the Jets with TV viewers on the east coast missing the conclusion. TV channels displayed the final score (Oakland winning 43–32) during the film, further enraging football fans. This incident led to a policy of not ending coverage of any sports games until after their conclusion. The game has gone down in professional football lore as &quot;The Heidi Game&quot; or &quot;Heidi Bowl&quot;.

==Heidiland==

Heidiland, named after the &quot;Heidi&quot; books, is an important tourist area in Switzerland, popular especially with Japanese and Korean tourists. Maienfeld is the center of what is called Heidiland; one of the villages, formerly called Oberrofels, is actually renamed &quot;Heididorf&quot;. Heidiland is located in an area called Bündner Herrschaft; it is criticized as being a &quot;laughable, infantile cliché&quot; and &quot;a more vivid example of hyperreality&quot;.

==Sequels==
=== Literary ===
Between 1933 and 1955, French publishing company Flammarion published a new edition of &quot;Heidi&quot; along with a series of new original sequels. Despite being all published under Johanna Spyri&#x27;s name, this books were neither written nor endorsed by Spyri, but were adapted from her other works by her French translator, Charles Tritten in the 1930s and 1940s, many years after she died, while the last one was written by Nathalie Gala. The series is composed of a total of 7 books, 2 translated from Spyri&#x27;s works and 5 original. Only two of them were published in English.

# &quot;Heidi. La merveilleuse histoire d&#x27;une fille de la montagne&quot; (1933), translation of the first &quot;Heidi&quot; volume (&quot;Heidis Lehr- und Wanderjahre&quot;).
# &quot;Heidi grandit&quot; (1934), translation of the second &quot;Heidi&quot; volume (&quot;Heidi kann brauchen, was es gelernt hat&quot;) with the addition of an original ending by Charles Tritten, which announces Heidi&#x27;s further adventures.
# &quot;Heidi Grows Up&quot; (&quot;Heidi jeune fille&quot;, 1936) by Charles Tritten, it follows Heidi&#x27;s teenage years.
# &quot;Au pays de Heidi&quot; (1938) by Charles Tritten, the story is told from the perspective of Heidi&#x27;s village seen by some of its inhabitants.
# &quot;Heidi&#x27;s Children&quot; (&quot;Heidi et ses enfants&quot;, 1939) by Charles Tritten, about Heidi&#x27;s adulthood with Peter and their children.
# &quot;Heidi grand&#x27;mère&quot; (1941) by Charles Tritten, about Heidi&#x27;s later years with her grandchildren.
# &quot;Le sourire de Heidi&quot; (1955) by Nathalie Gala, a new story set once again during Heidi&#x27;s younger years.

There are some major differences between the original &quot;Heidi&quot; and the Tritten sequels. These include:

* &quot;Heidi&quot;, the original story by Spyri, shows the simple life of Heidi imbued with a deep love of children and childhood. Spyri mentioned that the work was &quot;for children and those who love children&quot;. The sequels portray Heidi in a different manner, as she grows up and gets married.
* Heidi in the first book, &quot;Heidi&quot;, is described as having &quot;short, black curly hair&quot;, when she is around five to eight years of age. In &quot;Heidi Grows Up&quot;, when she is fourteen, her hair is long, straight and fair.
* In some English editions of &quot;Heidi&quot; the names of the goats are translated into English (Little Swan and Little Bear), while other editions use their original Swiss-German names, Schwanli and Baerli. In &quot;Heidi Grows Up&quot; only the names Schwanli and Baerli are used.

=== Film ===
In 1990, screenwriters Weaver Webb and Fred &amp; Mark Brogger, and director Christopher Leitch, produced &quot;Courage Mountain&quot;, starring Charlie Sheen and Juliette Caton as Heidi. Billed as a sequel to Spyri&#x27;s story, the film is anachronistic in that it depicts Heidi as a teenager during World War I, despite the fact that the original novel (where Heidi is only five years old) was published in 1881.

==Reception==
The book has been criticised for black-and-white character portrayals and an idealization of pastoral life.

In Japan, since its first Japanese translation in 1906, the book has been influential upon the general, stereotypical image of Switzerland for the Japanese, especially its tourists, many visiting the Heidi&#x27;s Village park.

<text>Theodor Svedberg (30 August 1884 – 25 February 1971; also known as The Svedberg) was a Swedish chemist and Nobel laureate for his research on colloids and proteins using the ultracentrifuge. Svedberg was active at Uppsala University from the mid-1900s to late 1940s. While at Uppsala, Svedberg started as a docent before becoming the university&#x27;s physical chemistry head in 1912. After leaving Uppsala in 1949, Svedberg was in charge of the Gustaf Werner Institute until 1967. Apart from his 1926 Nobel Prize, Svedberg was named a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1944 and became part of the National Academy of Sciences in 1945.

==Early life and education==
Svedberg was born in Valbo, Sweden on 30 August 1884. He was the son of Augusta Alstermark and Elias Svedberg. Growing up, Svedberg enjoyed botany and other branches of science. While in grammar school, Svedberg conducted individual laboratorial research and performed scientific demonstrations. For his post-secondary education, Svedberg entered a chemistry program at Uppsala University in the early mid 1900s. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1905, his master&#x27;s degree in 1907, and in 1908, he earned his Ph.D.

==Career==
While at Uppsala, Svedberg started his scientific career in 1905 as an assistant chemist with the university. After becoming a chemistry docent for Uppsala in 1907, he became the university&#x27;s physical chemistry head in 1912. For his academic tenure, Svedberg remained with Upsala until 1949. During the early 1920s, he also temporarily taught for the University of Wisconsin. After leaving Uppsala, Svedberg led the Gustaf Werner Institute from 1949 to 1967.

==Research==
Svedberg&#x27;s work with colloids supported the theories of Brownian motion put forward by Albert Einstein and the Polish physicist Marian Smoluchowski. During this work, he developed the technique of analytical ultracentrifugation, and demonstrated its utility in distinguishing pure proteins one from another.

==Awards and honours==
The unit svedberg (symbol S), a unit of time amounting to 10−13 s or 100 fs, is named after him, as well as The Svedberg Laboratory in Uppsala.

Svedberg&#x27;s candidacy for the Royal Society reads:

Svedberg was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1941. After becoming a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1944, Svedberg was named to the National Academy of Sciences in 1945. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1948. From the 1910s to 1920s, Svedberg was awarded the Björkénska priset three times from Uppsala University for his contributions to science in Sweden. From the Franklin Institute, Svedberg was given the Franklin Medal in 1949 for his work with the ultracentrifuge.

==Death and personal life==
On 25 February 1971, Svedberg died in Kopparberg, Sweden. He was married four times and had a total of twelve children. His widow died in 2019.

<text>Valentin Sergeyevich Pavlov (; 26 September 1937 – 30 March 2003) was a Soviet official who became a Russian banker following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Born in the city of Moscow, then part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Pavlov began his political career in the Ministry of Finance in 1959. Later, during the Brezhnev Era, he became head of the Financial Department of the State Planning Committee. Pavlov was appointed to the post of Chairman of the State Committee on Prices during the Gorbachev Era, and later became Minister of Finance in Nikolai Ryzhkov&#x27;s second government. He went on to succeed Ryzhkov as head of government in the newly established post of Prime Minister of the Soviet Union.

As Prime Minister Pavlov initiated the 1991 Soviet monetary reform, commonly referred to as the Pavlov reform, in early 1991. Early on he told the media that the reform was initiated to halt the flow of Soviet rubles transported to the Soviet Union from abroad. Although ridiculed at the time, the statement was later proven to be true. In June the same year, Pavlov called for a transfer of power from the President of the Soviet Union to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers. When that failed, he joined a plot to oust Gorbachev. In August, he participated in the 1991 Soviet coup d&#x27;état attempt, which tried to prevent the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Pavlov was arrested for his involvement in the coup and went on to work in the banking sector in post-Soviet Russia. He can be seen as the last legitimate Soviet head of government since his successor, Ivan Silayev, was appointed by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in breach of what were the Soviet constitutional principles.

==Early life and career==
Born in Moscow, Pavlov graduated from the Moscow Finance Institute in 1958. He started his &quot;nomenklatura&quot; (bureaucratic) career as a government economist; he started working for as an official of the Ministry of Finance in 1959, and became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1962. Early in his career he also worked for the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). Pavlov started working for the State Planning Committee in 1979, and became a member of the State Planning Committee&#x27;s board in 1981. He held the office as head of the State Planning Committee&#x27;s Finance Department, the department which oversaw all aspects of the country&#x27;s planned economy. He served as First Deputy Minister of Finance in Boris Gostev&#x27;s ministry from January to August 1986.

Pavlov was appointed Chairman of the State Committee on Prices on 15 August 1986, and retained that post until 7 June 1989. Throughout the period, and later as Minister of Finance, Pavlov supported the centralized price reform proposal posited by Nikolai Ryzhkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers. He succeeded Gostev to become Minister of Finance in Ryzhkov&#x27;s government in 1989 and his time in the post was considered uncontroversial, even though Lira Rozenova, Deputy Chairman of the State Committee for Prices, was not elected to the post of Chairman of the State Committee for her advocacy of Pavlov-backed plans for centrally administered price reform. He was the only minister in Ryzhkov&#x27;s Government who was also a member of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.

Along with Eduard Shevardnadze – Soviet Foreign Minister – Pavlov was the only nominee from Ryzhkov&#x27;s second government to be overwhelmingly elected by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. As Minister of Finance, Pavlov was supportive of the marketization of the Soviet economy, having overseen a rapid increase in the Soviet money supply and the increase in inflation it caused. Pavlov also set the exchange rate for the ruble against the American dollar on the Soviet black market. In 1993 he proudly admitted that during his tenure as Minister of Finance, and later Prime Minister, he had deceived several Western banks and creditors by lying about the Soviet Union&#x27;s gold reserves. In 1989, Pavlov gathered together enough information on the errors and omissions of Ivan Silayev, the future Soviet Premier and Russian SFSR Premier, to weaken his position as Deputy Premier. Silayev never forgave Pavlov and relations between the two grew even more icy when Pavlov became Soviet Premier.

==Prime minister==

Following the resignation of Nikolai Ryzhkov following a heart attack in December 1990, Pavlov was elected to the new position of Prime Minister as a compromise candidate, and became chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers. He and his two First Deputy Prime Ministers, Vladimir Velichko and Vitaly Doguzhiev, were approved and elected by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on 14 January, with 279 votes in favor, 75 against, and 66 abstained, while approval for the majority of his ministers followed within a few weeks. Pavlov was considered a conservative upon his election as Prime Minister, and the Soviet press described him as a &quot;bold and complex man&quot; who was against full marketization but who believed that the Soviet Union was even more oppressive towards workers than even the most advanced capitalist societies. One of his first actions as Prime Minister was to move the headquarters of the Soviet Government – the Cabinet of Ministers – from the Moscow Kremlin to the former headquarters of the State Committee for Construction to strengthen his position.

=== 1991 monetary reform ===
The Soviet monetary reform of 1991, commonly referred to as the &quot;Pavlov reform&quot;, was the last monetary reform prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, despite having made a speech 2 weeks before, saying there would be no such reforms. Initiated on 22 January 1991, it was intended to withdraw money from circulation for reallocation to the production of consumer goods, which were in short supply. In a speech, Pavlov stated that the reason for the withdrawal was the government&#x27;s belief that money was being sent to the Soviet Union from abroad, fueling inflation. Although ridiculed by the Soviet press at the time, three years later the truth of Pavlov&#x27;s statement was verified. Mikhail Gorbachev then signed a presidential decree ordering the Soviet financial system to stop accepting and exchanging banknotes issued in 1961. The directive also included 50-ruble and 100-ruble banknotes issued in 1991. On 23 January 1991, the government began restricting monthly bank deposit withdrawals to 500 rubles with the official explanation that this was to freeze the income of corrupt officials, capitalists and criminals.

Under the orders of Pavlov, the Government freed forty percent of prices on 1 January 1991, and introduced sales tax of 5%. Prices of consumer goods, in particular, were now considered free in the sense that negotiation became possible between producers and the distributor. According to Philip Hanson in his book, &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Soviet economy: An Economic History of the USSR from 1945&quot;, Pavlov&#x27;s reform was undermined by the Union Republics who failed to follow Pavlov&#x27;s orders, along with the widespread existence of local monopolies, which tended to have their own definition of luxury goods and as a result imposed higher prices on such items.

Soviet citizens had only three days from 23 to 25 January to exchange their old 50 ruble and 100 ruble banknotes for the new currency. Exchange could be postponed, but only through specialized government commissions. Due to this short exchange window, long queues formed in front of Soviet savings banks, even though it was also possible to exchange money at workplaces and post offices. This reform also dealt a crippling blow to Soviet citizens who had saved their money and could not move fast enough to get it exchanged; some lost as much as 15,000 - 30,000 rubles overnight.

In the end the reform proved unsuccessful. The government only managed to withdraw 14 billion rubles from circulation of the country&#x27;s money supply against an intended target of 81.5 billion rubles. As a result, the Pavlov reform did not put an end to inflation. Prices for items including food and transport rose by 100–300 percent, while the Soviet standard of living decreased sharply and the state budget deficit increased by an estimated 20–30 percent of GNP. In the aftermath of the reform, inflation exceeded the 50 percent mark every month.

In April, he presented an &quot;Anticrisis Plan&quot;, calling for a ban on strikes, the suspension of laws in the republics that contradicted Soviet law, a special management regime for the power, communication and transport industries, penalties against republics that failed to fulfil financial obligations to the centre (and the freezing of all contradictory decisions by republican and local officials and punishment for officials who fail to carry out orders), accelerated denationalisation of small enterprises and services, giving state run enterprises freedom of action, radical budget cuts, freeing prices, lifting control on wages levels, stabilization of the Soviet Ruble, and channelling of new resources into agriculture. Many economists said it wouldn&#x27;t work.

===Coup attempt===
In June 1991, Pavlov, who felt that the office of Prime Minister had limited power, discovered that Gorbachev planned to replace him as Prime Minister. In response, he arrived at the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union &quot;visibly nervous&quot;, and in his report to the Supreme Soviet, he was forced to tell delegates of the faltering state of the Soviet economy. However, Pavlov blamed this on the ongoing War of Laws between the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), which, he argued, could be resolved by introducing a state of emergency across the entire Soviet Union, or at least in certain economic sectors.

According to Pavlov, the union&#x27;s problems remained insoluble as long as Gorbachev retained so much power and had limited time to address important issues. To break the impasse, Pavlov called for a transfer of power from the President of the Soviet Union to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers, (specifically, he wanted the Cabinet to have the right to issue decrees on economic affairs without the approval of the president, to propose legislation on its own, a larger role in social and economic policy making, control over the Gosbank and he taxation inspectorate, and a special mandate to go after organized crime), even creating a five-point resolution to that end for the legislature to consider. Pavlov received support for the idea from the Soyuz parliamentary faction leader Viktor Alksnis, who called for an immediate vote on the issue. However, several members of Soyuz also demanded a statement by the KGB and the Ministry of Defense to comment on the proposal. In retrospect, Alksnis notes that this resolution could have become a coup d&#x27;état had Pavlov consulted with them earlier. According to historian Jerry F. Hough, Pavlov&#x27;s program &quot;was not directed as much at Gorbachev as at [Boris] Yeltsin&quot;.

By the afternoon, the majority of Soyuz members favored an immediate vote. The Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Anatoly Lukyanov, had already departed for Novo-Ogaryovo to take part in constitutional negotiations and he promised to tell Gorbachev about the vote. In his place stood Ivan Laptev, a pro-Gorbachev reformer, who did not trust Lukyanov and tried to stall the vote by demanding a statement from the KGB, Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense. According to Laptev, the mood was such that if a vote had been taken Pavlov would have won. At the time, both the Soviet secret police and the military establishment in general wanted to strengthen the authority of the Soviet Government and so they too supported Pavlov&#x27;s program. Soyuz, through a vote, was able to increase the powers of the Cabinet of Ministers, and gave the institution the right of legislative initiative.

Shortly afterwards, Jack F. Matlock Jr., United States ambassador to the Soviet Union, told Gorbachev of the possibility of a coup attempt against him, and the Soviet leader became worried when Anatoly Chernyaev informed him of mysterious troop movements outside Moscow. On 21 June, four days after Pavlov&#x27;s speech, Gorbachev addressed the Supreme Soviet and told delegates that there were no differences in opinion between him and Pavlov. Even when he had been able to secure his position, Gorbachev&#x27;s power within the system was already faltering, although he succeeded in getting the enhanced powers previously given to the Cabinet of Ministers reversed. The power struggle between Gorbachev and Pavlov was not over, with Gorbachev, on July 29, 1991, promising Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev that Pavlov, along with Dmitry Yazov, Minister of Defense, and Vladimir Kryuchkov, the Chairman of the KGB, would be removed from their posts following the signing and ratification of the New Union Treaty, with Nazarbayev to be appointed in Pavlov&#x27;s place as Prime Minister.

===August Coup===

The 1991 Soviet coup d&#x27;état attempt was prompted by the slow disintegration of the Soviet Union that resulted from Gorbachev&#x27;s reform policy and Yeltsin&#x27;s drive towards an independent Russia. The New Union Treaty being prepared called for further decentralization of power to the republics, which weakened the government&#x27;s already tenuous hold on the economy. Pavlov received a draft of the New Union Treaty on 12 August at a Security Council meeting and managed to get it published in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Moscow News&quot; on 14 August.

Opposing the decentralization stance taken in the treaty, Pavlov was one of the key players in the establishment of the State Committee on the State of Emergency in August 1991. Pavlov&#x27;s inclusion in the committee has been used to demonstrate its unwillingness to revert to pre-Gorbachev policies. The committee&#x27;s main goal was to ensure that the Soviet Union continued as a highly centralized union state. The Emergency Committee was led by Gennady Yanayev, Vice President of the Soviet Union, Interior Minister Boris Pugo, Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov and other hardliners who were determined to take action to oust Gorbachev. Vladimir Kryuchkov, the KGB Chairman, had told Pavlov of the coup on 18 August, one day before it began. He was asked by Kryuchkov to meet his co-plotters at the Moscow Kremlin, where on 19 August, he and his co-conspirators appeared on live television and told the Soviet people that Gorbachev was indisposed. As the day wore on it soon became apparent that Pavlov had been drinking since he issued several contradictory orders and repeated himself. In retrospect he admitted that he had been drinking with his son the day before. On the same day, his fellow plotters decided to depose Pavlov, sending him to his dacha where his wife took care of him. As with all the others, Pavlov was arrested following the collapse of the coup. Shortly after Pavlov was hospitalized with hypertension whilst remaining in custody. He was released on recognizance not to leave in January 1993 and granted amnesty by the Russian State Duma in 1994.

==Later life and death==

After his release from custody, Pavlov became a director of the commercial bank Chasprombank between 1994 and 1995. He resigned at the request of the bank&#x27;s board of directors, who informed him that they had decided &quot;to provide him an indefinite leave of absence.&quot; In February 1996, shortly after his resignation, the bank&#x27;s license was revoked for violating the banking laws set up by the Central Bank of Russia. Pavlov then worked as an advisor to Promstroybank between 1996 and 1997, and in 1998 also became a vice president of the American firm Business Management Systems. He worked both as vice president of both the Free Economic Society and the International Academy of Management and later headed a department of the International Union of Economists.

Pavlov died in Moscow on 30 March 2003, and was buried on 2 April at Pyatnitskoye Cemetery.

<text>Yolanda Saldívar () is an American former nurse who murdered Tejano singer Selena on March 31, 1995 in Corpus Christi, Texas. Born in San Antonio, Saldívar had been the president of Selena&#x27;s fan club and the manager of her boutiques, but she lost both positions a short time before the murder, when the singer&#x27;s family discovered that she had been embezzling money from both organizations. 

Three days after the jury found her guilty of murder, they sentenced Saldívar to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after 30 years; a parole hearing is currently scheduled for March 30, 2025.

==Biography==
Saldívar is one of seven children born to Frank and Juanita Saldívar.

===Selena fan club===
Saldívar, a former nurse, was a fan of country music. After attending one of Selena&#x27;s concerts, she began repeatedly calling Selena&#x27;s father, Abraham Quintanilla, about starting a fan club in San Antonio. Quintanilla eventually gave in to Saldívar&#x27;s requests and she immediately became the club&#x27;s president.

Saldívar was eventually promoted as manager of Selena&#x27;s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc. By 1993, the fan club had reached 1,500 members in less than four years, and eventually grew to over 5,000. It became one of the largest fan clubs in the San Antonio area.

==Murder of Selena==

In early 1995, Selena&#x27;s family discovered that Saldívar had been embezzling money from both the fan club and boutiques, which led to her getting fired in the first week of March. On the morning of March 31, Selena agreed to meet Saldívar at a Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi to retrieve financial records Saldívar had been refusing to turn over. Saldívar delayed the handover by claiming she had been raped in Mexico. Selena drove Saldívar to a local hospital, where they were told that the gynecological exam was to be done elsewhere, because the assault had allegedly happened in another country. 

They returned to the motel, where Selena once more demanded the records. Saldívar then took a .38 Taurus Model 85 revolver from her purse and pointed it at the singer. Selena tried to flee, but Saldívar shot her once in the back, severing an artery. Critically wounded, Selena ran towards the lobby for help with Saldívar in pursuit calling her a &quot;bitch&quot;. 

Selena collapsed on the floor as the clerk called 911. She later died in a hospital from blood loss at 1:05pm.

==Trial and imprisonment==
Saldívar&#x27;s trial for the murder of Selena was followed closely by the Latino community in the United States. The trial was not televised, but cameras were permitted on the courthouse premises. The venue was moved to Houston, Texas, after Saldívar&#x27;s lawyers successfully argued that she could not receive a fair trial in Selena&#x27;s hometown.

Before the start of the trial, CNN reported that prosecutors were expected to introduce a controversial police confession signed by Saldívar in which she said she shot Selena &quot;during an argument over accusations from the singer&#x27;s father that Saldívar stole money from Selena&#x27;s accounts&quot;. The defense was expected to introduce testimony from Texas Ranger Robert Garza that &quot;he overheard Saldívar claim the shooting was accidental, and that she objected when police failed to include it in her statement&quot;.

The defense attorney argued the shooting was accidental, but the prosecution pointed out that Saldívar, a trained nurse, did not call 911 or try to help Selena after she was shot.

Jurors deliberated for less than three hours on October23, 1995, before finding Saldívar guilty of murder. Three days later, on October26, she was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in thirty years; this was the maximum prison term allowed in Texas at the time. On November 22, 1995, she arrived at the Gatesville Unit (now the Christina Melton Crain Unit) in Gatesville, Texas, to be processed.

Saldívar is currently serving a life sentence at the Patrick O&#x27;Daniel Unit in Gatesville, operated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. She will become eligible for parole on March30, 2025.

==After the conviction==
The revolver used to kill Selena disappeared after the trial. It was later found in a box of office supplies at the home of court reporter Sandra Oballe, who has said she did not realize she had the weapon. Despite objections from some historical groups, it was dismantled and the pieces were thrown into Corpus Christi Bay in 2002.

Saldívar has asked the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to accept a petition that challenges her conviction. She claims the petition was filed in 2000 with the 214th District Court, but was never sent to the higher court. Her request was received on March31, 2008, the 13th anniversary of Selena&#x27;s death.

==In popular culture==
Saldívar was portrayed by Lupe Ontiveros in the film &quot;Selena&quot;, by Damayanti Quintanar in &quot;Selena&#x27;s Secret&quot;, a series based on the book of the same name, and by Natasha Perez in the Netflix original series, &quot;&quot;. In 2017, Saldívar was portrayed by E. A. Costillo in the television documentary &quot;Murder Made Me Famous&quot;.

<doc id="204839" wikidata="Q289204" url="?curid=204839" title="Lost Highway (film)">
<text>Lost Highway is a 1997 neo-noir film directed by David Lynch, who co-wrote the screenplay with Barry Gifford. It stars Bill Pullman, Patricia Arquette, and Balthazar Getty. The film also features Robert Blake, Jack Nance, and Richard Pryor in their final film performances. The narrative follows a musician (Pullman) who begins receiving unmarked videotapes of himself and his wife (Arquette) at their home before he is suddenly convicted of murder. While imprisoned, he mysteriously disappears and is replaced by a young mechanic (Getty) leading a different life.

Financed by French production company Ciby 2000 and Lynch&#x27;s own Asymmetrical Productions, the film was largely shot in Los Angeles, where Lynch collaborated with frequent producer Mary Sweeney and cinematographer Peter Deming. The film&#x27;s surreal narrative structure has been likened to a Möbius strip, while Lynch has described it as a &quot;psychogenic fugue&quot; rather than a conventionally logical story. The film&#x27;s soundtrack was produced by Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor, featuring an original score by Angelo Badalamenti and Barry Adamson as well as contributions from Nine Inch Nails, David Bowie, Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, and the Smashing Pumpkins.

Upon release, &quot;Lost Highway&quot; received mixed reviews and grossed $3.7 million in North America after a modest three-week run. Most critics initially dismissed the film as incoherent; it has since garnered a cult following and scholarly interest. It is the first of three Lynch films set in Los Angeles, followed by &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; (2001) and his final film &quot;Inland Empire&quot; (2006). The film was adapted into an opera by Austrian composer Olga Neuwirth in 2003.

==Plot==
Saxophonist Fred Madison receives a cryptic message on his intercom in the Hollywood Hills: &quot;Dick Laurent is dead.&quot; Moments later, he hears tires screeching and sirens racing past his house. The next morning, his wife Renee finds a VHS tape on their porch showing eerie footage of their house. That night, Fred struggles during intimacy with Renee and confesses he dreamed of her being attacked. As he looks at her, he briefly sees the face of a pale, old man.

The following day, another tape arrives, this time showing footage of Fred and Renee asleep in their bed. They call the police, but the detectives offer little help.

Fred and Renee attend a party hosted by her friend Andy. At the party, Fred encounters a strange, pale man—The Mystery Man—who claims they&#x27;ve met before. The man also insists he is currently at Fred&#x27;s house and demonstrates this by answering Fred&#x27;s call to his home phone. Andy identifies the man as an acquaintance of Dick Laurent. Unnerved, Fred leaves the party with Renee.

The next morning, a new tape arrives, showing Fred standing over Renee&#x27;s dismembered body. Fred is arrested and sentenced to death for her murder.

On death row, Fred experiences intense headaches and visions of the Mystery Man and a burning cabin in the desert, before being enveloped in light. During a cell check, the guards discover that Fred has inexplicably been replaced by Pete Dayton, a young auto mechanic from Van Nuys. Pete, seemingly unaware of how he ended up there, is released to his parents but remains under surveillance by detectives.

Pete returns to work, where his gangster client Mr. Eddy visits for car repairs. Mr. Eddy takes Pete on a drive and violently assaults a man for tailgating. The next day, Mr. Eddy arrives at the garage with his mistress, Alice Wakefield. Later that night, Alice returns alone and seduces Pete, initiating an affair.

Alice grows fearful that Mr. Eddy suspects them and devises a plan to rob Andy and flee town. Meanwhile, Pete&#x27;s girlfriend Sheila discovers the affair and leaves him. Later, Pete receives a disturbing call from Mr. Eddy and the Mystery Man, which pushes him to agree to Alice&#x27;s plan.

At Andy&#x27;s house, Pete confronts him, but Andy accidentally dies after falling onto a glass table. Pete discovers a photograph of Dick, Andy, Alice, and Renee together, which triggers a nosebleed. Disoriented, Pete retreats to the bathroom but finds himself wandering the hallways of a hotel instead.

Pete and Alice arrive at a remote desert cabin to fence stolen goods. During sex outside, Alice taunts Pete, saying, &quot;You&#x27;ll never have me,&quot; before disappearing into the cabin. In a flash of light, Pete transforms back into Fred.

Fred searches the cabin and finds the Mystery Man, who tells him there is no Alice, only Renee. The Mystery Man pursues Fred with a video camera, but Fred escapes.

Fred tracks down Dick Laurent at the Lost Highway Motel, where Laurent is with Renee having sex. After Renee leaves, Fred kidnaps Laurent, taking him to the desert. The Mystery Man reappears and hands Fred a knife, which he uses to slit Laurent&#x27;s throat. Laurent, confused, asks what they want. The Mystery Man plays a video of a pornographic film Laurent produced, featuring Renee as a participant. In cutaways, Renee and Laurent watch the film, aroused. Back in the desert, the Mystery Man shoots Laurent with a pistol, whispers something inaudible to Fred, and vanishes, leaving Fred with the gun.

When police investigate Andy&#x27;s death, Alice is inexplicably absent from the photograph Pete found. Fred drives to his home, buzzes the intercom, and declares, &quot;Dick Laurent is dead.&quot; As detectives arrive, Fred flees, leading them on a frantic chase through the desert. Amid flashes of light and distorted screams, Fred&#x27;s fate dissolves into the darkness of the highway.

==Cast==
==Style and influences==
Although &quot;Lost Highway&quot; is generally classified as a neo-noir film, the film borrows elements from other genres, including German Expressionism and French New Wave. The terms psychological thriller and horror film have also been used to describe its narrative elements. Writing for the Australian &quot;Metro Magazine&quot;, Thomas Caldwell described Fred Madison as &quot;a typical film noir hero, inhabiting a doomed and desolate world characterised by an excess of sexuality, darkness and violence.&quot; Another film noir feature that is present in the film is the femme fatale (Alice Wakefield), who misleads Pete Dayton into dangerous situations. The film was also noted for its graphic violence and sexual themes. Lynch defended these images, stating that he was simply being honest with his own ideas for the film.
Some of the film&#x27;s elements reference earlier works: the 1945 film &quot;Detour&quot; also focuses on a disturbed nightclub musician. The film&#x27;s setting and mysterious recorded messages were seen as a reference to the 1955 film &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;, while its nightmarish atmosphere has been compared to Maya Deren&#x27;s 1943 short film &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot;. Like Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1958 film &quot;Vertigo&quot;, the film examines male obsessions with women who merely represent emotions that relate to them. Some viewers consider the film an homage to Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s 1890 short story &quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge&quot;, in which much of the main narrative is imagined by the protagonist as he is executed.

==Themes==
The film&#x27;s circular narrative has been likened to a Möbius strip. Lynch has described it as a &quot;psychogenic fugue&quot; and insisted that, while the film is about &quot;identity&quot;, it is abstract and is left to the audience to interpret. He does not favor advancing a specific interpretation. However, when asked in a 1997 interview whether Pullman&#x27;s character is &quot;trapped in this time loop, doomed to repeat his murders and mistakes for ever and ever,&quot; Lynch replied, “Well, maybe not forever and ever, but you can see how it would be a struggle. Yeah, that&#x27;s it.&quot; He agreed with a comparison to the Buddhist conception of reincarnation, elaborating that &quot;it’s a fragment of the story. It’s not so much a circle as like a spiral that comes around, the next loop a little bit higher than the one that precedes it.&quot;

Gifford, in contrast, thinks that the film offers a rational explanation to its surreal events. According to him, Fred Madison is experiencing a literal psychogenic fugue, a mental break which is manifested when he transforms into Pete. Arquette described her own interpretation: &quot;to me, it&#x27;s sort of a movie about looking at women through the eyes of a misogynist... so he&#x27;s totally obsessed with her, can&#x27;t love her enough, can&#x27;t have her to himself enough, can&#x27;t kill her enough times.&quot; She later elaborated: &quot;He hates women, he doesn&#x27;t quite trust her, even though she is his wife. He kills her but can&#x27;t remember it, then he recreates himself as this virile young man and meets her again. And now, she actually wants to fuck him and she is in love with him. But even in this version, she is a dirty whore. In this man&#x27;s mind, a woman is always the monster. No matter what.&quot; 

Philosopher and critic Slavoj Žižek considered the narrative&#x27;s circularity as analogous to a psychoanalytic process: &quot;there is a symptomatic key phrase [&quot;Dick Laurent is dead&quot;] (as in all of Lynch&#x27;s films) that always returns as an insistent, traumatic, and indecipherable message (the Real), and there is a temporal loop, as with analysis, where the protagonist at first fails to encounter the self, but in the end is able to pronounce the symptom consciously as his own.&quot; He also interprets the film&#x27;s bipartite structure as exploiting &quot;the opposition of two horrors: the phantasmatic horror of the nightmarish noir universe of perverse sex, betrayal, and murder, and the (perhaps much more unsettling) despair of our drab, alienated daily life of impotence and distrust.&quot;

==Production==
===Development===

&quot;Lost Highway&quot; was directed by David Lynch as his first feature film since &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; (1992), a prequel to his television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990–1991). He came across the phrase &quot;lost highway&quot; in the book &quot;Night People&quot; (1992) by Barry Gifford. Because Lynch knew the writer well and had previously adapted his novel &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (1990) into a film of the same name, he told him that he loved the phrase as a title for a movie. The two agreed to write a screenplay together, each having their own ideas of what &quot;Lost Highway&quot; should be. They ended up rejecting all of them. Lynch then told Gifford that, during the last night of shooting &quot;Fire Walk with Me&quot;, he had a thought about videotapes and a couple in crisis. This idea would develop into the first part of the film until Fred Madison is put on death row. Lynch and Gifford then realized that a transformation had to occur and another story, which would have several links to the first one but also differ, developed. It took them one month to finish the script.

&quot;Lost Highway&quot; was partially inspired by the murder trial of O. J. Simpson and Simpson&#x27;s ability to return to his normal life afterward. The film&#x27;s opening scene, where Fred Madison hears the words &quot;Dick Laurent is dead&quot; over his intercom, was inspired by an analogous incident that happened to Lynch at his own house. Because his house was next to actor David Lander&#x27;s house and both men have the same first name, Lynch thought the stranger must have been wrong about the address. The idea of the Mystery Man &quot;came out of a feeling of a man who, whether real or not, gave the impression that he was supernatural,&quot; Lynch explained. The film was financed by the French production company Ciby 2000. Lynch&#x27;s Asymmetrical Productions, whose offices are near his house in the Hollywood Hills, was also involved in the film&#x27;s production.

===Casting===
Lynch cast Bill Pullman, a friend and neighbor of his, as the film&#x27;s central character. Actress Patricia Arquette agreed to be cast as Renee and Alice because she was interested in portraying a sexually desirable and dangerous woman, a role she had never done before. She had also been a fan of Lynch for a long time and felt that it would be an honor to work with him. Actor Balthazar Getty was chosen for the role of Pete Dayton after Lynch saw a picture of him in a magazine and said that he was &quot;the guy for the job&quot;. Because the script was so open to interpretation, Getty and Arquette did not know what kind of film &quot;Lost Highway&quot; was supposed to be. According to Getty, &quot;Part of David&#x27;s technique is to keep his actors guessing, because it creates a certain atmosphere on set.&quot;

Actor Robert Blake was cast as The Mystery Man because Lynch liked his previous work and was always interested in working with him. Although Blake did not understand the script at all, he was responsible for the look and style of his character. When Lynch told him to use his imagination, Blake decided to cut his hair short, part it in the middle, shave his eyebrows, and apply white Kabuki make-up on his face. He then put on a black outfit and approached Lynch, who loved what he had done. Actor Robert Loggia, who had previously expressed interest in playing the role of Frank Booth in Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, was cast as Mr. Eddy and Dick Laurent. Lynch recalled that, upon learning of Dennis Hopper&#x27;s casting as Booth, Loggia launched a profanity-laden rant at him, which would eventually become Mr. Eddy&#x27;s road rage scene. &quot;Lost Highway&quot; also features the final motion picture performance of Richard Pryor.

===Filming and editing===

&quot;Lost Highway&quot; was shot in Los Angeles, California, in about 54 days, from November 29, 1995, to February 22, 1996. Some of the film&#x27;s exterior and driving scenes were shot in Griffith Park, while the scenes of the Lost Highway Hotel were filmed at the Amargosa Opera House and Hotel in Death Valley. Lynch owned the property that was used for Fred and Renee&#x27;s mansion, which is located on the same street as his own house in the Hollywood Hills. The house was configured in a particular way to meet the requirements of the film. A corridor that leads to the bedroom was added and the façade was remodeled with slot windows to make Fred&#x27;s point of view very limited. The paintings that are on the wall above the couch were done by Lynch&#x27;s ex-wife and producer Mary Sweeney.

The scenes that involved nudity and sexual contact proved to be very difficult for Arquette, who considers herself a modest and shy person. Nevertheless, she felt protected by Lynch and the film crew, who would always give her robes at any time. The love scene between her and Getty in the desert, which was shot on a dry lake bed 20 miles outside Baker, was a closed set and only key crew were allowed on it. The sequence where Fred transforms into Pete was not computer-generated, but rather accomplished with in-camera techniques: a makeup expert constructed a fake head that was covered with artificial brain matter, which was then intercut with shots of Pullman. The final car chase was shot with two different cameras running at different frame rates. The footage was then sped up to make the scene more aggressive.

Lynch worked with cinematographer Peter Deming to give the film a surreal look. Because the script did not include many descriptions, the film&#x27;s visual approach evolved as filming progressed. Deming would occasionally pull out the lenses of his camera to defocus a particular scene, while Lynch would often listen to music in his headset and to a scene at the same time to visualize the screenplay. According to him, &quot;Sound and picture working together is what films are [...] So every single sound has to be supporting that scene and enlarging it. A room is, say, nine by twelve, but when you&#x27;re introducing sound to it, you can create a space that&#x27;s giant&quot;. The notion of a psychogenic fugue was incorporated into the film after the unit publicist read it up on a book about mental illnesses. Lynch felt it was a musical term, stating that &quot;a fugue starts off one way, takes up on another direction, and then comes back to the original, so it [relates] to the form of the film.&quot;

Originally, Lynch wanted to shoot &quot;Lost Highway&quot; in black and white, but the idea was discarded due to the financial risks it could cause. Nevertheless, the film was shot in varying levels of darkness and features few daylight scenes. Some sequences became so dark that it was difficult for viewers to see what was happening. According to Deming, &quot;The thing I wanted to achieve was giving the feeling that anything could come out of the background, and to leave a certain question about what you&#x27;re looking at. The film is working under the surface while you&#x27;re watching it.&quot; The film&#x27;s darkness was intentionally not adjusted during post-production. The first cut of the film ran two and a half hours, and a test audience of 50 people was given a preview to give Lynch an idea of what needed to be cut. The film was ultimately cut down to two hours and ten minutes. Most of the deleted scenes were about Pete&#x27;s life, including a scene where Pete would go out with his friends to a drive-in before going to the bowling alley.

===Soundtrack===

The film&#x27;s original score was composed by Angelo Badalamenti, with additional music by Barry Adamson. Badalamenti had previously worked with Lynch on &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; and &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. Although most of the score was recorded in Prague, additional compositions were done in London. In New Orleans, Lynch collaborated with musician Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails to provide additional music. Together, they created music that accompanied the scenes in which Fred and Renee watch the mysterious VHS tapes. Two songs by Reznor and Nine Inch Nails, &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; and &quot;Driver Down&quot;, were specifically composed for the film. Reznor then produced a soundtrack album that includes the film&#x27;s score and songs by artists such as David Bowie, Lou Reed, Marilyn Manson, The Smashing Pumpkins, and Rammstein.

Marilyn Manson&#x27;s contributions include their cover of Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins&#x27; &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;, which was previously released on their 1995 EP &quot;Smells Like Children&quot;, and &quot;Apple of Sodom&quot;, which was specifically written for the film. The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; frontman Billy Corgan wrote &quot;Eye&quot; after Lynch rejected an early version of &quot;Tear&quot; from the band&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Adore&quot;. Two songs by Rammstein—&quot;Rammstein&quot; and &quot;Heirate Mich&quot;—were included after Lynch listened to their 1995 debut album &quot;Herzeleid&quot; while exploring locations for the film. The track &quot;Insensatez&quot;, an instrumental version of the bossa nova song &quot;How Insensitive&quot; by Antônio Carlos Jobim, was also included as part of the film&#x27;s soundtrack. The album, which was released on November 26, 1996, reached No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and was certified Gold status in the US and Platinum in Canada.

==Release==
===Box office===

&quot;Lost Highway&quot; was released in France on January 15, 1997. The film received its North American premiere in January 1997 at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. The film was then given a limited release in 12 theaters on February 21, 1997, grossing nearly $213,000 at the US box office weekend. The film expanded a week later in 212 theaters and, after a modest three-week run, went on to make $3.7 million in North America. &quot;Lost Highway&quot; was released in Russia on May 19, 2017, and grossed $28,347. Overall, the film grossed nearly $3.8 million worldwide.

===Home media===
&quot;Lost Highway&quot; was released on DVD on March 25, 2008, by Universal Studios Home Entertainment. The DVD is presented in anamorphic widescreen in the 2.35:1 ratio with Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. The film was then released on Blu-ray format in France in 2010, and in Japan and the United Kingdom in 2012. The British edition includes a collection of short, experimental films that Lynch had previously sold on his website. However, it was encoded in 1080i resolution at a 50 Hz frame rate, as opposed to the 1080p resolution at 24 frames per second of the French and Japanese editions. In the United States, &quot;Lost Highway&quot; was released on Blu-ray on June 25, 2019, by Kino Lorber using the 2008 Universal master. Lynch did not participate in the release, saying that &quot;It was made from old elements and not from a restoration of the original negative. I hope that a version from the restoration of the original negative will happen as soon as possible.&quot; Kino Lorber responded saying the release was sourced from the Universal Pictures master, and they had intended to work with Lynch on the release but &quot;sent email after email without one response&quot;. The Criterion Collection released a 4K Blu-ray with restoration supervised and approved by Lynch on October 11, 2022.

==Critical reception==
===Contemporaneous reviews===
Upon release, &quot;Lost Highway&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 53 out of 100 based on 21 reviews. Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film &quot;two thumbs down&quot;, a rating Lynch would later tout as &quot;two more great reasons to see&quot; &quot;Lost Highway&quot;. Ebert argued that, while Lynch effectively puts images on the screen and uses a strong soundtrack to create mood, the film does not make sense, concluding that &quot;Lost Highway&quot; &quot;is about design, not cinema&quot;. Similarly, Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Lost Highway&quot; is a &quot;beautifully made but emotionally empty&quot; film that &quot;exists only for the sensation of its provocative moments&quot;. Both Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;Salon&quot; and Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt that the film was superficial, especially when compared to &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;. Zacharek said that Lynch &quot;traded some of his disturbing originality for noir formula and schticky weirdness&quot;, while Gleiberman compared the film&#x27;s sex scenes to those of &quot;mediocre Hollywood thrillers&quot;.

In a more positive review, &quot;The New York Times&quot; journalist Janet Maslin felt that, while the film&#x27;s perversity is unoriginal and resembles that of &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, &quot;Lost Highway&quot; still &quot;holds sinister interest of its own&quot; and &quot;invites its audience to ponder&quot;. &quot;Metro&quot; editor Richard von Busack praised &quot;Lost Highway&quot; as a &quot;true horror&quot; film due to its confusing and unpleasant screenplay. He explained that horror &quot;ought to transcend logic and ordinary reality&quot; and, unlike with popular horror films like &quot;Scream&quot; (1996), where the difference between screen violence and real violence is obvious, Lynch &quot;present[s] horror as horror, willing to baffle us, willing to wound us&quot;. In another positive review, Andy Klein of the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; felt that &quot;Lost Highway&quot; was a return to form for Lynch and considered it his best work since &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;. Klein compared the film&#x27;s unanswerable concerns to the &quot;Star Gate&quot; sequence from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), stating that &quot;Lost Highway&quot; is &quot;better absorbed and experienced than analyzed&quot;.

Writing for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum felt that &quot;Lost Highway&quot; was &quot;an audacious move away from conventional narrative and back toward the formal beauty of &quot;Eraserhead&quot;&quot;. He credited Lynch&#x27;s &quot;masterful and often powerful fusions of sound and image&quot; for giving the film a very expressionist style. However, he criticized the noir iconography for its lack of historical context. For example, he explained that, while Arquette&#x27;s clothes fit in a noir setting, The Mystery Man&#x27;s video camera is very contemporary and feels out of place. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; concluded that, although &quot;Lost Highway&quot; is &quot;uneven and too deliberately obscure in meaning to be entirely satisfying&quot;, the result &quot;remains sufficiently intriguing and startling to bring many of Lynch&#x27;s old fans back on board&quot;.

At the 1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, &quot;Lost Highway&quot; was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Director, but lost to &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; in both categories. In 1998, it was nominated for the Belgian Film Critics Association&#x27;s Grand Prix, but lost to &quot;Lone Star&quot;.

===Legacy===
&quot;Lost Highway&quot; has retrospectively attracted both critical praise and scholarly interest. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 69% of 61 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Marking a further escalation in David Lynch&#x27;s surrealist style, &quot;Lost Highway&quot; is a foreboding mystery that arguably leads to a dead end, although it is signposted throughout with some of the director&#x27;s most haunting images yet.&quot; &quot;Lost Highway&quot; received five votes in the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll of The Greatest Films of All Time, ranking 323rd.

As a cult film, &quot;Lost Highway&quot; was included in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s &quot;The New Cult Canon&quot; section. Editor Scott Tobias viewed it as &quot;more cohesive than it might appear at first blush&quot;, and argued that Lynch &quot;goes digging for truths that people don&#x27;t know or won&#x27;t acknowledge about themselves—within dreams, within the subconscious, within those impossibly dark hallways where we fear to tread&quot;. Lucia Bozzola of the AllMovie online database claimed that &quot;Lost Highway&quot; retrospectively remains &quot;a sound/image tour de force&quot;. Jeremiah Kipp of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; claimed that the film was not an artistic failure but rather &quot;in many ways, it&#x27;s Lynch at his most daring, emotional, and personal,&quot; and described it as &quot;a fitting companion piece to, and inversion of, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;.&quot; Writing for &quot;Little White Lies&quot;, William Carroll also connected the film to &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; due to &quot;Los Angeles&#x27; iconic topography&quot;, and felt that it deserved to be regarded as one of the director&#x27;s best works. &quot;Daily Vanguard&quot; editor Victoria Castellanos remarked that the film &quot;serves as a wonderful companion to &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; and &quot;Inland Empire&quot;, and in many ways is more surreal and emotional than some of Lynch&#x27;s other films&quot;.

&quot;Lost Highway&quot; served as an inspiration for the 2001 video game &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;.

==Adaptation==

In 2003, the film was adapted as an opera by the Austrian composer Olga Neuwirth, with a libretto by Elfriede Jelinek.

<text>In the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish, Kishar () is the daughter of Abzu and Lahmu, the first children of Tiamat and Abzu. She is the female principle, sister and wife of Anshar, the male principle, and the mother of Anu. Kishar may represent the earth as a counterpart to Anshar, the sky, and can be seen as an earth mother goddess. Her name also means &quot;Whole Earth&quot;. 

Kishar appears only once in Enuma Elish, in the opening lines of the epic, and then disappears from the remainder of the story. She appears only occasionally in other first millennium BCE texts, where she can be equated with the goddess Antu.

<text>Rēzekne (, &quot;Rēzne&quot; or &quot;Rēzekne&quot; , ) is a state city in the Rēzekne River valley in the Latgale region of eastern Latvia. It is called &quot;The Heart of Latgale&quot; (Latvian &quot;Latgales sirds&quot;, Latgalian &quot;Latgolys sirds&quot;). Built on seven hills, Rēzekne is situated east of Riga, and west of the Latvian-Russian border, at the intersection of the Moscow – Ventspils railway and Warsaw – Saint Petersburg Railways. It is the 7th largest city in Latvia.

== Other names ==
The Latgalian name of the city is &quot;Rēzne&quot; ( ) or &quot;Rēzekne&quot; (). Historically, in German sources, the location has been known as &quot;Rositten&quot;. It is called &quot;Rzeżyca&quot; in Polish. Under the Russian Empire the city was named &quot;Rezhitsa&quot; (; ), but since Soviet period known as &quot;Резекне&quot; ().

== History ==

A Latgalian hill fort is known to have existed at Rēzekne from the 9th to the 13th centuries, until its destruction at the hands of German crusaders of the Livonian Order. In 1285, the knights built a stone fortress on the site, which is today known as Rēzekne castle ruins, to serve as a border post on their eastern frontier.

The name &quot;Rēzekne&quot; was first documented in 1285. Throughout its early history, Rēzekne was attacked many times by Russian and Lithuanian forces. The town became part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth after the Peace of Jam Zapolski in 1582 during the Livonian War. Rēzekne received Magdeburg rights from Poland in the 17th century, but fell to the Russian Empire during the Partitions of Poland. In 1773, Rēzekne received city rights. Known as &quot;Rezhitsa&quot; during Russian rule, it was an uyezd center first in Pskov Governorate between 1772 and 1776, then Polotsk between 1776 and 1796, Belarus between 1796 and 1802 and finally in Vitebsk Governorate between 1802 and 1917.

During the 19th century, the construction of the Moscow-Ventspils and Saint Petersburg-Warsaw railways transformed Rēzekne from a sleepy country town into an important city with two stations.

In the spring of 1917, the first Latgalian congress was held in Rēzekne, in which Latgale was declared to unite with the other Latvian regions. Following Latvia&#x27;s declaration of independence in 1918, the Latvian War of Independence and the driving out of both the German and Red armies from Latvia, the city became a cultural centre for all of Latgale.
Rēzekne was heavily damaged by both Nazi and Soviet armies during World War II. It was captured by troops of the German Army Group North on 4 July 1941 and placed under the administration of the newly created Reichskommissariat Ostland on 25 July 1941. Rēzekne was recaptured by troops of the Soviet 2nd Belorussian Front on 27 July 1944. Due to the heavy air-bombing by Soviet forces in 1944, ⅔ of its buildings were destroyed. Out of a pre-war population of 13,300, only 5,000 people remained in the city at the end of the war.

Rēzekne was rebuilt after the war with an emphasis on industrial development. Rēzekne had the 5th highest industrial output in the Latvian SSR, including a dairy processor (Rēzeknes Piena konservu kombināts), a lumber mill, and an electric-instrument factory (Rebir).

== Demographics ==
Based on the data provided by Latvijas Statistika, the population of Rēzekne was 10,795 in the year 1897. It decreased to 9,997 in 1920, while increasing again to 12,620 in 1925 and 13,139 in 1935.
As a result of the Pale of Settlement, many Jews settled in Latgalia and were confined to the cities. In the 19th century, the population of Rēzekne was around 60% Jewish, while Russians formed the largest minority (about 24% in 1897). The remainder of the population included Poles, Germans, and a small number of native Latgalians. With the economic development following the arrival of the railroad, the population grew steadily, reaching 23,000 by the eve of World War I.

After Latvia&#x27;s independence in 1918, the population of ethnic Latvians in the city grew substantially, but Jews still made up slightly over a quarter of the population (25.4% in 1935.) In 1939, the population was 13,000. During World War II, the Jewish population was annihilated, most between July and October 1941, due to the Holocaust. Most other residents were either deported to Gulag camps in Siberia, or fled westwards. As a result, the post-war population was only 5,000.

As part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s policy of Russification, many Russians and Belarusians moved to the city after the Soviet occupation of Latvia at the end of World War II. By 1989, Russians accounted for the majority of the population, at 53%. After Latvia&#x27;s independence in 1991, many repatriated to Russia.

In 1991, the population of Rēzekne was 43,156. Since then, the population has decreased to 30,800 (2017), due to a low birth rate, an aging population (the average age in Rēzekne is 40.3 years) (see also ageing of Europe), and a high rate of emigration abroad and to larger cities such as Riga.

== Religion ==

Due to Rēzekne&#x27;s multi-ethnic character throughout the centuries, many religious communities have settled in the city. Ethnic differences were often distinguished on religious lines; the Germans brought Christianity to Latvia in the 13th century, as well as Lutheranism during the Reformation Period. The Polish influence over Latgalia in the 17th and 18th centuries strengthened Catholicism among the native Latgalians. Incoming populations of Russian Old Believers introduced Russian Orthodoxy, and up to the 1940s, Rēzekne had a very large Jewish population, and therefore, many synagogues.

=== Sacred Heart Cathedral ===
The Catholic Cathedral &quot;Vissvētā Jēzus Sirds&quot; (Sacred Heart of Jesus), (built 1893–1914) dominates Rēzekne&#x27;s skyline looking from the castle hill.

The cathedral was consecrated in 1901. It was built on the site of a previous wooden church which had been constructed from the funds allotted by Kraków military leader Belinski. In 1887 the church was destroyed in a thunderstorm-caused fire.

The cathedral has curved wooden altars decorated by the sculptures of Jesus Christ, Virgin Mary, St.Teresa, and others. The cathedral is famous for its depictions in stained glass of the first Livonian bishops, Saint Meinhard and Albert of Riga. Since 1995 it has been the centre of the Rezekne-Aglona diocese with the seat of the bishop.

The church has an active choir whose members have studied music. A majority of the members work as musicians and enjoy their Sunday singing in the church.

=== Our Lady of Sorrows Roman Catholic Church ===

The other Catholic church, &quot;Sāpju Dievmāte&quot; (Our Lady of Sorrows) is much newer, built from 1935 to 1939.

Construction began in 1936. The tall building was built in neo-romantic style. The church was consecrated on 6 December 1937, but the construction was finished only in 1939. Next to the church is a sculpture of Our Lady of Fátima.

Like many 1930s buildings in the city such as the Nation Palace of Latvian Society (the House of Culture nowadays), the Secondary School no.3 elementary school, and the Red Cross Hospital (nowadays a students hostel) it was designed by the architect Pavlov.

=== Orthodox Church of the Birth of Holy Jesus&#x27; Mother ===

The construction of the church dates back to 1840, though it was not consecrated until 1846. In 1854, it was closed for reconstruction. After a two-year reconstruction period the church obtained its definitive look.

Tile stoves, tiled floors, three-storey iconostasis and a granite stoop decorated the church. A small stone chapel in memory of Alexander II&#x27;s rescue from death is situated on the left side of the church entrance. On the right there is a glass burial vault where the founder of the church, the owner of the Adamova manor general Karaulov and his wife Helen were buried.

=== Evangelical Lutheran Holy Trinity Church ===

The red brick church from was built in the 1930s. The church was designed by the architect J. Cīrulis in Neo-Gothic style. The church was consecrated in 1938. In the summer of 1949 the Soviet authority deprived the parishioners of their church, removed its crosses and dismantled the belfry. For many years there was a film rental company.

The parish got back its property at the beginning of the 1990s and the building has undergone major repairs. It is possible to climb the bell tower and see Rēzekne from above. Classical music concerts and divine services take place in the church nowadays.

=== St.Nicholas Old-Believers&#x27; Church ===

The church was built in 1895. In 1906 it was considerably reconstructed, with a belfry with three bells, for which the church is now famous. One of them weighs and is the biggest bell in Latvia. The bell clapper alone is heavy.

A museum is now opened in the premises of Rēzekne Old-Believers Cemetery Commune which shows the daily routine and lifestyle of Latgalian old-believers. In one of the rooms the collected items reflect church life, another has ethnographical items. The museum can be visited on request.

=== Green Synagogue ===

Prior to World War II, there were eleven synagogues in Rēzekne. The Green Synagogue is the only one to have survived to this day.

The synagogue was built in 1845 and is considered to be one of the oldest wooden buildings in Rēzekne. The synagogue was open until the 1990s, when it was closed for fire safety reasons.

The State Inspection for Heritage Protection of Latvia added it to the list of the most endangered sites in 2004. The Rezekne City Council with the support of Norwegian Financial Institutions started reconstruction of the building. Within the framework of the project it will be possible to create an exhibition devoted to the history of Rezekne&#x27;s Jews.

== Culture ==
=== Latgales Māra ===

One of the most famous statues in Latvia, known as &quot;Latgales Māra&quot;, is found in Rēzekne. It was designed by Leons Tomašickis and first unveiled on 8 September 1939. The bronze statue commemorates the liberation of Latgale from the Red Army in January 1920.

The central figure, the woman, is popularly associated with Māra the ancient Latvian goddess of motherhood, fertility, and earth. The cross in her outstretched arm symbolizes the deep importance of Catholicism to Latgalian culture. The words &quot;Vienoti Latvijai&quot; beneath the statue (meaning &quot;United for Latvia&quot;) designates the decision to reunite with the rest of Latvia during the Republic&#x27;s formation in 1918, even though Latgale had been politically separated from the rest of Latvia for 300 years.

Because the statue symbolized Latvian nationalism, the Soviets toppled it in November 1940 during the first Soviet occupation of Latvia. Under German occupation the local residents restored it on 22 August 1943. The reinstated Soviet government pulled it down again in June 1950. After that, the fate of the original statue is unknown.

After Latvia regained its independence in 1991, the statue was reconstructed using old photographs and blueprints, and unveiled on 13 August 1992. Though Soviet rule greatly changed Latgale, &quot;Latgales Māra&quot; still symbolizes a Catholic Latgale united with Latvia, free of foreign domination.

=== Castle Ruins ===

The Castle Ruins, situated on the hill by the river, are the remainders of the ancient fortified residence of ancient Latgalians which existed there from the 9th to 13th centuries. At the end of the 13th century the Livonian Order built a stone castle (Rozitten castle). It was situated in a strategically important place, so the Russians, Lithuanians and Poles were seeking to conquer it. The castle was completely destroyed during the Polish-Swedish war (1656-1660). A model of Rēzekne castle by Edmunds Smans is located near the castle hill.

=== Latgale Culture and History Museum ===

The Latgale Culture and History Museum (Latgales Kultūrvēstures muzejs) was opened in 1959. The museum offers exposition of the town history, art exhibitions, and pedagogical activities for children. The exposition of Latgale ceramics is the only permanent exposition in Latvia to reflect Latgalian ceramics in its history from the beginning of pottery in the Neolithic period until the achievements of present-day Latgalian ceramists and modern developments. Ceramics collection includes 2000 ceramic wares, made by the renowned Latgalian ceramicists, such as Andrejs Paulāns, Polikarps Čerņavskis, Polikarps Vilcāns, Jānis Backāns, Ādams Kāpostiņš and others. At the moment the museum stock collection has about 70 thousand items.

=== Art House ===
The building which is now known as the Art House was built in the last quarter of the 19th century for the merchant Vorobjov. It features rich woodcarvings on its façade, decorated in an eclectic style.

It soon became the property of the city, and was used as a teachers&#x27; institute, a school, a tuberculosis centre and a military registration office. This frequent change of users almost totally destroyed the original rich interior.

In the middle of the 1990s it was acquired by the Rezekne Art College. Due to the efforts of the students and teachers, the Art House got back its original outlook. It houses the exposition &quot;Latgalian painting&quot; from the reserves of the Latgale Culture History Museum.

<doc id="204845" wikidata="Q1349086" url="?curid=204845" title="Freddie Laker">
<text>Sir Frederick Alfred Laker (6 August 1922 – 9 February 2006) was an English airline entrepreneur, best known for founding Laker Airways in 1966, which went bankrupt in 1982. Known as Freddie Laker, he was one of the first airline owners to adopt the &quot;low cost / no-frills&quot; airline business model that has since proven to be successful worldwide when employed by companies such as Ryanair, Southwest Airlines, easyJet, Norwegian Air, and AirAsia.

==Biography==
Laker came from Canterbury in Kent, and attended the Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys, before starting work in aviation with Short Brothers in Rochester. He was a member of the Air Transport Auxiliary during and immediately after the Second World War (1941–46).

He then worked briefly for British European Airways (BEA) and London Aero Motor Services (LAMS). Having borrowed £38,000 from a wealthy friend to top up his own savings of £4,500, he subsequently went into business as a war-surplus aircraft dealer. The Soviet blockade of West Berlin in 1948–49, during which all available aircraft were needed to fly essential supplies into West Berlin, allowed his business to flourish, as this provided more than a year&#x27;s work for his planes and employees almost immediately. During this period Laker often flew the aircraft himself.

By 1954, Channel Air Bridge, his second airline venture, was flying cars and their owners in Bristol Freighters from Southend Airport (Rochford) to Calais.

In 1958, he sold Air Charter, Aviation Traders and Channel Air Bridge to Airwork. All three companies joined the Airwork group in 1959. Following the Airwork–Hunting-Clan merger in 1960, he became managing director of British United Airways.

He left British United in 1965 and formed his own Laker Airways, in 1966, initially operating charter flights with a pair of turboprop planes acquired second-hand from British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). The livery was a mixture of black and red with a bold &quot;LAKER&quot; logo on the tailplane. He offered a new, revolutionary concept of inexpensive air travel, requiring passengers to purchase their tickets on the day of travel, and to buy any food they wanted on the flight. These flights were operated by Laker Airways and marketed under the &quot;Skytrain&quot; trademark.

He was knighted in 1977, the year after the successful launch of &quot;Skytrain&quot;, in recognition of his services to the airline industry.

He received an honorary degree from the University of Strathclyde in 1981.

Laker divided his final years between his waterfront home in Princess Isle, Grand Bahama Island, where he kept his yacht, &quot;The Lady Jacqueline&quot;, and Florida, US. Laker died at the age of 83 in a suburban hospital in Hollywood in Florida, following complications from cardiac surgery to implant a pacemaker. He was survived by his fourth wife, Jacqueline Harvey, a former airline hostess he married in 1985, and by two of his children. His daughter, Elaine, was by his first wife Joan with whom he also had a son, Kevin, who died in 1965 at the age of 17 after crashing a sports car Freddie had given him for his birthday. His son Freddie Allen Laker – also a successful entrepreneur – was born to his third wife, Patricia Gates, with whom he also had another son who died in infancy.

==Business ventures==
Throughout his working life Laker was involved in a number of aviation-related business ventures. Even when he was working for others, his decisions had far-reaching strategic consequences for the business that employed him.

===Early business ventures===
Laker&#x27;s early post-war business ventures (prior to 1960) included:

====Aviation Traders====

Freddie Laker founded Aviation Traders in October 1947. It was based at Southend Airport, Essex, England and specialised in converting numerous war-surplus bombers and transporters into freighters. This included the conversion of Handley Page Halifax bombers into freighters, six of which were sold to Bond Air Services, an early post-war British independent airline. Bond Air Services based these planes at Wunstorf aerodrome in West Germany to carry essential supplies into West Berlin during the Berlin Blockade of 1948–49. Bond Air Services furthermore contracted Aviation Traders to service these planes. In return, Aviation Traders got half of Bond Air Services&#x27; freight charges.

Following the end of the Berlin Airlift in 1949, Laker had most of the Halifaxes he had supplied to various independent airlines during the Airlift scrapped at its Southend facilities. He also made use of these facilities for the subsequent conversion of several DC-4/C-54 Skymaster airframes into Carvairs for various operators around the world.

In addition, Aviation Traders re-engined &quot;Argonauts&quot;, BOAC&#x27;s Canadian-built Canadair North Stars, with unused Rolls-Royce Merlin piston engines, which it sourced from the 88 spare Merlins Freddie Laker had acquired earlier along with BOAC&#x27;s entire fleet of Haltons – former Royal Air Force Halifax bombers that had been converted to carry passengers and cargo – and several Avro Tudors purchased from the Government. It also produced an all-new aircraft design, the ATL-90 Accountant.

In 1951, Aviation Traders (Engineering), a sister company of Aviation Traders, won a contract from Bristol Aircraft to manufacture wing centre sections for Bristol Freighters. Between the beginning of 1952 and the end of 1955, Aviation Traders (Engineering) built 50 wing sections for Bristol Aircraft.

In 1958, Laker announced his decision to sell both Aviation Traders and Air Charter to Airwork for £600,000 cash plus a further £200,000, subject to the valuation of stock. The deal became effective in January 1959, when Aviation Traders and Air Charter joined the Airwork group.

====Air Charter====
This was his first airline venture, which he took over in 1951. Since its inception in 1947, Air Charter had been based at London&#x27;s old Croydon Airport. The airline participated in the 1948–49 Berlin Airlift. (Following the end of the Airlift in 1949, Laker sold the Air Charter Yorks that were still airworthy to other independent airlines, two of which were acquired by Dan-Air in 1956).)

On 14 April 1955, Air Charter inaugurated its first vehicle ferry service between Southend and Calais using a Bristol 170 Mark 32 Super Freighter.

In 1958, Laker announced his decision to sell both Air Charter and Aviation Traders to Airwork for £600,000 cash plus a further £200,000, subject to the valuation of stock.

In January 1959, Air Charter became a subsidiary of the Airwork group.

Following a rationalisation of Air Charter&#x27;s flight crew and ground staff in February 1959, Laker decided to transfer all vehicle ferry services along with the Bristol 170 fleet to the newly formed Channel Air Bridge.

Air Charter was absorbed into British United Airways in June 1960, as a result of Airwork&#x27;s merger with Hunting-Clan and several other contemporary, British independent operators.

====Channel Air Bridge====
His second airline venture began flying cars and their owners across the English Channel in 1954, initially using a fleet of Bristol Freighter twin-engined, piston-powered planes. These were later supplemented and eventually superseded by the larger-capacity, four-engined Carvairs. The Carvair design was based on the Douglas DC-4 piston-engined airliner. It involved raising the aircraft&#x27;s cockpit &quot;above&quot; the fuselage in a 747-style bulge so as to create more space for vehicles and/or passengers on the main deck. It also involved replacing the DC-4&#x27;s original tail fin with a newly designed, larger DC-7-style fin as well as equipping the aircraft with a Bristol Freighter-type nose-loading cargo door, more powerful brakes and a stronger undercarriage.

At the end of 1958, he sold Channel Air Bridge together with his other two companies – Air Charter and Aviation Traders – to Airwork. All three officially became part of the Airwork group in January 1959. In June 1960 Airwork and Hunting-Clan merged to form British United Airways. Channel Air Bridge continued operating under its own identity for more than two years.

On 1 January 1963, Channel Air Bridge merged with Silver City Airways, which had pioneered commercial cross-Channel vehicle ferry flights in 1948. The merged entity traded as British United Air Ferries.

In the meantime, Laker had been appointed British United&#x27;s managing director.

During his tenure (1960–65), British United became Britain&#x27;s biggest wholly privately owned, independent airline. It also became the UK&#x27;s first independent airline to re-equip its entire fleet with new jet aircraft.

In 1961, British United became the launch customer for the BAC One-Eleven short haul jetliner when it placed an order for ten series 200 aircraft. Laker had personally negotiated this deal with the manufacturer. This was the first time that an independent airline had placed an order for brand-new jets. The first of the new One-Elevens entered service on 9 April 1965, on the airline&#x27;s scheduled London Gatwick—Genoa route. Laker also placed an order for Vickers VC10 series 1103 long-haul jets on behalf of British United. The first two aircraft were delivered towards the end of 1964. (These aircraft differed from other operators&#x27; VC10s by having a large cargo door on the left-hand side of the forward fuselage where the aircraft&#x27;s first class section was located. They also had extended wingtips that were slightly bent downwards to reduce the aircraft&#x27;s cruise drag as well as to help it overcome the instability encountered when entering a stall.)

By the end of that decade, British United had an all-jet fleet, which gave it a competitive edge over its contemporary independent rivals.

Laker was furthermore instrumental in securing the transfer of the traffic rights for BOAC&#x27;s loss-making South American routes to Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay to British United. The airline commenced service on these routes in November 1964 using its brand-new VC10s and managed to make them profitable within five years.

In 1965, Laker decided to leave British United to set up his own airline following an alleged disagreement with British United&#x27;s chairman Myles Wyatt.

===Subsequent business ventures===
Laker was involved in the following business ventures during the later postwar years of the 20th century (post-1960):

====Laker Airways====
Laker Airways was formed in 1966. This was Laker&#x27;s third and most prominent airline venture. Laker Airways commenced commercial airline operations that July with a fleet of two ex-BOAC Bristol Britannias. These were subsequently supplemented and eventually replaced with a brand-new fleet of BAC One-Eleven jetliners as well as a pair of second-hand Boeing 707 jets.

Initially, Laker Airways was a charter airline and wholesale tour operator. British (as well as other European) airline regulations at the time required that charter-based low-price air travel be sold to the public only as a component of an air-hotel package. Other big British charter airlines were also owned by tour operators, mainly selling low-priced packages to Mediterranean beach destinations. For many years Laker had been the most profitable as well as the best-run charter airline in Britain.

Laker Airways pioneered many new, cost-saving as well as profit-enhancing, commercial concepts and operational techniques.

In 1969, Laker Airways announced its intention to buy the proposed BAC Three-Eleven, an all-British widebodied jet powered by two rear-mounted Rolls-Royce RB211 engines. The airline&#x27;s letter of intent was for four aircraft to be delivered in 1974. It was anticipated that these 250-seaters would replace the entire narrow-bodied fleet, which was envisaged to comprise two 158-seat Boeing 707s and four 84-seat BAC One-Elevens by that time. Following the project&#x27;s cancellation in 1971 due to a lack of Government funding, Laker remarked that this would force him to spend the £3 billion he had planned to invest by 1986 in a fleet of British-built widebodied airliners (including options) on competing foreign models.

Laker Airways eventually became the first independent British airline to actually operate widebodied equipment when it introduced its first two McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 series aircraft into commercial airline service in November 1972, the first European operator to do so. These aircraft were the first UK-registered DC-10s.

In 1973, Laker Airways operated the world&#x27;s first Advance Booking Charter (ABC) flight. By the mid-1970s it had become the undisputed, global ABC flight market leader.

Laker Airways scored another industry first when it introduced its first daily &quot;Skytrain&quot; low-fare scheduled service between London Gatwick and New York John F. Kennedy Airport on 26 September 1977.

====&quot;Skytrain&quot;====
On 15 June 1971, Laker Airways submitted an application to the UK&#x27;s Air Transport Licensing Board (ATLB), one of the forerunners of today&#x27;s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), to launch the world&#x27;s first daily transatlantic, low-fare scheduled service between London and New York City, charging an incredibly low one-way fare of £32.50 in winter and £37.50 in summer. This was one third of what the major, established &quot;flag carriers&quot; were charging at the time. The proposed service was to be marketed using the &quot;Skytrain&quot; trademark and was to be initially operated with 158-seat, single-class Boeing 707-138Bs that were acquired second-hand. &quot;Skytrain&quot; was to be a &quot;walk-on&quot;, &quot;walk-off&quot; operation that did not require any advance reservations. Instead, seats were to be sold to the travelling public at each end of the route on a &quot;first come, first served&quot; basis only.

The ATLB rejected Laker&#x27;s application before the year was out, and Laker appealed against the ruling. The appeal was successful, and the ATLB eventually granted Laker the requested licence in February 1972.

However, on 30 March 1972, the UK government revoked Laker&#x27;s licence and instructed him to reapply to the CAA, which came into being on 1 April 1972.

Laker duly reapplied to the CAA for permission to operate eleven weekly &quot;Skytrain&quot; services each way between London Gatwick and New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK) during the summer and seven weekly round-trips during the winter. The summer schedule was to be operated with Laker&#x27;s brand-new DC-10 widebodied jet aircraft to take advantage of increased demand he anticipated for his new low-fare service during the peak months from June to September as well as of the DC-10&#x27;s low break-even load factor of only 52%. The winter schedule was to be operated with 707 narrowbodies as specified in Laker&#x27;s original application to the ATLB.

The newly formed CAA approved Laker&#x27;s application on 5 October 1972, granting a ten-year licence. However, it specified Stansted rather than Gatwick as the service&#x27;s UK departure/arrival point and limited the number of seats that could be sold in winter to 189 per trip, the maximum number of passengers a Boeing 707 could accommodate in a high-density, all-economy configuration. The unexpected change of the UK departure/arrival point for Laker&#x27;s &quot;Skytrain&quot; service as well as its capacity limit during the lean winter season were intended not to undermine the planned launch of a daily British Caledonian (BCal) Gatwick—JFK full-service scheduled operation, for which the ATLB had already granted that airline a 15-year licence, along with another 15-year licence for a daily Gatwick—Los Angeles International Airport full-service scheduled operation, during the so-called &quot;cannon ball&quot; hearings earlier the same year.

The UK government designated Laker Airways as a scheduled transatlantic UK &quot;flag&quot; carrier on 11 January 1973.

However, under intense pressure from the established airlines, including Laker&#x27;s archrival and next-door Gatwick neighbour BCal, against a backdrop of huge losses and overcapacity on the North Atlantic in the aftermath of the global energy crisis caused by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries&#x27; oil embargo, the UK&#x27;s Labour government of that era decided to revoke Laker&#x27;s licence on 29 July 1975.

Freddie Laker took the government to the UK High Court, which overturned the latter&#x27;s decision to revoke the airline&#x27;s licence for a &quot;Skytrain&quot; service between London and New York.

It took another two years until Laker gained final approval, including a reciprocal permit from the relevant US authorities, which was granted for a one-year experimental period on 13 June 1977 by US President Jimmy Carter – to commence &quot;Skytrain&quot;.

In the meantime, Peter Shore, the then Secretary of State for Trade, had conducted a review of the government&#x27;s aviation policy and in 1976 announced a new &quot;spheres of influence&quot; policy that ended dual designation for British airlines on all long-haul routes. As a result of this new aviation policy, BA and BCal were no longer permitted to run competing scheduled services on the same long-haul routes and the latter was forced to withdraw from the London—New York and London—Los Angeles routes, resulting in the suspension of BCal&#x27;s Gatwick—JFK and Gatwick—Los Angeles licences. The same year, Edmund Dell, Peter Shore&#x27;s successor, renounced the original Bermuda air services agreement of 1946 and initiated negotiations with his US counterparts on a new air services agreement, which resulted in the Bermuda II treaty of 1977.

Laker&#x27;s long-running &quot;Skytrain&quot; application was finally granted in 1977 upon designating the airline as the second UK flag carrier between London and New York under the then just-concluded Bermuda II UK-US air agreement. At the last minute prior to the inaugural &quot;Skytrain&quot; flight from London to New York, Laker also received government permission to use its Gatwick base as the service&#x27;s UK departure and arrival point, rather than Stansted as originally specified in its licence. The restriction limiting it to 189 seats per aircraft in winter was lifted as well and the baggage allowance was brought into line with International Air Transport Association (IATA) rules.

&quot;Skytrain&quot; took to the air for the first time on 26 September 1977 when the inaugural flight departed London Gatwick for New York JFK. This flight carried 272 passengers on one of the airline&#x27;s 345-seat McDonnell Douglas DC-10 widebodied aircraft. The fares charged at the time were £59 () one-way from London and $135 () one-way from New York.

&quot;Skytrain&quot; was originally envisaged to achieve a 50% load factor in winter. By summer 1978, the actual load factor was 80%.

After unsuccessfully trying to block Laker through government regulation, the incumbent giant lines, British Airways, Pan Am and TWA, immediately matched Laker&#x27;s standby fares and rules for at least a portion of their economy-class seats. Pan Am also introduced a new low-fare alternative, &quot;budget,&quot; where a traveler could confirm a seat at the time of purchase, but only for travel within a three-day travel &quot;window,&quot; with a specific flight and date confirmed by the airline a week before departure.

Laker claimed that &quot;Skytrain&quot; helped to grow passenger numbers for all airlines in the London—New York market, citing statistics comparing passenger numbers for the July—September peak season in 1977 with those of the corresponding period in 1976 as evidence. These had shown that in the days before &quot;Skytrain&quot;, total traffic between London and New York for the aforesaid period in 1977 was down 2% on the same period in 1976. He contrasted these figures with those comparing the October—December 1977 off-peak period with the corresponding 1976 off-peak period. The latter set of figures had shown a 30% increase, boosted by &quot;Skytrain&quot;, which launched on 26 September 1977.

A closer analysis comparing the figures for October 1977 with those of the same month in 1976 had shown an increase of 31.8% (37,902 passengers) for all airlines. A further breakdown of these figures had shown that Laker&#x27;s &quot;Skytrain&quot; accounted for 15% (17,501 passengers) of the overall increase while competing services of rival airlines accounted for the remaining 16.8% (20,401 passengers). The latter included IATA members British Airways, Pan Am, and TWA, which had initially opposed &quot;Skytrain&quot; but subsequently matched its low fares. (Statistics for November and December 1977, as well as for January—June 1978, had also shown that the overall monthly growth in the London—New York market was maintained at that level for the remainder of this period while &quot;Skytrain&quot; managed to grow its share of the overall monthly increase to 50% and keep up this performance until the end of the period.)

&quot;Skytrain&quot; became a financial success in its first year of operation, leading to further expansion over the coming years, in terms of new routes as well as additional frequencies.

As a result of his clever publicity stunts to market the then brand-new London—New York &quot;Skytrain&quot; service, Freddie Laker himself became popular with the public (&quot;the forgotten man&#x27;s hero&quot;) and was regarded as one of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s &quot;golden boys&quot; of industry (along with Sir Clive Sinclair and Sir Alan Sugar). The future Conservative Prime Minister was a self-confessed &quot;Freddie Laker fan&quot;.

However, it was James Callaghan&#x27;s &quot;pro-union&quot; Labour Government that awarded Laker his knighthood for services to the airline industry in 1978, rather than Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s subsequent &quot;pro-business&quot; Conservative administration (although the latter had recommended him for his service to private enterprise in her capacity as the then leader of the opposition).

As &quot;Skytrain&quot; expanded to other British and U.S. gateways, the airline placed orders for additional McDonnell Douglas DC-10 widebodies, including the company&#x27;s first order for five longer-range series-30 aircraft required for its Los Angeles flights. These were delivered from December 1979 onwards to support its growing number of destinations and frequencies.

The airline also became one of the early buyers of the first Airbus airliner, the A300, ordering ten of these widebodies in 1979 and had plans to deploy the aircraft on a new network of intra-European &quot;Skytrain&quot; routes.

&quot;Skytrain&quot; came to an end the day the airline went into receivership at the behest of the Midland Bank on 5 February 1982.

====Collapse and the end of &quot;Skytrain&quot;====
In 1982, the company went bankrupt, owing over £250 million (equivalent to £ million in ). The airline made its last flight on 5 February 1982, the day it went into receivership.

There were numerous reasons for what was termed the biggest corporate failure in Britain at the time:

* Laker Airways had expanded too quickly in the late 1970s and early 1980s when it took delivery of a large fleet of brand-new DC-10 and A300 widebodies, which had been bought with US funds borrowed at too high a rate of interest. Subsequent devaluations of sterling meant increased costs in servicing the debt.
* The company was undercapitalised and did not enjoy the financial backup of any significant assets, which seriously undermined its ability to withstand a concerted and prolonged campaign to put it out of business at the depth of the 1981–82 recession at the hands of its financially stronger competitors.
* Laker Airways incurred a revenue loss estimated at £13 million when the worldwide DC-10 fleet was grounded as a result of having its certificate of airworthiness temporarily withdrawn in the aftermath of the American Airlines DC-10 crash at Chicago O&#x27;Hare in May 1979.
* Some passengers may also have perceived the DC-10 as unsafe as a result of a string of fatal accidents involving the aircraft within a short timespan during the late 1970s (including the aforementioned 1979 American Airlines crash at Chicago O&#x27;Hare, and the previous 1974 crash of a Turkish Airlines DC10 at Beauvais, near Paris).
* The implications of the strategic decision to build its business on discount travellers only.
* The conspiracy of large airlines throughout Europe and North America, which were aggressively price-matching Laker Airways even at the expense of massive losses. This charge, which was brought to court as the largest aviation antitrust case in history, was later settled out of court. Sir Freddie sued IATA member airlines British Airways, BCal, Pan Am, TWA, Lufthansa, Air France, Swissair, KLM, SAS, Sabena, Alitalia and UTA for conspiracy to put his airline out of business by predatory pricing. They settled out of court for US$50 million, with British Airways later agreeing to contribute a further $35 million. British Airways also reached a separate out-of-court agreement with Sir Freddie personally for £8 million.
* Aggressive, non-profitable price dropping in Australia by Qantas, which later went on to enjoy a monopoly and pushed east/west airline prices through the roof.
* Fallout from the company&#x27;s demise descended into litigation, which delayed the privatisation of British Airways.

===Laker Airways Mark II===
Laker was undaunted and almost immediately attempted to relaunch the airline with assistance from one of Britain&#x27;s titans of industry, Tiny Rowland, the Managing Director of Lonrho, plc – one of the nation&#x27;s largest conglomerates – and on the back of a strong public following (a relief fund gathered over £1 million, including a benefit concert in San Francisco by the music band The Police, who had used the airline to tour America in their formative years).

However despite Rowland’s offer of funding being described as “adequate” by Laker, the attempt was unsuccessful due to their failure to secure the necessary licensing.

Laker, by now living in the Bahamas, got off the ground again in the early 1990s, moving his refounded business&#x27;s base to Freeport. Laker Airways flew from there until it shut down in 2005. It was Laker&#x27;s final airline venture.

==Legacy==
Laker was the 2002 recipient of the Tony Jannus Award for his distinguished contributions to commercial air transportation. He is remembered for his famous advice to fellow airline entrepreneurs Richard Branson, of Virgin Atlantic, and Stelios Haji-Ioannou, of easyJet, to &quot;sue the bastards&quot;, a reference to the bullying tactics of British Airways in trying to force upstarts out of business.

Virgin Atlantic had earlier named one of its Boeing 747s &quot;The Spirit of Sir Freddie&quot;. In addition, Malaysia&#x27;s low-cost, long-haul carrier AirAsia X named its first Airbus A330 &quot;Semangat Sir Freddie&quot; in homage to the pioneer of &quot;no-frills&quot; air travel. The third plane to be named in spirit after Freddie Laker happens to be a Boeing 737 MAX that belongs to Norwegian Air Shuttle, delivered in May 2017.
His name has also recently been applied to a Norwegian Air Sweden Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, with the registration SE-RXZ.

He was also the subject of a musical, &quot;Laker!&quot;, as performed at Not in Front of the Audience in 1982, and written by Mel Smith and Peter Brewis in reaction to Laker Airways&#x27; bankruptcy.

In the 1984 comedy film &quot;Top Secret!&quot;, Laker was referenced in a climactic moment when the heroine Hillary realizes that her former lover Nigel is a traitor. Nigel gloats that in becoming a villain that he was exposed to great thinkers, &quot;Like Karl Marx, Lenin, L. Ron Hubbard, Freddie Laker!&quot;

In 1988, &quot;InsideFlyer&quot; magazine’s editor and publisher Randy Petersen created the Freddie Awards to honor Freddie Laker&#x27;s accomplishments in marketing travel. The awards recognize excellence in frequent traveler awards programs. The Freddie Awards were touted as the frequent traveller&#x27;s answer to the Oscar, Emmy and Grammy Awards by Petersen. The individual categories for the Freddie Awards are Best Award, Best Bonus, Best Affinity Credit Card, Best Newsletter/Member Communications, Best Web Site, Best Customer Service, Best Award Redemption, Best Elite Level and Program of the Year.

When the new passenger terminal at London Southend Airport was opened in 2012, the upstairs bar was named Laker&#x27;s Bar, and featured a montage of Laker and his airline across the walls. In 2015, the bar was moved into the departure lounge and renamed Laker&#x27;s Bar &amp; Restaurant, and displays images of Laker and his company like its predecessor.

In June 2017, Norwegian Air International placed Laker&#x27;s image on the tail of their first 737-8 MAX (EI-FYA). Laker is one of the company&#x27;s five &quot;British tail fin heroes&quot;, joining Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, children&#x27;s author Roald Dahl, pioneering pilot Amy Johnson and England&#x27;s World Cup winning captain Bobby Moore.

<text>Burnaby is a city in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia, Canada. Located in the centre of the Burrard Peninsula, it neighbours the City of Vancouver to the west, the District of North Vancouver across the confluence of the Burrard Inlet with its Indian Arm to the north, Port Moody and Coquitlam to the east, New Westminster and Surrey across the Fraser River to the southeast, and Richmond on Lulu Island to the southwest. It has a population of 249,125 as of the 2021 census.

Burnaby was incorporated in 1892 and achieved its city status in 1992. A member municipality of Metro Vancouver, it is British Columbia&#x27;s third-largest city by population (after Vancouver and Surrey), and is the seat of Metro Vancouver&#x27;s regional district government. 25% of Burnaby&#x27;s land is designated as parks and open spaces, one of the highest in North America.

The main campuses of Simon Fraser University and the British Columbia Institute of Technology are located in Burnaby. It is home to high-tech companies such as Ballard Power (fuel cell), Clio (legal software), D-Wave (quantum computing), General Fusion (fusion power), and EA Vancouver. Burnaby&#x27;s Metropolis at Metrotown is the largest mall in British Columbia, the third most visited in Canada and the fifth largest in the nation. Canada&#x27;s largest film and television production studio and more than 60% of BC&#x27;s sound stages are in Burnaby, contributing to the growth of Hollywood North.

The city is served by SkyTrain&#x27;s Expo Line and Millennium Line. Metrotown station in Metrotown is the busiest station on weekends and the second-busiest on weekdays in regional Vancouver&#x27;s urban transit system as of 2021.

==History==

===Pre-colonial (before 1850)===
Early inhabitants were the &quot;hən̓q̓əmín̓əm̓&quot; and &quot;Sḵwx̱wú7mesh&quot; speaking Coast Salish Nations. Local landmarks such as Burnaby Mountain, Deer Lake, and Brunette River feature prominently in Indigenous history passed down through oral traditions. The northern shorelines of Burnaby, along the second narrows of Burrard Inlet was the site of an ancient battle between the attacking Lekwiltok and the defending Musqueam according to Chief Charlie Qiyəplenəxw.

The Coast Salish people living in BC and Washington state numbered more than 100,000 people, a level of population density supported by agriculture in other geographies. Techniques to preserve and store surplus food sustained a hierarchical society. Burnaby&#x27;s marshlands along its rivers and lakes were cranberry harvesting areas for numerous villages, some numbering over 1,000 residents. Indigenous people travelled through Burnaby to reach the mouth of Brunette and Fraser River for the bountiful fishing seasons, eulachon in the spring and sockeye salmon in the late summer. Early European explorers and fur traders introduced diseases that decimated the Indigenous population. This false appearance of Burnaby as a vast open space, along with traditional Indigenous farming techniques which did not permanently alter the landscape, meant Indigenous land in Burnaby was mislabelled as terra nullius.

===Incorporation (1850–1990)===

The Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858, the first of many gold rushes in British Columbia, brought over 30,000 fortune seekers, including many American miners. The fear of an impending annexation by the United States led to the creation of the Colony of British Columbia in 1858 and the establishment of New Westminster as its capital.

Settlers in Burnaby acquired land through a process called pre-emption which allowed people to claim a piece of land by clearing forests and building houses. Indigenous people were excluded from pre-emption. Royal Engineers dispossessed land from Indigenous people with the assistance of military force including the original routes of North Road, Kingsway, Canada Way, and Marine Drive. Logging permits given to settlers destroyed the forests of southern Burnaby which had provided vital sustenance for Indigenous people.

The City of Burnaby is named after Burnaby Lake, in turn named after Robert Burnaby, who was a Freemason, explorer, and legislator. He was previously private secretary to Colonel Richard Moody, the first land commissioner for the Colony of British of Columbia. In 1859, Burnaby surveyed a freshwater lake in the city&#x27;s geographic centre. Moody named it Burnaby Lake.

Burnaby was established in 1891 and incorporated a year later in 1892. In the same year, the interurban tram connecting Vancouver, Burnaby, and New Westminster began construction.

=== Recent ===

The expanding urban centres of Vancouver and New Westminster influenced the growth of Burnaby. It developed as an agricultural area supplying nearby markets. Later, it evolved into an important transportation corridor between Vancouver, the Fraser Valley and the Interior. The introduction of the Skytrain&#x27;s Expo Line cemented this trend into the 21st century.

As Vancouver expanded and became a metropolis, Burnaby was one of the first-tier suburbs of Vancouver, along with North Vancouver and Richmond. During the suburbanization of Burnaby, &quot;Mid-Century Vernacular&quot; homes were built by the hundreds to satisfy demand by new residents. The establishment of British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) in 1960 and Simon Fraser University (SFU) in 1965 helped Burnaby gradually become more urban in character. In 1992, one hundred years after its incorporation, Burnaby officially became a city.

Since the 1970s, Burnaby has seen a decline in resource sectors and a subsequent rise of high value-added services and technology sectors. The presence of BCIT and SFU promoted research &amp; development in the area. For example, manufacturing plants near Still Creek closed in the late 1970s, only to reopen few years later as film production studios. The continued expansion of media production in Burnaby contributed to Hollywood North.

==Geography and land use==
Burnaby occupies and is located at the geographic centre of the Metro Vancouver Regional District. The city has four areas of urban density known as &quot;town centres&quot;: Lougheed, Edmonds, Metrotown, and Brentwood. The city&#x27;s governmental and cultural precincts are located in Burnaby&#x27;s Deer Lake area. Situated between the city of Vancouver on the west and Port Moody, Coquitlam, and New Westminster on the east, Burnaby is bounded by Burrard Inlet and the Fraser River on the north and south, respectively. Burnaby, Vancouver and New Westminster collectively occupy the major portion of the Burrard Peninsula. The elevation of Burnaby ranges from sea level to a maximum of atop Burnaby Mountain. Due to its elevation, the city of Burnaby typically has more snowfall during the winter months than nearby Vancouver or Richmond. Overall, the physical landscape of Burnaby is one of hills, ridges, valleys and an alluvial plain.

Burnaby is home to many industrial and commercial firms. British Columbia&#x27;s largest (and Canada&#x27;s second largest) commercial shopping mall, Metropolis at Metrotown, is located in Burnaby, as well as malls in Brentwood and Lougheed town centres. Still, Burnaby&#x27;s ratio of park land to residents is one of the highest in North America. It also maintains some agricultural land, particularly along the Fraser foreshore flats in the Big Bend neighbourhood along its southern perimeter.

===Parks, rivers, and lakes===
Major parklands and waterways in Burnaby include Central Park, Robert Burnaby Park, Kensington Park, Burnaby Mountain, Still Creek, the Brunette River, Burnaby Lake, Deer Lake, Squint Lake, and Barnet Marine Park.

===Climate===

Burnaby&#x27;s Simon Fraser University weather station is located above sea level on Burnaby Mountain. Therefore, climate records are cooler and wetter, with more snowfall, as compared to the rest of the city.

Burnaby has an oceanic climate (Cfb) with mild, dry summers and cool, rainy winters.

The Expo Line, completed in 1986, crosses the south along Kingsway. The Millennium Line, completed in 2002, follows Lougheed Highway. The SkyTrain has encouraged closer connections to New Westminster, Vancouver, and Surrey, as well as dense urban development at Lougheed Town Centre on the city&#x27;s eastern border, at Brentwood Town Centre in the centre-west, Edmonds–Highgate in the southeast and, most notably, at Metrotown in the south.

Major north–south streets crossing the city include Boundary Road, Willingdon Avenue, Royal Oak Avenue, Kensington Avenue, Sperling Avenue, Gaglardi Way, Cariboo Road, and North Road. East–west routes linking Burnaby&#x27;s neighbouring cities to each other include Hastings Street, Barnet Highway, the Lougheed Highway, Kingsway (which follows the old horse trail between Vancouver and New Westminster), Canada Way and Marine Drive/Marine Way. Douglas Road, which used to cross the city from northwest to southeast, has largely been absorbed by the Trans-Canada Highway and Canada Way.

==Politics==

While Burnaby occupies about 4 percent of the land area of the Metro Vancouver Regional District, it accounted for about 10 percent of the region&#x27;s population in 2016. It is the third most populated urban centre in British Columbia (after Vancouver and Surrey), with a population of 249,125 (2021).

Politically, Burnaby has maintained a left-wing city council closely affiliated with the provincial NDP and school board for many years, while sometimes electing more conservative legislators provincially (from the Social Credit and BC Liberal parties) and federally (from the Reform, Alliance, and Conservative parties). Its longest-serving politician had been Svend Robinson of the New Democratic Party (NDP), Canada&#x27;s first openly gay member of Parliament, but after 25 years and seven elections he resigned his post in early 2004 after stealing and then returning an expensive ring. Burnaby voters endorsed his assistant, Bill Siksay, as his replacement in the 2004 Canadian federal election. In the May 2013 provincial election, residents of the city sent 3 NDP MLAs and one Liberal MLA to the British Columbia legislature. The NDP MLA for Burnaby-Lougheed, Jane Shin, faced controversy after the election for misrepresenting herself as a physician despite not having completed a medical residency nor holding a licence to practice medicine.

According to a 2009 survey by &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine, Burnaby was Canada&#x27;s best-run city. The survey looks at a city&#x27;s efficiency, the cost of producing results, and the effectiveness of its city services. However, Maclean&#x27;s did note that Burnaby has one of the worst municipal voter turnouts in the country, at 26 percent. In 2015, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) included Burnaby as a Vancouver periphery to rank eighth for entrepreneurial communities.

<text>Black Lizard was an American book publisher. A division of the Creative Arts Book Company of Berkeley, California, Black Lizard specialized in reprinting forgotten crime fiction and noir fiction writers and novels originally released between the 1930s and the 1960s, many of which are now acknowledged as classics of their genres.

== History ==
Founded and edited by writer Barry Gifford in 1984, Black Lizard released over ninety books between 1984 and 1990, including reprints of classic novels by Charles Willeford, David Goodis, Peter Rabe, Harry Whittington, Dan J. Marlowe, Charles Williams, and Lionel White, as well as original novels by Barry Gifford and Jim Nisbet. Lizard is single-handedly responsible for renewing the interest in Jim Thompson in the late 1980s, which resulted in several film adaptations of his novels. The original series were mass-market paperbacks with covers drawn by Jim Kirwan.

Barry Gifford&#x27;s relationship with Black Lizard is also sometimes credited with having first applied the term noir fiction to a certain subgenre of hardboiled fiction. Thus, in an introduction written by Gifford to the Black Lizard editions of Jim Thompson&#x27;s novels in 1984, Gifford writes: &quot;The French seem to appreciate best Thompson&#x27;s brand of terror. Roman noir, literally &#x27;black novel,&#x27; is a term reserved especially for novelists such as Thompson, Cornell Woolrich and David Goodis. Only Thompson, however, fulfills the French notion of both &quot;noir&quot; and &quot;maudit&quot;, the accursed and self-destructive. It is an unholy picture that Thompson presents. As the British critic Nick Kimberley has written, &#x27;This is a godless world,&#x27; populated by persons &#x27;for whom murder is a casual chore.&#x27;&quot; Gifford&#x27;s use of the term noir in this context resulted in a term that is narrower in scope than that used by the French roman noir as applied to fiction. In 2021, Willy Vlautin wrote: &quot;Those Black Lizard books were about psychologically damaged people trying to navigate a cruel, cutthroat world that didn&#x27;t want them in the first place.&quot;

Random House bought the rights to the Black Lizard name in June 1990 and merged it with Vintage Crime: Vintage Crime/Black Lizard was the result. Many of Black Lizards&#x27; earlier releases were replaced by mainstream-friendly writers such as Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain, as well as numerous contemporary authors, including Jason Starr, whose noir crime novel &quot;Hard Feelings&quot; was Vintage Crime/Black Lizard’s first ever original novel. The mass-market paperbacks were replaced by trade paperbacks with black-and-white photographs on the covers. Most of the series was reprinted in this new format, but practically all of the books published by Lizard before the merge, with the notable exception of books by Jim Thompson, have since been allowed to fall out of print and have remained so since the early 1990s.

<doc id="204897" wikidata="Q66953" url="?curid=204897" title="Georg Heinrich von Görtz">
<text>Georg Heinrich von Görtz, Baron of Schlitz (1668 – 19 February 1719), diplomat in Swedish service, was born in Holstein and educated at Jena.

== Early life ==

Born into an old and prominent German noble family from Fulda, he was the eldest of four sons of Philipp Friedrich von Schlitz gen. von Görtz (1641-1695) by his first wife, Juliane von Minnigerode (1652-1687). From his father&#x27;s second marriage to Sophia Philippine von Ilten (1669-1732), he had three more half siblings.

== Career ==
He entered the Holstein-Gottorp service, and after the death of the duchess Hedwig Sophia, Charles XII of Sweden&#x27;s sister, became very influential during the minority of her son Duke Charles Frederick. His earlier policy aimed at strengthening Holstein-Gottorp at the expense of Denmark. With this object, during Charles XII&#x27;s stay at Altranstädt (1706–1707), he tried to divert the king&#x27;s attention to the Holstein question, and six years later, when the Swedish commander, Magnus Stenbock, crossed the Elbe, Görtz rendered him as much assistance as was compatible with not openly breaking with Denmark, even going so far as to surrender the fortress of Tönning to the Swedes. Görtz next attempted to undermine the grand alliance against Sweden by negotiating with Russia, Prussia and Saxony for the purpose of isolating Denmark, or even of turning the arms of the allies against her, a task by no means impossible in view of the strained relations between Denmark and the tsar. The plan foundered, however, on the refusal of Charles XII to save the rest of his German domains by ceding Stettin to Prussia. Another simultaneous plan of procuring the Swedish crown for Duke Charles Frederick also came to nought. Görtz first suggested the marriage between the duke of Holstein and the tsarevna Anne of Russia, and negotiations were begun in Saint Petersburg with that object.

Görtz was also prominently involved in negotiating the terms of Stenbock&#x27;s surrender in the Siege of Tönning, 1713.

== Charles XII ==
On the arrival of Charles XII from Turkey at Stralsund in 1714, Görtz was the first to visit him, and emerged from his presence chief minister or &quot;grand-vizier&quot; as the Swedes preferred to call the bold and crafty satrap, whose absolute devotion to the Swedish king took no account of the intense wretchedness of the Swedish nation. Görtz, himself a man of uncommon audacity, seems to have been fascinated by the heroic element in Charles&#x27;s nature and was determined, if possible, to save him from his difficulties. He owed his extraordinary influence to the fact that he was the only one of Charles&#x27;s advisers who believed, or pretended to believe, that Sweden was still far from exhaustion, or at any rate had a sufficient reserve of power to give support to an energetic diplomacy - Charles&#x27;s own opinion, in fact.

== Swedish plenipotentiary ==

Görtz’s position, however, was highly peculiar. Ostensibly, he was only the Holstein minister at Charles&#x27;s court, in reality he was everything in Sweden except a Swedish subject - finance minister, plenipotentiary to foreign powers, factotum, and responsible to the king alone, though he had not a line of instructions. He was just the man for the time and his approach was revolutionary. His chief financial action was to debase the currency by issuing copper tokens, intended to be redeemable in better times; but it was no fault of his that Charles XII flung upon the market too great an amount of this money for Görtz to deal with. By the end of 1718 it seemed as if Görtz’s system could not go on much longer, and the hatred of the Swedes towards him was so intense and universal that they blamed him for Charles XII&#x27;s tyranny as well as for his own. Görtz hoped, however, to conclude peace with at least some of Sweden’s numerous enemies before the crash came and then, by means of fresh combinations, to restore Sweden to her rank as a great power.

== Downfall ==
It is often said that in pursuit of his &quot;system&quot; Görtz displayed a genius for diplomacy which would have done honour to a Metternich or a Talleyrand. He desired peace with Russia first of all, and at the Congress of Åland even obtained relatively favourable terms, only to have them rejected by his stubbornly optimistic master. Simultaneously, Görtz was negotiating with Cardinal Alberoni and with the Whigs in England; but all his combinations collapsed with the sudden death of Charles XII. The whole fury of the Swedish nation instantly fell upon Görtz. After a trial before a special commission, in which he was not permitted to have any legal assistance or the use of writing materials, he was condemned to decapitation and promptly executed. Though some historians argue that Görtz deserved his fate for &quot;unnecessarily making himself the tool of an unheard-of despotism,&quot; his death is considered by other historians to be a judicial murder, and some historians even regard him as a political martyr.

== Personal life ==
In 1705, he was married to Christine Magdalene von Reventlow (1682-1713), widow of Kai von Rantzau (1650-1704), daughter of Detlev von Reventlow-Reedtz (1654-1701) and his wife, Dorothea von Ahlefeldt (1648-1720). They had two daughters:
*Georgine von Schlitz gen. von Görtz (1708-1787) ⚭ Johann Friedrich von Bardenfleth (d. 1736) ⚭ Friedrich von Eyben (d. 1787)
*Juliana von Schlitz gen. von Görtz (1713-1750) ⚭ Hieronymus Wigand von Laffert (1686-1765)

<doc id="204899" wikidata="Q874816" url="?curid=204899" title="Khorat Plateau">
<text>The Khorat Plateau (; ) is a plateau in the northeastern Thai region of Isan. The plateau forms a natural region, named after the short form of Nakhon Ratchasima, a historical barrier controlling access to and from the area.

==Geography==
The average elevation is and it covers an area of about . The saucer-shaped plateau is divided by a range of hills called the Phu Phan Mountains into two basins: the northern Sakhon Nakhon Basin, and the southern Khorat Basin. The plateau tilts from its northwestern corner where it is about above sea level to the southeast where the elevation is only about . Except for a few hills in the northeastern corner, the region is primarily gently undulating land, most of it varying in elevation from , tilting from the Phetchabun Mountains in the west down toward the Mekong River. The plateau is drained by the Mun and Chi Rivers, tributaries to the Mekong that forms the northeastern boundary of the area. It is separated from central Thailand by the Phetchabun Mountains and the Dong Phaya Yen Mountains in the west, the Sankamphaeng Range in the southwest and by the Dângrêk Mountains in the south, all of which historically made access to the plateau difficult.

These mountains together with the Truong Son Range in the northeast catch a lot of the rainfall, so the southwest monsoon has much lower intensity than in other regions—the mean annual rainfall in Nakhon Ratchasima is about , compared with in central Thailand. The difference between the dry and wet seasons is much greater, which makes the area less optimal for rice. The portion known as Tung Kula Rong Hai was once exceptionally arid.

==Geology==
The plateau uplifted from an extensive plain composed of remnants of the Cimmerian microcontinent, and terranes such as the Shan–Thai terrane, either late in the Pleistocene or early in the Holocene Epoch, approximately Year 1 of the Holocene calendar. Much of the surface of the plateau was once classified as laterite, and layers that can easily be cut into brick-shaped blocks are still so called, but the classification of soils as various types of oxisols is more useful for agriculture. Oxisols of the type called rhodic ferralsols, or Yasothon soils, formed under humid tropical conditions in the early Tertiary. When portions of the plain uplifted as a plateau, these relict soils, characterized by a bright red color, wound up on uplands in a great semicircle around the southern rim. These soils overlie associated gravel horizons cleared of sand by field termites, in a prolonged and still on-going process of bioturbation. Xanthic ferralsols of the Khorat and Ubon Series, characterized by a pale yellow to brown color, developed in midlands in processes still under investigation, as are those forming lowland soils resembling European brown soils.

==Archaeology==
Many prehistoric Thailand sites are found on the plateau, with some bronze relics of the Dong Son culture having been discovered. The World Heritage Ban Chiang archaeological site, discovered in 1966, yielded evidence of bronze making beginning c. 2000 BCE, but lacking evidence of weaponry so often associated with the Bronze Age in Europe and the rest of the world. The site appears to have once been part of a broader culture, until abandoned c. 200 CE, not to be resettled until the early-19th century. None Nok Tha in the Phu Wiang District of Khon Kaen yielded evidence of an Iron Age settlement dating from about 1420 to 50 BCE.

The region was once under the suzerainty of the Dvaravati Kingdom, and later under the Khmer Empire. It is dotted with the ruins of Khmer rest houses positioned about apart, a comfortable day&#x27;s walk, along the Khmer highways. These were not just places of repose, but also were hospices and libraries, and typically included a baray (pond).
Archaeologist Charles Higham stated, &quot;...we remain largely unaware of the relationships between sites and the presence or otherwise of states on the Khorat plateau&quot; during the 7th to 11th centuries. Muang Sema and Muang Fa Daet are notable though for their religious structures, including sema stones at Muang Fa Daet.

==History==
There is a paucity of information from the centuries known as the Post-Angkor Period, but the plateau seems to have been largely depopulated following this period and a long series of droughts during 13th—15th centuries. The Lao settlements were found only along the banks of the Mekong River and in the wetter northern areas such as Nong Bua Lamphu, Loei, Nong Khai, with most of the population inhabiting the wetter left banks. This began to change when the golden age of Lao prosperity and cultural achievements under King Surignavôngsa ( &quot;Suriyawongsa&quot;, ) (1637-1694) ended with a successional dispute, with his grandsons, with Siamese intervention, carving out their separate kingdoms in 1707. From its ashes arose the kingdoms of Louang Phrabang, Vientiane and later in 1713, the Champasak. The arid hinterlands, deforested and depopulated after a series of droughts likely led to the collapse of the Khmer Empire, was only occupied by small groups of Austroasiatic peoples and scattered outposts of Lao &quot;mueang&quot; in the far north. In 1718, the first Lao muang in the Chi valley—and in fact anywhere in the interior of the Khorat Plateau—was founded at Suwannaphum District, in present-day Roi Et Province, by an official in the service of King Nokasad of the Kingdom of Champasak.

<text>Albert Gustaf Aristides Edelfelt (21 July 1854 – 18 August 1905) was a Finnish painter noted for his naturalistic style and Realist approach to art. He lived in the Grand Duchy of Finland and made Finnish culture visible abroad, before Finland gained full independence. He was considered the greatest Finnish artist of the second half of 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries, and one of the most prominent contributors to the Golden Age of Finnish Art.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Edelfelt was born 1854 in Porvoo, son of the Swedish architect Carl Albert Edelfelt (1818–1869), who had lived in Finland since his early youth, and Alexandra Edelfeldt (née Brandt 1833–1901). His father died when he was still young, and his mother had to raise him and his younger siblings alone compounded by financial difficulties. He remained very close to his mother throughout his life.

He began his formal studies of art in 1869 at the Drawing School of the Finnish Art Society in Helsinki and continued as a student of Adolf von Becker (1871–73). He then received a scholarship from the Finnish government to study history painting at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, Belgium. He studied under Nicaise de Keyser for several months in 1873-74, and won an award for excellence for his painting of Alexander the Great on his deathbed. He also began a long-lasting friendship with the Belgian artist Émile Claus.

=== Arrival in Paris – History Painting ===
In the autumn of 1874, at the age of nineteen, following the advice of his teacher Adolf von Becker, he moved to Paris and enrolled at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He shared a small studio with a Finnish friend at 24 Rue Bonaparte. Under the instruction of the French painter Jean-Léon Gerome he continued to focus on history painting, particularly scenes of the long series of wars involving the Russians, Swedes and Finns.

After a year in Paris he returned to Helsinki, but came back to Paris in 1876, taking a studio at 81 boulevard du Montparnasse. He became friends with the painter Jules Bastien-Lepage, who introduced him the techniques of painting in open air. His major work of this time was &quot;Duke Charles IX of Sweden insulting the corpse of his enemy Klaus Fleming&quot; (1878). This work which blended the formal academic style with elements of careful realism, such as the dust on the boots. This painting did not cause a stir in Paris, but it enjoyed a great success in Finland; it was purchased by the Finnish Society of Fine Arts. 

In 1879 he had his first success at the Paris Salon, with a history painting entitled &quot;The Burnt Village - a scene from the Finnish peasant revolt of 1596&quot;. The French critics praised the realism of the figures, but Edelfelt noticed the incongruity between the historical figures and the realistic outdoor setting. He wrote, &quot;The problem right with historic subjects is that one cannot render the aspect of reality as in scenes that you have seen yourself.&quot; With that judgement, he almost entirely abandoned history painting and concentrated on painting in the open air.

He went back to Finland for a time, then returned to Paris in 1881 and rented a new studio at 147 avenue des Villiers.

===Impressionism and Painting in Open Air===
In the early 1880s, Edelfelt began to adapt some of the characteristics of the new Impressionist movement; natural settings, particularly parks and gardens and the seashore; intimate domestic settings; the play of light on the figures; and rapid execution, to capture the sensation of the moment. At the same time he never became entirely an impressionist, following his realist training to concentrate on precise details and using a broad and complex palette of colors. 

Throughout the 1880s, Edelfelt continued to paint outdoor scenes of life in Paris, displaying his talent for capturing the effects of light, combined with his precision of details. During the same period he created wide variety of intimate domestic scenes, capturing the details of Parisian life.

=== Portrait of Louis Pasteur ===
In 1880 Edelfelt became a friend of Jean-Baptiste Pasteur, the son of the famous chemist Louis Pasteur, who introduced him to Pasteur the following year. He became a close friend of family, and painted many of their portraits over the following years. Pasteur had a good sense of public relations, and participated with Edelfelt in the planning of his own portrait.

Edelfeld&#x27;s portrait of Pasteur in his laboratory, painted in 1885, had a great success at the Paris Salon of 1886, and became one of the most familiar images of the scientist. It gained the painter the award of the Legion of Honor when he was only thirty-five years old.
===Russian Imperial commissions===
Edelfelt began by painting portraits of his family and relatives, but his skills very quickly brought him a large clientele. In 1881 he visited Saint Petersburg, where the Russian Academy had awarded him an honorary membership in 1878. The Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, brother of the Russian Emperor, commissioned him to make portraits of his children. This led to another commission to paint the children of Czar Alexander III of Russia. In 1896 he returned to Russia to make a portrait of Czar Nicholas II.

In February, 1899, Czar Nicholas II issued a decree suppressing the political liberties of the Finns. Edelfelt mobilised a network of Finnish artists and cultural figures with a petition to the Russian government, called &quot;Pro Finlandia&quot;, seeking recognition of the independence of the arts in Finland. He also took on the role of a cultural diplomat as the commissioner of the Finnish participation in the Paris Exposition Universelle (1900).


===The Finnish Countryside===
Edelfelt spent his summers in Finland exploring and painting. While his French paintings were almost all of Paris scenes, his paintings in Finland captured the scenery, people and particular light of the Finnish countryside. He presented them regularly at the Paris Salon. For his painting of an outdoor church service on the coast at Haikko, near Porvoo, he made a series of oil sketches, to capture exactly the tonalities of the water and the sky.

In 1880 his family bought a summer house at the coastal manor of Haikko, in the southwest part the country, and he installed a studio there in 1883. He frequently used his family and local residents as models. His pictures have a spontaneity and naturalness resulting from his careful observation and empathy for the subjects.

=== Portrait painting ===
Edelfelt very early in his career became a master of portrait painting, which provided the major part of his income. &quot;Portraits for the soup, paintings for the glory&quot;, he wrote in 1878, citing the Belgian artist Antoine Wiertz. From 1880 onwards, he participated in the Paris Salon, and portraits were his major source of income.
Each portrait he painted involved a lengthy process. He had a series of preparatory drawings with pencil and crayon, then with pastel colors, before making the final oil painting. Besides close attention to the expression of the model and the pose, he paid close attention to the surroundings of the subject, including books, pets or objects that could illuminate the personality of the subject. 

While he painted portraits of influential and famous people such as Pasteur, many of his best portraits are not posed, but depict Finnish men and women in natural settings, in village life or at sea.

===Espagnolisme, Runeberg and religious art===
In April and May 1881, Edelfelt spent five weeks in Spain where he learned many new aspects of art and studied the phenomenon called espagnolisme, which is the impact that Spanish influences had on France starting from the 1830s. In Spain, Edelfelt also gained a deeper grasp of Gypsy culture and Orientalism which had always interested him. His most important picture from Granada is &quot;Gitana Dancing I&quot;, a genre portrait of a dancing Gypsy girl.

In 1890s he became interested in illustrating poetry. Edelfelt admired the poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg, who was a friend of the family. The company of Runeberg had a lasting impact on Edelfelt, who from time to time turned to scenes from Finnish history in his paintings. Edelfelt went on to illustrate Runeberg&#x27;s epic poem &quot;The Tales of Ensign Stål&quot;.

Edelfelt also later dabbled in religious painting, and in his 1890 &quot;Christ and Mary Magdalene&quot; he set a biblical scene in the Finnish landscape, influenced by Kanteletar.

=== Personal life ===
He sent his mother hundreds of letters when he was away. In Paris, he shared a studio with the American Julian Alden Weir, who introduced him to John Singer Sargent. He had romantic relationships with numerous women, including Antonia Bonjean and Virginie in Paris. He married Baroness Anna Elise &quot;Ellan&quot; de la Chapelle in 1888, and the same year they had one child, Erik. They had known each other since childhood, but their marriage did not have a lot of warmth. The death of his mother in 1901 affected him greatly.

He died abruptly from heart failure in 1905 at the age of fifty-one. His funeral was attended by a large number of notable Finns. His son Erik died not long afterwards in 1910.

==Legacy==
In 2013, &quot;Boys Playing on the Shore&quot; (1884) was selected by Nordic Moneta as Finland&#x27;s most significant painting.

In Finland, he was one of the founders of the Realist art movement. He influenced several younger Finnish painters and helped fellow Finnish artists such as Akseli Gallen-Kallela and Gunnar Berndtson to make their breakthrough in Paris. Among his students was Léon Bakst. Edelfelt was one of the first Finnish artists to achieve international fame. Albert Edelfelt is considered one of the most notable artists of the Golden Age of Finnish Art. A museum under his name operates in Porvoo. He was selected as the main motif on a Finnish commemorative coin celebrating the 150th anniversary of his birth, the €100 Albert Edelfelt and painting commemorative coin, minted in 2004. The reverse shows an embossed face of the artist.

<doc id="204912" wikidata="Q899364" url="?curid=204912" title="Magnetic refrigeration">
<text>Magnetic refrigeration is a cooling technology based on the magnetocaloric effect. This technique can be used to attain extremely low temperatures, as well as the ranges used in common refrigerators.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1088/0022-327/38/23/R01&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A magnetocaloric material warms up when a magnetic field is applied. The warming is due to changes in the internal state of the material releasing heat. When the magnetic field is removed, the material returns to its original state, reabsorbing the heat, and returning to original temperature. To achieve refrigeration, the material is allowed to radiate away its heat while in the magnetized hot state. Removing the magnetism, the material then cools to &quot;below&quot; its original temperature.

The effect was first observed in 1881 by a German physicist Emil Warburg, followed by French physicist P. Weiss and Swiss physicist A. Piccard in 1917. The fundamental principle was suggested by P. Debye (1926) and W. Giauque (1927). The first working magnetic refrigerators were constructed by several groups beginning in 1933. Magnetic refrigeration was the first method developed for cooling below about 0.3 K (the lowest temperature attainable before magnetic refrigeration, by pumping on  vapors).

== Magnetocaloric effect ==

The magnetocaloric effect (MCE, from &quot;magnet&quot; and &quot;calorie&quot;) is a magneto-thermodynamic phenomenon in which a temperature change of a suitable material is caused by exposing the material to a changing magnetic field. This is also known by low temperature physicists as &quot;adiabatic demagnetization&quot;. In that part of the refrigeration process, a decrease in the strength of an externally applied magnetic field allows the magnetic domains of a magnetocaloric material to become disoriented from the magnetic field by the agitating action of the thermal energy (phonons) present in the material. If the material is isolated so that no energy is allowed to (re)migrate into the material during this time, (i.e., an adiabatic process) the temperature drops as the domains absorb the thermal energy to perform their reorientation. The randomization of the domains occurs in a similar fashion to the randomization at the Curie temperature of a ferromagnetic material, except that magnetic dipoles overcome a decreasing external magnetic field while energy remains constant, instead of magnetic domains being disrupted from internal ferromagnetism as energy is added.

One of the most notable examples of the magnetocaloric effect is in the chemical element gadolinium and some of its alloys. Gadolinium&#x27;s temperature increases when it enters certain magnetic fields. When it leaves the magnetic field, the temperature drops. The effect is considerably stronger for the gadolinium alloy . Praseodymium alloyed with nickel () has such a strong magnetocaloric effect that it has allowed scientists to approach to within one millikelvin, one thousandth of a degree of absolute zero.

=== Equation ===

The magnetocaloric effect can be quantified with the following equation:

formula_1

where formula_2 is the adiabatic change in temperature of the magnetic system around temperature T, H is the applied external magnetic field, C is the heat capacity of the working magnet (refrigerant) and M is the magnetization of the refrigerant.

From the equation we can see that the magnetocaloric effect can be enhanced by:

* a large field variation
* a magnet material with a small heat capacity
* a magnet with large changes in net magnetization vs. temperature, at constant magnetic field

The adiabatic change in temperature, formula_2, can be seen to be related to the magnet&#x27;s change in magnetic entropy (formula_4) since

formula_5

This implies that the absolute change in the magnet&#x27;s entropy determines the possible magnitude of the adiabatic temperature change under a thermodynamic cycle of magnetic field variation. T

=== Thermodynamic cycle ===

The cycle is performed as a refrigeration cycle that is analogous to the Carnot refrigeration cycle, but with increases and decreases in magnetic field strength instead of increases and decreases in pressure. It can be described at a starting point whereby the chosen working substance is introduced into a magnetic field, i.e., the magnetic flux density is increased. The working material is the refrigerant, and starts in thermal equilibrium with the refrigerated environment.

* &quot;Adiabatic magnetization:&quot; A magnetocaloric substance is placed in an insulated environment. The increasing external magnetic field (+&quot;H&quot;) causes the magnetic dipoles of the atoms to align, thereby decreasing the material&#x27;s magnetic entropy and heat capacity. Since overall energy is not lost (yet) and therefore total entropy is not reduced (according to thermodynamic laws), the net result is that the substance is heated (&quot;T&quot; + Δ&quot;T&quot;ad).
* &quot;Isomagnetic enthalpic transfer:&quot; This added heat can then be removed (-&quot;Q&quot;) by a fluid or gas — gaseous or liquid helium, for example. The magnetic field is held constant to prevent the dipoles from reabsorbing the heat. Once sufficiently cooled, the magnetocaloric substance and the coolant are separated (&quot;H&quot;=0).
* &quot;:&quot; The substance is returned to another adiabatic (insulated) condition so the total entropy remains constant. However, this time the magnetic field is decreased, the thermal energy causes the magnetic moments to overcome the field, and thus the sample cools, i.e., an adiabatic temperature change. Energy (and entropy) transfers from thermal entropy to magnetic entropy, measuring the disorder of the magnetic dipoles.
* &quot;Isomagnetic entropic transfer:&quot; The magnetic field is held constant to prevent the material from reheating. The material is placed in thermal contact with the environment to be refrigerated. Because the working material is cooler than the refrigerated environment (by design), heat energy migrates into the working material (+&quot;Q&quot;).

Once the refrigerant and refrigerated environment are in thermal equilibrium, the cycle can restart.

=== Applied technique ===

The basic operating principle of an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) is the use of a strong magnetic field to control the entropy of a sample of material, often called the &quot;refrigerant&quot;. Magnetic field constrains the orientation of magnetic dipoles in the refrigerant. The stronger the magnetic field, the more aligned the dipoles are, corresponding to lower entropy and heat capacity because the material has (effectively) lost some of its internal degrees of freedom. If the refrigerant is kept at a constant temperature through thermal contact with a heat sink (usually liquid helium) while the magnetic field is switched on, the refrigerant must lose some energy because it is equilibrated with the heat sink. When the magnetic field is subsequently switched off, the heat capacity of the refrigerant rises again because the degrees of freedom associated with orientation of the dipoles are once again liberated, pulling their share of equipartitioned energy from the motion of the molecules, thereby lowering the overall temperature of a system with decreased energy. Since the system is now insulated when the magnetic field is switched off, the process is adiabatic, i.e., the system can no longer exchange energy with its surroundings (the heat sink), and its temperature decreases below its initial value, that of the heat sink.

The operation of a standard ADR proceeds roughly as follows. First, a strong magnetic field is applied to the refrigerant, forcing its various magnetic dipoles to align and putting these degrees of freedom of the refrigerant into a state of lowered entropy. The heat sink then absorbs the heat released by the refrigerant due to its loss of entropy. Thermal contact with the heat sink is then broken so that the system is insulated, and the magnetic field is switched off, increasing the heat capacity of the refrigerant, thus decreasing its temperature below the temperature of the heat sink. In practice, the magnetic field is decreased slowly in order to provide continuous cooling and keep the sample at an approximately constant low temperature. Once the field falls to zero or to some low limiting value determined by the properties of the refrigerant, the cooling power of the ADR vanishes, and heat leaks will cause the refrigerant to warm up.

== Working materials ==

The magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is an intrinsic property of a magnetic solid. This thermal response of a solid to the application or removal of magnetic fields is maximized when the solid is near its magnetic ordering temperature. Thus, the materials considered for magnetic refrigeration devices should be magnetic materials with a magnetic phase transition temperature near the temperature region of interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1002/aenm.201200167&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For refrigerators that could be used in the home, this temperature is room temperature. The temperature change can be further increased when the order-parameter of the phase transition changes strongly within the temperature range of interest.

The magnitudes of the magnetic entropy and the adiabatic temperature changes are strongly dependent upon the magnetic ordering process. The magnitude is generally small in antiferromagnets, ferrimagnets and spin glass systems but can be much larger for ferromagnets that undergo a magnetic phase transition. First order phase transitions are characterized by a discontinuity in the magnetization changes with temperature, resulting in a latent heat. Second order phase transitions do not have this latent heat associated with the phase transition.

In the late 1990s Pecharksy and Gschneidner reported a magnetic entropy change in that was about 50% larger than that reported for Gd metal, which had the largest known magnetic entropy change at the time. This giant magnetocaloric effect (GMCE) occurred at 270 K, which is lower than that of Gd (294 K). Since the MCE occurs below room temperature these materials would not be suitable for refrigerators operating at room temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1038/NMAT3951&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since then other alloys have also demonstrated the giant magnetocaloric effect. These include , and alloys. Gadolinium and its alloys undergo second-order phase transitions that have no magnetic or thermal hysteresis. However, the use of rare earth elements makes these materials very expensive.

 (X = Ga, Co, In, Al, Sb) Heusler alloys are also promising candidates for magnetic cooling applications because they have Curie temperatures near room temperature and, depending on composition, can have martensitic phase transformations near room temperature. These materials exhibit the magnetic shape memory effect and can also be used as actuators, energy harvesting devices, and sensors. When the martensitic transformation temperature and the Curie temperature are the same (based on composition) the magnitude of the magnetic entropy change is the largest. In February 2014, GE announced the development of a functional Ni-Mn-based magnetic refrigerator.

The development of this technology is very material-dependent and will likely not replace vapor-compression refrigeration without significantly improved materials that are cheap, abundant, and exhibit much larger magnetocaloric effects over a larger range of temperatures. Such materials need to show significant temperature changes under a field of two tesla or less, so that permanent magnets can be used for the production of the magnetic field.

=== Paramagnetic salts ===

The original proposed refrigerant was a paramagnetic salt, such as cerium magnesium nitrate. The active magnetic dipoles in this case are those of the electron shells of the paramagnetic atoms.

In a paramagnetic salt ADR, the heat sink is usually provided by a pumped (about 1.2 K) or (about 0.3 K) cryostat. An easily attainable 1 T magnetic field is generally required for initial magnetization. The minimum temperature attainable is determined by the self-magnetization tendencies of the refrigerant salt, but temperatures from 1 to 100 mK are accessible. Dilution refrigerators had for many years supplanted paramagnetic salt ADRs, but interest in space-based and simple to use lab-ADRs has remained, due to the complexity and unreliability of the dilution refrigerator.

At a low enough temperature, paramagnetic salts become either diamagnetic or ferromagnetic, limiting the lowest temperature that can be reached using this method.

=== Nuclear demagnetization ===

One variant of adiabatic demagnetization that continues to find substantial research application is nuclear demagnetization refrigeration (NDR). NDR follows the same principles, but in this case the cooling power arises from the magnetic dipoles of the nuclei of the refrigerant atoms, rather than their electron configurations. Since these dipoles are of much smaller magnitude, they are less prone to self-alignment and have lower intrinsic minimum fields. This allows NDR to cool the nuclear spin system to very low temperatures, often 1 μK or below. Unfortunately, the small magnitudes of nuclear magnetic dipoles also makes them less inclined to align to external fields. Magnetic fields of 3 teslas or greater are often needed for the initial magnetization step of NDR.

In NDR systems, the initial heat sink must sit at very low temperatures (10–100 mK). This precooling is often provided by the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator or a paramagnetic salt.

== Commercial development ==

Research and a demonstration proof of concept device in 2001 succeeded in applying commercial-grade materials and permanent magnets at room temperatures to construct a magnetocaloric refrigerator.

On August 20, 2007, the Risø National Laboratory (Denmark) at the Technical University of Denmark, claimed to have reached a milestone in their magnetic cooling research when they reported a temperature span of 8.7 K. They hoped to introduce the first commercial applications of the technology by 2010.

As of 2013 this technology had proven commercially viable only for ultra-low temperature cryogenic applications available for decades. Magnetocaloric refrigeration systems are composed of pumps, motors, secondary fluids, heat exchangers of different types, magnets and magnetic materials. These processes are greatly affected by irreversibilities and should be adequately considered.
At year-end, Cooltech Applications announced that its first commercial refrigeration equipment would enter the market in 2014. Cooltech Applications launched their first commercially available magnetic refrigeration system on 20 June 2016.
At the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, a consortium of Haier, Astronautics Corporation of America and BASF presented the first cooling appliance. BASF claim of their technology a 35% improvement over using compressors.

In November 2015, at the Medica 2015 fair, Cooltech Applications presented, in collaboration with Kirsch medical GmbH, the world&#x27;s first magnetocaloric medical cabinet. One year later, in September 2016, at the 7th International Conference on Magnetic Refrigeration at Room Temperature (Thermag VII)] held in Torino, Italy, Cooltech Applications presented the world&#x27;s first magnetocaloric frozen heat exchanger.

In 2017, Cooltech Applications presented a fully functional 500 liters&#x27; magnetocaloric cooled cabinet with a load and an air temperature inside the cabinet of +2°C. That proved that magnetic refrigeration is a mature technology, capable of replacing the classic refrigeration solutions.

One year later, in September 2018, at the 8th International Conference on Magnetic Refrigeration at Room Temperature (Thermag VIII]), Cooltech Applications presented a paper on a magnetocaloric prototype designed as a 15 kW proof-of-concept unit. This has been considered by the community as the largest magnetocaloric prototype ever created.

At the same conference, Dr. Sergiu Lionte announced that, due to financial issues, Cooltech Applications declared bankruptcy. Later on, in 2019 Ubiblue company, today named Magnoric, is formed by some of the old Cooltech Application&#x27;s team members. The entire patent portfolio form Cooltech Applications was taken over by Magnoric since then, while publishing additional patents at the same time.

In 2019, at the 5th Delft Days Conference on Magnetocalorics, Dr. Sergiu Lionte presented Ubiblue&#x27;s (former Cooltech Application) last prototype. Later, the magnetocaloric community acknowledged that Ubiblue had the most developed magnetocalorics prototypes.

Thermal and magnetic hysteresis problems remain to be solved for first-order phase transition materials that exhibit the GMCE.

One potential application is in spacecraft.

Vapor-compression refrigeration units typically achieve performance coefficients of 60% of that of a theoretical ideal Carnot cycle, much higher than current MR technology. Small domestic refrigerators are however much less efficient.

In 2014 giant anisotropic behavior of the magnetocaloric effect was found in at 10 K. The anisotropy of the magnetic entropy change gives rise to a large rotating MCE offering the possibility to build simplified, compact, and efficient magnetic cooling systems by rotating it in a constant magnetic field.

In 2015 Aprea &quot;et al.&quot; presented a new refrigeration concept, GeoThermag, which is a combination of magnetic refrigeration technology with that of low-temperature geothermal energy. To demonstrate the applicability of the GeoThermag technology, they developed a pilot system that consists of a 100-m deep geothermal probe; inside the probe, water flows and is used directly as a regenerating fluid for a magnetic refrigerator operating with gadolinium. The GeoThermag system showed the ability to produce cold water even at 281.8 K in the presence of a heat load of 60 W. In addition, the system has shown the existence of an optimal frequency f AMR, 0.26 Hz, for which it was possible to produce cold water at 287.9 K with a thermal load equal to 190 W with a COP of 2.20. Observing the temperature of the cold water that was obtained in the tests, the GeoThermag system showed a good ability to feed the cooling radiant floors and a reduced capacity for feeding the fan coil systems.

== History ==

The effect was discovered first observed by German physicist Emil Warburg in 1881 Subsequently by French physicist Pierre Weiss and Swiss physicist Auguste Piccard in 1917.

Major advances first appeared in the late 1920s when cooling via adiabatic demagnetization was independently proposed by chemistry Nobel Laureates Peter Debye in 1926 and William F. Giauque in 1927.

It was first demonstrated experimentally by Giauque and his colleague D. P. MacDougall in 1933 for cryogenic purposes when they reached 0.25 K. Between 1933 and 1997, advances in MCE cooling occurred.

In 1997, the first near room-temperature proof of concept magnetic refrigerator was demonstrated by Karl A. Gschneidner, Jr. by the Iowa State University at Ames Laboratory. This event attracted interest from scientists and companies worldwide who started developing new kinds of room temperature materials and magnetic refrigerator designs.

A major breakthrough came 2002 when a group at the University of Amsterdam demonstrated the giant magnetocaloric effect in MnFe(P,As) alloys that are based on abundant materials.

Refrigerators based on the magnetocaloric effect have been demonstrated in laboratories, using magnetic fields starting at 0.6 T up to 10 T. Magnetic fields above 2 T are difficult to produce with permanent magnets and are produced by a superconducting magnet (1 T is about 20.000 times the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field).

=== Room temperature devices ===
Recent research has focused on near room temperature. Constructed examples of room temperature magnetic refrigerators include:

In one example, Prof. Karl A. Gschneidner, Jr. unveiled a proof of concept magnetic refrigerator near room temperature on February 20, 1997. He also announced the discovery of the GMCE in on June 9, 1997. Since then, hundreds of peer-reviewed articles have been written describing materials exhibiting magnetocaloric effects.

<text>Bies (Polish), bes ( , Slovene, Montenegrin) or bijes (Bosnian, Croatian) is an evil spirit or demon in Slavic mythology. Under the influence of Christianity the word often became synonymous with chort.

After the acceptance of Christianity the &quot;bies&quot; (same as chort or czort) became identified with the devil, corresponding to the being referred to in Ancient Greek, as either &quot;daimon&quot; (δαίμων), &quot;daimónion&quot; or &quot;pneuma&quot; (πνεῦμα). For example, &quot;biesy&quot; (Russian plural of &quot;bies&quot;) is used in the standard Russian translation of Mark 5:12, where we have &quot;the devils&quot; entering the swine in KJV. Compare to Ukrainian &quot;bisy&quot; or &quot;bisytysia&quot; and Polish &quot;zbiesić się&quot; (to go mad). In Slovenian (bes), Croatian (bijes) and Serbian (bes) the word means &quot;rage&quot;, &quot;fury&quot;. It comes from the proto-Slavic .

== Equivalents in non-Slavic traditions ==
In the mythology of Jah Hut people, one of the Orang Asli tribes living in Malaysia, there are beings called bès. This word generally refers to dangerous spirits living in the jungle and often attacking people, causing illnesses by spirit possession etc. It is possible to tame them by carving &quot;sepili&quot; - small wooden sculptures depicting the bès one has troubles with. If the bès likes its look, they may move into the sculpture in which moment they can be trapped inside by a special ritual. After it is done, people must make sure to get the sepili as far away from their village as possible to avoid bès&#x27; anger once they break free. Traditionally, they bury the sepili deep in the jungle. Nowadays, many native artists also sell their sepili as souvenirs to tourists.

== Examples in culture ==

*In Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of the Priest and of His Workman Balda&quot;, there is a scene in which Balda has to force the &quot;devils&quot; (черти, Chorti) of the sea to pay an ancient rent, and interacts with an &quot;Old Bies&quot; who is their leader and his grandson. It is also the title of his poem &quot;Demons&quot; (Бесы ). 
*The original Russian title of Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s novel known in its English translation as &quot;The Possessed&quot; is &quot;Besy&quot; (Бесы) (Russian plural of &quot;bes&quot;), i.e., more literally, &quot;The Evil Spirits&quot;.
*Fyodor Sologub’s most famous novel was Мелкий бес (&quot;The Petty Demon&quot;, 1907)
*The Black Tapes
*In the 2015 videogame &quot;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&quot;, fiends (called &quot;bies&quot; in the original version) are massive horned predators who possess hypnotic and self-healing powers.
*In Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić&#x27;s &quot;Croatian Tales of Long Ago&quot; &quot;bjesovi&quot; appear.
*They also appear in a game known as roams.io where they can spin into a tornado.

<text>Alan Martin Dukes (born April 1945) is an Irish former Fine Gael politician who served as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communication from 1996 to 1997, leader of the Opposition and leader of Fine Gael from 1987 to 1990, Minister for Justice from 1986 to 1987, Minister for Finance from 1982 to 1986 and Minister for Agriculture from 1981 to 1982. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1981 to 2002.

He held several senior government positions and is one of the few TDs to be appointed a minister on their first day in the Dáil. He lost his seat in the 2002 general election. He was subsequently appointed Director General of the Institute of International and European Affairs, and chairman of Anglo Irish Bank.

==Early life==
Dukes was born in Drimnagh, Dublin in April 1945. His father, James F. Dukes, was originally from Tralee, County Kerry, and was a senior civil servant, the founding chairman and chief executive of the Higher Education Authority, while his mother was from near Ballina, County Mayo.

The Dukes family originally came from the north of England. His grandfather had served with the Royal Engineers in World War I and settled in Cork and then Kerry afterwards where he worked with the Post Office creating Ireland&#x27;s telephone network. He also developed a keen interest in the Irish language.

He was educated by the Christian Brothers at Coláiste Mhuire, Dublin, and was offered several scholarships for third level on graduation, including one for the Irish language. His interest in the Irish language continues to this day, and he regularly appears on Irish-language television programmes.

On leaving school he attended University College Dublin, where he captained the fencing team to its first-ever Intervarsity title.

==Career before politics==
He became an economist with the Irish Farmers&#x27; Association (IFA) in Dublin in 1969. After Ireland joined the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973, he moved to Brussels where he was part of the IFA delegation. In this role, he was influential in framing Ireland&#x27;s contribution to the Common Agricultural Policy.

He was appointed as chief of staff to Ireland&#x27;s EEC commissioner Dick Burke, a former Fine Gael politician.

== Early political career ==
In the 1979 European Parliament election, Dukes stood as a Fine Gael candidate in the Munster constituency. He had strong support among the farming community, but the entry of T. J. Maher, a former president of the IFA, as an independent candidate hurt his chances of election. Maher topped the poll.

He stood again for Fine Gael at the 1981 general election in the expanded Kildare constituency, where he won a seat in the 22nd Dáil. On his first day in the Dáil, he was appointed Minister for Agriculture by the Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, becoming one of only eight TDs so appointed. He was to represent Kildare for 21 years.

This minority Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition government collapsed in February 1982 on the budget, but returned to power with a working majority in December 1982. Dukes was again appointed to cabinet, becoming Minister for Finance less than two years into his Dáil career.

He faced a difficult task as finance minister at this time. Ireland was heavily in debt while unemployment and emigration were high. Many of Fine Gael&#x27;s plans were deferred while the Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition disagreed on how to solve the economic crisis. The challenge of addressing the national finances was made difficult by electoral arithmetic and a lack of support from the opposition Fianna Fáil party led by Charles Haughey.

Dukes remained in the Department of Finance until a reshuffle in February 1986 when he was appointed as Minister for Justice.

==Leadership of Fine Gael==

Fine Gael failed to be returned to government at the 1987 general election and lost 19 of its 70 seats, mostly to the new Progressive Democrats. Outgoing Taoiseach and leader Garret FitzGerald stepped down and Dukes was elected leader of Fine Gael, becoming leader of the Opposition.

This was a difficult time for the country. Haughey&#x27;s Fianna Fáil had fought the election on promises to increase spending and government services, and by attacking the cutbacks favoured by Fine Gael. The campaign produced the famous Fianna Fáil slogan that cuts in health spending affect the &quot;old, the sick and the handicapped&quot;. However, on taking office, the new Taoiseach and his finance minister Ray MacSharry immediately drew up a set of cutbacks including a spate of ward and hospital closures. This presented a political opportunity for the opposition to attack the government.

However, while addressing a meeting of the Tallaght Chamber of Commerce, Dukes announced, in what became known as the Tallaght Strategy that:
This represented a major departure in Irish politics whereby Fine Gael would vote with the minority Fianna Fáil Government if it adopted Fine Gael&#x27;s economic policies for revitalising the economy.

The consequences of this statement were huge. The Haughey government was able to take severe corrective steps to restructure the economy and lay the foundations for the economic boom of the nineties. However, at a snap election in 1989 Dukes did not receive electoral credit for this approach, and the party only made minor gains, gaining four seats. The outcome was the first-ever coalition government for Fianna Fáil, whose junior partner was the Progressive Democrats led by former Fianna Fáil TD Desmond O&#x27;Malley.

==1990 presidential election and loss of the leadership==
The party&#x27;s failure to make significant gains in 1989 left some Fine Gael TDs with a desire for a change at the top of the party. Their opportunity came in the wake of the historic 1990 presidential election. Fine Gael chose Austin Currie TD as their candidate. He had been a leading member of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association movement in the 1960s and had been a member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) before moving south.

Initially, Fianna Fáil&#x27;s Brian Lenihan Snr was the favourite to win. However, after several controversies arose, relating to the brief Fianna Fáil administration of 1982, and Lenihan&#x27;s dismissal as Minister for Defence midway through the campaign, the Labour Party&#x27;s Mary Robinson emerged victorious. To many in Fine Gael, the humiliation of finishing third was too much to bear and a campaign was launched against Dukes&#x27; leadership. He was subsequently replaced as party leader by John Bruton.

==Rainbow Coalition==
Bruton brought him back to the front bench in September 1992, shortly before the November 1992 general election. In February 1994, Dukes became involved in a failed attempt to oust Bruton as leader and subsequently resigned from the front bench. Bruton became Taoiseach in December 1994. Dukes was not appointed to cabinet at the formation of the government.

In December 1996, Dukes returned as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications following the resignation of Michael Lowry. At the 1997 general election, Dukes topped the poll in the new Kildare South constituency, but Fine Gael lost office. He became Chairman of the Irish Council of the European Movement; in this position, he was very involved in advising many of the Eastern European countries who were then applying to join the European Union.

In 2001, he backed Michael Noonan in his successful bid to become leader of Fine Gael.

==Career post-politics==
After 21 years, Dukes lost his Dáil seat at the 2002 general election. This contest saw many high-profile casualties for Fine Gael, including Deputy Leader Jim Mitchell, former deputy leader Nora Owen and others. Many local commentators felt that Dukes&#x27;s loss was down to a lack of attention to local issues, for he was highly involved in European projects and had always enjoyed a national profile.

He retired from frontline politics that year and was subsequently appointed Director General of the Institute of International and European Affairs. He remained active within Fine Gael and served several terms as the party&#x27;s vice-president.

From 2001 to 2011, Dukes was President of the Alliance Française in Dublin, and in June 2004, the French Government appointed him an Officer of the Legion of Honour.

In April 2004, Dukes was awarded the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland.

In December 2008, he was appointed by Finance Minister Brian Lenihan Jnr as a public interest director on the board of Anglo Irish Bank. The bank was subsequently nationalised, and he served on the board until the IBRC was liquidated in 2013.

In January 2009, Dukes was a judge on the TG4 reality TV show &quot;Feirm Factor&quot;.

From 2011 to 2013, Dukes served as chairman of the Board of Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind. In 2011, Dukes founded the think tank Asia Matters, which inked an agreement with the Chinese People&#x27;s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries in May 2019.

Dukes receives annual pension payments of €129,805.

==Personal life==
Dukes has lived in Kildare town since first being elected to represent the Kildare constituency in 1981. His wife Fionnuala () is a former local politician and served as a member of Kildare County Council from 1999 until her retirement in 2009. She served as Cathaoirleach of the council from 2006 to 2007, becoming only the second woman to hold the position in the body&#x27;s hundred-year history. They have two daughters.

<text>The Red Poll is a dual-purpose breed of cattle developed in England in the latter half of the 19th century. The Red Poll is a cross of the Norfolk Red beef cattle and Suffolk Dun dairy cattle breeds.

==Description and uses==
The cattle are red, preferably deep red with white only on the tail switch and udder. They are naturally polled (without horns). Red Poll cattle are mainly used as beef suckler cows, although a few dairy herds are found in England, as well as in the United States in the state of Texas. They are known for easy calving and successfully rearing a high proportion of their calves. They are sometimes used for conservation grazing.

==History==
The Red Poll originated as a cross between Norfolk Red beef-type cattle and Suffolk Dun dairy cattle (both of these breeds are now extinct). The parent Suffolk breed was also polled; Norfolk cattle had horns, but the gene for horns was bred out in the Red Poll breed. The original name for the breed, adopted in 1863, was Norfolk and Suffolk Red Polled cattle, and the first standard description was agreed upon in 1873, with the first herd book compiled in 1874. The breed became the Red Polled in 1883, and then Red Poll in 1888, when the Red Poll Cattle Society was formed.

They are considered to be part of the &quot;Suffolk Trinity&quot; with Suffolk sheep and Suffolk Punch heavy horses.

Red Poll cattle were imported into Australia in the mid-19th century, where they are now used for beef production. The first identified breeder in Australia was James Graves, around 1870, although there is evidence of earlier herds.

These cattle were introduced to the United States by G. P. Taber of New York State in 1873. The Red Poll dual-purpose bred is the oldest registered breed in the United States and is celebrating its 125th year. The breed is beginning to be reintroduced into some areas of the western US for the small ranch and backyard beef and 4H, as their docile nature makes them easy for the novice to handle. In 2010, Pfizer Animal Health testing of a Red Polled Bull Power Hawk tested a minus -2.58 MVP showing he was in top 1% for feed efficiency indicating Red Poll Cattle have genetics to improve feed efficiency that is important to profitability and grass finishing ability in a moderate frame. Feed testing of steers averaged 2.88 weaning to slaughter for a small Washington feeder in 2012.

The Red Poll breed was first brought to New Zealand in 1898, but a herd was not established until 1917, when 22 animals were transported from Australia.

<text>The stone-curlews, also known as dikkops or thick-knees, consist of 10 species within the family Burhinidae, and are found throughout the tropical and temperate parts of the world, with two or more species occurring in some areas of Africa, Asia, and Australia. Despite the group being classified as waders, most species have a preference for arid or semiarid habitats.

==Taxonomy==
The family Burhinidae was introduced in 1912 for the stone-curlews by Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews. The family contains three genera: &quot;Hesperoburhinus&quot;, &quot;Burhinus&quot; and &quot;Esacus&quot;. The name &quot;Burhinus&quot; combines the Ancient Greek &quot;bous&quot; meaning &quot;ox&quot; and &quot;rhis&quot;, &quot;rhinos&quot; meaning &quot;nose&quot; (or &quot;bill&quot;).

Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the family Burhinidae is sister to a clade containing the sheathbills in the family Chionidae and the Magellanic plover in its own family Pluvianellidae. The stone-curlews are not closely related to the curlews, genus &quot;Numenius&quot;, that belong to the sandpiper family Scolopacidae.

==Description==
They are medium to large birds with strong black or yellow black bills, large yellow eyes—which give them a reptilian appearance—and cryptic plumage. The names thick-knee and stone-curlew are both in common use. The term stone-curlew owes its origin to the broad similarities with true curlews. Thick-knee refers to the prominent joints in the long yellow or greenish legs and apparently originated with a name coined in 1776 for &quot;B. oedicnemus&quot;, the Eurasian stone-curlew.
Obviously the heel (ankle) and the knee are confused here.

==Behaviour==
They are largely nocturnal, particularly when singing their loud, wailing songs, which are reminiscent of true curlews. Their diet consists mainly of insects and other invertebrates. Larger species also take lizards and even small mammals. Most species are sedentary, but the Eurasian stone-curlew is a summer migrant in the temperate European part of its range, wintering in Africa.

==Species==
The earliest definitive stone-curlew is &quot;Genucrassum bransatensis&quot; from the Late Oligocene of France. &quot;Wilaru&quot;, described from the Late Oligocene to the Early Miocene of Australia, was originally classified as a stone-curlew, but was subsequently argued to be a member of the extinct anseriform family Presbyornithidae, instead. The living species are:

<text>Niels T. Ferguson (born 10 December 1965, Eindhoven) is a Dutch cryptographer and consultant who currently works for Microsoft. He has worked with others, including Bruce Schneier, designing cryptographic algorithms, testing algorithms and protocols, and writing papers and books. Among the designs Ferguson has contributed to is the AES finalist block cipher algorithm Twofish as well as the stream cipher Helix and the Skein hash function.

In 1999, Niels Ferguson, together with Bruce Schneier and John Kelsey, developed the Yarrow algorithm, a Cryptographically-Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator (CSPRNG). Yarrow was later further developed by Niels Ferguson and Bruce Schneier into the Fortuna CSPRNG.

In 2001, he claimed to have broken the HDCP system that is incorporated into HD DVD and Blu-ray Discs players, similar to the DVDs Content Scramble System, but has not published his research, citing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which would make such publication illegal.

In 2006 he published a paper covering some of his work around Bitlocker full disk encryption at Microsoft.

At the CRYPTO 2007 conference rump session, Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson presented an informal paper describing a potential kleptographic backdoor in the NIST specified Dual_EC_DRBG cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator. The kleptographic backdoor was confirmed to be real in 2013 as part of the Edward Snowden leaks.

<text>USS &quot;New York&quot; (ACR-2/CA-2) was the second United States Navy armored cruiser so designated; the first was the ill-fated , which was soon redesignated a second-class battleship. Due to the unusually protracted construction of &quot;Maine&quot;, &quot;New York&quot; was actually the first armored cruiser to enter U.S. Navy service. The fourth Navy ship to be named in honor of the state of New York, she was later renamed Saratoga and then Rochester. With six 8-inch guns, she was the most heavily armed cruiser in the US Navy when commissioned.

She was laid down on 19 September 1890 by William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia, launched on 2 December 1891, and sponsored by Miss Helen Clifford Page, the daughter of J. Seaver Page, the secretary of the Union League Club of New York. &quot;New York&quot; was commissioned 1 August 1893, Captain John Philip in command.

==Design and construction==

===Acquisition===
In 1888, during the 50th Congress, 3.5 million dollars was authorized for the construction of &quot;New York&quot;. She was designed by the Navy Department. On 28 August 1890, the contract for her construction was awarded to William Cramp &amp; Sons of Philadelphia.

===Armament===

&quot;New York&quot; as built had a main armament of six /35 caliber Mark 3 breech-loading rifles in two twin Mark 5 turrets fore and aft and two open single Mark 3 and/or Mark 4 mounts on the sides. Secondary armament was twelve /40 caliber rapid fire (RF) guns in sponsons along the sides, along with eight 6-pounder () Driggs-Schroeder RF guns, four 1-pounder () Driggs-Schroeder RF guns, and three torpedo tubes for Howell torpedoes.

===Armor===

&quot;New York&quot;, as an armored cruiser, had good protection. The belt was thick and deep, of which was below the waterline. It was long, protecting only the machinery spaces. The armored deck was thick on its sloped sides and in the flat middle amidships, but only at the ends. The original gun turrets had up to of armor, on barbettes with protecting the ammunition hoists. The open single 8-inch mounts on the sides were much less protected by partial barbettes, while the secondary gun sponsons had . The conning tower was thick. During construction, the builder reconfigured &quot;New York&quot;″s boiler arrangement for tighter compartmentation.

===Comparison with foreign ships===

&quot;New York&quot; was a fast armored cruiser with a powerful armament, but the belt armor was thin compared to the first generation of older, slow armored cruisers, which tended to have a thick but narrow-coverage (waterline) belt. The thin side armor was comparable to that of the groundbreaking French armored cruiser , but the French ship&#x27;s armor covered a much greater area of the hull. &quot;New York&quot; had a greater number of heavy guns than the French cruiser. The hull protection of both ships was superior to their main rival, the British , which were the largest cruisers at the time but had no side armor. The British had switched from building armored cruisers to favor very large, first class protected cruisers, and stuck with this policy until after the .

===Engineering===

Along with having competitive weapons and armor, &quot;New York&quot; was intended to be relatively fast at , and achieved on trials. This was achieved with four triple-expansion engines totaling , two clutched in tandem on each of two shafts. The forward engines could be disconnected to conserve fuel at an economical cruising speed. In the US Navy, only shared this feature, which proved something of a liability in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba when both ships were operating with the forward engines disconnected and did not have time to reconnect them, thus limiting their speed. As built, eight coal-fired cylindrical boilers supplied steam to the engines.

===Refits===

&quot;New York&quot; underwent an extensive refit in 1905–1909. Her main guns and turrets were replaced with four /45 caliber Mark 6 guns in new Mark 12 turrets. The new turrets and barbettes had improved Krupp cemented armor, with up to on the turrets and - on the barbettes. The side 8-inch guns and torpedo tubes were removed. The secondary armament was replaced as well, with ten /50 caliber Mark 6 guns and eight /50 caliber guns. She also received twelve Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers and the funnels were extended to improve natural draft through the boilers. A further refit during World War I removed two 5-inch and all of the 3-inch single-purpose guns, adding two /50 anti-aircraft guns. In 1927 her boilers were reduced to four with two funnels, leaving only .

==Service==
In July 1893 &quot;New York&quot; performed sea trials using the Five Fathom Bank light station and the North East End light station as markers, achieving with at a displacement of 8,480 tons; at the time she was said to be the fastest armored vessel in the world. On 1 August 1893 &quot;New York&quot; was commissioned at Philadelphia, Captain John Philip in command. After completion, she was accepted by the Navy and left Cramp shipyards on 6 September for the League Island Navy Yard to load stores.

===USS &quot;New York&quot; (ACR-2)===
Assigned to the South Atlantic Squadron, &quot;New York&quot; departed New York Harbor on 27 December 1893 for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Arriving at Taipu Beach in January 1894, she remained there until heading home on 23 March, via Nicaragua and the West Indies. Transferred to the North Atlantic Squadron in August, the cruiser returned to West Indian waters for winter exercises and was commended for her aid during a fire that threatened to destroy Port of Spain, Trinidad.

Returning to New York, &quot;New York&quot; joined the European Squadron in 1895, and steamed to Kiel, where she represented the United States at the opening of the Kiel Canal. Rejoining the North Atlantic Squadron, she operated off Fort Monroe, Charleston, and New York through 1897.

&quot;New York&quot; departed Fort Monroe on 17 January 1898 for Key West. After the declaration of the Spanish–American War in April, she steamed to Cuba and bombarded the defenses at Matanzas before joining other American ships at San Juan in May, seeking the Spanish squadron. Not finding them, they bombarded Castillo San Felipe del Morro at San Juan (12 May) before withdrawing. &quot;New York&quot; then became flagship of Admiral William T. Sampson&#x27;s squadron, as the American commander planned the campaign against Santiago. However, &quot;New York&quot; was taking Admiral Sampson to a meeting with Major General William Shafter when the Spanish fleet made its breakout attempt, some of her engines were disconnected which reduced her speed, and she was only able to participate in the closing phases of the battle. The Battle of Santiago de Cuba on 3 July resulted in complete destruction of the Spanish fleet.

The cruiser sailed for New York on 14 August to receive a warrior&#x27;s welcome. The next year, she cruised with various state naval militia units to Cuba, Bermuda, Honduras, and Venezuela, and conducted summer tactical operations off New England. On 17 October 1899, she departed New York for Central and South American trouble areas.

&quot;New York&quot; was transferred to the Asiatic Fleet in 1901, sailing via Gibraltar, Port Said, and Singapore to Cavite, where she became flagship of the Asiatic Fleet. She steamed to Yokohama in July for the unveiling of the memorial to the Perry Expedition. In October, &quot;New York&quot; visited Samar and other Philippine islands as part of the campaign against insurgents. On 13 March 1902, she got underway for Hong Kong and other Chinese ports. In September, she visited Vladivostok, Russia, then stopped at Korea before returning to San Francisco in November. In 1903, &quot;New York&quot; transferred to the Pacific Squadron and cruised with it to Ampala, Honduras in February to protect American interests during turbulence there. Steaming via Magdalena Bay, Mexico, the cruiser returned to San Francisco, for a reception for President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1904, &quot;New York&quot; joined squadron cruises off Panama and Peru, then reported to Puget Sound in June where she became flagship of the Pacific Squadron. In September, she enforced the President&#x27;s neutrality order during the Russo-Japanese War. &quot;New York&quot; was at Valparaíso, Chile from 21 December 1904 – 4 January 1905, then sailed to Boston and decommissioned on 31 March for modernization.

Recommissioning on 15 May 1909, &quot;New York&quot; departed Boston on 25 June for Algiers and Naples, where she joined the Armored Cruiser Squadron on 10 July and sailed with it for home on the 23rd. Operating out of Atlantic and gulf ports for the next year, she went into fleet reserve on 31 December.

In full commission again on 1 April 1910, &quot;New York&quot; steamed via Gibraltar, Port Said, and Singapore to join the Asiatic Fleet at Manila on 6 August. While stationed in Asiatic waters, she cruised among the Philippine Islands, and ports in China and Japan.

She was renamed Saratoga on 16 February 1911, to make the name &quot;New York&quot; available for the battleship .

===USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; (ACR-2)===
The cruiser spent the next five years in the Far East. Steaming to Bremerton, Washington on 6 February 1916, &quot;Saratoga&quot; went into reduced commission with the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

As the U.S. drew closer to participation in World War I, &quot;Saratoga&quot; commissioned in full on 23 April 1917, and joined the Pacific Patrol Force on 7 June. In September, &quot;Saratoga&quot; steamed to Mexico to counter enemy activity in the troubled country. At Ensenada, &quot;Saratoga&quot; intercepted and helped to capture a merchantman transporting 32 German agents and several Americans seeking to avoid the draft law.

In November, she transited the Panama Canal, joining the Cruiser Force, Atlantic Fleet at Hampton Roads. Here, she was renamed Rochester on 1 December 1917, to free the name &quot;Saratoga&quot; for the new battlecruiser (eventually the aircraft carrier CV-3).

===USS &quot;Rochester&quot; (ACR-2/CA-2)===
After escorting a convoy to France, &quot;Rochester&quot; commenced target and defense instruction of armed guard crews, in Chesapeake Bay. In March 1918, she resumed escorting convoys and continued the duty through the end of the war, with Alfred Walton Hinds in command. On her third trip, with convoy HM-58, a U-boat torpedoed the British steamer &quot;Atlantian&quot; on 9 June. &quot;Rochester&quot; sped to her aid, but &quot;Atlantian&quot; sank within five minutes. Other ships closed in, but the submarine was not seen again.

After the Armistice, &quot;Rochester&quot; served as a transport bringing troops home. In May 1919, she served as flagship of the destroyer squadron guarding the transatlantic flight of the Navy&#x27;s Curtiss NC seaplanes. On 17 July 1920 she was redesignated with the hull number CA-2 (heavy cruiser) as part of a fleetwide redesignation plan. In the early 1920s, she operated along the east coast.

Early in 1923, &quot;Rochester&quot; got underway for Guantánamo Bay to begin another period of service off the coasts of Central and South America.

In the summer of 1925, &quot;Rochester&quot; carried General John J. Pershing and other members of his commission to Arica, Chile to arbitrate the Tacna-Arica dispute and remained there for the rest of the year. In September 1926, she helped bring peace to turbulent Nicaragua and from time to time returned there in the late 1920s.

After a quiet 1927, &quot;Rochester&quot; relieved the gunboat at Corinto in 1928 as Expeditionary Forces directed efforts against bandits in the area. Disturbances boiled over in Haiti in 1929, and opposition to the government was strong; inasmuch as American lives were endangered, &quot;Rochester&quot; transported the 1st Marine Brigade to Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haïtien. In 1930, &quot;Rochester&quot; transported the five-man commission sent to investigate the situation. In March, she returned to the area to embark marines and transported them to the U.S. She aided Continental Oil tanker &quot;H. W. Bruce&quot;, damaged in a collision on 24 May.
In 1931, an earthquake rocked Nicaragua. &quot;Rochester&quot; was the first relief ship to arrive on the scene and ferried refugees from the area. Bandits took advantage of the chaotic conditions and &quot;Rochester&quot; steamed to the area to counter their activities.

&quot;Rochester&quot; departed Balboa on 25 February 1932 for service in the Pacific Fleet. She arrived Shanghai on 27 April, to join the fleet in the Yangtze River in June and remained there until steaming to Cavite, to decommission on 29 April 1933. She would remain moored at the Olongapo Shipyard at Subic Bay for the next eight years, serving as workshop and storage ship. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 October 1938, and she was scuttled on 24 December 1941 to prevent her capture by the Japanese.

==Dive site &quot;Rochester&quot;==

Since being scuttled, &quot;Rochester&quot; has been transformed into an artificial reef and is popular with divers given its somewhat shallow depth of , ease of access, and proximity to other wrecks. There is minimal damage to the vessel when it was scuttled and the wreck is relatively intact.

From 11 July 1967 to 20 July 1967 Harbor Clearance Team Four and Yard Light Lift Craft Two attached to Harbor Clearance Unit One conducted demolition as the U.S. Navy decided to try to flatten the wreck. Large charges were used on the central hull and these resulted in extensive damage around the midsection. This lowered the wreck; enabling deep draft tankers to approach and moor to the POL buoy planned for Subic Bay (at the same time, Navy divers helped to clear more than 650 wrecks from Manila bay).

<text>Weyburn is the tenth-largest city in Saskatchewan, Canada. The city has a population of 11,019. It is on the Souris River southeast of the provincial capital of Regina and is north from the North Dakota border in the United States. The name is reputedly a corruption of the Scottish &quot;wee burn,&quot; referring to a small creek. The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Weyburn No. 67.

== History ==
The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) reached the future site of Weyburn from Brandon, Manitoba in 1892 and the Soo Line from North Portal on the US border in 1893. A post office opened in 1895 and a land office in 1899 in anticipation of the land rush which soon ensued. In 1899, Knox Presbyterian Church was founded with its building constructed in 1906 in the high-pitched gable roof and arches, standing as a testimony to the faith and optimism in the Weyburn area. Weyburn was legally constituted a village in 1900, a town in 1903 and finally as a city in 1913. From 1910 until 1931 the Weyburn Security Bank was headquartered in the city.

Weyburn had since become an important railroad town in Saskatchewan – the Pasqua branch of the Souris, Arcola, Weyburn, Regina CPR branch; Portal Section of the CPR / Soo Line; Moose Jaw, Weyburn, Shaunavon, Lethbridge CPR section; the Brandon, Marfield, Carlyle, Lampman, Radville, Willow Bunch section of the Canadian National Railway (CNR); and the Regina, Weyburn, Radville, Estevan, Northgate CNR section have all run through Weyburn.

Weyburn was previously home to the Souris Valley Mental Health Hospital, which was closed as a health care facility and sold in 2006, and demolished in 2009. When the mental hospital opened in 1921, it was the largest building in the British Commonwealth and was considered to be on the cutting edge of experimental treatments for people with mental disabilities. The facility had a reputation of leading the way in therapeutic programming. At its peak, the facility was home to approximately 2,500 patients. The history of the facility is explored in the documentary &quot;Weyburn: An Archaeology of Madness&quot;.

<doc id="204942" wikidata="Q6456367" url="?curid=204942" title="L. Brent Bozell III">
<text>Leo Brent Bozell III ( ; born July 14, 1955) is an American conservative activist and writer. Bozell is the founder of the Media Research Center, an organization whose stated purpose is to identify liberal media bias.

==Early life and education==
Bozell is one of ten children of L. Brent Bozell Jr. and Patricia Buckley Bozell. He is a nephew of the late conservative writer and &quot;National Review&quot; founder William F. Buckley Jr. and the late United States Senator James L. Buckley through Buckley&#x27;s sister, Patricia, and is a grandson of William Frank Buckley Sr. He is of Irish, German, and English descent. Bozell&#x27;s father was William Buckley Jr.&#x27;s debating partner at Yale University and a conservative activist; his grandfather Leo B. Bozell was a co-founder of Bozell Worldwide. 

Bozell received a Bachelor of Arts in history from the University of Dallas in 1977.

==Career==
Bozell joined a since-disbanded organization called the National Conservative Political Action Committee, where he worked for the group&#x27;s founder, Terry Dolan, to help elect conservative politicians. 

Bozell ran the National Conservative Foundation project at the Conservative Political Action Conference, in which he moderated debates between Sam Donaldson and Robert Novak over media bias.

===Media Research Center===

In 1987, Bozell formed the Media Research Center, an organization whose stated purpose is to identify liberal media bias.

In 1998, Bozell founded an organization called the Conservative Communications Center. The MRC also established CNSNews, the site of the Conservative News Service, which was later known as Cybercast News Service, several additional Media Research Center-affiliated websites. On its website, MRC publishes Bozell&#x27;s syndicated columns, the &quot;CyberAlert&quot; daily newsletter documenting perceived media bias, and research reports on the news media.

In October 2006, Bozell founded the Culture and Media Institute, an MRC branch whose mission is to reduce what he claims to be a negative liberal influence on American morality, culture, and religious liberty.

====Ghostwriting scandal====
In February 2014, former employees of the Media Research Center confirmed media reports that Bozell does not write his own columns or books and has relied on a Media Research Center colleague, Tim Graham, to write them &quot;for years&quot;. Following revelation that Bozell does not write his own material, the &quot;Quad-City Times&quot;, a daily newspaper, announced that it was dropping Bozell&#x27;s column, reporting that, &quot;Bozell may have been comfortable representing others&#x27; work as his own. We&#x27;re not. The latest disclosure convinces us Bozell has no place on our print or web pages.&quot; The &quot;Quad-City Times&quot; article appeared under the headline, &quot;WANTED: A replacement for Brent Bozell&quot;.

Reports that Bozell did not write his own material were confirmed by his Media Research Center colleagues. On February 13, 2014, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; reported, &quot;Employees at the MRC were never under any illusion that Bozell had been writing his own copy. &#x27;It&#x27;s an open secret at the office that Graham writes Bozell&#x27;s columns, and has done so for years,&#x27; said one former employee. In fact, a former MRC employee went so far as to tell &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;: &#x27;I know for a fact that Bozell didn&#x27;t even read any of the drafts of his latest book until after it had been sent to the publishers&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;Talking Points Memo&quot; reported on February 14, 2014 that, &quot;Brent Bozell has staked much of his career on challenging what he sees as a lazy media establishment, all while reportedly collecting the profits from books and columns he never actually wrote.&quot; According to the report, &quot;despite not actually writing any of the content, Bozell still collects 80-90 percent of the profits.&quot;

====Parents Television Council====

Bozell founded the Parents Television and Media Council in 1995, initially as a branch of the Media Research Center focusing on entertainment television, after saying that he felt that decency was declining on prime-time television programming. The PTC&#x27;s stated mission was &quot;to promote and restore responsibility and decency to the entertainment industry.&quot;

During his tenure as PTC president, Bozell filed complaints with the FCC over what he alleged were indecent programs and attempted boycotts against advertisers on television programs the organization alleged were offensive. PTC was one of many organizations that filed complaints over the 2004 Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show in which co-performer Justin Timberlake caused a brief exposure of Janet Jackson&#x27;s right breast for which the FCC ultimately fined CBS. Excluding Super Bowl-related complaints, the vast majority of FCC complaints from 2003 to 2006 were found to have come from PTC.

In 2001, the PTC organized a mass advertiser boycott of the professional wrestling television program &quot;WWE SmackDown&quot; on UPN over claims that the program caused the deaths of young children whom the PTC felt were influenced by watching the program; in particular, the PTC cited the case of Lionel Tate, a 12-year-old Ft. Lauderdale boy who was arrested after murdering a 6-year-old girl. Tate&#x27;s attorney claimed that he had accidentally killed her when he botched a professional wrestling move. It was ultimately determined that the girl had been stomped to death and had not been the victim of any professional wrestling move and was actually watching cartoons at the time the murder occurred. World Wrestling Federation (now World Wrestling Entertainment, or WWE) sued Bozell and his organization for libel. PTC&#x27;s insurance carrier eventually chose to settle the case, paying $3.5 million to the WWE, and issuing a public apology.

In Bozell&#x27;s mandated apology as part of settling the libel charges, Bozell said: &quot;It was premature to reach that conclusion when we did, and there is now ample evidence to show that conclusion was incorrect. It was wrong to have stated or implied that WWE or any of its programs caused these tragic deaths.&quot;

Bozell and the PTC were criticized in a book entitled &quot;Foley is Good: And the Real World Is Faker Than Wrestling&quot; (2001), a memoir published by former WWE wrestler Mick Foley who questioned the reasoning and research PTC used to associate &quot;SmackDown&quot; with violent acts performed by children watching the program.

===Books===
Bozell has authored and/or co-authored the following books:

* &quot;And That&#x27;s the Way it Isn&#x27;t: A Reference Guide to Media Bias&quot; (with Brent Baker) (1990)
* &quot;Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media&quot; (2004)
* &quot;Whitewash: How The News Media Are Paving Hillary Clinton&#x27;s Path to the Presidency&quot; (with Tim Graham) (2007)
* &quot;Collusion: How The Media Stole The 2012 Election And How To Stop Them From Doing It In 2016&quot; (with Tim Graham) (2013)
* &quot;Unmasked: Big Media&#x27;s War on Trump&quot; (with Tim Graham) (2019)

===U.S. Agency for Global Media===

On January 22, 2025, Donald Trump said he would pick Bozell to run the U.S. Agency for Global Media.

==Presidential politics==
On December 22, 2011, Bozell appeared on a Fox News Channel segment. After being showed a clip in which an MSNBC journalist said that a Republican candidate looked like a &quot;car bomber&quot;, Bozell asked how media would react if someone said that President Barack Obama looked like a &quot;skinny ghetto crackhead&quot;.

Bozell was an outspoken critic of Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, describing him as &quot;the greatest charlatan of them all,&quot; a &quot;huckster,&quot; and a &quot;shameless self-promoter&quot;. He said, &quot;God help this country if this man were president.&quot;

After Trump clinched the Republican nomination, however, Bozell attacked the media for their alleged &quot;hatred&quot; of Trump. &quot;Politico&quot; noted, &quot;The paradox here is that Bozell was once more antagonistic toward the president than any journalist.&quot; Bozell singled out Jake Tapper of CNN for being &quot;one of the worst offenders&quot; in coverage of Trump.

In August 2020, Bozell told a meeting of conservatives and donors that &quot;leftists planned to steal this election.&quot; On January 6, after a mob of Trump supporters – including one of his sons – attacked the United States Capitol, Bozell appeared on Fox Business Network and denounced the riot, stating that &quot;you can never countenance police being attacked. You cannot countenance our national Capitol being breached like this. I think it is absolutely wrong.&quot; Bozell also said that &quot;Look, they are furious that they believe this election was stolen. I agree with them.&quot;

==Personal life==
Bozell is married to Norma Petruccione. They have five children and several grandchildren. Bozell has stated that contrary to speculation by some in the media, he is not officially a Republican.

Bozell was named the 1998 Alumnus of the Year at the University of Dallas. That same year, Grove City College named Bozell a Pew Memorial Lecturer.

Bozell&#x27;s son, David Bozell, is director of an organization called ForAmerica, a conservative group active on social media, founded by Bozell III in 2010.

Bozell&#x27;s other son, Leo Brent Bozell IV, participated in the 2021 United States Capitol attack; he entered the United States Senate chamber. Leo Brent Bozell IV was federally charged with obstructing an official proceeding, entering a restricted building, and disorderly conduct. He was convicted in September 2023 of ten charges, including five felonies and was sentenced to 45 months in federal prison. His father told the judge that his son &quot;is a good man&quot; and that he would not &quot;excuse the inexcusable behavior of his son&quot;.

<text>The Media Research Center (MRC) is an American conservative content analysis and media watchdog group based in Herndon, Virginia, and founded in 1987 by L. Brent Bozell III.

The nonprofit MRC has received financial support primarily from Robert Mercer, but with several other conservative-leaning sources, including the Bradley, Scaife, Olin, Castle Rock and JM foundations, as well as ExxonMobil. It has been described as &quot;one of the most active and best-funded, and yet least known&quot; arms of the modern conservative movement in the United States. The organization rejects the scientific consensus on climate change and attacks accurate media coverage that reflects the scientific consensus.

==Foundation and funding==

Bozell and a group of other American conservatives founded MRC on October 1, 1987. Their initial budget was at US$339,000. Prior to founding the MRC, Bozell was the chairman of the National Conservative Political Action Committee; he resigned from that position a month before establishing MRC. A wealthy donor whose name has been kept anonymous helped set up the MRC. The MRC has received financial support from several foundations, including the Bradley, Scaife, Olin, Castle Rock, Carthage and JM foundations. It also receives funding from ExxonMobil. The organization rejects the scientific consensus on climate change and criticizes media coverage that reflects the scientific consensus. The MRC received over $10 million from Robert Mercer, its largest single donor.

As of its 2015 reporting to the IRS, the organization had revenue approaching $15 million and expenses in excess of $15 million. Bozell&#x27;s salary during this year was reported as close to $345,000, with nearly $122,000 in additional compensation from the organization and related organizations.

==Projects==
===Reports on news media===

From 1996 to 2009, the MRC published a daily online newsletter called &quot;CyberAlert&quot; written by editor Brent Baker. Each issue profiles what he perceives as biased or inaccurate reports about politics in the American news media. Prior to &quot;CyberAlert&quot;, MRC published such reports in a monthly newsletter titled &quot;MediaWatch&quot;, from 1988 to 1999. Media analysis articles are now under the banner &quot;BiasAlert&quot;. Media analysis director Tim Graham and research director Rich Noyes regularly write &quot;Media Reality Check&quot;, another MRC publication documenting alleged liberal bias. &quot;Notable Quotables&quot; is its &quot;collection of the most biased quotes from journalists&quot;. In &quot;Notable Quotables&quot;, editors give honors such as the &quot;Linda Ellerbee Awards for Distinguished Reporting&quot; based on the former CNN commentator, who Bozell considered &quot;a liberal blowhard who has nothing to say&quot;. Other features on its website include the weekly syndicated news and entertainment columns written by founder Bozell.

MRC staff members have also written editorials and books about their findings of the media. Bozell has written three books about the news media: &quot;And That&#x27;s the Way it Isn&#x27;t: A Reference Guide to Media Bias&quot; (1990, with Brent Baker); &quot;Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media&quot; (2004); and &quot;Whitewash: How The News Media Are Paving Hillary Clinton&#x27;s Path to the Presidency&quot; (2007, with Tim Graham). Research director Rich Noyes has also co-authored several published books.

In 1992, the MRC created the Free Market Project to promote the culture of free enterprise and combat what it believes is media spin on business and economic news. That division recently changed its name to the Business &amp; Media Institute (www.businessandmedia.org) and later to MRC Business and is now focused on &quot;Advancing the culture of free enterprise in America.&quot; BMI&#x27;s advisory board included such well-known individuals as economists Walter Williams and Bruce Bartlett, as well as former CNN anchor David Goodnow. BMI is led by career journalist Dan Gainor, a former managing editor at CQ.com, the website for Congressional Quarterly. It released a research report in June 2006 covering the portrayal of business on prime-time entertainment television during the May and November &quot;sweeps&quot; periods from 2005. The report concluded that the programs, among them the long running NBC legal drama &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, were biased against business. Another report of the BMI accused the networks of bias in favor of the Gardasil vaccine, a vaccine intended to prevent cervical cancer.

===CNSNews===
Bozell founded CNSNews (formerly Cybercast News Service) in 1998 to cover stories he believes are ignored by mainstream news organizations. CNSNews.com provides news articles for Townhall.com and other websites for a subscription fee. Its leadership consists of president Brent Bozell and editor Terry Jeffrey. Under editor David Thibault, CNSNews.com questioned the validity of the circumstances in which Democratic Rep. John Murtha received his Purple Hearts as a response to Murtha&#x27;s criticisms of the U.S. War in Iraq. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and Nancy Pelosi have commented that this approach is similar to the tactics of the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth, which opposed John Kerry&#x27;s candidacy in the 2004 election.

===NewsBusters===
In the summer of 2005, Media Research Center launched NewsBusters, a website &quot;dedicated to exposing &amp; combating liberal media bias,&quot; in cooperation with Matthew Sheffield, a now-former conservative blogger (who now works at Salon.com) involved in the CBS Killian documents story. NewsBusters is styled as a rapid-response blog site that contains posts by MRC editors to selected stories in mass media. Although the site is advertised chiefly as a conservative site, it frequently defends neoconservatives as well. The site highlights journalists and non-journalists (writers, musicians, producers, scientists, etc.) perceived as having liberal viewpoints.

===Research on entertainment===

The MRC has produced research and analysis on the entertainment industry, as well. In May 1989, the MRC began publishing the newsletter &quot;TV, etc.&quot; Its mission, said Bozell in a 1992 lecture at The Heritage Foundation, was to &quot;document the left-wing antics within the entertainment industry&quot;. &quot;TV, etc.&quot; attracted immediate attention in entertainment circles. As noted by &quot;Broadcasting&quot; magazine, the debut issue of &quot;TV, etc.&quot; was critical of primetime TV shows like &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;Head of the Class&quot;, and &quot;thirtysomething&quot; for containing storylines or dialogue believed to be hostile to conservatives. Then at its annual convention in July 1989, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists passed a resolution criticizing the MRC&#x27;s newsletter.

A 1990 issue of &quot;TV, etc.&quot; published lyrics to the Todd Rundgren song &quot;Jesse&quot; that attacked Jesse Helms, Tipper Gore, and Pope John Paul II; Bozell also wrote to Warner Bros. Records urging the label not to include the song in Rundgren&#x27;s upcoming album.

&quot;TV, etc.&quot; also released annual lists of programs it deemed the &quot;most biased&quot;. For the 1991–92 season, &quot;The Trials of Rosie O&#x27;Neill&quot; made the top of that list; other shows ranked included &quot;Captain Planet and the Planeteers&quot;, &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

In 1993, Bozell wrote a letter to NBC in support of its show &quot;Against the Grain&quot; as the show was struggling in ratings. Bozell praised &quot;Against the Grain&quot; for &quot;staunch advocacy of education and gentle, respectful treatment of family life.&quot;

Following the 1994–95 television season, &quot;TV, etc.&quot; named the NBC made-for-TV movie &quot;Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story&quot; the most biased program of the season; others included &quot;Roseanne&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Then in 1995, Bozell founded the Parents Television Council, with a focus on combatting indecency on television.

In October 2006, the MRC created the Culture and Media Institute, the mission of which is &quot;to advance, preserve, and help restore America&#x27;s culture, character, traditional values, and morals against the assault of the liberal media.&quot; Robert H. Knight was the institute&#x27;s first director. MRC VP Dan Gainor is now in charge of that department. 

The CMI promoted its mission through editorials and research reports. In March 2007, the CMI published a &quot;National Cultural Values Survey&quot; and concluded from its results that most Americans perceived a decline in moral values. One study released by the organization in June 2007 claimed that television viewing time correlated directly with one&#x27;s liberal attitude, even possibly degrading to moral attitudes. In 2008, it published a report detailing its opposition to reinstatement of the FCC fairness doctrine, a policy requiring broadcasters to present differing views on controversial issues of public import. The MRC claims the rule had been politically weaponized by the Kennedy and Johnson administrations to suppress conservative radio, before being abolished by a bipartisan FCC in 1987.

The CBS crime drama &quot;Cold Case&quot; has been twice criticized by the CMI for alleged anti-Christian prejudice in two episodes. In May 2008, CMI released another report, one that claimed a moral decline in &quot;Dear Abby&quot; columns. The CMI website remained online through the end of 2010, before it was folded in the Media Research Center website in 2011. In November 2014, the MRC renamed the institute MRC Culture.

===Others===
MRC sponsors MRCTV (formerly Eyeblast), a conservative-leaning YouTube-like video-hosting site.

In 2018, the MRC started a new project in the Culture Department to monitor online censorship of conservatives called MRC TechWatch.

==Brent Bozell ghostwriting==
In February 2014, former employees of the Media Research Center alleged that the center&#x27;s founder L. Brent Bozell III does not write his own columns or books and instead has used a ghostwriter, Tim Graham, for years.

&quot;Employees at the MRC were never under any illusion that Bozell had been writing his own copy. &#x27;It&#x27;s an open secret at the office that Graham writes Bozell&#x27;s columns, and has done so for years,&#x27; said one former employee. In fact, a former MRC employee went so far as to tell &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, &#x27;I know for a fact that Bozell didn&#x27;t even read any of the drafts of his latest book until after it had been sent to the publishers,&#x27; &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; reported.&quot;

One newspaper, the &quot;Quad-City Times&quot; in Davenport, Iowa, dropped Bozell&#x27;s column as a result, saying, &quot;Bozell may have been comfortable representing others&#x27; work as his own. We&#x27;re not. The latest disclosure convinces us Bozell has no place on our print or web pages.&quot;

==Viewpoints==
In 2018, the Media Research Center criticized journalist Katy Tur for introducing the issue of climate change into reporting on Hurricane Florence, while its director of media analysis bemoaned what he described as the use of &quot;spin&quot; to politicize media coverage of natural disasters. In 2017, MRC sponsored a conference by the Heartland Institute, an organization known for its effort to cast doubt about the scientific consensus on climate change. In November 2021, a study by the Center for Countering Digital Hate described Media Research Center as being among &quot;ten fringe publishers&quot; that together were responsible for nearly 70 percent of Facebook user interactions with content that denied climate change. Facebook disputed the study&#x27;s methodology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porterfield_11/2/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Toxic_Ten_11/2/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, MRC said CNN was &quot;[Fidel] Castro&#x27;s megaphone&quot;. In 1999, the MRC said that network news programs on ABC, CBS, and NBC largely ignored Chinese espionage in the United States during the Clinton administration.

In MRC reports released from 1993 to 1995, it was claimed that such programs made more references to religion each later year, most of which became more favorable. In 2003, the MRC urged advertisers to pull sponsorship from &quot;The Reagans&quot;, a miniseries about President Ronald Reagan to be shown on CBS. The network later moved the program to its co-owned premium cable network Showtime.

The MRC has been a critic of the video game industry, arguing that there is a link between violent videogames and real-world violence; in this capacity, they (along with the Parents Television Council, a subsidiary) were invited to President Donald Trump&#x27;s 2018 summit on video games and gun violence.

MRC released a report in 2007 claiming that the network morning shows devoted more airtime to covering Democratic presidential candidates than Republican ones for the 2008 election. Producers for such shows criticized the MRC&#x27;s methodology as flawed. During the 2008 US presidential election, MRC claimed that the vast majority of news stories about Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama had a positive slant. MRC president Bozell praised MSNBC for having David Gregory replace Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann as political coverage anchor beginning September 8, 2008, but MSNBC president Phil Griffin disputed the statements by Bozell and others who have accused the network of liberal bias.

ThoughtCo named MRC one of the top 15 conservatives to follow on Twitter.

Bozell was an outspoken critic of Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican primaries, describing him as &quot;the greatest charlatan of them all&quot;, &quot;a &quot;huckster&quot; and &quot;shameless self-promoter&quot;. He said, &quot;God help this country if this man were president.&quot; After Trump clinched the Republican nomination, Bozell attacked the media for their &quot;hatred&quot; of Trump. &quot;Politico&quot; noted, &quot;The paradox here is that Bozell was once more antagonistic toward the president than any journalist.&quot; Bozell singled out Jake Tapper for being &quot;one of the worst offenders&quot; in coverage of Trump. However, several senior MRC staff told &quot;Politico&quot; that they considered Tapper a model of fairness, although that viewpoint has since changed.

==Criticism==

&quot;Extra!&quot;, the magazine of the progressive media watch group FAIR, criticized the MRC in 1998 for selective use of evidence. MRC had said that there was more coverage of government death squads in right-wing El Salvador than in left-wing Nicaragua in the 1980s, when Amnesty International stated El Salvador was worse than Nicaragua when it came to extrajudicial killings. &quot;Extra!&quot; also likened a defunct MRC newsletter, &quot;TV etc.&quot;, which tracked the off-screen political comments of actors, to &quot;&quot;Red Channels&quot;, the McCarthy Era blacklisting journal.&quot;

Journalist Brian Montopoli of &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; in 2005 labeled MRC &quot;just one part of a wider movement by the far right to demonize corporate media&quot;, rather than &quot;make the media better.&quot;

On December 22, 2011, Media Research Center president Bozell appeared on Fox News and suggested U.S. president Barack Obama looks like a &quot;skinny ghetto crackhead&quot;.

The Media Research Center has also faced scrutiny over the group&#x27;s $350,000 purchase in 2012 of a Pennsylvania house that a top executive had been trying to sell for several years.

In 2013, Media Research Center president Bozell appeared on Fox News to defend a Fox interview in which Fox journalists conducted almost no research into the background of Reza Aslan to prepare for its interview with him, and its putative biases.

When the Media Research Center bestowed an award named for William F. Buckley to Sean Hannity, Bret Stephens, a neoconservative columnist for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; wrote an editorial in which he lamented, &quot;And so we reach the Idiot stage of the conservative cycle, in which a Buckley Award for Sean Hannity suggests nothing ironic, much less Orwellian, to those bestowing it, applauding it, or even shrugging it off. The award itself is trivial, but it&#x27;s a fresh reminder of who now holds the commanding heights of conservative life, and what it is that they think.&quot;

<text>The Gloster Gladiator is a British biplane fighter. It was used by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) (as the Sea Gladiator variant) and was exported to a number of other air forces during the late 1930s.

Developed privately as the Gloster SS.37, it was the RAF&#x27;s last biplane fighter aircraft, and was rendered obsolescent by newer monoplane designs even as it was being introduced. Though often pitted against more advanced fighters during the early days of the Second World War, it acquitted itself reasonably well in combat.

The Gladiator saw action in almost all theatres during the Second World War, with a large number of air forces, some of them on the Axis side. The RAF used it in France, Norway, Greece, the defence of Malta, the Middle East, and the brief Anglo-Iraqi War (during which the Royal Iraqi Air Force was similarly equipped). Other countries deploying the Gladiator included China against Japan, beginning in 1938; Finland (along with Swedish volunteers) against the Soviet Union in the Winter War and the Continuation War; Sweden as a neutral noncombatant (although Swedish volunteers fought for Finland against USSR); and Norway, Belgium, and Greece resisting Axis invasion of their respective lands.

South African pilot Marmaduke &quot;Pat&quot; Pattle was the top Gladiator ace with 15 victories with the type.

==Design and development==
===Origins===

During the 1920s, Britain&#x27;s air defences had been based around interceptor aircraft capable of flying only for short ranges and at speeds of , but by 1930, figures within the Air Ministry were keen to supersede these aircraft. In particular, some dissatisfaction had arisen with the level of reliability experienced with the &#x27;one pilot, two machine guns&#x27; design formula previously used; the guns were often prone to jams and being unreliable. The Air Ministry&#x27;s technical planning committee formulated Specification F.7/30, which sought a new aircraft capable of a maximum speed of at least , an armament of no fewer than four machine guns, and such handling that that same fighter could be used by both day and night squadrons. Gloster, being already engaged with development of the Gloster Gauntlet, did not initially respond to the specification, which later proved to be beneficial.

The specification had also encouraged the use of the new Rolls-Royce Goshawk evaporatively cooled inline engine; many of the submissions produced by various aviation companies in response accordingly featured the Goshawk engine. However, the Goshawk engine proved to be unreliable, mainly due to its overcomplex and underdeveloped cooling system, and unsuited to use on fighter aircraft and this outcome stalled development of the aircraft intended to use it. A further stumbling point for many of the submitted designs was the placement of the machine gun breeches within arm&#x27;s reach of the pilot. At the same time, the development of monoplane fighters such as the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire cast doubt over the future viability of the requirement altogether.

Gloster recognised that instead of developing an all-new design from scratch, the existing Gauntlet fighter could be used as a basis for a contender to meet Specification F.7/30. Development of what would become the Gladiator began as a private venture, internally designated as the SS.37, at Gloster, by a design team headed by H.P. Folland, who soon identified various changes to increase the aircraft&#x27;s suitability to conform with the demands of the specification. Making use of wing-design techniques developed by Hawker Aircraft, the new fighter adopted single-bay wings in place of the two-bay wings of the Gauntlet, and two pairs of interplane struts were also dispensed with as a drag-reduction measure. The Bristol Mercury M.E.30 radial engine, capable of generating , was selected to power the SS.37, which provided a performance boost over the preceding Gauntlet. Another design choice was the fitting of a cantilever main undercarriage, which incorporated Dowty internally sprung wheels, allowing for more simple rigid landing gear struts.

===Prototype===

In spring 1934, Gloster embarked on the construction of a single SS.37 prototype. On 12 September 1934, the SS.37 prototype conducted its maiden flight, piloted by Gloster chief test pilot Gerry Sayer. Initially powered by a Mercury IV engine, the prototype was quickly re-equipped with a more powerful Mercury VIS engine. During flight tests, the prototype attained a top speed of while carrying the required four machine guns (two synchronised Vickers guns in the fuselage and two Lewis guns under the lower wing). According to aviation author Francis K. Mason, the Air Ministry were sceptical about the aircraft achieving such performance from a radial engine design, so funded a protracted series of evaluation trials.

On 3 April 1935, the prototype was transferred to the RAF, receiving the designation &quot;K5200&quot;, and commenced operational evaluations of the type. Around the same time, Gloster proceeded to plan a further improved version, featuring an Mercury IX engine, a two-blade wooden fixed-pitch propeller, improved wheel discs, and a fully enclosed cockpit. &quot;K5200&quot; was later used to trial modifications for production aircraft, such as the addition of a sliding hood for the pilot.

In June 1935, production plans for the aircraft were proposed; two weeks later, a production specification, Specification F.14/35, had been rapidly drawn up, partially prompted by events in continental Europe, such as the invasion of Abyssinia by Fascist Italy and the rise of Adolf Hitler to power in Germany, in response to which the British government mandated an urgent expansion of the RAF to counter the emerging threats. This culminated in an initial order for 23 aircraft. On 1 July 1935, the aircraft formally received the name &quot;Gladiator&quot;.

===Production===
Manufacturing of the Gladiator was started at Gloster&#x27;s Hucclecote facility. Production of the initial batch was performed simultaneously, leading to many aircraft being completed around the same time. On 16 February 1937, &quot;K6129&quot;, the first production Gladiator, was formally accepted by the RAF; on 4 March 1937, &quot;K6151&quot;, the last aircraft of the initial batch, was delivered. In September 1935, a follow-up order of 180 aircraft was also received from the Air Ministry; this order had the proviso that all aircraft had to be delivered before the end of 1937.

The first version, the Gladiator Mk I, was delivered from July 1936, becoming operational in January 1937. When difficulties with Rolls-Royce Merlin combustion chamber threatened to postpone the readiness of the next-generation fighters, the Air Ministry hedged its bets by procuring three hundreds of Mk II Gladiators as a stopgap via Specification F.36/37 (the delivery of 252 planes took until April 1940). The main differences were a slightly more powerful Mercury VIIIAS engine with Hobson mixture control boxes and a partly automatic boost-control carburettor, driving a Fairey fixed-pitch three-blade metal propeller, instead of the two-blade wooden one of the Mark I. All MK II Gladiators also carried Browning 0.303-inch machine guns (licence-manufactured by the BSA company in Birmingham) in place of the Vickers-Lewis combination of the MK I. A modified Mk II, the Sea Gladiator, was developed for the Fleet Air Arm, with an arrestor hook, catapult attachment points, a strengthened airframe, and an underbelly fairing for a dinghy lifeboat, all for operations aboard aircraft carriers. Of the 98 aircraft built as, or converted to, Sea Gladiators, 54 were still in service by the outbreak of the Second World War.

The Gladiator was the last British biplane fighter to be manufactured, and the first to feature an enclosed cockpit. It possessed a top speed of about , yet even as the Gladiator was introduced, it was already being eclipsed by new-generation monoplane fighters, such as the RAF Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire, and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Messerschmitt Bf 109. In total, 747 aircraft were built (483 RAF, 98 RN), with 216 being exported to 13 countries, some of which were from the total allotted to the RAF. Gladiators were sold to Belgium, China, Egypt, Finland, Free France, Greece, Iraq, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, and Sweden.

==Operational history==
===Introduction to service===

In February 1937, No. 72 Squadron, based at Tangmere, became the first squadron to be equipped with the Gladiator; No. 72 operated the type until April 1939, longer than any other home-based frontline unit. Between March and April 1937, No. 3 Squadron at Kenley also received Gladiators from the remainder of the first production batch, replacing their obsolete Bristol Bulldogs. Initial service with the type proved the Vickers guns to be problematical; the Gladiator was quickly armed with .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns, which were substantially more popular, leading to the other guns often only being resorted to if deemed necessary. On 27 March 1937, No. 54 Squadron at Hornchurch became the first unit to receive Browning-armed Gladiators.

By September 1937, all eight Gladiator squadrons had achieved operational status and had formed the spearhead of London&#x27;s air defences. Difficulties with introducing the type had been experienced. Although the Gladiator was typically well-liked by pilots, the accident rate during operational training on the type was so high that a small replacement batch of 28 Gladiator Mk IIs was hurriedly produced. Most accidents were caused by pilots being caught out by the fighter&#x27;s increased wing loading, and many aviators had little experience in landing aircraft with such a wide flap area. The aircraft had a tendency to stall more abruptly, frequently dropping a wing while doing so. The Gladiator very easily entered a flat spin, and great skill was needed to recover.

The first use of RAF Gladiators on active service was during the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. From September to December 1938, 33 Squadron RAF flew Gladiator strafing missions in support of British Mandate security forces. These were often in mountainous areas, and the aircraft came under substantial rifle fire. Three aircraft were destroyed, and two pilots killed, in these operations.

During 1938, the RAF had begun to receive its first deliveries of the Hurricane and Spitfire monoplanes; an emphasis was soon placed on quickly re-equipping half of the Gladiator squadrons with either of these monoplane types. By the outbreak of the Second World War, the Gladiator had largely been replaced by the Hurricane and Spitfire in front-line RAF service in defending the UK itself against the Luftwaffe. The introduction of these aircraft had been eased by the presence of the Gladiator, squadrons that had operated Gladiators prior to converting to the monoplane types experienced a noticeably improved accident record than those who converted from older types such as the Gauntlet. Experiences such as operating the Gladiator&#x27;s landing flaps and familiarisation with its sliding hood have been attributed to having favourably impacted pilot conversion. Gladiators remained the primary RAF front line fighter in North Africa, the Middle East, and later Greece into 1941, when Hurricanes began to replace them. Gladiators saw considerable action during early stages of the war, including participating in the action in the French and Norwegian campaigns, the defence of Egypt, Malta, and Greece mainly against the Italians, and in various peripheral campaigns.

Although by 1941, all Gladiators had been withdrawn from front-line duties defending the British Isles, there remained an ongoing need to defend Britain&#x27;s colonies and trade routes throughout the British Empire, so the RAF redeployed many of its Gladiators to the Middle East to defend the theatre and the crucial Suez Canal. 

===China===

In October 1937, the Chinese Central Government ordered 36 Gladiator Is, which were delivered in two crated batches to Guangzhou via Hong Kong. The Chinese Gladiators used the American M1919 Browning machine gun to fire American .30-06 Springfield ammunition, the main ammunition of the new Chinese Nationalist Air Force. By February 1938, these aircraft had been assembled into two squadrons and the Chinese pilots familiarised themselves with them. The Gloster Gladiator had its combat début on 24 February 1938. That day, in the Nanking area, Chinese-American Capt John Wong Sun-Shui (nicknamed &#x27;Buffalo&#x27;) shot down a Mitsubishi A5M &quot;Claude&quot; naval fighter, the first victim of a Gladiator. Wong is believed to have shot down a second A5M as the wrecks of two Japanese fighters were found. During that clash, Chinese Gladiators lost two of their number.

Chinese Gladiators scored several more victories over Japanese aircraft from 1938 to 1940 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In China, Gladiators were used extensively before the start of 1940 by the 28th, 29th, and 32nd squadrons of the 3rd Group. Chinese aviators considered the Gladiator an excellent fighter in its class, but pilots soon found it increasingly difficult to hold their own against the modern A5M, and because of a lack of spare parts due to an arms embargo, the surviving Gladiators were mostly relegated to training. When newer Japanese aircraft such as the Mitsubishi A6M Zero entered the theatre, the Gladiators&#x27; days were numbered. &quot;Buffalo&quot; Wong, the first Gladiator flying ace and first American fighter ace of the war, was eventually shot down in combat with A6M Zeros on 14 March 1941 and died two days later from his injuries. Arthur Chin and he were among a group of 15 Chinese Americans who formed the original group of American volunteer combat aviators in China.

===The Finnish Winter War and Continuation War===
During the Winter War, the Finnish Air Force (FAF) obtained 30 Mk II fighters from the UK. Ten of the aircraft were donated, while the other 20 were bought by the FAF; all were delivered between 18 January and 16 February 1940, the first entering service on 2 February 1940. The Finnish Gladiators served until 1945, but they were outclassed by modern Soviet fighters during the Continuation War, and the aircraft was mostly used for reconnaissance from 1941. The Finnish Air Force obtained 45 aerial victories by 22 pilots with the aircraft during the Winter War and one victory during the Continuation War. Twelve Gladiators were lost in combat during the Winter War and three during the Continuation War. Two pilots became aces with this aircraft: Oiva Tuominen (6.5 victories with Gladiators) and Paavo Berg (five victories).
Besides the FAF Gladiators, the Swedish Voluntary Air Force, responsible for the air defence of northernmost Finland during the later part of the Winter War, was also equipped with Gladiator fighters, known as J8s (Mk Is) and J8As (Mk IIs). The Flying Regiment F 19 arrived in Finnish Lapland on 10 January 1940 and remained there until the end of hostilities. It fielded 12 Gladiator Mk II fighters, two of which were lost during the fighting and five Hawker Hart dive bombers, plus a Raab-Katzenstein RK-26 liaison aircraft and a Junkers F.13 transport aircraft. The aircraft belonged to and were crewed by the Swedish Air Force but flew with Finnish nationality markings. The Swedish Gladiators scored eight aerial victories and destroyed four aircraft on the ground. One concern was expressed when F 19&#x27;s executive officer Captain Björn Bjuggren wrote in his memoirs, that the tracer rounds of the Gladiator&#x27;s machine guns would not ignite the aviation spirit when penetrating the fuel tanks of Soviet bombers.

===The Phoney War===
At the beginning of the Second World War, during what was known as the &quot;Phoney War&quot;, Britain deployed the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) into France to fight alongside the French army. As part of this force, RAF units operating various aircraft were dispatched to contribute, including two Gladiator squadrons. Initial air operations on either side were limited by the winter weather; however, immediately following Germany&#x27;s commencement of the Manstein Plan and its invasion of the Low Countries on 10 May 1940, the BEF&#x27;s Gladiators participated in the Dyle Plan, an unsuccessful counterattack on German forces.

From 10 May 1940 to 17 May, the Gladiators were in continuous demand on the front line, quickly losing numerous aircraft and their crews in the rapid action. On 18 May 1940, a Luftwaffe bombing raid destroyed many of the BEF&#x27;s Gladiators and Hurricanes on the ground at Vitry-en-Artois, shortly after which the BEF&#x27;s withdrawal to Dunkirk for evacuation to mainland Britain began.

Gladiators typically flew patrol flights that led to occasional clashes with Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft. On 17 October 1940, British Gladiators scored their first success when No 607 Squadron &quot;B&quot; Flight shot down a Dornier Do 18 flying boat (&#x27;8L+DK&#x27; of 2.KuFlGr 606), on the North Sea. On 10 April 1941, 804 NAS took off from Hatston, in Orkney, to intercept a group of approaching German aircraft. Lt Cdr J. C. Cockburn was credited with one destroyed and Blue Section with a &quot;damaged&quot;.

===The Norwegian Campaign===

The Norwegian Campaign saw both Norwegian and British Gladiators battling the Luftwaffe, with the Norwegian Jagevingen fighting in the defence of Oslo on the first day of Operation Weserübung, the German invasion. Later, British Gladiators fought to provide fighter cover for the Allied reinforcements sent to the assistance of the Norwegian government.

====Norwegian action====
The Gladiator pilots of the Norwegian Jagevingen (fighter flight) were based at Fornebu Airport. On 9 April, the first day of the invasion of Norway, the seven serviceable aircraft managed to shoot down five German aircraft: two Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters, two He 111 bombers and one &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot;-laden Ju 52 transport. One Gladiator was shot down during the air battle by the future &quot;experte&quot; Helmut Lent, while two were strafed and destroyed while refuelling and rearming at Fornebu airport. The remaining four operational fighters were ordered to land wherever they could away from the base. The Gladiators landed on frozen lakes around Oslo and were abandoned by their pilots, then wrecked by souvenir-hunting civilians.

No Norwegian Army Air Service aircraft were able to evacuate westwards before the 10 June surrender of the mainland Norwegian forces. Only the aircraft of the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service (one M.F.11 and four He 115s) had the range to fly from their last bases in northern Norway to the UK. Two Army Air Service Fokker C.V.Ds and one Tiger Moth also managed to escape eastwards to Finland before the surrender. Three naval M.F.11s and one He 115 flew to Finland, landing on Lake Salmijärvi in Petsamo. All the former Norwegian aircraft were later flown by the Finns against the Soviet Union.

====British action====
Gladiators were used also by 263 Squadron during the remaining two months of the Norwegian campaign. Prior to the German invasion of Norway, Britain had prepared this squadron with low-temperature environmental training. 263 Squadron arrived on the carrier on 24 April and operated from an improvised landing strip built by Norwegian volunteers on the frozen lake Lesjaskogsvatnet in Oppland in central southern Norway. On 25 April, a pair of Gladiators destroyed a Heinkel He 115 aircraft; Luftwaffe bombers attacked the runway that day, wounding several pilots on the ground. By the end of the day, ten Gladiators had been destroyed for the loss of three German aircraft. After less than a week, all the squadron&#x27;s aircraft were unserviceable and the personnel were evacuated to Britain.

Having re-equipped in Britain, 263 Squadron resumed its Gladiator operations in Norway when it returned to the north of Norway on 21 May, flying from Bardufoss airfield near Narvik. At the Narvik front, 263 Squadron was reinforced by Hurricanes of 46 Squadron, which flew to an airstrip in Skånland Municipality a few days later and several German aircraft were shot down. Due to unsuitable ground at Skånland, 46 Squadron moved to Bardufoss and was operating from this base by 27 May. The squadrons had been ordered to defend the fleet anchorage at Skånland and the Norwegian naval base at Harstad on the island of Hinnøya, as well as the Narvik area after it was recaptured. In the last days of May ground attack missions were also flown by the Gladiators against railway stations, German vehicles and coastal vessels.

On 2 June, one Gladiator pilot, Louis Jacobsen, was credited with the destruction of three Heinkel He 111s, along with the probable destruction of a Junkers Ju 88 and another He 111 aircraft, during one sortie. British action in the theatre was short but intense before the squadrons, due to the British government&#x27;s response to the invasion of France, were instructed on 2 June to undertake Operation Alphabet the evacuation from Norway.

By then, 263 Squadron had flown 249 sorties and claimed 26 enemy aircraft destroyed. The ten surviving Gladiators landed on &quot;Glorious&quot; on 7 June. &quot;Glorious&quot; sailed for home but was intercepted by the German battleships &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;. Despite the valiant defence put up by the destroyers, and , she was sunk along with the aircraft from four squadrons; 263 Squadron lost its CO, S/Ldr John W. Donaldson, and F/Lt Alvin Williams along with eight other pilots.

===Belgium===
Belgian Gladiators suffered heavy losses to the Germans in 1940, with all 15 operational aircraft lost, while only managing to damage two German aircraft. During the preceding Phoney War, on 24 April 1940 Belgian Gladiators on neutrality patrol shot down a German Heinkel He 111 bomber which subsequently crashed in the Netherlands. The bomber, V4+DA of Kampfgeschwader 1, had been damaged by French fighters at Maubeuge, France, and chased across the Belgian border.

===Battle of Britain===
The Gloster Gladiator was in operational service with 247 Squadron, stationed at RAF Roborough, Devon during the Battle of Britain. Although no combat sorties took place at the height of the aerial battles, 247 Squadron Gladiators intercepted a Heinkel He 111 in late October 1940, without result. 239 Squadron, using Gladiators for army cooperation and 804 Naval Air Squadron, outfitted with Sea Gladiators, were also operational during the Battle of Britain.

===Mediterranean and Middle East theatres===
In the Mediterranean Theatre during 1940–41, Gladiators saw combat with four Allied air forces: the RAF, Royal Australian Air Force, South African Air Force and &quot;Ellinikí Vasilikí Aeroporía&quot; (Royal Hellenic Air Force) squadrons. These achieved some success against the Italian &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;, which was mainly equipped with Fiat CR.32 and Fiat CR.42 biplanes, and against &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombers. The South African ace Marmaduke &quot;Pat&quot; Pattle (who served with the RAF), claimed 15 kills in Gladiators during the North African and Greek Campaigns, making him the highest-scoring RAF biplane ace of the war.

The 1941 Anglo-Iraqi War was unique in that the RAF and Royal Iraqi Air Force, used the Gladiator as their main fighter. Gladiators also saw action against the Vichy French in Syria.

====Malta====

A stock of 18 Sea Gladiators from 802 Naval Air Squadron had been delivered by HMS &quot;Glorious&quot;, in early 1940. Three were later shipped out to take part in the Norwegian Campaign and another three were sent to Egypt. By April, Malta was in need of fighter protection and it was decided to form a flight of Gladiators at RAF Hal Far, to be composed of RAF and FAA personnel. Several Sea Gladiators were assembled and test-flown. In the siege of Malta in 1940, for ten days the fighter force defending Malta was the Hal Far Fighter Flight, giving rise to a myth that three aircraft, named &quot;Faith&quot;, &quot;Hope&quot; and &quot;Charity&quot;, formed the entire fighter cover of the island. The aircraft names came into use after the battle. More than three aircraft were operational, though not always at the same time; others were used for spare parts. No 1435 Flight, which later assumed control of Malta&#x27;s air defence, took on the names &quot;Faith&quot;, &quot;Hope&quot; and &quot;Charity&quot; for its aircraft upon its reformation as the air defence unit in the Falkland Islands in 1988.

The Italian air force units deployed against Malta should have easily defeated the Gladiators but its manoeuvrability and good tactics won several engagements, often starting with a dive on Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 &quot;Sparviero&quot; bombers before the Fiat CR.42 and Macchi MC.200 escort fighters could react. On 11 June 1940, a Gladiator damaged a Macchi and on 23 June, a Gladiator flown by George Burges, managed to shoot down an MC.200. Another successful pilot over Malta was &quot;Timber&quot; Woods who managed to shoot down two S.79s and two CR.42s, also claiming a Macchi hit on 11 June and another S.79 damaged. The Gladiators forced Italian fighters to escort bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. Although the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; had started with a numerical advantage and air superiority, during the summer of 1940 the situation was reversed, with Hurricanes being delivered as fast as possible and gradually taking over the island&#x27;s air defence.

By June, two of the Gladiators had crashed and two more were assembled. &quot;Charity&quot; was shot down on 31 July 1940. Its pilot, Flying Officer Peter Hartley, scrambled at 09.45 with fellow pilots F. F. Taylor and Flight Lieutenant &quot;Timber&quot; Woods, to intercept an SM.79, escorted by nine CR.42s from 23° Gruppo. During a dogfight a CR.42 flown by Serg. Manlio Tarantino shot down Hartley&#x27;s Gladiator (N5519), badly burning him. Woods shot down Antonio Chiodi, commander of the 75a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; five miles east of Grand Harbour. Chiodi was subsequently awarded a posthumous &quot;Medaglia d’Oro al Valor Militare&quot;, Italy&#x27;s highest military award. In May 2009, the remains of &quot;Charity&quot; and others were the subject of an underwater search by NATO minesweepers. &quot;Hope&quot; (N5531) was destroyed on the ground by enemy bombing in May 1941. The fuselage of &quot;Faith&quot; is on display at the National War Museum, Fort St Elmo, Valletta today. The fate of at least five more Gladiators that saw action over Malta is not as well documented.

====North Africa====

In North Africa, Gladiators faced Italian Fiat CR.42 &quot;Falcos&quot; biplanes, which had a slightly superior performance to that of the Gladiator at higher altitudes.

The first aerial combat between the biplanes took place on 14 June over Amseat. &quot;Tenente&quot; Franco Lucchini, of 90a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;, 10° &quot;Gruppo&quot;, 4° &quot;Stormo&quot;, flying a CR.42 from Tobruk, shot down a Gladiator; it was the first claim made against the RAF in the desert war. On the afternoon of 24 July, CR.42s and Gladiators clashed over Bardia. A formation of 11 CR.42s from 10° &quot;Gruppo&quot;, backed by six more from the 13° &quot;Gruppo&quot; attacked a British formation of nine Blenheims that was attacking Bardia, and was in turn reportedly attacked by 15 Gladiators. The five Gladiators of 33 Squadron claimed four CR.42s destroyed.

On 4 August 1940, Fiat biplanes from 160a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; of &quot;Capitano&quot; Duilio Fanali intercepted four Gladiators commanded by Marmaduke &quot;Pat&quot; Pattle (eventually to become one of the top-scoring Allied aces with approximately 50 claims) that were attacking Breda Ba.65s while they were strafing British armoured vehicles. The battle became confused. Initially it was thought that only the old CR.32s were involved, but there were also many CR.42s; it is likely that the then inexperienced Pattle was shot down by another future ace, Franco Lucchini. On this occasion, the Fiats managed to surprise the Gladiators, shooting down three of them. Wykeham Barnes, who was shot down but survived, claimed a Breda 65, while Pattle claimed a Ba 65 and a CR.42.
On 8 August 1940, during another dogfight, 14 Gladiators of 80 Squadron took 16 Fiat CR.42s from 9° and 10° &quot;Gruppi&quot; of 4° &quot;Stormo&quot; (a &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; elite unit) by surprise over Gabr Saleh, well inside Italian territory. British pilots claimed 13 to 16 confirmed victories and one to seven probables, while losing two Gladiators.
Actually the Italians lost four aircraft, and four more force-landed (it seems that all were later recovered).
That battle highlighted the strong points of the Gladiator over the CR.42, especially the radio equipment, which had permitted a coordinated attack, being also crucial for obtaining the initial surprise, and the Gladiator&#x27;s superior low-altitude overall performance, including speed and a markedly superior horizontal manoeuvrability over its Italian opponent.

Overall, the few Gladiators and CR.42s clashed with a substantial parity: considering all theatres, the kill ratio was 1.2-to-1 in favour of the former, a ratio similar to that of the Bf 109 and the Spitfire in the Battle of Britain, a duel considered evenly balanced by most historians. However, the Gladiator, optimised for dogfighting, met with only little success against the relatively fast Italian bombers, shooting down only a handful of them and suffering almost as many losses in the process, which could be one of the reasons for its quick retirement from first-line duty; the CR.42 on the other hand was successful against early British bombers, shooting down a hundred of them with minimal losses.

====Eastern Africa====
In Eastern Africa, it was determined that Italian forces based on Ethiopia posed a threat to the British Aden Protectorate, thus it was decided that an offensive would be necessary, in which the Gladiator would face off against the Italian biplane fighters: Fiat CR.32s and CR.42s. On 6 November 1940, in the first hour of the British offensive against Ethiopia, the Fiat CR.42 fighters of the 412a Squadriglia led by Capt. Antonio Raffi shot down five Gloster Gladiators of 1 SAAF Sqn; among the Italian pilots was the ace Mario Visintini, who later became the top scoring pilot of all belligerent air forces in Eastern Africa (Africa Orientale) and the top biplane fighter ace of World War II. Tactically, the SAAF aircraft erred by engaging the CR.42&#x27;s in a piecemeal fashion and not en masse, and they were heavily outnumbered.

Early on in the offensive, Gladiators of No. 94 Squadron performed various attacks on the Italian forces; typical targets included airfields, supply depots, and aircraft. They were also assigned the mission of defending Aden airspace at day and night, and to protect Allied shipping operating in the vicinity. It was in the latter role that a single 94 Squadron Gladiator, piloted by Gordon Haywood, was responsible for the surrender and capture of the Italian Archimede-class submarine Galilei Galileo.

On 6 June 1941, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; had only two serviceable aircraft remaining: a CR.32 and a CR.42, therefore air superiority was finally achieved by Gladiators and the Hurricanes. The Gladiator&#x27;s last air combat with an Italian fighter was on 24 October 1941, with the CR.42 of Tenente Malavolti (or, according to historian Håkan Gustavsson, &quot;sottotenente Malavolta&quot;). The Italian pilot took off to strafe British airfields at Dabat and Adi Arcai. According to the Italian historian Nico Sgarlato, the CR.42 was intercepted by three Gladiators and managed to shoot down two of them, but was then itself shot down and the pilot killed. Other authors state that Malavolti managed only to fire on the two Gladiators before being shot down.

According to Gustavsson, SAAF pilot (no. 47484V) Lieutenant Lancelot Charles Henry &quot;Paddy&quot; Hope, at Dabat airfield, scrambled to intercept the CR.42 (MM7117). Diving on it, he opened fire at 300 yards. Although the CR.42 pilot took violent evasive action, Hope pursued, closing to 20 yards and firing as it tried to dive away. There was a brief flicker of flame and the last Italian aircraft to be shot down over East Africa spun into the ground and burst into flames near Ambazzo. The next day the wreckage was found, the dead pilot still in the cockpit. Hope dropped a message on Italian positions at Ambazzo: &quot;Tribute to the pilot of the Fiat. He was a brave man. South African Air Force.&quot; But operational record books of the Commonwealth units in the area state that they did not suffer any losses on this date. The dedication of the posthumous &quot;Medaglia d’oro al valor militare&quot; states that Malavolti shot down a Gladiator and forced another to crash land, but was himself shot down by a third Gladiator. This was the last air-to-air victory in the East African campaign.

Towards the end of the war Gladiators were flown by Meteorological Flight 1566 out of Hiswa, Aden.

====Greece====
Tension had been building between Greece and Italy since 7 April 1939, when Italian troops occupied Albania. On 28 October 1940, Italy issued an ultimatum to Greece, which was promptly rejected; a few hours later, Italian troops launched an invasion of Greece, initiating the Greco-Italian War.

Britain dispatched help to the embattled Greeks in the form of 80 Squadron, elements of which arrived at Trikkala by 19 November. That same day, the Gladiator debut came in the form of a surprise, intercepting a section of five Italian CR.42s on Coritza, only one of which returned to base. On 27 November, seven Gladiators attacked three Falcos, shooting down the lead aircraft, piloted by Com. Masfaldi, commanding the 364a Squadriglia. On 28 November, the commander of 365a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;, Com. Graffer, was shot down during a combat where seven aircraft were downed, four of them British. On 3 December, the Gladiators were reinforced with elements from 112 Squadron. The following day, a clash between 20 Gladiators and ten CR.42s resulted in a loss of five, two of them Italians. After a break of two weeks, 80 Sqn returned to operations on 19 December 1940. On 21 December, 20 Gladiators intercepted a force of 15 CR.42 Falcos, shooting down two with two losses. Over the next few days, several groups of Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 and Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 bombers were also intercepted and victories claimed.

One of the more notable Gladiator engagements of the whole war occurred on the Albanian border with Greece on 28 February 1941. A mixed force of 28 Gladiators and Hurricanes encountered roughly 50 Italian aircraft, and claimed to have shot down or severely damaged at least 27 of them. A single Gladiator, piloted by ace pilot Marmaduke &quot;Pat&quot; Pattle, claimed five aircraft during that single skirmish. Actually the British heavily overclaimed as it seems that &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; that day lost only two CR.42s.

The complete 112 Squadron moved to Eleusis by the end of January 1941, and by the end of the following month, had received 80 Sqn&#x27;s Gladiators, after the latter unit had converted to Hawker Hurricanes. On 5 April, German forces invaded Greece and quickly established air superiority. As the Allied troops retreated, Gladiators covered them, before flying to Crete during the last week of April. There No 112 Sqn recorded a few claims over twin-engined aircraft before being evacuated to Egypt during the Battle of Crete.

====Anglo-Iraqi War====
The Royal Iraqi Air Force (RoIAF) had been trained and equipped by the British prior to independence in 1932. One result of this was the dominance of British-built aircraft in the RoIAF inventory. In 1941, the sole RoIAF single-purpose fighter squadron, 4th Squadron consisted of seven operational Gloster Gladiators at Rashid Air Base.

On 2 May 1941, in response to a blockade established by increasing numbers of Iraqi forces on RAF Habbaniya and demands from the revolutionary Iraqi government, a preemptive RAF attack was launched to break the encirclement. During this action, Iraqi Gladiators took part in attacks on the British air base, repeatedly strafing it ineffectively. Although much of the RoIAF was destroyed in the air or on the ground in the following days, the Iraqi Gladiators kept flying until the end of the war, carrying out strafing attacks on A Company of 1 Battalion, The Essex Regiment on the outskirts of Baghdad on 30 May.

Before the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq, the 4th Service Training School at RAF Habbaniya operated three old Gladiators as officers&#x27; runabouts. With the increased tension, the base was reinforced with another six Gladiators on 19 April, flying in from Egypt. During the early part of the war, these nine Gladiators flew numerous sorties against air and ground targets, taking off from the base&#x27;s polo field. The RAF&#x27;s Gladiator force in Iraq was further reinforced when, on 11 May, another five aircraft arrived, this time from 94 Squadron in Ismaïlia on the Suez Canal. A last resupply of Gladiators came on 17 May in the form of four more 94 Squadron aircraft.

During the fighting, the sole Gladiator-on-Gladiator kill occurred on 5 May, when Plt. Off. Watson of the fighter flight shot down an Iraqi Gladiator over Baqubah during a bomber escort mission. The Iraqi Gladiators&#x27; only claim during the war was a Vickers Wellington bomber shared with ground fire on 4 May. RAF Gladiators proved effective against the Iraqi aircraft, which had been reinforced by Axis aircraft. Immediately after launching his coup against King Faisal II in early April 1941, Prime Minister Rashid Ali al-Gaylani approached Germany and Italy for help in repelling any British countermeasures. In response, the Germans assembled a Luftwaffe task force under Iraqi colours called &quot;Fliegerführer Irak&quot; (&quot;Flyer Command Iraq&quot;) which from 14 May operated out of Mosul. Before this force collapsed due to lack of supplies, replacements, and quality fuel in addition to aggressive RAF attacks, two Gladiators fought a pair of Bf. 110s over Rashid Airfield at Baghdad on 17 May. Both German machines were swiftly shot down.

The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; had also dispatched a force of 12 Fiat CR.42s that arrived in Iraq on 23 May. Six days later, the Fiat CR.42s intercepted an RAF Hawker Audax and clashed with escorting Gladiators in what was to prove the final air-to-air combat of the brief campaign. Italian pilots claimed two No. 94 Sqn Gladiators; one Fiat was shot down by a Gladiator flown by Wg. Cdr. Wightman, close to Khan Nuqta. Following the end of hostilities in Iraq, No 94 Squadron handed its Gladiators over to SAAF and RAAF units. The Iraqis continued to operate their remaining Gladiators, some remaining in use as late as 1949; these were reportedly used to conduct ground-attack missions against the Kurds.

====Syria====
After the end of the Iraq fighting the British invaded Vichy French-controlled Syria to prevent the area from falling under direct German control. The French in Syria had supported the Iraqi rebellion materially and allowed &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft to use their airfields for operations over Iraq. The month-long Syria-Lebanon Campaign in June–July 1941 saw heavy fighting both in the air and on land, until the Vichy French authorities in Syria surrendered on 12 July 1941. In one encounter between the Royal Air Force and the Vichy French Air Force on 15 June 1941, six Gloster Gladiators were jumped by an equal number of Dewoitine D.520 monoplane fighter aircraft. In a confused battle, both sides lost one aircraft shot down and one severely damaged. French fighter ace Pierre Le Gloan shot down the Gladiator for his 15th confirmed kill. Le Gloan himself had to crash-land his damaged D.520 at his own air base.

As late as mid-1941, the RAF Chief-of-Air Staff offered 21 Gloster Gladiators gathered from various meteorological and communications flights in the Middle East, as well as five from a Free French unit, to AOC Singapore in order to strengthen the colony&#x27;s defences against the emerging Japanese threat. The offer was turned down and later reinforcements consisted of Hawker Hurricanes.

===Operations elsewhere===
The Irish Air Corps was supplied with four Gladiators on 9 March 1939. On 29 December 1940, two Irish Gladiators were scrambled from Baldonnel to intercept a German Ju 88 flying over Dublin on a photographic reconnaissance mission, but were unable to make contact. Although unable to intercept any intruding aircraft, the Irish Gladiators shot down several British barrage balloons that had broken from their moorings. For a short time in 1940, an order was given to Irish fighter pilots to use their aircraft to block the runways of airfields. They were then to use rifles and shoot at any invaders. Irish Gladiators also overflew the site of the sinking of the liner SS &quot;Athenia&quot; in 1939 and offered the help of the Irish military. The flight was fired upon by Royal Navy ships in attendance, consequently, the Irish Gladiators withdrew.

The Luftwaffe used captured Latvian Gladiators as glider tugs with &quot;Ergänzungsgruppe&quot; (S) 1 from Langendiebach near Hanau during 1942–3.

After becoming obsolete, RAF Gladiators carried out non-combat tasks such as meteorological work, being operated as such across various parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Europe as late as 1944. By the end of the war, few intact aircraft remained and many of these were quickly scrapped. Two survivors were privately purchased by V.H. Bellamy, who completed a flightworthy Gladiator out of parts from &quot;L8032&quot; and &quot;N5903&quot;, which became the sole example of the type in such a condition.

===Final engagements===
The Finnish Air Force was the last to use the Gloster biplane in combat. It was under Finnish insignia that the Gladiator achieved its last air victory. During the Continuation War, against the Soviets, Glosters supported the advance of the Karelian Army around Lake Ladoga. On 15 February 1943, 1st Lt Håkan Strömberg of &quot;LLv 16&quot;, during a reconnaissance mission along the Murmansk railway, between the White Sea and the Lake Onega, spotted, on Karkijarvi, a Soviet Polikarpov R-5 taking off. Stromberg dived on it and shot it down into the forest near its airfield with two bursts. This was the last confirmed victory in the Gladiator.

==Quotations==
==Gladiator aces==
The top scoring Gladiator aces flew it in North Africa and Greece, scoring most of their successes against &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; aircraft. The top ace was Flight Lieutenant Pat Pattle, from No. 80 Squadron, who won 15.5 confirmed air victories while flying the Gladiator (out of his 50+ kills), plus four probably destroyed and six damaged. Second was Pilot Officer William &quot;Cherry&quot; Vale, from No. 33 and 80 Squadrons, with ten individual kills, 1 shared kill, and 1.5 damaged. Flight Lieutenant Joe P. Fraser, from No. 112 Squadron, and Flight Sergeant Don S. Gregory, from Nos. 33 and 80 Squadrons, scored all of their kills (respectively, 9.5 and 8) flying the Gladiator. Sergeant C. E. &quot;Cas&quot; Casbolt, from No. 80 Squadron, shot down 7.5 enemy aircraft (plus one probably destroyed and 1.5 damaged). Rhodesian pilot Caesar Hull scored five of his eight victories in a Gladiator during the Norwegian Campaign in 1940, including four in the same afternoon. He was the leading Allied pilot of the campaign.

Top Finnish Air Force Gladiator ace was Captain Paavo Berg, who claimed 6 of his 11 victories with Gladiators. Warrant Officer Oiva Tuominen claimed 5 of his 44 victories with Gladiators. Several other FiAF aces also claimed victories with Gladiators.

Three pilots flying for the wartime &quot;Nationalist Air Force of China&quot;, John Wong (Huang Xinrui), Arthur Chin and Zhu Jiaxun, all former pilots of Chinese provincial-warlord air forces, achieved ace statuses while fighting in Gladiators, with Zhu Jiaxun scoring a double-kill against the formidable Mitsubishi A5M over Nanxiong, Guangdong province on 30 August 1938.
