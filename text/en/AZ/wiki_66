<text>Citigroup Inc. or Citi (stylized as citi) is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company based in New York City. The company was formed in 1998 by the merger of Citicorp, the bank holding company for Citibank, and Travelers; Travelers was spun off from the company in 2002.

Citigroup is the third-largest banking institution in the United States by assets; alongside JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, it is one of the Big Four banking institutions of the United States. It is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board, and is commonly cited as being &quot;too big to fail&quot;. It is one of the eight global investment banks in the Bulge Bracket. Citigroup is ranked 36th on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500, and was ranked #24 in &quot;Forbes&quot; Global 2000 in 2023.

Citigroup operates with two major divisions: Institutional Clients Group (ICG), which offers investment banking and corporate banking services, as well as treasury and trade solutions (TTS) and securities services such as custodian banking; and Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM), which includes Citibank, a retail bank, the third largest issuer of credit cards, as well as its wealth management business. 

==History==
Citigroup was formed on October 8, 1998, following the merger of Citicorp, the bank holding company for Citibank, and Travelers to create the world&#x27;s largest financial services organization.

===Citicorp (1812–1985)===
Citibank, (formerly City Bank of New York) was chartered by the State of New York on June 16, 1812, with $2 million (~$ in ) of capital. Serving a group of New York merchants, the bank opened for business on September 14 of that year, and Samuel Osgood was elected as the first President of the company. After the Panic of 1837, Moses Taylor acquired control of the company. The company&#x27;s name was changed to The National City Bank of New York in 1865 after it converted its state charter into a federal charter and joined the new U.S. national banking system. After Taylor died in 1882, Percy Rivington Pyne I became president of the bank. He died nine years later and was replaced by James Stillman. The bank became the largest bank in New York City after the Panic of 1893 and the largest bank in the U.S. by 1895. It became the first contributor to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1913, and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a U.S. bank in Buenos Aires, although the bank had been active in plantation economies, such as the Cuban sugar industry, since the mid-19th century. The purchase of U.S. overseas bank International Banking Corporation in 1918 helped it become the first American bank to surpass $1 billion in assets. During the United States occupation of Haiti and the bank&#x27;s income from Haiti&#x27;s loan debt related to the Haiti indemnity controversy, the bank earned some of its largest gains in the 1920s due to debt payments from Haiti, becoming the largest commercial bank in the world in 1929. As it grew, the bank became an innovator in financial services, becoming the first major U.S. bank to offer compound interest on savings (1921); unsecured personal loans (1928); customer checking accounts (1936) and the negotiable certificate of deposit (1961).

The bank merged with First National Bank of New York in 1955, becoming the First National City Bank of New York in 1955. The &quot;New York&quot; was dropped in 1962 on the 150th anniversary of the company&#x27;s foundation. The company organically entered the leasing and credit card sectors, and its introduction of U.S. dollar-denominated certificates of deposit in London marked the first new negotiable instrument in the market since 1888. The bank introduced its First National City Charge Service credit card—popularly known as the &quot;Everything card&quot; and later to become MasterCard—in 1967. Also in 1967, First National City Bank was reorganized as a one-bank holding company, First National City Corporation, or &quot;Citicorp&quot; for short. The bank had been nicknamed &quot;Citibank&quot; since the 1860s when it began using this as an eight-letter wire code address.

In 1974, under the leadership of CEO Walter B. Wriston, First National City Corporation changed its formal name to &quot;Citicorp&quot;, with First National City Bank being formally renamed Citibank in 1976. Shortly afterwards, the bank launched the Citicard, which pioneered the use of 24-hour ATMs. John S. Reed was elected CEO in 1984, and Citi became a founding member of the CHAPS clearing house in London. Under his leadership, the next 14 years would see Citibank become the largest bank in the United States and the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world, and expand its global reach to over 90 countries.

===Travelers Group (1986–2007)===

Travelers Group, at the time of the merger, was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under CEO Sandy Weill. Its roots came from Commercial Credit, a subsidiary of Control Data Corporation that was taken private by Weill in November 1986 after taking charge of the company earlier that year. Two years later, Weill mastered the buyout of Primerica Financial Services—a conglomerate that had already bought life insurance company A L Williams as well as brokerage firm Smith Barney. The new company took the Primerica name, and employed a &quot;cross-selling&quot; strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each other&#x27;s services. Its non-financial businesses were spun off.

In September 1992, Travelers Insurance, which had suffered from poor real estate investments and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, formed a strategic alliance with Primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in December 1993. With the acquisition, the group became Travelers Inc. Property &amp; casualty and life &amp; annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business. Meanwhile, the distinctive Travelers red umbrella logo, which was also acquired in the deal, was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization. During this period, Travelers acquired Shearson Lehman—a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by Weill until 1985—and merged it with Smith Barney.

====Ownership of Salomon Brothers (1997–2003)====
In November 1997, Travelers Group (which had been renamed again in April 1995 when they merged with Aetna Property and Casualty, Inc.), acquired Salomon Brothers, a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank, in a $9 billion (~$ in ) transaction. This deal complemented Travelers/Smith Barney well as Salomon was focused on fixed-income and institutional clients, whereas Smith Barney was strong in equities and retail. Salomon Brothers absorbed Smith Barney into the new securities unit termed Salomon Smith Barney; a year later, the division incorporated Citicorp&#x27;s former securities operations as well. The Salomon Smith Barney name was abandoned in October 2003 after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the bank&#x27;s reputation.

===Merger of Citicorp and Travelers (1998–2001)===
On April 6, 1998, Citicorp and Travelers announced a merger. The deal would enable Travelers and Citicorp to access each other&#x27;s customer base for the marketing of financial products.

In the transaction, Travelers Group acquired all Citicorp shares; existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm. While the new company maintained Citicorp&#x27;s &quot;Citi&quot; brand in its name, it adopted Travelers&#x27; distinctive &quot;red umbrella&quot; as the new corporate logo, which was used until 2007.

The chairmen of both parent companies, John S. Reed and Sandy Weill respectively, were announced as co-chairmen and co-CEOs of the new company, Citigroup, Inc., although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup.

The remaining provisions of the Glass–Steagall Act—enacted following the Great Depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters, and meant Citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets. Weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed &quot;that over that time the legislation will change ... we have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem&quot;. Indeed, the passing of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in November 1999 vindicated Reed and Weill&#x27;s views, opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking, investment banking, insurance underwriting, and brokerage.

Joe J. Plumeri worked on the post-merger integration of the two companies and was appointed CEO of Citibank North America by Weill and Reed. He oversaw its network of 450 branches. J. Paul Newsome, an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer, said: &quot;He&#x27;s not the spit-and-polish executive many people expected. He&#x27;s rough on the edges. But Citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble—it can&#x27;t get away anymore with passive selling—and Plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank.&quot; Plumeri boosted the unit&#x27;s earnings from $108 million to $415 million in one year, an increase of nearly 300%. He unexpectedly retired from Citibank in January 2000.
In 2000, Citigroup acquired Associates First Capital Corporation for $31.1 billion in stock, which, until 1989, had been owned by Gulf+Western (now part of National Amusements), and later by Ford Motor Credit Company. The Associates was widely criticized for predatory lending practices and Citi eventually settled with the Federal Trade Commission by agreeing to pay $240 million to customers who had been victims of a variety of predatory practices, including &quot;flipping&quot; mortgages, &quot;packing&quot; mortgages with optional credit insurance, and deceptive marketing practices.

In 2001, Citigroup made additional acquisitions: European American Bank, in July, for $1.9 billion, and Banamex in August, for $12.5 billion.

===Spin-off of Travelers (2002)===

The company spun off its Travelers Property and Casualty insurance underwriting business in 2002. The spin-off was prompted by the insurance unit&#x27;s drag on Citigroup stock price because Travelers earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters and events such as the September 11 attacks. It was also difficult to sell insurance directly to its customers since most customers were accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker.

Travelers merged with The St. Paul Companies Inc. in 2004 forming The St. Paul Travelers Companies. Citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting businesses until it sold them to MetLife in 2005.

In spite of divesting Travelers Insurance, Citigroup retained Travelers&#x27; signature red umbrella logo as its own until February 2007, when Citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to St. Paul Travelers, which renamed itself Travelers Companies. Citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand &quot;Citi&quot; for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries, except Primerica and Banamex.

===Subprime mortgage crisis (2007)===
Heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of collateralized debt obligation (CDOs), compounded by poor risk management, led Citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened in 2007. The company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas, but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages. Trading head Thomas Maheras was close friends with senior risk officer David Bushnell, which undermined risk oversight. As Treasury Secretary, Robert Rubin was said to be influential in lifting the Glass–Steagall Act that allowed Travelers and Citicorp to merge in 1998. Then on the board of directors of Citigroup, Rubin and Charles Prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards MBS and CDOs in the subprime mortgage market.

Starting in June 2006, Senior Vice President Richard M. Bowen III, the chief underwriter of Citigroup&#x27;s Consumer Lending Group, began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses. The group bought and sold $90 billion of residential mortgages annually. Bowen&#x27;s responsibility was essential to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the unit&#x27;s creditworthiness. When Bowen first became a whistleblower in 2006, 60% of the mortgages were defective. The number of bad mortgages began increasing throughout 2007 and eventually exceeded 80% of the volume. Many of the mortgages were not only defective but were a result of mortgage fraud. Bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications. On November 3, 2007, Bowen emailed Citigroup chairman Robert Rubin and the bank&#x27;s chief financial officer, head auditor, and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses, claiming that the group&#x27;s internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit. The subsequent investigation revealed that the Consumer Lending Group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since 2005. Despite the findings of the investigation, Bowen&#x27;s charges were ignored, even though withholding such information from shareholders violated the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX), which he had pointed out. Citigroup CEO Charles Prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with SOX despite Bowen revealing this wasn&#x27;t so. Citigroup eventually stripped Bowen of most of his responsibilities and informed him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission asked him to testify about Citigroup&#x27;s role in the mortgage crisis, and he did so, appearing as one of the first witnesses before the Commission in April 2010.

As the crisis began to unfold, Citigroup announced on April 11, 2007, that it would eliminate 17,000 jobs, or about 5% of its workforce, in a broad restructuring designed to cut costs and bolster its long underperforming stock. Even after securities and brokerage firm Bear Stearns ran into serious trouble in summer 2007, Citigroup decided the possibility of trouble with its CDOs was so tiny (less than 1/100 of 1%) that they excluded them from their risk analysis. With the crisis worsening, Citigroup announced on January 7, 2008, that it was considering cutting another 5 percent to 10 percent of its 327,000 member-workforce.

=== Failed takeover of Nikko Asset Management ===
In 2007, Citigroup acquired 61% of Nikko Asset Management for $7.7 billion to take majority control in what was then the largest foreign buyout ever of a Japanese company. Citigroup attempted to buy out the remaining shares of Nikko later that year at a cost of $4.6 billion to take full control of the company. Two years later, Citigroup sold its stake to Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co, a subsidiary of Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, for $795 million as it retreated from Japan.

===Collapse and US government intervention (2008)===
By July 2008 Citigroup was described as struggling, and by November they were insolvent, despite their receipt of $25 billion (~$ in ) in taxpayer-funded federal Troubled Asset Relief Program funds. On November 17, 2008, Citigroup announced plans for about 52,000 new job cuts, on top of 23,000 cuts already made during 2008 in a huge job cull resulting from four-quarters of consecutive losses and reports that it was unlikely to be in profit again before 2010. The same day on Wall Street markets responded, with shares falling and dropping the company&#x27;s market capitalization to $6 billion, down from $300 billion two years prior. Eventually staff cuts totaled over 100,000 employees. Its stock market value dropped to $20.5 billion, down from $244 billion two years earlier. Shares of Citigroup common stock traded well below $1.00 on the New York Stock Exchange.

As a result, late in the evening on November 23, 2008, Citigroup and Federal regulators approved a plan to stabilize the company and forestall a further deterioration in the company&#x27;s value. On November 24, 2008, the U.S. government announced a massive bailout for Citigroup designed to rescue the company from bankruptcy while giving the government a major say in its operations. A joint statement by the US Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced: &quot;With these transactions, the U.S. government is taking the actions necessary to strengthen the financial system and protect U.S. taxpayers and the U.S. economy.&quot;

====TARP funding====
Citi received the largest amount of TARP funding, &quot;a larger bailout than any other U.S. bank.&quot; The bailout called for the government to back about $306 billion in loans and securities and directly invest about $20 billion in the company. The Treasury provided $20 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds in addition to $25 billion given in October. The Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC agreed to cover 90% of the losses on Citigroup&#x27;s $335 billion portfolio after Citigroup absorbed the first $29 billion in losses. The Treasury would assume the first $5 billion in losses; the FDIC would absorb the next $10 billion; then the Federal Reserve would assume the rest of the risk. The assets remained on Citigroup&#x27;s balance sheet; the technical term for this arrangement is ring fencing.

In return, the bank gave the U.S. Treasury $27 billion of preferred shares and warrants to acquire common stock. The government obtained wide powers over banking operations. Citigroup agreed to try to modify mortgages, using standards set up by the FDIC after the collapse of IndyMac Bank, with the goal of keeping as many homeowners as possible in their houses. Executive salaries would be capped. As a condition of the federal assistance, Citigroup&#x27;s dividend payment was reduced to $0.01 per share.

In a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed, Michael Lewis and David Einhorn described the November 2008 $306 billion (~$ in ) guarantee as &quot;an undisguised gift&quot; without any real crisis motivating it.

According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the government aid provided to Citi in 2008/2009 was provided to prevent a worldwide chaos and panic by the potential collapse of its Global Transactions Services (now TTS) division. According to the article, former CEO Pandit said if Citigroup was allowed to unravel into bankruptcy, &quot;100 governments around the world would be trying to figure out how to pay their employees&quot;.

According to New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, Citigroup paid hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses to more than 1,038 of its employees after it had received its $45 billion (~$ in ) TARP funds in late 2008. This included 738 employees each receiving $1 million in bonuses, 176 employees each receiving $2 million bonuses, 124 each receiving $3 million in bonuses, and 143 each receiving bonuses of $4 million to more than $10 million. As a result of the criticism and the U.S. Government&#x27;s majority holding of Citigroup&#x27;s common stock, compensation and bonuses were restricted from February 2009 until December 2010.

In 2009, Jane Fraser, the CEO of Citi Private Bank, stopped paying its bankers with a commission for selling investment products, in a move to bolster Citi Private Bank&#x27;s reputation as an independent wealth management adviser, as opposed to a product pusher.

===Creation of Citi Holdings (2009)===
On January 16, 2009, Citigroup announced its intention to reorganize itself into two operating units: Citicorp for its retail and institutional client business, and Citi Holdings for its brokerage and asset management. Citigroup will continue to operate as a single company for the time being, but Citi Holdings managers will be tasked to &quot;take advantage of value-enhancing disposition and combination opportunities as they emerge&quot;, and eventual spin-offs or mergers involving either operating unit were not ruled out. Citi Holdings consists of Citi businesses that Citi wants to sell and are not considered part of Citi&#x27;s core businesses. The majority of its assets are U.S. mortgages. It was created in the wake of the financial crisis as part of Citi&#x27;s restructuring plan. It consists of several business entities including remaining interests in local consumer lending such as OneMain Financial, divestitures such as Smith Barney, and a special asset pool. Citi Holdings represents $156 billion of GAAP assets, or ~8% of Citigroup; 59% represents North American mortgages, 18% operating businesses, 13% special asset pool, and 10% categorized as other. Operating businesses include OneMain Financial ($10B), PrimeRe ($7B), MSSB JV ($8B) and Spain / Greece retail ($4B), less associated loan loss reserves. While Citi Holdings is a mixed bag, its primary objective is to wind down some non-core businesses and reduce assets, and strategically &quot;breaking even&quot; in 2015.

On February 27, 2009, Citigroup announced that the U.S. government would take a 36% equity stake in the company by converting US$25 billion in emergency aid into common stock with a United States Treasury credit line of $45 billion to prevent the bankruptcy of the company. The government guaranteed losses on more than $300 billion of troubled assets and injected $20 billion immediately into the company. The salary of the CEO was set at $1 per year and the highest salary of employees was restricted to $500,000. Any compensation amount above $500,000 had to be paid with restricted stock that could not be sold by the employee until the emergency government aid was repaid in full. The U.S. government also gained control of half the seats in the board of directors, and the senior management was subjected to removal by the US government if there were poor performance. By December 2009, the U.S. government stake was reduced from a 36% stake to a 27% stake, after Citigroup sold $21 billion of common shares and equity in the largest single share sale in U.S. history, surpassing Bank of America&#x27;s $19 billion share sale 1 month prior. By December 2010, Citigroup repaid the emergency aid in full and the U.S. government had made a $12 billion (~$ in ) profit on its investment in the company. Government restrictions on pay and oversight of the senior management were removed after the U.S. government sold its remaining 27% stake in December 2010.

On June 1, 2009, it was announced that Citigroup would be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average effective June 8, 2009, due to significant government ownership. Citigroup was replaced by Travelers Co.

====Sale of Smith Barney (2009)====
Smith Barney, Citi&#x27;s global private wealth management unit, provided brokerage, investment banking and asset management services to corporations, governments and individuals around the world. With over 800 offices worldwide, Smith Barney held 9.6 million domestic client accounts, representing $1.562 trillion in client assets worldwide.

On January 13, 2009, Citi announced the merger of Smith Barney with Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Citi received $2.7 billion and a 49% interest in the joint venture.

In June 2013, Citi sold its remaining 49% stake in Smith Barney to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management for $13.5 billion following an appraisal by Perella Weinberg.

===Return to profitability, denationalization (2010)===
In 2010, Citigroup achieved its first profitable year since 2007. It reported $10.6 billion in net profit, compared with a $1.6 billion loss in 2009. Late in 2010, the government sold its remaining stock holding in the company, yielding an overall net profit to taxpayers of $12 billion (~$ in ). A special IRS tax exception given to Citi allowed the US Treasury to sell its shares at a profit, while it still owned Citigroup shares, which eventually netted $12 billion. According to Treasury spokeswoman Nayyera Haq, &quot;This (IRS tax) rule was designed to stop corporate raiders from using loss corporations to evade taxes and was never intended to address the unprecedented situation where the government owned shares in banks. And it was certainly not written to prevent the government from selling its shares for a profit.&quot;

===Expansion of retail banking operations (2011)===
In 2011, Citi was the first bank to introduce digitized Smart Banking branches in Washington, D.C., New York, Tokyo and Busan (South Korea) while it continued renovating its entire branch network. New sales and service centers were also opened in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Citi Express modules, 24-hour service units, were introduced in Colombia. Citi opened additional branches in China, expanding its branch presence to 13 cities in China.

===Expansion of credit card operations (2011)===
Citi Branded Cards introduced several new products in 2011, including: Citi ThankYou, Citi Executive/AAdvantage and Citi Simplicity cards in the U.S. It also has Latin America partnership cards with Colombia-based airline Avianca and with Banamex and AeroMexico; and a merchant loyalty program in Europe. Citibank is also the first and currently the only international bank to be approved by Chinese regulators to issue credit cards under its own brand without cooperating with Chinese state-owned domestic banks.

===Chinese investment banking joint venture (2012)===
In 2012, the Global Markets division and Orient Securities formed Citi Orient Securities, a Shanghai-based equity and debt brokerage operating in the Chinese market. In January 2019, Citigroup announced that it sold its stake in the business to its Chinese partner.

===Federal Reserve stress tests (2012–2016)===
The company failed the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress tests in 2012 due to Citi&#x27;s high capital return plan and its international loans, which were rated by the Fed to be at higher risk than its domestic American loans.

In 2013, Sanjiv Das was replaced as head of CitiMortgage with Jane Fraser, former head of Citi Private Bank.

The company failed the stress tests again in 2014, this time due to qualitative concerns.

However, it passed the stress tests in 2015 and in 2016.

In February 2016, the company was subject to a $1.1 billion fraud lawsuit filed by lender Rabobank and other investors as a result of the bankruptcy of Oceanografia SA, a Mexican oil services firm. The plaintiffs claimed that Citigroup conspired with Oceanografia to accept falsified work estimates. The courts found in favor of Citigroup.

In April 2016, Citigroup announced that it would eliminate its bad bank, Citi Holdings.

====Spin-off of Napier Park Global Capital (2013)====
Under the leadership of CEO Michael Corbat, Citi Capital Advisors (CCA), formerly Citi Alternative Investments, was a hedge fund that offered various investment strategies across multiple asset classes. To comply with the Volcker Rule, which limits bank ownership in hedge funds to no more than 3%, Citi spun off its hedge fund unit in 2013 and gave a majority of the company to its managers. The spin-off of CCA created Napier Park Global Capital, a $6.8 billion hedge fund with more than 100 employees in New York and London and managed by Jim O&#x27;Brien and Jonathan Dorfman.

====Downsizing of consumer banking unit (2014)====
In October 2014, Citigroup announced its exit from consumer banking in 11 markets, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Japan, Guam, the Czech Republic, Egypt, South Korea (consumer finance only), and Hungary.

===2015 onwards===
In May 2015, the bank announced the sale of its margin foreign exchange business, including CitiFX Pro and TradeStream, to FXCM and SAXO Bank of Denmark. Despite this deal, industry surveys pegged Citi as the biggest banking player in the forex market. The company&#x27;s remaining foreign exchange sales &amp; trading businesses continued operating in the wake of this deal under the leadership of James Bindler, who succeeded Jeff Feig as the firm&#x27;s global head of foreign exchange in 2014.

In November 2015, Springleaf acquired OneMain Financial from Citigroup.

In February 2016, Citi sold its retail and commercial banking operations in Panama and Costa Rica to the Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) for $360 million (~$ in ). The operations sold include 27 branches serving approximately 250,000 clients. Citi continues to offer corporate and institutional banking and wealth management in Panama and Costa Rica. On April 1, Citigroup became the exclusive issuer of Costco-branded credit cards. In April 2016, Citi was given regulatory approval for its &quot;living will&quot;, its plans to shut down operations in the event of another financial crisis.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Citi provided support to cardholders including waiving late fees. It also announced that some lower paid employees would receive a one-off payment of US$1,000 to help them through the crisis. This was not just limited to the US. In Singapore where Citi had a large operation, low paid staff would receive S$1,200.

In August 2020, Citi mistakenly wired $900 million (~$ in ) to the creditors of one of its clients, the American cosmetics corporation Revlon. Citi sued to get most of the money back but as of June 2022 had been unsuccessful. In October, the same year, Citigroup was fined $400 million by the US bank regulators as a result of their risk in control systems and was ordered to update their technology. The company will have four months to make a new plan and submit it to the Federal Reserve.

In November 2023, Citigroup began initiating layoffs as part of a corporate overhaul. The layoffs were part of a restructuring plan announced by CEO Jane Fraser, which includes the formation of five new divisions and the departure of several senior executives. The move was in response to Citigroup&#x27;s stock performance and increased expenses. The full extent of the job cuts, referred to internally as &quot;Project Bora Bora,&quot; were reported to involve a reduction of at least 10% or 20 000 of the workforce in several departments.

====Combination of Markets and Securities Services (2019)====
In 2019, Citi combined its Global Markets and Securities Services business into Markets &amp; Securities Services, which includes broad trading and execution capabilities in addition to custody, clearing, financing and hedging services.

====Shrinking of consumer banking unit (2021–2024)====
In February 2021, Jane Fraser, became CEO of the company, the first female CEO of a Big Four bank.

In April 2021, Citi announced it would exit its consumer banking operations in 13 markets, including Australia, Bahrain, China, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. In January 2022, it was announced that UOB would purchase Citi&#x27;s consumer banking business in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam for approximately $4.9bn. In August 2023, it was announced DBS Bank had acquired Citi&#x27;s consumer banking business in Taiwan, Citi Consumer Taiwan, for a total consideration of $706m. Citi will continue to operate its consumer banking businesses in the US, Canada, Europe and in only 4 other markets: Hong Kong, Singapore, London and the UAE across the entire APAC and EMEA regions.

In January 2022, Citi further announced its plan to exit consumer banking in Mexico, as well as small-business and middle-market banking operations. On March 1, 2022, Citi disclosed an exposure of over $10bn in Russian assets, which may be materially affected by Russia&#x27;s expulsion from the SWIFT banking system.

In September 2022, Citi was planning to shutter its retail bank business in the United Kingdom. In January 2024, Citi announced that it would be cutting 20,000 jobs from the company. In June 2024, at its biennial Investor Day, Jane focused the conversation on Citi&#x27;s Securities Services business, the most profitable of its five business units.

In October 2024, it was reported that the company would move significant portions of its financial infrastructure to Google Cloud.

In December 2024, Citigroup along with Bank of America announced that they are exiting the  Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). 

====Involvement in controlling the sale of guns====
In 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported about Citi&#x27;s actions, under the direction of CEO Michael Corbat, to intervene in the matter of gun control. In particular, their credit card policies were set to restrict the sale of guns below age 21.

====Unintentional money transfers====
In late February 2025, the bank unintentionally transferred $81 trillion to the account of one of it&#x27;s clients, meaning to send just $280, before reversing the issue 90 minutes later, technically making him the worlds first trillionaire.

Following the branch opening in Ho Chi Minh City in 1998, Citi established its retail banking franchise in Vietnam in 2009.

===Naming rights to Citi Field===
Citigroup owns the naming rights to Citi Field, the home ballpark of the New York Mets Major League Baseball team, via a $400 million (~$ in ), 20-year deal that commenced with the stadium opening in 2009.

===Sioux Falls===
Citibank moved its credit card operations to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in 1981 after that state eliminated caps on interest rates.

==Regulatory action, lawsuits, and arbitration==
In 2004, Japanese regulators took action against Citibank Japan loaning to a customer involved in stock manipulation. The regulator suspended bank activities in one branch and three offices and restricted their consumer banking division. In 2009, Japanese regulators again took action against Citibank Japan, because the bank had not set up an effective money laundering monitoring system. The regulators suspended sales operations within Citibank&#x27;s retail banking for a month.

On March 23, 2005, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the former name of the American self-regulatory organization for broker-dealers, now known as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FInRA) announced total fines of $21.25 million against Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., American Express Financial Advisors and Chase Investment Services regarding suitability and supervisory violations of their mutual fund sales practices between January 2002 and July 2003. The case against Citigroup involved recommendations and sales of Class B and Class C shares of mutual funds.

On June 6, 2007, FInRA announced more than $15 million (~$ in ) in fines and restitution against Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., to settle charges related to misleading documents and inadequate disclosure in retirement seminars and meetings for BellSouth Corp. employees in North Carolina and South Carolina. FInRA found that Citigroup did not properly supervise a team of brokers located in Charlotte, N.C., who used misleading sales materials during dozens of seminars and meetings for hundreds of BellSouth employees.

In July 2010, Citigroup agreed to pay $75 million (~$ in ) to settle civil charges that it misled investors over potential losses from high-risk mortgages. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said that Citigroup had made misleading statements about the company&#x27;s exposure to subprime mortgages. In 2007, Citigroup indicated that its exposure was less than $13 billion, when in fact it was over $50 billion.

In April 2011, an arbitration panel ordered Citigroup Inc to pay $54.1 million for losses from municipal securities funds that cratered between 2007 and 2008.

In August 2012, Citigroup agreed to pay almost $25 million (~$ in ) to settle an investor lawsuit alleging the bank misled investors about the nature of mortgage-backed securities. The lawsuit was on behalf of investors who purchased certificates in one of two mortgage-backed securities trusts from Citigroup Mortgage Loan Trust Inc in 2007.

In February 2012, Citigroup agreed to pay $158.3 million (~$ in ) to settle claims that it falsely certified the quality of loans issued by its CitiMortgage unit over a period of more than six years, so that they would qualify for insurance from the Federal Housing Administration. The lawsuit was initially brought by Sherry Hunt, a CitiMortgage employee.

On February 9, 2012, it was announced that the five largest mortgage servicers (Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed to a historic settlement with the federal government and 49 states. The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and in-direct payments to the states and the federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. The five banks were also required to comply with 305 new mortgage servicing standards. Oklahoma held out and agreed to settle with the banks separately.

In 2014, Citigroup agreed to pay $7 billion (~$ in ) to resolve claims it misled investors about shoddy mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said &quot;The bank&#x27;s misconduct was egregious. ... As a result of their assurances that toxic financial products were sound, Citigroup was able to expand its market share and increase profits&quot; and that &quot;the settlement did not absolve the bank or its employees from facing criminal charges.&quot;

In July 2015, Citigroup was fined $70 million by the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and ordered to pay $700 million to customers. Citigroup had conducted illegal practices in marketing add-on products for credit cards, including credit monitoring, debt-protection products and wallet-protection services.

In January 2017, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. was fined $25 million (~$ in ) by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for order spoofing in U.S. Treasury futures markets, i.e., placing orders that were intended to be canceled before execution, and for failing to diligently supervise its employees with regard to spoofing.

===Enron, WorldCom, and Global Crossing bankruptcies===
On October 22, 2001, Citigroup was sued for violating federal securities laws by misrepresenting Citigroup&#x27;s Enron-related exposure in its 2001 Annual Report and elsewhere, and failing to disclose the true extent of Citigroup&#x27;s legal liability arising out of its &#x27;structured finance&#x27; deals with Enron. In 2003, Citigroup paid $145 million (~$ in ) in fines and penalties to settle claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Manhattan district attorney&#x27;s office.

In 2004, Citigroup paid $2.65 billion pre-tax, or $1.64 billion after-tax, to settle a lawsuit concerning its role in selling stocks and bonds for WorldCom, the second largest telecommunications company in the world, which collapsed after an accounting scandal.

On February 5, 2002, Citigroup was sued for violating federal securities laws and misleading investors by issuing false information about Global Crossing&#x27;s revenues and financial performance. In 2005, Citigroup paid $75 million (~$ in ) to settle the lawsuit. Citigroup was accused of issuing exaggerated research reports and not disclosing conflicts of interest.

In 2005, Citigroup paid $2 billion (~$ in ) to settle a lawsuit filed by investors in Enron. In 2008, Citi also agreed to pay $1.66 billion (~$ in ) to Enron creditors.

On November 8, 2007, Citigroup was sued for financial misrepresentations and omissions of what amounted to more than two years of income and an entire line of business. In 2012, the company paid $590 million (~$ in ) to settle the case.

==Criticism==

===Conflicts of interest on investment research===
In December 2002, Citigroup paid fines totaling $400 million (~$ in ), to states and the federal government as part of a settlement involving charges that ten banks, including Citigroup, deceived investors with biased research. The total settlement with the ten banks was $1.4 billion. The settlement required that the banks separate investment banking from research, and ban any allocation of IPO shares.

===Citigroup proprietary government bond trading scandal of 2004===
Citigroup was criticized for disrupting the European bond market by rapidly selling €11 billion worth of bonds on August 2, 2004, on the MTS Group trading platform, driving down the price and then buying it back at cheaper prices.

=== Plutonomy report ===
A leaked 2005 plutonomy report prepared by &quot;Citi&quot; global strategists for its investor clients documented the imbalance of wealth between the top 1% and the bottom 60% of 
Anglo-American (viz. United States, United Kingdom, and Canada) households. Six drivers and other economic measurements, such as income and savings rates were also studied and included, in what was described as &quot;an ongoing [bio-]technological revolution; capitalist-friendly governments and tax regimes&quot; 
both powered by and consumed by the wealthy;
the middle class was not its focus.

===2001–2009===

==== Terra Securities scandal ====
In November 2007, it became public that Citigroup was heavily involved in the Terra Securities scandal.

==== Allegations of theft from customer accounts ====
In August 2008, Citigroup agreed to pay nearly $18 million in refunds and fines to settle accusations by California Attorney General Jerry Brown that it wrongly took funds from the accounts of credit card customers. Citigroup paid $14 million of restitution to roughly 53,000 customers nationwide. A three-year investigation found that Citigroup from 1992 to 2003 used an improper computerized &quot;sweep&quot; feature to move positive balances from card accounts into the bank&#x27;s general fund, without telling cardholders. Brown said that Citigroup &quot;knowingly stole from its customers, mostly poor people and the recently deceased when it designed and implemented the sweeps ... When a whistleblower uncovered the scam and brought it to his superiors [in 2001], they buried the information and continued the illegal practice.&quot;

===2010–2019===

==== Shareholder rejection of executive compensation plan ====
At Citi&#x27;s 2012 annual shareholders&#x27; meeting on April 17, Citi&#x27;s executive compensation package was rejected, with approximately 55% of the votes being against approval. One of the largest and most activist of the shareholders voting no, the California Public Employees&#x27; Retirement System, stated Citi &quot;has not anchored rewards to performance&quot;.

==== Accusations of futures market manipulation ====
In January 2017, bank regulators fined Citigroup $25 million on account of five traders from the bank having manipulated U.S. Treasury futures more than 2,500 times between July 2011 and December 2012. Citigroup was criticized for failing to adequately supervise its traders and for not having systems in place to detect spoofing, which involves entering fake orders designed to fool others into thinking prices are poised to rise or fall.

==== Alleged money laundering by Raul Salinas ====
In 1998, the General Accounting Office issued a report critical of Citibank&#x27;s handling of funds received from Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of Carlos Salinas, the former president of Mexico. The report, titled &quot;Raul Salinas, Citibank and Alleged Money Laundering&quot;, indicated that Citibank facilitated the transfer of millions of dollars through complex financial transactions that hid the funds&#x27; paper trail. The report indicated that Citibank took on Salinas as a client without making a thorough inquiry as to how he made his fortune, an omission that a Citibank official called a violation of the bank&#x27;s &quot;know your customer&quot; policy.

=== 2020s ===

==== Failure to establish effective risk management ====
In 2020, Citigroup agreed to pay $400 million (~$ in ) to federal regulators over long-standing concerns regarding Citigroup&#x27;s failure to establish effective risk management. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said that Citi had engaged in &quot;unsafe and unsound banking practices.&quot; According to them, Citi had failed to correct problems that had been known for years.

The bank has also been accused of failing to control the flow of dark money through its accounts. In 2017, prosecutors claimed drug smugglers were using Citigroup&#x27;s Banamex USA unit to sneak dirty money into the United States from Mexico. The company agreed to pay more than $97 million to settle the allegations. In 2018, the O.C.C again indicted Citi for shortcomings in its anti-money laundering policies, Citi was required to pay $70M (~$ in ).

In June 2024, agents from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, citing recent investigations into the Sinaloa Cartel, said money launderers continually found ways to take advantage of Citibank&#x27;s lax controls and oversight policies.

==== Anti-Armenian discrimination ====
In 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ordered Citigroup to pay $24.5 million in fines and $1.4 million in restitution to Armenian Americans, alleging that the bank had illegally discriminated against members of the ethnic group and had unjustly denied them credit cards for which they had applied in a period beginning in 2015 and ending in 2021. According to the CFPB, Citigroup employees used the presence of &quot;-ian&quot; or &quot;-yan&quot; in applicant surnames as an indicator that a customer should undergo enhanced screening processes, while also deciding to avoid making mention of this screening method in emails. (The suffixes &quot;-ian&quot; and &quot;-yan&quot; are frequently found in Armenian surnames.)

==Communications==

===Lobbying===
Between 1998 and 2014, Citigroup spent nearly $100 million lobbying the federal government. As of 2008, Citigroup was the 16th largest political campaign contributor in the US, out of all organizations, according to OpenSecrets. From 1989 to 2006, members of the firm donated over $23,033,490, 49% of which went to Democrats and 51% of which went to Republicans.
Matthew Vadum, a senior editor at the conservative Capital Research Center, acknowledged these figures, but pointed out that Citigroup had been &quot;a longtime donor to left-wing pressure groups&quot;, and referred to a Capital Research Center Foundation Watch 2006 study of Fortune 100 foundation giving, where Citigroup&#x27;s foundation gave &quot;20 times more money to groups on the left than to groups on the right&quot; during the tax year 2003.

In 2014 Citigroup&#x27;s PAC contributed $804,000 (~$ in ) to campaigns of various members of Congress, i.e. 162 members of the House, including 72 Democrats, where donations averaged about $5,000 per candidate. Of the 57 Democrats supporting the 2015 Spending bill, 34 had received campaign cash from Citigroup&#x27;s PAC at some point since 2010. Citigroup&#x27;s 2014 donations favored Republicans only slightly. The bank&#x27;s PAC had been nearly as generous to Democrats as Republicans – $30,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (the maximum) and $10,000 to the &#x27;New Democrat Coalition&#x27;, a group of moderate Democrats most of whom voted for the 2015 spending package. Citibank&#x27;s PAC made donations to both the campaigns and the leadership PACs of many top Democrats who voted for the 2015 spending bill, including Steny Hoyer (Md.) House Democratic Whip and Representatives Jim Himes (D-Conn.) and Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Florida.).

=== Public and governmental relations ===
In 2009, former chairman Richard Parsons hired long-time Washington, D.C. lobbyist Richard F. Hohlt to advise him and the company about relations with the U.S. government, though not to lobby for the company. While some speculated anonymously that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) would have been a particular focus of Hohlt&#x27;s attention, Hohlt said he&#x27;d had no contact with the government insurance corporation. Some former regulators found room to criticize Hohlt&#x27;s involvement with Citigroup, because of his earlier involvement with the financial services industry during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. Hohlt responded that though mistakes were made in the earlier episode he&#x27;d never been investigated by any government agency and his experience gave him a reason to be back in the &quot;operating room&quot; as parties address the more recent crisis.

In 2010, the company named Edward Skyler, formerly in New York City government and at Bloomberg L.P., to its senior public and governmental relations position. Before Skyler was named and before he began his job search, the company reportedly held discussions with three other individuals to fill the position: NY Deputy Mayor Kevin Sheekey, Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s &quot;political guru ... [who] spearheaded ... his short-lived flirtation with a presidential run ..., who will soon leave City Hall for a position at the mayor&#x27;s company, Bloomberg L.P. ... After Mr. Bloomberg&#x27;s improbable victory in the 2001 mayor&#x27;s race, both Mr. Skyler and Mr. Sheekey followed him from his company to City Hall. Since then, they have been a part of an enormously influential coterie of advisers&quot;; Howard Wolfson, the former communications director for Hillary Clinton&#x27;s presidential campaign and Mr. Bloomberg&#x27;s re-election bid; and Gary Ginsberg, now at Time Warner and formerly at News Corporation.

On March 21, 2018, it was announced that Citigroup changed its policy to forbid its business customers from performing certain firearm-related transactions. The policy doesn&#x27;t affect clients who offer credit cards backed by Citigroup or borrow money, use banking services, or raise capital through the company.

<text>Adalberto Martínez Chávez (25 January 1916 – April 4, 2003), better known in the entertainment world as Resortes, was a renowned Mexican actor. Known primarily for his talent as a comedian, he was also a dancer. His stage name is Spanish for &quot;spring&quot;, or also &quot;coil&quot;.

Resortes, who began his career as a member of a circus, made his motion picture debut in 1946. He participated in more than 50 Mexican movies throughout his career, and he also participated in many television series. Many of his best films he made were &quot;El Rey de México El Oreja Rajada&quot; (&quot;The King of Mexico&quot;), &quot;El Cartero del Barrio&quot;, &quot;Al son del mambo&quot; (&quot;To the Mambo&#x27;s Rhythm&quot;) and &quot;El Futbolista Fenómeno&quot; (&quot;The Phenomenal Soccer Player&quot;). But one of his most famous movies was &quot;La Niña de la Mochila Azul&quot; (&quot;The Girl With the Blue Back Pack&quot;). That movie also had a sequel, &quot;La Niña de la Mochila Azul 2&quot; (&quot;The Girl With the Blue Back Pack 2&quot;). Those two movies in particular became two of the largest teen movie hits in Mexican movie history and helped Resortes gain familiarity among the younger generations during the 1980s. 

Resortes was hospitalized with emphysema on April 3, 2003, and died on April 4.

<doc id="207314" wikidata="Q217167" url="?curid=207314" title="Faisal of Saudi Arabia">
<text>Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud ( ; 14 April 1906 – 25 March 1975) was King of Saudi Arabia from 2 November 1964 until his assassination in 1975. Before his ascension, he served as Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia from 9 November 1953 to 2 November 1964, and he was briefly regent to his half-brother King Saud in 1964. He was prime minister from 1954 to 1960 and from 1962 to 1975. Faisal was the third son of King Abdulaziz, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia.

Faisal was born in Riyadh to Abdulaziz, then Emir of Nejd, and Tarfa bint Abdullah Al Sheikh. Faisal&#x27;s mother was from the Al ash-Sheikh family, which has produced many prominent Saudi religious leaders. Faisal emerged as an influential political figure during his father&#x27;s reign. He served as viceroy of Hejaz from 1926 to 1932. He was the Saudi foreign minister from 1930 and prime minister from 1954 until his death, except for a two-year break in both positions from 1960 to 1962. After his father died in 1953 and his half-brother Saud became king, Faisal became crown prince, and in that position he outlawed slavery in Saudi Arabia. He persuaded King Saud to abdicate in his favour in 1964 with the help of other members of the royal family and his maternal cousin Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al ash-Sheikh, Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia.

Faisal implemented a policy of modernization and reform. His main foreign policy themes were pan-Islamism, anti-communism, and pro-Palestinianism. He attempted to limit the power of Islamic religious officials. Protesting against support that Israel received from the West, he led the oil embargo which caused the 1973 oil crisis. Faisal successfully stabilized the Kingdom&#x27;s bureaucracy, and his reign had significant popularity among Saudi Arabians despite his reforms facing some controversy. Following his assassination by his nephew Faisal bin Musaid in 1975, he was succeeded by his half-brother Khalid.

== Early life and education ==

Faisal bin Abdulaziz was born in Riyadh on 14 April 1906. He was the third son of Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman, then Emir of Nejd; Faisal was the first of his father&#x27;s sons who was born in Riyadh. His mother was Tarfa bint Abdullah Al Sheikh, whom Abdulaziz had married in 1902 after capturing Riyadh. Tarfa was a descendant of the religious leader Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab. Faisal&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Abdullah bin Abdullatif Al Sheikh, was one of Abdulaziz&#x27;s principal religious teachers and advisers. Faisal had an older full sister, Noura, who married her cousin Khalid bin Muhammad, a son of Abdulaziz&#x27;s half-brother Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman.

Tarfa bint Abdullah died in 1906, when Faisal was six months old. He then began to live with his maternal grandparents, Abdullah bin Abdullatif and Haya bint Abdul Rahman Al Muqbel, who educated their grandson. Under the mentorship of his grandfather, Prince Faisal completed his studies of reading the Qur&#x27;an and studying Islamic law and doctrines at the age of nine. He also learned horseback riding and politics from his father. His father influenced him militarily and politically, and at a young age, Faisal was chosen to represent his father in international forums.

According to Helen Chapin Metz, Faisal, and most of his generation, was raised in an atmosphere in which courage was extremely valued and reinforced. From 1916 he was tutored by Hafiz Wahba who later served in various governmental posts.

== Early political experience ==

As one of Abdulaziz&#x27;s eldest sons, Faisal was given numerous responsibilities. In 1919 the British government invited Abdulaziz to visit London. He could not go, but he assigned his eldest son, Turki, as his envoy. However, Prince Turki died due to Spanish flu before the visit. Therefore, Faisal was sent to London instead, making him the first ever Saudi Arabian royal to visit England. His visit lasted for five months, and he met with British officials. During the same period, he also visited France, again being the first Saudi Arabian royal to pay an official visit there.

Abdulaziz gave his son Faisal many military duties to consolidate authority over Arabia. After the capture of Hail and initial control over Asir in 1922, Faisal was sent to these provinces with nearly six thousand fighters. He achieved complete control over Asir at the end of the year.

===Viceroy of Hejaz and foreign minister===
Prince Faisal was appointed viceroy of Hejaz on 9 February 1926 following his father&#x27;s takeover of the region. He often consulted with local leaders during his tenure. Faisal was the president of the Consultative Assembly and the minister of interior. In December 1931, following the announcement of the constitution of the Council of Deputies (Majlis al Wukala), he also became the president of the four-member council and minister of foreign affairs. He would continue to oversee Saudi foreign policy until his death—even as king, with only a two-year break between 1960 and 1962.

Faisal visited several countries in this period, including Iran in May 1932, Poland in 1932 and Russia in 1933. On 8 July 1932 he visited Turkey and met with President Kemal Atatürk. On 23 September 1932, the prince officially announced the establishment of Saudi Arabia on behalf of his father from Al Hamidiyah Palace in Mecca by reading out the royal decree that renamed the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Faisal commanded a campaign during the Saudi–Yemeni War in 1934, resulting in a Saudi victory. He and his half-brother Khalid visited the US in October 1943 following the invitation of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. This is one of the early contacts between Saudi Arabia and the US.

As King Abdulaziz neared the end of his life, he favored Faisal as a possible successor over his eldest living son, Crown Prince Saud, due to Faisal&#x27;s extensive knowledge, as well as his years of experience. Since Faisal was a child, Abdulaziz recognized him as the most brilliant of his sons and often tasked him with responsibilities in war and diplomacy. In addition, Faisal was known to embrace a simple Bedouin lifestyle. &quot;I only wish I had three Faisals&quot;, Abdulaziz once said when discussing who would succeed him. However, Abdulaziz made the decision to keep Saud as crown prince in the fear that otherwise would lead to decreased stability.

==Crown prince and prime minister==
King Abdulaziz died on 9 November 1953, and Prince Faisal was at his side. Faisal&#x27;s elder half-brother, Saud, became king. Faisal was then appointed crown prince. On 16 August 1954 he was made prime minister.

King Saud embarked on a spending program that included the construction of a massive royal residence on the outskirts of the capital, Riyadh. He also faced pressure from neighboring Egypt, where Gamal Abdel Nasser had overthrown the monarchy in 1952. Nasser was able to cultivate a group of dissident princes led by Prince Talal bin Abdulaziz, who defected to Egypt. Fearing that Saud&#x27;s financial policies were bringing the state to the brink of collapse, and that his handling of foreign affairs was inept, senior members of the royal family and the ulema (religious leadership) pressured Saud into appointing Faisal to the position of prime minister in 1958, giving Faisal wide executive powers.

A power struggle ensued between Saud and Faisal, and on 18 December 1960, Faisal resigned as prime minister in protest, arguing that Saud was frustrating his financial reforms. Saud took back his executive powers and, having induced Prince Talal to return from Egypt, appointed him as minister of finance in July 1958. In 1962, however, Faisal rallied enough support within the royal family to install himself as prime minister for a second time. Less than a month before this event Faisal held a secret meeting with US president John F. Kennedy in Washington, D.C., on 4 October 1962. The same year, Faisal announced the Ten Point Program, which outlined Saudi Arabia&#x27;s path to becoming an industrialized nation by implementing economic, financial, political, and legal principles. Among the highlights were:

* Issuing a basic system of governance derived from Islamic Sharia and developing the system of governance and the Saudi Arabian Council of Ministers.
* Establishing a system for the provinces, clarifying the method of local government, in the various regions of the Kingdom.
* Establishing a system for the independence of the judiciary, under the control of a Supreme Judicial Council, and establishing the Ministry of Justice.
* Establishing a Supreme Council for issuing fatwas, comprising twenty jurists.
* Improving the social level of the Saudi people, through free medical treatment, free education, and the exemption of many foodstuffs from customs duties. In addition, a social security system and a system to protect workers from unemployment were established.
* Establishing a program for economic recovery, strengthening the financial position of the Kingdom, developing a program to raise the standard of living of citizens, establishing a road network linking parts of the Kingdom and its cities, providing water sources for drinking and agriculture, and ensuring the protection of light and heavy national industries. This includes allocating all the additional sums that the government would receive from Aramco for its rights claimed by the companies for the past years, and harnessing them to serve development projects.
* Continuing to develop girls&#x27; education as well as the advancement of women.
* The liberation of slaves and the abolition of slavery, once and for all in Saudi Arabia.

Faisal founded the Economic Development Committee in 1958. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Islamic University of Madinah in 1961. In 1962 he helped found the Muslim World League, a worldwide charity to which the Saudi royal family has reportedly since donated more than a billion dollars. In 1963 he established the country&#x27;s first television station, though actual broadcasts would not begin for another two years.

==Struggle with King Saud==
During this period, the struggle with King Saud continued in the background, with the royal princes meeting and asking Faisal to take over effective control from Saud. Saud had driven the country into serious debt and embarrassed the royal family by becoming embroiled in a plan to assassinate United Arab Republic president Gamal Abdel Nasser.

Faisal took advantage of Saud&#x27;s absence from the country for medical reasons in early 1963 to amass greater power for himself as Saudi Arabia&#x27;s political and economic circumstances worsened. He removed many of Saud&#x27;s loyalists from their posts and appointed like-minded princes in key military and security positions, such as his half-brother Prince Abdullah, to whom he gave command of the National Guard in 1962. Upon his return, Saud rejected Faisal&#x27;s new arrangement and requested that all of his powers be restored.

In response, Faisal called a meeting of all senior members of the royal family, excluding Saud, as well as ulema and tribal elders. Faisal had convened the tribe chiefs in response to Saud&#x27;s demand that his full powers be restored. As a result, the assembly supported Faisal and proposed that Saud be deposed from the throne and Faisal be proclaimed monarch. The Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al ash-Sheikh, a maternal cousin of Faisal, issued a fatwa (edict) calling on the King to accede to his brother&#x27;s demands. Faisal, on the other hand, urged that Saud keep the royal title. He was said to have felt bound by his oath to his father that he would recognize Saud as king. All that mattered, he maintained, was that Saud leave power in Faisal&#x27;s hands and stay out of public life.

As a last-ditch attempt to reclaim executive powers, Saud ordered the deployment of the Royal Guard at Nasriyah Palace, prompting Faisal to order the National Guard to surround Saud&#x27;s palace. His loyalists outnumbered and outgunned, Saud relented, and on 4 March 1964, Faisal was appointed regent. A meeting of the elders of the royal family and the ulema was convened later that year, and the grand mufti decreed a second fatwa, calling on Saud to abdicate the throne in favor of his brother. Faisal believed that Saud&#x27;s continued ill health compelled him to take the throne, thus absolving him of the oath. The royal family supported the fatwa and immediately informed Saud of their decision. Saud, by now shorn of all his powers, agreed, and Faisal was proclaimed king on 2 November 1964. Saud then went into exile, finding refuge in Egypt before eventually settling in Greece.

===Abolition of slavery===

Slavery did not vanish in Saudi Arabia until Faisal issued a decree for its total abolition in 1962. BBC presenter Peter Hobday stated that about 1,682 slaves were freed at that time, at a cost to the government of $2,000 each. The political analyst Bruce Riedel argued that the US began to raise the issue of slavery after the meeting between King Abdulaziz and US president Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, and that John F. Kennedy finally persuaded the House of Saud to abolish slavery in 1962.

==King of Saudi Arabia==
In a speech shortly after becoming king, Faisal said:

One of the earliest actions Faisal took as king was to establish a council to deal with future succession issues. The members were his uncles Abdullah and Musaid and his half-brothers Khalid, Fahd, Abdullah, Sultan, and Nawwaf. In 1967 Faisal established the post of second prime minister and appointed Prince Fahd to this post. The reason for this newly established body was Prince Khalid&#x27;s request and suggestion. The use of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s flag was made by him official on 15 March 1973, although it had been in use since 1902.

Faisal&#x27;s most senior adviser during his reign was Rashad Pharaon, his father&#x27;s private physician. Another adviser was Grand Mufti Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al Sheikh, who was influential in shaping the King&#x27;s political role in the Arab world.

===Modernization===
Early in his rule, Faisal issued an edict that all Saudi princes had to school their children inside the country, rather than sending them abroad; this had the effect of making it popular for upper-class families to bring their sons back to study in the Kingdom. He also introduced the country&#x27;s current system of administrative regions, and laid the foundations for a modern welfare system. In 1970 he established the Ministry of Justice and inaugurated the country&#x27;s first &quot;five-year plan&quot; for economic development.

One of Faisal&#x27;s modernization attempts was the new laws on media, publishing, and archiving and bilateral cultural cooperation protocols with foreign and corporate archives that kept records about mid-twentieth century Arabia. Television broadcasts officially began in 1965. In the same year, a nephew of Faisal attacked the newly established headquarters of Saudi television but was killed by security personnel. The attacker was the brother of Faisal&#x27;s future assassin, and the incident is the most widely accepted motive for his assassination. Although there was some discontent with the social changes he carried out, the Arab world grew to respect Faisal as a result of his policies modernizing Saudi Arabia, his management of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, his reputation as a staunch opponent of Zionism, and the country&#x27;s fast-rising financial strength.

===Economic development===
Faisal pursued strategies to maximize the utilization of oil revenue and initiated a thorough evaluation of the profit-sharing agreement with Aramco, which he deemed inequitable and requested its revision. Additionally, the government transitioned from engaging in oil reservoir exploitation agreements to exclusively granting oil investment concessions to state institutions. Following the declaration of bankruptcy within the government treasury, Faisal directed his focus towards revitalizing industrial, agricultural, financial, and economic enterprises, earning recognition for his instrumental role in the economic and administrative rejuvenation of the Kingdom.

Faisal took charge of formulating the nation&#x27;s five-year plans and started setting up the structure of administrative regions. To bolster the capabilities of state service institutions, he enlisted the aid of foreign consulting firms. Furthermore, he actively participated in the development of industries, agriculture, project initiatives, land investments, and the exploration of natural resources and sources of potable water. Faisal played a pivotal role in the establishment of the Petromin Corporation and laid the foundation for a comprehensive network of power plants. Additionally, he spearheaded the creation of essential industries such as petrochemicals, iron, steel, cement, and mining. Recognizing the significance of skill development, Faisal advocated for sending students to Western countries for training, thereby contributing to the growth of industrial ventures. In 1969, the Kingdom initiated its inaugural development strategy. Faisal held a meeting with US president Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966, forging a Saudi-American alliance focused on collaborative endeavors for the advancement of the Kingdom. Subsequently, in 1971, Faisal engaged with President Richard Nixon during a meeting in Washington. Three years later, in 1973, the Joint Saudi-American Economic Committee was established. A milestone occurred in 1974 when Nixon became the first US president to visit Saudi Arabia.

===Agricultural development===
In 1965, the Ministry of Agriculture collaborated with multinational consulting firms to establish a comprehensive program for water exploration. This initiative aimed to systematically search for water resources by extraction. The Ministry dedicated its endeavors to enhance agricultural practices, promote livestock and fisheries, conserve plant species, combat desertification, and provide guidance to farmers for improving date production. Furthermore, it actively encouraged the commercial sector to invest in the packaging and preservation of dates. Several significant projects were successfully accomplished during this period, including the construction of the Jizan Dam in 1970, which was completed with the assistance of foreign corporations. In Al-Ahsa, a water-saving initiative was implemented through an irrigation and drainage project, aimed at conserving water from springs and wells while effectively utilizing any surplus. Dams were constructed in Abha, Al-Majma&#x27;ah, and along Wadi Hanifa near Riyadh to collect rainwater. Moreover, agricultural ventures were initiated in Tabuk Province, Al-Jawf Province, Wadi Sirhan, Al-Qassim Province, Al Aflaj Governorate, Wadi Bisha, and Najran Province. The Ministry also instructed the Agricultural Bank to offer loans to farmers and fishermen for the procurement of essential equipment, with the condition that the loans be repaid in interest-free, long-term installments.

===Transportation development===
Under his leadership, Faisal oversaw the extensive expansion of modern road networks throughout the Kingdom, enlisting the expertise of international companies for their implementation. These developments facilitated connections with neighboring countries such as Jordan, Syria, Iraq, and Kuwait. Additionally, he prioritized the development of agricultural roads, enabling villages and farmers to transport their products to market efficiently. In the realm of aviation, airports were expanded and upgraded, while Saudi Arabian Airlines acquired jet planes to enhance their services. Notably, an institute for civil aviation training was established in Jeddah. In parallel, port traffic experienced significant growth, with the expansion of the Jeddah Islamic Port and the establishment of new ports in Yanbu and Jazan.

===Education development===
Education received paramount attention and underwent significant improvements during Faisal&#x27;s reign. Reforms were implemented in the curricula, accompanied by an increase in foreign educational missions. Special provisions were made to financially support families who lacked resources to educate their children, emphasizing equal opportunities for both male and female students. Textbooks were distributed free of charge, eliminating any associated fees. In 1974, Faisal also directed the establishment of Imam Muhammad bin Saud Islamic University in Riyadh. Furthermore, in 1967, he established the King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah. In 1974, he ordered the Council of Ministers to merge the university with the government, converting it to a public university and offering free education to Saudi students. In 1975, the College of Petroleum and Minerals in Dhahran was converted into the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals. Similarly, King Faisal University was established in Al-Ahsa in 1975, although it was inaugurated during the reign of his brother Khalid in 1977.

Faisal is recognized for his significant contributions to women&#x27;s education in Saudi Arabia, starting from his time as crown prince. In 1956, he established the first regular government school for girls in the country, known as Dar Al Hanan. This school was established under the patronage of his wife Iffat. A major milestone occurred in 1960 when a royal order was issued during the reign of King Saud, leading to the establishment of the General Presidency for Girls Education. This marked the official beginning of women&#x27;s education in Saudi Arabia, providing them with broader access to educational opportunities.

===Health development===
Medical professionals, including doctors and nursing staff, were recruited from various countries worldwide under the leadership of King Faisal. Recognizing the importance of healthcare, he issued an order to establish the King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh on land that he donated, which commenced its operations in 1975. Collaboration with the World Health Organization was fostered to develop government health programs. Notably, significant investments were allocated to the healthcare sector, with funding reaching 3.4% of the budget, aimed at advancing the foundational components of the healthcare system. In 1973 alone, the allocated budget for public health and social affairs amounted to 591 million riyals. The kingdom implemented a strategic planning system within its five-year plan from 1970 to 1975. The number of doctors increased to 1,020, health assistants rose to 3,750, hospital beds witnessed a 30% increase, dispensaries expanded by 60%, and the number of health centers grew to 200, reflecting the Kingdom&#x27;s commitment to enhancing healthcare services.


===Military development===
Upon ascending to the throne, Faisal devised a comprehensive strategy for the Royal Saudi Air Force that aligned with the prevailing needs and demands of the era. Recognizing the necessity of a distinguished institution capable of accommodating a substantial number of Saudi students and providing them with top-tier training, he embarked on the task of finding a suitable college. Consequently, the announcement regarding the establishment of the King Faisal Air Academy was made in 1967, and it officially commenced its operations three years later, specifically in 1970.

In December 1965, Faisal initiated a procurement of advanced weaponry and equipment, which included forty Lightning fighters. This consisted of 34 single-seat aircraft and 6 two-seat aircraft. Deliveries of these aircraft commenced on July 1, 1968, with two (F.Mk 53) aircraft taking off from Wharton and reaching Jeddah. The delivery process concluded in September 1969, with the receipt of the final aircraft manufactured, bearing the serial number (53-700), on June 29, 1972. The Lightning fighters remained in active service until January 1986.

In 1972, Faisal placed an order for 39 Mirage 5 aircraft from France. However, upon their arrival in the Kingdom in 1974, and before the Royal Saudi Air Force could utilize them, the King decided to donate the aircraft to Egypt in order to bolster their air force. Faisal undertook this gesture of support to assist Egypt in strengthening its military capabilities.

====Military cities====
During his reign, Faisal oversaw the establishment of the first advanced military cities. These cities were designed as modern complexes, encompassing military bases, training and shooting fields, warehouses for storing ammunition and combat equipment vehicles, as well as residential neighborhoods with educational, healthcare, recreational, and commercial facilities. These military cities also featured landscaped gardens, green spaces, and sports clubs. The inaugural military city was the King Faisal Military City, established in 1971 near the city of Khamis Mushait in the southern region. Subsequently, the King Abdulaziz Military City was established in the northwestern region and was officially inaugurated by King Faisal in 1973. These military cities represented significant developments in infrastructure and provided comprehensive facilities to support military personnel and their families.

===Steps against coups d&#x27;état===

The 1950s and 1960s saw numerous coups d&#x27;état in the region. Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s coup that overthrew the monarchy in oil-rich Libya in 1969 was especially threatening for Saudi Arabia due to the similarity between the two sparsely-populated desert countries. As a result, Faisal undertook to build a sophisticated security apparatus and cracked down firmly on dissent. As in all affairs, he justified these policies in Islamic terms. Early in his reign, when faced with demands for a written constitution for the country, Faisal responded that &quot;our constitution is the Qur&#x27;an&quot;. In the summer of 1969 he ordered the arrest of hundreds of military officers, including some generals, alleging that a military coup d&#x27;état was being planned. The coup was planned primarily by air force officers and aimed at overthrowing the monarchy and founding a Nasserist regime in the country. King Faisal claimed that Sami Sharaf, one of the Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s officials, was the planner of the plot. The arrests were possibly based on a tip from American intelligence.

===Religious inclusiveness===
Faisal seemed to hold the pluralist view, favouring limited, cautious accommodation of popular demands for inclusive reform, and made repeated attempts to broaden political representation, harking back to his temporarily successful national integration policy from 1965 to 1975. The King acknowledged his country&#x27;s religious and cultural diversity, which includes the predominantly Shia Al Ahsa in the east; the Asir in the southwest, with tribal affinities to Yemen, especially among the Ismaili tribes of Najran and Jizan; and the Kingdom of the Hejaz, with its capital Mecca. He included non-Wahhabi, cosmopolitan Sunni Hejazis from Mecca and Jeddah in the Saudi government. It was said that he would not take any decision regarding Mecca without seeking the advice of Sunni (Sufi) scholar al-Sayyid &#x27;Alawi ibn &#x27;Abbas al-Maliki al-Hasani, the father of Muhammad ibn &#x27;Alawi al-Maliki. Similarly in 1962, in promoting a broader, non-sectarian form of pan-Islamism, Faisal launched the Muslim World League where the Tijani Sufi scholar Ibrahim Niass was invited. Furthermore, he countered the outlook of certain prior Saudi rulers in declaring to the Saudi state clergy that, &quot;All Muslims, from Egypt, India etc. are your brothers&quot;. However Mai Yamani argued that after his reign, discrimination based on sect, tribe, region, and gender became the order of the day and has remained as such until today.

The role and authority of the state clergy declined after Faisal became king in 1964, even though they had helped bring him to the throne. Despite his piety and biological relationship through his mother to the Al as Shaykh family, and his support for the pan-Islamic movement in his struggle against pan-Arabism, he decreased the ulema&#x27;s power and influence. Unlike his successor Khalid, Faisal attempted to prevent radical clerics from controlling religious institutions such as the Council of Senior Ulema, the highest religious institution in Saudi Arabia, or taking religious offices such as Grand Mufti, responsible for preserving Islamic law. But his advisers warned that, once religious zealots had been motivated, disastrous effects would result.

Due to his status as a pious Muslim, Faisal was able to implement careful social reforms such as female education. Despite this, religious conservatives staged large protests. By holding talks with the conservatives, he was able to persuade them of the importance of progress in the coming years by using their own logic.

Corruption in the royal family was taken very seriously by religious figures in the Islamic theological colleges. They challenged some of the accepted theological interpretations adopted by the Saudi regime. One such influential figure was Sheikh Abdulaziz Bin Baz, then rector of the Al Medina college of theology (later he would serve as the country&#x27;s grand mufti). Faisal would not tolerate his criticism and had him removed from his position. However, the teachings of Bin Baz had already radicalized some of his students, one of which was Juhayman al-Otaybi.

===Interest in holy sites===

The Saudi Binladin Group was tasked with expanding Masjid al-Haram, which would be the first substantial enlargement in a thousand years. This massive project began in 1955, during the reign of King Saud, and continued for twenty years during the reigns of King Faisal and King Khalid. In 1967, a conference in Mecca brought together a significant number of Muslim architects to discuss possible design alternatives. Faisal objected to the conference&#x27;s recommendation to demolish a significant portion of the Ottoman structure, arguing that the Ottoman structure should be preserved and new architectural designs created using the best methods of convergence. A new phase of construction began in 1969 with the addition of two new wings and repairs to the sanctuary&#x27;s existing structure. During this phase, the surrounding roadways were developed and the squares were installed. At the time, the project cost approximately 800 million Saudi riyals. In 1962, he also ordered the reopening of the Kaaba Cloth Factory in Mecca due to political tensions between Egypt (then called the United Arab Republic) and Saudi Arabia.

The Muslim World League planned to renovate Maqam Ibrahim in 1965, with the maqam housed inside a crystal pillar with a silver lid. Faisal agreed and issued an order putting the plan in motion. Buildings were demolished to make the circumambulation rituals easier. By 1967, the area around Maqam Ibrahim had grown, and crowds were able to perform the circumambulation rituals in comfort and ease.

In the case of the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque, Faisal gave an order to construct prayer areas to the west of the mosque following the completion of the first Saudi expansion, which opened in 1955 and due to an increase in the number of pilgrims. It was built in 1973 and stood until the second Saudi expansion, when it was decommissioned. The Saudi Binladin Group was also sent to East Jerusalem in 1964 to perform restoration work on the Dome of the Rock.

==Foreign policy==
As king, Faisal employed Islam as one of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s foreign policy tools which differentiated him from King Abdulaziz and King Saud. However, he continued the close alliance with the United States begun by King Abdulaziz, and relied on the US heavily for arming and training his armed forces. Faisal&#x27;s first official visit as king to the US was in June 1966.

Faisal was anti-communist. He refused any political ties with the Soviet Union and other Communist bloc countries, professing to see a complete incompatibility between communism and Islam. He signed an agreement with Abdel-Halim Mahmoud, the Egyptian Grand Imam of al-Azhar, to combat Communism in 1971 during the presidency of Anwar Sadat. The agreement had a budget of 40 million pounds.

Faisal is said to have reminded the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, in a correspondence that he was not &quot;the Shah of France&quot; and that he should keep in mind that Iran was a majority Muslim country. This was in response to a provocative letter from Mohammad Reza asking Faisal to modernise Saudi Arabia, urging him to allow women to wear miniskirts and permitting the disco among other things. Otherwise, the Shah felt, he could not guarantee that the King would stay on the throne.

===Palestinian cause===
After he became foreign minister, Prince Faisal was recognized for his support for the Palestinian cause. His involvement with the Palestinian cause began in 1938, when he represented his father in the London Conference on the Palestine issue, where he delivered an important address opposing the partition plan. He wrote a message to the Saudi people in 1948 in which he discussed the Palestinian struggle and the suffering of the Palestinian people.

The Saudi delegation was led by Faisal and his brother Khalid at the St. James Palace Conference, which Britain called for, inviting representatives of the Arabs of Palestine, neighboring Arab states, and the Jewish Agency to consult with the British government in London on the partition of Palestine. The conference began on 7 February 1939 and ended on 17 March 1939, at St. James&#x27;s Palace in London. In light of the Woodhead Commission&#x27;s report, both the Arabs and the British government rejected the partition plan as impractical. The British government issued a policy statement rejecting partition as impracticable due to &quot;political, administrative, and financial difficulties.&quot; The conference was also unable to resolve the issue of Jewish immigration to Palestine, which had become more common following Nazi Germany&#x27;s annexation of all of Czechoslovakia.

Faisal was a global advocate for Palestinian rights, as evidenced by one of his speeches to the United Nations in 1963, in which he claimed that the Palestinian crisis is the only thing that has ruined Arab peace since the UN resolution to partition Palestine. One of his policies on this issue was to refuse to recognize Israel, to unite Arab efforts while leaving differences aside, to donate money and fight, to establish a body representing Palestinians, and to involve Muslims in the defense of the cause.
In his speech on 22 September 1947 to the United Nations, Faisal said:
==== Arson attack on Al-Aqsa Mosque ====
Between 23 and 25 September 1969, Faisal convened a conference in Rabat, Morocco, to discuss the arson attack on the Al Aqsa Mosque that had occurred a month earlier. The leaders of 25 Muslim states attended and the conference called for Israel to give up territory conquered in 1967. The conference also set up the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and pledged its support for the Palestinians.

===North Yemen Civil War===
The North Yemen Civil War raged between loyalists of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen and those of the Yemen Arab Republic from 1962 to 1970. The Yemeni republic was created after revolutionary republicans headed by the army under Abdullah al-Sallal staged a coup against Imam Muhammad al-Badr. As a result, the Imam fled to the Saudi Arabia–Yemen border, where he rallied backing from northern Shia tribes to reclaim control, sparking a full-fledged civil war. Saudi Arabia backed al-Badr and his royalist followers, while Egypt under the United Arab Republic backed the Yemeni republicans. As a result, Saudi and Egyptian relations were strained.

In September 1964, Nasser and Faisal met in Alexandria, Egypt, at the Arab summit. At the time, Egypt had 40,000 troops in Yemen, with 10,000 civilians killed. The two leaders committed in their formal declaration to completely cooperate in resolving current disagreements between Yemen&#x27;s diverse factions, collaborate in preventing armed clashes in Yemen, and to reach a peaceful conclusion. The declaration was widely praised in the Arab world, and Washington praised it as a &quot;statesmanlike action&quot; and a &quot;major step toward eventual peaceful resolution of the long civil war.&quot; At Alexandria&#x27;s airport, Nasser and Faisal exchanged heartfelt embraces and referred to each other as &quot;brother.&quot; Faisal said he was leaving Egypt &quot;with my heart brimming with love for President Nasser.&quot;

Gamal Abdel Nasser traveled to Jeddah on the Freedom ship in August 1965, marking his first visit to Saudi Arabia since 1954, when he came to perform Hajj. Faisal greeted Nasser warmly when he arrived. Despite their differences, the two countries&#x27; relations were restored. Both men came to an agreement on the following (known as the Jeddah Agreement) within 48 hours:

* The gradual withdrawal of Egyptian forces from Yemen within ten months 
* The cessation of all Saudi aid to the royalists 
* The formation of a Yemeni council of 50 members representing all Yemeni factions and charged with forming a transitional government in preparation for a general referendum to determine the future of Yemen

Sami Sharaf, an Egyptian official, recognized that implementing the agreement would be difficult because it had been rejected by all Yemeni parties. Republican chairman Abdullah al-Sallal stated, &quot;The agreement is a blatant interference in the independence of the Yemen Arab Republic, and a blatant attack on its sovereignty for all International laws.&quot; The royalists, on the other hand, backed the agreement at first before rejecting any attempt to terminate the war with the republicans.

The Haradh conference was conducted on November 23, 1965, under the auspices of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, to put the Saudi-Egyptian declaration between the two parties of the Yemeni conflict into effect. Judge Abd al-Rahman al-Iryani led the republican delegation, while Ahmed Muhammad al-Shami, the royalists&#x27; foreign minister, led the royal delegation. The conflicting parties, however, were unable to strike a compromise, which resulted in further bloodshed between republicans and royalists.

Egypt indicated its willingness to stop the war in Yemen as part of the Khartoum Resolution of August 1967. Egyptian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Riad suggested that Egypt and Saudi Arabia renew their 1965 Jeddah Agreement. Faisal was pleased with Nasser&#x27;s offer, and Imam al-Badr pledged to deploy his troops to fight alongside Egypt against Israel if Nasser kept his word. Nasser and Faisal signed a deal in which Nasser agreed to withdraw his 20,000 troops from Yemen, Faisal agreed to stop delivering weapons to al-Badr, and three neutral Arab states agreed to send in observers. Al-Sallal felt that Nasser had betrayed him. Nasser unfroze approximately $100 million in Saudi assets in Egypt, and Faisal denationalized two Egyptian-owned banks he had taken over earlier that year. Saudi Arabia, Libya, and Kuwait agreed to give Egypt a $266 million annual subsidy, with Saudi Arabia contributing $154 million.

===Six-Day War===
During the Six-Day War, Faisal ordered the Saudi Arabian Armed Forces to be on alert, canceling all vacations and mobilizing forces in the Kingdom&#x27;s north. Following that, orders were issued for a force of 20,000 Saudi soldiers to travel to Jordan to participate alongside the Arab forces. After the war, he directed that a Saudi force be stationed inside Jordanian territory to provide support and assistance as needed for ten years.

Furthermore, at the Khartoum Conference, Saudi Arabia, Libya, and Kuwait agreed to establish a fund worth $378 million to be distributed among countries affected by the June 1967 War. Saudi Arabia would contribute $140 million. However, Faisal did not attend himself and did not send a representative to the Arab League summits until 1969 to keep away from the requests of the Arab countries involved in the war concerning the increase of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s financial aid.

Faisal&#x27;s grandson, Prince Amr bin Mohammed Al Faisal, said &quot;I am told by my relatives, my other relatives, after 1967 and the fall of Jerusalem to the Israelis, that was a turning point in his life. He never smiled again, according to them. I didn&#x27;t see him smile much, and he became very quiet and contemplative, and mostly he would spend his time listening rather than speaking himself.&quot;

===Ramadan War===
After President Nasser of Egypt died in 1970, Faisal drew closer to Nasser&#x27;s successor, Anwar Sadat, who himself was planning a break with the Soviet Union and a move towards the pro-American camp. After Sadat launched the 1973 Arab–Israeli War, Faisal withdrew Saudi oil from world markets and was the primary force behind the 1973 oil crisis, in protest over Western support for Israel during the conflict. The embargo was initially imposed on Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but it was later extended to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. The price of oil had risen about 300 percent by the conclusion of the embargo in March 1974, from US to nearly globally; US prices were much higher. The embargo triggered an oil crisis, or &quot;shock&quot;, with numerous short- and long-term implications for world politics and the economy. This was regarded as the defining act of Faisal&#x27;s career, and gained him lasting prestige among many Arabs and Muslims worldwide.

In 1974 Faisal was named &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Man of the Year, and the financial windfall generated by the crisis fueled the economic boom that occurred in Saudi Arabia after his death. The new oil revenue also allowed Faisal to greatly increase the aid and subsidies begun following the 1967 Six-Day War to Egypt, Syria, and the Palestine Liberation Organization.

It is a commonly-held belief in Saudi Arabia, and the wider Arab world, that Faisal&#x27;s oil embargo was the real cause of his assassination, via a Western conspiracy.

==Personal life==
Faisal married many times concurrently. His spouses were from powerful families: Al Kabir, Al Sudairi, Al Jiluwi and Al Thunayan. His wives were:

* Sultana bint Ahmed Al Sudairi, the mother of his eldest son Prince Abdullah, whom Faisal fathered when he was between 15 and 17. Sultana was from the Sudairi family and the younger sister of Hassa bint Ahmed, the mother of the Sudairi brothers.
* Iffat bint Mohammad Al Thunayan (1916–2000), who was born and raised in Turkey. Her ancestors were part of the Al Thunayan branch of the Al Saud family. They first met in Istanbul around 1932 while he was in Turkey for an official visit. They had nine children, including Prince Mohammed, Prince Saud, and Prince Turki. Iffat was credited with being the influence behind many of her husband&#x27;s reforms, particularly with regard to women. Faisal also raised Iffat&#x27;s younger half-brother, Kamal Adham. The King later appointed Kamal as the first president of the Saudi intelligence agency, Al Mukhabarat Al A&#x27;amah. He was also an advisor to his royal brother-in-law.
* Al Jawhara bint Saud Al Kabir, the daughter of his aunt Noura bint Abdul Rahman and Saud Al Kabir bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. They married in October 1935. With Al Jawhara, Faisal had one daughter, Mashail (died October 2011).
* Haya bint Turki bin Abdulaziz Al Turki, the mother of Princess Noura, Prince Saad and Prince Khalid. She was a member of the Al Jiluwi clan. Princess Noura bint Faisal died on 13 March 2022.
* Hessa bint Muhammad bin Abdullah Al Muhanna Aba Al Khail, the mother of Princess Al Anoud (died June 2011) and Princess Al Jawhara (died April 2014).
* Munira bint Suhaim bin Hitimi Al Thunayan Al Mahasher, the mother of Princess Hessa (died in December 2020).
* Fatima bint Abdulaziz bin Mushait Al Shahrani, the mother of Princess Munira (died young).

Faisal&#x27;s children were well educated and had prominent roles in Saudi society and government. His daughters were educated abroad and they went on to graduate from a variety of schools and universities around the world. His sons were likewise educated abroad. Comparatively, only six of the 108 children of King Saud graduated from high school. Faisal&#x27;s son Turki received formal education at prestigious schools in New Jersey, and he later attended Georgetown University, while another son, Saud, was an alumnus of Princeton University. Faisal&#x27;s sons held important positions in the Saudi government. His eldest son, Abdullah, held governmental positions for a while. Faisal&#x27;s son Khalid was the governor of Asir Province in southwestern Saudi Arabia for more than three decades before becoming governor of Makkah Province in 2007. Prince Saud was the Saudi foreign minister between 1975 and 2015. Prince Turki served as head of Saudi Intelligence, ambassador to the United Kingdom, and later ambassador to the United States. One of Faisal&#x27;s sons, Abdul Rahman, was a graduate of Sandhurst Military Academy, and he died in March 2014. Faisal&#x27;s son Mohammed was a businessman. Faisal&#x27;s daughters also held important roles in Saudi society. From 2013 to 2016, his daughter Sara served in the Shura Council. She is also a prominent activist for women&#x27;s education and other social issues in Saudi Arabia, and so are her sisters Lolowah, Latifa, and Haifa.

Faisal&#x27;s daughter Haifa is married to Prince Bandar, son of Faisal&#x27;s half-brother Sultan by a concubine. The marriage of Princess Haifa and Prince Bandar forced Prince Sultan to recognize Bandar as a legitimate prince. Another daughter of Faisal, Lolowah, is a prominent activist for women&#x27;s education in Saudi Arabia. In 1962 his daughter Sara founded one of the first charitable organizations, Al Nahda, which won the first Chaillot prize for human rights organisations in the Gulf in 2009. Her spouse was Prince Muhammed, one of King Saud&#x27;s sons. His granddaughter Reem bint Mohammed is a photographer and gallery owner based in Jeddah, while another of his granddaughters, Reema bint Bandar, is Saudi Arabia&#x27;s first female ambassador.

Unlike most of his half-brothers, Faisal spoke fluent English and French. However, he preferred to speak in Arabic. When his translators made errors, Faisal would correct them.

===Personality and appearance===
Faisal was known for his integrity, extreme humility, kindness, and tact with everyone. As a result, he was ascetic, avoiding displays of extravagance and luxury. He had many hobbies, some of which were falconry, hunting, literature, reading, and poetry. He was also a big admirer of the yearly Najdi festivals and celebrations. Faisal chose to work long hours and set aside some of his interests after assuming power and becoming preoccupied with state affairs.

After coming to power in 1964, Faisal quickly caught the attention of the international public. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that Faisal looked like &quot;someone out of a poem by Rudyard Kipling or a casting office in Hollywood.&quot; He was around six feet tall, above average height, but not quite as tall as his father Abdulaziz and his brother Saud. Compared to other Muslim rulers such as Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, who almost exclusively wore European-styled outfits, Faisal was known to have dressed modestly, as he was most often seen wearing a traditional Saudi thawb, even in the presence of foreign dignitaries.

==Assassination and aftermath==

On 25 March 1975, the King was shot point-blank and killed by Faisal bin Musaid, son of his half-brother Musaid bin Abdulaziz. He had just come back from the United States. The murder occurred at a &quot;majlis&quot; (literally &#x27;a place for sitting&#x27;), an event where the king or leader opens up his residence to the citizens to enter and petition him.

In the waiting room, Prince Faisal talked to Kuwaiti representatives who were also waiting to meet King Faisal. When the prince went to embrace him, King Faisal leaned to kiss his nephew in accordance with Saudi custom. At that instant, Prince Faisal took out a pistol and shot him. The first shot hit the King&#x27;s chin and the second one went through his ear. A bodyguard hit Prince Faisal with a sheathed sword. Oil minister Zaki Yamani yelled repeatedly not to kill the prince.

King Faisal was quickly taken to Central Hospital in Riyadh. He was still alive as doctors massaged his heart and gave him a blood transfusion. Their efforts were unsuccessful, and he died shortly afterward. Both before and after the attack the assassin was reported to be calm. Following the killing, Riyadh had three days of mourning during which all government activities were suspended. The funeral service for King Faisal was performed at the King Abdulaziz Mosque in Riyadh, and was attended by several head of states such as Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan, Yasser Arafat, Hafez al-Assad, Idi Amin, Houari Boumediene, Ahmed Hassan al‐Bakr, Gaafar Nimeiry, Juan Carlos, Anwar Sadat, Mohammad Daoud Khan and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. He was buried in al-Oud cemetery on 26 March 1975. During the funeral, the newly ascended King Khalid wept over his murdered brother&#x27;s body.

One theory for the King&#x27;s murder was avenging the death of Prince Khalid bin Musaid, the brother of Prince Faisal bin Musaid. King Faisal instituted secular reforms that led to the installation of television, which provoked violent protests. Prince Khalid led an attack on a television station in 1966, and he was shot dead by a policeman.

In a documentary entitled &quot;Faisal, Legacy of a King&quot;, Faisal&#x27;s grandson Amr bin Mohammed bin Faisal claims that the King had distanced himself from the world days before his death. Zaki Yamani claimed that King Faisal told his own relatives and friends about a dream he had in which his father, the late King Abdulaziz, was traveling in a car and asked him to get in. Yamani went on to say that Faisal felt that his death was approaching. In Islamic beliefs, dreams hold significance and can sometimes carry messages or guidance.

Prince Faisal bin Musaid was captured directly after the attack. He was at first officially declared insane, but following the trial a panel of Saudi medical experts decided that he was sane when he shot the King. The nation&#x27;s high religious court convicted him of regicide and sentenced him to execution. He was publicly beheaded in Deera Square in Riyadh.

== Memorials and legacy ==
After his death, Faisal&#x27;s sons established an international philanthropic organisation, the King Faisal Foundation, in his honour. Faisal was eulogized by lyricist Robert Hunter in the title track of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Blues for Allah&quot;.

Gerald de Gaury published a biography of Faisal entitled &quot;Faisal: King of Saudi Arabia&quot;. In 2013 Russian Arabist Alexei Vassiliev published another biography, &quot;King Faisal of Saudi Arabia: Personality, Faith and Times&quot;. A movie directed by Agustí Villaronga in 2019 entitled &quot;Born a King&quot; is about the visit of Faisal to London in 1919 when he was thirteen years old.

In October 1976 King Khalid initiated the construction of Faisal Mosque in Islamabad, Pakistan. Lyallpur, the third largest city of Pakistan, was renamed Faisalabad (literally, &quot;City of Faisal&quot;) in 1979 in Faisal&#x27;s honour. One of the two major Pakistan Air Force bases in Karachi, the largest city in Sindh province, is named &quot;PAF Base Faisal&quot; in Faisal&#x27;s honour.

== Views ==
Faisal held pro-Palestinian views. Throughout his career, he supported the Palestinian cause, and he was noted for his strong criticism of Israel. He was also anti-communist, and Saudi Arabia under Faisal continued to be allied with the United States against the Soviet Union. Faisal also supported pan-Islamism, and he sought to establish unity among Muslims. Nevertheless, he reduced the power of the Islamic clergy during his reign.

<text>The law of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] consists of constitutional, statutory, and common law. The highest law in the State is the Constitution of Ireland, from which all other law derives its authority. The Republic has a common-law legal system with a written constitution that provides for a parliamentary democracy based on the British parliamentary system, albeit with a popularly elected president, a separation of powers, a developed system of constitutional rights and judicial review of primary legislation.

==History of Irish law==
The sources of law in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland reflect Irish history and the various parliaments whose law affected the island of Ireland down through the ages.

===The Brehon Laws===
The Brehon Laws were a relatively sophisticated early Irish legal system, the practice of which was only finally wiped out during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (ending in 1653). The Brehon laws were a civil legal system only – there was no criminal law. Acts that would today be considered criminal were then dealt with in a similar manner to tort law today. A perpetrator would have to compensate the victim, rather than having a punishment, such as imprisonment, imposed upon him or her.

=== Parliament of Ireland ===
The Parliament of Ireland made laws for the Lordship of Ireland and Kingdom of Ireland from 1297 until the end of 1800.

=== Parliament of the United Kingdom ===
After the kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain were united in 1800, the Parliament of the United Kingdom made laws for Ireland. This continued in the south until 1922.

===The first and second Dáil===
The first (1919-21) and second Dáil (1921-22) sat in opposition to British rule in Ireland. The laws passed by the first and second Dáil had no official legal effect.

==Constitutional law==
The Irish Constitution was enacted by a popular plebiscite held on 1 July 1937, and came into force on 29 December of the same year. The Constitution is the cornerstone of the Irish legal system and is held to be the source of power exercised by the legislative, judicial and executive branches of government. The Irish Supreme Court and High Court exercise judicial review over all legislation and may strike down laws if they are inconsistent with the constitution.

The Constitution can be amended only by referendum. A proposal to amend the Constitution is introduced into Dáil Éireann (the lower house of parliament) as a bill and if passed by the Dáil, and passed or deemed to have been passed by the Senate (the upper house), is put to the people. Only Irish citizens resident in the state may vote. There is no threshold for such referendums and a simple majority of voters is sufficient for a proposal to be passed. Once passed by the people, the President signs the referendum bill into law. As of November 2011, there have been 33 such referendums: 23 of which were approved by the people and 10 of which were rejected. The constitution was also amended twice during an initial transitional period of three years following the election of the first President of Ireland when amendments could be made without recourse to the people.

==Statute law==

Modern-day statute law is made by the bicameral National Parliament — more commonly known by its Irish name, the Oireachtas. Acts of the Oireachtas are split into sequentially numbered sections and may be cited by using a short title which gives the act a title roughly based on its subject matter and the year in which it was enacted. While the Oireachtas is bicameral, the upper house, the Senate (or &quot;Seanad&quot;), has little power which at most allows the Senate to delay rather than veto legislation, something that has only happened twice since 1937.

Article 50 of the Constitution of Ireland carried over all laws that had been in force in the Irish Free State prior to its coming into force on 29 December 1937, insofar as these laws were not repugnant to the new constitution. A similar function had been fulfilled by Article 73 of the Constitution of the Irish Free State, which carried overall legislation that had in force in Southern Ireland, insofar as these laws were not repugnant to the Constitution of the Irish Free State. As a result, while the Irish state has been in existence for a century, the statute book stretches back in excess of 800 years. By virtue of the Statute Law Revision Act 2007, the oldest Act currently in force in Ireland is the Fairs Act 1204. The statute law of Ireland includes law passed by the following:

* Pre-union Irish statutes
** the King of England as a lawgiver for Ireland, and the Parliament of Ireland (1169–1800)
* English and British statutes, which applied to Ireland in their original enactment or were subsequently applied to Ireland
** the King of England (1066–1241)
** the Parliament of England (1241–1706)
** the Parliament of Great Britain (1707–1800)
* Statutes of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
** the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which applied to Ireland in their original enactment or were subsequently applied to Ireland (1 January 1801 to 5 December 1922)
* Statutes of the independent Irish state since December 1922 (this state being known by various names, such as the Irish Free State and the Ireland, etc.)
** the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State (6 December 1922 to 28 December 1937)
** the present Oireachtas (from 29 December 1937 to date)

==Secondary legislation==
Notwithstanding the declaration in the 1937 constitution that the Oireachtas is to be &quot;the sole and exclusive&quot; legislature, it has long been held that it is permissible for the Oireachtas to delegate its law-making power(s) to other bodies as long as such delegated legislation does not exceed the &quot;principles and policies&quot; set out in the relevant authorising statute.

All instances of delegated legislation in Ireland are known as statutory instruments, although only a small subset of these are numbered as statutory instruments and published by the Stationery Office. This latter subset is composed of statutory instruments which are required to be laid before the Oireachtas or which are of general application.

In addition, a body of charters, statutory rules and orders and other secondary legislation made prior to the independence of the Irish Free State in 1922 continues to be in force currently in Ireland, insofar as such legislation has not been revoked or otherwise ceased to be in force.

==Common law==


Ireland was the subject of the first extension of England&#x27;s common law legal system outside England. While in England the creation of the common law was largely the result of the assimilation of existing customary law, in Ireland the common law was imported from England supplanting the customary law of the Irish. This, however, was a gradual process which went hand-in-hand with English (and later, British) influence in Ireland.

As with any common-law system, the Irish courts are bound by the doctrine of &quot;stare decisis&quot; to apply clear precedents set by higher courts and courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction. The main exception to this rule is that the Supreme Court has declared itself not to be bound by its own previous decisions.

While the doctrine clearly means that the present High Court is bound by decisions of the present Supreme Court, it is not altogether clear whether the decisions of courts which previously performed the function of courts of last final appeal in Ireland – such as the British House of Lords – bind the present High Court. In &quot;Irish Shell v. Elm Motors&quot;, Mr Justice McCarthy doubted that decisions of pre-independence courts bound the courts of the state, stating that &quot;[i]n no sense are our Courts a continuation of, or successors to, the British courts.&quot; However, the other two judges on the panel hearing the case declined to express an opinion on the matter as it had not been argued at the hearing of the appeal.

Post-independence judgments of the British courts, and all judgments of the American and Commonwealth courts, as well as some judgments of courts in Northern Ireland, are of persuasive value only and do not bind the courts of Ireland.

==European Union law==
The &quot;European Communities Act 1972&quot;, as amended, provides that treaties of the European Union are part of Irish law, along with directly effective measures adopted under those treaties. It also provides that government ministers may adopt statutory instruments to implement European Union law and that as an exception to the general rule such statutory instruments have effect as if they were primary legislation.

==International law==
Ireland is a dualist state and treaties are not part of Irish domestic law unless incorporated by the Oireachtas. An exception to this rule might well be the provision in the constitution which says that &quot;Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States.&quot; However, while this provision has been held to assimilate the doctrine of sovereign immunity into domestic law, the Supreme Court has held that the provision is not capable of conferring rights on individuals.

The dualist approach in international law contained in the Irish Constitution allows the state to sign and ratify treaties without incorporating them into domestic law. Thus, while Ireland was one of the first states in Europe to ratify the European Convention on Human Rights, it was one of the last to incorporate the Convention into domestic law. And when done it was not directly incorporated into Irish law but given indirect, sub-constitutional, interpretative incorporation.

In &quot;Crotty v. An Taoiseach&quot;, the Irish Supreme Court asserted a power to review the constitutionality of treaties signed by the state, such that the government could be prevented from signing international agreements which would be contrary to the constitution. This ruling has resulted in &quot;ad hoc&quot; amendments to the constitution to permit the state to ratify treaties that might otherwise have been contrary to the constitution.

<doc id="207322" wikidata="Q57193" url="?curid=207322" title="Moritz Schlick">
<text>Friedrich Albert Moritz Schlick (; ; 14 April 1882 – 22 June 1936) was a German philosopher, physicist, and the founding father of logical positivism and the Vienna Circle.

==Early life and works==
Schlick was born in Berlin to a wealthy Prussian family with deep nationalist and conservative traditions. His father was Ernst Albert Schlick and his mother was Agnes Arndt. At the age of sixteen, he started to read Descartes&#x27; &quot;Meditations&quot; and Schopenhauer&#x27;s &quot;Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik&quot;. Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot; especially impressed him.

He studied physics at the University of Heidelberg, the University of Lausanne, and, ultimately, the University of Berlin under Max Planck. Schlick explained this choice in his autobiography by saying that, despite his love for philosophy, he believed that only mathematical physics could help him obtain actual and exact knowledge. He felt deep distrust towards any metaphysical speculation.

In 1904, he completed his PhD thesis at the University of Berlin under the supervision of Planck. Schlick&#x27;s thesis was titled &quot;Über die Reflexion des Lichts in einer inhomogenen Schicht&quot; (&quot;On the Reflection of Light in a Non-Homogeneous Medium&quot;). After a year as Privatdozent at Göttingen, he turned to the study of philosophy in Zurich. In 1907, he married Blanche Hardy. In 1908, he published &quot;Lebensweisheit&quot; (&quot;The Wisdom of Life&quot;), a slim volume about eudaemonism, the theory that happiness results from the pursuit of personal fulfillment as opposed to passing pleasures.

His habilitation thesis at the University of Rostock, &quot;Das Wesen der Wahrheit nach der modernen Logik&quot; (&quot;The Nature of Truth According to Modern Logic&quot;), was published in 1910. Several essays about aesthetics followed, whereupon Schlick turned his attention to problems of epistemology, the philosophy of science, and more general questions about science. In this last category, Schlick distinguished himself by publishing a paper in 1915 about Einstein&#x27;s special theory of relativity, a topic only ten years old. He also published &quot;Raum und Zeit in der gegenwärtigen Physik&quot; (&quot;Space and Time in Contemporary Physics&quot;), which extended his earlier results by applying Poincaré&#x27;s geometric conventionalism to explain Einstein&#x27;s adoption of a non-Euclidean geometry in the general theory of relativity. Schlick corresponded by letter with Einstein and Einstein praised the book, stating “from the philosophical side nothing has been written about the subject with anything like the same degree of clarity”.

==The Vienna Circle and Wittgenstein==

After early appointments at Rostock and Kiel, in 1922 Schlick assumed the chair of Naturphilosophie at the University of Vienna which had previously been held by Ludwig Boltzmann and Ernst Mach. Schlick displayed an unusual success in organizing talented individuals in the philosophical and scientific spheres. When Schlick arrived in Vienna, he was invited to lead a group of scientists and philosophers who met regularly (on Thursday evenings in the Chemistry Building) to discuss philosophical topics in the sciences. Early members included the mathematician Hans Hahn and, within a few years, they were joined by Rudolf Carnap, Herbert Feigl, Kurt Gödel, Otto Neurath, Friedrich Waismann, and others. They initially called themselves the Ernst Mach Association, but they eventually became best known as the Vienna Circle.

In the years 1925–26, the Thursday night group discussed recent work in the foundations of mathematics by Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein&#x27;s book, &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot;, was a work that advanced, among other things, a logical theory of symbolism and a &quot;picture&quot; or &quot;model&quot; theory of language. Schlick and his group were impressed by the work, devoting considerable time to its study and, even when it was no longer the principal focus of their discussion, it was mentioned in discussion.

Eventually Wittgenstein agreed to meet with Schlick and other Circle members to discuss the &quot;Tractatus&quot; and other ideas, but he later found it necessary to restrict the visitors to sympathetic interlocutors. Through Schlick&#x27;s influence, Wittgenstein was encouraged to consider a return to philosophy after some ten years away from the field. Schlick and Waismann&#x27;s discussions with Wittgenstein continued until the latter felt that germinal ideas had been used without permission in an essay by Carnap, a charge of dubious merit. But he continued discussions in letters to Schlick after he no longer met with other Circle members.

==&quot;General Theory of Knowledge&quot; and other works==

Schlick had worked on his &quot;Allgemeine Erkenntnislehre&quot; (&quot;General Theory of Knowledge&quot;) between 1918 and 1925, and, though later developments in his philosophy were to make various contentions of his epistemology untenable, the &quot;General Theory&quot; is perhaps his greatest work in its acute reasoning against synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge. This critique of synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge argues that the only truths which are self-evident to reason are statements which are true as a matter of definition, such as the statements of formal logic and mathematics. The truth of all other statements must be evaluated with reference to empirical evidence. If a statement is proposed which is not a matter of definition, and not capable of being confirmed or falsified by evidence, that statement is &quot;metaphysical&quot;, which is synonymous with &quot;meaningless&quot;, or &quot;nonsense&quot;. This is the principle upon which members of the Vienna Circle were most clearly in agreement—with each other, as well as with Wittgenstein.

Schlick distinguished between internal rules and application rules of language. The former are grammar rules which govern the usage of expressions in relation to other expressions, such as formation rules and transformation rules. The latter are rules which govern the application of language to things external to language, these include descriptions of observations and the use of indexicals and demonstratives.

===Free Will===
Schlick believed in free will. He regarded the &quot;so-called problem of the freedom of the will&quot; as a &quot;pseudo-problem&quot; which was &quot;one of the greatest scandals of philosophy&quot;.

In Schlick&#x27;s view the supposed contradiction between determinism and free will was caused by a misunderstanding due to an &quot;an erroneous interpretation of the meaning of &#x27;law&#x27;&quot;. In the legal system a law is &quot;a rule by which the state prescribes certain behavior to its citizens&quot;. Whereas in science &quot;the word &#x27;law&#x27; means something quite different. The natural law is not a prescription as to how something should behave, but a formula, a description of how something does in fact behave. The two forms of &#x27;laws&#x27; have only this in common: both tend to be expressed in formulae&#x27;. This has led to confusion among philosophers and &quot;since natural laws are only descriptions of what happens, there can be in regard to them no talk of &#x27;compulsion&#x27;&quot;.

He wrote that:
It is again very deplorable that the word &quot;necessary&quot; has been applied to natural laws (or, what amounts to the same thing, with reference to causality), for it is quite superfluous, since the expression &quot;universally valid&quot; is available. Universal validity is something altogether different from &quot;compulsion&quot;; these concepts belong to spheres so remote from each other that once insight into the error has been gained one can no longer conceive the possibility of a confusion.

==&quot;Problems of Ethics&quot;==
Between 1926 and 1930, Schlick labored to finish &quot;Fragen der Ethik&quot; (&quot;Problems of Ethics&quot;), in which he surprised some of his fellow Circlists by including ethics as a viable branch of philosophy. In his 1932–33 contribution to &quot;Erkenntnis&quot;, &quot;Positivism and Realism&quot;, Schlick offered one of the most illuminating definitions of positivism as every view &quot;which denies the possibility of metaphysics&quot; (Schlick [1932–1933], p. 260). Accordingly, he defined metaphysics as the doctrine of &quot;true being&quot;, &quot;thing in itself&quot; or &quot;transcendental being&quot;, a doctrine which obviously &quot;presupposes that a non-true, lesser or apparent being stands opposed to it&quot; (Ibid). Therefore, in this work he bases the positivism on a kind of epistemology which holds that the only true beings are givens or constituents of experience. Also during this time, the Vienna Circle published &quot;The Scientific View of the World: The Vienna Circle&quot; as a homage to Schlick. Its strong anti-metaphysical stance crystallized the viewpoint of the group.

===Comment on Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus&quot;===
Rudolf Carnap, in his book &quot;Logical Syntax of Language&quot;, included a comment by Schlick on Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus&quot;.

==Death==

With the rise of the Nazis in Germany and Austrofascism in Austria, many of the Vienna Circle&#x27;s members left for the United States and the United Kingdom. Schlick, however, stayed on at the University of Vienna. When visited by Herbert Feigl in 1935, he expressed dismay at events in Germany. On 22 June 1936, Schlick was ascending the steps of the university for a class when he was confronted by a former student, Johann Nelböck, who killed Schlick with a pistol. The court declared Nelböck to be of sound mind; he confessed to the act and was detained without any resistance, but was unrepentant.

The killer used the judicial proceedings as a chance to present himself and his ideology in the public. He claimed that Schlick&#x27;s anti-metaphysical philosophy had &quot;interfered with his moral restraint&quot;. In another version of the events, the murderer covered up all political causes and claimed that he was motivated by jealousy over his failed attachment to the female student Sylvia Borowicka, leading to a paranoid delusion about Schlick as his rival and persecutor.

Nelböck was tried and sentenced, but the event became a distorted &quot;cause célèbre&quot; around which crystallized the growing nationalist and anti-Jewish sentiments in the city. The fact that Schlick was not Jewish did not seem to matter to propagandists capitalizing on the crime, who associated Schlick with Jewish members of the intelligentsia. After the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany in 1938, the murderer was released on probation after serving two years of a 10-year sentence.

==Legacy==
Schlick&#x27;s enduring contribution to the world of philosophy is as the founder of logical positivism. His humanity, good will, gentleness, and especially his encouragement have been documented by many of his peers. Herbert Feigl and Albert Blumberg, in their introduction to the &quot;General Theory of Knowledge&quot;, wrote,

<text>&#x27; (, ), abbreviated DN&quot;&quot;&#x27;, is a daily newspaper in Sweden. It is published in Stockholm and aspires to full national and international coverage, and is widely considered Sweden&#x27;s newspaper of record.

==History and profile==
 was founded by Rudolf Wall in December 1864.

The first issue was published on 23 December 1864. During its initial period, the paper was published in the morning. In 1874 the paper became a joint stock company. Its circulation in 1880 was 15,000 copies. In the 1890s, Wall left and soon after, the paper became the organ of the Liberal Party. From 1946 to 1959, Herbert Tingsten was the executive editor.

The newspaper has been owned by the Bonnier Group since 1909, when Karl Otto Bonnier acquired the remaining shares that his family had not owned (his father Albert had already acquired some shares since 1888). Opinion leaders often choose as the venue for publishing major opinion editorials. The stated position of the editorial page is &quot;independently liberal&quot;. However, it left its formal alliance with the liberal establishment in the country in 1972.

==Location==
 operates from the so-called &quot;DN-skrapan&quot; (the DN skyscraper or Dagens Nyheter Tower) in Stockholm. This was completed in 1964 and was designed by the architect Paul Hedqvist. It is 84 metres (276 feet) tall and has 27 floors. In 1996, the entire enterprise moved to its current location on Gjörwellsgatan, which is adjacent to the old tower. The newspaper , also owned by the Bonnier Group, is located in this building as well.

==Circulation==
In the 1960s the circulation of was much higher than that of other Swedish dailies. The paper has the largest circulation among the Swedish morning newspapers followed by &quot;Göteborgs-Posten&quot; and &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot;, and is the only morning newspaper that is distributed to subscribers throughout the country. In 2001 its circulation was 361,000 copies. The 2004 circulation of the paper was 363,000 copies. The circulation of the paper was 363,100 copies in weekdays in 2005 but had dropped to 292,300 copies in 2010. In 2013, the print edition of had a circulation of 282,800 copies, reaching an approximate 758,000 persons every day. The web edition had on average roughly 1.5 million unique visitors per week during 2013.

<text>Mills Bee Lane III (November 12, 1937 – December 6, 2022) was an American boxing referee and professional boxer, a two-term Washoe County, Nevada district court judge, and television personality.

Lane was best known for having officiated several major heavyweight championship boxing matches in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, and for starring in the syndicated court show &quot;Judge Mills Lane&quot;. On June 9, 2013, Lane was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame, and was inducted into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame on August 10 the same year.

==Early life==
Lane was born in Savannah, Georgia, on November 12, 1937. He hailed from a prominent Georgia family: his grandfather founded the largest bank in Georgia, and his uncle (and namesake) was the president of Citizens &amp; Southern National Bank.

Lane attended Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, where he played American football as a linebacker and ice hockey as a goaltender. Lane joined the United States Marine Corps in 1956, and was discharged in 1959. Subsequently, he enrolled at the University of Nevada, Reno. He graduated with a business degree in 1963.

== Boxing career==
=== Boxer ===
Lane became a boxer while serving as a Marine, becoming the All-Far East welterweight champ. He was a National Collegiate Athletic Association welterweight boxing champion in 1960. In the U.S. Olympic Trials in San Francisco for the 1960 Summer Olympics, Lane was defeated by Phil Baldwin in the semifinals. He turned pro while in college, eventually earning a record as a professional.

=== Referee ===
Lane refereed his first world championship boxing match in 1971, when Betulio González had a fifteen-round draw with Erbito Salavarria for the WBC flyweight title.

Lane refereed the second fight between WBA Heavyweight Champion Evander Holyfield and challenger Mike Tyson on June 28, 1997. Mitch Halpern was supposed to referee the fight, but Tyson&#x27;s camp protested, so Lane was brought in at the last minute. After Tyson bit Holyfield&#x27;s ears twice, Lane disqualified him. Lane&#x27;s shirt was stained with blood from the incident, and he sold it to a memorabilia collector on the same night.

Less than three weeks later, Lane refereed the Lennox Lewis vs. Henry Akinwande match. As in Tyson vs. Holyfield, it ended in disqualification when Akinwande used illegal tactics, these being excessive clinching and ignoring Lane&#x27;s repeated orders to stop. After refereeing the fight between Thomas Hearns and Jay Snyder on November 6, 1998, Lane retired as a boxing referee.

Lane was elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2013. On August 10 that same year, he was also inducted into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame.

== Legal career ==
Lane attended the University of Utah&#x27;s S.J. Quinney College of Law, graduating with the class of 1970 and joined the bar in Nevada. In 1979, Lane became Chief Deputy Sheriff of Investigative Services at the Washoe County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. Lane also served as one of fourteen witnesses to Nevada&#x27;s last gas chamber execution, that of Jesse Bishop that same year. He was elected District Attorney in 1982 and District Judge in 1990.

==Television career==
Lane presided over the court show &quot;Judge Mills Lane&quot;, which lasted for three seasons, from 1998 to 2001. In addition to this show, the producers of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; approached him about having his character and voice used in their show as the referee of their plasticine figure matches. Lane accepted the offer and became an MTV personality. As a referee, Lane started boxing matches by declaring &quot;Let&#x27;s get it on!&quot;, which became his catchphrase. This was reproduced in &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; as his character would shout the same phrase to initiate fights.

Lane made two appearances in the world of professional wrestling. He appeared on the November 16, 1998, episode of &quot;WWE Raw&quot; on the Titantron and made a ruling in regards to a contract dispute between Stone Cold Steve Austin and the McMahon family. He was also the special guest referee for a boxing match between &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper and Buff Bagwell at WCW Bash at the Beach on July 11, 1999.

Lane was a guest voice actor on an episode of &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Lane and his wife, Kaye, had two sons.

Lane titled his autobiography &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On: Tough Talk from Boxing&#x27;s Top Ref and Nevada&#x27;s Most Outspoken Judge&quot;.

Lane suffered a debilitating stroke in March 2002, which left him partially paralyzed and virtually unable to speak. With his blessing, this led to his &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; alter-ego being voiced by Chris Edgerly (already the voice of color commentator Nick Diamond) for the MTV2 revival.

Lane&#x27;s adopted city of Reno proclaimed December 27, 2004, as &quot;Mills Lane Day&#x27;&quot;. In May 2006, Lane made his first public appearance in years at the dedication of a new courthouse in Reno which is named after him. The Mills B. Lane Justice Center houses the Reno Municipal Court and the Washoe County District Attorney&#x27;s Office.

Mills Lane died from kidney failure at his home in Reno, Nevada on December 6, 2022, at the age of 85, in Reno, Nevada.
His son Terry said the cause was complications from Lane&#x27;s 2002 stroke.

<text>Sydsvenska Dagbladet Snällposten, generally known simply as Sydsvenskan (, &quot;The South Swedish&quot;), is a daily newspaper published in Scania in Sweden.

==History and profile==
&quot;Sydsvenskan&quot; was founded in 1870. In 1871 the paper merged with &quot;Snällposten&quot; which was started in 1848. &quot;Sydsvenskan&quot; is headquartered in Malmö and mostly distributed in southern Scania. Its coverage is characterized by local news from southwest Scania in addition to a full coverage of national, EU, and international news. The paper is owned by the Bonnier Group which bought it in 1994.

It was one of the Swedish publications which featured news materials provided by the Swedish Intelligence Agency during World War II. Until 1966, &quot;Sydsvenskan&quot; had close ties to the Rightist Party (now Moderate Party). In the Swedish debate about the country&#x27;s role in the EU and in relation to the Eurozone, the paper has emphasized the importance of a closer political, economical, and cultural affiliation to Europe. Its stated editorial position is &quot;independent liberal&quot;.

The newspaper changed its format from broadsheet to compact format on 5 October 2004.

===Introduction and then removal of paywall===
&quot;Sydsvenskan&quot; introduced a soft paywall in February 2013. Those who did not have a paper subscription could view a maximum of 20 free articles per month. A year after, this was changed to 5 articles per week. Subscription models were available from 28 Swedish kronor, with the cheapest one giving full access to the website. In August 2014, this was raised to 59 Swedish kronor (around US$7.10), as the former price was an introductory price. A year after the introduction of the paywall, 60,000 subscribers had created accounts on the website and 4,000 had purchased a digital subscription.

In January 2016, &quot;Sydsvenskan&quot; removed the paywall, with the editor-in-chief Pia Rehnquist saying that having a paywall had led to a general belief that you had to pay to read the website. She also said that the digital part is going well but they thought it would better to reach more readers.

===Acquisition of &quot;Helsingborgs Dagblad&quot;===
In the end of April 2014, &quot;Sydsvenskan&quot; acknowledged their intention to buy &quot;Helsingborgs Dagblad&quot;. A deal was reached in the end of May and the Swedish Competition Authority approved it around two weeks after. A strong reason was reported to be that both newspapers had seen their ad revenue decrease heavily.

==Circulation==

In 1998 the circulation of &quot;Sydsvenskan&quot; was 125,000 copies on weekdays and 146,000 copies on Sundays. The paper had a circulation of 129,300 copies on weekdays in 2005. It was 94,800 copies in 2012. The circulation of the paper was 99,800 copies in 2013.

<doc id="207336" wikidata="Q134938" url="?curid=207336" title="Salivary gland">
<text>The salivary glands in many vertebrates including mammals are exocrine glands that produce saliva through a system of ducts. Humans have three paired major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual), as well as hundreds of minor salivary glands. Salivary glands can be classified as serous, mucous, or seromucous (mixed).

In serous secretions, the main type of protein secreted is alpha-amylase, an enzyme that breaks down starch into maltose and glucose, whereas in mucous secretions, the main protein secreted is mucin, which acts as a lubricant.

In humans, 1200 to 1500 ml of saliva are produced every day. The secretion of saliva (salivation) is mediated by parasympathetic stimulation; acetylcholine is the active neurotransmitter and binds to muscarinic receptors in the glands, leading to increased salivation.

A proposed fourth pair of salivary glands, the tubarial glands, were first identified in 2020. They are named for their location, being positioned in front of and over the torus tubarius. However, this finding from one study is yet to be confirmed.

== Structure ==

=== Parotid glands ===

The two parotid glands are major salivary glands wrapped around the mandibular ramus in humans. These are largest of the salivary glands, secreting saliva to facilitate mastication and swallowing, and amylase to begin the digestion of starches. It is the serous type of gland which secretes alpha-amylase (also known as &quot;ptyalin&quot;). It enters the oral cavity via the parotid duct. The glands are located posterior to the mandibular ramus and anterior to the mastoid process of the temporal bone. They are clinically relevant in dissections of facial nerve branches while exposing the different lobes, since any iatrogenic lesion will result in either loss of action or strength of muscles involved in facial expression. They produce 20% of the total salivary content in the oral cavity. Mumps is a viral infection, caused by infection in the parotid gland.

=== Submandibular glands ===

The submandibular glands (previously known as submaxillary glands) are a pair of major salivary glands located beneath the lower jaws, superior to the digastric muscles. The secretion produced is a mixture of both serous fluid and mucus, and enters the oral cavity via the submandibular duct or Wharton duct. Around 70% of saliva in the oral cavity is produced by the submandibular glands, though they are much smaller than the parotid glands. This gland can usually be felt via palpation of the neck, as it is in the superficial cervical region and feels like a rounded ball. It is located about two fingers above the Adam&#x27;s apple (laryngeal prominence) and about two inches apart under the chin.

=== Sublingual glands ===

The sublingual glands are a pair of major salivary glands located inferior to the tongue, anterior to the submandibular glands. The secretion produced is mainly mucous in nature, but it is categorized as a mixed gland. Unlike the other two major glands, the ductal system of the sublingual glands does not have intercalated ducts and usually does not have striated ducts, either, so saliva exits directly from 8-20 excretory ducts known as the Rivinus ducts. About 5% of saliva entering the oral cavity comes from these glands.

=== Tubarial salivary glands ===
The tubarial glands are suggested as a fourth pair of salivary glands situated posteriorly in the nasopharynx and nasal cavity, predominantly with mucous glands, and its ducts opening into the dorsolateral pharyngeal wall. The glands were unknown until September 2020, when they were discovered by a group of Dutch scientists using prostate-specific membrane antigen PET-CT. This discovery may explain mouth dryness after radiotherapy despite the avoidance of the three major glands. However, these findings from just one study need to be confirmed. On the other hand, an interdisciplinary group of scientists disagree with this new discovery. They believe that an accumulation of minor salivary glands has been described.

=== Minor salivary glands ===
Around 800 to 1,000 minor salivary glands are located throughout the oral cavity within the submucosa of the oral mucosa in the tissue of the buccal, labial, and lingual mucosa, the soft palate, the lateral parts of the hard palate, and the floor of the mouth or between muscle fibers of the tongue. They are 1 to 2 mm in diameter and unlike the major glands, they are not encapsulated by connective tissue, only surrounded by it. The gland has usually a number of acini connected in a tiny lobule. A minor salivary gland may have a common excretory duct with another gland, or may have its own excretory duct. Their secretion is mainly mucous in nature and have many functions such as coating the oral cavity with saliva. Problems with dentures are sometimes associated with minor salivary glands if dry mouth is present. The minor salivary glands are innervated by the facial nerve (cranial nerve CN VII).

=== Von Ebner&#x27;s glands ===

Von Ebner&#x27;s glands are found in a trough circling the circumvallate papillae on the dorsal surface of the tongue near the terminal sulcus. They secrete a purely serous fluid that begins lipid hydrolysis. They also facilitate the perception of taste through secretion of digestive enzymes and proteins.
The arrangement of these glands around the circumvallate papillae provides a continuous flow of fluid over the great number of taste buds lining the sides of the papillae, and is important for dissolving the food particles to be tasted.

=== Nerve supply ===
Salivary glands are innervated, either directly or indirectly, by the parasympathetic and sympathetic arms of the autonomic nervous system. Parasympathetic stimulation evokes a copious flow of saliva. 
* Parasympathetic innervation to the salivary glands is carried via cranial nerves. The parotid gland receives its parasympathetic input from the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) via the otic ganglion, while the submandibular and sublingual glands receive their parasympathetic input from the facial nerve (CN VII) via the submandibular ganglion. These nerves release acetylcholine and substance P, which activate the IP3 and DAG pathways respectively.
* Direct sympathetic innervation of the salivary glands takes place via preganglionic nerves in the thoracic segments T1-T3 which synapse in the superior cervical ganglion with postganglionic neurons that release norepinephrine, which is then received by β1-adrenergic receptors on the acinar and ductal cells of the salivary glands, leading to an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and the corresponding increase of saliva secretion. Note that in this regard both parasympathetic and sympathetic stimuli result in an increase in salivary gland secretions, the difference lies on the composition of this saliva, once sympathetic stimulus results particularly in the increase of amylase secretion, which is produced by serous glands. The sympathetic nervous system also affects salivary gland secretions indirectly by innervating the blood vessels that supply the glands, resulting in vasoconstriction through the activation of α1 adrenergic receptors, lessening the saliva&#x27;s water content.

=== Microanatomy ===
The gland is internally divided into lobules. Blood vessels and nerves enter the glands at the hilum and gradually branch out into the lobules.

==== Acini ====
Secretory cells are found in a group, or acinus. Each acinus is located at the terminal part of the gland connected to the ductal system, with many acini within each lobule of the gland. Each acinus consists of a single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells surrounding a lumen, a central opening where the saliva is deposited after being produced by the secretory cells. The three forms of acini are classified in terms of the type of epithelial cell present and the secretory product being produced - serous, mucoserous, and mucous.

==== Ducts ====
In the duct system, the lumina are formed by intercalated ducts, which in turn join to form striated ducts. These drain into ducts situated between the lobes of the gland (called interlobular ducts or secretory ducts). These are found on most major and minor glands (exception may be the sublingual gland).

All of the human salivary glands terminate in the mouth, where the saliva proceeds to aid in digestion. The released saliva is quickly inactivated in the stomach by the acid that is present, but saliva also contains enzymes that are actually activated by stomach acid.

=== Gene and protein expression ===
About 20,000 protein-coding genes are expressed in human cells and 60% of these genes are expressed in normal, adult salivary glands. Less than 100 genes are more specifically expressed in the salivary gland. The salivary gland specific genes are mainly genes that encode for secreted proteins and compared to other organs in the human body; the salivary gland has the highest fraction of secreted genes. The heterogeneous family of proline-rich, human salivary glycoproteins, such as PRB1 and PRH1, are salivary gland-specific proteins with highest level of expression. Examples of other specifically expressed proteins include the digestive amylase enzyme AMY1A, the mucin MUC7 and statherin, all of major importance for specific characteristics of saliva.
=== Aging ===
Aging of salivary glands shows some structural changes, such as:
* Decrease in volume of acinar tissue
* Increase in fibrous tissue 
* Increase in adipose tissue
* Ductal hyperplasia and dilation

In addition, changes occur in salivary contents: 
* Decrease in concentration of secretory IgE 
* Decrease in the amount of mucin 
However, no overall change in the amount of saliva secreted is seen.

== Function ==

Salivary glands secrete saliva, which has many benefits for the oral cavity and health in general. The knowledge of normal salivary flow rate (SFR) is extremely important when treating dental patients. These benefits include:
* Protection: Saliva consists of proteins (for example; mucins) that lubricate and protect both the soft and hard tissues of the oral cavity. Mucins are the principal organic constituents of mucus, the slimy viscoelastic material that coats all mucosal surfaces.

* Buffering: In general, the higher the saliva flow rate, the faster the clearance and the higher the buffer capacity, hence better protection from dental caries. Therefore, people with a slower rate of saliva secretion, combined with a low buffer capacity, have lessened salivary protection against microbes.

* Pellicle formation: Saliva forms a pellicle on the surface of the tooth to prevent wearing. The film contains mucins and proline-rich glycoprotein from the saliva.
The proteins (statherin and proline-rich proteins) within the salivary pellicle inhibit demineralization and promote remineralization by attracting calcium ions.

* Maintenance of tooth integrity: Demineralization occurs when enamel disintegrates due to the presence of acid. When this occurs, the buffering capacity effect of saliva (increases saliva flow rate) inhibits demineralization. Saliva can then begin to promote the remineralization of the tooth by strengthening the enamel with calcium and phosphate minerals.

* Antimicrobial action: Saliva can prevent microbial growth based on the elements it contains. For example, lactoferrin in saliva binds naturally with iron. Since iron is a major component of bacterial cell walls, removal of iron breaks down the cell wall, which in turn breaks down the bacterium. Antimicrobial peptides such as histatins inhibit the growth of&quot; Candida albicans&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot;. Salivary immunoglobulin A serves to aggregate oral bacteria such as&quot; S. mutans&quot; and prevent the formation of dental plaque.

* Tissue repair: Saliva can encourage soft-tissue repair by decreasing clotting time and increasing wound contraction.

* Digestion: Saliva contains amylase, which hydrolyses starch into glucose, maltose, and dextrin. As a result, saliva allows some digestion to occur before the food reaches the stomach.

* Taste: Saliva acts as a solvent in which solid particles can dissolve and enter the taste buds through oral mucosa located on the tongue. These taste buds are found within foliate and circumvallate papillae, where minor salivary glands secrete saliva.

== Clinical significance ==
A sialolithiasis is a salivary stone that may cause blockage of the ducts, most commonly the submandibular ducts, causing pain and swelling of the gland.

Salivary gland dysfunction is either a reduced (hyposalivation), or an increased (hypersalivation) production of saliva. Xerostomia, the symptom of dry mouth is often caused by hyposalivation and is associated with significant impairment of quality of life. Following radiotherapy of the head and neck region, salivary gland dysfunction is a predictable side-effect. Saliva production may be pharmacologically stimulated by sialagogues such as pilocarpine and cevimeline. It can also be suppressed by so-called antisialagogues such as tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, antihypertensives, and polypharmacy. A Cochrane review found there was no strong evidence that topical therapies are effective in relieving the symptoms of dry mouth.

Cancer treatments including chemotherapy and radiation therapy may impair salivary flow. Radiotherapy can cause permanent hyposalivation due to injury to the oral mucosa containing the salivary glands, resulting in xerostomia, whereas chemotherapy may cause only temporary salivary impairment. Surgical removal of benign or malignant lesions may also impair function.

Graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may manifest as dry mouth and many small mucoceles. Salivary gland tumours may occur, including mucoepidermoid carcinoma, a malignant growth.

=== Imaging ===
A sialogram is a radiocontrast study of a salivary duct that may be used to check its function, and for diagnosing Sjögren syndrome.

== Other animals ==
The salivary glands of some species are modified to produce proteins; salivary amylase is found in many bird and mammal species (including humans, as noted above). Furthermore, the venom glands of venomous snakes, Gila monsters, and some shrews, are actually modified salivary glands. In other organisms such as insects, salivary glands are often used to produce biologically important proteins such as silk or glues, whilst fly salivary glands contain polytene chromosomes that have been useful in genetic research.

<text>Frank Abbandando (July 11, 1910 – February 19, 1942), nicknamed &quot;The Dasher&quot;, was a New York City contract killer and mobster who committed many murders as part of the infamous Murder, Inc. enforcement arm of the National Crime Syndicate. His preferred killing method was to stab his victims through the heart with an ice pick. After a trial and conviction for murdering a Brooklyn loan shark, he was executed in the electric chair at Sing Sing on February 19, 1942.

== Early years ==
Abbandando&#x27;s parents, Lorenzo Abbondandolo and Rosaria Famighetti, emigrated from Avellino, Italy, to New York City. He was born in New York on July 11, 1910. Abbandando was one of twelve children (of whom six did not survive childhood).

== Criminal career ==
Abbandando began as a teenager extorting money from shop owners by threatening to torch their shops. By his twenties, he had joined a street gang in the Ocean Hill section of Brooklyn where he quickly became a lieutenant of Harry &quot;Happy&quot; Maione. Abbandando organized gambling, loan sharking, and extortion rackets for the gang, as well as committing murders. In 1928, Abbandando was convicted of beating a New York police officer and was sent to reform school in Elmira, New York, where he demonstrated skill at baseball and received the nickname &quot;The Dasher&quot;.

While Abbandando was said to be a connoisseur of fine clothes and fancy cars, he was also a habitual sexual predator who would drive around his neighborhoods of Brownsville and Ocean Hill looking for young women to rape. The prosecutor at his murder trial said that Abbandando had all but admitted one rape, to which Abbandando replied, &quot;Well, that one doesn&#x27;t count really—I married the girl later.&quot;

=== Contract killer ===
In the early 1930s, New York&#x27;s Five Families began using gangs to commit their murders. This was because they had reformed their operating structures following the vicious, high-profile Castellammarese War which had made front-page news for its brutality. With the new peace, the mobs now wanted to keep a low public profile. By using contract killers, the Five Families were better protected from public and law enforcement scrutiny. These killers were led by Louis &quot;Lepke&quot; Buchalter, the young leader of the Jewish gang known as the &quot;Gorilla Boys&quot;. 

With the growth in racketeering, Buchalter&#x27;s small informal network of killers grew into a group of 250 criminals who were also involved in narcotics, labor unions, and other rackets such as gambling and prostitution. Buchalter called his group &quot;The Combination&quot; but the New York Press labeled it &quot;Murder, Inc.&quot; Unlike the Five Families, which required members to be of Sicilian or Southern Italian ancestry, Murder Inc. was a diverse ethnic gang that included Jews, Italians, and Irish killers.

Abbandando had become associated with Murder Inc. in the 1920s. By the early 1930s, he was reputed to have killed at least 30 people, mostly in Brooklyn, for a payment of about $500 per murder. In September 1931, Abbandando helped Buchalter and gang member Abe Reles eliminate the Shapiro Brothers, a rival outfit from the Lower East Side of Manhattan who controlled the garment industry in Brooklyn.

In 1937, Abbandando assisted in the murder of George Rudnick, a loan shark in Brooklyn. Reles had ordered Rudnick&#x27;s murder because he had received information that Rudnick was a police informant. Using an ice pick and a meat cleaver, Abbandando and several other gang members strangled Rudnick, stabbed him 63 times, and crushed his head inside a garage. No one was arrested for the crime. In February 1939, Abbandando and others killed mobster Felice Esposito. The contract was issued because he had been a prosecution witness in a mob murder trial 17 years earlier.

=== Trial and execution ===
By the 1940s, Murder, Inc. was severely weakened after the arrests and convictions of its leaders, like Buchalter and Jacob Shapiro, and top hitmen such as Charles &quot;The Bug&quot; Workman and Emanuel &quot;Mendy&quot; Weiss. Its downfall began in 1940 when Abe Reles turned state witness after being indicted for murder. His testimonies against fellow Murder, Inc. members soon led to the arrest of Abbandando for the murder of George Rudnick in 1937.

In May 1940, Abbandando was put on trial for murder along with co-defendants Harry &quot;Happy&quot; Maione and Harry &quot;Pittsburgh Phil&quot; Strauss. Abbandando was so confident that his allies would succeed in fixing the verdict, he even whispered a threat into the judge&#x27;s ear while he was on the witness stand. However, to his surprise, they were all convicted of Rudnick&#x27;s murder, but the verdicts were overturned on appeal.

In April 1941 Abbandando, along with Maione (Strauss had been convicted in September 1940 of killing Jewish mobster Irving Feinstein in 1939), went on trial a second time. This time he was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Abbandando spent the next nine months in Sing Sing Prison in Ossining, New York. On February 19, 1942, he was executed using &quot;Old Sparky,&quot; the electric chair at Sing Sing. In the moments up to his execution, Abbandando continued to mock and curse his guards. It was reported he displayed no fear and seemed to find a morbid humor in the proceedings.

A mass was said for him at Our Lady of Loretto Church in New York, where his brother Rocco assaulted a news photographer. He was buried in the family plot in St John&#x27;s Cemetery in Queens, New York City.

== Aftermath ==
After Abbandando&#x27;s conviction, six other members of Murder, Inc., including Buchalter and Maione, were convicted of murder and executed based on Reles&#x27; testimony. On November 12, 1941, while under police protection, Reles fell out a hotel window in Coney Island. The official ruling was that Reles died trying to climb down bedsheets to the street below. However, it was rumored that the &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; raised $100,000 to bribe Reles&#x27;s guards to shove him out the window.

With Buchalter&#x27;s death, Albert &quot;Lord High Executioner&quot; Anastasia, a made man in the &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot;, took over Murder, Inc. As a reaction to government informants in Murder, Inc., the New York crime families started using their members and associates, who were more easily controlled, to carry out murders. Murder, Inc. soon faded away.

== Personal life ==
Abbandando married Jennie DeLuca, a hairdresser from Ocean Hill, at his parents&#x27; urging, in September 1927. He had two sons, Lawrence and Frank Jr. Both became involved in organized crime.

Lawrence was born shortly after his parents&#x27; marriage on December 20, 1927. He became a mob associate. He died of cancer in North Miami Beach, Florida on March 25, 1995.

Lawrence&#x27;s younger brother, Frank Abbandando Jr., was born on October 17, 1935. He was a Gambino crime family associate. He was murdered in Florida on December 22, 1995. The 60-year old mobster was run over as he crossed Biscayne Boulevard in front of Party Girls, a run down strip club he frequented in North Miami Beach, by Rocco Napolitano, the brother of Aniello Napolitano, a small time drug dealer who might have been executed on the orders of Abbandando Jr.. After running him down, Napolitano fired several shots into Abbandando as he lay on the ground. Napolitano told police that he had shot him out of revenge for his brother. He was sentenced to life in prison. Abbandando Jr. was buried in Ocean Hill, Brooklyn.

<text>Lavocatia is a genus of extinct mammal from the Lower Cretaceous of Spain. It was a member of the also extinct order Multituberculata, and lived alongside of dinosaurs. Like most Mesozoic mammals, it was a shrewish-sized animal. It&#x27;s in the suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot; and family Pinheirodontidae. The genus &quot;Lavocatia&quot; was named by J. I. Canudo and G. Cuenca in 1996 based on a single tooth, with the generic name in honor of French paleontologist René Lavocat and the specific epithet a reference to the town of Alfambra.

The species &quot;Lavocatia alfambrensis&quot; is known from the Barremian-age Camarillas Formation of Galve, Spain. This genus is apparently differentiated by the number of cusps on the tooth; 15. Also referred to in the reference is Peramura. This was a more &quot;advanced&quot; group of mammals, possibly ancestral to ourselves (see &quot;Peramus&quot;).

<text>A nuclear power plant (NPP), also known as a nuclear power station (NPS), nuclear generating station (NGS) or atomic power station (APS) is a thermal power station in which the heat source is a nuclear reactor. As is typical of thermal power stations, heat is used to generate steam that drives a steam turbine connected to a generator that produces electricity. , the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that there were 410 nuclear power reactors in operation in 32 countries around the world, and 57 nuclear power reactors under construction.

Most nuclear power plants use thermal reactors with enriched uranium in a once-through fuel cycle. Fuel is removed when the percentage of neutron absorbing atoms becomes so large that a chain reaction can no longer be sustained, typically three years. It is then cooled for several years in on-site spent fuel pools before being transferred to long-term storage. The spent fuel, though low in volume, is high-level radioactive waste. While its radioactivity decreases exponentially, it must be isolated from the biosphere for hundreds of thousands of years, though newer technologies (like fast reactors) have the potential to significantly reduce this. Because the spent fuel is still mostly fissionable material, some countries (e.g. France and Russia) reprocess their spent fuel by extracting fissile and fertile elements for fabrication into new fuel, although this process is more expensive than producing new fuel from mined uranium. All reactors breed some plutonium-239, which is found in the spent fuel, and because Pu-239 is the preferred material for nuclear weapons, reprocessing is seen as a weapon proliferation risk.

Building a nuclear power plant often spans five to ten years, which can accrue significant financial costs, depending on how the initial investments are financed. Because of this high construction cost and lower operations, maintenance, and fuel costs, nuclear plants are usually used for base load generation, because this maximizes the hours over which the fixed cost of construction can be amortized. 

Nuclear power plants have a carbon footprint comparable to that of renewable energy such as solar farms and wind farms, and much lower than fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal. Nuclear power plants are among the safest modes of electricity generation, comparable to solar and wind power plants in terms of deaths from accidents and air pollution per terawatt-hour of electricity.

== History ==
The first time that heat from a nuclear reactor was used to generate electricity was on December 21, 1951, at the Experimental Breeder Reactor I, powering four light bulbs.

On June 27, 1954, the world&#x27;s first nuclear power station to generate electricity for a power grid, the Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant, commenced operations in Obninsk, in the Soviet Union.
The world&#x27;s first full scale power station, Calder Hall in the United Kingdom, opened on October 17, 1956 and was also meant to produce plutonium. The world&#x27;s first full scale power station solely devoted to electricity production was the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania, United States, which was connected to the grid on December 18, 1957.

=== Systems ===
The conversion to electrical energy takes place indirectly, as in conventional thermal power stations. The fission in a nuclear reactor heats the reactor coolant. The coolant may be water or gas, or even liquid metal, depending on the type of reactor. The reactor coolant then goes to a steam generator and heats water to produce steam. The pressurized steam is then usually fed to a multi-stage steam turbine. After the steam turbine has expanded and partially condensed the steam, the remaining vapor is condensed in a condenser. The condenser is a heat exchanger which is connected to a secondary side such as a river or a cooling tower. The water is then pumped back into the steam generator and the cycle begins again. The water-steam cycle corresponds to the Rankine cycle.

The nuclear reactor is the heart of the station. In its central part, the reactor&#x27;s core produces heat due to nuclear fission. With this heat, a coolant is heated as it is pumped through the reactor and thereby removes the energy from the reactor. The heat from nuclear fission is used to raise steam, which runs through turbines, which in turn power the electrical generators.

Nuclear reactors usually rely on uranium to fuel the chain reaction. Uranium is a very heavy metal that is abundant on Earth and is found in sea water as well as most rocks. Naturally occurring uranium is found in two different isotopes: uranium-238 (U-238), accounting for 99.3% and uranium-235 (U-235) accounting for about 0.7%. U-238 has 146 neutrons and U-235 has 143 neutrons.

Different isotopes have different behaviors. For instance, U-235 is fissile which means that it is easily split and gives off a lot of energy making it ideal for nuclear energy. On the other hand, U-238 does not have that property despite it being the same element. Different isotopes also have different half-lives. U-238 has a longer half-life than U-235, so it takes longer to decay over time. This also means that U-238 is less radioactive than U-235.

Since nuclear fission creates radioactivity, the reactor core is surrounded by a protective shield. This containment absorbs radiation and prevents radioactive material from being released into the environment. In addition, many reactors are equipped with a dome of concrete to protect the reactor against both internal casualties and external impacts.
The purpose of the steam turbine is to convert the heat contained in steam into mechanical energy. The engine house with the steam turbine is usually structurally separated from the main reactor building. It is aligned so as to prevent debris from the destruction of a turbine in operation from flying towards the reactor.

In the case of a pressurized water reactor, the steam turbine is separated from the nuclear system. To detect a leak in the steam generator and thus the passage of radioactive water at an early stage, an activity meter is mounted to track the outlet steam of the steam generator. In contrast, boiling water reactors pass radioactive water through the steam turbine, so the turbine is kept as part of the radiologically controlled area of the nuclear power station.

The electric generator converts mechanical power supplied by the turbine into electrical power. Low-pole AC synchronous generators of high rated power are used. A cooling system removes heat from the reactor core and transports it to another area of the station, where the thermal energy can be harnessed to produce electricity or to do other useful work. Typically the hot coolant is used as a heat source for a boiler, and the pressurized steam from that drives one or more steam turbine driven electrical generators.

In the event of an emergency, safety valves can be used to prevent pipes from bursting or the reactor from exploding. The valves are designed so that they can derive all of the supplied flow rates with little increase in pressure. In the case of the BWR, the steam is directed into the suppression chamber and condenses there. The chambers on a heat exchanger are connected to the intermediate cooling circuit.

The main condenser is a large cross-flow shell and tube heat exchanger that takes wet vapor, a mixture of liquid water and steam at saturation conditions, from the turbine-generator exhaust and condenses it back into sub-cooled liquid water so it can be pumped back to the reactor by the condensate and feedwater pumps.
In the main condenser, the wet vapor turbine exhaust come into contact with thousands of tubes that have much colder water flowing through them on the other side. The cooling water typically come from a natural body of water such as a river or lake. 
Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, located in the desert about west of Phoenix, Arizona, is the only nuclear facility that does not use a natural body of water for cooling, instead it uses treated sewage from the greater Phoenix metropolitan area. 
The water coming from the cooling body of water is either pumped back to the water source at a warmer temperature or returns to a cooling tower where it either cools for more uses or evaporates into water vapor that rises out the top of the tower.

The water level in the steam generator and the nuclear reactor is controlled using the feedwater system. The feedwater pump has the task of taking the water from the condensate system, increasing the pressure and forcing it into either the steam generators—in the case of a pressurized water reactor — or directly into the reactor, for boiling water reactors.

Continuous power supply to the plant is critical to ensure safe operation. Most nuclear stations require at least two distinct sources of offsite power for redundancy. These are usually provided by multiple transformers that are sufficiently separated and can receive power from multiple transmission lines. In addition, in some nuclear stations, the turbine generator can power the station&#x27;s loads while the station is online, without requiring external power. This is achieved via station service transformers which tap power from the generator output before they reach the step-up transformer.

== World operating status ==
Nuclear power plants generate approximately 10% of global electricity, sourced from around 440 reactors worldwide. They are recognized as a significant provider of low-carbon electricity, accounting for about one-quarter of the world&#x27;s supply in this category. As of 2020, nuclear power stood as the second-largest source of low-carbon energy, making up 26% of the total. Nuclear power facilities are active in 32 countries or regions, and their influence extends beyond these nations through regional transmission grids, especially in Europe.

In 2022, nuclear power plants generated 2545 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, a slight decrease from the 2653 TWh produced in 2021. Thirteen countries generated at least one-quarter of their electricity from nuclear sources. Notably, France relies on nuclear energy for about 70% of its electricity needs, while Ukraine, Slovakia, Belgium, and Hungary source around half their power from nuclear. Japan, which previously depended on nuclear for over a quarter of its electricity, is anticipated to resume similar levels of nuclear energy utilization.

Over the last 15 years, the United States has seen a significant improvement in the operational performance of its nuclear power plants, enhancing their utilization and efficiency, adding the output equivalent to 19 new 1000 MWe reactors without actual construction. In France, nuclear power plants still produce over sixty percent of this country&#x27;s total power generation in 2022. While a previous goal aimed to reduce nuclear electricity generation share to lower than fifty percent by 2025, this target was postponed to 2035 in 2019 and ultimately discarded in 2023. Russia continues to export the most nuclear power plants in the world, with projects across various countries: as of July 2023, Russia was constructing 19 out of 22 reactors constructed by foreign vendors; however, some exporting projects were canceled due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, China continues to advance in nuclear energy: having 25 reactors under construction by late 2023, China is the country with the most reactors being built at one time in the world.

=== Decommissioning ===
Nuclear decommissioning is the dismantling of a nuclear power station and decontamination of the site to a state no longer requiring protection from radiation for the general public. The main difference from the dismantling of other power stations is the presence of radioactive material that requires special precautions to remove and safely relocate to a waste repository.

Decommissioning involves many administrative and technical actions. It includes all clean-up of radioactivity and progressive demolition of the station. Once a facility is decommissioned, there should no longer be any danger of a radioactive accident or to any persons visiting it. After a facility has been completely decommissioned it is released from regulatory control, and the licensee of the station no longer has responsibility for its nuclear safety.

==== Timing and deferral of decommissioning ====
Generally speaking, nuclear stations were originally designed for a life of about 30 years. Newer stations are designed for a 40 to 60-year operating life. The Centurion Reactor is a future class of nuclear reactor that is being designed to last 100 years.

One of the major limiting wear factors is the deterioration of the reactor&#x27;s pressure vessel under the action of neutron bombardment, however in 2018 Rosatom announced it had developed a thermal annealing technique for reactor pressure vessels which ameliorates radiation damage and extends service life by between 15 and 30 years.

=== Flexibility ===
Nuclear stations are used primarily for base load because of economic considerations. The fuel cost of operations for a nuclear station is smaller than the fuel cost for operation of coal or gas plants. Since most of the cost of nuclear power plants is capital cost, there is almost no cost saved by running it at less than full capacity.

Nuclear power plants are routinely used in load following mode on a large scale in France, although &quot;it is generally accepted that this is not an ideal economic situation for nuclear stations&quot;. Unit A at the now decommissioned German Biblis Nuclear Power Plant was designed to modulate its output 15% per minute between 40% and 100% of its nominal power.

Russia has led in the practical development of floating nuclear power stations, which can be transported to the desired location and occasionally relocated or moved for easier decommissioning. In 2022, the United States Department of Energy funded a three-year research study of offshore floating nuclear power generation. In October 2022, NuScale Power and Canadian company Prodigy announced a joint project to bring a North American small modular reactor based floating plant to market.

== Economics ==

The economics of nuclear power plants is a controversial subject, and multibillion-dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source. Nuclear power stations typically have high capital costs, but low direct fuel costs, with the costs of fuel extraction, processing, use and spent fuel storage internalized costs. Therefore, comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear stations. Cost estimates take into account station decommissioning and nuclear waste storage or recycling costs in the United States due to the Price Anderson Act.

With the prospect that all spent nuclear fuel could potentially be recycled by using future reactors, generation IV reactors are being designed to completely close the nuclear fuel cycle. However, up to now, there has not been any actual bulk recycling of waste from a NPP, and on-site temporary storage is still being used at almost all plant sites due to construction problems for deep geological repositories. Only Finland has an operating repository, therefore from a worldwide perspective, long-term waste storage costs are uncertain.
Construction, or capital cost aside, measures to mitigate global warming such as a carbon tax or carbon emissions trading, increasingly favor the economics of nuclear power. Further efficiencies are hoped to be achieved through more advanced reactor designs, Generation III reactors promise to be at least 17% more fuel efficient, and have lower capital costs, while Generation IV reactors promise further gains in fuel efficiency and significant reductions in nuclear waste.
In Eastern Europe, a number of long-established projects are struggling to find financing, notably Belene in Bulgaria and the additional reactors at Cernavodă in Romania, and some potential backers have pulled out. Where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure, this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects.

Analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties. To date all operating nuclear power stations were developed by state-owned or regulated utilities where many of the risks associated with construction costs, operating performance, fuel price, and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers. Many countries have now liberalized the electricity market where these risks and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered, are borne by station suppliers and operators rather than consumers, which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power stations.

Following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan, costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power stations, due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats. However many designs, such as the currently under construction AP1000, use passive nuclear safety cooling systems, unlike those of Fukushima I which required active cooling systems, which largely eliminates the need to spend more on redundant back up safety equipment.

According to the World Nuclear Association, as of March 2020:

* Nuclear power is cost competitive with other forms of electricity generation, except where there is direct access to low-cost fossil fuels.
* Fuel costs for nuclear plants are a minor proportion of total generating costs, though capital costs are greater than those for coal-fired plants and much greater than those for gas-fired plants.
* System costs for nuclear power (as well as coal and gas-fired generation) are very much lower than for intermittent renewables.
* Providing incentives for long-term, high-capital investment in deregulated markets driven by short-term price signals presents a challenge in securing a diversified and reliable electricity supply system.
* In assessing the economics of nuclear power, decommissioning and waste disposal costs are fully taken into account.
* Nuclear power plant construction is typical of large infrastructure projects around the world, whose costs and delivery challenges tend to be under-estimated.
The Russian state nuclear company Rosatom is the largest player in international nuclear power market, building nuclear plants around the world. Whereas Russian oil and gas were subject to international sanctions after the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Rosatom was not targeted by sanctions. However, some countries, especially in Europe, scaled back or cancelled planned nuclear power plants that were to be built by Rosatom.

== Safety and security ==

Modern nuclear reactor designs have had numerous safety improvements since the first-generation nuclear reactors. A nuclear power plant cannot explode like a nuclear weapon because the fuel for uranium reactors is not enriched enough, and nuclear weapons require precision explosives to force fuel into a small enough volume to become supercritical. Most reactors require continuous temperature control to prevent a core meltdown, which has occurred on a few occasions through accident or natural disaster, releasing radiation and making the surrounding area uninhabitable. Plants must be defended against theft of nuclear material and attack by enemy military planes or missiles.

The most serious accidents to date have been the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, and the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, corresponding to the beginning of the operation of generation II reactors.

Professor of sociology Charles Perrow states that multiple and unexpected failures are built into society&#x27;s complex and tightly coupled nuclear reactor systems. Such accidents are unavoidable and cannot be designed around. An interdisciplinary team from MIT has estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005 to 2055, at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period. The MIT study does not take into account improvements in safety since 1970.

== Regulation and oversight ==
Nuclear power works under an insurance framework that limits or structures accident liabilities in accordance with the Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy, the Brussels supplementary convention, and the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage.
However states with a majority of the world&#x27;s nuclear power stations, including the U.S., Russia, China and Japan, are not party to international nuclear liability conventions.

;United States: In the United States, insurance for nuclear or radiological incidents is covered (for facilities licensed through 2025) by the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act.

;United Kingdom: Under the energy policy of the United Kingdom through its 1965 Nuclear Installations Act, liability is governed for nuclear damage for which a UK nuclear licensee is responsible. The Act requires compensation to be paid for damage up to a limit of £150 million by the liable operator for ten years after the incident. Between ten and thirty years afterwards, the Government meets this obligation. The Government is also liable for additional limited cross-border liability (about £300 million) under international conventions (Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy and Brussels Convention supplementary to the Paris Convention).

==Controversy==
The nuclear power debate about the deployment and use of nuclear fission reactors to generate electricity from nuclear fuel for civilian purposes peaked during the 1970s and 1980s, when it &quot;reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies,&quot; in some countries.

Proponents argue that nuclear power is a sustainable energy source which reduces carbon emissions and can increase energy security if its use supplants a dependence on imported fuels. Proponents advance the notion that nuclear power produces virtually no air pollution, in contrast to the chief viable alternative of fossil fuel. Proponents also believe that nuclear power is the only viable course to achieve energy independence for most Western countries. They emphasize that the risks of storing waste are small and can be further reduced by using the latest technology in newer reactors, and the operational safety record in the Western world is excellent when compared to the other major kinds of power plants.

Opponents say that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment, and that costs do not justify benefits. Threats include health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation or sabotage, and the problem of radioactive nuclear waste. Another environmental issue is discharge of hot water into the sea. The hot water modifies the environmental conditions for marine flora and fauna. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong, and there have been many serious nuclear accidents. Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology, despite rapid advancements in containment procedures and storage methods.

Opponents argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source despite the possibility of refinement and long-term storage being powered by a nuclear facility. Those countries that do not contain uranium mines cannot achieve energy independence through existing nuclear power technologies. Actual construction costs often exceed estimates, and spent fuel management costs are difficult to define.

On 1 August 2020, the UAE launched the Arab region&#x27;s first-ever nuclear energy plant. Unit 1 of the Barakah plant in the Al Dhafrah region of Abu Dhabi commenced generating heat on the first day of its launch, while the remaining 3 Units are being built. However, Nuclear Consulting Group head, Paul Dorfman, warned the Gulf nation&#x27;s investment into the plant as a risk &quot;further destabilizing the volatile Gulf region, damaging the environment and raising the possibility of nuclear proliferation.&quot;

== Environmental impact ==

Nuclear power plants do not produce greenhouse gases during operation. Older nuclear power plants, like ones using second-generation reactors, produce approximately the same amount of carbon dioxide during the whole life cycle of nuclear power plants for an average of about 11g/kWh, as much power generated by wind, which is about 1/3 of solar and 1/45 of natural gas and 1/75 of coal. Newer models, like HPR1000, produce even less carbon dioxide during the whole operating life, as little as 1/8 of power plants using gen II reactors for 1.31g/kWh.

However, there are other environmental impacts for nuclear power plants, such as radioactive waste, ionizing radiation, and waste heat. Large-scale atomic power plants might emit waste heat into natural bodies of water, affecting waterborne organisms. Mining nuclear fuel, including uranium or thorium, might negatively influence the environment near the mining site. Although the current method of disposing of nuclear waste from nuclear power plants in deep burials is generally considered safe, accidents during the transportation of nuclear waste can still result in the leakage of nuclear contaminants.

Large-scale nuclear accidents, like Chernobyl or Fukushima, release large quantities of radioactive material into nature, harming creatures and people. Solutions include enhanced regulatory and operational training, reducing radioactivity to surface organisms by deep burial or other treatment of radioactive contaminants at the accident site and creating permanent exclusion zones.

== Future development ==

=== Ongoing projects ===
As for March 2024, there are approximately 60 nuclear reactors for power plants being built worldwide, with a total capacity of 64GW, with an additional 110 in the planning stages. The majority of these reactors, either under construction or planned, are located in Asia. In recent years, the commissioning of new reactors has been roughly offset by the decommissioning of older ones. Over the last two decades, while 100 reactors began operations, 107 were retired.

=== Next generation nuclear power plant ===

An international coalition is advancing research and development on six Generation IV nuclear reactor technologies. The Generation IV International Forum (GIF), initiated by the US Department of Energy in 2000 and formally established in 2001, is a collaborative platform for 13 countries where nuclear energy is significant or crucial for future energy needs. This collective, which includes founding members like Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Japan, South Korea, South Africa, the UK, and the USA, along with newer members like Switzerland, China, Russia, Australia, and the European Union through Euratom, focuses on sharing research and development insights rather than constructing reactors, aiming to set multinational regulatory standards for these next-generation nuclear technologies.

In 2002, GIF selected six reactor technologies after two years of reviewing about 100 concepts, representing the future of nuclear energy. Among these six designs, three of them are fast neutron reactors, all operating at higher temperatures than current models. These reactors are designed to be more sustainable, economical, safe, and reliable, and also to resist nuclear proliferation. Four designs have been thoroughly tested in design aspects, providing a basis for further research and potential commercial operation before 2030. 

The world&#x27;s first and only nuclear power plant that put Gen IV reactors into commercial use is Shidao Bay Nuclear Power Plant. The reactor is a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor, started its building process on September 21 2014, started to generate power December 20, 2021, and was put into commercial operation in December 12, 2023.

=== Fusion Power Plant ===

Another developing direction for nuclear power plants is nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion and plasma physics research has made significant strides, with over 50 countries contributing to the field and recently achieving the first-ever scientific energy gain in a fusion experiment. Various designs and methodologies are being explored, including magnet-based machines like stellarators and tokamaks, as well as laser, linear device, and advanced fuel approaches; the timeline for the successful deployment of fusion energy hinges on global collaboration, the pace of industry development, and the establishment of the necessary nuclear infrastructure to support this future energy source.

The assembly of ITER, the largest international fusion facility, began in 2020 in France, marking a crucial step toward demonstrating fusion energy&#x27;s viability. With experiments set to start in the latter half of this decade and full-power experiments slated for 2036, ITER aims to pave the way for DEMO power plants, which experts believe could be operational by 2050. Concurrently, private ventures are leveraging decades of publicly funded research to advance fusion technology, suggesting that commercial fusion power could become a reality even before the mid-21st century. Many countries involving the ITER project are also developing their own fusion reactor and power plants models. In China, researchers are developing a new reactor called China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) aimed to build a commercial practical fusion power plant by 2050.

<text>Shiatsu ( ; ) is a form of Japanese bodywork based on concepts in traditional Chinese medicine such as qi meridians. Having been popularized in the twentieth century by Tokujiro Namikoshi (1905–2000), &quot;shiatsu&quot; derives from the older Japanese massage modality called &quot;anma&quot;.

There is no scientific evidence that &quot;shiatsu&quot; will prevent or cure any disease. Although it is considered a generally safe treatment—if sometimes painful—there have been reports of adverse health effects arising from its use, a few of them serious.

== Description ==
In the Japanese language, &quot;shiatsu&quot; means &quot;finger pressure&quot;. &quot;Shiatsu&quot; techniques include massages with fingers, thumbs, elbows, knuckles, feet and palms; acupressure, assisted stretching; and joint manipulation and mobilization. To examine a patient, a shiatsu practitioner uses palpation and, sometimes, pulse diagnosis.

The Japanese Ministry of Health defines &quot;shiatsu&quot; as &quot;a form of manipulation by thumbs, fingers and palms without the use of instruments, mechanical or otherwise, to apply pressure to the human skin to correct internal malfunctions, promote and maintain health, and treat specific diseases. The techniques used in &quot;shiatsu&quot; include stretching, holding, and most commonly, leaning body weight into various points along key channels.&quot;

The practice of &quot;shiatsu&quot; is based on the traditional Chinese concept of &quot;qi&quot;, which is sometimes described as an &quot;energy flow&quot;. &quot;Qi&quot; is supposedly channeled through certain pathways in the human body, known as meridians, causing a variety of effects. Despite the fact that many practitioners use these ideas in explaining &quot;shiatsu&quot;, neither &quot;qi&quot; nor meridians exist as observable phenomena.

== Efficacy ==
There is no evidence that &quot;shiatsu&quot; is of any benefit in treating cancer or any other disease, though some evidence suggests it might help people feel more relaxed. In 2015, the Australian Government&#x27;s Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance; &quot;shiatsu&quot; was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. Accordingly, in 2017, the Australian government named &quot;shiatsu&quot; as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, to ensure the best use of insurance funds.

&quot;Shiatsu&quot;&#x27;s claims of having a positive impact on a recipient&#x27;s sense of vitality and well-being have to some extent been supported by studies where recipients reported improved relaxation, sleep, and lessened symptom severity. However, the state of the evidence on its efficacy for treating any malady is poor, and one recent systematic review did not find &quot;shiatsu&quot; to be effective for any particular health condition. It is generally considered safe, though some studies have reported negative effects after a treatment with &quot;shiatsu&quot;, and examples of serious health complications exist including one case of thrombosis, one embolism, and a documented injury from a &quot;shiatsu-type massaging machine&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Shiatsu&quot; evolved from &quot;anma&quot;, a Japanese style of massage developed in 1320 by Akashi Kan Ichi. Anma was popularised in the seventeenth century by acupuncturist Sugiyama Waichi, and around the same time the first books on the subject, including Fujibayashi Ryohaku&#x27;s &quot;Anma Tebiki&quot; (&quot;Manual of Anma&quot;), appeared.

The Fujibayashi school carried anma into the modern age. Prior to the emergence of &quot;shiatsu&quot; in Japan, masseurs were often nomadic, earning their keep in mobile massage capacities, and paying commissions to their referrers.

Since Sugiyama&#x27;s time, massage in Japan had been strongly associated with the blind. Sugiyama, blind himself, established a number of medical schools for the blind which taught this practice. During the Tokugawa period, edicts were passed which made the practice of anma solely the preserve of the blind – sighted people were prohibited from practicing the art. As a result, the &quot;blind anma&quot; has become a popular trope in Japanese culture. This has continued into the modern era, with a large proportion of the Japanese blind community continuing to work in the profession.

Abdominal palpation as a Japanese diagnostic technique was developed by Shinsai Ota in the 17th century.

During the Occupation of Japan by the Allies after World War II, traditional medicine practices were banned (along with other aspects of traditional Japanese culture) by General MacArthur. The ban prevented a large proportion of Japan&#x27;s blind community from earning a living. Many Japanese entreated for this ban to be rescinded. Additionally, writer and advocate for blind rights Helen Keller, on being made aware of the prohibition, interceded with the United States government; at her urging, the ban was rescinded.

Tokujiro Namikoshi (1905–2000) founded his &quot;shiatsu&quot; college in the 1940s and his legacy was the state recognition of &quot;shiatsu&quot; as an independent method of treatment in Japan. He is often credited with inventing modern &quot;shiatsu&quot;. However, the term &quot;shiatsu&quot; was already in use in 1919, when a book called &quot;Shiatsu Ho&quot; (&quot;finger pressure method&quot;) was published by Tamai Tempaku. Also prior to Namikoshi&#x27;s system, in 1925 the Shiatsu Therapists Association was founded, with the purpose of distancing &quot;shiatsu&quot; from &quot;anma&quot; massage.

Namikoshi&#x27;s school taught &quot;shiatsu&quot; within a framework of western medical science. A student and teacher of Namikoshi&#x27;s school, Shizuto Masunaga, brought to &quot;shiatsu&quot; a traditional eastern medicine and philosophic framework. Masunaga grew up in a family of &quot;shiatsu&quot; practitioners, with his mother having studied with Tamai Tempaku. He founded Zen Shiatsu and the Iokai Shiatsu Center school. Another student of Namikoshi, Hiroshi Nozaki founded the Hiron Shiatsu, a holistic technique of &quot;shiatsu&quot; that uses intuitive techniques and a spiritual approach to healing which identifies ways how to take responsibility for a healthy and happy life in the practitioner&#x27;s own hands. It is practiced mainly in Switzerland, France and Italy, where its founder opened several schools.

<doc id="207349" wikidata="Q483924" url="?curid=207349" title="The Chosun Ilbo">
<text>The Chosun Ilbo (, ), also known as &quot;The Chosun Daily,&quot; is a Korean-language newspaper of record for South Korea and among the oldest active newspapers in the country. With a daily circulation of more than 1,800,000, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Chosun Ilbo&quot; has been audited annually since the Audit Bureau of Circulations was established in 1993. &quot;The&quot; &quot;Chosun Ilbo&quot; and its subsidiary company, Digital Chosun, operate the &quot;Chosun.com&quot; news website, which also publishes news in English, Chinese, and Japanese.

==History==
The Chosun Ilbo Establishment Union was created in September 1919. &quot;The&quot; &quot;Chosun Ilbo&quot; newspaper was founded on 5 March 1920 by Sin Sogu with the financial support of the Daejong Business Association. Cho Jin-Tae, the vice-chairman of the Daejong Business Association was appointed the first President of the newspaper in 1920. However, as the Business Association failed to pay promised finances, the relationship between the Association and &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot; broke down five months after its founding, and Cho Jin-Tae was replaced by Yoo Moon-Hwan on 15 August 1920.

On 6 April 1921, after only a year of publishing, &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot; went on hiatus due to financial troubles.

On 31 July 1940, the newspaper published &quot;Lessons of American Realism&quot;, the fourth part of an editorial series. Ten days later – following issue 6,923 – the paper was declared officially discontinued by the Japanese ruling government. In the twenty years since its founding, the paper had been suspended by the Japanese government four times, and its issues confiscated over five hundred times before 1932.

When Korea gained independence in 1945, &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot; resumed publication after a five-year, three-month hiatus.

On 1 March 1999, &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot; announced that starting the following day (2 March 1999), it would be switching to the horizontal left-to-right writing style already adopted by most other newspapers by the time, ahead of the paper&#x27;s 79th anniversary. It also made a commitment to preserve and continue using &quot;hanja&quot; characters despite the change. Consequently, the 1 March 1999 issue (Issue No. 24305) became the last issue of &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot; written in the vertical right-to-left style and the last mainstream Korean paper that published in the style. All issues since 2 March 1999 have been in the modern horizontal left-to-right style.

== Subsidiaries ==
Besides the daily newspaper, the company also publishes the &quot;Weekly Chosun&quot;, the &quot;Monthly Chosun&quot;, &quot;Digital Chosun&quot;, &quot;Edu-Chosun&quot;, and &quot;ChosunBiz&quot;.

==Controversies==

&quot;The&quot; &quot;Chosun Ilbo&quot; has historically taken a hardline stance against North Korea. For example, it opposed South Korean President Kim Dae-jung&#x27;s Sunshine Policy, aimed at engaging North Korea through cooperation, mitigating the gap in economic power and restoring lost communication between the two Koreas. For this reason, the newspaper has attracted heavy criticism and threats from the North.

On 6 April 2019, Deutsche Welle described &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot; as &quot;an outlet notorious for its dubious and politically motivated&quot; reporting on North Korea.

On 31 May 2019, the newspaper reported that, based on &quot;an unidentified source&quot;, the head diplomat of North Korea&#x27;s nuclear envoy Kim Hyok-chol, had been executed by a North Korean Government firing squad. However, two days later, on 2 June 2019, the top diplomat was seen at a concert sitting a few seats away from North Korea&#x27;s leader Kim Jong Un.

The Educational Broadcasting System&#x27;s popular instructor Choi Tae-seong, sued a &quot;Chosun Ilbo&quot; reporter for publishing an article that defamed him as a supporter of North Korea.

&quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot; has been accused of being &quot;chinilbanminjokhaengwi&quot; (친일반민족행위, 親日反民族行爲, &quot;pro-Japanese anti-nationalist activist&quot;), because of controversy over its advocacy of the Korea under Japanese rule. In 2005, the South Korean government and Korean nationalist civic activists investigated whether Chosun Ilbo &#x27;collaborated&#x27; with the Japanese Empire. &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot; published articles described as excessively praising the Imperial House of Japan every year from 1938 to 1940. Until 1987, the newspaper had reported favorably on South Korea&#x27;s military dictatorships.

In 2002, the prosecution sought a sentence of seven years in prison and a fine of 12 billion won for &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot; chairman Bang Sang-hoon, who was indicted on charges of tax evasion and embezzlement. Chairman Bang was accused of evading 6.2 billion won in gift and corporate taxes, as well as embezzling 4.5 billion won in company funds. He was arrested in August of the previous year but was released on bail and has been on trial since. On June 29 2006, he was indicted for evading 2.35 billion won in gift taxes by transferring 65,000 shares of &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot; to his son through a nominal trust, and for misusing 2.57 billion won in company funds under the names of family members to increase capital in affiliates like Jogwang Publishing and Sports Chosun. The Supreme Court sentenced Chairman Bang to three years in prison with a four-year suspended sentence and a fine of 2.5 billion won for tax evasion and the misappropriation of company funds.

<text>John Morton-Finney (June 25, 1889 – January 28, 1998) was an American civil rights activist, lawyer, and educator who earned eleven academic degrees, including five law degrees. He spent most of his career as an educator and lawyer after serving from 1911 to 1914 in the U.S. Army as a member of the 24th Infantry Regiment, better known as the Buffalo soldiers, and with the American Expeditionary Forces in France during World War I. Morton-Finney taught languages at Fisk University in Tennessee and at Lincoln University in Missouri, before moving to Indianapolis, Indiana, where he taught in the Indianapolis Public Schools for forty-seven years. Morton-Finney was a member of the original faculty at Indianapolis&#x27;s Crispus Attucks High School when it opened in 1927 and later became head of its foreign language department. He also taught at Shortridge High School and at other IPS schools. Morton-Finney was admitted as a member of the Bar of the Indiana Supreme Court in 1935, as a member of the Bar of the U.S. District Court in 1941, and was admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1972.

When Morton-Finney retired from practicing law on June 25, 1996, his 107th birthday, he was believed to have been the oldest practicing attorney in the United States. At the time of his death in 1998 he was Indiana&#x27;s oldest veteran. Morton-Finney was honored with numerous honorary awards and certificates, including one from the Chief Justice of the United States in 1989, in addition to being commissioned a Kentucky Colonel (1991) from the Governor of Kentucky and named a recipient of a Sagamore of the Wabash award from the Governor of Indiana. He also received distinguished alumni and graduate awards from Indiana University and was inducted into the National Bar Association Hall of Fame (1991). In addition, the Indianapolis Bar Association and Butler University present awards named in his honor.

== Early life and family ==

Born Morton Finney on June 25, 1889, to a former slave father and a free mother, George and Maryatta &quot;Mattie&quot; (Gordon) Finney, in Uniontown, Kentucky, and was one of the family&#x27;s seven children. After the death of his mother in 1903, when John was fourteen, his father was unable to care for the children and sent them to live with their grandfather on his farm in Missouri.

Prior to his enlistment in the U.S. Army in 1911, Morton-Finney was enrolled at Lincoln College in Jefferson City, Missouri. After his return to the United States in 1914, Morton-Finney resumed his studies at Lincoln College, where he met and married Pauline Angeline Ray (November 19, 1889 – September 3, 1975) of Geneva, New York. Ray was a graduate of Cornell University and a French teacher at Lincoln College. The couple moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1922 and, later, had a daughter, Gloria Ann Morton-Finney. John and Pauline Morton-Finney were married for more than fifty-two years.

== Military service ==
Morton-Finney enrolled at Lincoln College in Missouri, but his education was interrupted by military service. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1911, becoming a member of the 24th U.S. Infantry Regiment (a regiment of African American soldiers, better known as Buffalo soldiers) and served in the Philippines. Morton-Finney was promoted to the ranks of corporal and sergeant, but was denied an officer&#x27;s commission due to racial discrimination. He received an honorable discharge and returned to the United States in 1914. Morton-Finney also served as an infantryman in the American Expeditionary Force in 1918 in France during World War I. During World War II, he was cited for directing the rationing tickets program for African Americans in Indianapolis.

== Education ==
Morton-Finney had a lifelong interest in education, earning eleven academic degrees in law, French, mathematics, and history. After his military service in the Philippines in 1914, he returned to Lincoln College in Missouri, where he resumed his education and met his wife, Pauline, who was also an educator at the college. His education was disrupted again with military service in 1918, this time serving in France during World War I, but continued following his return to the United States.

Morton-Finney earned a total of five law degrees, the first one from Lincoln College in 1935, followed by law degrees from Indiana Law School and Indiana University in 1944, IU&#x27;s School of Law in 1946, and Martin University in 1995. In addition, he earned master&#x27;s degrees from Indiana University in education (1925) and in French (1933), while at teaching at Crispus Attucks High School in Indianapolis. Morton-Finney also held undergraduate degrees from Lincoln Institute (1920), Iowa State University (1922), and Butler University (1965). Late in life he was awarded a Doctor of Letters (Litt.D.) from Lincoln University (1985), and received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree (L.H.D) from Butler University (1989). Morton-Finney was fluent in French, Latin, Greek, and Spanish, and conversant in German and Portuguese.

== Career ==
===Educator and administrator===
Morton-Finney taught languages at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, and at Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri, before moving to Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1922 to teach in the Indianapolis Public Schools. Morton-Finney spent forty-seven years as an IPS teacher and school administrator, beginning at Shortridge High School. He was one of the original faculty members hired for the new Crispus Attucks High School when it opened in 1927. (Attucks High School was the only public high school in Indianapolis designated specifically for African Americans.) Morton-Finney became head of Attucks&#x27;s foreign language department, taught Greek, Latin, German, Spanish, and French, and later taught at other IPS schools, including junior high mathematics and social studies. He also served as an IPS school principal. In addition, Morton-Finney taught life skills, invited presidents from black colleges to speak to the students, and helped students with college scholarships. In honor of his nearly five decades of service in the Indianapolis Public Schools, the school district&#x27;s downtown Center for Education Services building was renamed the Dr. John Morton-Finney Center for Educational Services.

===Lawyer===
In addition to his long career as an educator in the Indianapolis public schools, Morton-Finney practiced law in Indiana for many years. He was admitted as a member of the Bar of the Indiana Supreme Court in 1935 and as a member of the Bar of the U.S. District Court in 1941. At the age of 83, Morton-Finney was admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1972. He was inducted into the National Bar Association Hall of Fame in 1991. When Morton-Finney retired from practicing law at the age of 107, he was believed to have been the oldest practicing attorney in the United States.

==Later years==
Due to his African family&#x27;s ancestry, ninety-year-old Morton-Finney was crowned Adeniran I, Paramount Chief of Yoruba Descendants in Indiana during ceremonies held at The Children&#x27;s Museum of Indianapolis on August 31, 1979. Morton-Finney&#x27;s family ancestors migrated from Ethiopia to what is present-day Badagry, Nigeria, and became enslaved in America.

At the age of 96, Morton-Finney was awarded a Doctor of Letters (Litt.D.) from Lincoln University in 1985. He was also the recipient of an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree (L.H.D) from Butler University in 1989 at the age of 100.

==Death and legacy==
Morton-Finney died on January 28, 1998, at the age of 108. He was buried with full military honors at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana. At the time of his death, Morton-Finney was Indiana&#x27;s oldest veteran.

Morton-Finney was recognized during his lifetime for his public service contributions with honorary awards and certificates from Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court (June 9, 1989), the Indianapolis Public Schools (May 22, 1990), Harvard University, the Indianapolis City Council (1995), and the Mayor of Indianapolis, in addition to being commissioned a Kentucky Colonel (1991) by the Governor of Kentucky and receiving a Sagamore of the Wabash award from the Governor of Indiana. Morton-Finney also received distinguished alumni and graduate awards from Indiana University and was inducted into the National Bar Association Hall of Fame (1991). In recognition of his years as a legal professional the Indianapolis Bar Association presents awards to local lawyers for their leadership in legal education in Morton-Finney&#x27;s honor. Butler University presents an award in Morton-Finney&#x27;s honor to students who demonstrate leadership in promoting &quot;diversity and inclusion in their schools or communities.&quot;

<text>Marcel Mule (24 June 1901 – 18 December 2001) was a French classical saxophonist. He was known worldwide as one of the great classical saxophonists, and many pieces were written for him, premiered by him, and arranged by him. Many of these pieces have become staples in the classical saxophone repertoire. He is considered to be the founder of the French Saxophone School and the most representative saxophone soloist of his time, being a fundamental figure in the development of the instrument.

==Early life==

Marcel Mule was born in a village in Aube, France, to a father who learned the saxophone while doing his military service and became director of the brass band of Beaumont-le-Roger. In a time when Paris lacked saxophone teachers, having contact with brass bands was the only way to learn to play the saxophone. His father introduced him to the saxophone at the age of eight, in addition to violin and piano. He also taught him to play with a &quot;straight&quot; tone (no vibrato), which was the custom of the day.

Though Marcel exhibited the talent necessary to pursue a musical career, at a time when a musician&#x27;s life was not easy, Mule&#x27;s father recommended that he choose a teaching career instead. Thus, he enrolled in the École Normale at Évreux and received his diploma after three years. He taught for only six months in a school in town before he was called up for military service.

== In the &quot;Garde républicaine&quot; ==

The First World War brought Marcel to Paris to serve with the Fifth Infantry. It was there that he returned to music, playing in the regiment&#x27;s military band in 1921. It was also during his time in Paris that he continued his music studies in harmony, piano and violin.

It wasn&#x27;t until he concluded his military service that Marcel&#x27;s musical career took off. In 1923, he completed an exam to become a member of the Garde républicaine&#x27;s band, La Musique de la Garde Républicaine. It provided a regular income for him. He became known for his beautiful sound, and became the saxophone soloist in the Garde, which caused him to be asked to play in concerts with orchestras and also in the orchestra of the Opéra-Comique (although almost exclusively for Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot;, as this was the only opera in the repertoire that called for an orchestral saxophone). As Mule admits, in that time people liked his sound, though he played as other people did at that time, with a straight interiorised sound. It was during this period that he played frequently with modern dance bands, and where his exposure to American jazz bands, with their treatment of vibrato, inspired him to experiment with and develop his trademark classical saxophone vibrato.

In 1927, Mule formed a saxophone quartet along with members of the Garde, under the name of Quatuor de la Garde Républicaine. In its earliest stage (it was to last for some 40 years) there was no music for such groups. Mule transcribed the music of classical composers such as Albéniz (&quot;Sevilla&quot; from the &quot;Suite Española&quot; Op. 47) and Mozart. His new ensemble achieved critical acclaim early on. As a consequence, important composers of the day, including Gabriel Pierné, Florent Schmitt and Alexander Glazunov, contributed their own works to an ever-expanding repertoire for the instrument group. This influx of exciting new material proved essential for the establishment of the saxophone quartet as a viable, sustainable ensemble type.

== The Golden Age ==

In 1936, facing concerts abroad, Mule left the &quot;Garde&quot; and dedicated himself to performing and composing. The quartet changed its name to Quatuor de Saxophones de Paris, but later became referred to as simply the &quot;Quatuor Marcel Mule&quot;. The ensemble was heard in concerts and recitals throughout France, Belgium, Holland, England, Switzerland, Germany, Italy and North Africa. It was a period of intense effort, which enabled him to reveal the true nobility and musical potential of the saxophone.

In 1944, Claude Delvincourt, director of the Paris Conservatoire, allowed for the reestablishment of a saxophone class, an offering which had been abandoned with the departure of Adolphe Sax in 1870. Delvincourt entrusted the post to Marcel Mule, who was by then 43 years of age and highly respected in France and abroad. During his years at the Conservatoire, Mule taught over 300 students, many of whom went on to become famous saxophone performers and teachers in their own right.

In 1958, Mule&#x27;s career culminated as he embarked on a twelve concert tour of the United States with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Charles Münch. His program choice for the tour was Jacques Ibert&#x27;s &quot;Concertino da Camera&quot; for alto saxophone, and Henri Tomasi&#x27;s &quot;Ballade&quot;.

Writing about Mule&#x27;s tour with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, New York journalist Louis Leopold Biancolli (1907–1992) called Mule the &quot;Rubinstein of the saxophone&quot;. A few years earlier, a French journalist had dubbed Mule as the &quot;Paganini of the saxophone&quot;. In 1939, Alfred Frankenstein (1906–1981), music critic for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote, &quot;Marcel Mule is the Jascha Heifetz of the Saxophone&quot;.

== As a teacher ==

According to Mule, the quality of sound depends on four conditions:
* A firm but light embouchure.
* The precision and quality of emission.
* The mastery of breathing, necessary for the maintenance of the air column.
* The mastery of vibrato, the novelty of which depends on the quality of the expression.

Mule&#x27;s methodic teachings follow these guidelines:
* Breathing: The breath must be relaxed and through the mouth, using the diaphragm. This will allow the player to have a more confident and serene attitude when performing.
* The embouchure: An embouchure subjecting the mouthpiece with the lower lip on top of the lower teeth and the upper teeth. The embouchure must be firm but relaxed. The different registers of the saxophone must be produced with little variations of the oral cavity and throat.
* The tonguing: The tonguing must be produced using the syllable DA.
* The intonation: The saxophone is not a perfectly tuned instrument; this forces the instrumentalist to develop a very good ear for tuning. To vary the tuning, the player must use the throat and the tongue (positioning the tongue with different vowels), vary the pressure from the lower lip, vary the air pressure, and use corrective fingerings. 
* The vibrato: Mule had a clear idea from the beginning how the vibrato should be done, giving clear exercises and the right speed. The right speed is at 300 undulations per minute (i.e. 5 per second), which gives four undulations per crotchet at M.M. 80. The vibrato is accomplished with a movement of the jaw, which creates a variation of the pressure of the lower lip on the reed.
* , based on scales and arpeggios, including articulation.

All these methods are widely explained in his books. Mule gave to the saxophone history a very extensive amount of teaching material, incomparable to anything that existed previously.

== Study books produced by Mule ==
The books produced by Marcel Mule focused on the points mentioned above: technique (scales, arpeggios), articulation and tone production.
Some of the study books created by Marcel Mule are:
* &quot;24 Easy Studies for All Saxophones after A. Samie&quot;, Leduc. Alphonse Leduc, 1946, SS, 19 pages. Based on works by the French violinist A. Samie, and suitable for second and third year students with keys ranging to 3 sharps and 3 flats.
* &quot;30 Great Exercises or Studies (Trente Grands Exercices ou Études) for All Saxophones after Soussmann&quot; Book 1 and 2 by Marcel Mule. Alphonse Leduc, 1944, SS, 31 pages. These advanced pieces based on studies by the flautist Henri Soussmann are more exercises than etudes (many feature short phrases repeating through the range of the instruments and in different keys). Book 1 has 15 exercises starting in C and moving through the circle of fifths in major and minor sharp keys.
* &quot;48 Studies by Ferling for All Saxophones&quot; by Marcel Mule. Alphonse Leduc, 1946, SS, 30 pages. In addition to editing the 48 studies by Franz Wilhelm Ferling for oboe, Professor Mule has written an additional 12 studies in major and minor keys. (Ferling did not include the enharmonic keys of C flat major, A flat minor, etc. in his work.)
* &quot;53 Studies for All Saxophones&quot; Book 1, 2 and 3 by Marcel Mule. Alphonse Leduc, SS, 1946, 27 pages. After Theobald Boehm, Adolf Terschak and Anton Bernhard Fürstenau.
* &quot;Daily Exercises (Exercices Journaliers) for All Saxophones after Terschak&quot; by Marcel Mule. Alphonse Leduc, 1944, SS, 37 pages. Twenty-six technical exercises based on the works of the flautist Adolf Terschak for better intermediate and advanced students. Keys range from 7 sharps to 5 flats.
* &quot;Scales and Arpeggios, Fundamental Exercises for the Saxophone&quot; Book 1, 2 and 3 by Marcel Mule. Alphonse Leduc, SS, 1948, 30 pages. This book includes scales, scales in thirds, arpeggios, arpeggios on the dominant seventh chord in all major and minor keys. Instructions are in French, English, German, Spanish and Japanese.
* &quot;Varied Studies (Études Variées) in All Keys&quot; adapted by Marcel Mule. Alphonse Leduc, 1950, SS, 31 pages. Thirty etudes by various composers (Jakob Dont, Rodolphe Kreutzer, Jacques Mazas, Niccolò Paganini, Pierre Rode, etc.) at the advanced intermediate level.
* &quot;18 Exercices ou Études d&#x27;après Berbiguier&quot;, by M. Mule, Leduc (based on studies by the French flautist Benoit Tranquille Berbiguier)
* &quot;Pièces Célèbres&quot; Volume 1, 2 and 3, by M. Mule, Leduc
* &quot;Tablature de la gamme chromatique&quot;, by M. Mule, Leduc

==Retirement ==
In 1967, Marcel Mule retired to a villa near the Mediterranean, with his saxophone, though he never played it again. As he said, it was time to let the new generations make their way through.

On 24 June 2001, all his many friends and alumni met with him to celebrate his centenary. There were Guy Lacour, who was formerly tenor saxophone in the Quatuor, Michel Nouaux, Jean Ledieu, Jacques Person, Jean-Marie Londeix and others from France, but also from Spain, Canada and the United States. In October 2001, the Faculty of Music of the University of Laval (Canada) paid an enthusiastic homage to the Master.

A little over a month after the Laval visit, Marcel Mule died in his sleep at the age of 100.

== Legacy ==
Marcel Mule is universally recognized as a modern master of the classical saxophone and a spiritual heir to Adolphe Sax. His labours as arranger and transcriber became central to the development of the repertoire for the instrument. His influence attracted the attention of some of the most important composers of the day, including Darius Milhaud, Arthur Honegger and Florent Schmitt, whose new works consequently included the saxophone among their forces. Many of the most important figures in classical saxophone history have been Mule&#x27;s disciples, including Frederick Hemke, Jean-Marie Londeix, Eugene Rousseau, Daniel Deffayet (who succeeded Mule at the Paris Conservatoire in 1968) and Claude Delangle (who succeeded Deffayet in 1988).

Marcel Mule&#x27;s virtuosity in performance was combined with a capability to extract concepts from the playing and explain them to other people. In short, apart from being a fine performer, Mule was an extraordinary teacher who was able to relate his methods most effectively. His depth of character, warmth and enthusiasm earned the affection and respect of his colleagues and students while making inestimable contributions in establishing the saxophone as a viable voice for musical expression.

== Recordings ==
Mule made many recordings over the course of his career, mostly on 78RPM and 33RPM records. Notable ones include:

* His LP issued in the 1930s (&quot;Marcel Mule - &#x27;Le Patron&#x27; of the Saxophone&quot;) on the Clarinet Classics label, numbered &quot;CCOO13&quot;, which aroused worldwide interest in the art of classical saxophone.
* His rendition of Jacques Ibert&#x27;s &quot;Concertino da camera&quot;, recorded in 1947.

<doc id="207352" wikidata="Q334984" url="?curid=207352" title="John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort">
<text>Field Marshal John Standish Surtees Prendergast Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort, (10 July 1886 – 31 March 1946) was a senior British Army officer. As a young officer during the First World War, he was decorated with the Victoria Cross for his actions during the Battle of the Canal du Nord. During the 1930s he served as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (the professional head of the British Army). He is best known for commanding the British Expeditionary Force that was sent to France in the first year of the Second World War, only to be evacuated from Dunkirk the following year. Gort later served as Governor of Gibraltar and Malta, and High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan.

==Early life ==
Vereker was born in London. His mother was Eleanor, Viscountess Gort née Surtees (1857–1933; later Eleanor Benson), who was a daughter of the writer Robert Smith Surtees. Vereker&#x27;s father was John Gage Prendergast Vereker, 5th Viscount Gort (1849–1902).

J. S. S. P. Vereker grew up in County Durham and the Isle of Wight. He was educated at Malvern Link Preparatory School, Harrow School, 
and entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in January 1904. As Viscount Gort, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards on 16 August 1905, and promoted to lieutenant on 1 April 1907.

In November 1908, Gort visited his uncle, Jeffrey Edward Prendergast Vereker, a retired British army major, who was living in Canada, at Kenora, Ontario. During a moose hunting trip, Gort slipped off a large boulder, causing his rifle to discharge; the bullet injured a local guide, William Prettie, who later died of his wound in Winnipeg. Gort returned immediately to England. While studying at Trinity College, Cambridge he was initiated into Isaac Newton University Lodge.

Gort commanded the detachment of Grenadier Guards that bore the coffin at the funeral of King Edward VII in May 1910. He was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order in June 1910.

==First World War==
On 5 August 1914, Gort was promoted to captain. He went to France with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and fought on the Western Front, taking part in the retreat from Mons in August 1914. He became a staff officer with the First Army in December 1914 and then very briefly served as a general staff officer, grade 3 (GSO3) in February 1915 before he became brigade major of the 4th (Guards) Brigade, commanded then by Brigadier General The Earl of Cavan, a future field marshal, in April 1915. He was awarded the Military Cross in June 1915. Promoted to the brevet rank of major in June 1916, he became a staff officer at the headquarters of the BEF and fought at the Battle of the Somme throughout the autumn of 1916. He was given the acting rank of lieutenant colonel in April 1917 on appointment as Commanding Officer of 4th Battalion, Grenadier Guards and, having been awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in June 1917, he led his battalion at the Battle of Passchendaele, earning a Bar to his DSO in September 1917. The bar&#x27;s citation reads:

On 27 November 1918, sixteen days after the war came to an end, Gort was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, for his actions on 27 September 1918 at the Battle of the Canal du Nord, near Flesquieres, France.

Victoria Cross citation

Subsequent to this he became known as &quot;Tiger&quot; Gort. He won a second Bar to his DSO in January 1919, with the citation reading:

He was also mentioned in despatches eight times during the war.

==Inter-war years==
Gort was promoted to the substantive rank of major on 21 October 1919. He studied at the Staff College, Camberley, was posted Headquarters London District in 1919 and, having been promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel on 1 January 1921, he was posted back to the College as an instructor. He left the Staff College in May 1923.

Promoted to colonel in April 1926 (with seniority backdated to 1 January 1925), he became a staff officer at London District in 1926 and then became a chief instructor at the Senior Officers&#x27; School at Sheerness. After being posted to Shanghai in January 1927, he gave a report of his findings to the King and the Prince of Wales. He returned home to be a staff officer at Headquarters 4th Infantry Division at Colchester in July 1927.

In June 1928, Gort was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He was appointed commander of the Guards Brigade in 1930, and, after being placed on half-pay in July 1932, officer in command of military training in India with the temporary rank of brigadier in 1932. 

After acquiring a de Havilland Moth aircraft named &quot;Henrietta&quot; in 1930, Gort became chairman of the Household Brigade Flying Club. On 25 November 1935, he was promoted, at the relatively young age (in peacetime, where promotion was painfully slow) of 49, to major-general. He returned to the Staff College in 1936 as its Commandant.

In May 1937, Gort was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. In September 1937, he became Military Secretary to the War Minister, Leslie Hore-Belisha, with the temporary rank of lieutenant-general. On 6 December 1937, as part of a purge by Hore-Belisha of senior officers, Gort was appointed to the Army Council, made a general and replaced Field Marshal Sir Cyril Deverell as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS). On 1 January 1938, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. His appointment was generally well received in the army, although there was some resentment in his having passed over a number of much older and more senior officers, among them John Dill, Archibald Wavell and Alan Brooke, who would later become an outspoken critic of Gort. He was not especially highly regarded for his intelligence and so Major General Ronald Adam was appointed to be Gort&#x27;s Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff.

On 2 December 1938 Gort submitted a report on the readiness of the British Army. He observed that Nazi Germany, as a result of the acquisition of Czechoslovakia, was in a stronger position than the previous year and that as a result of the government&#x27;s decision in 1937 to create a &quot;general purpose&quot; army, Britain lacked the necessary forces for the defence of France.

On 21 December Gort recommended to the Chiefs of Staff that Britain would need to help France defend the Netherlands and Belgium, and that for that purpose the British Army needed complete equipment for four Regular army infantry divisions and two mobile armoured divisions, with the Territorial army armed with training equipment and then war equipment for four divisions. In response, the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Roger Backhouse, noted that such a commitment would be substantial. Gort also attacked as a fallacy the theory of strategic mobility by the use of seapower because in modern war land transport was faster and cheaper than transport by sea. The experience of David Lloyd George&#x27;s 1917 Alexandretta project &quot;proved that [maritime side-shows] invariably led to vast commitments out of all proportion to the value of the object attained&quot;. If a purely defensive position was taken the Maginot Line would be broken, and the British Army (with anti-aircraft defence) was only getting £277 million out of a total £2,000 million spent on defence.

==Second World War==
On the outbreak of the Second World War, Gort was appointed by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain as the Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France, arriving there on 19 September 1939.

Unimpressed by Gort&#x27;s qualities for command, War Minister Leslie Hore-Belisha described Gort as: &quot;utterly brainless and unable to grasp the simplest problem&quot;. Gort dismissed his subordinates&#x27; critiques of the Allies&#x27; Plan D, including his former friend Alan Brooke&#x27;s correct prediction that it would allow the Wehrmacht to outflank the Allied forces, as defeatist. The Pillbox affair, as it was known, resulted in Hore-Belisha&#x27;s dismissal.

On 25 May 1940, facing overwhelming German forces, Gort decided that he could no longer support the French Army and ordered a retreat by the BEF northwards to the French coast. On reaching the coast Gort oversaw the en masse retirement of the BEF back to the British Isles, involving the Battle of Dunkirk and the Dunkirk evacuation, while France was defeated and surrendered to Nazi Germany four weeks later.

Some historians have argued that, by these actions, Gort saved the BEF, while others believe that he should have continued to attack the German forces.

The chaotic rout of the BEF under Gort&#x27;s command from France convinced Winston Churchill, the newly installed British Prime Minister, that he was undesirable as a field commander, and he was side-lined to non-combatant posts. On his return from France on 1 June 1940 he was appointed an ADC General to George VI. He accompanied Duff Cooper, to Rabat in Morocco, to rally anti-Nazi French cabinet ministers, but was instead temporarily held on his flying boat.

Gort was appointed Inspector of Training and General Officer Commanding the Home Guard in late 1940. He went on trips to Iceland, Orkney and Shetland. He was then appointed Governor of Gibraltar in 1941. In 1943, he succeeded Lord Galway as Colonel Commandant of the Honourable Artillery Company, a position he held until his death.

Gort was appointed Governor of Malta in 1942 and led the defence of the island under siege from enemy forces. The Maltese Government presented a Sword of Honour to him for this role. He pushed ahead with extending the airfield into land reclaimed from the sea, against the advice of the British government, but was later thanked by the War Cabinet for his foresight when the airfield proved vital to the British Mediterranean campaign. Gort received his field marshal&#x27;s baton from the King at Malta on 20 June 1943. Gort was in attendance, along with Generals Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harold Alexander, when Marshal Pietro Badoglio signed the surrender of all Italian forces in Valletta harbour on 29 September 1943.

Gort was also present when his son-in-law, Major William Sidney, received the Victoria Cross from General Sir Harold Alexander, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the Allied Armies in Italy, on 3 March 1944 in Italy.

Gort was appointed High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan in late 1944. He served in this office for only one year. In 1945 he nominated William James Fitzgerald, Chief Justice of Palestine, to enquire into the Jewish-Arab conflict in Jerusalem. Chief Justice Fitzgerald issued his report in which he proposed to divide the city into separate Jewish and Arab Quarters. Despite growing tensions in Palestine, Gort strove to cultivate good personal relations with both Jews and Arabs, and was greatly admired and respected by the Jewish and Arab communities.

During his time in Palestine, Gort&#x27;s health deteriorated, and he was suffering from great pain and discomfort in his abdomen. He was in fact suffering from liver cancer, but the doctors he consulted in London were unable to properly diagnose his condition. Gort ruled Palestine at the time that the Jewish insurgency was beginning. Despite his efforts, he was unable to stem the growing confrontation between the Yishuv (Jewish community) and British authorities. On 5 November 1945, he stepped down as High Commissioner and returned to Britain. Commenting on his departure, &quot;The Palestine Post&quot; wrote that &quot;No High Commissioner in the twenty-five years of British rule in Palestine enjoyed greater popular trust and none repaid it with greater personal kindness.&quot;

==Death==
After leaving Palestine and returning to England, Gort was admitted to Guy&#x27;s Hospital in London, where exploratory surgery revealed that he was dying from inoperable liver cancer. Already a viscount in the Peerage of Ireland, Gort was created a viscount in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in February 1946. On 31 March 1946, he died in Guy&#x27;s Hospital at the age of 59 years. As he did not have a surviving son, the Irish Viscountcy of Gort passed to his brother, Standish Vereker, and the British creation became extinct. His body was entombed in the Sidney family vault at St. John the Baptist Church, Penshurst, in the county of Kent.

==Family==
Gort married Corinna Katherine Vereker, his second cousin, on 22 February 1911; the couple had two sons and a daughter, before divorcing (1925). Their elder son, Charles Standish Vereker, was born on 23 February 1912, and served as a lieutenant with the Grenadier Guards, before committing suicide (26 February 1941). A second son, Jocelyn Cecil Vereker, was born on 27 July 1913, but died before his second birthday. Gort&#x27;s daughter, Jacqueline Corinne Yvonne Vereker, who was born on 20 October 1914, married (June 1940) The Honourable William Sidney, later the 1st Viscount De L&#x27;Isle.

<text>Louviers () is a commune in the Eure department in Normandy in north-western France.

Louviers is from Paris and from Rouen.

== History==

===Prehistory===
In the area around Louviers, cut stones from the Paleolithic era have been found. Some of these are in the town&#x27;s museum, alongside fragments of a mammoth tusk found not far from the cemetery. Other evidence of human presence in the area at different periods of prehistory includes the menhir of Basse-Cremonville and the Neolithic tomb which was close to it. Various objects from these periods - weapons, vases, stone and bronze tools - have also been found in the area.

===Ancient Gaul and Roman Gaul===
A few elements dating from the period of Ancient Gaul have been found at Louviers: a Celtic grave found in 1863 against the wall of the Église Notre-Dame, and several Gallic coins. A hypothesis of a fortified Gallic village has been formulated, but not proven. The Louviers of Roman Gaul is, however, better known. It was not, however, unimportant, as judged by the fact that it appeared in neither the Antonine Itinerary nor the Tabula Peutingeriana.

===Middle ages===
Under the Merovingians, Louviers had at least two cemeteries, but it is only from the 9th Century that certain historical events can be dated.

* On 10 February 856, King Charles II (Charles the Bald), father of the future Louis II (in French, Louis le Bègue), promised his son in marriage to a daughter of Erispoe, king of Brittany. In return, Erispoe gave to Charles the duchy of Mans. This arrangement greatly displeased the Breton vassals, and was perhaps one of the reasons for the plot which followed the death of the Breton king the following year.
* In 965, Richard I, Duke of Normandy gave the churches of Louviers and Pinterville, the fisheries of the water-mills of Louviers, and forty sols of rent on these mills to the Abbey of Saint-Taurin, which he had just founded at Évreux. It is the first time, at the end of the period, that the name of Louviers appears in an official deed.
* In 1026, this donation was confirmed by Richard II, Duke of Normandy.
* In 1184, the &quot;mills of the king&quot; burnt down, and were rebuilt.
* In 1195, Richard Lionheart confirmed the charter of his predecessors.
* In 1196, Philip II of France and Richard Lionheart signed the Trêve de Louviers (written confirmation of the peace of Issoudun).
* In 1197, Richard Lionheart gave Louviers to the archbishop of Rouen, Walter de Coutances, in return for which, Richard received Les Andelys and with it, the opportunity to build Château Gaillard. From this date up to the French Revolution, the archbishops of Rouen were counts of Louviers.
* Starting from around the beginning of the 13th century, the church of Notre-Dame de Louviers, was built. By 1240, the principal parts were finished: the choir, the nave and the transept surmounted by a lantern tower.
* The town continued to prosper up to the middle of the 14th century, thanks to its cloth industry, and it is possible that the population exceeded 10,000. Evidence of this wealth includes the construction of a buildings: a bishop&#x27;s manor, houses of wood and of wattle and daub, and stone dwellings for the master drapers and the rich merchants.
* In 1346 and again in 1356, the town was again captured and sacked. It was occupied for four years up to 1360. On 16 May of that year, Edward the Black Prince, solemnly pronounced, in the name of his father, Edward III of England, the ratification of the treaty which, in exchange for one quarter of the kingdom of France, set at liberty John II of France (French: Jean le Bon), who had been a prisoner in Poitiers.
* In 1364, the people of Louviers asked Charles V of France for authorisation to fortify the town&#x27;s ramparts.
* From 1379 to 1385, the church was repaired: the vaults of the nave were raised and a spire 50 metres high was built on top of the bell-tower.
* On 12 July 1380, the constable of the garrison, inspecting the walls towards midnight, found a sentinel asleep. The constable angrily threw him, head first, at a wooden sentry box, and killed him.
* In 1409, the townspeople started work again on the fortifications, which had been neglected after the victories of Bertrand du Guesclin against the English. They undertook to build on the side of their church a bell-tower in a style more military than religious.
* In 1418, the English laid siege to the town. The battle was fierce and the victors pitiless. The town was taken after 26 hours (15 according to English sources): 120 townspeople were killed at sword-point, while the others were spared only by paying a large ransom (15,000 ecus). The occupation that followed lasted 11 years.
* In December 1429, Étienne de Vignolles, also called La Hire, companion of Joan of Arc, retook the town. The English, not able to accept this fact, besieged the town in May 1431 with 12,000 men. The new siege lasted nearly six months. The town capitulated on 22 October after it had lost most of its defenders. The English promised honourable conditions to the survivors, but razed the town.
* In 1440, the town was again liberated and its inhabitants were able to rebuild it. The English tried one last time to take the town in 1441. In that year, Charles VII of France exempted the people of Louviers in perpetuity from paying most royal taxes, and in particular, the heaviest tax, the taille. The town received, incorporated in its coast of arms, the motto &quot;Loviers le Franc&quot; (Louviers the loyal), and the inhabitants received the right to bear the letter L in embroidery, goldsmithery or wherever else they pleased.
* In the 15th century, Louvier&#x27;s cloth industry kept its royal protection under the king Louis XI, as was the case with other towns of Normandy.

===Renaissance===

* Between 1496 and 1510 the southern façade of the church of Notre-Dame was expanded in the flamboyant gothic style. At about the same time, the lantern tower was also renovated.
* In 1562, Rouen fell into the hands of the Protestants. On the orders of Charles IX of France, the Parliament of Normandy was transferred to Louviers, where it sat from 5 August to 28 October.
* In 1591, Charles de Gontaut, Marshal de Biron (1562 – 1602), the lieutenant of Henri IV, presented himself in front of Louviers on 6 June and seized the town, after a brief but violent fight; this allowed the king to enter.

===17th and 18th centuries===
* In the 17th century, several epidemics of plague struck the town (1619, 1620, 1624, 1648, 1694), with many victims.
* In 1620, the franchises granted by Charles VII were abolished by Louis XIII.
* In 1681, the royal administration installed in Louviers a cloth factory specialising in products of very high quality. Managed for more than 50 years by Francois Le Camus, it brought some prosperity to the town. But regulations brought in by minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert facilitated competition from the town of Elbeuf.
* In the 18th century, many natural disasters hit the town: terrible winters (1709, 1740, 1776, 1784); a hurricane (1705); floods (1740, 1776, 1784); and major fires (1782, 1783).
* In 1709, a rabid wolf entered the town and bit 15 people, killing five.
* In 1785, Louviers got its first factory with mechanical machinery. It spun cotton using the new English methods.

===1789–1945===
During the French Revolution, Louviers&#x27; citizens were moderate in their cahiers de doléances (grievances presented to the king), and followed the currents of thought and action of the rest of the country. This moderation was shown by constitutional royalists at the time of the first two revolutionary assemblies; by Girondists at the start of the National Convention, and by the Thermidorian Reaction after the execution of Robespierre.

Food shortages under the Revolution and the fact that they became worse under the French Directory favoured support of a strong government, and the consular constitution was accepted unanimously by the voters. The first consul (Napoleon) visited Louviers on 30 October 1802. He returned on 1 June 1810 with his wife Marie-Louise and they visited the town&#x27;s factories.

The town was occupied by the Prussians in 1815.

The regulations of Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619-1683) had led the manufacturers of Louviers to specialise in extremely fine cloth. But the Revolution did not favour luxury fabrics, leading to a severe downturn in manufacturing in the town. With the introduction of new manufacturing methods, however, the quality was maintained while lowering the price. With this, the town enjoyed a new prosperity that lasted up to the middle of the twentieth century. This prosperity was reflected in some important civic projects:
* Under the Bourbon Restoration (1814–1830), the old ramparts were demolished and replaced by boulevards.
* Under the July Monarchy (1830–1848) a library, a savings bank, and the first true public school for boys were built, and Notre-Dame was restored.
* Under the Second Empire (1852–1870), streets were opened and paved, schools, the port, bridges and lighting were improved; important works were done to l&#x27;Hotel de ville and a new railway station was opened. 
The revolutions of 1830 (the July Revolution) and 1848 passed almost unnoticed in Louviers.

In 1870, the war against Prussia caused 16 deaths, 13 wounded and 23 prisoners. The town was evacuated at the beginning of March 1871, then life resumed as normal under the Third Republic. In 1855 the &quot;école primaire supérieure&quot; was established – it subsequently became a college then a lycée. In 1899, Louviers&#x27; streets were lit with electricity. Before World War I, a municipal theatre, a museum and a range of organisations – scholarly, sporting, musical, cooperative – flourished.

In June 1940, Louviers suffered greatly under the bombardments of the Battle of France. Members of several of the Resistance groups in the town were arrested and deported. On 25 August 1944, the Americans, then the British, liberated the town after several bombardments. On 8 October 1944, Louviers was visited by General de Gaulle, and on 26 June 1949, the town was awarded the Croix de Guerre.

===Recent history===
After the Second World War, the town was reconstructed, and several new quarters were created: Saint-Lubin, Saint-Germain, la Roquette, la Côte de Paris, Saint-Jean.

In the second half of the twentieth century, Louviers&#x27; political history has a left-wing tilt. From 1953 to 1958, the mayor was Pierre Mendès France (1907–1982), a member of the left-wing Radical Party. From 1965 to 1969, the mayor was Ernest Martin of the DVG (Miscellaneous left). The candidates on the list that he headed were left-wing and anti-authoritarian; their party allegiances went from the Parti Socialiste Unifié (PSU) to the anarchists. They sought self governance (&quot;autogestion&quot;), and the events of May 1968 led in Louviers to the establishment of self-managing bodies – neighbourhood committees, avant-garde cultural policies, and so on.

The right won the municipal elections in 1969. For eight years, town hall debates were stormy, but then in 1977, Henri Fromentin was elected mayor on a platform of implementing Ernest Martin&#x27;s revolutionary programme.

<text>This is a list of [[Prime Minister of Finland|prime ministers]] of [[Finland]] since the establishment of that office in 1917.

==History==
In 1918, the Finnish Senate was transformed into the Finnish Government, and the position of &quot;vice-chairman of the economic division of the Senate&quot; was transformed into the position of prime minister. Kesäranta (in Swedish Villa Bjälbo), located in the Meilahti neighborhood of Helsinki, has been the official residence of the prime minister of Finland since 1919.

Since its independence (declared on 6 December 1917), Finland has had 75 cabinets, including the current one, the longest lasting being the cabinet of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä, lasting 1,469 days.

Before the 1980s, cabinets tended to be short lived; the president was the most important political figure, and he had the right to form a new cabinet whenever he wanted. From the 1980s onwards, cabinets have tended to serve full terms (although the prime minister changed midterm in a few cases, most of the other cabinet members have remained nearly unchanged) and the prime minister has become more powerful a figure than the president. Under the current constitution, the prime minister is chosen by the parliament and only formally appointed by the president.

==List of prime ministers==
Finnish cabinets and prime ministers are numbered sequentially. A prime minister can serve as the head of multiple cabinets. For example, Matti Vanhanen is both the 39th and the 40th prime minister.

<doc id="207360" wikidata="Q153992" url="?curid=207360" title="Reichstag fire">
<text>The Reichstag fire (, ) was an arson attack on the Reichstag building, home of the German parliament in Berlin, on Monday, 27 February 1933, precisely four weeks after Adolf Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor of Germany. Marinus van der Lubbe, a Dutch council communist, was the culprit; the Nazis attributed the fire to a group of Communist agitators, used it as a pretext to claim that Communists were plotting against the German government, and induced President Paul von Hindenburg to issue the Reichstag Fire Decree suspending civil liberties, and pursue a &quot;ruthless confrontation&quot; with the Communists. This made the fire pivotal in the establishment of Nazi Germany.

The first report of the fire came shortly after 9:00p.m., when a Berlin fire station received an alarm call. By the time police and firefighters arrived, the structure was engulfed in flames. The police conducted a thorough search inside the building and found Van der Lubbe, who was arrested.

After the Fire Decree was issued, the police – now controlled by Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Party – made mass arrests of communists, including all of the communist Reichstag delegates. This severely crippled communist participation in the 5 March elections. After the 5 March elections, the absence of the communists allowed the Nazi Party to expand their plurality in the Reichstag, greatly assisting the Nazi seizure of total power. On 9 March 1933 the Prussian state police arrested Bulgarians Georgi Dimitrov, Vasil Tanev, and Blagoy Popov, who were known Comintern operatives (though the police did not know it then, Dimitrov was head of all Comintern operations in Western Europe). Ernst Torgler, head of the Communist Party, had surrendered to police on 28 February.

Van der Lubbe and the four communists were the defendants in a trial that started in September 1933. It ended in the acquittal of the four communists and the conviction of Van der Lubbe, who was then executed.

The responsibility for the Reichstag fire remains a topic of debate and research, as while Van der Lubbe was found guilty, it is unclear whether he acted alone. While most historians accept that the Reichstag was set ablaze by Van der Lubbe, some view that the fire was a part of a Nazi plot to take power, a view which historian Richard J. Evans labels a conspiracy theory.

In 2008, Germany posthumously pardoned Van der Lubbe under a law introduced in 1998 to lift unjust verdicts dating from the Nazi era.

==Prelude==
After the November 1932 German federal election, the Nazi Party had a plurality, not a majority; the communists posted gains. Adolf Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor and head of the coalition government on 30 January 1933. As chancellor, Hitler asked President Paul von Hindenburg to dissolve the Reichstag and call for a new parliamentary election. The date set for the elections was 5 March 1933.

Hitler hoped to abolish democracy in a quasi-legal fashion, by passing the Enabling Act. The Enabling Act was a special law that gave the Chancellor the power to pass laws by decree, without the involvement of the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. These special powers would remain in effect for four years, after which time they were eligible to be renewed. Under the Weimar Constitution, the President could rule by decree in times of emergency using Article 48.

During the election campaign, the Nazis alleged that Germany was on the verge of a communist revolution and that the only way to stop the communists was to put the Nazis securely in power. The message of the campaign was simple: increase the number of Nazi seats.

==Fire==
Shortly after 9p.m. on 27 February 1933, the Reichstag building was reported as on fire when a Berlin fire station received an alarm call, and firefighters were dispatched. Despite their efforts, most of the building was gutted. By 11:30 p.m., the fire was put out. The firefighters and police inspected the ruins and found 20 bundles of flammable material (firelighters) unburned lying about. At the time the fire was reported, Hitler was having dinner with Joseph Goebbels at Goebbels&#x27; apartment in Berlin. When Goebbels received an urgent phone call informing him of the fire, he regarded it as a &quot;tall tale&quot; at first and hung up. Only after the second call did he report the news to Hitler. Both left Goebbels&#x27; apartment and arrived by car at the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, just as the fire was being put out. They were met at the site by Hermann Göring, Interior Minister of Prussia, who told Hitler, &quot;This is communist outrage! One of the communist culprits has been arrested.&quot; Hitler called the fire a &quot;sign from God&quot; and claimed it was a signal meant to mark the beginning of a communist revolt. The next day, Hitler reported that &quot;this act of incendiarism is the most monstrous act of terrorism carried out by Bolshevism in Germany&quot;. The &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot; newspaper warned its readers that &quot;the government is of the opinion that the situation is such that a danger to the state and nation existed and still exists&quot;.

Walter Gempp was head of the Berlin fire department at the time of the Reichstag fire on 27 February 1933, personally directing the operations at the incident. On 25 March he was dismissed for presenting evidence that suggested Nazi involvement in the fire. Gempp asserted that there had been a delay in notifying the fire brigade and that he had been forbidden from making full use of the resources at his disposal. In 1937, Gempp was arrested for abuse of office. Despite his appeal, he was imprisoned. Gempp was strangled and killed in prison on 2 May 1939.

==Political consequences==
The day after the fire, at Hitler&#x27;s request, President Hindenburg signed the Reichstag Fire Decree into law by using Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution. The Reichstag Fire Decree suspended most civil liberties in Germany, including &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, freedom of expression, freedom of the press, the right of free association and public assembly, and the secrecy of the post and telephone. These rights were not reinstated during Nazi reign. The decree was used by the Nazis to ban publications not considered friendly to the Nazi cause. Despite the fact that Marinus van der Lubbe claimed to have acted alone in the Reichstag fire, Hitler, after having obtained his emergency powers, announced that it was the start of a wider communist effort to take over Germany. Nazi Party newspapers then published this fabricated story. This sent the German population into a panic and isolated the communists further among the civilians; additionally, thousands of communists were imprisoned in the days following the fire (including leaders of the Communist Party of Germany) on the charge that the Party was preparing to stage a &quot;putsch&quot;. Speaking to Rudolph Diels about communists during the Reichstag fire, Hitler said &quot;These sub-humans do not understand how the people stand at our side. In their mouse-holes, out of which they now want to come, of course they hear nothing of the cheering of the masses.&quot; With communist electoral participation also suppressed (the communists previously polled 17% of the vote), the Nazis were able to increase their share of the vote in the 5 March 1933 &quot;Reichstag&quot; elections from 33% to 44%. This gave the Nazis and their allies, the German National People&#x27;s Party (who won 8% of the vote), a majority of 52% in the &quot;Reichstag&quot;.

While the Nazis emerged with a majority, they fell short of their goal, which was to win 50–55% of the vote that year. The Nazis thought that this would make it difficult to achieve their next goal, passage of the Enabling Act giving Hitler the right to rule by decree, which required a two-thirds majority. However, several important factors weighed in the Nazis&#x27; favour, mainly the continued suppression of the Communist Party and the Nazis&#x27; ability to capitalize on national security concerns. Moreover, some deputies of the Social Democratic Party (the only party that would vote against the Enabling Act) were prevented from taking their seats in the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, due to arrests and intimidation by the Nazi SA. As a result, the Social Democratic Party would be under-represented in the final vote tally. The Enabling Act passed easily on 23 March 1933, with the support of the right-wing German National People&#x27;s Party, the Centre Party, and several fragmented middle-class parties. The measure went into force on 24 March, effectively making Hitler dictator of Germany.

The Kroll Opera House, sitting across the &quot;Königsplatz&quot; from the burned-out Reichstag building, functioned as the Reichstag&#x27;s venue for the remaining 12 years of the Third Reich&#x27;s existence.

==Legal proceedings==


In July 1933, Marinus van der Lubbe, Ernst Torgler, Georgi Dimitrov, Blagoi Popov, and Vasil Tanev were indicted on charges of setting the fire. The case against them was tried at the fourth criminal senate of the Reich Supreme Court in Leipzig from September 21 to December 23 in 1933.

The trial known as the Leipzig Trial took place and was presided over by judges from the German Supreme Court, the &quot;Reichsgericht&quot;. This was Germany&#x27;s highest court. The presiding judge was Judge Wilhelm Bünger of the Fourth Criminal Court of the Fourth Penal Chamber of the Supreme Court. The prosecutors were Chief Reich Prosecutor Karl Werner and his assistant Felix Parrisius. The accused were charged with arson and with attempting to overthrow the government.

While the official start and end points of the trial were in Leipzig, the court proceedings were relocated to the scene of the crime itself. The move to Berlin facilitated efficient witness questioning and examination of evidence directly at the Reichstag building. For the last month (November 23 - December 23) the court returned to Leipzig.

=== The opening of the trial ===

The trial began at 8:45 on the morning of 21 September, with Van der Lubbe testifying. Van der Lubbe&#x27;s testimony was very hard to follow as he spoke of losing his sight in one eye and wandering around Europe as a drifter and that he had been a member of the Communist Party of Holland, which he quit in 1931, but still considered himself a communist.

=== Media coverage ===

The Leipzig Trial was widely publicized and was broadcast on the radio. It was expected that the court would find the communists guilty on all counts.

According to the German press, the Nazi government wanted to use the trial to get its own message out to the world. Goebbels&#x27;s Propaganda Ministry had sent many of its officials to manage the flow of information to the foreign press. There were no fewer than eighty foreign correspondents in the courtroom, along with forty German colleagues, in the opening session of the court. The atmosphere of the opening of the trial was described by Otto D. Tolischus for &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
Repeatedly during the session glaring movie picture flares illuminated the somber court room. Microphones recorded the words of the participants in the drama and nearly half the large hall was filled with representatives of the world press. The rest of the hall was packed to the rafters with spectators, including representatives of foreign governments, foreign jurists of note and relatives of the accused.

=== Dimitrov&#x27;s testimony ===

Georgi Dimitrov began his testimony on the third day of the trial. He gave up his right to a court-appointed lawyer and defended himself successfully. When warned by Judge Bünger to behave himself in court, Dimitrov stated: &quot;Herr President, if you were a man as innocent as myself and you had passed seven months in prison, five of them in chains night and day, you would understand it if one perhaps becomes a little strained.&quot; During the course of his defence, Dimitrov claimed that the organizers of the fire were senior members of the Nazi Party and frequently verbally clashed with Göring at the trial. The high point of the trial occurred on 4 November 1933, when Göring took the stand and was cross-examined by Dimitrov. The following exchange took place:

=== Verdict ===

In his verdict announced on December 23, Judge Bünger was careful to underline his belief that there had in fact been a communist conspiracy to burn down the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, but declared, with the exception of Van der Lubbe, there was insufficient evidence to connect the accused to the fire or the alleged conspiracy. The Bulgarians were acquitted and were expelled to the Soviet Union. Only Van der Lubbe was found guilty and sentenced to death. Torgler was also acquitted and survived the war.

=== Other outcomes ===

The outcome of this trial caused Hitler to remove treason trials from the regular courts. He decreed that henceforth treasonamong many other offenseswould only be tried by a newly established People&#x27;s Court (&quot;Volksgerichtshof&quot;). The People&#x27;s Court later became associated with the number of death sentences it handed down, including those following the 1944 attempt to assassinate Hitler, which were presided over by then Judge-President Roland Freisler.

=== Artistic response to the trial ===
One week before the trial began, on 14 September 1933, the German artist John Heartfield published a photomontage in the &quot;Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung&quot;, which he named &quot;Goering, der Henker des Dritten Reiches&quot; (Goering the Executioner). In it the burning Reichstag can be seen in the background.

===Execution of Van der Lubbe, January 1934===
At his trial, Van der Lubbe was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was beheaded by guillotine (the customary form of execution in Saxony at the time) on 10 January 1934, three days before his 25th birthday. The Nazis alleged that Van der Lubbe was part of a communist conspiracy to burn down the &quot;Reichstag&quot; and seize power, while the communists alleged that Van der Lubbe was part of the Nazi conspiracy to blame the crime on them. Van der Lubbe, for his part, maintained that he acted alone to protest against the condition of the German working class.

===Posthumous restitution, 1967 to 2008===
In 1967, a court in West Berlin allowed the 1933 conviction to stand, but overturned the death sentence and posthumously changed Van der Lubbe&#x27;s sentence to eight years in prison. In 1980, another court overturned the verdict, but was overruled. In 1981, a West German court posthumously overturned Van der Lubbe&#x27;s 1933 conviction and found him not guilty by reason of insanity. This ruling was overturned. However, in January 2008, he was pardoned under a 1998 law for the crime on the grounds that anyone convicted under Nazi Germany is officially not guilty. The law allows pardons for people convicted of crimes under the Nazis, based on the idea that the laws of Nazi Germany &quot;went against the basic ideas of justice&quot;.

==Dispute about Van der Lubbe&#x27;s role==

In early historical summations, such as William Shirer&#x27;s account, the Reichstag Fire is understood and represented as a conspiratorial operation carried out by Nazi storm troopers in which Van der Lubbe played the role of the patsy. As Shirer writes: Van der Lubbe, it seems clear, was a dupe of the Nazis. He was encouraged to try to set the Reichstag on fire. But the main job was to be done – without his knowledge, of course – by the storm troopers... He had only his shirt for tinder. The main fires, according to the testimony of experts at the trial, had been set with considerable quantities of chemicals and gasoline. It was obvious that one man could not have carried them into the building, nor would it have been possible for him to start so many fires in so many scattered places in so short a time.Attitudes as to whether Van der Lubbe was used as a pawn in a Nazi conspiracy or whether he acted alone have swung back and forth over the years. During the late 1990s into the early 2010s consensus held that Van der Lubbe acted alone. From 2014 to the present the resurfacing of a 1955 affidavit given by stormtrooper Hans-Martin Lennings, who testified that the building was already on fire when Van der Lubbe was delivered there by SA members, supported new scholarship re-examining the subject.

In 1998 historian Ian Kershaw argued that nearly all historians agreed that Van der Lubbe had set the &quot;Reichstag&quot; on fire, that he had acted alone, and that the incident was merely a stroke of good luck for the Nazis.
In the days following the incident, major newspapers in the US and London had immediately been skeptical of the good fortune of the Nazis in finding a communist scapegoat.

In 2007, it has been alleged that the idea that Van der Lubbe was a &quot;half-wit&quot; or &quot;mentally disturbed&quot; was propaganda spread by the Dutch Communist Party, to distance itself from an insurrectionist antifascist, who had once been a member. John Gunther, who covered the trial, described Van der Lubbe as &quot;an obvious victim of manic-depressive psychosis&quot; and said that the Nazis would not have chosen &quot;an agent so inept and witless&quot;. Citing a letter that was allegedly written by Karl Ernst before his death during the Night of Long Knives, Gunther believed that Nazis, who heard Van der Lubbe boast of planning to attack the Reichstag, started a second simultaneous fire they blamed on him. Hans Mommsen concluded that the Nazi leadership was in a state of panic on the night of the &quot;Reichstag&quot; fire, and seemed to regard the fire as confirmation that a communist revolution was as imminent as they had claimed.

The British reporter Sefton Delmer, criticised for being a Nazi sympathiser at the time, witnessed that night&#x27;s events. He reported Hitler arriving at the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, appearing uncertain how it began, and concerned that a communist coup was about to be launched. Delmer viewed Van der Lubbe as being solely responsible, but that the Nazis sought to make it appear to be a &quot;communist gang&quot; that set the fire. On the other hand, the communists sought to make it appear that Van der Lubbe was working for the Nazis, so each side constructed a conspiracy theory in which the other was the villain.

In private, according to &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Table Talk&quot;, Hitler said of the chairman of the Communist Party, Ernst Torgler: &quot;I&#x27;m convinced he was responsible for the burning of the Reichstag, but I can&#x27;t prove it&quot;.

In 1960, Fritz Tobias, a West German SPD public servant and part-time historian, published a series of articles in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, later turned into a book, in which he argued that Vаn der Lubbe had acted alone. Tobias showed that Van der Lubbe was a pyromaniac, with a long history of burning down buildings or attempting to burn them down. Tobias established that Van der Lubbe had committed a number of arson attacks on buildings in the days prior to 27 February.

In March 1973, the Swiss historian Walter Hofer organized a conference intended to rebut the claims made by Tobias. At the conference, Hofer claimed to have found evidence that some of the detectives who investigated the fire had been Nazis. Mommsen commented on Hofer&#x27;s claims by stating: &quot;Professor Hofer&#x27;s rather helpless statement that the accomplices of Van der Lubbe &#x27;could only have been Nazis&#x27; is tacit admission that the committee did not actually obtain any positive evidence in regard to the alleged accomplices&#x27; identity&quot;. Mommsen also had a theory supporting Hofer, which was suppressed for political reasons, an act that he admitted was a serious breach of ethics.

In 2014, historian Benjamin Carter Hett lamented that &quot;Today the overwhelming consensus among historians who specialize in Nazi Germany remains that Marinus van der Lubbe burned the Reichstag all by himself&quot;. He has argued that Tobias&#x27; analysis is fundamentally flawed. Tobias undertook his study when tasked to defend West German police officials, who had investigated the initial fire as SS members. In doing so, Tobias disregarded any information from persons who had been targeted by the Nazi regime as biased while accepting the testimony of former SS members as objective, even though their post-war testimony is clearly contradicted by records from 1933. Furthermore, Hett showed that Tobias used his access to secret archives to coerce historians with opposing views by threatening to reveal compromising personal information. Hett argues that the most recent evidence makes clear that the fire could not have been the work of an individual and Hett feels there is far more evidence of Nazi collaboration than there is of a communist plot. Historian Richard J. Evans criticized Hett&#x27;s claims giving a negative review of his book on the subject.

More recently in 2019, mainstream German outlet Deutsche Welle (DW) reported that according to an SA officer&#x27;s sworn testimony, Van Der Lubbe could not have started the fire because the Reichstag was already on fire when he arrived with Van Der Lubbe, lending credence to the theory that this was a false flag operation Hitler used to seize power. The Enabling Act of 1933 was passed less than one month later and was the cornerstone of Hitler&#x27;s rise to power. In 2008 Germany posthumously pardoned Van der Lubbe.

===1955 testimony of SA member Hans-Martin Lennings===
In July 2019, more than 80 years after the event, Germany&#x27;s &quot;Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; and the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland published a 1955 affidavit, uncovered in some papers of Fritz Tobias, which were found in the archives of the Amtsgericht (court) in Hannover. The affidavit by Martin Lennings (1904–1962), a former member of the Nazis&#x27; paramilitary SA unit, stated that on the night of the fire, he and his SA group drove Van der Lubbe from an infirmary to the Reichstag, where they noticed &quot;a strange smell of burning and there were clouds of smoke billowing through the rooms&quot;. The statement suggests the fire had already started when they arrived and that the SA played a role in the arson.

Lennings, who died in 1962, further stated in his account that he and other members of his squad had protested the arrest of Van der Lubbe, &quot;because we were convinced that Van der Lubbe could not possibly have been the arsonist, because according to our observation, the Reichstag had already been burning when we dropped him off there&quot;. He claimed he and the other witnesses were detained and forced to sign a paper that denied any knowledge of the incident. Later, nearly all of those with knowledge of the Reichstag fire were executed. Lennings said that he had been warned and escaped to Czechoslovakia.

Lennings had asked that his account be certified in 1955, in the event the Reichstag fire case ever returned to trial.

The uncovering of Lennings&#x27;s affidavit led to the speculation that Tobias had ignored it to protect his single perpetrator theory on the arson, and to protect the post-war career of former Nazis. It also led to more sober speculation about whether unknown or forgotten documents might still be hidden in German archives, and which might be valuable and revealing historical sources, especially on the Nazi regime.

===Göring&#x27;s alleged commentary, 1943===
In &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot;, William L. Shirer wrote that at the Nuremberg Trials, General Franz Halder stated in an affidavit that Hermann Göring had boasted about setting the fire: &quot;On the occasion of a lunch on the Führer&#x27;s birthday in 1943, the people around the Führer turned the conversation to the Reichstag building and its artistic value. I heard with my own ears how Göring broke into the conversation and shouted: &#x27;The only one who really knows about the Reichstag building is I, for I set fire to it.&#x27; And saying this he slapped his thigh&quot;. Under cross-examination at the Nuremberg trial in 1945 and 1946, Halder&#x27;s affidavit was read to Göring, who denied any involvement in the fire.

===&quot;Countertrial&quot; by the German Communist Party in exile, 1933===

During the summer of 1933, a mock countertrial was organised in London by a group of lawyers, democrats and other anti-Nazis under the aegis of German communist émigrés. The chairman of the mock trial was British Labour Party barrister D. N. Pritt, and the chief organiser was the KPD propaganda chief Willi Münzenberg. The other &quot;judges&quot; were Piet Vermeylen of Belgium, George Branting of Sweden, Vincent de Moro-Giafferi and Gaston Bergery of France, Betsy Bakker-Nort, a lawyer and member of parliament of the Netherlands for the progressive liberal party Free-thinking Democratic League, Vald Hvidt of Denmark, and Arthur Garfield Hays of the United States.

The mock trial began 21 September 1933. It lasted one week and ended with the conclusion that the defendants were innocent and the true initiators of the fire were to be found amid the leading Nazi Party elite. The countertrial received much media attention, and Sir Stafford Cripps delivered the opening speech. Göring was found guilty at the mock trial, which served as a workshop that tested all possible scenarios, and all speeches of the defendants had been prepared. Most of the &quot;judges&quot;, such as Hays and Moro-Giafferi, complained that the atmosphere at the &quot;countertrial&quot; was more like a show trial, with Münzenberg constantly applying pressure behind the scenes on the &quot;judges&quot; to deliver the &quot;right&quot; verdict, without any regard for the truth. One of the &quot;witnesses&quot;, a supposed SA man, appeared in court wearing a mask and claimed that it was the SA that had really set the fire. In fact, the &quot;SA man&quot; was Albert Norden, the editor of the German communist newspaper &quot;Rote Fahne&quot;. Another masked witness, whom Hays described as &quot;not very reliable&quot;, claimed that Van der Lubbe was a drug addict and a homosexual, who was the lover of Ernst Röhm and a Nazi dupe. When the lawyer for Ernst Torgler asked the mock trial organisers to turn over the &quot;evidence&quot; that exonerated his client, Münzenberg refused the request because he lacked any &quot;evidence&quot; to exonerate or to convict anyone of the crime.

The countertrial was an enormously successful publicity stunt for the German communists. Münzenberg followed the triumph with another by writing, under his name, the bestselling &quot;The Brown Book of the Reichstag Fire and Hitler Terror&quot;, an exposé of what Münzenberg alleged to be the Nazi conspiracy to burn down the Reichstag and to blame the act on the communists. (As with all of Münzenberg&#x27;s other books, the real author was one of his aides: in this case, the Czechoslovak communist Otto Katz.) The success of &quot;The Brown Book&quot; was followed by another, published in 1934, dealing with the trial.

<text>Hiiumaa ( , ) is the second largest island in Estonia and is part of the West Estonian archipelago, in the Baltic Sea. It has an area of 989 km2 and is 22 km from the Estonian mainland. Its largest town is Kärdla. It is located within Hiiu County.
== Names ==
Administratively Hiiumaa is the &quot;main island&quot; of the Hiiu County, called or in Estonian. The Swedish and German name of the island is or (&#x27;Day&#x27; island) and in Danish. In modern Finnish, it is called , literally &#x27;Hiisi&#x27;s Land&#x27;. In Old Gutnish, it was (&#x27;day isthmus&#x27;), from which the local North Germanic name is derived.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
Hiiumaa emerged from the Baltic Sea 8500 years ago due to isostatic uplift after the retreat of the ice cap. Mesolithic settlements are found on the island&#x27;s Kõpu Peninsula from about 5500 BC. These settlements seem to be related mostly to seal hunting and extend into the earliest Neolithic. As Hiiumaa is constantly uplifting the local sea level was 20 m higher than today at this time. For this reason these settlements are located far from the modern coastline. The pottery found at these sites is of the Narva Type and is similar to that found on Saaremaa and the Estonian mainland.

A series of stone-cist graves are also present on the island from the Late Bronze Age through to the Late Iron Age.

===Crusades ===
The first documented record of the island of &quot;Dageida&quot; was made by contemporary chroniclers in 1228, when Hiiumaa and the rest of Estonia were conquered by Germanic crusaders. In 1254, Hiiumaa was divided between the Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek and the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Order, acting partly on behalf of the Hanseatic League.

=== Swedish and Russian era ===

The island was part of Swedish Estonia from 1563 to 1721, after which it passed to the Russian Empire as part of the Governorate of Estonia, though Dagö&#x27;s Swedish population kept most of their privileges. Most of the island&#x27;s previously numerous Swedish-speaking population emigrated or were &quot;Estonianised&quot; during the period of Imperial Russian rule, although a minority remained until the 20th century. Estonian Swedes are also known as &quot;aibofolke&quot; (&quot;the island people&quot; in the local Swedish) or &quot;rannarootslased&quot; (&quot;coastal Swedes&quot; in Estonian). Administratively the island of Hiiumaa belonged to Lääne County.

===World War I===
Hiiumaa was occupied during World War I by the Imperial German Army, in Operation Albion. After the war, in 1918, it became a part of independent Estonia.

===World War II===
The waters near Hiiumaa were active during World War II:

* 23 June 1941: The Soviet destroyer &quot;Gnevny&quot; was sunk by a German seamine.
* 25 June: the Soviet minesweeper &quot;T-208 Shkiv&quot; was destroyed by a German seamine.
* 27 June: Two German motor torpedo boats, &quot;S43&quot; and &quot;S106&quot;, were destroyed by Soviet seamines.
* 1 July: the Soviet submarine &quot;M-81&quot; was destroyed by a German seamine north of Hiiumaa.
* 7 July: the Soviet minesweeper &quot;T-216&quot; was sunk.
* 30 July: the Soviet minesweeper &quot;T-201 Zarjad&quot; was sunk.
* 10 August: the German submarine was sunk by a torpedo from the Soviet submarine &quot;SC-307&quot;.
* Hiiumaa Island was occupied by the Stalinist Soviet Union in 1940, by Nazi Germany in 1941, and by the USSR again in 1944. 

Hiiumaa remained under Soviet control until Estonia regained independence in August 1991. During the period of Soviet occupation (1944–1991), Hiiumaa was declared a restricted zone, closed to foreigners and to most mainland Estonians. A number of derelict Soviet forts and communication towers are still present on the island&#x27;s northern coast.

==Natural environment==

Hiiumaa is an island in Estonia located north of Saaremaa in the Baltic Sea. It is the northernmost island in the Muhu archipelago, which includes Saaremaa and Muhu. Hiiumaa has a low relief (up to 68 m above sea level) and is mostly formed of limestone, that is exposed in cliffs around parts of the island&#x27;s coast. In the north of the island there are a series of fossilized beaches preserved as uplift has occurred. The modern beaches are primarily on the northern and western coast lines. The natural environment is protected within the Tahkuna Nature Reserve and West Estonian Archipelago Biosphere Reserve.

The Hiiu Shoal (Nekmangrund) is located off the northwestern shore of Hiiumaa Island. The Soela Strait separates Hiiumaa from Saaremaa to its south, and the Muhu Strait separates it from the mainland of Estonia.

=== Ecology ===
The fauna and flora of Hiiumaa are similar to the Estonian mainland. The mammal fauna includes elk, red deer, roe deer, wild boars, foxes, lynxes and martens. Wolves have recently started to repopulate the island after being made locally extinct. 
Minks were also reintroduced in 2000, after they were exterminated by trappers. Since the end of the 1990s the island shelters a conservation project aimed at restoring populations of European mink, an endangered species of which there is about only 1,000 individual specimens left in Europe as of 2017. This project started with removing from the island all American minks that had escaped from breeding farms, and reintroducing some European minks. The latter started breeding.

The bird species found on the island include black storks, golden eagles, cranes, avocets and swans. The forests are dominated by pine and deciduous trees, the rest of the uncultivated land is covered by swamps and dunes. The island has about 1000 species of large plants of which 50 are protected.

=== Geology ===
The exposed geology of Hiiumaa is composed of Paleozoic limestone which dips towards the South, covered by glacial sediments. In the North of the island the limestones are Ordovician and they young upwards to the Silurian in the South. These limestones formed at 30 degrees South and have since been moving North with the rest of the Estonian block. Bore holes have found Cambrian sedimentary rocks and a crystalline basement.

In the Ordovician (c. 455 million years ago) the sea floor was hit by a meteorite forming the 4 km wide Kärdla impact structure. This structure was then filled with Paleozoic sediment. It located about 4 km west-southwest of Kärdla and is barely visible in the modern geomorphology. The crater is well preserved at depth, with a clear rim, breccia and minerals and rocks formed from the heat and pressure of the impact.

The limestone is overlain by Pleistocene glacial deposits that were deposited as the ice cap retreated 11 to 12 thousand years ago. These include terminal moraines, the two most prominent being one in the South of Island running towards the North-East and another forming the Kõpu Peninsula.

The island has several villages, as well a small town of Kärdla (pop. 3,287) and small boroughs of Käina and Kõrgessaare. The oldest surviving church was built in Pühalepa in 1259, though it was rebuilt in the 18th century. The Hanseatic League built a lighthouse in Kõpu near the start of the 16th century. It is the third oldest continuously operating lighthouse in the world.

== Employment and land-use ==
The island’s economy is mostly tourism, livestock, farming, wrecking, fishing, and fish processing. The tourism is mostly seasonal.

Hiiumaa council agrees to the construction of a wind farm. Recently there has been a trend towards smaller farms and more tourism

==Transport==
Road transport from Estonian mainland to Hiiumaa involves a 75-minute (28 km) ferry crossing from Rohuküla to Heltermaa, which is 25 km by road from Kärdla. There are up to 10 ferry departures a day operated by TS Laevad. In the summer weekends, getting car space on the ferry usually requires advance booking. There are about 2 scheduled buses a day between Tallinn (the capital of Estonia) and Kärdla.
In the winter, the island can be reached, conditions permitting, via a 26.5 km ice road (the longest in Europe) across the frozen Baltic Sea. A bridge to the mainland of Estonia has been occasionally proposed.

Hiiumaa is served by Kärdla Airport, with regular flights to Tallinn. Bicycle rental is also available in Kärdla and there is a good bicycle path built from Kärdla towards Kõrgessaare.

== Culture and politics ==

The island is part of the B7 Network, a loose grouping of the major islands of the Baltic Sea. Smoked cooked plaice is a traditional summertime delicacy. There is a friendly rivalry with the neighboring island of Saaremaa.

<doc id="207371" wikidata="Q14767" url="?curid=207371" title="Central, Hong Kong">
<text>Central (Chinese: 中環), also known as Central District, is the central business district of Hong Kong. It is located in the northeastern corner of the Central and Western District, on the north shore of Hong Kong Island, across Victoria Harbour from Tsim Sha Tsui, the southernmost point of Kowloon Peninsula. The area was the heart of Victoria City, although that name is rarely used today.

As the central business district of Hong Kong, it is the area where many multinational financial services corporations have their headquarters. Consulates of many countries are also located in this area, as is Government Hill, the site of the government headquarters until 2011. The area, with its proximity to Victoria Harbour, has served as the centre of trade and financial activities from the earliest days of the British colonial era in 1841, and continues to flourish and serve as the place of administration since the handover to China in 1997.

==Naming==

The area of Chung Wan (aka Choong Wan in the past; ), a direct translation of Central in English, was one of the districts () in Victoria City. The English name &quot;Central&quot; became prevalent and the connected stations of Pedder and Chater (named after major streets in the area) were renamed as &quot;Central&quot;. On some older maps, Central and the area to its west are named Kwan Tai Lo () below Victoria Peak. It formed a channel, Chung Mun (), with Tsim Sha Tsui, on the sea route along the coast of southern China. The eastern part of Central District has been known as Admiralty 

Despite the name Central being synonymous with the Central and Western District, and Central station, there are significant differences. Central and Western is a administrative district with strict boundaries, legislative representation, and elections for its legislators. Central station (more commonly referred to as Central) is a stop along the MTR Island Line, but is not the only station within the Central and Western District. Other stops include Hong Kong, Admiralty, Sheung Wan and more. The Central area is a loosely defined area within the Central and Western district defined by the presence of major banks, sky scrapers, and multi-modal transportation nodes.

==Location==
Central is located on the north shore of Hong Kong Island, across Victoria Harbour from Tsim Sha Tsui, the southernmost point of Kowloon Peninsula. It is bordered in the west by Sheung Wan, with the border being along Aberdeen Street (also called Wing Kut Street). It is bordered in the east by Admiralty, an eastern extension of the Central and Western District. As such, Admiralty is sometimes considered a part of Central. Central is bordered in the south by Mid-Levels, an affluent residential area halfway up Victoria Peak. The boundary between Central and Mid-Levels is not clearly defined.

For district council elections purposes, the area, together with Admiralty, correspond roughly to the &quot;Chung Wan&quot; constituency. The boundaries of such constituencies may be subject to modification.

==History==
The British landed on Possession Point of Sheung Wan in 1841. They soon decided to build a city on the north coast of Hong Kong Island, and the present-day Central was chosen to house major military facilities and an administrative centre. Part of these military facilities include the Royal Navy port known as Naval Dockyard, and then later Admiralty. Another area to the north of Admiralty would be named Tamar for the HMS Tamar shore station (named for HMS Tamar, a Royal Navy troopship that arrived and was used as a shore base during the second opium war). The area soon attracted both Westerners and Chinese to trade and live in the area, and a Canton Bazaar (the precursor of the Central Market) was built between Cochrane Street and Graham Street in 1842. The area was soon zoned for Westerners only, and Chinese residents were restricted to Sheung Wan. It was zoned for &quot;Western-style buildings,&quot; meaning buildings with space requirements and hygiene standards similar to European. The area was largely dominated by the presence of Victoria City. The popularity of this area would also boost the population of Hong Kong from 5,000 in 1841 to 24,000 in 1848. Government House and other Hong Kong Government buildings were completed during this period on Government Hill. Various barracks, naval bases and the residence of the Commander of British Forces in Hong Kong, Flagstaff House were built on the east end of the district. Between 1860 and 1880 the construction of City Hall, Theatre Royal and other financial structures made Central the heart of Hong Kong.

In 1904, the Praya Reclamation Scheme added of land to Central&#x27;s waterfront. Many of the proposals came from Sir Paul Chater and James Johnstone Keswick, the founders of Hongkong Land, a modern property development group. During the 1920s, Hong Kong was able to push far ahead economically, because of the cohesive collaboration between Central and all waterfront commerce.

The military structures survived until the 1980s. Only Flagstaff House remains as Museum of Tea Ware in Hong Kong Park. City Hall sat on the present premises of the HSBC Hong Kong headquarters. Hong Kong&#x27;s first road, Queen&#x27;s Road (subdivided into Queen&#x27;s Road East, Central, and West), passes through the area and the business centre has continued to expand the Hong Kong shoreline into Victoria Harbour. The Hong Kong Garrison was home to the British Forces in Hong Kong, until the handover in 1997, since then it has been occupied by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of China.

Central has been the site of a number of major political protests. From October 2011 to September 2012, the Occupy Central movement against global economic inequality was based in front of the HSBC Main Building. Two years later, in September 2014, democratic activists initiated Occupy Central with Love and Peace, demanding universal suffrage for the election of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, eventually contributing to the Umbrella Revolution.

==Economy==
There are many Grade-A commercial buildings in Central, a prime commercial district in Hong Kong.

Bank of China (Hong Kong) has its head office in the Bank of China Tower. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, a subsidiary of HSBC, has its head office in the HSBC Main Building. Bank of East Asia and Hang Seng Bank have their head offices in Central. Standard Chartered Bank is also located in Central. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is based in IFC 2. Chu Kong Passenger Transport is headquartered in the Chu Kong Shipping Tower (珠江船務大廈) in Central. The head office of New World Development is in the in Central. HKR International has its head office in Shun Tak Centre.

Before 1999, Cathay Pacific had its head office in the Swire House in Central. In 1999, the airline relocated its head office to the Hong Kong International Airport.

Nord Anglia Education, which operates international schools in various countries, formerly had its head office in Central. The head office moved to Hong Kong in 2012. In 2018 the company announced it was returning its head office to the United Kingdom.

<text>New Labour is the political philosophy that dominated the history of the British Labour Party from the mid-late 1990s to 2010 under the leadership of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. The term originated in a conference slogan first used by the party in 1994, later seen in a draft manifesto which was published in 1996 and titled &quot;New Labour, New Life for Britain&quot;. It was presented as the brand of a newly reformed party that had altered the old Clause IV (which stressed nationalisation) and instead endorsed market economics. The branding was extensively used while the party was in government between 1997 and 2010. New Labour was influenced by the political thinking of Anthony Crosland and the leadership of Blair and Brown as well as Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell&#x27;s media campaigning. The political philosophy of New Labour was influenced by the party&#x27;s development of Anthony Giddens&#x27; Third Way which attempted to provide a synthesis between capitalism and socialism. The party emphasised the importance of social justice, rather than equality, emphasising the need for equal opportunity and believed in the use of markets to deliver economic efficiency and social justice.

The New Labour brand was developed to regain trust from the electorate and to portray a departure from the party&#x27;s traditional socialist policies, thereby communicating the party&#x27;s modernisation to the public. However, it was criticised for its breaking of election promises and of loosening its links to the trade unions. Calls for modernisation had become prominent following Labour&#x27;s heavy defeat in the 1983 general election, with the new Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, who came from the party&#x27;s soft left Tribune Group of Labour MPs, calling for a review of policies that led to the party&#x27;s defeat, and for improvements to the party&#x27;s public image to be made by Peter Mandelson, a former television producer. Following the leaderships of Neil Kinnock and John Smith, the party under Tony Blair attempted to widen its electoral appeal under the New Labour tagline and by the 1997 general election it had made significant gains in the middle class; resulting in a landslide victory. Labour maintained this wider support at the 2001 general election and won a third consecutive victory in the 2005 general election for the first time ever in the history of the Labour Party. However, the party&#x27;s majority was significantly reduced from four years earlier.

In 2007, Blair resigned from the party leadership after thirteen years and was succeeded by his Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown. Labour lost the 2010 general election which resulted in the first hung parliament in thirty-six years and led to the creation of a Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government. Brown resigned as Prime Minister and as Labour Party leader shortly thereafter. He was succeeded as party leader by Ed Miliband, who abandoned the New Labour branding and moved the party&#x27;s political stance further to the left under the branding One Nation Labour. Jeremy Corbyn moved the party further to the left, while Keir Starmer has repositioned it back to the centre and won the 2024 general election; Starmer&#x27;s leadership of the party has been widely compared to that of Blair, and he is regarded as having taken the party back to the centre-ground, in a similar way to that achieved by New Labour.

== History ==

First elected to parliament as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Sedgefield, County Durham at the 1983 general election, Tony Blair became the leader of the Labour Party in 1994 after winning 57% of the vote in that year&#x27;s leadership election, defeating John Prescott and Margaret Beckett. His first shadow cabinet role came in November 1988, when Neil Kinnock appointed him as Shadow Secretary of State for Energy and in July 1992 was promoted to the role of Shadow Home Secretary on the election of John Smith as Leader of the Labour Party.

Gordon Brown, who went on to hold senior positions in Blair&#x27;s Labour government before succeeding him as Prime Minister in June 2007, was not a candidate in the 1994 leadership election because of an agreement between the two made in 1994 in which Brown promised not to run for election. The media has since speculated that Blair agreed to stand down and allow Brown the premiership in the future, although Blair&#x27;s supporters have contended that such a deal never took place. The term New Labour was coined by Blair in his October 1994 Labour Party Conference speech as part of the slogan &quot;new Labour, new Britain&quot;. During this speech, Blair announced the modification of Clause IV of the party&#x27;s constitution which abandoned Labour&#x27;s attachment to nationalisation and embraced market economics. The new version of the clause committed Labour to a balance of market and public ownership and to balance creation of wealth with social justice. Blair argued for increased modernisation at the conference, asserting that &quot;parties that do not change die, and [Labour] is a living movement not a historical monument&quot;. During the period from 1994 to 1997, after Blair&#x27;s election as party leader, Labour managed to reverse decades of decline in party membership by increasing the number by around 40%, increasing its capacity to compete for office whilst also legitimising the leadership of Blair.

In 1997, New Labour won a landslide victory at the general election after eighteen years of Conservative government, winning a total of 418 seats in the House of Commons—the largest victory in the party&#x27;s history. The party was also victorious in 2001 and 2005, making Blair Labour&#x27;s longest-serving Prime Minister and the first to win three consecutive general elections. He was also the first Labour leader to win a general election since Harold Wilson in 1974.

In the months following Labour&#x27;s 1997 election victory, referendums were held in Scotland and Wales regarding devolution. There was a clear majority supporting devolution in Scotland and a narrower majority in Wales—Scotland received a stronger degree of devolution than Wales. The Labour government passed laws in 1998 to establish a Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly and the first elections for these were held in 1999. Blair attempted to continue peace negotiations in Northern Ireland by offering the creation of a regional parliament and government. In 1998, the Good Friday Agreement was made, allowing for a 108-member elected assembly and a power-sharing arrangement between nationalists and unionists. Blair was personally involved in these negotiations. The Fabian Society was a forum for New Labour ideas and for critical approaches from across the party. The most significant Fabian contribution to Labour&#x27;s policy agenda in government was Ed Balls&#x27;s 1992 pamphlet advocating Bank of England independence. In 1998, Blair and his New Labour government introduced the Human Rights Act. This was made to give UK law what the European convention of human rights had established. It was given the royal assent on the 9 November 1998, but it was not truly put in place until early October 2000.

After the United States strikes on Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998, Blair released a statement supporting the actions. He lent military support to the United States&#x27; 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. In March 2003, the Labour government, fearing Saddam Hussein&#x27;s alleged access to weapons of mass destruction, participated in the American-led invasion of Iraq. British intervention in Iraq promoted public protest. Crowds numbering 400,000 and more demonstrated in October 2002 and again the following spring. On 15 February 2003, over 1,000,000 people demonstrated against the war in Iraq and 60,000 marched in Manchester before the Labour Party conference, with the demonstrators&#x27; issues including British occupation of Afghanistan and the forthcoming invasion of Iraq.

In June 2007, Blair resigned as the leader of the Labour Party and Gordon Brown, previously the Chancellor of the Exchequer, succeeded him following the 2007 Labour Party conference. Three years earlier, Blair had announced that he would not be contesting a fourth successive general election as Labour Party leader if he won the 2005 general election. Brown initially had strong public support and plans for a quick general election were widely publicised, although they never were officially announced. On 18 February 2008, Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling announced that the failing bank Northern Rock would be nationalised, supporting it with loans and guarantees of £50,000,000,000. The bank had been destabilised by the subprime mortgage crisis the previous year in the United States and a private buyer of the bank could not be found.

The 2010 general election ended in a hung parliament in which Labour won 258 seats, 91 fewer than in 2005. Following failure to achieve a coalition agreement with the Liberal Democrats, Brown announced his intention to resign as leader of the party on 10 May and resigned as the Prime Minister the following day. Shortly thereafter, David Cameron and Nick Clegg announced the formation of a coalition between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. Cameron became the Prime Minister and Clegg the Deputy Prime Minister of a cabinet that contained eighteen Conservative ministers and five Liberal Democrat ministers. In announcing his intention to run for the leadership, David Miliband declared that the New Labour era was over. Following the publication of Blair&#x27;s memoirs on 1 September 2010, Ed Miliband said: &quot;I think it is time to move on from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson and to move on from the New Labour establishment and that is the candidate that I am at this election who can best turn the page. I think frankly most members of the public will want us to turn the page&quot;. Miliband won the leadership election and was able to mobilise support from the trade union electorate. In a July 2011 speech, Blair stated that New Labour died when he left office and Brown assumed the party leadership, claiming that from 2007 the party &quot;lost the driving rhythm&quot;. Nonetheless, New Labour&#x27;s Third Way influenced a range of centre-left political parties across the world.

== Political branding ==

Once New Labour was established, it was developed as a brand, portrayed as a departure from Old Labour, the party of pre-1994 which had been criticised for regularly betraying its election promises and was linked with trade unionism, the state and benefit claimants. Mark Bevir argues that another motivation for the creation of New Labour was as a response to the emergence of the New Right in the preceding decades. The previous two party leaders Neil Kinnock and John Smith had begun efforts to modernise the party as a strategy for electoral success before Smith died in 1994. Kinnock undertook the first wave of modernisation between the 1987 and 1992 general elections, with quantitative research conducted by Anthony Heath and Roger Jowell indicating that the electorate viewed Labour as more moderate and electable in 1992 than in 1987, arguably legitimising the arguments for increased modernisation. However, Smith&#x27;s approach which was dubbed (sometimes pejoratively) &quot;one more heave&quot; was perceived as too timid by modernisers like Blair, Brown and Mandelson. They felt that his cautious approach which sought to avoid controversy and win the next election by capitalising on the unpopularity of the Conservative government was not sufficient. New Labour also used the party&#x27;s brand to continue this modernisation and it was used to communicate the modernisation of the party to the public. The party also began to use focus groups to test whether their policy ideas were attractive to swing voters. Its purpose was to reassure the public that the party would provide a new kind of governance and mitigate fears that a Labour government would return to the labour unrest that had characterised its past. Blair explained that modernisation was &quot;about returning Labour to its traditional role as a majority mainstream party advancing the interests of the broad majority of people&quot;.

While the party was in power, press secretary Alastair Campbell installed a centralised organisation to co-ordinate government communication and impose a united message to be delivered by ministers. This process, known as &quot;Millbankization&quot; in reference to the campaign headquarters of Labour at the Millbank, was strict but very effective. Charlie Whelan, Brown&#x27;s press officer, was often in conflict with Campbell because of the former&#x27;s attempts to brief the press by his own initiatives—this continued until his resignation in 1999. Campbell followed a professional approach to media relations to ensure that a clear message was presented and the party planned stories in advance to ensure a positive media reaction. Campbell used his own experience in journalism as he was known for his attention to detail and effective use of sound bites. Campbell developed a relationship with News International, providing their newspapers with early information in return for positive media coverage.

In 2002, Philip Gould, a policy advisor to the Labour Party, wrote to the party&#x27;s leadership that the brand had become contaminated and an object of criticism and ridicule, undermined by an apparent lack of conviction and integrity. The brand was weakened by internal disputes and the apparent failure to deal with issues. This assessment was supported by Blair, who argued that the government needed to spend more time working on domestic affairs, develop a unifying strategy and create &quot;eye-catching initiatives&quot;. Blair also announced the need to be more assertive in foreign affairs.

The leaders of New Labour therefore created and ran an efficient and calculated media-handling strategy in an effort to increase electoral success. Florence Faucher-King and Patrick Le Galés note that &quot;by 2007 the party had been emptied of its capacities for intermediation with society and, in the space of 10 years, lost half of its membership. But it had become a formidable machine for winning elections&quot;.

== Electoral support ==
Under Neil Kinnock, Labour attempted to widen its electoral support from narrow class divisions. After Blair took the leadership, the party made significant gains in higher social classes and won 39% support from managers and administrators in the 1997 election, more than in previous elections that the party had lost. This was due to the calculated targeting of C1 and C2 voters by the Labour campaign and an anti-Conservative vote as opposed to an endorsement of Labour. Labour won greater support among younger voters than older, but there was no significant gender difference. During the 1980s, much of Labour&#x27;s support had retreated into industrial areas of the north and in 1997 Labour performed much better in the south of England. In the elections of 2001 and 2005, Labour maintained much of the middle-class support that it had won in 1997. According to academics Charles Pattie and Ron Johnston, Labour&#x27;s landslide in 1997 was achieved through Labour&#x27;s strong performance in opposition, their modernisation efforts and moderate policies. These all encouraged many Conservative voters to abstain as the landslide was seen by many as a foregone conclusion. The 2001 election resulted in significant drops in turnout in Labour heartland seats which has been attributed to voters regarding the re-election of Labour incumbents as a foregone conclusion, coupled with discontent surrounding Labour&#x27;s perceived inability to deliver significant improvements in public services during their first term. In 2005, Labour&#x27;s support was much lower than in the previous two elections which David Rubinstein has attributed to anger at the war in Iraq and towards Blair himself.

Professors Geoffrey Evans, John Curtice and Pippa Norris of Strathclyde University published a paper considering the incidence of tactical voting in the 1997 general election. Their studies showed that tactical voting increased in 1997—there was a strong increase in anti-Conservative voting and a decrease in anti-Labour tactical voting. Political commentators Neal Lawson and Joe Cox wrote that tactical voting helped to provide New Labour with its majorities in 1997, 2001 and 2005, arguing that the party won because of public opposition to the Conservative Party. The party declared after its victory that it &quot;won as New Labour and would govern as New Labour&quot;, but Cox and Lawson challenged this view, suggesting that the party won on account of public opposition to the Conservative Party.

== Key figures ==
=== Tony Blair ===
Tony Blair became the leader of the Labour Party after 1994&#x27;s leadership election and coined the term New Labour in that October&#x27;s party conference. Blair pursued a Third Way philosophy that sought to use the public and private sectors to stimulate economic growth and abandon Labour&#x27;s commitment to nationalisation. Blair&#x27;s approach to government included a greater reliance on the media, using that to set the national policy agenda, rather than Westminster. He spent considerable resources maintaining a good public image which sometimes took priority over the cabinet. Blair adopted a centralised political agenda in which cabinet ministers took managerial roles in their departments and strategic vision was to be addressed by the Prime Minister. Ideologically, Blair believed that individuals could only flourish in a strong society and this was not possible in the midst of unemployment.

Tony Blair served as Prime Minister, from 1997 to 2007.

=== Gordon Brown ===
Gordon Brown was an important figure in Blair&#x27;s Labour government and played a key role in developing the party&#x27;s philosophy. Brown served as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1992 to 1997 and was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer following Labour&#x27;s election victory in 1997. He attempted to control public spending and sought to increase the funding for education and healthcare. His economic strategy was market-based, attempting to reform the welfare state through a tax credit scheme for poorer working families and assigned the Bank of England to set interest rates.

=== Peter Mandelson ===

In 1985, Peter Mandelson was appointed as the Labour Party&#x27;s director of communications. Previously, he had worked in television broadcasting and helped the party become increasingly effective at communication and more concerned with its media image, especially with non-partisans. Mandelson headed the Campaigns and Communications Directorate (established in 1985) and initiated the Shadow Communications Agency. He oversaw Labour&#x27;s relationship with the media and believed in the importance of the agenda-setting role of the press. He felt that the agenda of the press (broadsheets in particular) would influence important political broadcasters. In government, Mandelson was appointed minister without portfolio to co-ordinate the various government departments. In 1998, he resigned as a cabinet minister after being accused of financial impropriety.

In 2021, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that Mandelson had been advising Labour leader Keir Starmer on moving the party beyond Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership and broadening its electoral appeal.

=== Alastair Campbell ===
Alastair Campbell was the Labour Party&#x27;s Press Secretary and led a strategy to neutralise the influence of the press which had weakened former Labour leader Neil Kinnock and create allies for the party. While in government, Campbell established a Strategic Communications Unit, a central body whose role was to co-ordinate the party&#x27;s media relations and ensure that a unified image was presented to the press. Because of his background in tabloid journalism, Campbell understood how different parts of the media would cover stories. He was a valued news source for journalists because he was close to Blair—Campbell was the first press secretary to regularly attend cabinet meetings.

== Political philosophy ==
New Labour developed and subscribed to the Third Way, a platform designed to offer an alternative &quot;beyond capitalism and socialism&quot;. The ideology was developed to make the party progressive and attract voters from across the political spectrum. According to Florence Faucher-King and Patrick Le Galés, &quot;New Labour&#x27;s leadership was convinced of the need to accept a globalized capitalism and join forces with the middle classes, who were often hostile to the Unions&quot;, therefore shaping policy direction. New Labour offered a middle way between the neoliberal market economics of the New Right which it saw as economically efficient; and the ethical reformism of post-1945 Labour which shared New Labour&#x27;s concern for social justice. New Labour&#x27;s ideology departed with its traditional beliefs in achieving social justice on behalf of the working class through mass collectivism. Blair was influenced by ethical and Christian socialist views and used these to cast what some consider a modern form of socialism or liberal socialism.

=== Social justice ===
New Labour tended to emphasise social justice rather than the equality which was the focus of previous Labour governments and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive. The party&#x27;s traditional attachment to equality was reduced as minimum standards and equality of opportunity were promoted over the equality of outcome. The Commission on Social Justice set up by John Smith reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the caveat that things should not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.

=== Economics ===
New Labour accepted the economic efficiency of markets and believed that they could be detached from capitalism to achieve the aims of socialism while maintaining the efficiency of capitalism. Markets were also useful for giving power to consumers and allowing citizens to make their own decisions and act responsibly. New Labour embraced market economics because they believed they could be used for their social aims as well as economic efficiency. The party did not believe that public ownership was efficient or desirable, ensuring that they were not seen to be ideologically pursuing centralised public ownership was important to the party. In government, the party relied on public-private partnerships and private finance initiatives to raise funds and mitigate fears of a tax and spend policy or excessive borrowing. New Labour maintained Conservative spending plans in their first two years in office and, during this time, Gordon Brown earned the reputation as an &quot;Iron Chancellor&quot; with his &quot;Golden Rule&quot; and conservative handling of the budget.

=== Welfare ===
Welfare reforms proposed by New Labour in their 2001 manifesto included Working Families Tax Credit, the National Childcare Strategy and the National Minimum Wage. Writing in &quot;Capital &amp; Class&quot;, Chris Grover argued that these policies were aimed at promoting work and that this position dominated New Labour&#x27;s position on welfare. He considered the view that New Labour&#x27;s welfare reforms were workfarist and argued that in this context it must refer to social policy being put in line with market economic growth. Gower proposed that under New Labour this position was consolidated through schemes to encourage work.

=== Crime ===
Parts of New Labour&#x27;s political philosophy linked crime with social exclusion and pursued policies to encourage partnerships between social and police authorities to lower crime rates whereas other areas of New Labour&#x27;s policy maintained a traditional approach to crime, Tony Blair&#x27;s approach to crime is quoted as being &#x27;tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime&#x27;. The first government under New Labour spent a smaller percentage of the budget on crime than the previous Tory government, however the second Labour government spent practically double (roughly 6.5% of the budget), Finally the third Labour government spent roughly the same percentage of the budget on crime as the first. Incidents of crime did drastically decrease under New Labour, from around 18,000 in 1995 to 11,000 in 2005–6, yet this doesn&#x27;t account for the decrease in police reports that occurred as well during this time.

The prison population in 2005 rose to over 76,000, mostly owing to the increasing length of sentences. Following the September 11 attacks, the Labour government attempted to emphasise counter-terrorism measures. From 2002, the government followed policies aimed at reducing anti-social behaviour; in the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act, New Labour introduced Anti-social behaviour orders. Under this Labour Government, the &#x27;7/7&#x27; bombings took place, the first Islamic suicide attack and most deadly since the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.

=== Multiculturalism ===
Controversy on the subject came to the fore when Andrew Neather—a former adviser to Jack Straw, Tony Blair and David Blunkett—said that Labour ministers had a hidden agenda in allowing mass immigration into Britain. This alleged conspiracy has become known by the sobriquet Neathergate.

According to Neather, who was present at closed meetings in 2000, a secret government report called for mass immigration to change Britain&#x27;s cultural make-up and that &quot;mass immigration was the way that the government was going to make the UK truly multicultural&quot;. Neather went on to say that &quot;the policy was intended—even if this wasn&#x27;t its main purpose—to rub the right&#x27;s nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date&quot;. Neather later stated that his words had been twisted, saying: &quot;The main goal was to allow in more migrant workers at a point when—hard as it is to imagine now—the booming economy was running up against skills shortages. [...] Somehow this has become distorted by excitable Right-wing newspaper columnists into being a &quot;plot&quot; to make Britain multicultural. There was no plot&quot;.

In February 2011, the then Prime Minister David Cameron stated that the &quot;doctrine of state multiculturalism&quot; (promoted by the previous Labour government) had failed and will no longer be state policy. He stated that the United Kingdom needed a stronger national identity and signalled a tougher stance on groups promoting Islamist extremism. However, official statistics showed that European Union and non-European Union mass immigration, together with asylum seeker applications, all increased substantially during Cameron&#x27;s term in office.

== Reception ==
Trade union activist and journalist Jimmy Reid wrote in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; in 2002 criticising New Labour for failing to promote or deliver equality. He argued that Labour&#x27;s pursuit of a &quot;dynamic market economy&quot; was a way of continuing the operation of a capitalist market economy which prevented governments from interfering to achieve social justice. Reid argued that the social agenda of Clement Attlee&#x27;s government was abandoned by Margaret Thatcher and not revived by New Labour. He criticised the party for not preventing inequality from widening and argued that New Labour&#x27;s ambition to win elections had moved the party towards the right. Many left-wing Labour members such as Arthur Scargill left the party because of New Labour&#x27;s emergence; however, New Labour attracted many from the centre and centre-right into its ranks. Underlining the significant ideological shifts that had taken place and indicating why the reception of New Labour was negative amongst traditional left-wing supporters, Lord Rothermere, the proprietor of &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;, defected to the Labour Party, stating: &quot;I joined New Labour because that was obviously the New Conservative party&quot;. When Thatcher was asked what her greatest achievement was, she stated, &quot;Tony Blair and New Labour&quot;. Tony Blair himself declared Thatcher to be a &quot;towering political figure&quot; of whom he said he wanted &quot;to build on some of the things she did rather than reverse them&quot;.

Warwick University politics lecturer Stephen Kettell criticised the behaviour of the leadership of New Labour and their use of threats in parliament such as overlooking promotions for MPs in order to maintain party support. While referring to the other parties in Westminster as well, he likened these MPs as &quot;little more than docile lobby-fodder for their respective oligarchies&quot;.

Although close to New Labour and a key figure in the development of the Third Way, sociologist Anthony Giddens dissociated himself from many of the interpretations of the Third Way made in the sphere of day-to-day politics. For him, it was not a succumbing to neoliberalism or the dominance of capitalist markets. The point was to get beyond both market fundamentalism and traditional top-down socialism—to make the values of the centre-left count in a globalising world. He argued that &quot;the regulation of financial markets is the single most pressing issue in the world economy&quot; and that &quot;global commitment to free trade depends upon effective regulation rather than dispenses with the need for it&quot;. In 2002, Giddens listed problems facing the New Labour government, naming spin as the biggest failure because its damage to the party&#x27;s image was difficult to rebound from. He also challenged the failure of the Millennium Dome project and Labour&#x27;s inability to deal with irresponsible businesses. Giddens saw Labour&#x27;s ability to marginalise the Conservative Party as a success as well its economic policy, welfare reform and certain aspects of education. Giddens criticised what he called Labour&#x27;s &quot;half-way houses&quot;, including the National Health Service and environmental and constitutional reform.

<text>Coronelism, from the term &quot;Coronelismo&quot; (), was the Brazilian political machine during the Old Republic (1889–1930), also known as the &quot;rule of the colonels&quot;, responsible for the centralization of political power in the hands of a locally dominant oligarch, known as a &quot;coronel&quot;, who would dispense favors in return for loyalty.

The patron-client political machines of the countryside enabled agrarian oligarchs, especially coffee planters in the dominant state of São Paulo, to dominate state structures to their advantage, particularly the weak central state structures that effectively devolved power to local agrarian oligarchies.

In time, growing trade, commerce, and industry in São Paulo state would serve to undermine the domination of the republic&#x27;s politics by the São Paulo landed gentry (dominated by the coffee industry) and Minas Gerais (another major coffee producing state, but noted for the size of its dairy industry)—known then by observers as the coffee with milk (&quot;café com leite)&quot; politics. Under Getúlio Vargas, Brazil moved toward a more centralized state structure that has served to regularize and modernize state governments, moving toward universal suffrage and secret ballots, gradually freeing Brazilian politics from the grips of &quot;coronelismo&quot;. However, the legacy of the oligarchies is still strongly visible in what is described as Neo-Coronelism or electronic coronelism. Brazilian politics is still known for being highly patrimonial, oligarchic, and personalistic.

<text>Cangaço () was a phenomenon of Northeast Brazil in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This region of Brazil is known for its aridness and hard way of life, and in a form of &quot;social banditry&quot; against the government, many men and women decided to become nomadic bandits, roaming the hinterlands seeking money, food, and revenge.

==Origin of the word==
By 1834, the term &quot;cangaceiro&quot; was already used to refer to bands of poor peasants who inhabited the northeastern deserts, wearing leather clothing and hats, carrying carbines, revolvers, shotguns, and the long narrow knife known as the .

&quot;Cangaceiro&quot; was a pejorative expression, meaning a person who could not adapt himself to the coastal lifestyle.

==Types of banditry==

By the mid-19th century in that region, there were two main groups of loosely organized armed outlaws: the &quot;jagunços&quot;, mercenaries who worked for whoever paid their price, usually land-owners who wanted to protect or expand their territorial limits and also deal with farm workers; and the cangaceiros, &quot;social bandits&quot;, who had some level of support from the poorest population. The 1920s and 1930s saw the height of cangaceiro activity, with the most prominent bands numbering up to as many as 100 bandits. The bandits often behaved well to the poorer sections of society, performing acts of charity, buying goods for higher than usual prices from small shopkeepers and giving free parties (&quot;bailes&quot;). In contrast, the wealthy were robbed, targeted for forced monetary contributions (extortion) and were often kidnapped and held to ransom. The cangaceiro bands were sheltered by helpers within the population, who also provided information which helped them escape from police forces, known as volantes, sent by the government to destroy them. The poorer inhabitants of the backlands of the Brazilian Northeast were generally badly treated by the paramilitary police, and often preferred the presence of cangaceiro bands in their settlements.

==Lampião==
The most famous cangaceiro of them all, the one who is often associated with the whole history of the cangaço, was a man called Virgulino Ferreira da Silva, also known as &quot;Lampião&quot; (&quot;Oil Lamp&quot;, because, he could fire a lever-action rifle so quickly that it looked like he was holding a lamp). He began when he was just a boy, amongst vendetta plots of the Pereira and Nogueira-Carvalho families. When his parents were killed because of these disputes, some of his brothers ran away, but Antônio, Livino, and Ezequiel followed Virgulino into the cangaço.

Seen as a mixture of hero and bandit, Lampião became one of the most representative icons of the Northeastern region.

Wandering around Santa Brígida, in the state of Bahia, he met Maria Alia da Silva (a.k.a. Maria de Déia), wife of shoemaker Zé de Nenê. Later she would be better known as Mrs. Lampião, Maria Bonita (literally &quot;Pretty Maria&quot;).

Lampião was killed by the police in 1938, in Sergipe, next to the state limits of Sergipe and Alagoas, when an informer, Joca Bernardes, gave away their location to the police. A massive offensive led to bloodshed, and eleven members of the band were killed: Lampião, Maria Bonita, Luís Pedro, Mergulhão, Enedina, Elétrico, Quinta-Feira, Moeda, Alecrim, Colchete and Macela. Forty others in the band managed to escape.

==Coiteiros==
Coiteiros were people who helped the cangaceiros, giving them shelter and food. They did this for many reasons – they could be relatives of a cangaceiro, friends, ex-neighbours, simply had some interest in their power, or were afraid of them.

==Volantes and monkeys==
The volantes were a small and special band of troops—around twenty to sixty—from every state of the Brazilian federation, formed by the government law-enforcement agencies sent to seek and destroy the cangaceiros. The cangaceiros often referred to them as &quot;monkeys&quot;, because of their brown uniforms and their willingness to obey their superiors&#x27; orders. Some of them carried modern Hotchkiss machine guns, weapons that the cangaceiros quickly learned to fear—but were always willing to steal for their own use.

==Cangaceiro style==

The cangaceiros had very specific notions of how to behave and dress. First of all, most of them knew how to sew quite well. Living in the desert lands of the northeast of Brazil, they had to survive amidst spiky dry bushes. Despite the heat during the day, the cangaceiros preferred to wear leather clothing, embellished with all kinds of coloured ribbons and metal pieces.

They also used leather gloves with coins and other pieces of metal sewn onto them, almost like armour but with decorative purposes.

Because of the heat and the absence of water, some cangaceiros -–especially Lampião-– wore French perfume. They often stole it from rich people&#x27;s houses, but usually paid for it if obtained from small shopkeepers, and used it in large quantities.
==Cangaceiro weapons==
The weapons of the Cangaceiros were mostly Mauser bolt-action and Winchester-like lever-action rifles, revolvers and the famous &quot;&quot;pára belo&quot;. It is claimed that like &#x27;macaco&#x27; (monkey), &#x27;belo&#x27; (beautiful) was another slang term for the policemen. Hence, pistols were called &quot;pára belo&quot;&quot; (belo &quot;stopper&quot;). However, the name seems to be actually a derivation of the Latin expression &quot;para bellum&quot;, which means &quot;prepare for war&quot; and was used to refer to the then official sidearm used by the Brazilian governmental troops and by some of the law enforcement soldiers, the Luger pistol, which was produced by the German arms maker DWM.

They also made famous a thin, long, and very sharp knife nicknamed a &quot;peixeira&quot;, a fish-filleting knife, used mostly to torture or slit the throats of their victims. The knife was also used in a very specific way to kill quickly; the blade was stabbed downwards between the neck and collarbone. Due to its length, the blade would cause instantly lethal damage to major blood vessels and the heart.

<doc id="207383" wikidata="Q1939618" url="?curid=207383" title="Put option">
<text>In finance, a put or put option is a derivative instrument in financial markets that gives the holder (i.e. the purchaser of the put option) the right to sell an asset (the &quot;underlying&quot;), at a specified price (the &quot;strike&quot;), by (or on) a specified date (the &quot;expiry&quot; or &quot;maturity&quot;) to the &quot;writer&quot; (i.e. seller) of the put. The purchase of a put option is interpreted as a negative sentiment about the future value of the underlying stock. The term &quot;put&quot; comes from the fact that the owner has the right to &quot;put up for sale&quot; the stock or index.

Puts may also be combined with other derivatives as part of more complex investment strategies, and in particular, may be useful for hedging. Holding a European put option is equivalent to holding the corresponding call option and selling an appropriate forward contract. This equivalence is called &quot;put-call parity&quot;.

Put options are most commonly used in the stock market to protect against a fall in the price of a stock below a specified price. If the price of the stock declines below the strike price, the holder of the put has the right, but not the obligation, to sell the asset at the strike price, while the seller of the put has the obligation to purchase the asset at the strike price if the owner uses the right to do so (the holder is said to &quot;exercise&quot; the option). In this way the buyer of the put will receive at least the strike price specified, even if the asset is currently worthless.

If the strike is , and at time the value of the underlying is , then in an &quot;American option&quot; the buyer can exercise the put for a payout of any time until the option&#x27;s maturity date . The put yields a positive return only if the underlying price falls below the strike when the option is exercised. A &quot;European option&quot; can only be exercised at time rather than at any time until , and a &quot;Bermudan option&quot; can be exercised only on specific dates listed in the terms of the contract. If the option is not exercised by maturity, it expires worthless. (The buyer will not usually exercise the option at an allowable date if the price of the underlying is greater than .)

The most obvious use of a put option is as a type of insurance. In the protective put strategy, the investor buys enough puts to cover their holdings of the underlying so that if the price of the underlying falls sharply, they can still sell it at the strike price. Another use is for speculation: an investor can take a short position in the underlying stock without trading in it directly.

== Instrument models ==
The terms for exercising the option&#x27;s right to sell it differ depending on option style. A European put option allows the holder to exercise the put option for a short period of time right before expiration, while an American put option allows exercise at any time before expiration.

The most widely traded put options are on stocks/equities, but they are traded on many other instruments such as interest rates (see interest rate floor) or commodities.

The put buyer either believes that the underlying asset&#x27;s price will fall by the exercise date or hopes to protect a long position in it. The advantage of buying a put over short selling the asset is that the option owner&#x27;s risk of loss is limited to the premium paid for it, whereas the asset short seller&#x27;s risk of loss is unlimited (its price can rise greatly, in fact, in theory it can rise infinitely, and such a rise is the short seller&#x27;s loss). The put buyer&#x27;s prospect (risk) of gain is limited to the option&#x27;s strike price less the underlying&#x27;s spot price and the premium/fee paid for it.

The put &#x27;writer&#x27; believes that the underlying security&#x27;s price will rise, not fall. The writer sells the put to collect the premium. The put writer&#x27;s total potential loss is limited to the put&#x27;s strike price less the spot and premium already received. Puts can be used also to limit the writer&#x27;s portfolio risk and may be part of an options spread.

The put buyer/owner is short on the underlying asset of the put, but long on the put option itself. That is, the buyer wants the value of the put option to increase by a decline in the price of the underlying asset below the strike price. The writer (seller) of a put is long on the underlying asset and short on the put option itself. That is, the seller wants the option to become worthless by an increase in the price of the underlying asset above the strike price. Generally, a put option that is purchased is referred to as a long put and a put option that is sold is referred to as a short put.

A naked put, also called an &quot;uncovered put&quot;, is a put option whose writer (the seller) does not have a position in the underlying stock or other instrument. This strategy is best used by investors who want to accumulate a position in the underlying stock, but only if the price is low enough. If the buyer fails to exercise the options, then the writer keeps the option premium.
If the underlying stock&#x27;s market price is below the option&#x27;s strike price when expiration arrives, the option owner (buyer) can exercise the put option, forcing the writer to buy the underlying stock at the strike price. That allows the exerciser (buyer) to profit from the difference between the stock&#x27;s market price and the option&#x27;s strike price. But if the stock&#x27;s market price is above the option&#x27;s strike price at the end of expiration day, the option expires worthless, and the owner&#x27;s loss is limited to the premium (fee) paid for it (the writer&#x27;s profit).

The seller&#x27;s potential loss on a naked put can be substantial. If the stock falls all the way to zero (bankruptcy), his loss is equal to the strike price (at which he must buy the stock to cover the option) minus the premium received. The potential upside is the premium received when selling the option: if the stock price is above the strike price at expiration, the option seller keeps the premium, and the option expires worthless. During the option&#x27;s lifetime, if the stock moves lower, the option&#x27;s premium may increase (depending on how far the stock falls and how much time passes). If it does, it becomes more costly to close the position (repurchase the put, sold earlier), resulting in a loss. If the stock price completely collapses before the put position is closed, the put writer potentially can face catastrophic loss. In order to protect the put buyer from default, the put writer is required to post margin. The put buyer does not need to post margin because the buyer would not exercise the option if it had a negative payoff.

==Example of a put option on a stock==

=== Buying a put ===
A buyer thinks the price of a stock will decrease. They pay a premium that they will never get back, unless it is sold before it expires. The buyer has the right to sell the stock at the strike price.

=== Writing a put ===
The writer receives a premium from the buyer. If the buyer exercises their option, the writer will buy the stock at the strike price. If the buyer does not exercise their option, the writer&#x27;s profit is the premium.

*&quot;Trader A&quot; (Put Buyer) purchases a put contract to sell 100 shares of XYZ Corp. to &quot;Trader B&quot; (Put Writer) for $50 per share. The current price is $50 per share, and Trader A pays a premium of $5 per share. If the price of XYZ stock falls to $40 a share right before expiration, then Trader A can exercise the put by buying 100 shares for $4,000 from the stock market, then selling them to Trader B for $5,000.

:Trader A&#x27;s total earnings &quot;S&quot; can be calculated at $500. The sale of the 100 shares of stock at a strike price of $50 to Trader B = $5,000 (&quot;P&quot;). The purchase of 100 shares of stock at $40 = $4,000 (&quot;Q&quot;). The put option premium paid to Trader B for buying the contract of 100 shares at $5 per share, excluding commissions = $500 (&quot;R)&quot;). Thus

:&quot;S&quot; = (&quot;P&quot; − &quot;Q&quot;) − &quot;R&quot; = ($5,000 − $4,000) − $500 = $500

*If, however, the share price never drops below the strike price (in this case, $50), then Trader A would not exercise the option (because selling a stock to Trader B at $50 would cost Trader A more than that to buy it). Trader A&#x27;s option would be worthless and he would have lost the whole investment, the fee (premium) for the option contract, $500 ($5 per share, 100 shares per contract). Trader A&#x27;s total loss is limited to the cost of the put premium plus the sales commission to buy it.

A put option is said to have intrinsic value when the underlying instrument has a spot price (&quot;S&quot;) &quot;below&quot; the option&#x27;s strike price (&quot;K&quot;). Upon exercise, a put option is valued at K-S if it is &quot;in-the-money&quot;, otherwise its value is zero. Prior to exercise, an option has time value apart from its intrinsic value. The following factors reduce the time value of a put option: shortening of the time to expire, decrease in the volatility of the underlying, and increase of interest rates. Option pricing is a central problem of financial mathematics.

<doc id="207384" wikidata="Q2140232" url="?curid=207384" title="Microquasar">
<text>A microquasar, a smaller version of a quasar, is a compact region surrounding a stellar black hole with a mass several times that of its companion star, observable in sufficient details, in our own or nearby galaxy. The matter being pulled from the companion star forms an accretion disk around the black hole. This accretion disk may become so hot, due to friction, that it begins to emit X-rays. The disk also projects narrow streams or &quot;jets&quot; of subatomic particles at near-light speed, generating a strong radio wave emission.

==Overview==
In 1979, SS 433, in our own galaxy, became the first microquasar to be discovered, when Margon et al. observed its relativistic jets. It was thought to be the most exotic case until similar objects such as GRS 1915+105 were confirmed in 1994.

In some cases, blobs or &quot;knots&quot; of brighter plasma within the jets appear to be traveling faster than the speed of light, an optical illusion called superluminal motion which is caused by sub-light-speed particles being projected at a small angle relative to the observer.

The 1996 Bruno Rossi Prize of the American Astronomical Society was awarded to Felix Mirabel and Luis Rodríguez for their discovery of the superluminal motion of radio knots in GRS 1915+105, as well as the discovery of double-sided radio jets from galactic sources 1E1740.7-2942 and GRS 1758-258.

Due to the smaller size of microquasars, many of the effects are scaled differently in relation to normal quasars. In quasars, the mean temperature of the accretion disk is several thousand degrees, while in a microquasar the mean temperature is several million degrees. The average size of the accretion disk of a quasar is , whereas in microquasars the average size is only . Quasars can project jets up to several million light-years, whereas microquasars can project them only a few light-years; however, the &quot;knots&quot; within the jets of microquasars can exhibit a proper motion (angular motion across the sky) on the order of a thousand times faster than that of knots within a quasar jet because observed microquasars (being within the Milky Way galaxy) are at typical distances on the order of kiloparsecs, rather than hundreds of megaparsecs to several gigaparsecs.

<doc id="207387" wikidata="Q1183706" url="?curid=207387" title="Put–call parity">
<text>In financial mathematics, the put–call parity defines a relationship between the price of a European call option and European put option, both with the identical strike price and expiry, namely that a portfolio of a long call option and a short put option is equivalent to (and hence has the same value as) a single forward contract at this strike price and expiry. This is because if the price at expiry is above the strike price, the call will be exercised, while if it is below, the put will be exercised, and thus in either case one unit of the asset will be purchased for the strike price, exactly as in a forward contract.

The validity of this relationship requires that certain assumptions be satisfied; these are specified and the relationship is derived below. In practice transaction costs and financing costs (leverage) mean this relationship will not exactly hold, but in liquid markets the relationship is close to exact.

==Assumptions==
Put–call parity is a static replication, and thus requires minimal assumptions, of a forward contract. In the absence of traded forward contracts, the forward contract can be replaced (indeed, itself replicated) by the ability to buy the underlying asset and finance this by borrowing for fixed term (e.g., borrowing bonds), or conversely to borrow and sell (short) the underlying asset and loan the received money for term, in both cases yielding a self-financing portfolio.

These assumptions do not require any transactions between the initial date and expiry, and are thus significantly weaker than those of the Black–Scholes model, which requires dynamic replication and continual transaction in the underlying.

Replication assumes one can enter into derivative transactions, which requires leverage (and capital costs to back this), and buying and selling entails transaction costs, notably the bid–ask spread. The relationship thus only holds exactly in an ideal frictionless market with unlimited liquidity. However, real world markets may be sufficiently liquid that the relationship is close to exact, most significantly FX markets in major currencies or major stock indices, in the absence of market turbulence.

==Statement==
Put–call parity can be stated in a number of equivalent ways, most tersely as:
where formula_1 is the (current) value of a call, formula_2 is the (current) value of a put, formula_3 is the discount factor, formula_4 is the forward price of the underlying asset, and formula_5 is the strike price. The left side corresponds to a portfolio of a long call and a short put; the right side corresponds to a forward contract. The assets formula_1 and formula_2 on the left side are given in present values, while the assets formula_4 and formula_5 are given in future values (forward price of asset, and strike price paid at expiry), which the discount factor formula_3 converts to present values.

Now the spot price formula_11 can be obtained by discounting the forward price formula_4 by the factor formula_3. Using spot price formula_14 instead of forward price formula_4 gives us:

Rearranging the terms gives a first interpretation:
Here the left-hand side is a fiduciary call, which is a long call and enough cash (or bonds) to exercise it by paying the strike price. The right-hand side is a Married put, which is a long put paired with the asset, so that the asset can be sold at the strike price on exercise. At expiry, the intrinsic value of options vanish so both sides have payoff formula_16 equal to at least the strike price formula_5 or the value formula_14 of the asset if higher.

That a long call with cash is equivalent to a long put with asset is one meaning of put-call parity.

Rearranging the terms another way gives us a second interpretation:
Now the left-hand side is a cash-secured put, that is, a short put and enough cash to give the put owner should they exercise it. The right-hand side is a covered call, which is a short call paired with the asset, where the asset stands ready to be called away by the call owner should they exercise it. At expiry, the previous scenario is flipped. Both sides now have payoff formula_19 equal to either the strike price formula_5 or the value formula_14 of the asset, whichever is &quot;lower&quot;.

So we see that put-call parity can also be understood as the equivalence of a cash-secured (short) put and a covered (short) call. This may be surprising as selling a cash-secured put is typically seen as riskier than selling a covered call.

To make explicit the time-value of cash and the time-dependence of financial variables, the original put-call parity equation can be stated as:
where
:formula_22 is the value of the call at time formula_23,
:formula_24 is the value of the put of the same expiration date,
:formula_25 is the spot price of the underlying asset,
:formula_5 is the strike price, and
:formula_27 is the present value of a zero-coupon bond that matures to $1 at time formula_28, that is, the discount factor for formula_29

Note that the right-hand side of the equation is also the price of buying a forward contract on the stock with delivery price formula_5. Thus one way to read the equation is that a portfolio that is long a call and short a put is the same as being long a forward. In particular, if the underlying is not tradable but there exists forwards on it, we can replace the right-hand-side expression by the price of a forward.

If the bond interest rate, formula_31, is assumed to be constant then

Note: formula_31 refers to the force of interest, which is approximately equal to the effective annual rate for small interest rates. However, one should take care with the approximation, especially with larger rates and larger time periods. To find formula_31 exactly, use formula_34, where formula_35 is the effective annual interest rate.

When valuing European options written on stocks with known dividends that will be paid out during the life of the option, the formula becomes:

where formula_36 represents the total value of the dividends from one stock share to be paid out over the remaining life of the options, discounted to present value.
We can rewrite the equation as:

and note that the right-hand side is the price of a forward contract on the stock with delivery price formula_5, as before.

==Derivation==
We will suppose that the put and call options are on traded stocks, but the underlying can be any other tradeable asset. The ability to buy and sell the underlying is crucial to the &quot;no arbitrage&quot; argument below.

First, note that under the assumption that there are no arbitrage opportunities (the prices are arbitrage-free), two portfolios that always have the same payoff at time T must have the same value at any prior time. To prove this suppose that, at some time &quot;t&quot; before &quot;T&quot;, one portfolio were cheaper than the other. Then one could purchase (go long) the cheaper portfolio and sell (go short) the more expensive one. At time &quot;T&quot;, this long/short portfolio excluding cash would, for any value of the share price, have zero value (all the assets and liabilities have canceled out). The cash profit we made at time &quot;t&quot; is thus a riskless profit, but this violates our assumption of no arbitrage.

We will derive the put-call parity relation by creating two portfolios with the same payoffs (static replication) and invoking the above principle (rational pricing).

Consider a call option and a put option with the same strike &quot;K&quot; for expiry at the same date &quot;T&quot; on some stock &quot;S&quot;, which pays no dividend. We assume the existence of a bond that pays 1 dollar at maturity time &quot;T&quot;. The bond price may be random (like the stock) but must equal 1 at maturity.

Let the price of &quot;S&quot; be S(t) at time t. Now assemble a portfolio by buying a call option &quot;C&quot; and selling a put option &quot;P&quot; of the same maturity &quot;T&quot; and strike &quot;K&quot;. The payoff for this portfolio is &quot;S(T) - K&quot;. Now assemble a second portfolio by buying one share and borrowing &quot;K&quot; bonds. Note the payoff of the latter portfolio is also &quot;S(T) - K&quot; at time &quot;T&quot;, since our share bought for &quot;S(t)&quot; will be worth &quot;S(T)&quot; and the borrowed bonds will be worth &quot;K&quot;.

By our preliminary observation that identical payoffs imply that both portfolios must have the same price at a general time formula_23, the following relationship exists between the value of the various instruments:

Thus given no arbitrage opportunities, the above relationship, which is known as put-call parity, holds, and for any three prices of the call, put, bond and stock one can compute the implied price of the fourth.

In the case of dividends, the modified formula can be derived in similar manner to above, but with the modification that one portfolio consists of going long a call, going short a put, and going long &quot;D(T)&quot; bonds that each pay 1 dollar at maturity &quot;T&quot; (the bonds will be worth &quot;D(t)&quot; at time &quot;t&quot;); the other portfolio is the same as before - long one share of stock, short &quot;K&quot; bonds that each pay 1 dollar at &quot;T&quot;. The difference is that at time &quot;T&quot;, the stock is not only worth &quot;S(T)&quot; but has paid out &quot;D(T)&quot; in dividends.

==History==
Forms of put-call parity appeared in practice as early as medieval ages, and was formally described by a number of authors in the early 20th century.

Michael Knoll, in &quot;The Ancient Roots of Modern Financial Innovation: The Early History of Regulatory Arbitrage&quot;, describes the important role that put-call parity played in developing the equity of redemption, the defining characteristic of a modern mortgage, in medieval England.

In the 19th century, financier Russell Sage used put-call parity to create synthetic loans, which had higher interest rates than the usury laws of the time would have normally allowed.

Nelson, an option arbitrage trader in New York, published a book: &quot;The A.B.C. of Options and Arbitrage&quot; in 1904 that describes the put-call parity in detail. His book was re-discovered by Espen Gaarder Haug in the early 2000s and many references from Nelson&#x27;s book are given in Haug&#x27;s book &quot;Derivatives Models on Models&quot;.

Henry Deutsch describes the put-call parity in 1910 in his book &quot;Arbitrage in Bullion, Coins, Bills, Stocks, Shares and Options, 2nd Edition&quot;. London: Engham Wilson but in less detail than Nelson (1904).

Mathematics professor Vinzenz Bronzin also derives the put-call parity in 1908 and uses it as part of his arbitrage argument to develop a series of mathematical option models under a series of different distributions. The work of professor Bronzin was just recently rediscovered by professor Wolfgang Hafner and professor Heinz Zimmermann. The original work of Bronzin is a book written in German and is now translated and published in English in an edited work by Hafner and Zimmermann (&quot;Vinzenz Bronzin&#x27;s option pricing models&quot;, Springer Verlag).

Its first description in the modern academic literature appears to be by Hans R. Stoll in the &quot;Journal of Finance&quot;. 

==Implications==
Put–call parity implies:

* &quot;Equivalence of calls and puts&quot;: Parity implies that a call and a put can be used interchangeably in any delta-neutral portfolio. If formula_39 is the call&#x27;s delta, then buying a call, and selling formula_39 shares of stock, is the same as selling a put at the same strike and selling formula_41 shares of stock. Equivalence of calls and puts is very important when trading options.
* &quot;Parity of implied volatility&quot;: In the absence of dividends or other costs of carry (such as when a stock is difficult to borrow or sell short), the implied volatility of calls and puts must be identical.

<doc id="207388" wikidata="Q143742" url="?curid=207388" title="Cerkno">
<text>Cerkno (; ; ) is a small town in the Littoral region of Slovenia.
It has around 2,000 inhabitants and is the administrative centre of the Cerkno Hills. It is the seat of the Municipality of Cerkno.

Cerkno is a small but important local cultural center in the traditional Littoral region near Idrija. It is known for the &quot;Laufarija&quot; carnival, a spring festival with carved wooden masks; for Franja Partisan Hospital (&quot;Partizanska bolnica Franja&quot;); for a Partisan hospital from World War II; and as a ski resort.

==Name==
Cerkno was attested in written records in 1257 as &quot;Curchinitz&quot; (and as &quot;Chyrchayn&quot; in 1299, &quot;Circhinç&quot; in 1337, and &quot;Circhiniz&quot; in 1486). The modern Slovene name is an ellipsis of &quot;*Cerьkъvьno (selo/polje)&quot;; literally, &#x27;church (village/field)&#x27;. The medieval attestations of the name indicate that the settlement was also once called &quot;Cerknica&quot;. The name indicates that the place was formerly a church property.

==History==
Historically, the Cerkno Hills belonged to Tolmin County. In the 16th century, the area came under Habsburg rule, and was included in the County of Gorizia and Gradisca. After the end of World War I, the area was occupied by the Italian Army, and then officially annexed to Italy in 1920. Between 1920 and 1943, it was part of the administrative region known as the Julian March. After the Italian armistice in September 1943, Cerkno was liberated by the Yugoslav Partisans and became one of the most important centres of Partisan resistance in the Slovenian Littoral.

===Mass grave===

Cerkno is the site of a mass grave associated with the Second World War. The Lajše Mass Grave () is located south of the town, in a shaft on the edge of the woods on the eastern slope of Lajše Hill. It contains the remains of 14 civilian victims (one escaped) that were suspected of anti-communist activity and were murdered on 6 February 1944 by the Partisans. They were killed in revenge for an attack on a Communist Party training school in Cerkno on 27 January 1944 that left 47 dead.

==Churches==

The parish church in the town is dedicated to Saint Anne and belongs to the Diocese of Koper. The church consist of a rectangular presbytery, a wide rectangular nave, and a belfry north of the front wall. The church dates from 1714 and has been attributed to the builder Matija Maček (c. 1657–1737) from the Poljane Valley. A second church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Bartholomew.

==Notable people==
Notable people that were born or lived in Cerkno include:
*France Bevk (1890–1970), writer
* (1854–1931), Archbishop of Gorizia
*Milica Kacin-Wohinz (1930–2021), historian
* (born 1947), historian
*Franc Močnik (1814–1892), mathematician
*Janez Podobnik (born 1959), politician
* (born 1960), politician
*Rafael Podobnik (born 1942), photographer

<text>The loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus) is a passerine bird in the family Laniidae. It is the only member of the shrike family endemic to North America; the related northern shrike (&quot;L. borealis&quot;) occurs north of its range, however it is also found in Siberia. It is nicknamed the butcherbird after its carnivorous tendencies, as it consumes prey such as insects, amphibians, lizards, small mammals and small birds, and some prey end up displayed and stored at a site, for example in a tree. Due to its small size and weak talons, this predatory bird relies on impaling its prey upon thorns or barbed wire for facilitated consumption. The numbers of loggerhead shrike have significantly decreased in recent years, especially in Midwestern, New England and Mid-Atlantic areas.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the loggerhead shrike in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in Louisiana in the United States. He used the French name &quot;La pie-griesche de la Louisiane&quot; and the Latin &quot;Lanius ludovicianus&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not usually conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the loggerhead shrike. Linnaeus included a brief description, adopted the binomial name &quot;Lanius ludovicianus&quot; (identical to Brisson&#x27;s Latin name) and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The specific name &quot;ludovic&quot; is Late Latin for &quot;Louis&quot; and the epithet &quot;-ianus&quot; is to describe something being of another or possessed by it. When translated, its scientific name means something alongside the lines of &quot;Louis’ butcher&quot;. &quot;Loggerhead,&quot; a similar word to &quot;blockhead,&quot; refers to the unusually large head to body ratio of this bird.

There are seven recognized subspecies:

* &quot;L. l. excubitorides&quot; Swainson, 1832 – central Canada, central and west USA
* &quot;L. l. migrans&quot; Palmer, W, 1898 – east North America
* &quot;L. l. ludovicianus&quot; Linnaeus, 1766 – coastal southeast USA
* &quot;L. l. anthonyi&quot; Mearns, 1898 – Channel Islands (off south California, southwest USA)
* &quot;L. l. mearnsi&quot; Ridgway, 1903 – San Clemente Island (off south California, southwest USA)
* &quot;L. l. grinnelli&quot; Oberholser, 1919 – extreme south California and north Baja California (northwest Mexico)
* &quot;L. l. mexicanus&quot; Brehm, CL, 1854 – west and central Mexico, south Baja California (northwest Mexico)

Miller, in 1931, suggested that the wing-chord-to-tail-length ratio was an important indicator for distinguishing between subspecies. 
&quot;Lanius ludovicianus migrans&quot;, found in eastern North America, can be distinguished from the western subspecies, &quot;L. l. excubitorides&quot; by wing length, tail length, and colour. &quot;L. l. migrans&quot; have a paler forehead than the top of the head.
According to Mundy et al.’s 1997 study, there is a substantial genetic difference between the island subspecies &quot;L. l. mearnsi&quot; and the mainland subspecies &quot;L. l. gambeli&quot; due to a gene flow barrier between the two species.

==Description==
The loggerhead shrike is a medium-sized passerine. &quot;Loggerhead&quot; refers to the relatively large size of the head as compared to the rest of the body. The wing and tail length are about and long, respectively. It weighs on average , with a range of for a healthy adult shrike.

;Measurement ranges
* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

The adult plumage of the loggerhead shrike is grey above with a white to pale grey breast and black tarsi and feet. The bird possesses a black mask that extends across the eyes to its bill. The wings are black with a distinct white patch on the primaries. The tail is black edged with white and the irises are brown. The beak is short, black, and hooked, and contains a tomial tooth to help tear into prey. It is difficult to sex an adult loggerhead shrike in the field as they are sexually monochromatic. However, several studies have reported sexual dimorphism in plumage and size traits. Juveniles possess a paler gray plumage that is subtly vermiculated.

The loggerhead shrike can be distinguished from the northern shrike by its smaller size, darker grey plumage, and larger black face mask that covers the eye completely. It also has a shorter bill with less prominent hook. Their calls are similar.

===Vocalization===

Their vocal range is broad and varied, and has been described as harsh and jarring. The shrike&#x27;s notes include squeaky whistles, shrill trills, and guttural warbles. The trills sung by males during breeding season vary in rhythm and pitch. When alarmed, a shrike will produce a &quot;schgra-a-a&quot; shriek while spreading out its tail feathers. A distinctive alarm call is often given when threats from above are detected. Nestlings will make &quot;tcheek&quot; and &quot;tsp&quot; sounds shortly after hatching. During courtship feedings, females may ask for food with &quot;mak&quot; begging notes; conversely, males emit &quot;wuut&quot; or &quot;shack&quot; sounds to offer food. The male emits a territorial, harsh shriek, while the female&#x27;s song is pitched lower and softer than the male&#x27;s. Generally, the male is far more vocal than the female.

==Distribution and habitat==

Loggerhead shrikes were once widely distributed across southern Canada, the contiguous USA and Mexico. However, their populations have heavily declined since the 1960s. Four subspecies reside in southern coastal California: &quot;mearnsi, gambeli, grinnelli&quot; and &quot;anthonyi&quot;. &quot;L. l. mearnsi&quot; is only found on San Clemente Island in California, whereas &quot;L. l. gambeli&quot; breeds on the mainland and &quot;L. l. anthonyi&quot; breeds on the Channel Islands. &quot;L. l. excubitorides&quot; is found in central North America, whereas the non-migrating &quot;L. l. ludovicianus&quot; resides in southeastern North America. The distribution of &quot;L. l. migrans&quot; ranges from north to eastern North America; however, its range has been diminishing since the 1940s.
The bird requires an open habitat with an area to forage, elevated perches, and nesting sites. They are often found in open pastures or grasslands and appear to prefer red-cedar and hawthorn trees for nesting. The hawthorn&#x27;s thorns and the cedar&#x27;s pin-like needles protect and conceal the shrike from predators. It may also nest in fence-rows or hedge-rows near open pastures and requires elevated perches as lookout points for hunting. Open pastures and grasslands with shorter vegetation are preferred by loggerhead shrikes, as they increase the bird&#x27;s hunting efficiency. Longer vegetation often requires more time and energy to be spent searching for prey, so these birds gravitate towards areas of shorter vegetation.

==Behavior==
===Diet===
Loggerhead shrikes have been repeatedly observed killing prey larger than themselves by spearing the neck or head of the animal and twisting. The speed at which this occurs causes a whiplash injury to the animal. The neck strength of the shrikes compensates, making their talon weakness inconsequential.

Although loggerhead shrikes are passerines, they are a predatory species that hunt during the day. They primarily eat insects, but also consume arachnids, reptiles, amphibians, rodents, bats and small birds. They have even eaten venomous snakes such as the water adder. The size of prey ranges from insects to mice or reptiles.

They are not true birds of prey, as they lack the large, strong talons used to catch and kill prey. Instead, they are sit-and-wait hunters that stalk prey by hawking and diving from elevated perches. By scanning their vicinity from a perch instead of flying, the shrike does not exhaust its energy during the search. Preferred perches are approximately off the ground, and are usually outer branches of trees or telephone wires. In winter, prey availability is low due to the shrike&#x27;s preference for insects and poikilothermic prey; during this time, shrikes may be energetically stressed and underweight. Insects are consumed in mid-flight, but vertebrates usually require more handling time and therefore more energy. Due to the shrike&#x27;s small size in proportion to the size of its prey, it must rely on specialized adaptations to facilitate its hunting. The powerful, hooked beak of the loggerhead shrike allows it to sever the neck of a small vertebrate. Larger prey are subjected to impaling, in which they are pushed down into a sharp projection, such as a thorn or barbed wire. The bird can then tear off flesh by using the projection as an anchor. The shrike may also use the thorn to fasten and store its food to return to at a later time.

The motion of impalement appears to be instinctive, as parent shrikes do not demonstrate the behavior to their nestlings. However, a young shrike must experience impaling prey upon an actual projection during a critical developmental period; otherwise, it will not learn to use the instinctive impaling action upon an actual projection. Kleptoparasitism has also been observed in nature, in which the shrike chased down another bird and stole its recently-caught prey.

===Reproduction===
Loggerhead shrikes are monogamous birds. However, males are known to begin second nesting attempts with a second female before his first clutch has fledged. They begin breeding during their first spring. During this time, the male performs a courtship ritual that occurs in flight. He dances erratically in the air, flying rapidly up and down and occasionally chasing the female. He presents himself to his potential mate by fanning out his tail and fluttering his wings. Females may respond to the fluttering display with begging notes, similar to those of juveniles begging for food; this encourages the male to feed her.

The bird breeds in semi-open areas in southern Ontario, Quebec, and the Canadian prairie provinces, south to Mexico. It nests in isolated or small clusters of dense trees and shrubs from near ground level to over 4m in height. There is an increase in average clutch size as latitude increases. Shrikes begin incubation after laying the second to last egg, resulting in asynchronous hatching. Incubation, on average, lasts 16 days. The female lays 4 to 8 eggs in a bulky cup made of twigs and grass. Once hatched, nestlings are fed by both the male and female parent. Average fledging period is about 19 days. Young may then remain nearby and dependent on adults for 3 to 4 weeks. After that, they begin to forage independently. Oftentimes, nestlings do not survive long past hatching. In the case of dead nestlings, adult shrikes may eat or discard their bodies or else feed them to their remaining young. The oldest recorded age of a loggerhead shrike was 12 years and 6 months.

==Conservation status==
Loggerhead shrike populations have been decreasing in North America since the 1960s. Reasons behind the decline remain unclear, although suggestions include habitat loss, pesticide contamination, and human disturbance. The eastern loggerhead shrike (&quot;L. l. migrans&quot;) is critically endangered in Canada, with fewer than 35 known breeding pairs in Canada. The San Clemente Island shrike, &quot;L. l. mearnsi&quot;, is critically endangered, with a population as low as 5–10 individuals during 1983–1988. Although only this island subspecies is legally listed as endangered in the United States, the species is declining continent-wide and no longer occurs in most of the northeastern U.S.; it is extirpated from every state in New England, as well as New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. A captive population was established at the Toronto Zoo and McGill University in 1997. In 2001, an experimental field breeding and release program managed by Wildlife Preservation Canada was established. &quot;Field breeding&quot; refers to moving captive pairs from their wintering cages at the Toronto Zoo and McGill to large enclosures within shrike habitat in Ontario where the pairs nest and raise their young. The young then are released to the wild when they&#x27;d naturally disperse from their parents. Since 2004, over 90 young have been released annually and between 2% and 6.5% of young released have successfully migrated and returned to breed in the subsequent year.

<doc id="207393" wikidata="Q744083" url="?curid=207393" title="Jump cut">
<text>A jump cut is a cut in film editing that breaks a single continuous sequential shot of a subject into two parts, with a piece of footage removed to create the effect of jumping forward in time. Camera positioning on the subject across the sequence should vary only slightly to achieve the effect. The technique manipulates temporal space using the duration of a single shot—fracturing the duration to move the audience ahead. This kind of cut abruptly communicates the passing of time, as opposed to the more seamless dissolve heavily used in films predating Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Breathless&quot;, which extensively used jump cuts and popularized the technique in the 1960s. For this reason, jump cuts are considered a violation of classical continuity editing, which aims to give the appearance of continuous time and space in the story-world by de-emphasizing editing, but are sometimes nonetheless used for creative purposes. Jump cuts tend to draw attention to the constructed nature of the film. More than one jump cut is sometimes used in a single sequence.

Continuity editing uses a guideline called the &quot;30-degree rule&quot; to avoid the appearance of jump cuts. The 30-degree rule advises that for consecutive shots to appear seamless and continuous in time, the camera position must vary at least 30 degrees from its previous position. Some schools would call for a change in framing as well (e.g., from a medium shot to a close up). The idea is to convey to the viewer a different point of view on the action but with the timeline of the action being continuous. Generally, if the camera position changes less than 30 degrees, the difference between the two shots is not substantial enough, and the viewer experiences the edit as a jump in the position of the subject rather than a change of point of view, which is jarring. 

Jump cuts, on the other hand, keep the camera&#x27;s relationship to the subject the same but jump forward in time in the action. Jump cuts can be created by editing together two shots filmed non-continuously (a &quot;spatial jump cut&quot;)—but can also be made by removing a middle section of one continuously filmed shot (a &quot;temporal jump cut&quot;). Jump cuts can add a sense of speed to the sequence of events.

== History ==

The effect was used in the early film &quot;The Tempest&quot; (1908) when Ariel magically disappears and reappears. Dziga Vertof&#x27;s &quot;avant-garde&quot; Russian film &quot;Man With a Movie Camera&quot; (1929) is almost entirely composed of jump cuts. Contemporary use of the jump cut largely stems from its appearance in the work of Jean-Luc Godard (at the suggestion of Jean-Pierre Melville) and other filmmakers of the French New Wave of the late 1950s and 1960s. In Godard&#x27;s ground-breaking &quot;Breathless&quot; (1960), for example, he with editor Cécile Decugis cut together shots of Jean Seberg riding in a convertible in such a way that emphasized the discontinuity between shots to create a deliberate jarring effect. In the clip above the scene abruptly changes perspective, emphasizing a gap in action. Jump cuts have appeared in films like &quot;Snatch&quot; by Guy Ritchie, and &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; by Tom Tykwer. It is frequently used in TV editing, in documentaries produced by Discovery Channel and National Geographic Channel, for example. It is noticeable in Universal Monsters films and music videos.

== Notable examples ==

The jump cut sometimes serves a political use in film. Some have used it as an alienating, Brechtian technique (the ) that makes the audience aware of the unreality of the film experience in order to focus attention on a political message rather than the drama or emotion of the narrative. This may be observed in some segments of Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;The Battleship Potemkin&quot;.

Alexander Dovzhenko&#x27; used jump cuts in &quot;Arsenal&quot; (Soviet Union, 1930), where a close-up shot of a character&#x27;s face cuts closer and closer a total of nine times. Mark Cousins comments that this &quot;fragmentation captured his indecision ... and confusion&quot;, adding that &quot;Although the effect jars, the idea of visual conflict was central to Soviet montage cinema of that time&quot;.

Jump cuts are sometimes used to show a nervous searching scene, as is done in the 2009 science fiction film &quot;Moon&quot; in which the protagonist, Sam Bell, is looking for a secret room on a Moon base, and &quot;District 9&quot; in which the protagonist, Wikus, searches for illegal objects in the house of Christopher&#x27;s friend.

Jump cuts plays a significant and disorienting role in a scene of Joel and Ethan Coen&#x27;s &quot;A Serious Man&quot;. They intersperse shots of Rabbi Nachtner and Larry Gopnik having a conversation in the Rabbi&#x27;s office with shots of an earlier meeting that Nachtner had with a different person in the same office.

In television, &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; editor Arthur Schneider won an Emmy Award in 1968 for his pioneering use of the jump cut. Jump cutting remained an uncommon TV technique until shows like &quot;&quot; popularized it on the small screen in the 1990s.

The music video for &quot;Everybody Have Fun Tonight&quot; makes extensive use of the jump cut.

Other uses of the jump cuts include Vincent Gallo&#x27;s short &quot;Flying Christ&quot; in which various shots of &quot;Christ&quot; jumping are cut together as he is in mid-jump, creating the illusion of flight, and in many vlogs online, as popularized by the show with zefrank.

British comedian Russell Kane has produced a series of comic, satirical videos, named &quot;Kaneings&quot;, in response to current events. These make extensive use of jump-cut-style editing.

==Confusion with other transitions==

Vernacular use of the term &quot;jump cut&quot; can describe any abrupt or noticeable edit in a film. However, technically, many such over-broad usages are incorrect. In particular, a cut between two different subjects is not a true jump cut, no matter how jarring. A jump cut usually involves a jump through narrative time (as with the famous holiday greeting in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;—a schoolboy Kane sulkily wishes his guardian &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;, and the scene then cuts to the guardian wishing his charge, about to turn twenty-five, &quot;and a Happy New Year&quot;) or an &quot;elliptical&quot; edit, wherein a shot of continuous action is broken up with a sudden cut.

<text>Video editing is the post-production and arrangement of video shots. To showcase excellent video editing to the public, video editors must be reasonable and ensure they have a thorough understanding of film, television, and other sorts of videography. Video editing structures and presents all video information, including films and television shows, video advertisements and video essays. Video editing has been dramatically democratized in recent years by editing software available for personal computers. Editing video can be difficult and tedious, so several technologies have been produced to aid people in this task. Overall, video editing has a wide variety of styles and applications.

==Types of editing==
Though once the province of expensive machines called video editors, video editing software is now available for personal computers and workstations. Video editing includes cutting segments (trimming), re-sequencing clips, and adding transitions and other special effects.

* Linear video editing uses video tape and is edited sequentially. Several video clips from different tapes are recorded to one single tape in the order that they will appear.
*Non-linear editing systems (NLE) allow video(s) to be edited on computers with specialized software. This process is not destructive to the raw video footage and is done by using programs such as DaVinci Resolve, Avid Media Composer, Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro.
* Offline editing is the process by which raw footage is copied from an original source, without affecting the original film stock or video tape. Once the editing is complete, the original media is then re-assembled in the online editing stage.
* Online editing is the process of reassembling the edit to a full resolution video after an offline edit has been performed. It is done in the final stage of a video production.
* Cloud-based editing is the process of utilising the internet to work with content remotely, collaboratively or of a time-critical nature such as editing of live sports events in real-time using video proxies (lower resolution copies) of original material.
* Vision mixing is used when working within live television and video production environments. A vision mixer is used to cut live feed coming from several cameras in real time.

==Background==

Video editing is one of the most crucial steps of the post-production process. The process combines all motion video production footage, special effects and sound recordings to create a compelling visual story. Before editing film, makers would require the camera to be stationary, with the action being distant from the camera. The video was captured with single shots strung together without regard for continuity, screen direction, lighting, emotional consideration, etc. Using video footage, a director can communicate non-fictional and fictional events. The goal of editing is to combine video and sound to communicate to the audience and allow them to feel emotionally connected to the story. It is a visual art.

Motion picture film editing is a predecessor to video editing and, in several ways, video editing simulates motion picture film editing. Video editing was first introduced with the use of linear video editing, which was performed before digital software. Followed by video editing software on non-linear editing systems (NLE).

=== Linear editing ===
The first type of editing in the early 1900s was made with scissors, tape, and an editing table. Since editors could not view their edits while in the process, holding the film to the light was their only way of viewing their work. With the invention of the Moviola in the 1920s, a machine that allowed editors to see the film and make precise edits to deliver a better film. this process was used for about fifty years and helped advance video editing.

In the 1950s, video tape recorders (VTR) were invented and it was a defining element in the advancement of video editing. The VTR was the first device to use magnetic tape and was a revolutionary addition to video editing but had major drawbacks; the quality degradation caused by copying was so great, that a 2-inch Quadruplex videotape was edited by visualizing the recorded track with ferrofluid, cutting it with a razor blade or guillotine cutter, and splicing with video tape. The two pieces of tape to be joined were painted with a solution of extremely fine iron filings suspended in carbon tetrachloride, a toxic and carcinogenic compound. This &quot;developed&quot; the magnetic tracks (tape), making them visible when viewed through a microscope so that they could be aligned in a splicer designed for this task. The process allowed editors to play back their video but only at one speed and to mark the point of cut an editor had to be very precise. This process was used up until the late 1970s and early 1980s but the evolution of video editing continued. By the 1960s the EECO 900 was invented as well as the Ampex EDITEC which allowed for electronic editing and electronic editing controller.

Improvements in quality and economy, and the invention of the flying erase-head, allowed new video and audio material to be recorded over the material already present on an existing magnetic tape. This was introduced into the linear editing technique. If a scene closer to the beginning of the video tape needed to be changed in length, all later scenes would need to be recorded onto the video tape again in sequence. 
In addition, sources could be played back simultaneously through a vision mixer (video switcher) to create more complex transitions between scenes. A popular 1970-80s system for creating these transitions was the U-matic equipment (named for the U-shaped tape path). That system used two tape players and one tape recorder, and edits were done by automatically having the machines back up, then speed up together simultaneously, so that the edit didn&#x27;t roll or glitch. Later, in the 1980-90&#x27;s came the smaller beta equipment (named for the B-shaped tape path), and more complex controllers, some of which did the synchronizing electronically.

=== Non-linear editing ===
Non-linear editing (NLE) was first introduced in the 1970s with the CMX 600, which allowed editors to modify and edit the pieces of footage to be moved and placed in an alternate timeline and preserving the original footage, the ability to work on any segment in the video in any order. In 1984, the invention of the Editdroid created by LucasFilm allowed editors a computerized editing system that stored large quantities of high definition footage. There was a transitional analog period using multiple source videocassette recorders (VCR) with the Montage Picture Processor and Ediflex, or EditDroid using LaserDisc players, but modern NLE systems edit video digitally captured onto a hard drive from an analog video or digital video source. Content is ingested and recorded natively with the appropriate codec that the video editing software uses to process captured footage. With high-definition video becoming more popular and it can be readily edited using the same video editing software along with related motion graphics programs. In the late 1980s and early 1990s at home NLE software became more apparent on home computers using software such as Avid Media Composer and Adobe Premiere. The video clips are arranged on a timeline, music tracks, titles, digital on-screen graphics are added, special effects can be created, and the finished program is &quot;rendered&quot; into a finished video. The video may then be distributed in a variety of ways including DVD, web streaming, QuickTime Movies, iPod, CD-ROM, or video tape.

By the 2000s, NLE had become accessible to everyone, with advanced of central processing units (CPUs) on personal computers giving the ability to edit at home with higher resolutions.

==Home video editing==

Like some other technologies, the cost of video editing has declined over time. The original 2&quot; Quadruplex system costs so much, that many television production facilities could only afford a single unit, and editing was a highly involved process that required special training.

In contrast to this, nearly any home computer sold since the year 2000 has the speed and storage capacity to digitize and edit standard-definition television (SDTV). The two major retail operating systems include basic video editing software – Apple&#x27;s iMovie and Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Movie Maker. Additional options exist, usually as more advanced commercial products. As well as these commercial products, there are open-source video-editing programs. Automatic video editing products have also emerged, opening up video editing to a broader audience of amateurs and reducing the time it takes to edit videos. These exist usually as media storage services, such as Google with its Google Photos or smaller companies like Vidify.

== Current applications ==
Video editing can be used for many purposes. Every social media app, workplace, YouTube video, and educational institute use this skill to create something visually appealing and informational.

*Personal use—Many programs online are easily obtainable to download from anyone&#x27;s personal computer. Adobe, Canva, and Filmora are a couple examples of programs that are downloadable for anyone to use.
*Virtual reality—Advancements are being made to help with editing spherical video used in virtual reality settings. The ability to edit in virtual reality was created so that users would be able to check their video edits in real time, without having to continually view the video in a headset between edits.
*Social media—Video editing can be used for entertainment and other purposes on YouTube and other social media sites. School teachers have used video editing to help their students retain information and extend lessons outside the classroom.

== Future applications ==

Extracurricular courses in elementary schools throughout the United States have been started to educate students on the importance of video editing and practice video production. Notable themes of videos being taught in schools include music videos and short documentaries; some of which win awards such as one from Panasonic.

<text>Linear video editing is a video editing post-production process of selecting, arranging, and modifying images and sound in a predetermined, ordered sequence. Regardless of whether it was captured by a video camera, tapeless camcorder, or recorded in a television studio on a video tape recorder (VTR) the content must be accessed sequentially.

For the most part, video editing software has replaced linear editing. In the past, film editing was done in a linear fashion, where film reels were literally cut into long strips divided by takes and scenes and then glued or taped back together to create a logical sequence of film. Linear video editing is more time-consuming, and highly specialized, and tedious work. Still, it is relevant today because of these reasons:
* The method is simple and inexpensive.
* Mandatory for some jobs: for example, if only two sections of video clips are to be joined together in sequence, it is often the quickest and easiest way.
* If video editors learn linear editing skills, it increases their knowledge as well as their versatility. According to many professional editors who learn linear editing skills first, they tend to become proficient all-round editors.

Until the advent of computer-based random access non-linear editing systems (NLE) in the early 1990s, linear video editing was simply called video editing.

== History ==
Live television is still essentially produced in the same manner as it was in the 1950s, although it has been transformed by modern technical advances. Before videotape, the only way to air the same shows again was by filming shows using a kinescope, essentially a video monitor paired with a movie camera. However, kinescopes (the films of television shows) suffered from various sorts of picture degradation, from image distortion and apparent scan lines to artifacts in contrast and loss of detail. Kinescopes had to be processed and printed in a film laboratory, making them unreliable for broadcasts delayed for different time zones.

The primary motivation for the development of video tape was as a short- or long-term archival medium. Only after a series of technical advances spanning decades did video tape editing finally become a viable production tool, up to par with film editing.

==Early technology==

The first widely accepted video tape in the United States was two-inch quadruplex videotape, which traveled at 15 inches per second. To gain enough head-to-tape speed, four video recording and playback heads were spun on a head wheel across most of the two-inch width of the tape. (Audio and synchronization tracks were recorded along the sides of the tape with stationary heads.) This system was known as &quot;quad&quot; (for &quot;quadruplex&quot;) recording.

The resulting video tracks were slightly less than a ninety-degree angle (considering the vector addition of high-speed spinning heads tracing across the 15-inches-per-second forward motion of the tape).

Originally, video was edited by visualizing the recorded track with ferrofluid, cutting it with a razor blade or guillotine cutter, and splicing with video tape, in a manner similar to film editing. This was an arduous process that should be avoided where possible. When it was used, the two pieces of tape to be joined were painted with a solution of extremely fine iron filings suspended in carbon tetrachloride, a toxic and carcinogenic compound. This &quot;developed&quot; the magnetic tracks, making them visible when viewed through a microscope so that they could be aligned in a splicer designed for this task. The tracks had to be cut during a vertical retrace without disturbing the odd-field/even-field ordering. The cut also had to be at the same angle that the video tracks were laid down on the tape. Since the video and audio read heads were several inches apart, it was not possible to make a physical edit that would function correctly in both video and audio. The cut was made for video, and a portion of the audio was then re-copied into the correct relationship, using the same technique as for editing 16mm film with a combined magnetic audio track.

The disadvantages of physically editing tapes were many. Some broadcasters decreed that edited tapes could not be reused, in an era when the relatively high cost of the machines and tapes was balanced by the savings involved in being able to wipe and reuse the media. Others, such as the BBC, allowed reuse of spliced tape in certain circumstances as long as it conformed to strict criteria about the number of splices in a given duration, usually a maximum of five splices for every half hour. The process required great skill and often resulted in edits that would roll (lose sync), and each edit required several minutes to perform, although this was also initially true of the electronic editing that came later.

In the United States, the 1961-62 Ernie Kovacs ABC specials and &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; were the only TV shows to make extensive use of splice editing of videotape.

== Introduction of computerized systems ==
A system for editing Quad tape &quot;by hand&quot; was developed in the 1960s. It was really just a means of synchronizing the playback of two machines so that the signal of the new shot could be &quot;punched in&quot; with a reasonable chance at success. One problem with this and early computer-controlled systems was that the audio track was prone to suffer artifacts (i.e., a short buzzing sound) because the video of the newly recorded shot would record into the side of the audio track. A commercial solution known as &quot;Buzz Off&quot; was used to minimize this effect.

For more than a decade, computer-controlled Quad editing systems were the standard post-production tool for television. Quad tape involved expensive hardware, time-consuming setup, relatively long rollback times for each edit and showed misalignment as disagreeable &quot;banding&quot; in the video. However, it should be mentioned that Quad tape has a better bandwidth than any smaller-format analog tape, and properly handled, it could produce a picture indistinguishable from that of a live camera.

== Further advancement in technology ==

When helical scan video recorders became the standard, it was no longer possible to physically cut and splice the tape. At this point, video editing became a process of using two video tape machines, playing back the source tape (or &quot;raw footage&quot;) from one machine, and copying just the portions desired onto a second tape (the &quot;edit master&quot;).

The bulk of linear editing is done simply, with two machines and an edit controller device to control them. Many video tape machines are capable of controlling a second machine, eliminating the need for an external editing control device.

This process is &quot;linear&quot;, rather than non-linear editing, as the nature of the tape-to-tape copying requires that all shots be laid out in the final edited order. Once a shot is on tape, nothing can be placed ahead of it without overwriting whatever is already there. (Such a replacement is sometimes called an &quot;insert edit&quot;.) If absolutely necessary, material can be dubbed by copying the edited content onto another tape; however, as each copy generation degrades the image cumulatively, this is not desirable.

One drawback of early video editing techniques was that it was impractical to produce a rough cut for presentation to an executive producer. Since Executive Producers are never familiar enough with the material to be able to visualize the finished product from an inspection of an edit decision list (EDL), they were deprived of the opportunity to voice their opinions at a time when those opinions could be easily acted upon. Thus, particularly in documentary television, video was resisted for quite a long time.

== Peak usage ==
Video editing reached its full potential in the late 1970s when computer-controlled minicomputer edit controllers along with communications protocols were developed, which could orchestrate an edit based on an EDL, using timecode to synchronize multiple tape machines and auxiliary devices using a 9-Pin Protocol. The most popular and widely used computer editing systems came from Sony, Ampex and the venerable CMX. Systems such as these were expensive, especially when considering auxiliary equipment like VTR, video switchers and character generators (CG) and were usually limited to high-end post-production facilities.
Jack Calaway of Calaway Engineering was the first to produce a lower-cost, PC-based, &quot;CMX-style&quot; linear editing system, which greatly expanded the use of linear editing systems throughout the post-production industry. Following suit, other companies, including EMC and Strassner Editing Systems, came out with equally useful competing editing products.

== Current usage ==
While computer-based non-linear video editing software has been adopted throughout most of the commercial, film, industrial, and consumer video industries, linear video tape editing is still commonplace in television station newsrooms for the production of television news and medium-sized production facilities that haven&#x27;t made the capital investment in newer technologies. News departments often still use linear editing because they can start editing tape and feeds from the field as soon as they are received since no additional time is spent capturing material as is necessary in non-linear editing systems, and systems that are able to digitally record and edit simultaneously have only recently become affordable for small operations.

<text>A blue straggler is a type of star that is more luminous and bluer than expected. Typically identified in a stellar cluster, they have a higher effective temperature than the main sequence turnoff point for the cluster, where ordinary stars begin to evolve towards the red giant branch. Blue stragglers were first discovered by Allan Sandage in 1953 while performing photometry of the stars in the globular cluster M3.

==Description==
Standard theories of stellar evolution hold that the position of a star on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram should be determined almost entirely by the initial mass of the star and its age. In a cluster, stars all formed at approximately the same time, and thus in an H–R diagram for a cluster, all stars should lie along a clearly defined curve set by the age of the cluster, with the positions of individual stars on that curve determined solely by their initial mass. With masses two to three times that of the rest of the main-sequence cluster stars, blue stragglers seem to be exceptions to this rule. The resolution of this problem is likely related to interactions between two or more stars in the dense confines of the clusters in which blue stragglers are found. Blue stragglers are also found among field stars, although their detection is more difficult to disentangle from genuine massive main sequence stars. Field blue stragglers can however be identified in the Galactic halo, since all surviving main sequence stars are low mass.

==Formation==

Several explanations have been put forth to explain the existence of blue stragglers. The simplest is that blue stragglers formed later than the rest of the stars in the cluster, but evidence for this is limited. Another simple proposal is that blue stragglers are either field stars which are not actually members of the clusters to which they seem to belong, or are field stars which were captured by the cluster. This too seems unlikely, as blue stragglers often reside at the very center of the clusters to which they belong. The most likely explanation is that blue stragglers are the result of stars that come too close to another star or similar mass object and collide. The newly formed star has thus a higher mass, and occupies a position on the HR diagram which would be populated by genuinely young stars.

===Cluster interactions===

The two most viable explanations put forth for the existence of blue stragglers both involve interactions between cluster members. One explanation is that they are current or former binary stars that are in the process of merging or have already done so. The merger of two stars would create a single more massive star, potentially with a mass larger than that of stars at the main-sequence turn-off point. While a star born with a mass larger than that of stars at the turn-off point would evolve quickly off the main sequence, the components forming a more massive star (via merger) would thereby delay such a change. There is evidence in favor of this view, notably that blue stragglers appear to be much more common in dense regions of clusters, especially in the cores of globular clusters. Since there are more stars per unit volume, collisions and close encounters are far more likely in clusters than among field stars and calculations of the expected number of collisions are consistent with the observed number of blue stragglers.

One way to test this hypothesis is to study the Stellar pulsation of variable blue stragglers. The asteroseismological properties of merged stars may be measurably different from those of typical pulsating variables of similar mass and luminosity. However, the measurement of pulsations is very difficult, given the scarcity of variable blue stragglers, the small photometric amplitudes of their pulsations and the crowded fields in which these stars are often found. Some blue stragglers have been observed to rotate quickly, with one example in 47 Tucanae observed to rotate 75 times faster than the Sun, which is consistent with formation by collision.

The other explanation relies on mass transfer between two stars born in a binary star system. The more massive of the two stars in the system will evolve first and as it expands, will overflow its Roche lobe. Mass will quickly transfer from the initially more massive companion onto the less massive; like the collision hypothesis, this would explain why there are main-sequence stars more massive than other stars in the cluster which have already evolved off the main sequence. Observations of blue stragglers have found that some have significantly less carbon and oxygen in their photospheres than is typical, which is evidence of their outer material having been dredged up from the interior of a companion.

Overall, there is evidence in favor of both collisions and mass transfer between binary stars. In M3, 47 Tucanae, and NGC 6752, both mechanisms seem to be operating, with collisional blue stragglers occupying the cluster cores and mass transfer blue stragglers at the outskirts. The discovery of low-mass white dwarf companions around two blue stragglers in the Kepler field suggests these two blue stragglers gained mass via stable mass transfer.

===Field formation===

Blue stragglers are also found among field stars, as a result of close binary interaction. Since the fraction of close binaries increases with decreasing metallicity, blue stragglers are increasingly likely to be found across metal poor stellar populations. The identification of blue stragglers among field stars however is more difficult than in stellar clusters, because of the mix of stellar ages and metallicities among field stars. Field blue stragglers however can be identified among old stellar populations, like the Galactic halo, or dwarf galaxies.

==Red and yellow stragglers==
&quot;Yellow stragglers&quot; or &quot;red stragglers&quot; are stars with colors between that of the turnoff and the red-giant branch but brighter than the subgiant branch. Such stars have been identified in open and globular star clusters. These stars may be former blue straggler stars that are now evolving toward the giant branch.

<text>The district of Bautzen (, ; Polish: &quot;Powiat Budziszyn&quot;) is a district in the state of Saxony in Germany. Its largest towns are Bautzen, Bischofswerda, Kamenz, Hoyerswerda and Radeberg. It is the biggest district in Saxony by area, and a member of the Neisse Euroregion.

It is bordered to the south by the Czech Republic. Clockwise, it also borders the district of Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge, the district-free city of Dresden, the district of Meißen, the state of Brandenburg, and the district of Görlitz.

The municipality&#x27;s centre, north and east are part of the recognized Sorbian settlement area in Saxony. The Upper Sorbian language has an official status next to German in that area, and all villages bear names in both languages.

== History ==

Historically, most of Upper Lusatia belonged to Bohemia. In the Thirty Years&#x27; War, it became a part of Saxony. Only the small town of Schirgiswalde remained Bohemian until 1809.

In the time of the GDR, these areas were within the &quot;Bezirk&quot; Dresden (the districts/&quot;Kreise&quot; of Bautzen, Bischofswerda and Kamenz) or the &quot;Bezirk&quot; Cottbus (&quot;Kreis&quot; Hoyerswerda).

A new district of Bautzen was established in 1994 by merging the former districts of Bautzen and Bischofswerda. The district at that time was less than half the size of the current district. The district of Kamenz (1,340km²) and the district-free city of Hoyerswerda were merged into the district of Bautzen in August 2008.

==Geography==
The district of Bautzen is part of the region of Upper Lusatia (&quot;Oberlausitz&quot;). The south of the district is occupied by the Lusatian Mountains, and the countryside slopes away to the north.

The Spree river enters the district from the southeast and runs through Schirgiswalde and Bautzen before leaving to the north. North of Bautzen, the river is dammed by a reservoir (&quot;Talsperre Bautzen&quot;, 5.5 km²).

At its widest, the district is 65 km east–west, and 63 km north–south.

== Towns and municipalities ==
The following is a clickable map of municipalities in the district, in German:
This lists the towns and municipalities by their German-language names, with Upper Sorbian names in parentheses:
== Coat of arms ==
The district&#x27;s arms are identical to the arms of the margravate of Upper Lusatia. The coat of arms was established about 1350, when six towns of Upper Lusatia founded a confederacy. This loose alliance became a margravate under the Bohemian crown in 1378.

<text>A bean bag round, also known by its trademarked name flexible baton round, is a type of baton round, fired from a shotgun, and used for less lethal apprehension of suspects.

==Description==
The bean bag round typically consists of a small fabric &quot;pillow&quot; filled with #9 lead shot weighing about . It is fired from a normal 12-gauge shotgun. When fired, the bag is expelled at around ; it spreads out in flight and distributes its impact over about of the target. It is designed to deliver a blow that will cause minimum long-term trauma and no penetration but will result in a muscle spasm or other reaction to briefly render a violent suspect immobile. It still can cause serious injury and death. The shotgun round is inaccurate over about and has a maximum range of around . Changes to the bean bag round since its inception in the early 1970s have included a velocity reduction from 120 to 90 meters per second (400 to 300 ft/s) as well as a shift from a square shape to a more rounded sock-shaped projectile.

Shotguns dedicated to being used for bean bag rounds are often visibly modified with either yellow or green markings, or bright orange stocks and stops, to reduce the possibility that a user might inadvertently load lethal munitions into the weapon.

==Use==

Bean bag rounds are used when a person is a danger to themselves or others but is not a direct threat in such a manner that deadly force would be appropriate – typically a suicidal individual with a bladed weapon. The round is intended to disable the person without killing them.

==Dangers==
A bean bag round can severely injure or kill in a wide variety of ways. They have caused around one death a year since their introduction in the US. A round can hit the chest, break the ribs and send the broken ribs into the heart. A shot to the head can break the nose, crush the larynx or break the neck or skull of the subject. This is why many officers are taught to aim for the extremities when using a bean bag round. A strike in the abdominal area can cause internal bleeding or strike the celiac plexus which can disrupt breathing or heartbeat, but such a hit is generally safer than most other areas as well as presenting a larger target than an extremity. Fatalities are occasionally the result of mistaking other shotgun rounds for bean bags.

*In 2006, during anti-corruption protests in Budapest, Hungary, protestors were shot by beanbag rounds to the head. At least 3 of them were permanently blinded. One of the victims committed suicide in 2013 due to psychological complications arising from his blindness. In addition, many people suffered minor injuries (nose and finger fractures, hemorrhagic bruises). Furthermore, a few victims suffered from long-term psychological trauma due to the shock.

*In 2013, in Park Forest, Illinois, an autopsy showed that a 95-year-old man had died from hemoperitoneum as a result of being shot by police with a bean bag gun.

*11 August 2019, during the Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests, a female First Aider was suspected to have been hit with a bean bag round, resulting in rupture of one of her eyeballs.

* On 23 November 2019, a bean bag round fired by the Colombian riot police hit student Dilan Cruz in the head, killing him.

* 31 May 2020, 20-year-old Justin Howell was shot in the head by the Austin PD while at a protest, suffering a skull fracture leading to seizure and brain trauma. The next day, 1 June 2020, 16-year-old Brad Levi Ayala also suffered a skull fracture after being shot in the head with a beanbag round by the Austin PD.

* 22 August 2022, Chris Amyotte, 42, an Ojibwa man from Manitoba, died after being hit by a beanbag round fired at him by an officer of the Vancouver Police Department in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

* 14 September 2023, Krista Kach, 47, an Australian woman died after being hit by a beanbag round fired at her by an officer of New South Wales Police in Stockton, NSW. She was taken to hospital but her condition deteriorated and she later died. An interim coroner&#x27;s report determined that the round had penetrated her chest, hitting her heart.

* 24 September 2023, Rafael dos Santos Tercilio Garcia, 32, a deaf fan of São Paulo Football Club, died of traumatic brain injury just outside Morumbi Stadium after being hit in the head by a beanbag round fired during a riot control operation by the Military Police of São Paulo State directed at São Paulo FC fans celebrating victory in 2023 Brazil Cup. Besides a bean bag device attached to Rafael&#x27;s head, forensic experts found his cap perforated.

<text>Elizabeth &quot;Dolly&quot; Shepherd (1886–1983) was a parachutist and fairground entertainer in the Edwardian era.

==Early life==
Shepherd was born in Potters Bar, Middlesex, England. 

==Career==
At the age of 16, she got a job as a waitress at the Alexandra Palace in North London so that she could see the composer John Philip Sousa. She overheard two men discussing the loss of a target for an act in which they shot an apple off a girl&#x27;s head; she volunteered on the spot. Shepherd took the place of Sam Cody″s wife during his London show, wearing a blindfold, having Cody shoot, from her head, a plaster egg.&lt;ref name=&quot;simanaitissays/shepherd-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;simanaitissays/shepherd-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;westhillwhistler/Dyson-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;westhillwhistler/Dyson-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, she ascended on a trapeze slung below a hot-air balloon to a height of two to four-thousand feet before descending on a parachute. On one occasion, both the balloon and the parachute malfunctioned, and she found herself rising to 15,000 feet. At this height, both the cold and lack of oxygen were threatening to make her lose her grip and fall to her death. Fortunately, the balloon returned to earth before it was too late.

The mishap foreshadowed a later, more serious incident during an exhibition jump on 9 June 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;GWR/first-mid-air-rescue&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Shepherd had ascended with another female parachutist, Louie May.&lt;ref name=&quot;a-e-g/balloon-bail&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During descent, May&#x27;s parachute failed to release, leading Shepherd to implore May wrap her arms and legs around Shepherd so that they could descend on one parachute. Weighed down by May, Shepherd&#x27;s descended too rapidly and was left paralyzed from the impact of her landing. She lay in bed, unable to move, for weeks. A doctor prescribed a course of electrical shock treatment. The doctor accidentally gave Dolly an excessively powerful electrical shock that resulted in her being ejected from the bed, but the powerful jolt realigned the vertebrae in Dolly&#x27;s back and healed her. She then returned to her act and first flew again at Ashby-de-la-Zouch.&lt;ref name=&quot;le.ac.uk/finding-dolly&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Edith Maud Cook died from injuries sustained following a jump from a balloon at Coventry on 9 July 1910 when her parachute collapsed after a gust of wind blew her on to a factory roof. Shepherd had been due to make the jump at Coventry but Cook had taken her place.

According to BBC History magazine, she liked to &quot;go high because I had it in my head that if I had to be killed, I’d like to be killed completely: good and proper!&quot; She recalled that on one occasion she almost landed on a steam train &quot;That driver, he had some forethought: he blew the steam and just blew me off into a canal at Grantham.&quot;

In 1912, she thought she heard a voice telling her to &quot;[not] go up again&quot; and she never did.

During WWI, Dolly joined the Women&#x27;s Volunteer Reserve, and she drove a munitions truck. At that time, she met Captain Percy Sedgwick, a man whom she chauffeured. Shepherd later married him, (married name Elizabeth Sedgwick). 

In WWII, Dolly (Elizabeth Sedgwick), was an air raid shelter voluntary marshal, in a sandpit near Lewisham, southeast London, England.&lt;ref name=&quot;elizabethdollyshepherd/mrs-sedgwick&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

She flew with the Red Devils display team to celebrate her 90th birthday.

==Personal life==
Shepherd married Captain Percy Sedgwick. Her daughter is Molly Sedgwick.

==Legacy==
There is a road named after Shepherd in the town where she flew again, Ashby-de-la-Zouch. &quot;Dolly Shepherd Close&quot; is off Philip Bent Road approximately 0.6 miles due West of the town centre.

<doc id="207419" wikidata="Q5227766" url="?curid=207419" title="USS Dolphin (SS-169)">
<text>USS &quot;Dolphin&quot; (SF-10/SC-3/SS-169), a submarine and one of the &quot;V-boats&quot;, was the sixth ship of the United States Navy to be named for that aquatic mammal. She also bore the name &quot;V-7&quot; and the classifications SF-10 and SC-3 prior to her commissioning. She was launched on 6 March 1932 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard, sponsored by Mrs. E.D. Toland, and commissioned on 1 June 1932.

==Design==
&quot;Dolphin&quot; was the penultimate design in the V-boat series. With a length of and a displacement only a little more than half that of the previous three large cruiser submarines ( surfaced, submerged), &quot;Dolphin&quot; was clearly an attempt to strike a medium between those latter submarines and earlier S-class submarines, which were little more than large coastal boats. The general arrangement of propulsion machinery was identical to that of &quot;V-5&quot; and &quot;V-6&quot;, but even with a surface displacement of only 1,718 tons, &quot;Dolphin&quot;″s scaled-down main engines—rated at each—could only just deliver the surface speed of the larger ships, and her endurance and torpedo load-out were much reduced. The torpedo armament was six tubes (4 bow, 2 stern), with 18 torpedoes. A 4-inch (102 mm)/50 caliber deck gun was equipped. &quot;Dolphin&quot;″s size and weight were nearly ideal for the range and duration of the war patrols that became customary in the Pacific during World War II, and the war-time , , and classes had similar dimensions.

The engine specifications were two BuEng-built, MAN-designed direct-drive 6-cylinder 4-stroke diesel engines, each, with two BuEng MAN 4-cycle 6-cylinder auxiliary diesel engines, each, driving electrical generators. The auxiliary engines were for charging batteries or for increased surface speed via a diesel-electric system providing power to the main electric motors. Unusually for the V-boats, &quot;Dolphin&quot;&#x27;s engines were never replaced.

&quot;Dolphin&quot; was built to a partial welded/partial riveted construction method. The Portsmouth Navy Yard expanded the use of welding with this boat, and in addition to the superstructure, piping brackets, and various support frames, the Portsmouth engineers used welding on the outer hull flanges to the Kingston valves and on interior tanks in the forward and aft torpedo rooms. Adopting a cautious, economically driven approach they still riveted both the inner and outer hulls. The designer of the &quot;Dolphin&quot;, Andrew McKee, was concerned about weight growth and so he made the decision to trim off a portion of the standing flange on the I-beams used in hull construction, leaving them looking somewhat like the number 1. He later admitted that this was not the best idea, as it adversely affected hull strength.

==Service history==

===Inter-war period===
&quot;Dolphin&quot; departed Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 24 October 1932 for San Diego, California, arriving on 3 December to report to Submarine Division 12 (SubDiv 12). She served on the West Coast, taking part in tactical exercises and test torpedo firings until 4 March 1933, when she got underway for the East Coast. She arrived at Portsmouth Navy Yard on 23 March for final trials and acceptance, remaining there until 1 August. &quot;Dolphin&quot; returned to San Diego on 25 August 1933 to rejoin SubDiv 12.

In 1933, &quot;Dolphin&quot; tested an unusual feature for submarines of having a waterproof motor boat, stored in a compartment aft of the sail, which could be brought out when needed. At that time, most navies adhered to the prize rules, which required submarines to board and inspect merchant vessels before they could sink them, as had often been done in World War I, except in periods of unrestricted submarine warfare.

She cruised on the west coast with occasional voyages to Pearl Harbor, Alaska, and the Panama Canal Zone for exercises and fleet problems. On 1 December 1937, &quot;Dolphin&quot; departed San Diego for her new homeport, Pearl Harbor, arriving one week later. She continued to operate in fleet problems and training exercises, visiting the West Coast on a cruise from 29 September to 25 October 1940. Located at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, &quot;Dolphin&quot; took the attacking enemy planes under fire, and then left for a patrol in search of Japanese submarines in the Hawaiian Islands.

===World War II===
&quot;Dolphin&quot; departed from Pearl Harbor on 24 December 1941 on her first war patrol, during which she reconnoitered in the Marshall Islands in preparation for later air strikes.

She returned to Pearl Harbor on 3 February 1942 to refit and resupply, and then got underway once more on 14 May. Searching a wide area west of Midway Island, she patrolled off the island itself during the pivotal Battle of Midway from 3 to 6 June. She put in to the atoll for repairs from 8 to 11 June, and then she returned to her patrol, attacking a destroyer and a tanker with undetermined results before returning to Pearl Harbor on 24 July.

Her third war patrol, from 12 October to 5 December, was in the storm-tossed waters of the Kurile Islands, where she performed reconnaissance essential to the operations that were to keep Japanese bases there largely ineffective throughout the war.

By 1943 &quot;Dolphin&quot; was thoroughly worn out and badly in need of a modernization. Her age and basic limitations argued against the time-consuming and costly work, so for most of 1943 she was used in training operations at Pearl Harbor. A shipyard inspection showed that she was suffering badly from rusting and corrosion inside her tanks, in some cases structural members were found rusted completely through. With newer submarines now available for offensive war patrols and not willing to delay work on newer boats at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Dolphin&quot; was assigned less dramatic but still vital service on training duty until 29 January 1944, when she sailed for exercises in the Canal Zone. She then sailed for Portsmouth Navy Yard where she was given patch repairs only, with her operating depth reduced to 150 feet. &quot;Dolphin&quot; was then assigned duty as a school boat at Submarine Base New London, Connecticut, where she arrived on 6 March. She served in this essential task until the end of the war, then was decommissioned on 12 October 1945 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard.

&quot;Dolphin&quot; was sold for scrap on 26 August 1946.

==Popular culture==
&quot;Dolphin&quot; was featured in the 1937 movie &quot;Submarine D-1&quot;.

<text>The Tuvan People&#x27;s Republic (TPR), known simply as Tannu Tuva, was a partially recognized socialist republic that existed between 1921 and 1944. It was located in the same territory as the former Imperial Russian protectorate of Uriankhai Krai, northwest of Mongolia, and now corresponds to the Republic of Tuva, a republic of Russia.

The Soviet Union and Mongolia were the only countries to formally recognize it during its existence, in 1924 and 1926 respectively. After a period of increased Soviet influence, in October 1944, the polity was absorbed into the Russian SFSR (the largest constituent republic of the Soviet Union) at the request of the Tuvan parliament, ending 23 years of independence.

== History ==
===Establishment===

Since 1759, Tuva (then called Tannu Uriankhai) had been part of Mongolia, which in turn was a part of the territory of the Manchu Qing dynasty. As the Qing dynasty fell in the Xinhai Revolution of 1911, revolutions in Mongolia were also occurring, leading to the independence of both Mongolia and the Tuvan Uryankhay Republic. After a period of political uncertainty, the new republic became a protectorate of the Russian Empire in April 1914, known as Uryankhay Krai. After the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917 and the establishment of the Russian Republic, both it and Uryankhay Krai reaffirmed its status as a Russian protectorate.

During the subsequent Russian Civil War, both Russian Whites and Reds, Mongols, as well as Chinese soldiers seeking to retake Mongolia and Tuva, were engaged in combat in the region. In the 5th Congress of the Russian population in Uryankhay Krai in the summer of 1918, it was decided that the power would be transferred to the &quot;Uryankhay Regional Council of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers&#x27; Deputies&quot;, and with backing from the Russian SFSR, that a Soviet power would be established and would recognize the Tuvans and allow them to create their own national state. On 26 January 1920, Ivan Smirnov – Chairman of the Siberian Revolutionary Committee – sent an encrypted telegraph regarding Tuva to Moscow stating: &quot;The Mongols have entered the province and ejected our [Russian] peasants from the villages. These peasants fought against Kolchak and were independent of him. The Soyoty [Tuvans] are a nomadic tribe oppressed by both Mongols and Russians. Do you consider it necessary to allow the Mongols possession of the Uryankhay [Tuvan] region or to take it by force of arms or to organise an Uryankhay Soviet Republic on the Bashkir pattern? Let me know.&quot;

The Reds had, by December 1920, taken the capital of Khem-Beldyr and had, by March 1921, taken all of Tuva. On 14 August 1921, the &quot;Tannu Tuvan People&#x27;s Republic&quot; (&quot;Tannu&quot; refers to the Tannu-Ola mountains) declared independence and the newly created Tuvan People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (TPRP) became the ruling party. The first chapter of the first constitution of the newborn country stated that &quot;...in international affairs, the state acts under the auspices of Soviet Russia.&quot;

===Early independence===
In the beginning of February 1922, the first meeting of the TPRP took place and a government was created, which began to work on 3 March the same year. The Soviet-Tuvan border was defined in January 1923 and Red Army divisions on Tuvan territory were withdrawn in accordance with an agreement from 1921. The first Great Khural (People&#x27;s Congress) was held on 12 October 1923 and, in the second one, on 28 September 1924, a new constitution proclaimed that the country would develop along non-capitalist lines with the TPRP being the only party and the Tuvan section of the Communist International.

In the summer of 1925, the Soviet Union initiated the “Agreement between the Russian SFSR and the Tannu Tuvan People’s Republic on the Establishment of Friendly Relationships”, which was signed by the two countries, strengthening their relations. The treaty stated that the Soviet government &quot;[did] not consider Tannu-Tuva as its territory and [had] no views on it.&quot;

In 1926, the government adopted their first official flag and emblem, changed the name of its capital from &quot;Khem-Beldyr&quot; to &quot;Kyzyl&quot; (meaning &quot;Red&quot;), and the name of the country to simply &quot;Tuvan People&#x27;s Republic&quot;. It also signed a “Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Recognition” with the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic, another Soviet satellite state. Much of this work was done by Prime Minister Donduk Kuular, a former Lama monk with strong ties to the country&#x27;s many lamas. Kuular sought to establish stronger ties with Mongolia and to make Buddhism the state religion while trying to limit Soviet influence and propaganda. The Soviet Union responded with alarm to Kuular&#x27;s theocratic and nationalist leanings and policies, which were considered in opposition to the communist principles of state atheism and internationalism.

===Sovietization===

Kuular&#x27;s theocratic, nationalist and anti-Soviet policies led to a Soviet-backed coup d&#x27;état in 1929. While Kuular was implementing his policies, the Soviet Union had laid foundations for a new leadership – staunchly loyal to Joseph Stalin – including the creation of the &quot;Tuva Revolutionary Youth Union&quot; where members received military training. Five young Tuvan graduates from the Communist University of the Toilers of the East were appointed &quot;Extraordinary Commissioners&quot; and overthrew the government in January 1929 during the 2nd Plenary Session of the Central Committee.

Following the coup, Kuular was removed from power and executed, and about a third to half the members of the TPRP were also purged. Kuular&#x27;s policies were reverted and the country&#x27;s traditionally nomadic cattle-breeders were put in collectivization programs. Similarly to the Stalinist repressions in Mongolia, Buddhist lamas, aristocrats, members of the intelligentsia and other political dissidents were purged, and Buddhist temples and monasteries were destroyed. As part of this process, the written language in Tuva was changed from the Mongolian script to the Latin-based alphabet in June 1930. Religious symbols, such as the Khorlo, were also removed from the flag and emblem. Evidence of the effect of these actions can be seen in the decline in the numbers of lamas in the country: in 1929, there were 25 lamaseries and about 4,000 lamas and shamans; in 1931, there were just one lamasery, 15 lamas, and approximately 725 shamans. The attempts at eradicating nomadic husbandry were more difficult. A census in 1931 showed that 82.2% of Tuvans still engaged in nomadic cattle breeding.

One of the five Extraordinary Commissioners, Salchak Toka, became General Secretary of the Central Committee of the TPRP in 1932 and would be the de facto leader of Tuva until his death in 1973.

====Border dispute with Mongolia====
In July 1932, with mediation from the Soviet Union, Tuva signed an agreement and received a substantial territorial gain from Mongolia as a fixed border was created between the two countries. Mongolia was forced to sign under Soviet pressure and did not ratify the agreement in the Mongol Great Khural. The new territory notably included mountain, the only source of salt mining for Tuva. The border between Tuva and Mongolia remained controversial during the 1930s, with Mongolia referring to Qing dynasty documents to argue their ownership of the mountain.

The debate continued to flare up in the following years, and Mongolian leadership demanded the return of the mountain &quot;arbitrarily captured by Tuvans&quot;, criticizing the 1932 agreement as unjust due to Soviet pressure for Mongolia to sign. Soviet authorities reiterated their official position that Mongolia had no reason to revise the 1932 agreement and did not need the salt mountain, asking Tuva not to revise the agreement. Mongolia promised not to raise the issue again, but relations between it and Tuva became very strained. The Tuvan government made concessions to avoid conflict with its neighbor, and in 1940, the two governments signed a new agreement &quot;On the border based on historical materials and documents&quot;. However, while Tuva sought to clarify the border established in 1932, Mongolia sought to revise it completely; this led to irreconcilable positions and the ratification of the new agreement was stopped.

Both parties turned to the Soviet Union for mediation, but with the outbreak of World War II, Soviet authorities insisted on ceasing any discussion regarding the border dispute, especially in regard to Mount Dus-Dag. In 1943, the Mongolian ambassador said &quot;The Salt Mountain has been exploited by the Tuvans for about ten years now and is also located in disputed territory, so the demand for the Tuvan government to return it is too harsh.&quot; This more or less ended the controversial issue, but some minor disputes continued until the absorption of Tuva into the Soviet Union in 1944, at which point Mongolia ratified the original 1932 agreement (and even then, border protection such as alarmed fences had to be introduced in the area in 1946).

===World War II===

In the 1930s, the Empire of Japan undertook several aggressive actions against China. This included the invasion of Manchuria and the creation of the Manchukuo puppet state, and culminated in a full-scale war against China in 1937. The Tuvan government undertook measures to strengthen the Tuvan People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army, and the 11th Congress of the TPRP, held in November 1939, instructed the Central Committee to fully equip the Tuvan Army in the next two to three years and to further raise combat readiness. The Ministry of Military Affairs was created in late February 1940 and immediately started equipping the army with new weapons and equipment, as well as improving training of officers and army units. The Soviet Union assisted the Tuvans with significant assistance in materiel and technical development. The middle-ranking and high-ranking commanders of the Tuvan Army were trained in Soviet military academies, including the Frunze Military Academy and the General Staff Academy.

As Germany and other Axis powers launched their invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the 10th Great Khural of Tuva declared that &quot;The Tuvan people, led by the entire revolutionary party and government, not sparing their lives, are ready by any means to participate in the struggle of the Soviet Union against the fascist aggressor until their final victory over it.&quot; It has sometimes been stated that Tuva declared war on Germany on 25 June 1941, but the sources are dubious.

Nevertheless, Tuva helped the Soviet Union in substantial ways, transferring its entire gold reserve of ~20,000,000 Rbls to the Soviet Union, with additional extracted Tuvan gold worth around 10,000,000 Rbls annually. Between June 1941 and October 1944, Tuva supplied the Soviet Red Army with 700,000 livestock, of which almost 650,000 were donated. In addition, 50,000 war horses, 52,000 pairs of skis, 10,000 winter coats, 19,000 pairs of gloves, 16,000 boots and 67,000 tons of sheep wool as well as several hundreds tons of meats, grain, carts, sledges, horse tacks and other goods totaling 66,500,000 Rbls were sent. Up to 90% were donated.

In March 1943, 10 Yakovlev Yak-7 fighters were built with funds raised by the Tuvans and placed at the disposal of the Soviet Air Forces. Also during 1943, Tuva mustered 11 volunteer tankers and 208 volunteer cavalrymen. The tankers and 177 of the cavalrymen were assigned to the Red Army and served on the Eastern Front from early 1944, especially around Ukraine.

===Absorption into the USSR===

Tuvan orientation towards Moscow intensified during the war. In September 1943, the written language was again changed, this time from the Latin to the Cyrillic script, the standard alphabet in the Soviet Union. By 1941, the national symbols, such as the flag and emblem, had been changed to the same style as various Soviet regions. Tuvan underwent intense Russification of social and economic practices, and virtually all remaining opposition to Stalinist policy was eradicated. The Soviets desired the mineral resources of the republic and a permanent end to Mongolian-Chinese geopolitical intrigues in the region. This process culminated in the absorption of Tuva in 1944, under the rule of General Secretary Salchak Toka and his wife, Head of State Khertek Anchimaa-Toka.

On 7 August 1944, the Central Committee of the TPRP decided to subsume Tuva into the Soviet Union. This was supported on 15 August by the 9th Plenary Session. On 17 August, the 7th Extraordinary Session of the Little Khural created a &quot;Declaration of the Accession of the Tuvan People&#x27;s Republic to the Soviet Union&quot;. Finally, on 11 October 1944, at a meeting of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, Khertek Anchimaa-Toka read out the declaration detailing the desire for Tuva to join the USSR, which was accepted. The decision went into effect on 1 November 1944, and the Tuvan People&#x27;s Republic thus became the Tuvan Autonomous Oblast, a part of the Russian SFSR (the largest constituent republic of the Soviet Union).

Salchak Toka&#x27;s position changed from &quot;General Secretary of the TPRP&quot; to &quot;First Secretary of the Oblast Committee of the CPSU of the Tuvan Autonomous Oblast&quot; (changed to &quot;Republican Committee&quot; in 1961) and continued his rule of the region until his death in 1973.

On 10 October 1961, the Tuvan Autonomous Oblast became the Tuvan ASSR, still within the Russian SFSR, and remained so until 1992. The area that was the Tuvan People&#x27;s Republic is now known as the Tuva Republic within the Russian Federation.

<doc id="207437" wikidata="Q1057850" url="?curid=207437" title="Actus reus">
<text>In criminal law, actus reus (; : &quot;actus rei&quot;), Latin for &quot;guilty act&quot;, is one of the elements normally required to prove commission of a crime in common law jurisdictions, the other being (&quot;guilty mind&quot;). In the United States, it is sometimes called the &quot;external element&quot; or the &quot;objective element&quot; of a crime.

==Etymology==
The terms &quot;actus reus&quot; and &quot;mens rea&quot; developed in English Law are derived from a principle stated by Edward Coke, namely, &quot;actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea&quot;, which means: &quot;an act does not make a person guilty unless (their) mind is also guilty&quot;; hence, the general test of guilt is one that requires proof of fault, culpability or blameworthiness both in thought and action.

==Act==
In order for an &quot;actus reus&quot; to be committed there has to have been an act. Various common law jurisdictions define act differently but generally, an act is a &quot;bodily movement whether voluntary or involuntary.&quot; In &quot;Robinson v. California&quot;, , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a California law making it illegal to be a drug addict was unconstitutional because the mere status of being a drug addict was not an &quot;act&quot; and thus not criminal. Commentator Dennis Baker asserts:

An act can consist of commission, omission or possession.

===Omission===

Omission involves a failure to engage in a necessary &quot;bodily movement&quot; resulting in injury. As with commission acts, omission acts can be reasoned casually using the &quot;but for&quot; approach. &quot;But for&quot; not having acted, the injury would not have occurred. The Model Penal Code specifically outlines specifications for criminal omissions:

#the omission is expressly made sufficient by the law defining the offense, or
#a duty to perform the omitted act is otherwise imposed by law (for example one must file a tax return).

Hence, if legislation specifically criminalizes an omission through statute, or a duty that would normally be expected was omitted and caused injury, an &quot;actus reus&quot; has occurred.

In English law, there is no Good Samaritan rule therefore one cannot be criminally liable for an omission unless a duty of care is owed. An omission can be criminal if there is a statute that requires one to act. A duty of care is imposed and one is required to act when one is: under a contract (R v Pittwood), has assumed care (R v Stone and Dobinson), has created a dangerous situation (R v Miller), or fails to perform one&#x27;s official position (R v Dytham.).

===Possession===
Possession holds a special place in that it has been criminalized but under common law does not constitute an act. Some countries like the United States have avoided the common law conclusion in &quot;Regina v. Dugdale&quot; by legally defining possession as a &quot;voluntary&quot; act. As a voluntary act, it fulfills the requirements to establish &quot;actus reus&quot;.

==Voluntariness==
For conduct to constitute an &quot;actus reus&quot;, it must be engaged in voluntarily. Few sources enumerate the entirety of what constitutes voluntary and involuntary conduct. Oliver Wendell Holmes, in his 1881 book &quot;The Common Law&quot;, disputed whether such a thing as an involuntary act exists: &quot;[a] spasm is not an act. The contraction of the muscles must be willed.&quot; A few sources, such as the Model Penal Code, provide a more thorough treatment of involuntary conduct:

#a reflex or convulsion;
#a bodily movement during unconsciousness or sleep;
#conduct during hypnosis or resulting from hypnotic suggestion;
#a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or the determination of the actor, either conscious or habitual.

===Reflex or convulsion===
Generally, if, during an uncontrollable flailing caused by a sudden paroxysmal episode, such as that produced by an epileptic seizure, a person strikes another, that person will not be criminally liable for the injuries sustained by the other person. However, if prior to the assault on another, the seized individual was engaging in conduct that he knew to be dangerous given a previous history of seizures, then he is culpable for any injuries resulting from the seizure. For example, in &quot;People v. Decina&quot;, 2 N.Y.2d 133 (1956), the defendant, Emil Decina, appealed a conviction under § 1053-a of the New York Penal Law. On March 14, 1955, Decina suffered a serious seizure while operating a motor vehicle. He swerved wildly through the streets and struck a group of school girls, killing four of them. On direct examination, Decina&#x27;s physician testified that Decina informed him that prior to the accident &quot;he noticed a jerking of his right hand&quot; and recounted his extensive history of seizures, a consequence of brain damage from an automobile accident at age seven. Decina argued, &quot;inter alia&quot;, that he had not engaged in criminal conduct because he did not voluntarily strike the school girls. The New York Court of Appeals disagreed and held that since the defendant knew he was susceptible to a seizure at any time without warning and decided to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway anyway, he was guilty of the offense. &quot;To hold otherwise,&quot; wrote Froessel, J, &quot;would be to say that a man may freely indulge himself in liquor in the same hope that it will not affect his driving, and if it later develops that ensuing intoxication causes dangerous and reckless driving resulting in death, his unconsciousness or involuntariness at that time would relieve him from prosecution[.]&quot;

===Unconsciousness or sleep===

In &quot;Hill v Baxter&quot;, Kilmuir, LC, articulated the necessity of eliminating automatism, defined as &quot;the existence in any person of behaviour of which he is unaware and over which he has no conscious control,&quot; in proving the voluntariness of the &quot;actus reus&quot;:

Thus, a person suffering from somnambulism, a fugue, a metabolic disorder, epilepsy, or other convulsive or reflexive disorder, who kills another, steals another&#x27;s property, or engages in other facially criminal conduct, may not have committed an &quot;actus reus&quot;, for such conduct may have been elicited unconsciously, and &quot;one who engages in what would otherwise be criminal conduct is not guilty of a crime if he does so in a state of unconsciousness[.]&quot; Depending on jurisdiction, automatism may be a defense distinct from insanity or a species of it.

===Hypnosis===

While the general scientific consensus is that hypnosis cannot induce individuals to engage in conduct in which they would not otherwise engage, the Model Penal Code, as well as the criminal codes of Montana, New York, and Kentucky do provide hypnosis and hypnotic suggestion as negating volition, and consequently, &quot;actus reus&quot;.

Perhaps the earliest case of hypnotism as negating voluntary conduct is &quot;California v. Ebanks&quot;, . In &quot;Ebanks&quot;, the court categorically rejected Ebanks&#x27; argument that the trial court committed reversible err in denying him leave to present expert testimony concerning the effects of hypnotism on the will. The lower court bluntly remarked that &quot;[t]he law of the United States does not recognize hypnotism. It would be an illegal defense, and I cannot admit it.&quot; Nearly sixty years later, however, the California Court of Appeals ruled that the trial court did not err in allowing expert testimony on hypnosis, though it did not rule on whether hypnotism negates volition. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled confessions made under hypnosis inadmissible because they are involuntarily given; Germany and Denmark provide a hypnotist defense.

===Omission===

Voluntariness includes omission, for implicit in omission is that the actor voluntarily chose to not perform a &quot;bodily movement&quot; and, consequently, caused an injury. The purposeful, reckless, or negligent absence of an action is considered a voluntary action and fulfills the voluntary requirement of &quot;actus reus&quot;.

<text>Plastic bullet can refer to:

* Plastic baton round: a large, blunt, low-velocity projectile fired from a specialized gun, intended as a less-lethal weapon for riot control.
* Plastic bullet: a conventionally sized and shaped bullet made from a composite material including plastic, fired from a conventional rifle and capable of penetrating human tissue, intended as a less lethal weapon for riot control.

* Plastic bullet (target shooting): a blunt, lightweight handgun bullet intended for short-range target practice, not intended for use as a weapon.

Both types of plastic bullet intended for riot control have caused deaths.

Plastic bullets are generally used for riot control. Some plastic bullets are intended to be skip fired, hitting the ground and ricocheting into the intended target; while others were designed to be fired directly into the target.

Plastic baton rounds were invented by British researchers to provide a more accurate alternative to rubber bullets, and were intended to be fired directly at rioters in Northern Ireland during The Troubles.

An unrelated blunt, low velocity, small-calibre handgun bullet made of hollow plastic is sometimes used for short-range target practice (see recreational use).

== History ==
The plastic baton round was developed in the UK by Porton Down scientists and intended for use against rioters in Northern Ireland during The Troubles, first used there in 1973.

The first version was the L5 Plastic Baton Round (PBR, commonly called plastic bullet). It was created to replace rubber baton rounds (rubber bullets), which had been used in Northern Ireland since 1970 and which were withdrawn by the end of 1975. Rubber bullets were meant to be fired at the legs of rioters or the ground in front of them. However, they were often fired directly at people from close range and sometimes at the totally innocent. The use of rubber bullets in Northern Ireland resulted in at least three people being killed and many more badly injured.

The plastic bullet could be fired directly at people and at longer ranges. It was intended to be a projectile of similar effect on its target as the rubber bullet. Officially, its advantage over the rubber bullet was claimed to be greater accuracy.

The first plastic bullet was made of PVC (some sources say polyurethane), weighed , was diameter and &#x27;rather over&#x27; long. The new plastic bullet was a similar size to but lighter than the rubber bullet, but the considerably longer range of the plastic bullet— against —implies an appreciably higher muzzle velocity. An analysis made in 1976 concluded that the plastic bullet would prove to be more dangerous than the rubber bullet it replaced, especially if used abusively at short distances.

In Northern Ireland between their first use in February 1973 and February 1983, plastic bullets killed four times as many people round for round as the rubber bullets they replaced.

The final variant of the L5 plastic bullet—the L5A7—was introduced in 1994. The L5 was replaced by the L21A1 in 2001. The L21 plastic bullet was fired from a new launcher, the HK L104A1 riot gun, a rifled weapon which gives greater accuracy when used with an optical sight than the smooth bore weapons used to fire the earlier L5 rounds.

A 2003 study for the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission found that the new L21 round was &#x27;potentially more lethal&#x27; since it was inaccurate and 2.5 times more likely to penetrate body tissue than the older L5 round. One in three L21 rounds missed their target, while 10% of the L21 rounds fired caused injury compared to 1.14% of the L5 rounds. The Defence Scientific Advisory Council found that the L21 round hitting end on could penetrate a human skull and lodge in the brain, killing the victim; also that the L21 round posed more risk to innocent bystanders than the L5 due to its greater potential ricochet.

The L21 was replaced by the L60A1 Attenuated Energy Projectile in June 2005 due to tests showing that the L21 was more dangerous than earlier rounds especially when striking the head.

==Usage—plastic baton rounds==
=== Use in Northern Ireland ===
The British Army in Northern Ireland was issued with plastic bullets in August 1972, the intention being to replace the use of rubber bullets, and first used them in February 1973; while the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) first &#x27;tried out&#x27; the new round during a riot on 12 August 1973. Shortly after their introduction it was discovered plastic bullets were lethal at certain ranges. Rubber bullets had been withdrawn from Northern Ireland by the end of 1975.

Fourteen people were killed by plastic bullet impacts; half of them were children and all but one were from the Catholic community. The deaths occurred over 14 years, from 1975 to 1989.
Most of the deaths were allegedly caused by the British security forces misusing the weapon, firing at close range and at chest or head level rather than targeting below the waist.

The first person to be killed by a plastic bullet was 10-year-old Stephen Geddis, who died on 30 August 1975 in hospital, two days after being shot by the British Army in west Belfast. The last person killed was Dominic Marron who was struck in the head in 1981 when he was 14-years-old, and caused him to suffer a fatal heart attack 23 years later on 7 August 2004 at 38-years-old. One of the most high-profile plastic bullet victims was 12-year-old Carol Ann Kelly from west Belfast, who died in hospital on 22 May 1981 after being shot in the head by a member of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers on 19 May 1981.

In 1982, the European Parliament called on member states to ban the use of plastic bullets. However, they continued to be used by the British security forces in Northern Ireland. In 1984 the United Campaign Against Plastic Bullets was founded, calling for plastic bullets to be banned in Northern Ireland. One of its founders, Emma Groves, had been permanently blinded in 1971 when a British soldier shot her in the face with a rubber bullet. During rioting in July 1997, a 14-year-old boy was struck in the head by a plastic bullet and spent three days in a coma.

From 1973 to 1981, just over 42,600 plastic bullets were fired in Northern Ireland. By 2005, 125,000 baton rounds had been fired, most of them plastic bullets.

=== Use elsewhere ===
During the weekend of 20 April 2001, at the anti-FTAA protest in Quebec City, Canada, plastic bullets were used by police forces against protesters attempting to breach the security fences. Plastic bullets were used against protesters at a protest against globalization in Quebec in 2001, where one individual reportedly underwent an emergency tracheotomy after being hit in the throat.

Plastic bullets were approved for policing in England and Wales in June 2001. Plastic bullets were also authorized for G8 summit protests in Gleneagles, Scotland in July 2005. A plastic bullet was successfully used to disarm a hostage taker armed with a machete in Dorchester, England in November 2002.

In September 2004, seven picketing shipbuilders were injured in a tear-gas and plastic bullet assault in Cadiz, Spain.

In 1990, Kenyan riot police raided a room at the University of Nairobi beating students with batons. A fleeing female student was shot in the stomach with a plastic bullet.

Venezuelan police and soldiers fired plastic bullets at student protesters in Caracas in December 2010.

Foam-tipped plastic bullets were employed by U.S. Marines in a trial in the Iraq War but were determined to be ineffectual.

==Usage—penetrating plastic bullets==

=== Use in Israel ===
Israeli plastic bullets are not baton rounds and are capable of penetrating all body tissue.

In August 1988, the Israeli army began using plastic bullets for crowd control by the military administration of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin explained the plastic bullets were intended to cause more injuries to Palestinian rioters. Army commanders hoped that their use would reduce Palestinian stone-throwing, however this did not happen during the first month of their use in which Israeli plastic bullets killed eight Palestinians.

In March 1990, an army report - &quot;Uprising Data&quot; - found 128 &quot;local residents&quot; had been killed by plastic bullets. According to the army rules of engagement the use of plastic bullets is permitted in case of a &quot;violent riot&quot;, defined as: &quot;a disturbance with the participation of three or more persons, including stone throwing, erection of a barrier or barricade, burning a tire.&quot; 
Some of the instructions under Rules of Engagement include:

- Plastic bullet only to be fired under order from commanding officer

- Not to be fired at a range of less than 70 metres

- Aimed below knee

- &quot;Avoid aiming fire at children below the age of 14 and at women.&quot;

From April to May 1989, during the early stages of the First Intifada, five young people were killed by plastic bullets fired by Israeli soldiers, four of whom were under 14 years old.

Following a visit to a Nablus Hospital a group of four Israeli doctors reported: &quot;The plastic bullet can penetrate all tissue. Even if the wound caused by the plastic is less severe than that caused by conventional bullets, it is still a very severe wound. The bullet is capable of striking internal organs, and as occurred in cases that were hospitalised in al-Ittihad hospital, the bullet struck the liver, intestines, spleen and blood vessels. It is superfluous to add that such a wound can be fatal.&quot;

===Use in Jammu and Kashmir===
India&#x27;s Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory in Chandigarh has developed plastic bullets designed to be fired from conventional rifles as an alternative to using pellet guns for crowd control.

These plastic bullets—not baton rounds—can be fired from AK-47 and INSAS rifles and have been used by Indian security forces for crowd control in Jammu and Kashmir in India. They are used along with other riot control agents such as tear gas, chili grenades, and pellet guns (riot shotguns that fire pellet cartridges) by security forces against stone pelting protesters during violent clashes in Jammu and Kashmir.

According to Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) officials, the plastic bullets can only be fired in single shot mode and not in burst mode. The bullets are claimed to penetrate 20mm into human targets.

21,000rounds of plastic bullets were sent to Kashmir in 2018 for riot control. A anonymous source at the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs claimed that the use of plastic bullets is based on the list of non-lethal weapons approved by the United Nations peacekeeping standards for crowd control.

== Design ==
The original UK plastic bullet deployed in 1972 weighs around and was intended to be effective at a range of .

== Recreational use ==
A type of reusable plastic bullet intended for short-range target practice using conventional handguns is available, designed to be propelled purely by an ordinary cartridge primer.

Speer plastic bullets, the only widely available brand, are flat-nosed hollow plastic cylinders, are available in .357/.38/9 mm, .44, and .45 calibers, and are designed for use primarily in revolvers, as the flat nose of the bullet does not feed well in most magazine fed actions. The slow moving plastic bullets may be captured undamaged and reused numerous times if a suitable backstop is used. For use in revolvers, .38 Special and .44 Special versions also include plastic cases, which can be primed and de-primed by hand with minimal tools. For other calibers, standard brass cases are used.

<text>Milk coffee politics or &quot;café com leite&quot; politics () is a term that refers to the oligarchic domination of Brazilian politics under the so-called Old Republic (1889–1930) by the landed gentries of São Paulo (dominated by the coffee industry) and Minas Gerais (dominated by the dairy industry), being represented by the Republican Party of São Paulo (PRP) and the Republican Party of Minas Gerais (PRM).

The name alludes to the popular coffee beverage &quot;café com leite&quot;, (), referring to the states&#x27; respectively dominant industry.

==History==

Under Brazil&#x27;s Old Republic, the patron-client political machines of the countryside enabled agrarian oligarchs, especially coffee planters in the state of São Paulo, to dominate state structures to their advantage, particularly the weak central state structures that effectively devolved power to local agrarian oligarchies.

Under the Old Republic, the coffee with milk politics rested on the domination of the republic&#x27;s politics by the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais — the largest in terms of population and wealth. One can illustrate the extent of that domination by noting that the first presidents of the republic were from São Paulo and thereafter succeeded by an alternation between the outgoing governors of the two leading states in the presidency.

The coffee with milk politics rested on an oligarchic system known as coronelism. Known as the &quot;rule of the colonels&quot;, this term referred to the classic boss system under which the control of patronage was centralized in the hands of a locally dominant oligarch known as a &quot;colonel&quot;, particularly under Brazil&#x27;s Old Republic, who would dispense favors in return for loyalty.

Meanwhile, other states resented this grip on the central state by São Paulo and Minas Gerais. The severe drought of 1877 in the Northeast and the ensuing economic collapse — along with the abolition of slavery in 1888 — propelled the mass labor migration of emancipated slaves and other peasants from Northeast to Southeast, precipitating the decay of established sugar oligarchies of the North. With the concurrent growth of coffee in the Southeast, São Paulo, now emerging as the central state, began to increase in power under the Old Republic. Northeastern landowners bitterly opposed rival oligarchs in São Paulo, explaining their role in the Revolution of 1930.

There were more cases of organized political opposition to the coffee with milk politics before the Revolution of 1930, such as the 1910 presidential election, disputed by Hermes da Fonseca (PRC), supported by Minas Gerais, and Ruy Barbosa (PRP), endorsed by São Paulo by means of the ; the election of Epitácio Pessoa (PRM) in 1919; and the creation of the Liberator Party (PL) in 1928, in Rio Grande do Sul.

In time, growing trade, commerce, and industry in São Paulo would serve to undermine the domination of the republic&#x27;s politics by the landed gentries of the same state (dominated by the coffee industry) and Minas Gerais (dominated by dairy interests) — known then by observers as the politics of &quot;café com leite&quot;. Under Getúlio Vargas, ushered into power by the middle class and agrarian oligarchies of peripheral states resentful of the coffee oligarchs, Brazil moved toward a more centralized state structure that has served to regularize and modernize state governments, moving toward more universal suffrage and secret ballots.

<text>Page 3, or Page Three, was a British newspaper convention of publishing a large image of a topless female glamour model (known as a Page 3 girl) on the third page of mainstream red top tabloids. &quot;The Sun&quot; introduced the feature in November 1970, which boosted its readership and prompted competing tabloids—including &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Sunday People&quot;, and &quot;The&quot; &quot;Daily Star&quot;—to begin featuring topless models on their own third pages. Well-known Page 3 models included Linda Lusardi, Samantha Fox, Debee Ashby, Nicola McLean, Maria Whittaker, Katie Price, Keeley Hazell, and Jakki Degg.
Although Page 3&#x27;s defenders portrayed it as a harmless British cultural tradition, the feature was controversial throughout its history, drawing criticism both from conservatives, who tended to view it as softcore pornography inappropriate for inclusion in national newspapers, and feminists, who argued that Page 3 objectified women&#x27;s bodies, negatively affected girls&#x27; and women&#x27;s body image, and perpetuated sexism. Some politicians, most notably Clare Short and Caroline Lucas, campaigned to have Page 3 images banned from newspapers, although other politicians, including Nick Clegg and Ed Vaizey, expressed concern that such a ban would compromise press freedom. The British government never enacted legislation against Page 3. In 2012, activist Lucy-Anne Holmes launched the No More Page 3 campaign with the goal of persuading newspaper editors and owners to end the feature voluntarily. The campaign gained support from over 140 MPs, as well as a number of trade unions, universities, and women&#x27;s groups. 
In February 2013, Rupert Murdoch, owner of &quot;The Sun,&quot; suggested that Page 3 could become a &quot;halfway house&quot;, featuring glamour photographs without showing nudity. In August of that year, &quot;The Sun&quot;″s Republic of Ireland edition replaced topless Page 3 girls with clothed glamour models. &quot;The Sun&quot;&#x27;s UK editions followed suit in January 2015, discontinuing Page 3 after more than 44 years. In April 2019, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Daily Star&quot; became the last print daily to move to a clothed glamour format, ending the Page 3 convention in Britain&#x27;s mainstream tabloid press. As of 2023, the only British tabloid still publishing topless models is the niche &quot;Sunday Sport&quot;.

After Rupert Murdoch relaunched the loss-making &quot;Sun&quot; newspaper in tabloid format on 17 November 1969, editor Larry Lamb began to publish photographs of clothed glamour models on its third page to compete with &quot;The Sun&quot;″s principal rival, &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;, which was printing photos of models wearing lingerie or bikinis. &quot;The Sun&quot;″s first tabloid edition showed that month&#x27;s Penthouse Pet, Ulla Lindstrom, wearing a suggestively unbuttoned shirt. Page 3 photographs over the following year were often provocative, but did not feature nudity until &quot;The Sun&quot; celebrated the first anniversary of its relaunch on 17 November 1970 by printing model Stephanie Khan in her &quot;birthday suit&quot; (i.e. in the nude). Sitting in a field, with one of her breasts fully visible from the side, Khan was photographed by Beverley Goodway, who became &quot;The Sun&quot;″s principal Page 3 photographer until he retired in 2003. Alison Webster took over Goodway&#x27;s role in 2005 and remained until the feature was phased out. 

Page 3 was not a daily feature at the beginning of the 1970s, and &quot;The Sun&quot; only gradually began to feature Page 3 models in more overtly topless poses. Believing that Page 3 should feature &quot;nice girls&quot;, Lamb sought to avoid the image of top-shelf pornography titles by asking &quot;The Sun&quot;&#x27;s female reporters to review Page 3 images to ensure women would not regard them as &quot;dirty&quot;. Regardless, the feature, and the paper&#x27;s other sexual content, led to some public libraries banning &quot;The Sun&quot;. A then Conservative-controlled council in Sowerby Bridge, Yorkshire, took the first such decision, but reversed it after a series of local stunts organised by the newspaper and a change in the council&#x27;s political orientation in 1971.
Page 3 is partly credited with boosting &quot;The Sun&quot;″s circulation. In the year after it introduced Page 3, its daily sales doubled to over 2.5 million, and it became the UK&#x27;s bestselling newspaper by 1978. Competing tabloids, including &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;, &quot;The Sunday People&quot;, and &quot;The Daily Star&quot;, also began publishing topless models to increase their own sales, although &quot;The&quot; &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;The&quot; &quot;Sunday People&quot; discontinued the practice in the 1980s, calling the photographs demeaning to women. In 1986, David Sullivan launched &quot;The Sunday Sport&quot;, which featured numerous images of topless models throughout each edition. In 1988, &quot;The Sun&quot; launched the companion feature &quot;Page 7 Fella&quot;, which featured images of barechested male models. It did not gain popularity and was dropped in the 1990s.
Page 3 launched the careers of many well-known 1980s British glamour models, including Debee Ashby, Donna Ewin, Samantha Fox, Kirsten Imrie, Kathy Lloyd, Gail McKenna, Suzanne Mizzi, and Maria Whittaker, some of whom were aged 16 or 17 when they started modeling for the feature. Some Page 3 girls became well-known celebrities and went on to careers in entertainment. Fox, who began appearing on Page 3 as a 16-year-old in 1983, became one of the most-photographed British women of the 1980s, behind only Princess Diana and Margaret Thatcher. After leaving Page 3, she launched a successful singing career.
In the mid-1990s, &quot;The Sun&quot; began printing Page 3 photographs in colour as standard, rather than mostly in black and white. Captions to Page 3 images, which had previously contained sexually suggestive double entendre, were replaced by a listing of models&#x27; first names, ages, and hometowns. It later added a &quot;News in Briefs&quot; item that gave the model&#x27;s thoughts on current affairs. After polling readers, in 1997 &quot;The Sun&quot; ceased featuring models who had undergone breast augmentation, such as Katie Price and Melinda Messenger. In June 1999, it launched the official &quot;Page3.com&quot; website, which featured additional photos of current Page 3 models, archival images of former Page 3 models, and other related photo and video content.
Beginning in 2002, &quot;The Sun&quot; ran an annual contest called Page 3 Idol. Amateur models could submit photographs to be voted on by readers, with the winner receiving a cash prize and a Page 3 modeling contract. Notable Page 3 Idol winners included Nicola T, Keeley Hazell, and Lucy Collett. 
In May 2004, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 came into effect in England and Wales, Section 45 of which raised the minimum age to appear in such publications from 16 to 18. 
In 2020, Channel 4 produced an hour-long documentary, &quot;Page Three: The Naked Truth&quot;, to mark 50 years since &quot;The Sun&quot; first introduced Page 3.

==Opposition==

Page 3 was controversial and divisive throughout its history. Its defenders often characterised it as an inoffensive British cultural tradition, as when Conservative Party MP Richard Drax in 2013 called it a &quot;national institution&quot; that provided &quot;light and harmless entertainment&quot;. Its critics generally considered Page 3 images demeaning to women or as softcore pornography that should not be published in national newspapers readily available to children. Some politicians—notably Labour Party MPs Clare Short, Harriet Harman, and Stella Creasy, Liberal Democrat MP Lynne Featherstone, and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas—made efforts to have Page 3 removed from newspapers&quot;.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;The Sun&quot; vigorously defended the feature, typically representing Page 3&#x27;s critics as prudes, spoilsports, or ideologues, while sometimes depicting female critics as physically unattractive and jealous. When Clare Short in 1986 tried to introduce a House of Commons bill banning topless models from British newspapers, &quot;The Sun&quot; ran a &quot;Stop Crazy Clare&quot; campaign, distributing free car stickers, calling Short a &quot;killjoy&quot;, printing unflattering images of her, and polling readers on whether they would prefer to see Short&#x27;s face or the back of a bus.
As a co-founder of Women in Journalism, Rebekah Brooks was reported to be personally offended by Page 3, and was widely expected to terminate it when she became &quot;The Sun&quot;″s first female editor in 2003. However, upon assuming her editorship, Brooks defended the feature, calling its models &quot;intelligent, vibrant young women who appear in &quot;The Sun&quot; out of choice and because they enjoy the job.&quot; When Clare Short stated in a 2004 interview that she wanted to &quot;take the pornography out of our press&quot;, saying &quot;I&#x27;d love to ban [Page 3 because it] degrades women and our country&quot;, Brooks targeted Short with a &quot;Hands Off Page 3&quot; campaign that included printing an image of Short&#x27;s face superimposed on a topless woman&#x27;s body, calling Short &quot;fat and jealous&quot;, and parking a double-decker bus with a delegation of Page 3 models outside Short&#x27;s home. &quot;The Sun&quot; also called Harman a &quot;feminist fanatic&quot; and Featherstone a &quot;battleaxe&quot; for their opposition to Page 3. Brooks later said that she regretted &quot;The Sun&quot;″s &quot;cruel and harsh&quot; attacks on Short, listing them among the mistakes she had made as editor.
In February 2012, the Leveson Inquiry heard arguments for and against Page 3. Women&#x27;s advocacy groups argued that Page 3 demeaned women and promoted sexist attitudes, but &quot;The&quot; &quot;Sun&#x27;s&quot; then-editor Dominic Mohan called the feature an &quot;innocuous British institution&quot; that had become &quot;part of British society&quot;. In his report, Lord Justice Leveson called Page 3 &quot;a taste and decency issue&quot; and stated that it thus fell outside his remit of investigating media ethics. Clare Short questioned Leveson&#x27;s finding, stating: &quot;Surely the depiction of half the population in a way that is now illegal on workplace walls and before the watershed in broadcasting, is an issue of media ethics?&quot;
Lucy-Anne Holmes, a writer and actress from Brighton, began campaigning against Page 3 after noticing during the 2012 Summer Olympics that the largest photograph of a woman in the nation&#x27;s best-selling newspaper was not of an Olympic athlete but of &quot;a young woman in her knickers&quot;. Arguing that Page 3 perpetuated sexism, portrayed women as sex objects, negatively affected girls&#x27; and women&#x27;s body image, and contributed to a culture of sexual violence, Holmes launched the No More Page 3 campaign in August of that year. The campaign collected over 240,000 signatures on an online petition and gained support from over 140 MPs, as well as a number of trade unions, universities, charities, and women&#x27;s advocacy groups. It sponsored two women&#x27;s soccer teams, Nottingham Forest Women F.C. and Cheltenham Town L.F.C., who played with the &quot;No More Page 3&quot; logo on their shirts. 
Lynne Featherstone called for a ban on Page 3 in September 2012, claiming that it contributed to domestic violence against women. Then–deputy prime minister Nick Clegg expressed concern that banning the images would compromise freedom of the press, stating: &quot;If you don&#x27;t like it, don&#x27;t buy it ... you don&#x27;t want to have a moral policeman or woman in Whitehall telling people what they can and cannot see.&quot; In June 2013, Caroline Lucas defied parliamentary dress code by wearing a &quot;No More Page Three&quot; T-shirt during a House of Commons debate on media sexism. She stated: &quot;If Page 3 still hasn&#x27;t been removed from &quot;The Sun&quot; by the end of [2013], I think we should be asking the government to step in and legislate.&quot; Culture minister Ed Vaizey responded that the government did not plan to regulate the content of the press, saying that adults had the right to choose what they read. Then–prime minister David Cameron also declined to support a ban on Page 3, stating during an interview with BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;: &quot;This is an area where we should leave it to consumers to decide, rather than to regulators.&quot; After becoming &quot;The Sun&quot;&#x27;s editor in June 2013, David Dinsmore confirmed he would continue printing photographs of topless models, calling it &quot;a good way of selling newspapers&quot;.

==End of the feature==

In February 2013, Rupert Murdoch suggested on Twitter that &quot;The Sun&quot; could transition to a &quot;halfway house&quot;, featuring glamour photographs without showing nudity. In August 2013, editor Paul Clarkson replaced topless Page 3 girls with clothed glamour models in &quot;The Sun&quot;″s Republic of Ireland edition, citing cultural differences between the UK and Ireland. The No More Page 3 campaign thanked Clarkson for &quot;taking the lead in the dismantling of a sexist institution&quot; and asked David Dinsmore to follow suit with &quot;The Sun&quot;&#x27;s UK editions.
After publishing Page 3 for over 44 years, on 17 January 2015 &quot;The Sun&quot; began featuring images of women wearing lingerie and bikinis on its third page. On 20 January, &quot;The Times&quot;, another Murdoch title, reported that the tabloid was &quot;quietly dropping one of the most controversial traditions of British journalism.&quot; The decision to discontinue Page 3 received significant media attention. On 22 January, &quot;The Sun&quot; appeared to change course, publishing a Page 3 image of a winking model with her breasts fully exposed and a caption mocking those who had commented on the end of the feature. However, &quot;The Sun&quot; did not feature Page 3 thereafter.
Longtime campaigner Clare Short called the decision to terminate the feature &quot;an important public victory for dignity&quot;, while Nicky Morgan, then Minister for Women and Equalities, called it &quot;a small but significant step towards improving the media portrayal of women and girls&quot;. A spokeswoman for the No More Page 3 campaign called it &quot;truly historic news&quot; and &quot;a huge step for challenging media sexism&quot;. Caroline Lucas criticized the transition to clothed glamour, saying: &quot;So long as &quot;The Sun&quot; reserves its right to print the odd topless shot, and reserves its infamous page for girls clad in bikinis, the conversation isn&#x27;t over.&quot; 
Some former Page 3 models defended the feature and the women who had appeared in it. Appearing on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;, model Nicola McLean called Page 3 models &quot;strong-minded women&quot; who &quot;certainly don&#x27;t feel like we have been victimised&quot;. In a televised debate with Harman and Germaine Greer, model Chloe Goodman challenged the other participants to explain why feminists were telling women how to live their lives. Harman responded: &quot;In a hundred years&#x27; time, if you look back at the newspapers of this country, and you see women standing in their knickers with their breasts showing, what would you think about women&#x27;s role in society?&quot; Separately, Debee Ashby, who had first appeared on Page 3 in the 1980s at age 16, called its cancellation long overdue.
Despite abolishing the feature in its print editions, &quot;The Sun&quot; continued publishing topless images on its official Page3.com website until March 2017. No new online content appeared after that point, and the website was taken offline in 2018. In April 2019, &quot;The Daily Star&quot; shifted to a clothed glamour format, becoming the last mainstream print daily to discontinue printing topless images. This ended the tradition in the mainstream British press, with only the niche &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; continuing to publish topless images in tabloid format as of 2023.

==Television documentary==
On the fiftieth anniversary of the Page 3 feature, British television carried a documentary titled &quot;Page Three: The Naked Truth&quot; on Channel Four, which aired on June 17, 2024. It included stories and updates about the lives of some of the women who appeared in the magazine over the years. After it aired, it was the most popular search term on Wikipedia, garnering 589,000 page views in a single day.
For the month of June it tallied more than 800,000 views, against 25,000 for a typical month.

<text>Plagiaulacidae is a family of fossil mammals within the order Multituberculata. Remains are known from the Upper Jurassic and earliest Cretaceous of North America and Europe. They were among the more derived representatives of the informal suborder of &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot;.

The taxon Plagiaulacidae was named by Gill T.N. in 1872. It is also known as Bolodontidae, a name developed by Osborn H.F. in 1887.

<text>Morrisonodon brentbaatar is an extinct multituberculate mammal from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of North America.

&quot;M. brentbaatar&quot; was described by Robert T. Bakker in 1998, who originally placed it in the genus &quot;Ctenacodon&quot;. The fossil remains consist of a jaw fragment containing two upper premolars and the sockets corresponding to two molars. The remains were found in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation in Wyoming. The species name honours the Wyoming paleontologist Brent Breithaupt, while &quot;Baatar&quot; is a Mongolian for &quot;hero&quot;.

Bakker assigned his specimens to &quot;Ctenacodon&quot; with hesitation, noting additional specimens may require a new classification. In a 2001 review of multituberculates, Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska and Jørn Hurum did not recognize Bakker&#x27;s specimen as related to other &quot;Ctenacodon&quot; species or even belonging to the family Allodontidae, speculating the species might instead belong to the family Plagiaulacidae. In 2004, the species was placed in the newly established genus &quot;Morrisonodon&quot;.

<text>Bayreuth () is a (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It surrounds, but does not include the city of Bayreuth. The district is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Kulmbach, Hof, Wunsiedel, Tirschenreuth, Neustadt an der Waldnaab, Amberg-Sulzbach, Nürnberger Land, Forchheim and Bamberg.

==History==
The district was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Bayreuth and Pegnitz, adding the town Gefrees of the former district of Münchberg and the town of Speichersdorf of the former district of Kemnath.

==Geography==
The sources of the White Main and the Red Main are both located in the district. The Red Main rises in the very south in the hills of the Frankish Alb, the White Main has its source in the Fichtel Mountains in the east. Both rivers run to the northwest, but do not meet within the district&#x27;s borders.

The valley of the Red Main separates the two major geographical regions of the district from each other: the hilly countryside of the Franconian Jura and the much higher Fichtel Mountains.

Within the county lies the Veldenstein Forest, one of the largest contiguous areas of woodland in Bavaria.

==Coat of arms==
The arms display the heraldic eagle of the Hohenzollern dynasty together with the white and blue pattern of Bavaria.
