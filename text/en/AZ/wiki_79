<text>In Christianity, the Biblical Magi ( or ; singular: ), also known as the Three Wise Men, Three Kings, and Three Magi, are distinguished foreigners who visit Jesus after his birth, bearing gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh in homage to him. They are commemorated on the feast day of Epiphany—sometimes called &quot;Three Kings Day&quot;—and commonly appear in the nativity celebrations of Christmas.

The Magi appear solely in the Gospel of Matthew, which states that they came &quot;from the east&quot; (Greek ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν - &quot;apo anatolōn&quot;) to worship the &quot;one who has been born king of the Jews&quot;. Their names, origins, appearances, and exact number are unmentioned and derive from the inferences or traditions of later Christians. In Western Christianity, they are usually assumed to have been three in number, corresponding with each gift; in Eastern Christianity, especially the Syriac churches, they often number twelve. Likewise, the Magi&#x27;s social status is never stated: although some biblical translations describe them as astrologers, they were increasingly identified as kings by at least the third century, which conformed with Christian interpretations of Old Testament prophecies that the messiah would be worshipped by kings.

The mystery of the Magi&#x27;s identities and background, combined with their theological significance, has made them prominent figures in the Christian tradition; they are venerated as saints or even martyrs in many Christian communities, and are the subject of numerous artworks, legends, and customs. Both secular and Christian observers have noted that the Magi popularly serve as a means of expressing various ideas, symbols, and themes. Most scholars regard the Magi as legendary rather than historical figures.

==Biblical account==

Traditional nativity scenes depict three &quot;wise men&quot; visiting the infant Jesus on the night of his birth, in a manger accompanied by the shepherds and angels, but this should be understood as an artistic convention allowing the two separate scenes of the Adoration of the Shepherds on the birth night and the later Adoration of the Magi to be combined for convenience. The single biblical account in simply presents an event at an unspecified point after Jesus&#x27;s birth in which an unnumbered party of unnamed &quot;wise men&quot; () visits him in a house (), not a stable. The New Revised Standard Version of Matthew 2:1–12 describes the visit of the Magi in this manner:

The text specifies no interval between the birth and the visit, and artistic depictions and the closeness of the traditional dates of December 25 and January 6 encourage the popular assumption that the visit took place the same winter as the birth, but later traditions varied, with the visit taken as occurring up to two winters later. This maximum interval explained Herod&#x27;s command at Matthew 2:16–18 that the Massacre of the Innocents included boys up to two years old. Some more recent commentators, not tied to the traditional feast days, suggest a variety of intervals.

The wise men are mentioned twice shortly thereafter in verse 16, in reference to their avoidance of Herod after seeing Jesus, and what Herod had learned from their earlier meeting. The star which they followed has traditionally become known as the Star of Bethlehem.

==Description==

The Magi are popularly referred to as &quot;wise men&quot; and &quot;kings&quot;. The word is the plural of Latin , borrowed from Greek (), as used in the original Greek text of the Gospel of Matthew (in the plural: ). The Greek itself is derived from Old Persian &quot;maguŝ,&quot; which in turn originated from the Avestan &quot;magâunô&quot;, referring to the Iranian priestly caste of Zoroastrianism. Within this tradition, priests paid particular attention to the stars and gained an international reputation for astrology, which was at that time highly regarded as a science. Their religious practices and astrological abilities caused derivatives of the term &quot;Magi&quot; to be applied to the occult in general and led to the English term &quot;magic&quot;.

The King James Version translates &quot;magi&quot; as &quot;wise men&quot;; the same translation is applied to the wise men led by Daniel of earlier Hebrew Scriptures (). The same word is given as &quot;sorcerer&quot; and &quot;sorcery&quot; when describing &quot;Elymas the sorcerer&quot; in , and Simon Magus, considered a heretic by the early Church, in . Several translations refer to the men outright as astrologers at Matthew Chapter 2, including New English Bible (1961); The New Testament in Modern English (J.B.Phillips, 1972); Twentieth Century New Testament (1904 revised edition); Amplified Bible (1958, New Testament); An American Translation (1935, Goodspeed); and The Living Bible (K. Taylor, 1962, New Testament).

Although the Magi are commonly referred to as &quot;kings&quot;, there is nothing in the Gospel of Matthew that implies they were rulers of any kind. The identification of the Magi as kings is linked to Old Testament prophecies that describe the Messiah being worshipped by kings in Isaiah 60:3, Psalm , and , which reads, &quot;Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations serve him.&quot; Early readers reinterpreted Matthew in light of these prophecies and elevated the Magi to kings, which became widely accepted by at least 500 A.D. Later Christian interpretation stressed the adoration of the Magi and shepherds as the first recognition by humans of Christ as the Redeemer. However, the Protestant reformer John Calvin was vehemently opposed to referring to the Magi as kings, writing: &quot;But the most ridiculous contrivance of the Papists on this subject is, that those men were kings... Beyond all doubt, they have been stupefied by a righteous judgment of God, that all might laugh at [their] gross ignorance.&quot;

== Identities and background ==
The names and origins of the Magi are never given in scripture, but have been provided by various traditions and legends.

Among Western Christians, the earliest and most common names are:
* Melchior (; also Melichior).
* Caspar ( or ; also Gaspar, Jaspar, Jaspas, Gathaspa, and other variations).
* Balthazar ( or ; also Balthasar, Balthassar, and Bithisarea).

These names first appear in an eighth century religious chronicle, &quot;Excerpta Latina Barbari,&quot; which is a Latin translation of a lost Greek manuscript probably composed in Alexandria roughly two centuries earlier. Another eighth century text, &quot;Collectanea et Flores&quot;, which was likewise a Latin translation from an original Greek account, continues the tradition of three kings and their names and gives additional details.

One candidate for the origin of the name Caspar appears in the apocryphal Acts of Thomas, which gives the account of Thomas the Apostle&#x27;s visit to the Indo-Parthian King Gondophares I (21– c. 47 AD), also known as Gudapharasa, from which &quot;Caspar&quot; might derive as corruption of &quot;Gaspar&quot;. Gondophares had declared independence from the Arsacids and ruled a kingdom spanning present-day Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. According to historian Ernst Herzfeld, his name is perpetuated in the name of the Afghan city Kandahar, which he is said to have founded under the name Gundopharron.

Within Eastern Christianity, the Magi have varied names. Among Syrian Christians, they are &quot;Larvandad&quot;, &quot;Gushnasaph&quot;, and &quot;Hormisdas;&quot;, which are approximations of typical Zoroastrian names, in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, they are &quot;Hor&quot;, &quot;Karsudan&quot;, and &quot;Basanater&quot;, while Armenian Catholics have &quot;Kagpha&quot;, &quot;Badadakharida&quot; and &quot;Badadilma&quot;.

The list given by Michael the Syrian in his chronicle has these eleven names:
* Dahdnadur, son of Artaban
* Waštaph, son of Gudpir
* Aršak, son of Mahduq
* Zerwand, son of Warudud
* Ariwah, son of Khosrow
* Arṭaḥšišt, son of Ḥōlīṭ
* Eštanbuzan, son of Šišrawan
* Mahduq, son of Hawahm
* Aḥšireš, son of Ṣaḥban
* Ṣardanaḥ, son of Baladan
* Marduk, son of Bīl

These are all Iranian Zoroastrian names, or pseudo-Iranian Zoroastrian names. &quot;Waštaph&quot; certainly reflects Vishtaspa, the name of the first king to have converted to Zoroastrianism, but also a common Zoroastrian name at the time. Arṭaḥšišt is an archaic form of the common name &quot;Ardeshir&quot;. &quot;Marduk&quot; should be a variant of &quot;mard&quot; &quot;man&quot; with the suffix &quot;-ōk&quot;. This fits with the fact that, in Michael&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot;, &quot;mage&quot; in other parts simply means &quot;Zoroastrian&quot;, and with the idea that these mage kings should simply be Zoroastrian officials, coming to recognize Jesus as a holy figure.

Many Chinese Christians believe that one of the magi came from China.

=== Country of origin and journey ===
The phrase &quot;from the east&quot; (), more literally &quot;from the rising [of the sun]&quot;, is the only information Matthew provides about the region from which they came. The Parthian Empire, centered in Iran (Persia), stretched from eastern Syria to the fringes of India. Though the empire was tolerant of other religions, its dominant religion was Zoroastrianism, with its priestly &quot;magos&quot; class.

Although Matthew&#x27;s account does not explicitly cite the motivation for their journey (other than seeing the star in the east, which they took to be the star of the King of the Jews), the apocryphal Syriac Infancy Gospel states in its third chapter that they were pursuing a prophecy from their prophet, Zoradascht (Zoroaster).

There is an Armenian tradition identifying the &quot;Magi of Bethlehem&quot; as Balthasar of Arabia, Melchior of Persia, and Caspar of India. Historian John of Hildesheim relates a tradition in the ancient Silk Road city of Taxila (in present-day Punjab, Pakistan) that one of the Magi passed through the city on the way to Bethlehem.

Sebastian Brock, a historian of Christianity, has said: &quot;It was no doubt among converts from Zoroastrianism that... certain legends were developed around the Magi of the Gospels&quot;. And Anders Hultgård concluded that the Gospel story of the Magi was influenced by an Iranian legend concerning magi and a star, which was connected with Persian beliefs in the rise of a star predicting the birth of a ruler and with myths describing the manifestation of a divine figure in fire and light.

A model for the homage of the Magi might have been provided, it has been suggested, by the journey to Rome of King Tiridates I of Armenia, with his magi, to pay homage to the Emperor Nero, which took place in AD 66, a few years before the date assigned to the composition of the Gospel of Matthew.

There was a tradition that the Central Asian Naimans and their Christian relatives, the Keraites, were descended from the biblical Magi. This heritage passed to the Mongol dynasty of Genghis Khan when Sorghaghtani, niece of the Keraite ruler Toghrul, married Tolui, the youngest son of Genghis, and became the mother of Möngke Khan and his younger brother and successor, Kublai Khan. Toghrul became identified with the legendary Central Asian Christian king Prester John, whose Mongol descendants were sought as allies against the Muslims by contemporary European monarchs and popes. Sempad the Constable, elder brother of King Hetoum I of Cilician Armenia, visited the Mongol court in Karakorum in 1247–1250 and in 1254. He wrote a letter to Henry I King of Cyprus and Queen Stephanie (Sempad&#x27;s sister) from Samarkand in 1243, in which he said: &quot;Tanchat [Tangut, or Western Xia], which is the land from whence came the Three Kings to Bethlehem to worship the Lord Jesus which was born. And know that the power of Christ has been, and is, so great, that the people of that land are Christians; and the whole land of Chata [Khitai, or Kara-Khitai] believes those Three Kings. I have myself been in their churches and have seen pictures of Jesus Christ and the Three Kings, one offering gold, the second frankincense, and the third myrrh. And it is through those Three Kings that they believe in Christ, and that the Chan and his people have now become Christians.&quot; The legendary Christian ruler of Central Asia Prester John was reportedly a descendant of one of the Magi.

In her four volumes of visions of the life of Christ, Anne Catherine Emmerich says that the Magi came from the border between Chaldea and Elam, mentioning Ur, &quot;Mozian&quot; (Iraq&#x27;s Maysan Province, anciently known as Mesene), &quot;Sikdor&quot; (Shushtar, near Susa), and a &quot;city, whose name sounded to me something like Acajaja&quot; (Aghajari), as well as other cities farther east.

=== Later interpretations ===

Apart from their names, the three Magi developed distinct characteristics in Christian tradition, so that between them they represented the three ages of (adult) man, three geographical and cultural areas, and sometimes other concepts. In one tradition, reflected in art by at least the 14th century—for example, in the Arena Chapel by Giotto in 1305—Caspar is old, normally with a white beard, and gives the gold; he is &quot;King of Tarsus, land of merchants&quot; on the Mediterranean coast of modern Turkey, and is first in line to kneel to Christ. Melchior is middle-aged, giving frankincense from Arabia, and Balthazar is a young man, very often and increasingly black-skinned, with myrrh from Saba (modern southern Yemen). Their ages were often given as 60, 40 and 20 respectively, and their geographical origins were rather variable, with Balthazar increasingly coming from Aksum or other parts of Africa, and being represented accordingly.

Balthazar&#x27;s blackness has been the subject of considerable recent scholarly attention; in art, it is found mostly in northern Europe, beginning from the 12th century, and becoming very common in the north by the 15th. The subject of which king is which and who brought which gift is not without some variation depending on the tradition. The gift of gold is sometimes associated with Melchior as well, and in some traditions Melchior is the oldest of the three Magi.

==== Gestures of respect ====
The Magi are described as &quot;falling down&quot;, &quot;kneeling&quot;, or &quot;bowing&quot; in the worship of Jesus. This gesture, together with Luke&#x27;s birth narrative, had an important effect on Christian religious practices. They were indicative of great respect, and typically used when venerating a king. While prostration is now rarely practised in the West, it is still relatively common in the Eastern Churches, especially during Lent. Kneeling has remained an important element of Christian worship to this day.

==Gifts of the Magi==


Three gifts are explicitly identified in Matthew: gold, frankincense and myrrh; in Koine Greek, these are (), () and (). There are various theories and interpretations of the meaning and symbolism of the gifts, particularly with respect to frankincense and myrrh.

The theories generally break down into two groups:
# All three gifts are ordinary offerings and gifts given to a king. Myrrh being commonly used as an anointing oil, frankincense as a perfume, and gold as a valuable.
# The three gifts had a spiritual meaning: gold as a symbol of kingship on earth, frankincense (an incense) as a symbol of deity, and myrrh (an embalming oil) as a symbol of death.
#: *This dates back to Origen in &quot;Contra Celsum&quot;: &quot;gold, as to a king; myrrh, as to one who was mortal; and incense, as to a God.&quot;
#: *These interpretations are alluded to in the verses of the popular carol &quot;We Three Kings&quot; in which the magi describe their gifts. The last verse includes a summary of the interpretation: &quot;Glorious now behold Him arise/King and God and sacrifice.&quot;
#: *Sometimes this is described more generally as gold symbolizing virtue, frankincense symbolizing prayer, and myrrh symbolizing suffering.

Frankincense and myrrh were burned during rituals among Egyptian, Greek and Roman societies. Ancient Egyptians used myrrh to embalm corpses and Romans burned it as a type of incense at funeral pyres. Myrrh was used as an embalming ointment and as a penitential incense in funerals and cremations until the 15th century. The &quot;holy oil&quot; traditionally used by the Eastern Orthodox Church for performing the sacraments of chrismation and unction is traditionally scented with myrrh, and receiving either of these sacraments is commonly referred to as &quot;receiving the myrrh&quot;. The picture of the Magi on the 7th-century Franks Casket shows the third visitor – he who brings myrrh – with a valknut over his back, a pagan symbol referring to Death.

It has been suggested by scholars that the &quot;gifts&quot; were medicinal rather than precious material for tribute.

The Syrian King Seleucus I Nicator is recorded to have offered gold, frankincense and myrrh (among other items) to Apollo in his temple at Didyma near Miletus in 288/7 BC, and this may have been the precedent for the mention of these three gifts in Gospel of Matthew (2:11). It was these three gifts, it is thought, which were the chief cause for the number of the Magi becoming fixed eventually at three.

This episode can be linked to Isaiah 60 and to Psalm 72, which report gifts being given by kings, and this has played a central role in the perception of the Magi as kings, rather than as astronomer-priests. In a hymn of the late 4th-century Hispanic poet Prudentius, the three gifts have already gained their medieval interpretation as prophetic emblems of Jesus&#x27; identity, familiar in the carol &quot;We Three Kings&quot; by John Henry Hopkins, Jr., 1857.

John Chrysostom suggested that the gifts were fit to be given not just to a king but to God, and contrasted them with the Jews&#x27; traditional offerings of sheep and calves, and accordingly Chrysostom asserts that the Magi worshiped Jesus as God.

What subsequently happened to these gifts is never mentioned in the scripture, but several traditions have developed. One story has the gold being stolen by the two thieves who were later crucified alongside Jesus. Another tale has it being entrusted to and then misappropriated by Judas. One tradition suggests that Joseph and Mary used the gold to finance their travels when they fled Bethlehem after an angel had warned, in a dream, about King Herod&#x27;s plan to kill Jesus. And another story proposes the theory that the myrrh given to them at Jesus&#x27; birth was used to anoint Jesus&#x27; body after his crucifixion.

There was a 15th-century golden case purportedly containing the Gift of the Magi housed in the Monastery of St. Paul of Mount Athos. It was donated to the monastery in the 15th century by Mara Branković, daughter of the King of Serbia Đurađ Branković, wife to the Ottoman Sultan Murat II and godmother to Mehmet II the Conqueror (of Constantinople). After the Athens earthquake of September 7, 1999, they were temporarily displayed in Athens to strengthen faith and raise money for earthquake victims. The relics were displayed in Ukraine and Belarus in Christmas of 2014, and thus left Greece for the first time since the 15th century.

According to the book &quot;The Travels of Marco Polo&quot;, gold symbolises the power over the material world as a king on earth, frankincense symbolises the power over the spiritual world as a deity, and myrrh symbolises the healing power over death.

==Religious significance and traditions==
Holidays celebrating the arrival of the Magi traditionally recognise a distinction between the date of their arrival and the date of Jesus&#x27; birth. The account given in the Gospel of Matthew does not state that they were present on the night of the birth; in the Gospel of Luke, Joseph and Mary remain in Bethlehem until it is time for Jesus&#x27; dedication in Jerusalem, after which they return to their home in Nazareth.

The visit of the Magi is commemorated in most Western Christian churches separately from Christmas. The visit of the Magi is part of the Epiphany on 6 January, which concludes the twelve days of Christmas; on that date the Magi are also celebrated as saints.

The Eastern Orthodox and Greek Orthodox celebrate the visit of the Magi on the same date as their Christmas, which is either 25 December, 6 January, or 7 January, depending on if they follow the Gregorian calendar or the Julian calendar.

One story in Syriac Christianity in the era of the late Roman Empire and early post-Islamic conquest period, the Revelation of the Magi, indicates that the Magi arrived in April (rather than January). It also implies the Magi arrived before Jesus&#x27;s birth, while Mary was still pregnant, yet nevertheless a celestial child of the transformed Star of Bethlehem was able to commission them, suggesting that Jesus could be in multiple places at once.

The Quran does not contain Matthew&#x27;s episode of the Magi. However, the Persian Muslim encyclopedist al-Tabari, writing in the ninth century, gives the familiar symbolism of the gifts of the Magi, citing the late seventh century Persian-Yemenite writer Wahb ibn Munabbih.

===Spanish and Hispanic customs===
In much of the Spanish-speaking world, the Three Kings (, , or simply ) receive letters from children and so bring them gifts on the morning of 6 January. In Spain, each one of the Magi is supposed to represent a different continent: Europe (Melchior), Asia (Caspar) and Africa (Balthasar). According to the tradition, the Magi come from the Orient on their camels to visit the houses of all the children, much like Sinterklaas and Santa Claus with his reindeer elsewhere.

Almost every Spanish city or town organises in the evening of 5 January, in which the kings and their pages parade and throw sweets to the children (and parents) in attendance. The cavalcade of the three kings in Alcoy claims to be the longest-running in the world, having started in 1886. The Mystery Play of the Three Magic Kings is also presented on Epiphany Eve. There is also a &quot;Roscón&quot; (Spain) or &quot;Rosca de Reyes&quot; (Mexico).

In Spain, due to the lack of a black population until recently, the role of Balthazar has often been played by an actor in blackface; this practice has been criticized in the 21st century.

Not only in Spain, but also in Argentina, Mexico, Paraguay, and Uruguay, there is a long tradition of children receiving presents by the three on the night of 5 January (Epiphany Eve) or on the morning of 6 January (Epiphany day or ), because it is believed that this is the day in which the Magi arrived bearing gifts for the Christ child. In most Latin American countries children also cut grass or greenery on 5 January and fill a box or their shoes with the cuttings for the Kings&#x27; camels. They then place the box or their shoes under their bed or beside the Christmas tree. On Epiphany morning the children will find the grass gone from their shoes or box and replaced with candy and other small, sweet treats. 

In Spain and most Latin American countries, which are predominantly Roman Catholic, the Christmas Season starts on 8 December (day of the Immaculate Conception, also known as day of the Virgin Mary) and ends with the last hour of 6 January, . In the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, however, there are eight more days of celebration called (the little eight days). According to the Catholic Church, the full Christmas Season is from 25 December to Candlemas on 2 February.

In the Philippines, beliefs concerning the Three Kings (Filipino: &quot;Tatlóng Haring Mago&quot;, lit. &quot;Three Magi Kings&quot;; shortened to &quot;Tatlóng Harì&quot; or Spanish ) follows Hispanic influence, with the Feast of the Epiphany considered by many Filipinos as the traditional end of their Christmas season. The tradition of the Three Kings&#x27; is today done only in some areas, such as the old city of Intramuros in Manila, and the island of Marinduque. Another dying custom is children leaving shoes out on Epiphany Eve, so that they may receive sweets and money from the Three Kings. With the arrival of American culture in the early 20th century, the Three Kings as gift-givers have been largely replaced in urban areas by Santa Claus, and they only survive in the greeting &quot;Happy Three Kings!&quot; and the surname &quot;Tatlóngharì&quot;. The Three Kings are enshrined as patron saints in the National Shrine of Virgen La Divina Pastora in Gapan, Nueva Ecija.

===Central Europe===


A tradition in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, and German-speaking Catholic areas is the writing of the three kings&#x27; initials above the main door of Catholic homes in chalk. This is a new year&#x27;s blessing for the occupants and the initials also are believed to also stand for &quot;Christus mansionem benedicat&quot; (&quot;May/Let Christ Bless This House&quot;). Depending on the city or town, this will be happen sometime between Christmas and the Epiphany, with most municipalities celebrating closer to the Epiphany. Also in Catholic parts of the German-speaking world, these markings are made by the (literally, &quot;star singers&quot;) – a group of children dressed up as the magi. The carry a star representing the one followed by the biblical magi and sing Christmas carols as they go door to door, such as &quot;Stern über Bethlehem&quot;. After singing, the children write the three kings&#x27; initials on the door frame in exchange for charitable donations. Each year, German and Austrian dioceses pick one charity towards which all donations nationwide will be contributed.

Traditionally, one child in the group is said to represent Baltasar from Africa and so, that child typically wears blackface makeup. Many Germans do not consider this to be racist because it is not intended to be a negative portrayal of a black person, but rather, a &quot;realistic&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot; portrayal of one. The dialogue surrounding the politics of traditions involving blackface is not as developed as in Spain or the Netherlands. In the past, photographs of German politicians together with children in blackface have caused a stir in English-language press. Moreover, Afro-Germans have written that this use of blackface is a missed opportunity to be truly inclusive of Afro-Germans in German-speaking communities and contribute to the equation of &quot;blackness&quot; with &quot;foreignness&quot; and &quot;otherness&quot; in German culture.

In 2010, Epiphany was made a holiday in Poland, thus reviving a pre-World War II tradition. Since 2011, celebrations with biblical costuming have taken place throughout the country. For example, in Warsaw there are processions from Plac Zamkowy down Krakowskie Przedmieście to Plac Piłsudskiego.

===Cake===
In Spain and Portugal, a ring-shaped cake (in Portuguese: ) contains both a small figurine of one of the Magi (or another surprise depending on the region) and a dry broad bean. The one who gets the figurine is &quot;crowned&quot; (with a crown made of cardboard or paper), but whoever gets the bean has to pay the value of the cake to the person who originally bought it. In Mexico they also have the same ring-shaped cake (Kings Bagel or Thread) with figurines inside it. Whoever gets a figurine is supposed to organize and be the host of the family celebration for the &quot;Candelaria&quot; feast on February 2.

In France and Belgium, a cake containing a small figure of the baby Jesus, known as the &quot;broad bean&quot;, is shared within the family. Whoever gets the bean is crowned king for the remainder of the holiday and wears a cardboard crown purchased with the cake. A similar practice is common in many areas of Switzerland, but the figurine is a miniature king. The practice is known as (Drawing the Kings). A queen is sometimes also chosen.

In New Orleans, Louisiana, parts of southern Texas, and surrounding regions, a similar ring-shaped cake known as a &quot;King Cake&quot; traditionally becomes available in bakeries from Epiphany to Mardi Gras. The baby Jesus figurine is inserted into the cake from underneath, and the person who gets the slice with the figurine is expected to buy or bake the next King Cake. There is wide variation among the types of pastry that may be called a King Cake, but most are a baked cinnamon-flavoured twisted dough with thin frosting and additional sugar on top in the traditional Mardi Gras colours of gold, green and purple. To prevent accidental injury or choking, the baby Jesus figurine is frequently not inserted into the cake at the bakery, but included in the packaging for optional use by the buyer to insert it themselves. Mardi Gras-style beads and doubloons may be included as well.

=== Martyrdom traditions ===
Christian scriptures record nothing about the biblical Magi after reporting that they returned to their own country. The Chronicon of Dexter, a martyrological text ascribed to Flavius Lucius Dexter, the bishop of Barcelona under Theodosius the Great (379–396) describes &quot;the martyrdom of the holy kings, the three Magi, Gaspar, Balthassar, and Melchior who adored Christ.&quot; in &quot;Arabia Felix, in the city of Sessania of the Adrumeti&quot;. First appearing in 1610, the Chronicon of Dexter was immensely popular throughout the 17th century, particularly in Spain. However, by the 19th century, certain historians and Catholic officials in Rome declared the work a pious forgery.

Another competing tradition, most likely originating from Germany, likewise asserts that the biblical Magi were martyred for their faith, albeit without further details.

=== Tombs ===
There are several traditions on where the remains of the Magi are located, none of which have been verified or given veracity by secular historians.

Marco Polo claimed that he was shown the three tombs of the Magi at Saveh, south of Tehran in present day Iran, in the 1270s:

Paul William Roberts provides some modern-day corroboration of this possibility in his book &quot;Journey of the Magi&quot;.

The bones of the Magi are allegedly contained at the Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral in Germany. According to tradition, they were first discovered by Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, on her famous pilgrimage to Palestine and the Holy Lands in 326–28. She took the remains to the church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople; in 344, they were transferred to Milan—in some accounts by the city&#x27;s bishop, Eustorgius I—where they were interred in a special tomb beneath its basilica. In 1162, following the conquest of the city by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I, the Magi&#x27;s remains were transferred to Cologne Cathedral at the behest of its archbishop, Rainald von Dassel. In response to growing pilgrimages to the relics, von Dassel&#x27;s successor, Philipp von Hochstaden, commissioned the current Shrine of the Three Kings in the late 12th century, which remains widely visited and venerated. The Milanese treated the fragments of masonry from their now-empty tomb as secondary relics, which were widely distributed around the region, including southern France; this accounts for the frequency with which the Magi appear on chasse reliquaries in Limoges enamel produced in the region. The city continues to celebrate its part in the tradition by holding a medieval costume parade every 6 January.

A version of this account is conveyed by 14th century cleric John of Hildesheim in &quot;Historia Trium Regum&quot; (&quot;History of the Three Kings&quot;), which begins with the journey of Helena to Jerusalem, where she recovered the True Cross and other relics:

Queen Helen... began to think greatly of the bodies of these three kings, and she arrayed herself, and accompanied by many attendants, went into the Land of Ind... after she had found the bodies of Melchior, Balthazar, and Gaspar, Queen Helen put them into one chest and ornamented it with great riches, and she brought them into Constantinople... and laid them in a church that is called Saint Sophia.

==Cultural depictions==
=== Visual art ===
Most depictions of the Magi in European art focus on their visit to Jesus. Also depicted, if less often, were the Journey of the Magi, the Magi before Herod, and the Dream of the Magi. In Byzantine art they are depicted as Persians, wearing trousers and phrygian caps. Crowns appear from the 10th century. Despite being saints, they are very often shown without halos, perhaps to avoid distracting attention from either their crowns or the halos of the Holy Family. Sometimes only the lead king, kneeling to Christ, has a halo the two others lack, probably indicating that the two behind had not yet performed the act of worship that would ensure their status as saints. Medieval artists also allegorised the theme to represent the three ages of man. Beginning in the 12th century, and very often by the 15th, the Kings also represent the three parts of the known (pre-Columbian) world in Western art, especially in Northern Europe. Balthasar is thus represented as a young African or Moor, and Caspar may be depicted with distinctly Oriental features.

An early Anglo-Saxon depiction survives on the Franks Casket (early 7th century, whalebone carving), the only Christian scene, which is combined with pagan and classical imagery. In its composition it follows the oriental style, which renders a courtly scene, with the Virgin and Christ facing the spectator, while the Magi devoutly approach from the (left) side. Even amongst non-Christians who had heard of the Christian story of the Magi, the motif was quite popular, since the Magi had endured a long journey and were generous. Instead of an angel, the picture places a swan-like bird, perhaps interpretable as the hero&#x27;s fylgja (a protecting spirit, and shapeshifter).

Austrian artist Gottfried Helnwein depicted a more controversial tableau in his painting, &quot;Epiphany I: Adoration of the Magi&quot; (1996). Intended to represent the &quot;many connections between the Third Reich and the Christian churches in Austria and Germany&quot;, Nazi officers in uniform stand around an Aryan Madonna. The Christ toddler who stands on Mary&#x27;s lap resembles Adolf Hitler.

More generally they appear in popular Nativity scenes and other Christmas decorations that have their origins in the Neapolitan variety of the Italian or Nativity crèche.

Some Christmas carols refer to the biblical Magi or Three Kings, especially hymns meant to be sung by the star singers, such as &quot;Stern über Bethlehem&quot;. Peter Cornelius composed a song cycle, &quot;Weihnachtslieder&quot;, Op. 8, which contain the song &quot;Die Könige&quot; (The Kings), which became popular in an English choral arrangement, &quot;The Three Kings&quot;. Balthazar, Caspar, and Melchior are also featured in Gian Carlo Menotti&#x27;s 1951 opera &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot;. The popular carol &quot;We Three Kings&quot; is another example. Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Cantata #65 &quot;Sie werden aus Saba alle kommen&quot; (&quot;All they from Saba shall come&quot;) also tells about the Wise Men, based on the Old Testament prophesy found in Isaiah 60:6 (&quot;A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come. They shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall proclaim the praise of the Lord.&quot;)

=== Cinema ===
Numerous films have included these characters in some scenes depicting the Nativity, from The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ (1897) to &quot;The Star&quot; (2017). In 2003, the Spanish animated film &quot;The 3 Wise Men&quot; was released, directed by Antonio Navarro and nominated for the Goya Awards.

=== Literature ===

* Henry van Dyke&#x27;s 1895 novella &quot;The Other Wise Man&quot; tells the story of Artaban, a fourth magus whose mission of kindness delays his arrival in Bethlehem by one day, missing Jesus and His parents who by then had fled to Egypt. The rest of the plot revolves around Artaban traveling the world throughout Jesus&#x27; 33 years on Earth and of the protagonist&#x27;s multiple attempts to pay homage to the Son of God.
* The first part of Lewis Wallace&#x27;s 1880 novel &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; tells the story of the birth of Christ from Balthasar&#x27;s point of view. Here Balthasar comes from Egypt and is joined by Melchior, a Hindu, and Gaspar, a Greek. Balthasar remains a recurring character throughout the novel.
* O. Henry&#x27;s 1905 short story &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot; tells of an impoverished couple named Jim and Della Dillingham Young sacrificing their prized possessions to buy each other Christmas gifts. Della sells her long brown hair to buy a platinum fob chain to go with Jim&#x27;s pocket watch, only to learn that he had sold it to buy ornamental combs for her hair. In addition to the eponymous magi, the text also mentions the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon. The narrator ends the story by claiming that (in comparison between the biblical figures&#x27; wealth with the Dillingham Youngs&#x27; possessions) those who sacrifice the things they value for the people they love are as wise as the magi themselves.
* T.S. Eliot&#x27;s 1927 poem &quot;Journey of the Magi&quot; is told from an aged king&#x27;s point of view.

<text>Cradle of Filth are an English extreme metal band formed in Suffolk in 1991. The band&#x27;s musical style evolved originally from black metal to a cleaner and more &quot;produced&quot; amalgam of gothic metal, symphonic metal and other metal genres. Their lyrical themes and imagery are heavily influenced by Gothic literature, poetry, mythology and horror films. The band consists of its founding member, vocalist Dani Filth, drummer Martin &quot;Marthus&quot; Škaroupka, bassist Daniel Firth, guitarists Marek &quot;Ashok&quot; Šmerda and Donny Burbage, and keyboardist Zoe Marie Federoff.

The band has broken free from its original niche by courting mainstream publicity. This increased accessibility has brought coverage from the likes of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and MTV, along with frequent main stage appearances at major festivals such as Ozzfest, Download and even the mainstream Sziget Festival. They have sometimes been perceived as Satanic by casual observers, even though their lyrical references to Satanism are few and far between; their use of Satanic imagery has arguably always been more for shock value than any seriously held beliefs.

==History==
=== Early years (1991–1996) ===

Cradle of Filth&#x27;s first three years saw three demos (&quot;Invoking the Unclean&quot;, &quot;Orgiastic Pleasures Foul&quot; and &quot;Total Fucking Darkness&quot;) recorded amidst the sort of rapid line-up fluctuations that have continued ever since, with the band having more than thirty musicians in its history. An album entitled &quot;Goetia&quot; was recorded prior to the third demo and set for release on Tombstone Records, but all tracks were wiped when Tombstone went out of business and the band could not afford to buy the recordings from the studio. The band eventually signed to Cacophonous Records, and their debut album, &quot;The Principle of Evil Made Flesh&quot;, was Cacophonous&#x27;s first release in 1994. A step-up in terms of production from the rehearsal quality of most of their demos, the album was still nevertheless a sparse and embryonic version of what was to come, with lead singer Dani Filth&#x27;s vocals in particular bearing little similarity to the style he was later to develop. The album was well-received however, and as recently as June 2006 found its way into &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;&#x27;s list of the top ten black metal albums of the last twenty years.

Cradle&#x27;s relationship with Cacophonous soon soured, the band accusing the label of contractual and financial mismanagement. Acrimonious legal proceedings took up most of 1995, and the original version of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Dusk... and Her Embrace&quot; was recorded by the &quot;Principle...&quot; lineup for Cacophonous but scrapped. Subsequently re-worked with new band members for Music For Nations (see below), the embryonic Cacophonous version was eventually released as &quot;Dusk... and Her Embrace: The Original Sin&quot; in July 2016.

The band finally signed to Music for Nations in 1996 after only one more contractually obligated Cacophonous recording: the EP &quot;V Empire or Dark Faerytales in Phallustein&quot;, which, it has since been conceded, was hastily written as a Cacophonous escape-plan. Despite the circumstances of its release however, its handful of tracks are staples of the band&#x27;s live sets to this day, and &quot;Queen of Winter, Throned&quot; was listed among twenty-five &quot;essential extreme metal anthems&quot; in a 2006 issue of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine. The EP also marked Sarah Jezebel Deva&#x27;s debut with the band, replacing Andrea Meyer, Cradle&#x27;s first female vocalist and self-styled &quot;satanic advisor&quot;. Deva appeared on every subsequent Cradle release and tour until 2010&#x27;s &quot;Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa&quot;, but was never considered a full band member, since she also performed with The Kovenant, Therion and Mortiis, and fronted her own Angtoria project along with Cradle&#x27;s former bass guitar player, Dave Pybus.

The re-worked and re-recorded &quot;Dusk... and Her Embrace&quot; followed the same year: a critically acclaimed breakthrough album that greatly expanded the band&#x27;s fan-base throughout Europe and the rest of the world. Cradle&#x27;s inaugural album for Music for Nations set the tone for what was to follow. The album&#x27;s production values matched the band&#x27;s ambition for the first time, whilst Filth&#x27;s vocal gymnastics were at their most extreme.
The increasingly theatrical stage shows of the 1997 European tour helped keep Cradle in the public eye, as did a burgeoning line of controversial merchandise, not least the notorious T-shirt depicting a masturbating nun on the front and the slogan &quot;Jesus is a cunt&quot; in large letters on the back. The T-shirt is banned in New Zealand, a handful of fans have faced court appearances and fines for wearing the shirt in public, and some band members themselves attracted a certain amount of hostile attention when they wore similar &quot;I Love Satan&quot; shirts to the Vatican. Alex Mosson, the Lord Provost of Glasgow from 1999 to 2003, called the shirts (and by implication the band) &quot;sick and offensive&quot;. The band used the quote on the back cover of the 2005 DVD &quot;Peace Through Superior Firepower&quot;.

In 1998, Filth began his long-running &quot;Dani&#x27;s Inferno&quot; column for &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;, and the band appeared in the BBC documentary series &quot;Living with the Enemy&quot; (on tour with a fan and his disapproving mother and sister) and released its third studio album, &quot;Cruelty and the Beast&quot;. A fully realised concept album based on the legend of the &quot;Blood Countess&quot; Elizabeth Báthory, the album boasted the casting coup of Ingrid Pitt providing guest narration as the Countess; a role she first played in Hammer Film Productions&#x27; 1971 film &quot;Countess Dracula&quot;. The album led to Cradle&#x27;s US debut, and Dani claimed it in 2003 as the Cradle album of which he was most proud, although he conceded dissatisfaction with its sound quality.

The following year the band continued primarily to tour, but did release the EP &quot;From the Cradle to Enslave&quot;, accompanied by the band&#x27;s first music video, which formed the centrepiece of the DVD &quot;PanDaemonAeon&quot;. Replete with graphic nudity and gore, the video was directed by Alex Chandon, who would go on to produce further Cradle promo clips and DVD documentaries, as well as the full-length feature film &quot;Cradle of Fear&quot;.

The band released their fourth studio album in the Autumn of 2000. &quot;Midian&quot; was based around the Clive Barker novel &quot;Cabal&quot; and its subsequent film adaptation &quot;Nightbreed&quot;. Like &quot;Cruelty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Midian&quot; featured a guest narrator, this time Doug Bradley, who starred in &quot;Nightbreed&quot; but remains best known for playing Pinhead in the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; series. Bradley&#x27;s line &quot;Oh, no tears please&quot; from the song &quot;Her Ghost in the Fog&quot; is a quote of Pinhead&#x27;s from the first &quot;Hellraiser&quot; (&quot;No tears, please. It&#x27;s a waste of good suffering...&quot;), and Bradley would reappear on later albums &quot;Nymphetamine&quot;, &quot;Thornography&quot; and &quot;Godspeed on the Devil&#x27;s Thunder&quot;. The video for &quot;Her Ghost in the Fog&quot; received heavy rotation on MTV2 and other metal channels, and the track also found its way onto the soundtrack of the werewolf movie &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot; (it would also feature, much later, in the video game &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;).

=== Sony interlude (2001–2004) ===
The longest-ever interim period between full-length Cradle albums was nevertheless a busy time for the band. &quot;Bitter Suites to Succubi&quot; was released on the band&#x27;s own Abracadaver label, and was a mixture of four new songs, re-recordings of three songs from &quot;The Principle of Evil Made Flesh&quot;, two instrumental tracks and a cover of The Sisters of Mercy&#x27;s &quot;No Time to Cry&quot;. Stylistically similar to &quot;Midian&quot;, the collection was, at the time, unique among Cradle releases in that it featured exactly the same band members as its predecessor. Further stop-gap releases followed in the form of the &quot;best of&quot; package &quot;Lovecraft &amp; Witch Hearts&quot; and the live album, &quot;Live Bait for the Dead&quot;. Finally, the band (principally Dani) also found time to appear in the horror film &quot;Cradle of Fear&quot; while they negotiated their first major-label signing with Sony Music.

&quot;Damnation and a Day&quot; arrived in 2003; Sony&#x27;s heavyweight funding underwriting Cradle&#x27;s undiminished ambition by finally bringing a real orchestra into the studio (the 101 piece Budapest Film Orchestra including the 40 piece Choir replacing the increasingly sophisticated synthesisers of previous albums) and thus marking the band&#x27;s belated gestation—for one album only—into full-blown symphonic metal. &quot;Damnation&quot; featured the band&#x27;s most complex compositions to date, outran its predecessors by a good twenty minutes and produced two more popular videos: the Jan Švankmajer-influenced &quot;Mannequin&quot; and &quot;Babalon A.D. (So Glad for the Madness)&quot;, based on Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s film &quot;Salò&quot;. Roughly half the album trod the conceptual territory of John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;—showing the events of the fall of man through the eyes of Lucifer—while the remainder comprised stand-alone tracks such as the Nile tribute &quot;Doberman Pharaoh&quot; and the aforementioned &quot;Babalon A. D.&quot;; a reference to Aleister Crowley. &quot;Babalon A. D.&quot; was the first DVD-only single to reach the UK&#x27;s top 40 charts, according to the &quot;Guinness Book of Records of British Hit Singles and Albums&quot;. Feeling that Sony&#x27;s enthusiasm quickly palled however, Cradle jumped ship to Roadrunner Records after barely a year.

=== Move to Roadrunner (2004–2010) ===

2004&#x27;s &quot;Nymphetamine&quot; was the band&#x27;s first full album since &quot;Dusk...and Her Embrace&quot; to not be based around any sort of overarching concept (although references to the works of H. P. Lovecraft are made more than once). Cradle&#x27;s bass guitarist Dave Pybus described it as an &quot;eclectic mix between the group&#x27;s &quot;Damnation&quot; and &quot;Cruelty&quot; albums with a renewed vigour for melody, songmanship and plain fucking weirdness.&quot; &quot;Nymphetamine&quot; debuted at No. 89 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, selling just under 14,000 copies, and the band&#x27;s growing acceptance by the mainstream was confirmed when the album&#x27;s title track was nominated for a Grammy award. The album&#x27;s track &quot;Coffin Fodder&quot; was referenced in an episode of the Channel 4 sit-com &quot;The IT Crowd&quot; in February 2006.

&quot;Thornography&quot; was released in October 2006. According to Dani Filth, the title &quot;represents mankind&#x27;s obsession with sin and self... an addiction to self-punishment or something equally poisonous... a mania.&quot; On the subject of the album&#x27;s musical direction, Filth told &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine, &quot;I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s &#x27;experimental&#x27;, but we&#x27;re definitely testing the limits of what we can do... A lot of the songs are really rhythmical—thrashy, almost—but they&#x27;re all also really catchy.&quot; A flurry of pre-release controversy saw Samuel Araya&#x27;s original cover artwork scrapped and replaced in May 2006, although numerous CD booklets had already been printed with the original image. &quot;Thornography&quot; received a similar reception to &quot;Nymphetamine&quot;, garnering generally positive reviews, but raising a few eyebrows with the inclusion of a cover of Heaven 17&#x27;s &quot;Temptation&quot; (featuring guest vocals from Dirty Harry), which was released as a digital single and accompanying video shortly before the album. &quot;Thornography&quot; entered the Billboard chart at No. 66, having sold nearly 13,000 copies.

Long-term drummer Adrian Erlandsson departed the band in November 2006, with the intention of devoting his energies to his two side projects, Needleye and Nemhain. The official press release from Roadrunner saw Erlandsson state &quot;I have enjoyed my time with Cradle but it is now time to move on. I feel I am going out on a high as &quot;Thornography&quot; is definitely our best album to date&quot;. He was replaced by Martin &quot;Marthus&quot; Škaroupka.

Work on the eighth studio album, released in October 2008 as &quot;Godspeed on the Devil&#x27;s Thunder&quot;, began early that year following a GWAR-supported tour which took place in Russia, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Romania, Slovakia and North America. &quot;Godspeed&quot; is a concept album based around the legend of Gilles de Rais, a 15th-century French nobleman who fought alongside Joan of Arc and accumulated great wealth before becoming an occultist, sexual deviant and murderer. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; preferred the album to the &quot;relatively weak&quot; &quot;Thornography&quot;, calling it &quot;grandiose and epic&quot;, while &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; said it had &quot;genuine narrative depth and emotional resonance&quot;, and &quot;Terrorizer&quot; called it &quot;cohesive, consistent and convincing&quot;. It sold 11,000 copies in its week of release, entering the Billboard 200 at No. 48.

=== Peaceville Records (2010–2014) ===
Cradle&#x27;s relationship with Roadrunner came to an end in April 2010, with the announcement that the band&#x27;s next album would be released by the British independent label Peaceville Records, using Cradle&#x27;s own Abracadaver imprint. Dani Filth cited &quot;the artistic restrictions and mindless inhibitions imposed by a major label&quot; as the band&#x27;s reason for going independent. Early press releases named the new album &quot;All Hallows Eve&quot;, but by August 2010 the title was confirmed as &quot;Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa&quot;. Released on 1 November 2010, it is a concept album in the same vein as its predecessor, &quot;Godspeed on the Devil&#x27;s Thunder&quot;; this time centring on the demon Lilith, the first wife of the biblical Adam, and also making reference to Greek, Egyptian and Sumerian mythology, the Knights Templar and the Carmelite Nuns. The label referred to it as &quot;a dark tapestry of horror, madness and twisted sex&quot;, while Filth called its sound &quot;creepily melodic, like Mercyful Fate or a dark Iron Maiden&quot;. &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;&#x27;s Dom Lawson felt it was &quot;another sumptuous and spectacular eruption of gothic melodrama, perverted sonic schlock and balls-out extreme metal bombast&quot;, and likened it to an &quot;instalment in an ongoing series of novels.&quot;

An EP entitled &quot;Evermore Darkly&quot;, featuring &quot;new tracks and rarities&quot;, was released in October 2011. The package included a DVD with a tour documentary, a live DVD recorded at 2011&#x27;s Graspop festival and the video for &quot;Lilith Immaculate&quot;.

In April 2012, the compilation album &quot;Midnight in the Labyrinth&quot; was released, featuring orchestral re-recordings of songs from the band&#x27;s first three albums and the &quot;V Empire&quot; EP. Dani Filth had described it in the preceding months as &quot;reinventing&quot; the tracks as &quot;full soundtrack quality stuff... with choirs, strings and some narration&quot;. This album&#x27;s version of &quot;Summer Dying Fast&quot; was included on &quot;Evermore Darkly&quot; as a teaser for the full release (the &quot;Evermore&quot; track listing subtitles this version &quot;&quot;Midnight in the Labyrinth&quot; breadcrumb trail&quot;), and &quot;A Gothic Romance (Red Roses for the Devil&#x27;s Whore)&quot; was released online via Peaceville&#x27;s website on 4 April. Sarah Jezebel Deva returned to provide female vocals for &quot;Midnight in the Labyrinth&quot;; her first work with Cradle since her departure in 2008.

In July 2012, the band re-issued its back catalogue from 1994 to 2002, via The End Records.

Cradle&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;The Manticore and Other Horrors&quot;, was released on 29 October 2012 in Europe, and on 30 October in North America. Paul Allender told Ultimate Guitar that &quot;The last thing we want to do is come out with another album that sounds like the last two. We decided to change direction and go back to what we used to do with the female vocals; all the strong melody lines and harmonies... I&#x27;ve put a lot of punk-orientated riffs back into it again. It&#x27;s really gone quite dark and pretty hardcore.&quot;

On 2 September 2013, via his monthly blog, Dani Filth announced the crowd-funded Cradle of Filth comic book, &quot;The Curse of Venus Aversa&quot;, and &quot;a career spanning double-disc &#x27;best of&#x27;&quot; compilation that is yet to be named.

In March 2014, Cradle of Filth announced the first ever commercial release of their 1993 demo &quot;Total Fucking Darkness&quot;. The album arrived on CD and limited edition vinyl the following May, on the independent Mordgrimm label. It features all the tracks from the original cassette, plus previously unreleased rehearsal recordings and the sole surviving track from their abandoned &quot;Goetia&quot; album.

=== Nuclear Blast Records (2014–2022) ===

In April 2014, Paul Allender stated on his official Facebook account that he had once again left Cradle of Filth, in favour of his new band White Empress. Dani Filth stated about Allender departing the band: &quot;Paul has been enthralled [&quot;sic&quot;] in his own project and he could not do the tour due to personal reasons. Since then the band has grown as a unit, we were only writing as one guitarist for the last three records and we now have two very competent guitarists. Paul had a very strong opinion about doing that [writing single guitar parts], and we&#x27;re a two-guitar band. So that may be one of the things that kind of opened the fissure a bit.&quot;
James McIlroy also left the band at around this point due to imminent surgery for a spinal injury. Both guitarists were replaced for upcoming tours by Marek &quot;Ashok&quot; Šmerda of the Czech groups Root and Inner Fear, and Richard Shaw of English acts Emperor Chung and NG26.

On 2 April 2014, Cradle of Filth&#x27;s website announced that they were working on their follow-up to &quot;The Manticore and Other Horrors&quot;. Dani Filth announced that they expected a Spring 2015 release and that three songs had already been written.

On 11 November 2014 it was reported on the official Cradle of Filth Facebook page that they had signed to Nuclear Blast Records for their new album and were expected to begin recording the follow-up to &quot;The Manticore And Other Horrors&quot; later the same month. In early 2015, the working title of the album was revealed as &quot;Hammer of the Witches&quot; (inspired by the 1486 treatise on the prosecution of witches by Heinrich Kramer). This title was eventually confirmed as official. The album was recorded at Grindstone Studios in Suffolk, England, with a tentative initial release date of 26 June. Over 21 and 22 March the band filmed scenes for a promo video for the song &quot;Right Wing of the Garden Triptych&quot;. The shoot was in the hangar and fire station of former U.S. military base of Bentwaters, with additional narrative scenes (featuring actresses in a bondage setting) filmed on a farmstead near the Imperial War Museum Duxford. The video was directed by Sam Scott-Hunter.

On 21 April 2015, the album&#x27;s release date was updated to sometime in July, and the band revealed &quot;Hammer of the Witches&quot;″ cover artwork by the Latvian post-modernist artist Arthur Berzinsh. The album was officially released through Nuclear Blast on 10 July 2015. The subsequent world tour included the band&#x27;s largest set of UK dates for eight years in late 2015, and a set of North American shows in early 2016.
On 16 June 2017 the title of their twelfth studio album was revealed as &quot;Cryptoriana – The Seductiveness of Decay&quot; and it was given an official release date of 22 September 2017 through Nuclear Blast Records.

On 10 February 2020, it was announced on the band&#x27;s social media that keyboardist and vocalist Lindsay Schoolcraft had departed from the band, citing mental health reasons, as well as giving the band room to progress. In the post the band announced that a replacement had been found, but did not immediately disclose their identity. Anabelle Iratni was later announced as the new keyboard player for the band in May 2021.

The band&#x27;s thirteenth album, &quot;Existence Is Futile&quot;, was released on 22 October 2021. A music video was released for the single &quot;Crawling King Chaos&quot; in advance of the album on 30 July 2021. On 4 May 2022, Dani Filth announced the departure of guitarist Richard Shaw and keyboardist Anabelle. Filth stated, &quot;We have to respect that people have personal commitments and/or sometimes find the career choice of being in a band like Cradle of Filth a tad overwhelming&quot;. At the same time, Donny Burbage joined as the new guitarist with Zoe Marie Federoff as the new keyboard player.

=== Napalm Records (2022–present) ===
On 9 May 2022, the band announced that they had signed to Napalm Records.

Vocalist Dani Filth mentioned in August 2022 that the band had been working on a collaboration with musician Ed Sheeran since the previous year. Filth explained that Sheeran had begun recording his vocals for the collaboration, but that Sheeran&#x27;s touring schedule and the birth of his child caused delays. Sheeran&#x27;s interest in a collaboration with Cradle of Filth stems from listening to metal bands like Cradle and Slipknot during his childhood.

In 2023, a music video was released for &quot;She is a Fire&quot;. The song is one of two studio tracks from the &quot;Existence is Futile&quot; recording sessions to be included on the live album &quot;Trouble and Their Double Lives&quot;, along with live tracks recorded during the band&#x27;s &quot;Cryptoriana World Tour&quot;. &quot;Trouble and Their Double Lives&quot; was released on 28 April 2023. Shortly after the release of the live album, the band entered the studio to begin recording their upcoming fourteenth studio album, which was mixed and mastered in July 2024 and scheduled to be released in March 2025. The studio album&#x27;s title, &quot;The Screaming of the Valkyries&quot;, was revealed on 8 January 2025, and is set to be released on 21 March 2025.

==Musical style and influences==
Though generally classified as an extreme metal band, Cradle of Filth&#x27;s musical style has been described as symphonic metal, symphonic black metal, gothic metal, symphonic death metal, gothic black metal, dark metal, and symphonic gothic metal. Though the band emerged with a style that leaned heavily toward black metal, they have since distanced themselves from the genre. Additionally, some tracks in their first album are considered to be akin to death metal and thrash metal.

Despite these classifications, Cradle of Filth&#x27;s particular genre has provoked a great deal of discussion, and their status as a black metal band or otherwise has been in debate since near the time that the group rose to fame. The band have cited acts that were heavily influential to black metal such as Bathory, Celtic Frost and Mercyful Fate among their influences, but Dani Filth, in a 1998 interview for BBC Radio 5 for example, said &quot;I use the term &#x27;heavy metal&#x27;, rather than &#x27;black metal&#x27;, because I think that&#x27;s a bit of a fad now. Call it what you like: death metal, black metal, any kind of metal...&quot;. Gavin Baddeley&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Terrorizer&quot; interview states that &quot;few folk, the band included, call Cradle black metal these days.&quot; In a 2006 interview with &quot;Terrorizer&quot;, then-guitarist Paul Allender said, &quot;We were never a black metal band. The only thing that catered to that was the make-up. Even when &quot;The Principle of Evil Made Flesh&quot; came out—you look at Emperor and Burzum and all that stuff—we didn&#x27;t sound anything like that. The way that I see it is that we were, and still are now, an extreme metal band.&quot;

However, the band&#x27;s evolving sound has allowed them to continue resisting definitive categorisation. They have collaborated on projects such as Christian Death&#x27;s &quot;Born Again Anti-Christian&quot; album (on the track &quot;Peek-a-Boo&quot;) and have even experimented outside of metal music with dance remixes – such as &quot;Twisting Further Nails&quot;, &quot;Pervert&#x27;s Church&quot; and &quot;Forgive Me Father (I&#x27;m in a Trance)&quot;.

Appearing on the BBC music quiz &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; on 9 April 2001, Filth jokingly described Cradle&#x27;s sound as &quot;heavy funk&quot;, and in an October 2006 interview stated, &quot;we&#x27;d rather be known as solely &#x27;Cradle of Filth&#x27;, I think, than be hampered by stupid genre barriers.&quot;

<text>Christopher Andersen Hornsrud (15 November 1859 – 12 December 1960) was a Norwegian politician for the Labour Party. He served as leader of the Labour Party from 1903 to 1906 and became a member of the Storting in 1912. In 1928, he became the first Norwegian prime minister from the Labour Party and served as the 18th prime minister of Norway, but the cabinet had a weak parliamentary basis and was only in office for three weeks from January to February. He combined the post of prime minister with that of minister of Finance. After resigning he became vice-president of the Storting, a position he held until 1934.

Hornsrud was born in Skotselv, Øvre Eiker, and died in Oslo.

== Early life ==
Hornsrud was born in 1859 to Gunhild Dorthea and Anders Christophersen at the Horsrud farm in Skotselv, Eastern Norway, which had belonged his father&#x27;s family in generations. His mother was originally from Åmot farm in Modum and after the death of his father when he was about six months old, Horsrud lived with his mother&#x27;s family in Åmot until he was five years old and moved back to his mother in Skotselv. He had one older brother, Johan, which as &quot;odelsgutt&quot; was destined to take over the farm in Skotselv He attended a local school where the schedule was two weeks with education and two weeks off. Otherwise, he helped with the farm. While his home only had religious literature, a local library in Hokksund provided him with a wider set of books and also the weekly magazine &quot;Skilling-Magazin&quot;.

After confirmation, he stayed to work at the family farm while his elder brother studied at Jønsberg Agricultural School. In 1875, he got a position as assistant in a general store in Hønefoss, a town with about 1,100 inhabitants at that time. When the store owner died in 1878, Hornsrud together with another person bought the store.

== Political activities for the Liberal Party ==

Working in the shop brought him in contact with a wide array of local townspeople and farmers from neighboring areas and with the political discussion of the time. He became involved in the local Liberal association which was visited by known Liberal figures like Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Viggo Ullmann and Erik Vullum.

He was one of the founders of Buskerud Amts Venstreforening (Buskerud County&#x27;s Liberal Society) in 1880.

In 1884, he moved to Vikersund where he was the manager and later owner of a store. There he continued his political involvement and was a member of Modum municipal council from 1883 to 1892. In 1891, he bought Åmot farm, the family farm of his mother&#x27;s family. Among the issues he focused on was care for the elderly and he took initiative to remove the system where the elderly were placed among private persons for a fee and improved the local nursing home.

Together with others, he organized local Worker Societies (&quot;arbeiderforeniger&quot;) and in 1884, these formed Buskerud Amts Arbeiderforening (Buskerud County&#x27;s Worker Society). The program of the latter included universal suffrage, no tariff for basic goods, progressive taxation and better primary education. The Worker Societies were associated with the Liberal Party, but the national worker meetings that were held also included participation of socialists like Carl Jeppesen and Christian Holtermann Knudsen. Hornsrud attended the national worker meetings in 1891 and 1892.

== Labour Party and national politics ==
In the 1890s, Hornsrud started considering himself a socialist and he attended the Labour Party&#x27;s congresses from 1893 to 1896. He combined this for a while with continued membership in the Liberal Party. In 1901, he was elected member of the Labour party&#x27;s committee on agricultural land.

To his own and many other&#x27;s surprise, he was elected leader of the Labour Party in 1903. Horsrud represented a fraction of the party that was open to some co-operation with other parties, in particular the Liberal Party. His opponent, the incumbent Holtemann Knudsen, represented a more isolationist stance.

At the party congress in 1906, the party swung back to the isolationist stance and the congress passed a resolution saying that the party should never engage in electoral alliances with other parties. Hornsrud was not a candidate for a new period as leader, and was replaced by Oscar Nissen. He had become partly disillusioned with political work due to internal strifes and accusations that he was a &quot;minister socialist&quot; with too much sympathy for the Liberal party and seeking too much power in this own hands. He did not attend any more party congresses for a long time.

When Torgeir Vraa was elected to the Storting in 1905, Horsrud became interim editor of the Labour Party newspaper &quot;Fremtiden&quot; in Drammen. In 1909, he moved back to Modum where he once again became involved in local politics and served one year as mayor.

He also candidated for the Labour Party in the Parliamentary election in 1909, but was not elected for a seat. In the Parliamentary election in 1912 he did however succeed and aged 54, he entered the Storting as a member in 1913. He held the seat until 1936.

His main focus in the parliament was agriculture, particularly issues relating to the ownership of agricultural land and finances.

During World War I he was a member of the Supplies Commission (&quot;provianteringskommisjonen&quot;); being the first representative from the Labour Party to serve as a member of a public commission. He co-operated well with the Liberal leader and Prime Minister Gunnar Knudsen.

== Prime Minister and later parliamentary career ==
The 1927 parliamentary election was a victory for the Labour Party which won 59 of the 150 seats and became the parliament&#x27;s largest group. The Conservative Prime Minister Ivar Lykke resigned on 20January 1928. He recommended that the King ask the leader of the Centre Party, Johan Mellbye, to form a new cabinet. When Mellbye&#x27;s attempt failed, the King called the Storting&#x27;s president Carl Joachim Hambro and vice-president Hornsrud for consultation on 23January. During the meeting with the King, Hornsrud expressed his view that it would be constitutionally most correct to ask the Labour Party as the largest party to form a cabinet, though he did not know whether the Labour Party would be able to form a cabinet.

On the advice of Hornsrud, the King contacted the leader of the Labour Party parliamentary group, Alfred Madsen. When Madsen subsequently asked the group whether the party should accept to form a cabinet, Hornsrud was among those who advocated strongest for a positive response. Others were more reluctant or negative. The central committee of the party decided that the party should take government responsibilities, but their first choice for Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold declined the offer to become prime minister. Hornsrud was then given the task. Hornsrud&#x27;s Cabinet was appointed by the King on 28January, making Hornsrud the first prime minister ever from the Labour Party. He took the position as Minister of Finance in addition to prime minister.

The cabinet was a minority cabinet with a weak parliamentary position. Its governing declaration (&quot;regjerinserklæring&quot;) which started by saying that the ultimate goal of the Labour Party was to create a socialist system in Norway was met with strong criticism from the other parties. The Labour cabinet also caused concern in the financial industry which was already struggling. Bergens Privatbank was one of the banks which was striving to survive. Governor of the Central Bank of Norway Nicolai Rygg requested that the government should pay for a guarantee fund for the banks and when Hornsrud declined, Rygg petitioned the leader of the Liberal Party Johan Ludwig Mowinckel and other non-socialist party leaders to cause the downfall of the Hornsrud cabinet. On 7February, Mowinckel presented a motion of no confidence in the Storting. The next day the motion was approved with 86 votes against 63. Except for the members of the Labour Party only the three members of the Communist Party and one from the Radical People&#x27;s Party voted against the motion. The government resigned on 15February 1928.

In 1928, Hornsrud was elected vice-president of the Storting, a position he held until 1934.
Hornsrud became a parliament appointed member of the chair (&quot;direksjonen&quot;) for Norges Hypotekbank in 1926, a bank which was designated to provide cheap loans to the agricultural sector. From 1936 to 1939, he served as chairman of the bank.

== Later life and death ==
After World War II Hornsrud continued to be involved in political debate. He was a strong opponent of militarism and Norwegian membership in NATO. He was one of the founders of the radical newspaper &quot;Orientering&quot; and participated in the choice of name for it.

Having died aged 101 years, Hornsrud is the longest living Norwegian Prime Minister ever.

<doc id="209074" wikidata="Q1609529" url="?curid=209074" title="Mizar system">
<text>The Mizar system consists of a formal language for writing mathematical definitions and proofs, a proof assistant, which is able to mechanically check proofs written in this language, and a library of formalized mathematics, which can be used in the proof of new theorems. The system is maintained and developed by the Mizar Project, formerly under the direction of its founder Andrzej Trybulec.

In 2009 the Mizar Mathematical Library was the largest coherent body of strictly formalized mathematics in existence.

== History ==

The Mizar Project was started around 1973 by Andrzej Trybulec as an attempt to reconstruct mathematical vernacular so it can be checked by a computer. Its current goal, apart from the continual development of the Mizar System, is the collaborative creation of a large library of formally verified proofs, covering most of the core of modern mathematics. This is in line with the influential QED manifesto.

Currently the project is developed and maintained by research groups at Białystok University, Poland, the University of Alberta, Canada, and Shinshu University, Japan. While the Mizar proof checker remains proprietary, the Mizar Mathematical Library—the sizable body of formalized mathematics that it verified—is licensed open-source.

Papers related to the Mizar system regularly appear in the peer-reviewed journals of the mathematic formalization academic community. These include &quot;Studies in Logic, Grammar and Rhetoric&quot;, &quot;Intelligent Computer Mathematics&quot;, &quot;Interactive Theorem Proving&quot;, &quot;Journal of Automated Reasoning&quot; and the &quot;Journal of Formalized Reasoning&quot;.

== Mizar language ==

The distinctive feature of the Mizar language is its readability. As is common in mathematical text, it relies on classical logic and a declarative style. Mizar articles are written in ordinary ASCII, but the language was designed to be close enough to the mathematical vernacular that most mathematicians could read and understand Mizar articles without special training. Yet, the language enables the increased level of formality necessary for automated proof checking.

For a proof to be admitted, all steps have to be justified either by elementary logical arguments or by citing previously verified proofs. This results in a higher level of rigor and detail than is customary in mathematical textbooks and publications. Thus, a typical Mizar article is about four times as long as an equivalent paper written in ordinary style.

Formalization is relatively labor-intensive, but not impossibly difficult. Once one is versed in the system, it takes about one week of full-time work to have a textbook page formally verified. This suggests that its benefits are now within the reach of applied fields such as probability theory and economics.

== Mizar Mathematical Library ==

The Mizar Mathematical Library (MML) includes all theorems to which authors can refer in newly written articles. Once approved by the proof checker they are further evaluated in a process of peer-review for appropriate contribution and style. If accepted they are published in the associated &quot;Journal of Formalized Mathematics&quot; and added to the MML.

=== Breadth ===

As of July 2012, the MML included 1150 articles written by 241 authors. In aggregate, these contain more than 10,000 formal definitions of mathematical objects and about 52,000 theorems proved on these objects. More than 180 named mathematical facts have been given formal codification in this manner. Some examples are the Hahn–Banach theorem, Kőnig&#x27;s lemma, the Brouwer fixed point theorem, Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem, and the Jordan curve theorem.

This breadth of coverage has led some to suggest Mizar as one of the leading approximations to the QED utopia of encoding all core mathematics in computer verifiable form.

=== Availability ===

All MML articles are available in PDF form as the papers of the &quot;Journal of Formalized Mathematics&quot;. The full text of the MML is distributed with the Mizar checker and can be freely downloaded from the Mizar website. In an ongoing recent project the library was also made available in an experimental wiki form that only admits edits when they are approved by the Mizar checker.

The MML Query website implements a powerful search engine for the contents of the MML. Among other abilities, it can retrieve all MML theorems proved about any particular type or operator.

=== Logical structure ===

The MML is built on the axioms of the Tarski–Grothendieck set theory. Even though semantically all objects are sets, the language allows one to define and use syntactical weak types. For example, a set may be declared to be of type Nat only when its internal structure conforms with a particular list of requirements. In turn, this list serves as the definition of the natural numbers and the set of all the sets that conform to this list is denoted as NAT. This implementation of types seeks to reflect the way most mathematicians formally think of symbols and so streamline codification.

== Mizar Proof Checker ==

Distributions of the Mizar Proof Checker for all major operating systems are freely available for download at the Mizar Project website. Use of the proof checker is free for all non-commercial purposes. It is written in Free Pascal and the source code is available on GitHub.

<text>Cape Breton Highlands National Park is a Canadian national park on northern Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. The park was the first national park in the Atlantic provinces of Canada and covers an area of . It is one of 42 in Canada&#x27;s system of national parks.

It consists of mountains, valleys, waterfalls, rocky coastlines and the Cape Breton Highlands, a tundra-esque plateau. Forest types include Acadian and Boreal. The park includes the highest point in Nova Scotia, White Hill, at above sea level.

Rivers in the park include the Chéticamp River and the North Aspy River.

In 2014, Parks Canada started a four-year project with the Unama&#x27;ki Institute of Natural Resources, among other partners, to begin regional boreal forest restorations within this park.

==Recreation==
One-third of the Cabot Trail passing through the park features ocean and mountain views. The park is known for its &quot;steep cliffs and deep river canyons that carve into a forested plateau bordering the Atlantic Ocean&quot;.

The park contains 26 marked hiking trails, including the Skyline Trail.

At the western entrance of the park is the Acadian village of Chéticamp on the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and a park information centre. On the eastern side of the park are campsites as well as beaches at Ingonish on the Atlantic Ocean. Also on the east side of the park located in Ingonish at the Keltic Lodge resort is Highlands Links, an 18-hole golf course designed by Stanley Thompson. &quot;Golf Magazine&quot; ranked it as one of the top 100 courses in the world and the best public course in Canada. George Knudson suggested leaving clubs behind and just walking the course. The course has been certified by the Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary Program, a program aimed at conserving wildlife habitat in spaces used for other purposes.

There are five main salt water ocean beaches in the park and two freshwater lakes. The ocean beaches include Ingonish Beach, North Bay Beach, Broad Cove Beach, Black Brook Beach and La Bloc Beach. The two freshwater beaches include Freshwater Lake and Warren Lake. Freshwater Lake and Ingonish Beach are both supervised with a lifeguard during the summer months. There are very strong currents at Black Brook and Ingonish Beach which must be considered when bringing small children to these two beaches.

==Wildlife==
Birds visible from this park include three species of hawk, two species of owl, northern gannets, kestrel, Bicknell&#x27;s thrush, and the bald eagle. The first nest records of boreal owl for Nova Scotia were found in the southwestern corner of this park in 2004. This park is listed as an Important Bird Area.

Mammals include white-tailed deer, marten, lynx, muskrat, snowshoe hare, beaver, mink, bobcat, river otter, stoat, red fox, raccoon, moose, black bear, and coyote. The Gaspé shrew, the local name for a smallish variety of the long-tailed shrew, &quot;Sorex dispar&quot;, can be found on rocky slopes in the park.

Aquatic life visible from this park includes North Atlantic right whales, humpback whales, fin whales, minke whales, sei whales, pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbor seals, harp seals, and grey seals.

Reptiles include garter snake, red belly snake, ring-necked snake, smooth green snake, wood turtle and leatherback sea turtle.

Parks Canada transferred eighteen western moose (nine bulls, nine cows) from Alberta&#x27;s Elk Island National Park to this national park between 1947 and 1948.

In late October 2009, country folk singer Taylor Mitchell died as a result of her injuries and blood loss due to coyotes attacking her while she was hiking by herself on the Skyline Trail. This incident became the only recorded fatal coyote assault on an adult as well as a Canadian.

==Geology==
Most of the park resides within what is called the Ganderia Terrane, sometimes referred to as the Bras d&#x27;Or or Aspy Terrane. This was originally part of Gondwana, referred to as peri-Gondwanan Terrane, and through seafloor spreading, separated from Gondwana and collided with Laurentia during the Salinic Orogeny. The evidence of this collision, the closing of the Iapetus Ocean and the formation of the Iapetus Suture, is seen in the northwest part of the park where the Ganderia Terrane is connected with the Blair River Inlier, itself a remnant of the Laurentia continental margin, referred to as peri-Laurentian Terrane. Other terrane collisions followed, including the Avalonia Terrane during the Acadian orogeny, and the Meguma Terrane during the Neoacadian Orogeny. Then, between 340 and 300 Ma, Gondwana collided with Laurentia, forming Pangea. Rifting started about 200 Ma eventually forming the Atlantic Ocean.

Along the Cabot Trail between the park headquarters at Ingonish Beach and Ingonish, a 402 Ma old Early Devonian granodiorite is exposed, the Cameron Brook Pluton, while the Keltic Lodge, on Middle Head, sits on a 493 Ma old Early Ordovician granite and a 550 Ma old Neoproterozoic diorite. The beach in front of Freshwater Lake is a classic shingle beach, a barrier beach with boulders well rounded and polished from wave action. Glacial debris is evident along the trail at the north end of the lake. A similar bar cuts across Ingonish Harbor.

A Middle to 375 Ma Late Devonian granite is seen along the Cabot Trail between Ingonish and where it leaves the park near South Harbor, while a 403 Ma Early Devonian orthogneiss is exposed at Neils Harbour northward. From Cape North, the Cabot Trail follows the Aspy Fault southwards, where the Early Carboniferous Windsor Group and Horton Group outcrops, until it reenters the park at Big Intervale. These groups of rocks consist of limestone, mudstone, anhydrite, gypsum, halite, siltstone, fluvial sandstone, shale, and conglomerate. The Windsor Group is also exposed at Ingonish and Ingonish Beach.

The Cabot Trail then doglegs to the north, crossing the Wilkie Brook Fault Zone, and entering the southernmost extent of the Blair River Inlier. The inlier is bounded by the Wilkie Brook Fault Zone on the east and the Red River Fault Zone on the southwest near Lone Shieling. The fault zones are marked by a zone of sheared rocks characterized by mylonite. Between these zones are outcrops of Silurian Fox Back Ridge diorite and granodiorite, as well as the Red River Anorthosite Suite of Middle Proterozoic age.

The Cabot Trail then follows the Grande Anse River westwards, with exposed Horton Group until it reaches the coast at Pleasant Bay. This is the location of the 364 Ma Late Devonian granite of the Pleasant Bay Pluton. Moving south along the trail, the 433 Ma Ordovician-Silurian Belle Cote Road orthogneiss is encountered, followed by another granite (Proterozoic-Devonian in age).

As the trail loops west to follow the coastline, rocks of the 439 Ma Ordovician-Silurian Jumping Brook Metamorphic Suite are exposed. This suite consists of metamorphosed siltstone, wacke, conglomerate, arkose, and minor rhyolite. In the midst of this suite may be found the 379 Ma Devonian granite of the Gillanders Mountain Pluton. The trail encounters a 439 Ma Cambrian granite before it exits the park at La Rigoueche.

<text>The Whitehead &quot;No.21&quot; was the aircraft that aviation pioneer Gustave Whitehead claimed to have flown near Bridgeport, Connecticut on August 14, 1901. Professional aviation historians and scholars reject claims for the flight. A description and photographs of Whitehead&#x27;s aircraft appeared in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in June 1901, stating that the &quot;novel flying machine&quot; had just been completed, and &quot;is now ready for preliminary trials&quot;. The flight was reported in the August 18, 1901, issue of the &quot;Bridgeport Sunday Herald&quot; and reprints or rewrites were published in many other newspapers.

Photographs exist showing the aircraft on the ground, but there are no photographs known of the aircraft in flight. The &quot;No.21&quot; was a monoplane powered by two engines—one for the wheels during the ground run, the other for driving the propellers in flight.

==Design and construction==
The &quot;No. 21&quot; was a wire-braced monoplane with bat-like wings and triangular horizontal tail. There was no vertical fin, and lateral control was intended to be accomplished by shifting the pilot&#x27;s body sideways.

The wings were constructed with radial bamboo ribs and covered with silk, and had a span of 36 ft (11 m). They had some dihedral when opened out to the flying position.

The fuselage was of rectangular box section with constant height, curved to taper inwards at front and rear when seen from above. Four small wheels were fixed to the bottom.

An analysis in 1980 concluded that the design as a whole was flimsy and aerodynamically unsound.

Although having two engines and twin propellers, the aircraft was not a conventional twin. It had separate engines for ground running and flight, both designed and made by Whitehead. The ground engine was of 10 hp (7.5 kW) and drove the wheels to reach takeoff speed. Propulsion was then changed to a 20 hp (15 kW) acetylene engine driving two counter-rotating tractor propellers mounted on outriggers. The aircraft was intended to take off under its own power and without assistance.

A description and photographs of Whitehead&#x27;s aircraft appeared in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in June 1901, stating that the &quot;novel flying machine&quot; had just been completed, and &quot;is now ready for preliminary trials.&quot; The article included photographs showing the aircraft on the ground.

==Claims of flight==
A minority of commentators claim that the No. 21 flew, but the majority of historians reject these claims.

Whitehead was quoted in a July 26 article in the &quot;Minneapolis Journal&quot;, credited to the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, in which he described the first two trial flights of his machine on May 3. Andrew Cellie and Daniel Varovi were mentioned as his financial backers who also assisted in the trial flights. The machine was unmanned and carried of sand as ballast and flew to an altitude of for an 1/8 of a mile (). According to Whitehead, the machine flew a distance of 1/2 mile () during its second test flight for one and one-half minutes before crashing into a tree. He also explained his desire to keep the location of any future experiments hidden to avoid drawing a crowd who might make a &quot;snap-shot verdict of failure&quot;.

In an article in the August 18, 1901, issue of the &quot;Bridgeport Sunday Herald&quot; a reporter states that he witnessed a night test of the machine, at first unpiloted and loaded with sand bags, and later with Whitehead at the controls. The story was reprinted in the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, the &quot;Boston Transcript&quot; and the &quot;Washington Times&quot;, which ran it on August 23, 1901. Within months, the story ran in nine other newspapers in all parts of the country, as far away as California and Arizona. A drawing of the aircraft in flight accompanied the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; article.

According to Whitehead and a reporter who claimed to have witnessed the event, the monoplane&#x27;s longest flight was above ground for .

Whitehead&#x27;s supporters say that he made four flights that day, which resulted in conflicting accounts from different witnesses. The conflicts have been used by opponents of the claims to question whether any flights took place.

These claims are rejected by mainstream historians. Whitehead did not keep a log book or document his work. In 1980 aviation historian C. H. Gibbs-Smith called the story a &quot;flight of fancy&quot;.

A minority of commentators have supported Whitehead&#x27;s claim to have flown the No. 21 and this has caused some controversy. In 2013 an editorial by Paul Jackson in the influential industry publication &quot;Jane&#x27;s All the World&#x27;s Aircraft&quot; credited Whitehead as the first man to build and fly a powered heavier-than-air flying machine. The corporate owner of &quot;Jane&#x27;s&quot; subsequently distanced itself from the editorial, stating &quot;the article reflected Mr. Jackson&#x27;s opinion on the issue and not that of IHS Jane&#x27;s&quot;. Tom Crouch, senior curator of aeronautics for the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) of the Smithsonian Institution, studied evidence for the alleged flight and in 2016 he issued a strong rebuttal, noting many other authorities who had already done so.

==Replicas==
Two replicas have been flown. They both introduced modern technologies and do not inform as to whether the original might have been capable of flight.

In 1986 American Andrew Kosch, a local high school teacher and hang glider pilot, led a team which built a replica of Whitehead&#x27;s &quot;No.21&quot;. The replica used two modern ultralight aircraft engines in place of the original steam and acetylene engines, and the landing gear track was increased for better ground handling. Initially, actor Cliff Robertson piloted the replica while under tow behind a sports car. On December 29, 1986, Kosch made several flights in the replica, reporting that he flew 100 m (330 ft). 

A second replica was built in Germany, using modern research and materials, such as fibreglass, and with a modern engine. On February 18, 1998, it was flown 500 m (1,600 ft).

<text>This is a list of notable numbers and articles about notable numbers. The list does not contain all numbers in existence as most of the number sets are infinite. Numbers may be included in the list based on their mathematical, historical or cultural notability, but all numbers have qualities that could arguably make them notable. Even the smallest &quot;uninteresting&quot; number is paradoxically interesting for that very property. This is known as the interesting number paradox.

The definition of what is classed as a number is rather diffuse and based on historical distinctions. For example, the pair of numbers (3,4) is commonly regarded as a number when it is in the form of a complex number (3+4i), but not when it is in the form of a vector (3,4). This list will also be categorized with the standard convention of types of numbers.

This list focuses on numbers as mathematical objects and is &quot;not&quot; a list of numerals, which are linguistic devices: nouns, adjectives, or adverbs that &quot;designate&quot; numbers. The distinction is drawn between the &quot;number&quot; five (an abstract object equal to 2+3), and the &quot;numeral&quot; five (the noun referring to the number).

== Natural numbers ==

Natural numbers are a subset of the integers and are of historical and pedagogical value as they can be used for counting and often have ethno-cultural significance (see below). Beyond this, natural numbers are widely used as a building block for other number systems including the integers, rational numbers and real numbers. Natural numbers are those used for counting (as in &quot;there are &quot;six&quot; (6) coins on the table&quot;) and ordering (as in &quot;this is the &quot;third&quot; (3rd) largest city in the country&quot;). In common language, words used for counting are &quot;cardinal numbers&quot; and words used for ordering are &quot;ordinal numbers&quot;. Defined by the Peano axioms, the natural numbers form an infinitely large set. Often referred to as &quot;the naturals&quot;, the natural numbers are usually symbolised by a boldface (or blackboard bold formula_1, Unicode )&quot;.&quot;

The inclusion of 0 in the set of natural numbers is ambiguous and subject to individual definitions. In set theory and computer science, 0 is typically considered a natural number. In number theory, it usually is not. The ambiguity can be solved with the terms &quot;non-negative integers&quot;, which includes 0, and &quot;positive integers&quot;, which does not.

Natural numbers may be used as cardinal numbers, which may go by various names. Natural numbers may also be used as ordinal numbers.


=== Mathematical significance ===
Natural numbers may have properties specific to the individual number or may be part of a set (such as prime numbers) of numbers with a particular property.

=== Cultural or practical significance ===
Along with their mathematical properties, many integers have cultural significance or are also notable for their use in computing and measurement. As mathematical properties (such as divisibility) can confer practical utility, there may be interplay and connections between the cultural or practical significance of an integer and its mathematical properties.



== Classes of natural numbers ==
Subsets of the natural numbers, such as the prime numbers, may be grouped into sets, for instance based on the divisibility of their members. Infinitely many such sets are possible. A list of notable classes of natural numbers may be found at .

=== Prime numbers ===

A prime number is a positive integer which has exactly two divisors: 1 and itself.

The first 100 prime numbers are:

=== Highly composite numbers ===
A highly composite number (HCN) is a positive integer with more divisors than any smaller positive integer. They are often used in geometry, grouping and time measurement.

The first 20 highly composite numbers are:

1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, 720, 840, 1260, 1680, 2520, 5040, 7560

=== Perfect numbers ===
A perfect number is an integer that is the sum of its positive proper divisors (all divisors except itself).

The first 10 perfect numbers:

== Integers ==
The integers are a set of numbers commonly encountered in arithmetic and number theory. There are many subsets of the integers, including the natural numbers, prime numbers, perfect numbers, etc. Many integers are notable for their mathematical properties. Integers are usually symbolised by a boldface (or blackboard bold formula_2, Unicode ); this became the symbol for the integers based on the German word for &quot;numbers&quot; (&quot;).&quot;

Notable integers include −1, the additive inverse of unity, and 0, the additive identity.

As with the natural numbers, the integers may also have cultural or practical significance. For instance, −40 is the equal point in the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales.

=== SI prefixes ===
One important use of integers is in orders of magnitude. A power of 10 is a number 10&quot;k&quot;, where &quot;k&quot; is an integer. For instance, with &quot;k&quot; = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., the appropriate powers of ten are 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... Powers of ten can also be fractional: for instance, &quot;k&quot; = -3 gives 1/1000, or 0.001. This is used in scientific notation, real numbers are written in the form &quot;m&quot; × 10&quot;n&quot;. The number 394,000 is written in this form as 3.94 × 105.

Integers are used as prefixes in the SI system. A metric prefix is a unit prefix that precedes a basic unit of measure to indicate a multiple or fraction of the unit. Each prefix has a unique symbol that is prepended to the unit symbol. The prefix &quot;kilo-&quot;, for example, may be added to &quot;gram&quot; to indicate &quot;multiplication&quot; by one thousand: one kilogram is equal to one thousand grams. The prefix &quot;milli-&quot;, likewise, may be added to &quot;metre&quot; to indicate &quot;division&quot; by one thousand; one millimetre is equal to one thousandth of a metre.

== Rational numbers ==

A rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction of two integers, a numerator and a non-zero denominator . Since may be equal to 1, every integer is trivially a rational number. The set of all rational numbers, often referred to as &quot;the rationals&quot;, the field of rationals or the field of rational numbers is usually denoted by a boldface (or blackboard bold formula_3, Unicode ); it was thus denoted in 1895 by Giuseppe Peano after &quot;&quot;, Italian for &quot;quotient&quot;.

Rational numbers such as 0.12 can be represented in infinitely many ways, e.g. &quot;zero-point-one-two&quot; (0.12), &quot;three twenty-fifths&quot; (), &quot;nine seventy-fifths&quot; (), etc. This can be mitigated by representing rational numbers in a canonical form as an irreducible fraction.

A list of rational numbers is shown below. The names of fractions can be found at numeral (linguistics).


== Real numbers ==
Real numbers are least upper bounds of sets of rational numbers that are bounded above, or greatest lower bounds of sets of rational numbers that are bounded below, or limits of convergent sequences of rational numbers. Real numbers that are not rational numbers are called irrational numbers. The real numbers are categorised as algebraic numbers (which are the root of a polynomial with rational coefficients) or transcendental numbers, which are not; all rational numbers are algebraic.

=== Algebraic numbers ===


=== Transcendental numbers ===

=== Irrational but not known to be transcendental===
Some numbers are known to be irrational numbers, but have not been proven to be transcendental. This differs from the algebraic numbers, which are known not to be transcendental.

=== Real but not known to be irrational, nor transcendental ===
For some numbers, it is not known whether they are algebraic or transcendental. The following list includes real numbers that have not been proved to be irrational, nor transcendental.

=== Numbers not known with high precision ===

Some real numbers, including transcendental numbers, are not known with high precision.

* The constant in the Berry–Esseen Theorem: 0.4097 &lt; &quot;C&quot; &lt; 0.4748
* De Bruijn–Newman constant: 0 ≤ Λ ≤ 0.2
* Chaitin&#x27;s constants Ω, which are transcendental and provably impossible to compute.
* Bloch&#x27;s constant (also 2nd Landau&#x27;s constant): 0.4332 &lt; &quot;B&quot; &lt; 0.4719
* 1st Landau&#x27;s constant: 0.5 &lt; &quot;L&quot; &lt; 0.5433

== Hypercomplex numbers ==

Hypercomplex number is a term for an element of a unital algebra over the field of real numbers. The complex numbers are often symbolised by a boldface (or blackboard bold formula_4, Unicode ), while the set of quaternions is denoted by a boldface (or blackboard bold formula_5, Unicode ).

=== Algebraic complex numbers ===
* Imaginary unit: formula_6
* &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity: formula_7, while formula_8, GCD(&quot;k&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) = 1

===Other hypercomplex numbers===
* The quaternions
* The octonions
* The sedenions
* The trigintaduonions
* The dual numbers (with an infinitesimal)

== Transfinite numbers ==

Transfinite numbers are numbers that are &quot;infinite&quot; in the sense that they are larger than all finite numbers, yet not necessarily absolutely infinite.
* Aleph-null: ℵ0, the smallest infinite cardinal, and the cardinality of formula_9, the set of natural numbers
* Aleph-one: ℵ1, the cardinality of ω1, the set of all countable ordinal numbers
* Beth-one: formula_10 or formula_11, the cardinality of the continuum 2
* Omega: ω, the smallest infinite ordinal

== Numbers representing physical quantities ==

Physical quantities that appear in the universe are often described using physical constants.
* Avogadro constant: 
* Electron mass: 
* Fine-structure constant: 
* Gravitational constant: 
* Molar mass constant: 
* Planck constant: 
* Rydberg constant: 
* Speed of light in vacuum: 
* Vacuum electric permittivity: 

== Numbers representing geographical and astronomical distances ==
* , the average equatorial radius of Earth in kilometers (following GRS 80 and WGS 84 standards).
* , the length of the Equator in kilometers (following GRS 80 and WGS 84 standards).
* , the semi-major axis of the orbit of the Moon, in kilometers, roughly the distance between the center of Earth and that of the Moon.
* , the average distance between the Earth and the Sun or Astronomical Unit (AU), in meters.
* , one light-year, the distance travelled by light in one Julian year, in meters.
* , the distance of one parsec, another astronomical unit, in whole meters.

== Numbers without specific values ==

Many languages have words expressing indefinite and fictitious numbers—inexact terms of indefinite size, used for comic effect, for exaggeration, as placeholder names, or when precision is unnecessary or undesirable. One technical term for such words is &quot;non-numerical vague quantifier&quot;. Such words designed to indicate large quantities can be called &quot;indefinite hyperbolic numerals&quot;.

== Named numbers ==
*Hardy–Ramanujan number, 1729
*Kaprekar&#x27;s constant, 6174
*Eddington number, ~1080
*Googol, 10100

<text>La Mauricie National Park () is a national park located near Shawinigan in the Laurentian Mountains, in the Mauricie region of Quebec, Canada. It covers in the southern Canadian Shield region bordering the Saint Lawrence lowlands. The park contains 150 lakes and many ponds.

The park lies within the Eastern forest-boreal transition ecoregion. The forests in this region were logged from the middle of the 19th century to the early 20th century. The park&#x27;s forests have regrown and contain a mixture of conifers and mixed deciduous trees.

Wildlife in the park includes moose, black bears, beavers and otters. It supports a small number of wood turtles, rare in Canada. The park is a popular location for camping, canoeing and kayaking.

The park is named after the nearby Saint-Maurice River to the east of the park. The Matawin River flows along the west and north borders of the park.

== Toponymy ==
The name &quot;Mauricie&quot; was first used in 1933 by Bishop Albert Tessier to designate an administrative region of Government of Québec, for which the Valley of Saint-Maurice is the main feature. The watershed of Saint-Maurice River is also administered in part by the administrative regions of Lanaudière (West), James Bay (North) and Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (East). Moreover, the administrative region of Mauricie covers other watersheds including the Champlain River and half the territory of the Batiscanie, Quebec.

As in Saint-Maurice River, it was named in honour of the Lordship of Maurice Poulin La Fontaine. The land was a stronghold granted to his wife in 1676 near the mouth of the river. This &quot;fief&quot; (harvested area) was recognized in 1723 as the Saint-Maurice and the river, which previously denominated &quot;River Three Rivers&quot;, was replaced by the current toponym for most of the 18th century. The river is also known Attikamekw under the name of &quot;Tapiskwan Sipi&quot; (&quot;River of the threaded needle&quot;). The Wyandot people know it under the name of Oquintondili and Abenaki under the name of Madôbalodenitekw.

== Geography ==
The Mauricie National Park is located in the province of Quebec, Canada about north of Shawinigan and about north of the city of Trois-Rivières. It is bordered by the Saint-Maurice River to the east and the Matawin River to the north. It is accessible from the villages of Saint-Jean-des-Piles and Saint-Mathieu-du-Parc. Secondary access is also possible by Saint-Gérard-des-Laurentides. The park extends only three municipalities: Shawinigan, Saint-Mathieu-du-Parc and Saint-Roch-de-Mékinac.

It is bordered to the west by the Mastigouche Wildlife Reserve and north by the Zec du Chapeau-de-Paille and the Saint-Maurice Wildlife Reserve.

=== Geology ===

The park is located in Quebec, south of Canadian Shield. The park is part of the Grenville Province, the most recent of seven geological provinces that make up the entire Canadian Shield age Precambrian. The park is itself part of a plateau gently sloping east to west, from near Saint-Maurice River to near inland. This plateau of older metamorphic rocks (955 mya) is strewn with valleys and faults. The lower valleys are flooded by recent deposits dating from the retreating glaciers of the Wisconsin glaciation.

=== Hydrography ===

There are approximately 150 lakes in the national park. Lake size varies from small bogs at higher elevations containing acidic water to the largest valley lakes that have clear water. All lakes and streams flow into the Saint-Maurice by rivers &quot;À la pêche&quot; River (Shawinigan), Matawin and Shawinigan.

== Natural heritage ==
The Mauricie National Park is located in the green area Level I established by Commission for Environmental Cooperation of Northern Forests. It is also entirely within the ecoregion level II of the mixed forest shield and ecological level III region of Southern Laurentians.

At the national level, the National Park is located in the ecoregion southern Laurentians, itself located in Ecoprovince Southern Boreal Shield and the Boreal Boreal Shield.

=== Flora ===

The park contains more than 440 species of vascular plants 68 species of lichens and more than 85 species of mosses. The park also has 27 species of rare plants or special interest.

Forest covers 93% of the territory. It is located at the northern treeline leafyes Quebec. There are 30 species of different trees. The park is part of habitat ranges from maple to yellow birch (&quot;Acer saccharum&quot; and &quot;Betula papyrifera&quot;), which occupies the illuminated slopes and well-drained soils. The Balsam firs (&quot;Abies balsamea&quot;) and the pine (&quot;Pinus sp&quot;) and spruces (&quot;Picea sp&quot;) occupy the rocky cliffs and wetlands. It includes an endangered species, the butternut (&quot;Juglans cinerea&quot;).

=== Wildlife ===

The park holds populations of dark-eyed junco (&quot;Junco hyemalis&quot;). Mixed forests are occupied by the ruffed grouse (&quot;Bonasa umbellus&quot;), the blue jay (&quot;Cyanocitta cristata&quot;), the black-capped chickadee (&quot;Poecile atricapillus&quot;) and the purple finch (&quot;Carpodacus purpureus&quot;). The ovenbird (&quot;Seiurus aurocapilla&quot;), the black-throated blue warbler (&quot;Dendroica caerulescens&quot;), the veery (&quot;Catharus fuscescens&quot;), the red-eyed vireo (&quot;Vireo olivaceus&quot;), the eastern wood pewee (&quot;Contopus virens&quot;) and the sapsucker (&quot;Sphyrapicus varius&quot;) inhabit the hardwood forests. The most common raptors observed are (&quot;Pandion haliaetus&quot;) the broad-winged hawk (&quot;Buteo platypterus&quot;), the barred owl (&quot;Strix varia&quot;) and the great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;). Aquatic areas serve as nesting habitat for the common goldeneye (&quot;Bucephala clangula&quot;), the merganser (&quot;Mergus merganser&quot;), the black duck (&quot;Anas rubripes&quot;) and finally the common loon (&quot;Gavia immer&quot;), which is the emblem of the park. The park includes eight species at risk, the whip-poor-will (&quot;Caprimulgus vociferus&quot;), the nighthawk (&quot;Chordeiles minor&quot;), the chimney swift (&quot;Chaetura pelagica&quot;), the olive-sided flycatcher (&quot;Contopus cooperi&quot;), the Canada warbler (&quot;Wilsonia canadensis&quot;), the peregrine falcon (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;) and the rusty blackbird (&quot;Euphagus carolinus&quot;).

This park includes only five species of reptiles: the wood turtle (&quot;Glyptemys insculpta&quot;), the painted turtle (&quot;Chrysemys picta&quot;) and three species of snake, including the garter (&quot;Thamnophis sirtalis&quot;). It is also attended by fourteen species of amphibians including six salamanders and eight frogs. One species, the wood turtle, is considered endangered.

Mammals that inhabit this park include snowshoe hare (&quot;Lepus americanus&quot;), raccoon (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), moose (&quot;Alces alces americana&quot;), beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;), porcupine (&quot;Erethizon dorsatum&quot;), groundhog (&quot;Marmota monax&quot;), river otter (&quot;Lontra canadensis&quot;), marten (&quot;Martes americana&quot;), red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), black bear (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;), coyote (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), lynx (&quot;Lynx canadensis&quot;), mink (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;), fisher (&quot;Pekania pennanti&quot;), and eastern wolf (&quot;Canis lycaon&quot;).

Most lakes have a relatively poor fish fauna due to the youth of the country. The brook trout (&quot;Salvelinus fontinalis&quot;) is most commonly found, especially in the north of the park. The Isaiah, the French and the Bérubé are found at lower altitudes, where lakes have the greatest biodiversity, as well as populations of stickleback (&quot;Pungitius pungitius&quot;) and spoonhead sculpin (&quot;Cottus ricei&quot;). The lakes also have the only French population of char (&quot;Salvelinus alpinus&quot;) of park. This population was threatened by the introduction at the beginning of the century of several invasive fish species, such as chub (&quot;Semotilus atromaculatus&quot;). 19 species of fish have been introduced by humans over the 19th and 20th centuries.

== History ==

The earliest human remains in the park date from the Archaic period in North America, between 7000 and 3000 BC. The 34 &quot;protohistoric&quot; archeological sites suggest that Native Americans who frequented the park lived in small family groups. They mainly occupied the valley of lakes Antigamac and Wapizagonke and fished, hunted and gathered. A cliff of Lake Wapizagonke also contains cave paintings, which is one of the few witnesses to the spirituality of Native Americans in that era. Until the 17th century, the Attikamekw and Algonquian peoples respectively occupied the northern and southern basins of the Saint-Maurice River, making a living mainly by trap and hunting. The Abenaki used the park area in the middle of the 19th century for hunting and trade.

At the beginning of the 19th century logging began. It began by cutting white and red pines for lumber. This lasted until 1925, when trees of good diameter became scarce. The forest industry then turned instead to wood for paper, which made the Mauricie one of the largest paper producers newspaper for the first half of the 20th century. In addition to logging, the industry greatly altered the balance of forests by planting the white spruce and causing forest fires in 1910 and 1954.
At the end of the 19th century, rich American tourists settled in the area and opened private hunting and fishing clubs. The first three were the &quot;open&quot; Shawinigan Club 1883, the &quot;Laurentian Club&quot; in 1886 and the Club Commodore in 1905. Thirteen other less prestigious clubs settled on the territory of the park between 1940 and the creation of the park in 1970. Membership in the clubs was selective and members enjoyed the right to hunt and fish in the territory. Although they allowed a certain amount of nature protection in the territory of the park, these clubs introduced many exotic fish species into the lakes. Of these clubs, there remain only the &quot;Wabenaki and Andrew lodges&quot;, old properties of the &quot;Laurentian Club&quot; located on the edge of lac à la Pêche (Lake of Fisheries). They were acquired by Parks Canada in 1972 and were converted into dormitories and rooms for visitors. A cottage at &quot;lac des cinq&quot; (Lake of the Five), once owned by the Brown family, is today used by the park staff.

The park was created on August 21, 1970 after a federal-provincial agreement. This creation stopped the activities of the 16 private clubs in its territory.

== Activities ==

=== Canoe camping ===

The park offers a canoe camping circuit allowing access to a dozen lakes in the hinterland connected by many portages. This circuit allows accessing to some 200 camping sites that are accessible only by boat.

<text>The United States Community Health Services and Facilities Act (, ) was enacted by the 87th United States Congress and signed into law on October 5, 1961. Its passage was encouraged by the 1961 White House Conference on Aging, which is held once every ten years. 

The 1961 act funded grants to the states for the expansion of medical services facilities like nursing homes, and medical programs for general public health and outpatient services for the elderly. It also extended and strengthened the 1946 Hill–Burton Act.

<text>Prince Edward Island National Park () is a National Park of Canada located in the province of Prince Edward Island. Situated along the island&#x27;s north shore, fronting the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the park measures approximately in length and ranges from several hundred metres to several kilometres in width. Established in 1937, the park&#x27;s mandate includes the protection of many broad sand beaches, sand dunes and both freshwater wetlands and saltmarshes. The park&#x27;s protected beaches provide nesting habitat for the endangered piping plover; the park has been designated a Canadian Important Bird Area.

An extension was added to the park in 1998 when an extensive sand dune system in Greenwich was transferred from the provincial government to Parks Canada. The Prince Edward Island National Park also includes Green Gables, a 19th century farm that was the childhood inspiration for the &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; novels by author Lucy Maud Montgomery, as well as Dalvay-by-the-Sea, a Victorian era mansion currently operated as an inn.

In 1999, the Canadian Nature Federation identified Prince Edward Island National Park as being the most endangered in the national park system, based on human impact. The park also experiences severe coastal erosion as a result of winter storms and its vulnerable shoreline.

The park was the subject of a short film in 2011&#x27;s &quot;National Parks Project&quot;, directed by John Walker and scored by Chad Ross, Sophie Trudeau and Dale Morningstar. Part of the Jezero crater on Mars was informally named after the park.

==Wildlife==
Animals that inhabit this national park are coyotes, red foxes, raccoons, beavers, minks, and weasels. Numerous birds roam in this park including species of various herons, ducks, owls, cranes, plovers, grouses, jays, falcons, geese, hawks, sandpipers and eagles.

<text>Qumran (; &quot;&quot;) is an archaeological site in the West Bank managed by Israel&#x27;s Qumran National Park. It is located on a dry marl plateau about from the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea, about south of the historic city of Jericho, and adjacent to the modern Israeli settlement and kibbutz of Kalya.

The Hellenistic period settlement was constructed during the reign of Hasmonean leader John Hyrcanus () or somewhat later. Qumran was inhabited by a Jewish sect of the late Second Temple period, which most scholars identify with the Essenes; however, other Jewish groups were also suggested. It was occupied most of the time until and was destroyed by the Romans during the First Jewish–Roman War, possibly as late as 73 CE. It was later used by Jewish rebels during the Bar Kokhba revolt. Today, the Qumran site is best known as the settlement nearest to the Qumran Caves where the Dead Sea Scrolls were hidden, caves in the sheer desert cliffs and beneath, in the marl terrace. The principal excavations at Qumran were conducted by Roland de Vaux in the 1950s, and several later digs have been carried out.

Since the 1967 Six-Day War, Qumran has been managed by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority.

==History==

Since the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947–1956, extensive excavations have taken place in Qumran. Nearly 900 scrolls were discovered. Most were written on parchment and some on papyrus. Cisterns, Jewish ritual baths, and cemeteries have been found, along with a dining or assembly room and debris from an upper story alleged by some to have been a scriptorium as well as pottery kilns and a tower.

Many scholars believe the location was home to a Jewish sect, probably the Essenes. But, according to Lawrence Schiffman, the rules of the community, its heavy stress on priesthood and the Zadokite legacy, and other details indicate a Sadducean-oriented sect either distinct from or one of the various Essene groupings. Others propose non-sectarian interpretations, some of these starting with the notion that it was a Hasmonean fort that was later transformed into a villa for a wealthy family, or a production center, perhaps a pottery factory or something similar.

=== Qumran cemeteries ===
A large cemetery was discovered to the east of the site. Besides this primary cemetery, there are also three separate extensions of it, as well as the north cemetery (about 10 minutes away from the primary) and a cemetery south of Wadi Qumran.

While most of the graves contain the remains of males, some females were also discovered, though some burials may be from medieval times. Only a small portion of the graves were excavated, as excavating cemeteries is forbidden under Jewish law. Over a thousand bodies are buried at Qumran cemetery. One theory is that bodies were those of generations of sectarians, while another is that they were brought to Qumran because burial was easier there than in rockier surrounding areas.
The scrolls were found in a series of eleven caves around the settlement, some accessible only through the settlement. Some scholars have claimed that the caves were the permanent libraries of the sect, due to the presence of the remains of a shelving system. Other scholars believe that some caves also served as domestic shelters for those living in the area. Many of the texts found in the caves appear to represent widely accepted Jewish beliefs and practices, while other texts appear to speak of divergent, unique, or minority interpretations and practices. Some scholars believe that some of these texts describe the beliefs of the inhabitants of Qumran, who may have been Essenes, or the asylum for supporters of the traditional priestly family of the Zadokites against the Hasmonean priest/kings. A literary epistle published in the 1990s expresses reasons for creating a community, some of which resemble Sadducean arguments in the Talmud. Most of the scrolls seem to have been hidden in the caves during the turmoil of the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE), although some of them may have been deposited earlier.

==Discovery and excavation==
===Early site analysis===
The site of Khirbet Qumran had been known to European explorers since the 19th century. The initial attention of the early explorers was focused on the cemetery, beginning with de Saulcy in 1851. In fact, the first excavations at Qumran (prior to the development of modern methodology) were of burials in the cemetery, conducted by Henry Poole in 1855 followed by Charles Clermont-Ganneau in 1873.

Albert Isaacs, British counsel James Finn, and photographer James Graham visited Qumran in December 1856. Isaacs stated regarding Qumran&#x27;s tower, &quot;It can hardly be doubted that this formed a tower or stronghold of some kind. The situation is commanding, and well adapted for defensive operations.&quot; Finn later suggested Qumran was &quot;some ancient fort with a cistern&quot;.

The British scholar Ernest William Gurney Masterman visited Qumran on several occasions between 1900 and 1901. After observing the positioning of Qumran atop a plateau overlooking the ‘Ein Feshkha Springs, he concluded the ruins &quot;may have very well been once a small fortress&quot;. Masterman also questioned why a small fort would require a graveyard of over one thousand tombs.

Gustaf Dalman visited Qumran in 1914, and explicitly identified Qumran as a &quot;burg&quot;, or fort. Archaeologist Michael Avi-Yonah agreed with Dalman&#x27;s identification of Qumran as a fort and published a map that identified the remains at Qumran as part of a string of fortresses along the southeastern Judean border.

===Major excavations===
Full-scale work at the site began after Roland de Vaux and Gerald Lankester Harding in 1949 excavated what became known as Cave 1, the first scroll-bearing cave. A cursory surface survey that year produced nothing of interest, but continued interest in the scrolls led to a more substantial analysis of the ruins at Qumran in 1951. This analysis yielded traces of pottery closely related to that found in Cave 1. This discovery led to intensive excavations at the site over a period of six seasons (1951–1956) under the direction of De Vaux. The most-prized find at Qumran up to this time were three small juglets containing over five-hundred silver coins, which were found in a room on the west side of the monastery. They consisted of tetradrachmae that had been minted in Tyre at various times in the first-century BCE.
The Iron Age remains at the site, which were modest but included a LMLK seal, led de Vaux to identify Qumran as the City of Salt listed in Josh 15:62. The site, however, may be identified with Secacah, which is referenced in the same area as the City of Salt in the Book of Joshua 15:61. Secacah is mentioned in the Copper Scroll, and the water works of Secacah that are described in this source are consistent with those of Qumran. The excavations revealed that after the Iron Age, Qumran was principally in use from the Hasmonean times until some time after the destruction of the temple by Titus in 70 CE. De Vaux divided this use into three periods:
* Period I, the Hasmonean era, which he further divided in two:
** Period Ia, the time of John Hyrcanus
** Period Ib, the latter Hasmoneans, ending with an earthquake and fire in 31 BCE (this was followed by a hiatus in de Vaux&#x27;s interpretation of the site)
* Period II, the Herodian era, starting in 4 BCE on up to the destruction of the site apparently at the hands of the Romans during the Jewish War
* Period III, a reoccupation in the ruins

De Vaux&#x27;s periodization has been challenged by both Jodi Magness and Yizhar Hirschfeld.

The site that de Vaux uncovered divides into two main sections: a &quot;main building&quot;, a squarish structure of two stories featuring a central courtyard and a defensive tower on its north-western corner; and a &quot;secondary building&quot; to the west. The excavation revealed a complex water system that had supplied water to several stepped cisterns, some quite large, located in various parts of the site. Two of these cisterns were within the walls of the main building.

Both the buildings and the water system evince signs of consistent evolution throughout the life of the settlement. with frequent additions, extensions and improvements. The water channel was raised to carry water to newer cisterns farther away and a dam was placed in the upper section of Wadi Qumran to secure more water, which was brought to the site by an aqueduct. Rooms were added, floors were raised, pottery ovens relocated and locations were repurposed.

De Vaux found three inkwells at Qumran (Loci 30 (2) and 31) and over the following years more inkwells have come to light with a Qumran origin. Jan Gunneweg identified a fourth (locus 129). S. Steckoll found a fifth (reportedly near the scriptorium). Magen and Peleg found a sixth inkwell. Without counting the Ein Feshkha inkwell or others with debated provenance, that number is more inkwells than found at any other site of the Second Temple Period, a significant indication of writing at Qumran.

===De Vaux&#x27;s interpretations===
De Vaux interpreted his findings at Qumran based (at least in part) upon information in the Dead Sea Scrolls—which continued to be discovered in the nearby caves throughout his excavations. De Vaux concluded that the remains at Qumran were left by a sectarian religious community. Using his excavations as well as textual sources, including the Dead Sea Scrolls and the historical accounts recorded by Pliny the Elder, Philo, and Flavius Josephus, de Vaux&#x27;s conclusion was that the inhabitants of the site were a sect of highly ritualistic Jews called the Essenes, a conclusion that has come to be known as the &quot;Qumran–Essene hypothesis&quot;. This hypothesis suggests that the original residents of the settlement were the Essenes, and that they established the site in the desert for religious purposes.

He interpreted the room above locus 30 as a &quot;scriptorium&quot; because he discovered inkwells there. A plastered bench was also discovered in the remains of an upper story. De Vaux concluded that this was the area where the Essenes could have written some of the Dead Sea Scrolls. De Vaux also interpreted locus 77 as a &quot;refectory&quot;, or a community dining hall, based on the discovery of numerous sets of bowls in the nearby &quot;pantry&quot; of locus 89. Additionally, de Vaux interpreted many of the numerous stepped cisterns as &quot;miqva’ot&quot;, or Jewish ritual baths, due to their similarity to several stepped and partitioned ritual baths near the Jerusalem Temple Mount.

Regarding the scrolls de Vaux cautiously stated that &quot;manuscripts were copied in the &quot;scriptorium&quot; of Qumran... We may also suppose... that certain works were composed at Khirbet Qumran. But beyond this we cannot go.&quot; He believed that the Essenes later hid the scrolls in the nearby caves when they felt their safety was in danger.

Roland de Vaux died in 1971 without having provided a full report on the excavations at Qumran. In 1986 the École Biblique appointed the Belgian archaeologist Robert Donceel to the task of publishing the final results of de Vaux&#x27;s excavations. Preliminary findings were presented at a conference in New York in 1992, but a final report never eventuated. According to Pauline Donceel-Voûte the final report was impossible to write, because many artifacts had been lost or corrupted (in particular, according to the Donceels, some of the coins excavated by Roland de Vaux from Qumran had been lost.) To fill the gap, the École had a synthesis of de Vaux&#x27;s field notes published in 1994. This volume included several hundred photographs, 48 pages of measurement, and summary descriptions of the field diaries. An English translation of the field notes synthesis was published in 2003. Two later books, devoted to the interpretation of the excavations of de Vaux, were published by Jean-Baptiste Humbert in 2003 and 2016. However, not all of de Vaux&#x27;s archaeological findings from Qumran (which are stored in the Rockefeller Museum) have yet been published; some are still inaccessible to scholars and the public.

===Further excavations and surveys===
Although de Vaux&#x27;s excavations of Qumran were quite exhaustive, and thereby the most important source of information on the settlement, there have been several excavations since de Vaux finished his work. As de Vaux left little of the settlement unexcavated, later archaeologists have often turned elsewhere to continue research, including dump sites from de Vaux&#x27;s excavations. During the 1960s, according to Catherine Murphy, there were some unpublished excavations at Qumran by John Allegro and by Solomon Steckoll. Steckoll also carried out work in the cemetery, excavating twelve tombs. In 1967 restoration work was performed at Qumran by R.W. Dajjani of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan.

In 1984 and 1985 Joseph Patrich and Yigael Yadin carried out a systematic survey of the caves and pathways around Qumran. Between 1985 and 1991 Patrich excavated five caves, including Caves 3Q and 11Q. One of Patrich&#x27;s conclusions was that the caves &quot;did not serve as habitations for the members of the Dead Sea Sect, but rather as stores and hiding places&quot;.

From mid-November 1993 to January 1994 the Israel Antiquities Authority carried out works in the Qumran compound and nearby installations as part of &quot;Operation Scroll&quot; under the direction of Amir Drori and Yitzhak Magen. In the winter of 1995–1996 and later seasons Magen Broshi and Hanan Eshel carried out further excavations in the caves north of Qumran; they also dug in the cemetery and in marl terrace caves. In 1996 James Strange and others dug at Qumran using remote sensing equipment. From 1996 to 1999 and later Yitzhak Magen and Yuval Peleg carried out excavations at Qumran under the auspices of the National Parks Authority. Randall Price and Oren Gutfeld dug on the Qumran plateau, seasons in 2002, 2004 and 2005 (and plan a 2010 season). Some new discoveries have been made.

==Recent archaeological analysis==

Most of the small finds from the de Vaux excavations were taken back to Jerusalem to be used in later excavation reports for Qumran, but the death of Roland de Vaux brought a halt to the reports and the small finds were left to gather dust on shelves in museum backrooms. In the late 1980s, archaeologist Robert Donceel worked on the de Vaux materials in a new effort towards publishing excavation reports. He found artifacts he believed did not fit the religious settlement model, including &quot;sophisticated glass and stoneware&quot;. In 1992 Pauline Donceel-Voute put forward the Roman villa model in an attempt to explain these artifacts. In 2002 archaeologists Minna and Kenneth Lönnqvist published their archaeological and spatial studies at Qumran bringing another view to the settlement interpretations including the astronomical orientations of some structures at Qumran. A recent final publication of the French excavations by Jean-Baptist Humbert outlining evidence of a decorated frieze, opus sectile, fine columns etc., indicates a phase of a wealthier occupation, &quot;une grande maison&quot;, at Qumran.

===Pottery===
The range of pottery, glass and high quantity of coins found at Qumran do not sit well in the context of a sectarian settlement according to the Donceels. These materials point to trade connections in the area, and provide evidence that Qumran may not have been in a vacuum in the Graeco-Roman period. Rachel Bar-Nathan has argued from similarities between pottery finds at Qumran and at the Hasmonean and Herodian palaces of Jericho that Qumran should be seen as part of the Jordan valley context, rather than as an isolated site. While the cylindrical &quot;scroll jars&quot; from Qumran were once thought unique, she cites a proposed similar find at Jericho, shows a related form existed at Masada, and reports that such jars have been found at Qalandiya. Bar-Nathan states from the Jericho palace data that, &quot;It is possible to trace the typological development of this group of jars&quot;, i.e., the cylindrical jars. Jodi Magness, citing Bar-Nathan&#x27;s M.A. thesis on the Jericho pottery data, refers to cylindrical jars at Jericho, saying &quot;[a]t Jericho, most of these jars .. come from an industrial area dating to the time of Herod&quot;. Jan Gunneweg observed that the supposed single partial parallel at Jericho – &quot;a partly preserved rim and neck with a vertical loop handle&quot; – is in fact not a &quot;scroll&quot; jar. Another one was reported found in Jordan in a later burial near Abila but no photos or drawings were published and the jar has not been relocated, showing de Vaux sought parallels. Taking into account subtypes of pottery, true cylindrical &quot;scroll&quot; jars are not common outside Qumran. They are, however, clearly not unique to Qumran. Bar-Nathan noted the jar&#x27;s &quot;rarity in the Second Temple period&quot;. Of some of the proposed parallel Masada jars, Bar-Nathan wrote &quot;It seems that this group of storage jars was brought (or pillaged?) from the area of Qumran and probably also from the Plain of Jericho.&quot;

===Cisterns===
Many scholars have viewed the several large stepped cisterns at Qumran as ritual baths. This supports the religious settlement model. There are difficulties in understanding all these cisterns as baths, however. Qumran&#x27;s water arrived perhaps twice a year from rainwater runoff. Water was one of Qumran&#x27;s most valued commodities, and water management is an integral part of the site, as seen with the numerous cisterns and channels. If the large cisterns were ritual baths, the water would sit getting dirtier through ritual bathing throughout the year and was extremely infrequently replenished by the run off. The current state of analysis of the cisterns is still unresolved, but Katharina Galor suggests a mixed usage of the stepped cisterns as both ritual baths and water storage. According to the Israeli archaeologists Magen and Peleg, the clay found in the cisterns was used for pottery factory facilities.

The construction of the Qumran aqueduct that fed the cisterns and the baths can be seen as an important chronological marker. Although there are some disagreements in this area, Stacey (2004) argues that it should be dated to around 95-90 BCE, which is during de Vaux’s Period Ib.

===Numismatic studies===
Coins from Qumran are one of the most important groups of primary evidence from the ancient site. Much of what has been written on the chronology, the occupational periods and the history of Qumran is based on the preliminary report and lecture by the original excavator, Roland de Vaux in 1961, which was translated in 1973. A tentative list of the Qumran bronze coins along with Roland de Vaux&#x27;s field diary from the excavations was published in 1994 in French, in German in 1996 and in English in 2003. The first reconstruction of the Qumran bronze coinage, including a complete coin catalogue with up-dated and cross-referenced coin identifications, was done by Kenneth Lönnqvist and Minna Lönnqvist in 2005. Also in 1955, three very important silver coin hoards were found at Qumran. The first lot of the Qumran silver coins was published by Marcia Sharabani in 1980. The last two hoards located in Amman, Jordan, were published by Kenneth Lönnqvist in 2007.

====The bronze coinage====
De Vaux&#x27;s excavations uncovered about 1250 coins (569 silver and 681 bronze coins) altogether from Qumran, though today some Qumran coins have been lost, some lots mixed-up, and records less accurate than ideal.

There are a surprisingly high number of coins from the site. This means that the site was highly monetized in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, i.e. that the occupants of Qumran were not a community of poor and isolated people. That the flow of cash at Qumran may have been large in the 1st century CE is hardly surprising given the archaeological evidence of trade at Qumran in luxury goods such as glass, which is specifically dated to this period.

The coin profile of Qumran shows that there do not appear to have been any major changes in the role of coins and money in the economic system at Qumran during any of the occupational periods from ca. 150 BCE. to 73 CE. Worth noting here is that the amount of coins found at Qumran suggests according to numismatic principles of loss and survival of ancient coins that millions of bronze coins must have circulated at Qumran.

The bronze coins identified from Qumran, some dating to the second and third years of the Jewish War, indicate that the site was still in use in 68 CE and only destroyed after 70, perhaps as late as 73. The coins from Qumran of this period end with a peculiar series of bronze coins minted in 72/73 at Ascalon, which sent auxiliary troops to assist the Roman army in the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73).

In 73 the Romans stormed the mountain fortress of Masada, which also was located on the western bank of the Dead Sea. It is more than likely that Qumran was destroyed this same time, as the coin finds from Qumran end with the same peculiar bronze coins minted at Ascalon.

====The silver coinage====
According to the publications prior to 2007, the most recent silver coin in the Qumran hoard(s) is a tetradrachm of Tyre from the year 9/8 BCE.

=====Lönnqvist analysis of 2007=====
The publication of the bulk of the silver coins by K. A. K. Lönnqvist, and his regional analysis, resulted, in 2007, in a new interpretations as to the importance, chronology and significance of the coins. According to Lönnqvist, the newly dated coins in the silver coin hoards give an earliest possible burial date for the coin hoards to 52/3–66 CE, based on an interpretation of a countermark. However, the archaeological and numismatic nature of the silver coin hoard burials may suggest that the coin hoards may have been buried in the early 3rd century. The final coin was minted in Rome between 206 and 210, during the reign of the emperor Caracalla.

The new suggestion made is that the silver coin hoards from Qumran may be connected to Roman military campaigns in the region, as these are widely attested in the early 3rd century CE. It is also quite possible that the silver was part of Roman army payments made to troops in a local garrison.

According to Lönnqvist, the technical evidence of the recording and documenting of the Qumran silver coin hoards in 2006–2007 showed that the coins came from lots, groups or batches of coins that originated in a few or one single large payment. This payment may have come from a mint, bank or an authority like the treasury of the Roman army. The new evidence refutes the possibility that the silver coins could have been collected from single individuals, for instance, as tax payments, or that Qumran could have been a regional &#x27;tax house&#x27;.

The new 2007 analysis of the silver coinage contradicts the findings of de Vaux, Seyrig, and Spijkerman as well as the findings of Robert Donceel. Donceel was surprised to find in the Amman museum unrecorded coins, notably denarius coins of Trajan, that he claimed were intrusive. The original Amman Museum records of the Qumran coin hoards and the museum bags where the coins were kept do not support the hypothesis that the 2nd- and 3rd-century Roman coins are intrusive in relation to the Tyrian silver.

Furthermore, the new countermark that went unrecorded is apparently from 52/53 CE and the Greek letters in it do not support a date of 9/8 BCE, as the other countermarks. This means archaeologically and numismatically that at least one, but probably two minimum, of the three hoards post-date de Vaux&#x27;s suggestion of a burial date after 9/8 BCE.

The unusual and intensive die-linkage of the Qumran silver hoards suggest that the three hoards were buried at the same time, and this would mean at the earliest in 52/53 CE.

According to Lönnqvist, a highly unusual type of coin hoard found at Ain Hanaziv in the Jordan Valley in the early 1960 and reported in the Israel Numismatic Bulletin supports his theory of a third-century CE date for the three silver coin hoards from Qumran. This Ain Hanaziv coin hoard spanned hundreds of years, starting from the Seleucid era and ended with the same kind of coins from the reign of Septimius Severus in 210.

Therefore, according to Lönnqvist, claiming an earlier date for the silver hoards is untenable and contradicts the first complete recording of the Qumran silver hoards made by him in 2007, which includes the first photographic evidence of the coin hoards, and the regional coin evidence from other hoards. It has already been shown that de Vaux&#x27;s dating system of Qumran and the silver coin hoards was based on what is generally known as a circular argument; the end of the first major settlement period was dated after the assumed date of hiding of the coin hoards, which in turn dated the coin hoards themselves.

Nevertheless, Lönnqvist&#x27;s theories have been criticized by Farhi and Price. They point to the fact that the identity of the silver coins from Qumran held at the Amman Museum in Jordan is not certain.

===Population at Qumran===

One important issue for the understanding of the site of Qumran is a realistic calculation of its population. Using estimates based on the size of the cemetery and average lifespan de Vaux calculated that the inhabitants &quot;would not have numbered many more than 200 members&quot;. He noted that &quot;[t]here is a manifest disproportion between the number of tombs and the number of inhabitants for whom there was room in the buildings&quot;. This led him to speculate whether the caves were used as lodgings for his estimated 200 inhabitants. J.T. Milik some years earlier provided an estimate of between 150 and 200 as the average population, working on the comparison with the population of the monastery of Mar Saba, which numbered 150 monks in the 9th century and from Josephus&#x27; figure of 3,000 Essenes calculating that &quot;at least five per cent lived the strict monastic life&quot;. E.M. Laperrousaz went as high as 1,428 inhabitants. Magen Broshi, analyzing the size of L77 (which he calls an assembly hall), estimated that about 120 to 150 people could sit there, to which he added a few dozen candidates to the population, yielding over 170 people.

From 1983 to 1987 Joseph Patrich carried out archaeological surveys around Qumran and its caves. He concluded that the caves were &quot;stores and hiding places&quot;. He found no traces of permanent tent dwellings and that any &quot;dwelling quarters should be sought inside the wall of Khirbet Qumran, mainly on the upper floor&quot;. Patrich estimated that the population was only 50–70 people. Magen Broshi and Hanan Eshel, revisiting the caves and the territory around Qumran in 1995–1996, later pointed out that Patrich&#x27;s estimate was far too high for what Qumran could offer, reducing the number to 12–20. They turned back to caves (mainly artificial ones cut into the marl terrace most of which have not survived) and tents (pointing to pottery and nails found along one of the paths near Qumran), and staying with 150–200 inhabitants. While waiting for the publication of Broshi and Eshel&#x27;s results, Patrich, anticipating them, doubted the possibility that there were once &quot;significantly more habitable caves&quot; cut into the marl, pointing to the lack of paths and suitable terrain. He went on to discount the significance of the nails for tent dwelling without &quot;further substantial evidence and returned to a figure of &quot;a few tens of residents, fifty at most&quot;. Jodi Magness accepted Broshi&#x27;s estimate, adding &quot;This number accords better than lower estimates with the presence of over 1000 dining dishes in the pantry (L86).&quot;

Working from ratios of populations in other ancient settlements, Yizhar Hirschfeld estimated the population of Qumran thus: &quot;If we use the lower value of fifteen people per dunam [1,000 m2], it emerges that in the Hasmonean period only about 20 people occupied the site of Qumran. Yitzhak Magen and Yuval Peleg entered the discussion commenting on how one could feed such large numbers of community members: &quot;Were we to accept the claim that the sect lived at Qumran for about 170 years, we would expect to find hundreds of cooking and baking ovens as well as thousands of cooking pots.&quot;

The population question is a complex issue, as can be seen by the above considerations. Much hinges on interpretation of two locations at Qumran—the &quot;refectory&quot; and the &quot;pantry&quot;. The search for extramural dwelling quarters has failed to provide substantial evidence. Discounting Laperrousaz&#x27;s apparently excessively high estimate, a number of proposals put the population in and around Qumran at between 20 and 200 people.

==Qumran-Essene hypothesis==

There were not many serious challenges to de Vaux&#x27;s interpretation of the site of Qumran as a settlement of Essenes from the time it was introduced. While the archaeologist E.-M. Laperrousaz had some quite divergent views, members of de Vaux&#x27;s team followed approximately the same narrative, with minor deviations, members including J. T. Milik, and F. M. Cross. De Vaux&#x27;s initial dig co-director, G. Lankester Harding, wrote an article in 1955 where he presented Qumran as &quot;a building in which John the Baptist, and probably Christ, studied: Khirbet Qumran&quot;. Others outside de Vaux&#x27;s team proposed other interpretations, people such as Henri del Medico, Solomon Zeitlin, and G. R. Driver, but their analyses received little lasting attention. More recently, Lawrence H. Schiffman has defended the thesis that the Qumran documents indicate a Sadducean sectarian orientation, but while scholars commonly grant that the term &quot;Essenes&quot; probably included a diversity of groups, the sectarian Sadducean hypothesis remains a minority opinion. Simon J. Joseph agrees that the Qumran community was a part of the Essene movement, under the influence of the Enoch traditions, adding that they possessed a stronger focus towards eschatology and messianism.

In 1960 Karl Heinrich Rengstorf proposed that the Dead Sea Scrolls were not the product of the residents of Qumran, but came from the library of the Jerusalem Temple, despite their being discovered near Qumran. (Rengstorf&#x27;s basic Jerusalem proposal has become increasingly more popular since the materials from de Vaux&#x27;s excavations of Qumran were brought into the public arena in 1992.)

James H. Charlesworth in 1980 proposed that Qumran was damaged in the Parthian war c. 40 BCE.

Jean-Baptiste Humbert, who published de Vaux&#x27;s field notes, proposes a hybrid solution to the debate surrounding Qumran. He accepts that the site might have been originally established as a villa rustica, but that the site was abandoned and that it was reoccupied by Essenes in the late 1st century BCE. Humbert argues that the site may also have been used a place where sectarian pilgrims—barred from entering Jerusalem—may have celebrated the pilgrimage.

Minna Lönnqvist and Kenneth Lönnqvist brought an approach to the Qumran studies based on contextual archaeology with its spatial studies and interpretation of symbolic language of the archaeological data, positing that text scholars, who had only focused their studies on the scrolls, had removed the Dead Sea Scrolls from their archaeological context.

The Lönnqvists proposed that the orientations of the settlement and graves show they both belonged to an intentional scheme based on a solar calendar. From this, they argued that the settlement and cemetery are connected to the Dead Sea Scrolls and associated with an Essene-type group, which finds the closest parallels in the contemporary Jewish Therapeutic group known to have lived in Egypt.

Robert Cargill argues that the theory suggesting Qumran was established as a Hasmonean fortress is not incompatible with the theory proposing that a group of Jewish sectarians reoccupied the site. Cargill suggests that Qumran was established as a Hasmonean fort (see below, &quot;Qumran as fortress&quot;), abandoned, and later reoccupied by Jewish settlers, who expanded the site in a communal, non-military fashion, and who were responsible for the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Some who challenged de Vaux&#x27;s findings took issue with the practice of using the Dead Sea Scrolls to interpret the archaeological remains at Qumran. They argued that these remains should be interpreted independently, without any influence from the Dead Sea Scrolls. Various reinterpretations have led to various conclusions about the site. These include:

===Qumran as fortress===
The overlooked early suggestion that Qumran was a fortress was given new life by the analysis of Pessach Bar-Adon. Using de Vaux&#x27;s Period 1a findings, his own excavations at Ain el-Ghuweir south of Qumran, and Mazar&#x27;s level 2 at &#x27;En-Gedi, Bar-Adon argued, &quot;these fortresses [belonged] to John Hyrcanus, who needed a strong, comprehensive defence system commanding vital water sources, agricultural fields, flocks, Jordan River crossings, the plains of Jericho and the caravan routes in the Judean desert. He turned the Qumran-Ain Feshka oasis, like the one at En-Gedi, into crown property and incorporated his tenants into his strategic plans.&quot;

Norman Golb took up the notion that the Qumran settlement was established as a fortress and argued—against the prevailing views of the time—that not only was Qumran not established as a sectarian residence, but that there were no sectarians at the site at all. Like Rengstorf, he proposed that the Scrolls had been produced in Jerusalem, but unlike Rengstorf, Golb argues that the scrolls came from different libraries throughout Jerusalem and were hidden in the caves by Jews fleeing the Romans during a political uprising.

In 2022, Dennis Mizzi pointed out that the water system at Qumran was constructed in two separate phases, and that the aqueduct was constructed during a later phase (Period Ib). In connection with this, he also points out that, during Period Ia, the Qumran tower had not yet been constructed. He also says that this is indicated in de Vaux’s original plan for Period Ia, although some other scholars disregarded this. According to Mizzi, “there was a stage when the settlement had no tower”, so this would cast doubt on the theory that from the beginning Qumran served as a fortress.

===Qumran as villa===
Robert Donceel and Pauline Donceel-Voûte focused their research on the small finds amongst de Vaux&#x27;s unpublished materials from Qumran, including, but not limited to, glassware (55 newly catalogued items), stoneware (53 new items), metal wares, and coins. Contrary to the belief that the inhabitants of the site were poor monastics, Donceel and Donceel-Voûte suggest that the residents were actually wealthy traders, with connections to the upper class and wealthy in nearby Jerusalem. They ultimately suggest that Qumran was a &quot;villa rustica&quot;, or wealthy manor house that may have been a winter or year-round second home to some wealthy family from Jerusalem. (At the same conference as the Donceel&#x27;s presentation, J. Magness reported that from what she saw of the pottery in the Rockefeller Museum that &quot;there was very, very little in the way of fine wares&quot;. Eric Meyers, next, said &quot;I concur; my visits also corroborate that. I see an affirmative nod from Professor Donceel-Voute.&quot; Rachel Bar-Nathan also notes, &quot;[a]t Jericho, there is also a striking lack of luxury ware, with only a few painted shards in the whole repertoire.&quot;)

===Qumran as commercial center===
While the villa model has gained little support, the evidence that it tried to deal with has led to further attempts at explanation.

Lena Cansdale and Alan Crown argued for the first time that the settlement was a fortified road station and a port town on the shores of the Dead Sea, meaning that the site was actually a prominent commercial site (or &quot;entrepot&quot;) on a major north–south trade route.

Yizhar Hirschfeld accepted that Qumran was originally a Hasmonean fortress. Citing his work at ‘Ein Feshkha as a comparison, he suggested that the site at Qumran ultimately became an agriculturally-based, fortified trading station during the Herodian era.

Yizhak Magen and Yuval Peleg have focused their 10-year excavation at Qumran upon the vast water system at Qumran. They accept that the site was originally a &quot;forward field fort&quot;, but argue that the site was repurposed as a pottery production plant, and that the water system was actually used to bring the clay-laced water into the site. This water was then directed to the pools, where the clay could fall to the bottom. The resulting sediment was then used for the purpose of pottery production, according to these authors. Thus, Y. Magen and Y. Peleg proposed that Qumran was a pottery export site. Their excavations revealed a large amount of clay at the bottom of pool 71, so this was used as part of their argument.

==== Pottery clay analysis ====
Samples of the clay found at Qumran have now been analysed, as well as the composition of various ceramic items. These studies indicate that much of Qumran pottery was not produced at the site. It appears that as much as two thirds of Qumran pottery was not made from Qumran clay.

&quot;This information goes straight against&quot; the Magen Peleg proposal, according to scientists J. Gunneweg and M. Balla. J. Michniewicz responding to previous analyses of Balla and Gunneweg, wrote, &quot;Balla and Gunneweg&#x27;s conclusions are corroborated neither by information about which elements were taken for statistical interpretation and which determined the division particularly strongly... nor by the reference data or statistical computation&quot;.

In 2020, Gunneweg responded to the objections of Michniewicz (as well as those of Joseph Yellin). While admitting the validity of some of critics&#x27; objections, he defended the overall thesis as proposed by him and Balla in several publications.

There appears to be a broad agreement in the research since 2000 that much of the pottery found in Qumran was brought there from other places.

:&quot;While it is not impossible that manufacturers brought clay from outside, the existence of multiple sources of clay (Jerusalem, Jericho, Motza, Beit ‘Ummar, and other unidentified sites) implies that many of the vessels were not locally made.&quot;

Based on Neutron Activation Analysis, Gunneweg and Balla classified the clay used for Qumran pottery in three broad groups. ‘Group I’ was identified as local to Qumran. It contained most of the ceramic items that were certainly made on the site, such as clay balls and oven covers. ‘Group II’ is connected to the areas around Hebron, which is close to the Beit ’Ummar and Motza clay deposits. And ‘Group III’ is localized to the deposits found around Jericho.

===Qumran as part of the Jordan valley===
Rachel Bar-Nathan rejects the claim that dishware found at Qumran shows any sectarian characteristic, and proposes that such pottery has also been found in varying quantities at Masada, Jericho and other sites in the region.

David Stacey argues that the settlement at Qumran is associated with the estate at Jericho. Due to the scarcity of year-round water at Qumran, he suggests that the site served as a seasonal tannery and pottery production facility.

===Other issues===
Recent scientific evidence published by Ira Rabin, Oliver Hahn, Timo Wolff, Admir Masic, and Gisela Weinberg demonstrates that the ink from The Thanksgiving Scroll uses water taken from the Dead Sea and vicinity thereby demonstrating a link between the Dead Sea region and at least some of the scrolls.

Paleographer Ada Yardeni analysed and listed dozens of manuscripts from most of the caves (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 11) that she assigns to a single scribe who she refers to as a &quot;Qumran scribe&quot;. Yardeni cautions against claims of scribal hands being as many as 500 and claims that the manuscripts are a cross-section of then-current literature from many distant libraries, deposited in a short time.

Gila Kahila Bar-Gal determined that some of the skin used for the Dead Sea scrolls came from the Nubian ibex, whose range did not include Jerusalem, but includes Mount Hermon and the Golan Heights, the Negev highlands and the western shore of the Dead Sea.

Some writers have claimed that Israel has invested heavily in the area to establish the Qumran caves as a site of &quot;uniquely Israeli Jewish heritage&quot;.

<doc id="209117" wikidata="Q7972881" url="?curid=209117" title="Wasting">
<text>In medicine, wasting, also known as wasting syndrome, refers to the process by which a debilitating disease causes muscle and fat tissue to &quot;waste&quot; away. Wasting is sometimes referred to as &quot;acute malnutrition&quot; because it is believed that episodes of wasting have a short duration, in contrast to stunting, which is regarded as chronic malnutrition. An estimated 45 million children under 5 years of age (or 6.7%) were wasted in 2021. Prevalence is highest in Southern Asia, followed by Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and South-eastern Asia.

==Causes==
Wasting can be caused by an extremely low energy intake (e.g., caused by famine), nutrient losses due to infection, or a combination of low intake and high loss. Infections and conditions associated with wasting include tuberculosis, chronic diarrhea, AIDS, and superior mesenteric artery syndrome. The mechanism may involve cachectin – also called tumor necrosis factor, a macrophage-secreted cytokine. Caretakers and health providers can sometimes contribute to wasting if the patient is placed on an improper diet. Voluntary weight loss and eating disorders are excluded as causes of wasting.

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===
* Children: Weight-for-height (WFH). In infants under 24 months, recumbent (supine) length is used. WFH as % of median reference value is calculated this way:

:formula_1

Cutoff points may vary, but &lt;80% (close to −2 Z-score) is often used.
* Adults:
** Body Mass Index (BMI) is the quotient between weight and height squared (kg/m2). An individual with a BMI &lt; 18.5 is regarded as a case of wasting.
** Percent of body weight lost (At Tufts, an unintentional loss of 6% or more in 6 months is regarded as wasting)

==Treatment ==
Antiretrovirals and anabolic steroids have been used to treat HIV wasting syndrome. Additionally, an increase in protein-rich foods such as peanut butter and legumes (dried beans and peas) can assist in controlling the loss of muscle mass.

<doc id="209120" wikidata="Q828404" url="?curid=209120" title="Yoho National Park">
<text>Yoho National Park ( ) is a national park of Canada. It is located within the Rocky Mountains along the western slope of the Continental Divide of the Americas in southeastern British Columbia, bordered by Kootenay National Park to the south and Banff National Park to the east in Alberta. The word &quot;Yoho&quot; is a Cree expression of amazement or awe, and it is an apt description for the park&#x27;s spectacular landscape of massive ice fields and mountain peaks, which rank among the highest in the Canadian Rockies.

Yoho covers an area of , the smallest of the region&#x27;s four contiguous national parks, which also include Jasper, Kootenay, and Banff National Parks, as well as three British Columbia provincial parks—Hamber Provincial Park, Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park, and Mount Robson Provincial Park. Together, these parks form the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site. Yoho&#x27;s administrative and visitor centre is in Field, British Columbia, beside the Trans-Canada Highway.

==History==
Yoho National Park is in the traditional territories of the Secwepemc and Ktunaxa First Nations. Before the establishment of the park, the Ktunaxa primarily used the area—specifically, Kicking Horse Pass—to cross the Rockies in order to access bison hunting grounds on the eastern side of the mountains.
The park was created following a trip by Prime Minister John A. Macdonald and his wife Agnes through the Rockies on the newly completed Canadian Pacific Railway, Canada&#x27;s first transcontinental. After his return to Ottawa, Yoho National Park was created on October 10, 1886. Glacier National Park was created on the same day, making Yoho and Glacier the second and third national parks in the country, after Rocky Mountains Park (now named Banff National Park).

The contiguous national parks of Banff, Jasper, Kootenay, and Yoho, as well as the Mount Robson, Mount Assiniboine, and Hamber provincial parks, were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984.

==Fauna==
Common species of animals that roam in this park are the timber wolf, coyote, badger, moose, elk, mule deer, mountain goat, golden-mantled ground squirrel, rufous hummingbird, hoary marmot, wolverine, cougar, pika, lynx, grizzly bear, and black bear.

==Climate==
The weather in the park is localized and changeable. Located on the western side of the continental divide, it receives more precipitation than areas east of the divide. Precipitation in the park increases with elevation. In winter, average temperatures are between from the months November to April although temperatures can range between . The coldest weather usually occurs in the months December to February. In summer, mean temperatures average with an average high of and an average low of . Snowfall and freezing temperatures can occur during the summertime at altitudes above .

==Geology==


The Kicking Horse River, a Canadian Heritage River, originates in the Wapta and Waputik icefields in the park. This river has created a natural bridge through solid rock. This formation is located west of Field, accessible from the road to Emerald Lake.

The Canadian Rockies consist of sedimentary rock, with numerous fossil deposits. In particular, the Burgess Shale, in Yoho National Park, has among the world&#x27;s richest deposits of rare fossils. The Burgess Shale was discovered in 1909 by Charles Doolittle Walcott. In the southeastern corner of the park is an igneous intrusion known as the Ice River Complex containing deposits of sodalite, an ornamental stone.

<text>In calculus, the quotient rule is a method of finding the derivative of a function that is the ratio of two differentiable functions. Let formula_1, where both and are differentiable and formula_2 The quotient rule states that the derivative of is
:formula_3

It is provable in many ways by using other derivative rules.

==Examples==

=== Example 1: Basic example ===

Given formula_4, let formula_5, then using the quotient rule:formula_6

=== Example 2: Derivative of tangent function ===

The quotient rule can be used to find the derivative of formula_7 as follows:
formula_8

== Reciprocal rule ==

The reciprocal rule is a special case of the quotient rule in which the numerator formula_9. Applying the quotient rule givesformula_10

Utilizing the chain rule yields the same result.

==Proofs==
===Proof from derivative definition and limit properties===
Let formula_11 Applying the definition of the derivative and properties of limits gives the following proof, with the term formula_12 added and subtracted to allow splitting and factoring in subsequent steps without affecting the value:formula_13The limit evaluation formula_14 is justified by the differentiability of formula_15, implying continuity, which can be expressed as formula_16.

===Proof using implicit differentiation===
Let formula_17 so that formula_18

The product rule then gives formula_19

Solving for formula_20 and substituting back for formula_21 gives:
formula_22

===Proof using the reciprocal rule or chain rule===
Let formula_23

Then the product rule gives formula_24

To evaluate the derivative in the second term, apply the reciprocal rule, or the power rule along with the chain rule:
formula_25

Substituting the result into the expression givesformula_26

=== Proof by logarithmic differentiation ===
Let formula_27 Taking the absolute value and natural logarithm of both sides of the equation gives
formula_28

Applying properties of the absolute value and logarithms,
formula_29

Taking the logarithmic derivative of both sides,
formula_30 

Solving for formula_20 and substituting back formula_32 for formula_21 gives:
formula_34

Taking the absolute value of the functions is necessary for the logarithmic differentiation of functions that may have negative values, as logarithms are only real-valued for positive arguments. This works because formula_35, which justifies taking the absolute value of the functions for logarithmic differentiation.

==Higher order derivatives==
Implicit differentiation can be used to compute the th derivative of a quotient (partially in terms of its first derivatives). For example, differentiating formula_36 twice (resulting in formula_37) and then solving for formula_38 yieldsformula_39

<text>Jasper National Park, in Alberta, Canada, is the largest national park within Alberta&#x27;s Rocky Mountains, spanning . It was established as Jasper Forest Park in 1907, renamed as a national park in 1930, and declared a UNESCO world heritage site in 1984. Its location is north of Banff National Park and west of Edmonton. The park contains the glaciers of the Columbia Icefield, springs, lakes, waterfalls and mountains.

== History ==

=== First Nations ===
The territory encompassed by what is now Jasper National Park has been inhabited since time immemorial by Nakoda, Cree, Secwépemc, and Dane-zaa peoples. Plainview projectile points have been found at the head of Jasper Lake, dating back to between 8000 and 7000 BCE. In the centuries between then and the establishment of the park, First Nations land use has fluctuated according to climatic variations over the long term, and according to cyclical patterns of ungulate population numbers, particularly elk, moose, mule deer, and occasionally caribou. Starting in the 1790s, Haudenosaunee and Nipissing hunters and trappers moved in large numbers to the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, around the headwaters of the Athabasca and Smoky Rivers in particular, most of them employed by the North West Company. By the time David Thompson crossed the Athabasca Pass in 1810, led by a Haudenosaunee guide named Thomas, there were hundreds of Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabe people living in the region. When Mary Schäffer Warren became the first settler to visit Maligne Lake—known by the Nakoda as —in 1908, she did so by following a map given to her by Samson Beaver, a Nakoda guide and hunter.

=== Fur trade ===
Jasper National Park&#x27;s name originates from Jasper Haws, a Maryland-born fur trader who worked for the North West Company. In 1815, Haws took command of a North West Company trading post, built on Brûlé Lake in 1813, which subsequently became known as Jasper&#x27;s House. In 1830, the trading post was relocated further up the Athabasca River, just north of Jasper Lake. The site of Jasper House itself was designated a national historic site in 1924.

Jasper House was destroyed in 1910, but it gave its name to both the national park, and the town of Jasper within the Park.

=== Jasper Park established ===

Jasper Forest Park was established by a federal order in council on September 14, 1907. The park&#x27;s establishment was spurred by plans for the construction of additional Canadian transcontinental railways built through Edmonton, the Canadian Northern Railway and Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, which were to cross the Rocky Mountains at Yellowhead Pass. Jasper Park was intended to be developed into an alpine resort similar to Banff National Park, at the time known as Rocky Mountains Park, with a train station, tourist hotels, and a service town. Jasper Park was intended to occupy the same position to the railways that Banff National Park already had to the Canadian Pacific Railway. Collectively, the mountain parks were intended as a sort of wilderness playground for middle-class workers, an antidote to the malaise of modern life. 

However, the vision of wilderness on which Japer Park&#x27;s development plan depended was at odds with the presence of long-established Métis homesteads within the park, many of whom were descended from the white and Haudenosaunee fur traders and trappers employed by the North West Company and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in the 19th century. In 1909, six Métis families living in Jasper Park were declared squatters, paid compensation for improvements made to the land, including buildings, ditches, and fences, and ordered to leave the park.

In 1911, Jasper Forest Park came under the administration of the newly established Dominion Parks Branch of the Department of the Interior, under the purview of James Bernard Harkin, at which time the name was changed to simply Jasper Park. Under Harkin, Canada&#x27;s national parks were to fulfill a dual mandate of wilderness protection and economic development—primarily as tourist destinations. In particular, the Parks Branch expressly forbade hunting in Jasper and the other mountain parks, deprecating First Nations&#x27; centuries-long history of subsistence hunting in the region as indiscriminate slaughter of the local game wildlife. Despite the prohibition on hunting, the park and its tourist facilities became a base of operations for wealthy Canadian and American sport hunters for hunting trips further into the Rockies, beyond the prohibitions in place in the mountain parks and the Rocky Mountains Forest Reserve.

In 1930, Jasper Forest Park officially became Jasper National Park with the passing of the &quot;National Parks Act&quot;. Section 4 of the act further underlined the park&#x27;s wilderness preservation function, with Canada&#x27;s National Parks &quot;dedicated to the people of Canada for their benefit, education and enjoyment&quot; and &quot;maintained and made use of so as to leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.&quot; Ironically, given the mandate its mandate to preserve natural spaces, the act also redefined Jasper Park&#x27;s boundaries, removing of land from the park—including Brûlé Lake and Rock Lake—opening the excised area to coal mining and hydroelectric development.

=== Early tourism and sport ===
In 1911, the Grand Trunk Pacific (GTP) laid track through the park and over Yellowhead Pass. That same year, the GTP founded the town of Fitzhugh around the company&#x27;s railway station; the town was renamed Jasper in 1913. The GTP&#x27;s route across the pass was followed in 1913 by the Canadian Northern (CNoR). Both having both fallen into financial difficulty, the two railways were nationalized—the CNoR in 1919 and the GTP in 1923—and eventually merged into the Canadian National Railway (CNR) by an order in council. The railway was later followed by a road built between Edmonton and Jasper. The section between the town of Jasper and the eastern gate of the park was completed in 1928; however, it took another three years for the province of Alberta to complete the remaining stretch of the road into Edmonton.

By the time the GTP&#x27;s railway track cleared Yellowhead Pass in 1911, there were already eight hotels established in Jasper, but they were rudimentary, and did not meet the expectations of the well-heeled clientele to which the GTP advertised. Jasper Park Lodge, the focal point of the GTP&#x27;s Jasper advertising campaign, did not open until 1922, three years after the company&#x27;s bankruptcy and only a year before the railway was merged into the nationally owned CNR. Like the GTP before it, Canadian National featured both Jasper park and the lodge prominently in its advertising literature.

From its founding, the town of Jasper, and later the Jasper Park Lodge, served as a hub for a variety of outdoor sporting activities. Even as Mary Schäffer Warren was becoming the first settler to visit Maligne Lake, outfitters were springing up in the park to rent out equipment and guide hikers and alpinists. The Alpine Club of Canada, formed in 1906 and sponsored through the 1920s in part by the CNR, held seven of its annual alpine camps in Jasper between 1926 and 1950. And while hunting was forbidden within park grounds, the park&#x27;s facilities served as a base of operations for outfitters and guides who led wealthy hunters on hunting trips into the forest reserves outside Jasper&#x27;s boundaries.

=== Internment camps ===

In 1916, following the precedent set at Rocky Mountains Park, the Government of Canada opened an internment camp for individuals deemed enemy aliens, primarily immigrants from the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, including Ukrainians, who made up the largest affected population, and the Ottoman Empire. The interned men were primarily employed in the construction of a road from the town of Jasper, along the Maligne River first to Medicine Lake, and later on to Maligne Lake.

In 1931, in response to the Great Depression, the government of Prime Minister R. B. Bennett enacted the &quot;Unemployment and Farm Relief Act&quot;, which allocated funds for public works projects in the national parks. Labourers, many of them laid-off Canadian National Railway workers, were employed on road and bridge projects within the park, for which they were paid 25 to 30 cents per hour, working eight hours a day up to six days per week. In October, 1931, under the auspices of the relief project, construction started on a road between Jasper and Banff, which ultimately formed the basis for the Icefields Parkway.

Internment camps were established again during World War II, when three hundred Japanese Canadians were forcibly sent to three road camps in Jasper. Additionally, 160 conscientious objectors, many of them Mennonites from the Prairie provinces, were interned at Jasper and put to work upgrading the Maligne Lake and Medicine Lake roads, as well as building a road from Geikie to the British Columbia border.

===Conservation and recent history===
In 1984, Jasper, Banff, Kootenay, Yoho, as well as the Hamber, Mount Robson, Mount Assiniboine provincial parks, were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Since 1999, the arrival of the mountain pine beetle has impacted the park with 93,000 hectares of the park&#x27;s forest infested with the beetle by 2017. In 2016, Parks Canada released the &quot;Mountain Pine Beetle Management Plan&quot; which includes prescribed burns and removal of infected trees to reduce the fire risk and to prevent the beetles from spreading into provincial land.

In 2011, the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada designated Jasper National Park as a dark-sky preserve due to its minimal light pollution and ideal conditions for dark sky viewing.

In 2024, a wildfire destroyed a significant part of the town of Jasper and its surrounding area.

== World Heritage Site ==
The park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984, together with the other national and provincial parks that form the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, for the mountain landscapes containing mountain peaks, glaciers, lakes, waterfalls, canyons, and limestone caves as well as fossils found here.

== Geography ==
=== Hydrology ===
Most of the park&#x27;s area forms the headwaters of the Athabasca River, which originates in the parks extreme southernmost point at an unnamed lake unofficially known as Columbia Lake due to it being fed by one of the Columbia Icefield&#x27;s many outlet glaciers. Despite its misleading name, the well-known Athabasca Glacier is actually the source of the Sunwapta River, a tributary of the Athabasca, not the main river itself. Other major tributaries of the Athabasca River that drain large areas of the park include the Maligne River, the Snake Indian River, Rocky River and the Miette River. The northernmost area of the park is drained separately by the Smoky River. Both the Smoky and Athabasca Rivers form part of the Mackenzie River drainage, the largest river system in Canada, which itself is part of the Arctic Ocean basin. The southeast section of the park is drained by the Brazeau River which is part of the Saskatchewan/Nelson River system which ultimately flows into Hudson Bay.

The park is coextensive with the province of Alberta&#x27;s Improvement District No. 12.

== Attractions ==

=== Front country ===
Attractions that can easily be reached by road include the Mount Edith Cavell hiking area, Maligne Lake (which features hiking and boating opportunities), Maligne Canyon, Miette Hot Springs, Pyramid Lake, the Jasper Skytram and the Athabasca Glacier, (an outlet glacier of the Columbia Icefield which features snow coach tours). The Marmot Basin ski area is the most popular winter attraction in the park.

Common summer recreational activities in the park include hiking, fishing, mountain biking (in select areas), wildlife viewing, rafting, kayaking and camping. Winter activities include Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. Some companies offer dog sled tours in the park.

=== Back country ===
Only a small fraction of the parks area is road accessible. The rest forms a large backcountry area which is largely only accessible by trail. Large areas of the backcountry are rarely visited as many areas&#x27; trails are poorly maintained or non existent. Access into the backcountry is most often accomplished by backpacking or horseback and in rare cases kayak or raft. Popular backcountry trips include the Tonquin Valley, the Skyline Trail, Jones Pass, Jacques Lake and the Fryatt Valley. The remote North Boundary Trail which provided access to the north half of the park is a multiweek backpacking trip. Canoe and kayaking access to the backcountry can be achieved on Maligne Lake.

=== Road network ===
The park contains several major roads, most of which are intended to be scenic routes that provide access to all of the park&#x27;s front-country attractions. Since a good sample of parks scenery and wildlife can be viewed from the roads themselves, driving them is considered a core part of the park experience.

Highway 16 (part of the Trans-Canada Highway and Yellowhead Highway systems) is the main route through the park and is the only major east–west corridor crossing the mountains in that area. It serves as both an important trade and travel corridor for through traffic and a tourist route allowing visitors to access and view many of the park&#x27;s attractions.

The Icefields Parkway (also known as Highway 93) is a highway in length running from Lake Louise, Alberta, in Banff National Park, to Jasper, Alberta, where it meets Highway 16. The scenic highway runs parallel to the continental divide, providing motor and cycle access to the heart of the Canadian Rockies and is considered to one of the park&#x27;s main attractions. Along its length the parkway has many viewpoints, tourist attractions, hikes and campgrounds. The Athabasca and Sunwapta Falls are both accessible by the road. In May 2014, Glacier Sky Walk opened to the public. It is glass-floored observation platform over the Sunwapta Valley. Unlike Highway 16, the Icefields Parkway is strictly a tourist route, and all freight traffic is prohibited from using the road. All users must have a parks pass.

Maligne Lake Road is a scenic park road that is in length and runs from Highway 16 near Jasper to Maligne Lake roughly following the course of the Maligne River. It is the park&#x27;s other major tourist road (besides the Icefields Parkway). It is not as well known as the Icefields Parkway, but provides several viewpoints and access to hiking routes such as the Maligne Canyon trails. The road has a speed limit of due to frequent wildlife.

Edith Cavell Road is a scenic park road that provides access to the Edith Cavell meadow area from the Icefields Parkway. This road is open only between May and October, and RVs are prohibited due to its tight switchback corners.

Miette Hot Springs Road is a scenic park road that runs from Highway 16 to the Miette Hot Springs, one of the parks core attractions.

Alberta Highway 93A is a parallel road to the Icefields Parkway that provides access to several hikes, campgrounds and the Marmot Basin Ski Resort.

Marmot Basin Road provides access to the Marmot Basin Ski Area and several trailheads from Highway 93A.

Celestine Lake Road is a long gravel road that runs along the north bank of the Athabasca River providing access to several remote trailheads.

Pyramid Lake Road is a short road that provides tourists access to the several lakes and resorts just north of Jasper.

==Climate==
==General management==
Jasper National Park is managed by Parks Canada under the &quot;National Parks Act&quot;. On a provincial level, the park area outside of Municipality of Jasper is administered by Alberta Municipal Affairs as &quot;Improvement District No. 12 (Jasper National Park)&quot;. The Municipality of Jasper was formed by the Government of Alberta in 2001 and has its own local government.

== In popular culture ==

Jasper National Park is featured in the 2010 3D animated comedy-drama film &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot; as the location the two wolf protagonists are taken from and struggle to return to.

A KLM Boeing 777-300 is named after Jasper National Park.

<text>Banff National Park is Canada&#x27;s first national park, established in 1885 as Rocky Mountains Park. Located in Alberta&#x27;s Rocky Mountains, west of Calgary, Banff encompasses of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes. Provincial forests and Yoho National Park are neighbours to the west, while Kootenay National Park is located to the south and Kananaskis Country to the southeast. The main commercial centre of the park is the town of Banff, in the Bow River valley.
The Canadian Pacific Railway was instrumental in Banff&#x27;s early years, building the Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau Lake Louise, and attracting tourists through extensive advertising. In the early 20th century, roads were built in Banff, at times by war internees from World War I, and through Great Depression-era public works projects. The Icefields Parkway extends from Lake Louise, connecting to Jasper National Park in the north.

Since the 1960s, park accommodations have been open all year, with annual tourism visits to Banff increasing to over 5 million in the 1990s. Millions more pass through the park on the Trans-Canada Highway. As Banff has over three million visitors annually, the health of its ecosystem has been threatened. In the mid-1990s, Parks Canada responded by initiating a two-year study which resulted in management recommendations and new policies that aim to preserve ecological integrity.

Banff National Park has a subarctic climate with three ecoregions, including montane, subalpine, and alpine. The forests are dominated by Lodgepole pine at lower elevations and Engelmann spruce in higher ones below the treeline, above which is primarily rocks and ice. Mammal species such as the grizzly bear, cougar, wolverine, elk, bighorn sheep and moose are found, along with hundreds of bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are also found but only a limited number of species have been recorded.

The mountains are formed from sedimentary rocks which were pushed east over newer rock strata, between 80 and 55 million years ago. Over the past few million years, glaciers have at times covered most of the park, but today are found only on the mountain slopes though they include the Columbia Icefield, the largest uninterrupted glacial mass in the Rockies. Erosion from water and ice have carved the mountains into their current shapes.

== History ==

Throughout its history, Banff National Park has been shaped by tension between conservationist and land exploitation interests. The park was established on November 25, 1885, as Banff Hot Springs Reserve, in response to conflicting claims over who discovered hot springs there and who had the right to develop the hot springs for commercial interests. The conservationists prevailed when Prime Minister John A. Macdonald set aside the hot springs as a small protected reserve, which was later expanded to include Lake Louise and other areas extending north to the Columbia Icefield.

=== Indigenous peoples ===
Archaeological evidence found at Vermilion Lakes indicates the first human activity in Banff to 10,300 BP. Prior to European contact, the area that is now Banff National Park was home to many Indigenous Peoples, including the Stoney Nakoda, Ktunaxa, Tsuut&#x27;ina, Kainaiwa, Piikani, Siksika, and Plains Cree. Indigenous Peoples utilized the area to hunt, fish, trade, travel, survey and practice culture. Many areas within Banff National Park are still known by their Stoney Nakoda names such as Lake Minnewanka and the Waputik Range. Cave and Basin served as an important cultural and spiritual site for the Stoney Nakoda.

With the admission of British Columbia to Canada on July 20, 1871, Canada agreed to build a transcontinental railroad. Construction of the railroad began in 1875, with Kicking Horse Pass chosen, over the more northerly Yellowhead Pass, as the route through the Canadian Rockies. Ten years later, on November 7, 1885, the last spike was driven in Craigellachie, British Columbia.

=== Rocky Mountains Park established ===
With conflicting claims over the discovery of hot springs in Banff, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald decided to set aside a small reserve of around the hot springs at Cave and Basin as a public park known as the &quot;Banff Hot Springs Reserve&quot; in 1885. Under the &quot;Rocky Mountains Park Act&quot;, enacted on June 23, 1887, the park was expanded to and named &quot;Rocky Mountains Park&quot;. This was Canada&#x27;s first national park, and the third established in North America, after Yellowstone and Mackinac National Parks. The Canadian Pacific Railway built the Banff Springs Hotel and Lake Louise Chalet to attract tourists and increase the number of rail passengers.

The Stoney Nakoda First Nation were removed from Banff National Park between the years 1890 and 1920. The park was designed to appeal to sportsmen, and tourists. The exclusionary policy met the goals of sports hunting, tourism, and game conservation, as well as of those attempting to &quot;civilize&quot; the First Nations of the area.

Early on, Banff was popular with wealthy European and American tourists, the former of which arrived in Canada via trans-Atlantic luxury liner and continued westward on the railroad. Some visitors participated in mountaineering activities, often hiring local guides. Guides Jim and Bill Brewster founded one of the first outfitters in Banff. From 1906, the Alpine Club of Canada organized climbs, hikes and camps in the park.

By 1911, Banff was accessible by automobile from Calgary. Beginning in 1916, the Brewsters offered motorcoach tours of Banff. In 1920, access to Lake Louise by road was available, and the Banff-Windermere Road opened in 1923 to connect Banff with British Columbia.
In 1902, the park was expanded to cover , encompassing areas around Lake Louise, and the Bow, Red Deer, Kananaskis, and Spray rivers. Bowing to pressure from grazing and logging interests, the size of the park was reduced in 1911 to , eliminating many eastern foothills areas from the park. Park boundaries changed several more times up until 1930, when the area of Banff was fixed at , with the passage of the &quot;National Parks Act&quot;. The act, which took effect May 30, 1930, also renamed the park &quot;Banff National Park&quot;, named for the Canadian Pacific Railway station, which in turn was named after the Banffshire region in Scotland. With the construction of a new east gate in 1933, Alberta transferred to the park. This, along with other minor changes in the park boundaries in 1949, set the area of the park at .

=== Coal mining ===
In 1877, the First Nations of the area signed Treaty 7, which gave Canada rights to explore the land for resources. At the beginning of the 20th century, coal was mined near Lake Minnewanka in Banff. For a brief period, a mine operated at Anthracite but was shut down in 1904. The Bankhead mine, at Cascade Mountain, was operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway from 1903 to 1922. In 1926, the town was dismantled, with many buildings moved to the town of Banff and elsewhere.

=== Internment and work camps ===
During World War I, immigrants from Austria-Hungary and Germany were sent to Banff to work in internment camps. The main camp was at Castle Mountain, and was moved to Cave and Basin during winter. Much early infrastructure and road construction was done by men of various Slavic origins although Ukrainians constituted a majority of those held in Banff. Historical plaques and a statue erected by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association commemorate those interned at Castle Mountain, and at Cave and Basin National Historic Site where an interpretive pavilion dealing with Canada&#x27;s first national internment operations opened in September 2013.
In 1931, the Government of Canada enacted the &quot;Unemployment and Farm Relief Act&quot; which provided public works projects in the national parks during the Great Depression. In Banff, workers constructed a new bathhouse and pool at Upper Hot Springs, to supplement Cave and Basin. Other projects involved road building in the park, tasks around the Banff townsite and construction of a highway connecting Banff and Jasper. In 1934, the&quot; Public Works Construction Act&quot; was passed, providing continued funding for the public works projects. New projects included construction of a new registration facility at Banff&#x27;s east gate and construction of an administrative building in Banff. By 1940, the Icefields Parkway reached the Columbia Icefield area of Banff and connected Banff and Jasper. Most of the infrastructure present in the national park dates from public work projects enacted during the Great Depression.

Alternative service camps for conscientious objectors were set up in Banff during World War II, with camps at Lake Louise, Stoney Creek, and Healy Creek. These camps were largely populated by Mennonites from Saskatchewan.

=== Winter tourism ===
Winter tourism in Banff began in February 1917, with the first Banff Winter Carnival. It was marketed to a regional middle class audience, and became the centerpiece of local boosters aiming to attract visitors, which were a low priority for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The carnival featured a large ice palace, which in 1917 was built by World War I internees. Carnival events included cross-country skiing, ski jumping, curling, snowshoe, and skijoring. In the 1930s, the first downhill ski resort, Sunshine Village, was developed by the Brewsters. Mount Norquay ski area was also developed during the 1930s, with the first chair lift installed there in 1948.

Since 1968, when the Banff Springs Hotel was winterized, Banff has been a year-round destination. In the 1950s, the Trans-Canada Highway was constructed, providing another transportation corridor through the Bow Valley, making the park more accessible.

Canada launched several bids to host the Winter Olympics in Banff, with the first bid for the 1964 Winter Olympics, which were eventually awarded to Innsbruck, Austria. Canada narrowly lost a second bid, for the 1968 Winter Olympics, which were awarded to Grenoble, France. Once again, Banff launched a bid to host the 1972 Winter Olympics, with plans to hold the Olympics at Lake Louise. The 1972 bid was controversial, as environmental lobby groups strongly opposed the bid, which had sponsorship from Imperial Oil. Bowing to pressure, Jean Chrétien, then the Minister of Environment, the government department responsible for Parks Canada, withdrew support for the bid, which was eventually lost to Sapporo, Japan. When nearby Calgary hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics, the cross-country ski events were held at the Canmore Nordic Centre Provincial Park at Canmore, Alberta, located just outside the eastern gates of Banff National Park on the Trans-Canada Highway.

=== Conservation ===
Since the original Rocky Mountains Park Act, subsequent acts and policies placed greater emphasis on conservation. With public sentiment tending towards environmentalism, Parks Canada issued major new policy in 1979, which emphasized conservation. The &quot;National Parks Act&quot; was amended in 1988, which made preserving ecological integrity the first priority in all park management decisions. The act also required each park to produce a management plan, with greater public participation.

In 1984, Banff was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site, together with the other national and provincial parks that form the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, for the mountain landscapes containing mountain peaks, glaciers, lakes, waterfalls, canyons and limestone caves as well as fossil beds. With this designation came added obligations for conservation.
During the 1980s, Parks Canada moved to privatize many park services such as golf courses, and added user fees for use of other facilities and services to help deal with budget cuts. In 1990, the town of Banff was incorporated, giving local residents more say regarding any proposed developments.

In the 1990s, development plans for the park, including expansion at Sunshine Village, were under fire with lawsuits filed by Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS). In the mid-1990s, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was initiated to find ways to better address environmental concerns, and issues relating to development in the park.

== Geography ==

Banff National Park is in the Rocky Mountains on Alberta&#x27;s western border with British Columbia in the Alberta Mountain forests ecoregion. By road, the town of Banff is west of Calgary and southwest of Edmonton. Jasper National Park borders Banff National Park to the north, while Yoho National Park is to the west and Kootenay National Park is to the south. Kananaskis Country, which includes Bow Valley Wildland Provincial Park, Spray Valley Provincial Park, and Peter Lougheed Provincial Park, is located to the south and east of Banff.
The Trans-Canada Highway passes through Banff National Park, from the eastern boundary near Canmore, through the towns of Banff and Lake Louise, and into Yoho National Park in British Columbia. The Banff townsite is the main commercial centre in the national park. The village of Lake Louise is at the junction of the Trans-Canada Highway and the Icefields Parkway, which extends north to the Jasper townsite.

=== Banff ===

Banff, established in 1885, is the main commercial centre in Banff National Park, as well as a centre for cultural activities. Banff is home to several cultural institutions, including the Banff Centre, the Whyte Museum, the Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum, Cave and Basin National Historic Site, and several art galleries. Throughout its history, Banff has hosted many annual events, including Banff Indian Days which began in 1889, and the Banff Winter Carnival. Since 1976, The Banff Centre has organized the Banff Mountain Film Festival. In 1990, Banff incorporated as a town of Alberta, though still subject to the &quot;National Parks Act&quot; and federal authority in regards to planning and development. In its 2014 census, the town of Banff had a permanent population of 8,421 as well as 965 non-permanent residents for a total population of 9,386. The Bow River flows through the town of Banff, with the Bow Falls on the outskirts of town.

=== Lake Louise ===
Lake Louise, a hamlet northwest of the town of Banff, is home to the landmark Chateau Lake Louise at the edge of Lake Louise. Located from Lake Louise, Moraine Lake provides a scenic vista of the Valley of the Ten Peaks. This scene is on the back of the Canadian $20 bill in the 1969–1979 (&quot;Scenes of Canada&quot;) series. The Lake Louise Mountain Resort is also near the village. Lake Louise is one of the most visited lakes in the world and is framed to the southwest by the Mount Victoria Glacier.

=== Icefields Parkway ===

The Icefields Parkway is a road connecting Lake Louise to Jasper, Alberta. The Parkway originates at Lake Louise, and extends north up the Bow Valley, past Hector Lake, which is the largest natural lake in the park. Other scenic lakes near the parkway include Bow Lake, and Peyto Lakes, both north of Hector Lake. The Parkway then crosses Bow Summit (), and follows the Mistaya River to Saskatchewan Crossing, where it converges with the Howse and North Saskatchewan River. Bow Summit is the highest elevation crossed by a public road in Canada.

The North Saskatchewan River flows east from Saskatchewan Crossing, out of Banff, into what is known as David Thompson Country, and onto Edmonton. The David Thompson Highway follows the North Saskatchewan River, past the man-made Abraham Lake, and through David Thompson Country.

North of Saskatchewan Crossing, the Icefields Parkway follows the North Saskatchewan River up to the Columbia Icefield. The Parkway crosses into Jasper National Park at Sunwapta Pass at in elevation, and continues on from there to the Jasper townsite.

== Geology ==
The Canadian Rockies consist of several northwest–southeast trending ranges. Two main mountain ranges are within the park, each consisting of numerous subranges. The western border of the park follows the crest of the Main Ranges (also known as the &quot;Park Ranges&quot;), which is also the continental divide. The Main Ranges in Banff National Park include from north to south, the Waputik, Bow and Blue Ranges. The high peaks west of Lake Louise are part of the Bow Range. The eastern border of the park includes all of the Front Ranges consisting of from north to south, the Palliser, Sawback and Sundance Ranges. The Banff townsite is in the Front Ranges. Just outside the park to the east lie the foothills that extend from Canmore at the eastern entrance of the park eastward into the Great Plains. Well west of the park, the Western Ranges of the Rockies pass through Yoho and Kootenay National Parks. Though the tallest peak entirely within the park is Mount Forbes at , Mount Assiniboine on the Banff-Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park border is slightly higher at .

The Canadian Rockies are composed of sedimentary rock, including shale, sandstone, dolomite and limestone. The vast majority of geologic formations in Banff range in age from Precambrian to the Jurassic periods (600–145 m.y.a.). However, rocks as young as the lower Cretaceous (145–66 m.y.a.) can be found near the east entrance and on Cascade Mountain above the Banff townsite. These sedimentary rocks formed at the bottom of shallow seas between 600 and 175 m.y.a. and were pushed east during the Laramide orogeny. Mountain building in Banff National Park ended approximately 55 m.y.a.

The Canadian Rockies may have risen up to approximately 70 m.y.a. Once mountain formation ceased, erosion carved the mountains into their present rugged shape. The erosion was first due to water, then was greatly accelerated by the Quaternary glaciation 2.5 million years ago. Glacial landforms dominate Banff&#x27;s geomorphology, with examples of all classic glacial forms, including cirques, arêtes, hanging valleys, moraines, and U-shaped valleys. The pre-existing structure left over from mountain-building strongly guided glacial erosion: mountains in Banff include complex, irregular, anticlinal, synclinal, castellate, dogtooth, and sawback mountains.

Many of the mountain ranges trend northwest to southeast, with sedimentary layering dipping down to the west at 40–60 degrees. This leads to dip slope landforms, with generally steeper east and north faces, and trellis drainage, where rivers and old glacial valleys followed the weaker layers in the rocks as they were relatively easily weathered and eroded.
Classic examples are found at the Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just to the north of the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.

=== Glaciers and icefields ===

Banff National Park has numerous large glaciers and icefields, 100 of which can be observed from the Icefields Parkway. Small cirque glaciers are fairly common in the Main Ranges, in depressions on the side of many mountains. As with the majority of mountain glaciers around the world, the glaciers in Banff are retreating. While Peyto Glacier is one of the longest continuously studied glaciers in the world, with research extending back to the 1970s, most of the glaciers of the Canadian Rockies have only been scientifically evaluated since the late 1990s. Glaciologists are now researching the glaciers in the park more thoroughly, and have been analyzing the impact that reduced glacier ice may have on water supplies to streams and rivers. Estimates are that 150 glaciers disappeared in the Canadian Rockies (areas both inside and outside Banff National Park) between the years 1920 and 1985. Another 150 glaciers disappeared between 1985 and 2005, indicating that the retreat and disappearance of glaciers is accelerating. In Banff National Park alone, in 1985 there were 365 glaciers but by 2005, 29 glaciers had disappeared. The total glaciated area dropped from in that time period.

The largest glaciated areas include the Waputik and Wapta Icefields, which both lie on the Banff-Yoho National Park border. Wapta Icefield covers approximately in area. Outlets of Wapta Icefield on the Banff side of the continental divide include Peyto, Bow, and Vulture Glaciers. Bow Glacier retreated an estimated between the years 1850 and 1953, and since that period, there has been further retreat which has left a newly formed lake at the terminal moraine. Peyto Glacier has lost 70 percent of its volume since record keeping began and has retreated approximately since 1880; the glacier is at risk of disappearing entirely within the next 30 to 40 years.

The Columbia Icefield, at the northern end of Banff, straddles the Banff and Jasper National Park border and extends into British Columbia. Snow Dome, in the Columbia Icefield is a hydrological apex of North America, with water flowing via outlet glaciers to the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans. Saskatchewan Glacier, which is approximately in length and in area, is the major outlet of the Columbia Icefield that flows into Banff National Park. Between the years 1893 and 1953, Saskatchewan Glacier had retreated a distance of , with the rate of retreat between the years 1948 and 1953 averaging per year. Overall, the glaciers of the Canadian Rockies lost 25 percent of their mass during the 20th century.

== Climate ==

Under the Köppen climate classification, the park has a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;) with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. The climate is influenced by altitude with lower temperatures generally found at higher elevations. Located on the eastern side of the Continental Divide, Banff National Park receives of precipitation annually. This is considerably less than in Yoho National Park on the western side of the divide in British Columbia, where (1971-1990 normals) is received at Wapta Lake and approximately at Boulder Creek annually. Being influenced by altitude, snowfall is also greater at higher elevations. As such, (1991–2020 normals) of snow falls on average each year in the Banff townsite, while (1981-2010 normals) falls in Lake Louise, which is at a higher altitude, .

During winter months, temperatures in Banff are moderated, compared to other areas of central and northern Alberta, due to Chinook winds and other influences from British Columbia. The mean low temperature during January is , and the mean high temperature is for the town of Banff. However, temperatures can drop below with wind chill values dropping below -30 for 3.5 days in an average year. Weather conditions during summer months are warm, with high temperatures during July averaging , and daily low temperatures averaging , leading to a large diurnal range owing to the relative dryness of the air.

== Ecology ==
=== Ecoregions ===

Banff National Park spans three ecoregions, including montane, subalpine, and alpine. The subalpine ecoregion, which consists mainly of dense forest, comprises 53 percent of Banff&#x27;s area. 27 percent of the park is located above the tree line, in the alpine ecoregion. The tree line in Banff lies approximately at , with open meadows at alpine regions and some areas covered by glaciers. A small portion (3 percent) of the park, at lower elevations, is in the montane ecoregion. Lodgepole pine forests dominate the montane region of Banff, with Engelmann spruce, willow, aspen, occasional Douglas-fir and a few Douglas maple interspersed. Engelmann spruce are more common in the subalpine regions of Banff, with some areas of lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir. The montane areas in the Bow Valley, which tend to be the preferred habitat for wildlife, have been subjected to significant human development over the years.

=== Wildlife ===

The park has 56 recorded mammal species. Grizzly bears and black bears inhabit the forested regions. Cougar, lynx, wolverine, red fox, weasel, river otter, coyote, and timber wolf are the primary predatory mammals. Elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are common in the valleys of the park, including around (and sometimes in) the Banff townsite, while moose tend to be more elusive, sticking primarily to wetland areas and near streams. In the alpine regions, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, marmot and pika are widespread. Other mammals such as beaver, porcupine, squirrel, chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and Columbian ground squirrel are the more commonly observed smaller mammals. Caribou were the rarest large mammals in the park, but an avalanche in 2009 may have killed the last five remaining within park boundaries. The American bison was extirpated in Banff, but was brought back to the park in 2017, and one free-roaming herd lives within the protected area.

Due to the harsh winters, the park has few reptile and amphibian species with only one species of toad, three species of frog, one salamander species and two species of snakes that have been identified. At least 280 species of birds can be found in Banff including bald and golden eagles, red-tailed hawk, osprey, and merlin, all of which are predatory species. Additionally, commonly seen species such as the Canada jay, American three-toed woodpecker, mountain bluebird, Clark&#x27;s nutcracker, mountain chickadee and pipit are frequently found in the lower elevations. The white-tailed ptarmigan is a ground bird that is often seen in the alpine zones. Rivers and lakes are frequented by over a hundred different species including loon, heron and mallard which spend their summers in the park.

Endangered species in Banff include the Banff Springs snail (&quot;Physella johnsoni&quot;) that is found in the hot springs of Banff, and the woodland caribou.

=== Mountain pine beetles ===

Mountain pine beetles have caused a number of large-scale infestations in Banff National Park, feeding on the phloem of mature lodgepole pines. Alberta&#x27;s first known outbreak occurred in 1940, infecting of forest in Banff. A second major outbreak occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Banff and the surrounding Rocky Mountains region.

== Tourism ==

Banff National Park is the most visited Alberta tourist destination and one of the most visited national parks in North America, with more than three million tourists annually. Tourism in Banff contributes an estimated billion annually to the economy.

A park pass is required for stopping in the park, and permit checks are common during the summer months, especially at Lake Louise and the start of the Icefields Parkway. A permit is not required if travelling straight through the park without stopping. Approximately 5 million people pass through Banff annually on the Trans-Canada Highway without stopping.

In 2009, Banff Lake Louise Tourism hoped the appearance of the &quot;Crasher Squirrel&quot; internet meme would stimulate interest in the park. The meme is based on a photograph of a Minnesotan couple visiting the park on the shore of Lake Minnewanka that was &quot;crashed&quot; by a Columbian ground squirrel; the photograph was published in major news sources around the world and the image of the squirrel was digitally manipulated into humorous photos.

== General management ==

Banff National Park is managed by Parks Canada, under the &quot;National Parks Act&quot; which was passed in 1930. Over time, park management policies have increasingly emphasized environmental protection over development. In 1964, a policy statement was issued that reiterated ideals of conservation laid out in the 1930 act. With the controversial bid for the 1972 Winter Olympics, environmental groups became more influential, leading Parks Canada to withdraw its support for the bid. The 1979 Beaver Book was a major new policy, which emphasized conservation. In 1988, the &quot;National Parks Act&quot; was amended, making the maintenance of ecological integrity the top priority. The amendment also paved the way for non-governmental organizations to challenge Parks Canada in court, for breaches in adhering to the act. In 1994, Parks Canada established revised &quot;Guiding Principles and Operating Policies&quot;, which included a mandate for the Banff-Bow Valley Study to draft management recommendations. As with other national parks, Banff is required to have a Park Management Plan. On a provincial level, the park area and the included communities (other than the town of Banff which is an incorporated municipality) are administered by Alberta Municipal Affairs as &quot;Improvement District No. 9 (Banff)&quot;.

== Wildlife management ==

=== Previous management ===
The park was originally considered as a recreational area for visitors offering multiple leisure activities – the original wildlife policy viewed wildlife in Banff only as game or pests up until the 1960s and 1970s. As ecological awareness increased, management procedures expanded with the inclusion of public participation in many management decisions. Simultaneously, the increase in human construction (such as new highways) on the natural landscape increased the frequency of human–animal conflicts. In 1988 wildlife began to be considered an integral part of the ecosystem.

The park now has a number of wildlife management strategies that aim to conserve certain species. Parks Canada uses an ecosystem based management approach that aims to preserve the ecology of the park while still providing for visitors. Management decisions are based on modern scientific ecological information as well as traditional knowledge.

=== Large species management ===

Elk are a very important species in Banff National Park, partly because they represent a source of food for declining wolves. However they also have harsh impacts on the environment. Large elk populations cause vegetation degradation, human–animal conflicts and destabilization of biological interactions. In 1999, the implementation of the Banff National Park Elk Management Strategy by Parks Canada and the Elk Advisory Committee aimed to monitor and control the population to decrease conflicts and aid ecological process recovery.

Elk handling facilities are areas of pens with loading and unloading ramps where water and food are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk from the town of Banff. These measures allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.
The state of grizzly bear populations in Banff is seen as a proxy for ecological integrity. To keep bears away from humans, an electric fence was put up around the summer gondola and parking lot at Lake Louise in 2001. Bear-proof garbage cans, which do not allow bears to access their contents, help to deter them from human sites. The fruit of buffaloberry bushes is eaten by bears, so the bushes have been removed in some areas where the risk of a bear–human encounter is high.

Aversive conditioning deters bears by modifying their behaviour. Deterrents such as noise makers and rubber bullets are used each time the bear performs an undesirable action. Advice is also given to people to avoid an eventual habituation of bears to human presence. If this conditioning is continual the bear will be less likely to continue the undesirable behaviour (crossing into campsites and roads etc.).

Southern mountain caribou management previously aimed to identify what was threatening caribou populations and find solutions to mitigate the threats, but the last caribou in the park was found dead in an avalanche in 2009. There was concern over why more had not been done to save the caribou population. The primary reason for their decline is thought to have been habitat loss and altered predator–prey dynamics. Park management began monitoring the last five caribou in the park in 2002 and taking actions such as reducing impacts of humans, conducting studies of the population, and investigating the possibility of translocating caribou to increase the Banff population. 

In the mid-1980s gray wolves recolonized the Bow Valley in Banff National Park. They had been absent for 30 years due to systematic predator control hunting which began in 1850. Wolves filtered back to Banff and recolonized one zone of the Bow Valley in 1985 and another in 1991. A high level of human use surrounding a third zone at Banff townsite has deterred the wolves from that area. The wolves are important in controlling elk populations and improve the balance of the ecosystem. A routine park study to monitor the wolves in Banff has now grown into the Southern Rockies Canine Project – the largest wolf research project in North America. The estimated wolf population in Banff National Park and the surrounding areas is now 60–70 animals.

Plains bisons were reintroduced to Banff in 2017. The park has an extensive system of grasslands in backcountry valleys that are perfect for the bison. 16 bison were translocated from Elk Island National Park and initially placed under observation for a year in an enclosed pasture within a reintroduction site near Panther River Valley. After 18 months of acclimation, the herd was released into the reintroduction site and as of August 2021, the herd had grown to 66.

=== Strategies ===
Wildlife crossings have been successful in Banff National Park at reducing the number of animals killed on the roads. There is also of fencing at the edge of the highway in the park to prevent animals from getting onto the roads. Since it was put up, this has reduced collisions between wildlife and vehicles by over 80 per cent.

Train tracks still pose challenges to conservationists. Many bears have been killed by trains, often because they are attracted to grain spills along the tracks. Transportation corridors provide openings for plants which are also utilized by bears. A partnership between Parks Canada and Canadian Pacific Railway allowed the creation of the first Railway-Bear Conflict Mitigation Symposium in 2010. Initiatives included building wooden pegboards to fence off the sides of tracks and chemically treating grains to deter the bears. After a complete review of the research projects, the development of some of them has been authorized, including grain alteration and the use of cameras to study the behavioural response of bears to trains.

In 2011, Parks Canada began to study the effectiveness of electro-mats, large mats that give a small electric shock to animals that step on them, as a potential deterrent around train tracks. A trial instalment of the mats was placed in Banff to test their effectiveness in deterring animals like bears from gaining access to the fenced train tracks inside the park.

General prohibitions implemented to ensure wildlife respect include the prohibition of feeding, touching, or holding animals in captivity, and the disturbance or destruction of bird nests.

== Human impact ==
=== Environment ===
Since the 19th century, humans have impacted Banff&#x27;s environment through introduction of non-native species, controls on other species, and development in the Bow Valley, among other human activities. Bison once lived in the valleys of Banff and were hunted by indigenous people, but the last bison were killed off in 1850s. In 2017 a small herd of sixteen plains bison were reintroduced into an eastern section of the park. Elk are not indigenous to Banff, and were introduced in 1917 with 57 elk brought in from Yellowstone National Park. The introduction of elk to Banff, combined with controls on coyote and wolves by Parks Canada beginning in the 1930s, has caused imbalance of the ecosystem. Other species that have been displaced from the Bow Valley include grizzly bears, cougars, lynx, wolverine, otter, and moose. Beginning in 1985, gray wolves were recolonizing areas in the Bow Valley. However, the wolf population has struggled, with 32 wolf deaths along the Trans-Canada Highway between 1987 and 2000, leaving only 31 wolves in the area.

The population of bull trout and other native species of fish in Banff&#x27;s lakes has also dwindled, with the introduction of non-native species including brook trout, and rainbow trout. Lake trout, westslope cutthroat trout, and chiselmouth are rare native species, while chinook salmon, white sturgeon, Pacific lamprey, and Banff longnose dace are likely extirpated locally. The Banff longnose dace, once only found in Banff, is now an extinct species.
The Trans-Canada Highway, passing through Banff, has been problematic, posing hazards for wildlife due to vehicle traffic and as an impediment to wildlife migration. Grizzly bears are among the species impacted by the highway, which together with other developments in Banff, has caused fragmentation of the landscape. Grizzly bears prefer the montane habitat, which has been most impacted by development. Wildlife crossings, including a series of underpasses, and six wildlife overpasses, have been constructed at a number of points along the Trans-Canada Highway to help alleviate this problem.

=== Fire management ===
Parks Canada management practices, notably fire suppression, since Banff National Park was established have impacted the park&#x27;s ecosystem. Since 1983, Parks Canada has adopted a strategy that employed prescribed burns, which helps to mimic effects of natural fires.

=== Transportation ===
Banff National Park is bisected by two highways that cross the Alberta/British Columbia border while another provides a third access within Alberta. The Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) bisects the park in an east–west direction, connecting it to Vancouver to the west and Calgary to the east. Highway 93 bisects the park in a north–south direction, connecting it to Cranbrook to the south and Jasper to the north. The portion of Highway 93 north of Lake Louise is known as the Icefields Parkway whereas the portion southwest of Castle Junction is known as the Banff-Windermere Parkway. Highway 11 (the David Thompson Highway) connects the Icefields Parkway at Saskatchewan River Crossing to Rocky Mountain House to the northeast. Within the park, Highway 1A, also known as the Bow Valley Parkway, loosely parallels Highway 1 between Banff and Lake Louise.

The closest airport with long-haul flights is Calgary International Airport (YYC).

Other transportation facilities within Banff National Park include a Canadian Pacific rail line that generally parallels Highway 1 and an airport known as the Banff Park Compound Heliport.

=== Development ===

In 1978, expansion of Sunshine Village ski resort was approved, with added parking, hotel expansion, and development of Goat&#x27;s Eye Mountain. Implementation of this development proposal was delayed through the 1980s, while environmental assessments were conducted. In 1989, Sunshine Village withdrew its development proposal, in light of government reservations, and submitted a revised proposal in 1992. This plan was approved by the government, pending environmental review. Subsequently, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) filed a court injunction, which halted the development. CPAWS also put pressure on UNESCO to revoke Banff&#x27;s World Heritage Site status, over concerns that developments were harming the park&#x27;s ecological health.

=== Banff-Bow Valley Study ===

While the &quot;National Parks Act&quot; and the 1988 amendment emphasize ecological integrity, in practice Banff has suffered from inconsistent application of the policies. In 1994, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was mandated by Sheila Copps, the minister responsible for Parks Canada, to provide recommendations on how to better manage human use and development, and maintain ecological integrity. While the two-year Banff-Bow Valley Study was underway, development projects were halted, including the expansion of Sunshine Village, and the twinning of the Trans-Canada Highway between Castle Junction and Sunshine.

The panel issued over 500 recommendations, including limiting the growth of the Banff townsite, capping the town&#x27;s population at 10,000, placing quotas for popular hiking trails, and curtailing development in the park. Another recommendation was to fence off the townsite to reduce confrontations between people and elk. The proposed fencing was also intended to reduce access to this refuge for elk from predators, such as wolves that tended to avoid the townsite. Upon release of the report, Copps immediately moved to accept the proposal to cap the town population. She also ordered a small airstrip to be removed, along with a buffalo paddock, and cadet camp, that inhibited wildlife movement.

In response to concerns and recommendations raised by the Banff-Bow Valley Study, a number of development plans were curtailed in the 1990s. Plans to add nine holes at the Banff Springs Golf Resort were withdrawn in 1996.

=== Canmore ===
With the cap on growth in the town of Banff, Canmore, located just outside the Banff boundary, has been growing rapidly to serve increasing demands of tourists. Major development proposals for Canmore have included the Three Sisters Golf Resorts, proposed in 1992, which has been the subject of contentious debate, with environmental groups arguing that the development would fragment important wildlife corridors in the Bow Valley.

<text>Carleton University is an English-language public research university in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Founded in 1942 as Carleton College, the institution originally operated as a private, non-denominational evening college to serve returning World War II veterans. Carleton was chartered as a university by the provincial government in 1952 through &quot;The Carleton University Act,&quot; which was then amended in 1957, giving the institution its current name. The university is named after the now-dissolved Carleton County, which included the city of Ottawa at the time the university was founded.

Carleton is organized into five faculties and with more than 65 degree programs. It has several specialized institutions, including the Arthur Kroeger College of Public Affairs, the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs, the Carleton School of Journalism, the School of Public Policy and Administration, and the Sprott School of Business.

As of 2023, Carleton yearly enrolls more than 25,000 undergraduate and 5,000 graduate students. Carleton has a 150-acre campus located west of Old Ottawa South, close to The Glebe and Confederation Heights. It is bounded to the North by the Rideau Canal and Dow&#x27;s Lake and to the South by the Rideau River. Carleton has more than 180,000 alumni worldwide, producing seven Rhodes Scholars, two Pulitzer Prize awardees, an Academy Award winner, eight Killam Prize winners, and 27 recipients of the Order of Canada. Additionally, the university is affiliated with 53 Royal Society Fellows and members and 3 Nobel laureates. Carleton is also home to 35 Canada Research Chairs, one Canada 150 Chair, 14 IEEE Fellows and 11 3M National Teaching Award winners.

Carleton competes in the U Sports league as the Carleton Ravens. Over the past 20 seasons, the Ravens basketball program has won 20 national titles.

==History==
I learned very early the life lesson that it is people, not buildings, that make up an institution. And if we put our hearts to it we can do something worthwhile.
:– Henry Marshall Tory


===Carleton College (1942–1957)===
Discussions on establishing a second post-secondary institution in Ottawa began in the fall of 1938 among a committee of members from the local YMCA chapter, to create a school accommodating the needs of Ottawa&#x27;s non-Catholic population. While the Second World War ended the committee&#x27;s activities, a new committee was organized by Henry Marshall Tory as the Ottawa Association for the Advancement of Learning at a meeting held in December 1941, with formal incorporation in June 1942.

Established in 1942 as Carleton College, a non-denominational institution, the school began offering evening courses in rented classrooms at the High School of Commerce, now part of the Glebe Collegiate Institute. Classes offered during the first academic year included English, French, history, algebra, trigonometry, chemistry, physics, and biology. With the end of the war in 1945 and return of veterans from the frontlines, the college experienced an upsurge in student enrolment during the 1945–46 academic year, accepting 2,200 new students.

To accommodate them, the school rented facilities in various buildings throughout the city, including classrooms at the Lisgar Collegiate Institute, Ottawa Technical High School, and the basements of several local churches. The academic offerings expanded with the establishment of the Faculty of Arts and Science, and new coursework in journalism and engineering.

In 1946, the college opened its first campus at the corner of Lyon Street and First Avenue in The Glebe neighbourhood. The four-story building was the former location of the Ottawa Ladies&#x27; College, which was purchased during the Second World War for use as barracks for the Canadian Women&#x27;s Army Corps. Carleton&#x27;s first degrees were conferred in 1946 to graduates of its Journalism and Public Administration programs.

For nearly a decade, the college operated on a shoestring budget, using funds raised mainly through community initiatives and student fees. Fees during the school&#x27;s first academic year from 1942 to 43 were about $10.00 per course for first-year students, equivalent to $ in dollars. Fundraising efforts by the college&#x27;s president, Henry Marshall Tory, raised $1 million from donors throughout the Ottawa area, with half of the proceeds going towards the purchase of the new building, and the other to endow the college. Carleton&#x27;s faculty was composed largely of part-time professors who worked in the public service, some of whom eventually left the government for full-time tenure positions.

In 1946, Carleton chose a crest and motto. The first motto proposed by Tory was a crest with a maple leaf and open book surrounded by a scroll which read &quot;Carleton College&quot; and another scroll reading &quot;&quot;Mos Inter Bellum Natus&quot;.&quot; The Board of Governors did not approve the motto and changed it to &quot;&quot;Quaeceumque Vera&quot;.&quot; In 1948, the Board of Governors changed the motto yet again as this was also the motto of the University of Alberta. James Gibson, chair of the Committee on Symbols and Ceremonials, proposed a Latin motto, &quot;Opera nobis aeterna&quot;, derived from the Walt Whitman poem &quot;Pioneers! O Pioneers!&quot;, a translation of the phrase &quot;We take up the task eternal&quot;. The Board of Governors rejected this as too pretentious for an institution focused on egalitarianism, leading to Carleton&#x27;s current motto, &quot;Ours the task eternal&quot;. In October 1951, the Board of Governors formally adopted the new crest and motto, and the artist&#x27;s rendering of it was approved in April 1951.

In 1952, the &quot;Carleton College Act&quot; was passed by the Ontario Legislature, changing the school&#x27;s corporate name to Carleton College and conferring upon it the power to grant university degrees. Carleton thus became the province&#x27;s first private, non-sectarian college. The governance system was modelled on the provincial &quot;University of Toronto Act&quot; of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a Faculty Senate, responsible for academic policy, and a Board of Governors composed of local community members, exercising exclusive control over the institution&#x27;s finances and formal authority over all other matters. The President, appointed by the Board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.

Though the acquisition of land tracts now part of the current campus began in 1947, it was only in 1952 that the college gained possession of the entire 150-acre property, a significant portion of which was donated by Harry Stevenson Southam, a prominent Ottawa business magnate. In March 1956, the college released a 75-year master plan for the development of the campus in stages, with the first stage costing an estimated $4.2 million, equivalent to $ in dollars, foreseeing the development of academic buildings, student residences, and athletic facilities on the new site.

In October 1956, the beginning of construction at the Rideau River campus was celebrated with a ceremonial sod-turning by Dana Porter, then Treasurer of Ontario.

===Carleton University (1957–present)===

In 1957, the &quot;Carleton University Act&quot; was enacted as an amendment to the &quot;Carleton College Act&quot;, granting Carleton nominal status as a public university and resulting in its current name, Carleton University. This did not result in substantive changes to the school&#x27;s governance and academic organization as it had already been granted university powers through the existing legislation.

====Rapid development and growth (1960–69)====
The completion of initial construction at the Rideau River campus in 1959 saw the university move to its current location at the beginning of the 1959–60 academic year. Completed at a cost of $6.5 million, the first three buildings, the Maxwell MacOdrum Library, Norman Paterson Hall and the Henry Marshall Tory Building became the centre for academic life at Carleton, with Paterson Hall and Tory Building respectively serving the arts and sciences disciplines.

The 1960s saw meteoric growth in student enrolment, with the number of full-time students ballooning from 857 to 7,139 within the decade, which coincided with a sharp uptick in financial support from the provincial and federal governments towards post-secondary institutions.

An increasing share of these students came to the school from outside the National Capital Region, prompting the university to open its first purpose-built residence halls, Lanark and Renfrew Houses in the fall of 1962. The residences were initially segregated by sex, with Lanark House reserved for male students and Renfrew for female students. However, Carleton did away with the practice of mandatory sex segregation in 1969 in favour of co-educational housing, becoming the first university in North America to adopt this practice. By the end of the decade, the increased need for space to accommodate the growing faculty and student body saw the completion of several major academic buildings, including the Loeb Building in 1967 and the Mackenzie Building in 1968.

In 1967, a Catholic liberal arts college, Saint Patrick&#x27;s College, became affiliated with Carleton. Saint Patrick&#x27;s College was founded by the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate to meet the higher educational needs of Ottawa&#x27;s growing English-speaking Catholic population. Originally housed in a separate building Old Ottawa East, now the campus of Immaculata High School, a new building for the school was erected on the north end of the Carleton campus in 1973.

====Steady expansion (1970–1999)====
The arrival of a new decade ushered in the inauguration of the long-awaited Nideyinàn (formerly University Centre), designed to be the linchpin for student life on campus, housing a student-operated pub and other administrative services. With growing restrictions in physical space, the university hailed the completion of Dunton Tower, then referred to as the Arts Tower, in September 1972, which was the then-tallest academic building in Canada.

Rising attention towards recreation and fitness, coupled with generous grants from the provincial government, spurred the construction of the Athletics Centre in 1974, housing a multiplicity of different sports facilities, including a pool, squash courts, and gymnasium.

In 1979, Saint Patrick&#x27;s College was dissolved and merged into Carleton with Gerald Clarke, a professor at the school since 1954, serving as its final Dean. While Carleton is a secular institution, the name of the St. Patrick&#x27;s Building was kept as a nod to Carleton&#x27;s historical relationship to the Catholic institution.

Although Carleton experienced a temporary decline in student enrollment toward the latter half of the 1970s, the 1980s saw a resurgence in the number of students attending the school, representing an increase of 76%, or 5,582 students over the course of the decade, leading to overcrowding in many of the school&#x27;s buildings. Responding to the demands of a larger student population during the 1980s, the university built the Life Sciences Research Centre, the Minto Centre of Advanced Studies in Engineering (CASE), and funded an extension to MacOdrum Library.

Following renovations led by Toronto-based architect Michael Lundholm, 1992 saw the opening of the Carleton University Art Gallery in the St. Patrick&#x27;s Building, supported by a fundraising drive within the local community and the bequest of several pieces of Canadian art from the estate of Frances and Jack Barwick. In fall 1994, a new computing system was introduced at Carleton, extending Internet and e-mail access to all students and faculty, where this had previously been only accessible to graduate and undergraduate students in specific courses.

====Contemporary developments (2000–present)====
The new millennium brightened prospects for Carleton&#x27;s finances, allowing it to fund the construction of several new buildings during the 2000s. These include, &quot;inter alia&quot;, the $30-million construction of new athletics facilities, the $22-million, 9,011 m2 (97,000 ft2) Human Computer Interaction (HCI) Institute Facility and Centre for Advanced Studies in Visualization and Simulation (V-SIM), and the $17-million upgrade and expansion to Nideyinàn. In 2008, a sustainably-designed residence hall was added named Frontenac House, primarily serving returning second-year students. During this decade, Carleton inaugurated its first female President and Vice Chancellor, Roseann Runte in 2008, who served in this position until 2017, resigning to fulfill a new position as president and CEO of the Canada Foundation for Innovation. Runte&#x27;s leadership also pushed forward the planning and construction of three new academic buildings, Canal Building (2010), and River Building (2011; renamed Richcraft Hall in 2016), and the Health Sciences Building (2018), as well as a new residence building, Lennox and Addington House in 2011.

At the behest of Runte&#x27;s successor, Benoit-Antoine Bacon, Carleton has continued to pursue several major construction projects, notably the Advanced Research and Innovation and Smart Environments (ARISE) Building, replacing the existing Life Sciences Building, to house applied research in smart technology.

In 2018, Carleton purchased the Dominion-Chalmers United Church located in Ottawa&#x27;s Centretown neighbourhood to serve as a community and cultural hub, and host to artistic performances and academic lectures. The facility represents Carleton&#x27;s first building situated in Ottawa&#x27;s downtown area.

In 2021, Carleton completed construction on the Nicol Building, the new home of the Sprott School of Business. Located in the heart of Carleton&#x27;s campus, the Nicol Building was designed by Hariri Pontarini Architects and provides 115,000 square feet of new, collaborative learning space. The cost of the building was estimated at $65 million, but was offset through a sizeable donation of $10 million from the late Ottawa real estate developer Wes Nicol, for whom the building is namesake.

====COVID-19 pandemic====
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Carleton joined other Canadian post-secondary institutions in a decision to suspend in-person classes for the remainder of the 2019–2020 academic year, effectively moving instruction online. This move also saw the temporary withdrawal of non-essential services, such as athletics facilities, in order to contain the spread of COVID-19 on campus. Unlike other institutions, Carleton did not immediately move to evict students from residence buildings, but instead allowed students to leave early at their own discretion.

In July 2020, Carleton announced that classes for the Fall 2020 semester would be held entirely online, citing the potential risk posed by a second wave of COVID-19 and inequities to accessing physical classes for international students, who may encounter difficulties coming to Canada due to travel restrictions. Additional waves of COVID-19 in Ontario in early 2021 prompted the university to continue with online course delivery for the remainder of the academic year.

With the implementation of a mass COVID-19 vaccination program, and widespread uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in Canada, Carleton prepared for a gradual return of in-person learning for the 2021–22 academic year, offering a number of course delivery methods to students, including fully in-person classes, hybrid classes, and virtual classes. In August 2021, the university announced that all students, staff, and faculty would need to receive a complete series of a Health Canada or World Health Organization-approved COVID-19 vaccine to receive full access to campus, including attending in-person classes. In May 2022, Carleton suspended its COVID-19 vaccine mandate, following similar decisions made at other Ontario schools. The following month, the university indefinitely paused its mask mandate, while maintaining strong recommendations to students, staff, and visitors to continue wearing masks indoors.

==Organization and administration==
===Governance===
The university&#x27;s governing framework is established through the &quot;Carleton University Act, 1952&quot;, enabling legislation which sets out the basic legal obligations and purposes of the institution. The Act establishes Carleton as a bicameral institution, governed by a Board of Governors and Senate. The &quot;Act&quot; establishes the objects and purpose of the university as the advancement of learning; the dissemination of knowledge; the intellectual, social, and moral development of its members and the community at large; and the establishment of a non-sectarian institution within the City of Ottawa.

====Board of Governors====
The Board of Governors oversees the corporate affairs of the institution, including finances, real property, risk management, and strategic direction. The Board is also responsible for appointing the President and Chancellor, and determines the compensation of staff, faculty, and members of the senior administration. The Board of Governors is composed of 36 members, with 18 members derived from the students, staff, and administration of Carleton. These include four students, two faculty members, two members of the University Senate, two alumni, two staff, as well as the President and Chancellor, who are ex-officio members of the Board. The remainder of the representatives are selected from the local community at large.

To support its mandate and oversight function, the Board has six standing committees, with each Governor holding membership in one or two of these committees over the course of a year. These standing committees include Executive, Audit &amp; Risk, Building Program, Advancement and University Relations, Governance, and Finance.

The Board is led by the board chair, who presides over meetings, evaluates executive performance, advises senior administration, and represents the university&#x27;s interests to government. The current board chair is Beth Creary, former Senior Vice-President, Legal &amp; Compliance at Ligado Networks.

====Senate====
The Senate is the Carleton&#x27;s highest academic body and is responsible for university&#x27;s academic governance. The Senate&#x27;s duties include conferring degrees, approving recipients of honorary degrees, developing scholarships and selecting recipients thereof, approving new programs and curricular changes, in addition to overseeing academic regulations.

The Senate comprises 86 members, including 40 faculty members, two contract instructors, 10 undergraduate students, three graduate students, 23 ex-officio members, four members of the Board of Governors, and up to four special appointments.

===Finances===
For the 2023-24 academic year, Carleton reported a proposed budget of $525 million.

The largest annual sources of revenue for Carleton are tuition fees, which generate 50% of the university&#x27;s income, representing $336 million in earnings, and provincial government funding, representing 26% of the university&#x27;s income, or $174 million.

In 2023–24, Carleton received $116 million in research funding.

====Public Affairs====
The Faculty of Public and Global Affairs, formerly the Faculty of Public Affairs, houses the university&#x27;s academic disciplines that deal directly with government, civil society, and the relationship between them, comprising twelve academic units, offering 12 undergraduate programs and 21 graduate programs in criminology, economics, European studies, legal studies, journalism, political science, and public policy. In 2024, the Faculty of Public Affairs officially changed its name to the Faculty of Public and Global Affairs. The new name captures the global nature of its programs and the work of its researchers, students and alumni.

Many of Carleton&#x27;s flagship offerings are housed in the Faculty of Public and Global Affairs. This includes the School of Journalism and Communication, which offers the university&#x27;s Bachelor of Journalism and Master of Journalism programs. The Norman Paterson School of International Affairs (NPSIA), which houses Canada&#x27;s oldest foreign affairs graduate program. NPSIA, founded in 1965, is a member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs (APSIA). The School of Public Policy and Administration is the oldest such academic division in Canada and one of the most respected, with the university&#x27;s first graduate degree in the discipline being granted in 1946. Carleton&#x27;s Arthur Kroeger College of Public Affairs offers two unique honours degrees: the Bachelor of Public Affairs and Policy Management (BPAPM) and the multidisciplinary Bachelor of Global and International Studies (BGInS). The college is also home to the Clayton H. Riddell Graduate Program in Political Management.

In September 2006, Carleton was designated a European Union Centre of Excellence by the European Commission in Brussels and was the first university to offer a BA (Honours) in European and Russian Studies and MA in European, Russian and Eurasian Studies. Its Department of Law &amp; Legal Studies offers a BA (Honours) in Law and M.A and Ph.D. programs in Legal Studies, and is Canada&#x27;s oldest legal department to take an epistemic, rather than professional approach to studying the influence of law within civil society. The faculty also features the Institute of Political Economy, the Institute of Criminology and Criminal Justice and African Studies, and is home to the School of Social Work and Department of Economics.

In 2019, Carleton ranked 101–150 in the world for politics and international studies, placing it within the top one percent of global universities in this field.

=====Norman Paterson School of International Affairs=====
The Norman Paterson School of International Affairs is a professional school of international affairs at Carleton University. Founded in 1965, the school has distinguished itself as Canada&#x27;s leading school in the field of international affairs, producing graduates that have progressed onward into key leadership positions within the federal government, think tanks, and academia. Established during a &#x27;golden age&#x27; of Canadian diplomacy, the school adopts an interdisciplinary approach to the study of global issues, divided into seven clusters organized according to different areas of study under the umbrella of international affairs. NPSIA is the only full Canadian member, as well as a founding member, of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs, a group of the world&#x27;s top schools in international affairs.

====Science====
The Faculty of Science offers 86 undergraduate and 39 graduate programs across various fields including biology, chemistry, physics, health sciences, mathematics, computer science, neuroscience, and earth sciences, with over 6,500 students enrolled, served by 177 faculty members. Initial coursework on biology, chemistry, geology, and mathematics was first introduced in 1942 as night classes. In 1947, the school introduced its first undergraduate degrees in science, graduating its first cohort of honours degrees by 1950.

The Faculty of Science is divided into eleven departments, each with distinct teaching and research focuses. Departments are housed in several buildings across campus, including Herzberg Laboratories, Steacie Building, Tory Building, the Nesbitt Biology Building, and the Health Sciences Building. Each of these buildings house laboratories and other facilities for faculty and students alike to conduct research. The Nesbitt Biology Building contains several climate-controlled greenhouses that are host to an annual Butterfly Show in late September to early October, attracting visitors throughout the National Capital Region. The National Wildlife Research Centre, a research facility of Environment and Climate Change Canada is also located on campus, and is home to the National Wildlife Specimen Bank, a repository of over 12,000 specimens of wildlife native to Canada. The centre conducts important research on the effects of toxic substances on wildlife, international migratory bird patterns, and the effects of human activities on wildlife.

====Sprott School of Business====
Carleton first began offering a Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.) degree beginning in 1949, and functioned as a department-level academic unit under the Faculty of Arts &amp; Sciences, the Faculty of Social Sciences, and lastly the Faculty of Public Affairs and Management before its establishment as a separate faculty in 2006. The School currently offers two undergraduate programs, the Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of International Business with various concentrations like marketing and entrepreneurship, in addition to five graduate-level programs and several certificate programs for professionals. As of the 2023–24 academic year, Sprott programs are attended by 2,043 undergraduate students, served by a full-time faculty of 64.

Sprott is accredited internationally by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business and by the Network of International Business Schools. The school has been the first in Canada to offer a Bachelor of International Business (BIB). Its principal undergraduate offering, however, is the four-year Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) degree, and at the postgraduate level, MBA and PhD programs are offered. The Sprott School has won the Overall Institution Performance Award, for its research contribution, at the Administrative Sciences Association of Canada (ASAC), in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2012 among business schools at Canadian comprehensive universities.

===Admissions===
For the 2018–2019 academic year, Carleton admitted 5,988 first-year undergraduate students. For the 2022–2023 academic year, the average undergraduate entrance grade was 87.3%. Undergraduate admission averages and requirements vary by academic program, with some specialized and limited enrolment offerings (e.g., B.Sc., Bachelor of Journalism, B.Hum., B.P.A.P.M. and Aerospace Engineering) requiring admissions averages markedly higher (i.e., in the A/A+ range) compared to their counterparts in other faculties (generally in the B+/A- range).

===Scholarships and bursaries===
During the 2022–23 academic year, more than 15,000 scholarships and bursaries totaling over $31.9 million were awarded to undergraduate students.

Students admitted from high school with an academic average above 80% qualify for an entrance scholarship starting at $4,000 over four years, with $1,000 disbursed annually. The amount students receive increases incrementally with their admission average, with students entering with an average above 95% receiving $16,000 over four years. Nevertheless, students must maintain a minimum 10.0 CGPA (A-) year-to-year in order to retain their scholarship

Beyond automatic entrance scholarships, the university also awards 25 Prestige Scholarships, which represent the highest institutional scholarships awarded by the university. Incoming students must submit a supplementary application, in addition to an admission average above 90% in order to qualify and demonstration of extracurricular involvement during their secondary school years to qualify. Prestige Scholarships vary in value from $20,000 to full tuition, and generally do not have additional qualification criteria beyond the supplementary application, with the exception of the Carleton Shad Valley Scholarship of Excellence, which requires recipients to have been alumni of the Shad Valley program.

Additional scholarships, such as the Arthur Kroeger National Scholars Program, are awarded to students entering a specific program based on their academic merit upon entering their undergraduate programs.

===Rankings and reputation===

Carleton has been included in several Canadian and international college and university rankings. The 2022 international &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; ranked the university in the 501–600 range. In the 2023 international QS World University Rankings, Carleton ranked in the 601–650 range, and 21st in Canada. According to the international 2023 listings for the &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot;, Carleton ranks in the 601–800 range. In the 2022–23 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Global University Ranking&quot;, the university was ranked 526th in the world, and 20th in Canada.

In a 2009 worldwide survey of academics, which sought to determine the best professional Master&#x27;s programs in &quot;International Affairs&quot;, Carleton&#x27;s Norman Paterson School of International Affairs (NPSIA) was the only Canadian school to rank, and ranked 14th in the world. This was followed by a more recent domestic survey of &quot;International Relations&quot; academics, which, in 2015, recommended Carleton as the best choice for students seeking a career in policy.

&quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; is a Canadian magazine that publishes an annual ranking of Canadian universities, which is intended to measure a university&#x27;s overall &quot;undergraduate experience.&quot; In its 2025 edition, Carleton ranked fourth in the comprehensive category.

In 2015, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; began publishing program rankings for biology, business, computer science, education, engineering, mathematics, medicine, nursing, and psychology. As of 2019, Carleton is ranked 7th in Canada for engineering, 10th in computer science, 10th in mathematics and 14th in psychology. Carleton does not offer nursing, medicine, or education programs, specifically; however, it does have a &quot;Health Sciences&quot; faculty, which includes a biomedicine program and a disability and chronic illness program, and does have, in its &quot;Arts&quot; faculty, a Childhood and Youth Studies program originally rooted in Early Childhood Education (ECE).

85 Carleton researchers, past and present, were included on the 2024 Stanford-Elsevier list of the world’s most-cited scholars. This places these researchers in the world’s top 2% most-cited scholars.

In 2024, Carleton was recognized as one of Canada’s Top 100 Employers for the third consecutive year. It was also recognized as a Top Employer for Canadians Over 40 for the second consecutive year and as one of the National Capital Region’s Top Employers for the 10th consecutive year.

===Affiliated institutions===
*Dominican University College: An independent, bilingual Roman Catholic institution issuing undergraduate and graduate degrees in philosophy and theology located in the Centretown West neighbourhood of Ottawa. The school has been affiliated with Carleton since 2012.

==Campus==

Carleton&#x27;s campus is situated on bounded to the west by Colonel By Drive and the Rideau Canal, to the east by Bronson Avenue, and the south by the Rideau River. The campus is situated adjacent to the Dominion Arboretum and the Central Experimental Farm.

During its initial construction in 1959, the campus consisted of three buildings, the MacOdrum Library, the Tory Building, and Paterson Hall, forming a quadrangle situated at the heart of the university&#x27;s academic buildings. Since then, the university has expanded to forty-eight buildings, the newest addition being the Nicol Building, which was inaugurated in 2021.

The campus is accessible to road traffic through two entrances respectively located at Bronson Avenue and Colonel By Drive. Carleton&#x27;s campus contains a series of surface roads to facilitate traffic in and out of the university, the most heavily used of them being Campus Avenue, which was converted to a single-direction road in 2019 to ease congestion.

Several OC Transpo bus lines, including the 7, 10, and 111, serve the campus directly, in addition to the O-Train&#x27;s Carleton station, located at the centre of campus.

The campus is bisected by the O-Train Trillium Line, with several pedestrian and vehicular bridges and tunnels facilitating access between either side. The majority of the university&#x27;s academic and residential buildings are situated on the western side of campus, while the eastern side contains the university&#x27;s athletics facilities and administrative offices.

=== Architecture ===
The prevalence of modernist and brutalist architecture in the design of the earliest academic buildings on the Carleton campus represented a stylistic departure from traditional collegiate architecture in North America, which historically emulated the Gothic style dominant in many European universities. The decision to incorporate modernism into the campus&#x27; design was intentional, presenting Carleton as an egalitarian, progressive, and forward-thinking institution.

Architectural critics have looked to Carleton as a leading example of modernist collegiate architecture in Canada. The campus became the subject of Modern U, an exhibition by local artist Adrian Gröllner that sought to highlight the late modernist architecture embodied by many of Carleton&#x27;s early buildings.

===Tunnel system===
Buildings on campus, with a few exceptions, are connected by a five kilometre-long system of underground pedestrian tunnels. The Carleton University tunnel system is the most extensive network of tunnels at a Canadian university or college campus. The tunnels were initially built as part of the second phase of initial construction on campus in the 1960s. Originally conceived as a maintenance crawl space connecting heating and ventilation between campus buildings, a suggestion by a staff member transformed them into accessible pedestrian tunnels for students and faculty to use when travelling between different buildings on campus. The tunnels receive heightened usage during the winter months due to the severity of winters in Ottawa. Maintenance staff use modified golf carts in the tunnels to transport personnel, supplies, and mail to different locations on campus.

In 2019, Carleton introduced a new wayfinding system to assist students, faculty, and visitors in navigating the tunnel networking, using a metro-style map to display the network.

===Student housing===

Carleton has eleven student residence buildings clustered together in the northwest section of campus, and are connected to the university&#x27;s tunnel system. The first residence buildings constructed on campus were the Renfrew and Lanark Houses, which began accommodating students in 1962.

In 1969, the university introduced the first co-educational dormitories in North America. Since then, the university has gradually expanded the number of dormitories as enrolment has risen. On-campus housing at Carleton is configured in traditional and suite-style residences, with the latter offering students a kitchenette shared between four students. Unlike most collegiate dormitories, bathroom facilities are usually shared between two rooms, in contrast to the typical communal bathrooms. Residence floors are staffed by dedicated Residence Fellows, upper-year students hired by the university&#x27;s Department of Housing and Residence Life Services to provide personal and academic support to students.

Although the majority of students housed on-campus are first-year students, Frontenac House is reserved for returning second-year students, while Leeds House is reserved for upper-year and graduate students. Teraanga Commons serves as a hub for students living in residences, as it houses &quot;The Caf&quot;, the university&#x27;s main dining hall, the Residence Reception Desk, a Starbucks location, and Abstentions, a convenience store operated by the Rideau River Residence Association (RRRA), which functions as the student government for residence students.

During the summer months, some residence halls are turned over to Conference Services for use as hotels for visiting school and tourist groups to Ottawa. The Canadian Armed Forces uses some facilities, notably Glengarry House and Teraanga Commons, to house and feed the Ceremonial Guard, which conducts the renowned Changing of the Guard ceremony on Parliament Hill and posts sentries at Rideau Hall. It is possible to see practice marches and drills occurring on campus during this season.

==Library and collections==


=== MacOdrum Library ===
One of the three original buildings on the Carleton campus, the MacOdrum Library has served as Carleton&#x27;s central library and archives. The library is named for former Carleton President and Vice-Chancellor Murdoch Maxwell MacOdrum. As of 2022, the Library maintains a collection of approximately 1.2 million print monographs, 2.7 million e-books, and over 260,000 e-journals. During final exam periods, the library extends its operating hours to twenty-four hours to accommodate students preparing for their examinations or completing assignments. On an annual basis, the library receives upwards of 1.6 million visits from students, faculty, and researchers.

In 2013, the library inaugurated the Discovery Centre for Undergraduate Research, a multi-purpose space containing meeting tables, multimedia collaborative spaces, video game laboratories, as well as 3D printers. In 2023, the fourth floor of the MacOdrum Library, including the Discovery Centre, was transformed into a newly designed space called the Future Learning Lab, which includes spaces for studying, events and workshops, along with an XR (mixed-reality) equipped space.

The library regularly hosts exhibitions on the second floor, covering a broad spectrum of topics and academic disciplines. The second floor is also home to the Book Arts Lab, an experiential and multidisciplinary learning space dedicated to hands-on learning about typesetting, letterpress printing, bookbinding, decorative paper techniques and illustrations, such as wood cuts.

====Archives and Special Collections====
The MacOdrum Library maintains extensive archives and research collections of documents, artifacts, and other materials related to specific academic disciplines, as well as the personal effects of various persons of historical significance. Notable collections include the W. McAllister Johnson Collection, containing artwork and other documents pertaining to French art history in the 17th and 18th centuries, The Uganda Collection, which houses newspaper clippings, documents, and artifacts related to the expulsion of Uganda&#x27;s South Asian minority under the rule of Idi Amin, as well as Carleton University heritage material, including yearbooks, student newspapers, photographs, and ephemera significant to the history of the university itself.

=== Carleton University Art Gallery ===
Since 1992, the Carleton University Art Gallery (CUAG), located in a facility in the St. Patrick&#x27;s Building at the north end of campus, has served as a community hub for the visual arts at Carleton. CUAG contains three distinctive galleries on two floors, offices, collection storage vaults, and exhibition preparation room.

Admission to the gallery is free, and is open from Tuesday to Sunday weekly, with the exception of statutory holidays. In addition to its main exhibitions, the CUAG has a Curatorial Laboratory dedicated to installations curated by members of the Carleton community.

Past notable exhibitions include &quot;The Other NFB&quot;, which featured photography taken by the now-defunct Still Photography Division of the National Film Board of Canada during World War II and through the post-war years, &quot;Here Be Dragons&quot;, which sought to display new experimental forms of protest art, and &quot;Dorset Seen&quot;, showcasing Inuit printmaking and its relation to the Inuit experience with the Canadian identity.

CUAG also oversees the university&#x27;s art collection, which focuses on twentieth-century Canadian art after 1950, European prints and drawings from the 16th to 19th centuries, as well as Inuit and First Nations art.

=== Carleton Dominion-Chalmers Centre ===

In 2018, Carleton purchased Dominion-Chalmers United Church, securing a future rehearsal and performance space for its Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. Renamed, the Carleton Dominion-Chalmers Centre (CDCC), it is now Carleton&#x27;s arts, performance and learning centre. The CDCC is the Carleton&#x27;s first downtown Ottawa building and is managed by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. The centre is about 37,000 square feet with a seating capacity of approximately 1,000. It continues to host religious services for the church&#x27;s congregation as well as serve a variety of user groups from the community at large in addition to providing programing and experiential learning opportunities in arts and performance.

==Student life==

=== Student union and services ===

====Carleton University Students&#x27; Association====

All undergraduate students are members of the Carleton University Students&#x27; Association (CUSA), Canadian Federation of Students Local 1. The organization was established in 1942 and has a long history of being a nucleus of political activity on campus. The organization advocates for the interests of undergraduate students to the university&#x27;s administration, organizes and delivers the annual Orientation Week in conjunction with the university, certifies and financially supports student-run clubs and societies and provides a variety of services to students.

CUSA is led by a six-member executive body comprising the President and Vice Presidents of Finance, Internal, Student Issues, Student Services, and Student Life, who are elected annually by the undergraduate student body. Undergraduate students also elect twenty-eight Councillors allocated proportionately to each faculty, with 2 seats to Business, 4 to Engineering &amp; Design, 4 to Arts and Social Sciences, 8 to Public Affairs, and 3 to Science, in addition to ex-officio representatives from RRRA and the GSA.

The organization administers a number of student centres designed to cater to the safety and well-being of various members of the student body; these are the Mawandoseg Centre, the Carleton Disability Awareness Centre, Food Centre, Foot Patrol, Gender and Sexuality Resource Centre, the Racialized and International Student Experience Centre and the Women&#x27;s Learning, Advocacy, and Support Centre. CUSA also runs a number of businesses: Oliver&#x27;s Pub and Patio, an undergraduate student pub located on the first floor of Nideyinàn which in addition to serving traditional pub fare, hosts a range of student events throughout the year; Rooster&#x27;s Coffeehouse, a café located in Nideyinàn that primarily serves coffee, baked goods, and light meals; Haven Books, a discount bookstore and coffeehouse located off-campus in the Old Ottawa South neighbourhood, and The Wing, a pop-up convenience store located in the Nideyinàn Atrium, adjacent to Rooster&#x27;s.

====Rideau River Residence Association====
Undergraduate students living in the university&#x27;s residence facilities are also members of the Rideau River Residence Association (RRRA). Founded in 1968 and incorporated in 1976, students elect a three-member executive consisting of a President and Vice Presidents for Programming and Administration respectively, in addition to floor representatives to the RRRA Council, which endeavours to represent the interests of Carleton&#x27;s undergraduate residents. RRRA hosts a variety of events for students in residence, including an annual formal, and runs Abstentions, a convenience store located in Teraanga Commons.

====Graduate Students&#x27; Association====
All of the university&#x27;s graduate students are members of the Carleton University Graduate Students&#x27; Association (GSA), Canadian Federation of Students Local 78. Graduate students elect an executive and council members to represent their respective interests within the organization, which in turn advocates on their behalf and provides a variety of services that cater to postgraduates, which include the operation of a Grad Lounge and Mike&#x27;s Place, a student pub located in Nideyinàn specializing in Anglo-Indian cuisine, namesake of late Prime Minister and former Chancellor Lester B. Pearson. The GSA is also responsible for the provision of access to a variety of office services for graduate students.

===Fraternities and sororities===
Greek letter organizations are an active part of student life at Carleton, affiliated with both local and international organizations. From an administrative perspective, Carleton does not formally recognize fraternities and sororities, and has prohibited them from tabling in the Nideyinàn Atrium and Teraanga Commons while wearing their letters.

Since 2007, most Greek activities at Carleton are overseen by the Carleton University Greek Council (CUGC), a student-led organization which plans and coordinates social, philanthropic, and academic events throughout the school year between fraternities and sororities. Three international sororities, Phi Sigma Sigma, Alpha Omicron Phi, and Delta Phi Epsilon are governed separately by the Carleton Panhellenic Council, which fulfills a mandate parallel to that of the CUGC.

In early 2016, a Carleton sorority became the locus of controversy after an incident in which several chapter members decided to pop 80 balloons simultaneously during a meeting in the Tory Building, followed by celebratory screaming which falsely triggered an active shooter lockdown on campus. This led to some students advocating for an outright ban of the sorority responsible for the false alarm.

==== Newspapers and magazines ====
Carleton&#x27;s primary undergraduate student newspaper is &quot;The Charlatan&quot;, which was founded in 1945 and known as &quot;The Carleton&quot; until 1971. Until 2019, the newspaper published print editions on a bi-weekly basis when budgetary restraints forced the paper to reduce its frequency to once monthly. The Charlatan&#x27;s operations are overseen by a volunteer Board of Directors, composed of representatives from the newspaper&#x27;s staff, students, faculty, and the community at large.

Carleton is also served by &quot;The Leveller&quot;, a monthly newspaper established in 2009, representing student voice throughout the National Capital Region. The publication is characterized by its radical left editorial stance toward social issues.

&quot;The Resin&quot; was a newspaper for students living in residence which was published in 2014, when the Rideau River Residence Association decided to discontinue it.

During the school year, the School of Journalism publishes a community newspaper, &quot;Centretown News&quot;, which reports on the Centretown neighbourhood of Ottawa, and an online newspaper, &quot;Capital News Online.&quot;

The Department of English Language and Literature supports the student-run writers&#x27; zine, &quot;In/Words,&quot; featuring creative writing and short stories from Carleton students. Engineering students are similarly are served by &quot;The Iron Times&quot;, which is published by the Carleton Student Engineering Society.

==== Broadcasting ====
Carleton is home to a community radio station, CKCU-FM. Since its first broadcast in November 1975, CKCU-FM was the first licensed community-based campus radio station in Canada. CKCU-FM broadcasts a broad range of student and multicultural programming, featuring genres such as world music, avant-garde music, indie pop, and blues. In addition to an optional student-levy, CKCU-FM relies largely relies on donations from the local community and program sponsorships for financial support.

==== Theatre ====
The Sock &#x27;n&#x27; Buskin Theatre Company, which was founded in 1943, is Carleton&#x27;s amateur theatre company, having distinguished itself as one of Carleton&#x27;s most important cultural fixtures. The Company puts on diverse showcase of theatrical productions each year, with recent productions including &quot;The Crucible,&quot; &quot;As You Like It&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night.,&quot; and &quot;Angels in America.&quot; Sock &#x27;n&#x27; Buskin is entirely run and governed by student volunteers, who also comprise the actors and stage managers involved in each production.

== Athletics ==

Carleton competes as the Carleton Ravens, participating in intercollegiate competitions at both the national and provincial levels. Carleton is a member of both U Sports and Ontario University Athletics, with some teams competing in the RSEQ, encompassing 13 varsity sports.

=== Men&#x27;s basketball ===
Carleton is recognized for the strength of its men&#x27;s basketball team, The Ravens. Between 1999 and 2019, Dave Smart served as the head men&#x27;s basketball coach at Carleton, and is credited for building the team&#x27;s capacity to its current reputation of repeated success. Smart resigned from his position in 2019 to serve as Carleton&#x27;s director of basketball operations.

The Ravens men&#x27;s basketball team has won the national championship fifteen times, with five consecutive titles between 2002–03 and 2006–07 and seven consecutive titles between 2010–2011 and 2016–2017, surpassing the University of Victoria at the top of the all-time list. The Vikes had seven consecutive wins in the 1980s. With its 12th crown in 2016, the Ravens eclipsed the UCLA Bruins men&#x27;s basketball team as the college with the most national basketball titles, a feat accomplished in 14 years, compared with UCLA&#x27;s 11 titles in 32 seasons.

Outside of its typical season games, the men&#x27;s basketball team plays exhibition games with NCAA teams from the United States during the summer months, billed as the Can-Am Shootout. During these games, Carleton has garnered significant wins over reputable Division I teams such as the University of Mississippi, University of Cincinnati, and South Dakota State University.

As part of its athletic rivalry with the University of Ottawa, the team has participated in Capital Hoops Classic since its inception in 2007, which typically takes place in late January and early February at the arena at TD Place. In fourteen years of the event, Carleton has won on eleven occasions.

=== Women&#x27;s basketball ===
The Ravens’ basketball strength continues to the women&#x27;s side with Carleton being home to the 2018, 2023 and 2024 U SPORTS National Championship. The team, previously coached by now men&#x27;s coach Taffe Charles, is coached by Dani Sinclair.

The Ravens women&#x27;s team has helped to develop a number of professional players including Marlee Ball, Nicole Gilmore, Alyssa Cerino and Catherine Traer.

=== Football ===

Carleton established a football team during the 1945–46 academic year, losing 15–0 to Macdonald College during its debut match. In tandem with basketball and hockey, Carleton&#x27;s football matches transformed into a staple of student life at Carleton during the early years of the school, securing funding for sports equipment early in the school&#x27;s history. In 1959, Carleton&#x27;s move to the Rideau campus provided the team with updated facilities, including a field, training room, and equipment room.

In 1955, the football team began competing in the much-celebrated annual Panda Game against their rivals, the Ottawa Gee-Gees. The game evolved into an iconic highlight within student life at Carleton, gaining a sordid reputation for heavy drinking and outlandish parties. In 1999, the cancellation of Carleton&#x27;s football program placed the game on indefinite hiatus, though was eventually revived in 2013. Since 2014, the game has taken place at TD Place in Lansdowne Park. While Ottawa holds a historical advantage over Carleton in terms of Panda Game victories, the current iteration of the Panda Game saw four consecutive victories for Carleton between 2014 and 2017.

From 1999 to 2013, Carleton suspending its football program, citing a lack of success and the ensuing financial burden, then revived for the 2013 season. In the intervening years, several proposals to revive the football program were brought forward by the Carleton community and alumni, notably in 2000 with advocacy efforts by the &quot;Old Crow Society&quot;, which represents Carleton Football&#x27;s alumni, but it was deemed premature at the time. Subsequently, a 2008 survey indicated 86% of students were in favour of resuscitating the university&#x27;s football program. The team planned to form an independent corporate entity with its own revenue stream—a model that has proven successful at other schools, notably Laval University.

=== Other sports ===
The Carleton Ravens men&#x27;s ice hockey team plays within the Ontario University Athletics conference of U Sports. Carleton also maintains a rivalry with the University of Ottawa in this field, having competed in the annual Colonel By Classic at TD Place Arena since the tradition began during the 2016–17 academic year for the men&#x27;s team, and during the 2018–19 academic year for women.

The Ravens women&#x27;s hockey team plays within the RSEQ.

Carleton is also home to a highly successful soccer program which recently won silver at the 2021 U SPORTS Men&#x27;s Soccer Championship. The men&#x27;s soccer team has won silver three times, 2021, 2002 and 1984. Recent success has seen the team reach the final-eight tournament in four consecutive tournaments from 2017 to 2021.

The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer programs both compete in the OUA, playing their home games on the Ravens’ Perch.

Like women&#x27;s hockey, Carleton women&#x27;s rugby compete in the RSEQ. The program, which recently celebrated its tenth season, finished 2021 with a program best 3rd-place finish, securing the RSEQ Bronze Medal in overtime.

Carleton&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s fencing teams compete on the OUA circuit. The men&#x27;s team won its most recent championship in 2015, while the women&#x27;s team won its most recent championship in 2013.

In 2024, the women&#x27;s nordic ski team camptured the programs second CCUNC Championship at the Nordique Canada Championships. A dynasty in its own right, the team has won seven of the last eight OUA Women&#x27;s Championships.

<text>The river kingfishers or pygmy kingfishers, subfamily Alcedininae, are one of the three subfamilies of kingfishers. The river kingfishers are widespread through Africa and east and south Asia as far as Australia, with one species, the common kingfisher (&quot;Alcedo atthis&quot;) also appearing in Europe and northern Asia. This group includes many kingfishers that actually dive for fish. The origin of the subfamily is thought to have been in Asia.

These are brightly plumaged, compact birds with short tails, large heads, and long bills. They feed on insects or fish, and lay white eggs in a self-excavated burrow. Both adults incubate the eggs and feed the chicks.

== Taxonomy ==
A molecular phylogenetic study of the river kingfishers published in 2007 found that the genera as then defined did not form monophyletic groups. The species were subsequently rearranged into four monophyletic genera. A clade containing four species were placed in the resurrected genus &quot;Corythornis&quot; and five species (little kingfisher, azure kingfisher, Bismarck kingfisher, silvery kingfisher and indigo-banded kingfisher) were moved from &quot;Alcedo&quot; to &quot;Ceyx&quot;.

All except one of the kingfishers in the reconstituted &quot;Ceyx&quot; have three rather than the usual four toes. The exception is the Sulawesi dwarf kingfisher which retains a vestigial fourth toe.

The subfamily includes 35 species divided into four genera. The African dwarf kingfisher is sometimes placed in the monotypic genus &quot;Myioceyx&quot;, and sometimes with the pygmy kingfishers in &quot;Ispidina&quot;. Molecular analysis suggests that the Madagascar pygmy kingfisher is most closely related to the malachite kingfisher.

== Description ==

All kingfishers are short-tailed large-headed compact birds with long pointed bills. Like other Coraciiformes, they are brightly coloured. &quot;Alcedo&quot; species typically have metallic blue upperparts and head, and orange or white underparts. The sexes may be identical, as with Bismarck kingfisher, but most species show some sexual dimorphism, ranging from a different bill colour as with common kingfisher to a completely different appearance. The male blue-banded kingfisher has white underparts with a blue breast band, whereas the female has orange underparts.

The small kingfishers that make up the rest of the family have blue or orange upperparts and white or buff underparts, and show little sexual variation. Across the family, the bill colour is linked to diet. The insectivorous species have red bills, and the fish-eaters have black bills.

When perched, kingfishers sit quite upright, and the flight is fast and direct. The call is typically a simple high-pitched squeak, often given in flight.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Most alcedinids are found in the warm climates of Africa and southern and southeast Asia. Three species reach Australia, but only the common kingfisher is found across most of Europe and temperate Asia. No members of this family are found in the Americas, although the American green kingfishers are believed to have derived from alcedinid stock. The origin of the family is thought to have been in southern Asia, which still has the most species.

The &quot;Ceyx&quot; and &quot;Ispidina&quot; species are mainly birds of wet rainforest or other woodland, and are not necessarily associated with water. The &quot;Alcedo&quot; kingfishers are usually closely associated with fresh water, often in open habitats although some are primarily forest birds.

== Behaviour ==

=== Breeding ===

River kingfishers are monogamous and territorial. The pair excavates a burrow in an earth bank and lays two or more white eggs onto the bare surface. Both parents incubate the eggs and feed the chicks. Egg laying is staggered at one-day intervals so that if food is short only the older larger nestlings get fed. The chicks are naked, blind and helpless when they hatch, and stand on their heels, unlike any adult bird.

=== Feeding ===

The small &quot;Ceyx&quot; and &quot;Ispidina&quot; species feed mainly on insects and spiders, but also take tadpoles, frogs and mayfly nymphs from puddles. They will flycatch, and their red bills are flattened to assist in the capture of insects. The &quot;Alcedo&quot; kingfishers are typically fish-eaters with black bills, but will also take aquatic invertebrates, spiders and lizards. A few species are mainly insectivorous and have red bills. Typically fish are caught by diving into the water from a perch, although the kingfisher might hover briefly.

<text>The Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park is a National Marine Conservation Area, one of three in the Canadian national park system, located where the Saguenay River meets the Maritime estuary of the St. Lawrence River. This park is jointly managed by Parks Canada (Government of Canada) and Sépaq (Government of Quebec). It is the first park in all of Canada to protect a purely marine environment, and covers a surface area of 1,245 km2. The area that is now the Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park is a part of the Innue Essipit First Nation&#x27;s land claim, and a treaty resulting from this claim could impact activities that are practiced within the park. The region surrounding the park is an important part of the history of Canada, being one of the first points of contact between Indigenous Peoples and European explorers and the birthplace of the intercontinental fur trade.

The Maritime estuary of St. Lawrence begin at the Saguenay Fjord this meeting form a distinct ecosystem for the species in the park. Different species of whales in particular are drawn to the rich food supply stirred up by the mixing of these waters. One of these species is the St. Lawrence Beluga whale, which is endemic to Canada and a species at risk. The most popular activity in the park is whale-watching. The park provides a variety of opportunities on and off the water for visitors to see them. There are several human impacts that threaten the park such as climate change, noise pollution, chemical pollution, and overfishing, many of which are not fully understood.

== History ==
The Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region and surrounding areas are home to a rich and important part of Canadian history. The land has long hosted an abundance of natural resources such as fish, game, and berries, that played a large role in the survival of nomadic populations for generations. The region was occupied for at least 8,000 years prior to European contact. Findings from many archeological sites confirm the ancient peoples&#x27; seal hunting activities, and there is evidence that the Indigenous peoples of the region were a part of a network that extended from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Coast. Over the centuries, subsistence activities and trade evolved. The region became a crossroad for trade between the Indigenous peoples of the region and European explorers when their fur trade was woven into the existing Indigenous trade network in the 16th century through the establishment of the first settler trading post in 1600 by Pierre de Chauvin. Trade between the Indigenous peoples of the region and Basque fisherman can be traced back as early as 1580. The Basque were the first Europeans to work in the St. Lawrence Estuary. An alliance between the French and the Indigenous peoples in and around Tadoussac was created in 1603 led by Samuel de Champlain. This agreement led to the establishment of Québec City in 1608.

In the 17th to the 19th century, Indigenous peoples relied on marine wildlife for subsistence, fishing for salmon and hunting seals and seabirds. They traded their furs and oils made from sea mammal fat at the trading post in Tadoussac, located at the mouth of the Saguenay River. The establishment of beluga fisheries began in 1701, until 1979 when beluga farming was banned.

In the 19th century, demand for fish rose due to a boom in the forestry industry that led to a rapid increase in the French Canadian population as more sawmills were built. As the population increased, the land was transformed in order to house the new residents, impacting the nature and Indigenous peoples who had relied on this land to support them for centuries. The Innu&#x27;s saw a drastic decline in the hunting and fishing grounds which raised the first notions for land to be set aside for them in the form of reserves. The first conflicts between marine environmental users, as well as concerns for the preservation of those marine environments were raised. As the French continued to colonize the land, the region became a popular place for vacationing and sport fishing. In 1864 the first hotel was established in Québec City, setting the stage for the tourism industry in the Saguenay region. This was supported by progress in steam navigation that led to the rapid expansion of the region&#x27;s tourism industry. Vacationers raised concerns for the impact that industry had had on the wildlife and landscape, leading to the first legislation to preserve salmon habitats in 1860.

In the 20th century Saguenay entered the industrial era, rapidly expanding their forestry industry to include pulp and paper plants, as well as developing into the hydroelectric and aluminum industries. This industrialization led to the urbanization and modernization of the region, expanding upstream. The rising concern for the environment near the end of the 20th century led to a revival of the tourism industry with a new focus on nature and cultural heritage, and eventually the creation of the Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park. Ecotourism remains one of the most important economic activities in the region to this day, generation lots of economic benefits for surrounding communities.

== Ecology ==
=== Wildlife ===
The Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park provides habitat for a high diversity of species. According to the Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park Management Plan (2010), over 1,000 species of flora and fauna have been estimated to live there. The St. Lawrence Beluga whale and the harbour seal are the two marine mammal species that are residents of the park year-round. Other species that migrate to the marine park during different seasons are the blue whale, minke whale, fin whale, humpback whale, killer whale, long-finned pilot whale, northern bottlenose whale, sperm whale, North Atlantic right whale, white-beaked dolphin, Atlantic white-sided dolphin, harbour porpoise, harbour seal, and the grey seal. High krill and capelin concentrations make the Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park an essential feeding site for several of these species. Zooplankton is also abundant in this area. Additionally, the islands of the estuary are recognized as crucial locations for various bird species to nest. Aside from whales, seals, and birds, the marine park contains several hundred varieties of benthic and pelagic organisms, including numerous species of algae. The marine park also provides ideal habitat for food, rest, and wintering of several bird species.

=== Species at risk ===
There are 13 species deemed at risk by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) that live in the Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park or migrate there seasonally. One of these species, the St. Lawrence beluga whale (&quot;Delphinapterus&quot; &quot;leucas&quot;) was designated as &quot;endangered&quot; in 1983 by COSEWIC. The St. Lawrence beluga whale status was then changed to &quot;threatened&quot; in 1997. However, in 2014, the designation was re-examined and changed back to &quot;endangered&quot;. Up until the early 2000s, the population was growing at a rate of 0.13% each year. Since then, the population has been decreasing at around a rate of 1% each year. This beluga population is currently approximately 900 individuals, and is endemic to Canada. Additionally, this population is geographically and reproductively isolated from other populations because it is at the southernmost end of the species’ range. The St. Lawrence beluga population faces various threats, including underwater noise, habitat degradation, and pollution. The population has demonstrated evidence of significant demographic shifts since the middle of the 2000s, including an increase in neonatal deaths and a decrease in the number of young individuals in the population. Other at-risk species include the fin whale, the blue whale, harbour porpoise, the North Atlantic right whale, and the Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye.

=== Ecosystem ===
The Saguenay-St.Lawrence Marine Park contains three distinct ecosystems, including the upper estuary, lower estuary, and the Saguenay-Fjord. Each is hard to define by strict boundaries due to the nature of water, but it is the unique combination of all three that allows the park to support a large range of biodiversity. While each ecosystem differs in its temperature, salinity, sea floor, and depth, there are some processes that occur across the entire marine park. Most significantly, the continuous upwelling of cold water throughout this ecosystem bring fresh nutrients to the surface. The uneven underwater topography also supports producers, creating a strong ecological foundation for the park.

==== Upper and Lower Estuary ====
The Upper Estuary takes up the most area of the park, making up approximately 53%. It is characterized by wide flats, islands, and strong tides. It is the shallowest and warmest region, and has a rough sea floor. The water is high salinity-wise, but good circulation in this area mixes it well with freshwater. Despite the Upper Estuary being over 50% of the park, it has not been well-researched. The park management plan states the present data only indicate that the area supports species reproduction. The lower estuary accounts for 30% of the marine park. It is composed of saltwater from the Laurentian Channel, and is much deeper than the Upper Estuary. Considered a &#x27;stable&#x27; region, marine life is plentiful despite contaminants from upstream. It also serves the Saguenay Fjord with oxygen-rich water.

==== Saguenay Fjord ====
The Saguenay Fjord is the final 17% of the marine park. It is over long and deep. Mammals such as whales frequent the region due to its depth and supply of nutrients. Despite the fjord being rich in nutrients, it is the least stable region, with its health considered unstable. Fish populations have been declining, which is one indicator of the fjord&#x27;s poor health. Historically, major contaminants such as mercury and lead have been a problem for the fjord, but these have been greatly reduced. Organic contaminants such as organochlorines are bigger threats to current marine life.

== Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park management plan ==
On April 6, 1990, the governments of Quebec and Canada signed an agreement to create the Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park. The management plan was originally drafted in 1995, and the park was officially created in 1998. This was the first time that Quebec and Canada worked together to create a marine protected area (MPA). Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park was the first park in Canada to be dedicated to preserving a marine environment. The Saguenay-St Lawrence Marine Park is the product of years of coordinated conservation efforts between the two governments and is part of a larger endeavour to protect Canada&#x27;s marine environment. There was no transfer of land, so each government continues to act within the scope of their jurisdictions within the park. The park was created to increase the level of protection of a representative portion of the ecosystems present in the Saguenay River and St. Lawrence estuary. This was done with the goal of benefitting the present and future generations, for conservation purposes and to encourage its use for education, science and recreation. Two rounds of public consultations were conducted in order to determine the boundaries of the park and to present the management plan.

Management of the park is done following the principles of environmentally sustainable use, where ecosystems are used according to their limits regarding providing ecosystem services and resources. This ecosystem-based management method takes into account the renewal rates of marine resources. As well, protects endangered populations and habitats and aims to reduce the impact that human activities have on the operation of ecosystems.

The management plan was revisited in 2010 and a new document was produced. The revised management plan describes issues and objectives that guide new strategies to be implemented concerning the following: participatory management, ecosystem biodiversity, environmental sustainability of resource use, visitor experience, public education, public awareness, and administration.

=== Management structure ===
The creation of this park involved the establishment of teams to develop management tools for public safety, resource conservation, and environmental emergencies. The harmonization management committee was created to help harmonize the management activities of the provincial and federal governments and ensure co-management between governments. The coordinating committee is made up of representatives from various government departments and organizations involved in managing the park. There are representatives from the governments of provincial, federal, and regional governments involved in managing the park. Along with the Montagnais Essipit Band Council, a conservation group, the scientific community, the education community and Parks Canada. The coordinating committee is tasked with ensuring that follows up on the management plan is done and to advise the Ministers responsible for the park on the strategies and methods needed to attain the objectives outlined in the plan. The management plan emphasized the importance of public consultation and participation, especially the participation of Indigenous peoples, is crucial to the park&#x27;s success. The coordinating committee has created six different advising boards. Each committee provides their own focus to help define the challenges associated with different aspects of the coordinating committee&#x27;s intervention framework. The Ecosystem Management and Research Advisory Committee are tasked with identifying the needs and priorities related to the collection of scientific knowledge and data in the park. The continued commitment of all parties involved in the management of the park is crucial to achieving the maintenance of biodiversity and management of both marine resources and human activities.

=== Management objectives regarding ecosystem, sustainable use and biodiversity conservation ===
The revised management plan (2010) lays out new visions and actions that need to be taken in order to further protect ecosystems and biodiversity in the park, as well as ensure ecologically sustainable use of resources. These include, but are not limited to;

* Protecting vulnerable populations and ecosystems by ensuring the restoration and improvement of habitats that are essential to their survival;
* Implementing environmental monitoring mechanisms to measure the evolution of the park&#x27;s ecosystems and monitor the efficiency of management methods;
* Fostering the development of conservation values and awareness in those living around the park;
* Managing resource use following the principles of sustainable use and development (i.e. environmentally viable, socially acceptable and economically profitable);
* Promoting the collection of knowledge concerning ecosystem management approaches for commercial and recreational activities, and generating interest of research centers to conduct research on the natural and cultural heritage of the park.

==== Park use objectives ====
The goal of the park is to provide opportunities for visitors to enjoy a mostly undisturbed marine environment. Activities such as marine tours, cruises, scuba diving are allowed, and encouraged. Through partnerships with communities in the areas surrounding the park, tourism in the area has grown and many different recreational activities and services are available to visitors. This has benefitted the surrounding regions and has greatly contributed to the social, economic and cultural development and wellbeing of the local communities. There is no harvesting of natural resources permitted in the park, although large commercial ships are allowed to pass through. There is some recreational hunting and fishing activities permitted within the park, so long as they comply with the management principles of the park and within specified zones.

=== Participatory management and co-management with Indigenous peoples ===
The Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Protected Area and surrounding areas are part of the traditional territories of the Innu Essipit First Nation, the Pessamit Innu Band, and the Maliseet of Viger First Nation. The area that is now the Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park is a part of the Essipit Innu First Nation&#x27;s traditional territory, and a treaty resulting from their land claim could impact activities that are practiced within the park. The coordination zone of the park includes land claimed by the Malecite First Nation in Viger. The heritage presentations in the park take into consideration the activities, interests, and experiences of the Indigenous communities within the coordination zone. The Essipit Innu First Nation has been involved from the beginning and have played an essential role in all stages of the planning and implementation of the park. A representative from the Essipit Innu Band Council sits on the coordinating committee and other advisory boards. They contribute significantly to the presentation of the park, attesting to the long-established presence of Indigenous peoples in the area, as well as promoting the ancestral and contemporary cultural significance. Additionally, any projects that are considered by the committee that may have an impact on any Indigenous Communities, will first go through the process of informing the communities.

== Human impacts ==
=== Climate change impacts ===
Sea ice is vital to certain species&#x27; habitats in the marine park, particularly marine mammals. One major concern of the park is that the rising temperatures as a result of climate change are correlated with sea ice melt. Sea ice conditions were monitored from 1994 to 2008 in a study examining the entire St.Lawrence ecosystem, which includes the marine park. When compared to data from the 1980s and 1990s, sea ice had been significantly reduced. As a result, the low ice conditions reduced the availability of habitats and marine mammal stranding occurred more as more ice melted. The effect on marine productivity was also negative.

=== Noise pollution ===
Shipping noise and other water traffic are detrimental to the endangered whale population. As traffic in the Saguenay St. Lawrence Marine Park increases, there is a worry about the effects this could have on whales. Beluga whales are a central part of tourism in the park, and it has been known as one of the best locations to go whale watching. The area once served as a refuge for whales from low frequency noise, but this is being put to the test. It has been observed that the negative effects associated with this increased noise have the greatest impact on calves and females. This is worrying as calves and females are extremely important to the persistence of this endangered species. Investigations into this problem are still in the early stages, however, there is an understanding that harm is being done. Political action to address this is still relatively uncertain, and the conflict between the transportation sector and conservationists adds complexity. Parks Canada does have stated goals to address this, but the future of this issue is once again uncertain.

=== Pollution ===
Human pollution is a risk for species that live within the Saguenay St. Lawrence Marine Park. Shorelines of surrounding rivers lack industrial, agricultural, or even urban development which aids the health of this region. However, due to many river systems affecting this area, less direct influences of urban development have been found to significantly impact the park. Waste treatment is unsatisfactory, leading to untreated human waste being found in the water along with high levels of suspended particles due to how water enters the system. Industrial pollution, while less impactful, also has an effect. Fertilizer leaching into the water, and river seeing extensive use for transportation has led to pollutants entering the water, however the weight of these findings are less understood than that of urban development.

Clams have been affected negatively by chemical pollution such as fuel combustion, oil contamination, and urban pollution, which has led to a multitude of negative side effects. These side effects occur in areas of neuroendocrine, DNA damage, immunocompetence and increased energy expenses. This not only harms the clams, but also species that feed upon them, most notable is the endangered beluga whale. Ragworm Nereis diversicolor, gammarids, fish, birds, are impacted as well as others through bioaccumulation. The true scope of this issue is currently not known, but there is a high potential risk.

=== Overfishing ===
There is minimal knowledge of commercial and recreational fishing in Saguenay St. Lawrence Marine Park despite its long history of fishing use. However, fishing is still thought to be a point of concern by Parks Canada. The true fish population and catch rates are unknown, which make quantifying this issue difficult. Even without clear data, there has been warning signs that imply that the population may be declining. Catch rates while ice fishing have been noted to be falling, as well as a general yearly population decline. There is a push to acquire more data, but it will be seen when this will happen, or if it will be successful in managing the fish community.

== Tourism ==
The Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park has attracted 1,070,634 visitors during the season 2022 to 2023. There are many opportunities for visitors, with the most popular activity being whale watching. While belugas live in the park year-round, they are best spotted between May and October. Visitors can be right on the water through cruises, sea kayaking, boating, or scuba diving. Beyond this, there are four tourist regions that offer other attractions forming a “Discovery Network” along the coast of the park. These regions are Bas-Saint-Laurent, Charlevoix, Côte-Nord, and Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean. Common tourist attractions such as museums, hiking, and more opportunities for whale-watching are available. As a protected park, the aim is to minimize human impacts. The &#x27;Marine Activities in the Saguenay-St.Lawrence Marine Park&#x27; outlines all of the regulations surrounding watercraft and personal activities in the park.

<doc id="209141" wikidata="Q259657" url="?curid=209141" title="Vulgar Display of Power">
<text>Vulgar Display of Power is the sixth studio album by American heavy metal band Pantera. Released on February 25, 1992, through Atco Records, it was the band&#x27;s second collaboration with producer Terry Date, after having worked with him on their breakthrough album &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; (1990).

The album was well received by both critics and fans, and is Pantera&#x27;s highest selling album to date, eventually being certified double platinum. It is often considered one of the most influential heavy metal albums of the 1990s. In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; 10th on their list of &#x27;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&#x27;. Several of its tracks have become among the band&#x27;s best known, such as &quot;Mouth for War&quot;, &quot;A New Level&quot;, &quot;Walk&quot;, &quot;Fucking Hostile&quot;, and &quot;This Love&quot;. &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; received an expanded reissue in 2012, including an unreleased track, &quot;Piss&quot;.

==Background==
The band&#x27;s 1990 major label debut, &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;, demonstrated a change in their musical direction, from their 1980s material influenced by hard rock and glam metal bands like Van Halen and Kiss to resembling bands like Slayer, Metallica, and Black Sabbath.

==Recording and production==
In 1991, Pantera returned to Pantego Sound Studio to record this, their second release under Atco. The album was produced by Terry Date, who specializes in the rock and metal genres and had worked with the band on &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;. Date also went on to produce the band&#x27;s following two albums, &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; (1996). Before Date came in to work on the album, the band had demoed three tracks, &quot;A New Level&quot;, &quot;Regular People (Conceit)&quot; and &quot;No Good (Attack the Radical)&quot;. The rest of the songs were written in the studio with little preproduction or demoing.

After being in the studio for two months, Pantera were invited to open for Metallica and AC/DC at the 1991 Monsters of Rock free concert in Moscow&#x27;s Tushino airfield on September 28, 1991. The band then returned to the studio to continue work on the album. They travelled to New York City to have it mastered at Masterdisk. Although guitarist Darrell Abbott was credited on the album with nickname &quot;Diamond Darrell&quot;, during the recording of the album he had dropped that nickname and assumed &quot;Dimebag Darrell&quot; instead, and bassist Rex Brown dropped the pseudonym &quot;Rexx Rocker&quot;.

==Musical style and lyrics==
Drummer Vinnie Paul said that &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; was really close to the &quot;definitive Pantera sound&quot;. When Metallica released their self titled album in 1991, Pantera considered it a letdown to fans because they believed Metallica abandoned the thrash metal sound heard on previous albums. In turn Pantera felt they had an opportunity to fill a gap; they set out to make the heaviest record of all time.

Darrell had played the riff for &quot;Walk&quot; during a soundcheck while Pantera was touring for &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; and the rest of the band loved it. Following this tour, the band returned home and found that some friends thought that rock stardom had gone to their heads. The lyrics for the song were inspired from these people&#x27;s attitude toward the band; Anselmo&#x27;s message to them was, &quot;Take your fucking attitude and take a fuckin&#x27; walk with that. Keep that shit away from me.&quot;

==Title and artwork==
The title of the album is taken from a line in the 1973 film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. (Priest: &quot;If you&#x27;re the Devil, why not make the straps disappear?&quot;. Girl: &quot;That&#x27;s much too vulgar a display of power, Karras.&quot;) In April 2007, the title was used for the book &quot;A Vulgar Display of Power: Courage and Carnage at the Alrosa Villa&quot;, which includes many Pantera song titles as chapter headings. The book details the incidents leading up to the murder of Dimebag Darrell in 2004.

The album&#x27;s cover depicts a man being punched in the face and was shot by photographer Brad Guice, who also shot the cover photo for &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;; Dimebag Darrell originally came up with the idea while playing around with a photocopier, and moving a photo around on the bed of the photocopier as the lamp was moving to get a distorted, smeared look of the face on the photo. The band told their label that they wanted &quot;something vulgar, like a dude getting punched&quot;. The first version of the cover that the label brought to the band showed a boxer with a boxing glove, but the band did not like it, so the label produced a second version, with the bare fist. A popular rumor stirred up by Vinnie Paul was that the man on the cover was paid $10 a punch and was hit in the face a total of 31 (Rex Brown claiming 32) times to get the right picture. However, Guice dispelled this when he confirmed that the man, a hired model named Sean Cross, was never actually hit.

==Release==
&quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; was released on February 25, 1992. The original album spawned four singles. &quot;Mouth for War&quot;, &quot;This Love&quot; and &quot;Hollow&quot; were released in 1992. In 1993, the band released the fourth single for &quot;Walk&quot;, along with a number of EPs featuring remixes of the song. In 1993, the &quot;Walk&quot; EP was released in Japan, and later, on May 16, 2012, the EP was made available to purchase digitally in the United States for the first time. The band also released music videos for &quot;Mouth for War&quot;, &quot;This Love&quot; and &quot;Walk&quot;, which were included on &quot;Vulgar Video&quot; and &quot;3 Vulgar Videos from Hell&quot;. The music video for &quot;Walk&quot; was shot at the Riviera Theatre in Chicago, where the band played the song multiple times to capture live video footage in front of fans.

On April 12, 2012, the before unheard song &quot;Piss&quot; was released, which was recorded during the sessions for the album but never featured on the original album. Drummer Vinnie Paul had re-discovered the song while looking through old Pantera recordings. The music video for &quot;Piss&quot; debuted at the &quot;Revolver&quot; Golden Gods Awards, on April 11, 2012. The main riff from &quot;Piss&quot; was used in the song &quot;Use My Third Arm&quot; on the band&#x27;s following record &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;.

===Tour and media appearances===
To promote the album, Pantera toured with Skid Row and Soundgarden giving them the opportunity to perform in front of a mainstream audience in the United States. After touring with Skid Row the band did a European tour with Megadeth. The band also toured with White Zombie in 1992. The unique sound and the band&#x27;s explosive live performances helped them gain more popularity.

The music videos for singles from the album were played in relatively heavy rotation on MTV. Also during the 1990s, MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; used excerpts from the album&#x27;s songs for the show&#x27;s opening theme, bumpers, and closing theme. &quot;Walk&quot; and &quot;Mouth for War&quot; were available as downloadable tracks for the video game &quot;Rock Band 3&quot;. &quot;Walk&quot; was also featured on &quot;Madden NFL 10&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

&quot;By Demons Be Driven&quot; appears in the 2015 Academy Award-nominated film &quot;The Big Short&quot;; actor Christian Bale is seen performing along to the song on drums, which he learned for that one scene.

===20th anniversary reissue===
On May 15, 2012, a two-disc deluxe edition of &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; was released to celebrate its 20th anniversary. Disc one is a remastered version of the original album along with the song &quot;Piss&quot;. Disc two is a DVD featuring six songs from Pantera&#x27;s set at their 1992 Monsters of Rock performance in Reggio Emilia, Italy. Disc two also contains the three music videos for &quot;Mouth for War&quot;, &quot;Walk&quot; and &quot;This Love&quot;. Vinnie Paul said that &quot;Piss&quot; was &quot;the only undiscovered complete Pantera track there ever was&quot; and it would appear on the 20th anniversary release. He also said that at the time of the original release, the band thought that it didn&#x27;t feel right to go on the record.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; received critical acclaim upon release. Many critics have praised Darrell&#x27;s guitar work on the album and use of heavy riffs to set the tone for the album. Reviewers also pointed out the change in Anselmo&#x27;s vocals from previous releases, with him using deeper growls and powerful vocals to accompany the catchy riffs and aggressive lyrics.

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; and Sputnikmusic both gave the album a 4 out of 5. Steve Huey of AllMusic rated the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, describing it as &quot;One of the most influential heavy metal albums of the 1990s&quot;. He also said that while the album stacks the best songs at the beginning, the riffs and sonic textures are more consistently interesting than those used in &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;. Janiss Garza writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that it was &quot;one of the most satisfying heavy metal records since Metallica&#x27;s early-80s cult days&quot;. She also praised the album&#x27;s two ballad tracks, &quot;This Love&quot; and &quot;Hollow&quot;, stating &quot;their tough edge slashes painfully through deep introspection about personal relationships&quot;.

Reviewing the 20th anniversary reissue, Michael Christopher of &quot;The Phoenix&quot; rated the album 3.5 out of 4 stars stating, while the bonus track &quot;Piss&quot; does not match up to the rest of the material, the groove that flows through the original record is the muscle behind what mattered most. Denise Falzon of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; stated that the reissue sounds a little cleaner from the enhanced production quality. She noted that &quot;Piss&quot; does sound oddly out of place on the reissue, but the release is worthwhile for the DVD showcasing the band&#x27;s dynamic live performance. In 2005, &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; was ranked number 333 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; peaked at number 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, the most for any Pantera album. The album also peaked at number 64 on the UK Albums Chart, number 69 on the German Chart, and number 54 on the Oricon Chart. The album has since gone on to become Pantera&#x27;s best selling album, attaining many certifications since its release including double platinum status in the United States. The album achieved gold status in Canada in August 1993 and has achieved gold status in the UK. The album has also achieved a platinum certification in Australia. In the week ending May 20, 2012, the album re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number 48, taking the total sales to 2,177,000 copies. This was due to release of the 20th Anniversary reissue which sold over 9000 copies in the U.S. during its first week.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Mouth for War&quot;, became the band&#x27;s first song to ever chart, debuting in October 1992 on the UK Singles Chart and managing to peak at number 73. The album&#x27;s fourth single &quot;Walk&quot; gave the band their first top 40 UK hit when it peaked at number 35 in early 1993.

==Legacy and accolades==
&quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; has been listed as one of the &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. Chad Bowar of About.com ranked the album at number one in his list of the &quot;Best Heavy Metal Albums of 1992&quot; stating that &quot;Pantera was head and shoulders above the rest of the field.&quot; He also ranked the album second in the &quot;Best Heavy Metal Albums of the 1990s&quot; list behind Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; (1990). In October 2011, the album was ranked number four on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The Top 10 Guitar Albums of 1992&quot;. The album was ranked number one on &quot;Loudwire&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top 11 Metal Albums of the 1990s&quot; and their &quot;Top 10 Albums of 1992&quot;, and the song &quot;Walk&quot; was ranked number seven in their &quot;10 Catchiest Metal Songs&quot;. &quot;Loudwire&quot; also listed four of the album&#x27;s songs in their list of the &quot;10 Best Pantera songs&quot;, placing &quot;This Love&quot; in seventh, &quot;Mouth for War&quot; in fifth, &quot;Fucking Hostile&quot; in third and &quot;Walk&quot; in first. In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; as 10th on their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2022, &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; #1 on their list of &quot;The 30 greatest rock guitar albums of 1992&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; named &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; the eleventh most influential heavy metal album ever on their list of the &quot;Top 25 Metal Albums&quot;. They wrote the following:

This album makes the list because it took heavy metal and made it heavier. It took darkness and made it darker. It took anger and made it angrier. Never before had a band tuned down its guitars and crunched a heavier riff than on this album. &#x27;Mouth for War&#x27; and &#x27;A New Level&#x27; and &#x27;No Good (Attack the Radical)&#x27; stand out on an album where every track is a classic track. Dimebag Darrell was an innovator and a true godsend for heavy metal. One of the most underrated players in the genre. And this may sound corny, but the way the band was able to turn seemingly negative aspects of the genre – hate, anger, violence and despair – into positive thoughts is somewhat akin to De La Soul dropping a positive message into rap.

The song &quot;Walk&quot; has been covered by a number of bands and artists, including Avenged Sevenfold, Leo Moracchioli, Disturbed, and Breaking Benjamin, among others.

<doc id="209144" wikidata="Q1474238" url="?curid=209144" title="Fundy National Park">
<text>Fundy National Park is a national park of Canada located on the Bay of Fundy, near the village of Alma, New Brunswick. It was created on April 10, 1946 and officially opened on July 29, 1950. The park showcases a rugged coastline which rises up to the Canadian Highlands, the highest tides in the world and more than 25 waterfalls. The park covers an area of along Goose Bay, the northwestern branch of the Bay of Fundy. When one looks across the Bay, one can see the northern Nova Scotia coast.

At low tide, park visitors can explore the ocean floor where a variety of sea creatures (e.g., dog whelk, periwinkles, various seaweeds) cling to life. At high tide, the ocean floor disappears under of salt water.

Park amenities include a golf course, a heated saltwater swimming pool, three campgrounds, and a network of over of hiking and biking trails. There are 25 hiking trails throughout the park. The Caribou Plains trail and boardwalk provides access to upland forest and bog habitats. Dickson Falls is the most popular trail in the park. During the winter, Fundy National Park is available for day use, at one&#x27;s own risk. Visitors use the park to go cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, tobogganing, and winter walking. The cross-country ski trails are groomed by the local Chignecto Ski Club.

A variety of scientific projects are ongoing in the park, with the primary focus on monitoring the park&#x27;s ecology. Recent projects have focused on re-establishing aquatic connectivity in the park (Bennett Lake Dam, new Culverts, Dickson Brook restoration. Species such as the endangered Inner Bay of Fundy Atlantic salmon, martens and fishers, brook trout, eel, and moose are monitored regularly.

The Dobson Trail and Fundy Footpath extend out of the park to Riverview and to Fundy-St. Martins respectively. A unique red-painted covered bridge is located at Point Wolfe.

Other rivers that flow through the park include the:
*Broad River
* Point Wolfe River
*Upper Salmon River
==History==
===Indigenous period and colonization===

The area that is now Fundy National Park had been at one point inhabited by the Mi&#x27;kmaq and Maliseet peoples, but this was suggested as having been temporary due to few traces of remains indicating permanent settlement.

In the late 1600s and the early 1700s, the surrounding area was being settled by Acadians. One of these settlements included Chipoudy &quot;(now Shepody)&quot;, established in 1710 and inhabited by Acadians until they were driven out by the British in the Expulsion of the Acadians. It was not until 1825 that the park&#x27;s region was permanently settled by Europeans: in particular, immigrants from Scotland, Ireland, and England. Despite having been granted to settlers for use, the lands on the plateaus were unsuitable for agriculture, and were abandoned within a generation.
The coastal villages were much more prosperous; the most notable settlement of them all, Point Wolfe, flourished from fishing, sawmills, and small shipyards. Jobs in the area were primarily seasonal: during the winter, most men worked in lumber camps and participated in log driving in the spring, both of which were their primary sources of income; in the summer and fall, they worked on the farm; all the while the women managed household tasks year-round.

However, the logging industry eventually led to a depletion of wood resources by the late 19th and early 20th centuries, causing an exodus of most of the area&#x27;s residents. In addition, the clogging of the rivers by sawmill waste had damaged fish stocks and prevented the salmon from spawning in the area, resulting in fishermen abandoning their weirs.

===Creation===

The proposal for a national park to be established in the province first came from a petition organized by the New Brunswick Fish and Game Association in 1927, with the aim to protect endangered animals in the region. In 1928 the association formed a committee composed of notable figures from the province and selected six potential sites, with Mount Carleton and Albert County being the most likely candidates. After surveying the proposed parks, the National Parks Branch favoured a site at Lepreau, followed by the Albert site, contradicting the provincial figures such as William Francis Ganong who preferred Mount Carleton, which was already known for its hunting and fishing tourism. In response, the federal government favours the Mount Champlain site, located between Saint John and Fredericton, which was not proposed by the province. The disagreements made between the federal and provincial governments about which site should be chosen, along with the lack of vision of what a New Brunswick park should be, resulted in the project being postponed around 1937. The issue was resurfaced after the end of the Second World War, and out of the Branch&#x27;s proposed sites of Lepreau, Mount Champlain, and Albert, the province finalized on choosing the latter site.

The expropriation process in Fundy was met with mixed reactions, but it ultimately proceeded more smoothly compared to the national parks of Cape Breton Highlands and Prince Edward Island due to the greater communication efforts made by New Brunswick, which better prepared the expropriated landowners. New Brunswick demonstrated a more generous approach by allowing for landowners to make an appeal if they were dissatisfied, and the overall process was done more swiftly. The targeted area for expropriation consisted of about half crown land, which was licensed to Hollingsworth and Whitney, a forestry company from Maine. The remaining land consisted of 130 privately owned properties. The provincial government quickly purchased the land owned and leased by Hollingsworth for $325,000 CAD, which was accepted by the company with satisfaction. Afterwards, the region&#x27;s two sawmills were then expropriated, with the province compensating the owners with $16,000 CAD and about $6,000 CAD, respectively. Homeowners were expropriated thereafter, with most receiving varying compensation amounts ranging from $4,000 to $10,000, while cottage owners were compensated with $2,000. In total, expropriating the landscape cost the province over $850,000. Following the expropriations, all previous structures were demolished and their remains were burned, much to the disappointment of the former residents. Subsequently, most of the expropriated individuals settled in Alma, located just east from the park. The park was officially created on April 10, 1948.

The initial two national parks in Atlantic Canada demonstrated considerable success, as evidenced by a significant increase in attendance between 1945 - 1948. This trend of increased national park visitation was seen all across Canada, with attendance numbers doubling between 1945 - 1947. Consequently, this encouraged the Parks Branch to substantiate a much larger investment into Fundy compared to previous park developments. From 1948 to 1950, the branch dedicated over $2.2 million towards Fundy National Park, compared to the $1.1 million expenditure for the first four years of development for the Cape Breton Highlands National Park.

The park headquarters&#x27; construction started at a particular site, at the expense of the site&#x27;s natural and cultural heritage. A nine-hole golf course was designed by Stanley Thompson and constructed alongside the road leading to Point Wolfe at a cost of $100,000. Additionally, a swimming pool was established near Alma West&#x27;s beach. To provide accommodation within the park, designated campgrounds were developed, designed to accommodate tents and trailers. Additionally, 29 cottages were constructed in a location overlooking the park&#x27;s golf course. One of the more significant expenses was that of the park superintendent&#x27;s residence. Initially authorized at a price of $12,000, the project eventually incurred a total cost of $30,000 by the time it was finished, a price equivalent to the value of three to four farms in Alma. The park headquarters area also saw the installation of the New Brunswick School of Arts and Crafts, but it later disappeared.

==Natural environment==
According to the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, the park is located in the Level III- Eastern Temperate Forests (Maine-New Brunswick Plains and Hills) ecoregion. According to the Ecological Framework of Canada, the park is situated in two distinct ecoregions. The southern section of the park falls in the Fundy Coast ecoregion. This region experiences cool, wet summers and mild, rainy winters. Its coniferous forest consists of red spruce, balsam fir, and red maple with some white spruce, and white and yellow birch. Some sugar maple and beech trees are also found here at higher elevations. The northern section of the park falls in the Southern New Brunswick Uplands ecoregion. This ecoregion experiences summers that are warm and rainy, and winters that are mild and snowy. Its mixed-wood forest contains mainly sugar and red maple, white and red spruce and balsam fir trees. Finally, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the park is located in the New England-Acadian forest ecoregion.

=== Flora ===

The park is home to 658 species of vascular plants, 276 species of bryophytes, and more than 400 species of lichens. The Fundy forest is generally a mixed-wood forest composed of red spruce (&quot;Picea rubens&quot;), balsam fir (&quot;Abies balsamea&quot;), yellow birch (&quot;Betula alleghaniensis&quot;), white birch (&quot;Betulla papyrifera&quot;), sugar maple (&quot;Acer saccharum&quot;), and red maple (&quot;Acer rubrum&quot;). The mixed-wood forest floor is blanketed with moss, wood fern (&quot;Dryopteris&quot;), and bunchberry (&quot;Cornus canadensis&quot;).

Pure hardwood stands (distinguishable communities of tree species within a forest) account for 5.4% of the Fundy forest cover. The most abundant pure hardwood stands are yellow birch (&quot;Betula alleghaniensis&quot;) and white birch (&quot;Betulla papyrifera&quot;). There are also some sugar maple (&quot;Acer saccharum&quot;), red maple (&quot;Acer rubrum&quot;), and beech (&quot;Fagus&quot;) stands. Carolina springbeauty (&quot;Claytonia caroliniana&quot;) and trout-lily (&quot;Erythronium americanum&quot;) bloom in the hardwood forest every year.

The coniferous forest in the park represents the boreal element of Fundy&#x27;s forest cover. Although pure stands of conifer are rare in the park, the Fundy forest has some of the last pure stands of red spruce (&quot;Picea rubens&quot;) found in eastern North America.

The bogs of the park are blanketed with sphagnum moss (&quot;Sphagnum&quot;) from which grow black spruce (&quot;Picea mariana&quot;) and Eastern larch (&quot;Larix laricina&quot;). Within the park&#x27;s Caribou Plain bog, three carnivorous plant species are found: pitcher plant (&quot;Sarracenia purpurea&quot;), sundew (&quot;Drosera anglica&quot;), and bladderwort (&quot;Utricularia&quot;).

Some rare plant species are also found in the park. Bird&#x27;s-eye primrose (&quot;Primula farinosa&quot;) is found along the Point Wolfe and Goose River coastal cliffs, and several other rare flora species, namely slender spikemoss (&quot;Selaginella viridissima&quot;), squashberry (&quot;Viburnum edule&quot;), green spleenwort (&quot;Asplenium viride&quot;), rare sedges, and fir clubmoss (&quot;Huperzia selago&quot;), are found along the eastern branch of the Point Wolfe River and the lower part of Bennett Brook.
===Fauna===
==== Mammals ====
There are 38 species of mammals in Fundy National Park, the ones most commonly found being eastern moose, white-tailed deer, eastern coyotes, chipmunks, red squirrels and snowshoe hares, with more nocturnal mammals in the park being various mice and shrews, raccoons, black bears, North American beavers and northern flying squirrels. Bats have also been spotted in the park, and due to an increase in sightings in 2020 the park installed ultrasonic bat monitors.

==== Birds ====
Within the Fundy Park region, over 260 species of birds have been discovered in the area, with approximately 95 of which having nested in the park itself. Among the most commonly found species in the park include varieties of warblers, pileated woodpeckers, juncos, white-winged crossbills, great blue herons, cormorants, semipalmated sandpipers and semipalmated plovers. Around during the park&#x27;s creation in 1948, the peregrine falcon had been extirpated, but was later successfully reintroduced.

==== Reptiles and amphibians ====
Fundy Park also encompasses various reptiles and amphibians within its boundaries. Identified species in the park include 4 types of nonpoisonous snakes: green snakes, red-bellied snakes, ring-necked snakes and eastern garter snakes, the most common and largest out of them all. 

Amphibians in Fundy Park include various frogs, toads and salamanders. Among the frog species found in the area are American toads, leopard frogs, pickerel frogs, green frogs and bullfrogs. Salamanders, on the other hand, include seven species: yellow-spotted salamanders, red-backed salamanders, northern two-lined salamanders, eastern newts as well as three additional species, the four-toed salamander, blue-spotted salamander and northern dusky salamander being considered as rare.

==Tourism and administration==

Located in Alma, New Brunswick, Fundy National Park is under the management of Parks Canada, an agency of Environment Canada that is overseen by the Canadian government. In the fiscal year of 2013-2014, Parks Canada allocated a budget of $693.7 million to maintain its portfolio of 44 national parks, 964 places of national historic significance, and 4 national marine conservation areas. Out of these national historic sites, 167 are under the direct administration of Parks Canada.

===Attendance===
The park received 240,481 visitors during the 2012-2013 year; a decrease of 7% compared to 2011–2012. It is the most visited Parks Canada site in New Brunswick. Data from previous years reveal that 40% of people who camped at the park were from New Brunswick, 8% were from Nova Scotia or Prince Edward Island, and 52% were from outside the Maritimes. In 2005, visitors from outside of the Maritimes were 59% adult couples and 29% families; while visitors from the Maritimes were 67% families and 24% adult couples.

=== Infrastructure ===
New Brunswick Route 114 crosses and connects Route 1 to Fundy National Park, and is the primary route used by tourists coming from outside the province and country. In the past, this part of the road leading to the park has been described as having &quot;embarrassing&quot; conditions, filled with potholes and gashed pavement. Upgrades to this road has gone underway, with $4 million being spent in 2019 by the provincial and federal governments.

The park itself has a road network spanning 72 km, 34 km of which is paved, while the rest is covered by gravel. Two covered bridges are located within the park. The Forty Five River #1 covered bridge, built in 1914, leads to Forty-five Road. Its name comes from the river it crosses, Forty-five River, which was named due to it taking 45 minutes for water originating from upstream to reach the Alma River. The Point Wolfe Bridge, built in 1992, is located west of the park&#x27;s entrance and provides access to the Point Wolfe campground, which operates during the summer. The Point Wolfe Bridge started construction in 1991 after the original bridge, which was built in 1910, was destroyed in December 1990 following a construction accident.

==== Campgrounds ====

Fundy National Park features a total of five main campgrounds: Chignecto North, Headquarters, Cannontown, Point Wolfe, and Lakeview. These campgrounds vary in operation dates, with some lasting throughout the summer months and others lasting year-round. These campgrounds together offer a sum of 521 camping and trailer sites, which vary in terms of services. Some sites are unserviced, while others provide electricity and water, with some even offering sewage. Among these campgrounds, three offer a combined total of 33 oTENTik units, which resembles a combination between a tent and a rustic cabin. Additionally, the Headquarters campground provides five yurts, and two campgrounds collectively offer six Ôasis units, which resembles a tear drop and measures . A winter shelter is offered at Point Wolfe, which is used from November to April. In addition to the main campsites, Fundy National Park offers eight backcountry campsites, located at five bodies of water and operated from May through October. Year-round rustic cabins are also offered.

==== Trails ====

Fundy National Park includes 35 hiking trails spanning over , varying in length and difficulty. Additionally, the park is linked to two long hiking trails: the Dobson Trail (58 km) and the Fundy Footpath (64.3 km). The Dobson Trail connects the park to Riverview, while the Fundy Footpath leads to the Big Salmon River, located near St. Martins. Moreover, within Fundy Park itself, 48 km of interconnected trails form the Fundy Circuit, which loops around the park. Out of the 35 hiking trails located within the park, 15 of them are additionally accessible to mountain bikes. The park also features a pump track at the Chignecto Recreation Area.

===Amalgamation===
The park includes several communities when it was expropriated including:
*Hastings
*Upper Salmon River
*Butland Settlement

<doc id="209146" wikidata="Q2628773" url="?curid=209146" title="Pocket Full of Kryptonite">
<text>Pocket Full of Kryptonite is the debut studio album by the American rock band Spin Doctors, released in August 1991. The album initially sold a respectable 60,000 copies in late 1991 due to its growing hardcore fanbase, before several radio stations (including WEQX in Vermont) started playing the single &quot;Little Miss Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot; in mid-1992. The combined strength of the single along with the follow-up &quot;Two Princes&quot; led to the album&#x27;s peak at Nos. 1 and 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers and &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums charts, respectively. It is currently the band&#x27;s best selling album, and was certified 5× Platinum by the RIAA.

It was remastered and reissued in 2011 as a 20th-anniversary edition, with a bonus track added to the original album and a second disc of demos previously released only on cassette, plus two live tracks.

The album&#x27;s title is a quote from the opening track, &quot;Jimmy Olsen&#x27;s Blues&quot;, a humorous song sung from the point of view of Jimmy Olsen, a character in the &quot;Superman&quot; comic book series. In the song, Jimmy Olsen tries to woo Lois Lane away from Superman, stating &quot;I got a pocket full of Kryptonite,&quot; referring to a fictional substance that weakens Superman. The album cover, showing a phone booth, refers to Clark Kent frequently ducking into a nearby phone booth to change into his Superman attire.

<text>The water kingfishers or Cerylinae are one of the three subfamilies of kingfishers, and are also known as the cerylid kingfishers. All six American species are in this subfamily.

These are all specialist fish-eating species, unlike many representatives of the other two subfamilies, and it is likely that they are all descended from fish-eating kingfishers which founded populations in the New World. It was believed that the entire group evolved in the Americas, but this seems not to be true. The original ancestor possibly evolved in Africa – at any rate in the Old World – and the &quot;Chloroceryle&quot; species are the youngest ones.
==Phylogeny==
Evidence from molecular phylogenetic studies suggests that the Cerylinae originated in Asia and have colonised the New World on two occasions: the first time was around 8 million years ago by the &quot;Chloroceryle&quot; and the second time was around 1.9 million years ago by the common ancestor of the ringed kingfisher and the belted kingfisher in the genus &quot;Megaceryle&quot;.

The subfamily Cerylinae contains nine kingfisher species and is divided into three genera:

<text>&quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Police from their album &quot;Synchronicity&quot; (1983). Written by Sting, the single was the biggest US and Canadian hit of 1983, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart for eight weeks (the band&#x27;s only hit on that chart), and the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; chart for four weeks. Their fifth UK No. 1, it topped the UK singles chart for four weeks. The song also reached the top 10 in numerous other countries. In May 2019, it was recognised by BMI as being the most played song in radio history.

&quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; is the Police&#x27;s and Sting&#x27;s signature song, and in 2010 was estimated to generate between a quarter and a third of Sting&#x27;s music publishing income. At the 26th Annual Grammy Awards, the song was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Song of the Year, Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, and Record of the Year, winning in the first two categories. For the song, Sting received the 1983 Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.

In the 1983 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critics&#x27; and readers&#x27; poll, it was voted &quot;Song of the Year&quot;. In the US, it was the best-selling single of 1983 and fifth-best-selling single of the decade. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the song for 1983. The song was ranked on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and is included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. It also ranked number 25 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs. In 2008, &quot;Q&quot; magazine named it among the top 10 British Songs of the 1980s. In 2015, the song was voted by the British public as &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Favourite&quot; 1980s number one in a UK-wide poll for ITV.

==Origins and songwriting==
To escape the public eye, Sting retreated to the Caribbean. He started writing the song at Ian Fleming&#x27;s writing desk on the Goldeneye estate in Oracabessa, Jamaica. The lyrics are the words of a possessive lover who is watching &quot;every breath you take; every move you make&quot;. Sting recalled:

When asked why he appears angry in the music video, Sting told BBC Radio 2, &quot;I think the song is very, very sinister and ugly and people have actually misinterpreted it as being a gentle little love song, when it&#x27;s quite the opposite. Hence so.&quot; Gary T. Marx, sociologist and scholar of surveillance studies, wrote in 1988 that, while the song was &quot;a love rather than a protest song&quot;, it &quot;nicely captures elements of the new surveillance&quot;. He compared the lines to various new technologies of surveillance, including linking &quot;every breath you take&quot; to breath analyzers, &quot;every step you take&quot; to ankle monitors, and &quot;every vow you break&quot; to voice stress analysis.

According to the Phil Spector &quot;Back to Mono&quot; box-set book, &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; is influenced by a Gene Pitney song titled &quot;Every Breath I Take&quot;. Led Zeppelin&#x27;s song, &quot;D&#x27;yer Mak&#x27;er&quot; (1973), also contains the words &quot;every breath I take; every move I make&quot;.

==Recording==
The demo of the song was recorded in an eight-track suite in North London&#x27;s Utopia studios and featured Sting singing over a Hammond organ. A few months later, he presented the song to the other band members when they reconvened at George Martin&#x27;s AIR Studios in Montserrat to work on the &quot;Synchronicity&quot; album. The band initially tried the song in a variety of different styles and arrangements, such as reggae.

While recording, guitarist Andy Summers came up with a guitar part inspired by Béla Bartók that would later become a trademark lick, and played it straight through in one take. He was asked to put guitar onto a simple backing track of bass, drums, and a single vocal, with Sting offering no directive beyond &quot;make it your own&quot;. Summers remembered:

The recording process was fraught with difficulties as personal tensions between the band members, particularly Sting and drummer Stewart Copeland, came to the fore. Producer Hugh Padgham claimed that by the time of the recording sessions, Sting and Copeland &quot;hated each other&quot;, with verbal and physical fights in the studio common. The tensions almost led to the recording sessions being cancelled until a meeting involving the band and the group&#x27;s manager, Miles Copeland (Stewart&#x27;s brother), resulted in an agreement to continue.

The drum track was largely created through separate overdubs of each percussive instrument, with the kick drum coming from the box for the Oberheim DMX drum machine while the main backbeat was created by simultaneously playing a snare and a Tama gong drum. To give the song more liveliness, Padgham asked Copeland to record his drum part in the studio&#x27;s dining room in order to achieve some &quot;special sound effects&quot;. The room, however, was so hot that Copeland&#x27;s drum sticks had to be taped to his hands to avoid slippage.

A piano accompaniment consisting of individual notes was added to complete the song&#x27;s bridge. Padgham remembers that the band and he had &quot;agonized over that part for a long time&quot;. with Sting &quot;fiddling around on the piano, banging away on the same note&quot;. Padgham recalled a one-note guitar solo and its hypnotic effect in previous work with XTC, and suggested using a similar single-note piano accompaniment – concluding that the one-note line was &quot;kind of his idea in the end&quot;. However, in a 1984 interview, Padgham remembered Sting coming into the studio with a couple of one-note piano lines for the song – instead implying that they were Sting&#x27;s ideas and not his.

&quot;Cashbox&quot; described the song as &quot;a subtly crafted minor key ballad&quot; (although the song is actually in Ab major)and commented on the effect of the &quot;surprising, smokey smooth feel [of the vocal] above the band&#x27;s patently insistent rhythmic drive.&quot;

== Music video ==
The song had a music video (directed by duo Godley &amp; Creme) loosely based on Gjon Mili&#x27;s 1944 short film &quot;Jammin&#x27; the Blues&quot;. Shot in black-and-white with a navy blue tint, the video depicts the band, accompanied by a pianist and string section, performing the song in a darkened ballroom as a man washes the floor-to-ceiling window behind them. Sting performs his part on upright bass rather than bass guitar.

The video was praised for its cinematography; MTV (1999), &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (1993), and VH1 (2001) named it one of the best music videos ever, placing it 16th, 61st, &amp; 33rd in their respective top 100 lists. Daniel Pearl won the first MTV cinematography award for his work on the video. Released in the early days of MTV, &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; was one of the earliest videos to enter heavy rotation, which significantly contributed to the song&#x27;s popularity. Pop star Richard Marx remembers that &quot;the first video I watched over and over was &#x27;Every Breath You Take&#x27;. It was like seeing a Bergman film. Directors usually spelled out every word of the lyrics in a video, but this was the first video I knew that didn&#x27;t do that. It was abstract.&quot; According to A&amp;M Vice President of Marketing and Creative Services Jeff Ayeroff, &quot;[The video for] &#x27;Every Breath You Take&#x27; probably cost $75,000 to $100,000, and we sold over 5 million albums. With a good video, the return on your investment was phenomenal.&quot;

On 5 October 2022, Billboard officially released a statement confirming that the music video for &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; surpassed one billion views on YouTube.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; was released as a single in 1983, with B-side &quot;Murder by Numbers&quot; – a composition by Summers and Sting that had been omitted from the vinyl release of &quot;Synchronicity&quot; in favour of Copeland&#x27;s &quot;Miss Gradenko&quot; due to LP length limitations, only appearing as the final track on the CD and cassette. It reached No. 1 in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Israel, Ireland, and South Africa. In Canada, it spent four weeks at No. 1 and an additional six weeks at No. 2. It also reached No. 2 in Spain, Sweden, Norway and Australia, while reaching the Top 10 in most other Western, Northern and Southern European countries.

In the 1983 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critics and readers poll, it was voted &quot;Song of the Year&quot;. In the US, it was the best-selling single of 1983 and fifth-best-selling single of the decade. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the song for 1983.

The single became the biggest US and Canadian hit of 1983, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart for eight weeks (the band&#x27;s only hit on that chart). It also topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Tracks chart for nine weeks.

At the 26th Annual Grammy Awards, the song was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Song of the Year, Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, and Record of the Year, winning in the first two categories. Sting received the 1983 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.

== Legacy ==
Two cover versions charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart in 1983: Rich Landers at number 68 and Mason Dixon at number 69.

In 1999, &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; was listed as one of the Top 100 Songs of the Century by BMI. In May 2019, BMI updated the list and &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; was recognized as the Most Performed Song in BMI&#x27;s catalogue, a distinction previously held by &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;. In 2003, VH1 ranked the song the No. 2 greatest breakup song. As of 2003, Sting was making an average of $2000 per day in royalties for the song.

In 2001, &quot;The Sopranos&quot; episode &quot;Mr. Ruggerio&#x27;s Neighborhood&quot; features a mashup combining &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; with &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;.

In October 2007, Sting was awarded a Million-Air certificate for nine million airplays of &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; at the BMI Awards show in London.

&quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; is the Police&#x27;s and Sting&#x27;s signature song, and in 2010 was estimated to generate between a quarter and a third of Sting&#x27;s music publishing income. In May 2019, it was recognized by BMI as being the most played song in radio history. With nearly 15 million radio plays, Sting received a BMI Award at a ceremony held at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills to mark it being the Most Performed Song in BMI&#x27;s catalogue. BMI President and CEO Mike O&#x27;Neill stated: &quot;For the first time in 22 years, BMI has a new top song in our repertoire with Sting&#x27;s timeless hit &#x27;Every Breath You Take,&#x27; a remarkable achievement that solidifies its place in songwriting history.&quot;

In 2004, the song was ranked on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, although it was moved down to in their 2021 update of the list. &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; is included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. It also ranked number 25 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs. In 2008, &quot;Q&quot; magazine named it among the top 10 British Songs of the 1980s. In 2015, the song was voted by the British public as the nation&#x27;s favourite 1980s number one in a UK-wide poll for ITV.

The song is sampled in Puff Daddy&#x27;s 1997 hit &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Missing You,&quot; which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 11 weeks and won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group; Sting ultimately participated in a performance of &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Missing You&quot; at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards.

According to Copeland in 2000:

The song made a comeback as it was featured in the Snow Ball dance scene in Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot; season 2 which Eleven and Mike Wheeler dances to. Every Breath You Take became popular with Generation Z and it appeared in videos on TikTok. The scene also won for MTV Movie Award for Best Musical Moment at the 2018 MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards.

In the same interview, Copeland said Summers should get songwriting credit for &quot;Every Breath You Take.&quot; In October 2023, Summers revealed that despite contributing the guitar riff that &quot;has become a kind of immortal guitar part that all guitar players have to learn&quot;, he is still pursuing a &quot;contentious&quot; battle with Sting over &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; songwriting credits. He said that the song was originally &quot;going in the trash until I played on it.&quot; He also hinted at a legal battle over the song&#x27;s songwriting credits. &quot;Watch the press; let&#x27;s see what happens in the next year. That&#x27;s all I can tell you.&quot;

==Accolades==
It is listed as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. On the 50th anniversary of the Billboard Hot 100 Chart, the song was ranked No. 25 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The All-Time Top 100 Songs&quot; chart.

<doc id="209150" wikidata="Q2531186" url="?curid=209150" title="Kissing to Be Clever">
<text>Kissing to Be Clever is the debut album by the English band Culture Club, released on 
8 October 1982 in the United Kingdom. It includes Culture Club&#x27;s international breakthrough hit single, &quot;Do You Really Want to Hurt Me&quot;, which reached number one in the band&#x27;s native UK and the top 10 of many charts around the world. The album has reportedly sold over 4 million copies worldwide, including over 1 million in the US where it has been certified Platinum by the RIAA.

==Overview==
The album&#x27;s first two singles were &quot;White Boy&quot; (which failed to crack the US or UK charts), and &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Me&quot; (which peaked at No. 100 in the UK). But with the release of &quot;Do You Really Want to Hurt Me&quot;, the band scored a number one hit in over a dozen countries, and the song also hit the top 10 in several other countries including number two in the U.S. The album itself spent 88 weeks on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, reaching its peak position of number 14 in March 1983 in the US. The follow-up single, &quot;Time (Clock of the Heart)&quot;, became a US number two and UK top three hit. This song appeared on the US version of the album but not initially on the UK version. Another single was released in North America, &quot;I&#x27;ll Tumble 4 Ya&quot;, which became the group&#x27;s third consecutive top 10 single in the US. This gave Culture Club the distinction of being the first band since The Beatles to have three top 10 hits from a debut album in the US.

&quot;Kissing to Be Clever&quot; was remastered and re-released in 2003 on CD. This edition contains the song &quot;Romance Beyond the Alphabet&quot;, which is the orchestral instrumental version of &quot;Time (Clock of the Heart), also included on &quot;Culture Club Collect – 12&quot; Mixes Plus&quot; and its subsequent re-release &quot;Culture Club Remix Collection&quot; as &quot;Time (Clock of the Heart) (Instrumental Mix)&quot;. The 2003 release of the album has the restoration of the original colour cover which had been replaced by a black-and-white picture of lead singer Boy George on previous versions.

==Reception==

Reviews for &quot;Kissing to Be Clever&quot; have been generally positive. AllMusic&#x27;s Lindsay Planer noted that it &quot;was embraced by not only post-disco dance music enthusiasts, but also new wave listeners and pop fans as well.&quot; He also stated that the singles &quot;provide accurate thumbnail sketches of what Culture Club were capable of pulling off musically.&quot; He concluded by saying: &quot;From the light and buoyant Philly soul-inspired string arrangement to the effervescent and singalongable chorus, the melody foreshadowed a similar vibe that would carry over to their sophomore long-player, &quot;Colour by Numbers&quot;.&quot;

Contemporary reviews were generally favourable. &quot;Smash Hits&quot;&#x27; Beverly Hillier gave the album a 9 out of 10 rating calling it &quot;a first class record&quot;. Hillier found the songs &quot;well crafted and the musicianship is excellent throughout&quot; and pointed out Boy George&#x27;s voice as &quot;the band&#x27;s strongest asset.&quot; &quot;Disco, salsa, reggae and Caribbean rhythms are all used but with such obvious love and respect for their roots that nobody can accuse them of plagiarism. On this showing Culture Club will easily outlive the fashionable wave they&#x27;re riding on at the moment.&quot;

Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote that &quot;for all [Culture Club&#x27;s] fashionability I think their hearts are in the right place&quot;. However, he stated that &quot;their bland Caribbean rhythms move no muscles, and their confrontations with racial issues are rarely more than a phrase deep.&quot; Lloyd Sachs of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that the album &quot;positively jumps, from the pleasure-seeking masochism of &quot;Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?&quot; to the fearful soul-searching of &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Me&quot; to the shady &quot;I&#x27;ll Tumble 4 Ya&quot;&quot;. He further stated that &quot;[Boy George&#x27;s] vocal &quot;normalcy&quot; [plays] against the provocative content of the material.&quot; He concluded that &quot;the beat does special service to the message – even when we don&#x27;t quite know what that message is.&quot;

<doc id="209151" wikidata="Q484131" url="?curid=209151" title="Coraciiformes">
<text>The Coraciiformes are a group of usually colourful birds including the kingfishers, the bee-eaters, the rollers, the motmots, and the todies. They generally have syndactyly, with three forward-pointing toes (and toes 3 &amp; 4 fused at their base), though in many kingfishers one of these is missing. The members of this order are linked by their &quot;slamming&quot; behaviour, thrashing their prey onto surfaces to disarm or incapacitate them.

In the past, Coraciiformes encompassed all anisodactyl (including syndactyl) members of the Cavitaves. This means that the birds currently classified in Leptosomiformes (cuckoo-roller) and Bucerotiformes (hornbills, hoopoes and allies) were formerly classified in Coraciiformes.

This is largely an Old World order, with the representation in the New World limited to the dozen or so species of todies and motmots, and a mere handful of the more than a hundred species of kingfishers.

The name Coraciiformes means &quot;raven-like&quot;. Specifically, it comes from the Latin language &quot;corax&quot;, meaning &quot;raven&quot; and Latin &quot;forma&quot;, meaning &quot;form&quot;.

==Systematics==

The phylogenetic relationships between the six families in the order Coraciiformes is shown below. The cladogram is based on a large study by Richard Prum and colleagues published in 2015. The number of species in each family is taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).
Several extinct coraciiform families are only known from Paleogene fossils. They probably belong to the basal group and are sometimes difficult to assign because they were even closer still to the Piciformes (&quot;see also&quot; &quot;Neanis&quot;). In addition, there are some prehistoric genera which are likewise difficult to place into a family. At least the Eocoraciidae are very basal, but the Late Eocene (some 35 mya) Geranopteridae form a superfamily Coracioidea with the extant rollers and ground-rollers already (Mayr &amp; Mourer-Chauviré 2000). A few prehistoric taxa of the present-day families have been described; see the family articles for details.

==Taxonomic sequence==
* Unresolved
** Genus &quot;Quasisyndactylus&quot; (fossil; Middle Eocene of Messel, Germany) - alcediniform, basal?
** Genus &quot;Cryptornis&quot; (fossil; Late Eocene of France) – bucerotid? geranopterid?
** Family Primobucconidae (fossil), including &quot;Primobucco&quot; and &quot;Septencoracias&quot;
** Coraciiformes gen. et spp. indet. PQ 1216, QU 15640 (fossil; Late Eocene of Quercy, France: Mayr &amp; Mourer-Chauviré 2000)
** Genus &quot;Protornis&quot; (fossil: Oligocene of Switzerland) – basal to motmotids and meropids?

A recent study suggest that the following families may belong to a separate order called Bucerotiformes. The results still in dispute though.
* Family Bucorvidae (ground hornbills)
* Family Bucerotidae (hornbills)
* Family Upupidae (hoopoe)
* Family Phoeniculidae (woodhoopoes)

The Leptosomidae (cuckoo roller) probably do not belong here. The trogons are sometimes placed here as a family Trogonidae. The Late Eocene Palaeospizidae are sometimes also placed in the Coraciiformes, as are the Early to Middle Eocene Primobucconidae and the Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene Sylphornithidae. The Primobucconidae at least indeed seem to belong here.

<text>In Boolean logic, logical NOR, non-disjunction, or joint denial is a truth-functional operator which produces a result that is the negation of logical or. That is, a sentence of the form (&quot;p&quot; NOR &quot;q&quot;) is true precisely when neither &quot;p&quot; nor &quot;q&quot; is true—i.e. when both &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are &quot;false&quot;. It is logically equivalent to formula_1 and formula_2, where the symbol formula_3 signifies logical negation, formula_4 signifies OR, and formula_5 signifies AND.

Non-disjunction is usually denoted as formula_6 or formula_7 or formula_8 (prefix) or formula_9.

As with its dual, the NAND operator (also known as the Sheffer stroke—symbolized as either formula_10, formula_11 or formula_12), NOR can be used by itself, without any other logical operator, to constitute a logical formal system (making NOR functionally complete).

The computer used in the spacecraft that first carried humans to the moon, the Apollo Guidance Computer, was constructed entirely using NOR gates with three inputs.

==Definition==
The NOR operation is a logical operation on two logical values, typically the values of two propositions, that produces a value of &quot;true&quot; if and only if both operands are false. In other words, it produces a value of &quot;false&quot; if and only if at least one operand is true.

===Truth table===
The truth table of formula_13 is as follows:

===Logical equivalences===
The logical NOR formula_6 is the negation of the disjunction:

==Alternative notations and names==
Peirce is the first to show the functional completeness of non-disjunction while he doesn&#x27;t publish his result. Peirce used formula_15 for non-conjunction and formula_16 for non-disjunction (in fact, what Peirce himself used is formula_16 and he didn&#x27;t introduce formula_15 while Peirce&#x27;s editors made such disambiguated use). Peirce called formula_16 the (from Ancient Greek , , &quot;cutting both ways&quot;).

In 1911, was the first to publish a description of both non-conjunction (using formula_20, the Stamm hook), and non-disjunction (using formula_21, the Stamm star), and showed their functional completeness. Note that most uses in logical notation of formula_20 use this for negation.

In 1913, Sheffer described non-disjunction and showed its functional completeness. Sheffer used formula_11 for non-conjunction, and formula_24 for non-disjunction.

In 1935, Webb described non-disjunction for formula_25-valued logic, and use formula_11 for the operator. So some people call it Webb operator, Webb operation or Webb function.

In 1940, Quine also described non-disjunction and use formula_6 for the operator. So some people call the operator Peirce arrow or Quine dagger.

In 1944, Church also described non-disjunction and use formula_7 for the operator.

In 1954, Bocheński used formula_8 in formula_30 for non-disjunction in Polish notation.

==Properties==
NOR is commutative but not associative, which means that formula_31 but formula_32.

===Functional completeness===
The logical NOR, taken by itself, is a functionally complete set of connectives. This can be proved by first showing, with a truth table, that formula_33 is truth-functionally equivalent to formula_34. Then, since formula_13 is truth-functionally equivalent to formula_36, and formula_37 is equivalent to formula_38, the logical NOR suffices to define the set of connectives formula_39, which is shown to be truth-functionally complete by the Disjunctive Normal Form Theorem.

This may also be seen from the fact that Logical NOR does not possess any of the five qualities (truth-preserving, false-preserving, linear, monotonic, self-dual) required to be absent from at least one member of a set of functionally complete operators.

==Other Boolean operations in terms of the logical NOR==
NOR has the interesting feature that all other logical operators can be expressed by interlaced NOR operations. The logical NAND operator also has this ability.

Expressed in terms of NOR formula_6, the usual operators of propositional logic are:

<text>Carleton College ( ) is a private liberal arts college in Northfield, Minnesota, United States. Founded in 1866, the main campus is between Northfield and the approximately Cowling Arboretum, which became part of the campus in the 1920s.

The college offers courses from 33 major programs and 38 minor programs, and has the option for students to design their own majors. Carleton&#x27;s varsity sports compete at the NCAA Division III level in the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.

== History ==
The school was founded in 1866, when the Minnesota Conference of Congregational Churches unanimously accepted a resolution to locate a college in Northfield. Two Northfield businessmen, Charles Augustus Wheaton and Charles Moorehouse Goodsell, each donated of land for the first campus. The first students enrolled at the preparatory unit of Northfield College in the fall of 1867. In 1870, the first college president, James Strong, traveled to the East Coast to raise funds for the college. On his way from visiting a potential donor, William Carleton of Charlestown, Massachusetts, Strong was badly injured in a collision between his carriage and a train. Impressed by Strong&#x27;s survival of the accident, Carleton donated $50,000 to the fledgling institution in 1871. As a result, the Board of Trustees renamed the school to Carleton College in his honor.
The first graduating class was in 1874 and consisted of James J. Dow and Myra A. Brown, who married each other later that year. A third student, Bayard T. Holmes, had originally been in the same class, but withdrew before graduating. 

On September 7, 1876, the James-Younger Gang, led by outlaw Jesse James, tried to rob the First National Bank of Northfield. Joseph Lee Heywood, Carleton&#x27;s Treasurer, was acting cashier at the bank that day. He was shot and killed for refusing to open the safe, foiling the attempt. Carleton later named a library fund after Heywood. The Heywood Society is the name for a group of donors who have named Carleton in their wills.

In its early years under the presidency of James Strong, Carleton reflected the theological conservatism of its Minnesota Congregational founders. In 1903, modern religious influences were introduced by William Sallmon, a Yale Divinity School graduate, who was hired as college president. Sallmon was opposed by conservative faculty members and alumni, and left the presidency by 1908. After Sallmon left, the trustees hired Donald J. Cowling, another theologically liberal Yale Divinity School graduate, as his successor. In 1916, under Cowling&#x27;s leadership, Carleton began an official affiliation with the Minnesota Baptist Convention. It lasted until 1928, when the Baptists severed the relationship as a result of fundamentalist opposition to Carleton&#x27;s liberalism, including the college&#x27;s support for teaching evolution. Non-denominational for a number of years, in 1964 Carleton abolished its requirement for weekly attendance at some religious or spiritual meeting.

In 1927, students founded the first student-run pub in the nation, The Cave. Located in the basement of Evans Hall, it continues to host live music shows and other events several times each week.In 1942, Carleton purchased land in Stanton, about east of campus, to use for flight training. During World War II, several classes of male students went through air basic training at the college. Since being sold by the college in 1944, the Stanton Airfield has been operated for commercial use.

The world premiere production of the English translation of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s play, &quot;The Caucasian Chalk Circle&quot;, was performed in 1948 at Carleton&#x27;s Little Nourse Theater.

In 1963, Carleton students founded the Reformed Druids of North America, initially as a means to be excused from attendance of then-mandatory weekly chapel service. Within a few years, the group evolved to engage in legitimate spiritual exploration. Its legacy remains in campus location names such as the Stone Circle (commonly called &quot;the Druid Circle&quot;) and the Hill of the Three Oaks. Meetings continue to be held in the Carleton College Cowling Arboretum.

President Bill Clinton gave the last commencement address of his administration at Carleton, on June 10, 2000, marking the first presidential visit to the college.

==Academics==
Carleton is a small, liberal arts college offering 33 different majors and 37 minors, and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Students also have the option to design their own major. Ten languages are offered: Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Arabic, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. The academic calendar follows a trimester system in which students usually take three classes per 10-week term.

Degree students are required to take an Argument &amp; Inquiry Seminar in their first year, a writing-rich course, three quantitative reasoning encounters (courses in which students work with quantitative data and arguments), language, international studies, intercultural domestic studies, humanistic inquiry, literary/artistic analysis, arts practice, science, formal or statistical reasoning, social inquiry, and physical education.

The average class size at Carleton is 16 students. Carleton is one of the few liberal arts colleges to run on the trimester system. The most popular majors, by 2023 graduates, were:
::Computer Science (69)
::Biology/Biological Science (61)
::Chemistry (35)
::International Relations and Affairs (34)
::Econometrics and Quantitative Economics (30)
::Research and Experimental Psychology (29)
::Mathematics (25)
::English Language &amp; Literature (22)
::Sociology and Anthropology (22)

Studying abroad is common at Carleton: 76% of the senior class of 2018 studied abroad at least once over their four years. Carleton offers a number of its own programs each year, which are led by Carleton faculty and available only to Carleton students. In 2017–2018, 17 such programs were offered. Although many students opt to go on a Carleton-specific program, because full financial aid and academic credits can transfer to other programs, many students choose to study with other schools or organizations.

===Admissions===

Admission to Carleton has been categorized as &quot;most selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The class of 2028 admittance rate was 17.9% of all applicants, making Carleton the most selective college in Minnesota.

Carleton has a strong history of enrolling students who are in the National Merit Scholarship Program, often enrolling more than any other liberal arts college in the nation. The class of 2026 included 38 National Merit Scholars.

===Rankings===
Carleton has been in the top 10 liberal arts colleges since 1997 in the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings. For 2025, it ranks tied for 8th overall, 1st for &quot;Best Undergraduate Teaching&quot;, and 17th for &quot;Best Value&quot;. In 2019, the &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ratings — using criteria of social mobility, research, and service — ranked Carleton the 24th best college in the liberal arts college category. In the 2019 &quot;Forbes&quot; ranking of 650 American colleges, which combines liberal arts colleges, service academies and national research universities, Carleton is ranked 52nd.

&quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance&quot; places Carleton 13th in its 2019 ranking of the 149 best value liberal arts colleges in the United States. Carleton was ranked 5th in the 2015 Brookings Institution list of &quot;Four-Year or Higher Colleges With the Highest Value-Added With Respect to Mid-Career Earnings&quot;, with Carleton adding an estimated 43% in value, raising the predicted mid-career salary of $76,236 to $117,700. In a 2012 study of higher education institutions, Carleton was listed as the most chosen as a peer institution, followed by Princeton and Oberlin.

===Graduates===
In the 2023–2024 school year, 14 Carleton graduates obtained a Fulbright grant from 54 applications. Among liberal arts colleges, the school is a &quot;Top Producer of Fulbright Awards for American Students&quot;. Carleton has produced 75 Watson Fellows.

Of those who applied, on average over 80% of Carleton graduates are accepted to medical school and about 90% to law school. Within five years of graduating, between 65% and 75% of graduates pursue postgraduate studies. The 15 most common graduate or professional schools attended by Carleton students are University of Minnesota–Twin Cities, University of Wisconsin–Madison, University of Michigan–Ann Arbor, Harvard, University of Chicago, University of Washington, Columbia, UC Berkeley, Northwestern, NYU, Yale, and Stanford. The most commonly pursued graduate programs are law, medicine, education, business administration, history, and chemistry.

Over 20% of all Carleton graduates since 1990 work in the business/finance/sales sector. Over 10% work in either healthcare or higher education. Pre K-12 education accounts for about 9% of graduates. Carleton graduates with only a bachelor&#x27;s degree have an average mid-career salary of $113,800, according to self-reported data from PayScale.

==Student life==
===Student body===
Carleton typically enrolls about 2,000 students, with roughly equal numbers of women and men.

As of 2016, 26.5% of the total student population are domestic students of color, 10.9% are among the first generation in their family to attend college, and 83.5% are U.S. citizens from out of state.

10.2% of students are international, with the most represented countries being China (4.3%), South Korea (0.8%), India (0.7%), Canada (0.7%), and Japan (0.4%).

===Extracurricular organizations===

The school&#x27;s nearly 240 active student organizations include three theater boards (coordinating as many as ten productions every term), long-form and short-form improv groups and a sketch comedy troupe, six &quot;a cappella&quot; groups, four choirs, seven specialized instrumental ensembles, five dance interest groups, two auditioned dance companies, a successful Mock Trial team, a nationally competitive debate program, and the student-run 24-hour KRLX radio station, which employs more than 200 volunteers each term.

In five of the last twelve years, Carleton College students received the Best Delegation award at the World Model United Nations competition. In the 2013–2014 academic year, the school&#x27;s team ranked among the top 25 in the nation.

==== Student publications ====

&quot;The Carletonian&quot; is the school&#x27;s student newspaper. It was founded in 1877 and renamed &quot;The Carletonia&quot; from June 1881 until November 12, 1921, when it regained its original title. The paper was originally published annually, then monthly or semi-monthly until fall 1910, when it began regular weekly publication. From January to September 1977, the paper was published daily under the title &quot;The Carleton Daily&quot;, after which time it reverted to weekly publication as &quot;The Carletonian.&quot; Currently, it is distributed weekly on Fridays during the school year.

&quot;The Cow Print&quot; is a satire magazine at Carleton, published and distributed fortnightly. It was founded in 1999 as &quot;The Carl&quot;, an arts and culture supplement to &quot;The Carletonian,&quot; and renamed &quot;The Cow Print&quot; in May 2021. 

&quot;The Carleton Literary Association Paper (The CLAP)&quot; is a weekly satire publication, distributed on Fridays during convocation time. The magazine is printed in grayscale, on 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; paper instead of traditional newsprint. &quot;The CLAP&quot; is notable for accepting any and all student submissions, allowing any student to have their opinions and jokes published without censorship.

===Traditions===
Carleton has numerous student traditions and a long history of student pranks, including painting the college&#x27;s water tower. Notably, a likeness of President Clinton was painted on the tower the night before his commencement speech in 2000. Early the following morning, college maintenance staff painted over it (although in his speech, Clinton mentioned his amusement and regret it had been covered before he could see it).

==== Schiller bust ====

A bust of Friedrich Schiller, known simply as &quot;Schiller&quot;, has made regular, brief appearances at large campus events. The tradition dates back to 1956, when two students absconded with the bust from Scoville Library while books were being transferred to the new library. &quot;Schiller&quot; resided in their dorm rooms for a period, only to have the bust taken from them. Possession of the bust escalated into an elaborate competition, which took on a high degree of secrecy and strategy.

Schiller&#x27;s public appearances, accompanied with a cry of &quot;Schiller!&quot;, are a tacit challenge to other students to capture the bust. The currently circulating bust of Schiller was retrieved from Puebla, Mexico in the summer of 2003. In 2006, students created an online scavenger hunt, made up of a series of complex riddles about Carleton, which led participants to Schiller&#x27;s hidden location. The bust was stolen from the winner of the scavenger hunt. At commencement in 2006, the holders of the bust arranged for Schiller to &quot;graduate&quot;. When his name was called at the appropriate moment, the bust was pulled from behind the podium and displayed.

In March 2010, the bust of Schiller appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. The appearance was organized by custodians of Schiller who contacted Peter Gwinn, a Carleton alumnus who was a writer for the program. The bust also appeared on a Halloween broadcast of &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; on Minnesota Public Radio.

====Rotblatt====
In 1964, Carleton students named an intramural slow-pitch softball league after Marv Rotblatt, a former Chicago White Sox pitcher. Although traditional intramural softball is still played at Carleton, the name &quot;Rotblatt&quot; now refers to a campus-wide annual beer softball game that is played with one inning for every year of the school&#x27;s existence. The game begins at sunrise and lasts until the slated number of innings have been completed for that year. The only rule for gameplay is that all players must have a cup in one hand. In 1997, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; honored Rotblatt in its &quot;Best of Everything&quot; section with the award, &quot;Longest Intramural Event&quot;. Rotblatt himself attended the game several times over the course of his life and appreciated the tradition.

==== Friday Flowers ====
A highly visible campus tradition is &quot;Friday Flowers&quot;, where students can purchase individual flowers from a local florist and place them in one another&#x27;s mailboxes each Friday of term. This tradition was in the news after three students died in a car accident en route to a frisbee tournament in 2014. Students at the nearby St. Olaf College sent over Friday Flowers for each student&#x27;s mailbox. Later that fall, after a St. Olaf student died, Carleton returned the gesture.

==== Freshman Frisbee Toss ====
Every first year student receives a frisbee on their first day of orientation. The design of the disc changes from year to year but always includes a penguin and the graduating year. At the Frisbee Toss Ceremony, students write their name on the frisbee, gather on the Bald Spot in a circle and throw their discs. This officially marks the beginning of a student&#x27;s time at Carleton. After the toss, each new student collects a disc and eventually returns it to the original owner in the hopes of making a new friend.

==== Beer Olympics ====
Each spring term since at least 2002 a number of Carleton students have participated in Beer Olympics (BO). In recent years, over 100 students have competed. BO is a competition that spans two days and consists of a series of events involving chugging beer (usually Hamms). These events include the frisbee, in which two students chug four beers out of a frisbee placed on the floor; the high-jump, in which a single student chugs up to eight beers out of a one-story-tall beer bong; and the 40-40, in which a student chugs a 40-ounce beer and runs a 40-yard dash.

Every year, a commission of students is elected to plan and organize Beer Olympics. The commission rotates every year, and any changes to the rules must be ratified and explained in the Beer Olympics Manifesto, which as of 2019 was 11 pages long.

==== Farmstock ====
Every spring since 1979, Carleton students have organized a music festival called Farmstock. Originally a small event with a picnic and acoustic music, the event has evolved into an all-campus affair, featuring the roasting of a whole pig and a full day of live music. The event takes place in the backyard of Farm House—Carleton&#x27;s sustainability interest house—and is planned and organized by Farm students.

==Campus==

The college campus was created in 1867 with the gifts of two parcels from local businessmen Charles M. Goodsell and Charles Augustus Wheaton. The school campus is on a hill overlooking the Cannon River, at the northeast edge of Northfield. To the north and east is the Cowling Arboretum, which was farm fields in the early years of the college.

The Jo Ryo En Japanese Garden is located behind Watson Hall in the center of the campus.

===Campus buildings===
Several of Carleton&#x27;s older buildings have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Willis Hall, the first building on campus, was constructed from 1869 to 1872. Originally the hall contained the men&#x27;s dormitory, classrooms, library, and chapel. The building was gutted by fire in 1879, after which it was entirely rebuilt within the existing stone shell. The original front of the building became the rear entrance with the construction of Severance Hall in 1928. As new buildings were constructed, various academic departments cycled through the building. Beginning in 1954, Willis served as the college student union, until it was replaced in 1979 by the Sayles-Hill Student Center, a converted gymnasium. Willis Hall now houses the Economics, Political Science, and Educational Studies offices.

Goodsell Observatory, also on the NRHP, was constructed in 1887 and at the time was the largest observatory in the state of Minnesota. It was named for Charles Goodsell, who donated land for the campus. From the late 19th century to the end of World War II, Goodsell Observatory kept the time for every major railroad west of the Mississippi River, including Northern Pacific Railway, the Great Northern Railway, the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad, and the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway.

Scoville Hall (originally Scoville Memorial Library), completed in 1896, is on the NRHP. Replaced in function by the Gould Library in the 1950s, Scoville was adapted for administrative space.
Four nineteenth-century buildings have been demolished. Gridley Hall (1882) was the main women&#x27;s dormitory for many years, and was torn down in 1967 for construction of the Music and Drama Center. Williams Hall (1880) was the college&#x27;s first science building, and was demolished in 1961. Seccombe House (1880) was used for music instruction until 1914, and was located near the site of the current Skinner Chapel. The first observatory (1878) was replaced by Goodsell Observatory in 1887, and the old building was demolished in 1905 to make way for Laird Hall.

Laird Hall was built for science classes in 1905; the classical-revival building now houses the English department and administrative offices, including the president&#x27;s office. Sayles-Hill was built as the first school gymnasium in 1910, and converted to a student center in 1979.

The eclectic styles of the eight buildings that made up the college in 1914, when Donald Cowling became president, were replaced by a uniform Collegiate Gothic style for the nine buildings erected during his tenure. Skinner Memorial Chapel, completed in 1916, is on the NRHP. Three connected western dorms were built for men: Burton Hall (1915), Davis Hall (1923), and Severance Hall (1928), and two residence halls were built for women: Nourse Hall (1917) and Margaret Evans Hall (1927). Evans Hall was notable for decades for its subdivision into adjacent columns of rooms off stairwells, rather than the more typical arrangement of floors of rooms on hallways. In the fall of 2012, Evans was heavily refurbished to modernize the internal layout and increase overall occupancy. Music Hall was built in 1914, and since the construction of the Music &amp; Drama Center in 1967 has been referred to as Old Music Hall. Laird Stadium which stands at the site of the football and track field, was built in 1927. Leighton Hall (1920), originally built for the Chemistry department, now houses academic and administrative offices, including the business office.
The Great Depression and World War II essentially ended the construction boom for two decades. Boliou Hall was built in 1949 in a modernist style, using yellow sandstone as a major element. It was enlarged using a similar style and materials in the early 1990s. The Library was built in 1956 in a similar style, but was expanded in a brick-based style in the mid-1980s. It was renamed the Gould Memorial Library in 1995 for former President Larry Gould. Musser and Myers Halls were built in 1958 as men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s dorms respectively, in a bare-bones modernist brick style.

Minoru Yamasaki, architect of the Northwestern National Life Building in Minneapolis and of the original New York World Trade Center, designed five buildings at Carleton in the 1960s. Olin Hall of Science (1961) has a distinctive &quot;radiator&quot; grill work on the exterior. Goodhue (1962) and Watson (1966) Halls were built as dormitories. At seven floors, Watson is the tallest building on campus. The West Gym (1964) and Cowling Gym (1965) were built to replace Sayles-Hill for indoor athletic facilities, originally for men and women respectively.

In the fall of 2022, Old Music Hall was renovated and reopened as Hasenstab Hall.

===Cowling Arboretum===
Since 1970, acreage has been removed from cultivation in sections. The Arboretum has approximately of restored and remnant forest, Cannon River floodplain, bur oak (&quot;Quercus macrocarpa&quot;) savannah, and tallgrass prairie. The Arboretum is divided by Minnesota Highway 19 into the larger Lower Arb to the north (so-called because it includes the Cannon River valley) and the smaller Upper Arb. Pedestrian trails are located throughout the Arboretum, as well as the school&#x27;s cross-country running and skiing courses, and a paved mixed-use bicycle/running trail in the Upper Arb.

===Sustainability===
The College Sustainability Report Card, which evaluated 200 colleges and universities with the largest endowments in the United States and Canada, Carleton received a grade of A−, earning the award of &quot;Overall College Sustainability Leader&quot;. A wind turbine located near the campus generates the equivalent of up to 40 percent of Carleton&#x27;s electrical energy use; it is configured to sell this power back to the local grid for the most efficient use system wide. In late 2011, Carleton installed a second wind turbine that provides power directly to the campus, providing more than 25 percent of the college&#x27;s electrical energy use.

==Athletics==
The Carleton athletic teams are called the Knights. The college is a member of the NCAA Division III ranks, primarily competing in the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) since the 1983–84 academic year; which they were a member on a previous stint from 1920–21 to 1924–25. The Knights previously competed in the Midwest Conference (MWC) from 1925–26 to 1982–83; although Carleton had dual conference membership with the MWC and the MIAC between 1921–22 and 1924–25.

All students must participate in physical education or athletic activities to fulfill graduation requirements.

===Rivalries===
Carleton&#x27;s biggest athletic rival is St. Olaf College, located on the other side of Northfield. The Knights and the Oles contest six trophies in yearly matchups. The first trophy, &quot;The Goat&quot;, was created in 1913 and goes to the winning men&#x27;s basketball team. Carleton competes with Macalester College in the &quot;Brain Bowl&quot; for &quot;The Book of Knowledge&quot; trophy.

===Club sports===
The student-run Ultimate clubs have had national success; the school&#x27;s top men&#x27;s team, Carleton Ultimate Team (CUT), and women&#x27;s team, Syzygy, are perennial national contenders in the USA Ultimate College Division I tournaments. CUT has qualified annually for nationals since 1989, and won the National Championship in 2001, 2009, 2011, and 2017. Syzygy has qualified for women&#x27;s nationals all but one year since 1987, and won the National Championship in 2000. The other men&#x27;s Ultimate team, the Gods of Plastic, won the 2010 and 2012 College Division III Open National Championships, and the other women&#x27;s Ultimate team, Eclipse, won the College Division III Women&#x27;s nationals in 2011, 2016, and 2017. Carleton founded the first women&#x27;s rugby club in the state of Minnesota in 1978 and went on to win the Division III National Championship in 2011.

==In popular culture==
Pamela Dean set her fantasy novel &quot;Tam Lin&quot; (1991) at a fictional &quot;Blackstock College&quot;, based on Dean&#x27;s alma mater, Carleton. Dean&#x27;s author&#x27;s note begins, &quot;Readers acquainted with Carleton College will find much that is familiar to them in the architecture, landscape, classes, terminology, and general atmosphere of Blackstock.&quot; Blackstock&#x27;s buildings were given names that reference their counterparts at Carleton (e.g. Watson Hall becomes Holmes Hall, referring to Sherlock Holmes; Burton Hall becomes Taylor Hall, referring to the marriages of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor).

The educational video game series The Oregon Trail was initially created by three Carleton students.

The 1996 film D3: The Mighty Ducks was partially filmed on Carleton&#x27;s campus.

Ben Wyatt, a character from NBC&#x27;s &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, graduated from Carleton with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science.

<text>José Montserrate Feliciano García (; born September 10, 1945) is a Puerto Rican musician. He recorded many international hits, including his rendition of the Doors&#x27; &quot;Light My Fire&quot; and his self-penned Christmas song &quot;&quot;. Music genres he explores consist of fusion of many styles, such as Latin, blues, jazz, soul and rock music, created primarily with the help of his signature acoustic guitar sound.

In the United States, Feliciano became popular in the 1960s, particularly after his 1968 album &quot;Feliciano!&quot; reached number 2 on the music charts. Since then in his career, he released over 50 albums worldwide in both English and Spanish languages.

== Early life and family ==

José Montserrate Feliciano Garcia was born on September 10, 1945, in Lares, Puerto Rico, the fourth child of eleven sons. He was born blind as a result of congenital glaucoma. He was first exposed to music at the age of three, playing on a cracker tin can while accompanying his uncle who played the cuatro. When Feliciano was five, his family moved to Spanish Harlem, New York City, where he made his first public appearance at the Teatro Puerto Rico in The Bronx.

Feliciano&#x27;s knack for music became apparent when at age seven, he taught himself to play the accordion. About two years later, when he was nine years old, his father gave him his first guitar. He would play his guitar by himself in his room for up to 14 hours a day and would learn by listening to 1950s rock and roll, records of classical guitarists, and jazz players. Andrés Segovia and Wes Montgomery were among his favorites. As a teenager, Feliciano took classical guitar lessons with Harold Morris, a staff music teacher at The Light House School for the Blind in New York City. Morris himself had once been a student of Segovia. In a 1969 interview, Feliciano mentioned soul music in general, and Ray Charles and Sam Cooke in particular, as influences on his singing.

At the age of 17, to help support his family, Feliciano left high school. He started frequenting the coffee houses of Greenwich Village, &quot;passing the hat&quot; as his &quot;salary&quot; in those clubs where he was invited to play. His first professional contracted performance was at The Retort, a coffee house in Detroit, Michigan.

==Career==
===1960s===
In 1963, while gaining recognition in pubs, coffee houses and clubs throughout the US and Canada, especially in Greenwich Village, New York, and Vancouver, British Columbia, he was discovered while performing at Gerde&#x27;s Folk City in the Village and immediately signed by Jack Somer, an executive at RCA Victor. Feliciano recounts the story of doing an impression of Bob Dylan, only to find that Dylan was in the audience. In 1964, he released his first single, &quot;Everybody Do the Click&quot; (which became a hit in the Philippines, at No. 2, staying 14 weeks in the Top Ten Hit parade) and was invited to the 1964 Newport Folk Festival. In 1965 and 1966, he released his first albums: &quot;The Voice and Guitar of José Feliciano&quot; and &quot;A Bag Full of Soul&quot;, two folk-pop-soul albums that showcased his talent on radios across the US, where in July 1963 he had been described by &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist, Robert Shelton as a &quot;&quot;10-fingered wizard&quot;.&quot;

In 1966, Feliciano visited Mar del Plata, Argentina, to perform at the &quot;Festival de Mar del Plata&quot;. There, he so impressed the RCA Victor executives, that they wanted him to stay and record an album for them in Spanish. They were unsure how they wanted to record, so Feliciano suggested he record some of the bolero music of his parents where Feliciano then added his blues and folk influences from his experiences while playing in the Village. The result was two smash hits with the singles &quot;Poquita Fe&quot; (&quot;Little Faith&quot;, also titled &quot;Sin Fe&quot;, or &quot;Without Faith&quot;), and &quot;Usted&quot;. This was the beginning of a series of successful singles, albums and gold records throughout Latin America and Hispanic communities in the United States where Feliciano revolutionized the sound of the bolero. Some of his most beloved interpretations include &quot;La Copa Rota&quot;, &quot;La Carcel de Sing Sing&quot; and &quot;Extraños en la Noche&quot;, which charted concurrently as the Spanish version of Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;.

A year later, Feliciano was scheduled to perform in the United Kingdom but the authorities would not allow his guide dog, Trudy, into the country unless she was quarantined for six months. The stringent quarantine measures of those days were intended to prevent the spread of rabies. Devastated by their actions, Feliciano wrote a song about his experience entitled &quot;No Dogs Allowed&quot; (becoming a Netherlands Top 10 hit in 1969), which told the story of this first visit to London.

During his British visit on July 16, 1967, Feliciano gave a live performance on the pirate radio stations Radio 227 and Radio 355, on board the MV &quot;Laissez Faire&quot; off the British coast less than a month before the stations were due to be closed by the UK&#x27;s Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967. He also guested on a popular British television show with Dusty Springfield and recorded a rare single for RCA in England called &quot;My Foolish Heart / Only Once&quot; which was played on London radio .

After two more successful albums, Feliciano, now a household name throughout Latin America, moved to Los Angeles. He was introduced to RCA Victor producer, Rick Jarrard who, at the time, was also producing Harry Nilsson and Jefferson Airplane. They recorded the hit album &quot;Feliciano!&quot; together, including the Doors&#x27; song &quot;Light My Fire&quot;. Feliciano&#x27;s style was clearly defining itself by that time as that of an innovative crossover artist with soul, folk and rock influences, infused with a substantial Latin flair. RCA released &quot;California Dreamin as the first single during the summer of 1968 with &quot;Light My Fire&quot; as the B-side. A DJ behind the mic at KJR-Radio in Seattle, Washington liked that song on the flip side, played it on the air, and it took off, reaching No. 3 on the US pop charts with over one million copies sold in the US market alone. The song became a No. 1 hit in many countries, including Canada, Brazil and the UK and was awarded a gold disc. Doors guitarist Robbie Krieger has complimented the cover.
On the strength of this success, Feliciano won two Grammy Awards in 1968 for Best New Artist of the Year and Best Pop Male Performance, bringing him worldwide recognition as an avant-garde pop star because of his unique &quot;crossover&quot; style from Latino music to English-language pop/rock. He is widely recognized as the first virtuoso classical guitarist to bring the sound of a nylon-string guitar into the pop/rock scene. 
;Feliciano&#x27;s &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot;
On October 7, 1968, at the height of protests against the Vietnam War, Feliciano was invited by Detroit Tigers broadcaster Ernie Harwell to perform &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at Tiger Stadium in Detroit during Game 5 pre-game ceremonies of the 1968 World Series between the Tigers and the St. Louis Cardinals. His personalized, slow, Latin jazz performance proved highly controversial and damaging to Feliciano&#x27;s career in the months, even years, that followed. Some listeners thought he had &quot;desecrated&quot; and disrespected the national anthem but when asked about it, Feliciano explained that the reason he offered a non-traditional rendition of the anthem was to get people to pay attention to it. In a November 2017 NPR broadcast, he expressed pride at being the one to open the door for artists who could later interpret the nation&#x27;s anthem. His World Series rendition, which features Feliciano accompanying himself on an acoustic guitar, was released as a single that charted for 5 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 50; the first time the United States&#x27; anthem appeared on the American music charts. That recording of the national anthem is now on permanent exhibit in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.
In 1969, Feliciano recorded two more albums with Rick Jarrard, &quot;10 to 23&quot; and the London Palladium double-disc LP, &quot;Alive Alive-O!&quot;, both of which were awarded gold discs. It was around this time that the Seekers’ London based songwriter/producer Tom Springfield offered José his song &quot;Adios Amor&quot;. The Seekers had reportedly declined to record it and had since disbanded. It became one of Feliciano&#x27;s biggest hits in Australia, reaching the Top 10 in 1969. He also worked with Quincy Jones on the &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot; movie soundtrack, where he recorded the theme song &quot;Old Turkey Buzzard&quot; and appeared on numerous US television shows, performing duets with Johnny Cash, Bing Crosby, Glen Campbell, Andy Williams, and Diana Ross.

===1970s===
;&quot;Feliz Navidad&quot;

In 1970, Feliciano released an album of Christmas music, again with Rick Jarrard, originally entitled &quot;Jose Feliciano&quot;, festively resembling a Christmas present in gold wrapping with a big green and red bow. Later, the album would assume the name of its most unlikely selection, that of Feliciano&#x27;s composition . During the recording process, Jarrard had suggested that Feliciano write a new Christmas song for the album. Feliciano thought it impractical but began reminiscing about his childhood in Puerto Rico, and soon &quot;&quot;Feliz Navidad&quot; was born. &quot;Feliz Navidad&quot; has been covered internationally by hundreds of artists, becoming a traditional part of the musical landscape around the world at Christmas time. Each year during the Christmas season, &quot;Feliz Navidad&quot; remains one of the most played and most downloaded songs of the season. &quot;Feliz Navidad&quot; is also recognized by ASCAP as one of the 25 all-time most-played Christmas songs in the world and it is in the Grammy Hall of Fame.

In 1971, Feliciano traveled to Italy to participate in the Sanremo Music Festival, singing the song &quot;Che Sarà&quot; in Italian, earning second place in that contest along with a standing ovation from the Italian public. Feliciano later recorded the song with Jarrard, which became a success in Italy, and in much of Europe, including the Eastern Bloc countries, as well as in Asia. They recorded it in Spanish as &quot;Qué Será&quot;, which became a hit in Central and South America, and in English as &quot;Shake a Hand&quot;&quot;, which was a hit in the Scandinavian countries.

Feliciano wrote and performed the theme song to the 1970s comedy series &quot;Chico and the Man&quot;, and played a guest role in one episode as the cousin of Chico (Freddie Prinze), singer Pepe Fernando. In the 1970s, he acted and composed for television series and movies including &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, and the soundtrack for the 1976 movie &quot;Aaron Loves Angela.&quot; He has also been a guest performer on many albums by other artists, including Bill Withers&#x27;s &quot;+&#x27;Justments&quot;, John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Court and Spark&quot;, Michael Nesmith&#x27;s &quot;Tantamount to Treason Vol. 1&quot;, and has given concerts with Carlos Santana, Cat Stevens, and Paul Simon.
In 1975, on his last RCA album &quot;Just Wanna Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll&quot;, Feliciano released his jazz-funk-Latin instrumental composition &quot;Affirmation&quot;, which was re-released a year later by jazz guitarist George Benson on his hit album &quot;Breezin&quot;.

In early 1974, Feliciano performed behind the Iron Curtain in Prague, Czechoslovakia, sharing the stage there with Czech idol, Karel Gott.

In 1979, Feliciano recorded a spontaneous version of his 1968 hit &quot;Light My Fire&quot; as a duet with rhythm and blues/pop singer Minnie Riperton. The duet was included on Riperton&#x27;s final studio album for Capitol Records. Riperton died of cancer two months after its release. Feliciano recalls that the duet was unplanned, which is why he is not heard until the second half of the song. He and Riperton were friends and he just happened to be working in an adjoining studio while she was recording and popped in to say hello.

===1980s===

During the 1980s, after a brief stay on Motown with two English-language albums produced by Berry Gordy in 1981 and Rick Jarrard in 1983, Feliciano was a guest on the 1983 NBC television show &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot;. Also during this time period, Jose Feliciano&#x27;s manager Burl Hechtman and promoters Gary Mason and Leonardo Schultz met with President of Motown Records Jay Lasker and convinced him to record a Spanish album. They promised Lasker &quot;big sales&quot; and a Grammy nomination. The album would be produced by Leonardo Schultz and Exec Produced by Mason under the watchful eye of Hechtman. The album entitled &quot;Escenas de Amor&quot; was a big hit in the Latin market and garnered a Grammy nomination for Best Latin Pop Performance. A second album was green-lighted by Lasker, entitled &quot;Me Enamore&quot; with the same production team, which was an even bigger hit, and received a Grammy for Best Latin Pop Performance. During this time period, Mason and Schultz also arranged for Feliciano to perform at the Festival Internacional de la Canción de Viña del Mar. Feliciano left Motown and released a number of successful records for that market, including the Motown albums &quot;Escenas de Amor&quot; and &quot;Me Enamoré&quot;, as well as others from RCA, EMI, and Capitol, garnering 4 more Grammy Awards for best Latin Performer. He recorded a duet called &quot;Por Ella&quot; with the most popular Mexican singer at the time, José José, which became a Latin hit. In the 1980s and into the 1990s, José recorded duets with Natalie Cole (&quot;More Than the Stars&quot; on her 1987 album &quot;Everlasting&quot;), Gloria Estefan (&quot;Tengo Que Decirte Algo&quot; on her 2000 album &quot;Alma Caribeña&quot;), Chamaco Rivera (&quot;Consuelo&quot; on his 1984 album &quot;Por Fin&quot;), jazz singer Diane Schuur (&quot;By Design&quot; and &quot;The American Wedding Song&quot; on her 1985 album &quot;Schuur Thing&quot;), and Paul Simon (&quot;Born in Puerto Rico&quot; on his 1997 album &quot;Songs from The Capeman&quot;). In 1982, Feliciano played guitar on the DeBarge record &quot;All This Love&quot;. In 1987, Feliciano gave two concerts in East Germany: One in Leipzig and another in East Berlin with the Berliner Sinfonie-Orchester.
;Walk of Fame:
Feliciano received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on December 1, 1987. Feliciano was honored by the City of New York, which renamed Public School 155 as the José Feliciano Performing Arts School. His hands were cast on Madame Tussauds Museum&#x27;s Wall of Fame and he has a star on the Walk of Fame of his native Puerto Rico. He also had a hit in 1987 in Austria with the song &quot;The Sound of Vienna&quot;, which reached number 1 there for 4 weeks, and recorded with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. The Orchestra also performed with him live on national television at Danube Park in Vienna before more than 60,000 people.

===1990s===

When Jose Feliciano became a father in 1988, in 1991 and again in 1995, he enjoyed staying closer to home. Always loving radio and wanting to one day be a disc jockey, Jose teamed up with Mark Graham, the owner/programmer/DJ of radio station WMMM in Westport, Connecticut, where they co-hosted a weekly live radio broadcast called &quot;Speaking of Music.&quot; Here the comical duo would chat about the music of all kinds and Jose shared his vast knowledge of the music industry. Jose would play live on air, take questions from callers and interview guest artists. He enjoyed that post for over a year and says he learned a lot from the experience.

Feliciano released a cover version of Richard Marx&#x27;s &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot; in early 1990, and in 1994, he recorded a dance record in English entitled &quot;Goin&#x27; Krazy&quot; (MJM Records) under the pseudonym JF?. Latino disk jockeys around the world supported the record, helping the 12-inch dance record chart on Billboard and earning him new and younger fans.

In 1996, he made a cameo appearance as himself in the film &quot;Fargo&quot;, performing as a lounge singer.

Feliciano was also an inaugural member of the Independent Music Awards&#x27; judging panel to support independent artists.

=== 2000s ===

José Feliciano was presented the 2000 Grammy Legend Award at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards, as well as performed the theme song &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; for the television series &quot;Queen of Swords&quot; also in 2000.

In 2000, &quot;Guitarra Mía&quot;, a special tribute to Feliciano, was produced by the Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and aired both in Puerto Rico and in the US. This television special (and its soundtrack) featured Feliciano and many Puerto Rican and international stars singing some of his most famous songs, along with his personal favorites from other artists. It was first aired in December 2000, just 2 days after his mother died unexpectedly from a heart attack. The special&#x27;s final scenes featured her giving her son a standing ovation, recorded for the occasion a month before.

On December 6, 2006, Feliciano&#x27;s Spanish album, &quot;José Feliciano y Amigos&quot;, was released by Universal Records, featuring Feliciano in duets with other Latin American stars including Luis Fonsi, Lupillo Rivera, Luciano Pereyra, Rudy Pérez, Cristian Castro, Marc Anthony, Ramón Ayala, Alicia Villarreal, Ricardo Montaner, and Raúl di Blasio. A special edition was later released, featuring Ana Gabriel and Gloria Estefan.

In 2007, Feliciano released an album called &quot;Soundtrax of My Life&quot;, the first English-language album completely self-penned.

On October 16, 2007, Feliciano appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to perform &quot;Old Turkey Buzzard&quot;, the theme song from &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot;. For several months prior, Letterman had been using a clip from the movie and song as a running gag.

In 2008, Feliciano, a practicing Roman Catholic, performed at the Papal Mass at Yankee Stadium in New York.

In 2009, José was awarded his 7th Grammy for the album &quot;Señor Bolero&quot;.

===2010s===

On December 15, 2010, Feliciano appeared as the featured guest on the 37th episode of Daryl Hall&#x27;s Webbie-Award-winning webcast &quot;Live From Daryl&#x27;s House&quot;. Feliciano and Hall took turns on several numbers, including Feliciano&#x27;s version of &quot;Light My Fire&quot;. On November 9, 2011, Feliciano received the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award from the Latin Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences.

On May 10, 2010, Feliciano performed his rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at Comerica Park in Detroit. This was part of the remembrance of Detroit Tigers radio announcer Ernie Harwell, who had recently died on May 4. Requested to perform it by Harwell himself, before he died, Jose played it the way he had in 1968 with his acoustic guitar and his slow tempo, Latin jazz style.

In 2011, Feliciano signed with manager Howard Perl and MBM Entertainment who immediately brought him to The Agency Group. In January 2012, he was a guest in Memphis for the celebration of Elvis Presley&#x27;s birthday, where he announced the release (on August 7, 2012) of his new album &quot;The King&quot;, a tribute to Elvis produced in collaboration with Elvis&#x27; best friend, radio personality George Klein and released by Johnny Phillips&#x27; Select-O-Hits label. On September 19, 2012, in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, he was invited to sing &quot;God Bless America&quot; for the seventh-inning stretch of the New York Yankees game at Yankee Stadium. Additionally, less than a month later, on October 14, 2012, Feliciano returned to baseball&#x27;s post-season, and on national television, once again rendered his stylized version of the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; in San Francisco before the first game of the National League&#x27;s Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Soon Feliciano appeared on a song with reggaeton artist Farruko called &quot;Su hija me gusta&quot;, where a young man tells a father &quot;I like your daughter&quot;. He also began recording sessions with Producers Howard Perl, Jon Guggenheim, Juan Cristobal Losada, Wyclef Jean, Plácido Domingo, Billy Ray Cyrus, and Frank Licari.

In 2017, Feliciano performed a cover of Sting’s &#x27;Every Breath You Take&#x27;. 

In November 2017, Feliciano released a jazz and R&amp;B album with UK musician Jools Holland and sold out a 33-date tour throughout the UK and Ireland. The album became a hit and reached number 24 in the UK charts, the first time for an LP by Feliciano after his 1970 LP &quot;Fireworks&quot;.

===2018–present: Feliciano celebrates his golden anniversary===

The year 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of Feliciano&#x27;s entry onto the international music scene with his RCA recording of &quot;Feliciano!&quot;, which featured &quot;Light My Fire&quot;. Feliciano&#x27;s golden anniversary year was highlighted in May with his return to his homeland of Puerto Rico. The event was held at the Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center, Centro de Bellas Artes, and was called &quot;José Feliciano: Transcendental 50th Aniversario de Oro y su Legado&quot;. To a full house, Feliciano and his homeland public shared his 50 years of musical celebrity in the two-hour spectacle.

On Flag Day, June 14, 2018, Feliciano was the keynote address speaker for the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. where 19 new citizens pledged their allegiance to the United States. The event was held in Flag Hall, where the actual banner that flew over Fort McHenry in 1814, inspiring Francis Scott Key to write the poem which would become &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; is exhibited. At this same event, a donation ceremony was held where Feliciano presented to the Smithsonian Museum his Candelas guitar with which he first rendered &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, causing a national furor in 1968, along with other personal objects for the Smithsonian&#x27;s permanent collection.

On September 8, 2018, Feliciano was invited by the Detroit Tigers baseball team to return to their field and perform the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; again as he had in 1968. The Tigers were facing the St. Louis Cardinals again and they wanted Feliciano to recapture the moment reminiscent of their own 50th anniversary of winning the World Series. This time around, the performance was met not with undertones of the hatred and hostility of 1968 but rather, with the uproarious cheers of an enthusiastically grateful crowd. Fifty years later, José &quot;Feliciano was finally at peace with his being the first artist to stylize the National Anthem publicly.&quot;

Feliciano&#x27;s golden anniversary year culminated with a Christmas performance at the Vatican to perform in their annual Christmas celebration, &quot;Concerto di Natale, 2018&quot;. During their time in Rome, Feliciano and his son, Jonnie, were invited to attend a private audience with Pope Francis.

In January 2019, Feliciano was invited to appear on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Jimmy Fallon where they took their show on the road to Puerto Rico with composer, actor and producer Lin-Manuel Miranda to show the world that &quot;The spirit and soul of Puerto Rico and her people are alive and well and that the Island, ravaged by Hurricane Maria in 2017, is indeed, &#x27;Open for Business.&#x27; &quot; José was joined onstage with Puerto Rico&#x27;s hottest reggaeton and Latin trap singer, Ozuna, where together they performed their Island&#x27;s sentimental anthem, &quot;En Mi Viejo San Juan&quot;. A studio version of the song was subsequently recorded for Anthem Records and released on June 7, 2019, on all of the major digital platforms around the world. Twenty percent of its proceeds are going to Miranda&#x27;s Flamboyan Arts Fund, which supports all facets of the arts including music, theater, visual arts, dance, literature and arts education programs for youth and thus ensures that arts and culture continue to flourish during the reconstruction of Puerto Rico.

On the same weekend in New York City, Feliciano was honored during the 62nd Puerto Rican Day Parade, Inc. with a Lifetime Achievement Award, honoring him for his contributions to the world of music, while celebrating his roots and love for his island home.

During May and June 2019, Feliciano was recording an album for Anthem Records in both Nashville and Connecticut with his long-time producer, Rick Jarrard. The album is called &quot;Behind This Guitar&quot; and was released on January 31, 2020.

==Banned by the Cuban Revolution==

The Cuban Revolution exerted strict ideological control over cultural expression, leading to the censorship and banning of numerous musicians and artists, in the 1960s and 1970s, who were deemed counter-revolutionary or too closely associated with capitalist influences. Notable figures such as the Beatles, Santana, Julio Iglesias and Celia Cruz fell under this ban. Among those affected was José Feliciano, who faced restrictions following comments he made about Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence. Despite—or perhaps because of—these prohibitions, however, his music remained immensely popular in underground circles and private gatherings, where it was secretly shared and celebrated by those who defied the regime&#x27;s cultural restrictions.

==Personal life==

José Feliciano has been married twice. He and his first wife, Janna (née Hilda Pérez, 1945–2018), divorced in 1978.

In 1971, Ernie Harwell introduced Feliciano to Susan Omillian (b. ) a young Detroit art student. Harwell and Omillian originally met during Feliciano&#x27;s controversial rendition of the national anthem in 1968.

Feliciano and Omillian dated for 11 years before marrying in 1982. The couple has two sons and one daughter and resides in Weston, Connecticut.

===Parody controversy===
In December 2009, a parody of &quot;Feliz Navidad&quot; titled &quot;The Illegal Alien Christmas Song&quot; was created by radio producers Matt Fox and A. J. Rice and posted on the website for &quot;Human Events&quot;, an American conservative political website. The parody, sung in English, played on the racial stereotype of Mexican immigrants as heavy drinkers and that illegal immigrants were going to &quot;spread bubonic plague&quot;.

Feliciano released a statement on December 23 on his official website:

In a statement to the Associated Press the same day, Jed Babbin, &quot;Human Events&quot; site editor, apologized for &quot;any offense that Mr. Feliciano may have taken from this parody&quot; and removed it from the site.

==Accolades==
In Ponce, he is recognized at the Illustrious Ponce Citizens Plaza of the Parque del Tricentenario.

In 1996, Feliciano was awarded the El Premio &quot;Billboard&quot;.

He was also awarded the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011.

In 2000, Feliciano was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame.

He was also inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2013.

However, after it was taken over by G4, the show became more general-interest oriented and focused somewhat less on technology. The final episode of &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; aired on March 18, 2005. Repeat episodes continued to air until March 25, 2005, when its replacement program &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot; began three days later on March 28, 2005. Two spiritual successors to The Screen Savers, &quot;This Week in Tech&quot; on the TWiT Network with Leo Laporte and Tekzilla on Revision3 with Patrick Norton, were started after the original show concluded. On April 19, 2015, Leo Laporte announced &quot;The New Screen Savers&quot;, which began airing on TWiT network May 2, 2015.

==History==
===1998–2000===
&quot;The Screen Savers&quot; premiered on May 11, 1998, as part of ZDTV. It aired live from San Francisco, California. Originally hosted by Leo Laporte and Kate Botello, the show featured a large and continually changing group of contributors.

===2000–2001===
In April 2000, Kate Botello left the show. Patrick Norton took her spot, and he and Laporte hosted the show for much of its run. A few months after Botello left, ZDTV became TechTV.

For much of its run, &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; had a running time of 60 minutes. This was later changed to 90 minutes (the expansion coming with the advent of the &#x27;TechLive&#x27; all-day news format in 2001), but was reduced back to its original length due to scheduling conflicts and the difficulty of creating enough content for a 90-minute program.

===2002–2003===
In 2002, the show built a new set and designed a new logo and graphics. The new set was much larger and brighter than the previous &quot;basement&quot; set. The new set offered more room for the studio audience, application-specific areas, a dedicated LAN Party section, and a new lab for Yoshi. On December 17, 2002, the show celebrated its 1,000th episode.

===2004–2005===
2004 was a watershed year for &quot;The Screen Savers&quot;. Laporte left &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; to focus on hosting &quot;Call for Help&quot;, and Kevin Rose took his spot. Soon after Comcast bought TechTV in order to merge it with their struggling gaming channel &quot;G4&quot;, the TechTV offices were hit with massive layoffs affecting over 200 personnel. G4 moved the show to their studios in Los Angeles, California. The first Los Angeles based episode aired on September 7, 2004. Norton declined to move with the show, opting to remain in San Francisco with his new wife. Alex Albrecht took his spot. On November 11, 2004, Kevin Rose, Sarah Lane, and Alex Albrecht announced on their personal blogs that G4 had decided to revamp &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; by making it more pop culture, Internet, and gaming-oriented. Alex Albrecht, Yoshi DeHerrera, Dan Huard, executive producer Paul Block and the show&#x27;s entire staff (mostly TechTV employees) either resigned, made separation deals with G4, or were officially terminated. After the layoffs, the show changed formats, leaving computer and technology-focused content and adopting a gaming and entertainment variety show style that presented gaming and technology related news, product demonstrations, software clinics, interviews with notable people, live music, and such original segments as &quot;Dark Deals&quot;, &quot;Gems of the Internet&quot;, and &quot;It Came from eBay&quot;.

In 2004, Dan Huard, who had just been terminated from the show, admitted that many of the live calls on the show, since moving down to L.A. to be with G4, were staged.

New episodes of the revamped show, which would later become &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot;, began on November 29, 2004; without a live studio audience. Kevin Pereira and Chi-Lan Lieu took over hosting duties. Chi-Lan later left G4 and was replaced as co-host briefly by Sarah Lane and finally by Kevin Rose. The final hosts of &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; were Kevin Rose and Kevin Pereira. The show&#x27;s executive producer was Jim Downs.

====Cancellation====
On March 17, 2005, the cast announced that on March 25, 2005, &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; would officially end. The first episode of the officially titled &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot; aired on March 28, 2005.

==== Revival ====
In April 2015, Leo Laporte announced his version of The Screen Savers, under a slightly different name in &#x27;The New Screen Savers&#x27; and lasted through the end of 2018. The show, recorded at 3PM Pacific time on Saturday afternoons, has been made available as an audio and video netcast. Unlike the TechTV version of the show, this revamp featured Laporte alongside a rotating series of co-hosts, some of whom had a history with the show, such as Kate Botello, Patrick Norton, Megan Morrone and Kevin Rose. Other co-hosts were employees of the TWiT network but had no past connection to the show, such as Mike Elgan, Jason Howell, Father Robert Ballecer SJ and Bryan Burnett. The final live show was on December 22, 2018, followed by a pre-recorded &quot;Best of 2018&quot; episode on December 29, 2018.

==Format==
Each show began with a short commentary on the day&#x27;s technology-related news stories, sometimes accompanied by an online poll. This was followed by a call for help from a viewer, either through telephone or netcam. Early in the show&#x27;s run, this was followed by Leo&#x27;s Boot Camp, designed to help people who were new to computers. More calls were answered throughout the show, along with a variety of segments. These included various interviews, coverage of special events, The Twisted List, Site of the Night, and Download of the Day. As each show came to an end, questions sent in by email were answered. For part of the show&#x27;s run, quotations sent in from viewers were read at this time.

==Segments==
Here are a few of the many segments which appeared on The Screen Savers:

* &quot;Bit Chat&quot;

<doc id="209171" wikidata="Q699473" url="?curid=209171" title="Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst">
<text>Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst (29 November 1690, in Dornburg – 16 March 1747, in Zerbst) was a German prince of the House of Ascania, and the father of Catherine the Great of Russia.

He was a ruler of the Principality of Anhalt-Dornburg. From 1742, he was a ruler of the entire Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst. He was also a Prussian &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;.

==Life==
Christian August was the third son of John Louis I, Prince of Anhalt-Dornburg and Christine Eleonore of Zeutsch (1666–1699). After the death of his father in 1704, Christian August inherited Anhalt-Dornburg jointly with his brothers John Louis II, John Augustus (died 1709), Christian Louis (died 1710) and John Frederick (died 1742).

After possibly six months as a captain in the regiment guard in 1708, on 11 February 1709 he joined the Regiment on foot in Anhalt-Zerbst (No. 8) which later changed its name to the Grenadier&#x27;s Regiment King Frederick William IV of Prussia. It was stationed in Stettin. In 1711, Christian August was awarded the Order &quot;De la Générosité&quot;, later renamed in &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;, and on 1 March 1713 was elevated to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. After he took part in several military campaigns during the War of the Spanish Succession in the Spanish Netherlands, in 1714 Christian August was appointed Chief of the Regiment; two years later, on 4 January 1716 he was named colonel and on 14 August 1721 became major-general.

On 22 January 1729 he became commander of Stettin, after having been chosen there on 24 May 1725 as a knight of Order of the Black Eagle. Christian August was designated on 28 May 1732 lieutenant-general and on 8 April 1741 infantry general. On 5 June of that year he was designated Governor of Stettin. On 16 May 1742 Prussian King Frederick the Great awarded him the highest military dignity, the rank of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;.

Six months later, the death of his cousin John Augustus, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, without any issue made him and his older and only surviving brother, John Louis II, the heirs of Anhalt-Zerbst as co-rulers. Christian August remained in Stettin and his brother took full charge of the government, but he died only four years later, unmarried and childless. For this reason, Christian August had to leave Stettin and return to Zerbst, but he only reigned four months until his own death.

==Marriage and issue==
On 8 November 1727 in Vechelde, Christian August married Johanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp (24 October 1712 – 30 May 1760), daughter of Prince Christian August of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, Prince of Eutin and sister of King Adolf Frederick of Sweden. They had five children:
*Sophie Auguste Fredericka (2 May 1729 – 17 November 1796), who later became Catherine II the Great, Empress of Russia.
*William Christian Frederick (17 November 1730 – 27 August 1742).
*Frederick Augustus (8 August 1734 – 3 March 1793).
*Auguste Christine Charlotte (10 November 1736 – 24 November 1736).
*Elisabeth Ulrike (17 December 1742 – 5 March 1745).

<doc id="209172" wikidata="Q238046" url="?curid=209172" title="Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr">
<text>Field Marshal Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr (1 July 1914 – 4 October 1982) was an Iraqi politician who served as the fourth president of Iraq, from 17 July 1968 to 15 July 1979. He was a leading member of the revolutionary Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party and later the Baghdad-based Ba&#x27;ath Party and its regional organisation Ba&#x27;ath Party – Iraq Region (the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s Iraqi branch), which espoused Ba&#x27;athism, a mix of Arab nationalism and Arab socialism.

Al-Bakr first rose to prominence after the 14 July Revolution, which overthrew the monarchy. In the newly established government, he was involved in improving Iraqi–Soviet relations. In 1959 al-Bakr was forced to resign from the Iraqi military; the then Iraqi government accused him of anti-government activities. Following his forced retirement, he became the chairman of the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s Iraqi branch&#x27;s Military Bureau. Through this office he recruited members to the Ba&#x27;athist cause through patronage and cronyism. Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim was overthrown in the Ramadan Revolution (8 February); al-Bakr was appointed prime minister, and later, Vice President of Iraq in a Ba&#x27;ath-Nasserist coalition government. The government lasted for less than a year, and was ousted in November 1963.

Al-Bakr and the party then pursued underground activities and became vocal critics of the government. During this period, al-Bakr was elected the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s Iraqi branch&#x27;s Secretary General (the head), and appointed his cousin, Saddam Hussein, the party cell&#x27;s deputy leader. Al-Bakr and the Ba&#x27;ath Party regained power in the coup of 1968, later called the 17 July Revolution. In the coup&#x27;s aftermath, he was elected the chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council and the president; he was later appointed the prime minister. Saddam, the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s deputy, became the deputy chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council and vice president, and was responsible for Iraq&#x27;s security services.

Under al-Bakr&#x27;s rule, Iraq grew economically due to high international oil prices, which strengthened its position in the Arab world and increased Iraqis&#x27; standard of living. Land reforms were introduced, and wealth was distributed more equally. A sort of socialist economy was established in the late 1970s under Saddam&#x27;s direction. Al-Bakr gradually lost power to Saddam in the 1970s, as the latter strengthened his position within the party and the state through security services. In 1979, al-Bakr resigned from all public offices for &quot;health reasons&quot;. He died in 1982 of unreported causes.

==Early life and career==
Al-Bakr was born 1 July 1914 in Tikrit, Ottoman Iraq. He belonged to the Abu Bakr clan of the al-Bejat branch of the Nasir tribe. His father Hassan Bakr Omar passed away in 1938. That same year he entered the Iraqi Military Academy after spending six years as a primary-school teacher. During his early military career, he took part in the Rashid Ali al-Gaylani&#x27;s failed revolt against the British in 1941, and was imprisoned and expelled from the army. After 15 years of trying to rehabilitate himself al-Bakr was reinstated in the Iraqi Army in 1956, the same year he became a member of the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s Iraqi branch. In 1957, he was promoted to brigadier. Around this time al-Bakr got into contact with the Free Officers and Civilians Movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker, Spencer 2010 https://books.google.com/books?id=U05OvsOPeKMC&amp;pg=PA191 191&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He helped bring down the Hashemite Monarchy and bring Abd al-Karim Qasim to power during the 14 July Revolution. He had a short stint in the public limelight during Qasim&#x27;s rule, and withdrew Iraq from the Baghdad Pact and was a key player in improving Iraq&#x27;s bilateral relations with the Soviet Union. In 1959, a year following the coup, al-Bakr was again forced to retire from the military under allegations that he led an anti-government rebellion in Mosul by officers who favoured closer ties with the United Arab Republic. During this period he became a member of the Ba&#x27;ath Party. Even so, al-Bakr retained his prominence within the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s Iraqi branch.

In the late 1950s, when Saddam became a member of the Ba&#x27;ath Party, the two established a bond. Their future close relationship became possible because of Saddam&#x27;s uncle, Khairallah Talfah. At the very beginning, Saddam was only a Ba&#x27;ath Party member, not a party activist.

Because of Qasim&#x27;s government&#x27;s repressive policy towards the opposition, Ali Salih al-Sa&#x27;di, Secretary (leader) of the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s Iraqi branch, reorganised the party&#x27;s rank and file, and on 24 December 1962 launched a nationwide protest against Qasim&#x27;s government. The government&#x27;s treatment of dissent did not soften and by 1963 several leading Iraqi Ba&#x27;athists had travelled to Beirut to plan a coup against Qasim. The plan was simple: to build a support network in the military. A Military Bureau was established to set these plans in motion. Al-Bakr was elected its chairman. The bureau managed to recruit increasing numbers of officers, most often through personal attachments to certain people; for instance, some officers attached themselves to the bureau because of their relationship with al-Bakr. Al-Bakr led the February 1963 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état, later called the Ramadan Revolution, and overthrew Qasim&#x27;s government.

==On the road to power==

===Prime Ministership: 1963===
In the coup&#x27;s aftermath, Abdul Salam Arif, an independent, was installed as president, al-Bakr was installed as prime minister and vice president, al-Sadi was chosen as deputy prime minister, and Minister of Interior and Tahir Yahya was chosen as chief of staff. Soon after taking power, two factions were established; the radicals, mostly military men, who wished for socialist policies, and the moderates, led by Talib Shabib, who wanted to broaden the government&#x27;s traditional base of support by including non-Ba&#x27;athists in government. Al-Bakr was a moderate and spent much of his time trying to seek a compromise between the two factions.

To solve the ideological differences between the party factions, al-Bakr called a meeting of the National Command, the leading organ of the Ba&#x27;ath Party. The meeting did not go as al-Bakr planned, and Michel Aflaq, the Secretary General of the National Command (the Ba&#x27;ath Party leader), suggested that the National Command should take over the Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath Party cell. The meeting led Arif, the President, to lead the November 1963 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état.

===Underground and the 17 July Revolution: 1964–1968===

Following his and the party&#x27;s ouster, al-Bakr was jailed. The November coup had the effect of strengthening al-Bakr&#x27;s position within the party as well as that of his close associates. After a couple of years, al-Bakr was elected as the Iraqi branch&#x27;s Secretary General of the Regional Command. Simultaneously with al-Bakr&#x27;s rise to power, Saddam&#x27;s position within the party also strengthened. During this time period, Saddam became one of al-Bakr&#x27;s closest associates, and he was trusted with important tasks. Saddam was tasked with establishing the party&#x27;s security apparatus. Al-Bakr consolidated his hold on the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s Iraqi branch by appointing supporters to important offices. By appointing fellow Tikritis and by appointing family members to top offices, al-Bakr was ensuing a policy of nepotism.

Ali Salih al-Sadi, the Secretary General of the Iraqi branch&#x27;s Regional Command, was expelled from the party in 1964, and al-Bakr succeeded him in office. The remaining members of the Military Bureau were given high offices within the Regional Command. The Ba&#x27;ath Party tried unsuccessfully to oust the Arif government in 1964. In the failed coup&#x27;s aftermath, both al-Bakr and Saddam, were sentenced to jail for two years. In 1966, when Saddam was released from prison, al-Bakr appointed him Deputy Secretary of the Regional Command. Saddam, who would prove to be a skilled organiser, revitalised the party. In 1967, al-Bakr called for the establishment of a national unity government between ba&#x27;athist and nasserist forces. Al-Bakr&#x27;s call for a unity government should be taken with a grain of salt; by this time the Military Bureau and the Regional Command were already planning a coup to oust the government.

Following the 1966 Syrian coup d&#x27;état against the leadership of Michel Aflaq, the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party split in two; a Damascus-based (Syrian-led) Ba&#x27;ath Party and a Baghdad-based (Iraqi-led) Ba&#x27;ath Party. In February 1968, the Iraqi-led Ba&#x27;ath Party convened the Ninth National Congress and elected Aflaq as the Secretary General of the National Command of the Iraqi-led Ba&#x27;ath Party. This decision worsened the already bad relations with the Syrian-led Ba&#x27;ath Party. Al-Bakr was elected to the National Command as a member at the Ninth National Congress.

The coup of 1968, later referred to as the 17 July Revolution, brought al-Bakr and the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party to power in Iraq. Saddam and Salah Omar al-Ali led the coup on the ground, but it was al-Bakr who masterminded it. From his military headquarters, al-Bakr contacted Abdul Rahman Arif, the President, and asked him to surrender. Arif asked for time to consider; he wanted to find out if he had any loyal troops left. He phoned al-Bakr back later that evening and surrendered. Al-Bakr, in return, guaranteed his safety. Later, when the situation was secure, the Ba&#x27;ath Party announced it had taken power. Before taking power, the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party tried successfully to recruit military officers for the cause; some, such as Hardan al-Tikriti were already Ba&#x27;ath Party members, others, such as Abd ar-Razzaq an-Naif, the deputy head of the military intelligence and Ibrahim Daud, the commander of the Republican Guard, were not members.

Immediately after the coup, a power struggle broke out between Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party led by al-Bakr and the military wing, led predominantly by an-Naif and Daud. an-Naif and Daud had been appointed prime minister and Minister of Defence respectively, while al-Bakr was appointed president and chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, which had been established the morning after the coup and had become the highest executive and legislative branch of government. While an-Naif and Daud, according to Con Coughlin, should have had the upper hand because of their support within the military, they lost the power struggle to al-Bakr due to his political skills and the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s organisational structure. An-Naif was removed from office on 30 July 1968, and Daud lost his position shortly after. They were both exiled. Their removal was later referred to by the government as the &quot;correctional coup&quot;. Al-Bakr consolidated his position in government by appointing himself prime minister and by appointing his close associate, Hardan al-Tikriti, as Minister of Defence in the aftermath of the &quot;corrective coup&quot;.

==Presidency: 1968–1979==
===Economics===

====Economic system====
Despite al-Bakr&#x27;s and the Iraqi-led Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s radical rhetoric, their economic policies were neither radical nor very socialist. Al-Bakr&#x27;s policy can be divided into two parts: the first being a largely populist economic policy, and the second, an economic policy based on cronyism, patronage and nepotism. By the late-1970s, Saddam had &quot;de facto&quot; control over Iraq&#x27;s economic development by being chairman of the most important economic committees. A shift happened under Saddam&#x27;s command; a socialist economy, according to Con Coughlin, with government ownership of natural resources and the means of production was established. Saddam also started a diversification programme to ensure that Iraq would not be dependent on its oil revenues in the future. Even before the Ba&#x27;ath takeover, the Iraqi government set economic growth targets through economic planning. The Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), the highest legislative and executive organ of party and state, implemented and decided the goals of the plan. It was the political elite, and not the economic elite, which decided the content of an economic plan; before the Ba&#x27;ath took power, it was the other way around. The RCC convened every year to set up a budget for each year to come.

====Agricultural policy====
From the very beginning, al-Bakr&#x27;s handling of Iraqi agriculture was handled with a populist touch. For instance, in 1969 the government cancelled all compensation for sequestered lands. This decree relieved the beneficiaries of the reform by removing the financial burden. Investments in agriculture increased, and by May 1970 the government had introduced a new land reform. This land reform tried to revitalise Iraqi agriculture by resolving some of the issues of the previous land reforms, such as by paying more attention to the relationship to the type of land and irrigation system, and limits on how much land could be owned. Co-operatives were established, and cultivators were obliged to join them if they wanted to benefit from government subsidies and investments. At around this time, the government also established several collective farms to placate the party&#x27;s left-wing faction; the establishment of collective farms soon halted. Other measures were also introduced which benefited the landholding peasants, but these reforms were never able to counter the decline in agricultural production. Because of this, and the high population growth at the time, Iraq became a net importer of food grains; imports of food grain increased twelvefold from the early 1960s.

The introduction of subsidies and the removal of financial burdens from the peasantry were populist, but were also part of al-Bakr&#x27;s plan of creating a patrimonial system with himself at the top. This system gave the economic levers of powers to the political elite, which it used to confiscate the properties of its political opponents. The continued sequestration of land increased the strength of the patrimonial system; members of the political elite could bestow lands to people to increase the support for the government. The government could do this because the government was Iraq&#x27;s biggest landowner. The co-operatives which had been established provided a means of social control through their regulation. Corruption also proved to be a problem, and the acquisition of land of people close to the political leadership was repeated on a scale not seen since the time of the monarchy. This patrimonial system also favoured those who already owned land; roughly one-third of agricultural land was owned by the estimated 3 percent of landowners. Instead of confiscating their property, and evening out the distribution of land, the government kept the system in place.

By the mid-to-late 1970s, the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s land reform was beginning to have an effect. By 1976, 71 percent of state-owned land was given 222,000 new farmers. These farmers were also given up-to-date agricultural equipment. Co-operatives increased from a low 473 in 1968 to 1,852 in 1976.

====Oil industry====
The government, which was still embroiled in a conflict with the Iraqi Petroleum Company (IPC), a private enterprise, on Law 80 of 1961. Iraq was later able to negotiate a treaty with the Soviet Union, whereby the later built an oil pipeline to an oil refinery and oil export facility at al-Faw, in the Persian Gulf, to improve Iraq&#x27;s oil producing capabilities. This agreement would signal the end of the IPC&#x27;s dominance over Iraq&#x27;s oil resources; it also reinforced al-Bakr&#x27;s belief that the company needed to be nationalised. Negotiations between the Iraqi government and the IPC began in December 1971 and ended in March 1972 when the government was given shares in the IPC&#x27;s equity. However, relations soon soured; the IPC cut its own production at the Kirkuk Field by half. The government saw this as proof of the company&#x27;s arrogance, and the government also began to see the danger of a private company controlling such a vital source of the government&#x27;s revenues. The IPC was nationalised in June 1972.

The nationalisation of the IPC proved to be the last important element of foreign control over Iraq&#x27;s control, and Iraq as a whole. Austerity measures were introduced in anticipation of the loss of revenue. Even so, the nationalisation proved highly popular with the people. In addition, al-Bakr and Saddam had taken steps to make the anticipated loss less severe on the people and the economy; Saddam visited Moscow and negotiated a treaty whereby the Soviet Union would buy some of Iraq&#x27;s oil, and second, the government did not nationalise the IPC subsidiaries and gave French members &quot;special treatment&quot;. These French members bought nearly a quarter of Iraq&#x27;s oil production. This policy proved highly successful, and there was a massive increase in the price of oil in the aftermath of the 1973 Arab–Israeli War. The oil revenues strengthened the political elite&#x27;s patrimonial system; the means of patronage exceeded &quot;anything available&quot; to previous rulers.

After the nationalisation of the IPC, Iraq&#x27;s oil revenue increased from 219 million ID in 1972 1.7 billion ID in 1974 to 3.7 billion ID in 1978 to 8.9 billion ID in 1980. In short, Iraq increased its oil revenue by over 40 times in less than a decade. With the success of the Iranian revolution, Iraq became the second largest oil exporter in the world. The increase in oil export rejuvenated the country&#x27;s economy; nearly all economic indexes increased to unprecedented levels. From 1970 to 1980 Iraq&#x27;s economy grew by 11.7 percent. The growth rates of the 1970s were not sustainable; economic growth depended on high oil prices and Iraq&#x27;s oil exporting capabilities, and once oil was cut out of the picture, Iraq&#x27;s growth would decrease dramatically.

====Standard of living====
On taking power, the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party promised wealth distribution and a more equal society; the government&#x27;s effort to implement this was hampered by the government&#x27;s lack of revenue. The government was able to fulfill this promise with the increase in oil revenues in the 1970s. Immediately after taking power, Al-Bakr introduced subsidies on basic commodities, and introduced tax relief and a limited social welfare programme. These programmes were not properly developed until the mid-1970s, when increasing oil revenue allowed the government to invest more in such areas. According to Con Coughlin, the author of &quot;Saddam: His Rise and Fall&quot;, one of the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s main goals was the elimination of both the Iraqi upper and middle classes. The standard of living increased due to the nationalisation of the IPC. The country&#x27;s electricity grid was expanded, and for the first time in Iraq&#x27;s history, it reached the countryside.

===Domestic policy===

====The Kurds====
Under Bakr conflicts intensified between the government and the Kurds. In early 1974 heavy fighting erupted in northern Iraq between government forces and Kurdish nationalists, who rejected as inadequate a new Kurdish autonomy law based on a 1970 agreement. The Kurds, led by Mustafa Barzani, received arms and support from Iran. Around this same time he founded the National Progressive Front in an effort to broaden the support base for his government.

====Repression====
In July 1978 a decree was passed which made all non-Ba&#x27;thist political activity illegal and membership of any other political party punishable by death for all those who were members or former members of the Armed Forces.

===Foreign policy===
His government initially supported closer ties with Nasser, and under his rule Iraq almost joined the United Arab Republic. The flag of Iraq was modified in preparation for this goal. However, the relationship with Nasser eventually deteriorated.

Bakr&#x27;s government also strengthened Iraq&#x27;s ties with the Soviet Union. On 9 April 1972, Iraq and the Soviet Union signed a treaty of friendship. The two countries agreed to cooperate in political, economic, and military affairs. The Soviet Union also agreed to supply Iraq with arms.

According to historian Charles R. H. Tripp, the Ba&#x27;athist coup of 1968 upset &quot;the US-sponsored security system established as part of the Cold War in the Middle East. It appeared that any enemy of the Baghdad government was a potential ally of the United States.&quot; From 1973 to 1975, the Central Intelligence Agency colluded with Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran to finance and arm Kurdish rebels in the Second Iraqi–Kurdish War in an attempt to weaken al-Bakr. When Iran and Iraq signed the Algiers Agreement in 1975, the support ceased.

== Death ==
Al-Bakr died in October 1982 of unreported causes. He was given a state funeral, attended by Michel Aflaq (father of the Ba&#x27;athist ideology), who was reported to have led his funeral procession, and King Hussein of Jordan. He was buried in Baghdad&#x27;s Al Karkh cemetery.

<text>The president of the Republic of Iraq is the head of state of Iraq. Since the mid-2000s, the presidency is primarily a symbolic office, as the position does not possess significant power within the country according to the constitution adopted in October 2005.

Due to the &quot;Muhasasah&quot; political system informally adopted since the creation of the new Iraqi federal state, the office is expected to be held by a Kurd (all were from the PUK party). Although, it is not an official legal requirement.

On the 2022 Iraqi presidential election held on 13 October 2022, the Iraqi parliament voted Abdul Latif Rashid as the new president of Iraq.

== Powers of the Iraqi President ==
According to Article 73 of the Iraqi Constitution, the powers of the president are:

* Issuing a special pardon on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, with the exception of what is related to the private right, and those convicted of international crimes, terrorism, and financial and administrative corruption.

* Ratification of international treaties and agreements, after the approval of the House of Representatives, and they are considered ratified after fifteen days from the date of their receipt.

* Ratifiying and issuing laws enacted by the Council of Representatives, considered ratified after fifteen days from the date of their receipt.

* Calling the elected Council of Representatives to convene within a period not exceeding fifteen days from the date of ratification of the election results, and in other cases stipulated in the constitution.

* To award medals and medals upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister, in accordance with the law.

* Acceptance of ambassadors.

* Issuing republican decrees.

* To ratify death sentences issued by the competent courts.

* Performing the mission of the High Command of the Armed Forces for honorary and ceremonial purposes.

* Exercising any other presidential powers stipulated in this constitution.

== Conditions for running for the office of President ==
The Iraqi constitution, in Article 68, specifies a number of conditions that a candidate for the presidential office must: 

* Be an Iraqi by birth and of Iraqi parents.

* Be fully qualified and have attained forty years of age.

* Have a good reputation, political experience, and is known for his integrity, uprightness, justice, and devotion to the homeland.

* Have not been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.

== Presidential Palaces ==
In the early days of the Iraqi Republic in 1958, neither the head of the Sovereign Council, Muhammad Najib al-Rubaie, nor the Prime Minister, Abdul Karim Qassem, took any palace to be an official republican palace for the state. Al-Rubaie stayed in his personal home before 14 July 1958. Qassem also remained in his home before the revolution, while his office at the Ministry of Defense was taken as his official office in his capacity as prime minister. Sometimes he slept there.

With Abd al-Salam&#x27;s accession to power in 1963, he focused his attention on the palace that was being built during the reign of King Faisal II and in which he was to marry later. Abd al-Salam took care of the palace and completed it in 1965, the first republican palace of Iraq.

And it continued as a republican palace until 2003, at the beginning of the American occupation of Iraq.

The American forces used it as a headquarters in the first days of the occupation, then made it into an American embassy until 1 January 2009, when the Iraqi government took over it, restored it and changed its name to the Government Palace. In 2012, the Arab summit postponed from the previous year was held in this palace.

The current presidential palace in which the Iraqi president resides is the Peace Palace, which was built during the era of Saddam Hussein. Another complex used as a presidential palace during Saddam Hussein&#x27;s rule was the Radwaniyah presidential palace complex. In addition, there are a scattered number of presidential palaces in Baghdad and the rest of the provinces, such as the Sujood Palace and Al-Faw Palace in Baghdad, and the presidential palaces in Mosul, Basra, Tikrit and Babylon.

== Presidents of Iraq ==

After the revolution of 14 July 1958, elections were scheduled to be held to choose a President of the Republic, but they never took place. Therefore, the position of the president remained suspended, while Najib al-Rubaie was assigned to head the Sovereignty Council, which was considered as the president of the republic. Thus, Abd al-Salam Aref became the first to bear the title of President of the Iraqi Republic.

== Presidency Council ==
The presidency council was an entity that operated under the auspices of the &quot;transitional provisions&quot; of the Constitution. According to the Constitution, the Presidency Council functioned in the role of the president until one successive term after the Constitution was ratified and a government was seated. The presidency council had the additional power to send legislation back to the Council of Representatives for revision.

<text>The Battle of Nantwich was fought on 25 January 1644 in Cheshire during the First English Civil War. In the battle, Sir Thomas Fairfax in command of a Parliamentarian relief force defeated Lord Byron and the Royalists.

The Parliamentarian victory halted a series of Royalist successes in the area and was a major setback to King Charles&#x27; planned military campaign for 1644.

==Campaign==
In 1643, King Charles had signed a &quot;cessation&quot; with the Irish Confederates. This allowed him to recall several English regiments which had been sent to Ireland after the Irish Rebellion of 1641, to reinforce his armies. In November 1643, several of these regiments were sent to Cheshire where a new field army was being formed, commanded at first by Lord Capell. Capell was replaced in December by Lord Byron, who had been a successful cavalry brigade commander in the King&#x27;s main &quot;Oxford Army&quot;.

Byron launched an offensive from the south with 5,000 men against the Parliamentarian garrisons in Cheshire, most of which were quickly captured. The troops recently returned from Ireland behaved with a degree of ruthlessness not previously displayed in the English Civil War. At Barthomley Church on 26 December, the Parliamentarian garrison surrendered after the Royalists lit a fire against the doors to smoke them out. At least twelve of the prisoners, mostly local militia, were executed with Byron&#x27;s approval.

On 27 December, Sir William Brereton, the Parliamentarian commander in Cheshire and Lancashire, attempted to concentrate his forces to confront Byron, but was defeated by a sudden Royalist attack at the Second Battle of Middlewich. He retreated with the remnants of his force to Manchester in Lancashire.

Nantwich was the only town in Cheshire still held by the Parliamentarians. Its garrison numbered 2,000 men under Colonel George Booth and was well supplied. Byron besieged the town on 18 January 1644 and launched an attack but was defeated, suffering 500 casualties. Together with losses from sickness and desertions and casualties from the earlier fighting in Cheshire, Byron&#x27;s forces shrunk to a total size of about 3,800 men. Byron nevertheless continued the siege of Nantwich.

==Parliamentarian moves==
Sir Thomas Fairfax and his father Lord Fairfax had been besieged in Hull in the second half of 1643. As Thomas&#x27;s cavalry were of little use in a siege, they were ferried across the River Humber to reinforce Parliamentarian cavalry from the Eastern Association of counties, commanded by Oliver Cromwell. Together, they had won several victories, culminating in the Battle of Winceby, which secured most of Lincolnshire for Parliament.

In response to Brereton&#x27;s urgent appeal for reinforcements, the Committee of Both Kingdoms (the Parliamentarian body with Scottish Covenanter representation which was responsible for the conduct of the war) ordered Thomas Fairfax to proceed to Manchester. On 29 December 1643, Thomas set out to cross the Pennines in harsh winter weather with 1,800 cavalry. On arriving at Manchester, he found the infantry of the Parliamentarian garrison to be so ragged that he reportedly burst into tears. Nevertheless, Fairfax set out from Manchester on 21 January 1644 to relieve Nantwich. He was accompanied by Brereton, and their force eventually numbered 1,800 cavalry, 500 dragoons, 2,500 infantry and a few hundred poorly-equipped &quot;cudgellers&quot;.

==Battle==
At the time, Nantwich was an important town, significant for its salt production and tanning industry. Despite the fact that Queen Elizabeth I had supported a successful country-wide appeal to help fund the rebuilding of the town after a disastrous fire, which had destroyed most of the town 80 years previously, Nantwich was a Parliamentarian stronghold.

The town lay astride the River Weaver, which was normally a stream wide. The Parliamentarians held the Chester Road Bridge in the town, but the Beam Bridge about to the north was open and available to the Royalists. Byron&#x27;s headquarters were at Acton, about to the west of Nantwich. His regiments were quartered in a circle around the town sheltering where they could in a countryside covered in snow.

On 24 January, Fairfax&#x27;s force scattered a small Royalist force which attempted to bar the road to Nantwich at Delamere Forest. Byron decided to maintain the siege, but the next day there was a sudden thaw which caused the Weaver to rise in spate. Byron ordered his infantry and artillery to move to the west bank of the Weaver around Acton, where the ground was drier. The Beam Bridge and a ferry to its north, however, were then swept away by the floodwater while Byron and his cavalry force of 1,800 were still on the east bank. He was forced to march by means of another bridge at Minshull Vernon to support his infantry at Acton.

As Fairfax approached Acton, Colonel Richard Gibson (deputising for Byron&#x27;s Sergeant-Major General, Sir Michael Erneley, who was ill) deployed four regiments of infantry (his own and those of Sir Michael Erneley, Colonel Henry Warren and Sir Robert Byron, younger brother of Lord Byron) to face Fairfax. Erneley&#x27;s, Warren&#x27;s and Gibson&#x27;s regiments had recently returned from Ireland. Most of the Royalist artillery was amassed in Acton churchyard, on the left of Gibson&#x27;s line. Sir Fulk Hunke&#x27;s locally raised infantry regiment protected the rear against Booth&#x27;s garrison in Nantwich.

Despite the heavy rain and the numerous ditches and hedges which broke up the ground in front of Gibson&#x27;s position, Fairfax&#x27;s force attacked at about 14:00. Fairfax was informed that Byron was approaching his left rear from the direction of Minshull Vernon, but he deployed only two regiments of infantry and his own troop of cavalry to face them, while his main body pushed forward against Gibson. Although Gibson&#x27;s men repulsed the first Parliamentarian attack, the Parliamentarian cavalry commanded by Thomas Fairfax&#x27;s cousin, William Fairfax, outflanked the Royalist right wing and forced it to retreat. In the Royalist centre, Warren&#x27;s &quot;Irish&quot; regiment broke, and Erneley&#x27;s own regiment retreated. Behind Gibson&#x27;s position, Booth led a sortie from Nantwich with 600 musketeers which overcame Hunke&#x27;s regiment and reached Acton churchyard, overrunning the Royalist artillery and wagon park.

By 16:30, only Gibson&#x27;s and Byron&#x27;s regiments were still fighting on the flanks of Gibson&#x27;s position. As the Parliamentarians broke through the Royalist centre, these two regiments were overwhelmed. Many Royalist soldiers defected to the Parliamentarians, the remainder surrendered or fled. About 1,500 were taken prisoner. Many of the officers took refuge in Acton Church, and were also taken prisoner after surrendering on terms. Byron retreated to Chester with the Royalist cavalry, which had been unable to break through Fairfax&#x27;s flanking detachment.

==Aftermath==
The defeat at Nantwich thwarted King Charles&#x27;s plan to create a field army in the northwest based on regiments returned from Ireland. The Parliamentarians mistakenly thought that the &quot;Irish&quot; regiments were Catholics, whom they loathed, and also feared their professionalism, but in fact the Royalist general Sir Ralph Hopton wrote of some &quot;Irish&quot; units which joined his army in the South of England at about the same time:

One Royalist officer taken prisoner at Nantwich was Colonel George Monck (in command of Michael Warren&#x27;s regiment), who later changed sides and was to play a prominent part in the Commonwealth of England and the Restoration.

==Re-enactments==
There is an annual re-enactment of the battle by The Sealed Knot on the nearest Saturday to 25 January, with a parade through the town. The parade ends at Dorfold Hall, just outside the limits of the town and on the road to Acton. The commemorative day of the battle is celebrated by the local people as &quot;Holly Holy Day&quot;.
