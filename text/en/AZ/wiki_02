<text>USS &quot;Tarawa&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-40, AVT-12) was one of 24 s built during and shortly after World War II for the United States Navy. The ship was the first US Navy ship to bear the name, and was named for the bloody 1943 Battle of Tarawa. &quot;Tarawa&quot; was commissioned in December 1945, too late to serve in World War II. After serving a short time in the Far East, she was decommissioned in 1949. She was soon recommissioned after the Korean War began, serving in the Atlantic as a replacement for carriers sent to Korea. In the early 1950s, she was redesignated an attack carrier (CVA) and then an antisubmarine warfare carrier (CVS). Except for one tour in the Far East, she spent her entire second career operating in the Atlantic and Caribbean. Consequently, &quot;Tarawa&quot; was the only ship of her class to never see combat action.

Unlike many of her sisters, &quot;Tarawa&quot; received no major modernizations, and thus throughout her career retained the classic appearance of a World War II &quot;Essex&quot;-class ship. She was decommissioned in 1960, and while in reserve was redesignated an aircraft transport (AVT). She was sold for scrap in 1968.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Tarawa&quot; was long, had a beam of , an extreme width of , and a draft of . She had a top speed of , displaced , and a complement of 3,448 men. She was armed with twelve guns, and seventy-two .

&quot;Tarawa&quot; was one of the &quot;long-hull&quot; &quot;Essex&quot;-class ships. She was laid down on 11 March 1944 at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia. She was launched 12 May 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Julian C. Smith (the wife of Lieutenant General Julian C. Smith, USMC, who commanded the 2nd Marine Division at Tarawa). She was commissioned on 8 December 1945, with Captain Alvin Ingersoll Malstrom in command.

==Service history==

===Early service===
&quot;Tarawa&quot; remained in the Norfolk area until 15 February 1946, when she sailed for shakedown training in the vicinity of Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, and returned briefly to Norfolk on 16 April, before visiting New York in the latter part of the month. She arrived at Norfolk once again on 30 April. From then until late June, the warship completed her post-shakedown overhaul. On 28 June, she exited Hampton Roads bound for the west coast. &quot;Tarawa&quot; transited the Panama Canal early in July and reached San Diego, California on 15 July.
Following training and upkeep, she left San Diego for a deployment to the western Pacific. The aircraft carrier reached Pearl Harbor on 7 August and soon thereafter continued on her voyage west. She reached Saipan on 20 August and operated in the vicinity of the Mariana Islands until late September when she headed for Japan. After a stop at Yokosuka from 28 September – 3 October and one at Sasebo from 7–11 October, the aircraft carrier got underway for the northern coast of China. She arrived in the vicinity of Tsingtao on 15 October and operated in that area until 30 October when she headed back to the Marianas. On 7 November, the carrier reached Saipan and, for the remainder of her Far Eastern tour, conducted operations in the Marianas. The only exception was a brief voyage to Okinawa and back early in January 1947, after which she departed Guam on 14 January to return to Pearl Harbor. The warship arrived in Pearl Harbor on 24 January and remained in Hawaiian waters until 18 February when she got underway for fleet exercises in the vicinity of Kwajalein. As a unit of Task Force 57 (TF 57), she participated in battle practice attacks upon the carriers of TF 38 until early March. &quot;Tarawa&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 11 March for about a month, then headed for the west coast and arrived in San Francisco on 29 April.

After more than 16 months of air operations out of San Francisco and San Diego, &quot;Tarawa&quot; stood out of San Diego on 28 September 1948 and embarked upon a cruise most of the way around the world. She stopped at Pearl Harbor at the end of the second week in October and then continued her voyage on to her first foreign port of call, Tsingtao, China. The carrier arrived there on 29 October and spent the next five weeks observing events in strife-torn northern China. Early in December, she headed south for liberty calls at Hong Kong and Singapore. The warship departed the latter port on 23 December and headed for the newly independent Republic of Ceylon, and arrived at its capital, Colombo, on 29 December. Departing Ceylon on 2 January 1949, she steamed toward the Persian Gulf to call at Bahrain and Jeddah before transiting the Suez Canal on 20–21 January. Leaving Port Said, &quot;Tarawa&quot; continued her voyage to Greece, Turkey, and Crete. From Souda Bay, Crete, the warship headed across the Mediterranean on 8 February. She stopped overnight at Gibraltar on 12–13 February and then started out across the Atlantic. On 21 February, she ended her voyage at Norfolk. From then until early summer, the carrier conducted normal operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean area. After inactivation overhaul, &quot;Tarawa&quot; was placed out of commission on 30 June 1949 and was berthed with the New York Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

===Recommissioning===

Her retirement, however, lasted less than 18 months. On 30 November 1950, she was ordered reactivated in response to the Navy&#x27;s urgent need for warships – particularly for aircraft carriers – to prosecute the war which had erupted in Korea the previous summer. On 3 February 1951, &quot;Tarawa&quot; was recommissioned at Newport, Rhode Island, Captain J. H. Griffin in command. Though reactivated in response to the Korean War, &quot;Tarawa&quot; never saw service in that conflict. Rather, she served as a replacement in the 6th and 2nd Fleets for carriers dispatched to the war zone. On 1 October 1952, she became an attack aircraft carrier, and was redesignated CVA-40. The warship finally made it to the Asiatic war zone in the spring of 1954, but long after the July 1953 armistice had ended hostilities.

The ship returned to the east coast in September 1954 and resumed her normal operations. In December, she entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for overhaul and conversion to an antisubmarine warfare (ASW) aircraft carrier. On 10 January 1955, while still undergoing conversion, she was redesignated CVS-40. Her alterations were completed that summer and, after shakedown, the carrier operated around Quonset Point, Rhode Island, conducting training missions with the ASW air squadrons based there. That fall, she participated in exercises with Hunter-Killer Group 4 before returning to Quonset Point to prepare for the 1956 Springboard exercise. 30 September 1957 she visited Rotterdam.

In August and September 1958, &quot;Tarawa&quot; was part of Navy Task Force 88 (TF 88) during Operation Argus, which was involved in conducting nuclear tests in the very high atmosphere.

&quot;Tarawa&quot; served with the Atlantic Fleet for the remainder of her active career. She remained on the east coast, operating out of Quonset Point and Norfolk and occasionally visiting the Caribbean area for exercises. In the main, her duty consisted of barrier patrols against the increasingly large Soviet submarine and surface fleet and assignments training pilots for the Atlantic Fleet. On 1 May 1960, however, &quot;Tarawa&quot;″s active career came to an end. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Philadelphia, where she remained until the late 1960s. During her retirement, she received one more change in designation when she became AVT-12 in May 1961. On 1 June 1967, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register, and on 3 October 1968, she was sold to the Boston Metals Corporation, Baltimore, Maryland for scrapping.

<text>USS &quot;Tarawa&quot; (LHA-1), the lead ship of her class, was an amphibious assault ship that served in the United States Navy from 1976 to 2009. She was the second ship to be named for the Battle of Tarawa, fought during World War II. &quot;Tarawa&quot; was decommissioned on 31 March 2009, at San Diego Naval Base.

==History==
The ship was laid down in November 1971 at Pascagoula, Mississippi, by Ingalls Shipbuilding, launched 1 December 1973, sponsored by Audrey B. Cushman, the wife of Robert E. Cushman, Jr., former Commandant of the Marine Corps, and commissioned on 29 May 1976.

&quot;Tarawa&quot; was the first of five ships in a new class of general-purpose amphibious assault ships, and combined in one ship type the functions previously performed by four different types: the amphibious assault ship (LPH), the amphibious transport dock (LPD), the amphibious cargo ship (LKA), and the dock landing ship (LSD). She was capable of landing elements of a Marine Corps battalion landing team and their supporting equipment by landing craft, helicopters, or a combination of both.

The ship departed Pascagoula on 7 July 1976 and set a course for the Panama Canal. She transited the canal on 16 July and, after a stop at Acapulco, Mexico, arrived at San Diego, California on 6 August. During the remainder of 1976, the ship conducted sea trials, tests, and a shakedown cruise in the southern California operating area. During the first half of 1977, &quot;Tarawa&quot; was engaged in training exercises off the California coast. On 13 August, she entered Long Beach Naval Shipyard for post shakedown availability, which was completed on 15 July 1978. Following four and one half months of intensive individual ship and amphibious refresher training with embarked marines, &quot;Tarawa&quot; ended 1978 in her home port of San Diego on Christmas stand down.

==Missions==
Her first Western Pacific (WESTPAC) deployment came in 1979, where, among other memorable actions including port visits to Pearl Harbor, Enewetok Marshall Islands, Manila and Subic Bay Republic of the Philippines, South Korea, Singapore, Pattaya, and Okinawa, as well as Hong Kong while it was still under British control. She successfully engaged in experimental launch and recovery operations with Marine close air support AV-8A Harrier jets and later rescued over 400 South Vietnamese refugees adrift in the South China Sea; her corpsmen delivering a baby, Grace Tarawa Tran during the rescue effort, who returned to a decommissioned &quot;Tarawa&quot; at Pearl Harbor in 2010 to meet the man who delivered her.

After a second deployment WESTPAC, beginning in 1980 and spanning into 1981, &quot;Tarawa&quot; was in the Indian Ocean.

In 1983, during her third deployment, &quot;Tarawa&quot; went to the Mediterranean to support the United Nations (UN) peacekeepers in Beirut, Lebanon. Several additional cruises followed.

In 1985 as part of the US 7th Fleet, &quot;Tarawa&quot; participated in Operation Valiant Blitz with the US Marines 3rd Marine Division. The 1st Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment conducted amphibious landing and helicopter operations off the coast of Okinawa, including visits to Hong Kong and Subic Bay for liberty call.

In June 1989, &quot;Tarawa&quot; deployed for a six-month WESTPAC tour as the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), composed of the Marines from Camp Horno, Camp Pendleton, California, 1st Battalion 9th Marines (redesignated as 2nd Battalion 1st Marines on 9 September 1994).

In December 1990, &quot;Tarawa&quot; was the flagship of a 13-ship amphibious task force in support of Operation Desert Shield. She participated in the &quot;Sea Soldier IV&quot; landing exercise in January, which was a deception maneuver suggesting an amphibious assault in Kuwait, and then on 24 February landed Marines in Saudi Arabia just south of the Kuwaiti border.

In May 1991, &quot;Tarawa&quot; went to Bangladesh in support of Operation Sea Angel, providing humanitarian assistance to victims of a cyclone, delivering rice and water purification equipment.

In May 1992, &quot;Tarawa&quot; deployed for the eighth time to the Western Pacific, participating in Eager Mace 1992–93, a joint U.S./Kuwait exercise. The ship also supported the insertion of Pakistani troops into Somalia in support of UN humanitarian relief, and returned to San Diego in November 1992. &quot;Tarawa&quot; was awarded her fourth Admiral Flatley Award and her first Commander, Seventh Fleet, Amphibious Warfare Excellence Award for they deployment. Her 1992 deployment included visits to Hong Kong, Singapore, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, and Australia.

In April 1996, following another complex overhaul at Long Beach Naval Shipyard, &quot;Tarawa&quot; left from San Diego on her ninth Western Pacific deployment. She took part in US/Thailand amphibious training exercise in the Gulf of Thailand, exercise &quot;Indigo Serpent&quot;, with the Royal Saudi Navy, and exercise &quot;Infinite Moonlight&quot;, the first-ever exercise between US and Royal Jordanian Navy, in the Red Sea. The last preceded &quot;Tarawa&quot;″s visit to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch, enforcing the no-fly zone over southern Iraq. &quot;Tarawa&quot; was also part of Operation Desert Strike. Returning to San Diego in October 1996, &quot;Tarawa&quot; earned both the Federal Energy Conservation Award and the Secretary of the Navy Energy Conservation Award.

On 7 February 1998, &quot;Tarawa&quot;, along with , and more than 4,000 sailors and marines, departed San Diego for a six-month deployment. They departed five days ahead of schedule as part of a buildup of US forces in the Persian Gulf. The &quot;Tarawa&quot; Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), consisting of more than 2,100 Marines from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), operated in the western Pacific, Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. &quot;Tarawa&quot; conducted special operations certification exercises before leaving on a 10th deployment to the Western Pacific. As the possibility of renewed conflict with Iraq loomed on the horizon, the &quot;Tarawa&quot; ARG made a dash straight to the Persian Gulf within 31 days, at a speed averaging 17 knots. Just as the ARG neared the Persian Gulf, the threat passed but, according to Commander, Amphibious Group 3, the 12,500-mile, high-speed transit set a record and won the respect of senior Navy officials. The &quot;Tarawa&quot; ARG and the 11th MEU arrived in the Persian Gulf 11 March 1998. &quot;Tarawa&quot;, &quot;Denver&quot;, and &quot;Mount Vernon&quot; relieved and her ARG to continue the commitment to security and stability in the region. In the early summer of 1998 the Amphibious Ready Group conducted an evacuation operation that rescued 250 people from Eritrea&#x27;s capital, Asmara. The three ships returned home 7 August after having spent six months deployed to the western Pacific, Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf.
In mid October 2000, &quot;Tarawa&quot; was passing through the Strait of Hormuz on her way into the Persian Gulf when the destroyer was attacked. On hearing news of the attack, &quot;Tarawa&quot; came about and steamed full ahead to the Port of Aden in Yemen, where she joined , , and the Royal Navy ship , already providing logistical support and harbor security, as the command ship in charge of force protection in what became &quot;Operation Determined Response&quot;. Other US Naval ships involved were , , , and . &quot;Tarawa&quot; remained with the damaged &quot;Cole&quot; until she was secure aboard the Norwegian heavy-lift semi-submersible salvage ship for passage to the US before returning to duty in the Persian Gulf.

On 17 January 2001 during her WESTPAC deployment the Tarawa lost her port anchor and chain while visiting Hong Kong. The anchor loss was due to a brake failure during a routine procedure to anchor the ship in Victoria Harbor. EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) personnel attached to the ship, who were scuba certified, were tasked with locating the anchor and did find it. A local barge-crane company was then hired to pull up the anchor but was ultimately unsuccessful in relocating the anchor. The Navy used a video of this loss as a training tool to prevent similar incidents.

On 6 January 2003, the &quot;Tarawa&quot; (ARG), carrying the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU/SOC), departed for deployment. In mid-February, elements of the MEU off-loaded and established a training camp in Northern Kuwait while other members of the MAGTF, primarily the helicopter squadron, remained on board the ARG in the Persian Gulf.

&quot;Tarawa&quot; deployed from mid-2005 to early 2006 to the Middle East in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and a multinational training exercise (Operation Bright Star) in Egypt. She transported the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit. During this deployment, she visited Darwin, Australia, Dubai, UAE, Bahrain, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

She was redeployed to Bangladesh, this time as part of the Cyclone Sidr relief efforts with . The code name for the mission was &quot;Operations Sea Angel II&quot; in recognition of &quot;Tarawa&quot;″s previous support to Bangladesh in 1991. These humanitarian assistance efforts were instrumental in the ship being awarded the 2007 Battle Efficiency Award.

Her last deployment was from 7 November 2007 to 8 June 2008, with the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, composed of 1st Battalion, 5th Marines Charlie and Weapons company, in the Middle East in Support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. She returned to her home port of San Diego, finishing a seven-month deployment. She visited Bangladesh for a third time to offer aid for tsunami victims, Singapore, Bahrain, UAE, Djibouti, Perth and Hobart, Australia and Hawaii.

==Fate==

&quot;Tarawa&quot; was decommissioned on March 31, 2009 and was transferred by the to the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Middle Loch, Pearl Harbor. According to FY2011 plans, two &quot;Tarawa&quot;-class ships were in Category B Reserve to satisfy Marine Sealift Requirements.

In July 2014 the &quot;US Naval Amphibious Ship Historical Society&quot; was formed by members of &quot;Tarawa&quot;″s original commissioning crew, also known as plankowners, with plans to make her the first Navy amphibious ship museum. The organization was planning to acquire the ship and give her a permanent home on the West Coast as a museum.

&quot;Tarawa&quot; was stricken from the naval registry on April 30, 2024 and, on 19 July 2024, was sunk off the coast of Hawaii during RIMPAC 2024. A number of ships and aircraft from several countries participated in the sinking. &quot;Tarawa&quot; was the largest ship of her class to be sunk during a live fire naval exercise involving US forces since in 2006.

&quot;Tarawa&quot; specially was hit by an AGM-158C LRASM from an F/A-18F Super Hornet.

<text>Colonel ( ; abbreviated as Col., Col, or COL) is a senior military officer rank used in many countries. It is also used in some police forces and paramilitary organizations.

In the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, a colonel was typically in charge of a regiment in an army. Modern usage varies greatly, and in some cases, the term is used as an honorific title that may have no direct relationship to military. In some smaller military forces, such as those of Monaco or the Vatican, colonel is the highest rank.

Equivalent naval ranks may be called captain or ship-of-the-line captain. In the Commonwealth&#x27;s air force ranking system, the equivalent rank is group captain.

==History and origins==
By the end of the late medieval period, a group of &quot;companies&quot; was referred to as a &quot;column&quot; of an army. According to Raymond Oliver, , the Spanish began explicitly reorganizing part of their army into 20 &quot;colunelas&quot; or columns of approximately 1,000–1,250 soldiers. Each &quot;colunela&quot; was commanded by a &quot;cabo de colunela&quot; or column head. Because they were crown units who are directly under the control of the monarch or sovereign of a country, the units were also confusingly called &quot;coronelas&quot;, and their commanders &quot;coronels&quot;. Evidence of this can be seen when Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, nicknamed &quot;the Great Captain&quot;, divided his armies in &quot;coronelías&quot;, each led by a &quot;coronel&quot;, in 1508.

Later, in the 16th century, the French army adopted this organizational structure, renaming &quot;colunelas&quot; regiments. Even so, they simply Gallicized &quot;colunela&quot; to the French and pronounced it as written. The English then copied the unit and rank from the French. However, for reasons unknown, the English adopted the Spanish pronunciation of &quot;coronel&quot;, and after several decades of use shortened it to its current two-syllable pronunciation &quot;kernel&quot;. &quot;Colonel&quot; is linked to the word &quot;column&quot; (from Latin: ; Italian: ; French: ) in a similar way that &quot;brigadier&quot; is linked to &quot;brigade&quot;, although in English this relationship is not immediately obvious.

With the shift from primarily mercenary to primarily national armies in the course of the 17th century, a colonel (normally a member of the aristocracy) became a holder (German ) or proprietor of a military contract with a sovereign. The colonel purchased the regimental contract—the right to hold the regiment—from the previous holder of that right or directly from the sovereign when a new regiment was formed or an incumbent was killed.

As the office of colonel became an established practice, the colonel became the senior captain in a group of companies that were all sworn to observe his personal authority—to be ruled or regimented by him. This regiment, or governance, was to some extent embodied in a contract and set of written rules, also referred to as the colonel&#x27;s regiment or standing regulation(s). By extension, the group of companies subject to a colonel&#x27;s regiment (in the foregoing sense) came to be referred to as his regiment (in the modern sense) as well.

In French usage of this period, the senior colonel in the army or, in a field force, the senior military contractor, was the colonel general, and, in the absence of the sovereign or his designate, the colonel general might serve as the commander of a force. The position, however, was primarily contractual and it became progressively more of a functionless sinecure. The head of a single regiment or demi-brigade would be called a &#x27;mestre de camp&#x27; or, after the Revolution, a &#x27;chef de brigade&#x27;.

By the late 19th century, colonel had evolved to a professional military rank that was still held typically by an officer in command of a regiment or equivalent unit. Along with other ranks, it has become progressively more a matter of ranked duties, qualifications, and experience, as well as of corresponding titles and pay scale, than of functional office in a particular organization.

As European military influence expanded throughout the world, the rank of colonel became adopted by nearly every nation (albeit under a variety of names).

During the 20th century, with the rise of communism, some of the large communist militaries saw fit to expand the colonel rank into several grades, resulting, for example, in the unique senior colonel rank, which was found and is still used in such nations as China and North Korea.

===Colonel-in-chief===

In many modern armies, the regiment has more importance as a ceremonial unit or a focus of members&#x27; loyalty than as an actual battle formation. Troops tend to be deployed in battalions (commanded by a lieutenant colonel) as a more convenient size of military unit and, as such, colonels have tended to have a higher profile in specialist and command roles than as actual commanders of regiments. However, in Commonwealth armies, the position of the colonel as the figurehead of a regiment is maintained in the honorary role of &quot;colonel-in-chief&quot;, usually held by a member of the royal family, the nobility, or a retired senior military officer. The colonel-in-chief wears a colonel&#x27;s uniform and encourages the members of the regiment, but takes no active part in the actual command structure or in any operational duties.

===Colonel of the Regiment===
The title Colonel of the Regiment (to distinguish it from the military rank of colonel) continues to be used in the modern British Army. The ceremonial position is often conferred on retired general officers, brigadiers or colonels who have a close link to a particular regiment. Non-military personnel, usually for positions within the Army Reserve may also be appointed to the ceremonial position. When attending functions as &quot;Colonel of the Regiment&quot;, the titleholder wears the regimental uniform with rank insignia of (full) colonel, regardless of their official rank. A member of the Royal Family is known as a Royal Colonel. A Colonel of the Regiment is expected to work closely with a regiment and its Regimental Association.

==Colonel as highest-ranking officer==
Some military forces have a colonel as their highest-ranking officer, with no &#x27;general&#x27; ranks, and no superior authority (except, perhaps, the head of state as a titular commander-in-chief) other than the respective national government. Examples include the following (arranged alphabetically by country name):

* Antigua and Barbuda (170 personnel)
* Costa Rica (about 8,000 personnel)
* Iceland (100 personnel, employed only for peacekeeping duties)
* Libya (commands all the Armed Forces – Muammar Gaddafi until 2011)
* Monaco (two branches, with a total of about 250 personnel)
* Suriname (1,800 personnel) (up to 19 June 2020)
* Vatican City (110 personnel – the Swiss Guard)

==Other uses of colonel ranks==
The term &quot;colonel&quot; is also used as a title for auctioneers in the United States; there are a variety of theories or folk etymologies to explain the use of the term. One of these is the claim that during the American Civil War goods seized by armies were sold at auction by the colonel of the division.

Kentucky colonel is the highest title of honor bestowed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Commissions for Kentucky colonels are given by the Governor and the Secretary of State to individuals in recognition of noteworthy accomplishments and outstanding service to a community, state or the nation. This is the equivalent to a full colonel in the militia. The sitting governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky bestows the honor of a colonel&#x27;s Commission, by issuance of letters patent. Perhaps the best known Kentucky colonel is Harland Sanders of &quot;Kentucky Fried Chicken&quot; fame.

The rank of colonel is also used by some police forces and paramilitary organizations.

<text>The &quot;Tarawa&quot; class is a ship class of Landing Helicopter Assault (LHA) type amphibious assault ships operated by the United States Navy (USN). Five ships were built by Ingalls Shipbuilding between 1971 and 1980; another four ships were planned, but later canceled; instead they were joined by the s.

, all vessels had been decommissioned. The &quot;Tarawa&quot; class were replaced by the s from 2014 onward while the &quot;Wasp&quot; class remains in service.

==Design==
The vessels have a full load displacement of . Each ship is long, with a beam of , and a draft of .

Propulsion is provided by two Combustion Engineering boilers, connected to two Westinghouse turbines. These supply to the ship&#x27;s two propeller shafts. A &quot;Tarawa&quot;-class vessel can reach a maximum speed of , and has a maximum range of at . In addition to the main propulsion system, the ships are fitted with a bow thruster.

As of 1998, the ships&#x27; armament consisted of a Mark 49 RAM surface-to-air missile system, two Vulcan Phalanx close-in weapons systems, six Mark 242 25 mm automatic cannons, and eight 12.7 mm machine guns. Previously, the amphibious warships were fitted with 2 Mark 25 Sea Sparrow missile systems (which were replaced by the Phalanx units), and three 5-inch (127 mm) Mk 45 lightweight guns in bow and starboard aft sponsons (the guns were removed across the class during 1997 and 1998). Countermeasures and decoys include four Mark 36 SRBOC launchers, a SLQ-25 Nixie towed torpedo decoy, a Sea Gnat unit, SLQ-49 chaff decoys.

The number of helicopters carried by each vessel was up to 19 Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallions, 26 Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight, or a mix of the two. The flight deck is fitted with two aircraft lifts, and up to nine Sea Stallions or 12 Sea Knights can be operated simultaneously. With a small amount of modification, the ships could carry and operate up to six McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II jump-jets.

The &quot;Tarawa&quot;-class ships are designed to embark a reinforced battalion of the United States Marine Corps and their equipment. Onboard accommodation is provided for up to 1,703 marines, while is provided for the battalion&#x27;s vehicles, and is allocated for stores and other equipment. As well as deploying by helicopters, personnel and equipment can be embarked or offloaded via a well deck in each ship&#x27;s stern. Up to four LCU 1610 landing craft can be transported in and operated from the well deck, along with other designs and combinations of landing craft (two LCU and two LCM-8, or 17 LCM-6, or 45 AAVP).

The &quot;Tarawa&quot; design was later repeated for the s, with some changes. The main changes to the latter eight-ship class include the lower placement of the ship&#x27;s bridge aboard the &quot;Wasp&quot;s, the relocation of the command and control facilities to inside the hull, modifications to allow the operation of Harrier jump-jets and Landing Craft Air Cushion hovercraft, and removal of the 5-inch guns and their sponsons to increase the overall size of the flight deck.

==Construction==
All five warships were built by Ingalls Shipbuilding, at this company&#x27;s shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi. &quot;Tarawa&quot; was approved for construction during fiscal year 1969, with two more ships of this class ordered by Congress in the 1970 and 1971 fiscal years.

Design problems emerged early in the LHA program and contrary to the intent of the Total Package Procurement concept, the Navy became heavily involved in the design process. Nine ships were originally contracted for the &quot;Tarawa&quot; class, but that number was reduced to five in January 1971. The other four ships were never built for the Navy.
Work on the first warship of this class, , began on 15 November 1971, and she was commissioned into the Navy on 29 May 1976. The last of the five ships, , was completed on 3 May 1980.

==Decommissioning and replacement==

The &quot;Tarawa&quot;s began leaving service in 2005. By April 2011, four of the five amphibious assault ships had been decommissioned, leaving only &quot;Peleliu&quot; in active service. &quot;Peleliu&quot; was decommissioned on 31 March 2015 in San Diego.

The &quot;Tarawa&quot; class is to be replaced by the . The first &quot;America&quot;-class vessel was delivered and commissioned in 2014.

<doc id="199026" wikidata="Q1496384" url="?curid=199026" title="Koch, Inc.">
<text>Koch, Inc. () is an American multinational conglomerate corporation based in Wichita, Kansas, and is the second-largest privately held company in the United States, after Cargill. Its subsidiaries are involved in the manufacturing, refining, and distribution of petroleum, chemicals, energy, fiber, intermediates and polymers, minerals, fertilizer, pulp and paper, chemical technology equipment, cloud computing, finance, raw materials trading, and investments. Koch owns Flint Hills Resources, Georgia-Pacific, Guardian Industries, Infor, Invista, KBX, Koch Ag &amp; Energy Solutions, Koch Engineered Solutions, Koch Investments Group, Koch Minerals &amp; Trading, and Molex. The firm employs 122,000 people in 60 countries, with about half of its business in the United States.

The company was founded by its namesake, Fred C. Koch, in 1940 after he developed an innovative crude oil refining process. Fred C. Koch died in 1967 and his majority interest in the company was split amongst his four sons. In June 1983, after a bitter legal and boardroom battle over the amount of dividends paid by the company, the stakes of Frederick R. Koch and William &quot;Bill&quot; Koch were bought out for $1.1 billion and Charles Koch and David Koch became majority owners in the company. Charles owns 42% of the company; trusts for the benefit of Elaine Tettemer Marshall (the daughter in-law of J. Howard Marshall) and Elaine&#x27;s children, Preston Marshall and E. Pierce Marshall Jr., own 16% of the company. David Koch died on August 23, 2019, and his heirs own the remaining 42% balance of the corporation.

Charles Koch has stated that the company would go public &quot;over my dead body&quot; and that the company has used its freedom from the pressures of public markets to make long-term investments and concentrate on growth.

==History==

===Predecessor companies===
In 1925, Fred C. Koch joined MIT classmate Lewis E. Winkler at an engineering firm in Wichita, Kansas, which was renamed the Winkler-Koch Engineering Company. In 1927, they developed a more efficient thermal cracking process for turning crude oil into gasoline. This process, which the company sold to many independent refineries in the United States, threatened the competitive advantage of established oil companies, which sued for patent infringement. Temporarily forced out of business in the United States, they turned to other markets, including the Soviet Union, where Winkler-Koch built 15 cracking units between 1929 and 1932. During this time, Koch came to despise communism and Joseph Stalin&#x27;s regime. In his 1960 book, &quot;A Business Man Looks at Communism&quot;, Koch wrote that he found the USSR to be &quot;a land of hunger, misery, and terror.&quot; According to Charles Koch, &quot;Virtually every engineer he worked with [there] was purged.&quot;

In the 1930s Winkler-Koch built refineries in nine different countries across hundreds of projects. In 1933 when several American companies were doing business in Germany, in a joint venture with William Rhodes Davis, Koch assisted in the design and construction of the third-largest oil refinery in Germany at the time. It was also one of the few refineries capable of refining fuel for airplanes, and was later a strategic bombing target for Allied forces when World War II broke out. The project was stalled for some time as Davis sought approval, which was granted by the Nazi government. The war commenced six years after the refinery was completed. Koch’s business, and the Koch family, supported the American war effort against Adolf Hitler and his government.

In 1940, Koch joined new partners to create the Wood River Oil and Refining Company. In 1946, the firm acquired the Rock Island refinery and crude oil gathering system near Duncan, Oklahoma. Wood River was later renamed the Rock Island Oil &amp; Refining Company. Charles Koch joined Rock Island in 1961, having started his career at the management consulting firm Arthur D. Little. He became president in 1966 and chairman at age 32, upon his father&#x27;s death the following year.

===Koch Industries===
Wood River Oil and Refining Company was renamed Koch Industries in 1968 in honor of Fred Koch, the year after his death. At that time, it was primarily an engineering firm with a 35% interest in Great Northern Oil Company, which owned the Pine Bend Refinery in Minnesota, a crude oil-gathering system in Oklahoma, and some cattle ranches.

In 1968, Charles approached Union Oil of California about buying its 40% interest in Great Northern Oil Company but the discussions quickly stalled after Union asked for a large premium. In 1969, Koch merged his interest with the 15% interest owned by J. Howard Marshall, then owning a combined 50% of the company, preventing Union from assembling a controlling interest. They then acquired Union&#x27;s interest. The Pine Bend Refinery produced chemicals, fibers, polymers, asphalt and other commodities such as petroleum coke and sulfur.

In 1970, Charles was joined at the family firm by his brother David Koch. Having started as a technical services manager, David became president of Koch Engineering in 1979.

In 1979, the company acquired 780 dealerships from Chrysler.

In June 1983, after a bitter legal and boardroom battle over the amount of dividends paid by the company, in a settlement, the stakes of William &quot;Bill&quot; Koch and Frederick R. Koch, who wanted the company to pay more dividends rather than reinvest in the business, were bought out for $620 million and $400 million, respectively, and Charles Koch and David Koch became majority owners in the company. In June 1985, William and Frederick sued their brothers claiming that they were underpaid for their stakes, but the suit was dismissed for lack of merit.

In September 2001, the company acquired KoSa. This company is considered the largest producer of polyester in the world.

In 2005, the company acquired Georgia-Pacific, one of the world&#x27;s largest timber, forest products and paper companies.

In 2008, the company discovered that the French affiliate Koch-Glitsch had violated bribery laws allegedly securing contracts in Algeria, Egypt, India, Morocco, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia after an investigation by Ethics Compliance officer, Egorova-Farines. After Koch Industries&#x27; investigative team looked into her findings, the four employees involved were terminated. According to journalist Jennifer Rubin, Koch Industries&#x27; general counsel stated that Egorova-Farines failed to promptly share the findings, choosing instead to give the information to a manager at Koch-Glitsch who was later fired for bribery. According to Koch Industries&#x27; general counsel, &quot;Egorova-Farines was not fired but instead ran into performance problems, left the company to go on leave and never returned.&quot; Egorova-Farines sued Koch-Glitsch for wrongful termination in France, lost, and &quot;was ordered to pay costs for bringing a frivolous case&quot;.

In 2010, the company was among the first group of nearly 2,000 employers that applied for and were granted federal reimbursements from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under the new Early Retiree Reinsurance Program established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, for providing health insurance to retirees too young to be eligible for Medicare.

In 2013, the company acquired Molex, a provider of electronic components, for $7.2 billion.

In September 2014, along with the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs, the company acquired Flint Group, a printing ink producer, for $3 billion.

In June 2014, the United Negro College Fund announced a $25 million grant from Koch Industries and the Charles Koch Foundation to go towards merit-based scholarships and general support of historically black colleges and universities.

In December 2014, the company acquired Oplink Communications, an optical networking device maker, for $445 million.

In 2015, the company joined the &quot;Ban the Box&quot; movement by removing questions about prior criminal convictions from its job application, making it easier for ex-offenders to find work.

In November 2015, the company &quot;signed a Statement of Support with Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) that pledges Koch will provide supervisors with the tools to hire and support employees serving in the National Guard of the United States.&quot;

From 2017 to 2021, the company was featured in the Forbes&#x27; list of America&#x27;s Best Employers by State.

In November 2017, Koch Disruptive Technologies was established, the corporation&#x27;s venture arm, led by Chase Koch, son of Charles Koch.

In July 2019, the company sold its leases in the Athabasca oil sands.

In December 2021, Rupert Murdoch and his wife, Jerry Hall, acquired a ranch in Beaverhead County, Montana, from Matador Cattle Company, a subsidiary of the company, for $200 million. Matador was formed in 1951 by Fred Koch. It won the 2010 Lone Star Land Steward Award. The company also owns ranches in Kansas and Texas that are being marketed for sale.

In March 2023, Koch Industries announced a leadership restructuring wherein Charles Koch will remain chairman and serve as co-CEO alongside Dave Robertson, who will serve as vice chairman of the board. Jim Hannan was named President and COO. Chase Koch and Richard Dinkel were both named executive Vice President while maintaining their other roles. In addition, Ray Geoffroy and Mark Luetters were named senior vice presidents.

In 2024, the company announced a name change to Koch, Inc. to reflect its broadening scope.

==Environmental and safety record==

Bloomberg reports that from 1999 to 2003, Koch, Inc. was assessed &quot;more than $400 million in fines, penalties and judgements&quot;. The eight instances mentioned by Bloomberg include:

*In October 1994, a pipeline broke and discharged over 90,000 gallons of crude oil into Gum Hollow Creek, in Refugio County, Texas. Heavy rains carried the oil to the Nueces River and on into Nueces and Corpus Christi Bays. The discharge oiled terrestrial and aquatic wildlife. The criminal case was settled in March 2000.

*In 1996, an 8-inch-diameter steel LPG pipeline operated by Koch Pipeline Company ruptured near Lively, Texas, and began leaking butane gas. The vapor cloud ignited when two teenaged residents drove their pickup truck across a creek near the pipeline while on their way to a neighbor&#x27;s house to call 9-1-1 and report the smell of gas. The two were killed in the explosion, and approximately 25 families were later evacuated from the neighborhood without injury. An investigation conducted by the NTSB found that the pipe section which failed had not been shown to have excessive corrosion in a 1995 inspection.

*In 1999, a Texas jury found that negligence had led to the rupture of the Koch pipeline and awarded the victims&#x27; families $296 million.

*In March 1999, Koch Petroleum Group acknowledged that it had negligently discharged hundreds of thousands of gallons of aviation fuel into wetlands from its refinery in Rosemount, Minnesota, and that it had illegally dumped a million gallons of high-ammonia wastewater onto the ground and into the Mississippi River. Koch Petroleum paid a $6 million fine and $2 million in remediation costs and was ordered to serve three years of probation.

*In 2000, as a result of 312 oil spills attributed to Koch and its subsidiaries across six states, Koch paid what was at the time the largest civil fine ever imposed on a company under any federal environmental law. Koch disputed the EPA figures, saying the EPA did not file claims in over half of the cases, and that &quot;Many of these alleged spills are not even listed in the EPA&#x27;s own oil spill data base.&quot; In a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department and the state of Texas the company agreed to pay a &quot;$30 million civil penalty, improve its leak-prevention programs and spend $5 million on environmental projects&quot;.

*In September 2000, a federal grand jury returned a 97-count indictment against Koch Industries and four individual employees for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act and benzene emissions from a Corpus Christi, Texas, plant. In April 2001, Koch pleaded guilty to one count, regarding improper self-reporting related to wastewater. Koch Industries was fined $20 million.

*In December 2000, Koch Petroleum settled with the Justice Department and EPA by agreeing to spend $80 million on up-to-date pollution-control equipment at two refineries in Corpus Christi, Texas and one near St. Paul, Minnesota, and agreed to pay a $4.5 million penalty.

*In June 2003, the US Commerce Department settled with Flint Hills Resources for 40 violations of improper exporting of crude petroleum from the US to Canada for a civil penalty of $200,000.

According to the 2016 documentary, &quot;Company Town&quot;, improper waste disposal by a Georgia-Pacific mill in Crossett, Arkansas, caused a cluster of cancer incidents in the area around the mill.

In 2006, a Flint Hills Resources refinery in North Pole, Alaska was fined $16,000 by the EPA for 10 separate violations and was required to spend another $60,000 on safety equipment.

Workers at Georgia-Pacific, a corporate subsidiary of Koch, Inc., have claimed that they have developed mesothelioma caused by asbestos in Georgia-Pacific products.

Daniel Indiviglio in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; argues that the Bloomberg article is misleading, and that there are far more than only eight violations over the 63 years of the company&#x27;s operation.

Koch, Inc. won the 2015 Conservation Education Award from the Wildlife Habitat Council and &quot;has partnered with the company on conservation efforts for the past 15 years.&quot;

==Political activity==

Fred C. Koch was a founder of the anti-communist John Birch Society in 1958. His son, Charles Koch, who has been co-owner, chairman, and chief executive officer of Koch, Inc., co-founded the Cato Institute. The company also funds the political action committee KochPAC.

According to OpenSecrets, many of Koch, Inc.&#x27;s contributions have gone toward achieving legislation on taxes, energy and nuclear power, defense appropriations and financial regulatory reform. Koch Industries has been criticized by the environmentalist group Greenpeace for the role the company played in affecting climate change policy in the United States.

Prior to 2008, a Canadian subsidiary of Koch, Inc. contributed to the Fraser Institute, a conservative Canadian public policy think tank, according to the Institute&#x27;s founder.

The company has opposed the regulation of financial derivatives, limits on greenhouse gases, and sponsors free market foundations and causes. Koch, Inc. has also come out against Low Carbon Fuel Standards. According to Koch, Inc., &quot;LCFS would cripple refiners that rely on heavy crude feedstocks to provide the transportation fuels that keep America moving.&quot;

Charles Koch penned a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; op-ed column titled &quot;Why Koch Industries is Speaking Out.&quot; The article states: &quot;Because of our activism, we&#x27;ve been vilified by various groups. Despite this criticism, we&#x27;re determined to keep contributing and standing up for those politicians, like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who are taking these challenges [deficit spending by governments] seriously.&quot;

According to the watchdog group Documented, in 2020 Koch, Inc. contributed $375,000 to the Rule of Law Defense Fund, a fund-raising arm of the Republican Attorneys General Association.

The Erlang distribution is a two-parameter family of continuous probability distributions with support formula_11. The two parameters are:
* a positive integer formula_12 the &quot;shape&quot;, and
* a positive real number formula_13 the &quot;rate&quot;. The &quot;scale&quot;, formula_14 the reciprocal of the rate, is sometimes used instead.

The Erlang distribution is the distribution of a sum of formula_15 independent exponential variables with mean formula_16 each. Equivalently, it is the distribution of the time until the &quot;k&quot;th event of a Poisson process with a rate of formula_17. The Erlang and Poisson distributions are complementary, in that while the Poisson distribution counts the events that occur in a fixed amount of time, the Erlang distribution counts the amount of time until the occurrence of a fixed number of events. When formula_18, the distribution simplifies to the exponential distribution. The Erlang distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution in which the shape of the distribution is discretized.

The Erlang distribution was developed by A. K. Erlang to examine the number of telephone calls that might be made at the same time to the operators of the switching stations. This work on telephone traffic engineering has been expanded to consider waiting times in queueing systems in general. The distribution is also used in the field of stochastic processes.

== Characterization ==

=== Probability density function ===

The probability density function of the Erlang distribution is

:formula_19

The parameter &quot;k&quot; is called the shape parameter, and the parameter formula_17 is called the rate parameter.

An alternative, but equivalent, parametrization uses the scale parameter formula_21, which is the reciprocal of the rate parameter (i.e., formula_22):

:formula_23

When the scale parameter formula_21 equals 2, the distribution simplifies to the chi-squared distribution with 2&quot;k&quot; degrees of freedom. It can therefore be regarded as a generalized chi-squared distribution for even numbers of degrees of freedom.

=== Cumulative distribution function (CDF) ===

The cumulative distribution function of the Erlang distribution is

:formula_25

where formula_26 is the lower incomplete gamma function and formula_27 is the lower regularized gamma function.
The CDF may also be expressed as
:formula_28

=== Erlang-&quot;k&quot; ===
The Erlang-&quot;k&quot; distribution (where &quot;k&quot; is a positive integer) formula_29 is defined by setting &quot;k&quot; in the PDF of the Erlang distribution. For instance, the Erlang-2 distribution is formula_30, which is the same as formula_31.

===Median===
An asymptotic expansion is known for the median of an Erlang distribution, for which coefficients can be computed and bounds are known. An approximation is formula_32 i.e. below the mean formula_33

== Generating Erlang-distributed random variates ==

Erlang-distributed random variates can be generated from uniformly distributed random numbers (formula_34) using the following formula:

:formula_35

== Applications ==

=== Waiting times ===

Events that occur independently with some average rate are modeled with a Poisson process. The waiting times between &quot;k&quot; occurrences of the event are Erlang distributed. (The related question of the number of events in a given amount of time is described by the Poisson distribution.)

The Erlang distribution, which measures the time between incoming calls, can be used in conjunction with the expected duration of incoming calls to produce information about the traffic load measured in erlangs. This can be used to determine the probability of packet loss or delay, according to various assumptions made about whether blocked calls are aborted (Erlang B formula) or queued until served (Erlang C formula). The Erlang-B and C formulae are still in everyday use for traffic modeling for applications such as the design of call centers.

===Other applications===

The age distribution of cancer incidence often follows the Erlang distribution, whereas the shape and scale parameters predict, respectively, the number of driver events and the time interval between them. More generally, the Erlang distribution has been suggested as good approximation of cell cycle time distribution, as result of multi-stage models.

The kinesin is a molecular machine with two &quot;feet&quot; that &quot;walks&quot; along a filament. The waiting time between each step is exponentially distributed. When green fluorescent protein is attached to a foot of the kinesin, then the green dot visibly moves with Erlang distribution of k = 2.

It has also been used in marketing for describing interpurchase times.

==Properties==
*If formula_36 then formula_37 with formula_38
*If formula_39 and formula_40 then formula_41 if formula_42 are independent

==Related distributions==

* The Erlang distribution is the distribution of the sum of &quot;k&quot; independent and identically distributed random variables, each having an exponential distribution. The long-run rate at which events occur is the reciprocal of the expectation of formula_43 that is, formula_44 The (age specific event) rate of the Erlang distribution is, for formula_45 monotonic in formula_46 increasing from 0 at formula_47 to formula_17 as formula_49 tends to infinity. 
** That is: if formula_50 then formula_51
* Because of the factorial function in the denominator of the PDF and CDF, the Erlang distribution is only defined when the parameter &quot;k&quot; is a positive integer. In fact, this distribution is sometimes called the Erlang-&quot;k&quot; distribution (e.g., an Erlang-2 distribution is an Erlang distribution with formula_52). The gamma distribution generalizes the Erlang distribution by allowing &quot;k&quot; to be any positive real number, using the gamma function instead of the factorial function.
** That is: if k is an integer and formula_53 then formula_36
*If formula_55 and formula_56 then formula_57
*The Erlang distribution is a special case of the Pearson type III distribution
*The Erlang distribution is related to the chi-squared distribution. If formula_58 then formula_59
*The Erlang distribution is related to the Poisson distribution by the Poisson process: If formula_60 such that formula_50 then formula_62 and formula_63 Taking the differences over formula_64 gives the Poisson distribution.

<text>Snipers of the Soviet Union played an important role mainly on the Eastern Front of World War II, apart from other preceding and subsequent conflicts. In World War II, Soviet snipers used the 7.62×54mmR rifle cartridge with light, heavy, armour-piercing (B-30), armour-piercing-incendiary (B-32), zeroing-and-incendiary (P3), and tracer bullets. Most Soviet World War II snipers carried a combat load of 120 rifle cartridges in the field.

During World War II, 428,335 individuals, including partisans, are believed to have received Red Army sniper training, and of those 9,534 obtained higher-level qualifications. Unlike the militaries of other states, these snipers could be men or women. Between 1941–1945, a total of 2,484 Soviet female snipers were functioning in this role, of whom about 500 survived the war.

== History ==
In 1932, the &quot;sharpshooters&#x27; movement&quot; started under the supervision of Kliment Voroshilov. In 1938, Red Army snipers took part in the Battle of Lake Khasan against troops of the Imperial Japanese Army. The most successful Soviet use of snipers during the Second World War was during their defensive stages (1941–1943), after which the advantage of defense shifted to the German side and German snipers became a real danger to the advancing Soviet forces.

=== Doctrine ===
Soviet and Soviet-derived military doctrines include squad-level snipers, which may be called &quot;sharpshooters&quot; or &quot;designated marksmen&quot; in other doctrines (see the &quot;Sniper&quot; article). They do so because the long-range engagement ability was lost to ordinary troops when submachine guns (which are optimized for close-range, rapid-fire combat) were adopted.

Soviet military doctrine used snipers for providing long-distance suppressive fire and for eliminating targets of opportunity, especially leaders, because during World War II, Soviet military leaders and combat theorists (Vassili Zaitsev contributed greatly to Soviet sniper doctrine, although he was officially neither of these) found that military organisations have difficulty replacing experienced non-commissioned officers and field officers during times of war. They found that the more expensive and less rugged sniper rifles could match the cost-effectiveness of a cheaper assault rifle given good personnel selection, training, and adherence to doctrine. The Soviet Union used women for sniping duties, including Lyudmila Pavlichenko and Nina Lobkovskaya.

After the war, the standard Soviet Army sniper team consisted of a shooter and a spotter.

After the introduction of the Dragunov sniper rifle, the Soviet army deployed snipers at platoon level. Those snipers were often chosen from personnel who did well in terms of rifle marksmanship while members of DOSAAF. Such snipers were estimated to have a 50% probability of hitting a standing, man-sized target at , and an 80% probability of hitting a standing, man-sized target at . For distances not exceeding the probability was estimated to be well above 90%. To attain this level of accuracy the sniper could not engage more than two such targets per minute.

==Rifles==
in The first Soviet sniper rifle was designed in 1927–1928. It was the 7.62mm Mosin Dragoon rifle with a D-III optical sight (&quot;7,62-мм драгунская винтовка обр. 1891 года с оптическим прицелом Д-III на кронштейне А.А. Смирнского&quot;).

In 1931, the Red Army adopted the 7.62mm Mosin sniper rifle with a PE optical sight (&quot;7,62-мм снайперская винтовка обр. 1891/31 гг. c оптическим прицелом ПЕ&quot;) as the standard sniper rifle

In 1940, the Red Army adopted the 7.62mm SVT-40 semi-automatic sniper rifle with a PU optical sight (&quot;7,62-мм снайперская винтовка СВТ-40 c оптическим прицелом ПУ&quot;) as their second model of standard sniper rifle. Due to several problems, including accuracy issues and muzzle flash, as well as being complex and slow to manufacture, production ceased in October 1941, and work began on developing the PU version of the Mosin–Nagant.

In 1941 several 7.62mm SVT-40 semi-automatic sniper rifles with a PU optical sight were converted in full-auto sniper rifles.

In 1942 the Red Army adopted the 7.62mm Mosin sniper rifle with a PU optical sight (&quot;7,62-мм снайперская винтовка обр. 1891/30 гг. c оптическим прицелом ПУ на кронштейне Д. М. Кочетова&quot;) as the standard sniper rifle

Later, the Red Army acquired a small number of AVS-36, which were converted into self-loading sniper rifles with PE optical sights (&quot;АВС-36 с оптическим прицелом ПЕ обр. 1931 года&quot;)

The three most common sniper rifles employed by the Soviet Union were the Mosin–Nagant, the Tokarev SVT-40, and later in 1963, the SVD, the first purpose built designated marksmen&#x27;s rifle.

The sniper version of the Mosin–Nagant rifle was used before, during, and after World War II. It used the standard bolt action 1891/30 infantry rifle as a platform, though rifles destined for conversion were hand-selected for quality and accuracy. Four-power scopes were added, and came in two versions. The PE scope was a copy of a German Zeiss scope, manufactured by Emil Busch AG. The PEM model was later introduced as a more reliable, easier to produce scope. The second version of the Mosin–Nagant sniper rifle with PU optical sight, began production late in 1942. This rifle included a simpler scope design, which was incorporated from the short-lived SVT-40, and was far easier to mass-produce. To this day, it remains the most widely produced and longest serving sniper rifle in the world, and remained the Soviet Union&#x27;s main sniper rifle until it was superseded in 1962 by the semi-automatic SVD Dragunov rifle.

The SVD (&quot;Снайперская винтовка Драгунова&quot;) was officially adopted by the Soviet Armed Forces in 1963, though issued as early as 1958. The SVD was the Soviet Union&#x27;s answer to requests for an updated sniper weapon. The rifle retained the use of the same 7.62×54mmR ammunition, but is a semi-automatic gas-operated rifle with a detachable 10-round box-style magazine. The SVD continues to be the standard sniper rifle of several countries, including those of former Warsaw Pact countries now NATO members.

Later, the VSS Vintorez was adopted by Soviet Spetsnaz troops in response to urban fighting during the Chechen conflicts.

==List of famous Soviet Union snipers==
==In popular culture==
*A Hollywood film called &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; was made about Vasily Zaitsev, a Soviet sniper who fought in the Battle of Stalingrad. The plot of the movie is based on a section in the eponymous book by William Craig, which fictionalizes an alleged duel between Zaitsev and a (possibly) fictional German sniper called Major König.
*The role of a Soviet sniper is portrayed in the video game &quot;Call of Duty: World at War&quot;. On one of the maps, an injured sniper, Viktor Reznov (who gives the player &quot;Dimitri Petrenko&quot; the job of sniping) runs around to tempt German snipers into opening fire, revealing their position and allowing the player to snipe them.
*In Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot;, veteran World War II Soviet sniper Pavel Petrovich Gogol, late of the Iron &amp; Steel Division, uses his scoped Mosin–Nagant rifle to kill a Chinese general during a Chinese invasion of Siberia at a range of 900 meters—well within the capabilities of the Mosin–Nagant.
*In David L. Robbins novel &quot;War of the Rats&quot;, the lead character, Vasily Zaitsev, is a Soviet sniper in World War II.
*James Riordan&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sniper&quot; tells the story of Tania Chernova and is based on Riordan&#x27;s interviews with the subject.
*&quot;Four Steps to Death&quot;, a book written by John Wilson, portrays a Soviet sniper, Yelena Pavlova, as a main character in the Battle of Stalingrad
* The &quot;Forty-First&quot; (&quot;Сорок первый&quot;) by Boris Lavrenyov is a Soviet novel about a woman sniper in the Red Army during the Russian Civil War that was adopted into a silent film (&quot;The Forty-First&quot; (1927 film)) and then into a sound film (&quot;The Forty-First&quot; (1956 film)).
*The 2015 film &quot;Battle for Sevastopol&quot; is a joint Ukrainian-Russian film biography of Soviet sniper Lyudmila Pavlichenko, set during the 1941–42 siege of the Crimea. True to life, after being wounded, Lyudmila is evacuated to the United States, where she meets with Eleanor Roosevelt in a public relations campaign.

<text>Major General John Porter Lucas (January 14, 1890 – December 24, 1949) was a senior officer of the United States Army who saw service in World War I and World War II. He is most remembered for being the commander of VI Corps during the Battle of Anzio (codenamed Operation Shingle) in early 1944 during the Italian campaign of World War II.

==Early life and education==
John Porter Lucas was born on January 14, 1890, to the former Frances Thomas Craighill and her husband, Dr. Charles C. Lewis, in Kearneysville, Jefferson County, West Virginia. Generations of his ancestors had been prominent in Jefferson County. After education in the local schools, he attended the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York, from where he graduated with the class of 1911. His fellow graduates included numerous men who would later rise to the rank of brigadier general or higher in their military careers, such as Charles P. Hall, Herbert Dargue, Paul W. Baade, Ira T. Wyche, William H. H. Morris Jr., Frederick Gilbreath, John R. Homer, Jesse A. Ladd, Thompson Lawrence, Alexander Surles, Raymond A. Wheeler, Karl S. Bradford, Gustave H. Franke, Harold F. Nichols, James R.N. Weaver, Joseph C. Mehaffey and Philip B. Fleming.

==Early military career==
Commissioned as a cavalry officer on June 13, 1911, Lucas transferred to the Field Artillery in 1920. Lucas spent the first few years of his service in the Philippines, returning to the US in August 1914.
Lucas was assigned to Troop A of the 13th Cavalry Regiment at Columbus, New Mexico in October 1914, but that unit was temporarily based at Douglas, Arizona, and in January 1915 he became commander of the regiment&#x27;s Machine Gun Troop. On March 9, 1916, Lucas distinguished himself in action against Pancho Villa&#x27;s raiders during the Battle of Columbus, fighting his way alone and bare-footed through attacking Villistas from his quarters to the camp&#x27;s guard tent. There he organized resistance with a single machine gun until the remainder of his unit and a supporting troop arrived, then maneuvered his men to repel the attackers. He served during the Mexican Punitive Expedition, as an Aide de Camp to Major General George Bell Jr. at Fort Bliss, Texas.

==World War I==
Lucas joined the 33rd Infantry Division in August 1917 at Camp Logan, Texas, where he continued to serve Bell, commander of the 33rd, as Aide de Camp. Lucas then led the division&#x27;s Infantry School of Arms while the division trained for war. Promoted to Major on January 15, 1918, he was given command of the 108th Field Signal Battalion (the Signal Battalion for the 33rd Infantry Division) and sailed to France with this unit. He simultaneously served as the Division Signal Officer. While serving as commander of the 108th, he was seriously wounded in action near Amiens, France, on June 23, 1918. Lucas was the battalion&#x27;s first casualty, being struck by a fragment from a German high-explosive shell. Evacuated to a hospital in England, he was later sent back to the United States on convalescent leave, where he recovered from his wounds in the Washington, D.C., area. His wounds were severe enough to prevent him from rejoining the 33rd Infantry Division. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel on October 31, 1918. Following the war, he would revert to his permanent rank of Captain.

==Inter-war period==
From 1919 to 1920, and after returning to the United States, Lucas was assigned as a military science instructor for the University of Michigan R.O.T.C. program in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In 1920, he rejoined the Field Artillery. He was promoted to Major in 1920, and in that year also entered the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma (1920–1921). He graduated from the Field Artillery Advanced Course in 1921 and became an instructor at the Field Artillery School (1921–1923). He then entered the one-year program at the United States Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, graduating in 1924 and finishing 78th out of 247 in his class. He next became the Professor of Military Science and Tactics for the R.O.T.C. program at Colorado Agricultural College (now Colorado State University), Fort Collins, Colorado. He served in this position for approximately 5 years (1924–1929), earning a Master of Science degree in 1927.

He was selected for command of 1st Battalion, 82d Field Artillery Regiment at Fort Bliss, Texas, from 1929 to 1930/31. He then enrolled in the Army War College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania, in June 1931, and graduated in June 1932. From 1932 to 1936, Lucas worked in the Personnel Division, G1, of the War Department General Staff. While he was there he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. He was promoted again, now to Colonel on May 2, 1940, and from July to October, he served as commander of the 1st Field Artillery Regiment, Fort Sill, Oklahoma. After being promoted to the temporary rank of Brigadier General on October 1, he then served as commander of the Artillery Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, until July 1941, when he was notified that he would be given command of the 3rd Infantry Division.

==World War II==
In September 1941, shortly after his promotion to temporary Major General on August 5, Lucas was assigned as the Commanding General (CG) of the 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Washington, where he conducted amphibious operations training in Puget Sound. He was only in this assignment for six months, however, during which time the United States officially entered World War II in December 1941.

He was next assigned as the CG of the III Corps, in Fort McPherson, Georgia. In the spring of 1943 he was sent overseas to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) as a deputy to General Dwight David &quot;Ike&quot; Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the theater. There, in the aftermath of the disastrous airborne drops in Operation Husky, he recommended to General Eisenhower that &quot;the organization of Airborne Troops into [units as large as] divisions is unsound&quot;. He briefly took command of II Corps in September, taking over from Lieutenant General Omar Bradley.

On September 20, 1943, Lucas was given command of VI Corps, taking over from Major General Ernest J. Dawley. He led the corps in the early stages of the Italian Campaign, coming under command of the Fifth United States Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Mark Clark, who was many years younger. VI Corps crossed the Volturno Line in October and was involved in severe mountain warfare fighting until December when the corps HQ was pulled out of the line in preparation for an amphibious assault, codenamed Operation Shingle.

After the initial success of the landings at Anzio on January 22, and with little German resistance in the area, Lucas had the opportunity to break out of the beachhead and cut off the supply lines of the German 10th Army by crossing Highways 6 and 7, leaving the way open to Rome. He failed to seize the opportunity, deciding instead to wait until all of his ground troops had landed and the beachhead had been fully secured. Only 8 days after the landing on January 30, 1944, did Lucas order the British and American troops to advance on Cisterna and Campoleone. It was too late. General Albert Kesselring, on orders from Hitler, had rushed troops from outside Italy to the beachhead: now, on January 31, 1944, 8 German divisions surrounded the beachhead. Churchill was angry and furious, bewildered by the slow reactions of the American commander: &quot;I had hoped we were hurling a wildcat onto the shore, but all we got was a beached whale.&quot;

On February 6, 1944, the German 14th Army began the process of reducing the Allied beachhead. On February 16 General Eberhard von Mackensen deployed 6 divisions of his 14th Army in a full-scale counterattack in an attempt to push the British and Americans back into the sea. The German counterattack was eventually held, particularly with the use of overwhelming firepower: from the air, ground artillery and offshore ships batteries.

On February 22, 1944, Lucas was relieved of VI Corps command after Shingle, the amphibious landing at Anzio. Lucas was highly critical of the plans for the Anzio battle, believing his force was not strong enough to accomplish its mission. His confidence was not reinforced when the mission was scaled back by last-minute orders and advice from his commander, Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, who told him, &quot;Don&#x27;t stick your neck out, Johnny. I did at Salerno and got into trouble.

After nine days of preparation to reinforce his position and four weeks of extremely tough fighting, Lucas was relieved by Clark and replaced with Major General Lucian K. Truscott as the commander of VI Corps at Anzio. Lucas spent three weeks as Clark&#x27;s deputy at Fifth Army Headquarters before returning to the United States.

Although relieved of his command and bitter towards Clark and the British, who he believed had used him as a scapegoat, Lucas&#x27;s achievements during the fighting in Italy were still recognized with the award of the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, and the Silver Star. The Navy DSM&#x27;s citation reads:

In March 1944, Lucas was assigned as deputy commander and later as commander of the U.S. Fourth Army, headquartered at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.

==Post-war service and final years==
After the war, he was made Chief of the US Military Advisory Group to the Nationalist Chinese government, led by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek (1946–1948). In 1948, he was assigned as Deputy Commander of the reactivated Fifth Army in Chicago, Illinois. While still on active duty in that post, he died suddenly at Naval Station Great Lakes Naval Hospital, near Chicago on December 24, 1949. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery with his wife Sydney Virginia Lucas (1892–1959). An obituary written by long-time associate and friend Major General Laurence B. Keiser appeared in the October 1950 issue of &quot;The Assembly&quot;, the magazine of the Association of West Point graduates.

==Memorialization==
A camp in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, was named after MG Lucas in honor of his service. The polo field at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, was renamed Lucas Field in his honor. Lucas was widely known as a polo player in his youth. Lucas Street at Fort Sill is also named in his honor. On June 28, 1962, Lucas Place at Fort Eustis was named in his honor.

John Porter Lucas was a Freemason, having been entered (February 20, 1919), passed (March 6, 1919), and raised (March 10, 1919) in the Elk Branch Lodge No. 93, Shenandoah Junction, WV. He is also believed to have been a member of the York Rite, attaining the degree of Knight Templar. According to his obituary in the October 1950 issue of the Assembly, he had served as a Past Master of a Lodge of Freemasons in Fort Collins, CO.

==Media depiction==
In the movie &quot;Anzio&quot; the character of the over-cautious &quot;General Lesley&quot; is presumably based on John P. Lucas.

<text>Traffic engineering is a branch of civil engineering that uses engineering techniques to achieve the safe and efficient movement of people and goods on roadways. It focuses mainly on research for safe and efficient traffic flow, such as road geometry, sidewalks and crosswalks, cycling infrastructure, traffic signs, road surface markings and traffic lights. Traffic engineering deals with the functional part of transportation system, except the infrastructures provided.

Traffic engineering is closely associated with other disciplines:
*Transport engineering
*Pavement engineering
*Bicycle transportation engineering
*Highway engineering
*Transportation planning
*Urban planning
*Human factors engineering
Typical traffic engineering projects involve designing traffic control device installations and modifications, including traffic signals, signs, and pavement markings. However, traffic engineers also consider traffic safety by investigating locations with high crash rates and developing countermeasures to reduce crashes. Traffic flow management can be short-term (preparing construction traffic control plans, including detour plans for pedestrian and vehicular traffic) or long-term (estimating the impacts of proposed commercial and residential developments on traffic patterns). Increasingly, traffic problems are being addressed by developing systems for intelligent transportation systems, often in conjunction with other engineering disciplines, such as computer engineering and electrical engineering. Traffic engineers also set a design speed for roads, and sometimes collect data that sets the legal speed limit, such as when the 85th percentile speed method is used.

==Traffic systems==
Traditionally, road improvements have consisted mainly of building additional infrastructure. However, dynamic elements are now being introduced into road traffic management. Dynamic elements have long been used in rail transport. These include sensors to measure traffic flows and automatic, interconnected, guidance systems to manage traffic (for example, traffic signs which open a lane in different directions depending on the time of day). Also, traffic flow and speed sensors are used to detect problems and alert operators, so that the cause of the congestion can be determined, and measures can be taken to minimize delays. These systems are collectively called intelligent transportation systems.

===Lane flow equation===

The relationship between lane flow (&quot;Q&quot;, vehicles per hour), space mean speed (&quot;V&quot;, kilometers per hour) and density (&quot;K&quot;, vehicles per kilometer) is
Observation on limited access facilities suggests that up to a maximum flow, speed does not decline while density increases. However, above a critical threshold (BP, breakpoint), increased density reduces speed. Additionally, beyond a further threshold, increased density reduces flow as well.

Therefore, speeds and lane flows at bottlenecks can be kept high during peak periods by managing traffic density using devices that limit the rate at which vehicles can enter the highway. Ramp meters, signals on entrance ramps that control the rate at which vehicles are allowed to enter the mainline facility, provide this function (at the expense of increased delay for those waiting at the ramps).

==Highway safety==
Highway safety engineering is a branch of traffic engineering that deals with reducing the frequency and severity of crashes. It uses physics and vehicle dynamics, as well as road user psychology and human factors engineering, to reduce the influence of factors that contribute to crashes.

A typical traffic safety investigation follows these steps:

:1. Identify and prioritize investigation locations. Locations are selected by looking for sites with higher than average crash rates, and to address citizen complaints.

:2. Gather data. This includes obtaining police reports of crashes, observing road user behavior, and collecting information on traffic signs, road surface markings, traffic lights and road geometry.
:3. Analyze data. Look for collisions patterns or road conditions that may be contributing to the problem.

:4. Identify possible countermeasures to reduce the severity or frequency of crashes. 
:: • Evaluate cost/benefit ratios of the alternatives
:: • Consider whether a proposed improvement will solve the problem, or cause &quot;crash migration.&quot; For example, preventing left turns at one intersection may eliminate left turn crashes at that location, only to increase them a block away.
:: • Are any disadvantages of proposed improvements likely to be worse than the problem you are trying to solve?

:5. Implement improvements.

:6. Evaluate results. Usually, this occurs some time after the implementation. Have the severity and frequency of crashes been reduced to an acceptable level? If not, return to step 2.

<text>The Battle of Anzio was a battle of the Italian Campaign of World War II that commenced January 22, 1944. The battle began with the Allied amphibious landing known as Operation Shingle, and ended on June 4, 1944, with the liberation of Rome. The operation was opposed by German and by Italian &quot;Repubblica Sociale Italiana&quot; (RSI) forces in the area of Anzio and Nettuno.

Allied landings on the Italian mainland began in September 1943, and after slow gains against German resistance, the progress was stopped in December 1943 at the German defensive Gustav Line, south of Rome.

The operation was initially commanded by Major General John P. Lucas, of the U.S. Army, commanding U.S. VI Corps with the intent to outflank German forces at the Winter Line and enable an attack on Rome.

The success of an amphibious landing at that location, in a basin consisting substantially of reclaimed marshland and surrounded by mountains, depended on the element of surprise and the swiftness with which the invaders could build up strength and move inland relative to the reaction time and strength of the defenders. Any delay could result in the occupation of the mountains by the defenders and the consequent entrapment of the invaders. Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, commander of the U.S. Fifth Army, understood that risk, but he did not pass on his appreciation of the situation to his subordinate Lucas, who preferred to take time to entrench against an expected counterattack. The initial landing achieved complete surprise with no opposition and a jeep patrol even made it as far as the outskirts of Rome. However, Lucas, who had little confidence in the operation as planned, failed to capitalize on the element of surprise and delayed his advance until he judged his position was sufficiently consolidated and he had sufficient strength.

While Lucas consolidated, Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, the German commander in the Italian theatre, moved every unit he could spare into a defensive ring around the beachhead. His artillery units had a clear view of every Allied position. The Germans also stopped the drainage pumps and flooded the reclaimed marsh with salt water, planning to entrap the Allies and destroy them by epidemic. For weeks a rain of shells fell on the beach, the marsh, the harbour, and on anything else observable from the hills, with little distinction between forward and rear positions.

After a month of heavy but inconclusive fighting, Lucas was relieved and sent home. His replacement was Major General Lucian Truscott, who had commanded the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division. The Allies broke out in May. But, instead of striking inland to cut lines of communication of the German Tenth Army&#x27;s units fighting at Monte Cassino, Truscott, on Clark&#x27;s orders, reluctantly turned his forces north-west towards Rome, which was captured on June 4, 1944. As a result, the forces of the German Tenth Army fighting at Cassino were able to withdraw and rejoin the rest of Kesselring&#x27;s forces north of Rome, regroup, and make a fighting withdrawal to his next major prepared defensive position on the Gothic Line.

The battle was costly, with 24,000 U.S. and 10,000 British casualties.

==Background==

At the end of 1943, following the Allied invasion of Italy, Allied forces were bogged down at the Gustav Line, a defensive line across Italy south of the strategic objective of Rome. The terrain of central Italy had proved ideally suited to defense, and Field Marshal Albert Kesselring took full advantage.

Operation Shingle was originally conceived by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in December 1943, as he lay recovering from pneumonia in Marrakesh. His concept was to land two divisions at Anzio, bypassing German forces in central Italy, and take Rome, the strategic objective of the current Battle of Rome. By February he had recovered and was badgering his commanders for a plan of attack, accusing them of not wanting to fight but of being interested only in drawing pay and eating rations. General Harold Alexander, commander of the Allied Armies in Italy, had already considered such a plan since October using five divisions. However, the 5th Army did not have the troops nor the means to transport them. Clark proposed landing a reinforced division to divert German troops from Monte Cassino. This second landing, however, instead of failing similarly, would hold &quot;the shingle&quot; for a week in expectation of a breakthrough at Cassino, and so the operation was named Shingle.

The Anzio beachhead is at the northwestern end of a tract of reclaimed marshland, formerly the Pontine Marshes, now the Pontine Fields (Agro Pontino). Previously uninhabitable due to mosquitoes carrying malaria, in Roman times armies marched as quickly as possible across it on the military road, the Via Appia. The marsh was bounded on one side by the sea and the other by mountains: the Monti Albani, the Monti Lepini, the Monti Ausoni, and further south the Monti Aurunci (where the allies had been brought to a halt before Monte Cassino). Overall these mountains are referenced by the name Monti Laziali, the mountains of Lazio, the ancient Latium. Invading armies from the south had the choice of crossing the marsh or taking the only other road to Rome, the Via Latina, running along the eastern flanks of the Monti Laziali, risking entrapment. The marshes were turned into cultivatable land in the 1930s under Benito Mussolini. Canals and pumping stations were built to remove the brackish water from the land. These canals divided the land into personal tracts with new stone houses for colonists from northern Italy. Mussolini also founded the five cities destroyed by the battle.

When Lucian Truscott&#x27;s 3rd Division was first selected for the operation, he pointed out to Clark that the position was a death trap and there would be no survivors. Agreeing, Clark canceled the operation, but Prime Minister Churchill revived it. The two allies had different concepts: the Americans viewed such a landing as another distraction from Cassino, but if they could not break through at Cassino, the men at Anzio would be trapped. Churchill and the British high command envisioned an outflanking movement ending with the capture of Rome. Mediterranean Theatre commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower, leaving to take command of Operation Overlord, left the decision up to Churchill with a warning about German unpredictability.

The final plan called for Lucas to lead the US VI Corps in a landing in the Anzio area, followed by an advance into the Alban Hills, to cut German communications and &quot;threaten the rear of the German XIV Panzer Corps&quot; (under Fridolin von Senger und Etterlin). It was hoped that such an advance would draw German forces away from the Monte Cassino area and facilitate an Allied breakthrough.

==Plan==
Planners argued that if Kesselring (in charge of German forces in Italy) pulled troops out of the Gustav Line to defend against the Allied assault, then Allied forces would be able to break through the line; if Kesselring didn&#x27;t pull troops out of the Gustav Line, then Operation Shingle would threaten to capture Rome and cut off the German units defending the Gustav Line. Should Germany have adequate reinforcements available to defend both Rome and the Gustav Line, the Allies felt that the operation would nevertheless be useful in engaging forces which could otherwise be committed on another front. The operation was officially cancelled on December 18, 1943. However, it was later reselected.

Clark did not feel he had the numbers on the southern front to exploit any breakthrough. His plan therefore was relying on the southern offensive drawing Kesselring&#x27;s reserves in and providing the Anzio force the opportunity to break inland quickly. This would also reflect the orders he had received from Alexander to &quot;...carry out an assault landing on the beaches in the vicinity of Rome with the object of cutting the enemy lines of communication and threatening the rear of the German XIV Corps [on the Gustav Line].&quot; His written orders to Lucas did not really reflect this. Initially Lucas had received orders to &quot;1. Seize and secure a beachhead in the vicinity of Anzio 2. Advance and secure Colli Laziali [the Alban Hills] 3. Be prepared to advance on Rome&quot;. Clark&#x27;s final orders stated &quot;...2. Advance on Colli Laziali&quot; giving Lucas considerable flexibility as to the timing of any advance on the Alban Hills. It is likely that the caution displayed by both Clark and Lucas was to some extent a product of Clark&#x27;s experiences at the tough battle for the Salerno beach head and Lucas&#x27; natural caution stemming from his lack of experience in battle.

Neither Clark nor Lucas had full confidence in either their superiors or the operational plan. Along with most of the Fifth Army staff they felt that &quot;Shingle&quot; was properly a two corps or even a full army task. A few days prior to the attack, Lucas wrote in his diary, &quot;They will end up putting me ashore with inadequate forces and get me in a serious jam... Then, who will get the blame?&quot; and &quot;[The operation] has a strong odour of Gallipoli and apparently the same amateur was still on the coach&#x27;s bench.&quot; The &quot;amateur&quot; can only have referred to Winston Churchill, architect of the disastrous Gallipoli landings of World War I and advocate of &quot;Shingle&quot;.

===Availability of naval forces===
One of the problems with the plan was the availability of landing ships. The American commanders in particular were determined that nothing should delay the Normandy invasion and the supporting landings in southern France. Operation Shingle would require the use of landing ships necessary for these operations. Initially &quot;Shingle&quot; was to release these assets by January 15. However, this being deemed problematic, President Roosevelt granted permission for the craft to remain until February 5.

Only enough tank landing ships (LSTs) to land a single division were initially available to &quot;Shingle&quot;. Later, at Churchill&#x27;s personal insistence, enough were made available to land two divisions. Allied intelligence thought that five or six German divisions were in the area, although U.S. 5th Army intelligence severely underestimated the German 10th Army&#x27;s fighting capacity at the time, believing many of their units would be worn out after the defensive battles fought since September.

=== Southern attack ===

The Fifth Army&#x27;s attack on the Gustav Line began on January 16, 1944, at Monte Cassino. The operation failed to break through, but it partly succeeded in its primary objective. Heinrich von Vietinghoff, commanding the Gustav Line, called for reinforcements, and Kesselring transferred the 29th and 90th Panzergrenadier Divisions from Rome.

== Battle ==

=== Initial landings===

The landings began on January 22, 1944.

Although resistance had been expected, as seen at Salerno during 1943, the initial landings were essentially unopposed, with the exception of desultory &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; strafing runs.

By midnight, 36,000 soldiers and 3,200 vehicles had landed on the beaches. Thirteen Allied troops were killed, and 97 wounded; about 200 Germans had been taken as POWs. The British 1st Division penetrated inland, the Rangers captured Anzio&#x27;s port, the 509th PIB captured Nettuno, and the US 3rd Division penetrated inland.

In the first days of operations, the command of the Italian resistance movement had a meeting with the Allied General Headquarters: it offered to guide the Allied Force through the Alban Hills territory, but the Allied Command refused the proposal.

=== After the landings ===
It is clear that Lucas&#x27; superiors expected some kind of offensive action from him. The point of the landing was to turn the German defences on the Winter Line, taking advantage of their exposed rear and hopefully panicking them into retreating northwards past Rome. However, Lucas instead poured more men and material into his tiny bridgehead, and strengthened his defences.

Winston Churchill was clearly displeased with this action. He said: &quot;I had hoped we were hurling a wildcat into the shore, but all we got was a stranded whale&quot;.

Lucas&#x27; decision remains a controversial one. Noted military historian John Keegan wrote, &quot;Had Lucas risked rushing at Rome the first day, his spearheads would probably have arrived, though they would have soon been crushed. Nevertheless, he might have &#x27;staked out claims well inland.&quot; However, &quot;Lucas did not have confidence in the strategic planning of the operation. Also, he could certainly argue that his interpretation of his orders from Clark was not an unreasonable one. With two divisions landed, and facing two or three times that many Germans, it would have been reasonable for Lucas to consider the beachhead insecure.&quot; But according to Keegan, Lucas&#x27;s actions &quot;achieved the worst of both worlds, exposing his forces to risk without imposing any on the enemy.&quot;

=== Response of Axis forces ===


Kesselring was informed of the landings at 3 a.m. January 22. Although the landings came as a surprise, Kesselring had made contingency plans to deal with possible landings at all the likely locations. All the plans relied on his divisions each having previously organised a motorized rapid reaction unit (&quot;Kampfgruppe&quot;) which could move speedily to meet the threat and buy time for the rest of the defenses to get in place. At 5 a.m. he initiated Operation &quot;Richard&quot; and ordered the &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; of 4th Parachute Division and the Hermann Göring Fallschirm Panzer Division to defend the roads leading from Anzio to the Alban Hills via Campoleone and Cisterna whilst his plans expected some 20,000 defending troops to have arrived by the end of the first day. In addition, he requested that OKW send reinforcements, and in response to this they ordered the equivalent of more than three divisions from France, Yugoslavia, and Germany whilst at the same time releasing to Kesselring a further three divisions in Italy which had been under OKW&#x27;s direct command. Later that morning, he ordered General Eberhard von Mackensen (Fourteenth Army) and General Heinrich von Vietinghoff (Tenth Army – Gustav Line) to send him additional reinforcements.

The German units in the immediate vicinity had in fact been dispatched to reinforce the Gustav Line only a few days earlier. All available reserves from the southern front or on their way to it were rushed toward Anzio and Nettuno; these included the 3rd Panzer Grenadier and 71st Infantry Divisions, and the bulk of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Hermann Göring Panzer Division. Kesselring initially considered that a successful defence could not be made if the Allies launched a major attack on January 23 or January 24. However, by the end of January 22, the lack of aggressive action convinced him that a defence could be made. Nevertheless, few additional defenders arrived on January 23, although the arrival on the evening of January 22 of Lieutenant General Alfred Schlemm and his 1st Parachute Corps headquarters brought greater organisation and purpose to the German defensive preparations. By January 24, the Germans had over 40,000 troops in prepared defensive positions.

Three days after the landings, the beachhead was surrounded by a defence line consisting of three divisions: The 4th Parachute Division to the west, the 3rd Panzer Grenadier Division to the center in front of Alban Hills, the Hermann Göring Panzer Division to the east.

Von Mackensen&#x27;s 14th Army assumed overall control of the defence on January 25. Elements of eight German divisions were employed in the defence line around the beachhead, and five more divisions were on their way to the Anzio area. Kesselring ordered an attack on the beachhead for January 28, though it was postponed to February 1.

===Liberty ship involvement===
Liberty ships, which were never intended as warships, were involved in some fighting during the Battle of Anzio. On 22 to 30 January 1944 the was under repeated bombardment from shore batteries and aircraft throughout an eight-day period. It endured a prolonged barrage of shrapnel, machine-gun fire and bombs. The gun crew fought back with shellfire and shot down five German planes.

=== Allied offensive ===

Further troop movements including the arrival of U.S. 45th Infantry Division and U.S. 1st Armored Division, brought Allied forces total on the beachhead to 69,000 men, 508 guns and 208 tanks by January 29, whilst the total defending Germans had risen to 71,500. Lucas initiated a two-pronged attack on January 30. While one force was to cut Highway 7 at Cisterna di Latina before moving east into the Alban Hills, a second was to advance northeast up the Via Anziate towards Campoleone.
==== Battle of Campoleone ====
In heavy fighting British 1st Division made ground but failed to take Campoleone and ended the battle in an exposed salient stretching up the Via Anziate.
====Battle of Cisterna====

The main attack by the U.S. 3rd Division captured ground up to deep on a seven-mile wide front, but failed to break through or capture Cisterna. On the right, ahead of the main assault, two Ranger battalions made a daring covert advance towards Cisterna. Due to faulty intelligence, when daylight arrived they were engaged and cut off. A brutal battle with elements of the Fallschirm-Panzer Division &#x27;Hermann Göring&#x27; followed. Rangers began surrendering individually or in small groups prompting others, acting on their own authority, to shoot them. Of the 767 men in the 1st and 3rd Ranger Battalions, six returned to the Allied lines and 761 were killed or captured.

===Axis counterattacks===

By early February, German forces in Fourteenth Army numbered some 100,000 troops organised into two Army Corps, the 1st Parachute Corps under Schlemm and the LXXVI Panzer Corps under Lieutenant General Traugott Herr. Allied forces by this time totalled 76,400 (including the recently arrived British 56th Infantry Division, under Major-General Gerald Templer, which arrived complete on February 16). 

====First Counterattack====
After making exploratory probes on the Campoleone salient on the afternoon of February 3 the German forces launched a full counterattack at 23:00 in order to reduce the salient and &quot;iron out&quot; the front line. Von Mackensen had planned for the salient to be ground away rather than employing a rapid, focused thrust to cut it off. Some hours after the attack started the coherence of the front line had been completely shattered, and the fighting for the salient had given way to small unit actions, swaying back and forth through the gullies. In the morning of February 4 the situation was becoming more serious, with the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards (of 24th Guards Brigade), only having one cohesive rifle company left and on the opposite side of the salient, the 6th Battalion, Gordon Highlanders (of 2nd Brigade) was beginning to crumble and later lost three complete companies as prisoners.

Even though the base of the salient was nearly broken, Lucas was able to bolster the British 1st Division&#x27;s defenses with the newly arrived 168th Brigade (from the 56th Division, containing 1st Battalion, London Irish Rifles, 1st Battalion, London Scottish, 10th Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment). The 3rd Brigade had been tasked with holding the tip of the salient 2 miles long and 1,000 yards wide on the road going north of Campoleone, but after the German attacks in the early hours of 4 February, the 2nd Battalion, Sherwood Foresters, 1st Battalion, King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry and 1st Battalion, Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment (all of 3rd Brigade) had been cut off and were surrounded in the pocket. They held the line all day, taking heavy casualties, but were eventually ordered to pull back and made a fighting retreat at 5pm to the Factory with the aid of artillery, and a successful assault launched by the London Scottish, of 168th Brigade, supported by the 46th Royal Tank Regiment (46 RTR).

From February 5 to February 7 both sides employed heavy artillery concentrations and bombers to disrupt the other side and at 21:00 on February 7 the Germans renewed their attack. Once more the fighting was fierce and they managed to infiltrate between the 5th Battalion, Grenadier Guards (24th Guards Brigade) and the 2nd Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment (2nd Brigade) and nearly surrounded them; it was for his leadership of British counterattacks during this period that Major William Sidney, a company commander in the 5th Grenadier Guards, was later awarded the Victoria Cross. Slowly the Allies were forced to give ground and by February 10 they had been pushed out of the salient. Lucas ordered attacks on February 11 to regain the lost ground but the Germans, forewarned by a radio intercept, repelled the Allies&#x27; poorly coordinated attack.
====Operation Fischfang====

On February 16, the Germans launched a new offensive (&quot;Operation Fischfang&quot;) down the line of the Via Anziate, supported by Tiger tanks. They overran the 167th Brigade, of the recently arrived 56th (London) Division, and virtually destroyed X and Y Companies of the 8th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, each of which was reduced from around 125 down to a single officer and 10 other ranks. One of the men killed was Second Lieutenant Eric Waters, whose son Roger Waters of Pink Floyd, created a song (&quot;When the Tigers Broke Free&quot;) in memory of his father and describes his death.
By February 18, after desperate fighting, the Allies&#x27; Final Beachhead Line (prepared defenses more or less on the line of the original beachhead) was under attack. Numerous attacks were launched on 1st Battalion, Loyal Regiment (2nd Brigade) and they lost a company, overrun, and the day after had suffered 200 casualties. On the same day Major-General Ronald Penney, General Officer Commanding (GOC) British 1st Division, had been wounded by shellfire and the division was temporarily commanded by Major-General Templer, GOC 56th (London) Division, which had arrived complete. However, a counterattack using VI Corps&#x27; reserves halted the German advance, and on February 20, &quot;Fischfang&quot; petered out with both sides exhausted. An important contribution to stopping the German counterattack was the Allied artillery outshooting the German by a ratio of about ten to one, which had broken up attacks by hitting German assembly areas. 

During &quot;Fischfang&quot; the Germans sustained some 5,400 casualties, the Allies 3,500. Both had suffered nearly 20,000 casualties each since the first landings, and it was &quot;far the highest density of destruction in the Italian campaign, perhaps in the whole war&quot;. 

Also on February 18 while returning to Anzio the light cruiser was struck by two torpedoes and sunk with a loss of 417 men. 

====Further Counterattacks====
Despite the exhausted state of the troops, Hitler insisted that 14th Army should continue to attack. Despite the misgivings of both Kesselring and von Mackensen, a further assault was mounted on February 29, this time on LXXVI Panzer Corps&#x27; front around Cisterna. This push achieved little except to generate a further 2,500 casualties for the 14th Army.

====Involvement of Italian Social Republic units====
Some Italian RSI units fought in the Anzio-Nettuno area, especially since March; the land units were part of the German 14th Army: only the paratroopers of the &quot;Nembo&quot; Battalion were there since February, participating in the German counterattack. In March the infantrymen of the &quot;Barbarigo&quot; Battalion (from Decima Flottiglia MAS under Captain Junio Valerio Borghese) joined the frontline along the &quot;Canale Mussolini&quot;.

=== Lucas replaced ===

Churchill had continued to bridle at Lucas&#x27; perceived passivity. He had written on February 10 to General Alexander encouraging him to exert his authority and Alexander had visited the beachhead on February 14 to tell Lucas he wished for a breakout as soon as the tactical situation allowed. After his visit Alexander wrote to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Alan Brooke, saying:

Lucas wrote in his diary on February 15:

On February 16 at a high level conference hosted by Alexander and attended by Mark W. Clark and Henry Maitland Wilson, commander Allied Force Headquarters it was decided to appoint two deputies under Lucas, Lucian Truscott and the British Major-General Vyvyan Evelegh who were known to be more aggressive. On February 22, Clark replaced Lucas with Truscott, appointing Lucas deputy commander Fifth Army until such time as a suitable job could be found for him back in the United States.

==Operation Diadem==
Both sides had realised that no decisive result could be achieved until the spring and reverted to a defensive posture involving aggressive patrolling and artillery duels whilst they worked to rebuild their fighting capabilities. In anticipation of the following spring, Kesselring ordered the preparation of a new defence line, the Caesar C line, behind the line of beachhead running from the mouth of the river Tiber just south of Rome through Albano, skirting south of the Alban Hills to Valmontone and across Italy to the Adriatic coast at Pescara, behind which 14th Army and, to their left, 10th Army might withdraw when the need arose.

Lucian Truscott, who had been promoted from the command of U.S. 3rd Infantry Division to replace Lucas as commander of VI Corps on February 22, worked with his staff on the plans for an attack as part of a general offensive which Alexander was planning for May and which would include Operation Diadem, a big effort against the Gustav Line. The objective of the plan was fully to engage Kesselring&#x27;s armies and remove any prospect of the Germans withdrawing forces from Italy. It was also intended to trap the bulk of the 10th Army between the Allied forces advancing through the Gustav Line and VI Corps thrusting inland from Anzio.
In March, the 2nd Italian SS &quot;Vendetta&quot; Battalion and 29th Italian SS Rifle Battalion were sent to fight against the Anglo-American forces at the Anzio beachhead. Dispersed among German battalions, the German commanding officers later gave the Italians companies favourable reports. Members of former Blackshirt Lieutenant-Colonel Degli Oddi&#x27;s &quot;Vendetta&quot; helped defeat a determined effort by the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division to overrun their positions and captured a number of prisoners. Their performance at Anzio led to designation as units of the Waffen-SS, with all the duties and rights that that entailed.

The next few weeks saw many changes in divisions on both sides. The U.S. 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, which had fought with distinction but suffered many losses, was withdrawn to England on 23 March 1944. Also, in March the U.S. 34th Infantry Division and in early May, U.S. 36th Infantry Division, had arrived at Anzio. On the British side the 24th Guards Brigade of 1st Infantry Division was replaced in the first week of March by 18th Infantry Brigade (from the 1st Armoured Division in North Africa). The Guards Brigade had suffered devastating casualties (nearly 2,000 of an initial strength of over 2,500) in just less than two months at Anzio. In late March the 56th (London) Infantry Division had also been relieved, after suffering many casualties (the 7th Ox and Bucks of 167th (London) Brigade, had been reduced from 1,000 men to 60, by the 5th Infantry Division. By late May, there were some 150,000 Allied troops in the bridgehead, including five U.S. and two British divisions, facing five German divisions. The Germans were well dug in but were weak in numbers of officers and NCOs and, by the time of the late May offensive, lacked reserves (which had all been sent south to the Gustav line).
Despite Alexander&#x27;s plan for &quot;Diadem&quot; requiring VI Corps to strike inland and cut Route 6, Clark asked Truscott to prepare alternatives and to be ready to switch from one to another at 48 hours&#x27; notice. Of the four scenarios prepared by Truscott, Operation Buffalo called for an attack through Cisterna, into the gap in the hills and to cut Route 6 at Valmontone. Operation Turtle was an attack to the left of the Alban Hills taking Campoleone, Albano and on to Rome. On May 5, Alexander selected &quot;Buffalo&quot; and issued Clark with orders to this effect. Clark was determined that VI Corps should strike directly for Rome as evidenced in his later writing,

Clark put it to Alexander that VI Corps did not have the strength to trap the 10th Army and Alexander, instead of making his requirements clear, was conciliatory and gave the impression that a push on Rome was still a possibility if &quot;Buffalo&quot; ran into difficulties. On May 6, Clark informed Truscott that &quot;..the capture of Rome is the only important objective and to be ready to execute &quot;Turtle&quot; as well as &quot;Buffalo&quot;&quot;.

Truscott&#x27;s planning for &quot;Buffalo&quot; was meticulous, the 5th Infantry Division and the 1st Infantry Division on the left were to attack along the coast and up the Via Anziate to pin the 4th Parachute Division, 65th Infantry Division and the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division in place whilst the 45th Infantry Division, 1st Armored Division and 3rd Infantry Division would launch the main assault, engaging the German 362nd Infantry Division and the 715th Infantry Division and striking towards Campoleone, Velletri and Cisterna respectively. On the Allies&#x27; far right, the 1st Special Service Force would protect the American southern flank.

==Breakout==
At 5:45 a.m. May 23, 1944, 1,500 Allied artillery pieces commenced bombardment. Forty minutes later the guns paused as attacks were made by close air support and then resumed as the infantry and armour moved forward. The first day&#x27;s fighting was intense: the 1st Armored Division lost 100 tanks and 3rd Infantry Division suffered 955 casualties. The Germans suffered too, with the 362nd Infantry Division estimated to have lost 50% of its fighting strength.

Mackensen had been convinced that the Allies&#x27; main thrust would be up the Via Anziate, and the ferocity of the British feint on May 23 and 24 did nothing to persuade him otherwise. Kesselring was convinced that the Allies&#x27; intentions were to gain Route 6 and ordered the Hermann Göring Panzer Division, resting away at Livorno, to Valmontone to hold open Route 6 for the 10th Army, which was retreating up this road from Cassino.

In the afternoon of May 25, Cisterna finally fell to the 3rd Infantry Division, who had to go from house to house winkling out the German 362nd Infantry Division, which had refused to withdraw and, as a consequence, had virtually ceased to exist by the end of the day. By the end of May 25, the 3rd Infantry Division was heading into the Velletri gap near Cori, and elements of the 1st Armored Division was within of Valmontone and were in contact with units of the Hermann Göring Division which were just starting to arrive from Leghorn. Although VI Corps had suffered over 3,300 casualties in the three days fighting, Operation Buffalo was going to plan, and Truscott was confident that a concerted attack by the 1st Armored Division and the 3rd Infantry Division the next day would get his troops astride Route 6.
On the evening of May 25, Truscott received new orders from Clark via his Operations Officer, Brigadier General Don Brand. These were, in effect, to implement Operation Turtle and turn the main line of attack 90 degrees to the left. Most importantly, although the attack towards Valmontone and Route 6 would continue, the 1st Armored Division was to withdraw to prepare to exploit the planned breakthrough along the new line of attack leaving the 3rd Infantry Division to continue towards Valmontone with the 1st Special Service Force in support. Clark informed Alexander of these developments late in the morning of May 26 by which time the change of orders was a &quot;fait accompli&quot;.

At the time, Truscott was shocked, writing later,

...I was dumbfounded. This was no time to drive to the north-west where the enemy was still strong; we should pour our maximum power into the Valmontone Gap to ensure the destruction of the retreating German Army. I would not comply with the order without first talking to General Clark in person. ... [However] he was not on the beachhead and could not be reached even by radio... such was the order that turned the main effort of the beachhead forces from the Valmontone Gap and prevented destruction of the German Tenth Army. On the 26th the order was put into effect.

He went on to write,

There has never been any doubt in my mind that had General Clark held loyally to General Alexander&#x27;s instructions, had he not changed the direction of my attack to the north-west on May 26, the strategic objectives of Anzio would have been accomplished in full. To be first in Rome was a poor compensation for this lost opportunity.

On May 26, while VI Corps was initiating its difficult maneuver, Kesselring threw elements of four divisions into the Velletri gap to stall the advance on Route 6. For four days they fought against the 3rd Infantry Division until finally withdrawing on May 30, having kept Route 6 open and allowed seven divisions from the 10th Army to withdraw and head north of Rome.
On the new axis of attack little progress was made until the 1st Armored Division was in position on May 29, when the front advanced to the main Caesar C Line defences. A quick breakthrough seemed unlikely until on May 30 36th Division (Major General Fred L. Walker) found a gap in the Caesar Line at the join between the 1st Parachute Corps and LXXVI Panzer Corps. Climbing the steep slopes of Monte Artemisio they threatened Velletri from the rear and obliged the defenders to withdraw. This was a turning point and Mackensen offered his resignation, which Kesselring accepted.

Clark assigned U.S. II Corps which, fighting its way along the coast from the Gustav Line, had joined up with VI Corps on May 25 to attack around the right-hand side of the Alban Hills and advance along the line of Route 6 to Rome. On June 2 the Caesar Line collapsed under the mounting pressure, and 14th Army commenced a fighting withdrawal through Rome. On the same day Hitler, fearing another Stalingrad, had ordered Kesselring that there should be &quot;no defence of Rome&quot;. Over the next day, the rearguards were gradually overwhelmed and Rome was entered in the early hours of June 4 with Clark holding an impromptu press conference on the steps of the Town Hall on the Capitoline Hill that morning. He ensured the event was a strictly American affair by stationing military police at road junctions to refuse entry to the city by British troops.

==Aftermath==

Although controversy continues regarding what might have happened if Lucas had been more aggressive from the start, most commentators agree that the initial plan for Anzio was flawed. They question whether the initial landing of just over two infantry divisions, with no supporting armour, had the strength to achieve the objectives: of cutting Route 6 and then holding off the inevitable counterattacks that would come, as Kesselring redeployed his forces.

Volume 5 of Churchill&#x27;s &quot;The Second World War&quot; is riddled with implied criticism of Lucas, blaming the failure on his caution. After the war, Kesselring gave his evaluation:

Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander, in his Official Dispatch, stated, &quot;The actual course of events was probably the most advantageous in the end.&quot;

Churchill defended the operation and believed that sufficient forces were available. He had clearly made great political efforts to procure certain resources, especially the extra LSTs needed to deliver a second division to shore, but also specific units useful to the attack such as with the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment. He argued that even regardless of the tactical outcome of the operation, there was immediate strategic benefit with regard to the wider war. After the landings, the German High Command dropped its plans to transfer five of Kesselring&#x27;s best divisions to Northwestern Europe. This benefited the upcoming Operation Overlord. Churchill also had to ensure the British-dominated forces in Italy were contributing to the war at a time when the Soviet Red Army were suffering tremendous losses on the Eastern Front.
Because of Clark&#x27;s change of plan, Diadem (during which the U.S. Fifth Army and the Eighth Army suffered 44,000 casualties) failed in its objective of destroying the 10th Army. It also condemned the Allies to another year of fighting in Italy, notably around the Gothic Line from August 1944 through March 1945.

The greatest loss was that if the VI Corps main effort had continued on the Valmontone axis from May 26, Clark could probably have reached Rome more quickly than by the route north-west from Cisterna. VI Corps could also have cut Highway 6 and then put much more pressure on the 10th Army than it actually did.

Alan Whicker, who was a war correspondent with the British Army&#x27;s Film and Photo Unit and was present during the fighting, later said,

The news cycle was similarly unkind to Clark. Two days after his staged press conference on Rome&#x27;s Capitolium, the &quot;advance&quot; was relegated to the back pages as reporting on the Normandy landings (D Day) took center stage June 6.

<text>A focus group is a group interview involving a small number (sometimes up to ten) of demographically predefined participants. Their reactions to specific researcher/evaluator-posed questions are studied. Focus groups are used in market research to better understand people&#x27;s reactions to products or services or participants&#x27; perceptions of shared experiences. The discussions can be guided or open. In market research, focus groups can explore a group&#x27;s response to a new product or service. As a program evaluation tool, they can elicit lessons learned and recommendations for performance improvement. The idea is for the researcher to understand participants&#x27; reactions. If group members are representative of a larger population, those reactions may be expected to reflect the views of that larger population. Thus, focus groups constitute a research or evaluation method that researchers organize to collect qualitative data through interactive and directed discussions.

A focus group is also used by sociologists, psychologists, and researchers in communication studies, education, political science, and public health. Marketers can use the information collected from focus groups to obtain insights on a specific product, controversy, or topic. U.S. Federal agencies, such as the Census Bureau for the 2020 decennial census, also use the focus group method for message testing purpose among diverse populations.

Used in qualitative research, the interviews involve a group of people who are asked about their perceptions, attitudes, opinions, beliefs, and views regarding many different topics (e.g., abortion, political candidates or issues, a shared event, needs assessment). Group members are often free to talk and interact with each other. Instead of a researcher/evaluator asking group members questions individually, focus groups use group interaction to explore and clarify participants&#x27; beliefs, opinions, and views. The interactivity of focus groups allows researchers to obtain qualitative data from multiple participants, often making focus groups a relatively expedient, convenient, and efficacious research method. While the focus group is taking place, the facilitator either takes notes and/or records the discussion for later note-taking in order to learn from the group. Researchers/evaluators should select members of the focus group carefully in order to obtain useful information. Focus groups may also include an observer who pays attention to dynamics not expressed in words e.g., body language, people who appear to have something to add but do not speak up.

==History==
Focus groups first started in the 1940s as a research method in the context of market research concerning radio soap operas. During the Second World War, Robert K. Merton set out to analyze the effectiveness of propaganda with the use of focus groups. Merton devised a procedure in which twelve participants at a radio studio would respond to negatively associated content by hitting a red button or positively associated information by hitting a green button. From there, Merton created an interviewing procedure to gain further insight into the subjective reactions of focus-group participants. He later established focus groups for the Bureau of Applied Social Research. The use of focus groups by sociologists gained popularity in the 1980s when Merton published a report on focused interviews. Paul Lazarsfeld had also received a government contract to get insight into individuals&#x27; responses to war radio propaganda.

Psychologist and marketing expert Ernest Dichter coined the term &quot;focus group&quot; itself before his death in 1991.

==Use in disciplines==
===Library and information science===

In disciplines of library and information science, when librarians intend to work on a library&#x27;s collection, they consult patrons. The focus groups librarians organize are helpful in identifying patrons&#x27; needs. In addition, teachers, other professionals, and researchers can also be recruited to participate in focus groups to ascertain those individuals&#x27; library-related needs. Focus groups can also help librarians better understand patron behavior and the impact of services on the library use.

===Social sciences===
In the social sciences and in urban planning, focus groups allow interviewers to study people in a more natural conversational pattern than typically occurs in a one-to-one interview. In combination with participant observation, focus groups can be used for learning about group attitudes and patterns of interaction. An advantage of focus groups is their fairly low cost compared to surveys because focus groups allow a researcher to obtain results relatively quickly and increase the sample size by including several people at once. Another advantage is that a focus group can allow participants to learn from one another as they exchange views and to understand research as an enriching experience. The nature of the focus group contrasts with the more typically extractive nature of traditional social science research which seeks to &quot;mine&quot; participants for data (with few benefits for participants); this difference is especially important for indigenous researchers who employ focus groups to conduct research on their own ethnic group.

===Marketing===
In marketing, focus groups are seen as an important tool for acquiring feedback regarding new products and other marketing-related topics. Focus groups are usually employed in the early stages of product or concept development, when organizations are trying to determine the overall direction of a marketing initiative. Participants are recruited on the basis of their similarity to members of the demographic groups targeted as potential consumers of the product. Focus groups allow companies wishing to develop, package, name, or test market a new product to get the perspective of potential consumers before the product is made available to the public. Focus groups can thus provide valuable information about the potential for consumer acceptance of the product.

The focus group interview is conducted informally and as naturally as possible. Participants are free to give views about any aspect of the product. These focus groups should not be confused with in-depth interviews. The moderator uses a discussion guide that has been prepared in advance of the focus group to maintain the discussion on course. Generally, the discussion moves from overall impressions of a brand or product category and becomes more specific as the discussion progresses. Stakeholders such as members of a design team are not involved in the focus group, to avoid potential bias. However, they may attend the focus group, either through video cameras or by watching through a one-way mirror.

Focus groups can provide accurate information and are less expensive than other forms of marketing research. However, there can be significant costs. For example, if a product is to be marketed on a nationwide basis, it would be helpful to conduct focus groups in various localities because the desirability of a new product may vary from place to place. Conducting focus groups in different areas of the country would require considerable expenditure on travel and lodging for moderators.

===Usability engineering===
In usability engineering, a focus group can be used to collect the feedback of software or website users. Focus groups can be applied to computer products to better understand the motivations of users and their perceptions of the product.

===Cross-cultural research===
The focus group method is developed based on white, middle-class, and adult American participants. When applied to cross-cultural settings, cultural and linguistic adaptations are important for the research to succeed; cultural sensitivity is critically important. For example, in some Asian languages, open-ended probes and nonverbal communication can encourage greater participation in the group discussion. In some non-Western cultures, a younger person does not openly disagree with an older individual; focus group composition, therefore, must be carefully considered when designing the research plan.

==Types==
Variants of focus groups include:
* Two-way focus group - one focus group watches another focus group and discusses the observed interactions and conclusion
* Dual moderator focus group - one moderator ensures the session progresses smoothly, while another ensures that all the topics are covered
* Dueling moderator focus group (fencing-moderator) - two moderators deliberately take opposite sides on the issue under discussion
* Respondent moderator focus group - one and only one of the respondents is asked to act as the moderator temporarily
* Client participant focus groups - one or more client representatives participate in the discussion, either covertly or overtly
* Mini focus groups - groups are composed of four or five members rather than 6 to 12
* Teleconference focus groups - telephone network is used
* Creativity groups
* Band obsessive group
* Online focus groups - computers connected via the internet are used
* Phone/ web focus groups - live group conducted over the phone and online with 6 to 8 participants.

===General guidelines on how to conduct focus-group discussions===
When conducting a focus-group discussion where the topic being discussed is of a sensitive nature, it is recommended that the participants be of the same sex, age-range, and socio-economic background. It is also desirable that the participants do not know each other prior to the discussion.

Informed consent must be granted before beginning the discussion. In addition, before the discussion is to begin potential group members should be briefed about the topic of discussion and informed about their rights, including the confidentiality (e.g., that their identities will not be revealed in any report or publication).

Important considerations are the homogeneity of the group members, settings, and the nature of open-ended questions, which are hoped to encourage the members to talk more freely. The discussion must be held in a relaxed setting, with the entire session recorded (audio or visual). There should also be a note-taker who writes down all important aspects of the discussion, but who is not a part of the discussion. This note-taker must have in-depth knowledge about the topic at hand, should be trained in observing verbal and non-verbal feedback (for example, noting facial expressions), and whose duty is to translate the notes taken during session into data for analysis.

Areas of interest to be discussed during the session need to be specified by the moderators and organizers prior to the session. The moderator makes sure that all these areas are covered during the discussion. He or she introduces new topics, directs the conversation and encourages participation while trying to minimize bias.

The moderator should create an environment that encourages members to share their views, while keeping track of the discussion and preventing it from drifting from the topic at hand. Because the participants often do not know each other, the moderator must ensure that everyone feels comfortable and there is good rapport. The purpose and format of the discussion should be made clear at the beginning of the session. All participants should be encouraged to participate, share their views, and be told that divergent views are welcome.

Flick writes that a formal explanation of the procedure should be given to the participants. Expectation-setting is an essential component in this step. Expectations can include being involved in the discussion, arguing about certain topics, and collective problem-solving. Introducing the members to one another and having a &quot;warm up&quot; can help prepare the participants for the discussion. The moderator must establish common ground for the participants in order to facilitate community feeling. The actual discussion takes place following &quot;discussion stimuli,&quot; which may be in the form of a provocative thesis, a short film, lecture on a text, or unfolding of a concrete problem for which a solution needs to be found.

The questions should be open ended. However, there should be a smooth transition from one question to the next. The session should ideally start with introductory questions to address the general topic, helping the participants to understand the broader context. The general questions should be followed by questions designed to elicit the specific information sought. The focus group should end with efforts to summarize the opinions of the participants.

== Online focus groups ==
Focus groups typically are conducted face-to-face, but the development of new technologies has enabled investigators to conduct qualitative research online. Two types of online methods, synchronous and asynchronous, have emerged. Synchronous methods allow researchers to conduct live discussions. Synchronous online discussions attempt to mimic in-person focus groups. Barriers to the success of synchronous online focus groups include the problem of arriving at a convenient time for all participants and lack of accessibility for some participants.

Asynchronous methods collect participant information through online communication such as forums and email lists. Asynchronous online focus groups have a number barriers to success. These barriers include sporadic participation over time, making the research less timely. The benefits of online both synchronous and asynchronous focus groups include the absence of a need for transportation and ease of access.

A major advantage of online focus groups is that they allow geographically diverse individuals to participate. A disadvantage is a reduced capacity to assess non-verbal behavior; assessing non-verbal behavior can be helpful to qualitative researchers.

==Discussions==
* Group discussion can produce data and insights that would be less accessible without the interaction found in a group setting. The idea is that listening to one individual&#x27;s description of his or her experiences stimulates ideas and memories of experiences in fellow participants. This process is also known as the group effect; group members engage in &quot;a kind of ‘chaining’ or ‘cascading’ effect; talk links to, or tumbles out of, the topics and expressions preceding it&quot; (Lindlof &amp; Taylor, 2002, p. 182)
* Group members discover a common language to describe similar experiences. This enables the capture of a form of &quot;native language&quot; or &quot;vernacular speech&quot; to understand the situation
* Focus groups also provide an opportunity for disclosure among similar others in a setting where participants are validated. For example, in the context of workplace bullying, targeted employees often find themselves in situations where they experience a lack of voice and feelings of isolation. Use of focus groups to study workplace bullying, therefore, serves as both an efficacious and ethical venue for collecting such data (see, e.g., Tracy, Lutgen-Sandvik, &amp; Alberts, 2006) Of course, collecting data on workplace bullying requires the research team to protect the members of the group and put an end to the bullying.
* The interactive, discussion-based context of focus groups can illustrate how meanings are produced intersubjectively. Meaning production is naturally a socially shared process, making focus groups a useful method for researching the attitudes, experiences, and understandings of individuals and groups.

==Advantages of focus groups==
Focus groups have several advantages for collecting qualitative research data. Focus group research can be used purely as a qualitative method or in combination with quantitative methods. Qualitative data collected in focus groups can help researchers decide what kinds of items to include in surveys. The moderator can inquire into and examine unforeseen issues with that arise in the context of the discussion. The format has a kind of face-validity and is naturalistic in that the discussion can include storytelling, joking, disagreements, and boasting. Running focus groups is straightforward and relatively inexpensive. Focus groups ordinarily consume less time than structured interviews, thus increasing sample sizes, lessening resource investment, and providing fast results. Focus groups tend to be more efficient when the data being gathered are related to the researcher&#x27;s interests. They are helpful and important for needs assessments and project evaluations. A focus group discussion can create a synergy that can provide information that can&#x27;t be gained in other ways. Vocabulary can be observed. New, insightful perspectives and opinions are obtained. Sensitive topics can be discussed, leading to personal disclosures. The moderator maintains the discussion and makes sure no one individual can dominate the group, thus creating a more &quot;egalitarian&quot; context. Non-verbal behavior plays a role in the moderator&#x27;s decision-making and research results, increasing the chances of obtaining rich, in-depth information. Previously neglected or unnoticed phenomena can be brought to the researcher&#x27;s attention.

==Problems and criticism==

Although the focus-group method of data collection has several advantages, the method also has limitations. The focus group method provides little experimental control. Data collected are usually difficult to analyze. The discussion must be audio or videotaped, field notes have to be recorded, and comments must be transcribed verbatim, increasing the risk of error. The method requires carefully trained interviewers. Groups may vary considerably and investigators may have difficulty assembling the appropriate group. Discussion must be conducted in an environment that is conducive to conversation. There is also the potential for discussion facilitators to ask leading questions that produce biased results. The ability of the leader to facilitate the discussion may be critical, as the group largely relies on the assisted discussion in order to produce results. Thus, there is the need for skilled group leaders. There is a risk that a leader could dominate or &#x27;hijack&#x27; the discussion. Results obtained may be biased, when one or two participants dominate the discussion. The representativeness of the sample is likely to be a concern. Generalizing knowledge learned about the sample may not generalize to population because participants are self-selected. The moderator may influence the group interactions, thus distorting results or findings. The participants&#x27; involvement in, and contribution to, the discussion plays a major role. Problems may arise if topics are controversial in nature, leading to disagreements and arguments. Dealing with sensitive topics is a challenge. A contrived or artificial environment may influence the interactions, and thus bias responses. Ethical issues may arise regarding confidentiality. Psychometric validity may be low.

A fundamental difficulty with focus groups (and other forms of qualitative research) is the issue of &quot;observer dependency&quot;: the results obtained are influenced by the researcher or his or her reading of the group&#x27;s discussion, thus raising questions of the validity of the research (see experimenter&#x27;s bias).
Focus groups are &quot;One-shot case studies&quot; especially if they are measuring a property-disposition relationship within the social sciences, unless they are repeated. Focus groups can create severe issues of external validity, especially the reactive effects of the testing arrangement. Other common (and related) criticism involve groupthink and social desirability bias.

Another problem is with the setting of the focus group. If a focus group is held in a laboratory setting with a moderator who is a professor and the recording instrument is obtrusive, the participants may either hold back on their responses and/or try to answer the moderator&#x27;s questions with answers the participants feel that the moderator wants to hear. Another problem with the focus group setting is the lack of anonymity. With multiple participants, confidentiality cannot be assured.

Douglas Rushkoff argued that focus groups are often useless and frequently create more problems than the problems the groups are intended to solve. Because focus groups often aim to please their underwriters rather than provide independent opinions or evaluations, the data are sometimes cherry picked to support a foregone conclusion. Rushkoff cited the disastrous introduction of New Coke in the 1980s as an example of focus group design, implementation, and analysis gone bad.

Jonathan Ive, Apple&#x27;s senior vice president of industrial design, noted that Apple had found a good reason not to employ focus groups. He said that &quot;They just ensure that you don’t offend anyone, and produce bland inoffensive products.&quot;

==Data analysis==

The analysis of focus group data presents both challenges and opportunities when compared to other types of qualitative data. Some authors have suggested that data should be analyzed in the same manner as interview data, while others have suggested that the unique features of focus group data – particularly the opportunity that it provides to observe interactions between group members - means that distinctive forms of analysis should be used. Data analysis can take place at the level of the individual or the group.

Focus group data provides the opportunity to analyze the strength with which an individual holds an opinion. If they are presented with opposing opinions or directly challenged, the individual may either modify their position or defend it. Bringing together all the comments that an individual makes in order can enable the researcher to determine whether their view changes in the course of discussion and, if so, further examination of the transcript may reveal which contributions by other focus group members brought about the change.

At the collective level, focus group data can sometimes reveal shared understandings or common views. However, there is a danger that a consensus can be assumed when not every person has spoken: the researcher will need to consider carefully whether the people who have not expressed a view agree with the majority or whether they may simply be unwilling to voice their disagreement.

Many computer programs are available to help in analyzing qualitative data. The capacity of computers to effectively sort, store, and retrieve information makes their use in qualitative data analysis appealing. However, it is important to be aware that computers can only aid in some parts of the analysis of qualitative data; computer software does not code data nor can replace conceptual analysis. It cannot analyze qualitative data for the researcher.

== Exercises ==
Various creative activity-oriented questions can serve as supplements to verbal questions including but not limited to the following:
* Free listings – participants produce a list of all elements of a domain 
* Rating – participants have a list of items which must be rated on a scale, typically using numbers or adjectives
* Ranking – participants can either receive a list of items to rank according to a specified dimension or participants can combine items in pairs to compare elements in the pairs
* Pile sorting – participants sort cards representing elements of a domain into piles according to their similarities and differences
* Picture sort – Participants are distributed selected pictures from magazines or photographs to sort through, finding matches of a definite characteristic or that best represent a certain category
* Magic tools and fantasy – the moderator can literally or symbolically pass around a &quot;magical&quot; tool to each participant as he or she shares a fantasy, dream, or idea
* Storytelling – participants create a narrative around the topic of interest to make others think about a solution to a problem, gauge reactions to a situation, and observe attitudes towards the topic under study
* Role-playing – participants demonstrate through action how they would behave or act in a situation, how they would solve a problem, or deal with a difficulty
* Sentence completion – participants are given printed out partial sentences on a topic to complete and share within a group
* Collage – a moderator assigns a theme and then distributes print materials to participants (who are divided into small groups), so they can use these materials, drawings, and their own words to create a relevant collage.

<doc id="199040" wikidata="Q182527" url="?curid=199040" title="Chemical equation">
<text>A chemical equation is the symbolic representation of a chemical reaction in the form of symbols and chemical formulas. The reactant entities are given on the left-hand side and the product entities are on the right-hand side with a plus sign between the entities in both the reactants and the products, and an arrow that points towards the products to show the direction of the reaction. The chemical formulas may be symbolic, structural (pictorial diagrams), or intermixed. The coefficients next to the symbols and formulas of entities are the absolute values of the stoichiometric numbers. The first chemical equation was diagrammed by Jean Beguin in 1615.

==Structure==
A chemical equation (see an example below) consists of a list of reactants (the starting substances) on the left-hand side, an arrow symbol, and a list of products (substances formed in the chemical reaction) on the right-hand side. Each substance is specified by its chemical formula, optionally preceded by a number called stoichiometric coefficient. The coefficient specifies how many entities (e.g. molecules) of that substance are involved in the reaction on a molecular basis. If not written explicitly, the coefficient is equal to 1. Multiple substances on any side of the equation are separated from each other by a plus sign.

As an example, the equation for the reaction of hydrochloric acid with sodium can be denoted:

Given the formulas are fairly simple, this equation could be read as &quot;two H-C-L plus two N-A yields two N-A-C-L and H two.&quot; Alternately, and in general for equations involving complex chemicals, the chemical formulas are read using IUPAC nomenclature, which could verbalise this equation as &quot;two hydrochloric acid molecules and two sodium atoms react to form two formula units of sodium chloride and a hydrogen gas molecule.&quot;

===Reaction types===
Different variants of the arrow symbol are used to denote the type of a reaction:

===State of matter===
To indicate physical state of a chemical, a symbol in parentheses may be appended to its formula: (s) for a solid, (l) for a liquid, (g) for a gas, and (aq) for an aqueous solution. This is especially done when one wishes to emphasize the states or changes thereof. For example, the reaction of aqueous hydrochloric acid with solid (metallic) sodium to form aqueous sodium chloride and hydrogen gas would be written like this:

That reaction would have different thermodynamic and kinetic properties if gaseous hydrogen chloride were to replace the hydrochloric acid as a reactant:

Alternately, an arrow without parentheses is used in some cases to indicate formation of a gas ↑ or precipitate ↓. This is especially useful if only one such species is formed. Here is an example indicating that hydrogen gas is formed:

===Catalysis and other conditions===
If the reaction requires energy, it is indicated above the arrow. A capital Greek letter delta (Δ) or a triangle (△) is put on the reaction arrow to show that energy in the form of heat is added to the reaction. The expression is used as a symbol for the addition of energy in the form of light. Other symbols are used for other specific types of energy or radiation. 

Similarly, if a reaction requires a certain medium with certain specific characteristics, then the name of the acid or base that is used as a medium may be placed on top of the arrow. If no specific acid or base is required, another way of denoting the use of an acidic or basic medium is to write H+ or OH− (or even &quot;acid&quot; or &quot;base&quot;) on top of the arrow. Specific conditions of the temperature and pressure, as well as the presence of catalysts, may be indicated in the same way.

===Notation variants===
The standard notation for chemical equations only permits all reactants on one side, all products on the other, and all stoichiometric coefficients positive. For example, the usual form of the equation for dehydration of methanol to dimethylether is:

Sometimes an extension is used, where some substances with their stoichiometric coefficients are moved above or below the arrow, preceded by a plus sign or nothing for a reactant, and by a minus sign for a product. Then the same equation can look like this:
: &lt;chem&gt;2 CH3OH -&gt;[\overset{}\ce{-H2O}] CH3OCH3&lt;/chem&gt;

Such notation serves to hide less important substances from the sides of the equation, to make the type of reaction at hand more obvious, and to facilitate chaining of chemical equations. This is very useful in illustrating multi-step reaction mechanisms. Note that the substances above or below the arrows are not catalysts in this case, because they are consumed or produced in the reaction like ordinary reactants or products.

Another extension used in reaction mechanisms moves some substances to branches of the arrow. Both extensions are used in the example illustration of a mechanism.

Use of negative stoichiometric coefficients at either side of the equation (like in the example below) is not widely adopted and is often discouraged.
: &lt;chem&gt;2 CH3OH \;-\; H2O -&gt; CH3OCH3&lt;/chem&gt;

== Balancing chemical equations ==
Because no nuclear reactions take place in a chemical reaction, the chemical elements pass through the reaction unchanged. Thus, each side of the chemical equation must represent the same number of atoms of any particular element (or nuclide, if different isotopes are taken into account). The same holds for the total electric charge, as stated by the charge conservation law. An equation adhering to these requirements is said to be balanced.

A chemical equation is balanced by assigning suitable values to the stoichiometric coefficients. Simple equations can be balanced by inspection, that is, by trial and error. Another technique involves solving a system of linear equations.

Balanced equations are usually written with smallest natural-number coefficients. Yet sometimes it may be advantageous to accept a fractional coefficient, if it simplifies the other coefficients. The introductory example can thus be rewritten as
:&lt;chem&gt;HCl + Na -&gt; NaCl + 1/2 H2&lt;/chem&gt;

In some circumstances the fractional coefficients are even inevitable. For example, the reaction corresponding to the standard enthalpy of formation must be written such that one molecule of a single product is formed. This will often require that some reactant coefficients be fractional, as is the case with the formation of lithium fluoride:

:&lt;chem&gt;Li(s) + 1/2F2(g) -&gt; LiF(s)&lt;/chem&gt;

=== Inspection method ===

The method of inspection can be outlined as setting the most complex substance&#x27;s stoichiometric coefficient to 1 and assigning values to other coefficients step by step such that both sides of the equation end up with the same number of atoms for each element. If any fractional coefficients arise during this process, the presence of fractions may be eliminated (at any time) by multiplying all coefficients by their lowest common denominator.

; Example
Balancing of the chemical equation for the complete combustion of methane
:::&lt;chem&gt;\mathord{?}\,{CH4} + \mathord{?}\,{O2} -&gt; \mathord{?}\,{CO2} + \mathord{?}\,{H2O}&lt;/chem&gt;
is achieved as follows:

# A coefficient of 1 is placed in front of the most complex formula (CH4):
#:&lt;chem&gt;1 {CH4} + \mathord{?}\,{O2} -&gt; \mathord{?}\,{CO2} + \mathord{?}\,{H2O}&lt;/chem&gt;
# The left-hand side has 1 carbon atom, so 1 molecule of CO2 will balance it. The left-hand side also has 4 hydrogen atoms, which will be balanced by 2 molecules of H2O:
#:&lt;chem&gt;1 {CH4} + \mathord{?}\,{O2} -&gt; 1 {CO2} + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
# Balancing the 4 oxygen atoms of the right-hand side by 2 molecules of O2 yields the equation
#:&lt;chem&gt;1 CH4 + 2 O2 -&gt; 1 CO2 + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
# The coefficients equal to 1 are omitted, as they do not need to be specified explicitly:
#:&lt;chem&gt;CH4 + 2 O2 -&gt; CO2 + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
# It is wise to check that the final equation is balanced, i.e. that for each element there is the same number of atoms on the left- and right-hand side: 1 carbon, 4 hydrogen, and 4 oxygen.

=== System of linear equations ===
For each chemical element (or nuclide or unchanged moiety or charge) , its conservation requirement can be expressed by the mathematical equation

:formula_1

where
: is the number of atoms of element in a molecule of substance (per formula in the chemical equation), and
: is the stoichiometric coefficient for the substance .

This results in a homogeneous system of linear equations, which are readily solved using mathematical methods. Such system always has the all-zeros trivial solution, which we are not interested in, but if there are any additional solutions, there will be infinite number of them. Any non-trivial solution will balance the chemical equation. A &quot;preferred&quot; solution is one with whole-number, mostly positive stoichiometric coefficients with greatest common divisor equal to one.

==== Example ====
Let us assign variables to stoichiometric coefficients of the chemical equation from the previous section and write the corresponding linear equations:

:&lt;chem&gt;\mathit{s}_1 {CH4} + \mathit{s}_2 {O2} -&gt; \mathit{s}_3 {CO2} + \mathit{s}_4 {H2O}&lt;/chem&gt;
formula_2

All solutions to this system of linear equations are of the following form, where is any real number:

:formula_3

The choice of yields the preferred solution,

:formula_4

which corresponds to the balanced chemical equation:

:&lt;chem&gt;CH4 + 2 O2 -&gt; CO2 + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

=== Matrix method ===
The system of linear equations introduced in the previous section can also be written using an efficient matrix formalism. First, to unify the reactant and product stoichiometric coefficients , let us introduce the quantity

:formula_5

called stoichiometric number, which simplifies the linear equations to

:formula_6

where is the total number of reactant and product substances (formulas) in the chemical equation.

Placement of the values at row and column of the composition matrix

:formula_7

and arrangement of the stoichiometric numbers into the stoichiometric vector

:formula_8

allows the system of equations to be expressed as a single matrix equation:

Like previously, any nonzero stoichiometric vector , which solves the matrix equation, will balance the chemical equation.

The set of solutions to the matrix equation is a linear space called the kernel of the matrix . For this space to contain nonzero vectors , i.e. to have a positive dimension N, the columns of the composition matrix must not be linearly independent. The problem of balancing a chemical equation then becomes the problem of determining the N-dimensional kernel of the composition matrix. It is important to note that only for N = 1 will there be a unique preferred solution to the balancing problem. For N &gt; 1 there will be an infinite number of preferred solutions with N of them linearly independent. If N = 0, there will be only the unusable trivial solution, the zero vector.

Techniques have been developed to quickly calculate a set of N independent solutions to the balancing problem, which are superior to the inspection and in that they are determinative and yield all solutions to the balancing problem.

; Example
Using the same chemical equation again, write the corresponding matrix equation:

:&lt;chem&gt;\mathit{s}_1 {CH4} + \mathit{s}_2 {O2} -&gt; \mathit{s}_3 {CO2} + \mathit{s}_4 {H2O}&lt;/chem&gt;
:formula_9
Its solutions are of the following form, where is any real number:

:formula_10

The choice of and a sign-flip of the first two rows yields the preferred solution to the balancing problem:

:formula_11

==Ionic equations==

An ionic equation is a chemical equation in which electrolytes are written as dissociated ions. Ionic equations are used for single and double displacement reactions that occur in aqueous solutions.

For example, in the following precipitation reaction:
:&lt;chem&gt;CaCl2 + 2AgNO3 -&gt; Ca(NO3)2 + 2 AgCl(v)&lt;/chem&gt;
the full ionic equation is:
:&lt;chem&gt;Ca^2+ + 2Cl^- + 2Ag+ + 2NO3^- -&gt; Ca^2+ + 2NO3^- + 2AgCl(v)&lt;/chem&gt;
or, with all physical states included:
:&lt;chem&gt;Ca^2+(aq) + 2Cl^{-}(aq) + 2Ag+(aq) + 2NO3^{-}(aq) -&gt; Ca^2+(aq) + 2NO3^{-}(aq) + 2AgCl(v)&lt;/chem&gt;

In this reaction, the Ca2+ and the NO3− ions remain in solution and are not part of the reaction. That is, these ions are identical on both the reactant and product side of the chemical equation. Because such ions do not participate in the reaction, they are called spectator ions. A &quot;net ionic&quot; equation is the full ionic equation from which the spectator ions have been removed. The net ionic equation of the proceeding reactions is:
:&lt;chem&gt;2Cl^- + 2Ag+ -&gt; 2AgCl(v)&lt;/chem&gt;

or, in &quot;reduced&quot; balanced form,
:&lt;chem&gt;Ag+ + Cl^- -&gt; AgCl(v)&lt;/chem&gt;

In a neutralization or acid/base reaction, the net ionic equation will usually be:
:&lt;chem&gt;H+ (aq) + OH^{-}(aq) -&gt; H2O(l)&lt;/chem&gt;

There are a few acid/base reactions that produce a precipitate in addition to the water molecule shown above. An example is the reaction of barium hydroxide with phosphoric acid, which produces not only water but also the insoluble salt barium phosphate. In this reaction, there are no spectator ions, so the net ionic equation is the same as the full ionic equation.

:&lt;chem&gt;3Ba(OH)2 + 2H3PO4 -&gt; 6H2O + Ba3(PO4)2(v)&lt;/chem&gt;
:formula_12

Double displacement reactions that feature a carbonate reacting with an acid have the net ionic equation:

:formula_13

If every ion is a &quot;spectator ion&quot; then there was no reaction, and the net ionic equation is null.

Generally, if &quot;zj&quot; is the multiple of elementary charge on the &quot;j-th&quot; molecule, charge neutrality may be written as:

:formula_14

where the &quot;νj&quot; are the stoichiometric coefficients described above. The &quot;zj&quot; may be incorporated
as an additional row in the &quot;aij&quot; matrix described above, and a properly balanced ionic equation will then also obey:

:formula_6

<doc id="199051" wikidata="Q118418" url="?curid=199051" title="Antisocial personality disorder">
<text>Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is a personality disorder defined by a chronic pattern of behavior that disregards the rights and well-being of others. People with ASPD often exhibit behavior that conflicts with social norms, leading to issues with interpersonal relationships, employment, and legal matters. The condition generally manifests in childhood or early adolescence, with a high rate of associated conduct problems and a tendency for symptoms to peak in late adolescence and early adulthood.

The prognosis for ASPD is complex, with high variability in outcomes. Individuals with severe ASPD symptoms may have difficulty forming stable relationships, maintaining employment, and avoiding criminal behavior, resulting in higher rates of divorce, unemployment, homelessness, and incarceration. In extreme cases, ASPD may lead to violent or criminal behaviors, often escalating in early adulthood. Research indicates that individuals with ASPD have an elevated risk of suicide, particularly those who also engage in substance misuse or have a history of incarceration. Additionally, children raised by parents with ASPD may be at greater risk of delinquency and mental health issues themselves.

Although ASPD is a persistent and often lifelong condition, symptoms may diminish over time, particularly after age 40, though only a small percentage of individuals experience significant improvement. Many individuals with ASPD have co-occurring issues such as substance use disorders, mood disorders, or other personality disorder. Research on pharmacological treatment for ASPD is limited, with no medications approved specifically for the disorder. However, certain psychiatric medications, including antipsychotics, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers, may help manage symptoms like aggression and impulsivity in some cases, or treat co-occurring disorders.

The diagnostic criteria and understanding of ASPD have evolved significantly over time. Early diagnostic manuals, such as the DSM-I in 1952, described “sociopathic personality disturbance” as involving a range of antisocial behaviors linked to societal and environmental factors. Subsequent editions of the DSM have refined the diagnosis, eventually distinguishing ASPD in the DSM-III (1980) with a more structured checklist of observable behaviors. Current definitions in the DSM-5 align with the clinical description of ASPD as a pattern of disregard for the rights of others, with potential overlap in traits associated with psychopathy and sociopathy.

== Symptoms and behaviors ==
Due to tendencies toward recklessness and impulsivity, patients with ASPD are at a higher risk of drug and alcohol abuse. ASPD is the personality disorder most likely to be associated with addiction. Individuals with ASPD are at a higher risk of illegal drug usage, blood-borne diseases, HIV, shorter periods of abstinence, misuse of oral administrations, and compulsive gambling as a consequence of their tendency towards addiction. In addition, sufferers are more likely to abuse substances or develop an addiction at a young age.

Due to ASPD being associated with higher levels of impulsivity, suicidality, and irresponsible behavior, the condition is correlated with heightened levels of aggressive behavior, domestic violence, illegal drug use, pervasive anger, and violent crimes. This behavior typically has negative effects on their education, relationships, and/or employment. Alongside this, sexual behaviors of risk such as having multiple sexual partners in a short period of time, seeing prostitutes, inconsistent use of condoms, trading sex for drugs, and frequent unprotected sex are also common.

Patients with ASPD have been documented to describe emotions with ambivalence and experience heightened states of emotional coldness and detachment. Individuals with ASPD, or who display antisocial behavior, may often experience chronic boredom. They may experience emotions such as happiness and fear less clearly than others. It is also possible that they may experience emotions such as anger and frustration more frequently and clearly than other emotions.

People with ASPD may have a limited capacity for empathy and can be more interested in benefiting themselves than avoiding harm to others. They may have no regard for morals, social norms, or the rights of others. People with ASPD can have difficulty beginning or sustaining relationships. It is common for the interpersonal relationships of someone with ASPD to revolve around the exploitation and abuse of others. People with ASPD may display arrogance, think lowly and negatively of others, have limited remorse for their harmful actions, and have a callous attitude toward those they have harmed.

People with ASPD can have difficulty mentalizing, or interpreting the mental state of others. Alternately, they may display a perfectly intact theory of mind, or the ability to understand one&#x27;s mental state, but have an impaired ability to understand how another individual may be affected by an aggressive action. These factors might contribute to aggressive and criminal behavior as well as empathy deficits. Despite this, they may be adept at social cognition, or the ability to process and store information about other people, which can contribute to an increased ability to manipulate others.

ASPD is highly prevalent among prisoners. People with ASPD tend to be convicted more, receive longer sentences, and are more likely to be charged with almost any crime, with assault and other violent crimes being the most common charges. Those who have committed violent crimes tend to have higher levels of testosterone than the average person, also contributing to the higher likelihood for men to be diagnosed with ASPD. The effect of testosterone is counteracted by cortisol, which facilitates the cognitive control of impulsive tendencies.

Arson and the destruction of others&#x27; property are also behaviors commonly associated with ASPD. Alongside other conduct problems, many people with ASPD had conduct disorder in their youth, characterized by a pervasive pattern of violent, criminal, defiant, and anti-social behavior.

Although behaviors vary by degree, individuals with this personality disorder have been known to exploit others in harmful ways for their own gain or pleasure, and frequently manipulate and deceive other people. While some do so with a façade of superficial charm, others do so through intimidation and violence. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder may deliberately show irresponsibility, have difficulty acknowledging their faults and/or attempt to redirect attention away from harmful behaviors.

===Comorbidity===
ASPD presents high comorbidity rates with various psychiatric conditions, particularly substance use and mood disorder. Individuals diagnosed with ASPD are significantly more prone to develop substance use disorder (SUDs), with studies showing that they are approximately 13 times more likely to be diagnosed with a SUD than those without ASPD. This population also faces increased risks for mood disorders, including a fourfold likelihood of experiencing major depressive disorder, as well as heightened risks for suicidal ideation and behaviors. Anxiety disorders, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and social anxiety disorder, are also common comorbidities, affecting up to 50% of individuals with ASPD. These comorbidities often exacerbate the problems of those with ASPD, leading to more severe symptoms, complex treatment needs, and poorer clinical outcomes.

When combined with alcoholism, people may show frontal brain function deficits on neuropsychological tests greater than those associated with each condition. Alcohol use disorder is likely caused by lack of impulse and behavioral control exhibited by antisocial personality disorder patients.

==Causes==
Personality disorders are generally believed to be caused by a combination and interaction of genetics and environmental influences. People with an antisocial or alcoholic parent are considered to be at higher risk of developing ASPD. Fire-setting and cruelty to animals during childhood are also linked to the development of an antisocial personality disorder, along with being more common in males and among incarcerated populations. Although the causes listed correlate to the risk of developing ASPD, one factor alone is unlikely to be the only cause associated with ASPD and relating to a listed cause does not necessarily mean that a person should identify or be identified as having ASPD.

According to professor Emily Simonoff of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, there are many variables that are consistently connected to ASPD, such as: childhood hyperactivity and conduct disorder, criminality in adulthood, lower IQ scores, and reading problems. Additionally, children who grow up with a predisposition of ASPD and interact with other delinquent children are likely to later be diagnosed with ASPD.

=== Genetic ===
Research into genetic associations in antisocial personality disorder suggests that ASPD has some or even a strong genetic basis. The prevalence of ASPD is higher in people related to someone with the disorder. Twin studies, which are designed to discern between genetic and environmental effects, have reported significant genetic influences on antisocial behavior and conduct disorder.

In the specific genes that may be involved, one gene that has shown particular promise in its correlation with ASPD is the gene that encodes for monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), an enzyme that breaks down monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine. Various studies examining the gene&#x27;s relationship to behavior have suggested that variants of the gene resulting in less MAO-A being produced (such as the 2R and 3R alleles of the promoter region) have associations with aggressive behavior in men.

This association is also influenced by negative experiences early in life, with children possessing a low-activity variant (MAOA-L) who have experienced negative circumstances being more likely to develop antisocial behavior than those with the high-activity variant (MAOA-H). Even when environmental interactions (e.g., emotional abuse) are taken out of the equation, a small association between MAOA-L and aggressive and antisocial behavior remains.

The gene that encodes for the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), a gene that is heavily researched for its associations with other mental disorders, is another gene of interest in antisocial behavior and personality traits. Genetic association&#x27;s studies have suggested that the short &quot;S&quot; allele is associated with impulsive antisocial behavior and ASPD in the inmate population.

However, research into psychopathy find that the long &quot;L&quot; allele is associated with the Factor 1 traits of psychopathy, which describes its core affective (e.g. lack of empathy, fearlessness) and interpersonal (e.g. grandiosity, manipulativeness) personality disturbances. This is suggestive of two different forms of the disorder, one associated more with impulsive behavior and emotional dysregulation, and the other with predatory aggression and affective disturbance.

Various other gene candidates for ASPD have been identified by a genome-wide association study published in 2016. Several of these gene candidates are shared with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, with which ASPD is often comorbid. The study found that those who carry four mutations on chromosome 6 are 50% more likely to develop antisocial personality disorder than those who do not.

=== Physiological ===
====Hormones and neurotransmitters====
Traumatic events can lead to a disruption of the standard development of the central nervous system, which can generate a release of hormones that can change normal patterns of development.

One of the neurotransmitters that has been discussed in individuals with ASPD is serotonin, also known as 5-HT. A meta-analysis of 20 studies found significantly lower 5-HIAA levels (indicating lower serotonin levels), especially in those who are younger than 30 years of age.

While it has been shown that lower levels of serotonin may be associated with ASPD, there has also been evidence that decreased serotonin function is highly correlated with impulsiveness and aggression across a number of different experimental paradigms. Impulsivity is not only linked with irregularities in 5-HT metabolism but may be the most essential psychopathological aspect linked with such dysfunction. Correspondingly, the DSM classifies &quot;impulsivity or failure to plan ahead&quot; and &quot;irritability and aggressiveness&quot; as two of seven sub-criteria in category A of the diagnostic criteria of ASPD.

Some studies have found a relationship between monoamine oxidase A and antisocial behavior, including conduct disorder and symptoms of adult ASPD, in maltreated children.

====Neurological====
Antisocial behavior may be related to a number of neurological defects, such as head trauma. Antisocial behavior is associated with decreased grey matter in the right lentiform nucleus, left insular, and frontopolar cortex. Increased volumes of grey matter have been observed in the right fusiform gyrus, inferior parietal cortex, right cingulate gyrus, and post-central cortex.

Intellectual and cognitive ability is often found to be impaired or reduced in the ASPD population. Contrary to stereotypes in popular culture of the &quot;psychopathic genius&quot;, antisocial personality disorder is associated with reduced overall intelligence and specific reductions in individual aspects of cognitive ability. These deficits also occur in general-population samples of people with antisocial traits and in children with the precursors to antisocial personality disorder.

People that exhibit antisocial behavior tend to demonstrate decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex, and is more apparent in functional neuroimaging as opposed to structural neuroimaging. Some investigators have questioned whether the reduced volume in prefrontal regions is associated with antisocial personality disorder, or whether they result from co-morbid disorders, such as substance use disorder or childhood maltreatment. It is still considered an open question if the anatomical abnormality causes the psychological and behavioral abnormality, or vice versa.

Antisocial behavior is also associated with structural brain differences. Some of the major areas involved are areas of the prefrontal cortex, such as the right frontal and temporal cortices, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the middle and orbitofrontal cortices. In these areas, a reduction in gray matter is seen in individuals with antisocial personality disorder, suggesting these structural differences may play a role in their behavior. Reduced gray matter volumes in these areas are in fact associated with a lack of emotional regulation, a lack of behavioral and response inhibition, and poor decision making among other affects.  Additionally, those with ASPD have shown decreased gray matter volumes in other brain areas such as the amygdala and insula, suggesting possible issues with emotional reactions to certain stimuli. People that exhibit antisocial behavior also tend to demonstrate decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex, as is apparent in functional neuroimaging.

Cavum septi pellucidi (CSP) is a marker for limbic neural maldevelopment, and its presence has been loosely associated with certain mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder. One study found that those with CSP had significantly higher levels of antisocial personality, psychopathy, arrests and convictions compared with controls.

=== Environmental ===
==== Family environment ====
Many studies suggest that the social and home environment contribute to the development of ASPD. Parents of children with ASPD may display antisocial behavior themselves, which are then adopted by their children. A lack of parental stimulation and affection during early development can lead to high levels of cortisol with the absence of balancing hormones such as oxytocin.

This disrupts and overloads the child&#x27;s stress response systems, which is thought to lead to underdevelopment of the part of the child&#x27;s brain that deals with emotion, empathy, and ability to connect to other humans on an emotional level. According to Dr. Bruce Perry in his book &quot;The Boy Who Was Raised as a Dog,&quot; &quot;the infant&#x27;s developing brain needs to be patterned, repetitive stimuli to develop properly. Spastic, unpredictable relief from fear, loneliness, discomfort, and hunger keeps a baby&#x27;s stress system on high alert. An environment of intermittent care punctuated by total abandonment may be the worst of all worlds for a child.&quot;

==== Parenting styles ====
Some hypothesise that parenting styles can affect how children experience and develop in their youth, and can have an impact on a child&#x27;s diagnosis of ASPD.

==== Childhood trauma ====
ASPD is highly comorbid with emotional and physical abuse in childhood. Physical neglect also has a significant correlation to ASPD. The way a child bonds with its parents early in life is important. Poor parental bonding due to abuse or neglect puts children at greater risk for developing antisocial personality disorder. There is also a significant correlation with parental overprotection and people who develop ASPD.

Those with ASPD may have experienced any of the following forms of childhood trauma or abuse: physical or sexual abuse, neglect, coercion, abandonment or separation from caregivers, violence in a community, acts of terror, bullying, or life-threatening incidents. Some symptoms can mimic other forms of mental illness, such as:

* post-traumatic stress disorder (symptoms of upsetting/terrifying memories of traumatic events)
* reactive attachment disorder (little to no response regarding emotional triggers)
* disinhibited social engagement disorder (roaming off with people you don&#x27;t know without caregivers being informed)
* dissociative identity disorder (disconnection from self or environment)

The comorbidity rate of the previously listed disorders with ASPD tend to be much higher.

==== Cultural influences ====
The sociocultural perspective of clinical psychology views disorders as influenced by cultural aspects; since cultural norms differ significantly, mental disorders (such as ASPD) are viewed differently. Robert D. Hare suggested that the rise in ASPD that has been reported in the United States may be linked to changes in cultural norms, serving to validate the behavioral tendencies of many individuals with ASPD. While the rise reported may be in part a byproduct of the widening use (and abuse) of diagnostic techniques, given Eric Berne&#x27;s division between individuals with active and latent ASPD – the latter keeping themselves in check by attachment to an external source of control like the law, traditional standards, or religion – it has been suggested that the erosion of collective standards may serve to release the individual with latent ASPD from their previously prosocial behavior.

There is also a continuous debate as to the extent to which the legal system should be involved in the identification and admittance of patients with preliminary symptoms of ASPD. Controversial clinical psychiatrist Pierre-Édouard Carbonneau suggested that the problem with legal forced admittance is the rate of failure when diagnosing ASPD. He contends that the possibility of diagnosing and coercing a patient into prescribing medication to someone without ASPD, but is diagnosed with ASPD, could be potentially disastrous. But the possibility of not diagnosing ASPD and seeing a patient go untreated because of a lack of sufficient evidence of cultural or environmental influences is something a psychiatrist must ignore; and in his words, &quot;play it safe&quot;.

===Conduct disorder===

While antisocial personality disorder is a mental disorder diagnosed in adulthood, it has its precedent in childhood. The DSM-5&#x27;s criteria for ASPD require that the individual have conduct problems evident by the age of 15. Persistent antisocial behavior, as well as a lack of regard for others in childhood and adolescence, is known as conduct disorder and is the precursor of ASPD. About 25–40% of youths with conduct disorder will be diagnosed with ASPD in adulthood.

Conduct disorder (CD) is a disorder diagnosed in childhood that parallels the characteristics found in ASPD. It is characterized by a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate norms are violated by the child. Children with the disorder often display impulsive and aggressive behavior, may be callous and deceitful, may repeatedly engage in petty crime (such as stealing or vandalism), or get into fights with other children and adults.

This behavior is typically persistent and may be difficult to deter with either threat or punishment. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common in this population, and children with the disorder may also engage in substance use. CD is distinct from oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in that children with ODD do not commit aggressive or antisocial acts against other people, animals, or property, though many children diagnosed with ODD are subsequently re-diagnosed with CD.

Two developmental courses for CD have been identified based on the age at which the symptoms become present. The first course is known as the &quot;childhood-onset type&quot; and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present before the age of 10. This course is often linked to a more persistent life course and more pervasive behaviors, and children in this group express greater levels of ADHD symptoms, neuropsychological deficits, more academic problems, increased family dysfunction, and higher likelihood of aggression and violence.

The second course is known as the &quot;adolescent-onset type&quot; and occurs when conduct disorder develops after the age of 10 years. Compared to the childhood-onset type, less impairment in various cognitive and emotional functions are present, and the adolescent-onset variety may remit by adulthood. In addition to this differentiation, the DSM-5 provides a specifier for a callous and unemotional interpersonal style, which reflects characteristics seen in psychopathy and are believed to be a childhood precursor to this disorder. Compared to the adolescent-onset subtype, the childhood-onset subtype tends to have a worse treatment outcome, especially if callous and unemotional traits are present.

==Diagnosis==
===DSM-5===
==== Section II ====
The main text of fifth edition of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-5) defines antisocial personality disorder as being characterized by at least three of the following traits:

* Failure to conform to social norms and laws, indicated by repeatedly engaging in illegal activities.
* Deceitfulness, indicated by continuously lying, using aliases, or conning others for personal gain and pleasure.
* Exhibiting impulsivity or failing to plan ahead.
* Irritability and aggressiveness, indicated by repeatedly getting into fights or physically assaulting others.
* Reckless behaviors that disregard the safety of others.
* Irresponsibility, indicated by repeatedly failing to consistently work or honor financial obligations.
* Lack of remorse after hurting or mistreating another person.

In order to be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder under the DSM-5, one must be at least 18 years old, show evidence of onset of conduct disorder before age 15, and antisocial behavior cannot be explained by schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

==== Section III (Alternative Model of Personality Disorders) ====
In response to criticisms of the extant (Section II/DSM-IV) criteria for personality disorders, including their discordance with current models in the scientific literature, high comorbidity rate, overuse of some categories, underuse of others, and overwhelming use of the personality disorder-not otherwise specified (PD-NOS) diagnosis, the DSM-5 Workgroup on personality disorders devised a dimensional model, wherein categoric personality diagnoses reflect extreme variations of normal personality traits.

In response to criticisms of the extant Section II/DSM-IV criteria for ASPD, namely its failure to capture the interpersonal and affective features of psychopathy, new criteria were proposed.

In addition to the new criteria, the individual must be at least 18 years old, the traits must cause dysfunction or distress, and should not be better explained by another mental disorder, the pathophysiological effects of a substance, or a person&#x27;s cultural or social background. Also included as a &quot;with psychopathic traits&quot; specifier modelled after the Fearless Dominance scale of the Psychopathic Personality Inventory, defined by low Anxiousness and Withdrawal and high Attention-Seeking. Researchers have also proposed the inclusion of Grandiosity and Restricted Affectivity to better capture psychopathy.

===Psychopathy===
Psychopathy is commonly defined as a personality construct characterized partly by antisocial behavior, a diminished capacity for empathy and remorse, and poor behavioral controls. Psychopathic traits are assessed using various measurement tools, including Canadian researcher Robert D. Hare&#x27;s Psychopathy Checklist, Revised (PCL-R). &quot;Psychopathy&quot; is not the official title of any diagnosis in the DSM or ICD; nor is it an official title used by any other major psychiatric organizations. The DSM and ICD, however, state that their antisocial diagnoses are at times referred to (or include what is referred to) as psychopathy or sociopathy.

American psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley&#x27;s work on psychopathy formed the basis of the diagnostic criteria for ASPD, and the DSM states ASPD is often referred to as psychopathy. However, critics argue ASPD is not synonymous with psychopathy as the diagnostic criteria are not the same, since criteria relating to personality traits are emphasized relatively less in the former. These differences exist in part because it was believed such traits were difficult to measure reliably and it was &quot;easier to agree on the behaviors that typify a disorder than on the reasons why they occur&quot;.

Although the diagnosis of ASPD covers two to three times as many prisoners as the diagnosis of psychopathy, Robert Hare believes the PCL-R is better able to predict future criminality, violence, and recidivism than a diagnosis of ASPD. He suggests there are differences between PCL-R-diagnosed psychopaths and non-psychopaths on &quot;processing and use of linguistic and emotional information&quot;, while such differences are potentially smaller between those diagnosed with ASPD and without. Additionally, Hare argued confusion regarding how to diagnose ASPD, confusion regarding the difference between ASPD and psychopathy, as well as the differing future prognoses regarding recidivism and treatability, may have serious consequences in settings such as court cases where psychopathy is often seen as aggravating the crime.

Nonetheless, psychopathy has been proposed as a specifier under an alternative model for ASPD. In the DSM&quot;-5&quot;, under &quot;Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders&quot;, ASPD with psychopathic features is described as characterized by &quot;a lack of anxiety or fear and by a bold interpersonal style that may mask maladaptive behaviors (e.g., fraudulence)&quot;. Low levels of withdrawal and high levels of attention-seeking combined with low anxiety are associated with &quot;social potency&quot; and &quot;stress immunity&quot; in psychopathy. Under the specifier, affective and interpersonal characteristics are comparatively emphasized over behavioral components. Research suggests that, even without the &quot;with psychopathic traits&quot; specifier, these Section III criteria accurately capture the affective-interpersonal features of psychopathy, though the specifier increases coverage of the Interpersonal and Lifestyle facets of the PCL-R.

=== Millon&#x27;s subtypes ===
Theodore Millon suggested 5 subtypes of ASPD. However, these constructs are not recognized in the DSM or ICD.
Elsewhere, Millon differentiates ten subtypes (partially overlapping with the above) – covetous, risk-taking, malevolent, tyrannical, malignant, disingenuous, explosive, and abrasive – but specifically stresses that &quot;the number 10 is by no means special ... Taxonomies may be put forward at levels that are more coarse or more fine-grained.&quot;

==Treatment==

ASPD is considered to be among the most difficult personality disorders to treat. Rendering an effective treatment for ASPD is further complicated due to the inability to look at comparative studies between psychopathy and ASPD due to differing diagnostic criteria, differences in defining and measuring outcomes and a focus on treating incarcerated patients rather than those in the community. Because of their very low or absent capacity for remorse, individuals with ASPD often lack sufficient motivation and fail to see the costs associated with antisocial acts. They may only simulate remorse rather than truly commit to change: they can be charming and dishonest, and may manipulate staff and fellow patients during treatment. Studies have shown that outpatient therapy is not likely to be successful, but the extent to which persons with ASPD are entirely unresponsive to treatment may have been exaggerated.

Most treatment done is for those in the criminal justice system to whom the treatment regimes are given as part of their imprisonment. Those with ASPD may stay in treatment only as required by an external source, such as parole conditions. Residential programs that provide a carefully controlled environment of structure and supervision along with peer confrontation have been recommended. There has been some research on the treatment of ASPD that indicated positive results for therapeutic interventions.

Psychotherapy, also known as &quot;talk&quot; therapy, has been found to help treat patients with ASPD. Schema therapy is also being investigated as a treatment for ASPD. A review by Charles M. Borduin features the strong influence of multisystemic therapy (MST) that could potentially improve this issue. However, this treatment requires complete cooperation and participation of all family members. Some studies have found that the presence of ASPD does not significantly interfere with treatment for other disorders, such as substance use, although others have reported contradictory findings.

Therapists working with individuals with ASPD may have considerable negative feelings toward patients with extensive histories of aggressive, exploitative, and abusive behaviors. Rather than attempt to develop a sense of conscience in these individuals, which is extremely difficult considering the nature of the disorder, therapeutic techniques are focused on rational and utilitarian arguments against repeating past mistakes. These approaches would focus on the tangible, material value of prosocial behavior and abstaining from antisocial behavior. However, the impulsive and aggressive nature of those with this disorder may limit the effectiveness of this form of therapy.

The use of medications in treating antisocial personality disorder is still poorly explored, and no medications have been approved by the FDA to specifically treat ASPD. A 2020 Cochrane review of studies that explored the use of pharmaceuticals in ASPD patients, of which eight studies met the selection criteria for review, concluded that the current body of evidence was inconclusive for recommendations concerning the use of pharmaceuticals in treating the various issues of ASPD. Nonetheless, psychiatric medications such as antipsychotics, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers can be used to control symptoms such as aggression and impulsivity, as well as treat disorders that may co-occur with ASPD for which medications are indicated.

==Prognosis==
Boys are almost twice as likely to meet all of the diagnostic criteria for ASPD than girls and they will often start showing symptoms of the disorder much earlier in life. Children that do not show symptoms of the disease through age 15 will almost never develop ASPD later in life. If adults exhibit milder symptoms of ASPD, it is likely that they never met the criteria for the disorder in their childhood and were consequently never diagnosed. Overall, symptoms of ASPD tend to peak in late teens and early twenties, but can often reduce or improve through age 40.

ASPD is ultimately a lifelong disorder that has chronic consequences, though some of these can be moderated over time. There may be a high variability of the long-term outlook of antisocial personality disorder. The treatment of this disorder can be successful, but it entails unique difficulties. It is unlikely to see rapid change especially when the condition is severe. In fact, past studies revealed that remission rates were small, with 27-31% of patients with ASPD seeing an improvement &quot;with the most violent and dangerous features remitting&quot;. As a result of the characteristics of ASPD (e.g., displaying charm in effort of personal gain, manipulation), patients seeking treatment (mandated or otherwise) may appear to be &quot;cured&quot; in order to get out of treatment. According to definitions found in the &quot;DSM-5&quot;, people with ASPD can be deceitful and intimidating in their relationships. When they are caught doing something wrong, they often appear to be unaffected and unemotional about the consequences. Over time, continual behavior that lacks empathy and concern may lead to someone with ASPD taking advantage of the kindness of others, including their therapist.

Without proper treatment, individuals with ASPD could lead a life that brings about harm to themselves or others. This can be detrimental to their families and careers. Those with ASPD lack interpersonal skills (e.g., lack of remorse, lack of empathy, lack of emotional-processing skills). As a result of the inability to create and maintain healthy relationships due to the lack of interpersonal skills, individuals with ASPD may find themselves in predicaments such as divorce, unemployment, homelessness and even premature death by suicide. They also see higher rates of committed crime, reaching peaks in their late teens and often committing higher-severity crimes in their younger ages of diagnoses. Comorbidity of other mental illnesses such as depression or substance use disorder is prevalent among patients with ASPD. People with ASPD are also more likely to commit homicides and other crimes. Those who are imprisoned longer often see higher rates of improvement with symptoms of ASPD than others who have been imprisoned for a shorter amount of time.

According to one study, aggressive tendencies show in about 72% of all male patients diagnosed with ASPD. About 29% of the men studied with ASPD also showed a prevalence of pre-meditated aggression. Based on the evidence in the study, the researchers concluded that aggression in patients with ASPD is mostly impulsive, though there are some long-term evidences of pre-meditated aggressions. It often occurs that those with higher psychopathic traits will exhibit the pre-meditated aggressions to those around them. Over the course of a patient&#x27;s life with ASPD, he or she can exhibit this aggressive behavior and harm those close to him or her.

Additionally, many people (especially adults) who have been diagnosed with ASPD become burdens to their close relatives, peers, and caretakers. Harvard Medical School recommends that time and resources be spent treating victims who have been affected by someone with ASPD, because the patient with ASPD may not respond to the administered therapies. In fact, a patient with ASPD may only accept treatment when ordered by a court, which will make their course of treatment difficult and severe. Because of the challenges in treatment, the patient&#x27;s family and close friends must take an active role in decisions about therapies that are offered to the patient. Ultimately, there must be a group effort to aid the long-term effects of the disorder.

==Epidemiology==
The estimated lifetime prevalence of ASPD amongst the general population falls within 1% to 4%, skewed towards 6% men and 2% women. The prevalence of ASPD is even higher in selected populations, like prisons, where there is a preponderance of violent offenders. It has been found that the prevalence of ASPD among prisoners is just under 50%. According to one study (n=23000), the prevalence of ASPD in prisoners is 47% in men and 21% in women. Thus, with only 27-31% of patients with ASPD seeing an improvement in symptoms over time, statistically around one third (33%) of male prisoners will not see any improvement in their symptoms, and are thus essentially prognostically hopeless. The corresponding percentage of female prisoners with statistically no chance of improvement in symptoms is around 15% or roughly one in six. Similarly, the prevalence of ASPD is higher among patients in alcohol or other drug (AOD) use treatment programs than in the general population, suggesting a link between ASPD and AOD use and dependence. As part of the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study, men with ASPD were found to be three to five times more likely to excessively use alcohol and illicit substances than those men without ASPD. There was found to be increased severity of this substance use in women with ASPD. In a study conducted with both men and women with ASPD, women were more likely to misuse substances compared to their male counterparts.

Homelessness is also common amongst people with ASPD. A study on 31 youths of San Francisco and 56 youths in Chicago found that 84% and 48% of the homeless met the diagnostic criteria for ASPD respectively. Another study on the homeless found that 25% of participants had ASPD.

Individuals with ASPD are at an elevated risk for suicide. Some studies suggest this increase in suicidality is in part due to the association between suicide and symptoms or trends within ASPD, such as criminality and substance use. Children of people with ASPD are also at risk. Some research suggests that negative or traumatic experiences in childhood, perhaps as a result of the choices a parent with ASPD might make, can be a predictor of delinquency later on in the child&#x27;s life. Additionally, with variability between situations, children of a parent with ASPD may face consequences of delinquency if they are raised in an environment in which crime and violence is common. Suicide is a leading cause of death among youth who display antisocial behavior, especially when mixed with delinquency. Incarceration, which could come as a consequence of actions from a person with ASPD, is a predictor for suicide ideation in youth.

==History==
The first version of the DSM in 1952 listed &quot;sociopathic personality disturbance&quot;. This category was for individuals who were considered &quot;...ill primarily in terms of society and of conformity with the prevailing milieu, and not only in terms of personal discomfort and relations with other individuals.&quot; There were four subtypes, referred to as &quot;reactions&quot;: antisocial, dyssocial, sexual, and addiction. The antisocial reaction was said to include people who were &quot;always in trouble&quot; and not learning from it, maintaining &quot;no loyalties&quot;, frequently callous and lacking responsibility, with an ability to &quot;rationalize&quot; their behavior. The category was described as more specific and limited than the existing concepts of &quot;constitutional psychopathic state&quot; or &quot;psychopathic personality&quot; which had a very broad meaning; the narrower definition was in line with criteria advanced by Hervey M. Cleckley from 1941, while the term sociopathic had been advanced by George Partridge in 1928 when studying the early environmental influence on psychopaths. Partridge discovered the correlation between antisocial psychopathic disorder and parental rejection experienced in early childhood.

The DSM-II in 1968 rearranged the categories and &quot;antisocial personality&quot; was now listed as one of ten personality disorders but still described similarly, to be applied to individuals who are: &quot;basically unsocialized&quot;, in repeated conflicts with society, incapable of significant loyalty, selfish, irresponsible, unable to feel guilt or learn from prior experiences, and who tend to blame others and rationalize. The manual preface contains &quot;special instructions&quot; including &quot;&quot;Antisocial personality&quot; should always be specified as mild, moderate, or severe.&quot; The DSM-II warned that a history of legal or social offenses was not by itself enough to justify the diagnosis, and that a &quot;group delinquent reaction&quot; of childhood or adolescence or &quot;social maladjustment without manifest psychiatric disorder&quot; should be ruled out first. The dyssocial personality type was relegated in the DSM-II to &quot;dyssocial behavior&quot; for individuals who are predatory and follow more or less criminal pursuits, such as racketeers, dishonest gamblers, prostitutes, and dope peddlers (DSM-I classified this condition as &quot;sociopathic personality disorder, dyssocial type&quot;). It would later resurface as the name of a diagnosis in the ICD manual produced by the WHO, later spelled &quot;dissocial personality disorder&quot; and considered approximately equivalent to the ASPD diagnosis.

The DSM-III in 1980 included the full term &quot;antisocial personality disorder&quot; and, as with other disorders, there was now a full checklist of symptoms focused on observable behaviors to enhance consistency in diagnosis between different psychiatrists (&#x27;inter-rater reliability&#x27;). The ASPD symptom list was based on the Research Diagnostic Criteria developed from the so-called Feighner Criteria from 1972, and in turn largely credited to influential research by sociologist Lee Robins published in 1966 as &quot;Deviant Children Grown Up&quot;. However, Robins has previously clarified that while the new criteria of prior childhood conduct problems came from her work, she and co-researcher psychiatrist Patricia O&#x27;Neal got the diagnostic criteria they used from Lee&#x27;s husband the psychiatrist Eli Robins, one of the authors of the Feighner criteria who had been using them as part of diagnostic interviews.

The DSM-IV maintained the trend for behavioral antisocial symptoms while noting, &quot;This pattern has also been referred to as psychopathy, sociopathy, or dyssocial personality disorder&quot; and re-including in the &#x27;Associated Features&#x27; text summary some of the underlying personality traits from the older diagnoses. The DSM-5 has the same diagnosis of &quot;antisocial personality disorder&quot;. &quot;The Pocket Guide to the DSM-5 Diagnostic Exam&quot; suggests that a person with ASPD may present &quot;with psychopathic features&quot; if he or she exhibits &quot;a lack of anxiety or fear and a bold, efficacious interpersonal style&quot;.

<text>The Society of the Friends of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen ( ), mainly known as Cordeliers Club ( ), was a populist political club during the French Revolution from 1790 to 1794, when the Reign of Terror ended and the Thermidorian Reaction began.

The club campaigned for universal male suffrage and direct democracy, including the referendum. It energetically served as a watchdog looking for signs of abuse of power by the men in power. By 1793, it was challenging the centralization of power by Robespierre and his Committee of Public Safety. They responded by arresting the leadership, charging them with conspiring to overthrow the Convention. The leaders were guillotined, and the club disappeared.

== History ==

The club had its origins in the Cordeliers district, a famously radical area of Paris called, by Camille Desmoulins, &quot;the only sanctuary where liberty has not been violated&quot;. Under the leadership of Georges Danton, this district had played a significant role in the Storming of the Bastille and was home to several notable figures of the Revolution, including Danton himself, Desmoulins and Jean-Paul Marat—on whose behalf the district placed itself in a state of civil rebellion, when in January 1790 it refused to allow the execution of a warrant for his arrest that had been issued by the Châtelet.

Having issued in November 1789 a declaration affirming its intent to &quot;oppose, as much as we are able, all that the representatives of the Commune may undertake that is harmful to the general rights of our constituents&quot;, the Cordeliers district remained in conflict with the Parisian government throughout the winter and spring of 1790. In May and June 1790, the previous division of Paris into 60 districts was by decree of the National Assembly replaced by the creation of 48 sections. This restructuring abolished the Cordeliers district.

Anticipating this dissolution, the leaders of the Cordeliers district founded in April 1790 the &quot;Société des Amis des droits de l’homme et du citoyen&quot;, a popular society which would serve as an alternative means of pursuing the goals and interests of the district. This society held its meetings in the Cordeliers Convent and quickly became known as the &quot;Club des Cordeliers&quot;. It took as its motto the phrase &quot;Liberté, égalité, fraternité&quot;, and because its aim was to keep an eye on the government its emblem was an open eye.

The membership fees of this society were fixed low and thus affordable to a more diverse range of citizens than those of many other political clubs at the time, including the Jacobin Club. There were no other restrictions on membership. The Cordeliers presented themselves as exceptionally populist and they prided themselves on counting working men and women among their members. A contemporary account describes one meeting: About three hundred persons of both sexes filled the place; their dress was so unkempt and so filthy that one would have taken them for a gathering of beggars. The Declaration of the Rights of Man was stuck on the wall, crowned by crossed daggers. Plaster busts of Brutus and William Tell were placed on each side, as if expressly to guard the Declaration. Facing, behind the tribune, as supporters, there appeared busts of Mirabeau and Helvétius, with Rousseau in the middle.

However, the preponderance of Cordeliers were members of the bourgeoisie and its leadership was largely drawn from the educated middle classes.

From 1791 the Cordeliers met in a hall in the Rue Dauphine. On 21 June of that year, following an attempt by the royal family to flee Paris, the Cordeliers moved to draft a petition which offered the National Assembly a choice between the immediate deposition of Louis XVI or a national referendum on the future of the monarchy. The Cordeliers actively moved against the majority interests in this case. Large demonstrations in support of this and similar petitions led to civil unrest, and culminated in the Champ de Mars massacre on 17 July. The National Guard, led by the Marquis de Lafayette, fired on the protestors, resulting in the deaths of at least dozen of them. Subsequent action taken against the Cordeliers included the closing of the Cordeliers Convent to them and the issuing of arrest warrants for Danton and Desmoulins. Despite these measures, the society remained a highly influential force in Parisian politics.

The Cordeliers participated significantly in the planning and execution of the 10 August 1792 insurrection. Danton, at this time perhaps the most powerful figure within the Cordeliers Club, acted—in Hilaire Belloc&#x27;s words—as &quot;the organizer and chief of the insurrection&quot; and was appointed Minister of Justice in the government that resulted, with Desmoulins and Fabre d&#x27;Églantine—both prominent members of the Cordeliers Club—as his secretaries.

Subsequent to this insurrection and to the September Massacres that followed closely on its heels, the Cordeliers Club became increasingly the province of ultra-revolutionary factions, particularly the Hébertists, who advocated extreme measures to intensify the Terror.

In December 1793, Desmoulins began publishing a journal entitled &quot;Le Vieux Cordelier&quot; or &quot;The Old Cordelier&quot;, which attempted to reclaim the title of the society from those who had associated it with extremism. In the seven numbers of the journal, Desmoulins attacked the Hébertists and called for an end to the Terror, comparing revolutionary Paris to Rome under the tyrants. The Hébertists were arrested and, on 24 March 1794, executed, but the less extreme Desmoulins, Danton and the &quot;Old Cordeliers&quot; of the Dantonist faction quickly followed them to the guillotine. Their execution took place on April 5. The Cordeliers Club, deprived of its most important members, initially played no role in the further course of the revolution. After the Jacobin Club closed in November 1794, its most vehement representatives (so-called &quot;crêtois&quot;) joined the Cordeliers. In response, the Thermidorians arranged for its final closure on the 20th of Pluviose III (February 20, 1795).

<text>General Lucian King Truscott Jr. (9 January 1895 – 12 September 1965) was a highly decorated senior United States Army officer, who saw distinguished active service during World War II. Between 1943–1945, he successively commanded the 3rd Infantry Division, VI Corps, Fifteenth Army and Fifth Army, serving mainly in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) during his wartime service. He and Alexander Patch were the only U.S. Army officers to command a division, a corps, and a field army in combat during the war.

==Early life and family==
Truscott was born in Chatfield, Texas on 6 January 1895, a son of Lucian King Truscott (1861–1922) and Maria Temple (Tully) Truscott (1866–1938). Raised primarily in Oklahoma, he attended grade school and a year of high school in the hamlet of Stella, near Norman. At age 16, he claimed to be 18 and a high school graduate to qualify for teacher training, attended the summer term of the state normal school in Norman, and received his teaching certification. He taught school and worked as a school principal before he decided to join the United States Army in 1917. Enlisting during the American entry into World War I, Truscott applied for officer training, falsely claiming to be a high school graduate who had completed the equivalent of a year of college. After completing the officer training camp at Fort Logan H. Roots, in October 1917 he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Cavalry Branch of the U.S. Army. During the war, he remained in the United States to patrol the border with Mexico, and served with the 17th Cavalry Regiment at Camp Harry J. Jones, Douglas, Arizona.

On 27 March 1919, Truscott married Sarah &quot;Chick&quot; Nicholas Randolph (1896–1974), a descendant of Thomas Jefferson Randolph and Thomas Nelson Jr. They were the parents of three children – Mary Randolph Truscott (1920–1991), Lucian King (1921–2000), and James Joseph (b. 1930–2020).

==Military career==
Truscott served in various cavalry and staff assignments between the wars, including completion of the Cavalry Officers Course, followed by assignment as a Cavalry School instructor. He also graduated from the United States Army Command and General Staff College, followed by assignment to its faculty. In the early 1930s, he commanded E Troop, 3rd Cavalry Regiment, which was stationed at Fort Myer, Virginia. On 18 August 1940 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.

===World War II===
In March 1941, Truscott was appointed to the staff of Ninth Corps Area, at Fort Lewis, Washington. It was while he was in this assignment where he came into close contact with Dwight D. Eisenhower, then a colonel serving in the 3rd Infantry Division (then stationed at Fort Lewis) as a battalion commander.

In 1942, Truscott, now a temporary colonel (having been promoted on 24 December 1941), was instrumental in developing an American commando unit patterned after the British Commandos. The American unit was activated by Truscott (newly promoted to the rank of brigadier general on 19 June 1942) as the 1st Ranger Battalion, and placed under the command of Major William Orlando Darby.

In May 1942, Truscott was assigned to the Allied Combined Staff under Lord Louis Mountbatten and in August, he was the primary U.S. observer on the Dieppe Raid. The raid was primarily a Canadian operation, consisting of elements of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, with two British Commandos attached along with a 50-man detachment from the 1st Ranger Battalion. The Rangers were assigned to No. 3 Commando, No. 4 Commando, and 6 Rangers were spread out among the Canadian regiments. This was considered the first action by American troops against German forces in World War II.

On 8 November 1942, now a major general, Truscott led the 9,000 men of the 60th Infantry Regiment (part of the 9th Infantry Division) and 66th Armored Regiment (part of the 2nd Armored Division) in the landings at Mehdia and Port Lyautey in Morocco, part of Operation Torch under Major General George S. Patton.

====Division commander====
Truscott took command of the 3rd Infantry Division in March 1943, and oversaw preparations for the Allied invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky. He was known as a very tough trainer, bringing the 3rd Infantry Division up to a very high standard. At the age of 48, he was one of the youngest division commanders in the U.S. Army at the time.

He led the division in the assault on Sicily in July 1943, coming under the command of the Seventh U.S. Army, commanded by Patton, now a lieutenant general. Here his training paid off when the division covered great distances in the mountainous terrain at high speed. The famous &#x27;Truscott Trot&#x27; was a marching pace of five miles per hour over the first mile, thereafter four miles per hour, much faster than the usual standard of 2.5 miles per hour. The 3rd Infantry Division was considered to be the best-trained, best-led division in the Seventh Army and Truscott himself was highly rated by Patton, who wrote in an officer efficiency report, stating that, &quot;I know of no other major general who has more efficiently performed as a Division Commander.&quot; He rated Truscott 5th out of 155 general officers.

After a brief rest to absorb replacements the division, in mid-September, nine days after the initial Allied landings at Salerno, Italy, came ashore on the Italian mainland, where it fought its way up the Italian peninsula, under the command of the VI Corps, commanded by Major General John P. Lucas. The VI Corps was part of Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark&#x27;s United States Fifth Army. After crossing the Volturno Line in October and fighting in severe winter weather around the Gustav Line, which saw heavy casualties sustained, the division was pulled out of the line for rest and relaxation.

In January 1944, the division assaulted Anzio as part of the U.S. VI Corps, which also included the British 1st Infantry Division, along with two British Commandos and three battalions of U.S. Army Rangers, Combat Command B of the 1st Armored Division and the 504th Parachute Regimental Combat Team. The operation, the brainchild of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, was intended to outflank, and potentially force the Germans to withdraw from their Winter Line defenses, which had considerably slowed Allied progress in Italy.

====Corps commander====
Lucas, the corps commander, initially decided not to push inland, as Allied commanders had intended, and Truscott&#x27;s 3rd Division was soon engaged in bitter fighting and, again, suffering heavy losses as the Germans launched numerous counterattacks to drive the Allies into the sea. With Clark, the Fifth Army commander, and General Sir Harold R. L. G. Alexander, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the Allied Armies in Italy (AAI), growing increasingly worried about the situation, Truscott was appointed as Lucas&#x27;s deputy commander and, after Lucas was relieved on 17 February, Truscott assumed command. Truscott was succeeded in command of the 3rd Infantry Division by Major General John &quot;Iron Mike&quot; O&#x27;Daniel, previously the Assistant Division Commander (ADC). At the age of 49, Truscott was the second youngest corps commander in the U.S. Army at the time, behind only Major General J. Lawton Collins, then commanding VII Corps in England. Clark, writing in his memoirs after the war, claimed that he &quot;selected Truscott to become the new VI Corps commander because of all the division commanders available to me in the Anzio bridgehead who were familiar with the situation he was the most outstanding. A quiet, competent, and courageous officer with great battle experience through North Africa, Sicily, and Italy, he inspired confidence in all with whom he came in contact.&quot;

Following Anzio, Truscott continued to command VI Corps through the fighting up the Italian boot, helping in the final Battle of Monte Cassino and the subsequent capture of Rome, just two days before the Normandy landings. However, his command was then withdrawn from the line to prepare for Operation Dragoon, the amphibious assault on southern France.

On 15 August 1944, VI Corps landed in southern France and initially faced relatively little opposition. The rapid retreat of the German Nineteenth Army resulted in swift gains for the Allied forces. The invasion plan was initially for US forces to conduct the initial landing, and Free French forces to conduct the breakout. This was changed to exploit the withdrawal of the German 19th Army, and US VI Corps began a pursuit. This resulted in cutting off the escape of the enemy, and their total destruction or capture. The &quot;Dragoon&quot; force met up with southern thrusts from Operation Overlord in mid-September, near Dijon.

A planned benefit of &quot;Dragoon&quot; was the usefulness of the port of Marseille. The rapid Allied advance after Operation Cobra and &quot;Dragoon&quot; slowed almost to a halt in September 1944 due to a critical lack of supplies, as thousands of tons of supplies were shunted to northwest France to compensate for the inadequacies of port facilities and land transport in northern Europe. Marseille and the southern French railways were brought back into service despite heavy damage to the port of Marseille and its railroad trunk lines. They became a significant supply route for the Allied advance into Germany, providing about a third of the Allied needs.

====Army commander====
On 2 September 1944, Truscott was promoted to the three-star rank of lieutenant general and in October he was appointed commander of the newly formed Fifteenth Army, which was largely an administrative and training command.

Truscott&#x27;s next command came in December 1944. He was promoted to command of the U.S. Fifth Army in Italy when its commander Lieutenant General Mark Clark was made commander of the Allied 15th Army Group, formerly the Allied Armies in Italy (AAI). Truscott led the Fifth Army through the hard winter of 1944–1945, where many of its formations were in exposed positions in the mountains of Italy. He then led the army through the Allied Spring 1945 offensive in Italy culminating in the final destruction of the German forces in Italy.

==Post-war era==
Truscott took over command of the Third Army from General George S. Patton on 8 October 1945, and led it until April 1946. This command included the Eastern Military District of the U.S. occupation zone of Germany, which consisted primarily of the state of Bavaria. When the Seventh Army was deactivated in March 1946, Truscott&#x27;s Third Army took over the Western Military District (the U.S.-occupied parts of Baden, Württemberg and Hesse-Darmstadt). Truscott was reassigned in April 1946 and retired from the army on September 30, 1947.

Will Lang Jr. from &quot;Life&quot; wrote a biography on Truscott that appeared in the October 2, 1944, issue of that magazine.

After leaving the United States Army, Truscott began work on his book &quot;Command Missions&quot;, which was published in 1954 (), and &quot;The Twilight of the U.S. Cavalry&quot; (). The latter book was published after his death by his son, Lucian III, in 1989. In 1954, Congress passed Public Law 83-508, which promoted several World War II senior officers who had exercised responsibilities greater than their rank; as a numbered army commander, Truscott carried out the duties of a four-star general, and the 1954 law promoted him to general on the retired list.

Truscott helped evaluate officers as a member of the War Department Screening Board. Then in 1948–1949, he spent a year as the Chairman of the Army Advisory Board for Amphibious Operations, at Fort Monroe, Virginia. It was between meetings of this board that he began assembling the material for his two books.

==Central Intelligence Agency==
In 1951, Walter Bedell Smith, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), appointed Truscott as &quot;Special Consultant to the United States Commissioner&quot; in Frankfurt, Germany. However, this was simply a cover for his real assignment as senior CIA representative in Germany. Truscott had been placed in charge of cloak-and-dagger operations in a vital part of Europe. This only came to light after declassification of a secret memorandum in 1994.

In 1953, President Eisenhower approved CIA Director Allen Dulles&#x27; recommendation that Truscott be appointed the CIA&#x27;s Deputy Director for Coordination. This appointment meant that Truscott was now controlling the agency&#x27;s rapidly expanding network of agents worldwide. His responsibilities included facilitating the overthrow of governments in Iran and Guatemala. Truscott was involved in planning Operation PBSuccess, the CIA mission to overthrow Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz. According to Harry Jeffers&#x27; biography, Truscott was instrumental in convincing Eisenhower to support PBSuccess with air power. However, another biography by William Heefner suggests that specifics of Truscott&#x27;s involvement cannot be substantiated.

Truscott left the CIA in 1958. He wrote nothing about his service in the CIA in &quot;Command Missions&quot;, and there is nothing about his CIA activities in his papers at the George C. Marshall Library.

==Death and legacy==
Truscott died on 12 September 1965, in Alexandria, Virginia and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia. On 29 April 1966, Truscott Hall, a bachelor officers&#x27; quarters at the United States Army War College, was named after him. On 17 August 1974, Sarah Truscott, his wife, died and was buried next to him at Arlington National Cemetery.

In 2012, Truscott was honored at his birthplace of Chatfield.

Novelist and journalist Lucian Truscott IV is his grandson.

==Personality==
Truscott had a very gravelly voice, said to be the result of an accidental ingestion of acid in childhood. He was superstitious about his clothing, and usually wore a leather jacket, &quot;pink&quot; pants and lucky boots in combat. He also wore a white scarf as a trademark, first during the Sicilian campaign.

Truscott once said to his son, &quot;Let me tell you something, and don&#x27;t ever forget it. You play games to win, not lose. And you fight wars to win. That&#x27;s spelled W-I-N! And every good player in a game and every good commander in a war…has to have some son of a bitch in him. If he doesn&#x27;t, he isn&#x27;t a good player or commander...It&#x27;s as simple as that. No son of a bitch, no commander.&quot;

Truscott was respected by his subordinates. A medical officer in the Seventh Army related stories he had heard from the men who served under Truscott. Unlike some commanders, Truscott was not noted for self-aggrandisement, nor did he suffer such from his superiors. Others noted he was humbled by the sacrifices those under him had made. Bill Mauldin described the time Truscott gave the address on Memorial Day, 31 May 1945, in the military cemetery at Nettuno, outside Anzio: &quot;He turned his back on the assembled windbags and sparklers and talked to the crosses in the cemetery, quietly, apologizing, and then walked away without looking around.&quot;

==Key assignments==
*3rd Infantry Division – 7 March 1943 to 16 February 1944
*VI Corps – 28 February 1944 to 14 October 1944
*Fifteenth United States Army – 15 October 1944 to 15 December 1944
*Fifth United States Army – 16 December 1944 to 2 October 1945
*Third United States Army – October 1945 to April 1946

==In popular culture==
Truscott was portrayed by actor John Doucette in the 1970 film &quot;Patton&quot;. In one scene, as commander of the 3rd Infantry Division during the Allied invasion of Sicily, Truscott is shown arguing vehemently with General Patton over the latter&#x27;s orders pertaining to his division.

Truscott was portrayed by Willis Bouchey in The Young Invaders and Charles H. Gray in .

==Decorations and medals==
Truscott received the United States Army&#x27;s second-highest decoration, the Distinguished Service Cross, for valor in action in Sicily on 11 July 1943, the second day of the invasion. Truscott&#x27;s other decorations include the Army Distinguished Service Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit and the Purple Heart.

<text>Hugo Gerhard Simberg (24 June 1873 – 12 July 1917) was a Finnish symbolist painter and graphic artist.

==Life and career==
Simberg was born on 24 June 1873, at Hamina (), Finland, the son of Colonel Nicolai Simberg and Ebba Matilda Simberg (née Widenius). In 1891, at the age of 18, he enrolled at the Drawing School of the Viipuri Friends of Art, and he also studied at the Drawing School of the Finnish Art Society from 1893 to 1895. Then, in 1895, he decided to become the private pupil of Akseli Gallen-Kallela at his wilderness studio Kalela in Ruovesi. He studied under Gallen-Kallela for three periods between 1895 and 1897.

In 1896, Simberg went to London, and in 1897 to Paris and Italy. During these years he exhibited several works at the Finnish Artists&#x27; autumn exhibitions, including &quot;Autumn, Frost&quot;, &quot;The Devil Playing&quot; and &quot;Aunt Alexandra&quot; (1898), which were well received. Critical success led to his being made a member of the Finnish Art Association and to his being appointed to teach at the Drawing School of the Viipuri Friends of Art.

In 1904, he was commissioned to decorate the interior of St John&#x27;s church in Tampere (now Tampere Cathedral), a project which he carried out with Magnus Enckell between 1904 and 1906. At the turn of the year 1907-08 he made a short visit to the United States. He also designed the UPM-Kymmene logo, the Griffon (1899).

From around 1907 to 1913, he taught at the Drawing School of the Finnish Art Association at Ateneum. In 1910, he married Anni Bremer. They had two children, Tom and Uhra-Beata, the latter of whom became a rya artist.

He died in Ähtäri on 12 July 1917. His biographer, Helena Ruuska, suspects that he battled an unknown disease, possibly syphilis, for a long time.

==Style==

Simberg&#x27;s paintings emphasize mainly macabre and supernatural topics. Simberg&#x27;s most famous painting is &quot;The Wounded Angel&quot;. Its titular character appears in the shape of a winged angel with a bandaged head, borne on a stretcher by two somberly dressed boys, one of whom looks toward the viewer with a serious expression. The painting is the best known of the artist&#x27;s works and is especially famous in Finland. The Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish released in 2007 a music video influenced by this painting, &quot;Amaranth&quot;.

Another famous painting is &quot;The Garden of Death&quot;, which, like many of Simberg&#x27;s paintings, depicts a gloomy, otherworldly scene. The central figures are reminiscent of the classic black-clad Grim Reaper, but paradoxically are tending to gardens, traditionally symbols of birth or renewal.

<text>A street is a public thoroughfare in a built environment. It is a public parcel of land adjoining buildings in an urban or suburban context, on which people may freely assemble, interact, and move about. A street can be as simple as a level patch of dirt, but is more often paved with a hard, durable surface such as tarmac, concrete, cobblestone or brick. Portions may also be smoothed with asphalt, embedded with rails, or otherwise prepared to accommodate non-pedestrian traffic.

Originally, the word &quot;street&quot; simply meant a paved road (). The word &quot;street&quot; is still sometimes used informally as a synonym for &quot;road&quot;, for example in connection with the ancient Watling Street, but city residents and urban planners draw a significant modern distinction: a road&#x27;s main function is transportation, while streets facilitate public interaction. Examples of streets include pedestrian streets, alleys, and city-centre streets too crowded for road vehicles to pass. Conversely, highways and motorways are types of roads, but few would refer to them as streets.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;street&quot; has its origins in the Latin &quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;paved road&quot; – an abbreviation from &quot; &quot;); it is thus related to &quot;stratum&quot; and &quot;stratification&quot;. The first recorded use of word &quot;stratæ&quot; referring to the road has been made by Eutropius. Ancient Greek &quot;&quot; means army: Greeks originally built roads to move their armies. Old English applied the word to Roman roads in Britain such as Ermine Street, Watling Street, etc. Later it acquired a dialectical meaning of &quot;straggling village&quot;, which were often laid out on the verges of Roman roads and these settlements often became named Stretton. In the Middle Ages, a &quot;road&quot; was a way people travelled, with &quot;street&quot; applied specifically to paved ways.

==History==
Streets have their roots to antiquity in ancient roads or trade routes, designed for practical purposes like transportation, commerce or defense. In many cities, streets may have originated as paths through wilderness or were shaped by natural features like rivers, hills or the coastline.

As towns and cities grew from the first civilizations, streets were planned to facilitate urban development. Early street names often echoed local landmarks, businesses or key figures. Some streets were named after royalty, national heroes or historical events. Over time when settlements increased, streets were modified to support growing populations.

During the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries, industrialization dramatically changed many cities. Streets became centers for commerce, trade and industrial activity, leading to the construction of factories, warehouses and transportation hubs. It resulted in overcrowding, pollution and changes in the architecture of surrounding buildings.

As cities grew, so did the demographics and the functions of certain streets. In some cases, a street may have become associated with particular communities, industries or events. For example, certain streets may have become known for their vibrant cultural or artistic scenes or for being focal points during political protests or social movements.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, streets probably underwent major transformations with the advent of automobiles, public transport systems and urban planning policies. Many streets have been pedestrianized, revitalized with new businesses, or preserved for historical purposes. Streets that once served as industrial centers might now house cafes, boutiques and galleries.

Subsequently, streets have been shaped by urban planning and gentrification. Older neighborhoods may have been revitalized or developed into trendy areas, often displacing long-time residents. Street names and the businesses along them may also change as a result of economic shifts and demographic changes.

==Role in the built environment==

The street is a public easement, one of the few shared between all sorts of people. As a component of the built environment as ancient as human habitation, the street sustains a range of activities vital to civilization. Its roles are as numerous and diverse as its ever-changing cast of characters.

Streets can be loosely categorized as main streets and side streets. Main streets are usually broad with a relatively high level of activity. Commerce and public interaction are more visible on main streets, and vehicles may use them for longer-distance travel. Side streets are quieter, often residential in use and character, and may be used for vehicular parking.

===Circulation===

Circulation, or less broadly, transportation, is perhaps a street&#x27;s most visible use, and certainly among the most important. The unrestricted movement of people and goods within a city is essential to its commerce and vitality, and streets provide the physical space for this activity.

In the interest of order and efficiency, an effort may be made to segregate different types of traffic. This is usually done by carving a road through the middle for motorists, reserving pavements on either side for pedestrians; other arrangements allow for streetcars, trolleys, and even wastewater and rainfall runoff ditches (common in Japan and India). In the mid-20th century, as the automobile threatened to overwhelm city streets with pollution and ghastly accidents, many urban theorists came to see this segregation as not only helpful but necessary in order to maintain mobility.

Le Corbusier, for one, perceived an ever-stricter segregation of traffic as an essential affirmation of social order—a desirable, and ultimately inevitable, expression of modernity. To this end, proposals were advanced to build &quot;vertical streets&quot; where road vehicles, pedestrians, and trains would each occupy their own levels. Such an arrangement, it was said, would allow for even denser development in the future.

These plans were never implemented comprehensively, a fact which today&#x27;s urban theorists regard as fortunate for vitality and diversity. Rather, vertical segregation is applied on a piecemeal basis, as in sewers, utility poles, depressed highways, elevated railways, common utility ducts, the extensive complex of underground malls surrounding Tokyo Station and the Ōtemachi subway station, the elevated pedestrian skyway networks of Minneapolis and Calgary, the underground cities of Atlanta and Montreal, and the multilevel streets in Chicago.

Transportation is often misunderstood to be the defining characteristic, or even the sole purpose, of a street. This has not been the case since the word &quot;street&quot; came to be limited to urban situations, and even in the automobile age, is still demonstrably false. A street may be temporarily blocked to all through traffic in order to secure the space for other uses, such as a street fair, a flea market, children at play, filming a movie, or construction work. Many streets are bracketed by bollards or Jersey barriers so as to keep out vehicles. These measures are often taken in a city&#x27;s busiest areas, the &quot;destination&quot; districts, when the volume of activity outgrows the capacity of private passenger vehicles to support it. A feature universal to all streets is a human-scale design that gives its users the space and security to feel engaged in their surroundings, whatever through traffic may pass.

====Vehicular traffic====

Despite this, the operator of a motor vehicle may (incompletely) regard a street as merely a thoroughfare for vehicular travel or parking. As far as concerns the driver, a street can be one-way or two-way: vehicles on one-way streets may travel in only one direction, while those on two-way streets may travel both ways. One way streets typically have signs reading &quot;ONE WAY&quot; and an arrow showing the direction of allowed travel. Most two-way streets are wide enough for at least two lanes of traffic.

Which lane is for which direction of traffic depends on what country the street is located in. On broader two-way streets, there is often a &quot;centre line&quot; marked down the middle of the street separating those lanes on which vehicular traffic goes in one direction from other lanes in which traffic goes in the opposite direction. Occasionally, there may be a median strip separating lanes of opposing traffic. If there is more than one lane going in one direction on a main street, these lanes may be separated by intermittent &quot;lane lines&quot;, marked on the street pavement. Side streets often do not have centre lines or lane lines.

====Parking for vehicles====
Many streets, especially side streets in residential areas, have an extra lane&#x27;s width on one or both sides for parallel parking. Most minor side streets allowing free parallel parking do not have pavement markings designating the parking lane. Main streets more often have parking lanes marked. Some streets are too busy or narrow for parking on the side. Sometimes parking on the sides of streets is allowed only at certain times. Curbside signs often state regulations about parking. Some streets, particularly in business areas, may have parking meters into which coins must be paid to allow parking in the adjacent space for a limited time. Other parking meters work on a credit card and ticket basis or pay and display. Parking lane markings on the pavement may designate the meter corresponding to a parking space. Some wide streets with light traffic allow &quot;angle parking&quot; or &quot;herringbone parking&quot;.

====Sidewalk and bicycle traffic====
Sidewalks (US usage) or pavements (UK usage) are often located alongside on one or usually both sides of the street within the public land strips beyond the curbs. Sidewalks serve a traffic purpose, by making walking easier and more attractive, but they also serve a social function, allowing neighbors to meet and interact on their walks. They also can foster economic activity, such as window shopping and sidewalk cafes. Some studies have found that shops on streets with sidewalks get more customers than similar shops without sidewalks.

An important element of sidewalk design is accessibility for persons with disabilities. Features that make sidewalks more accessible include curb ramps, tactile paving and accessible traffic signals. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires accessibility improvement on new and reconstructed streets within the US.

In most jurisdictions, bicycles are legally allowed to use streets, and required to follow the same traffic laws as motor vehicle traffic. Where the volume of bicycle traffic warrants and available right-of-way allows, provisions may be made to separate cyclists from motor vehicle traffic. Wider lanes may be provided next to the curb, or shoulders may be provided.
Bicycle lanes may be used on busy streets to provide some separation between bicycle traffic and motor vehicle traffic.

The bicycle lane may be placed between the travel lanes and the parking lanes, between the parking lanes and the curb, or for increased safety for cyclists, between curb and sidewalk. These poorer designs can lead to Dooring incidents and are unsafe for cycling.

A more sensible design is found in the Netherlands with a Protected Bicycle Path totally separate from the traffic which is safe for cycling.

====Tramlines====

Trams are generally considered to be environmentally friendly with tramlines running in streets with a combination of tram lanes or separate alignments are used, sometimes on a segregated right of way. Signalling and effective braking reduce the risk of a tram accident.

===Vehicular amenities and roadside hardware===

Often, a curb () is used to separate the vehicle traffic lanes from the adjacent pavement area and where people on bicycles are considered properly are used to separate cycling from traffic as well. Street signs, parking meters, bicycle stands, benches, traffic signals, and street lights are often found adjacent to streets. They may be behind the sidewalk, or between the sidewalk and the curb.

====Landscaping====
There may be a road verge (a strip of grass or other vegetation) between the carriageway () and the pavement on either side of the street on which grass or trees are often grown there for landscaping. These are often placed for beautification but are increasingly being used to control stormwater.

===Utilities===
Although primarily used for traffic, streets are important corridors for utilities such as electric power; communications such as telephone, cable television and fiber optic lines; storm and sanitary sewers; and natural gas lines.

===Street numbering===
Practically all public streets in Western countries and the majority elsewhere (though not in Japan; see Japanese addressing system) are given a street or road name, or at least a number, to identify them and any addresses located along the streets. Alleys, in some places, do not have names. The length of a lot of land along a street is referred to as the &quot;frontage&quot; of the lot.

===Interaction===
A street may assume the role of a town square for its regulars. Jane Jacobs, an economist and prominent urbanist, wrote extensively on the ways that interaction among the people who live and work on a particular street—&quot;eyes on the street&quot;—can reduce crime, encourage the exchange of ideas, and generally make the world a better place.

===Identity===

A street can often serve as the catalyst for the neighborhood&#x27;s prosperity, culture and . New Orleans&#x27; Bourbon Street is famous not only for its active nightlife but also for its role as the center of the city&#x27;s French Quarter. Similarly, the Bowery has at various times been New York City&#x27;s theater district, red-light district, skid row, restaurant supply district, and the center of the nation&#x27;s underground punk scene. Madison Avenue and Fleet Street are so strongly identified with their respective most famous types of commerce, that their names are sometimes applied to firms located elsewhere. Other streets mark divisions between neighborhoods of a city. For example, Yonge Street divides Toronto into east and west sides, and East Capitol Street divides Washington, D.C. into north and south.

Some streets are associated with the beautification of a town or city. Greenwood, Mississippi&#x27;s Grand Boulevard was once named one of America&#x27;s ten most beautiful streets by the U.S. Chambers of Commerce and the Garden Clubs of America. The 1,000 oak trees lining Grand Boulevard were planted in 1916 by Sally Humphreys Gwin, a charter member of the Greenwood Garden Club. In 1950, Gwin received a citation from the National Congress of the Daughters of the American Revolution in recognition of her work in the conservation of trees.

Streets also tend to aggregate establishments of similar nature and character. East 9th Street in Manhattan, for example, offers a cluster of Japanese restaurants, clothing stores, and cultural venues. In Washington, D.C., 17th Street and P Street are well known as epicenters of the city&#x27;s (relatively small) gay culture. Many cities have a Radio Row or Restaurant Row. Like in Philadelphia there is a small street called Jewelers&#x27; row giving the identity of a &quot;Diamond district&quot;. This phenomenon is the subject of urban location theory in economics. In Cleveland, Ohio, East 4th Street has become restaurant row for Cleveland. On East 4th is Michael Symon&#x27;s Lola Bistro and other restaurants.

==As distinct from other spaces==
A road, like a street, is often paved and used for travel. However, a street is characterized by the degree and quality of the street life
which it facilitates, whereas a road serves primarily as a through-passage for road vehicles or (less frequently) for pedestrians.
Buskers, beggars, boulevardiers, patrons of pavement cafés, peoplewatchers, streetwalkers, and a diversity of other characters are habitual users of a street; the same people would not typically be found on a road. A stroad is a thoroughfare that mixes - often unhappily - the characteristics of a street and a road.

In rural and suburban environments where street life is rarer, people frequently use the terms &quot;street&quot; and &quot;road&quot; interchangeably. Still, even here, what is called a &quot;street&quot; is usually a smaller thoroughfare, such as a road within a housing development feeding directly into individual driveways. In the last half of the 20th century planners of suburban streets often abandoned the tradition of a rigid, rectangular grid, and instead designed systems to discourage through-traffic. This and other traffic calming methods provided quiet for families and play space for children within a . Adolescent suburbanites find, in attenuated form, the amenities of street life in shopping malls where vehicles are forbidden.

A town square or plaza is a little more like a street, but a town square is rarely paved with asphalt and may not make any concessions for through-traffic at all.

===Nomenclature===

There is a haphazard relationship, at best, between a thoroughfare&#x27;s function and its name. For example, London&#x27;s Abbey Road serves all the vital functions of a street, despite its name, and locals are more apt to refer to the &quot;street&quot; outside than the &quot;road&quot;. A desolate road in rural Montana, on the other hand, may bear a sign proclaiming it &quot;Davidson Street&quot;, but this does not make it a &quot;street&quot; except in the original sense of a paved road.

In the United Kingdom the inhabitants of many towns will refer to their main thoroughfare as the High Street (in the United States and Canada it would be called the Main Street—however, occasionally &quot;Main Street&quot; in a city or town is a street other than the &quot;de facto&quot; main thoroughfare), and many of the ways leading off it will be named &quot;Road&quot; despite the urban setting. Thus the town&#x27;s so-called &quot;Roads&quot; will actually be more like streets than like road.

Some streets may even be called &quot;highways&quot;, even though they may carry no highway designation at all: This may arise when an historic road that was built to connect distant towns was named a &quot;street&quot; but originally never was in the truest sense. Some roads of this type which later became designated as numbered highways, became identified as said highway and may continue to colloquially be labelled as such from force of habit even if sections of it are subsequently urbanized and become an actual street and has its highway status decommissioned. Hurontario Street in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (which was formerly Ontario Highway 10, but predates it), is an example of this.

In some other English-speaking countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, cities are often divided by a main &quot;Road&quot;, with &quot;Streets&quot; leading from this &quot;Road&quot;, or the cities are divided by thoroughfares known as &quot;Streets&quot; or &quot;Roads&quot; with no apparent differentiation between the two. In Auckland in New Zealand, for example, the main shopping precinct is located around Queen Street and Karangahape Road.

Streets have existed for as long as humans have lived in permanent settlements
(see civilization). However, the development of modern civilization in much of the New World was driven by transportation provided by motor vehicles. In some parts of the English-speaking world, such as North America, many think of the street as a thoroughfare for vehicular traffic first and foremost. In this view, pedestrian traffic is incidental to the street&#x27;s purpose; a street consists of a thoroughfare running through the middle (in essence, a road), and may or may not have pavements (or sidewalks) along the sides.

In an even narrower sense, some may think of a street as only the vehicle-driven and parking part of the thoroughfare. Thus, sidewalks (pavements) and road verges would not be thought of as part of the street. A mother may tell her toddlers, &quot;Don&#x27;t go out into the street, so you don&#x27;t get hit by a car.&quot;

Among urban residents of the English-speaking world, the word &quot;street&quot; appears to carry only some of its original etymological connotations (i.e., the facilitation of traffic as a prime purpose, and &quot;street life&quot; as an incidental benefit). For instance, a &quot;New York Times&quot; writer lets casually slip the observation that automobile-laden Houston Street, in lower Manhattan, is &quot;a street that can hardly be called &#x27;street&#x27; anymore, transformed years ago into an eight-lane raceway that alternately resembles a Nascar event and a parking lot.&quot; Published in the paper&#x27;s Metro section, the article evidently presumes an audience with an innate grasp of the modern urban role of the street. To the readers of the Metro section, vehicular traffic does not reinforce, but rather detracts from, the essential &quot;street-ness&quot; of a street.

At least one map has been made to illustrate the geography of naming conventions for thoroughfares - comparing and contrasting &quot;avenue&quot;, &quot;boulevard&quot;, &quot;circle&quot;, &quot;road&quot;, &quot;street&quot;, and other labels.

==Culture==

Streets may be used as cultural spaces, for socializing and street parties, or for public festivals. 

In India, some cities have designated one or more streets as &quot;happy street&quot; or &quot;fun street&quot;, closing them for motor traffic for a few hours or a day, in order to make it possible for the inhabitants to use their street for recreational activities. Cities implementing this initiative include Kolkata Madurai, Visakhapatnam and Bangalore.

In the United States, &quot;open street&quot; events have been arranged in Detroit and New York City.

<text>Bahia () is one of the 26 states of Brazil, located in the Northeast Region of the country. It is the fourth-largest Brazilian state by population (after São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro) and the 5th-largest by area. Bahia&#x27;s capital is the city of Salvador (formerly known as &quot;Cidade do São Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos&quot;, literally &quot;City of the Holy Savior of the Bay of All the Saints&quot;), on a spit of land separating the Bay of All Saints from the Atlantic. Once a stronghold of supporters of direct rule of Brazil by the Portuguese monarchy, and dominated by agricultural, slaving, and ranching interests, Bahia is now a predominantly working-class industrial and agricultural state. The state is home to 7% of the Brazilian population and produces 4.2% of the country&#x27;s GDP. It is divided into 417 municipalities. The state has a strong tourism power in several regions of its territory, for example: Salvador, Morro de São Paulo, Porto Seguro, Ilhéus, Entre Rios, Itacaré, Chapada Diamantina, Bom Jesus da Lapa, São Desidério etc.

== Geography ==

Bahia is bordered on the east by the Atlantic Ocean. The Bay of All Saints is the largest bay on the Brazilian coast. Under the Brazilian Empire, it was bounded on the north by the Rio Real and by the Jequitinhonha on the south, but Bahia now comprises an irregular shape bound by other states of Brazil, some of which were formed from it. In the north, it is now bordered (from east to west) by Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco and Piauí. In the northwest, it is bordered by Tocantins. In the southwest, it borders Goiás, and in the south it is bordered (from east to west) by Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais.

The state is crossed from west to east by many rivers, but the most important is the São Francisco, which starts in Minas Gerais and runs through western Bahia before emptying into the Atlantic between Sergipe and Alagoas. Formerly plied by paddlewheel steamers, the river is only navigable to small modern craft but is still vital to the arid west since it continuously supplies water during seasons. The Sobradinho Dam created one of the largest reservoirs in the world; other major hydroelectric projects along its length include the Paulo Afonso Hydroelectric Complex and the Itaparica or Luiz Gonzaga Dam.

===Regions===
Bahia&#x27;s geographical regions comprise the Atlantic Forest; the maritime region (&quot;Recôncavo&quot;) radiating from the Bay of All Saints, the site of sugar and tobacco cultivation; and the &#x27;, which includes the &#x27; region of Bahia&#x27;s far interior. The state has the Diamantina Tableland (&#x27;), which divides it into two distinct geographical zones. The rain falls regularly in the eastern section. The western area is more arid and its predominate vegetation the &#x27;. The natural aridity was greatly worsened over the 19th century by the cowboys&#x27; habit of starting wildfires each year to improve the quality of the grass. The Chapada Diamantina National Park is home to picturesque &quot;&quot;.

===Climate===
Bahia&#x27;s climate is tropical. It has the longest coastline of the country: 1,103 km long (685 miles; north coast: 143; Bay of All Saints: 124; and southern: 418). With 68% of its territory located in the semi-arid zone, the State presents diversified climates and an average rainfall that varies from per year, depending on the region.


== History ==

The Portuguese Pedro Álvares Cabral sighted Monte Pascoal (&quot;Easter Mountain&quot;) near Itamaraju and landed at what is now Porto Seguro on the southern coast of Bahia in 1500, claiming the territory for Portugal. In 1549, Portugal established the city of Salvador on a hill facing the Bay of All Saints. The city and surrounding captaincy served as an administrative capital of Portugal&#x27;s colonies in the Americas until 1763. It remained the religious capital of Brazil&#x27;s Roman Catholic hierarchy, with its archbishop serving as the national primate until 1907. Salvador holds the country&#x27;s oldest cathedral and first medical college (1810), and an engineering school was established in 1899.

Bahia&#x27;s captaincy was the first to fail, with its lands reverting to the Portuguese crown in 1549. While Portugal was united with Spain, the Dutch West India companies tried to conquer Bahia but was unsuccessful in the area, with Dutch Brazil restricted to the area from Pernambuco Northward.

Bahia was a center of sugarcane cultivation from the 16th to the 18th centuries and contains a number of historic towns, such as Cachoeira, dating from this era. Integral to the sugar economy was the importation of a vast number of African slaves: more than a third of all slaves taken from Africa were sent to Brazil, mostly to be processed in Bahia before being sent to work in plantations elsewhere in the country.

The state was the last area of the country to join the Empire of Brazil, as members in the local elite remained loyal to the Portuguese crown after the rest of the country proclaimed independence under on 7 September 1822. Control of the province was disputed in several battles, mostly in Pirajá, before the Portuguese were fully expelled on 2 July 1823. It became a Brazilian state in 1889.

Charles Darwin visited Bahia in 1832 on his famous voyage on the &quot;Beagle&quot;. In 1835, Bahia was the site of an urban slave revolt, the Malê Revolt of 1835 by the predominantly Muslim West African slaves at the time. The term &quot;malê&quot; was commonly used to refer to Muslims at the time from the Yoruba word &quot;imale&quot;. The revolt is particularly notable as the greatest slave rebellion in the history of the Bahia. Under the Empire, Bahia returned 14 deputies to the general assembly and 7 senators; its own provincial assembly consisted of 36 members. In the 19th century, cotton, coffee, and tobacco plantations joined those for sugarcane and the discovery of diamonds in 1844 led to large influx of &quot;washers&quot; (&quot;&quot;) until the still-larger deposits in South Africa came to light. A smaller boom hit Caetité in 1872 upon the discovery of amethysts there. The cattle industry of the interior led to the development of Feira de Santana before collapsing in a series of droughts.

==Politics==
Historically, Bahia&#x27;s politics and that of the country have been closely intertwined, initially due to Salvador&#x27;s status as the first capital of Brazil. During the imperial period, several prime ministers originated from Bahia; during the early years of the Republic, Bahia produced some noteworthy national figures, such as Ruy Barbosa, Cezar Zama, and Aristides Spínola, amongst others.

During the First Brazilian Republic (&quot;República Velha&quot;) the biggest name in the state&#x27;s politics was José Joaquim Seabra, also known as J. J. Seabra; the Vargas era and the subsequent re-democratization period saw the rise of Juracy Magalhães and Otávio Mangabeira, respectively. During the military dictatorship, the governorship of Antônio Carlos Magalhães (also known by his initials, ACM) marked the politics of Bahia for three decades, with one brief defeat in 1980 by Waldir Pires. Despite this defeat ACM later occupied many other public offices; he died in 2007 while serving as senator. ACM&#x27;s wide-reaching influence in the state&#x27;s politics has been dubbed &quot;Carlismo&quot;, and is considered an example of a larger phenomenon called coronelismo (&quot;colonel-ism&quot;).

After the end of military rule in Brazil in 1985, the government of the state of Bahia oscillated between two parties, the &quot;Partido da Frente Liberal&quot; (PFL, now the Democrats) and the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB). The Workers&#x27; Party (PT) was elected to the governorship in 2007 and has held it ever since, through five successive elections (2006, 2010, 2014, 2018, and 2022).

=== Government structure ===
As a federative unit of Brazil, Bahia has its own three branches of government (executive, legislative, judiciary), which are operated by the Governor, the Legislative Assembly and the Court of Justice of the State of Bahia, respectively. Elected terms last four years, with state and federal elections being held simultaneously. The governor of the state is limited to two consecutive terms. The Legislative Assembly is composed of 63 state deputies. At the federal level, Bahia is represented by three senators and 39 federal deputies. Municipal elections are held two years after the state and federal elections.

The state capital is the city of Salvador, but once a year the capital is moved to Cachoeira in recognition of the city&#x27;s importance in the struggle for the independence of Brazil.

There are 10,110,100 registered voters, according to data from 2012, making Bahia the state with the fourth highest number of voters in the country. Most voters reside in the capital (and most populous city), Salvador.

All 29 parties registered in Brazil have chapters in Bahia.

== Demographics ==

According to IBGE data of 2022, there were 14,141,626 people residing in the state. The population density was . Urban population: 67.4% (2006); Population growth: 1.1% (1991–2000); Houses: 3,826,000 (2006). The last National Census in 2022 showed the following numbers: 8,103,964 Brown (Multiracial) people (57.3%), 2,772,837 White people (19.60%), 3,164,691 Black people (22.4%), 83,658 Amerindian people (0.6%).

According to &quot;Instituto Socioambiental&quot;, there are 14 Indigenous groups in the state: Atikum, Kaimbé, Kantaruré, Kiriri, Pankaru, Pankararé, Pataxó, Pataxó Hã-ha-
hãe, Payayá, Truká, Tumbalalá, Tupinambá, Tuxá and Xukuru-Kariri.

Historically, the population was estimated at 1.45 million in the 1870s and was 1.92 million at the time of the 1890 Brazilian census.

===Public safety===
Bahia has one of the highest crime rates in the country, having four of the ten most violent cities in Brazil. Gun violence in the state more than doubled from 2004 to 2014, ranking first out of the 26 states of Brazil. In 2014, the state also had the highest number of murders in the country.

==Culture==


As the chief locus of the early Brazilian slave trade, Bahia is considered to possess the greatest and most distinctive African imprint, in terms of culture and customs, in Brazil. These include the Yoruba-derived religious system of Candomblé, the capoeira (martial art emerged in Quilombo dos Palmares, located in the state of Alagoas ), African-derived music such as samba (especially Brazilian samba precursor, the samba-de-roda), afoxé, and axé, and a cuisine with strong links to western Africa.

In the interior of the state, there is the traditional culture of the &quot;vaqueiros&quot; among agricultural communities. From the 1550s onward, in Bahia, these farmers were integral to the process of expansion away from the coasts of Brazil.

===Arts===
Bahia is the birthplace of many noted Brazilian artists, writers and musicians. Among the noted musical figures born in the state are Dorival Caymmi, João Gilberto, Gilberto Gil, Tom Zé, Raul Seixas, Pepeu Gomes, Margareth Menezes, Daniela Mercury, Carlinhos Brown, Ivete Sangalo, and Pitty.

The city of Salvador is also home to groups known as &quot;blocos-afros&quot;, including Ilê Aiyê, Olodum and Timbalada, where they represent, in their visual and musical figures, African indoles, who are based in the city of Salvador in the historical ethnicity due to colonization. The king of rock&#x27;n roll in Brazil was also from Bahia. Born Raul Seixas, he was known as &quot;Maluco Beleza&quot; or &quot;Peaceful Lunatic&quot; (being &quot;beleza (beauty)&quot; in this manner means to be either &quot;in peace&quot; or &quot;tranquil&quot;).

During the 19th century, one of Brazil&#x27;s greatest poets, the Bahian abolitionist poet and playwright Castro Alves, a native of the &quot;recôncavo&quot; city of Cachoeira, penned his poem, &quot;Navio negreiro&quot;, about slavery; the poem is considered a masterpiece of Brazilian Romanticism and a central anti-slavery text.

Other notable Bahian writers include playwright and screenwriter Dias Gomes, Gregório de Matos, who wrote during the 17th century and was one of the first Brazilian writers, and Fr. António Vieira, who during the colonial period was one of many authors who contributed to the expansion of the Portuguese language throughout the Brazilian territory.

One of Brazil&#x27;s most prominent writers of the 20th century, Jorge Amado, was born in the southeastern Bahian city of Itabuna, and resided for many years in Salvador. His major novels include &quot;Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon&quot;; &quot;Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands&quot;; and &quot;Tieta, the Goat Girl&quot;, all of which became internationally renowned films. Other notable authors from Bahia include the fiction writers João Ubaldo Ribeiro and historic writer Euclides da Cunha, who wrote &quot;Os Sertões&quot;.

In the visual and plastic arts, one of the best known Bahian figures was the multigenre artist and Argentinian native Hector Julio Páride Bernabó, also known as Carybé (1911–1997). Fine examples of his work are visible in the Afro-Brazilian Museum in Salvador.

The baiano film director, actor, and screenwriter, Glauber Rocha ,was born in the south-west Bahian city of Vitória da Conquista, was one of the most influential moviemakers of Brazilian cinema and a key figure of Cinema Novo. His films &quot;Black God, White Devil&quot; and &quot;Entranced Earth&quot; are often considered to be two of the greatest achievements in Brazilian cinematic history, being selected by Abraccine as, respectively, the second and fifth best Brazilian films of all-time.

===Tourism and recreation===

There is a World Heritage Site in Salvador. Pelourinho was once Salvador&#x27;s principal red-light district as well as a working-class neighborhood that was home to thousands of Afro-Brazilians. Since 1992, however, the overwhelming majority of these people have been forcibly removed and replaced by boutiques, NGO headquarters, government offices, folkloric representations, monuments, and amenities for tourists.

== Economy ==
In 2004, Bahia comprised 4.9% of the economic activity of Brazil and it has the biggest GDP of the states of the North and Northeast. The industrial sector is the largest component of GDP at 48.5%, followed by the service sector at 40.8%. Agriculture represents 10.7% of GDP (2004). Bahia exports: chemicals 22.4%, fuel 17.5%, mineral metallics 13%, paper 9.4%, cacao 5.6%, vehicles 4.8%, soybean 4.5% (2002). In addition to important agricultural and industrial sectors, the state also has considerable mineral and petroleum deposits. In recent years, soy cultivation has increased substantially in the state.

During the colonial and imperial periods, Bahia was a center of Brazilian sugarcane production and slave trading. In the 19th century, the Bay of All Saints was also a whaling spot, as some species of whales used the bay as a mating ground. By that time, the province was also growing cotton, coffee, and tobacco with great success. mandioc, rice, beans, and corn, saffron, oranges, mangoes, and other fruit were grown for local consumption. The arid interior was mostly used for cattle-farming, but this was ruined by a series of droughts caused in part by the custom of starting annual wildfires to improve the grass. Diamonds, gold, and amethysts were panned for in the rivers, while coal was mined on Itaparica. cacao was being farmed by the time of the First World War. It grew more than the national average, because the state was previously below the average level.

In agriculture, the state stands out in the production of cotton, cocoa, soy and tropical fruits such as coconut, papaya, mango, banana and guarana, in addition to also producing sugar cane, orange, beans and cassava, among others.

In 2017, the Northeast Region was the largest producer of coconut in the country, with 74.0% of national production. Bahia produced 351 million fruits, being the leader in the country. However, the sector has been suffering strong competition and losing market to Indonesia, the Philippines and India, the world&#x27;s largest producers, who even export coconut water to Brazil. In addition to climatic problems, the low productivity of coconut palms in the Northeast Region is the result of factors related to the variety of coconut harvested and the technological level used in coastal regions. In these areas, the semi-extractive cultivation system still prevails, with low fertility and without the adoption of cultural management practices. The three states that have the largest production, Bahia, Sergipe and Ceará, present a yield three times lower than that of Pernambuco, which is in 5th place in the national production. This is because most of the coconut trees in these three states are located in coastal areas and cultivated in semi-extractivist systems.

In the production of cocoa, for a long time, Bahia led the Brazilian production. Today, it is disputing the leadership of national production with the state of Pará. In 2017 Pará obtained the leadership for the first time. In 2019, people from Pará harvested 135 thousand tons of cocoa, and Bahians harvested 130 thousand tons. Bahia&#x27;s cocoa area is practically three times larger than that of Pará, but Pará&#x27;s productivity is practically three times greater. Some factors that explain this are: the crops in Bahia are more extractivist, and those in Pará have a more modern and commercial style, in addition to paraenses using more productive and resistant seeds, and their region providing resistance to Witch&#x27;s broom.

In 2018, the Northeast was in third place among the regions that most produce sugar cane in the country. Brazil is the world&#x27;s largest producer, with 672.8 million tons harvested this year. The Northeast harvested 45.7 million tons, 6.8% of national production. Alagoas is the largest producer, with 33.3% of Northeastern production (15.2 million tons). Pernambuco is the 2nd largest producer in the Northeast, with 22.7% of the total in the region (10.3 million tons). Paraíba has 11.9% of northeastern production (5.5 million tons) and Bahia, 10.24% of production (4.7 million tons).

Bahia is the 2nd largest producer of cotton in Brazil, losing only to Mato Grosso. In 2019, it harvested 1.5 million tonnes of the product.

In soy, Brazil produced close to 120 million tons in 2019, being the largest world producer. In 2019, the Northeast produced close to 10.7 million tons, or 9% of the Brazilian total. The largest producer in the Northeast was Bahia (5.3 million tons).

In the production of maize, in 2018 Brazil was the 3rd largest producer in the world, with 82 million tons. The Northeast produced about 8.4% of the country&#x27;s total. Bahia was the largest producer in the Northeast, with 2.2 million tons.

In 2018, the South Region was the main producer of beans with 26.4% of the total, followed by the Midwest (25.4%), Southeast Region (25.1%), Northeast (20.6%) and North (2.5%). The largest producers in the Northeast were Ceará and Bahia.

In cassava production, Brazil produced a total of 17.6 million tons in 2018. Maranhão was the 7th largest producer in the country, with 681 thousand tons. Ceará was 9th, with 622 thousand tons. Bahia was 10th with 610 thousand tons. In total, the northeast produced 3,5 million tons.

Bahia was the fourth largest producer of oranges in Brazil in 2018, with a total of 604 thousand tons, 3,6% of the national production.

Bahia is the second largest fruit producer in the country, with more than 3.3 million tons a year, behind São Paulo. The north of Bahia is one of the main fruit suppliers in the country. The State is one of the main national producers of ten types of fruit. In 2017, Bahia led the production of cajarana, coconut, count fruit or pinecone, soursop, umbu, jackfruit, licuri, mango and passion fruit, and is in second place in cocoa almond, atemoia, cupuaçu, lime and lemon, and third in banana, carambola, guava, papaya, watermelon, melon, cherry, pomegranate and table grapes. In all, 34 products from Bahia&#x27;s fruit culture have an important participation in the national economy.

Rio Grande do Norte is the largest producer of melon in the country. In 2017 it produced 354 thousand tons. The Northeast region accounted for 95.8% of the country&#x27;s production in 2007. In addition to Rio Grande do Norte, which in 2005 produced 45.4% of the country&#x27;s total, the other 3 largest in the country were Ceará, Bahia and Pernambuco.

In the production of papaya, in 2018 Bahia was the 2nd largest producer state in Brazil, almost equaling with Espírito Santo: 337 thousand tons.

Bahia was the largest producer of mango in the country in 2019, with production of around 281 thousand tons per year. Juazeiro (130 thousand tons per year) and Casa Nova (54 thousand tons per year) are at the top of the list of Brazilian cities that lead the cultivation of fruit.

In the production of banana, in 2018 Bahia was the 2nd largest national producer.

Bahia is the largest Brazilian producer of guaraná. In 2017, Brazilian production was close to 3.3 million tons. Bahia harvested 2.3 million (mainly in the city of Taperoá), Amazonas 0.7 million (mainly in the city of Maués) and the rest of the country, 0.3 million. Despite the fact that the fruit originated in the Amazon, since 1989 Bahia has beaten Amazonas in terms of production volume and guarana productivity, because the soil in Bahia is more favorable, in addition to the absence of diseases in the region. The most famous users of the product, however, acquire 90% to 100% of their guarana from the Amazon region, such as Ambev and Coca-Cola. Bahian guarana prices are well below those of other states, but Sudam&#x27;s tax exemptions lead the beverage industry to prefer to purchase seeds in the North, which helps maintain the highest added value of Amazonian guarana. The pharmaceutical industries and importers, on the other hand, buy more guarana from Bahia, due to the price.

The Northeast region housed 93.2% of the Brazilian goat herd (8,944,461 heads) and 64.2% of the sheep herd (11,544,939 heads) in 2017. Bahia concentrated 30.9% of the goat herd and 20.9% of the national sheep herd. Casa Nova took first place in the municipal ranking with the largest numbers of both species.

In 2017, Bahia had 1.68% of the national mineral participation (4th place in the country). Bahia had production of gold (6.2 tons at a value of R$730 million), copper (56 thousand tons, at a value of R$404 million); chrome (520 thousand tons, at a value of R$254 million) and vanadium (358 thousand tons, at a value of R$91 million).

Bahia had an industrial GDP of R$53.0 billion in 2017, equivalent to 4.4% of the national industry. It employs 356,997 workers in the industry. The main industrial sectors are: Construction (24.8%), Industrial Services of Public Utility, such as Electricity and Water (15.0%), Petroleum Derivatives and Biofuels (13.8%), Chemicals (9.4%), and Food (6.1%). These 5 sectors concentrate 69.1% of the state&#x27;s industry.

Bahian industry have automobile and tyre industries, footwear and textiles, furniture, food and beverages, cosmetics and perfumes, information technology and naval sectors.

In Brazil, the automotive sector represents close to 22% of industrial GDP. Bahia has a Ford factory. It was created in Camaçari (2001). The Bahian automotive sector, led by Ford was in 2005 the third largest contributor (14.6%) to the Bahian GDP.

===Chemical and petrochemical===
Bahia&#x27;s Petrochemical Pole is the largest integrated complex in the Southern Hemisphere, and is the result of R$10 billion in investments, accounting for a third of the state&#x27;s exports and for nearly half of the industrial production value.

====Reconcavo Basin====
The Reconcavo Basin has been a principal petroleum-producing region, mainly from the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous Bahia Supergroup, since 1939 and contains the Agua Grande Field (discovered in 1951 by the Conselho Nacional de Petroleo and producing from the Sergei and Candeias Formations at about 1 km depth and the shallower Ilhas Formation), the Dom Joao Field (discovered in 1947 by the Conselho Nacional de Petroleo and producing from the Sergei Formation at a depth of about 200 m), the Miranga Field (discovered in 1965 by Petrobras producing from the Ilhas Formation at a depth of about 1 km), the Candeias Field (discovered in 1941 by Conselho Nacional de Petroleo and producing from the Candeias Formation at a depth ranging from 690 to 2400 m), the Buracica Field (discovered in 1959 by Petrobras and producing from the Sergi Formation at about 600 m depth), and the Taquipe Field (discovered in 1958 by Petrobras and producing from the Ilhas Formation).

===Highways===
The state has its transportation based on highways, with few options in other sectors. The main highways in the state are all from the Federal Government:

* BR-101 – It borders the state coast, connecting it with the country&#x27;s richest region (Southeast) and with the rest of the Northeast. It passes through the cocoa producing area of the state, in the cities of Itabuna and Ilhéus, reaching the capital Salvador and from there to Aracaju, capital of Sergipe.
* BR-116 – also crosses the state from north to south, parallel to BR 101 but passing further inland. It cuts through some of the important cities of the state, such as Vitória da Conquista, Jequié, Feira de Santana and Euclides da Cunha, going towards the interior of Pernambuco and Fortaleza, capital of Ceará.
* BR-242 – the highway cuts the state in half in an east–west direction, connecting Salvador to Brasília, the country&#x27;s capital. It passes through important cities like Lençóis, Barreiras and Luís Eduardo Magalhães.
* BR-407 – together with BR-324, the highway connects the region of Bahia, which is the largest producer of fruit and the largest breeder of sheep and goats, in the cities of Juazeiro and Casa Nova, to Feira de Santana, Salvador and southeastern Brazil. The BR-235 borders the North of the state, connecting these same regions to the coast of Bahia.
* BR-110 – crossing the interior of the Northeast Region, this highway connects Salvador with the hydroelectric plant of Paulo Afonso and reaches Mossoró, in Rio Grande do Norte

Also noteworthy is the BR-030, which crosses the south of Bahia in an east–west direction.

===Ports===
With cargo volume that grows year after year following the same economic development rhythm implemented in the State, the Port of Salvador, located on the Bay of All Saints, holds status as the port with the highest movement of containers of the North/Northeast and the second-leading fruit exporter in Brazil. The port&#x27;s facilities operate from 8 a.m. to noon and from 1:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.

The ability to handle high shipping volume has positioned the port of Salvador for new investments in technological modernization, and the port is noted for implementing a high level of operational flexibility and competitive rates. The goal of port officials is to offer the necessary infrastructure for the movement of goods, while simultaneously meeting the needs of international importers and exporters.

==Sports==

Football is the most popular sport. The two most popular football teams are EC Bahia and EC Vitória, in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A (first division).

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 2001 was the 46th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Fly on the Wings of Love&quot; by Olsen Brothers. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR), the contest was held at the Parken Stadium on 12 May 2001. The contest was presented by Danish television presenter Natasja Crone Back and actor Søren Pilmark.

Twenty-three countries took part in the contest. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, and Slovenia returned after their relegation from the previous edition. Greece also returned after their two-year absence, following a relegation and financial trouble.
Meanwhile, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, Macedonia, Romania, and Switzerland were relegated.

The winner was Estonia with the song &quot;Everybody&quot;, performed by Tanel Padar, Dave Benton and 2XL, and written by Ivar Must and Maian Kärmas. This was the first time the contest was won by one of the countries from the former Eastern bloc that debuted in the contest in the 1990s. Denmark, Greece, France and Sweden rounded out the top five with Greece achieving its best result up to that point in the contest. Further down the table, Slovenia equalled their best result from , finishing seventh. Meanwhile, Ireland finished in 21st place, giving the nation its worst placement up to that point.

== Location ==

Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, was the chosen host city. The venue choice for the contest was Parken Stadium, the national football stadium, located in the Indre Østerbro district of Copenhagen, Denmark, built from 1990 to 1992.

The Danish national broadcaster the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR) faced some problems whilst organising the contest such as a lack of funds and the search for a suitable venue. The three largest cities in DenmarkCopenhagen, Aarhus and Odenseall made bids to host the contest. Eventually, DR chose the large football stadium Parken as the host venue, after the company running the stadium agreed to add a retractable roof to the building. This solution made it the biggest venue ever to host a Eurovision Song Contest with room for an audience of 38,000, breaking the record of 16,000 held by the previous year&#x27;s hosts Sweden. However, the venue&#x27;s scale meant that many audience members could not see the stage, and for many entries the hall appeared to be too big.

==Participating countries==
Per the rules of the contest twenty-three countries were allowed to participate in the event. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Lithuania, Poland and Portugal and Slovenia returned after being relegated from the previous year&#x27;s event. 2000 participants Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, Macedonia, Romania and Switzerland were absent from this edition.

===Qualification===
Due to the high number of countries wishing to enter the contest a relegation system was introduced in 1993 in order to reduce the number of countries which could compete in each year&#x27;s contest. Any relegated countries would be able to return the following year, thus allowing all countries the opportunity to compete in at least one in every two editions. The relegation rules introduced for the 1997 contest were again utilised ahead of the 2001 contest, based on each country&#x27;s average points total in previous contests. The twenty-three participants were made up of the previous year&#x27;s winning country, &quot;Big Four&quot; countries, the twelve countries which had obtained the highest average points total over the preceding five contests, and any eligible countries which did not compete in the 2000 contest. In cases where the average was identical between two or more countries the total number of points scored in the most recent contest determined the final order.

, , , , and returned after being excluded from participating in the 2000 contest, while , , , , , , , the seven countries with the lowest average result in the past five contests, were relegated.

The calculations used to determine the countries relegated for the 2001 contest are outlined in the table below.

==Production==
The Eurovision Song Contest 2001 was produced by the Danish public broadcaster the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR). Jørgen Ramskov served as executive producer, Jan Frifelt served as director and Christine Marchal-Ortiz served as EBU scrutineer. Television presenter Natasja Crone Back and actor Søren Pilmark were the presenters of the 2001 contest.

Rehearsals in the venue for the competing acts were held from 7 to 12 May 2001. Four technical rehearsals from 7 to 10 May and two dress rehearsals on 11 and 12 May were held in a lead up to the contest.

The logo for this year&#x27;s contest was developed by Danish companies Kontrapunkt, 2Graphic Design and EventRelations. It was made out of four circles, placed in the shape of a heart. The four circles were also present in the stage design, with the light construction made of the same four rings. The whole rig could be formed into various shapes to add to each country&#x27;s staging. The design was described by its designers as &quot;a modern expression of a heart which symbolises openness, warmth, attitudes, pulse and movement&quot;.
The draw to the determine the running order of competing countries was held on 21 November 2000.

A compilation album featuring all 23 competing entries was released on 5 May 2001 by EMI Records and CMC International.

== Format ==
=== Entries ===
Each participating broadcaster was represented in the contest by one song, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country&#x27;s performance, and all performers must have reached the age of 16 in the year of the contest. Selected entries were not permitted to be released commercially before 1 January 2001, and were then only allowed to be released in the country they represented until after the contest was held. Entries were required to be selected by each country&#x27;s participating broadcaster by 11 March, and the final submission date for all selected entries to be received by the contest organisers was set for 16 March. This submission was required to include a sound recording of the entry and backing track for use during the contest, a video presentation of the song on stage being performed by the artists, and the text of the song lyrics in its original language and translations in French and English for distribution to the participating broadcasters, their commentators and juries.

=== Voting procedure ===

The results of the 2001 contest were determined through the same scoring system as had first been introduced in : each country awarded twelve points to its favourite entry, followed by ten points to its second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to one for the remaining songs which featured in the country&#x27;s top ten, with countries unable to vote for their own entry. Each participating country was required to use televoting to determine their points. Viewers had a total of five minutes to register their vote by calling one of twenty-two different telephone numbers to represent the twenty-three competing entries except that which represented their own country, with voting lines opening following the performance of the last competing entry. Once phone lines were opened a video recap containing short clips of each competing entry with the accompanying phone number for voting was shown in order to aid viewers during the voting window. Systems were also put in place to prevent lobby groups from one country voting for their song by travelling to other countries.

Countries which were unable to hold a televote due to technological limitations were granted an exception, and their points were determined by an assembled jury of eight individuals, which was required to be split evenly between members of the public and music professionals, comprised additionally of an equal number of men and women, and below and above 30 years of age. Countries using televoting were also required to appoint a back-up jury of the same composition which would be called into action upon technical failure preventing the televote results from being used. Each jury member voted in secret and awarded between one and ten votes to each participating song, excluding that from their own country and with no abstentions permitted. The votes of each member were collected following the country&#x27;s performance and then tallied by the non-voting jury chairperson to determine the points to be awarded.

== Contest overview ==

The contest took place on 12 May 2001. The table below outlines the participating countries, the order in which they performed, the competing artists and songs, and the results of the voting.

The show was opened by the last year&#x27;s Eurovision winners, the Olsen Brothers, with a snippet from their winning Eurovision song &quot;Fly on the Wings of Love&quot;, followed by their latest single &quot;Walk Right Back&quot;, a smash hit in Denmark at the time. The interval act featured medley of songs performed by Aqua and Safri Duo.

The winner was Estonia represented by the song &quot;Everybody&quot;, composed by Ivar Must, written by Maian Kärmas and performed by Tanel Padar, Dave Benton and 2XL. This marked Estonia&#x27;s first victory in the contest. Norway meanwhile finished in last place for the ninth time.

Prior to the contest Greece were hotly tipped to win by the bookmakers, Sweden the second favourites, with France, Slovenia and host country Denmark expected to round out the top 5. However, as the voting progressed it quickly became a two-horse race between host Denmark and Estonia.

Dave Benton, who was born and raised in Aruba, was the first black person and, at the age of 50 years and 101 days, the oldest contestant at the time to win the contest.


=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing, in English or French, the votes for its respective country. As had been the case since the , the spokespersons were connected via satellite and appeared in vision during the broadcast. Spokespersons at the 2001 contest are listed below.

== Detailed voting results ==

The majority of participating countries held a televote, where the top ten most voted for songs were awarded the 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 points. This year the EBU introduced for the first time a mix of voting systems (50% televoting and 50% jury) for those countries that didn&#x27;t want to use 100% televoting. Only three votes were allowed per household.

According to the EBU rules, every broadcaster was free to make a choice between the full televoting system and the mixed 50-50 system. In exceptional circumstances, where televoting was not possible at all, only a jury was used.

===12 points===
The below table summarises how the maximum 12 points were awarded from one country to another. The winning country is shown in bold. Estonia received the maximum score of 12 points from nine of the voting countries, with Denmark receiving six sets of 12 points each, France receiving three sets, Greece receiving two, and Malta, Portugal and Spain each receiving one maximum score.

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay live and in full the contest via television. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;; any passive countries wishing to participate in the following year&#x27;s event were also required to provide a live broadcast of the contest or a deferred broadcast within 24 hours. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their viewers. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators, are shown in the tables below.

In addition to the broadcasts by EBU members, the contest was also available on the internet for the second time. Sponsored by Yahoo!, a webcast of the contest was available around the world.

== Incidents ==
Controversy was again rife in the contest: the United Kingdom TV commentator Terry Wogan repeatedly made critical comments about the hosts, and dubbed them &quot;Doctor Death and the Tooth Fairy/The Little Mermaid&quot; after providing their entire commentary in rhyming couplets. The Danes were so offended that the BBC was obliged to issue an apology on Wogan&#x27;s comments.

Controversy also surrounded the Swedish song, &quot;Listen To Your Heartbeat&quot;, which was repeatedly accused as a plagiarism of the Belgian entry for the 1996 contest, &quot;Liefde is een kaartspel&quot;. Eventually the EBU decided for the matter to be settled in court, with the song allowed to compete as long as the courts did not declare the song as plagiarism. At first this was denied by the Swedish songwriters, one of whom was Thomas G:son, but after the Belgian songwriters and the author&#x27;s organisation SABAM pressed for legal action, a cash settlement was agreed.

During the voting the Danish band Aqua performed with a medley of their singles, with percussion ensemble Safri Duo performing in the medley. Although enjoyable, people complained about it being a little bit &quot;rude&quot; as there was some swearing during the performance, both at the beginning and end of &quot;Barbie Girl&quot;.

==Other awards==
===Barbara Dex Award===
The Barbara Dex Award is the award, created by fansite House of Eurovision, was awarded to the performer deemed to have been the &quot;worst dressed&quot; among the participants. The winner in 2001 was Polish representative Piasek, as determined by the visitors of the website House of Eurovision.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 2000 was the 45th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, held on 13 May 2000 at the Globe Arena in Stockholm, Sweden and presented by Kattis Ahlström and Anders Lundin. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (SVT), the contest was held in Sweden following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Take Me to Your Heaven&quot; by Charlotte Nilsson. With an audience of 13,000 people present, the 2000 contest was the largest yet seen in its history.

Twenty-four countries took part in the contest. , , , and , which had participated in the 1999 contest, were relegated after achieving the lowest average points totals over the preceding five contests. These countries were replaced by in its first contest appearance, , , and which were relegated from the previous year&#x27;s event, and which returned after a two-year absence. The winner was with the song &quot;Fly on the Wings of Love&quot;, written by Jørgen Olsen and performed by the Olsen Brothers. Although Denmark was not a pre-contest favourite to win the title, &quot;Fly on the Wings of Love&quot; received the third-highest points total yet seen in the contest, gaining 195 points, and the song went on to become a success in singles charts across Europe.

Russia, Latvia, , and rounded out the top five, with Russia and Estonia achieving their best ever results, and Latvia achieving one of the highest placings for a début entry in the contest&#x27;s history. The 2000 contest was the first to be broadcast over the internet, with a webcast of the live show available in Europe, the United States, Canada and Australia through Microsoft&#x27;s MSN portals.

== Location ==

The 2000 contest took place in Stockholm, Sweden, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Take Me to Your Heaven&quot;, performed by Charlotte Nilsson. It was the fourth time that Sweden had staged the contest, following the , and contests held in Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmö, respectively. The selected venue was the Globe Arena, also known as in Swedish, an indoor arena first opened in 1989 and the world&#x27;s largest hemispherical building. With capacity for over 16,000 people, which was reduced slightly to 13,000 for the contest, the Globe Arena was the largest venue the Eurovision Song Contest had ever seen at that point.

Host broadcaster (SVT) approached venues in three citiesnamely Gothenburg, Malmö and Stockholmto establish a suitable host city and venue for the contest. The venues chosen following this initial round of discussions were the Scandinavium in Gothenburg, which had previously hosted the 1985 contest; in Malmö; and in Stockholm. Malmö was subsequently eliminated as a potential host city, due to high costs required to complete a suitable arena within the Malmömässan area and which would still have a relatively small audience capacity compared to the other venues on offer. Of the remaining options, Stockholm and were ultimately chosen by SVT managing director to host the event. Stockholm&#x27;s bid won out over Gothenburg due to the lower costs of producing the event in the capital as well as with Stockholm having not hosted the event since 1975.

== Participating countries ==
Per the rules of the contest twenty-four countries were allowed to participate in the 2000 contest, one more than the twenty-three countries that participated in the . entered the contest for the first time, and , , , , and returned after being absent from the previous year&#x27;s event. 1999 participants , , , and did not participate in this year&#x27;s contest.

Several of the performing artists had previously competed as lead artists in past editions. Serafín Zubiri competed in the contest for a second time, having previously participated for . Roger Pontare competed as a solo artist in this year&#x27;s edition, following his appearance for where he competed alongside Marie Bergman. The two members of the Cypriot duo Voice, Alexandros Panayi and Christina Argyri, had also both participated in Eurovision before, with Panayi having previously represented , while Argyri had been a backing performer at the same contest. A number of former participating artists also returned to perform as backing vocalists for some of the competing entries: , having previously represented alongside , returned to support the Icelandic duo August and Telma as a backing singer; Albano Carrisi, who twice represented and with Romina Power as Al Bano and Romina Power, supported Switzerland&#x27;s Jane Bogaert on stage; and Gabriel Forss, a member of the group Blond that represented , was a backing singer for Malta&#x27;s Claudette Pace in this year&#x27;s event. Additionally, Eamonn Toal competed for Ireland in this year&#x27;s contest, having previously served as backing vocalist for .


===Qualification===
Due to the high number of countries wishing to enter the contest, a relegation system was introduced in in order to reduce the number of countries which could compete in each year&#x27;s contest. Any relegated countries would be able to return the following year, thus allowing all countries the opportunity to compete in at least one in every two editions. The relegation rules introduced for the 1997 contest were again utilised ahead of the 2000 contest, based on each country&#x27;s average points total in previous contests. However the rules were modified for 2000 to ensure that the four participating countries which provide the largest financial contribution towards the organisation of the contest would be given an automatic place in the contest every year. This groupcomprising , , and the was subsequently dubbed the &quot;Big Four&quot; group of countries. Alongside the previous year&#x27;s winning country and the Big Four, the remaining places in the 2000 contest were given to any eligible countries which had not competed in the 1999 contest, and the countries which had competed in 1999 that had obtained the highest average points total over the preceding five contests. In cases where the average was identical between two or more countries, the total number of points scored in the most recent contest determined the final order.

, , , and were therefore excluded from participating in the 2000 contest, to make way for the return of Finland, Macedonia, Romania, Russia and Switzerland, and debuting country Latvia. Broadcasters in , , and , participating countries from the which had not competed in 1999, and were therefore eligible to participate in 2000, decided not to enter, reportedly due to financial reasons.

The calculations used to determine the countries relegated for the 2000 contest are outlined in the table below.

== Production ==

The Eurovision Song Contest 2000 was produced SVT; Svante Stockselius served as executive producer, Peter Lundin served as producer, Marius Bratten served as director, and Mikael Varhelyi and Kristofer Röhr served as designers. On behalf of the contest organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the event was overseen by Christine Marchal-Ortiz as scrutineer. The contest was presented by the journalist Kattis Ahlström and the television presenter Anders Lundin.

The graphic design, including the contest&#x27;s logo, scoreboard, on-screen overlays and postcards, was developed by Stockholm Design Lab. The chosen logo, presented publicly in early 2000, was a pair of open lips, and described as &quot;a sensual, yet stylistically pure, mouth representing song, dialogue and speech&quot; by its designers; ahead of the this logo was also considered by contest organisers when developing the contest&#x27;s new generic logo for that edition. The logo also featured prominently as part of the set design; the outline of the mouth featured on a display next to the stage and was filled with a distorted form of each country&#x27;s national flag as their entry was performed. The 2000 contest was the first to incorporate LED display technology within the set design, with five LED pillars featuring on stage during each performance and displaying images designed to complement each song&#x27;s theme or presentation and producing a unique backdrop to each performance.

A compilation album featuring all 24 competing entries was released within Europe ahead of the contest, through the German record labels Ariola and BMG. This was the first time an official album had been commissioned by the organisers and followed a previous attempt at an album for the 1999 contest which failed to contain all entries in that year&#x27;s contest due to copyright issues.

== Format ==
=== Entries ===
Each participating broadcaster was represented by one song, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country&#x27;s performance and all performers were required to be at least 16 years old in the year the contest was held. Selected entries were not permitted to be released commercially before 1 January 2000, and were then only allowed to be released in the country they represented until after the contest was held (except as part of a compilation album of all participating songs). The final submission date for all selected entries to be received by the contest organisers was set for 10 March. This submission was required to include a sound recording of the entry and backing track for use during the contest, a video presentation of the song on stage being performed by the artists, and the text of the song lyrics in its original language and translations in French and English for distribution to the participating broadcasters, their commentators and juries. Selected performers were required to be available from 7 May, with a staggered timetable for rehearsals in the contest venue to be developed by the organisers.

Following the confirmation of the 24 competing countries, the draw to determine the running order was held in Stockholm on 21 November 1999.

=== Voting procedure ===

The results of the 2000 contest were determined using the scoring system introduced in : each country awarded twelve points to its favourite entry, followed by ten points to its second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to one for the remaining songs which featured in the country&#x27;s top ten, with countries unable to vote for their own entry. Each participating broadcaster was required to use televoting to determine their points, with viewers able to register their vote by telephone for a total of five minutes following the performance of the last competing entry. Viewers could vote by calling one of twenty-three different telephone numbers to represent the twenty-four competing entries except that which represented their own country. Once phone lines were opened a video recap containing short clips of each competing entry with the accompanying phone number for voting was shown in order to aid viewers during the voting window, with each household able to vote a maximum of three times. Systems were also put in place to prevent lobby groups from one country voting for their entry by travelling to other countries.

Participating broadcasters which were unable to hold a televote in its country due to technological limitations could be granted an exception and their points would then be determined by a jury. Those conducting a televote were also required to assemble a jury, the votes of which could be used in case of a technical failure which prevented the televoting results from being rendered unusable. Each jury was composed of eight individuals, which was required to be split evenly between members of the public and music professionals, comprised additionally of an equal number of men and women, and below and above 30 years of age. Each jury member voted in secret and awarded between one and ten votes to each participating song, excluding that from their own country and with no abstentions permitted. The votes of each member were collected immediately following the country&#x27;s performance and then tallied by the non-voting jury chairperson to determine the points to be awarded. In any cases where two or more songs received the same number of votes, a show of hands by all jury members was used to determine the final placing; if a tie still remained, the youngest jury member would have the deciding vote. All juries were based in their own countries and followed the contest through television, seeing the performances just as the public watching at home would. Juries watched not only the contest itself on 13 May 2000 but also the final dress rehearsal, which was held on the same day and produced under the exact same conditions as the actual contest. In order to maintain the integrity of the vote, reception of the contest to the juries was severed during the announcement of the results until after the points for their country had been announced; the points to be awarded from the last five countries in the voting order were also required to be sent ahead of time via fax to the contest organisers.

=== Postcards ===
Each entry was preceded by a video postcard which served as an introduction to that country, as well as providing an opportunity to showcase the running artistic theme of the event and to create a transition between entries to allow stage crew to make changes on stage. The postcards for the 2000 contest focussed on different aspects of life in Sweden; central to each country&#x27;s postcard was a specific concept, e.g. an object or person, from that country which can be found in everyday Swedish life. The exception to this was the postcard for the Swedish entry, which showed a group of workers at Expo 2000 in Hannover, Germany.

== Contest overview ==
The contest took place on 13 May 2000 at 21:00 (CEST) and lasted 3 hours and 2 minutes.

The show began with a video montage, comprising various scenes of contemporary Sweden overlayed with the shadow of a human mouth, representing the contest logo, reciting the names of the 24 participating countries in English in the order in which they would perform. The montage finished with a night-time aerial shot of the Globe Arena, followed by live transmission from inside the arena, where violinist Caroline Lundgren, dressed in traditional Swedish folk costume, exclaimed &quot;Welcome Europe!&quot; This was followed by a welcome from the presenters of the contest, Kattis Ahlström and Anders Lundin, in various languages of the participating countries. The interval act, &quot;Once Upon a Time Europe Was Covered with Ice&quot;, mixed pre-recorded elements from various musicians and people from across Europe with live performances within the Globe Arena, and was composed and edited by Johan Söderberg and produced by John Nordling. The performance within the Globe Arena featured Lundgren on violin, the Strängnäs Drum Corps, street musicians and performers from Stockholm, and the .

The winner was represented by the song &quot;Fly on the Wings of Love&quot;, written by Jørgen Olsen and performed by the Olsen Brothers. This marked Denmark&#x27;s second contest win, thirty-seven years after their first victory in . and achieved their best-ever results, finishing second and fourth respectively, while achieved one of the strongest ever début performances in the contest&#x27;s history with a third-place finish. Denmark&#x27;s win was considered by some to be a surprise, as the song was not among the pre-contest favourites of fans or bookmakers, both of which had highly tipped Estonia for the win; however the Danish song ultimately received the third-highest points total yet seen at Eurovision and would go on to success across European charts in the weeks following the contest. Following the contest, the Russian delegation petitioned for Denmark to be disqualified due to the use of a vocoder during a brief moment of the performance to add an electronic sound to the vocals; the petition was ultimately rejected by the EBU.

The Israeli entry, &quot;&quot; by the group PingPong, caused some controversy in the lead-up to the contest. The music video for the song, released the month before the contest, featured same-sex kissing amongst the band members, singing into cucumbers, and other suggestive scenes with phallic imagery, which caused consternation with Israeli religious leaders and right-wing groups. The performance of the song, about an Israeli woman having a love affair with a man from Damascus, also saw the group waving both Israeli and Syrian flags in a call for peace between the two nations. However the participating Israeli broadcaster IBA raised objections during rehearsals, and subsequently disavowed its entry from the contest after the group refused to remove the Syrian flags from their performance; although the broadcaster did not prevent the group from performing in the contest, it was reported that the broadcaster had pulled funding for the group entirely.

The table below outlines the participating countries, the order in which they performed, the competing artists and songs, and the results of the voting.

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing, in English or French, the votes for its respective country.

== Detailed voting results ==

All countries were expected to use televoting to determine the points awarded by all countries, unless technological limitations in a country prevented a televote being held to a high standard, or where exceptional circumstances prevented a televote from being held. Jury voting was used in Russia due to an underdeveloped telephone system in the country. The Netherlands and Latvia had originally planned to use televoting to determine their points, however the votes of their back-up juries were used instead. In the Netherlands, due to the Enschede fireworks disaster the broadcast of the contest was suspended partway through and thus a televote could not be held, while in Latvia televoting lines were overloaded resulting in viewers unable to vote and leaving organisers unable to accurately determine a valid result.

The announcement of the results from each country was conducted in the order in which they performed, with the spokespersons announcing their country&#x27;s points in English or French in ascending order. The detailed breakdown of the points awarded by each country is listed in the tables below.

=== 12 points ===
The below table summarises how the maximum 12 points were awarded from one country to another. The winning country is shown in bold. Denmark received the maximum score of 12 points from eight countries, with Latvia and Russia receiving four sets of 12 points each, Germany receiving three sets, Turkey receiving two, and Iceland, Romania and Sweden each receiving one maximum score.

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay live and in full the contest via television. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;; any passive countries wishing to participate in the following year&#x27;s event were also required to provide a live broadcast of the contest or a deferred broadcast within 24 hours. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their viewers. These commentators were typically sent to the venue to report on the event, and were able to provide commentary from small booths constructed at the back of the venue.

In addition to the broadcasts by EBU members, the contest was also available on the internet for the first time in its history. Sponsored by Microsoft, a webcast of the contest was available on 18 European MSN sites as well as in the United States, Canada and Australia.

Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators, are shown in the tables below.



==Other awards==
The Barbara Dex Award, created in 1997 by fansite House of Eurovision, was awarded to the performer deemed to have been the &quot;worst dressed&quot; among the participants. The winner in 2000 was Belgium&#x27;s representative Nathalie Sorce, as determined by visitors to the House of Eurovision website

<doc id="199075" wikidata="Q890021" url="?curid=199075" title="List of kings of Dál Riata">
<text>This is a list of the kings of [[Dál Riata]], a kingdom of Irish origin which was located in Scotland and Ireland. Most kings of Dál Riata, along with later rulers of Alba and of Scotland, traced their descent from Fergus Mór mac Eirc, and even in the 16th century, James VI of Scotland called himself the &quot;happie monarch sprung of Ferguse race&quot;.

==Background==
It is not until the middle of the 6th century that Irish annals plausibly report the deaths of kings of Dál Riata, with the death of Comgall mac Domangairt, c. 538–545, and of his brother Gabrán, c. 558–560. After the disastrous Battle of Moira (Mag Rath) in 637, Irish Dál Riata lost possession of its Scottish lands. During the 8th century, the rival Dál nAraidi had overrun Irish Dál Riata, though the area retained its name well into the 14th century.

The last attested king of Scottish Dál Riata is Fergus mac Echdach, brother of and successor to Áed Find, whose death is reported in the Annals of Ulster in 781. Dál Riata was divided into a number of kingroups or dynasties, called &quot;cenéla&quot;, among which was the Cenél nGabráin of Kintyre, who claimed descent from Gabrán mac Domangairt, and the Cenél Loairn, who claimed descent from Loarn mac Eirc. While the Irish origin of the Kings of Dál Riata is unquestionable, the links to the Irish nobility were likely exaggerated in later centuries to claim foundership of the kingdom in an effort to add legitimacy to the dynasties.

==Kings of Dál Riata==
===Kings before the Battle of Mag Rath===
===Kings from Mag Rath to 741===
===Kings from the 740s onwards===
==Sources==
The main sources for the kings of Dál Riata include:
*The Annals of Ulster
*The Annals of Tigernach
*The Senchus Fer n-Alban
*The Synchronisms of Flann Mainistrech of Monasterboice
*The Duan Albanach
*Adomnán of Iona&#x27;s &quot;Life of Saint Columba&quot;
*A variety of genealogies for later kings of Alba

Less reliable sources may include:
*The Annals of Innisfallen
*The Chronicon Scotorum
*The Annals of the Four Masters
*The Annals of Clonmacnoise

Interpretation of these sources remains problematic. Many entries which appear to refer to Dál Riata lack context, many persons named lack patronyms or other identifying bynames. There are many disagreements among sources. Some entries have been amended and expanded at a later time.

<doc id="199077" wikidata="Q207712" url="?curid=199077" title="Period 2 element">
<text>A period 2 element is one of the chemical elements in the second row (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical elements. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate recurring (periodic) trends in the chemical behavior of the elements as their atomic number increases; a new row is started when chemical behavior begins to repeat, creating columns of elements with similar properties.

The second period contains the elements lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and neon. In a quantum mechanical description of atomic structure, this period corresponds to the filling of the second () shell, more specifically its 2s and 2p subshells. Period 2 elements (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine and neon) obey the octet rule in that they need eight electrons to complete their valence shell (lithium and beryllium obey duet rule, boron is electron deficient.), where at most eight electrons can be accommodated: two in the 2s orbital and six in the 2p subshell.

==Periodic trends==

Period 2 is the first period in the periodic table from which periodic trends can be drawn. Period 1, which only contains two elements (hydrogen and helium), is too small to draw any conclusive trends from it, especially because the two elements behave nothing like other s-block elements. Period 2 has much more conclusive trends. For all elements in period 2, as the atomic number increases, the atomic radius of the elements decreases, the electronegativity increases, and the ionization energy increases.

Period 2 only has two metals (lithium and beryllium) of eight elements, less than for any subsequent period both by number and by proportion. It also has the most number of nonmetals, namely five, among all periods. The elements in period 2 often have the most extreme properties in their respective groups; for example, fluorine is the most reactive halogen, neon is the most inert noble gas, and lithium is the least reactive alkali metal.

All period 2 elements completely obey the Madelung rule; in period 2, lithium and beryllium fill the 2s subshell, and boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and neon fill the 2p subshell. The period shares this trait with periods 1 and 3, none of which contain transition elements or inner transition elements, which often vary from the rule.

===Lithium===

Lithium (Li) is an alkali metal with atomic number 3, occurring naturally in two isotopes: 6Li and 7Li. The two make up all natural occurrence of lithium on Earth, although further isotopes have been synthesized. In ionic compounds, lithium loses an electron to become positively charged, forming the cation Li+. Lithium is the first alkali metal in the periodic table, and the first metal of any kind in the periodic table. At standard temperature and pressure, lithium is a soft, silver-white, highly reactive metal. With a density of 0.564 g⋅cm−3, lithium is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element.

Lithium is one of the few elements synthesized in the Big Bang.
Lithium is the 31st most abundant element on earth, occurring in concentrations of between 20 and 70 ppm by weight, but due to its high reactivity it is only found naturally in compounds.

Lithium salts are used in the pharmacology industry as mood stabilising drugs. They are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, where they have a role in treating depression and mania and may reduce the chances of suicide. The most common compounds used are lithium carbonate, Li2CO3, lithium citrate, Li3C6H5O7, lithium sulphate, Li2SO4, and lithium orotate, LiC5H3N2O4·H2O. Lithium is also used in batteries as an anode and its alloys with aluminium, cadmium, copper and manganese are used to make high performance parts for aircraft, most notably the external tank of the Space Shuttle.

===Beryllium===

Beryllium (Be) is the chemical element with atomic number 4, occurring in the form of 9Be. At standard temperature and pressure, beryllium is a strong, steel-grey, light-weight, brittle, bivalent alkaline earth metal, with a density of 1.85 g⋅cm−3. It also has one of the highest melting points of all the light metals. Beryllium&#x27;s most common isotope is 9Be, which contains 4 protons and 5 neutrons. It makes up almost 100% of all naturally occurring beryllium and is its only stable isotope; however other isotopes have been synthesised. In ionic compounds, beryllium loses its two valence electrons to form the cation, Be2+.

Small amounts of beryllium were synthesised during the Big Bang, although most of it decayed or reacted further to create larger nuclei, like carbon, nitrogen or oxygen. Beryllium is a component of 100 out of 4000 known minerals, such as bertrandite, Be4Si2O7(OH)2, beryl, Al2Be3Si6O18, chrysoberyl, Al2BeO4, and phenakite, Be2SiO4. Precious forms of beryl are aquamarine, red beryl and emerald. The most common sources of beryllium used commercially are beryl and bertrandite and production of it involves the reduction of beryllium fluoride with magnesium metal or the electrolysis of molten beryllium chloride, containing some sodium chloride as beryllium chloride is a poor conductor of electricity.

Due to its stiffness, light weight, and dimensional stability over a wide temperature range, beryllium metal is used in as a structural material in aircraft, missiles and communication satellites. It is used as an alloying agent in beryllium copper, which is used to make electrical components due to its high electrical and heat conductivity. Sheets of beryllium are used in X-ray detectors to filter out visible light and let only X-rays through. It is used as a neutron moderator in nuclear reactors because light nuclei are more effective at slowing down neutrons than heavy nuclei. Beryllium&#x27;s low weight and high rigidity also make it useful in the construction of tweeters in loudspeakers.

Beryllium and beryllium compounds are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as Group 1 carcinogens; they are carcinogenic to both animals and humans. Chronic berylliosis is a pulmonary and systemic granulomatous disease caused by exposure to beryllium. Between 1% – 15% of people are sensitive to beryllium and may develop an inflammatory reaction in their respiratory system and skin, called chronic beryllium disease or berylliosis. The body&#x27;s immune system recognises the beryllium as foreign particles and mounts an attack against them, usually in the lungs where they are breathed in. This can cause fever, fatigue, weakness, night sweats and difficulty in breathing.

===Boron===

Boron (B) is the chemical element with atomic number 5, occurring as 10B and 11B. At standard temperature and pressure, boron is a trivalent metalloid that has several different allotropes. Amorphous boron is a brown powder formed as a product of many chemical reactions. Crystalline boron is a very hard, black material with a high melting point and exists in many polymorphs: Two rhombohedral forms, α-boron and β-boron containing 12 and 106.7 atoms in the rhombohedral unit cell respectively, and 50-atom tetragonal boron are the most common. Boron has a density of 2.34−3. Boron&#x27;s most common isotope is 11B at 80.22%, which contains 5 protons and 6 neutrons. The other common isotope is 10B at 19.78%, which contains 5 protons and 5 neutrons. These are the only stable isotopes of boron; however other isotopes have been synthesised. Boron forms covalent bonds with other nonmetals and has oxidation states of 1, 2, 3 and 4.
Boron does not occur naturally as a free element, but in compounds such as borates. The most common sources of boron are tourmaline, borax, Na2B4O5(OH)4·8H2O, and kernite, Na2B4O5(OH)4·2H2O. it is difficult to obtain pure boron. It can be made through the magnesium reduction of boron trioxide, B2O3. This oxide is made by melting boric acid, B(OH)3, which in turn is obtained from borax. Small amounts of pure boron can be made by the thermal decomposition of boron bromide, BBr3, in hydrogen gas over hot tantalum wire, which acts as a catalyst. The most commercially important sources of boron are: sodium tetraborate pentahydrate, Na2B4O7 · 5H2O, which is used in large amounts in making insulating fiberglass and sodium perborate bleach; boron carbide, a ceramic material, is used to make armour materials, especially in bulletproof vests for soldiers and police officers; orthoboric acid, H3BO3 or boric acid, used in the production of textile fiberglass and flat panel displays; sodium tetraborate decahydrate, Na2B4O7 · 10H2O or borax, used in the production of adhesives; and the isotope boron-10 is used as a control for nuclear reactors, as a shield for nuclear radiation, and in instruments used for detecting neutrons.

Boron is an essential plant micronutrient, required for cell wall strength and development, cell division, seed and fruit development, sugar transport and hormone development. However, high soil concentrations of over 1.0 ppm can cause necrosis in leaves and poor growth. Levels as low as 0.8 ppm can cause these symptoms to appear in plants particularly boron-sensitive. Most plants, even those tolerant of boron in the soil, will show symptoms of boron toxicity when boron levels are higher than 1.8 ppm. In animals, boron is an ultratrace element; in human diets, daily intake ranges from 2.1 to 4.3 mg boron/kg body weight (bw)/day. It is also used as a supplement for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and arthritis.

===Carbon===

Carbon is the chemical element with atomic number 6, occurring as 12C, 13C and 14C. At standard temperature and pressure, carbon is a solid, occurring in many different allotropes, the most common of which are graphite, diamond, the fullerenes and amorphous carbon. Graphite is a soft, hexagonal crystalline, opaque black semimetal with very good conductive and thermodynamically stable properties. Diamond however is a highly transparent colourless cubic crystal with poor conductive properties, is the hardest known naturally occurring mineral and has the highest refractive index of all gemstones. In contrast to the crystal lattice structure of diamond and graphite, the fullerenes are molecules, named after Richard Buckminster Fuller whose architecture the molecules resemble. There are several different fullerenes, the most widely known being the &quot;buckeyball&quot; C60. Little is known about the fullerenes and they are a current subject of research. There is also amorphous carbon, which is carbon without any crystalline structure. In mineralogy, the term is used to refer to soot and coal, although these are not truly amorphous as they contain small amounts of graphite or diamond. Carbon&#x27;s most common isotope at 98.9% is 12C, with six protons and six neutrons. 13C is also stable, with six protons and seven neutrons, at 1.1%. Trace amounts of 14C also occur naturally but this isotope is radioactive and decays with a half life of 5730 years; it is used for radiocarbon dating. Other isotopes of carbon have also been synthesised. Carbon forms covalent bonds with other non-metals with an oxidation state of −4, −2, +2 or +4.

Carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium and oxygen and is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass after oxygen, the third most abundant by number of atoms. There are an almost infinite number of compounds that contain carbon due to carbon&#x27;s ability to form long stable chains of C — C bonds. The simplest carbon-containing molecules are the hydrocarbons, which contain carbon and hydrogen, although they sometimes contain other elements in functional groups. Hydrocarbons are used as fossil fuels and to manufacture plastics and petrochemicals. All organic compounds, those essential for life, contain at least one atom of carbon. When combined with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including sugars, lignans, chitins, alcohols, fats, and aromatic esters, carotenoids and terpenes. With nitrogen it forms alkaloids, and with the addition of sulfur also it forms antibiotics, amino acids, and rubber products. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms DNA and RNA, the chemical-code carriers of life, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the most important energy-transfer molecule in all living cells.

===Nitrogen===

Nitrogen is the chemical element with atomic number 7, the symbol N and atomic mass 14.00674 u. Elemental nitrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless and mostly inert diatomic gas at standard conditions, constituting 78.08% by volume of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The element nitrogen was discovered as a separable component of air, by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford, in 1772. It occurs naturally in form of two isotopes: nitrogen-14 and nitrogen-15.

Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong bond in elemental nitrogen dominates nitrogen chemistry, causing difficulty for both organisms and industry in breaking the bond to convert the molecule into useful compounds, but at the same time causing release of large amounts of often useful energy when the compounds burn, explode, or decay back into nitrogen gas.

Nitrogen occurs in all living organisms, and the nitrogen cycle describes movement of the element from air into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere. Synthetically produced nitrates are key ingredients of industrial fertilizers, and also key pollutants in causing the eutrophication of water systems. Nitrogen is a constituent element of amino acids and thus of proteins, and of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). It resides in the chemical structure of almost all neurotransmitters, and is a defining component of alkaloids, biological molecules produced by many organisms.

===Oxygen===
Oxygen is the chemical element with atomic number 8, occurring mostly as 16O, but also 17O and 18O.

Oxygen is the third-most common element by mass in the universe (although there are more carbon atoms, each carbon atom is lighter). It is highly electronegative and non-metallic, usually diatomic, gas down to very low temperatures. Only fluorine is more reactive among non-metallic elements. It is two electrons short of a full octet and readily takes electrons from other elements. It reacts violently with alkali metals and white phosphorus at room temperature and less violently with alkali earth metals heavier than magnesium. At higher temperatures it burns most other metals and many non-metals (including hydrogen, carbon, and sulfur). Many oxides are extremely stable substances difficult to decompose—like water, carbon dioxide, alumina, silica, and iron oxides (the latter often appearing as rust). Oxygen is part of substances best described as some salts of metals and oxygen-containing acids (thus nitrates, sulfates, phosphates, silicates, and carbonates.

Oxygen is essential to all life. Plants and phytoplankton photosynthesize water and carbon dioxide and water, both oxides, in the presence of sunlight to form sugars with the release of oxygen. The sugars are then turned into such substances as cellulose and (with nitrogen and often sulfur) proteins and other essential substances of life. Animals especially but also fungi and bacteria ultimately depend upon photosynthesizing plants and phytoplankton for food and oxygen.

Fire uses oxygen to oxidize compounds typically of carbon and hydrogen to water and carbon dioxide (although other elements may be involved) whether in uncontrolled conflagrations that destroy buildings and forests or the controlled fire within engines or that supply electrical energy from turbines, heat for keeping buildings warm, or the motive force that drives vehicles.

Oxygen forms roughly 21% of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere; all of this oxygen is the result of photosynthesis. Pure oxygen has use in medical treatment of people who have respiratory difficulties. Excess oxygen is toxic.

Oxygen was originally associated with the formation of acids—until some acids were shown to not have oxygen in them. Oxygen is named for its formation of acids, especially with non-metals. Some oxides of some non-metals are extremely acidic, like sulfur trioxide, which forms sulfuric acid on contact with water. Most oxides with metals are alkaline, some extremely so, like potassium oxide. Some metallic oxides are amphoteric, like aluminum oxide, which means that they can react with both acids and bases.

Although oxygen is normally a diatomic gas, oxygen can form an allotrope known as ozone. Ozone is a triatomic gas even more reactive than oxygen. Unlike regular diatomic oxygen, ozone is a toxic material generally considered a pollutant. In the upper atmosphere, some oxygen forms ozone which has the property of absorbing dangerous ultraviolet rays within the ozone layer. Land life was impossible before the formation of an ozone layer.

===Fluorine===

Fluorine is the chemical element with atomic number 9. It occurs naturally in its only stable form 19F.

Fluorine is a pale-yellow, diatomic gas under normal conditions and down to very low temperatures. Short one electron of the highly stable octet in each atom, fluorine molecules are unstable enough that they easily snap, with loose fluorine atoms tending to grab single electrons from just about any other element. Fluorine is the most reactive of all elements, and it even attacks many oxides to replace oxygen with fluorine. Fluorine even attacks silica, one of the favored materials for transporting strong acids, and burns asbestos. It attacks common salt, one of the most stable compounds, with the release of chlorine. It never appears uncombined in nature and almost never stays uncombined for long. It burns hydrogen simultaneously if either is liquid or gaseous—even at temperatures close to absolute zero. It is extremely difficult to isolate from any compounds, let alone keep uncombined.

Fluorine gas is extremely dangerous because it attacks almost all organic material, including live flesh. Many of the binary compounds that it forms (called fluorides) are themselves highly toxic, including soluble fluorides and especially hydrogen fluoride. Fluorine forms very strong bonds with many elements. With sulfur it can form the extremely stable and chemically inert sulfur hexafluoride; with carbon it can form the remarkable material Teflon that is a stable and non-combustible solid with a high melting point and a very low coefficient of friction that makes it an excellent liner for cooking pans and raincoats. Fluorine-carbon compounds include some unique plastics.
it is also used as a reactant in the making of toothpaste.

===Neon===


Neon is the chemical element with atomic number 10, occurring as 20Ne, 21Ne and 22Ne.

Neon is a monatomic gas. With a complete octet of outer electrons it is highly resistant to removal of any electron, and it cannot accept an electron from anything. Neon has no tendency to form any normal compounds under normal temperatures and pressures; it is effectively inert. It is one of the so-called &quot;noble gases&quot;.

Neon is a trace component of the atmosphere without any biological role.

<text>The president of the Republic of Korea serves as the chief executive of the government of the Republic of Korea and the commander-in-chief of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces.

The South Korean government constitutionally considers the Korean Provisional Government (KPG) to be its predecessor. The KPG was established in 1919 as a government in exile in Shanghai during the Japanese occupation of Korea. It had nine different heads of state between September 1919 and August 1948.

Under the 1988 Constitution of the Sixth Republic of Korea, the presidential term is set at five years with no re-election. The president must be a South Korean citizen, at least 40 years old, who has lived in South Korea for 5 years. The term was previously set at four years during the First Republic from 1948 to 1960, including a two-term limit that was repealed in 1954. The presidency was changed into a ceremonial role elected by legislators to five-year terms during the Second Republic from 1960 to 1963. The Third Republic returned the presidency to a directly-elected position with a four-year term in 1963 and repealed the two-term limit in 1969. Under the Yushin Constitution of the Fourth Republic adopted in 1972, the presidency became an indirectly elected position with six-year terms and no limits to re-election. It was replaced with a seven-year term under the Fifth Republic in 1981, which retained the indirect elections but prohibited a second term.

, thirteen people have served in full capacity as president of South Korea since the office was formally established on 24 July 1948, when Syngman Rhee took office after being elected by the Constituent National Assembly. The longest-serving president is Park Chung Hee, who held the office for 18 years from a 1961 coup until his assassination in 1979 following a period of authoritarian rule. The first and only woman to hold the presidency was his daughter Park Geun-hye, who was elected in 2012 and removed from office in 2017 after her impeachment was upheld by the Constitutional Court of Korea. Yoon Suk Yeol assumed office on 10 May 2022 and was impeached by the National Assembly on 14 December 2024. His powers will remain suspended until a Constitutional Court decision upholds or rejects the impeachment; until then, the prime minister served as acting president. The prime minister, Han Duck-soo, was himself impeached from the acting presidency on 27 December 2024 and replaced by deputy prime minister Choi Sang-mok, who became acting president.

<text>A period 1 element is one of the chemical elements in the first row (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical elements. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate periodic (recurring) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that analog elements fall into the same vertical columns. The first period contains fewer elements than any other row in the table, with only two: hydrogen and helium. This situation can be explained by modern theories of atomic structure. In a quantum mechanical description of atomic structure, this period corresponds to the filling of the 1s orbital. Period 1 elements obey the duet rule in that they need two electrons to complete their valence shell.

Hydrogen and helium are the oldest and the most abundant elements in the universe.

==Periodic trends==
All other periods in the periodic table contain at least eight elements, and it is often helpful to consider periodic trends across the period. However, period 1 contains only two elements, so this concept does not apply here.

In terms of vertical trends down groups, helium can be seen as a typical noble gas at the head of the IUPAC group 18, but as discussed below, hydrogen&#x27;s chemistry is unique and it is not easily assigned to any group.

==Position of period 1 elements in the periodic table==
The first electron shell, , consists of only one orbital, and the maximum number of valence electrons that a period 1 element can accommodate is two, both in the 1s orbital. The valence shell lacks &quot;p&quot; or any other kind of orbitals due to the general constraint on the quantum numbers. Therefore, period 1 has exactly two elements.
Although both hydrogen and helium are in the s-block, neither of them behaves similarly to other s-block elements. Their behaviour is so different from the other s-block elements that there is considerable disagreement over where these two elements should be placed in the periodic table.

Simply following electron configurations, hydrogen (electronic configuration 1s1) and helium (1s2) should be placed in groups 1 and 2, above lithium (1s22s1) and beryllium (1s22s2). While such a placement is common for hydrogen, it is rarely used for helium outside of the context of illustrating the electron configurations. Usually, hydrogen is placed in group 1, and helium in group 18: this is the placement found on the IUPAC periodic table. Some variation can be found on both these matters.

Like the group 1 metals, hydrogen has one electron in its outermost shell and typically loses its only electron in chemical reactions. It has some metal-like chemical properties, being able to displace some metals from their salts. But hydrogen forms a diatomic nonmetallic gas at standard conditions, unlike the alkali metals which are reactive solid metals. This and hydrogen&#x27;s formation of hydrides, in which it gains an electron, brings it close to the properties of the halogens which do the same (though it is rarer for hydrogen to form H− than H+). Moreover, the lightest two halogens (fluorine and chlorine) are gaseous like hydrogen at standard conditions. Some properties of hydrogen are not a good fit for either group: hydrogen is neither highly oxidising nor highly reducing and is not reactive with water. Hydrogen thus has properties corresponding to both those of the alkali metals and the halogens, but matches neither group perfectly, and is thus difficult to place by its chemistry. Therefore, while the electronic placement of hydrogen in group 1 predominates, some rarer arrangements show either hydrogen in group 17, duplicate hydrogen in both groups 1 and 17, or float it separately from all groups. The possibility of &quot;floating&quot; hydrogen has nonetheless been criticised by Eric Scerri, who points out that removing it from all groups suggests that it is being excluded from the periodic law, when all elements should be subject to that law. A few authors have advocated more unusual placements for hydrogen, such as group 13 or group 14, on the grounds of trends in ionisation energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity.

Helium is an unreactive noble gas at standard conditions, and has a full outer shell: these properties are like the noble gases in group 18, but not at all like the reactive alkaline earth metals of group 2. Therefore, helium is nearly universally placed in group 18 which its properties best match. However, helium only has two outer electrons in its outer shell, whereas the other noble gases have eight; and it is an s-block element, whereas all other noble gases are p-block elements. Also, solid helium crystallises in a hexagonal close-packed structure, which matches beryllium and magnesium in group 2, but not the other noble gases in group 18. In these ways helium better matches the alkaline earth metals. Therefore, tables with both hydrogen and helium floating outside all groups may rarely be encountered.

A few chemists, such as Henry Bent, have advocated that the electronic placement in group 2 be adopted for helium. This assignment is also found in Charles Janet&#x27;s left-step table. Arguments for this often rest on the first-row anomaly trend (s » p &gt; d &gt; f), which states that the first element of each group often behaves quite differently from the succeeding ones: the difference is largest in the s-block (H and He), is moderate for the p-block (B to Ne), and is less pronounced for the d- and f-blocks. Thus helium as the first s2 element before the alkaline earth metals stands out as anomalous in a way that helium as the first noble gas does not. The normalized ionization potentials and electron affinities show better trends with helium in group 2 than in group 18; helium is expected to be slightly more reactive than neon (which breaks the general trend of reactivity in the noble gases, where the heavier ones are more reactive); and predicted helium compounds often lack neon analogues even theoretically, but sometimes have beryllium analogues.

==Elements==
===Hydrogen===


Hydrogen (H) is the chemical element with atomic number 1. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, nonmetallic, tasteless, highly flammable diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. With an atomic mass of 1.00794 amu, hydrogen is the lightest element.

Hydrogen is the most abundant of the chemical elements, constituting roughly 75% of the universe&#x27;s elemental mass. Stars in the main sequence are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state. Elemental hydrogen is relatively rare on Earth, and is industrially produced from hydrocarbons such as methane, after which most elemental hydrogen is used &quot;captively&quot; (meaning locally at the production site), with the largest markets almost equally divided between fossil fuel upgrading, such as hydrocracking, and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. Hydrogen may be produced from water using the process of electrolysis, but this process is significantly more expensive commercially than hydrogen production from natural gas.

The most common naturally occurring isotope of hydrogen, known as protium, has a single proton and no neutrons. In ionic compounds, it can take on either a positive charge, becoming a cation composed of a bare proton, or a negative charge, becoming an anion known as a hydride. Hydrogen can form compounds with most elements and is present in water and most organic compounds. It plays a particularly important role in acid-base chemistry, in which many reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and spectrum of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.

The interactions of hydrogen with various metals are very important in metallurgy, as many metals can suffer hydrogen embrittlement, and in developing safe ways to store it for use as a fuel. Hydrogen is highly soluble in many compounds composed of rare earth metals and transition metals and can be dissolved in both crystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the metal crystal lattice.

===Helium===

Helium (He) is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert monatomic chemical element that heads the noble gas series in the periodic table and whose atomic number is 2. Its boiling and melting points are the lowest among the elements and it exists only as a gas except in extreme conditions.

Helium was discovered in 1868 by French astronomer Pierre Janssen, who first detected the substance as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in light from a solar eclipse. In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in the natural gas fields of the United States, which is by far the largest supplier of the gas. The substance is used in cryogenics, in deep-sea breathing systems, to cool superconducting magnets, in helium dating, for inflating balloons, for providing lift in airships, and as a protective gas for industrial uses such as arc welding and growing silicon wafers. Inhaling a small volume of the gas temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. The behavior of liquid helium-4&#x27;s two fluid phases, helium I and helium II, is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics and the phenomenon of superfluidity in particular, and to those looking at the effects that temperatures near absolute zero have on matter, such as with superconductivity.

Helium is the second lightest element and is the second most abundant in the observable universe. Most helium was formed during the Big Bang, but new helium is being created as a result of the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars. On Earth, helium is relatively rare and is created by the natural decay of some radioactive elements because the alpha particles that are emitted consist of helium nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations of up to seven percent by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation.

<text>A period 7 element is one of the chemical elements in the seventh row (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical elements. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate recurring (periodic) trends in the chemical behavior of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behavior begins to repeat, meaning that elements with similar behavior fall into the same vertical columns. The seventh period contains 32 elements, tied for the most with period 6, beginning with francium and ending with oganesson, the heaviest element currently discovered. As a rule, period 7 elements fill their 7s shells first, then their 5f, 6d, and 7p shells in that order, but there are exceptions, such as uranium.

==Properties==

All period 7 elements are radioactive. This period contains the actinides, which include plutonium, the last naturally occurring element; subsequent elements must be created artificially. While the first five of these synthetic elements (americium through einsteinium) are now available in macroscopic quantities, most are extremely rare, having only been prepared in microgram amounts or less. The later transactinide elements have only been identified in laboratories in batches of a few atoms at a time.

Though the rarity of many of these elements means that experimental results are not many, their periodic and group trends are less well defined than other periods. Whilst francium and radium do show typical properties of their respective groups, actinides display a much greater variety of behavior and oxidation states than the lanthanides. These peculiarities are due to a variety of factors, including a large degree of spin–orbit coupling and relativistic effects, ultimately caused by the very high electric charge of their massive nuclei. Periodicity mostly holds throughout the 6d series and is predicted also for moscovium and livermorium, but the other four 7p elements, nihonium, flerovium, tennessine, and oganesson, are predicted to have very different properties from those expected for their groups.

==Elements==

(?) Prediction

(*) Exception to the Madelung rule.

In many periodic tables, the f-block is erroneously shifted one element to the right, so that lanthanum and actinium become d-block elements, and Ce–Lu and Th–Lr form the f-block tearing the d-block into two very uneven portions. This is a holdover from early erroneous measurements of electron configurations. Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz pointed out in 1948 that lutetium is not an f-block element, and since then physical, chemical, and electronic evidence has overwhelmingly supported that the f-block contains the elements La–Yb and Ac–No, as shown here and as supported by International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry reports dating from 1988 and 2021.

=== S-block ===

Francium and radium make up the s-block elements of the 7th period.

Francium (Fr, atomic number 87) is a highly radioactive metal that decays into astatine, radium, or radon. It is one of the two least electronegative elements; the other is caesium. As an alkali metal, it has one valence electron. Francium was discovered by Marguerite Perey in France (from which the element takes its name) in 1939. It was the last element discovered in nature, rather than by synthesis. Outside the laboratory, francium is extremely rare, with trace amounts found in uranium and thorium ores, where the isotope francium-223 continually forms and decays. As little as 20–30 g (one ounce) exists at any given time throughout Earth&#x27;s crust; the other isotopes are entirely synthetic. The largest amount produced in the laboratory was a cluster of more than 300,000 atoms.

Radium (Ra, atomic number 88) is an almost pure-white alkaline earth metal, but it readily oxidizes, reacting with nitrogen (rather than oxygen) on exposure to air, becoming black in color. All isotopes of radium are radioactive; the most stable is radium-226, which has a half-life of 1601 years and decays into radon. Due to such instability, radium luminesces, glowing a faint blue. Radium, in the form of radium chloride, was discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898. They extracted the radium compound from uraninite and published the discovery at the French Academy of Sciences five days later. Radium was isolated in its metallic state by Marie Curie and André-Louis Debierne through electrolysis of radium chloride in 1910. Since its discovery, it has given names such as radium A and radium C to several isotopes of other elements that are decay products of radium-226. In nature, radium is found in uranium ores in trace amounts as small as a seventh of a gram per ton of uraninite. Radium is not necessary for living things, and adverse health effects are likely when it is incorporated into biochemical processes due to its radioactivity and chemical reactivity.

=== Actinides ===
The actinide or actinoid (IUPAC nomenclature) series encompasses the 15 metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers from 89 to 103, actinium through lawrencium.

The actinide series is named after its first element actinium. All but one of the actinides are f-block elements, corresponding to the filling of the 5f electron shell; lawrencium, a d-block element, is also generally considered an actinide. In comparison with the lanthanides, also mostly f-block elements, the actinides show much more variable valence.

Of the actinides, thorium and uranium occur naturally in substantial, primordial, quantities. Radioactive decay of uranium produces transient amounts of actinium, protactinium and plutonium, and atoms of neptunium and plutonium are occasionally produced from transmutation in uranium ores. The other actinides are purely synthetic elements, though the first six actinides after plutonium would have been produced at Oklo (and long since decayed away), and curium almost certainly previously existed in nature as an extinct radionuclide. Nuclear tests have released at least six actinides heavier than plutonium into the environment; analysis of debris from a 1952 hydrogen bomb explosion showed the presence of americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium and fermium.

All actinides are radioactive and release energy upon radioactive decay; naturally occurring uranium and thorium, and synthetically produced plutonium are the most abundant actinides on Earth. These are used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Uranium and thorium also have diverse current or historical uses, and americium is used in the ionization chambers of most modern smoke detectors.

In presentations of the periodic table, the lanthanides and the actinides are customarily shown as two additional rows below the main body of the table, with placeholders or else a selected single element of each series (either lanthanum or lutetium, and either actinium or lawrencium, respectively) shown in a single cell of the main table, between barium and hafnium, and radium and rutherfordium, respectively. This convention is entirely a matter of aesthetics and formatting practicality; a rarely used wide-formatted periodic table (32 columns) shows the lanthanide and actinide series in their proper columns, as parts of the table&#x27;s sixth and seventh rows (periods).

=== Transactinides ===

&quot;Transactinide elements&quot; (also, transactinides, or super-heavy elements, or superheavies) are the chemical elements with atomic numbers greater than those of the actinides, the heaviest of which is lawrencium (103). All transactinides of period 7 have been discovered, up to oganesson (element 118).

Superheavies are also transuranic elements, that is, have atomic number greater than that of uranium (92). The further distinction of having an atomic number greater than the actinides is significant in several ways:
*The transactinide elements all have electrons in the 6d subshell in their ground state (and thus are placed in the d-block).
*Even the longest-lived known isotopes of many transactinides have extremely short half-lives, measured in seconds or smaller units.
*The element naming controversy involved the first five or six transactinides. These elements thus used three-letter systematic names for many years after their discovery was confirmed. (Usually, the three-letter symbols are replaced with two-letter symbols relatively soon after a discovery has been confirmed.)

Transactinides are radioactive and have only been obtained synthetically in laboratories. None of these elements has ever been collected in a macroscopic sample. Transactinides are all named after scientists, or important locations involved in the synthesis of the elements.

Chemistry Nobel Prize winner Glenn T. Seaborg, who first proposed the actinide concept which led to the acceptance of the actinide series, also proposed the existence of a transactinide series ranging from element 104 to 121 and a superactinide series approximately spanning elements 122 to 153. The transactinide seaborgium is named in his honor.

IUPAC defines an element to exist if its lifetime is longer than 10 second, the time needed to form an electron cloud.

<text>The 6th Division (6.Divisioona) was a unit of the Finnish Army during the Winter War. Finland lost territories in the 3½ month Winter War against the Soviets, November 1939 to March 1940. 

==History==

During the mobilization prior to the Winter War, the 6th Division was placed in the reserve of the Commander-in-Chief Gustaf Mannerheim. The division consisted of reservists mainly from Satakunta. On 19 December it was attached to the II Corps. The 6th and 1st Divisions were to attack the advancing Soviet forces near Summa. The attack began on 23 December but was a failure.

In the beginning of January 1940, the division&#x27;s name was changed to the 3rd Division. This was done in order to confuse the enemy, but it is uncertain if this had any effect.

In January 1940 the division replaced the 5th Division at the Summa front.

In February the Soviet forces began bombarding the front lines at Summa with artillery fire. On the morning of 11 February, the attack began along the whole front of the exhausted 3rd Division. The Soviets had concentrated nine divisions and five armoured brigades of the 7th Army at Summa. The Finnish lines broke on 13 February and the forces retreated to the Intermediate Line (&quot;Väliasema&quot;).

<doc id="199083" wikidata="Q2625571" url="?curid=199083" title="T-72 tanks in Iraqi service">
<text>During the early stages of the Iran-Iraq War, Iraq under the rule of Saddam Hussein imported a number of T-72 tanks from the Soviet Union and Poland. The tanks saw service in both the Gulf War and the Iraq War. In the late 1970s, Iraq also established a factory to retrofit and repair T-72s, and started the Lion of Babylon project (named after the Babylonian historical symbol of the same name) with the intent to assemble T-72s locally.

==History==
In the 1970s and 80s, Iraq purchased a hundred T-72 from the Soviet Union. Iraq utilized these tanks during the Iran-Iraq War, which temporarily put T-72 exports to Iraq to a halt. However, Poland started delivering T-72s in January of 1982, and in September of the same year, Soviet exports resumed as well. Overall, Iraq received about 1,038 T-72 tanks, primarily produced in Poland. Some of these were destroyed during the Iran–Iraq War, or captured by the Iranians. As of 1996, Iraq had 776 T-72 tanks in service.

Two years after the fall of Saddam Hussein, the new Iraqi Government acquired dozens of refitted T-72M1s from Hungary, in order to equip an armored brigade. The headquarters of this new Iraqi Army unit is located in Taji, where Iraq had attempted to assemble T-72s locally in the late 1980s. Some surviving T-72s are used for training, and the experience of Iraqi Army officers and crews with the T-72 was one of the reasons behind the choice of Hungarian T-72M1s.

==Combat history and performance==
T-72 tanks saw service in the 1991 Persian Gulf War as well as the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Like other tanks in the Iraqi inventory, T-72s were mainly employed as armored self-propelled artillery, rather than in maneuver warfare roles. In operations, it fared poorly against American main battle tanks and armored fighting vehicles. For example, a 120 mm depleted uranium (DU) APFSDS round from an M1 Abrams could knock out a T-72 tank well beyond 3,000 m, while the effective range of the APFSDS 125 mm shell used by Iraq was 1,800 m. The Iraqi T-72s used 3BM9 APFSDS shells (removed from Soviet service in 1973), with a penetration only 245 mm at a distance of up to .

The Iraqi T-72s, like most T-72 export versions, lacked then-modern night vision systems, though they did have some night fighting tanks with older active infrared systems or floodlights - just not the latest starlight scopes and passive infrared scopes as on the Abrams.

Within closer ranges, the T-72 was more effective, especially while within prepared positions. However, even in such conditions, the T-72 did not fare well against M1s—as proven in the Battle of Norfolk during Desert Storm, although the tank also participated in the Battle of Phase Line Bullet, where Bradley IFVs from the 4th squadron of the 7th Cavalry Regiment were driven back by dug-in Iraqi armoured vehicles at heavy cost.

Despite the relative thinness, a retrofitted reinforced armor plate present both at the turret and the front upper hull seems to have been relatively effective against some shaped-charge ordnance, like the TOWs and Hellfire missiles. There are reports of Iraqi T-72s surviving near-misses from these weapons, although the reinforced armor generally did not prevent a mobility kill. However, it is also possible that the unexpected survival rate was due to the electro-optical countermeasures mounted on most of the tanks rather than the added armor. There is evidence of at least one T-72 surviving a direct hit from an Abrams main gun in Mahmoudiyah in 2003. A 120 mm HEAT round from an Abrams impacted on the front of an &quot;Asad Babil&quot; turret at point blank range without producing a catastrophic kill. Some T-72 tanks may have featured explosive reactive armor, possibly obtained from Polish T-72M1 spare parts.

Another improvised armor upgrade may have also been added at the Taji complex. An additional 30 mm armor plate was welded on the front areas of the hull and turret, leaving an air gap matching the size of the armor, so that the power of a HEAT jet could be dissipated in the hollow space. This technique follows the principle of spaced armor. The Iraqi engineers tested this reinforcement against captured Iranian 120 mm Chieftain tank guns in 1989, apparently with some success.

===Iran-Iraq War===
Iraq deployed T-72s against Iranian forces during the Iran-Iraq War. The T-72s had success against Iranian 105mm M68 tank guns and TOW missiles, both of which were ineffective against the tank&#x27;s front armor. Overall, Iraq lost 60 T-72s during the war. Ra&#x27;ad Al-Hamdani, a general in the Iraqi Republican Guard, noted that the 10th Iraqi Armoured Brigade, which was equipped with T-72s, was able to destroy the 16th Iranian Armoured Division within twelve hours, despite Iran&#x27;s numerical superiority. The division included Chieftain tanks against which the T-72 proved effective; Iran started the war with 894 Chieftains, of which only about 200 were left by the end of it. The 3BM9 APFSDS round was more than enough to deal with any NATO tank of the time, including the most heavily armoured such as the M60A1 and the Chieftain. According to a Soviet analysis of an Iranian Chieftain captured by the Iraqi army during the early part of the Iran-Iraq war, the Chieftain Mk.5 was considered to have totally insufficient protection even at its strongest points. The frontal part of the entire turret, hull upper front plate and lower front plate could all be defeated at 3 km or more. This essentially means that the T-72 Ural could defeat one of NATO&#x27;s toughest tanks at any reasonable combat distance. According to both sides, the T-72 was the most feared tank of the war.

===Invasion of Kuwait===
Iraq deployed T-72s during the invasion of Kuwait alongside T-55s, T-62, and other models. Kuwaiti tanks, which also included T-72s, engaged Iraqi tanks at the Mutla Pass on August 2, 1990. Kuwaiti tanks knocked out one Iraqi T-72 during the fighting, but lost the overall battle.

===Gulf War===
The bulk of Iraqi armoured units were mostly equipped with the Type 69 and only Republican Guard divisions were equipped with Iraqi-modified T-72s, with exception of the regular army&#x27;s armored &quot;Saladin&quot; division. Thus, engagements between T-72s and Coalition tanks were limited to conflicts involving such Iraqi units.

During Desert Storm, Iraqi T-72s were technologically 20 years out of date. Only one M1 Abrams was officially documented during the Persian Gulf War as having received enough damage to be towed and receive maintenance after being struck three times on the turret by a T-72. Another six M1A1s were allegedly hit by Iraqi T-72 tank fire in the Gulf War official report, but the impacts were largely ineffectual. According to Atkinson and Scales, T-72s accounted for at least two M2 Bradley kills during Desert Storm and left several damaged, all on February 26, 1991. Overall, the T-72 offered little challenge to Abrams and Challenger tanks, both of which could hit a T-72 from outside the range of T-72&#x27;s main gun. In addition to lack of range, exploding munitions facilitated by the design of the tanks&#x27; ammunition loading system were also an issue for Iraqi T-72s.

===2003 Iraq War===

During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Republican Guard&#x27;s T-72s, most from the Medina Division, were deployed around Baghdad to attempt a last-ditch defense of the Baath regime. In April 2003, U.S. tanks engaged their counterparts from just 50 yards, killing seven Iraqi T-72s without any losses. Such encounters exposed the poor marksmanship of Iraqi gunners, in part due to the shortage of modern night-vision and range-finder assets. The T-72s were even more technologically lacking at this time, and it is not known if any improvements to the tanks were made between the Persian Gulf War and this conflict. Nonetheless, one Bradley was largely disabled by a 125 mm round from an Asad Babil tank when Iraqi armoured troops attempted to attack their American opponents near Baghdad airport.

The last operational T-72s acquired from the USSR and Poland were destroyed by the successive waves of American armored incursions on the Iraqi capital or abandoned by their crews after the fall of Baghdad, several of them without firing a single shot. The derelict tanks were later scrapped by U.S. Army disposal teams or shipped to the United States for target practice.

===War against the Islamic State===
In April of 2017, the pro-government Hashed al-Shaabi militia used Iraqi-modified T-72Ms against forces of the Islamic State in clashes around the ancient city of Hatra. In the same year, the Iraqi army also used T-72s during the Battle of Mossul.

==Lion of Babylon project==
In the late 1970s, Iraq locally produced the T-72, a Soviet-made main battle tank. The tanks were assembled at the factory near Taji in the Baghdad Governorate. The project was named &quot;Lion of Babylon&quot; (), drawing its name from an ancient Babylonian symbol that was based on the Asiatic lion and represented the king of Babylon as well as the goddess Ishtar. It was triggered in part by the American embargo against the sale of military vehicles to Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War. However, it is disputed how many tanks outlined in the project were finished, and likewise whether the Iraqi tanks reported to be &quot;Lions of Babylon&quot; during the Gulf War and Iraq War were merely imported T-72s.

In 1986 a West German company built a factory in Taji to manufacture steel for several military uses. It was enlisted to retrofit and rebuild tanks already on duty in the Iraqi Army, such as T-54/55s, T-62s, and several hundred of Soviet and Polish T-72s, imported during early stages of the war with Iran.
In the late 1980s, plans were made to produce new T-72M1 tanks at that facility. These tanks were to be assembled from knockdown kits delivered by the Polish state-owned company Bumar-Łabędy. The local assembly of the T-72 was to start early 1989, as suggested by Iraqi officials. A number of Iraqi officials such as Lt. General Amer Rashid, however, did not like the idea of being dependent on knockdown kits supplied by another country and pushed for the complete production of the T-72M1 tank instead.
In 1991, the Taji plant was destroyed by an airstrike while being upgraded by Bumar-Łabędy.

The United Nations imposed an arms embargo following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, which reduced the complete assembly of tanks to simple spare parts for T-72s and other tanks in the Iraqi arsenal. According to Polish officials, not a single T-72M1 had been assembled at the facility, even though in 1988, a supposedly locally produced T-72M was on display during an Iraqi arms show.

===Specifications===
In most aspects, the Lion of Babylon as proposed was physically identical to the T-72M1 it is based on. Lion of Babylon T-72s were to be upgraded with the addition of laminated armor on the front slope and rear panels as protection against HEAT projectiles.
American military intelligence believed some were equipped with Belgian-made thermal sights. These same sources claim the tank was also supposed to be provided with a better track protection against sand and mud than the Soviet T-72, by reducing the original number of shock absorbers. Some tanks also were fitted with a type of electro-optical interference pod of Chinese origin.
As secondary armament, the tank was to feature either the NSV or the DShK 12.7 mm machine gun and the coaxial 7.62 mm PKT common to all T-72 models. The Lion&#x27;s primary armor was intended to be identical to that of T-72M1, without any improvements. The Lion&#x27;s side armor was supposed to have 60 mm protection, the turret side armor 300 mm, and the flat rear 45 mm thick.

<text>Åsne Seierstad (born 10 February 1970) is a Norwegian freelance journalist and writer, best known for her accounts of everyday life in war zones – most notably Kabul after 2001, Baghdad in 2002 and the ruined Grozny in 2006.

==Personal and professional life==
Seierstad was born in Oslo, but grew up in Lillehammer, Norway to &quot;a feminist author mother&quot;, Lector Frøydis Guldahl, and &quot;a leftist politician father&quot;, Assistant Professor (b. 1936) She holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Oslo where she majored in Russian, Spanish and history of ideas. 

From 1993 until 1996 she reported for the &quot;Arbeiderbladet&quot; in Russia and in 1997 from China. From 1998 until 2000 she worked for the national public broadcaster NRK where she reported from the Serbian breakaway province of Kosovo. &quot;With Their Backs to The World: Portraits of Serbia&quot;, her first book, is an account of this time. (This book was extended and republished in 2004 when she again visited Serbia. The name was changed slightly, to &quot;Portraits of Serbia&quot;, indicating that Serbia&#x27;s back was no longer turned to the world.)

As a reporter, she is particularly remembered for her work in war zones such as Afghanistan, Iraq and most recently Chechnya, as well as for her reports on the September 11 attacks in the United States. &quot;The Bookseller of Kabul&quot;, her second, bestselling book, is an account of the time she spent living with an Afghan family in Kabul after the fall of the Taliban in 2001. Her other books include &quot;One Hundred And One Days: A Baghdad Journal&quot; which describes the three months she spent in Iraq in the build-up to the U.S.-led invasion in 2003; &quot;Angel of Grozny: Inside Chechnya&quot;, an account of the time she spent in Chechnya after the war; and &quot;One of Us: The Story of Anders Breivik and the Massacre in Norway&quot; (2015), which is the basis for the Netflix drama, &quot;22 July&quot;.

Seierstad is fluent in five languages, and has &quot;a good working knowledge&quot; of another four. She currently lives and works in Oslo.

She has two children with the Norwegian jazz musician and composer Trygve Seim (b. 1971).

==Trial==
There are contradictory accounts concerning Seierstad&#x27;s legal battles with Shah Muhammad Rais, the bookseller portrayed in &quot;The Bookseller of Kabul&quot;. 

According to &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, on 24 July 2010 a court in Oslo found Seierstad guilty of defamation and &quot;negligent journalistic practices and ordered to pay damages to Suraia Rais, wife of Shah Muhammad Rais&quot;. 

British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; published the same story, but later revised the it online and in print. The revised version claimed Seirstad was not found guilty of defamation or of negligence, but rather of invasion of privacy, the decision on damages would be taken later, and was finally 250,000 Norwegian kroner (£26,000). In relation to the book&#x27;s influence on Rais&#x27;s family members, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote &quot;The article also said the book&#x27;s revelations of personal details caused several members of the Afghan family to move to Pakistan and Canada. We should have made clear this was an allegation made by the plaintiff&#x27;s side in a case document.&quot; 

Seierstad won her appeal of the judgment and the Supreme Court declined to review the appellate court&#x27;s decision.

* 2001: Fritt Ord Honorary Award

<doc id="199096" wikidata="Q749118" url="?curid=199096" title="Government Accountability Office">
<text>The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) is an independent, nonpartisan government agency within the legislative branch that provides auditing, evaluative, and investigative services for the United States Congress. It is the supreme audit institution of the federal government of the United States. It identifies its core &quot;mission values&quot; as: accountability, integrity, and reliability. It is also known as the &quot;congressional watchdog&quot;. The agency is headed by the Comptroller General of the United States. The comptroller general is appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate. When a vacancy occurs in the office of the comptroller general, Congress establishes a commission to recommend individuals to the president. The commission consists of the following:

*the speaker of the United States House of Representatives
*the president pro tempore of the United States Senate
*the majority and minority leaders of the House of Representatives and the Senate
*the chair and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs
*the chair and ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight

The commission must recommend at least three individuals to the president, and the president may request that the commission recommend additional individuals. The president then selects an individual from those recommended to nominate as the new comptroller general. The president&#x27;s nomination must be confirmed by the Senate&#x27;s Committee on Homeland Security &amp; Governmental Affairs before being voted on by the full Senate. 

The current comptroller general is Gene Dodaro, who has served in the position since March 13, 2008.

==Powers of GAO==

The work of the GAO is done at the request of congressional committees or subcommittees or is mandated by public laws or committee reports. It also undertakes research under the authority of the comptroller general. It supports congressional oversight by:
* auditing agency operations to determine whether federal funds are being spent efficiently and effectively;
* investigating allegations of illegal and improper activities;
* reporting on how well government programs and policies are meeting their objectives;
* performing policy analyses and outlining options for congressional consideration;
* issuing legal decisions and opinions;
* advising Congress and the heads of executive agencies about ways to make government more efficient and effective.

As a result of its work, GAO produces:
* reports and written correspondence;
* testimonies and statements for the record, where the former are delivered orally by one or more GAO senior executives at a congressional hearing and the latter are provided for inclusion in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;;
* briefings, which are usually given directly to congressional staff members;
* legal decisions and opinions resolving bid protests and addressing issues of appropriations law as well as opinions on the scope and exercise of authority of federal officers;
* science and technology assessments.

The GAO also produces special publications on specific issues of general interest to many Americans, such as its report on the fiscal future of the United States, GAO&#x27;s role in the federal bid protest process, and critical issues for congressional consideration related to improving the nation&#x27;s image abroad.

==Organization==
The GAO is headquartered in Washington, D.C. and maintains an additional 11 field offices around the country. Each field office contains several mission teams, but not every mission team is represented at each field office. 

===Mission teams===
The GAO is composed of 15 mission teams that work on reports in a given subject area. Missions teams are headed by a Managing Director which fall under the Senior Executive Service. The current slate of mission teams is:

In addition to its mission teams, the GAO also has 16 operations and staff components that support their work and carryout other agency functions, including its bid decisions.
* Audit Policy and Quality Assurance (APQA)
* Chief Administrative Office (CAO)
* Congressional Relations (CR)

==History==
The GAO was established as the General Accounting Office by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. The act required the head of the GAO to: According to the GAO&#x27;s current mission statement, the agency exists to support the Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance and ensure the accountability of the federal government for the benefit of the American people.

The name was changed in 2004 to the Government Accountability Office by the GAO Human Capital Reform Act to better reflect the mission of the office. The GAO&#x27;s auditors conduct not only financial audits, but also engage in a wide assortment of performance audits.

Over the years, the GAO has been referred to as &quot;The Congressional Watchdog&quot; and &quot;The Taxpayers&#x27; Best Friend&quot; for its frequent audits and investigative reports that have uncovered waste and inefficiency in government. News media often draw attention to the GAO&#x27;s work by publishing stories on the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of its reports. Members of Congress also frequently cite the GAO&#x27;s work in statements to the press, congressional hearings, and floor debates on proposed legislation. In 2007 the Partnership for Public Service ranked the GAO second on its list of the best places to work in the federal government and &quot;Washingtonian&quot; magazine included the GAO on its 2007 list of great places to work in Washington, a list that encompasses the public, private, and non-profit sectors.

The GAO is headed by the comptroller general of the U.S., a professional and non-partisan position in the U.S. government. The comptroller general is appointed by the president, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a fifteen-year, non-renewable term. The president selects a nominee from a list of at least three individuals recommended by an eight-member bipartisan, bicameral commission of congressional leaders. During such a term, the comptroller general has standing to pursue litigation to compel access to federal agency information. The comptroller general may not be removed by the president, but only by Congress through impeachment or joint resolution for specific reasons. Since 1921, there have been only eight comptrollers general, and no formal attempt has ever been made to remove a comptroller general.

Labor-management relations became fractious during the nine-year tenure of the seventh comptroller general, David M. Walker. On September 19, 2007, GAO analysts voted by a margin of two to one (897–445), in a 75% turnout, to establish the first union in the GAO&#x27;s 86-year history. The analysts voted to affiliate with the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), a member union of the AFL–CIO. There are more than 1,800 analysts in the GAO analysts bargaining unit; the local voted to name itself IFPTE Local 1921, in honor of the date of the GAO&#x27;s establishment. On February 14, 2008, the GAO analysts&#x27; union approved its first-ever negotiated pay contract with management; of just over 1,200 votes, 98% were in favor of the contract.

The GAO also establishes standards for audits of government organizations, programs, activities, and functions, and of government assistance received by contractors, nonprofit organizations, and other nongovernmental organizations. These standards, often referred to as Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), are to be followed by auditors and audit organizations when required by law, regulation, agreement, contract, or policy. These standards pertain to auditors&#x27; professional qualifications, the quality of audit effort, and the characteristics of professional and meaningful audit reports.

In 1992, the GAO hosted the XIV INCOSAI, the fourteenth triennial convention of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).

==Reports==
The GAO is a United States government electronic data provider, as all of its reports are available on its website, except for certain reports whose distribution is limited to official use in order to protect national security. The variety of their reports&#x27; topics range from Federal Budget and Fiscal Issues to Financial Management, Education, Retirement Issues, Defense, Homeland Security, Administration of Justice, Health Care, Information Management and Technology, Natural Resources, Environment, International Affairs, Trade, Financial Markets, Housing, Government Management and Human Capital, and Science and Technology Assessments and Analytics. The GAO often produces highlights of its reports that serve as a statement for the record for various subcommittees of the United States Congress.

Most GAO studies and reports are initiated by requests from members of Congress, including requests mandated in statute, and so reflect concerns of current political import, for example to study the impact of a government-wide hiring freeze. Many reports are issued periodically and take a long view of US agencies&#x27; operations. The GAO also produces annual reports on key issues including duplication and cost savings and High-Risk Update.

The GAO prepares some 900 reports annually. The GAO publishes reports and information relating to, &quot;inter alia&quot;:

===Financial statements of the US government===
Each year the GAO issues an audit report on the financial statements of the United States Government. The 2010 Financial Report of the United States Government was released on December 21, 2010. The accompanying press release states that the GAO &#x27;cannot render an opinion on the 2010 consolidated financial statements of the federal government, because of widespread material internal control weaknesses, significant uncertainties, and other limitations&#x27;.

===US public debt===
As part of its initiative to advocate sustainability, the GAO publishes a Federal Fiscal Outlook Report, as well as data relating to the deficit. The U.S. deficit is presented on a cash rather than accruals basis, although the GAO notes that the accrual deficit &quot;provides more information on the longer-term implications of the government&#x27;s annual operations&quot;.
In FY 2010, the US federal government had a net operating cost of $2,080 billion, although since this includes accounting provisions (estimates of future liabilities), the cash deficit is $1,294 billion.

===Quinquennial strategic plan===
The most recent GAO strategic plan, for 2018–2023, sets out four goals, namely:
#Address current and emerging challenges to the well-being and financial security of the American people;
#Help the Congress respond to changing security threats and the challenges of global interdependence;
#Help transform the Federal Government to address national challenges;
#Maximize the value of the GAO by enabling quality, timely service to the Congress and by being a leading practices federal agency.

===Forensic Audits and Investigative Service (FAIS)===
The Forensic Audits and Investigative Service (FAIS) team provides Congress with high-quality forensic audits and investigations of fraud, waste, and abuse; other special investigations; and security and vulnerability assessments. Its work cuts across a diverse array of government programs administered by the IRS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Homeland Security, among others.

===Bid protests===
Unsuccessful bidders for government contracts may submit protests if they have reason to challenge an agency&#x27;s decision, and the GAO may then release a report on the decision, redacted if necessary. Various GAO decisions have confirmed that:

There is a facility within the Bid Protest Regulations for the GAO to recommend reimbursement of a bidder&#x27;s protest costs if the procuring agency takes corrective action in response to a protest. The circumstances justifying bid protest cost reimbursement must involve &quot;undue delay&quot; by the agency in &quot;taking corrective action in the face of a clearly meritorious protest&quot;.

The GAO confirmed in 2014 that its jurisdiction includes investigation of protests raising allegations of agency violation of the Procurement Integrity Act.

==Technology assessments==
After the closing of the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in 1995, Congress directed the GAO to conduct a technology assessment (TA) pilot program. Between 2002 and 2005, three reports were completed: use of biometrics for border security, cyber security for critical infrastructure protection, and technologies for protecting structures in wildland fires. The GAO reports and technology assessments, which are made available to the public, have become essential vehicles for understanding science and technology (S&amp;T) implications of policies considered by the Congress.

Since 2008, Congress has established a permanent TA function within the GAO. This new operational role augments GAO&#x27;s performance audits related to S&amp;T issues, including effectiveness and efficiency of U.S. federal programs. In 2010, the GAO joined the European Parliamentary Technology Assessment (EPTA) as an associate member. In 2019, the GAO established a new mission team, the Science, Technology Assessment, and Analytics team, which has primary responsibility for technology assessments.

The GAO has published a TA Design Handbook to help technology assessment teams analyze the impact of technology and make complex issues more easily understood and useful to policymakers. The GAO defines TA as the &quot;thorough and balanced analysis of significant primary, secondary, indirect, and delayed interactions of a technological innovation with society, the environment, and the economy and the present and foreseen consequences and impacts of those interactions.&quot; Recognizing that the effects of those interactions can have implications, the GAO has in some of its products included policy options. The Technology Assessment section of its website lists GAO&#x27;s public TA reports.

<text>Telford () is a town in the Telford and Wrekin borough in Shropshire, England. The wider borough covers the town, its suburbs and surrounding towns and villages. The town is close to the county&#x27;s eastern boundary, and near the River Severn. The notable hill near the town called The Wrekin is part of the Shropshire Hills, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. To the south of the town is the Ironbridge Gorge, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Places around the Ironbridge Gorge area, which were developed into the town itself, are internationally recognised as being &quot;The Birthplace of Industry&quot; being to a large extent constructed during the Industrial Revolution on the Shropshire Coalfield. The town is the main administrative centre for Telford and Wrekin Council.

The M54 motorway was completed in 1983, improving the town&#x27;s road links with the West Midlands conurbation, Wolverhampton is south east and Birmingham is in the same direction. In the 2011 census, the town had a population of 142,723 while in 2017, the wider borough had an estimated population of 175,271. It is the most populous settlement in Shropshire, Shrewsbury is second and is to the west of the town. It is near Staffordshire: Stafford is to the east and Stoke-on-Trent is north east from the town.

The town is polycentric, having been designated under the New Towns Acts in 1963 and 1968 and developed between the 1960s to the 1970s. Centred on a shopping centre and a public park, the new town is named after Thomas Telford, a civil engineer on many road, canal and rail projects in the county. It was originally designated under the name Dawley New Town. As well as multiple villages and Dawley, the other constituent towns are Coalbrookdale, Dawley, Madeley, Newport, Oakengates and Wellington.

==History==

===Early history===

Early settlement in the area was thought to be on the land that sloped up from the Weald Moors (an area north of the town centre) towards the line along which the Roman Watling Street was built. Farmland surrounded three large estates in the 10th century, namely Wellington, Wrockwardine and Lilleshall.

From the 13th century there was urban development in Wellington and Madeley, where Wenlock Priory founded a new town. Six monastic houses, founded in the 11th and 12th centuries, had large interests in the area&#x27;s economic growth. They collectively acquired almost half of the area and profited from coal and ironstone mines and iron smithies on their estates.

The area was the site of the 1821 Cinderloo Uprising, which saw 3,000 people protest against the lowering of wages for those working in the local coal industry. The protests resulted in the deaths of three striking colliers.

===Modern history===


The New Town was first designated on 16 January 1963 by the Conservative administration as Dawley New Town, covering of Dawley, Wenlock, Oakengates, Wellington Rural District and Shifnal Rural District. Development started, guided by the Dawley New Town Development Corporation, with the first homes on the new Sutton Hill housing estate being occupied in 1967. Initial planning and design concepts for Dawley New Town were produced by the Birmingham-based John Madin Design Group.

The Minister proposed an extension of in 1968 (taking in the historic area of Ironbridge Gorge). The &quot;Dawley New Town (Designation) Amendment (Telford) Order&quot; was made on 29 November 1968, extending the New Town area by of &quot;land lying within the urban districts of Oakengates and Wellington and the rural districts of Shifnal and Wellington&quot;. The Order also renamed the new town Telford, after the Scottish-born civil engineer Thomas Telford, who in 1787 became Surveyor of Public Works for Shropshire. Other suggested names at the time were Dawelloak and Wrekin Forest City.

Most of the infrastructure was constructed from the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, with the major housing and commercial development occurring over three decades up to the early 1990s when the Development Corporation was wound up to be replaced by the Commission for New Towns, later English Partnerships, and most of the property was handed over to the then Wrekin District Council. Telford was now 25 years old and was firmly established as one of the most important towns in the region. There is a Retail Park called Wrekin Retail Park in Wellington.

In 1983, after fierce opposition and three public enquiries, the M54 motorway was completed, connecting the town to the M6 and thence the rest of the UK&#x27;s motorway network. Other major roads are the A5, A518 and A442, which is commonly known as the Eastern Primary or &quot;EP&quot;, and is officially branded &quot;Queensway&quot;.

Many of the new town&#x27;s residents were originally from the West Midlands conurbation, which includes Wolverhampton, Birmingham, Dudley and Walsall. A majority of the council house tenants in Telford were rehoused from inner-city Birmingham. The rehousing affected existing communities, who were sometimes resentful of the changes. As a result some individuals still refuse to put Telford in their address, instead using the original local name (such as Wellington or Dawley) and often citing the existence of town Councils as support for the argument &quot;you can&#x27;t live in a town in a town&quot;, e.g. Wellington (Town) Telford (Town). The new town&#x27;s residents who arrived in the 1960s and 1970s earned the unwanted nickname &#x27;overspill&#x27; from people living in the existing towns and villages.

In 2007 a £250 million regeneration plan for the town centre was announced, which includes the pedestrianisation of the road surrounding the shopping centre and the creation of new cafés, bars and shops which would lead to 1,750 new jobs. The reason for the expansion is that the original &#x27;centre&#x27; was only ever a shopping place with no real heart. As the &#x27;centre&#x27; closed early in the evening there was no nightlife at all in the area, the only major local entertainment areas being in Oakengates and Wellington.

The first phase of the town-centre development, named Southwater, was completed in 2014. The official opening ceremony, on 18 October 2014, included live music and fireworks. The area includes a refurbished library, various chain restaurants, Cineworld IMAX Cinema, a bowling alley/arcade and a new multi-storey car park.

==Geography==
Telford town centre lies about east/south-east of Shrewsbury and north-west of Wolverhampton. The town covers 7,803 hectares (30.13 square miles) and its southern and eastern parts, between the Severn Gorge and Donnington Wood, include the East Shropshire coalfield. North and north-west Telford lie beyond the coalfield&#x27;s boundary fault on sandstone beds which, along with other Triassic formations, prevail over much of the North Shropshire plain. The town centre stands on a watershed, with land to the south draining towards the River Severn and to the north sloping gently down towards the Weald Moors. The town is dominated by the Wrekin, a large hill of 407 m (1335 ft), south-west of Wellington, straddling the border with the unitary Shropshire Council (before the latter&#x27;s creation in 2009 the borough of Shrewsbury and Atcham).

==Governance==
Within the borough of Telford &amp; Wrekin, the town is entirely parished. Telford has no single town council because of this. The town is also divided into Wards, within the Telford and Wrekin borough. These are used for electoral purposes and demographic surveys. Telford was created politically – but its attempts to make a cohesive town from the fusion of other independent towns: Wellington, Madeley, Hadley, Oakengates, Dawley, Ironbridge and Donnington have largely been successful. Despite this, the town has much clearer divisions than in other older towns, such as nearby Shrewsbury, which have developed into one consolidated urban area over time. Some small settlements to the south such as a part of Ironbridge and Broseley, while part of the Telford Urban Area, are administered by Shropshire Council.

Telford is the only settlement within the Telford parliamentary constituency, which was held by Labour from its creation in 1997 until the 2015 general election. It was then held by Lucy Allen who stood down ahead of the 2024 general election after defecting to the Reform UK party. The current MP since the election is Shaun Davies (Labour). Some suburbs, such as Wellington, are located in The Wrekin, which also has varying support between the Conservatives and Labour. Conservative Mark Pritchard was reelected as the latter seat&#x27;s MP in 2024, and has now held the seat continuously since 2005. Telford is administratively part of the West Midlands region.

==Demography==

In 1963 Dawley new town was intended to take 50,000 people from the West Midlands conurbation and so to grow to a town of 70,000 or more. By 1968 Telford was intended to take an additional 50,000 and grow to a town of 220,000 or more by 1991. By 1983, however, Telford&#x27;s population was just under 108,000, and it was generally thought that it might not reach 120,000 by the late 1980s.

The population of Telford&#x27;s built-up area was 147,980 according to the 2011 census. At the 2001 census, the urban area had 138,241 people. The built-up area includes Broseley which lies outside the Borough of Telford and Wrekin and also includes the towns of Dawley, Oakengates, Wellington and Madeley.

Telford has a younger than average population, and a higher rate of teenage pregnancy than the national average, as well as relatively high levels of income deprivation with 15% of residents living in low income households. In addition the level of statutorily homeless households in 2004/05 was above average for England. The Telford and Wrekin area is a popular commuter zone, containing some relatively rural areas in the North and West of the borough. These are popular with commuters to the West Midlands conurbation, due to the good transport links provided by the A5/M54.

In 2011, the town was 91.9% white (88.5% White British), 4.7% Asian, 1.2% Black, 1.9% Mixed race and 0.2% other. At the same census the population of the town was 142,723 and had an area of 46.2 kilometers with the population estimated to be 147,105 in 2016.

==Economy==
During the economic crisis of the late 1960s (with unemployment doubling nationally during the second half of the decade), unemployment in the then-new town was initially high.

However, in 1967 Halesfield Industrial Estate was founded on the south-eastern edge of the town – the first real answer to Telford&#x27;s unemployment problems. Other large estates followed, in 1973 with Stafford Park just east of the town centre and in 1979 with Hortonwood, to the north, helping ease the unemployment crisis in a decade which saw an almost unbroken rise in unemployment.

In total, half a million square metres of factory space were provided between 1968 and 1983, making Telford an attractive investment area.

By 1976, Telford had begun to recruit industry from the US, Europe, and Japan. The foreign firms required larger factories, and they began to be built at Stafford Park. By 1983 over 2,000 jobs in Telford were provided by around 40 (mostly American) foreign companies. In contrast to industry in the Black Country at the time, these new companies focused on high-technology industries rather than the heavy and metal-finishing industries.

The new arrivals included the American company Unimation and three firms from Japan: Nikon UK Ltd., which opened a warehouse at Halesfield in 1983; video-tape manufacturers Hitachi Maxell at Apley Castle in 1983; and office equipment manufacturers Ricoh, who took a site for a factory at Priorslee next to the M54, and formed the first in Telford&#x27;s new enterprise zone.

Consequently, from the later 1970s, Telford began to attract high-technology firms and to diversify its industry, and the promotion of the Service industry also began to prosper, in the Telford Town Centre area. However, a deepening national recession meant that, despite the creation of new jobs, there were net job losses from 1979. Unemployment grew from 3.4 per cent in 1969 to over 8 per cent in 1972 and 22.3 per cent (almost double the national average) in 1983; long-term unemployment rose even faster. Nevertheless, the rate of increase in unemployment was slowing down by 1983 and was making some progress against national and regional trends.

Unemployment in Telford was still around the 20% mark – nearly double the national average at the time – as late as 1986. The Lawson Boom of the next three years saw that figure fall dramatically by the end of the decade, only for it to rise to a similarly high figure again by 1992 as a result of the early 1990s recession. In recent years the local economy has matured, the median gross weekly earnings for full-time workers who work in Telford and Wrekin was £563 in 2019 (West Midlands £552.50 and England £591.40).
Telford has attracted several large IT services companies, including EDS who support the MOD contract from the Euston Park site, as well as a vast array of clients across the world from the Plaza building. Also Capgemini and Fujitsu employ a significant number of staff in the area, mainly supporting their governmental client, HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC). The expansion in these job sectors provided a great asset to Telford&#x27;s economic recovery after 1992. By August 2007, the success story of Telford&#x27;s economy had seen unemployment shrink to 3.3% – a fraction of its peak 15 years earlier.

However, the subsequent recession meant that unemployment in the area had risen to 5% by February 2011, although this was still well below the national average.

The &quot;Shropshire Star&quot; evening newspaper was based in Ketley. There is a free local paper the &quot;Telford Journal&quot; which is also published by the Shropshire Star. However, the building was demolished in 2023, and moved to Telford Town Centre.

There have been job losses, with the movement of 500 Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) jobs at the MoD base at Sapphire House, Telford town centre, to Bristol. The sugar beet factory at Allscott closed in 2007.

In 2019 a joint venture called Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land installed itself in Telford, not far from Babcock DSG. Together they are responsible for the Challenger 2 Life Extension Project.

==Landmarks==
The commercial centre of the town is Telford Town Centre, located off Junction 5 of the M54 motorway, completed in the 1980s. It is home to the administrative headquarters of Telford &amp; Wrekin Council, which are now based at Addenbrook House on Ironmasters Way, after moving from the old Civic Offices (dating from the mid-1970s) in December 2012. The large Telford Shopping Centre (and the accompanying Town Park), various office blocks, such as the blue office towers (&quot;Telford Plaza&quot;), and the &quot;Windsor Life&quot; building. &quot;The Forge&quot; retail park and a large Odeon Cinema are also located in the area. Telford also houses one of the Midlands&#x27; few ice skating rinks near the Telford International Centre (TIC). The TIC comprises a number of exhibition halls and event spaces. It holds parties, conferences, concerts and was formerly the venue of the UK Snooker Championship.

A major Shropshire landmark, also now part of Telford, is The Iron Bridge, located in Ironbridge. It was the first bridge of its size in the world made out of cast iron. In the same area is the Ironbridge Gorge, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The most important landmark in the area is The Wrekin hill. There is also the Lilleshall Monument erected on Lilleshall Hill to the north-east, to the 1st Duke of Sutherland.

==Education==
Telford has a number of primary and secondary schools. These range from academies such as the Telford Langley School to City Technology Colleges like the Thomas Telford School. to the north are Adams&#x27; Grammar School and Newport Girls High School selective schools located in nearby Newport. Wrekin College, an independent co-educational boarding and day school, is located in the Wellington area of Telford.

Further education was handled by Telford College of Arts and Technology (TCAT) and Telford New College, a sixth-form college located in Wellington. In September 2017 the two colleges merged to form Telford College. There are four other sixth forms located at Haberdashers&#x27; Abraham Darby, Holy Trinity Academy, Madeley Academy and Thomas Telford School.

Telford is home to Harper Adams University digital skills hub, based at The Quad. Specialising in food, animal and sustainable education, the university&#x27;s main campus is also located 9.5 miles to the northeast at Edgmond, near Newport.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the nearby Wrekin TV transmitter situated south east of Telford. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Shropshire, Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire, Greatest Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire and Capital North West &amp; Wales. The Shropshire Star is the town&#x27;s local weekly newspaper.

==Transport==
Telford is situated at the terminus of the M54 motorway, a spur of the M6 linking the town with Wolverhampton and the West Midlands, and on the A5 road between Shrewsbury and Cannock.

Telford Central railway station is situated on the Shrewsbury to Wolverhampton Line. The town also has Oakengates railway station and Wellington railway station on the same line. All three stations are serviced by trains from Transport for Wales Rail, West Midlands Railway, and Avanti West Coast.

In May 1998, Virgin Trains West Coast introduced a service from Shrewsbury to London Euston. It was withdrawn in 2000. A service to Walsall was introduced from Wellington via Wolverhampton but proved to be unprofitable and was withdrawn by London Midland in December 2008. A new service from Wrexham General to London Marylebone was launched by Wrexham &amp; Shropshire in 2008. The venture however proved unprofitable and ceased to operate on 28 January 2011, leaving Shropshire as the only English county without a direct train link to London. Virgin Trains re-launched a direct Shrewsbury to London Euston service in December 2014. In addition, there are three further stations isolated from the national network, Spring Village, Lawley and Horsehay &amp; Dawley, at Telford Steam Railway, situated at Horsehay.

Telford&#x27;s rapidly growing population still has a relatively low car ownership. In 2004 Telford &amp; Wrekin council was awarded &#x27;Beacon Status&#x27; for improving access to public transport. Being a new town with a planned transport infrastructure, the town features relatively few traffic problems, in comparison to the urban areas of Birmingham or medieval streets of Shrewsbury. The M54 reduces through-traffic on local roads, and the A442 Queensway acts as a north–south artery road.

The majority of bus services in the area are operated by Arriva Midlands from its garage at Stafford Park, which replaced the original Midland Red garage in Wellington. Banga Bus operate service 891 to Wolverhampton via Shifnal and Tettenhall, replacing the original service operated by Midland Red which was latterly operated by Arriva Midlands. Between 1 June 2021 and January 2022, Chaserider launched service X14 to Cannock and the McArthur Glenn West Midlands Designer Outlet. but was withdrawn due to low usage.

A number of council contract services operate under the &#x27;Travel Telford&#x27; brand, including Arriva Midlands service 99, Chaserider services 100, 102, 103 and 104 and Select Bus service 101. These were introduced to link local employment opportunities, schools and villages previously without bus services. Notably the 100 (nicknamed &#x27;Express 100&#x27;) runs seven days a week and on evenings.

<text>Lyman Ward (born June 21, 1941) is a Canadian actor best known for his roles in &quot;Creature&quot; (1984), &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; (1986), and &quot;Milk and Honey&quot; (1988).

==Life and career==
Ward was born and raised in Saint John, New Brunswick and graduated from St. Malachy&#x27;s Memorial High School in the class of 1959, and then in 1963 from St. Thomas University which was located at the time in Miramichi, New Brunswick before relocating to Fredericton in 1964.

He appeared on the first episode of &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; as Tad Schotz, but is most noted for playing Ferris Bueller&#x27;s father in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; (1986). In 1990, Ward was cast as Jim Walsh in the pilot of the show &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. Producers later recast the role and his scenes were cut and reshot with James Eckhouse. In 2001, he made a cameo appearance in the movie &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot; as Mr. Wyler, spoofing his role in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. Ward also played a minor role in &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot; (1987) as John, one of the marketers.

Lyman Ward and Second City actor Sandra Bogan lived together in 1985. Ward met Cindy Pickett on the set of &quot;Ferris Bueller&quot;, where they played the parents of the teenage protagonist in the 1986 film. They married in real life, had two children together, then divorced shortly after playing the parents of the teenage protagonist in the 1992 film &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot;.

Ward published a novel titled &quot;Fortune&#x27;s Tide&quot; in 2016, a historical fiction based in his home town of Saint John.

He continues to act in both films and television.

<doc id="199104" wikidata="Q1141060" url="?curid=199104" title="Caudofoveata">
<text>Caudofoveata is a small class within the phylum Mollusca, also known as Chaetodermomorpha. The class is often combined with Solenogastres and termed Aplacophora, but some studies have cast doubt on the monophyly of this group.

== Anatomy ==
Caudofoveata are worm-like molluscs ranging 0.02–10 cm in size, but one species, Chaetoderma felderi, can reach 36.5 cm. The foot is completely absent, and instead of a shell their mantle is covered in calcareous spines called sclerites.

== Ecology ==
Caudofoveates live by burrowing through soft sediment, and feed by lying vertically in the sediment with just the mouthparts exposed and taking in passing organic detritus. During sexual reproduction, the female produces eggs which are fertilized and brooded, and then the larvae swim freely.

=== Diet ===
Caudofoveates are deposit feeders, or more selective detritivores or predators of foraminifera.

==Taxonomy==
Caudofoveata comprises the following families and genera:
* Chaetodermatidae
** &quot;Caudofoveatus&quot;
** &quot;Chaetoderma&quot;
* Falcidentidae
** &quot;Chaetoderma&quot;
** &quot;Falcidens&quot;
** &quot;Furcillidens&quot;
* Limifossoridae
** &quot;Limifossor&quot;
* Metachaetodermatidae
** &quot;Metachaetoderma&quot;
* Prochaetodermatidae
** &quot;Chevroderma&quot;
** &quot;Claviderma&quot;
** &quot;Lonchoderma&quot;
** &quot;Niteomica&quot;
** &quot;Prochaetoderma&quot;
** &quot;Spathoderma&quot;
* Scutopodidae
** &quot;Psilodens&quot;
** &quot;Scutopus&quot;
There are 15 genera, with about 150 known species.

<text>Cheddite is a class of explosive materials invented in 1897 by E. A. G. Street of the firm of Berges, Corbin et Cie and originally manufactured in the town of Chedde in Haute-Savoie, France, in the early twentieth century.

Closely related to Sprengel explosives, cheddites consisted of a high proportion of inorganic chlorates mixed with nitroaromatics (e.g. nitrobenzene or dinitrotoluene) plus a little paraffin or castor oil as a moderant for the chlorate. Several different types were made, and they were principally used in quarrying. Due to availability of ingredients and easy production process it was also the most common explosive material manufactured by the Polish Underground State in occupied Poland during World War II; it was used for production of the R wz. 42 and Filipinka hand grenades. 

Since the 1970s, Cheddite is the commercial name for primers CX series (CX 50, CX 1000 and CX 2000) for shotgun cartridges.

<text>USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; (CVN-72) is the fifth in the United States Navy. She is the third Navy ship to have been named after the former President Abraham Lincoln. Her home port is NAS North Island, San Diego, California; she is a member of the United States Pacific Fleet. She is administratively responsible to Commander, Naval Air Forces Pacific, and operationally serves as the flagship of Carrier Strike Group 3 and host to Carrier Air Wing Nine. She was returned to the fleet on 12 May 2017, marking the successful completion of her Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH) carried out at Newport News Shipyard. As of 10 August 2024, USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; and her strike group are being deployed to the Middle East as part of the U.S. response to the escalation of tensions between Iran and Israel.

== &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; Carrier Strike Group ==
&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; is part of Carrier Strike Group Three (CSG-3) with Carrier Air Wing Nine (CVW-9) embarked, with &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; as the flagship of the strike group and the home of the commander of Destroyer Squadron 21.

=== Ships of Destroyer Squadron 21 ===
* USS &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; (DDG-77) - &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class destroyer
* USS &quot;Spruance&quot; (DDG-111) - &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class destroyer
* USS &quot;Frank E. Petersen Jr.&quot; (DDG-121) - &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class destroyer

=== Squadrons of CVW-9 ===
== Ship history ==
=== Construction ===
&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;″s contract was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding on 27 December 1982; her keel was laid 3 November 1984 at Newport News, Virginia. The ship was launched on 13 February 1988 and commissioned on 11 November 1989.

=== 1990 to 1999 ===
&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was transferred to the Pacific in September 1990 performing Gringo-Gaucho with the Argentine Naval Aviation during the transit. From 4 October, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; formed CTG 24.8 in company with ; 6 October transit with and &quot;Doyle&quot; in company. On 5 November 1990, as &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was anchored in Valparaíso, Frente Patriótico Manuel Rodríguez guerrillas detonated a bomb inside the restaurant Max und Moritz, in the seaside resort of Viña del Mar, wounding three of her sailors.

&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;″s maiden Western Pacific deployment came unexpectedly on 28 May 1991 in response to Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm. The ship had the staffs of Commander, Carrier Group Three, Rear Admiral Timothy W. Wright, and Destroyer Squadron 9 embarked, as well as Carrier Air Wing Eleven. She was accompanied by a seven-ship battle group.

While heading towards the Indian Ocean, the ship was diverted to support evacuation operations after Mount Pinatubo erupted on Luzon Island in the Philippines. In support of Operation Fiery Vigil, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; led a 23-ship armada that moved over 45,000 people from the Subic Bay Naval Station to the port of Cebu in the Visayas. It was the largest peacetime evacuation of active military personnel and their families in history. One baby was born onboard &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; during the evacuation; his mother named him Abraham Lincoln Prestera. After Fiery Vigil, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; steamed toward the Persian Gulf, to run reconnaissance and combat air patrols in Iraq and Kuwait, assisting allied and US troops involved with Desert Storm. In early 1992, the ship was at Naval Air Station Alameda on Ship&#x27;s Restricted Availability for minor maintenance and refitting.

From June 1993, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was the flagship of Commander, Carrier Group Three. In October 1993, the carrier was ordered to the coast of Somalia to assist United Nations humanitarian operations. For four weeks, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; flew air patrols over Mogadishu in support of Operation Restore Hope.

&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was the first Pacific Fleet carrier to integrate female aviators into the crew after the Combat Exclusion Laws were lifted on 28 April 1993. The ship left San Diego on 24 October 1994, to begin refresher training. The next day, Lieutenant Kara Spears Hultgreen, the first female F-14 Tomcat pilot, died when her plane crashed into the sea. Her F-14 suffered a compressor stall as she made her final approach, losing power to one of the engines. She aborted the landing to the best of her ability in an effort to prevent a collision with the aft end of the ship, and the plane inverted and went into the ocean. Radar intercept officer Lieutenant Matthew Klemish ejected safely from the plane and was rescued from the water minutes later. Hultgreen, who was automatically ejected 0.4 seconds after Klemish, rocketed straight into the ocean and was instantly killed. Her body, still strapped in the ejection seat, was recovered 19 days later.

In February 1995, while maneuvering in fog off San Diego, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; accidentally entered the racing area for the 1995 Louis Vuitton Cup, causing a yacht race in progress to be cancelled.

&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;″s third deployment began in April 1995 when she was sent to the Persian Gulf and took part in Operation Southern Watch and in Operation Vigilant Sentinel. During an underway replenishment, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was run into by , when the latter had steering difficulties due to a split rudder, impacting &quot;Sacramento&quot;″s port side, crushing the M-frames, partially crushing a female crew berthing area, and punching a large hole in &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;″s superstructure (TACAN room). &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was able to continue on with her mission, while &quot;Sacramento&quot; had to dock at Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates, for several weeks for repair.

&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; began a fourth deployment in June 1998. Once again, the ship headed for the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch. &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; carrier battle group the Meritorious Unit Commendation ribbon.

=== 2000s ===
The carrier&#x27;s fifth deployment commenced in August 2000, when &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; again traveled to the Persian Gulf in support of Southern Watch. On this deployment, the carrier, air wing, and battle group ships earned the Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation. The ship earned the Arleigh Burke Award as the most improved command in the Pacific Fleet.

&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was in port on 11 September 2001. The carrier was put to sea on 20 July 2002 to support Operation Enduring Freedom. She took up station once more in support of Operation Southern Watch before taking a port visit to Perth, Western Australia. During this time, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was ordered to the Persian Gulf to take part in Operation Iraqi Freedom. This forced the Navy to extend &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;″s stay from 20 January to 6 May 2003. The news of this extension was delivered to the ship&#x27;s crew on New Year&#x27;s morning, by the then battle group commander, Rear Admiral Kelly, with the phrase, &quot;We don&#x27;t need to be home holding our loved ones, we need to be here holding the line. Get over it!&quot;. The term &quot;Get over it&quot; became a running joke aboard ship, which eventually led to a deployment patch made aboard that read &quot;Westpac 2003 CVN-72 CVW-14 GET OVER IT&quot;, with an image intended to depict an admiral kicking a sailor in the groin.

&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; and the carrier battle group and air wing helped deliver the opening salvos and air strikes in Operation Iraqi Freedom. During the air wing&#x27;s deployment, some 16,500 sorties were flown and 1.6 million pounds of ordnance were used. Sea Control Squadron 35 (VS-35), the &quot;Blue Wolves&quot;, was instrumental in delivering over of fuel to these strike aircraft, one of the largest aerial refueling undertakings by a carrier aviation squadron in history.

The carrier returned home in May 2003, in the process receiving a visit from President George W. Bush before officially ending &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;″s deployment by docking at San Diego before returning to homeport in Everett, Washington. Bush stated at the time that this was the end to major combat operations in Iraq. While this statement did coincide with an end to the conventional phase of the war, Bush&#x27;s assertion—and a sign displayed during his visit—became controversial after guerrilla warfare in Iraq increased during the Iraqi insurgency. The vast majority of casualties, both military and civilian, occurred after the speech.

The White House said their services constructed the banner. As explained by Commander Conrad Chun, a Navy spokesman, &quot;The banner was a Navy idea, the ship&#x27;s idea. The idea popped up in one of the meetings aboard the ship preparing for her homecoming and thought it would be good to have a banner, &#x27;Mission Accomplished.&#x27; The sailors then asked if the White House could get the sign made. The banner signified the successful completion of the ship&#x27;s deployment,&quot; Cmdr. Chun continued, noting that &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was deployed 290 days, longer than any other nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in history. This record was broken in 2020.


In June 2004, following a ten-month docking period, the ship put to sea for the start of working up prior to deployment. During this period, a film crew was hosted aboard to produce scenes for the film &quot;Stealth&quot;, which included the presence of a full-scale model of a fictional aircraft, the F/A-37 Talon, that would feature as operating from the carrier. On 1 October 2004, the carrier&#x27;s controlling formation was re-designated from Cruiser-Destroyer Group Three to Carrier Strike Group Nine. &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; departed for her next voyage on 15 October 2004.

The carrier was on a port call in Hong Kong when the 9.0-magnitude 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake struck southern Asia on 26 December 2004. To help with the international relief effort and assist with search and rescue efforts already underway, Carrier Strike Group 9, lead by &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; deployed to the hard-hit western coast of Sumatra and Aceh in Indonesia to provide humanitarian assistance as part of Operation Unified Assistance. &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;″s Air Transportation Office coordinated the flow of supplies into the region, and the carrier provided air traffic control for the relief effort. Sailors from &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;s Engineering Department Repair Division designed a potable water manifold to help bring fresh water to Aceh Province, Sumatra, with the system beginning to ship the much-needed fresh water on 4 January.

In total, Carrier Strike Group Three delivered of relief and humanitarian supplies, including of food and of medical supplies, during Operation Unified Assistance. Carrier Strike Group Three received the Humanitarian Service Medal in recognition of its humanitarian assistance/disaster response (HA/DR) efforts during the OUA mission.

In mid-January 2005, the carrier left Indonesian waters after the Indonesian government refused to allow fighter pilots assigned to &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; to conduct air patrols and training flights. By law, US carrier-based pilots must practice at least once every two to three weeks to remain &quot;fit&quot;, otherwise they are grounded. Despite the move into international waters, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; continued to provide support to the region until 4 February. During the carrier&#x27;s 33 days on station, she, along with her battle group, Carrier Strike Group Nine delivered 5.7 million pounds of relief supplies. The 17 helicopters assigned to HSL-47 Saberhawks and HS-2 &quot;Golden Falcons&quot;, attached to CVW-2 flew 1,747 relief missions along the western coast of Sumatra. The carrier&#x27;s departure coincided with the arrival of the hospital ship .

Between 7 March and 27 May 2005, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; underwent a docking planned incremental availability yard overhaul at Naval Station Everett, Washington, and following subsequent sustainment training, the carrier underwent an additional planned incremental availability at NS Everett between 28 June and 26 August 2005. Between 1 and 23 June 2005, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; and Carrier Air Wing Two (CVW-2) trained in the northern Pacific, conducting their quarterly Integrated Strike Group (ISG) Sustainment Training cycle.

&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; carried out surge sustainment training for the Fleet Response Plan, fleet replacement squadron carrier qualifications, and Joint Task Force Exercise 2005 in southern Californian waters between 19 October and 16 November 2005. For JTFEX-05, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; and Carrier Air Wing Two were joined by the guided-missile cruiser ; the guided-missile destroyers and , and Carrier Strike Group Seven led by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier .

On 18 December 2006, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; left the dry dock at the shipyard ahead of schedule and under budget. The Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility completed ship tank maintenance in less than half the scheduled time. In 89 days, 18 tanks were completed. The Tank Value Stream Team achieved this by partnering with Ship&#x27;s Force and the &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; Project Team. While in dry dock, the whole ship was painted by the crew at nights and on weekends rather than waiting for contractors to do the job.

On 5 January 2006, the carrier &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; departed her homeport of Everett and transited to San Diego, California, for a scheduled underway period to undertake sustainment training exercises and post-refit inspection by the US Navy&#x27;s Board of Inspection and Survey which were completed from 21 to 24 February.

On 29 August 2006, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; arrived at Naval Base Kitsap in Bremerton, Washington, and on 8 September 2006, the carrier entered Dry Dock No. 6 at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility to begin a scheduled Docked Planned Incremental Availability (DPIA) yard maintenance period. Major projects for this DPIA included the refurbishment of ship tanks, work on three of the four catapults, modernization of navigation systems, resurfacing of the flight deck, and updates to the ship&#x27;s local area network. &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; also received installation of the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile system, which improved the ship&#x27;s close-range defensive capabilities. On 18 December 2008, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; left dry dock ahead of schedule and under budget because the PSNS and IMF yard teams were able to cut the time of ship tank maintenance by more than half, completing 18 tanks in 89 days.

The aircraft carrier &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; held a fast cruise from the pier from 23 to 25 June and left Puget Sound on 26 June to conduct sea trials before returning to her homeport of Naval Station Everett on 30 June 2007. &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; underwent flight deck carrier qualifications while sailing in southern Californian waters 12–15 July . F/A-18E Super Hornets and F/A-18C Hornets from strike squadrons VFA-137 and VFA-151 joined VX-23 test pilots performed precision approach drills to ensure that the ship&#x27;s equipment, such as the Precision Approach Landing System, operated within close tolerances, with SH-60B Seahawks from squadron HS-2 providing search and rescue capabilities during flight operations.

On 20 August, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; and embarked Carrier Air Wing Two completed their 25-day Tailored Ship&#x27;s Training Availability (TSTA) and Final Evaluation Problem (FEP) training period off southern California. TSTA is designed to prepare the ship and crew for full integration into a carrier strike group, and FEP is a graded 48-hour evolution to evaluate how well the units learned during TSTA. &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; and embarked CVW-2 aircraft conducted over 1,000 fixed-wing sorties. &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; completed five replenishments-at-sea evolutions, including two with the fleet replenishment oiler , and participated in 18 general quarters (GQ) drills. Also, on 13 August, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; tested her defensive capabilities when she fired four RIM-7P NATO Sea Sparrow missiles, with two of them at BQM-74E Chukar remote-operated aerial target drones. Carrier Strike Group Nine&#x27;s Composite Unit Training Exercise featured 24 sailors from Mobile Security Squadron 2 (MSRON-2), Helicopter Visit, Board, Search and Seizure Team 1, a first for West Coast-based U.S. Navy ships. MSRON-2 Team 1 specializes in boarding noncompliant ships at sea in the dead of night, detaining the crew if necessary, and identifying suspected terrorists or subjects of interest, using the element of surprise afforded by helicopter insertion, night vision equipment, and state-of-the-art biometrics. MSRON-2 Team 1 was established in 2004 at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia, and it was the first team of its kind to reach operational status.

Also, on 11 November 2007, an HH-60H Seahawk helicopter from squadron HS-2 crashed while operating from the ship about from San Diego. Rescuers successfully pulled all seven crewmembers from the water.

Between 3 and 30 January 2008, Carrier Strike Group Nine conducted anti-submarine exercises and Joint Task Force Exercise 03-08 (JTFEx 03–08) off southern California. On 16 January, Secretary of the Navy Donald C. Winter visited &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;. On 20 January, a NATO Boeing E-3A Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft was deployed from NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen, Germany, with a multinational crew aboard for JTFEx 03–08, defended Carrier Strike Group Nine from a simulated air attack (30 January).

&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; began a planned incremental availability maintenance cycle at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, on 16 April 2009. The objective of this cycle is to refurbish &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;″s shipboard system to meet the anticipated 50-year service life of the ship, including an upgraded local area network system. Beginning 1 December, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; began daily flying squad, general quarters, and integrated training team drills in preparation for her first underway period following the ship&#x27;s current maintenance cycle.

=== 2010 ===
On 13 January 2010, the carrier completed upgrades and repair that cost $250 million at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. The carrier was to be assigned to Carrier Strike Group Nine. On 3 February 2011, the ship was awarded the Battle Effectiveness Award for high standards of excellence and combat readiness.

On 9 December 2010, the US Navy officially announced that Naval Station Everett, Washington, was the new homeport for , replacing &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, which would be undergoing a scheduled refueling and complex overhaul (RCOH) at the Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding-Newport News shipyard in Virginia, which is slated to begin in 2013.

=== 2011 ===

On 1 March 2011, the news media reported that the US Navy had awarded Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding-Newport News a US$206.7 million option under a previously awarded contract to plan &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;″s RCOH. The planning contract covered the design, documentation, engineering, advanced material procurement, inspections, fabrication, and support work for &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;″s RCOH, with more than 1,000 employees supporting this planning phase. Additional funding for the RCOH was pending the passage of the U.S. Department of Defense&#x27;s Fiscal Year 2011 budget appropriations by the U.S. Congress. Upon authorization, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;″s RCOH was anticipated to begin in 2013, and is scheduled to take between three and four years to complete at an estimated overall cost of US$3 billion.

On 1 August, the US Navy announced that &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; would shift homeport from Everett to Newport News for a scheduled RCOH in August 2012. The ship departed Everett for the deployment that would take the carrier around the world to Newport News in December 2011.

=== 2012 ===
From 6–10 January 2012, accompanied by guided missile cruiser , &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; visited the Gulf of Thailand port of Laem Chabang. During the visit, Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia provided husbanding services, for which the Navy was billed $884,000. In November 2013, federal prosecutors charged that the Navy had been overbilled more than $500,000.

On 22 January, the US Navy announced that &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; had entered the Persian Gulf &quot;without incident.&quot; The deployment through the Straits of Hormuz came at a time of escalating tensions with Iran. &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, accompanied by a strike group of warships, was the first U.S. aircraft carrier to enter the Persian Gulf since late December 2011 and was on a &quot;routine rotation&quot; to replace the outgoing . The departure of &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; prompted Iranian army chief Ataollah Salehi to threaten action if another carrier passed back into the Persian Gulf, saying, &quot;I recommend and emphasize to the American carrier not to return to the Persian Gulf. ... We are not in the habit of warning more than once,&quot; The US dismissed the warning.

In June, the actors, crew and producers of the film, &quot;Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter&quot; attended an unconventional preview screening for the over eighteen hundred sailors aboard the namesake vessel of the 16th president. The event marked the first time a major motion picture had its debut screening for troops deployed in the Middle East.

&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; transited the Suez Canal northbound on 16 July and the Strait of Gibraltar on 26 July en route to the United States. On 7 August, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; arrived at Norfolk Naval Station following an eight-month deployment to the US Navy&#x27;s 5th, 6th and 7th Fleet areas of responsibility, in preparation for the Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH) at Newport News.

=== 2013 ===
On 8 February 2013, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that the scheduled mid-life Refueling and Complex Overhaul intended for &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; would be postponed pending the resolution of the upcoming budget sequestration. This budget shortfall would not only affect &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;″s refueling of her nuclear propulsion plant, but it would also delay the next scheduled mid-life complex overhaul involving forward-based in Yokosuka, Japan, as well as the de-fueling of the recently deactivated . By March 2013 Naval ship maintenance and overhaul budget issues had been addressed enough such that &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;″s RCOH had been confirmed and the ship was made ready to tow over to Newport News Shipbuilding. By mid-March she had been towed over and docked, and the RCOH work had begun.

=== 2014 ===
On 3 October 2014, Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding said that its workers had transferred a 30-ton anchor from &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the Navy&#x27;s first and oldest nuclear carrier, to be installed aboard &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; during that week. The transfer was a result of an anchor replacement on &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; coinciding with the withdrawal of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, preserving the anchor rather than it being scrapped with the rest of the ship.

=== 2017 ===

On 9 May 2017, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; got underway for sea trials, following the four-year refueling and complex overhaul. More than 2.5 million man-hours of work were conducted aboard the ship, including refueling the reactors, upgrading ship&#x27;s infrastructure and modernizing combat systems and air wing capabilities to increase combat effectiveness. On 12 May, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was redelivered to the fleet. On 8 September &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was deployed with and to provide aid to Florida following the Hurricane Irma disaster. The vessels joined already on station.

=== 2018 ===
On 2 August 2018, it was announced that &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; would return to San Diego as part of a home port shift for three carriers, thus returning her to the Pacific Fleet. At the end of August, VFA-125 began operating from &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; as an integrated part of CVW-7, the first time that the F-35C had operated integrated cyclic operations, simulating the full spectrum of planned operations.

Also in August, a movie crew was aboard filming flight deck operations and flying sequences for the sequel &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot; off the coast of Virginia.

=== 2019 ===
On 1 April 2019, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; and Carrier Strike Group 12 departed Norfolk for a six-month deployment that will end with a shifting of homeport to San Diego. On 9 April she arrived in the United States Sixth Fleet area of operations, where she would operate in the Mediterranean Sea before proceeding to the Persian Gulf, then the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, before heading across the Pacific Ocean to her new homeport in San Diego. On 23 April, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was reported to have operated simultaneously along with &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; in the Mediterranean Sea, the two carrier strike groups&#x27; operations including more than 130 aircraft, 10 ships, and 9,000 sailors and marines, according to the press release published by the U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa/US 6th Fleet. The operations were observed from the aircraft carrier by U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman and Admiral James Foggo, commander, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa and Joint Force Command Naples. While aboard, Huntsman said: &quot;Diplomatic communication and dialogue coupled with the strong defense these ships provide demonstrate to Russia that if it truly seeks better relations with the United States, it must cease its destabilizing activities around the world.&quot; On 5 May this deployment was diverted to the Middle East due to tensions with Iran and headed to the Persian Gulf. Her transit was expedited by omitting a port visit to Split, Croatia.

In October, it was revealed that &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;″s Middle East deployment would be extended due to an electrical malfunction on .

=== 2020 ===

=== 2022 ===
On 4 January, Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314 (VMFA-314) became the first Marine Corps F-35C squadron to be deployed on an aircraft carrier.

On 21 May, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; steamed into Tokyo Bay to relieve USS &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;. The &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; carrier strike group was scheduled to participate in RIMPAC 2022.

On 21 September, the water onboard was discovered to be contaminated. Various reports were made to the chain of command onboard but the commanding officer, Captain Bauernschmidt, did not inform the crew until the following day, almost 24 hours after initial reports were made. Reports continued throughout the evening, but actions by the engineering staff did little. The contaminated tank was even reintroduced back into service after being taken offline earlier in the day. Test reports of seven water samples revealed the presence of &quot;E. coli&quot;. Upon receipt of the test results, Captain Bauernschimdt told the crew of the contamination followed by, &quot;before anybody starts freaking out, E. coli is an extremely common bacteria. Matter of fact, every single person on this ship has it in their digestive system right now.&quot;

On 11 November, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; hosted a college basketball game on her deck between Gonzaga University and Michigan State University, won 64–63 by Gonzaga. The carrier suffered a minor fire that injured nine sailors on 29 November. The cause is unknown and an investigation was launched.

=== 2024 ===
On 2 August, the &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; carrier strike group was ordered by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to relieve operating in the Gulf of Oman, joining other US naval forces in the region as a deterrent against potential Iranian aggression against Israel. On 21 August, the U.S. Central Command announced that the vessel had arrived in the Middle East. Austin had ordered her to speed up in order to help Israel in case of a potential attack from Iran.

On 9 November Marine F-35Cs from &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; carried out strikes on the Houthi movement in Yemen in the context of the Red Sea crisis.

<doc id="199109" wikidata="Q303755" url="?curid=199109" title="Spanish aircraft carrier Príncipe de Asturias">
<text>Príncipe de Asturias, originally named &quot;Almirante Carrero Blanco&quot;, was a light aircraft carrier and former flagship of the Spanish Navy. She was built in Bazán&#x27;s Shipyards and delivered to the Spanish Navy on 30 May 1988.

Spain has operated aircraft carriers since the 1920s, initially with the seaplane tender and later the multi-role light carrier , which was formerly the US Navy&#x27;s World War II light carrier USS &quot;Cabot&quot;. &quot;Dédalo&quot; was replaced as the navy&#x27;s fleet flagship by &quot;Príncipe de Asturias&quot;.

The ship was permanently assigned to the Alpha Group, comprising the carrier and six s (a Spanish version of the USN ). Other vessels such as logistic ships, tankers and corvettes were frequently assigned to the Group when required. &quot;Príncipe de Asturias&quot; and the Alpha Group frequently participated in peace support operations in the Adriatic Sea.

The ship was retired due to defence cuts, being officially decommissioned on 6 February 2013.

Several countries had reportedly expressed interest in buying &quot;Príncipe de Asturias&quot; before it was dismantled. Indonesia reportedly showed interest, but then decided not to buy. Unconfirmed sources also indicate the Philippines, several Arab countries, and Angola had expressed interest in purchasing the Principe de Asturias.
In September 2017 it was announced that the &quot;Príncipe de Asturias&quot; was bought by a Turkish company planning to scrap the vessel.

==Design==
The design of &quot;Principe de Asturias&quot; was based on that of the US Navy&#x27;s 1970s Sea Control Ship concept. This was a proposal for a small through deck vessel, capable of operating helicopters and a small number of STOVL fixed-wing aircraft, to provide anti-submarine defence for convoys in the event of war with the Soviet Union. While the concept never got off the drawing board for the United States, Spain took an interest in it in the early 1980s when seeking a replacement for its veteran carrier, &quot;Dédalo&quot;. The design underwent a number of modifications, most prominently being fitted with a ski-jump ramp, allowing its fixed-wing aircraft to launch with improved loads, as well as other modifications to fit Spanish specifications. Constructed by the National Company Bazan (then Empresa Nacional Bazán, now Navantia) in their shipyard at Ferrol, &quot;Príncipe de Asturias&quot; was delivered to the Navy on 30 May 1988. The construction process had begun eleven years previously, on 29 May 1977. The processing of the steel began on 1 March 1978 and the keel was laid on 8 October 1979. On 22 May 1982, in a ceremony presided over by Juan Carlos I of Spain, the launch took place, with Queen Sofía of Spain as the ship&#x27;s sponsor. The ship made her first sea trials in November 1987.

The Thai warship , delivered in 1997, is based on the Spanish ship&#x27;s design.

==Armament==
The self-defense armament includes four close defense Meroka systems and six chaff decoy launchers. For offensive weapons, the ship relies on the capabilities of her embarked aircraft. For anti-submarine defense, she relies upon the detection capacity and attacks of her ASW helicopters and accompanying frigate battle group.

==Aircraft==
The ship supports 12 AV-8B Harrier II Bravo or AV-8B Harrier II Plus aircraft. The carrier also has facilities to support helicopters, usually 6 Sikorsky Sea King SH-3H, 4 Agusta-Bell AB-212 and 2 Sikorsky SH-3 AEW (Airborne Early Warning) helicopters.

The ship supports a maximum of 29 fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft with up to 12 on deck and 17 aircraft in the hangar. The hangar which measures 2,398 m2 is accessed by two flight deck lifts. The flight deck is in length. Operating V/STOL aircraft, the carrier has the characteristic &quot;ski-jump&quot; (12° here), with the runway sightly off the longitudinal axis, tilted portside.

==Withdrawal==
In May 2012 rumours emerged that &quot;Príncipe de Asturias&quot; could be withdrawn from active service and placed in a state of &quot;restrictive standby&quot; along with two of the &quot;Santa Maria&quot;-class frigates, due to the financial pressures on the Spanish government. Annual operating costs for the carrier and its air group reached €100 million. Any decision on the fate of the vessel would have to be taken at the highest possible level due to the status of the ship as the flagship of the Spanish Navy.

In November 2012, her decommissioning was confirmed. The official decommissioning ceremony was held on 6 February 2013. Aviation capability is being provided by the landing helicopter dock ship &quot;Juan Carlos I&quot;.She was scrapped at Aliağa on 29 August 2017.

<text>Littlehampton is a town, seaside resort and civil parish in the Arun District of West Sussex, England. It lies on the English Channel on the eastern bank of the mouth of the River Arun. It is south south-west of London, west of Brighton and east of Chichester.

The parish covers an area of . The suburban area of the town has a population of approximately 55,000. The conurbation includes other settlements: Wick in the north west; Lyminster to the north; and Rustington to the east. Wick and Toddington, which has a large business park, became part of the town in 1901. Nearby towns include Bognor Regis to the west and Worthing to the east.

The town is also the westernmost settlement of the 15th largest urban area in England and Wales, the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation, a region encompassing 474,485 people (2011 census). The South Downs National Park commences north of the town: Littlehampton links to Amberley and Arundel by footpaths and railway as well as by roads.

==History==
A human settlement at Littlehampton can be traced back to prehistoric and Roman times, while it appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as the hamlet of &#x27;Hantone&#x27;. The settlement is believed to have been a fishing community around this time, appearing on a French map in around 1100 as &#x27;Hanton&#x27;. The settlement is then believed to have been given to the Abbey of St Martin de Seez in Normandy, who owned Littlehampton until around 1400. The area then passed back to the ownership of successive Earls of Arundel and Dukes of Norfolk, whose successors still reside in Arundel today.

Littlehampton began to develop as a port as a result of constant silting of the River Arun, perhaps leading to the prefix of &#x27;Little&#x27; being added to &#x27;Hampton&#x27;, in order to distinguish it from the larger Southampton further along the coast. The expansion of port activities led to a new river mouth being cut in 1735, alongside the building of a wooden harbour. At this time it was also known as &quot;Arundel Port&quot;.

As the eighteenth century progressed, the town developed from a fishing community to a holiday destination, with Lord Byron, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Constable all believed to have spent time there.

The town&#x27;s status as both a port and a holiday resort led to economic success in the nineteenth century, with a railway line and a cross-channel ferry to Honfleur in France being introduced. The population of the town grew tenfold over the century, from 584 in 1801 to 5,954 in 1901. Littlehampton remained as a holiday resort in the twentieth century, becoming known as &#x27;The Children&#x27;s Paradise&#x27; in the 1920s.

Post-war Littlehampton saw much house building on the outskirts of the town, eventually absorbing the villages of Wick, Lyminster and Toddington, while the commercial element of the town became increasingly focused on boat building and water sports. In 1967, the town attracted attention by becoming the base for the first &quot;Blue Peter&quot; lifeboat.

==Economy==
The world headquarters of The Body Shop is situated towards the north of the town, and is a major employer in the area.

A local company, Dando Drilling International Ltd, founded in 1867, has been exporting drilling rigs from Littlehampton since 1868. Van Heyningen Brothers (VHB) salad growers was a major employer in the town from 1964 to 2003.

==Governance and politics==

Littlehampton lies within the parliamentary constituency of Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, the Member of Parliament (MP) for which is Conservative Alison Griffiths.

At a local government level, Littlehampton is part of Littlehampton Town Council, Arun District Council and West Sussex County Council. Littlehampton currently has 10 seats on the district council, spread across five wards – Beach, Brookfield, Ham, River and Wick with Toddington. At the district elections held in May 2011, the Conservatives won 7 of these 10 seats, Labour 2 and the Liberal Democrats 1. On West Sussex county council, the town is represented by two Conservatives and a Liberal Democrat.

==Education==
Littlehampton has one secondary school, The Littlehampton Academy, which opened in 2009, replacing the Littlehampton Community School.

For younger children there are five primary schools — Lyminster, River Beach, St. Catherine&#x27;s, White Meadows and Georgian Gardens. In 2011, following a major reorganisation of primary school provision in the town, six separate junior and infant schools were replaced with four primary schools. River Beach Primary was formed from the merging of Connaught Junior with Arun Vale and Elm Grove Infants schools, whilst the merger of Flora McDonald Junior and Wickbourne Infants schools brought about the creation of White Meadows. Lyminster existed before the reorganisation as an infant school and has now begun a phased expansion to become a primary school, whilst St. Catherine&#x27;s existed before the reorganistaion as a primary school.

==Transport==

Littlehampton is on the A259, though this bypasses most of the town. Littlehampton is connected to the A27 south coast trunk road by the A284, which also provides the main north–south route out of the town and links to the A29 and A24. The A27 also later links with the M27. The A280 also links Littlehampton to the A24 and is a main route from the north-east.

Littlehampton is served by three railway stations: Littlehampton, Angmering and Ford.

Train services from Littlehampton are provided by Southern with direct services to Brighton, London Victoria, Gatwick Airport, East Croydon, Bognor Regis, Chichester, Portsmouth and Southampton.

The Littlehampton Ferry links the east and west banks of the Arun. The ferry operates from 31 March to 30 September between 10am and 5pm, although has been closed in recent years due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The ferry company also provided harbour tours.

Gatwick Airport is an hour away to the north, Southampton Airport is an hour and a half away to the west, Chichester/Goodwood Airport is 30 minutes also to the west and Shoreham Airport is 45 minutes to the east. The Port of Dover and the Channel Tunnel about three hours to the east; Portsmouth Harbour an hour to the west and the Port of Newhaven about an hour to the east.

Littlehampton has a number of bus routes operated by Compass Travel and Stagecoach South. The bus station at Littlehampton handles anything up to 1,000 passengers a day.

Littlehampton also has a small number of taxis, with taxi ranks all over the town and four different taxi companies.

==Littlehampton Port==
Littlehampton&#x27;s port is based around the River Arun, which opens onto the English Channel. A small stretch of this, 5 miles out to sea and 6 miles wide, is locally known as the &quot;Littlehampton Channel&quot;. Littlehampton started as a fishing port but now is a thriving port for thousands of leisure craft which visit from all over the UK and Europe. In 2009, use of leisure craft at Littlehampton rose to the extent that at least 200 more moorings were required.

Littlehampton is also a commercial port, handling around 50–60 ships a year from Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and France with cargo including marine aggregates, stone, marble chippings and timber. From the early 1920s David Hillyard built yachts in Littlehampton, and the company of David Hillyard Ltd continued here until 2009, producing a total of over 850 yachts.

==Commerce and tourism==

===The East Beach Cafe===
The East Beach Cafe, designed by Heatherwick Studio, opened on the seafront of Littlehampton&#x27;s east beach in July 2007.

The building is a fully welded monocoque structure, reflecting its exposed location with a rough, weathered appearance, which Heatherwick describes as being like a piece of weathered flotsam swept up onto the beach. It was built in Littlehampton, with steelwork by Littlehampton Welding Ltd and site work by Langridge Developments, another local firm.

===The Longest Bench===

Littlehampton is home to Britain&#x27;s longest bench. The bench was designed by Studio Weave, a London-based architecture practice and opened in mid-July 2010. It was designed based on initial ideas by children from Littlehampton&#x27;s Connaught Junior school and was funded by Anita Roddick&#x27;s husband Gordon and from a CABE grant from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

The bench is a continuous structure stretching 324 metres along the majority of Littlehampton&#x27;s east beach promenade and is constructed of tropical hardwood slats reclaimed from coastal groynes and landfill. The bench is described by Studio Weave as &quot;a charm bracelet gifted to the town as a delicate piece of jewellery that can accommodate new and varied additions. The form of the bracelet&#x27;s chain is informed by the simple seaside boardwalk together with some maths that envisages movement.&quot;

===Look and Sea Centre===
The Look and Sea centre includes the Harbour Lights café and an observation tower.

===Harbour Park===
Harbour Park is at the entrance of the River Arun with two restaurants, two arcades, a rollercoaster, log flume and other attractions.

===Boat trips===
A number of operators offer services out of Littlehampton harbour with ferry services across the river, sight seeing trips around the harbour, to Arundel, Brighton, Chichester and the Isle of Wight and speed boat rides to Worthing Pier, the Southampton Power Boat Show, Lymington Power Boat Show and to Cowes and Torquay for the Cowes to Torquay power boat race.

===Norfolk Gardens===
Norfolk Gardens, a multi-purpose outdoor site operated by Tivoli Lifestyle, is further along the promenade. The site includes a 9-hole pitch and putt course, a refurbished 9-hole adventure golf course renamed Buccaneer Bay, tennis and bowls, and a café.

The Littlehampton Miniature Railway runs for 800 yards from Norfolk Gardens to Mewsbrook Park and is the oldest 12¼&quot; (311mm) gauge railway in the UK.

Littlehampton harbour (see also Littlehampton Port above) is on the River Arun at the western side of the town, with yacht moorings. Also on the west bank of the river are Littlehampton Redoubt and Climping sand dunes.

== Public services ==

Littlehampton lifeboat station is one of the UK&#x27;s busiest RNLI Lifeboat stations. As well as providing local search and rescue coverage, volunteer crew members also provided humanitarian help during flooding in East Pakistan over 35 years ago. The lifeboat station operates two boats: an Atlantic 85 class lifeboat, &quot;Renee Sherman&quot; (B-891) and a D Class Lifeboat, &quot;Ray of Hope&quot; (D-769). The Arun class of lifeboats (in service 1971–2008) take their name from the Arun river, which comes to a head at Littlehampton, however no Arun-class lifeboats have been stationed at the station. Until the retiring of the Atlantic 75 class lifeboat, &quot;Blue Peter 1&quot; (B-779) in 2016, Littlehampton lifeboat station had operated a lifeboat funded by viewers of the BBC television programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot; since 1967. 
Littlehampton&#x27;s police station is situated just outside the town centre with a CID building and the head major incidents unit in West Sussex adjoining. There was also an ambulance station adjacent to the police station, although it&#x27;s not in use.

Littlehampton&#x27;s fire station, which is near the town centre, maintains two water-tender ladders. The station has a full-time immediate response appliance, with the second appliance covered by on-call retained firefighters. There is another fire station in East Preston with one water-tender ladder and a Red cross support unit.

Littlehampton&#x27;s hospital was demolished in 2005, since then its replacement has been under debate at a local and national level. Neighbouring Rustington has Zachary Merton Hospital, which lacks an Emergency department. It has 31 beds and other clinics. The Fitzalan Medical Group has two surgeries in Littlehampton, including the headquarters surgery just outside the town centre and one in Wick.

== Sport and Leisure==

===Rugby Union===
Littlehampton Rugby Club plays in the Sussex Intermediate League, National Level 10, after promotion at the end of the 2010–11 season. Most games are played on Saturday or Sunday afternoon, either at The Littlehampton Academy or in the West/East Sussex area. The club is also involved in the local community, including the carnival, bonfire night, dragon boat racing and other charitable events.

===Army Cadet Force===
Littlehampton is home to a detachment of the Sussex Army Cadet Force, a volunteer youth organisation, sponsored by the Ministry of Defence, which accepts cadets aged between 12 and 18 years of age.

== Fossils ==
The flints that make up Littlehampton&#x27;s West Beach contain quite a few fossils. The flints are formed by silica from sea sponges and diatoms from around 60 to 95 million years ago. Some of the creatures become fossilised and can be seen as patterns on the outside of the flint. These are known locally as Shepherds crowns. The Littlehampton Museum occasionally organises fossil hunting walks during the school holidays.

<doc id="199115" wikidata="Q17004659" url="?curid=199115" title="Finlandia hymn">
<text>The &quot;Finlandia&quot; hymn () refers to a serene hymn-like section of the patriotic symphonic poem &quot;Finlandia&quot;, written in 1899 and 1900 by the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius. It was later re-worked by the composer into a stand-alone piece. With words written in 1940 by Veikko Antero Koskenniemi, it is one of the most important national songs of Finland. Although not the official national anthem of Finland, it has been continuously proposed as such.

Other major uses of the tune include several Christian hymns and other national songs.

==Finnish national song==
After the success of the full-length symphonic poem (most of which consists of rousing and turbulent passages, evoking the national struggle of the Finnish people), Sibelius published a stand-alone version of the hymn as the last of twelve numbers in his &quot;Masonic Ritual Music&quot;, Op. 113, with a text by opera singer Wäinö Sola. The version usually heard today has lyrics written by Koskenniemi in 1940 and was first performed in 1941. Sibelius himself arranged the hymn for choral performances. Today, during modern performances of &quot;Finlandia&quot; in its entirety, a choir is sometimes involved, singing the Finnish lyrics with the hymn section.

The &quot;Finlandia&quot; hymn is often proposed as an official national song or anthem of Finland. 
==International anthem==

In 1934, Lloyd Stone wrote &quot;This is my song&quot;, to the &quot;Finlandia&quot; tune, as an international song of peace. An expanded version with Christian themes by a later author appears in many hymnals.

Conductor Leopold Stokowski proposed using the melody for a worldwide anthem.

==Christian hymns==

Other words commonly set to the tune include some Christian hymns. Among those in widespread use across English-speaking denominations are &quot;Be still, my soul&quot; and &quot;We rest on Thee, our shield and our defender&quot;.

===&quot;Be still, my soul&quot;===
The Christian hymn &quot;Be still, my soul&quot;, written in German &quot;(&quot;Stille mein Wille, dein Jesus hilft siegen&quot;)&quot; in 1752 by the Lutheran hymnwriter Catharina von Schlegel (1697–1768) and translated into English in 1855 by Jane Laurie Borthwick (1813–1897), is usually sung to this tune. It begins:

===&quot;We rest on Thee&quot;===
The hymn &quot;We rest on Thee&quot;, written by Edith G. Cherry around 1895, is also commonly sung to the tune. Its first verse is:

==Other uses==
The tune was adopted for Biafra&#x27;s national anthem, &quot;Land of the Rising Sun&quot;, during its attempted secession from Nigeria in the late 1960s.
On a smaller scale it also serves as the tune for the songs of various colleges and schools.

<doc id="199116" wikidata="Q106618" url="?curid=199116" title="Henry Campbell-Bannerman">
<text>Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman (né Campbell; 7 September 183622 April 1908) was a British statesman and Liberal Party politician who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1905 to 1908 and Leader of the Liberal Party from 1899 to 1908. He also was Secretary of State for War twice, in the cabinets of Gladstone and Rosebery. He was the first First Lord of the Treasury to be officially called the &quot;Prime Minister&quot;, the term only coming into official usage five days after he took office. He remains the only person to date to hold the positions of Prime Minister and Father of the House at the same time, and the last Liberal leader to gain a UK parliamentary majority.

Known colloquially as &quot;CB&quot;, Campbell-Bannerman firmly believed in free trade, Irish Home Rule and the improvement of social conditions, including reduced working hours. A. J. A. Morris, in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, called him &quot;Britain&#x27;s first and only Radical prime minister&quot;. Following a general-election defeat in 1900, Campbell-Bannerman went on to lead the Liberal Party to a landslide victory over the Conservative Party at the 1906 general election – the last election in which the Liberals gained an overall majority in the House of Commons. The government he subsequently led passed legislation to ensure trade unions could not be liable for damages incurred during strike action, introduced free school meals for all children, and empowered local authorities to purchase agricultural land from private landlords. Campbell-Bannerman resigned as prime minister in April 1908 due to ill-health and was replaced by his chancellor, H. H. Asquith. He died 19 days later – the only prime minister to die in the official residence, 10 Downing Street.

==Early life==
Henry Campbell-Bannerman was born on 7 September 1836 at Kelvinside House in Glasgow as Henry Campbell, the second son and youngest of the six children born to James Campbell of Stracathro (1790–1876) and his wife Janet Bannerman (1799–1873). James Campbell had started work at a young age in the clothing trade in Glasgow, before in 1817 going into partnership with his brother, William Campbell, to found J.&amp; W. Campbell &amp; Co., a warehousing, general wholesale and retail drapery business. In 1831 James Campbell was elected as a member of Glasgow Town Council and in the 1837 and 1841 general elections he stood as a Conservative candidate for the Glasgow constituency. He served as the Lord Provost of Glasgow from 1840 to 1843.

Campbell-Bannerman was educated at the High School of Glasgow (1845–1847), the University of Glasgow (1851–1853), and Trinity College, Cambridge (1854–1858), where he achieved a Third-Class Degree in the Classical Tripos. After graduating, he joined the family firm of J. &amp; W. Campbell &amp; Co., based in Glasgow&#x27;s Ingram Street, and was made a partner in the firm in 1860. He was also commissioned as a lieutenant into the 53rd Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, which was recruited from employees of the firm, and in 1867 was promoted to captain.

In 1871, Henry Campbell became Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the addition of the surname Bannerman being a requirement of the will of his uncle, Henry Bannerman, from whom in that year he had inherited the estate of Hunton Lodge (now Hunton Court) in Hunton, Kent. He did not like the &quot;horrid long name&quot; that resulted and invited friends to call him &quot;C.B.&quot; instead.

Henry Campbell-Bannerman had an older brother, James Alexander Campbell, who in 1876 inherited their father&#x27;s 4000-acre Stracathro estate. He served as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Glasgow and Aberdeen Universities from 1880 to 1906.

==Marriage==
In 1860, Campbell-Bannerman married Sarah Charlotte Bruce, and he and his new bride set up house at 6 Clairmont Gardens in the Park district of the West End of Glasgow. The couple never had any children.

Campbell-Bannerman and Charlotte were an exceptionally close couple throughout their marriage; in the words of one historian, they &quot;shared every thought and possible moment&quot;. Charlotte may have been the person who mostly encouraged Campbell-Bannerman to stand for election, given his local profile.

For several years an aunt occupied the big house at Hunton which Campbell-Bannerman had inherited in 1871. For their country residence, Campbell-Bannerman and his wife lived elsewhere, including Gennings Park, which they did not leave until 1887. They first occupied Hunton Lodge in 1894.

Campbell-Bannerman spoke French, German and Italian fluently, and every summer he and his wife spent a couple of months in Europe, usually in France and at the spa town of Marienbad in Bohemia. Campbell-Bannerman had a deep appreciation for French culture, and particularly enjoyed the novels of Anatole France. They also had an occasional home at Belmont Castle, Meigle, in Scotland.

Campbell-Bannerman and his wife were both reported to be enormous eaters, and in their later years each weighed nearly . Charlotte died on 30 August 1906. After losing her, Campbell-Bannerman was said to &#x27;never be the same&#x27;.

==Member of Parliament==

In April 1868, at the age of thirty-one, Campbell-Bannerman stood as a Liberal candidate in a by-election for the Stirling Burghs constituency, narrowly losing to fellow Liberal John Ramsay. However, at the general election in November of that year, Campbell-Bannerman defeated Ramsay and was elected to the House of Commons as the Liberal Member of Parliament for Stirling Burghs, a constituency that he would go on to represent for almost forty years.

Campbell-Bannerman rose quickly through the ministerial ranks, being appointed as Financial Secretary to the War Office in Gladstone&#x27;s first government in November 1871, serving in this position until 1874 under Edward Cardwell, the Secretary of State for War. When Cardwell was raised to the peerage, Campbell-Bannerman became the Liberal government&#x27;s chief spokesman on defence matters in the House of Commons. He was appointed to the same position from 1880 to 1882 in Gladstone&#x27;s second government, and after serving as Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty between 1882 and 1884, Campbell-Bannerman was promoted to the Cabinet as Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1884, an important role with ongoing Home Rule debates.

In Gladstone&#x27;s third and fourth governments, in 1886 and 1892 to 1894 respectively, as well as the Earl of Rosebery&#x27;s government from 1894 to 1895, Campbell-Bannerman served as the Secretary of State for War. His only military experience was thirty years earlier with the 53rd Lanarkshire Rifles Volunteers. During his time in the War office, he introduced an experimental eight-hour day for the workers at the Woolwich Arsenal munitions factory. The results demonstrated that there was no loss in production. Therefore, Campbell-Bannerman extended the eight-hour day to the Army Clothing Department.

He persuaded the Duke of Cambridge, the Queen&#x27;s cousin, to resign as Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces. This earned Campbell-Bannerman a knighthood in the form of a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in Rosebery&#x27;s 1895 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours. In 1895, Campbell unwittingly caused the fall of Rosebery&#x27;s ministry, when the Earl&#x27;s government lost a vote over C.B.&#x27;s handling of cordite reserves. Unionist MPs unexpectedly forced a successful motion of censure, and the failure led to Rosebery&#x27;s resignation and the return to power of Lord Salisbury.
After the 1895 general election, Campbell-Bannerman lobbied strongly to succeed Arthur Peel as Speaker of the House of Commons, in part because he sought a less stressful role in public life. Rosebery, backed by the Liberal Leader in the Commons, Sir William Harcourt, refused since Campbell-Bannerman was viewed as indispensable to the Government&#x27;s front-bench team in the lower House.

==Leader of the Liberal Party==

On 6 February 1899, Campbell-Bannerman succeeded William Vernon Harcourt as Leader of the Liberals in the House of Commons, and Leader of the Opposition. The Boer War of 1899 split the Liberal Party into Imperialist and Pro-Boer factions, with CB strongly critical of the use of concentration camps as &#x27;methods of barbarism&#x27;. Campbell-Bannerman faced the difficult task of holding together the strongly divided party, which was subsequently and unsurprisingly defeated in the &quot;khaki election&quot; of 1900. Campbell-Bannerman caused particular friction within his own party when in a speech to the National Reform Union in June 1901 and shortly after meeting Emily Hobhouse, he described the concentration camps set up by the British in the Boer War as &quot;methods of barbarism&quot;.

The Liberal Party was later able to unify over its opposition to the Education Act 1902 and the Brussels Sugar Convention of 1902, in which Britain and nine other nations attempted to stabilise world sugar prices by setting up a commission to investigate export bounties and decide on penalties. The Conservative Government of Arthur Balfour had threatened countervailing duties and subsidies of West Indian sugar producers as a negotiating tool. The convention&#x27;s intent was to lead to the gradual phasing out of export bounties, and Britain would then forbid the importation of subsidised sugar. In a speech to the Cobden Club on 28 November 1902, Campbell-Bannerman denounced the convention as threatening the sovereignty of Britain.

It means that we abandon our fiscal independence, together with our free-trade ways; that we subside into the tenth part of a &quot;Vehmgericht&quot; which is to direct us what sugar is to be countervailed, at what rate per cent. we are to countervail it, how much is to be put on for the bounty, and how much for the tariff being in excess of the convention tariff; and this being the established order of things, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in his robes obeys the orders that he receives from this foreign convention, in which the Britisher is only one out of ten, and the House of Commons humbly submits to the whole transaction. (&quot;Shame.&quot;) Sir, of all the insane schemes ever offered to a free country as a boon this is surely the maddest.
However, it was Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s proposals for Tariff Reform in May 1903 that provided the Liberals with a great and nationally resonating cause on which to campaign and unify, due to its protectionist nature. Chamberlain&#x27;s proposals dominated politics through the rest of 1903 up until the general election of 1906. Campbell-Bannerman, like other Liberals, held an unshakeable belief in free trade. In a speech at Bolton on 15 October 1903, he explained in greater detail the reasoning behind Liberal support for free trade.

We are satisfied that it is right because it gives the freest play to individual energy and initiative and character and the largest liberty both to producer and consumer. We say that trade is injured when it is not allowed to follow its natural course, and when it is either hampered or diverted by artificial obstacles... We believe in free trade because we believe in the capacity of our countrymen. That at least is why I oppose protection root and branch, veiled and unveiled, one-sided or reciprocal. I oppose it in any form. Besides we have experience of fifty years, during which our prosperity has become the envy of the world.

In 1903, the Liberal Party&#x27;s Chief Whip Herbert Gladstone negotiated a pact with Ramsay MacDonald of the Labour Representation Committee to withdraw Liberal candidates to help LRC candidates in certain seats, in return for LRC withdrawal in other seats to help Liberal candidates. This attempt to undermine and outflank the Conservatives, which would prove to be successful, formed what became known as the &quot;Gladstone–MacDonald pact&quot;. Campbell-Bannerman got on well with Labour leaders, and he said in 1903 &quot;we are keenly in sympathy with the representatives of Labour. We have too few of them in the House of Commons&quot;. Despite this comment, and his sympathies with many elements of the Labour movement, he was not a socialist. One biographer has written that &quot;he was deeply and genuinely concerned about the plight of the poor and so had readily adopted the rhetoric of progressivism, but he was not a progressive&quot;.

==Prime Minister (1905–1908)==

===Appointment and cabinet ===

The Liberals found themselves suddenly returned to power in December 1905 when Arthur Balfour resigned as prime minister, prompting Edward VII to invite Campbell-Bannerman to form a minority government as the first Liberal prime minister of the 20th century. At 69, he was the oldest person to become prime minister for the first time in the 20th century, though Balfour had hoped that Campbell-Bannerman would not be able to form a strong government, ushering in a general election that he could win. Campbell-Bannerman also faced problems within his own party, through the so-called &quot;Relugas Compact&quot; between H. H. Asquith, Edward Grey and Richard Haldane, who planned to force him into the House of Lords, weakening him as prime minister and effectively allowing Asquith to govern as Leader of the House of Commons. Campbell-Bannerman saw off both of these issues by offering the positions of chancellor of the exchequer, foreign secretary and secretary of state for war to Asquith, Grey and Haldane respectively, which all three accepted, whilst immediately dissolving Parliament and calling a general election. In his first public speech as prime minister on 22 December 1905, Campbell-Bannerman launched the Liberal election campaign, focusing on the traditional Liberal platform of &quot;peace, retrenchment and reform&quot;:

Expenditure calls for taxes, and taxes are the plaything of the tariff reformer. Militarism, extravagance, protection are weeds which grow in the same field, and if you want to clear the field for honest cultivation you must root them all out. For my own part, I do not believe that we should have been confronted by the spectre of protection if it had not been for the South African war. Depend upon it that in fighting for our open ports and for the cheap food and material upon which the welfare of the people and the prosperity of our commerce depend we are fighting against those powers, privileges, injustices, and monopolies which are unalterably opposed to the triumph of democratic principles.

Helped by the Lib–Lab pact that he had negotiated, the splits in the Conservatives over free trade and the positive election campaign that he fought, the Liberals won by a landslide, gaining 216 seats. The Conservatives saw their number of seats more than halve, and Arthur Balfour, now as Leader of the Opposition, lost his Manchester East seat to the Liberals. Campbell-Bannerman was the last Liberal to lead his party to an absolute majority in the House of Commons. Now with a majority of 125, Campbell-Bannerman was returned to Downing Street as a considerably-strengthened Prime Minister. The defeat of the Relugas conspirators in the wake of this stunning victory was later referred to as &quot;one of the most delicious comedies in British political history&quot;.

Whereas in the past it had never been used formally, Campbell-Bannerman was the first First Lord of the Treasury to be given official use of the title &quot;Prime Minister&quot;, a standard that continues to the present day. In 1907, by virtue of being the member of Parliament with the longest continuous service, Campbell-Bannerman became the Father of the House, the only serving British prime minister to do so.

===Social reforms===

In his election address, Campbell-Bannerman spoke in favour of reforming the poor law, reducing unemployment and improving working conditions in sweated factories. The Liberal Imperialist Richard Haldane claimed that Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s government &quot;was if anything, too conservative...with that dear old Tory, C.B., at the head of it, determined to do as little as a fiery majority will allow him&quot;. However the historian A. J. A. Morris disagreed with this judgment, stating that Campbell-Bannerman was in 1906 what he had always been: a Gladstonian Liberal who favoured retrenchment in public expenditure that was perhaps at odds with any ambitious scheme of social reform. 

Another later biographer, John Wilson, called Campbell-Bannerman a moderate social reformer, stating that Campbell-Bannerman favoured a better deal for the poor and the workers but like Gladstone he was opposed to too much state interference. He was said to have commented on the futility of &#x27;our wealth, and learning and the fine flower of our civilisation and our Constitution and our political theories&#x27; calling them &#x27;but dust and ashes&#x27; if the people who labour, the workers on whom &#x27;the whole social fabric is maintained&#x27;, continued to &#x27;live and die in darkness and misery&#x27; in what he called &#x27;the recesses of our great cities&#x27;. CB said that &#x27;sunshine must be allowed to stream in, the water and the food must be kept pure and unadulterated, the streets light and clean&#x27;.

The government of Campbell-Bannerman allowed local authorities to provide free school meals (though this was not compulsory) and also strengthened the power of the trade unions with their Trade Disputes Act 1906. The Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Act 1906 gave some workers the right against their employer to a certain amount of compensation if they suffered an accident at work. The Probation of Offenders Act 1907 was passed, which established supervision within the community for young offenders as an alternative to prison. Under Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s successor, H. H. Asquith, many far-reaching reforms were implemented, but Campbell-Bannerman himself had, in 1906, received a deputation from representatives of 25 women&#x27;s suffragist groups (representing 1,000 women) though he said that his cabinet would object to this change.

===House of Lords reforms===

In the matter of House of Lords reforms, which was to become the dominant issue of the 1910 elections, Campbell-Bannerman proposed on 26 June 1907 that the Lords enjoy purely ornamental ancient privileges, but be deprived of all real legislative power; and that the Commons after tolerating for a few months the futile criticisms of the Lords would be empowered by mere lapse of a brief fraction of a year to ignore the very existence of a Second Chamber, and to proceed to pass their statute on their own authority, like the ordinances of the Long Parliament during the English civil war. In essence, he maintained that the predominance of the Commons must prevail, without any appeal to the constituencies (i.e. a further general election). William Sharp McKechnie characterised this as an &quot;untried one-chambered legislature&quot; and stated that &quot;it could only be carried out by some revolutionary procedure.&quot;
===Foreign affairs===

Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s first speech as prime minister endorsed the intent of the Hague Convention of 1907 to limit armaments. In March 1907, he published &quot;The Hague Conference and the Limitation of Armaments&quot;, an article in which he cited the growing popular and moral authority of the peace movement as reasons to freeze the status quo in the naval arms race between Germany and Britain. His effort was generally considered a failure; in the words of historian Barbara Tuchman, &quot;the argument was narrow steering between the rocks of conscience and the shoals of political reality and it pleased nobody.&quot; The 1907 conference ultimately restricted only a few new classes of armaments, such as submarine mines and projectiles fired or dropped from hot air balloons, but placed no limitations on naval expenditures.

In 1906, Campbell-Bannerman created a minor diplomatic incident with the Russian government when he responded to Tsar Nicholas II&#x27;s dissolution of the Duma with a speech in which he declared, &quot;The Duma is dead; long live the Duma!&quot; Nonetheless, his premiership saw the Entente with Russia in 1907, brought about principally by the Foreign Secretary, Edward Grey. In January 1906 Grey sanctioned staff talks between Britain and France&#x27;s army and navy but without any binding commitment. These included the plan to send one hundred thousand British soldiers to France within two weeks of a Franco-German war. Campbell-Bannerman was not informed of these at first but when Grey told him about them he gave them his blessing. This was the origin of the British Expeditionary Force that would be sent to France in 1914 at the start of the Great War with Germany. Campbell-Bannerman did not inform the rest of the Cabinet of these staff talks because there was no binding commitment and because he wanted to preserve the unity of the government. The radical members of the Cabinet such as Lord Loreburn, Lord Morley and Lord Bryce would have opposed such co-operation with the French.

Campbell-Bannerman visited France in April 1907 and met the Radical prime minister, Georges Clemenceau. Clemenceau believed that the British would help France in a war with Germany but Campbell-Bannerman told him Britain was in no way committed. He may have been unaware that the staff talks were still ongoing. Not long after this Violet Cecil met Clemenceau and she wrote down what he had said to her about the meeting:

Clemenceau said...&#x27;I am totally opposed to you – we both recognise a great danger and you are...reducing your army and weakening your navy.&#x27; &#x27;Ah&#x27; said Bannerman &#x27;but &quot;that&quot; is for economy!&#x27;...[Clemenceau] then said that he thought the English ought to have some kind of military service, at which Bannerman nearly fainted...&#x27;It comes to this&#x27; said Clemenceau &#x27;in the event of your supporting us against Germany are you ready to abide by the plans agreed upon between our War Offices and to land 110,000 men on the coast while Italy marches with us in the ranks?&#x27; Then came the crowning touch of the interview. &#x27;The sentiments of the English people would be totally averse to &quot;any&quot; troops being landed by England on the continent under any circumstances.&#x27; Clemenceau looks upon this as undoing the whole result of the entente cordiale and says that if that represents the final mind of the British Government, he has done with us.

Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s biographer John Wilson has described the meeting as &quot;a clash between two fundamentally different philosophies&quot;. The Liberal journalist and friend of Campbell-Bannerman, F. W. Hirst, claimed that Campbell-Bannerman &quot;had not a ghost of a notion that the French Entente was being converted into a...return to the old balance of power which had involved Great Britain in so many wars on the Continent. That...Grey and Haldane did not inform the Cabinet is astonishing; that a true-hearted apostle of peace like Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman should have &quot;known&quot; of the danger and yet concealed it from his colleagues is incredible, and I am happy to conclude...with an assurance that in the days of his triumph the Liberal leader, having fought a good fight, kept the faith to the end and was in no way responsible for the European tragedy that came to pass six years after his death&quot;.

Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s government granted the Boer states, the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony, self-government within the British Empire through an Order in Council so as to bypass the House of Lords. This led to the Union of South Africa in 1910. The first South African Prime Minister, General Louis Botha, believed that &quot;Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s act [in giving self-government back to the Boers] had redressed the balance of the Anglo-Boer War, or had, at any rate, given full power to the South Africans themselves to redress it&quot;. The former Boer general, Jan Smuts, wrote to David Lloyd George in 1919: &quot;My experience in South Africa has made me a firm believer in political magnanimity, and your and Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s great record still remains not only the noblest but also the &quot;most successful&quot; page in recent British statesmanship&quot;. However the Unionist politician Lord Milner opposed it, saying in August 1907: &quot;People here – not only Liberals – seem delighted, and to think themselves wonderfully fine fellows for having given South Africa back to the Boers. I think it all sheer lunacy&quot;.

==Retirement and death==
Not long after he became Father of the House in 1907, Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s health took a turn for the worse. Following a series of heart attacks, the most serious in November 1907, he began to fear that he would not be able to survive to the end of his term. He eventually resigned as prime minister on 3 April 1908, and was succeeded by his Chancellor of the Exchequer, H. H. Asquith. Campbell-Bannerman remained both a Member of Parliament and Leader of the Liberal Party, and continued to live at 10 Downing Street in the immediate aftermath of his resignation, intending to make other arrangements in the near future. However, his health began to decline at an even quicker pace than before, and he died on 22 April 1908, nineteen days after his resignation. His last words were &quot;This is not the end of me&quot;. He remains to date the only former prime minister to die within 10 Downing Street. Campbell-Bannerman was buried in the churchyard of Meigle Parish Church, Perthshire, near Belmont Castle, his home since 1887. A relatively modest stone plaque set in the exterior wall of the church serves as a memorial.

St Mary&#x27;s Church, Hunton (English Heritage Legacy ID: 432265) contains a marble tablet on the nave wall dedicated to Henry Campbell-Bannerman.

===Views of contemporaries===
On the day of Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s death the flag of the National Liberal Club was lowered to half-mast, the blinds were drawn and his portrait was draped in black as a sign of mourning. John Redmond, the leader of the Irish Nationalist Party, paid tribute to Campbell-Bannerman by saying that &quot;We all feel that Ireland has lost a brave and considerate friend&quot;. David Lloyd George said on hearing of Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s death:

I think it will be felt by the community as a whole as if they had lost a relative. Certainly those who have been associated with him closely for years will feel a deep sense of personal bereavement. I have never met a great public figure since I have been in politics who so completely won the attachment and affection of the men who came into contact with him. He was not merely admired and respected; he was absolutely loved by us all. I really cannot trust myself to say more. The masses of the people of this country, especially the more unfortunate of them, have lost the best friend they ever had in the high places of the land. His sympathy in all suffering was real, deep, and unaffected. He was truly a great man—a great head and a great heart. He was absolutely the bravest man I ever met in politics. He was entirely free from fear. He was a man of supreme courage. Ireland has certainly lost one of her truest friends, and what is true of Ireland is true of every section of the community of this Empire which has a fight to maintain against powerful foes.

In an uncharacteristically emotional speech on 27 April, the day of Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s funeral, his successor H. H. Asquith told the House of Commons:

What was the secret of the hold which in these later days he unquestionably had on the admiration and affection of men of all parties and all creeds? ...he was singularly sensitive to human suffering and wrongdoing, delicate and even tender in his sympathies, always disposed to despise victories won in any sphere by mere brute force, an almost passionate lover of peace. And yet we have not seen in our time a man of greater courage—courage not of the defiant or aggressive type, but calm, patient, persistent, indomitable...In politics I think he may be fairly described as an idealist in aim, and an optimist by temperament. Great causes appealed to him. He was not ashamed, even on the verge of old age, to see visions and to dream dreams. He had no misgivings as to the future of democracy. He had a single-minded and unquenchable faith in the unceasing progress and the growing unity of mankind...He never put himself forward, yet no one had greater tenacity of purpose. He was the least cynical of mankind, but no one had a keener eye for the humours and ironies of the political situation. He was a strenuous and uncompromising fighter, a strong Party man, but he harboured no resentments, and was generous to a fault in appreciation of the work of others, whether friends or foes. He met both good and evil fortune with the same unclouded brow, the same unruffled temper, the same unshakable confidence in the justice and righteousness of his cause...He has gone to his rest, and to-day in this House, of which he was the senior and the most honoured Member, we may call a truce in the strife of parties, while we remember together our common loss, and pay our united homage to a gracious and cherished memory—

How happy is he born and taughtThat serveth not another&#x27;s will;Whose armour is his honest thought,And simple truth his utmost skill;This man is freed from servile bandsOf hope to rise or fear to fall;Lord of himself, though not of lands,And, having nothing, yet hath all.

Robert Smillie, the trade unionist and Labour MP, said that, after Gladstone, Campbell-Bannerman was the greatest man he had ever met.

===Views of historians===

Historians agree that in his 28 months as prime minister, Campbell-Bannerman was relatively undistinguished with few significant reforms enacted. Major bills such as plural voting, land reform, and licensing reform were shredded in the Lords. Education Bills of 1906 and 1907 were rejected by both party supporters and Unionist peers. The bills that were passed were either technical or the result of cross-party consensus. Campbell-Bannerman had no apparent plan to circumvent the Lords&#x27; veto and did little to stimulate the social reform program. Campbell-Bannerman was passive and uninvolved in his dealings with the cabinet, leading to diffuse debates and ill-focused methods of handling business. He failed to supervise Grey&#x27;s foreign policy, He failed to consult the full cabinet before initiating momentous discussions on defense interests with the French in 1906. As a result, his competence was severely questioned. However, historians have identified a few positive aspects of his tenure, including laying the foundation for a more effective government under Asquith. He was part of a period of Scottish dominance in the Prime Minister role and he represented Scotland&#x27;s full integration into the political realm. Additionally, Campbell-Bannerman was the first Prime Minister with direct business experience and not from a landed, Anglican background.

Historian George Dangerfield in 1935 concluded that Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s death &quot;was like the passing of true Liberalism. Henry had believed in Peace, Retrenchment, and Reform, those amiable deities who presided so complacently over large portions of the Victorian era... And now almost the last true worshipper at those large, equivocal altars lay dead&quot;. Campbell-Bannerman held firmly to the Liberal principles of Richard Cobden and William Ewart Gladstone. It was not until Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s departure that the doctrines of New Liberalism came to be implemented. R. B. McCallum stated that &quot;Campbell-Bannerman was of pure Gladstonian vintage and a hero to the Radicals&quot;. Friedrich Hayek said: &quot;Perhaps the government of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman... should be regarded as the last Liberal government of the old type, while under his successor, H. H. Asquith, new experiments in social policy were undertaken which were only doubtfully compatible with the older Liberal principles&quot;.

Other historical accounts, however, have portrayed Campbell-Bannerman as a genuine progressive figure. According to one study, Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s views &quot;were broadly those of the party&#x27;s centre-left: a belief in individual freedom, a desire to help the disadvantaged, an aversion to imperialism and support for Irish self-government.&quot; During his time as prime minister, Campbell-Bannerman supported such measures as safeguards for trade unions, old-age pensions, and urban planning to improve housing. As far back as 1903, Campbell-Bannerman had spoken of the intention of the Liberal Party to do something about the &quot;twelve million people in England [who] were living on the verge of starvation,&quot; During the 1930s, one-time Labour Party leader George Lansbury wrote admiringly of Campbell-Bannerman, describing him as a man who &quot;believed in peace and was not afraid of the word Socialism, and did believe unemployment was a national problem and the unemployed the care of the State.&quot;

His bronze bust, sculpted by Paul Raphael Montford, is in Westminster Abbey. There is a blue plaque outside Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s house at 6 Grosvenor Place in London, unveiled in 2008. Campbell-Bannerman was the subject of several parody novels based on the 1865 Lewis Carroll novel &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, such as Caroline Lewis&#x27;s (pseudonym for Edward Harold Begbie, J. Stafford Ransome, and Michael Henry Temple) &quot;Clara in Blunderland&quot; (1902) and &quot;Lost in Blunderland&quot; (1903).

<text>In spectroscopy, the Rydberg constant, symbol formula_1 for 
heavy atoms or formula_2 for hydrogen, named after the Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg, is a physical constant relating to the electromagnetic spectra of an atom. The constant first arose as an empirical fitting parameter in the Rydberg formula for the hydrogen spectral series, but Niels Bohr later showed that its value could be calculated from more fundamental constants according to his model of the atom. 

Before the 2019 revision of the SI, formula_1 and the electron spin &quot;g&quot;-factor were the most accurately measured physical constants.

The constant is expressed for either hydrogen as formula_2, or at the limit of infinite nuclear mass as formula_1. In either case, the constant is used to express the limiting value of the highest wavenumber (inverse wavelength) of any photon that can be emitted from a hydrogen atom, or, alternatively, the wavenumber of the lowest-energy photon capable of ionizing a hydrogen atom from its ground state. The hydrogen spectral series can be expressed simply in terms of the Rydberg constant for hydrogen formula_2 and the Rydberg formula.

In atomic physics, Rydberg unit of energy, symbol Ry, corresponds to the energy of the photon whose wavenumber is the Rydberg constant, i.e. the ionization energy of the hydrogen atom in a simplified Bohr model.

== Value ==
=== Rydberg constant === 
The CODATA value is
: formula_7 
where
* formula_8 is the rest mass of the electron (i.e. the electron mass),
* formula_9 is the elementary charge, 
* formula_10 is the permittivity of free space, 
* formula_11 is the Planck constant, and 
* formula_12 is the speed of light in vacuum.

The symbol formula_13 means that the nucleus is assumed to be infinitely heavy, an improvement of the value can be made using the reduced mass of the atom:
: formula_14
with formula_15 the mass of the nucleus. The corrected Rydberg constant is:
: formula_16
that for hydrogen, where formula_15 is the mass formula_18 of the proton, becomes:
: formula_19

Since the Rydberg constant is related to the spectrum lines of the atom, this correction leads to an isotopic shift between different isotopes. For example, deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen with a nucleus formed by a proton and a neutron (formula_20), was discovered thanks to its slightly shifted spectrum.

=== Rydberg unit of energy ===
The Rydberg unit of energy is
: formula_21
::: = 

=== Rydberg frequency ===
: formula_22 = 

=== Rydberg wavelength ===
: formula_23.

The corresponding angular wavelength is
: formula_24.

== Bohr model ==

The Bohr model explains the atomic spectrum of hydrogen (see &quot;Hydrogen spectral series&quot;) as well as various other atoms and ions. It is not perfectly accurate, but is a remarkably good approximation in many cases, and historically played an important role in the development of quantum mechanics. The Bohr model posits that electrons revolve around the atomic nucleus in a manner analogous to planets revolving around the Sun.

In the simplest version of the Bohr model, the mass of the atomic nucleus is considered to be infinite compared to the mass of the electron, so that the center of mass of the system, the barycenter, lies at the center of the nucleus. This infinite mass approximation is what is alluded to with the formula_13 subscript. The Bohr model then predicts that the wavelengths of hydrogen atomic transitions are (see &quot;Rydberg formula&quot;):
: formula_26
where &quot;n&quot;1 and &quot;n&quot;2 are any two different positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...), and formula_27 is the wavelength (in vacuum) of the emitted or absorbed light, giving
: formula_28
where formula_29 and &quot;M&quot; is the total mass of the nucleus. This formula comes from substituting the reduced mass of the electron.

== Precision measurement ==

The Rydberg constant was one of the most precisely determined physical constants, with a relative standard uncertainty of This precision constrains the values of the other physical constants that define it.

Since the Bohr model is not perfectly accurate, due to fine structure, hyperfine splitting, and other such effects, the Rydberg constant formula_30 cannot be &quot;directly&quot; measured at very high accuracy from the atomic transition frequencies of hydrogen alone. Instead, the Rydberg constant is inferred from measurements of atomic transition frequencies in three different atoms (hydrogen, deuterium, and antiprotonic helium). Detailed theoretical calculations in the framework of quantum electrodynamics are used to account for the effects of finite nuclear mass, fine structure, hyperfine splitting, and so on. Finally, the value of formula_30 is determined from the best fit of the measurements to the theory.

== Alternative expressions ==
The Rydberg constant can also be expressed as in the following equations.
: formula_32
and in energy units
: formula_33
where
* formula_8 is the electron rest mass,
* formula_9 is the electric charge of the electron,
* formula_11 is the Planck constant,
* formula_37 is the reduced Planck constant,
* formula_12 is the speed of light in vacuum,
* formula_10 is the electric constant (vacuum permittivity),
* formula_40 is the fine-structure constant,
* formula_41 is the Compton wavelength of the electron,
* formula_42 is the Compton frequency of the electron,
* formula_43 is the Compton angular frequency of the electron,
* formula_44 is the Bohr radius,
* formula_45 is the classical electron radius.

The last expression in the first equation shows that the wavelength of light needed to ionize a hydrogen atom is 4&quot;π&quot;/&quot;α&quot; times the Bohr radius of the atom.

The second equation is relevant because its value is the coefficient for the energy of the atomic orbitals of a hydrogen atom: formula_46.

<text>Johannes (Janne) Robert Rydberg (; 8 November 1854 – 28 December 1919) was a Swedish physicist mainly known for devising the Rydberg formula, in 1888, which is used to describe the wavelengths of photons (of visible light and other electromagnetic radiation) emitted by changes in the energy level of an electron in a hydrogen atom.

== Biography ==
Rydberg was born 8 November 1854 in Halmstad in southern Sweden, the only child of Sven Rydberg and Maria Anderson Rydberg. When he was 4 years old his father died, and the family was forced to live on a small income. In 1873 he graduated from Halmstads elementärläroverk, where he received high grades in maths and physics. Later that year he enrolled in Lund University, and two years later he was awarded his bachelor&#x27;s degree. In 1879 he was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy with his dissertation &quot;Konstruktioner af kägelsnitt i 3- och 4-punktskontakt&quot;.

Rydberg began his career as an amanuensis in the institution. He became a docent in maths in 1880, and in 1882 became a docent in physics. At this time he began studying the standard atomic weight, because he wondered what was the reason for the seemingly random increase in weight for the atoms in Mendeleev&#x27;s periodic system. He searched for a formula for several years to no avail.

His next work was about investigating the atomic spectra, explaining why these occurred. Rydberg&#x27;s research was preceded by Johann Jakob Balmer&#x27;s, who presented an empirical formula for the visible spectral lines of the hydrogen atom in 1885. However, Rydberg&#x27;s research led him to publish a formula in 1888 which could be used to describe the spectral lines not only for hydrogen but other elements as well. After his publication in 1890 on the subject, Rydberg returned to his fruitless research on the periodic table.

Rydberg applied for a professorship in 1897, but despite the recommendations of experts in the subject he was rejected. However, he became an extraordinary professor instead. It was not until 1909 that he was upgraded into a full professorship. To earn extra money he worked part-time as a numerical examiner at Sparbanken in Lund from 1891 and as an actuary in Malmö from 1905.

In 1913, Rydberg became very ill and was forced to slow down his pace of research, and in 1915 he was granted leave on account of his illness. He died on 28 December 1919 at Lund Hospital and was succeeded by his student Manne Siegbahn. Rydberg is buried at the northern cemetery in Lund and left his wife Lydia Carlsson (1856–1925), son Helge Rydberg (1887–1968) and daughter Gerda Rydberg (1891–1983).

== Rydberg formula == 
The physical constant known as the Rydberg constant is named after him, as is the Rydberg unit. Excited atoms with very high values of the principal quantum number, represented by &quot;n&quot; in the Rydberg formula, are called Rydberg atoms. Rydberg&#x27;s anticipation that spectral studies could assist in a theoretical understanding of the atom and its chemical properties was justified in 1913 by the work of Niels Bohr (see hydrogen spectrum). An important spectroscopic constant based on a hypothetical atom of infinite mass is called the Rydberg (R) in his honour.

<text>Modern dance in the United States is a form of contemporary dance that was developed in the United States in the 20th century. African American modern dance also developed a distinct style.

==History==
Closely related to the development of American music in the early 20th century was the emergence of a new, and distinctively American, art form – modern dance. Among the early innovators was Isadora Duncan (1878–1927), who stressed pure, unstructured movement in lieu of the positions of classical ballet. Duncan said &quot;from early childhood I have considered the freedom of my body essential to rhythm of movement&quot;. Her emphasis on the natural world and body in the context of concert dance influenced the ideas of the modern dancers who succeed her in America.

The main line of development, however, runs from the dance company of Ruth St. Denis (1878–1968) and her husband-partner, Ted Shawn (1891–1972), which produced work exploring images from other countries that were considered exotic by American audiences. St. Denis&#x27; pupil Doris Humphrey (1895–1958) looked outward for inspiration, to society and human conflict. Another pupil of St. Denis, Martha Graham (1893–1991), whose New York-based company became perhaps the best known in modern dance, sought to express an inward-based passion. Many of Graham&#x27;s most popular works were produced in collaboration with leading American composers, such as &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot; with Aaron Copland.

A significant contributing factor to the development and spread of Modern Dance in the United States in the 20th century was the establishment of Bennington College&#x27;s Summer School of Dance. The program was established in 1934 and led by dancer/educator Martha Hill. Students attended classes in dance techniques, dance composition, music for dance, teaching methods, production, dance history and critical theory. The school&#x27;s faculty included established dancers and choreographers such as Martha Graham, Hanya Holm, Charles Weidman and Doris Humphrey, many of whom had received their training from European Modern and Expressionist dancers. The Bennington School let American modern dancers assemble to develop a dance genre of their own identity, while at the same time established a model for University-level education programs in dance in the United States.

With clear pioneers, pupils and principles, modern dance began to emerge as a distinctly American art form to be taught and developed throughout the country and continent.

Later choreographers searched for new methods of dance composition. Merce Cunningham (1919–2009) introduced chance procedures and composition by field. Choreographers as Mark Morris (1956–) and Liz Lerman (1947–) defied the convention that dancers must be thin and young. Their belief, put into action in their hiring practices and performances, is that graceful, exciting movement is not restricted by age or body type.

==African American modern dance==

African American modern dance blends modern dance with African and Caribbean movement (flexible torso and spine, articulated pelvis, isolation of the limbs, and polyrhythmic movement). Notable people included:
*Katherine Dunham (1909-2006) trained in ballet, founded &quot;Ballet Negre&quot; in 1936 and then the Katherine Dunham Dance Company based in Chicago. In 1945, she opened a school in New York City, teaching &quot;Katherine Dunham Technique&quot;, African and Caribbean movement integrated with ballet and modern dance.
*Pearl Primus (1919-1994), born in Trinidad, drew on African and Caribbean dances to create strong dramatic works characterized by large leaps. She often based her dances on the work of black writers and on racial issues, such as Langston Hughes&#x27;s 1944 &quot;The Negro Speaks of Rivers&quot;, and Lewis Allan&#x27;s 1945 &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; (1945). Her dance company developed into the &quot;Pearl Primus Dance Language Institute&quot;.
*Alvin Ailey (1931-1989) studied under Lester Horton, Bella Lewitzky, and later Martha Graham. He spent several years working in both concert and theater dance. In 1958, Ailey and a group of young African-American dancers performed as the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in New York. He drew upon his &quot;blood memories&quot; of Texas, the blues, spirituals and gospel as inspiration. His most popular and critically acclaimed work is &quot;Revelations&quot; (1960).
*Eleo Pomare (1937–2008) was born in Columbia, but moved to New York as a child, and later founded the Eleo Pomare Dance Company. With Carole Johnson, Rod Rodgers, Gus Solomon and Pearl Reynolds, he co-founded the Association of Black Choreographers, which was the predecessor to the Modern Organization for Dance Evolvement, or MODE. His work had a profound impact on many dancers and choreographers, including Indigenous Australians.
*Carole Johnson (born 1940) danced with Pomare&#x27;s company, contributed to the definition of &quot;Black Dance&quot;, and leaves a huge legacy in Australia in the form of the NAISDA Dance College and Bangarra Dance Theatre.
