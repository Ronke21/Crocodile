<text>Benmore Dam is the largest dam within the Waitaki power scheme, located in the Canterbury Region of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. There are eight other power stations in the Waitaki Power Scheme.

The dam is the largest earth-fill (zoned embankment dam) water-retaining structure in New Zealand. Its core is low permeability clay material, supported by two massive shoulders of river gravel. Lake Benmore has a volume of 1.25 billion cubic metres, about 1.5 times as much water as Wellington Harbour. The dam&#x27;s spillway can cope with over 6,000 cubic metres of water per second, about 20 times the mean river flow.

==Benmore Power Station==
With a generating capacity of , Benmore Power Station is the second largest hydro station in New Zealand behind Manapouri, and the largest dam in the country.

Construction of the dam and hydroelectric station began in 1958 at a cost of $62 million. It was commissioned in 1965, and was officially opened by Prime Minister Sir Keith Holyoake on 15 May that year. It was built for the New Zealand Electricity Department; since 1999 it has been owned and operated by Meridian Energy.

From 2008 to 2010 the six turbines were refurbished at a cost of $67 million. This enabled a 6% reduction in water use for the same generation capacity, increasing annual generation by . New switchboards and an upgrade to the switchyard were also undertaken.

Benmore is the South Island terminus of the HVDC Inter-Island link between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. The HVDC converter stations are on the west side of the tailrace, and convert 220 kV AC power to ±350 kV DC for the journey to the North Island converter station at the Haywards in Lower Hutt.

== Otematata ==
Otematata is the small town that was created to support workers who constructed the dam, and their families. The town was constructed by the Ministry of Works, which residents called &quot;Uncle Mow&quot; or &quot;Big Mow&quot; as it provides every feature, including social activities and clubs, and expelled criminals from the town. After the dam was constructed, much of the village was dismantled. Many of the houses, which had been trucked in from Roxburgh, were trucked away again and moved to the next site in Twizel.

Today Otematata supports the dam, although with advances in technology the staffing needed to maintain the dam is drastically smaller. Due to this the town is now a small holiday community, with only around 200 permanent residents. The dam is about up the valley from the township.

==Key statistics==

* Installed capacity: 540 MW 
* Machinery: 6 x 90,000 kW vertical Francis turbines (Dominion Engineering, Canada), coupled to 6 x 90,000 kW 112,500 kVA generators (Canadian General Electric); 3 transformers totalling 1,150 MVA
* Penstocks: Prestressed concrete

==Transmission==

Benmore is a major switching point in the New Zealand national grid and one of two major switching stations in the Waitaki Valley (the other being Twizel sub-station). The importance is largely due to the location at Benmore of the southern terminal station of the HVDC Inter-Island link.

The main AC switching station is on the east bank of the tailrace, and electricity generated at Benmore Power Station is injected into the national grid here. Three major 220 kV lines containing five circuits run from the Benmore substation. Clockwise from south, they are:
* A double-circuit line to the Twizel sub-station, with one circuit going via Ōhau C power station and one circuit going via Ōhau B power station.
* A single-circuit line to Islington sub-station in Christchurch, via Twizel sub-station and Tekapo B power station.
* A double-circuit line to Aviemore Dam

The HVDC converter stations are located on the west side of the tailrace, connected to the AC switching station by lines over the tailrace. The -350 kV thyristor Pole 2 has its valve hall on the south side of the site. A new +350 kV thyristor Pole 3 was commissioned in 2013 to replace the ageing Pole 1, and its valve hall is located adjacent to the existing Pole 2 valve hall.

<text>Poitou-Charentes (; ; Poitevin-Saintongeais: ) was an administrative region on the southwest coast of France. It comprised four departments: Charente, Charente-Maritime, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne. It included the historical provinces of Angoumois, Aunis, Saintonge and Poitou.

Poitiers was the regional capital. Other important cities were La Rochelle, Niort, Angoulême, Châtellerault, Saintes, Rochefort and Royan.

Poitou-Charentes was merged with Aquitaine and Limousin to form the new administrative region of It is part of the new region Nouvelle-Aquitaine on 1 January 2016.

==Politics==
The regional council was composed of 56 members.

==Demographics==
In French, the region&#x27;s residents were known as &quot;Picto-Charentais&quot;. In 2003, the region ranked 15th out of 26 in population. In area it ranked 12th in size.

Three regional languages, Poitevin, Saintongeais and Occitan (Limousin, Marchois) were spoken by a minority of people in the region.

Southern Poitou-Charentes and Aquitaine is believed to be the region of origin of the Acadian and Cajun populations of North America, such as in New Brunswick, Louisiana, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, the Gaspé Peninsula of Quebec and Maine. Their ancestors emigrated from the region in the 17th and 18th centuries.

At first, these French immigrants from the rural areas of Poitou-Charentes settled in what is now eastern Canada, and established an agricultural and maritime economy (farming and fishing). This area of the New World was dubbed &quot;Acadia&quot; by the French, after the Greek &quot;Arcadia&quot; the idyllic part of the Peloponnesian peninsula in Greece. As an alternate theory, some historians suggest that the name is derived from the indigenous Canadian Mi&#x27;kmaq language, in which Cadie means &quot;fertile land&quot;. It was renamed &quot;Nova Scotia&quot; (New Scotland) in the aftermath of the 1755 expulsion of most of the Acadians by the English.

==History==

Poitou is a historic region in west central France. Poitiers, the capital of the region, is its chief city, although the port of La Rochelle, capital of the province of Aunis, rivals it in economic importance. Farming is important to the economy; wheat, corn and cattle are farmed. Industries produce machinery, chemicals and dairy products.

The region&#x27;s first known inhabitants, the Pictavi, a Gallic tribe, were conquered in 56 BC by the Romans, who then incorporated the area into Gaul as part of the province of Aquitania, with the Aquitani tribes. The Visigoths seized the region in 418 AD, but it passed to the Franks in 507. In 732 or 733, Charles Martel brought the Muslim invasion of Western Europe to a standstill by his victory in the Battle of Poitiers. From the 10th to the mid-12th century, the counts of Poitou were also the dukes of Aquitaine, and the city of Poitiers grew in importance.

In 1152, Poitou came under English control through the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine to Henry II (later king of England). The region was reunited with the French crown in 1416 and was a province of France until the Revolution (1789–1795), when it was divided into three departments, Vienne, Deux-Sèvres, and Vendée.

Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan was born in the area in 1640 (d. 1707). She was the famous mistress to Louis XIV; Some of their descendants are still alive today.

<doc id="198699" wikidata="Q2755928" url="?curid=198699" title="Lady Sarah Lennox">
<text>Lady Sarah Lennox (14 February 1745 – August 1826) was the most notorious of the famous Lennox sisters, daughters of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond and Sarah Cadogan.

==Early life==
Lady Sarah Lennox was born on 14 February 1745, the sixth surviving child of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond and his wife Sarah Cadogan. She was born into great wealth and connections. Her paternal grandfather, Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, was an illegitimate son of King Charles II. Through this connection, the 1st Duke had been granted many titles in England and France, and perhaps more importantly, wealth through an annuity and a share of certain coal taxes in Newcastle. This coal allocation would become a significant source of the family&#x27;s wealth, as mining and manufacturing grew during the Industrial Revolution. The Lennox family&#x27;s royal connections increased in 1727 when the 2nd Duke and Duchess&#x27;s obtained court appointments under King George II and Queen Caroline.

Though arranged, her parents had a loving marriage and the family was large; Sarah was one of twelve children, seven of whom survived to adulthood. Compared to the rigid formality typical of the era, the Lennox family was inseparable and unconstrained. Young Sarah was considered lively in an already energetic family. By the time she was six years old, however, both of her parents were dead. Consequently, she and her nearest siblings Louisa and Cecilia were brought up by their elder sister Emily FitzGerald, Countess of Kildare at Carton House in County Kildare, Ireland. At age fourteen Sarah returned to London with a dowry of £10,000 to find a worthy husband, staying at Holland House, the home of another sister, Lady Caroline Fox. Described by Caroline as &quot;immensely pretty&quot; and in possession of a &quot;vastly engaging&quot; manner, Sarah was also at first awkward and unsure of her attractions. She soon gained a reputation for beauty; her brother-in-law Henry Fox characterised her as &quot;different from &amp; prettyer than any other girl [he] ever saw... her beauty is not easily described, otherwise by saying she had the finest complexion, most beautiful hair, with a sprightly and fine air, a pretty mouth, remarkably fine teeth &amp; excess of bloom in her cheeks&quot;.

Sarah, a favourite of King George II since childhood, was invited to appear at court and caught the eye of his grandson George, Prince of Wales (soon to be King George III). Over a two-year period, he fell in love with her and eventually confided his feelings in his advisor Lord Bute, who told him marriage plans with a non-royal spouse were not possible. Sarah, flattered by the attention and fond of the newly crowned king, was later surprised and disappointed to learn of his betrothal to Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. She was chief bridesmaid at their wedding and in later life expressed relief that she had not become queen.

== Family and marriages ==
At age seventeen, Lady Sarah began worrying about finding a good match. Her three elder sisters had done well in their marriages. Sarah was briefly engaged to Lord Newbattle. Charles Bunbury, twenty-two year old MP for Suffolk, often attended political discussions at Holland House and began courting her. Though the eldest son of Reverend Sir William Bunbury, 5th Baronet, he was not considered by her family to have a large enough fortune for them to live in fashionable society. Nonetheless, her sister Caroline was ready for her matchmaking duties to be over and the match was approved. Sarah married Bunbury on 2 June 1762 at Holland House Chapel. He succeeded his father as sixth Baronet in 1764.

Upon their marriage, they went to live at Barton Hall, his country estate in Suffolk. Their relationship soon became difficult; Bunbury was distant and Sarah was anxious for his affection. She helped her husband&#x27;s political career and was an effective campaigner. In 1767, she reportedly secured 94 out of 100 votes while campaigning in Morpeth.

Sarah had several affairs including with her cousin Lord William Gordon, the second son of the Duke of Gordon. She gave birth to his illegitimate daughter in 1769 and did not try to hide that the child was not her husband&#x27;s. Bunbury initiated divorce proceedings, an uncommon process in the 18th century. It took several years and eventually was granted through an Act of Parliament in 1776.

The child was not immediately disclaimed by Sir Charles, and received the name Louisa Bunbury. Nevertheless, Lady Sarah and Lord William eloped shortly afterwards, in February 1769, taking the infant with them. Lord William soon abandoned her. Sir Charles refused to take her back, and Lady Sarah returned to her brother&#x27;s house with her child, while her husband introduced into Parliament a motion for a divorce on grounds of adultery, citing her elopement. Lady Sarah resisted the motion, and it was not until 14 May 1776 that the decree of divorce was issued.

Lady Sarah married an army officer, Hon. George Napier, on 27 August 1781 and had eight children:

* General Sir Charles James Napier (10 August 1782 – 29 August 1853); married Elizabeth Oakeley in April 1827. He remarried Frances Philipp in 1835.
* Emily Louisa Augusta Napier (11 July 1783 – 18 March 1863); married Lt.-Gen. Sir Henry Bunbury, 7th Baronet (nephew of her mother&#x27;s first husband) on 22 September 1830

<text>Edwin Branford Edwards (May 22, 1891 – April 9, 1963) was an early jazz trombonist who was a member of the Original Dixieland Jass Band.

==Life and career==
A native of New Orleans, Louisiana, Edwards started on violin at age 10 and moved to trombone five years later. He played both instruments professionally with the bands of Papa Jack Laine and Ernest Giardina. In addition to music, Edwards played minor-league baseball and worked as an electrician.

In 1916, he was picked by Alcide Nunez to go to Chicago, Illinois, to play trombone with Johnny Stein&#x27;s Jazz Band. With a few changes of personnel, this band became the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, which made the first jazz records in 1917. He played on one of the first commercially released jazz recordings, &quot;Livery Stable Blues&quot;, later released as &quot;Barnyard Blues&quot;.

He left the band after being drafted into the United States Army. The band replaced him with Emile Christian. Edwards served in the Army from July 1918 to March 1919. After being discharged, he led a band of his own and worked in the band of Jimmie Durante before returning to the Original Dixieland Jazz Band. After that band broke up, he again led a band in New York City for most of the 1920s. In the early 1930s, he retired from music and ran a newspaper stand and worked as a sports coach.

He returned to music in 1936 when Nick LaRocca reformed the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, playing with them until 1938. He played in other bands with Larry Shields, Tony Sbarbaro, and J. Russel Robinson in New York into the 1940s. He continued playing professionally intermittently until shortly before his death in New York City in 1963.

His composition &quot;Sensation Rag&quot;, or &quot;Sensation&quot;, was performed at the 1938 Benny Goodman jazz concert at Carnegie Hall and was included on the album &quot;The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert&quot;.

Jazz musician Johnny Wiggs said that, while he&#x27;d heard more sophisticated trombone players, he&#x27;d &quot;never heard another tromboner[sic] who could give a band the rhythmic punch that Edwards could.&quot;

==Grammy Hall of Fame==
&quot;Darktown Strutters&#x27; Ball&quot; (1917) by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2006.

<text>Francis Van Wyck Mason (November 11, 1901 – August 28, 1978) was an American historian and novelist. He had a long and prolific career as a writer spanning 50 years and including 78 published novels, many of which were well-received best sellers.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Van Wyck (pronounced &quot;Wike&quot;) Mason was born to a patrician Boston family which immigrated to North America during the 17th Century. His early life featured much adventure, even before he began writing. His first eight years he lived in Berlin and then Paris, where his grandfather served as U.S. Consul General, and during that time he learned the French language. Mason himself noted that he didn&#x27;t learn English until he was nearly ten. After a few years in Illinois he left for Europe in 1917, while still a teenager, to fight in World War I. Like many future writers, he was an ambulance driver for a while. He then managed to enlist in the French Army, where he received decorations as an artillery officer, including the Legion of Honor. On Armistice Day, he was celebrating just his 17th birthday, yet had already joined the United States Army and achieved the rank of Lieutenant. After the war he went to preparatory school, then attended Harvard University, where he received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1924. At one time during his college years, he was mistakenly arrested for murder. Having borrowed a dinner jacket, he was identified wrongly as a waiter who had committed a murder.

His hopes of entering the diplomatic corps were thwarted after his father&#x27;s death, so Mason started an import business instead and spent the next few years traveling the world buying antiques and rugs. His travels included Europe, Russia, the Near East, North Africa (nine weeks with his own caravan), the West Indies, Central Africa, and a ride across Central America on horseback. He lived in New York City, served in a cavalry unit of the National Guard, and played quite a bit of polo. He indulged an interest in hunting the rest of his life.

===Writing career and personal life===

By 1927 a chance meeting with one of his college professors, John Gallishaw, encouraged him to try writing. He attended Gallishaw&#x27;s course in short fiction on the condition that he pay for the course out of future sales. He married socialite Dorothy L. MacReady in New York City during November of that year. By May 1928 he had his first story published. He enjoyed immediate success selling to the pulp magazines, and sold 18 stories before his first rejection. The magazines paid well at that time, and he was soon able to build a comfortable home outside of Baltimore, Maryland. In 1930, he published his first novel, &quot;The Seeds Of Murder&quot;, which introduced Captain Hugh North, an agent of U.S. Army Intelligence. North was the hero in a long series of &quot;intrigue&quot; novels.

By 1931, he had settled into a career as an author of novels as well as short fiction, publishing his first historical novel in book form, &quot;Captain Nemesis&quot;, which was republished from an earlier pulp serial. The historical novel apparently did not sell well, because he resumed the mystery/intrigue genre, publishing a dozen or so volumes during the next seven years, including nine more about Hugh North.

Mason was still writing historical stories for the pulps during this period and during 1938 resumed the genre for a major novel, &quot;Three Harbours&quot;, about the early phases of the American Revolution. By this time Mason was doing very well financially, with residences in Bermuda and Nantucket, as well as Maryland. When delivering the manuscript of &quot;Three Harbours&quot; from Nantucket, he was caught in the middle of the New England Hurricane of 1938. He made it to New York, and the book became very popular. It changed his emphasis to historical fiction for the rest of his career, though he continued to write Hugh North stories until 1968.

During the next few years, Mason wrote two companion books to &quot;Three Harbours&quot; – &quot;Stars on the Sea&quot; and &quot;Rivers Of Glory&quot; – as well as three more Hugh North mysteries. These books all sold well, especially &quot;Stars on the Sea&quot;, which was a top 10 bestseller for 1940, and Mason was very successful when the war interrupted his writing. He re-enlisted in the Army after Pearl Harbor and suspended his writing career, though he did manage to write some youth-oriented war stories using the name Frank W. Mason. At this time he also published a couple of reworked pulp serials using the name Ward Weaver. During World War II, he worked as Chief Historian on General Eisenhower&#x27;s staff, having achieved the rank of Colonel, and received numerous awards for bravery. His main responsibility was to document the war for future generations, but he also wrote a famous communiqué which announced the activities of D-Day to the world. As part of his duties he followed behind or with advancing troops as they worked their way into enemy territory and was one of the first into some of the concentration camps, including Buchenwald.
After the war, Mason settled into a more leisurely lifestyle of a little more than one book per year, which he was to maintain for the next quarter century. His style was well refined by this time, and he published a series of fairly popular books. He finished his American Revolution series with &quot;Eagle in the Sky&quot; in 1948. The next year he wrote &quot;Cutlass Empire&quot;, a popular novel about the famous buccaneer Henry Morgan, and during 1951 started a trilogy about the US Civil War.

During the 1950s, Mason rewrote more of his pulps for the paperback market and in 1955 published a successful youth book titled &quot;The Winter At Valley Forge&quot;. After that, he continued to write historical novels for youths. Also during the 1950s, he relocated from Baltimore to Bermuda. His wife was ill during this period and finally died in 1958.

Mason soon married Jean-Louise Hand, his long-time secretary. He spent the rest of his life in Bermuda, writing historical fiction for adults and youths, as well as several more Hugh North novels.

===Death===
Mason drowned in 1978, while swimming off the coast of Bermuda after having finished &quot;Armored Giants&quot;, about the battle between the &quot;Monitor&quot; and &quot;Merrimack&quot;, which was published posthumously in 1980.

==Writing==

===Overview===
As a writer Mason&#x27;s career was based on popular fiction but included four main genres: Pulp fiction, Mystery/intrigue (mainly based on series character Hugh North), historical fiction, and young adult fiction.

===Writing style===
Mason&#x27;s writing style was colorful though straightforward. His stories usually involve a heroic gentleman character. This hero may be forced to extreme measures by circumstances, but in the end, is victorious. Based on his own life which involved extensive travel, his stories are usually either set in exotic locations, as in the Hugh North stories, or involve main characters who are traveling extensively.

===Pulp fiction===
Mason&#x27;s early work of adventure stories started with &quot;The Fetish Of Sergeant M’Gourra&quot; in May 1928 and continued until he started his more serious historical fiction during 1938. He published stories involving war, jungle settings, the French Foreign Legion, and historical adventures. Several of these early historical stories were rewritten and published as paperback originals during the 1950s. Mason&#x27;s novel &quot; The Barbarians&quot; (1954) is the story of Cealwyn, an Ancient Briton. Cealwyn is kidnapped by Carthaginians, but escapes and fights his former captors during the First Punic War. The story was made into the movie Revak the Rebel. Another of Mason&#x27;s pulp fiction stories made into a movie was &quot;The Enemy&#x27;s Goal&quot; which was used as the basis for The Spy Ring starring Jane Wyman. That story combined Mason&#x27;s interest in polo with a good dose of military intrigue to add drama.

===Hugh North Series===
Captain (later Major and Colonel) Hugh North was a prototype for James Bond: tough, athletic, a good shot and hand-to-hand fighter, as well as perfect in dress, manner, and speech for elegant society. The North series also sometimes foreshadowed actual military events, including a sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. Mason created the character in 1930 and the series began with stories that had a fairly traditional mystery format. Through the years leading up to WW II these stories contain increasing levels of political intrigue but retained a murder mystery as a central theme. After the war the series largely became more typical spy fiction with the emphasis on a secret mission.

===Historical fiction===
Mason&#x27;s historical stories nearly always involve some kind of warfare and frequently include naval battles or long sea voyages. Most of his historical novels are prefaced by a fairly lengthy (usually several pages) discussion of the historical setting and context of his story. Often, with his fictional characters, Mason recounts the story of some significant but not widely known historical event. Actual historical people are occasionally introduced as minor characters of the plot. An interesting tidbit about Mason&#x27;s work in this genre is that most of the titles have 13 letters. When writing &quot;Rivers of Glory&quot; his secretary pointed out that the titles of the first two books in that series met that criterion, so Mason decided to go with it.

<text>The flag of Quebec (), called the in French, represents the Canadian province of Quebec. It consists of a white cross on a blue background, with four white fleurs-de-lis.

It was the first provincial flag officially adopted in Canada and was originally shown on January 21, 1948, at the Parliament Building in Quebec City, during the administration of Maurice Duplessis. Legislation governing its usage was enacted on March 9, 1950. Quebec&#x27;s Flag Day (January 21) commemorates its adoption each year, although for some time it was celebrated in May.

== Status ==
Article 2 of the &quot;Act respecting the flag and emblems of Québec&quot; confers the status of national emblem () on the flag of Quebec.

== Symbolism ==

The takes its white cross over a blue field from certain French flags of the Kingdom of France, namely the French naval flag as well as the French merchant flag. Its white fleurs-de-lis (symbolizing purity) and blue field (symbolizing heaven) come from a banner honouring the Virgin Mary; such banners were carried by Canadian colonial militia in the 18th century. The fleurs-de-lis, as a symbol has often been associated with France, specifically the Kingdom of France. The flag is blazoned &quot;Azure, a cross between four fleurs-de-lis argent&quot;. Its horizontal symmetry allows both sides of the flag to show the same image.

===Bourbon flag===
The royal banner of France or &quot;Bourbon flag&quot; was the first and most commonly used flag in New France. The banner has three gold fleurs-de-lis on a dark blue field (arranged two and one), and it was also present on the French naval flag.

== Protocol ==
The flag&#x27;s official ratio is 2:3 (width to length), but the flag is very often seen as a 1:2 variant to match the flag of Canada in size when flying together.

The &quot;Act respecting the flag and emblems of Québec&quot; states that &quot;in all cases, the flag of Quebec has precedence over any other flag or emblem.&quot; However, under federal protocol, the Canadian flag takes precedence when both are flown.

The official shade of blue is Pantone 293. In 8-bit RGB, it is #003399. Unofficial variants using a lighter blue are common.

=== Vertical display ===

The canton (; top left quarter) must always be to the viewer&#x27;s left.

== History ==
The desire of Quebecers for a distinctive flag was longstanding. Other flags that had been used included the flag (a horizontal green, white and red tricolour, which became the flag of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society), as well as the French tricolour.

The direct predecessor of the modern was created by Elphège Filiatrault, a parish priest in Saint-Jude, Quebec. Called the , it resembles the modern flag except that the fleurs-de-lis are located at the corners, pointing inward. It was based on an earlier flag with no cross, and with the figure of the Virgin Mary in the centre.

The &quot;Carillon&quot; flag was first raised on September 26, 1902, and it is preserved in the archives of Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec. Another version, with the Sacred Heart in the centre, also appeared, but it was left behind in the push for a new provincial flag after World War II. The &quot;Carillon&quot; flags were used informally.

On May 26, 1868, Queen Victoria approved Quebec&#x27;s first coat of arms. A flag might have been devised by using the arms to deface a blue ensign or red ensign (a Union Flag in the canton, and the Quebec coat of arms in the fly). However, such ensigns were never used — various sources including the official Quebec government site mention that it was the Union Flag that flew over the Parliament Building until January 21, 1948, not a blue or red ensign. In addition, in 1938, at the opening of a mining school in Val-d&#x27;Or, the flag used to represent the Quebec government was a banner of arms. This was done at the behest of public servant Burroughs Pelletier, who had been told that the Ministry wanted a symbol but were unsure as to what should be used.

In 1947, an independent member of the Legislative Assembly, René Chaloult, demanded a new provincial flag to displace the unpopular (amongst some segment of the population of Quebec) Union Jack and Canadian Red Ensign. Various ideas were discussed between Chaloult, Lionel Groulx and Maurice Duplessis. One such idea involved incorporating a red maple leaf (later to be adopted for the flag of Canada). Pelletier was also asked to present a few proposals to Duplessis, none of which were adopted. He was however consulted about what became the present design.

On January 21, 1948, the new flag was adopted and was flown over the Parliament Building that very afternoon. Apparently, it was the &quot;Carillon&quot; flag that flew that day, because the modern (with the fleurs-de-lis repositioned upright to their modern configuration in correspondence with the rules of heraldry) was not available until February 2.

The flag was adopted by order-in-council, and the news was presented to the Legislative Assembly more or less as a . Opposition leader Adélard Godbout expressed his approval, as did Chaloult. A law governing the usage of the flag was later officially adopted by the Quebec Parliament on March 9, 1950. A more recent version of such a law was adopted in 2002.

A 2001 survey by the North American Vexillological Association ranked the as the best provincial or territorial flag, and the third-best of the flags of all U.S. and Canadian provinces, territories and states, behind the flags of New Mexico and Texas respectively. Likewise, the flag is highly popular in Quebec, and it is often seen displayed at many private residences and commercial buildings.

The flag of Quebec bears a close resemblance to both the French Châlons-en-Champagne city coat of arms and the Spanish Morcín municipality flag, which use similar (though unrelated) designs but with differing colours.
The flag of Quebec was the basis for the jerseys of the Quebec Nordiques, which included the same shade of blue, the fleurs-de-lis and white stripes.

<doc id="198705" wikidata="Q7341837" url="?curid=198705" title="Robert Ballagh">
<text>Robert Ballagh (; born 22 September 1943) is an Irish artist, painter and designer. Born in suburban Dublin, Ballagh&#x27;s initial painting style was strongly influenced by pop art. He is also known for his hyperrealistic renderings of Irish literary, historical and establishment figures, or designing more than 70 Irish postage stamps and a series of banknotes, and for work on theatrical sets, including for works by Samuel Beckett and Oscar Wilde, and for &quot;Riverdance&quot; in multiple locations. Ballagh&#x27;s work has been exhibited at many solo and group shows since 1967, in Dublin, Cork, Brussels, Moscow, Sofia, Florence, Lund and others, as well as touring in Ireland and the US. His work is held in a range of museum and gallery collections. He was chosen to represent Ireland at the 1969 Biennale de Paris.

A lifelong resident of Dublin, he was made a member of Ireland&#x27;s academy of artists, Aosdána He became the founding chairperson of the Irish Visual Artists Rights Organisation. He has received a number of awards, including an honorary doctorate from UCD. He has published a book of photography of Dublin, and a volume of memoirs.

==Early life and education==
Born 22 September 1943, Ballagh grew on Elgin Road in Ballsbridge, the only child of a Catholic mother, Nancy (maiden name Bennett), and a Presbyterian father, Bobbie (also Robert), who converted to Catholicism. Both parents had played sport for Ireland, his mother hockey, his father tennis and cricket. His father was the manager of the shirt department of a drapery shop on South William Street; his mother, who came from a comfortable middle-class background, stopped working when she married. Robert attended a private primary school, Miss Meredith&#x27;s School for Young Ladies on Pembroke Road, and then the fee-paying St Michael&#x27;s College and Blackrock College. He became an atheist during his secondary education. His parents were members of the Royal Dublin Society, one of Ireland&#x27;s most active learned societies, and he spent time in its library and looking at its collection of art books, while also collecting American comics and frequenting the local cinema, not just to watch films but also observing for hours the sign painter at work. He began to work on art seriously in 1959, and some of his early works, including a self-portrait, were later exhibited as part of a retrospective show at the Gorry Gallery.

After passing his Leaving Certificate, Ballagh attended Bolton Street College of Technology for three years, studying architecture, including with Robin Walker, who had worked with Le Corbusier; he concluded that this was not the career for him, and that it conflicted with his musical career ambitions, while his tutors found him excessively interested in designs beyond his briefs.

==Career==
Before turning to art as a profession, Ballagh was a professional musician for about three years, initially with the showband &quot;Concord&quot;, then, on a full-time basis, as bass guitarist with &quot;The Chessmen&quot;, managed by Noel Pearson. Having toured Ireland and England extensively with the latter band, reaching a weekly income of 100 pounds, he concluded that a career in music, especially with a lot of time on the road, was not for him, sold his guitar, to rising musician Phil Lynott and did not play music again.

===Painting and other plastic arts===
Ballagh worked in both Dublin and for a few months, London, as a draughtsman, a postman and a designer. Having decided to return to Ireland, he started on a dedicated artistic career after he met an artist friend, Micheal Farrell, freshly returned from the New York art scene, in a pub, and Farrell recruited him for 5 pounds a week to assist with a large mural commission. The piece, for the National Bank branch on Suffolk Street (part of Bank of Ireland), was painted at Ardmore Studios due to its massive scale. Two early pieces of three-dimensional art, an erotic torso and a pinball machine, were selected to appear at the Irish Exhibition of Living Art in 1967, and Ballagh has appeared in a range of group exhibitions since. Around the same time, Ireland&#x27;s Arts Council purchased an acrylic of a razor blade on canvas, inspired by a theory of critic Clement Greenberg. Largely self-taught, his early work took inspiration from the pop art movement, and he worked on two early series of paintings, the &quot;Package&quot; series and &quot;Map&quot; series, the latter using a mix of acrylic and day-glo paints in inkblots. He next turned to political themes, notably connected to Northern Ireland but also with elements inspired by the Civil Rights movement in the US and the reaction to the Vietnam War. He started to combine elements of social realism with US advertising forms after reading Che Guevara&#x27;s essay &quot;Man and Socialism in Cuba&quot;. He also produced three early works which have remained critically recognised ever since, inspired by &quot;Liberty at the Barricades&quot; (Delacroix), &quot;Third of May&quot; (Goya) and &quot;Rape of the Sabines&quot; (David). In 1972, he commemorated the victims of Bloody Sunday in Derry with an installation at the Irish Exhibition of Living Art at the Project Arts Centre in Dublin; it consisted of thirteen rough figures in sand on the floor, sprinkled with (animal) blood, recorded as a series of photoprints.

He was selected to represent Ireland at the 1969 Biennale de Paris, and his work has been shown in solo exhibitions from that year onwards. He was commissioned by his former tutor, Robin Walker, to produce abstract designs for screens in the new restaurant building of University College Dublin.

Ballagh started to work on portraiture with Irish contemporary art collector Gordon Lambert in 1971. As he was at the time still not fully content with his skills in painting faces and hands, he merged his own canvas with a silkscreen headshot of Lambert, over which he worked with sepia ink, and he added the hands in detached three-dimensional representations, which sculptor Brian King made for him from castings of Ballagh&#x27;s own hands. Over the following years, he painted a series of people looking at contemporary paintings, which proved very popular, with some international exhibitions selling out. Using the same concept, in his first major public commission, for the Five-Star supermarket chain&#x27;s new shop in Clonmel, he painted a large-scale ( 80 foot) mural on 18 panels. He used formica, and included himself, his wife and his daughter in the mural, entitled &quot;People and a Frank Stella&quot;. He also, drawing on scenes from &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman&quot; by locally-born Lawrence Sterne, painted a series of panels for a local restaurant. Other work included a series of six paintings and a silkscreen print linked to Flann O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;The Third Policeman&quot;.

He later painted fellow artist Louis le Brocquy, writers J.P. Donleavy (2006), James Joyce (2011, commissioned by UCD), Sheridan Le Fanu, Oscar Wilde, Brendan Behan and Samuel Beckett, as well as poet Francis Ledwidge, singer Bernadette Greevy, politician Carmencita Hederman and a rendering of Fidel Castro. The Ledwidge, commissioned by the Inchicore Ledwidge Society, is a triptych, with the poet primarily on the central panel, but his arms crossing to the outer panels, which feature a scene from his home village of Slane and a World War I scene. He had earlier painted Joyce in a scene on O&#x27;Connell Street, Dublin&#x27;s main street, with himself alongside. Some years after buying Ballagh&#x27;s &quot;The History Lesson&quot;, the scientist James D Watson visited Ballagh in Dublin to discuss a portrait commission, and the Ballaghs visited the Watsons at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, with Ballagh commenting on the new insights into the world of science he gained from the visit. Ballagh worked on a portrait of Watson over an extended period; it hangs in the Genetics Institute of Trinity College Dublin. At Watson&#x27;s request, Ballagh painted Watson&#x27;s colleague Francis Crick for a major institution in London, and at the unveiling was one of just two people to meet the Queen, who commented that the portrait was &quot;interesting&quot;. Other commissions included Dublin City University purchasing a portrait of former Minister for Education Mary O&#x27;Rourke. By 2010, Ballagh had painted 91 non-family portraits, featuring 82 men and 9 women.

Works of self-portraiture and paintings of his family have also been created over time. One of these, &quot;Inside Number 3&quot;, described by Eamonn Ceannt as moving on from &quot;the conventional architectural perspective of his previous paintings&quot; and marking &quot;a turning round of his own approach to painting&quot;, featured his wife as a nude figure on a spiral staircase in their home. That work was preceded by &quot;No. 3&quot;, with his family portrayed conventionally outside their house, and was followed by &quot;Upstairs No. 3&quot;. This was a second intimate portrait, with a mostly nude Ballagh ascending a spiral stairway, seen from the perspective of his wife on their bed with a book of Japanese erotica; he commented that he really felt that &quot;Inside Number 3&quot; called for a response, and that the needed male nude had to be himself. Later still he painted &quot;Inside No. 3 After Modernization&quot; (with multiple types of painting included in the background), &quot;Upstairs No. 4&quot;, and others. In a very different setting, he also painted his family on an extended 1978 holiday near Malaga, in &quot;Winter in Ronda&quot; (1979). He also used himself and family members as models for generic characters, and, for example, painted two pictures of his daughter in homage to Marilyn Monroe, &quot;Rachel as Marilyn&quot; I and II.

After many years, and one painting looking out to an exterior scene in the mid-1980s, Ballagh started to paint landscape work seriously in the late 1990s, and his 2002 exhibition, &quot;Tir is Teanga&quot; / &quot;Land and Language&quot; consisted of 10 landscapes, albeit not of specific places, but typical of some Irish scenes. Another commission was to paint the Fastnet Lighthouse for the Commissioners of Irish Lights.

Ballagh has served as a judge for a number of artistic competitions, including one for murals in West Belfast. He has also led community arts work in both Dublin and Belfast, and taught art in prisons. One community art project in Dublin, to make a massive mural placed in front of the Custom House, was the subject of an RTE television documentary.

====Studio====
For many years, Ballagh rented an attic-level studio on Parliament Street in Dublin, overlooking City Hall; this studio had previously been leased by other artists, such as Patrick Collins. After he lost the lease on that in the mid-1980s (it was repurposed as part of the development of Temple Bar and eventually hosted the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s Irish office), he worked from home. Finding home working difficult with two growing children, in the early 1990s he used an inheritance to buy a house and former piggery on Arbour Hill, less than 10 minutes walk from his home. He renovated the building, and it now hosts his studio and a small flat. The artist has mentioned that he sometimes works slowly and in great detail; in 1982, for example, he produced just two paintings, spending about 6 months on each. His work has sold well at auction. One painting, &quot;My Studio 1969&quot;, sold for 96,000 euro in 2004.

===Postage stamp and banknote design===

Ballagh has designed over 70 Irish postage stamps, as well as a series of Irish banknotes, &quot;Series C&quot;, the last series before the introduction of the euro. Ballagh&#x27;s first postage stamp design was released on 4 September 1973. It commemorated the centenary of the World Meteorological Organization and depicted a weather map of northwestern Europe. His portrayal of Ireland did not show the border with Northern Ireland, provoking the unionist politician Ian Paisley to demand in the British House of Commons that the British government should make a formal objection, even though no other international borders were shown either. Later design contracts included the centenaries of the Universal Postal Union and the first telephone transmission, the golden jubilee of Ireland&#x27;s national electricity utility, the Electricity Supply Board, the centenaries of the births of Patrick Pearse and Éamon de Valera and commemorations of various other Irish statesmen, issues related to Scouting, Guiding and the Boys&#x27; Brigade, Irish festivals, the Irish lighthouse authority and one of Ireland&#x27;s annual &quot;love stamps&quot;. One stamp design was rejected by the government, after stamps had already been printed, possibly due to interference by Taoiseach Charlie Haughey; the stamps and plates were destroyed. A version of the stamp was eventually released more than 15 years later. On another occasion, in 1994, he was commissioned to produce stamps commemorating five Irish Nobel Prize winners; four were released but the fifth was cancelled when An Post belatedly realised that the subject, physicist Ernest Walton, was still alive.

===Theatre set and other design work===
Ballagh has worked on set design for both travelling shows and plays and events based in Ireland. He was approached to try this type of work by the director of Dublin&#x27;s Gate Theatre, Michael Colgan. Among the theatrical sets he has designed are ones for &quot;Riverdance&quot; on international tour, and later in Dublin too, the one-man show &quot;I&#x27;ll Go On&quot; (Gate Theatre (1985), based on Samuel Beckett&#x27;s novels, Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Endgame&quot; (1991), Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (1987) and &quot;Salomé&quot; (1998), Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and Michael Harding&#x27;s &quot;Misogynist&quot;. He also did set work for the Dublin Theatre Festival.

For &quot;Riverdance&quot;, impresario Moya Doherty, co-creator of the show, asked Ballagh to use a hand-made approach, and he produced around 50 small images, which were then projected to form backdrops. A further complication is that while Ballagh started by designing for the London part of the &quot;Riverdance&quot; tour, he later had to rework his designs to accommodate different venues, with varying technical capabilities, such as projection only from the front, from front and back, or from different directions along with moving objects crossing them.

Ballagh was also designer for the opening ceremonies for two major sporting events hosted in Ireland, the 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games and the 2006 Ryder Cup. Many years later, he was commissioned to produce a &quot;tableau vivant&quot; for a promotional event at the Royal Hibernian Academy&#x27;s Gallagher Gallery, a living artwork inspired by a famous painting – he chose to work with &quot;The Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot;.

In other domains of work, he designed a masthead for the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot;, and a cover for a musical single.

===Exhibitions===
====Solo exhibitions====
Ballagh has had solo shows in Dublin on several occasions, as well as in Brussels, Paris, Lund in Sweden, Warsaw, Moscow and Sofia. His first exhibition was in 1969, at the Little Theatre in the original Brown Thomas shop on Grafton Street; it was opened by Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien, who described him as &quot;an exceptionally gifted, thoughtful young artist.&quot;

Later shows of original work in Ireland included a 1971 case at the Cork Art Society, and in years including 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1983, exhibitions at the gallery of his dealer, David Hendricks, in Dublin. After Hendricks died and his gallery closed, Ballagh decided to work without a Dublin dealer and primary gallery, and his next exhibition of new work in Dublin only came after a 26-year gap, in 2009, with &quot;Tir is Teanga&quot; (&quot;Land and Language&quot;). This show consisted of paintings with natural materials such as stones, sand, and metals, added, and with Irish language texts. There was a show of some of his 1970s material at the Orchard Gallery in Derry, organised by Patrick T Murphy and Declan McGonagle.

In 1982, Ballagh was invited to put on a &quot;mid-term retrospective&quot; show in Lund in southern Sweden, which proceeded in 1983. He exhibited at West Cork Arts in 1986.

In 1989, he was invited to put on a major retrospective at the Gallery of the Central House of Artists (of the Soviet Union) in Moscow (later the New Tretyakov Gallery), only the second Irish person and third Westerner to be so invited, after Francis Bacon and Robert Rauschenberg. He afterwards gifted samples of his work to the USSR&#x27;s ambassador to Ireland and to Mikhail Gorbachev.

Ballagh had his first major retrospective show in Ireland, &quot;Robert Ballagh – The Complete Works&quot;, in the top-floor exhibition space at Arnotts department store on Henry Street, in February 1992, launched by Hugh Leonard. The exhibition included 100 examples of his work, consisting of paintings, including portraits, designs for stamps, book illustrations and theatrical sets, limited edition books, and photography. The show was centred on a selection of 33 paintings from his 25-year career to date, 26 commissioned illustrations and limited edition prints, books for Gallery Press and Black Cat Press, 12 photographs, 12 stamps, models and photographs from theatrical work, and three stationery designs. The exhibition catalogue included three essays on his painting, and one each on his limited edition prints, stamp design work, photo-essay book and stage design.

Further retrospectives followed, the next, and most significant, being at the Gallagher Gallery of the Royal Hibernian Academy, with a gallery-within-a-gallery format, – with a display of his stamps at the General Post Office in parallel. The retrospective was nearly cancelled due to lack of funding for the elaborate gallery setup but rescued by sponsorship by Dermot Desmond. There was also a show at the Gorry Gallery (&quot;Works from the Studio, 1959-2006&quot;).

An exhibition of seven portraits of political and cultural people of note, and seven self-portraits, &quot;Seven&quot;, was held at Cork&#x27;s Crawford Art Gallery in 2013, and a selection of works related to the 1916 Easter Rising were exhibited at the Kevin Kavanagh Gallery in 2016.

====Major group exhibitions====
Having had works displayed at the Irish Exhibition of Living Art (IELA) in 1967, Ballagh was invited to show at the 1968 edition. He was also invited to the 1969 IELA, which had to move from the College of Art on Merrion Square to venues in Cork and Belfast. Having submitted a painting for consideration in 1969, after discussion with other artists&#x27; wives, his wife was also invited. After an outbreak of violence in Northern Ireland, 9 artists, including the Ballaghs, refused to allow their works to be sent there; they were instead displayed in an alternative exhibition, &quot;Art and Conscience&quot;, at 43 Kildare Street (and in the end, the exhibition never did go to Belfast). Sometime after, he exhibited three works commenting on the Northern Irish situation at &quot;Celtic Triangle&quot;, a joint exhibition of the Arts Councils of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

Having featured at the Irish Exhibition of Living Art, and been inspired by earlier editions of the exhibition, Ballagh was invited to show at Rosc in 1980. He was also invited, in 1987, to participate in a peace forum and associated major exhibition in the Soviet Union, at the Cosmos Hotel in northeastern Moscow, a rare invitation for an Irish artist. At the event he breakfasted with Gregory Peck, lunched with Yoko Ono and chaired a panel consisting of Norman Mailer, Gore Vidal and Graham Greene.

Ballagh has been included in exhibitions in Florence and Tokyo, and has also had work on tour in the US in the period 1985–1987, as part of the &quot;Divisions, Crossroads, Turns of Mind: Some New Irish Art&quot; exhibition. One of his works also featured in &quot;30 years, artists, places&quot;, a travelling exhibition of work acquired by Irish local authorities.

===Recognition and leadership roles===
Ballagh received the Carroll Prize at IELA 1969, and the Alice Berger Hammerschlag Award, an all-island award for practitioners of the &quot;plastic arts&quot;, at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland in 1971.

He was a founding member of Ireland&#x27;s national academy or &quot;affiliation&quot; of artists, Aosdána, in 1981, and its first chairperson (the leader of its presiding body, the Toscaireacht). He ceased active participation in the body in the early 1990s, after what he felt was undue pressure to declare his personal views in a debate about censorship.; he eventually resigned membership, one of only four artists to do so in the more than 40 years of the academy&#x27;s existence. He was also made a fellow of the World Academy of Art and Science, one of only two Irish fellows. He was awarded an honorary doctorate of letters in 2013 by University College Dublin. In 2016, he received a Lord Mayor&#x27;s Award in Dublin.

Two of his works won the Douglas Hyde Gold Medal at editions of the &quot;Oireachtas Exhibition&quot;. Another piece, &quot;&#x27;Northern Ireland, The 1,500th Victim&quot; (1976) was selected as one of the &quot;Modern Ireland in 100 Artworks&quot; series of the Royal Irish Academy.

Ballagh was the first chairperson of the Artists Association of Ireland, and the founding chairperson of the Irish Visual Artists Rights Organisation.

===Collections===
Ballagh&#x27;s paintings are held in several public collections of Irish painting including those of the National Gallery of Ireland, the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin, the Ulster Museum, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork, along with the collections of Trinity College Dublin, the Musée des beaux-arts de La Chaux-de-Fonds and Nuremberg&#x27;s Albrecht Dürer House. Reproductions of three of his works are among the most-borrowed items in the Trinity College Dublin collection.

===Approach and critical commentary===
Ballagh has said of his work: &quot;You hope that your paintings will transcend their time but they must be of their time as well&quot; and of a potential inspiration: &quot;...the master of the 20th century, Picasso. He did so many different things, had so many styles and approaches. That seems to me the way, the model.&quot;

Some commentators have made observations about what might motivate Ballagh, with Declan Kiberd saying: &quot;Robert Ballagh is the major current example of the Irish artist as activist. He has espoused the causes of socialism, republicanism, workers&#x27; rights and nuclear disarmament... Yet his own painting is free of all propaganda.&quot; and Brian O&#x27;Doherty: &quot;his is not so much political art as art made by an intensely political person.&quot; Roderic Knowles noted his move from &quot;abstraction to figuration&quot; and &quot;his social commitment, which shows itself in his humour and wit, parody and pastiche and social comment, and his quite shameless literary and artistic allusions&quot;, while Cyril Barrett referenced his changing approach, with &quot;the figure first as a silhouette or &#x27;cut-out&#x27;, then as a painted figure (as in his pastiches of Goya, Delacroix, Poussin or Ingres)&quot;.

The former director of the Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA) once characterised Ballagh as more of an illustrator than an artist; nonetheless, IMMA holds a range of his works. Dorothy Walker&#x27;s &quot;Modern Art in Ireland&quot; made almost no mention of Ballagh and his body of work.

==Political and cultural interests==
===Artists&#x27; representation and rights===
Ballagh has long campaigned for artists&#x27; rights, notably in regard to resale, and for better funding for the arts. He pursued the question of resale rights, assured by EU law but late to be implemented in Ireland, threatening, and later pursuing, legal action; the right was eventually established. He has pursued this aim individually and in his roles in the Artists Association of Ireland, and the Irish Visual Artists Rights Organisation (IVARO). He also worked with the UNESCO-associated body of artists, the International Association of Art, to the executive committee of which he was elected, and on which he served as treasurer for three years; this work involved considerable travel and his work on the representational bodies made him so busy in 1987 that he painted nothing at all. Ballagh has commented that Ireland&#x27;s funding of the arts is poor by EU and OECD standards.

===Politics and republicanism===
In an interview with &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, Ballagh ascribes his &quot;political awakening&quot; to hearing news of civil rights protestors in Derry, Northern Ireland, being attacked by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in 1968. In 1988 he contributed to the West Belfast Féile an Phobail arts festival. In 1989 he was a founder member of the Irish National Congress and chaired it for 10 years. In 1991, he co-ordinated the 75th-anniversary commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising, during which he claimed he had been harassed by the Special Branch of the Garda Síochána. He has commented that the Easter Rising was &quot;led by poets, actors, writers, musicians, social reformers, Irish language activists – a truly remarkable gathering of people...&quot;

He is the president of the Ireland Institute for Historical and Cultural Studies, which promotes studies of republicanism in an international context. It is based at the Pearse Centre at 27 Pearse Street, Dublin, once home to Pádraig Pearse.

Ballagh was on the committee of a major group campaigning for a &quot;No&quot; vote in Ireland&#x27;s referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.

===2011 presidential run rumours===
In July 2011 it was reported that he might consider running for the 2011 Irish Presidential election with the backing of Sinn Féin and the United Left Alliance. A Sinn Féin source stated there had been &quot;very informal discussions&quot; and that Ballagh&#x27;s nomination was &quot;a possibility&quot; but &quot;very loose at this stage&quot;. On 25 July, Ballagh ruled out running in the election, saying that he had never considered being a candidate; his discussions with the parties had been about the election &quot;in general&quot; and he had no ambitions to run for political office.

===Palestine===
Also in July 2011, Ballagh broke ranks with his colleagues involved with the travelling production of &quot;Riverdance&quot; over their decision to perform in Israel. He is an active member of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which has asked that artists and academics participate in boycotts of Israeli businesses and cultural institutions.

===Closure of Irish galleries and museums===
In July 2012, Ballagh said he was &quot;ashamed and profoundly depressed&quot; at the &quot;en masse&quot; closure of Irish galleries and museums. He cited an example of some Americans and Canadians on holiday in Ireland. &quot;They described most of the National Gallery as being closed along with several rooms in the Hugh Lane Gallery. I&#x27;m glad they didn&#x27;t bother going out to the Museum of Modern Art in Kilmainham because that&#x27;s closed too. At the point I met them, they were returning from Galway where they had found the Nora Barnacle Museum closed too.&quot; Ballagh condemned the hypocrisy of political leaders, saying: &quot;I know arts funding is not a big issue for people struggling to put food on the table but we are talking about the soul of the nation.&quot;

==Publications and appearances==
Ballagh published a book of Dublin photography, taken over a year on a Rolleiflex camera, accompanied by quotations from James Joyce, in the 1980s. The book focused on less-well-known or disappearing sights of the city. A &quot;Robert Ballagh Monograph&quot; was published in a limited edition in 2010, with a set of giclee prints. He published an academic paper, &quot;Who fears to speak of the Republic?&quot; in the journal &quot;Études irlandaises&quot;. He released an autobiographical volume, &quot;A Reluctant Memoir&quot;, in 2018; it is not written as a chronological summary of his life but consists of a range of short pieces around major events.

Documentaries were produced about Ballagh, by the BBC (directed by Paul Muldoon), and in Irish, by Igloo Films, in 2001 (directed by Anthony Byrne). In 2019, he appeared as a contestant on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Home of the Year,&quot; where his house finished in second place. He was the guest speaker at the 2012 Ledwidge Day commemoration at Islandbridge.

==Personal life==

Ballagh met his future wife Betty (Elizabeth Carabini, from a Dublin family of Italian descent) in 1965, when she was 16 and he was playing a musical gig. They had two children, Rachel, born 1968, who also became an artist, and Robert Bruce, born late 1974 or early 1975. During his early years as a self-employed artist, Ballagh sometimes signed on for unemployment benefits while seeking paid work; even much later he remarked on the instability of artistic income, noting that he earned no money at all in the first half of 2019, for example.

The couple originally purchased one artisan&#x27;s dwelling, then a row of them which they merged into a single architect-designed dwelling, with Ballagh participating in the design. The finished building, Ballagh House, was later profiled in &quot;Architecture Ireland&quot;, the official journal of architects in Ireland, and featured on a TV show.

Betty Ballagh fell and received a brain injury in 1986, falling into a coma and requiring an operation to remove a clot; it took her years to fully recover. Robert&#x27;s parents died within three months of each other in 1990. Betty died at St Joseph&#x27;s Hospital, Raheny, in 2011, after a couple of months awaiting treatment for diverticulitis. He later sued on grounds of negligence by the Health Service Executive and members of its staff, and received a settlement.

By the mid-2000s, he had two grandchildren. He had chemotherapy treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and recovered fully; he subsequently received a diagnosis of type II diabetes. As of 2021, Ballagh still lived in Broadstone and kept his studio in nearby Arbour Hill.

<doc id="198711" wikidata="Q859029" url="?curid=198711" title="Rancidification">
<text>Rancidification is the process of complete or incomplete autoxidation or hydrolysis of fats and oils when exposed to air, light, moisture, or bacterial action, producing short-chain aldehydes, ketones and free fatty acids.

When these processes occur in food, undesirable odors and flavors can result. In processed meats, these flavors are collectively known as warmed-over flavor. In certain cases, however, the flavors can be desirable (as in aged cheeses).

Rancidification can also detract from the nutritional value of food, as some vitamins are sensitive to oxidation. Similar to rancidification, oxidative degradation also occurs in other hydrocarbons, such as lubricating oils, fuels, and mechanical cutting fluids.

==Pathways==
Five pathways for rancidification are recognized:

===Hydrolytic===
Hydrolytic rancidity refers to the odor that develops when triglycerides are hydrolyzed and free fatty acids are released. This reaction of lipid with water may require a catalyst (such as a lipase, or acidic or alkaline conditions) leading to the formation of free fatty acids and glycerol. In particular, short-chain fatty acids, such as butyric acid, are malodorous. When short-chain fatty acids are produced, they serve as catalysts themselves, further accelerating the reaction, a form of autocatalysis.

===Oxidative===
Oxidative rancidity is associated with the degradation by oxygen in the air.
====Free-radical oxidation====
The double bonds of an unsaturated fatty acid can be cleaved by free-radical reactions involving molecular oxygen. This reaction causes the release of malodorous and highly volatile aldehydes and ketones. Because of the nature of free-radical reactions, the reaction is catalyzed by sunlight. Oxidation primarily occurs with unsaturated fats. For example, even though meat is held under refrigeration or in a frozen state, the poly-unsaturated fat will continue to oxidize and slowly become rancid. The fat oxidation process, potentially resulting in rancidity, begins immediately after the animal is slaughtered and the muscle, intra-muscular, inter-muscular and surface fat becomes exposed to oxygen of the air. This chemical process continues during frozen storage, though more slowly at lower temperature. Oxidative rancidity can be prevented by light-proof packaging, oxygen-free atmosphere (air-tight containers) and by the addition of antioxidants.
====Enzyme-catalysed oxidation====
A double bond of an unsaturated fatty acid can be oxidised by oxygen from the air in reactions catalysed by plant or animal lipoxygenase enzymes, producing a hydroperoxide as a reactive intermediate, as in free-radical peroxidation. The final products depend on conditions: the lipoxygenase article shows that if a hydroperoxide lyase enzyme is present, it can cleave the hydroperoxide to yield short-chain fatty acids and dicarboxylic acids (several of which were first discovered in rancid fats).

===Microbial===
Microbial rancidity refers to a water-dependent process in which microorganisms, such as bacteria or molds, use their enzymes such as lipases to break down fat. Pasteurization and/or addition of antioxidant ingredients such as vitamin E, can reduce this process by destroying or inhibiting microorganisms.

==Food safety==
Despite concerns among the scientific community, there is little data on the health effects of rancidity or lipid oxidation in humans. Animal studies show evidence of organ damage, inflammation, carcinogenesis, and advanced atherosclerosis, although typically the dose of oxidized lipids is larger than what would be consumed by humans.
Antioxidants are often used as preservatives in fat-containing foods to delay the onset or slow the development of rancidity due to oxidation. Natural antioxidants include ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and tocopherols (vitamin E). Synthetic antioxidants include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), TBHQ, propyl gallate and ethoxyquin. The natural antioxidants tend to be short-lived, so synthetic antioxidants are used when a longer shelf-life is preferred. The effectiveness of water-soluble antioxidants is limited in preventing direct oxidation within fats, but is valuable in intercepting free radicals that travel through the aqueous parts of foods. A combination of water-soluble and fat-soluble antioxidants is ideal, usually in the ratio of fat to water.

In addition, rancidification can be decreased by storing fats and oils in a cool, dark place with little exposure to oxygen or free radicals, since heat and light accelerate the rate of reaction of fats with oxygen. Antimicrobial agents can also delay or prevent rancidification by inhibiting the growth of bacteria or other micro-organisms that affect the process.
Oxygen scavenging technology can be used to remove oxygen from food packaging and therefore prevent oxidative rancidification.

==Oxidative stability measurement==
Oxidative stability is a measure of oil or fat resistance to oxidation. Because the process takes place through a chain reaction, the oxidation reaction has a period when it is relatively slow, before it suddenly speeds up. The time for this to happen is called the &quot;induction time&quot;, and it is repeatable under identical conditions (temperature, air flow, etc.). There are a number of ways to measure the progress of the oxidation reaction. One of the most popular methods currently in use is the Rancimat method.

The Rancimat method is carried out using an air current at temperatures between 50 and 220 °C. The volatile oxidation products (largely formic acid) are carried by the air current into the measuring vessel, where they are absorbed (dissolve) in the measuring fluid (distilled water). By continuous measurement of the conductivity of this solution, oxidation curves can be generated. The cusp point of the oxidation curve (the point where a rapid rise in the conductivity starts) gives the induction time of the rancidification reaction, and can be taken as an indication of the oxidative stability of the sample.

The Rancimat method, the oxidative stability instrument (OSI) and the oxidograph were all developed as automatic versions of the more complicated AOM (active oxygen method), which is based on measuring peroxide values for determining the induction time of fats and oils. Over time, the Rancimat method has become established, and it has been accepted into a number of national and international standards, for example AOCS Cd 12b-92 and ISO 6886.

<text>John Behan (born 1938) is an Irish sculptor from Dublin.

==Career==
Behan studied at the National College of Art and Design in Dublin, and Ealing Art College, London, as well as Oslo&#x27;s Royal Academy School. He is a member of Aosdána.

Behan helped establish the Project Arts Centre in Dublin in 1967, and the Dublin Art Foundry. He also participated in the Irish Exhibition of Living Art and shows at the Royal Hibernian Academy.

==Selected works==
Notable Behan sculptures include &quot;Arrival&quot;, commissioned by the Irish government and presented to the United Nations in 2000, and &quot;Wings of the World&quot; in Shenzhen, China, 1991.

In the mid-1990s, Behan was commissioned by the Irish government to create a National Famine Memorial that would encompass the magnitude of the suffering and loss endured by the people of Ireland during the Famine period. The memorial, located in Murrisk, County Mayo, was unveiled by Mary Robinson on 20 July 1997.

The Liberty Tree sculpture in Carlow, designed by John Behan, commemorates the 1798 Rising of the United Irishmen. Several hundred rebels were slain in Carlow town and their remains are buried in the &#x27;Croppies Grave&#x27;, in Graiguecullen, County Carlow.

<doc id="198713" wikidata="Q160714" url="?curid=198713" title="Willibrord">
<text>Willibrord (; 658 – 7 November AD 739) was an Anglo-Saxon monk, bishop, and missionary. He became the first Bishop of Utrecht in what is now the Netherlands, dying at Echternach in Luxembourg, and is known as the &quot;Apostle to the Frisians&quot;.

==Early life==

His father, named Wilgils or Hilgis, was styled by Alcuin as a Saxon of Northumbria.

Newly converted to Christianity, Wilgils entrusted his son as an oblate to Ripon Abbey, and withdrew from the world, constructing a small oratory, near the mouth of the Humber, dedicated to Saint Andrew. The king and nobles of the district endowed him with estates until he was at last able to build a church, over which Alcuin afterwards ruled.

Willibrord grew up under the influence of Wilfrid, Bishop of York. Later he joined the Benedictines. He spent the years between the ages of 20 and 32 in the Abbey of Rath Melsigi, in County Carlow in southern Ireland, which was a centre of European learning in the 7th century.

==Frisia==
During this time he studied under Ecgberht of Ripon, who sent him and eleven companions to Christianise the pagan Frisians of the North Sea coast at the request of Pepin of Herstal, Austrasian mayor of the palace, who had nominal suzerainty over that region. Willibrord travelled to Rome twice. Both of these trips to Rome have historical significance.

According to Bede, Willibrord was not the only Anglo-Saxon to travel to Rome. The way in which he described the visit and its purpose is important; unlike all the others, Willibrord was not on the usual pilgrimage to the graves of the apostles Peter and Paul and the martyrs. Rather, &quot;he made haste to Rome, where Pope Sergius then presided over the apostolical see, that he might undertake the desired work of preaching the Gospel to the Gentiles, with his licence and blessing&quot;. As such he came to the pope not as a pilgrim but specifically as a missionary. The second time he went to Rome, on 21 November 695, in the Church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, Pope Sergius I gave him a pallium and consecrated him as bishop of the Frisians. He returned to Frisia to preach and establish churches, among them a monastery at Utrecht, where he built his cathedral. Willibrord is counted the first bishop of Utrecht.

In 698 he established the Abbey of Echternach on the site of a Roman villa in Echternach, which was donated to him by Pepin&#x27;s mother-in-law, Irmina of Oeren, the wife of seneschal and Count Palatine Hugobert. After Hugobert died, Irmina founded a Benedictine convent at Horren in Trier. When a plague threatened her community, she gained the help of Willibrord; and when the pestilence passed by the convent, she gave Willibrord the lands for his abbey in Echternach.

Pepin of Heristal died in 714. In 716 the pagan Radbod, king of the Frisians, retook possession of Frisia, burning churches and killing many missionaries. Willibrord and his monks were forced to flee. After the death of Radbod in 719, Willibrord returned to resume his work, under the protection of Charles Martel. He repaired the damage done there, ably assisted by Boniface.

==Veneration==

Willibrord died on 7 November 739 at the age of 81, and according to his wish, was buried in Echternach. He was quickly judged to be a saint. Willibrord wells, which skirted his missionary routes, were visited by the people, to solicit the healing of various nervous diseases, especially of children.

In the Catholic Church his feast day is celebrated on 7 November outside England, but on 29 November in England, by order of Pope Leo XIII. Willibrord is honoured in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church (US) on 7 November.

Numerous miracles and relics have been attributed to him. On one occasion, the transport of his relics was celebrated thus: &quot;the five bishops in full pontificals assisted; engaged in the dance were 2 Swiss guards, 16 standard-bearers, 3,045 singers, 136 priests, 426 musicians, 15,085 dancers, and 2,032 players&quot;. A dancing procession continues to be held in Echternach every year on Whit Tuesday, and attracts thousands of participants and an equal number of spectators, to honour the memory of a saint who is often called the apostle of the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg).

At Gravelines in northern France, where Willibrord is said to have landed after crossing the Channel on his mission to the Frisians, the church in the old town is dedicated to him. Gravelines grew up after around the chapel commemorating Willibrord&#x27;s mission.

There is a 13th-century chapel dedicated to Willibrord at Weissenburg Abbey, Alsace, where Willibrord&#x27;s benefactress Irmina of Oeren was also venerated.

==Sources==
A &quot;Life&quot; was written by Alcuin and dedicated to the Abbot of Echternach. Alcuin probably made use of an older one written by a British monk, which is now lost. Bede also makes mention of Willibrord.
Nothing written by Willibrord can be found save a marginal note in the Calendar of Echternach giving some chronological data. The Echternach Gospels, a copy of the Gospels (Bibliothèque nationale, Paris, 9389) under the name of Willibrord is an Irish codex no doubt brought by Willibrord from Ireland.

In 752/753 Boniface wrote a letter to Pope Stephen II, in which he says that Willibrord destroyed the Frisian pagan sanctuaries and temples.

In Alcuin&#x27;s &quot;Life of Willibrord&quot; there are two texts about Willibrord and pagan places of worship. In one he arrived with his companions in Walcheren in the Netherlands, where he smashed a sculpture of the ancient religion. In the second text passage Willibord arrived on an island called Fositesland (possibly Heligoland) where a pagan god named Fosite was worshipped. Here he despoiled this god of its sanctity by using the god&#x27;s sacred well for baptisms and the sacred cattle for food.

<text>Frank Joseph Christian (September 3, 1887 – November 27, 1973) was an American early jazz trumpeter.
==Career==
Frank Joseph Christian was born in the Bywater neighborhood of downtown New Orleans, Louisiana. In an interview for Tulane&#x27;s Jazz Archives, he described his family ancestry as &quot;cayudle&quot;, a Creole French term for a mutt or mongrel. His brothers Charles (1886–1964) and Emile Christian also worked as professional musicians. Frank showed musical versatility at a young age, and was playing trumpet, clarinet, violin, and tuba professionally by his teens.

He started working with bandleader Papa Jack Laine about 1908 and became a mainstay in Laine&#x27;s bands. He also worked in the bands of Tom Brown, Johnny Fischer, and led his own band.

In 1916 Frank Christian was the first choice of Alcide Nunez, Eddie Edwards, and Johnny Stein to play in a band they had been hired to bring north to Chicago. Christian initially agreed and rehearsed with the band before it left for the north, but then backed down as he had a full schedular of job offers in New Orleans and thought this less risky than leaving town. Christian was replaced by Nick LaRocca, and thus Frank Christian missed his chance to be in the Original Dixieland Jass Band which made the first jazz recordings in 1917.

After hearing of the commercial success of the O.D.J.B. and other New Orleans musicians who went north, Christian went to play in Chicago with Fischer and Anton Lada. He then went to New York City in response to an offer to start a New Orleans style band to play at a Manhattan dance club called The Alamo. When Christian arrived in New York, Nick LaRocca of the Original Dixieland Jass Band was concerned about competition and offered Christian $200 and a return railway ticket to go back to New Orleans; Christian turned the offer down. He formed the Original New Orleans Jazz Band with whom he recorded on cornet in 1918 and 1919. He was originally the leader of the band, but later it was agreed to turn leadership over to the band&#x27;s extroverted pianist, Jimmie Durante.

After Durante broke up his band Frank Christian toured Vaudeville with Gilda Gray and played in various theater and dance bands through the 1920s.
==Death==
He returned home to work his later years in New Orleans, where he died in 1973.

<text>The virtual water trade is the hidden flow of water in food or other commodities that are traded from one place to another. Other terms for it are embedded or embodied water. The virtual water trade is the idea that virtual water is exchanged along with goods and services. This idea provides a new, amplified perspective on water problems. It balances different perspectives, basic conditions, and interests. This concept makes it possible to distinguish between global, regional, and local levels and their linkages. However, the use of virtual water estimates may offer no guidance for policymakers seeking to ensure they are meeting environmental objectives.

For example, cereal grains have been major carriers of virtual water in countries where water resources are scarce. So cereal imports can compensate for local water deficits. However, low-income countries may not be able to afford such imports in the future. This could lead to food insecurity and starvation.

==Concept==
The virtual water concept, also known as embodied water, was coined by John Anthony Allan (Tony Allan) in 1993. He received the Stockholm Water Prize for the concept in 2008.

The virtual water trade is the idea that when goods and services are exchanged, so is virtual water. When a country imports one tonne of wheat instead of producing it domestically, it is saving about 1,300 cubic meters of real indigenous water. If this country is water-scarce, the water that is &#x27;saved&#x27; can be used towards other ends. If the exporting country is water-scarce, however, it has exported 1,300 cubic meters of virtual water since the real water used to grow the wheat will no longer be available for other purposes. This has obvious strategic implications for countries that are water-constrained such as those found in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) area.

Water-scarce countries like Israel discourage the export of oranges (relatively water intensive crops) precisely to prevent large quantities of water from being exported to different parts of the world.

In recent years, the concept of virtual water trade has gained weight both in the scientific as well as in the political debate. The notion of the concept is ambiguous. It changes between an analytical, descriptive concept and a political induced strategy. As an analytical concept, virtual water trade represents an instrument that allows the identification and assessment of policy options not only in the scientific but also in the political discourse. As a politically induced strategy, the question if virtual water trade can be implemented in a sustainable way, whether the implementation can be managed in a social, economical, and ecological fashion, and for which countries the concept offers a meaningful option.

The data that underlie the concept of virtual water can readily be used to construct water satellite accounts, and brought into economic models of international trade such as the GTAP Computable General Equilibrium Model. Such a model can be used to study the economic implications of changes in the water supply or water policy, as well as the water resource implications of economic development and trade liberalization.

In sum, virtual water trade allows a new, amplified perspective on water problems: In the framework of recent developments from a supply-oriented to demand-oriented management of water resources, it opens up new fields of governance and facilitates differentiation and balancing of different perspectives, basic conditions, and interests. Analytically, the concept enables one to distinguish between global, regional, and local levels and their linkages. This means, that water resource problems have to be solved in &quot;problems&quot; if they cannot be successfully addressed in the local or regional watershed. Virtual water trade can thus overcome the hydro-centricity of a narrow watershed view. According to the proceedings of a 2006 conference in Frankfurt, Germany, it seems reasonable to link the new concept with the approach of integrated water resources management.

===Water footprint===
The concept of virtual water trade was introduced to refer to the idea that countries can save domestic water by importing food. Imported food, however, comes from somewhere. In 2002, Arjen Y. Hoekstra, while working for UNESCO-IHE, introduced the concept of water footprint.
The water footprint shows the link between consumer goods or a consumption pattern and water use and pollution. Virtual water trade and water footprint can be seen as part of a bigger story: the globalization of water.

For instance, it takes 1,340 cubic meters of water (based on the world average) to produce one tonne of wheat. The precise volume can be more or less depending on climatic conditions and agricultural practice. Hoekstra has defined the virtual-water content of a product (a commodity, good or service) as &quot;the volume of freshwater used to produce the product, measured at the place where the product was actually produced&quot;. It refers to the sum of the water use in the various steps of the production chain.

===Embodied energy===
Some researchers have attempted to use the methods of energy analysis, which aim to produce embodied energy estimates, to derive virtual, or embodied water estimates.

== Virtual water content of selected products ==
The following table shows the average virtual water content of some selected products for a number of selected countries (m3/ton):
== Limitations ==
The virtual water or the water footprint concepts have faced some criticism. Australia&#x27;s National Water Commission considers that the measurement of virtual water has little practical value in decision making regarding the best allocation of scarce water resources. 

Other limitations more specific to the MENA (the Middle East &amp; North Africa) region include the fact that importing food could pose the risk of further political dependence. The notion of &quot;self-sufficiency&quot; has always been the pride of the MENA region.

<doc id="198717" wikidata="Q1872117" url="?curid=198717" title="Louis le Brocquy">
<text>Louis le Brocquy &quot;HRHA&quot; (; 10 November 1916 – 25 April 2012) was an Irish painter born in Dublin to Albert and Sybil le Brocquy. Louis&#x27; sister is the sculptor Melanie Le Brocquy. His work received many accolades in a career that spanned some seventy years of creative practice. In 1956, he represented Ireland at the Venice Biennale, winning the &quot;Premio Acquisito Internationale&quot; (a once-off award when the event was acquired by the Nestle Corporation) with &quot;A Family&quot; (National Gallery of Ireland), subsequently included in the historic exhibition &quot;Fifty Years of Modern Art&quot; Brussels, World Fair 1958. The same year he married the Irish painter Anne Madden and left London to work in the French Midi.

==Education==
Le Brocquy was educated at St Gerard&#x27;s School, studied chemistry at Kevin Street Technical School in 1934, and then Trinity College Dublin.

==Work==
Le Brocquy is widely acclaimed for his evocative &quot;Portrait Heads&quot; of literary figures and fellow artists. These include William Butler Yeats, James Joyce, and his friends Samuel Beckett, Francis Bacon and Seamus Heaney. Towards the end of his life, le Brocquy&#x27;s early &quot;Tinker&quot; subjects and Grey period &quot;Family&quot; paintings attracted attention on the international marketplace, placing le Brocquy within a very select group of British and Irish artists whose works commanded prices in excess of £1 million during their lifetimes, a group that includes Lucian Freud, David Hockney, Frank Auerbach, and Francis Bacon.

The artist&#x27;s work is represented in numerous public collections from the Guggenheim, New York to the Tate Modern, London. In Ireland, he is honoured as the first and only painter to be included during his lifetime in the &quot;Permanent Irish Collection&quot; of the National Gallery of Ireland. Le Brocquy died on 25 April 2012 and was survived by his daughter Seyre from his first marriage (1938–1948) to Jean Stoney, and his two grandsons John-Paul and David; his second wife Anne Madden whom he married in 1958, and their two sons, Pierre and Alexis.

Le Brocquy designed the covers for the albums &quot;Lark in the Morning&quot; and &quot;The Rising of the Moon&quot;.

Le Brocquy illustrated Thomas Kinsella&#x27;s 1969 translation of &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot;. In this series of illustrations, Le Brocquy developed a distinctive style which alluded to cave painting, Rorschach tests and calligraphy. The Louis le Brocquy Táin illustrations are the works, and style of work, most closely associated with the artist in Ireland.

<text>Edward Delaney (1930 – 22 September 2009) was an Irish sculptor born in Claremorris in County Mayo in 1930. His best-known works include the 1967 statue of Wolfe Tone and famine memorial at the northeastern corner of St Stephen&#x27;s Green in Dublin and the statue of Thomas Davis in College Green, opposite Trinity College Dublin. These are both examples of lost-wax bronze castings, his main technique during the 1960s and early 1970s.

==Biography, early successes and awards==
Edward Delaney attended the National College of Art and Design in Dublin and, supported by the Irish Arts Council, studied casting in Germany. He represented Ireland at the Biennale de Paris in 1959 and 1961.

He represented Ireland at the Paris Biennale (1959 and 1961) and at the World Fair in New York (1965). He has also shown in New York, Tokyo, Buenos Aires, and Budapest. At home, he exhibited in the Hendriks, Royal Hibernian Academy, Davis and Solomon Galleries, and in the Project Arts Centre, amongst others.

Some of his awards and scholarships include: a West German fellowship for sculpture (1956–57); the Bavarian State Foreign Students Sculpture Prize (1958); the Italian Government Scholarship for sculpture (1959–60); the Arts Council of Ireland Sculpture prizes (1962 and 1964); and the Royal Hibernian Academy Award for Sculpture of Distinction in Bronze (1991).

Delaney married Nancy O&#x27;Brien in 1961 with whom he had five children. When his marriage broke up, around 1980, he moved to Galway. There he met Dr Anne Gillen, by whom he had two children. He was a member of Aosdána. He died on 22 September 2009, at the age of 79. 

His firstborn, Eamon Delaney unveiled a sculpted monument in his honour in 2013. His daughter, Catherine Delaney, is also an artist and a member of Aosdána.

==Style==
Though they do exhibit some of his trademark expressionism, the statues of Wolfe Tone and Thomas Davis are less abstract than was most of his work at the time; the famine memorial is more typical in this regard. However, arts writer Judith Hill points out that these statues make no attempt at an exact likeness of the figures they portray, instead, they communicate the public stature of their subjects and, indeed, the public role of memorial statues through their proportions and scale. In this way, it is argued, they mark the transition from memorial and public art.

What all Edward Delaney&#x27;s work shares is robustness, in an Irish Times review of his 2004 retrospective, arts writer Aidan Dunne described his bronzes as robust but having an awkwardness, a tenderness about them.

From 1980 onwards, Edward Delaney concentrated on large-scale environmental pieces and stainless steel works in Carraroe, County Galway. The Royal Hibernian Academy held a retrospective of his work in 1992 and again in 2004.

==Major collections==
Works are in many major collections, including the Central Bank of Ireland, Dublin; Bank of Ireland; Allied Irish Banks; Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, Dublin; Ulster Museum, Belfast; Waterford Museum; Office of Public Works, Dublin; First National Bank of Chicago; First National City Bank of New York; An Chomhairle Ealaíon/The Irish Arts Council; KLM Airlines Headquarters, New York; Irish Management Institute, Dublin; Jefferson Smurfit Group Ltd.; Norman B.Arnoff, New York; University College, Dublin, and the Abbey Theatre, Dublin.

A large body of Delaney&#x27;s work was formerly to be seen at the Open Air Sculpture Park in Carraroe in the west of Ireland.

An example of the work of the late Edward Delaney RHA was unveiled in his native town of Crossboyne, Claremorris, County Mayo, Ireland on Saturday, 6 July 2013. The sculpture entitled &#x27;Integration&#x27; comprises an abstract stainless steel globe and has been donated by the family. It was situated in a specially developed park, opposite Crossboyne church, near Claremorris, which has also been donated by the family. The public sculpture was unveiled by Edward&#x27;s son the author and journalist Eamon Delaney at the event attended by many of the late artist&#x27;s family, friends and neighbours.

<doc id="198725" wikidata="Q7892" url="?curid=198725" title="Drinking water">
<text>Drinking water or potable water is water that is safe for ingestion, either when drunk directly in liquid form or consumed indirectly through food preparation. It is often (but not always) supplied through taps, in which case it is also called tap water. 

The amount of drinking water required to maintain good health varies, and depends on physical activity level, age, health-related issues, and environmental conditions. For those who work in a hot climate, up to a day may be required.

About 1 to 2 billion people lack safe drinking water. Water can carry vectors of disease and is a major cause of death and illness worldwide. Developing countries are most affected by unsafe drinking water.

== Sources ==

Potable water is available in almost all populated areas of the world, although it may be expensive, and the supply may not always be sustainable. Sources where drinking water is commonly obtained include springs, hyporheic zones and aquifers (groundwater), from rainwater harvesting, surface water (from rivers, streams, glaciers), or desalinated seawater.

For these water sources to be consumed safely, they must receive adequate water treatment and meet drinking water quality standards.

An experimental source is atmospheric water generators.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41586-021-03900-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Springs are often used as sources for bottled waters.

== Supply ==
The most efficient and convenient way to transport and deliver potable water is through pipes. Plumbing can require significant capital investment. Some systems suffer high operating costs. The cost to replace the deteriorating water and sanitation infrastructure of industrialized countries may be as high as $200 billion a year. Leakage of untreated and treated water from pipes reduces access to water. Leakage rates of 50% are not uncommon in urban systems.

Tap water, delivered by domestic water systems refers to water piped to homes and delivered to a tap or spigot.

== Quantity ==

===Usage for general household use===
In the United States, the typical water consumption per capita, at home, is of water per day. Of this, only 1% of the water provided by public water suppliers is for drinking and cooking. Uses include (in decreasing order) toilets, washing machines, showers, baths, faucets, and leaks. 

===Usage for drinking===
===Animals===
The qualitative and quantitative aspects of drinking water requirements on domesticated animals are studied and described within the context of animal husbandry. For example, a farmer might plan for per day for a dairy cow, a third of that for a horse, and a tenth of that for a hog.

However, relatively few studies have been focused on the drinking behavior of wild animals.

==Quality==


According to the World Health Organization&#x27;s 2017 report, &quot;safe&quot; &quot;drinking water&quot; is water that &quot;does not represent any significant risk to health over a lifetime of consumption, including different sensitivities that may occur between life stages&quot;.

According to a report by UNICEF and UNESCO, Finland has the best drinking water quality in the world.

=== Parameters to monitor quality ===
Parameters for drinking water quality typically fall within three categories: microbiological, chemical, physical.

Microbiological parameters include coliform bacteria, &quot;E. coli&quot;, and specific pathogenic species of bacteria (such as cholera-causing &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;), viruses, and protozoan parasites. Originally, fecal contamination was determined with the presence of coliform bacteria, a convenient marker for a class of harmful fecal pathogens. The presence of fecal coliforms (like &quot;E. Coli&quot;) serves as an indication of contamination by sewage. Additional contaminants include protozoan oocysts such as &quot;Cryptosporidium sp.&quot;, &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot;, &quot;Legionella&quot;, and viruses (enteric). Microbial pathogenic parameters are typically of greatest concern because of their immediate health risk.

Physical and chemical parameters include heavy metals, trace organic compounds, total suspended solids, and turbidity. Chemical parameters tend to pose more of a chronic health risk through buildup of heavy metals although some components like nitrates/nitrites and arsenic can have a more immediate impact. Physical parameters affect the aesthetics and taste of the drinking water and may complicate the removal of microbial pathogens.

Pesticides are also potential drinking water contaminants of the category &quot;chemical contaminants&quot;. Pesticides may be present in drinking water in low concentrations, but the toxicity of the chemical and the extent of human exposure are factors that are used to determine the specific health risk.

Perfluorinated alkylated substances (PFAS) are a group of synthetic compounds used in a large variety of consumer products, such as food packaging, waterproof fabrics, carpeting and cookware. PFAS are known to persist in the environment and are commonly described as persistent organic pollutants. PFAS chemicals have been detected in blood, both humans and animals, worldwide, as well as in food products, water, air and soil. Animal testing studies with PFAS have shown effects on growth and development, and possibly effects on reproduction, thyroid, the immune system and liver. As of 2022 the health impacts of many PFAS compounds are not understood. Scientists are conducting research to determine the extent and severity of impacts from PFAS on human health. PFAS have been widely detected in drinking water worldwide and regulations have been developed, or are under development, in many countries.

===Drinking water quality standards===
== Health issues due to low quality ==

The World Health Organization considers access to safe drinking-water a basic human right.
Contaminated water is estimated to result in more than half a million deaths per year. More people die from unsafe water than from war, then-U.N. secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said in 2010. Contaminated water together with the lack of sanitation was estimated to cause about one percent of disability adjusted life years worldwide in 2010. According to the WHO, the most common diseases linked with poor water quality are cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio.

One of the main causes for contaminated drinking water in developing countries is lack of sanitation and poor hygiene. For this reason, the quantification of the burden of disease from consuming contaminated drinking water usually looks at water, sanitation and hygiene aspects together. The acronym for this is WASH - standing for &quot;water, sanitation and hygiene&quot;.

===Diarrhea, malnutrition and stunting===

===Consumption of contaminated groundwater===
Sixty million people are estimated to have been poisoned by well water contaminated by excessive fluoride, which dissolved from granite rocks. The effects are particularly evident in the bone deformations of children. Similar or larger problems are anticipated in other countries including China, Uzbekistan, and Ethiopia. Although helpful for dental health in low dosage, fluoride in large amounts interferes with bone formation.

Long-term consumption of water with high fluoride concentration (&gt; 1.5 ppm F) can have serious undesirable consequences such as dental fluorosis, enamel mottle and skeletal fluorosis, bone deformities in children. Fluorosis severity depends on how much fluoride is present in the water, as well as people&#x27;s diet and physical activity. Defluoridation methods include membrane-based methods, precipitation, absorption, and electrocoagulation.

Natural arsenic contamination of groundwater is a global threat with 140 million people affected in 70 countries globally.

=== Examples of poor drinking water quality incidents ===
Some well-known examples of water quality problems with drinking water supplies include:
* In 1854, a cholera outbreak in London&#x27;s Soho district was identified by John Snow as originating from contaminated water from the Broad Street pump. This can be regarded as a founding event of the science of epidemiology.
* Contamination of groundwater with arsenic in Bangladesh; considered to be &quot;the largest-scale mass poisoning of a population&quot; (began in the 1970s–1980s, officially recognized in 1993)
* Hinkley groundwater contamination (Chromium-6 contamination of private groundwater wells in Hinkley, California, United States (settled in 1996).
* Walkerton &quot;E. coli&quot; outbreak (&quot;Escherichia coli&quot; O157:H7 and &quot;Campylobacter&quot; contamination of water supply in Walkerton, Ontario, Canada in 2000). In 2000, an E. coli outbreak occurred in Walkerton, Ontario, Canada. Seven people died from drinking contaminated water. Hundreds suffered from the symptoms of the disease, not knowing if they too would die.
* Flint water crisis (lead and &quot;Legionella&quot; contamination of water supply in Flint, Michigan, United States, started in 2014)
* Jackson, Mississippi, water crisis, United States (2022)
Water supply can get contaminated by pathogens which may originate from human excreta, for example due to a breakdown or design fault in the sanitation system, or by chemical contaminants.

Further examples of contamination include:
* In 1987, a cryptosporidiosis outbreak is caused by the public water supply of which the filtration was contaminated, in western Georgia
* In 1993, Milwaukee Cryptosporidium outbreak
* In 1998, an outbreak of typhoid fever in northern Israel, which was associated with the contaminated municipal water supply
* In 1997, 369 cases of cryptosporidiosis occurred, caused by a contaminated fountain in the Minnesota zoo. Most of the sufferers were children
* In 1998, a non-chlorinated municipal water supply was blamed for a campylobacteriosis outbreak in northern Finland
* In 2000, a gastroenteritis outbreak that was brought by a non-chlorinated community water supply, in southern Finland
* In 2004, contamination of the community water supply, serving the Bergen city centre of Norway, was later reported after the outbreak of waterborne giardiasis
* In 2007, contaminated drinking water was pinpointed which had led to the outbreak of gastroenteritis with multiple aetiologies in Denmark

Examples of chemical contamination include:
* In 1988, many people were poisoned in Camelford, when a worker put 20 tonnes of aluminium sulphate coagulant in the wrong tank.
* In 1993, a fluoride poisoning outbreak resulting from overfeeding of fluoride, in Mississippi
* In 2019 oil for an electric transformer oil entered the water supply for the city of Uummannaq in Greenland. A cargo ship in harbour was able to maintain a minimum supply to the city for two days until the mains supply was restored and flushing of all the pipework was started.

==Treatment==

Most water requires some treatment before use; even water from deep wells or springs. The extent of treatment depends on the source of the water. Appropriate technology options in water treatment include both community-scale and household-scale point-of-use (POU) designs. Only a few large urban areas such as Christchurch, New Zealand have access to sufficiently pure water of sufficient volume that no treatment of the raw water is required.

In emergency situations when conventional treatment systems have been compromised, waterborne pathogens may be killed or inactivated by boiling but this requires abundant sources of fuel, and can be very onerous on consumers, especially where it is difficult to store boiled water in sterile conditions. Other techniques, such as filtration, chemical disinfection, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation (including solar UV) have been demonstrated in an array of randomized control trials to significantly reduce levels of water-borne disease among users in low-income countries, but these suffer from the same problems as boiling methods.

Another type of water treatment is called desalination and is used mainly in dry areas with access to large bodies of saltwater.

Publicly available treated water has historically been associated with major increases in life expectancy and improved public health. Water disinfection can greatly reduce the risks of waterborne diseases such as typhoid and cholera. Chlorination is currently the most widely used water disinfection method, although chlorine compounds can react with substances in water and produce disinfection by-products (DBP) that pose problems to human health. Local geological conditions affecting groundwater are determining factors for the presence of various metal ions, often rendering the water &quot;soft&quot; or &quot;hard&quot;.

In the event of contamination of drinking water, government officials typically issue an advisory regarding water consumption. In the case of biological contamination, residents are usually advised to boil their water before consumption or to use bottled water as an alternative. In the case of chemical contamination, residents may be advised to refrain from consuming tap water entirely until the matter is resolved.

===Point of use methods===
The ability of point of use (POU) options to reduce disease is a function of both their ability to remove microbial pathogens if properly applied and such social factors as ease of use and cultural appropriateness. Technologies may generate more (or less) health benefit than their lab-based microbial removal performance would suggest.

The current priority of the proponents of POU treatment is to reach large numbers of low-income households on a sustainable basis. Few POU measures have reached significant scale thus far, but efforts to promote and commercially distribute these products to the world&#x27;s poor have only been under way for a few years.

Solar water disinfection is a low-cost method of purifying water that can often be implemented with locally available materials. Unlike methods that rely on firewood, it has low impact on the environment.

=== Addition of fluoride ===
In many areas, low concentration of fluoride (&lt; 1.0 ppm F) is intentionally added to tap water to improve dental health, although in some communities water fluoridation remains a controversial issue. (See water fluoridation controversy).

== Global access ==
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), &quot;access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection.&quot; In 1990, only 76 percent of the global population had access to drinking water. By 2015 that number had increased to 91 percent. In 1990, most countries in Latin America, East and South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa were well below 90%. In Sub-Saharan Africa, where the rates are lowest, household access ranges from 40 to 80 percent. Countries that experience violent conflict can have reductions in drinking water access: One study found that a conflict with about 2,500 battle deaths deprives 1.8% of the population of potable water.
Typically in developed countries, tap water meets drinking water quality standards, even though only a small proportion is actually consumed or used in food preparation. Other typical uses for tap water include washing, toilets, and irrigation. Greywater may also be used for toilets or irrigation. Its use for irrigation however may be associated with risks.

Globally, by 2015, 89% of people had access to water from a source that is suitable for drinkingcalled improved water sources. In sub-Saharan Africa, access to potable water ranged from 40% to 80% of the population. Nearly 4.2 billion people worldwide had access to tap water, while another 2.4 billion had access to wells or public taps. 

By 2015, 5.2 billion people representing 71% of the global population used safely managed drinking water services. As of 2017, 90% of people having access to water from a source that is suitable for drinkingcalled &quot;improved water source&quot;and 71% of the world could access safely managed drinking water that is clean and available on-demand. Estimates suggest that at least 25% of improved sources contain fecal contamination. 1.8 billion people still use an unsafe drinking water source which may be contaminated by feces. This can result in infectious diseases, such as gastroenteritis, cholera, and typhoid, among others. Reduction of waterborne diseases and development of safe water resources is a major public health goal in developing countries. In 2017, almost 22 million Americans drank from water systems that were in violation of public health standards, which could contribute to citizens developing water-borne illnesses. Safe drinking water is an environmental health concern. Bottled water is sold for public consumption in most parts of the world.

Improved sources are also monitored based on whether water is available when needed (5.8 billion people), located on premises (5.4 billion), free from contamination (5.4 billion), and within a 30-minute round trip. While improved water sources such as protected piped water are more likely to provide safe and adequate water as they may prevent contact with human excreta, for example, this is not always the case. According to a 2014 study, approximately 25% of improved sources contained fecal contamination.

The population in Australia, New Zealand, North America and Europe have achieved nearly universal basic drinking water services.

Because of the high initial investments, many less wealthy nations cannot afford to develop or sustain appropriate infrastructure, and as a consequence people in these areas may spend a correspondingly higher fraction of their income on water. 2003 statistics from El Salvador, for example, indicate that the poorest 20% of households spend more than 10% of their total income on water. In the United Kingdom, authorities define spending of more than 3% of one&#x27;s income on water as a hardship.

=== Global monitoring of access ===
The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation is the official United Nations mechanism tasked with monitoring progress towards the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) relating to drinking-water and sanitation (MDG 7, Target 7c), which is to: &quot;Halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking-water and basic sanitation&quot;.

Access to safe drinking water is indicated by safe water sources. These improved drinking water sources include household connection, public standpipe, borehole condition, protected dug well, protected spring, and rain water collection. Sources that do not encourage improved drinking water to the same extent as previously mentioned include: unprotected wells, unprotected springs, rivers or ponds, vender-provided water, bottled water (consequential of limitations in quantity, not quality of water), and tanker truck water. Access to sanitary water comes hand in hand with access to improved sanitation facilities for excreta, such as connection to public sewer, connection to septic system, or a pit latrine with a slab or water seal.

According to this indicator on improved water sources, the MDG was met in 2010, five years ahead of schedule. Over 2 billion more people used improved drinking water sources in 2010 than did in 1990. However, the job is far from finished. 780 million people are still without improved sources of drinking water, and many more people still lack safe drinking water. Estimates suggest that at least 25% of improved sources contain fecal contamination and an estimated 1.8 billion people globally use a source of drinking water that suffers from fecal contamination. The quality of these sources varies over time and often gets worse during the wet season. Continued efforts are needed to reduce urban-rural disparities and inequities associated with poverty; to dramatically increase safe drinking water coverage in countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania; to promote global monitoring of drinking water quality; and to look beyond the MDG target towards universal coverage.

== Regulations ==

Guidelines for the assessment and improvement of service activities relating to drinking water have been published in the form of drinking water quality standards such as ISO 24510.

=== European Union ===
For example, the EU sets legislation on water quality. &quot;Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy&quot;, known as the water framework directive, is the primary piece of legislation governing water. This drinking water directive relates specifically to water intended for human consumption. Each member state is responsible for establishing the required policing measures to ensure that the legislation is implemented. For example, in the UK the Water Quality Regulations prescribe maximum values for substances that affect wholesomeness and the Drinking Water Inspectorate polices the water companies.

=== Japan ===
To improve water quality, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Health revised its water quality standards, which were implemented in April 2004. Numerous professionals developed the drinking water standards. They also determined ways to manage the high quality water system. In 2008, improved regulations were conducted to improve the water quality and reduce the risk of water contamination.

=== New Zealand ===

The Water Services Act 2021 brought Taumata Arowai&#x27; into existence as the new regulator of drinking water and waste water treatment in New Zealand. Initial activities including the establishment of a national register of water suppliers and establishing a network of accredited laboratories for drinking water and waste water analysis

=== Singapore ===

Singapore is a significant importer of water from neighbouring Malaysia but also has made great efforts to reclaim as much used water as possible to ensure adequate provision for the very crowded city-state. Their reclaimed water is marketed as NEWater. Singapore updated its water quality regulation in 2019, setting standards consistent with the WHO recommended standards. Monitoring is undertaken by the Environmental Public Health Department of the Singaporean Government

=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom regulation of water supplies is a devolved matter to the Welsh and Scottish Parliaments and the Northern Ireland Assembly.

In England and Wales there are two water industry regulatory authorities.
* Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat) is the economic regulator of the water sector; it protects the interests of consumers by promoting effective competition and ensuring that water companies carry out their statutory functions. Ofwat has a management board comprising a chairman, Chief Executive and Executive and Non-Executive members. There is a staff of about 240.
* The Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) provides independent assurance that the privatised water industry delivers safe, clean drinking water to consumers. The DWI was established in 1990 and comprises a Chief Inspector of Drinking Water and a team of about 40 people. The current standards of water quality are defined in Statutory Instrument 2016 No. 614 the Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2016.

The functions and duties of the bodies are formally defined in the Water Industry Act 1991 (1991 c. 56) as amended by the Water Act 2003 (2003 c. 37) and the Water Act 2014 (2014 c. 21).

In Scotland water quality is the responsibility of independent Drinking Water Quality Regulator (DWQR).

In Northern Ireland the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) regulates drinking water quality of public and private supplies. The current standards of water quality are defined in the Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2017.

=== United States ===

== History ==
In drinking water access, quality and quantity are both important parameters but the quantity is often prioritized. Throughout human history, water quality has been a constant and ongoing challenge. Certain crises have led to major changes in knowledge, policy, and regulatory structures. The drivers of change can vary: the cholera epidemic in the 1850s in London led John Snow to further our understanding of waterborne diseases. However, London&#x27;s sanitary revolution was driven by political motivations and social priorities before the science was accepted.

<text>The Church of St Mary the Virgin, widely known as St Mary Redcliffe, is the main Church of England parish church for the Redcliffe district of the city of Bristol, England. The first reference to a church on the site appears in 1158, with the present building dating from 1185 to 1872. The church is considered one of the country&#x27;s finest and largest parish churches as well as an outstanding example of English Gothic architecture. The church is so large it is sometimes mistaken for Bristol Cathedral by tourists. The building has Grade I listed status, the highest possible category, by Historic England.

The church is notable for its many large stained glass windows, decorative stone vaults, flying buttresses, rare hexagonal porch and massive Gothic spire. With a height of 274 feet (84 m) to the top of the weathervane, St Mary Redcliffe is the second-tallest structure in Bristol and the sixth-tallest parish church in the country. The church spire is a major Bristol landmark, visible from across the city and until the completion of Castle Park View in 2020, it was the tallest structure ever to have been erected in Bristol.

St Mary Redcliffe has received widespread critical acclaim from various architects, historians, poets, writers and monarchs. In 1541 the English topographer and antiquary John Leland, claimed it was &quot;the most beautiful of all churches&quot; he had seen in England. Queen Elizabeth I, on a visit to the church in 1574, was said to have described St Mary Redcliffe as &quot;The fairest, goodliest and most famous parish church in England&quot;. In 1628 Charles I similarly suggested that the church was &quot;one of the moste famous absolute fayrest and goodliest parish churches within the Realm of England.” 

Simon Jenkins gives St Mary Redcliffe the maximum five-star rating in his book &quot;&#x27;England&#x27;s Thousand Best Churches&quot;&#x27;, one of only eighteen to receive such a rating, describing it as a &quot;masterpiece of English Gothic&quot;; and Nikolaus Pevsner says that &quot;St Mary Redcliffe need not fear comparison with any other English parish church&quot;.

== History ==

=== Name and origins ===
Though some sources claim a church has been on the site since Saxon times, no such church is recorded in the Domesday Book, meaning that if a church existed, it had been demolished by 1086. The first recorded mention of a church in present-day Redcliffe is a charter signed by Henry II in 1158, confirming the endowments of the churches at Redcliffe and Bedminster to Old Sarum Cathedral. This charter implies therefore that a church already existed in Redcliffe during 1158, likely constructed sometime between 1086 and 1158.

The modern-day name of Redcliffe, now a district of Bristol, refers to the position of the church on its prominent red sandstone cliff above the River Avon, which at the time, was the location of the Port of Bristol. The original church was built and funded by the city&#x27;s wealthy merchants, some of whom may have reached present-day North America before Christopher Columbus, sailing from the Port of Bristol. Though the modern Port of Bristol is located further downstream, the original quayside still survives near the church, called Redcliffe Quay, where fragments of the red cliff can still be seen.

=== Gothic rebuilding ===
In 1185, a new north porch was constructed in the Early English Gothic style of the Purbeck subtype, similar to the new east end of Canterbury Cathedral, making this one of the earliest Gothic constructions in England, Canterbury being the earliest. Though repairs are recorded in the churchwardens&#x27; accounts in 1207, 1229 and 1230, the next major construction would not be undertaken until the end of the 13th century. 

In 1292, Simon de Burton, mayor of Bristol, founded the present church and began an ambitious programme of rebuilding. This began in 1294 with the construction of the massive northwest tower base and part of the present west wall. Construction paused until 1320 when the rest of the church was rebuilt into the Decorated Gothic style. The earliest work from this phase of construction is the exceptionally rare hexagonal north porch, which was built adjacent to the 1185 Early English porch in 1325, thus forming an inner (1185) and outer (1325) north porch.

The design influence for the unusual hexagonal shape of the north porch is unknown, with historians offering various suggestions. These include the Chapter House and Lady Chapel of nearby Wells Cathedral, constructed from 1310 onwards, which are the nearest example of similar work. Pevsner also suggests influences from Chinese and Islamic art and architecture, since frequent voyages were made to the east in this period. Islamic architecture contains frequent polygons and it is possible that given the Port of Bristol being amongst the largest and most important in England at the time, inspiration was sought from further afield.

From c. 1330, the south porch and nave aisle began to be rebuilt in the Decorated style, though with notable markings of the future Perpendicular style, which was soon to become the dominant style from the late 14th century onwards. Influences from Wells Cathedral can again be found here, most notably in the south porch, constructed in 1335. Construction continued with the completion of the tower and spire in the first half of the 14th century, followed by the south transept and then the Lady Chapel, the latter completed in 1385.

Though historians do not agree on precisely when it took place, there is a notable change in architectural style when comparing the north and south transepts with the choir and nave. The choir was most likely complete by the time of the Black Death in 1348 and though the north transept is built on a similar plan to the south transept, its internal features indicate a time when the Perpendicular style had succeeded the Decorated as the dominant style of architecture, most notably in the clerestory.

=== 15th century ===
The completion of the nave was the major task left at the beginning of the 15th century. The elevation of the nave walls is of a similar design to that of the choir but the interior vaulting is different, implying it is of a later date. Work continued on the nave and crossing during the first half of the 15th century until it was interrupted in 1445 or 1446 by the fall of the spire.

Though the exact year is uncertain, the top of the spire is recorded to have been struck by lightning in one of these two years. Meteorological records kept at the University of East Anglia make reference to storms with thunder and lightning in November and December 1446. This strike caused the top two-thirds of the spire to collapse, leaving St Mary Redcliffe with a stump-like spire, similar to the present-day appearance of St Mary&#x27;s Church in nearby Yatton.

It is unknown whether any damage was caused by the fall of the spire, though it is reported. If the wind had been from the southwest, the spire would have fallen onto the north porches, which show no sign of damage or alteration. If the wind had been from the northwest, the spire would have fallen onto the south porch, which does show signs of later alteration, with a vault of later design than the exterior elevation. Surviving evidence in the tower roof shows the spire did not fall down vertically, for the tower roof beams supporting the spire have been dated to the 14th century and they would not have survived such a collapse. William Worcestre&#x27;s 1480 inventory states: &quot;the height of the tower of Redcliffe contains 300 feet, of which 100 feet have been thrown down by lightning&quot;. The spire was not rebuilt following the strike; work instead continued to the nave and crossing, completed in c. 1480. The crossing vault bears similarities to that at Salisbury Cathedral, dated to 1479, which given the close relationship between the two churches, likely inspired that at Redcliffe. The work to complete the nave at Redcliffe was largely financed by the Canynges family, who had worked to rebuild the church since the early 14th century.

The final major alteration to the church in the Gothic period was the extension of the Lady Chapel in 1494 by Sir John Juyn, a wealthy barrister. Though the extension took place over 100 years after the initial completion of the chapel, the extension work is harmonious in design with the original.

=== 16th and 17th centuries ===
Like many churches in England, substantial damage was done to the internal fittings in the 16th and 17th centuries. During 1547, the chantry chapels were dissolved, including those founded at the end of the 15th century by William Canynges. The crown confiscated plates, lamps, vestments and service books. The rood screen was destroyed in 1548.

Sometime in 1574, Queen Elizabeth I made the first of several visits to St Mary Redcliffe, reputedly describing it as &quot;the fairest, goodliest and most famous parish church in England&quot;, though whether she actually said this is a matter of some debate. Elizabeth would make several more visits during her reign, most notably in 1588 and 1591 when she restored some of the funds confiscated by her predecessors; this she did by issuing Letters Patent.

More serious damage would come to the church during the 17th century. From 1649 to 1660, during the time of Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector, the pinnacles were removed, ornaments destroyed, the organ broken and much of the stained glass smashed by artillery fire. Similar damage was done to many churches across the country. The removal of the pinnacles destabilised parts of the building; as the flying buttresses are not just decorative, but support the vaulting and the upper walls. The east window was bricked up to try to stop the collapse of the quire walls, as were some of the flying buttresses.

=== Modern history ===

==== 18th and 19th centuries ====
In 1763, the chapel of the Holy Spirit, as well as the Churchyard Cross, were both demolished. The chapel of the Holy Spirit was a freestanding building constructed in the mid-13th century by Henry Tussun, who was Prebendary at nearby Bedminster. The chapel stood a short distance southwest of the present tower, and was used as the parish church whilst the present building was under construction. Queen Elizabeth later gave it to the parishioners for use as a grammar school but it fell into disuse. Demolition lasted until 1766.

The church was heavily restored again during the latter half of the 19th century. Concerned for the state of the building, which had suffered with decades of decay and misuse, a committee was formed in 1842 under the name of the Canynges Society to restore the building and return it to its original appearance. As part of the restoration, the east window was unblocked and reglazed, the high box pews and galleries of the Georgian era removed and the stonework generally restored. The final step in this restoration was the rebuilding of the spire, which had stood in truncated form above the tower since it was struck by lightning in 1445 or 1446. The spire was rebuilt and the remaining &#x27;stump&#x27; restored back to its former height; the Mayor of Bristol completing the work by placing the capstone on 9 May 1872, over 260 feet (79 m) above the ground. This work which cost over £40,000 (equivalent to £3.4 million in 2022) was designed and overseen by architect George Godwin.

==== 20th century ====
In 1912, the present highly acclaimed organ by Durham-based Harrison and Harrison was constructed and installed in the church, replacing several earlier instruments by Bristolian organ builders (see Organ, below). From 1939 to 1941, a new undercroft in the Gothic-style was constructed by George Oatley underneath the north porch, originally intended to be used as the treasury. 

During the Second World War, the church, despite its size and height making it an easy target for the Luftwaffe, was mostly spared from destruction, unlike many of Bristol&#x27;s churches. Nevertheless, a team of watchmen were stationed on the church roof at night to put out incendiary bombs. The church&#x27;s bells and other treasures were stored under the floor in sandbags to protect them from 1941 to 1944 and minor damage was sustained on a small number of occasions, mostly to the organs and roofs, though the upper (inner) north porch room was burnt out.

The church did however come very close to more significant destruction on Good Friday in 1941, when a bomb dropped on a nearby street threw shrapnel, including a large chunk of tram rail, into the churchyard. The tram rail, which has been left there to this day, is partially embedded in the ground with the force of the explosion and serves to remind local residents of how close the church came to destruction.

In the 1960s, the present vivid stained glass windows in the Lady Chapel were installed and designed by Harry Stammers, and at the same time, £150,000 was spent between 1960 and 1965 on cleaning the external stonework.

==== 21st century ====
The 21st century has seen much restoration to the exterior stonework, much of it being cleaned, 150 years of pollution having darkened the stonework. The organ has undergone a significant restoration by its original builders, Harrison and Harrison, and some stained glass commemorating the Royal African Company was removed in June 2020 following the removal of the Statue of Edward Colston on 7 June. The south nave aisle and lady chapel roofs have been renewed.

A project to celebrate the 450th anniversary of the visit of Elizabeth I in 2024 is underway to make the church more suitable for hosting tourists, events and for supporting the community. In 2016, an architectural competition was run by the church to design a new welcome centre with fresh and modern facilities; the contest was won by Purcell, who received the contract to design the work. Part of the work includes the pedestrianisation of Redcliffe Way, the dual carriageway which runs past the north side of the church. As of 2023, Purcell have departed ways with the church, with Northern Irish architects Hall McKnight taking over the project. No construction work has so far taken place.

== Architecture ==
=== Plan ===
The church has a traditional cruciform plan, with northwest tower, nave, transepts and chancel, as is common with many parish churches in England. However, more unusually, the form it takes is more akin to that of a cathedral than a parish church, with aisles on all four arms of the church, as well as a lady chapel to the east and two porches. Other parish churches with such an arrangement can be found at Beverley Minster in East Riding of Yorkshire, Christchurch Priory in Dorset and Selby Abbey in North Yorkshire. However, St Mary Redcliffe is unique for its double north porch, with both an inner and outer room, the latter taking a rare polygonal form.

The scale of the building makes it not only one of the primary landmarks for the city of Bristol but also one of the largest parish churches in the country. The church building is 250 feet (76 m) long from east to west and 117 feet (36 m) across the transepts from north to south, giving it an area of 1,916 square metres (20,620 sq ft). The footprint of the church is amongst the largest of any church in England when cathedrals and other former monastic structures such as Bath Abbey are excluded, after only Great Yarmouth Minster (2,752 sq m), Hull Minster (2,473 sq m), Boston Stump (2,417 sq m) and Newark-on-Trent (2,010 sq m).

=== Exterior ===

==== Tower ====
The dominant feature of the church&#x27;s exterior is the highly decorative and imposing northwest tower, capped by an extremely tall and slender spire. The earliest parts of the tower which comprise the lowest stage date from circa 1294, built in the Late Geometrical style. This part of the tower was an addition to the incarnation of the building begun in c. 1185, and was constructed on a massive scale, with walls 7 feet (2.1 m) thick and 35 feet (11 m) long. The lower stage, which reaches a height of 34 feet (10 m), contains a seven-bay niche-filled arcade containing fourteen statues by William Rice in the 19th century restoration. Below this arcade are two large windows, one each on the north and west sides, formed of three and four lights respectively, framed by massive buttresses complete with filleted angle shafts. This lowest stage of the tower partially juts into the north porch, with the 1325 hexagonal outer porch built around one of the tower buttresses.

The second stage of the tower is highly ornate and is almost as tall as the older stage below it, being some 33 feet (10 m) high from the bottom of the lower stage to the top of the second. This second stage was not begun until the early 14th century and subsequently shows a later period of architecture than the stage beneath it. This stage of the tower, containing the ringing room, has a large blind arcade that runs all the way around the tower, formed of 3 arches with y-shaped tracery in gabled hoods containing 19th century statues of the Apostles. Each arch has elaborate mouldings punctured with cabbage roses and daisy-like florets on the gables. The central arch on the east, north and west sides contain large glazed window, that of the south side blocked by the nave.

The third and highest stage of the tower contains the belfry and is similar in age to the second, being constructed in the Perpendicular Gothic style. This stage, being some 44 feet (13 m) high contains triplets of huge louvred belfry openings which take up nearly the entire width and height of each wall, showing the verticality common in the late Gothic period. These louvred windows have cinque-foil headed lights separated by slender blind arches, all heavily crocketed. The buttresses which started on the lowest stage also terminate here with crocketed pyramids. The third stage is topped by a pierced stone parapet formed of open triangles and gargoyles, with octagonal pinnacles rising from it. The parapet of the tower is 111 feet (34 m) above the ground; the octagonal corner pinnacles reach 139 feet (42 m) above the ground.

==== Spire ====

The first spire on the tower at Redcliffe was completed by circa 1335, and stood for just over 110 years until it was severely damaged by a storm in either 1445 or 1446, toppling the upper part of it. To what extent the spire was damaged is unknown, for conflicting accounts appear from its destruction as to how much of it was left. William Worcestre recorded in a visit to the church in 1478 that &quot;the height of the tower at Redcliffe measures 300 feet, of which 100 feet have been thrown down by lightning&quot;. However, this contradicts the images and paintings of the church in the 19th century, which show the tower capped by a short stump, implying it was either taken down or further reduced in height. The tallest medieval work in the present spire is 139 feet (42 m) above the ground, the position of which matches the appearance of the church in the 19th century.

As part of the 19th century restoration of the church by George Godwin, the rebuilding of the spire was undertaken as the final part of the work, from 1870 to 1872. Godwin&#x27;s design was more restrained than previous architects&#x27; drawings for its rebuilding, taking its inspiration from that at Salisbury Cathedral; perhaps ironic, as the original spire may have directly inspired Salisbury&#x27;s, given the close link between the two churches. The spire stands 152 feet (46 m) tall on top of the roof of the tower, giving a total height to the capstone of 262 feet (80 m), and when the weathervane is included, 274 feet (84 m). The spire&#x27;s height is commonly misquoted as 292 feet (89 m), which comes from an appendix attached to the book &quot;&#x27;Notes on the Church of St Mary Redcliffe&quot;&#x27; by Revd J. P. Norris in 1878. This figure includes the deep foundations as well as the weathervane which has led to St Mary Redcliffe frequently being called the third tallest parish church in England.

Whilst the spire is very large, the church is not the third tallest parish church in England. It ranks as the 15th-tallest church in the United Kingdom, and the 6th-tallest parish church, surpassed in the respect of the latter by the churches of St Walburge in Preston, St James in Louth, St Wulfram in Grantham, St Elphin in Warrington and St Mary Abbots in Kensington. It is also the second tallest church in South West England, surpassed only by Salisbury Cathedral.

==== North porch ====
The north porch at St Mary Redcliffe is formed of two parts, an earlier 12th century inner porch and a much more elaborate 14th century outer porch. The outer porch is the only one visible from the exterior and dates from circa 1325. The outer porch is the most celebrated part of the current building as well as one of its greatest treasures, being one of only three medieval hexagonal porches in existence in England. The exterior is dominated by massive pentagonal turret buttresses with square pinnacles rising the full height of the porch.

The outer porch has three stages of unequal height: the lowest stage contains the main doorway which has a seven-pointed double-chamfered entrance arch, a feature author Simon Jenkins calls &quot;astonishing&quot;. The arch is inspired by Oriental architecture and features exceptionally intricate decoration of seaweed foliage. The second stage has a large row of four blind arcades filled with niches containing 19th century replicas of the original statues, above which are large four-light windows. The upper stage contains the Chatterton Room, and is a low room lit by rows of mullion windows. The parapet has open quatrefoils and is reached by an octagonal stair turret in the southeast corner. 

==== Nave, transepts and chancel ====
The main body of the church generally dates from the late Decorated and early Perpendicular Gothic periods of the mid-14th century and thus presents a unified and consistent style throughout. The aisles all have blind quatrefoil parapets divided by buttresses, from which rise crocketed pinnacles and 4-light Decorated windows. The clerestory of the main body is supported by massive flying buttresses which spring from the aisle buttresses. Between each buttress are very large 6-light windows filling almost the entire space of the clerestory wall, of the alternating tracery type. The upper walls also have an open parapet but formed of open-cusped triangles, above which rise thin, crocketed pinnacles.

The south and north transepts are unusually double-aisled, an arrangement scarcely seen outside of cathedral buildings and each one is three bays in length. The two transepts differ slightly in design due to the north transept being a slightly later imitation of the 1335 south transept. The south transept has gabled buttresses to the aisles and flying buttresses to the clerestory, which unlike that of the nave or chancel, is unpanelled. The clerestory windows are smaller than their counterparts in the main body and have a different design to the rest of the church, featuring a central arch of three lights surrounded by a band of glazed quatrefoils. The north transept more closely resembles the nave and chancel, with the same design of clerestory window.

The chancel continues the same design as the nave but the north aisle is partially blocked by the two bay organ chamber, which has mullioned windows with trefoiled heads and a wide chimney breast. East of the chancel is the two bay lady chapel, built in two sections, firstly at the end of the 14th century from circa 1385 and then extended at the end of the 15th century in 1494. The chapel has a large five-light window in its westernmost bay, corresponding with the earlier period of building, and a smaller four-light window in the eastern bay. The eastern gable of the chapel has a wide but low six-light Perpendicular window.

All four arms of the church have large or very large windows in their gable ends. The west window is a tall five-light construction, divided into two tiers by transoms, featuring cinquefoil-headed crosses. The north and south transept gable ends have &quot;immensely tall&quot; four-light windows divided into three tiers by two rows of transoms featuring Y-tracery and reticulated tracery in the arch heads. The chancel gable is filled almost entirely by a substantial seven-light window of the alternate tracery design. 

=== Interior ===

==== Vaults ====
One of the rare qualities of St Mary Redcliffe is that it is vaulted entirely in stone, which makes it unique; there is no other parish church in England to feature a medieval stone vault throughout. The earliest vault in the church is that of the inner north porch dating back to circa 1185, taking the form of a simple ribbed vault, similar to that at Durham Cathedral, in the Transitional/Early English style. The outer porch, built from circa 1325, has a much more elaborate hexagonal vault in the form of a six-sided star.

The main body of the church is vaulted nearly entirely in the lierne form, with varying rib designs, including lozenges in the nave, hexagons in the south aisle, squares in the transepts and rectangles in the choir. These are formed by various combinations of ribs intersecting one another, in a pattern that Simon Jenkins calls &quot;an astonishing maze&quot;. The nave vaulting contains over a thousand carved and gilded bosses, either 1,100 or 1,200 in number depending on the source. These bosses depict various scenes and objects, including saints, biblical scenes and people associated with the building of the church.

There are two other notable vaults in the church, including the star vault of the Lady Chapel dating from the late 14th century and the five-sided star vault underneath the tower, which an archaeological survey has dated to the late 1460s or early 1470s. Most of the vaults were repainted in the 1980s and 1990s and have bright shades of green, gold, blue and red. 

==== Stained glass ====
The church lost the majority of its medieval stained glass during the damage done by Parliamentary forces in the 17th century, with fragments confined to the north transept, St John&#x27;s chapel and lower tower windows. In 1842, the committee responsible for the restoration of the church were mostly concerned with the condition of the stonework which was estimated to cost some £40,000 to repair, but were determined to have the large east window, which at the time was bricked up, filled with glass. In 1847, the committee awarded the contract for its design and implementation to William Wailes of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, one of the most prolific stained glass designers of the 19th century, who estimated the cost at £330. This window was replaced in 1904 by a design by Clayton &amp; Bell; Wailes&#x27; window being destroyed. Clayton and Bell provided much of the stained glass for the church following the 1842 decision to restore it, along with works by Ninian Comper and Joseph Bell of Bristol.

A notable medieval window to survive is in the lowest stage of the tower, featuring eight large figures, including depictions of Archbishop Thomas Becket and the saints Lawrence, Michael, Matthias, John the Baptist and Elizabeth. This window was reset and restored by Joseph Bell in the restoration. In the Second World War, incendiary bombs irrevocably damaged the windows of the Lady Chapel, which were replaced by 5 vivid windows designed by Harry Stammers from 1960 to 1965. In 2020, following the toppling of the statue of Edward Colston, the church took the decision to remove the lower four panels in the main window of the north transept which paid tribute to him, temporarily replacing them with clear glass. A competition to design new panels to replace these removed windows was launched in May 2022. The winner was announced in September 2022 as being Ealish Swift, a junior doctor in one of the city&#x27;s hospitals, who designed panels depicting the Middle Passage, Bristol bus boycott, and Refugee Crisis.

As of 2023, the church has a mixture of stained glass and clear glass, with mostly Victorian work in the east end, and clear glass in the clerestory windows of the nave. 

==== Fittings, memorials and monuments ====
The church building has numerous monuments and memorials due to its long association with the city of Bristol, its port and Queen Elizabeth I. Notable fittings include the fine ironwork screen designed by William Edney in 1710 intended to divide the chancel and nave, but moved in the restoration to sit under the tower; and the Victorian reredos below the east window. Other fittings of note include the 19th century pews; the 15th century St John&#x27;s font, the only relic of St John&#x27;s Church in Bedminster to survive the Blitz and the 15th century choir stalls.

The church also has many memorials, most notably to William Canynges who is buried in a brightly coloured tomb in the south transept, but also to Queen Elizabeth I. Monuments include a model of one of the ships that would sail from the Port of Bristol, and a wall memorial in the memory of the father of William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, Admiral Sir William Penn. His helm and half-armour are hung on the wall, together with the tattered banners of the Dutch ships that he captured in battle. The church also displays a rib of a whale brought back from one of his voyages by John Cabot. There is also a carved medieval cope chest, a wineglass-shaped pulpit and multiple misericords. 

== Music ==

=== Organ ===

The earliest record of an organ at St Mary Redcliffe is when a new instrument by John Harris and John Byfield was installed in the church in 1726. This organ was one of the largest of its time, featuring three manuals and 26 stops, located on a new western gallery in the nave. This organ was rebuilt by John Smith of Bristol in 1829 and then completely altered by W. G. Vowles, also of Bristol, in 1867, when it was enlarged, rebuilt and reinstalled in the chancel. The 1867 organ kept the three manuals, but had an increased number of stops, 33 in number. 

From 1910 to 1912, organ builders Harrison &amp; Harrison of Durham built and installed a brand new organ for the church, incorporating a small amount of the old pipework. The new organ was much larger, and due to space constraints had to be split between the north and south walls of the chancel. A new stone chamber for the Swell Organ was built in the angle between the north transept and north chancel aisle. The Great Organ was placed on the north side of the chancel with the remaining parts on the south; the console being placed to the west, near the north transept. This organ had more than twice as many stops as the previous organs, a total of 68 as installed.

In 1941, the Swell Organ was affected by fire and bomb damage and had to be rebuilt in 1947 by Harrison &amp; Harrison with additional pipes. The organ was cleaned and overhauled in 1974 and 1990 with tonal alterations, new equipment and additional stops; two stops were also removed. The 1990 work was never completely satisfactory, and so when the organ approached its next restoration in the early 2000s, a part of the project involved correcting errors from the 1990 overhaul.

The project to restore the organ in time for its 100th birthday was launched in 2007, with a fundraising goal of some £800,000. Half of the money was donated by the Canynges Society and the remaining half raised by the congregation, incorporating an anonymous £100,000 cheque left in the church for the restoration of the organ. The organ was dismantled in 2009 and returned in 2010, with four new blowers and new layout for the swell, new actions for the various keyboards, and cleaned and tuned. The organ as it stands today has 71 stops and 4,327 pipes, making it amongst the largest organs in Southern England. The organ is very well thought of for the quality of its tone, ranking amongst the finest organs in the country.

In 2024 there were plans for churches in Britain, including St Mary Redcliffe, to hold concerts with doom metal bands and organ, a genre dubbed &quot;organic metal&quot;, following a successful event. The St Mary Redcliffe director of music said &quot;Our organ is world-famous – Handel played it. ... There&#x27;s a lot of history, so by doing something like a rock concert with an organ follows on in that kind of tradition.&quot;

=== Bells ===

==== Early bells ====
The earliest record of bells at Redcliffe is in 1480, where a very large peal of six are recorded. The founders were not known, as only the number of bells was recorded by William Worcestre. It is known from the churchwarden&#x27;s accounts, that the 4th bell was recast by William Jeffers in 1572, and the 5th and 6th by Roger Purdue in 1622. The Purdue family were one of the most prolific medieval bellfounders in England and were based in Somerset and Bristol; 531 of their bells still survive today. Purdue&#x27;s tenor was recorded as weighing 42 long hundredweight (cwt) 0 qrs 27 lbs (2,150 kg or 4,731 lb). In 1626, the bells were rehung in a massive oak frame which was inscribed with &quot;T. Roome, Anno Domini 1626&quot;, who was presumably the frame&#x27;s maker.

In 1698, Abel Rudhall of Gloucester augmented the ring of six to eight with two new treble bells. No further work is recorded until 1763, when Thomas Bilbie recast the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th of the eight.  The Bilbie family, like the Purdue family, were a prolific West Country foundry; 734 of their bells survive today. Curiously, Bilbie had to guarantee the recast bells were at least as heavy as the bells they replaced; if they were not, he had to pay 1 shilling per pound of reduced metal. The first peal in the tower was a few years later, being 5,040 changes of Grandsire Triples on 29 May 1768.

==== 19th century augmentation ====
In 1823, the bells were augmented to ten with two trebles cast by Thomas Mears II of Whitechapel, though the first peal on the ten would not follow until 1835. The bells were augmented to twelve in 1872 by Mears&#x27; successors, Mears &amp; Stainbank. The augmented bells were the third ring of twelve in the West Country, following Cirencester in 1722 and Painswick in 1821, and the 25th ring of twelve in the country. 
By the late 1880s, the ease at which the bells could be rung was deteriorating, and so John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough were asked to inspect the bells. They reported that the fittings of the 10th and tenor bells were in a bad state, and should be renewed or replaced. They also reported that these 2 bells should be turned so that the clappers would not strike the same point of the bell, to avoid the risk of cracking. They inspected the frame, reporting that the frame timbers were sound, but not massive enough to support such a heavy ring of bells, and thus recommended bolting some cast iron brackets to the corners to make it more rigid. The frame housing the three smallest bells they described as badly designed and too weak; these bells were hung above the other nine. They also recommended the fitting of iron girders across the tower walls from east to west. The cost of all this work was £149, though the fitting of the iron girders is not recorded.

The first peal on the ring twelve was on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1899, being 5,007 changes of Stedman Cinques in rung 3h 28m, with two men on the tenor. There was a fierce debate in the Bell News magazine for several months afterwards, with some claiming the peal cannot have been rung successfully because the speed of the peal was &quot;impossibly fast&quot; given the weight of the tenor, which was often recorded at anywhere between 48 and 52 long cwt (5,376 kg – 5,824 kg) in ringing magazines.

==== 20th century restoration ====
In 1902, Taylor&#x27;s were asked to come again, and this time they found things considerably worse than on their previous visit fourteen years earlier. Some of the frame was no longer sound, with rotten or decaying timbers, and various wedges had been installed in the frame corners to try and give it rigidity. These wedges transferred the forces into the walls of the tower, and whilst it was not currently damaging it, it had the potential to do so. Taylor&#x27;s advised that the bells should be rehung in a new metal frame, with all twelve bells on one level (unlike the existing frame), and the clock weights being reorganised to pass through one corner of the bell chamber instead of being suspended from the centre of the ringing chamber. They also recommended new fittings throughout. The estimate that the church received from Taylor&#x27;s for new fittings and a new frame would cost £709. The architect was consulted and following talks with Taylor&#x27;s, it was agreed to recast the lightest seven bells and the tenor, retuning the other four.

The bells, the frame and the fittings left Bristol for Loughborough in the early months of 1903. The bells were all weighed upon their arrival, where the tenor was found to be only 39 long cwt (4,368 kg), over half a tonne lighter than reputed, which then explained how the peal in 1899 was faster than many thought possible. The lightest seven and the tenor bell were broken up and recast with additional metal, and the 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th bells had their canons (ornamental loops of bell metal previously used for attaching bells to their headstocks) removed. The bells were also retuned, the combined action of both removing the canons and retuning reducing the weight of each of these four bells by approximately 2 long cwt (225 kg).

The 9th bell, however, for a reason that is unknown was recast later in the same year; according to legend this is because the railway company dropped the 9th on the return to Bristol, and it had to be recast. The logbook housed in the archives at John Taylor &amp; Co&#x27;s Loughborough foundry shows the arrival weight and post-tuning weights of the former 9th crossed through and a new, heavier weight recorded underneath. The bells were provided with all new fittings throughout, including Taylor&#x27;s standard cast iron headstocks, Hasting stays, timber wheels, wrought iron clappers and plain bearings. They were hung in a massive new cast iron frame for 12 bells which had been installed in the closing months of 1903, with room left for an additional 13th bell later if required.

When the bells were installed, the new heavier tenor, which weighed 50 long cwt 2 qrs 21 lbs (5,677 lb or 2,575 kg), made the bells the fourth heaviest in the world hung for change ringing, after Exeter Cathedral, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and Wells Cathedral; but the second heaviest ring of twelve, as Exeter and Wells were both rings of ten. Exeter would later be augmented to 12 in 1922, also by Taylor&#x27;s. The first peal on the new bells was on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1904, being 5,085 changes of Stedman Cinques in 4 hours exactly. The bells would later be relegated to the 5th heaviest ring of bells and the 4th heaviest twelve by the casting of the bells of York Minster in 1925, also by Taylor&#x27;s, and then relegated again by the ring of twelve at Liverpool Anglican Cathedral, cast by Mears &amp; Stainbank in 1939; they have remained the sixth heaviest ring of bells in the world since.

With the introduction of ball bearings to church bells in 1920, Taylor&#x27;s rehung the bells on ball bearings in 1933. These new ball bearings no longer required regular greasing, unlike the old plain type of bearings and were also self-aligning.

====Since WWII====

In the spring of 1941, following damage by Second World War bombing to many towers in London, including the destruction of the ring of twelve at St Mary-le-Bow, the church removed the bells from the tower and kept them in the undercroft underneath sandbags. The bells were returned to the tower and rehung in November 1944, also by Taylor&#x27;s.

In 1951, the 13th bell that Taylor&#x27;s had left the space for in 1903 was ordered, being cast at Loughborough as with the other bells. This bell, called a flat sixth, occupied the position in the frame between the sixth and seventh bells and was used to provide a lighter ring of eight, when bells two to nine are rung with the flat sixth replacing the normal sixth. The ninth weighs 19 long cwt 3 qrs 1 lb (2,213 lb or 1,004 kg), less than half that of the tenor bell, which makes teaching new ringers easier. To fit this extra bell in, Taylor&#x27;s provided an additional section of frame. The new bell was provided with all new fittings, identical to those of the other bells.

In 1967, St John&#x27;s Church in Bedminster, which had been in ruins since sustaining heavy damage in the Bristol Blitz, was demolished. The font was brought to Redcliffe (see fittings, above), and the only surviving bell was donated to Redcliffe to increase its number of bells to fourteen. This bell, which weighed 8 and a half long cwt (950 lb or 430 kg) was cast by Bristol founder Llewellins and James in 1907. The bell was recast in 1969 by Taylor&#x27;s to make it better suit the bells at Redcliffe. This fourteenth bell, called an &#x27;extra treble&#x27; was provided with fittings to complement the Redcliffe bells and was hung in a new cast iron frame above the existing thirteen bells; its purpose was to augment the light eight to a light ring of ten, utilising the extra treble, the treble bell and bells two to nine with the flat sixth.

Following the bells hundredth birthday in 2003, the bells have received attention several times on both a minor and major basis. In 2009, the 9th bell was rehung on a new and larger wheel to make it easier to ring; the wheel it had been provided with in 1903 appeared to suit better the weight of the old ninth rather than the one that was recast. The frame containing the extra treble was moved slightly to improve the place the rope falls in the circle, and it too was given a new wheel. In 2012, the 8th bell, which had been cast in 1763 by Thomas Bilbie, was retired, being both underweight and poor in tone to the more modern Taylor bells around it. John Taylor &amp; Co were selected to cast a new bell to replace it, and had to scan the surrounding bells with a laser to get an accurate shape, as the 1903 shape Taylor&#x27;s had used at the time of their recasting was no longer in use.

The new bell was cast to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II and following its tuning, it weighed some 15 and a half cwt (790 kg), over 250 kg heavier than its predecessor, and was hung in the spring of 2013. At the same time, the wheels of the sixth, seventh and eighth were rejigged: the sixth received the wheel that had been on the seventh, the seventh received that of the old eighth and the new eighth received the wheel on the ninth until 2009. The old eighth bell was hung on steel girders above the ringing peal, for chiming. The last major piece of work to the bells in recent times was in 2017, when the fittings were dismantled and, together with the frame, were repainted in Taylor&#x27;s standard red livery. The bells remain the sixth heaviest ring of bells (but fifth heaviest ring of twelve) in the world. They are also the heaviest ring of bells in a parish church.

The bells are considered one of the finest rings of bells in existence, with visiting bands of ringers coming from across the British Isles and beyond to ring them. There have been more than 300 full peals rung on the bells since the first in 1768; the St Mary Redcliffe Guild of Ringers attempts several full peals on the bells a year, normally to mark national events, most recently, the State Funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022.

== Location and precincts ==
Since the construction of Redcliffe Way in the 1960s, the church has sat next to a busy dual carriageway on its north side, whose construction resulted in the demolition of many of the historic buildings that originally faced the church, as well as a gradual blackening of the stone from pollution. The church has, however, kept its historic south churchyard, which has been described as a &quot;cathedral close in miniature&quot;, with a small group of listed buildings sat around a south-facing lawn. These buildings are a row of terraced houses on Colston Parade, approximately half of those built in the Stucco style from 1760 to 1762, augmented with four Victorian terraces; all are Grade II listed.

The south churchyard contains the Redcliffe War Memorial, formed of a large, tapering stone shaft surmounted by a cross, designed by George Oatley in 1921. The memorial was originally designed and constructed to commemorate the fallen of Redcliffe in the First World War, but it was altered following further loss of life in the Second World War. The memorial is Grade II listed. There are two other parts of the churchyard to achieve listed status, these are the walls on Colston Parade which date to the 18th century, and the balustrade surrounding the west front; both are Grade II listed. 

The churchyard also contains the Redcliffe Pipe; a conduit originally given by Robert de Berkeley in 1190 to supply fresh water to the church. Berkeley was Lord of Bedminster Manor and he granted the construction of a long pipe from Knowle Hill to St Mary Redcliffe. A yearly walk along the route of the pipe continues to this day. Damaged in the Bristol Blitz, the present pipe terminates near the balustrade in front of the west front, featuring a brass drinking fountain from 1823, though the water from the pipe does not actually enter the fountain.

<text>A spire is a tall, slender, pointed structure on top of a roof of a building or tower, especially at the summit of church steeples. A spire may have a square, circular, or polygonal plan, with a roughly conical or pyramidal shape. Spires are typically made of stonework or brickwork, or else of timber structures with metal cladding, ceramic tiling, roof shingles, or slates on the exterior.

Since towers supporting spires are usually square, square-plan spires emerge directly from the tower&#x27;s walls, but octagonal spires are either built above a pyramidal transition section called a &quot;broach&quot; at the spire&#x27;s base, or else free spaces around the tower&#x27;s summit for decorative elements like pinnacles. The former solution is known as a &quot;broach spire&quot;. Small or short spires are known as &quot;spikes&quot;, &quot;spirelets&quot;, or &quot;flèches&quot;.

==Etymology==
This sense of the word spire is attested in English since the 1590s, &quot;spir&quot; having been used in Middle Low German since the 14th century, a form related to the Old English word &quot;spir&quot;, meaning a sprout, shoot, or stalk of grass.

==Gothic spires==

The Gothic church spire originated in the 12th century as a simple, four-sided pyramidal structure on top of a church tower. The spire could be constructed of masonry, as at Salisbury Cathedral, or of wood covered with lead, as at Notre-Dame de Paris. Gradually, spires became taller, slimmer, and more complex in form. Triangular sections of masonry, called &quot;broaches&quot; were added to the sides, at an angle to the faces of the tower, as at St Columba, Cologne. In the 12th and 13th centuries, more ornament was added to the faces of the spires, particularly gabled dormers over the centres of the faces of the towers, as in the southwest tower of Chartres Cathedral. Additional vertical ornament, in the form of slender pinnacles in pyramid shapes, were often placed around the spires, to express the transition between the square base and the octagonal spire.

The spires of the late 13th century achieved great height; one example was Fribourg Cathedral in Switzerland, where the gabled lantern and spire reached a height of . In England, a tall needle spire was sometimes constructed at the edge of tower, with pinnacles at the other corners. The western spires of Lichfield Cathedral are an example.

Spires were particularly fragile in the wind, and a number of English Gothic spires collapsed; notably that of Malmesbury Abbey (1180–1500); Lincoln Cathedral (which had been the tallest in the world) 1349–1549; and Chichester Cathedral (1402–1861). The spire of Salisbury Cathedral, completed in 1320 and tall, without the tower, required the addition of buttresses, arches and tie irons to keep it intact. Finally, in 1668 the architect Christopher Wren designed reinforcing beams which halted the deformation of the structure.

Openwork spires were a notable architectural innovation, beginning with the spire at Freiburg Minster, in which the pierced stonework was held together by iron cramps. The openwork spire, represented a radical but logical extension of the Gothic tendency toward a skeletal structure.

==Crown spires==
Crown spires have a fully exposed structure of arches not unlike the arches of a medieval European crown. The spire itself is supported by buttress structures.

==Needle-spires and Hertfordshire spikes==

A needle-spire is a particularly tall and narrow spire emerging from a tower surrounded by a parapet. In general, the term applies to considerably larger and more refined spires than the name Hertfordshire spike.

A Hertfordshire spike is a type of short spire, needle-spire, or flèche ringed with a parapet and found on church-towers in the British Isles.

==Splay-foot==
The roofs of splay-foot spires open out and flatten off at their base, creating eaves above the tower supporting the spire.

==Flèches==
A flèche () is a name given to spires in Gothic architecture: in French the word is applied to any spire, but in English it has the technical meaning of a &quot;spirelet&quot; or &quot;spike&quot; on the rooftop of a building. In particular, the spirelets often built atop the crossings of major churches in mediaeval French Gothic architecture are called flèches.

On the ridge of the roof on top of the crossing (the intersection of the nave and the transepts) of a church, flèches were typically light, delicate, timber-framed constructions with a metallic sheath of lead or copper. They are often richly decorated with architectural and sculptural embellishments: tracery, crockets, and miniature buttresses serve to adorn the flèche.

The most famous flèche was the Neo-Gothic 19th-century design by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc for the Notre-Dame de Paris, tall and richly decorated with sculpture. The original flèche of Notre-Dame was built in the 13th century, and removed in 1786, shortly before the French Revolution. The famous replacement by Viollet-le-Duc with an abundance of sculpture was destroyed in the 2019 Notre-Dame de Paris fire. It will be rebuilt in the same form.

==Pinnacles==
A pinnacle is a miniature spire that was used both as a decorative and functional element. In early Gothic, as at Notre-Dame de Paris, stone pinnacles were placed atop flying buttresses, to give them additional weight and stability, and to counterbalance the outward thrust from the rib vaults of the nave. As an ornament, they were used to break up the horizontal lines, such as parapets and the roofs of towers. In later Gothic, they were sometimes often clustered together into forests of vertical ornament.

==Traditional types of spires==

* Conical stone spires: These are usually found on circular towers and turrets, usually of small diameter.
* Masonry spires: These are found on medieval and revival churches and cathedrals, generally with towers that are square in plan. While masonry spires on a tower of small plan may be pyramidal, spires on towers of large plan are generally octagonal. The spire is supported on stone squinches which span the corners of the tower, making an octagonal plan. The spire of Salisbury Cathedral is of this type and is the tallest masonry spire in the world, remaining substantially intact since the 13th century. Other spires of this sort include the south spire of Chartres Cathedral, and the spires of Norwich Cathedral, Chichester Cathedral and Oxford Cathedral.
* Openwork spires: These spires are constructed of a network of stone tracery, which, being considerably lighter than a masonry spire, can be built to greater heights. Many famous tall spires are of this type, including the spires of Ulm Minster (the world&#x27;s tallest church), Freiburg Minster, Strasbourg Cathedral, Vienna Cathedral, Prague Cathedral, Burgos Cathedral and the twin spires of Cologne Cathedral.
* Complex spires: These are stone spires that combine both masonry and openwork elements. Some such spires were constructed in the Gothic style, such as the north spire of Chartres Cathedral. They became increasingly common in Baroque architecture, and are a feature of Christopher Wren&#x27;s churches.
* Clad spires: These are constructed with a wooden frame, often standing on a tower of brick or stone construction, but also occurring on wooden towers in countries where wooden buildings are prevalent. They are often clad in metal, such as copper or lead. They may also be tiled or shingled.
:Clad spires can take a variety of shapes. These include:
::Pyramidal spires, which may be of low profile, rising to a height not much greater than its width, or, more rarely, of high profile.
::Rhenish helm: This is a four-sided tower topped with a pyramidal roof. each of the four sides of the roof is rhomboid in form, with the long diagonal running from the apex of roof to one of the corners of the supporting tower; each side of the tower is thus topped with a gable from whose peak a ridge runs to the apex of the roof.
::Broach spires: These are octagonal spires sitting on a square tower, with a section of spire rising from each corner of the tower, and bridging the spaces between the corners and four of the sides.
::Bell-shaped spires: These spires, sometimes square in plan, occur mostly in Northern, Alpine and Eastern Europe, where they occur alternately with onion-shaped domes.

==Notable spires==

* Lincoln Cathedral&#x27;s high medieval spire on the crossing tower was the tallest building in the world for 238 years (1311–1548) before its collapse. It was the first building to be taller than the Great Pyramid of Giza and nothing taller would be built until the Eiffel Tower was finished in 1889.
* Salisbury Cathedral&#x27;s high spire on the crossing tower has been the tallest church spire in the British Isles since the collapse of Lincoln&#x27;s crossing spire in 1548.
* St Mary&#x27;s Church, Stralsund&#x27;s high spire made it the tallest building in the world after the collapse of Lincoln&#x27;s crossing spire in 1548 until 1569, when Beauvais Cathedral&#x27;s tower exceeded it in height. Beauvais&#x27;s tower collapsed in 1573, after which St Mary&#x27;s remained the tallest building until 1647, when the spire was destroyed by lightning and subsequently replaced with a lower Baroque dome (excepting 1569–1573)
* Cologne Cathedral&#x27;s high spires were built 1248 and 1473, but not completed, and again from 1842, still following faithfully the original plan, until their completions in 1880. The architecture of the spires blends entirely with the tower, making them difficult to separate. The combined tower-spires are high. The church is the tallest cathedral anywhere and has the tallest pair of spires.
* St Martin&#x27;s Church, Landshut, spire whose Brick Gothic tower was finished in 1507, makes it the tallest brick-built church in the world, and the second tallest (unreinforced) brick building anywhere.
* The spire at Burghley House in England, built for Elizabeth I&#x27;s Lord Chancellor in 1585 is an example of a spire on a non-religious building.
* The 123 metre spire of Antwerp Cathedral is the tallest ecclesiastical structure in the Low Countries.
* The 119 metre pair of spires of Uppsala Cathedral are the tallest in Scandinavia.
* Ulm Minster, a Lutheran church in Germany, has the distinction of having the tallest church tower in Europe, at 161.5 metres or 530 feet. The height was deliberately sought to make it slightly higher than the Catholic Cologne Cathedral.
* The Spire of Notre-Dame de Paris designed by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc was a famous flèche that crowned the crossing ridge of Notre-Dame de Paris between 1859 and 2019.
* The organic skeleton of Antoni Gaudi&#x27;s spires at the Sagrada Família in Barcelona are a blend of Gothic and Gaudi&#x27;s particular style. Designed and begun by Gaudi in 1884, they are still being completed in the early 21st century.
==Religious symbolism==
In Gothic architecture, where the spire is most commonly used, and particularly in Gothic cathedrals and churches it symbolised the heavenly aspirations of churches&#x27; builders, as well as offering a visual spectacle of extreme height. It also suggested, by its similarity to a spear point, the power and strength of religion.

<text>Lower Normandy (, ; ) is a former administrative region of France. On 1 January 2016, Lower and Upper Normandy merged becoming one region called Normandy.

==Geography==
The region included three departments, Calvados, Manche and Orne, that cover the part of Normandy traditionally termed &quot;Lower Normandy&quot; lying west of the river Dives, the Pays d&#x27;Auge (except a small part remaining in Upper Normandy), a small part of the Pays d&#x27;Ouche (the main part remaining in Upper Normandy), the Norman Perche, and part of the &quot;French&quot; Perche. It covers 10,857 km2, 3.2 percent of the surface area of France.

The traditional districts of Lower Normandy include the Cotentin Peninsula and La Hague, the Campagne de Caen, the Norman Bocage, the Bessin, and the Avranchin.

==History==
:&quot;Regions relating to Lower Normandy: Gallia Lugdunensis, Neustria, and Normandy.&quot;

The traditional province of Normandy, with an integral history reaching back to the 10th century, was divided in 1956 into two regions: Lower Normandy and Upper Normandy.

During the Roman era, the region was divided into several different city-states. That of Vieux was excavated in the 17th century, revealing numerous structures and vestiges bearing testimony to the prosperity of the Caen region.

The region was conquered by the Franks in the 5th century.

In the 9th century, the Norman conquests devastated the region. Much of the territory of Lower Normandy was added to the Duchy of Normandy in the 10th century.

In 1066, Duke William Il of Normandy conquered England. He was buried in Caen. After his death, Normandy went to his eldest son and England went to his second son, separating the two possessions.

The victory of Tinchebray in 1106 gave Normandy to the kings of England again. Nearly one hundred years later, in 1204, King Philip II Augustus of France conquered the region, apart from the Channel Islands. Then, during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, it was regained by the Plantagenets. However, the French recovered the mainland part of the region between 1436 and 1450. By 1453, the French monarchy controlled much of modern France apart from Calais, which remained in English hands.

During the Second World War, the main thrust of Operation Overlord was focused on Lower Normandy. The beaches of Calvados were the site of the D-Day landings in June 1944. Lower Normandy suffered badly during the War, with many of its towns and villages being destroyed or badly damaged during the Battle of Normandy.

==Economy==

The region&#x27;s economy is heavily agricultural, with livestock and dairy farming, textiles and fruit production among its major industries. The region is the leader in France in the sectors of butter, fromage frais, soft cheeses, cider apples, cider, leeks, turnips, and flax. The region also breeds more horses than any other in France. The western part of the region is used mainly for farming, because of the prairies. Iron ore is mined near Caen. Tourism is also a major industry. The region has direct ferry links to England (via the port of Cherbourg and Caen Ouistreham).

==Culture==
In addition to French, Normandy has its own regional language, Norman. It is still in use today in Lower Normandy, with the dialects of the Cotentin more in evidence than others. Lower Normandy has also been the home of many well-known French authors, including Guy de Maupassant, Marcel Proust, Jules Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly. Notable Norman language authors connected especially with Lower Normandy include Alfred Rossel, Louis Beuve, and Côtis-Capel.

In terms of music, composer Erik Satie also hailed from this region. In the visual arts, Jean-François Millet was a native of La Hague. Eugène Boudin was born in Honfleur and Fernand Léger in Argentan. Important events include Deauville Asian Film Festival and Deauville American Film Festival.

<text>Upper Normandy (, ; ) is a former administrative region of France. On 1 January 2016, Upper and Lower Normandy merged becoming one region called Normandy.

== History ==
It was created in 1956 from two departments: Seine-Maritime and Eure, when Normandy was divided into Lower Normandy and Upper Normandy. This division continued to provoke controversy, and many people continued to call for the two regions to be reunited. The two regions were finally merged on 1 January 2016. The name &quot;Upper Normandy&quot; existed prior to 1956 and referred by tradition to territories currently included within the administrative region: the Pays de Caux, the Pays de Bray (not that of Picardy), the Roumois, the Campagne of Le Neubourg, the Plaine de Saint-André and the Norman Vexin. Today, most of the Pays d&#x27;Auge, as well as a small portion of the Pays d&#x27;Ouche, are located in Lower Normandy. Rouen and Le Havre are important urban centers.

==Major communities==

Rouen is the regional capital, historically important with many fine churches and buildings, including the tallest cathedral tower in France. The region&#x27;s largest city, in terms of municipal population, is Le Havre, although Rouen is by far the most populous urban area and metropolitan area. The region is twinned with the London Borough of Redbridge in England. Its economy is centered on agriculture, industry, petrochemicals and tourism.

<text>Pays de la Loire (; ) is one of the eighteen regions of France, located on the country&#x27;s Atlantic coast. It was created in the 1950s to serve as a zone of influence for its capital and most populated city, Nantes, one of a handful of French &quot;balancing metropolises&quot; (). In 2020, Pays de la Loire had a population of 3,832,120.

== Geography ==

Pays de la Loire is in western France, bordered by Brittany on the northwest, Normandy on the north, Centre-Val de Loire on the east, Nouvelle-Aquitaine on the south, and the Bay of Biscay of the North Atlantic Ocean on the southwest.

=== Departments and former province ===

Pays de la Loire comprises five departments: Loire-Atlantique, Maine-et-Loire, Mayenne, Sarthe, Vendée.

Pays de la Loire is made up of the following historical provinces:

* Part of Brittany, with its old capital Nantes contained within the Loire-Atlantique department. This is up to 20% of historical Brittany. The other 80% makes up the currently neighbouring region of Brittany
* Anjou: is largely absorbed into the Maine-et-Loire department; the rest in the immediately adjoining departments (the whole of the historical province Anjou is contained inside Pays de la Loire).
* Maine: is now divided between the Mayenne and Sarthe departments; the whole of the former province of Maine is contained inside Pays de la Loire.
* Part of Poitou: is contained within the Vendée department; most of the old province of Poitou is inside the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region to the south.
* Part of Perche: is within the northeast of Sarthe department; the rest of Perche is inside the Normandy and Centre-Val de Loire regions.
* Small part of Touraine: southeast of Maine-et-Loire department; the rest, most of the former province of Touraine is inside the Centre region.

Thus the name of the region, chosen by the French central government, was not based on history, but a postwar creation of purely geographical reference: (&quot;lands&quot;) (&quot;of the Loire&quot;).

The Loire Valley, which is a UNESCO listed World Heritage Site since 2000, is located both in the administrative regions of Pays de la Loire and Centre-Val de Loire. The majority of the châteaux of the Loire Valley such as Montsoreau, Angers, Saumur or Brézé in Pays de la Loire are located in the &quot;Maine-et-Loire&quot; department, &quot;Pays de la Loire&quot; has numerous prominent monuments, such as the castles of Laval, and the Nantes Château des Ducs de Bretagne, the Royal Fontevraud Abbey (the widest monastic ensemble in Europe), and the old city of Le Mans. It also has many natural parks such as the Brière and the Marsh of Poitou.

== Demography ==

Evolution of the population listed by departments:

A steep increase in the population was seen particularly as people migrated from all over France to the Loire region due to the rise of Nantes to prominence.

== Economy ==

The gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was €119.1 billion in 2018, accounting for 5.1% of French economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €28,200 or 94% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 102% of the EU average.

== Major communities ==

The biggest city in Pays de la Loire is Nantes, which is the sixth most populated city in France with over 319,000 people (city proper) and a metropolitan population of almost 1,000,000.

Angers is another metropolis of the region. It has a metropolitan population of about 400,000 and is the third biggest job provider in north-western France, just behind Nantes and Rennes. Saint-Nazaire is a major harbour town downstream from Nantes on the mouth of the Loire river.

Le Mans is another city in Pays de la Loire. Situated in north-east Pays de la Loire, Le Mans area is home to over 300,000 (metropolitan population).

<doc id="198753" wikidata="Q745508" url="?curid=198753" title="Jannes and Jambres">
<text>In Jewish and Christian traditions, Jannes and Jambres (Hebrew: יניס Yannis, ימבריס &quot;Yambres&quot;) are the names given to magicians mentioned in the Book of Exodus. This naming tradition is well-attested in ancient and medieval literature. In Latin manuscripts of the New Testament, and in Latin writing traditions, their names are known as Jamnes and Mambres.

== Hebrew Bible ==
Jannes and Jambres are not specifically mentioned in the Tanakh (&quot;Hebrew Bible&quot;), but the Egyptian &quot;wise men and sorcerers&quot; (two of whom were identified with Jannes and Jambres in Jewish and Christian traditions) are mentioned in Exodus 7:10-12 (KJV)

And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent. Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron&#x27;s rod swallowed up their rods.
==New Testament and Second Temple literature==

The names Jannes and Jambres (Greek: Ἰάννης, Ἰαμβρῆς; &quot;Iannēs, Iambrēs&quot;) appear in 2 Timothy in the New Testament. Origen says that there was an apocryphal book called &quot;The Book of Jannes and Jambres&quot;, containing details of their exploits, and that Paul the Apostle was quoting from it. This book, known as &quot;The Apocryphon of Jannes and Jambres  the magicians&quot;, exists in some Greek fragments present in the Chester Beatty Papyri No XVI (which has been edited and translated by Albert Pietersma), and in an extensive Ethiopic fragment which was discovered in 2014. It was also probably known to the Qumran community, since the Qumran community refers to one of the magicians by the name of Jannes. The Testament of Solomon also refers to the magicians by the name of Jannes and Jambres.

==Greco-Roman literature==
The name of Jannes not as that of a magical opponent of Moses but as the originator with Moses and one Lotapea (or Lotapes) of a sect of magicians occurs in Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History (XXX, II, 11)&quot;; Pliny&#x27;s citation is also referred to in Apuleius. Numenius of Apamea, a Neopythagorean philosopher, called them sacred Egyptian scribes. The Gospel of Nicodemus also refers to the magicians by the name of Jannes and Jambres. 

In a brief passage cited in Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Praeparatio evangelica&quot;, Numenius said that &quot;Jannes and Jambres were able to undo, publicly, even the greatest of the disasters that Moses brought against Egypt.&quot; This statement contradicts the biblical account according to which the magicians were able to follow Moses&#x27; acts only to the second plague inclusive ().

==Rabbinic literature==
The Babylonian Talmud names &quot;Johana and Mamre&quot; as two of Pharaoh&#x27;s sorcerers. &quot;Jannis and Jambres&quot; are mentioned several times by name in Targum Pseudo-Jonathan. Jewish traditions in the Targums preserve other legendary lore about the pair. They are called the sons of Balaam, the unwitting non-Jewish prophet of Peor. It was also claimed that they converted to Judaism, and that they left Egypt at the Exodus to accompany Moses and the Israelites; however, they perished on the way, either at the Red Sea, or the destruction of the Golden Calf, or at the slaughter of Korah and his followers.

Apart from their opposition to Moses there are other aggadic lore and legends about Egyptian sorcerers; it was said that during the end of their days they had necessary occult knowledge to embark on a journey to the Jewish world to come. They were not welcomed and the angels of the first few heavens fought them vigorously but they could not evict them due to the potent talismans that were worn by the wizards. As they entered the fourth heaven they were met by Michael and Gabriel; legends say that the battle was very evenly balanced, but in the end it was the angels who had to fall back. Upon entering the fifth heaven they were met by none other than Metatron, who did not come at them with defiance or anger, but appeared accommodating, considering the circumstances; after conversing for a short time the angel was successful in convincing Jannes and Jambres to remove their talismans, leaving them thus vulnerable. Metatron was quick to act and threw them out of heaven with a wave of his hand. It is said that they lost all memory of the event after that.

==League with the Devil==
The earliest mention of &quot;Jannes and his brother&quot; in the Damascus Document, states that the two were in league with &quot;Belial&quot;, who would later be personified as the devil in Christian texts. In the &quot;Testament of Solomon&quot;, a demon who has some connections with &quot;the Red Sea&quot; replies to the king: &quot;I am who was called upon by Jannes and Jambres who fought against Moses in Egypt&quot; (25:4). Similarly, in the later text of the &quot;Questions of St. Bartholomew&quot; (6th-7th century), Satan says that &quot;Simon Magus, Zaroës, Arfaxir, and Jannes and Mambres are my brothers&quot; (Lat. 2, 4:50). In the &quot;Penitence of Cyprian&quot; (5th century?), the great magician of Antioch relates how the Devil called him &quot;a clever lad, a new Jambres, trained for service, and worthy of fellowship with himself&quot; . In his &quot;Lausiac History&quot; (5th century), Palladius relates that Macarius of Alexandria (4th century) once visited the garden-tomb of Jannes and Jambres, and upon arrival was met by seventy demons who resided there.

==In popular culture==
* In the film &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), Douglass Dumbrille plays Jannes as a constantly fretful and pompous High Priest of Egypt and a devoted follower of the Nile God Khnum, as well as Court Mage and one of the Pharaoh&#x27;s top advisers. 
* &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;, a 1998 animated DreamWorks film, has Steve Martin and Martin Short provide the voices of Hotep and Huy, characters who were based on Jannes and Jambres. They are somewhat comical characters, despite the movie&#x27;s overall serious tone. 
* In the 2014 film &quot;&quot;, Indira Varma plays an Egyptian high priestess whose character is roughly parallel to the role of Jannes and Jambres.

<text>Kowloon () is an urban area in Hong Kong comprising the Kowloon Peninsula and New Kowloon. It has a population of 2,019,533 and a population density of in 2006. It is one of the three areas of Hong Kong, along with Hong Kong Island and the New Territories. It is the smallest, second most populous and most densely populated of the divisions.
==Location==
Kowloon is located directly north of Hong Kong Island across Victoria Harbour. It is bordered by the Lei Yue Mun strait to the east, Mei Foo Sun Chuen, Butterfly Valley and Stonecutter&#x27;s Island to the west, a mountain range, including Tate&#x27;s Cairn and Lion Rock to the north, and Victoria Harbour to the south. 

==Administration==

Kowloon comprises the following districts: 
*Kowloon City
*Kwun Tong
*Sham Shui Po
*Wong Tai Sin
*Yau Tsim Mong

==Name==
The name &#x27;Kowloon&#x27; () alludes to eight mountains and a Chinese emperor: Kowloon Peak, Tung Shan, Tate&#x27;s Cairn, Temple Hill, Unicorn Ridge, Lion Rock, Beacon Hill, Crow&#x27;s Nest and Emperor Bing of Song. It was also spelt &#x27;Kawloong&#x27; in some 19th-century sources.

==History==

The part of Kowloon south of Boundary Street, together with Stonecutters Island, was ceded by Qing China to the United Kingdom under the Convention of Peking of 1860. For many years the area remained largely undeveloped, used by the British mainly for tiger-hunting expeditions.
The part of Kowloon north of Boundary Street (New Kowloon) was leased by the British as part of the New Territories under the 1898 Second Convention of Peking for 99 years. Within New Kowloon is Kowloon City, an area of Hong Kong where the Kowloon Walled City used to be located. The Kowloon Walled City itself was demolished in 1993. The same area was called Kwun Fu Cheung () during the Song dynasty (9601279). &quot;New Kowloon&quot; has remained part of the New Territories.

Statutorily, &quot;Kowloon&quot; is only the area south of Boundary Street and Stonecutters Island, but in common use, New Kowloon is not regarded as part of the New Territories, but as an integral part of the Kowloon urban area whether north or south of Boundary Street.

Large-scale development of Kowloon began in the early 20th century, with the construction of the Kowloon-Canton Railway and the Kowloon Wharf, but because of the close proximity of Kowloon&#x27;s built-up area to Kai Tak Airport, building construction was limited by flight paths. As a result, compared to Hong Kong Island, Kowloon had a much lower skyline. After World War II, Kowloon became extremely congested when slums for refugees from the newly established People&#x27;s Republic of China gave way to public housing estates, mixed with private residential, commercial, and industrial areas.

The area of reclaimed land now known as West Kowloon was once home to a dockyard for the Royal Navy.

The 1911 census recorded a population of 7,306, with most being Hakka. The invasion of China by Japan in 1937 caused the population of Kowloon to grow drastically. Between 1937 and 1939, 750,000 refugees arrived in Kowloon and nearby areas, with many not having residence.

==Demographics==
, 2,108,419 people lived in Kowloon.

About 94.2% of Kowloon&#x27;s residents are of ethnicity. The largest ethnic minority groups are Indonesians (1.8%), Filipinos (1.5%), Indians (0.5%), Nepalese (0.4%), and British (0.3%). Around 86% of Kowloon&#x27;s residents use Cantonese as their usual language, while 2.3% use English and 1.2% use Mandarin.

<text>The greylag goose or graylag goose (Anser anser) is a species of large goose in the waterfowl family Anatidae and the type species of the genus &quot;Anser&quot;. It has mottled and barred grey and white plumage and an orange beak and pink legs. A large bird, it measures between in length, with an average weight of . Its distribution is widespread, with birds from the north of its range in Europe and Asia often migrating southwards to spend the winter in warmer places, although many populations are resident, even in the north. It is the ancestor of most breeds of domestic goose, having been domesticated at least as early as 1360 BCE. The genus name and specific epithet are from &quot;anser&quot;, the Latin for &quot;goose&quot;.

Greylag geese travel to their northerly breeding grounds in spring, nesting on moorlands, in marshes, around lakes and on coastal islands. They normally mate for life and nest on the ground among vegetation. A clutch of three to five eggs is laid; the female incubates the eggs and both parents defend and rear the young. The birds stay together as a family group, migrating southwards in autumn as part of a flock, and separating the following year. During the winter they occupy semi-aquatic habitats, estuaries, marshes and flooded fields, feeding on grass and often consuming agricultural crops. Some populations, such as those in southern England and in urban areas across the species&#x27; range, are primarily resident and occupy the same area year-round.

==Taxonomy==
The greylag goose was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the ducks in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Anas anser&quot;. The specific epithet is Latin meaning &quot;goose&quot;. The greylag goose is now one of 11 geese placed in the genus &quot;Anser&quot; that was erected in 1860 by the French naturalist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. It is the type species of the genus.

Two subspecies are recognised: &quot;A. a. anser&quot;, the western greylag goose, which breeds in Iceland and northern and central Europe and &quot;A. a. rubrirostris&quot;, the eastern greylag goose, which breeds in Romania, Turkey, and Russia eastwards to northeastern China. The two subspecies intergrade where their ranges meet. The greylag goose sometimes hybridises with other species of goose, including the barnacle goose (&quot;Branta leucopsis&quot;) and the Canada goose (&quot;Branta canadensis&quot;), and occasionally with the mute swan (&quot;Cygnus olor&quot;). The greylag goose was one of the first animals to be domesticated; this happened at least 3,000 years ago in Ancient Egypt, the domestic subspecies being known as &quot;A. a. domesticus&quot;. As the domestic goose is a subspecies of the greylag goose they are able to interbreed, with the offspring sharing characteristics of both wild and domestic birds.

==Description==

The greylag is the largest and bulkiest of the grey geese of the genus &quot;Anser&quot;, but is more lightly built and agile than its domestic relative. It has a rotund, bulky body, a thick and long neck, and a large head and bill. It has pink legs and feet, and an orange or pink bill with a white or brown nail (hard horny material at tip of upper mandible). It is long with a wing length of . It has a tail , a bill of long, and a tarsus of . It weighs , with a mean weight of around . The wingspan is . Males are generally larger than females, with the sexual dimorphism more pronounced in the eastern subspecies &quot;rubirostris&quot;, which is larger than the nominate subspecies on average.
The plumage of the greylag goose is greyish brown, with a darker head and paler breast and belly with a variable amount of black spotting. It has a pale grey forewing and rump which are noticeable when the bird is in flight or stretches its wings on the ground. It has a white line bordering its upper flanks, and its wing coverts are light coloured, contrasting with its darker flight feathers. Its plumage is patterned by the pale fringes of the feathers. Juveniles differ mostly in their lack of black speckling on the breast and belly and by their greyish legs. Adults have a distinctive &#x27;concertina&#x27; pattern of folds in the feathers on their necks.
The greylag goose has a loud cackling call similar to that of the domestic goose, &quot;aahng-ung-ung&quot;, uttered on the ground or in flight. There are various subtle variations used under different circumstances, and individual geese seem to be able to identify other known geese by their voices. The sound made by a flock of geese resembles the baying of hounds. Goslings chirp or whistle lightly, and adults hiss if threatened or angered.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species has a Palearctic distribution. The nominate subspecies breeds in Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, the Baltic States, northern Russia, Poland, eastern Hungary, Romania, Germany and the Netherlands. It also breeds locally in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, North Macedonia and some other European countries. The eastern race extends eastwards across a broad swathe of Asia to China. Historically, European birds generally migrated southwards to spend winter in southern Europe and North Africa, but in recent decades many instead overwinter in or near their breeding range, even in Scandinavia. Asian birds migrate to Azerbaijan, Iran, Pakistan, northern India, Bangladesh and eastward to China. Greylags also occur as very rare winter migrants to South Korea and Japan. 

In North America, there are both feral domestic geese, which are similar to greylags, and occasional vagrant greylags. Greylag geese seen in the wild in New Zealand probably originated from the escape of farmyard geese, and a similar situation has occurred in Australia, where feral birds are now established in the east and southeast of the country.

In their breeding quarters, they are found on moors with scattered lochs, in marshes, fens and peat-bogs, besides lakes and on little islands some way out to sea. They like dense ground cover of reeds, rushes, heather, bushes and willow thickets. In their winter quarters, they frequent salt marshes, estuaries, freshwater marshes, steppes, flooded fields, bogs and pasture near lakes, rivers and streams. They also visit agricultural land where they feed on winter cereals, rice, beans or other crops, moving at night to shoals and sand-banks on the coast, mud-banks in estuaries or secluded lakes. Large numbers of immature birds congregate each year to moult on the Rone Islands near Gotland in the Baltic Sea.

Since the 1950s, increases in winter temperatures have resulted in greylag geese breeding in northern and central Europe, reducing their winter migration distances or even becoming resident. Wintering grounds closer to home can therefore be exploited, meaning that the geese can return to set up breeding territories earlier the following spring.

In Great Britain, their numbers had declined as a breeding bird, retreating north to breed wild only in the Outer Hebrides and the northern mainland of Scotland. However, during the 20th century, feral populations have been established elsewhere, and they have now re-colonised much of England. These populations are increasingly coming into contact and merging.

The greylag goose has become a pest species in several areas where its population has increased sharply. In Norway, the number of greylag geese is estimated to have increased three- to fivefold between 1995 and 2015. As a consequence, farmers&#x27; problems caused by goose grazing on farmland have increased considerably. This problem is also evident for the pink-footed goose. In the Orkney islands the population has increased dramatically: there were 300 breeding pairs, increasing to 10,000 in 2009, and 64,000 in 2019. Due to extensive damage caused to crops, the hunting season for the greylag goose in the Orkney islands is now most of the year.

==Behaviour==
Greylag geese are largely herbivorous and feed chiefly on grasses. Short, actively growing grass is more nutritious and greylag geese are often found grazing in pastures with sheep or cows. Because of its low nutrient status, they need to feed for much of their time; the herbage passes rapidly through the gut and is voided frequently. The tubers of sea clubrush (&quot;Bolboschoenus maritimus&quot;) are also taken as well as berries and water plants such as duckweed (&quot;Lemna&quot;) and floating sweetgrass (&quot;Glyceria fluitans&quot;). In wintertime they eat grass and leaves but also glean grain on cereal stubbles and sometimes feed on growing crops, especially during the night. They have been known to feed on oats, wheat, barley, buckwheat, lentils, peas and root crops. Acorns are sometimes consumed, and on the coast, seagrass (&quot;Zostera&quot; sp.) may be eaten. In the 1920s in Britain, the pink-footed goose &quot;discovered&quot; that potatoes were edible and started feeding on waste potatoes. The greylag followed suit in the 1940s and now regularly searches for tubers on ploughed fields. They also consume small fish, amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs and insects.

Greylag geese tend to pair bond in long-term monogamous relationships. Most such pairs are probably life-long partnerships, though 5 to 8% of the pairs separate and re-mate with other geese. Birds in heterosexual pairs may engage in promiscuous behavior, despite the opposition of their mates.

Homosexual pairs are common (14 to 20% of the pairs may be ganders, depending on flock), and share the characteristics of heterosexual pairs with the exceptions that the bonds appear to be closer, based on the intensity of their displays. Same-sex pairs also engage in courtship and sexual relations, and often assume high-ranking positions in the flock as a result of their superior strength and courage, leading some to speculate that they may serve as guardians of the flock. The sexual preference of the birds is generally flexible, as more than half of widowers re-pair with a bird of the opposite sex.

The nest is on the ground among heather, rushes, dwarf shrubs or reeds, or on a raft of floating vegetation. It is built from pieces of reed, sprigs of heather, grasses and moss, mixed with small feathers and down. A typical clutch is four to six eggs, but fewer eggs or larger numbers are not unusual. The eggs are creamy-white at first but soon become stained, and average . They are mostly laid on successive days and incubation starts after the last one is laid. The female does the incubation, which lasts about twenty-eight days, while the male remains on guard somewhere near. The chicks are precocial and able to leave the nest soon after hatching. Both parents are involved in their care and they soon learn to peck at food and become fully-fledged at eight or nine weeks, about the same time as their parents regain their ability to fly after moulting their main wing and tail feathers a month earlier. Immature birds undergo a similar moult, and move to traditional, safe locations before doing so because of their vulnerability while flightless.


Greylag geese are gregarious birds and form flocks. This has the advantage for the birds that the vigilance of some individuals in the group allows the rest to feed without having to constantly be alert to the approach of predators. After the eggs hatch, some grouping of families occur, enabling the geese to defend their young by their joint actions, such as mobbing or attacking predators. After driving off a predator, a gander will return to its mate and give a &quot;triumph call&quot;, a resonant honk followed by a low-pitched cackle, uttered with neck extended forward parallel with the ground. The mate and even unfledged young reciprocate in kind.

Young greylags stay with their parents as a family group, migrating with them in a larger flock, and only dispersing when the adults drive them away from their newly established breeding territory the following year. At least in Europe, patterns of migration are well understood and follow traditional routes with known staging sites and wintering sites. The young learn these locations from their parents which normally stay together for life. Greylags leave their northern breeding areas relatively late in the autumn, for example completing their departure from Iceland by November, and start their return migration as early as January. Birds that breed in Iceland overwinter in the British Isles; those from Central Europe overwinter as far south as Spain and North Africa; others migrate down to the Balkans, Turkey and Iraq for the winter.

==In human culture==


Geese are important to multiple culinary traditions. The meat, liver and other organs, fat, skin and blood are used culinarily in various cuisines.

The greylag was once revered across Eurasia. It was linked with the goddess of healing, Gula, a forerunner of the Sumerian fertility goddess Ishtar, in the cities of the Tigris-Euphrates delta over 5,000 years ago. In Ancient Egypt, geese symbolised the sun god Ra. In Ancient Greece and Rome, they were associated with the goddess of love, Aphrodite, and goose fat was used as an aphrodisiac. Since they were sacred birds, they were kept on Rome&#x27;s Capitoline Hill, from where they raised the alarm when the Gauls attacked in 390 BCE.

The goose&#x27;s role in fertility survives in modern British tradition in the nursery rhyme &quot;Goosey Goosey Gander&quot;, which preserves its sexual overtones (&quot;And in my lady&#x27;s chamber&quot;), while &quot;to goose&quot; still has a sexual meaning. The tradition of pulling a wishbone derives from the tradition of eating a roast goose at Michaelmas, where the goose bone was once believed to have the powers of an oracle. For that festival, in Thomas Bewick&#x27;s time, geese were driven in thousand-strong flocks on foot from farms all over the East of England to London&#x27;s Cheapside market, covering some per day. Some farmers painted the geese&#x27;s feet with tar and sand to protect them from road wear as they walked.

Greylag geese were domesticated by at least 1360 BCE, when images of domesticated birds resembling the eastern race, &quot;Anser anser rubirostris&quot; (which like modern farmyard geese, but unlike western greylags, have a pink beak) were painted in Ancient Egypt. Goose feathers were used as quill pens, the best being the primary feathers of the left-wing, whose &quot;curvature bent away from the eyes of right-handed writers&quot;. The feathers also served to fletch arrows. In ethology, the greylag goose was the subject of Konrad Lorenz&#x27;s pioneering studies of imprinting behaviour.

<text>The greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) is a species of goose, closely related to the smaller lesser white-fronted goose (&quot;A. erythropus&quot;). The greater white-fronted goose is migratory, breeding in northern Canada, Alaska, Greenland and Russia, and winters farther south in North America, Europe and Asia. It is named for the patch of white feathers bordering the base of its bill: &quot;albifrons&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;white&quot; and &quot;forehead&quot;. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it has been known as the white-fronted goose; in North America it is known as the greater white-fronted goose (or &quot;greater whitefront&quot;), and this name is also increasingly adopted internationally. Even more distinctive are the salt-and-pepper markings on the breast of adult birds, which is why the goose is colloquially called the &quot;specklebelly&quot; in North America.

==Description==

Greater white-fronted geese are in length, have a wingspan, and weigh . They have bright orange legs and mouse-coloured upper wing-coverts. They are smaller than greylag geese. As well as being larger than the lesser white-fronted goose, the greater white-fronted goose lacks the yellow eye-ring of that species, and the white facial blaze does not extend upwards so far as in the lesser.

The male is typical larger in size, both sexes are similar in appearance—greyish brown birds with light grey breasts dappled with dark brown to black blotches and bars. Both males and females also have a pinkish bill and orange legs and feet.

Greater white-fronted geese make a variation of sounds, but notably the most recognizable is the high pitched cackle that can be imitated by the sounds &quot;he-he.&quot; There is a distinct breaking of the note from the first cackle to the second.

===Differences between European and Greenland birds===
The appearance of European or Russian white-fronted geese, of the subspecies &quot;albifrons&quot; and Greenland white-fronted geese, of the subspecies &quot;flavirostris&quot; (which winters in the British Isles and occasionally reaches the northwest European mainland), differ in a number of ways. The Greenland white-fronted goose, in all plumages, looks darker and more &quot;oily-looking&quot; than the European and Asian white-fronted goose, both at rest and in flight.

The following are the differences which apply to first-winter plumage:

* The mantle and scapulars of &quot;flavirostris&quot; have narrow, indistinct pale fringes creating a uniform appearance to the birds&#x27; upperparts, whereas &quot;albifrons&quot; has noticeable whitish fringes creating obviously barred upperparts
* The tertials of &quot;flavirostris&quot; have indistinct pale fringes, whereas these pale fringes are more noticeable on &quot;albifrons&quot;
* The lesser- and median-upperwing-coverts of &quot;flavirostris&quot; have narrow, indistinct pale fringes, creating a rather uniform appearance to the wing, whereas on &quot;albifrons&quot;, these fringes are prominent and broad, creating wing-bars
* The greater-coverts of &quot;flavirostris&quot; are dark grey, with a narrow white tip, forming a narrow wing-bar; on &quot;albifrons&quot; they are blue-grey, with prominent white tips, forming a bold wing-bar
* The flank-line is narrows and white on &quot;flavirostris&quot;, but broad and bright white on &quot;albifrons&quot;
* The tail of &quot;flavirostris&quot; is dark brown, with a very narrow white tip and sides; that of &quot;albifrons&quot; is dark grey, and the white tip and sides are at least double the width of the corresponding areas on &quot;flavirostris&quot;
* The bill of &quot;flavirostris&quot; is orange-yellow with a dark nail, compared with the bright pink bill of &quot;albifrons&quot; which has only a hint of dark on the nail; in addition the bill of &quot;flavirostris&quot; is longer and appears slimmer than that of &quot;albifrons&quot;

The belly-barring on adult birds is on average more extensive on &quot;flavirostris&quot; than on &quot;albifrons&quot;, but the individual variation in both forms renders this of limited use as an identification feature.

The bill of adult Greenland white-fronts are also orange-yellow at the base, but can be more pinkish-yellow on the outer-half, thus close in colour to European white-fronts; the colour difference is more easily determined in dull, flat light rather than bright sunshine.

The Greenland white-fronts are of conservation concern. While most populations of the species have been increasing, the Greenland population continuously declined in the first two decades of the 2000s (after having continuously increased in the two preceding decades). The reason for this decline is not entirely clear, but likely related to more extreme weather conditions.

==Taxonomy==
The greater white-fronted goose is divided into five subspecies. The nominate subspecies, the European white-fronted goose (&quot;A. a. albifrons&quot;) breeds in the far north of Russia and winters further south and west in Europe and Asia.

Three other restricted-range subspecies occur in northern North America: Gambel&#x27;s white-fronted goose (&quot;A. a. gambeli&quot;) in interior northwestern Canada and wintering on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, slightly larger than the nominate form, the Pacific white-fronted goose (&quot;A. a. frontalis&quot;) and the tule goose (&quot;A. a. elgasi&quot;) in southwest Alaska, largest and longest-billed of all, both wintering in California. All these subspecies are similar in plumage, differing only in size.

The very distinct Greenland white-fronted goose (&quot;A. a. flavirostris&quot;) breeding in western Greenland, is much darker overall, with only a very narrow white tip to the tail (broader on the other subspecies), more black barring on its belly and usually has an orange (not pink) bill. It winters in Ireland and western Scotland.

Birds breeding in the far east of Siberia east to Arctic Canada, wintering in the United States and Japan, have been described as &quot;A. a. frontalis&quot; on the basis of their slightly larger size and a marginally longer bill. Another putative East Asian subspecies (&quot;A. a. albicans&quot;) has also been described. A 2012 study has found that &quot;frontalis&quot; and &quot;albicans&quot; do not merit subspecies status, the former being synonymised with &quot;gambeli&quot; and the latter with the nominate subspecies; this study found that these forms had been named on the wintering grounds from specimens whose breeding grounds were unknown.

Ecological studies conducted in 2002 suggest the Greenland birds should probably be considered a separate species from &quot;A. albifrons&quot;. Of particular interest is its unusually long period of parental care and association, which may last several years and can include grandparenting, possibly unique among the Anseriformes.

==Distribution==

The North American midcontinent birds of the subspecies &quot;A. a. gambeli&quot; – which in 2010 had a fall population of about 710,000 birds – breeds from the Alaska North Slope across the western and central Canadian Arctic. The Pacific white-fronted goose of the American Pacific coast, which in 2010 numbered approximately 650,000 birds, and the tule geese, which are estimated to number 10,000 birds, nest in western Alaska. The midcontinent geese gather in early fall on the prairies of western Saskatchewan and eastern Alberta, spending several weeks feeding before heading to wintering areas near the Gulf of Mexico, into northern Mexico. The Pacific birds migrate south down the Pacific coast, staging primarily in the Klamath Basin of southern Oregon and northern California and wintering, eventually, in California&#x27;s Central Valley. The tule goose is somewhat rare and has been since the latter half of the 19th century, presumably it was affected by destruction of its wintering habitat due to human settlement.

In the British Isles, two subspecies overwinter: Greenland birds in Scotland and Ireland, and Russian birds in England and Wales. They gather on farmland at favoured traditional sites, with a famous flock gathering at WWT Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, England. Greenland birds also overwinter in Ireland and from late September and through the winter months, Ireland is home to almost 50% of the Greenland population of white-fronted geese.

&quot;A. a. albifrons&quot; and &quot;A. a. flavirostis&quot; are among the taxa to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Weather conditions are a key factor in the annual breeding success of white-fronted geese. In the Arctic, the window of opportunity for nesting, incubating eggs, and raising a brood to flight state is open briefly, for about three months. Arriving in late May or early June, white-fronted geese begin departing for fall staging areas in early September. This means that a delayed snowmelt or late spring storm can significantly reduce the birds&#x27; reproductive success.

=== Origin of migration ===
Midcontinental white-fronted geese in North America have many breeding areas and each group in each breeding area differs in its migration time and wintering location. There are six breeding areas, including interior Alaska, the North Slope of Alaska, western Northwest Territories, western Nunavut, central Nunavut, and eastern Nunavut. These spatial differences lead to different departure times for white-fronted geese leaving their breeding areas. Birds from interior Alaska start migrating earlier during autumn and fly farther south to winter. Due to their migration, white-fronted geese are commonly sought after by waterfowl hunters, all across the country.

A technique using stable isotope analysis from a white-fronted goose has shown promise in providing a way to determine the migratory route birds take from their wintering to breeding grounds.

<doc id="198772" wikidata="Q1813899" url="?curid=198772" title="Mathematical Association of America">
<text>The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) is a professional society that focuses on mathematics accessible at the undergraduate level. Members include university, college, and high school teachers; graduate and undergraduate students; pure and applied mathematicians; computer scientists; statisticians; and many others in academia, government, business, and industry.

The MAA was founded in 1915 and is headquartered at 11 Dupont in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The organization publishes mathematics journals and books, including the &quot;American Mathematical Monthly&quot; (established in 1894 by Benjamin Finkel), the most widely read mathematics journal in the world according to records on JSTOR.

==Meetings==
The MAA sponsors the annual summer MathFest and cosponsors with the American Mathematical Society the Joint Mathematics Meeting, held in early January of each year. On occasion the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics joins in these meetings. Twenty-nine regional sections also hold regular meetings.

==Publications==
The association publishes multiple journals in partnership with Taylor &amp; Francis:
* &quot;The American Mathematical Monthly&quot; is expository, aimed at a broad audience from undergraduate students to research mathematicians.
* &quot;Mathematics Magazine&quot; is expository, aimed at teachers of undergraduate mathematics, especially at the junior-senior level.
* &quot;The College Mathematics Journal&quot; is expository, aimed at teachers of undergraduate mathematics, especially at the freshman-sophomore level.
* &quot;Math Horizons&quot; is expository, aimed at undergraduate students.

&quot;MAA FOCUS&quot; is the association member newsletter. The Association publishes an online resource, Mathematical Sciences Digital Library (Math DL). The service launched in 2001 with the online-only &quot;Journal of Online Mathematics and its Applications&quot; (JOMA) and a set of classroom tools, &quot;Digital Classroom Resources&quot;. These were followed in 2004 by &quot;Convergence&quot;, an online-only history magazine, and in 2005 by &quot;MAA Reviews&quot;, an online book review service, and &quot;Classroom Capsules and Notes&quot;, a set of classroom notes.

The MAA publishes several book series, aimed at a broad audience, but primarily for undergraduates majoring in mathematics. The series are: &quot;Anneli Lax New Mathematical Library&quot;, &quot;Carus Mathematical Monographs&quot;, &quot;Classroom Resource Materials&quot;, &quot;Dolciani Mathematical Expositions&quot;, &quot;MAA Notes&quot;, &quot;MAA Textbooks&quot;, &quot;Problem Books&quot;, and &quot;Spectrum&quot;.

==Competitions==
The MAA sponsors numerous competitions for students, including the William Lowell Putnam Competition for undergraduate students, the online competition series, and the American Mathematics Competitions (AMC) for middle- and high-school students. This series of competitions is as follows:
* AMC 8: 25 multiple choice questions in 40 minutes
*AMC 10/AMC 12: 25 multiple choice questions in 75 minutes
*AIME: 15 short answer questions in a 3-hour period
*USAMO/USAJMO: 6 questions, 2 days, 9 hours, proof-based olympiad

Through this program, outstanding students are identified and invited to participate in the Mathematical Olympiad Program. Ultimately, six high school students are chosen to represent the U.S. at the International Mathematics Olympiad.

==Sections==
The MAA is composed of the following twenty-nine regional sections:

Allegheny Mountain, EPADEL, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Intermountain, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana/Mississippi, MD-DC-VA, Metro New York, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska – SE SD, New Jersey, North Central, Northeastern, Northern CA – NV-HI, Ohio, Oklahoma-Arkansas, Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountain, Seaway, Southeastern, Southern CA – NV, Southwestern, Texas, Wisconsin

==Special Interest Groups==
There are seventeen Special Interest Groups of the Mathematical Association of America (SIGMAAs). These SIGMAAs were established to advance the MAA mission by supporting groups with a common mathematical interest, and facilitating interaction between such groups and the greater mathematics community.

* Mathematics and the Arts
* Business, Industry, Government
* Mathematical and Computational Biology
* Environmental Mathematics
* History of Mathematics
* Inquiry-Based Learning
* Math Circles for Students and Teachers
* Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching
* Philosophy of Mathematics
* Quantitative Literacy
* Recreational Mathematics
* Research in Undergraduate Mathematics Education
* Mathematics and Sports
* Statistics Education
* Teaching Advanced High School Mathematics
* Undergraduate Research
* Mathematics Instruction Using the WEB
==Awards and prizes==
The MAA distributes many prizes, including the Chauvenet Prize and the Carl B. Allendoerfer Award, Trevor Evans Award, Lester R. Ford Award, George Pólya Award, Merten M. Hasse Prize, Henry L. Alder Award, Euler Book Prize awards, the Yueh-Gin Gung and Dr. Charles Y. Hu Award for Distinguished Service to Mathematics, and Beckenbach Book Prize.

==Memberships==

The MAA is one of four partners in the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics (JPBM), and participates in the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS), an umbrella organization of sixteen professional societies.

==Historical accounts==
A detailed history of the first fifty years of the MAA appears in . A report on activities prior to World War II appears in . Further details of its history can be found in . In addition numerous regional sections of the MAA have published accounts of their local history.
The MAA was established in 1915. But the roots of the Association can be traced to the 1894 founding of the American Mathematical Monthly by Benjamin Finkel, who wrote &quot;Most of our existing journals deal almost exclusively with subjects beyond the reach of the average student or teacher of mathematics or at least with subjects with which they are familiar, and little, if any, space, is devoted to the solution of problems…No pains will be spared on the part of the Editors to make this the most interesting and most popular journal published in America.&quot;

The MAA records are preserved as part of the Archives of American Mathematics. 

==Inclusivity==
The MAA has for a long time followed a strict policy of inclusivity and non-discrimination.

In previous periods it was subject to the same problems of discrimination that were widespread across the United States. One notorious incident at a south-eastern sectional meeting in Nashville in 1951 has been documented by the American mathematician and equal rights activist Lee Lorch, who in 2007
received the most prestigious award given by the MAA (the Yueh-Gin Gung and Dr. Charles Y. Hu Award for Distinguished Service to Mathematics). The citation delivered at the 2007 MAA awards presentation, where Lorch received a standing ovation, recorded that:

:&quot;Lee Lorch, the chair of the mathematics department at Fisk University, and three Black colleagues, Evelyn Boyd (now Granville), Walter Brown, and H. M. Holloway came to the meeting and were able to attend the scientific sessions. However, the organizer for the closing banquet refused to honor the reservations of these four mathematicians. (Letters in Science, August 10, 1951, pp. 161–162 spell out the details). Lorch and his colleagues wrote to the governing bodies of the AMS and MAA seeking bylaws against discrimination. Bylaws were not changed, but non-discriminatory policies were established and have been strictly observed since then.&quot;

The Association&#x27;s first woman president was Dorothy Lewis Bernstein (1979–1980).

<text>The taiga bean goose (Anser fabalis) is a species of goose that breeds in northern Europe and Asia. It is migratory and winters further south in Europe and Asia. This and the tundra bean goose were recognised as separate species by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union and the American Ornithological Society from 2007, but are still considered a single species by some other authorities (collectively called bean goose), notably BirdLife International and the IUCN. The taiga and tundra bean goose diverged about 2.5 million years ago and established secondary contact 60,000 years ago, resulting in extensive gene flow.

== Description ==
The length ranges from , wingspan from and weight from . In the nominate subspecies, males average and females average . The bill is black at the base and tip, with an orange band across the middle; the legs and feet are also bright orange.

The upper wing-coverts are dark brown, as in the white-fronted goose (&quot;Anser albifrons&quot;) and the lesser white-fronted goose (&quot;A. erythropus&quot;), but differing from these in having narrow white fringes to the feathers. The voice is a loud honking.

The closely related pink-footed goose (&quot;A. brachyrhynchus&quot;) has the bill short, bright pink in the middle, and the feet also pink, the upper wing-coverts being paler and greyer, nearly of the same bluish-grey as in the greylag goose. In size and bill structure, it is very similar to the tundra bean goose subspecies &quot;Anser serrirostris rossicus&quot;, and in the past was sometimes treated as a sixth subspecies of bean goose.

== Taxonomy ==
The English and scientific names of the bean goose come from its habit in the past of grazing in bean field stubbles in winter. &quot;Anser&quot; is the Latin for &quot;goose&quot;, and &quot;fabalis&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;faba&quot;, the broad bean.

===Subspecies===
There are three subspecies, with complex variation in body size and bill size and pattern; generally, size increases from north to south and from west to east. 
* &quot;A. f. fabalis&quot; (Latham, 1787). Scandinavia east to the Urals, wintering mainly from Denmark east to Poland, locally west to Scotland and south to France, northern Italy, and Hungary. Large; bill long and narrow, with broad orange band.
* &quot;A. f. johanseni&quot; (Delacour, 1951). West Siberian taiga, wintering mainly in south-central Asia, rarely west to eastern Europe, and exceptionally south to northern India. Large; bill long and narrow, with narrow orange band.
* &quot;A. f. middendorffii&quot; (Severtzov, 1873). East Siberian taiga, wintering in eastern China, Korea, and Japan. Very large; bill long and stout, with narrow orange band.
== Conservation ==

The western subspecies &quot;A. f. fabalis&quot; wintering in Europe are considered to migrate across three different flyways: Western, Central and Eastern; these have been confirmed by stable isotope analysis of their flight feathers. &quot;Anser fabalis fabalis&quot; is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

It is a rare winter visitor to Great Britain; there are two regular wintering flocks of taiga bean goose, in the Yare Valley, Norfolk and the Avon Valley between Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland. A formerly regular flock in Dumfries and Galloway no longer occurs there.

<text>Colonia Tovar (Tovar Colony) is a cold mountain town of Venezuela, capital of the municipality Tovar in Aragua state. It is located about west of Caracas. It was founded on April 8, 1843, by a group of 390 immigrants from the then independent state of the Grand Duchy of Baden (later incorporated into Germany). It is characterized by the cultural imprint of its origin, so it is called &quot;the Germany of the Caribbean&quot;. The economy depends primarily on agriculture and tourism. Colonia Tovar is known for its temperate crops (peaches, strawberries, beets, cauliflower, carrots, cabbage, chard, broccoli, lettuce, onions and potatoes) and their derivatives. Since 1990 it has experienced high population growth, rising from 3,373 to 21,000 inhabitants in 2016.

==History==
Between 1806 and 1918, a state called the Grand Duchy of Baden occupied much of the eastern bank of the Rhine River in the southwest corner of the mountainous wine-producing area Kaiserstuhl. This duchy provided the majority of settlers in Colonia Tovar.

A colonizing company was formed, composed of colonel Agostino Codazzi and Ramón Díaz, and as guarantor Martín Tovar y Ponte (the Count of Tovar). Codazzi contacted residents of Kaiserstuhl and selected an area for the colony, choosing a site with geographic and climatic similarities to the German region. The land belonged to the nephew of Count of Tovar, Manuel Felipe Tovar, who donated it for the creation of the colony.

On October 14, 1841, the territory was founded as &quot;Palmar del Tuy&quot; and construction of infrastructure was begun. Once completed, the colonizing company went to the town of Endingen in Kaiserstuhl to select settlers. Contracts between the company and immigrants were signed at the inn &quot;Der Pfauen&quot;, a few meters from the entrance to the city. According to Alexander Benitz, the immigrants who embarked the &quot;Havre&quot; ship to Venezuela numbered 389: 239 men and 150 women, most from Kaiserstuhl. They departed for Venezuela on December 18, 1842.
They travelled along the Rhine, embarked at the port of Le Havre (France) on January 19, 1843, and arrived at the La Guaira on 4 March aboard the French ship &quot;Clemence&quot; piloted by Captain Malverin. The ship was scheduled to land on the Puerto Maya coast, north of La Victoria, but given that no previous journeys had followed the path mapped by Codazzi, the ship was forced to turn to Choroní on an alternate path. This path was also designed by Codazzi and opened by engineer Inder Pellegrini, leaving La Victoria to the place assigned for the new population. However, they could not disembark immediately in Choroní because of a smallpox epidemic on board. The passengers and crew quarantined in Choroní from March 13.

On March 31, they headed to the city of Maracay and La Victoria where they were received by President of Venezuela Carlos Soublette. Settlers arrived in Palmar del Tuy on April 8, 1843, 112 days after leaving Baden. That day is considered the foundation day of Colonia Tovar, which took the last name of the donor. The first residents included scientists, naturalists, writers and painters, such as Carl Ferdinand Appun, Hermann Karsten, Karl Moritz, Friedrich Gerstäcker, Anton Goering, Augustus Fendler, Ferdinand Bellermann (a painter who was sponsored by Humboldt), some buried in the city cemetery.

Initially, the village was organized around the production of coffee. As &quot;los colonieros&quot; were thriving, production spread to new lands and activities such as growing vegetables and fruits, sent to markets in Caracas or La Victoria. The manufacture of barrels became another income source.

For many years the colony was connected with Caracas by a river. The difficulty of communication, isolation and the environmental setting so different from the mountains of Germany kept the people relatively isolated, with slow or even negative population growth, due to rural exodus.

That trend reversed in the 1960s, when Colonia Tovar took up tourism, which led to significant economic development and population growth. It became one of the richest towns in the country measured by population and one of the highest in terms of quality of life.

The descendants of early settlers fully integrated into the country and the town natively speaks Spanish, although German fluency is common.

==Geography==
Colonia Tovar is located between 1,600 and 2,200 meters above sea level, in the central part of the Venezuelan Coastal Range. It is connected with Caracas and La Victoria by road. Its climate is temperate (&quot;Cwb&quot;) mountain with a daily temperature range of about , with a mean of , and frequent mists, especially at dawn and evening.

The city is located in northern Aragua state. The municipality has the shape of the letter &quot;L&quot;. It is bounded on the north by the Caribbean Sea, the northeast by the state of Vargas, in the east by Caracas (Libertador municipality) in the south by the Aragua River and to the east ends by the Santiago Mariño Municipality. Colonia Tovar sits on rugged terrain with creeks and streams. Misty mountain landscapes are characteristic of the Venezuelan Coastal Range (running along the Venezuelan coast). Codazzi peak (2,429 meters) is north of the town. The cloud forest characterizes the dominant vegetation but changes to gallery forest at lower altitudes before ending with savanna weeds southward and xerophytics in the north.

The colony is surrounded by houses (chalets) relatively far apart in many small plots of intensive use. It develops an intensive agriculture: flowers, strawberries, tomatoes, peaches, garlic, peaches and other temperate crops. Ceramic craft workshops, sausage factories, cookies and candy, breweries, canned foods (jams, peaches, etc..) are present. 

===Hydrography, flora and fauna===
The hydrography is divided into three basins: the Caribbean Sea, fed by the: San Miguel, Ocumare, Cata, Aroa and Tuy rivers; the Orinoco River, fed by the Memo and Guárico rivers; and the endorheic Lake Valencia, fed by the Aragua, Turmero, Maracay, Tapa-tapa, Tocorón, and Las Minas rivers. The River Aragua, southern boundary of the Colonia Tovar, was formed by the confluence of the Gabante and Curtidor rivers, above Pie de Cerro, north of La Victoria. The Gabante river is a tributary to Quebrada Honda, while Curtidor river converges with the San Carlos and Quebrada Coche rivers. All these rivers and streams originate in the high mountains surrounding Colonia Tovar. The headwaters of the Tuy River are near the town. 

The city is located in a catchment area of the river, which forms a kind of amphitheater. Colonia is located within Codazzi Peak Natural Monument and near Henri Pittier National Park. In addition to its diverse climate zones and flora. 

The diverse flora includes mostly epiphytes such as orchids, bromeliads and a variety of tree ferns. 

Colonia has diverse wildlife, mainly birds, totaling 578 registered species. Mammals and snakes contribute to this diversity. 
The local fauna is characteristic of cloud forests; a habitat for many endemic species due to its unique climate and peatland environment. Among the wildlife present, species most commonly referred to are the classic golden-headed quetzal and the toucan beak emerald bottle, also known as &quot;tiátaro.&quot; Coludo blue hummingbirds and tiles swallows are present. Among the most common primates is the black howler. Also common are the Tara butterfly, the mountaineer armadillo and many more. A frog is named after this area, the El Tovar Glass Frog &quot;(Celsiella revocata)&quot;, that lives in the cloud forests of this region. 

The Estación Biológica de Rancho Grande hosts a zoological museum that showcases area species. It has facilities and equipment such as magnifying glasses, water, trays and measurement instruments.

== Economy ==

Agriculture allowed the los colonieros to spread around the valley. Fruits and vegetables from there are sold throughout the country, especially in Caracas, Valencia, Maracay and La Victoria. Farmers and crafters set up markets with stalls that include red roofs. Colonia Tovar produces wooden casks. Los colonieros produce other crops and goods originating in German culture, such as peaches, tree tomato, passion fruit, strawberries, blackberries, figs, vegetables, bread, sausages, pastry, sauces and pasta, beer, wood, ceramics, wrought iron and crafts. With the influx of tourism from the 1960s, cottages were converted to hotels, restaurants were built into traditional huts. Tourism, mainly from Caracas, Valencia and Maracay has been replacing agriculture as the main economic activity.

==Language and culture==

Colonia Tovar operated as a closed community. The founders intended to maintain their cultural traditions. Upon arrival, they built houses reflecting the distinctive architecture of Kaiserstuhl. The Baden dialect (&quot;Badisches Dialekt&quot;) dominated the area and food and clothing remained traditional. For a time marriage outside the colonia was forbidden in order to ensure ethnic and cultural continuity.

Although the official language of Venezuela is Spanish, some people in Colonia Tovar speak &quot;alemannisch&quot;: Alemannic, Alemán Coloniero precisely. It is a variant language that was inherited from previous generations, although many phonetic and lexical motifs are no longer used in Europe. Moreover, the Alemán Coloniero has a strong influence of Spanish words with an ending in Alemán Coloniero. Many words came about after the Colonia Tovar was created, because of minimal communication with Germany. Most descendants of German settlers in Colonia Tovar now mostly speak Standard German.

The houses, buildings, and shops are made according to the Kaiserstuhl style, giving Colonia Tovar an unmistakable peculiar identity. The Church of St. Martin de Tours in the center of town is a copy of the Endingen in Germany, origin of most of the founders.

In 1940, Spanish was established as the official language and exogamous marriage became a free practice. In the early 21st century, the inhabitants started to integrate into Venezuelan culture, without abandoning their customs. Among the traditions that remain is craftsmanship in wood, ceramic and other materials. The Academic Center of Violin is a local school that prepares students in the art of manufacturing, maintenance and repair of symphonic instruments.

==Gastronomy==

The cuisine is conditioned by its German origin. Popular desserts include &quot;strudels&quot;, &quot;gugelhupf&quot;, cakes and churros and/or strawberries with cream, the traditionals &quot;Kaiserschmarrn&quot;, &quot;Germknödel&quot;, &quot;Apfelstrudel&quot; and &quot;Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte&quot;, known in English as Black Forest cake, along with charcuterie and specialties including the famous German sausages. Also characteristic is the local beer.

==Dances and celebrations==


&quot;Oktoberfest&quot; is held annually in October. On occasion, groups from Germany were invited to play traditional music. The International Festival of Chamber Music also takes place.

April 8 is celebrated as the Colonia&#x27;s founding date. Cultural activities in the Plaza Bolívar include a parade involving educational activities, dance groups, and cultural exchanges between locals and guests. The annual election of the Queen of Colonia Tovar is then.

Carnival parades include Jokilis and Gorilas. The Jokili is a character that appeared in Germany in 1782, a mixture of jester and harlequin. Their dress consists of a red suit with a fringed collar, sleeves, waist and legs, which reveal bells. They sport a three-pointed hat, white gloves and pointed shoes. They have a wooden mask, custom made for each Jokili. A carved wooden stick, which carries a knotted rope and a pig&#x27;s bladder, a globe, is the instrument that usually hits bystanders.

St. Martin of Tours, the patron saint of travelers, is honored on 11 November. The church has an image of the saint, brought by the founders from Baden. On the same day is the Festival of Flowers, Fruits, and Crafts, in which prizes are awarded to the best products.

Two music festivals are held annually, one between March and April, and the other between August and September. One celebrates cultural heritage, held since 1992 and known as the International Festival of Chamber Music Colonia Tovar. The second is the Friends of Chamber Music Colonia Tovar, which has been held since 1997.

Along with the religious celebrations of Easter, in Colonia Tovar the traditional German &quot;nests&quot; take place, to celebrate the coming of Easter bunnies and eggs. It usually involves whole families, and it is customary for the children look for hidden eggs. The following Monday, the residents attend the Chapel of the Resurrection. A blessing of crops and food is given.

==Attractions==
The City Museum offers history, customs, and traditions of the Germanic people.

Breikanz Mall is a series of shops offering crafts particular to Germany and typical of the region. Its restaurants offer steaks, embutidos (cold meats or cured meats like sausage, bologna and salami), and Vienna sausages.

Codazzi Peak reaches 2,429 m high in Aragua. It covers 11,850 sq m, shared by the states of Vargas, Miranda and the Capital District. It was declared a national monument on June 5, 1991, in honor of Italian geographer/cartographer Agostino Codazzi (1793-1859). The Panarigua Archaeological Museum and Panarigua Inn are there.

Tovar Brewery was the first Venezuelan beer made in Colonia Tovar in 1843, arrived with its founders. Production methods have remained unchanged. It is produced by Cervecería Tovar C. A., and observes the quality standards defined in the Bavarian Purity Law of 1516.

Several buildings in the city center and around the Plaza Bolivar form the historical town&#x27;s center. The most representative buildings are the Church of St. Martin of Tours, the Casa Codazzi, and the Old School. Many restaurants, cafes, craft shops are present.

Also located in the city center, Anno Domine Museum holds equipment belonging to the first settlers, documents, and paintings belonging to Baroness Elizabeth von Seller.

<text>A composer is a person who writes music. The term is especially used to indicate composers of Western classical music, or those who are composers by occupation. Many composers are, or were, also skilled performers of music.

==Etymology and definition==
The term is descended from Latin, ; literally &quot;one who puts together&quot;. The earliest use of the term in a musical context given by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is from Thomas Morley&#x27;s 1597 &quot;A Plain and Easy Introduction to Practical Music&quot;, where he says &quot;Some wil be good descanters [...] and yet wil be but bad composers&quot;.

&quot;Composer&quot; is a loose term that generally refers to any person who writes music. More specifically, it is often used to denote people who are composers by occupation, or those who work in the tradition of Western classical music. Writers of exclusively or primarily songs may be called composers, but since the 20th century the terms &#x27;songwriter&#x27; or &#x27;singer-songwriter&#x27; are more often used, particularly in popular music genres. In other contexts, the term &#x27;composer&#x27; can refer to a literary writer, or more rarely and generally, someone who combines pieces into a whole.

Across cultures and traditions composers may write and transmit music in a variety of ways. In much popular music, the composer writes a composition, and it is then transmitted via oral tradition. Conversely, in some Western classical traditions music may be composed aurally—i.e. &quot;in the mind of the musician&quot;—and subsequently written and passed through written documents.

==Role in the Western world==
===Relationship with performers===
In the development of European classical music, the function of composing music initially did not have much greater importance than that of performing it. The preservation of individual compositions did not receive enormous attention and musicians generally had no qualms about modifying compositions for performance.

In the Western world, before the Romantic period of the 19th century, composition almost always went side by side with a combination of either singing, instructing and theorizing.

Even in a conventional Western piece of instrumental music, in which all of the melodies, chords, and basslines are written out in musical notation, the performer has a degree of latitude to add artistic interpretation to the work, by such means as by varying their articulation and phrasing, choosing how long to make fermatas (held notes) or pauses, and — in the case of bowed string instruments, woodwinds or brass instruments — deciding whether to use expressive effects such as vibrato or portamento. For a singer or instrumental performer, the process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed &quot;interpretation&quot;. Different performers&#x27; interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or phrasing of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their music are interpreting, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as performance practice, whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer. 

Although a musical composition often has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in popular music when a band collaborates to write a song, or in musical theatre, where the songs may be written by one person, the orchestration of the accompaniment parts and writing of the overture is done by an orchestrator, and the words may be written by a third person.

A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or, in the 20th and 21st centuries, computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples of this range from wind chimes jingling in a breeze, to avant-garde music from the 20th century that uses graphic notation, to text compositions such as &quot;Aus den Sieben Tagen&quot;, to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called aleatoric music, and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as John Cage, Morton Feldman, and Witold Lutosławski.

The nature and means of individual variation of the music are varied, depending on the musical culture in the country and the time period it was written. For instance, music composed in the Baroque era, particularly in slow tempos, often was written in bare outline, with the expectation that the performer would add improvised ornaments to the melody line during a performance. Such freedom generally diminished in later eras, correlating with the increased use by composers of more detailed scoring in the form of dynamics, articulation et cetera; composers became uniformly more explicit in how they wished their music to be interpreted, although how strictly and minutely these are dictated varies from one composer to another. Because of this trend of composers becoming increasingly specific and detailed in their instructions to the performer, a culture eventually developed whereby faithfulness to the composer&#x27;s written intention came to be highly valued (see, for example, Urtext edition). This musical culture is almost certainly related to the high esteem (bordering on veneration) in which the leading classical composers are often held by performers.

The historically informed performance movement has revived to some extent the possibility of the performer elaborating seriously the music as given in the score, particularly for Baroque music and music from the early Classical period. The movement might be considered a way of creating &quot;greater&quot; faithfulness to the original in works composed at a time that expected performers to improvise. In genres other than classical music, the performer generally has more freedom; thus for instance when a performer of Western popular music creates a &quot;cover&quot; of an earlier song, there is little expectation of exact rendition of the original; nor is exact faithfulness necessarily highly valued (with the possible exception of &quot;note-for-note&quot; transcriptions of famous guitar solos).

In Western art music, the composer typically orchestrates their compositions, but in musical theatre and pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop songwriter may not use notation at all, and, instead, compose the song in their mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music. The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by the examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough for the creation of popular and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces and to include spontaneously improvised works like those of free jazz performers and African percussionists such as Ewe drummers.

===History of employment===
During the Middle Ages, most composers worked for the Catholic church and composed music for religious services such as plainchant melodies. During the Renaissance music era, composers typically worked for aristocratic employers. While aristocrats typically required composers to produce a significant amount of religious music, such as Masses, composers also penned many non-religious songs on the topic of courtly love: the respectful, reverential love of a great woman from afar. Courtly love songs were very popular during the Renaissance era. During the Baroque music era, many composers were employed by aristocrats or as church employees. During the Classical period, composers began to organize more public concerts for profit, which helped composers to be less dependent on aristocratic or church jobs. This trend continued in the Romantic music era in the 19th century. In the 20th century, composers began to seek employment as professors in universities and conservatories. In the 20th century, composers also earned money from the sales of their works, such as sheet music publications of their songs or pieces or as sound recordings of their works.

===Role of women===

In 1993, American musicologist Marcia Citron asked, &quot;Why is music composed by women so marginal to the standard &#x27;classical&#x27; repertoire?&quot; Citron &quot;examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received &#x27;canon&#x27; of performed musical works.&quot; She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote art songs for performance in small recitals rather than symphonies intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.

According to Abbey Philips, &quot;women musicians have had a very difficult time breaking through and getting the credit they deserve.&quot; During the Medieval eras, most of the art music was created for liturgical (religious) purposes and due to the views about the roles of women that were held by religious leaders, few women composed this type of music, with the nun Hildegard von Bingen being among the exceptions. Most university textbooks on the history of music discuss almost exclusively the role of male composers. As well, very few works by women composers are part of the standard repertoire of classical music. In &quot;Concise Oxford History of Music&quot;, &quot;Clara Shumann is one of the only female composers mentioned&quot;, but other notable women composers of the common practice period include Fanny Mendelssohn and Cécile Chaminade, and arguably the most influential teacher of composers during the mid-20th century was Nadia Boulanger. Philips states that &quot;[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts.&quot;

Women today are being taken more seriously in the realm of concert music, though the statistics of recognition, prizes, employment, and overall opportunities are still biased toward men.

===Clustering===
Famous composers have a tendency to cluster in specific cities throughout history. Based on over 12,000 prominent composers listed in &quot;Grove Music Online&quot; and using word count measurement techniques, the most important cities for classical music can be quantitatively identified.

Paris has been the main hub for western classical music in all periods. It was ranked fifth in the 15th and 16th centuries but first in the 17th to 20th centuries inclusive. London was the second most meaningful city: eighth in the 15th century, seventh in the 16th, fifth in the 17th, second in the 18th and 19th centuries, and fourth in the 20th century. Rome topped the rankings in the 15th century, dropped to second in the 16th and 17th centuries, eighth in the 18th century, ninth in the 19th century but back at sixth in the 20th century. Berlin appears in the top ten rankings only in the 18th century and was ranked third most important city in both the 19th and 20th centuries. New York City entered the rankings in the 19th century (in fifth place) and stood at second rank in the 20th century. The patterns are very similar for a sample of 522 top composers.

==Modern training==
Professional classical composers often have a background in performing classical music during their childhood and teens, either as a singer in a choir, as a player in a youth orchestra, or as a performer on a solo instrument (e.g., piano, pipe organ, or violin). Teens aspiring to be composers can continue their postsecondary studies in a variety of formal training settings, including colleges, conservatories, and universities. Conservatories, which are the standard musical training system in countries such as France and Canada, provide lessons and amateur orchestral and choral singing experience for composition students. Universities offer a range of composition programs, including bachelor&#x27;s degrees, Master of Music degrees, and Doctor of Musical Arts degrees. As well, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and festivals, which give students the opportunity to get coaching from composers.

===Undergraduate===
Bachelor&#x27;s degrees in composition (referred to as B.Mus. or B.M) are four-year programs that include individual composition lessons, amateur orchestra/choral experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Usually, composition students must complete significant pieces or songs before graduating. Not all composers hold a B.Mus. in composition; composers may also hold a B.Mus. in music performance or music theory.

===Masters===
Master of Music degrees (M.mus.) in composition consists of private lessons with a composition professor, ensemble experience, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two concerts featuring the composition student&#x27;s pieces. A master&#x27;s degree in music (referred to as an M.Mus. or M.M.) is often a required minimum credential for people who wish to teach composition at a university or conservatory. A composer with an M.Mus. could be an adjunct professor or instructor at a university, but it would be difficult in the 2010s to obtain a tenure track professor position with this degree.

===Doctoral===
To become a tenure track professor, many universities require a doctoral degree. In composition, the key doctoral degree is the Doctor of Musical Arts, rather than the PhD; the PhD is awarded in music, but typically for subjects such as musicology and music theory.

Doctor of Musical Arts (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D) degrees in composition provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master&#x27;s degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor&#x27;s degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Students must submit examples of their compositions. If available, some schools will also accept video or audio recordings of performances of the student&#x27;s pieces. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination are required.

Students must prepare significant compositions under the guidance of faculty composition professors. Some schools require DMA composition students to present concerts of their works, which are typically performed by singers or musicians from the school. The completion of advanced coursework and a minimum B average are other typical requirements of a D.M.A program. During a D.M.A. program, a composition student may get experience teaching undergraduate music students.

===Other routes===
Some composers did not complete composition programs, but focused their studies on the performance of voice or an instrument or on music theory, and developed their compositional skills over the course of a career in another musical occupation.

<text>Gustavus Ferdinand von Tempsky (15 February 1828 – 7 September 1868) was a Prussian adventurer, artist, newspaper correspondent and soldier in New Zealand, Australia, California, Mexico and the Mosquito Coast of Central America. He was also an amateur watercolourist who painted the New Zealand bush and the military campaign.

==Early life==
Gustav Ferdinand von Tempsky was born in Braunsberg, East Prussia, into a Prussian noble family. The family had branches in Silesia and elsewhere and had a long military tradition. Von Tempsky was brought up in Liegnitz in Lower Silesia. After this time, he was sent to a junior cadet school in Potsdam and then a cadet school in Berlin. He was a cousin of the German writer Valeska von Gallwitz.

In 1844, he was commissioned into his father&#x27;s regiment in the Royal Prussian Army, possibly the Garde-Fusilier Regiment in which his brother, Benno Waldemar von Tempsky was a second lieutenant. In 1846, tiring of the routine, von Tempsky left the regiment after only nine months for the Prussian settlement on the Mosquito Coast of Central America. He accepted a commission to command a force of Mosquito Indians, which had been set up by Britain, but after his friend the British Consul-General slipped overboard and was devoured by alligators, he lost his taste for that adventure and headed to the American West.

In 1850, he went to the new California goldfields, but did not strike gold. In 1853, he returned to the Prussian colony, via Mexico, Guatemala, and Salvador, and later wrote a book, &quot;Mitla&quot;, about his journey.

He had been courting Emilia Ross Bell, the elder daughter of the British government agent from Scotland, James Stanislaus Bell, at the nearby British settlement of Bluefields (or Blewfields) before he left, but her father did not approve, probably because of his youth and lack of prospects. After his return, on 9 July 1855 at Bluefields, he married Emilia. In 1858 a son, Louis von Tempski, was born in Glasgow, Scotland.

The family emigrated from Liverpool to Victoria, Australia on the ship &quot;Sirocco&quot;, arriving in Port Melbourne on 1 August 1858, with two young sons, Randal age two, and Louis, age one. Two more children were registered as born on the Bendigo goldfields. The above-mentioned Louis von Tempsky&#x27;s birth was registered at Sandhurst, Victoria, in 1858, and Lina von Tempsky, born 1859 at Sandhurst.

In Melbourne, von Tempsky made vigorous approaches to lead the proposed Trans-Continental Exploring Expedition, but his suit was ill-favoured by the committee, in the main because of the English prejudice of leading members, who chose Robert O&#x27;Hara Burke to lead. The venture became known as the Burke and Wills expedition, with the well-known and fatal outcomes. In the aftermath, von Tempsky took his family via the ship &quot;Benjamin Heape&quot; across the Tasman to New Zealand, departing Melbourne on 13 February 1862.

==Joins the Forest Rangers==

On his arrival in New Zealand, von Tempsky settled on the Coromandel Peninsula as a gold-miner and newspaper correspondent.

Upon the outbreak of war in 1863 von Tempsky moved to Drury, just south of Auckland, where he was a correspondent for &quot;The Daily Southern Cross&quot; newspaper. Here he quickly struck up a friendship with Captain Jackson and the officers of the Forest Rangers and was soon invited to accompany them on their patrols. Soon afterwards, on 26 August 1863, Governor Grey responding to a suggestion by Captain Jackson naturalised von Tempsky as a British subject and made him an ensign in the Forest Rangers.

The Forest Rangers were an irregular volunteer force intended to take the war into the bush and to fight the enemy Māori on their own ground. Jackson was a cautious officer who was determined to give his men thorough training. Von Tempsky relied more on dash and élan; he was also a tireless self-publicist, avid for glory and admiration.

Very early on it was realised that the weapons and equipment used by the British Army were unsuited to irregular warfare in the dense wet New Zealand bush. With only about 100 men in the Forest Rangers at any one time, it was relatively easy to gather special equipment although in the early period in the Hunua Ranges, they were fobbed off with second-hand revolvers, most of which were unserviceable. When von Tempsky formed his own 2nd company for service in Taranaki, he had 30 or more large Bowie knives made by a cutler in Symonds Street, Auckland, from the spring steel of a cart. Only one of these knives is believed to still exist. The standard long weapon was the Calisher and Terry .54 carbine, called the Terry by the Rangers. With its short barrel, light weight, breech loading and waterproofed cartridge unit, it was the ideal weapon for the mainly close quarter fighting. The Taranaki Rangers carried just one Pattern 1853 Enfield rifle for sniping. Von Tempsky himself carried two Colt Navy .36 pistols and was able to obtain more of these smaller calibre revolvers for his unit. The Rangers also used the .44 calibre Beaumont–Adams five-shot revolver. Von Tempsky, is often portrayed as carrying a sabre which he carried unsheathed when expecting battle. The uniform and equipment were chosen to match the mobile role of the Rangers. The unit frequently carried only three days&#x27; rations in the field, being expected to live off the land to some extent.

In November 1863, the Forest Rangers were disbanded, not because they were unsuccessful but because their period of enlistment was finished. However Jackson was immediately authorised to form a new company along similar lines. 
A few days later, Tempsky, called &quot;Von&quot; by some of his men, was promoted to captain and was also commissioned to raise a second company of Forest Rangers. From then on, he and Jackson were always in competition for men, resources, and glory.

During the early stages of the Waikato War, the Forest Rangers were used to protect the army&#x27;s supply lines from marauding Māori, patrolling mainly in the Hunua Ranges south of Auckland and trying to intercept enemy war parties before they reached the Great South Road. It was during this time that von Tempsky emerged as a very effective leader who was able to inspire great loyalty in his men. He was known to the Māori as Manurau, &quot;the bird that flits everywhere&quot;.

Later, the Forest Rangers were moved to the front and took part in the siege of Paterangi. It was during this period that they were involved in a dramatic rescue of some soldiers ambushed by the Māori while swimming in the Waikato River. Both Jackson and von Tempsky received a Mention in Despatches and Tempsky later painted a well known water colour showing himself in a very dramatic light. However, it was another officer, Charles Heaphy, who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a result of his bravery in this action.

The Forest Rangers were involved in the siege of Orakau, and then heavily implicated in the massacre which followed the breakout of the defenders.

By 1865, Jackson had resigned his commission and von Tempsky, now a major, was in command of the Forest Rangers. They were soon involved in the Second Taranaki War. This was a frustrating period because of the conflicting loyalties and objectives of Government forces. The commanders of the British Imperial Troops had had enough of fighting what they saw as unnecessary wars on behalf of the New Zealand Government. On the other hand, the New Zealand-raised units such as the Forest Rangers wanted to pursue the war with vigour. The deadlock was only broken when Governor Grey personally took command of the New Zealand forces. Von Tempsky, however, missed the subsequent action, being laid low by rheumatism.

==Court-martial==

After a brief holiday in Auckland, von Tempsky took part in the Tauranga Campaign (although it is not clear in what capacity) and was present at the siege of Ōpōtiki. From there, he sailed to Wellington and resumed command of the Forest Rangers, who in the meantime had mutinied and were refusing to embark and sail for the East Cape War. Finding that, when he got there, he would be expected to serve under an officer he considered junior to himself, von Tempsky joined the mutiny and refused to accept any further orders.

He was arrested and court-martialled. The outcome could have been serious, but a change in government resulted in von Tempsky being given a second chance. While the bulk of the Forest Rangers went off to the East Cape, von Tempsky and the other mutineers were allowed to return to Wanganui, where he took part in McDonnell&#x27;s and Chute&#x27;s later Taranaki campaigns against the Hau Hau.

==The Taranaki Wars==

The Forest Rangers were finally disbanded in Te Awamutu in mid-1866. Von Tempsky was immediately invited to take command of No. 5 Division of the Armed Constabulary. When Titokowaru&#x27;s War broke out in 1868, von Tempsky and his division were very soon drafted and sent to the front.

On 12 July 1868, there occurred an incident which is still a matter of controversy among New Zealand historians. While in command of the fort at Patea, von Tempsky was told that an unfinished redoubt about seven kilometres away was under heavy attack. Giving his second-in-command strict orders to hold the fort, he immediately rushed off on foot to join the battle. By the time he arrived, ten of the defenders were dead and another six injured, while the attackers were able to escape. In his report of 21 August 1868, Von Tempsky singled out the Marist priest Fr Jean-Baptiste Rolland for his bravery under fire as he tended the wounded – Catholic and Protestant – on the battle line. Fr Rolland was present at the battle at which von Tempsky was himself killed two weeks later.
It was now September and the Government was anxious for a quick end to the conflict, and they pressured McDonnell into making a premature attack on Tītokowaru&#x27;s main Pa, Te Ngutu o Te Manu or The Bird&#x27;s Beak. On 7 September, the defenders were ready and waiting when the militia arrived and they came under heavy and accurate fire. Wisely, McDonnell very soon decided to withdraw, as he was well aware of the futility of trying to attack a defended Māori Pa. Von Tempsky protested and then began to advance on the Pa. Within a few moments, he was dead, killed by a bullet through his forehead, one of the fifty or so killed and wounded in the engagement.

James Shanaghan, an eyewitness, reported how von Tempsky died: I had not gone far when a man of our company was shot. The Major went to his assistance, and was shot, the bullet entering the centre of his forehead. He fell dead on top of the man to whose assistance he was going. That was how von Tempsky died.
Although the corpses of some other soldiers were eaten, von Tempsky was held in high esteem by the Maori, and Kimble Bent said that Titokowaru ordered that von Tempsky&#x27;s body be placed onto a funeral pyre in the centre of the marae. In 1965, Tonga Awikau, aged 101, described how as a child he had seen this cremation of 20 British dead, including Major von Tempsky.

The local Maori returned his sword sheath to his widow. It is now held by the Thomsons in Hawkes Bay.

After the loss of their leader, his unit fell apart. Many of the men mutinied and then deserted, refusing to serve under any other commander. At the end of September, the 5th Division of the Armed Constabulary was disbanded and never reformed.

==Family==

His widow, Emilia, died in 1900. His daughter Lina lived in New Zealand. Two of his three sons, Ronald and Louis, moved to Hawaii, where they became ranchers. Louis managed the Haleakala Ranch. Armine von Tempsky, a daughter of Louis, became one of Hawaii&#x27;s best-known writers. They sometimes used the alternative spelling of their name: Tempski.

More descendants of Gustavus von Tempsky remain in New Zealand, especially in the Hawkes Bay area through the Thomson family.

In 1948, Edmund L. Kowalczyk published in the Polish American Historical Association about Tempsky and erroneously claimed him as &quot;One of the most colorful Polish Argonauts...born in Lignice 1828.&quot;

<text>The Hitler Youth ( , often abbreviated as HJ, ) was the youth organisation of the Nazi Party in Germany. Its origins date back to 1922 and it received the name (&quot;Hitler Youth, League of German Worker Youth&quot;) in July 1926. From 1936 until 1945, it was the sole official boys&#x27; youth organisation in Germany and it was partially a paramilitary organisation. It was composed of the Hitler Youth proper for male youths aged 14 to 18, and the German Youngsters in the Hitler Youth ( or &quot;DJ&quot;, also &quot;DJV&quot;) for younger boys aged 10 to 14.

With the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945, the organisation &quot;de facto&quot; ceased to exist. On 10 October 1945, the Hitler Youth and its subordinate units were outlawed by the Allied Control Council along with other Nazi Party organisations. Under Section 86 of the Criminal Code of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hitler Youth is an &quot;unconstitutional organisation&quot; and the distribution or public use of its symbols, except for educational or research purposes, is illegal.

== Origins ==
In 1922, the Munich-based Nazi Party established its official youth organisation called . It was announced on 8 March 1922 in the , and its inaugural meeting took place on 13 May the same year. Another youth group was established in 1922 as the . Based in Munich, Bavaria, it served to train and recruit future members of the (SA), the main paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party at that time.

One reason the Hitler Youth (HJ) so easily developed was that regimented organisations, often focused on politics, for young people and particularly adolescent boys were a familiar concept to German society in the Weimar Republic. Numerous youth movements existed across Germany prior to and especially after World War I. They were created for various purposes. Some were religious and others were ideological, but the more prominent ones were formed for political reasons, like the Young Conservatives and the Young Protestants. Once Hitler came onto the revolutionary scene, the transition from seemingly innocuous youth movements to political entities focused on Hitler was swift.

Following the abortive Beer Hall Putsch (in November 1923), Nazi youth groups ostensibly disbanded, but many elements simply went underground, operating clandestinely in small units under assumed names. In April 1924, the was renamed (Greater German Youth Movement). On 4 July 1926, the was officially renamed (Hitler Youth League of German Worker Youth). This event took place a year after the Nazi Party was reorganised. The architect of the re-organisation was Kurt Gruber, a law student from Plauen in Saxony.

After a short power struggle with a rival organisation—Gerhard Roßbach&#x27;s —Gruber prevailed and his &quot;Greater German Youth Movement&quot; became the Nazi Party&#x27;s official youth organisation. In July 1926, it was renamed (&quot;Hitler Youth, League of German Worker Youth&quot;). The name was taken up on the suggestion of Hans Severus Ziegler. By 1930, the (HJ) had enlisted over 25,000 boys aged 14 and upward. They also set up a junior branch, the (DJ), for boys aged 10 to 14. Girls from 10 to 18 were given their own parallel organisation, the League of German Girls (BDM). On 30 October 1931, the HJ officially became part of the SA through a decree issue by Hitler, under the notional command of Ernst Röhm.

== Membership ==
In 1923, the youth organisation of the Nazi Party had a little over 1,200 members. In 1925, when the Nazi Party was refounded, the membership grew to over 5,000. Five years later, national membership stood at 26,000. By the end of 1932, it was at 107,956. In April 1932, Chancellor Heinrich Brüning banned the Hitler Youth movement in an attempt to stop widespread political violence. However, in June, Brüning&#x27;s successor as Chancellor, Franz von Papen, lifted the ban as a way of appeasing Hitler, the rapidly ascending political star. A further significant expansion drive started in 1933, after Baldur von Schirach was appointed by Hitler as the first (Reich Youth Leader). All youth organizations were brought under Schirach&#x27;s control. 

When the Nazis came to power in 1933, the membership of Hitler Youth organisations increased dramatically to 2,300,000 members by the end of that year. Much of this increase came from the forcible takeover of other youth organisations. The sizeable (Evangelical Youth), a Lutheran youth organisation of 600,000 members, was integrated on 18 February 1934. In December 1936, a law declared the Hitler Youth to be the only legally permitted youth organisation in Germany, and stated that &quot;all of the German youth in the Reich is organised within the Hitler Youth&quot;.

By December 1936, Hitler Youth membership had reached over five million. That same month, membership became mandatory for Aryans under the (Hitler Youth Law). This legal obligation was reaffirmed in March 1939 with the (Youth Service Duty), which conscripted all German youths into the Hitler Youth—even if the parents objected. Parents who refused to allow their children to join were subject to investigation by the authorities. From then on, the vast majority of Germany&#x27;s teenagers belonged to the Hitler Youth. By 1940, it had eight million members.

Even before membership was made mandatory in 1939, German youth faced strong pressure to join. Students who held out were frequently assigned essays with titles such as &quot;Why am I not in the Hitler Youth?&quot; They were also the subject of frequent taunts from teachers and fellow students, and could even be refused their diploma—which made it impossible to be admitted to university. A number of employers refused to offer apprenticeships to anyone who was not a member of the Hitler Youth. By 1936, the Hitler Youth had a monopoly on all youth sports facilities in Germany, effectively locking out non-members. Hitler spoke of the regime&#x27;s ability to make Nazis out of these German youth, exclaiming in 1938: 
Over time, a number of boys dropped out due to the regimented nature of the organization. Some of these boys later rejoined after they learned that they could not get a job or enter university without being a member. There were a few members of the Hitler Youth who privately disagreed with Nazi ideologies. For instance, Hans Scholl—the brother of Sophie Scholl and one of the leading figures of the anti-Nazi resistance movement (White Rose)—was also a member of the Hitler Youth.

Despite rare instances of disaffection, overall, the Hitler Youth constituted the single most successful of all the mass movements in the Third Reich.

== Organisation ==
The Hitler Youth was organised into corps under adult leaders, and the general membership of the HJ consisted of boys aged 14 to 18. The Hitler Youth was organised into local cells on a community level. Such cells had weekly meetings at which various Nazi doctrines were taught by adult leaders. Regional leaders typically organised rallies and field exercises in which several dozen Hitler Youth cells would participate. The largest gathering usually took place annually at Nuremberg, where members from all over Germany would converge for the annual Nazi Party rally. Since the HJ and BDM were considered fully Aryan organizations by Nazi officials, premarital sex was encouraged in their ranks. This did not conform to the general beliefs of the Nazi Party, which viewed premarital sex as undesirable and a potential public health hazard.

The Hitler Youth maintained training academies comparable to preparatory schools, which were designed to nurture future Nazi Party leaders. The Hitler Youth also maintained several corps designed to develop future officers for the Wehrmacht (Armed Forces). The corps offered specialised foundational training for each of the specific arms for which the member was ultimately destined. The Marine Hitler Youth (Marine-HJ), for example, served as an auxiliary to the . Another branch of the Hitler Youth was the (German Worker Youth – HY). This organisation within the Hitler Youth was a training ground for future labour leaders and technicians. Its symbol was a rising sun with a swastika. A program entitled (Country Service Camp) was designed to teach specifically chosen girls of the BDM high moral character standards within a rural educational setting.

The Hitler Youth had a number of monthly and weekly publications: among them were the (Hitler Youth Newspaper), the (Storm Youth), (Young Front), (News for German Youth), and (Will and Power). Other publications included (Young Germany), (a paper for girls in the BdM), and (Young Villager).

== Doctrine ==
The members of the Hitler Youth were viewed as ensuring the future of Nazi Germany and they were indoctrinated in Nazi ideology, including racism. The boys were indoctrinated with the myths of Aryan racial superiority and to view Jews and Slavs as subhumans. Members were taught to associate state-identified enemies such as Jews with Germany&#x27;s previous defeat in the First World War and societal decline. The Hitler Youth were used to break up church youth groups, spy on religious classes and Bible studies, and interfere with church attendance. Education and training programs for the Hitler Youth were designed to undermine the values of traditional structures of German society. Their training also aimed to remove social and intellectual distinctions between classes, to be replaced and dominated by the political goals of Hitler&#x27;s totalitarian dictatorship. Sacrifice for the Nazi cause was instilled into their training. As historian Richard Evans observes, &quot;The songs they sang were Nazi songs. The books they read were Nazi books.&quot; Former Hitler Youth Franz Jagemann said that the notion &quot;Germany must live&quot; even if the members of the HJ had to die, was &quot;hammered&quot; into them. 

The Hitler Youth appropriated many of the activities of the Boy Scout movement (which was banned in 1935), including camping and hiking. However, over time it changed in content and intention. For example, many activities closely resembled military training, with weapons familiarization, assault course circuits, and basic fighting tactics. The aim was to turn the HJ into motivated soldiers. There was greater emphasis on physical ability and military training than on academic study. More than just a way to keep the German nation healthy, sports became a means of indoctrinating and training its youth for combat; this was in keeping with tenets outlined in Hitler&#x27;s notorious work, . In a 1936 edition of &quot;Foreign Affairs,&quot; an article discussing the appropriation of sports by contemporary dictatorial regimes such as Nazi Germany, commented that: By 1937, there was a HJ rifle school established, partially at the behest of General Erwin Rommel, who toured HJ meetings and lectured on &quot;German soldiering&quot;, all the while he pressured Schirach to turn the HJ into a &quot;junior army&quot;. During 1938, some 1.5 million HJ members were trained to shoot rifles. Starting in early 1939, the OKW began supervising HJ shooting activities and military field exercises. Upwards of 51,500 boys had earned their HJ Marksmanship Medal before the year&#x27;s end.

== World War II ==

On 15 August 1939, a fortnight before the beginning of World War II, Schirach agreed with General Wilhelm Keitel that the entire Hitler Youth leadership must have &quot;defence training&quot;.

On 1 May 1940, Artur Axmann was appointed deputy to Schirach, whom he succeeded as of the Hitler Youth on 8 August 1940. Axmann began to reform the group into an auxiliary force which could perform war duties. The Hitler Youth became active in German fire brigades and assisted with recovery efforts to German cities affected by Allied bombing. The Hitler Youth also assisted in such organisations as the Reich postal service, the Reich railway services, and other government offices; members of the HJ also aided the army and served with anti-aircraft defence crews.

In 1942 Hitler decreed the establishment of &quot;Hitler Youth defence training camps&quot;, led by Wehrmacht officers. Nazi leaders began turning the Hitler Youth into a military reserve to replace manpower which had been depleted due to tremendous military losses. The idea for a Waffen-SS division made up of Hitler Youth members was first proposed by Axmann to Heinrich Himmler in early 1943. The plan for a combat division made up of Hitler Youth members born in 1926 was passed on to Hitler for his approval. Hitler approved the plan in February and Gottlob Berger was tasked with recruiting. Fritz Witt of SS Division Leibstandarte (LSSAH) was appointed divisional commander.

In 1944, the 12th SS-Panzer-Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; was deployed during the Battle of Normandy against the British and Canadian forces to the north of Caen. Over 20,000 German youths participated in the attempt to repulse the D-Day invasion; while they knocked out 28 Canadian tanks during their first effort, they ultimately lost 3,000 lives before the Normandy assault was complete. During the following months, the division earned a reputation for ferocity and fanaticism. When Witt was killed by Allied naval gunfire, SS- Kurt Meyer assumed command and became the divisional commander at age 33.

As German casualties escalated with the combination of Operation Bagration and the Lvov-Sandomierz Operation in the east, and Operation Cobra in the west, members of the Hitlerjugend were recruited at ever younger ages. By 1945, the was commonly drafting 12-year-old Hitler Youth members into its ranks. During the Battle of Berlin, Axmann&#x27;s Hitler Youth formed a major part of the last line of German defence, and they were reportedly among the fiercest fighters. Although the city commander, General Helmuth Weidling, ordered Axmann to disband the Hitler Youth combat formations, in the confusion this order was never carried out. The remnants of the youth brigade took heavy casualties from the advancing Russian forces. Only two survived.

In 1945, there were various incidents of Hitler Youth members shooting prisoners, participating in executions, and committing other wartime atrocities.

== Post-World War II ==

The Hitler Youth was disbanded by Allied authorities as part of the denazification process. Some Hitler Youth members were suspected of war crimes but, because they were children, no serious efforts were made to prosecute these claims. While the Hitler Youth was never declared a criminal organisation, its adult leadership was considered tainted for corrupting the minds of young Germans. Many adult leaders of the Hitler Youth were put on trial by Allied authorities, and Baldur von Schirach was sentenced to 20 years in prison. However, he was convicted of crimes against humanity for his actions as of Vienna, not for his leadership of the Hitler Youth, because Artur Axmann had been serving as the functioning leader of the Hitler Youth from 1940 onward. Axmann only received a 39-month prison sentence in May 1949, but he was not found guilty of war crimes. Later, in 1958, a West Berlin court fined Axman 35,000 marks (approximately £3,000, or US$8,300), about half the value of his property in Berlin. The court found him guilty of indoctrinating German youth with National Socialism until the end of the war, but concluded that he was not guilty of war crimes.

German children born in the 1920s and 1930s became adults during the Cold War years. Since membership was compulsory after 1936, it was neither surprising nor uncommon that many senior leaders of both West and East Germany had been members of the Hitler Youth. Little effort was made to blacklist political figures who had been members, since many had little choice in the matter. These German post-war leaders were nonetheless once part of an important institutional element of Nazi Germany. Historian Gerhard Rempel opined that Nazi Germany itself was impossible to conceive without the Hitler Youth, as their members constituted the &quot;social, political, and military resiliency of the Third Reich&quot; and were part of &quot;the incubator that maintained the political system by replenishing the ranks of the dominant party and preventing the growth of mass opposition.&quot; Rempel also reports that a large percentage of the boys who served in the HJ slowly came to the realization that &quot;they had worked and slaved for a criminal cause&quot;, which they carried for a lifetime. Some of them recalled a &quot;loss of freedom&quot; and claimed that their time in the HJ &quot;had robbed them of a normal childhood.&quot; Historian Michael Kater relates how many who once served in the HJ were silent until older age when they became grandparents. While they were eventually able to look back at their place in &quot;a dictatorship which oppressed, maimed, and killed millions&quot;, he maintains that an honest appraisal should lead them to conclude that their past contributions to the regime had &quot;damaged their own souls.&quot;

Once Nazi Germany was defeated by the Allied Powers, the Hitler Youth—like all NSDAP organisations—was officially abolished by the Allied Control Council on 10 October 1945 and later banned by the German Criminal Code.

==Ranks and uniforms==
 (Reich Youth Leader) was the highest rank of the Hitler Youth and was held by the Nazi Party official in command of the entire organization. The rank of was only held by two people during its existence, first by Baldur von Schirach and later by Artur Axmann.

Members&#x27; summer uniform consisted of black shorts and a tan shirt with pockets, worn with a rolled black neckerchief secured with a woggle, usually tucked under the collar. Headgear originally consisted of a beret, but this was discarded by the HJ in 1934. One flag/symbol used by the HJ was the same as the DJ, a white &quot;Sowilo&quot; rune on a black background, which symbolised &quot;victory&quot;. Another flag used was a red–white–red striped flag with a black swastika in the middle, inside a white shaped diamond. Full members would also receive a knife upon enrollment, with the motto &quot;Blut und Ehre&quot; (Blood and Honour) engraved upon it.

<text>Valais ( , ; ), more formally, the Canton of Valais, is one of the 26 cantons forming the Swiss Confederation. It is composed of thirteen districts and its capital and largest city is Sion.

Valais is situated in the southwestern part of the country. It borders the cantons of Vaud and Bern to the north, the cantons of Uri and Ticino to the east, as well as Italy to the south and France to the west. It is one of the three large southern Alpine cantons, along with Ticino and the Grisons, which encompass a vast diversity of ecosystems. It is a bilingual canton, French and German being its two official languages. Traditionally, the canton is divided into Lower, Central, and Upper Valais, the latter region constituting the German-speaking minority.

Valais is essentially coextensive with the valley of the Rhône from its headwaters to Lake Geneva, separating the Pennine Alps from the Bernese Alps, the two largest mountain ranges of the canton. A major wine region, the canton is simultaneously one of the driest regions of Switzerland in its central Rhône valley and among the wettest, having large amounts of snow and rain upon the highest peaks found in Switzerland, such as Monte Rosa and the Finsteraarhorn. Although a major hydroelectricity producer, Valais is essentially renowned for its tourism industry and its numerous Alpine resort towns, notably Crans-Montana, Saas Fee, Verbier, and Zermatt. Overlooking the latter town, the Matterhorn has become an iconic landmark of the canton.

In 1529, Valais became an associate member of the Swiss Confederation. After having resisted the Protestant Reformation and remained faithful to the Roman Catholic Church, it became a republic under the guidance of the prince-bishop of Sion in 1628. In 1815, Valais finally entered the Swiss Confederation as a canton. In 1878, the Simplon Railway connected most of Valais with the cities of the Swiss Plateau. The canton was further opened up by the Lötschberg Railway in 1913.

==Name==
The canton is also officially referred to by its long name &quot;République et canton du Valais&quot; (French) or &quot;Republik und Kanton Wallis&quot; (German). This translates into &quot;Republic and Canton of Valais&quot;.

==History==
The Romans called the upper Rhône valley &quot;Vallis Poenina&quot;. The &quot;Vallis Poenina&quot; was conquered by the Romans after the Battle of Octodurus (now known as Martigny) in 57 BC and became part of the Gallo-Roman cultural sphere. According to a tradition that can be traced back to the middle of the 8th century, the Theban legion was martyred at Agaunum (now Saint Maurice) about 285 or 302. From 888 onwards the lands were part of the kingdom of Jurane Burgundy.
Valais formed part of the kingdom of Transjurane Burgundy, which fell to the Holy Roman Empire in 1032. It became part of the duchy of Burgundia Minor, which was held by the emperors by the house of Zähringen (which became extinct in 1218). In 999, King Rudolph III of Burgundy gave all temporal rights and privileges to the Bishop of Sion, who was later styled &quot;praefect and count of Valais&quot; and is still a prince of the Holy Roman Empire. The count-bishops then struggled to defend their area against the Zähringer and then the dukes of Savoy, so that the medieval history of Valais is inextricably linked with that of the diocese of Sion. The Dukes of Savoy, however, succeeded in winning most of the land west of Sion (Lower Valais), while in the upper part of the valley (Upper Valais) there were many feudal lords, such as the lords of Raron, those of La Tour-Châtillon, and the counts of Visp.

About the middle of the 13th century, the large communities (Zenden or tithings) began to develop independence and grow in power. The name &quot;Zenden&quot; or tithings probably came from a very ancient division of the bishop&#x27;s manors for administrative and judicial purposes. In the same century the upper part of the valley was colonized by Germans from Hasli (de) in the Canton of Bern. The locals became German-speaking, though many Romance local names remain. In 1354 the liberties of several of the seven &quot;Zenden&quot; (Sion, Sierre, Leuk, Raron, Visp, Brig and Conches) were confirmed by the Emperor Charles IV.
By the late 14th century, the counts of Savoy acquired the bishopric of Sion. The Zenden resisted his attempts to gather both spiritual and secular power in the valley. In 1375–76, Zenden forces defeated the army of the house of La Tour-Chatillon, and in 1388 routed the forces of the bishop, the count, and his nobles at Visp. The German-speaking Zenden spread further into the valley. Starting in 1384 the Morge stream (a little below Sion) was recognized as the boundary between Savoyard, French-speaking Lower Valais and German-speaking episcopal Upper Valais.

During the Raron affair rebellion from 1414 to 1420, some cantons of the Swiss Confederation took sides in the conflict. Lucerne, Uri and Unterwalden supported the Upper Valais rebels, while Bern supported the noble Raron family. The uprising was successful in driving out the Rarons and almost brought the Confederation to civil war.

Following the Raron affair, the canton was the location of the Valais witch trials between 1428 and 1447 in which at least 367 men and women were put to death. This event marks one of the earliest witch scares in late medieval Europe. The phenomenon later spread to other parts of the continent.

With the election of Walther II. Supersaxo von der Fluhe (from Conches) as bishop in 1457, the German-speaking part of the valley finally attained supremacy. At the outbreak of the Burgundian Wars in 1475, the bishop of Sion and the Zenden made a treaty with Bern. In November of the same year, they seized all Lower or Savoyard Valais up to Martigny. In March 1476, after the victory of Grandson, they advanced and captured St Maurice, Évian, Thonon and Monthey. They had to give up the last three districts in 1477 but won them again in 1536. In the treaty of Thonon in 1569, Monthey, Val-d&#x27;llliez, and Le Bouveret were permanently annexed to Valais. These conquered districts in the Lower Valais were ruled as subject lands by the bishop and the Tithings of the Upper Valais until 1798. On 12 March 1529, Valais became an associate member (&quot;Zugewandter Ort&quot;) of the Swiss Confederation.

In the early 17th century, the aristocratic governors of the districts in the Upper Valais pressured the prince-bishop of Sion to abdicate secular power, which was achieved temporarily in 1613 and then permanently in 1634, when the country became the federal Republic of the Seven Tithings under the rule of a &quot;Landeshauptmann&quot;. The republic in its original form existed until 1798, when the districts of the Lower Valais, until then ruled as subjects, successfully revolted against the Seven Tithings and achieved equal status within the republic. During the French invasion of the Swiss Confederacy in the same year, Valais was incorporated into the Helvetic Republic until 1802 when it became the separate Rhodanic Republic.

In 1810, the Rhodanic Republic was annexed by the First French Empire as the departement of Simplon. The department was occupied by Austrian troops in late 1813; on 4 August 1815, Valais finally entered the Swiss Confederation as a canton. In 1845, Valais joined the Catholic separatist league (&quot;Sonderbund&quot;) which led to what is called the Sonderbund War. Under General Henri Dufour, 99,000 Swiss Federal troops were faced by 79,000 Separatists, but in the end, Valais chose not to fight.

The beginning of the modern history of Valais essentially coincides with the exploration of the High Alps, the first ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865 marking the end of the golden age of alpinism. The boom of tourism followed in the late 19th century. In 1878, the Simplon Railway connected Brig, the last town before the Simplon Pass, from Lausanne and Geneva and other major cities of the Swiss Plateau.

==Geography==
Valais is the third largest canton of Switzerland by area. It is also one of its westernmost and southernmost cantons while being adjacent to central Switzerland. With a few exceptions, it lies almost entirely in the Rhône basin, more precisely in the wide Alpine Rhône Valley, above Lake Geneva. The main settlements are all along the Rhône or in its proximity, the largest city being Sion, followed by Martigny, Monthey, Sierre, and Brig-Glis. The canton is traditionally divided into three regions: Lower Valais (French: &quot;Bas-Valais&quot;), Central Valais (French: &quot;Valais central&quot;), and Upper Valais (German: &quot;Oberwallis&quot;), with the linguistic border of the canton being at Pfynwald, between the two latter regions. While the more populous Lower and Central Valais are French-speaking, Upper Valais is German-speaking.

The Rhône Valley is a central Alpine valley, i.e. it lies well within the Alps and is shut off from both northern and southern plains. Valais is separated from the Swiss Plateau to the north by the Bernese Alps and from the Po plains to the south by the Valais Alps, respectively north and south of the Rhône. Valais is also one of the three large southern cantons lying partially in the Po basin, therefore south of the Alps, along with Ticino and the Grisons. However, contrary to those two cantons, very few settlements are on the south side of the Alps, and they are all well above the plains. The largest regions not drained by the Rhône are the Simplon Valley (Po basin) and two uninhabited areas north of the Sanetsch and the Gemmi Pass (Rhine basin).
Valais is the highest canton in terms of absolute, relative, and mean elevation. Therefore, its topography is extremely rugged, with the notable exception of the wide, glacial, Rhône valley. The latter valley dominates the geography of the canton. Many side valleys are branching off the main valley, often perpendicularly. These vary from narrow and remote to reasonably populous. On the south side of the Rhône, in the Valais Alps, some of the largest side valleys are (from east to west): the Mattertal (including the Saastal), the Val d&#x27;Anniviers, the Val d&#x27;Hérens, the Val de Bagnes and the Val d&#x27;Entremont. On the north of the Rhône, in the Bernese Alps, the Lötschental is the only large valley. East of Brig is the valley of Goms, the highest section of the Rhône Valley. The Rhône itself flows in the main valley from east to west from the Rhône Glacier down to Martigny, then at a right angle north to its mouth in Lake Geneva. After the town of Saint-Maurice, the eastern banks of the river belong to the canton of Vaud, although the western banks remain in Valais, down to Le Bouveret, on the shores of Lake Geneva. The main valley is bounded by the Bernese Alps in the north and the Valais Alps in the south, both ranges including numerous over 4,000 metre-high mountains, which are the highest in the country. Notables mountains include Monte Rosa (highest), reaching , and the Finsteraarhorn (most prominent), reaching . Other iconic mountains are the Matterhorn and the Jungfrau, for a complete list, see list of mountains of Valais. Located there are numerous glaciers including several of the largest in the Alps, such as the Aletsch Glacier and the Gorner Glacier. Other ranges situated partially in Valais are the Chablais Alps, the Mont Blanc Massif, the Uri Alps, the Gotthard Massif, and the Lepontine Alps.

Lake Geneva is the only truly large lake in the canton, although only a small fraction of it (about 10  km2) is in Valais, the plain of the Rhône comprehending only small lakes. There are however numerous sizable lakes in the high Alps, mostly artificial. The largest is Lac des Dix, closely followed by the Lac d&#x27;Emosson. Other large high-elevation lakes are Lac de Mauvoisin, Mattmarksee, lac de Salanfe, Lac de Moiry and Lac de Tseuzier (see list of mountain lakes of Switzerland for a more complete list). All these lakes are used for hydroelectricity production, but they are also popular for their scenic views over the Alps.
Due to the high mountains surrounding the plains of the Rhône, the climate of central Valais is particularly dry, much drier than in the rest of Switzerland. While locations at high elevations are highly exposed to rainfall and snowfall, average rainfall per year is only about 600  mm in Sion, corresponding to 50% of that of Lucerne (north of the Alps) and 30% of that of Locarno (south of the Alps). Officially, the driest location in Valais and Switzerland is Stalden, with 545  mm of rainfall per year. Valais is often described as &quot;semi-arid&quot;, although it is not in the climatic sense of the term. Therefore, in some areas, such as Les Follatères, are found plants that are uncommon or absent in the rest of Switzerland, such as cactuses. On the lower south-facing slopes of the Bernese Alps, numerous vineyards are cultivated, between Fully and Leuk. Unlike in the rest of the country, irrigated agriculture is common in Valais.

The canton is renowned for its numerous towns and villages in the high Alps. In the Mattertal and adjoining Saastal are Zermatt and Saas Fee. Other popular resorts are Verbier, Les Marécottes, Champéry, Grimentz, Zinal, Anzère, Crans-Montana, Evolène, Leukerbad and Fiesch. All of them are tourist destination in both summer and winter seasons.

The area of the canton is and only about half of the total area is considered productive. Valais shares borders with four other cantons: to the north are the cantons of Vaud and Bern and to the east are the cantons of Uri and Ticino. The canton shares international borders as well: to the south are the Italian regions of Aosta Valley and Piedmont and to the west is the French region of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes.

==Economy==
=== Primary sector ===

Wines and fruit brandies, such as Poire Williams, are some of the main production of the canton. This form of agriculture is often irrigated through the use of small open-air wooden canals, called &quot;bisses&quot; in French and &quot;Suonen&quot; in German, that transport water from the glaciers above. They also constitute popular hiking routes because of their low declivity. Vineyards are grown on terraces, typically on the south-facing slopes overlooking the Rhône Valley, where they have become an integral part of the landscape. The wine industry of the canton is the largest in Switzerland. There are also a large number orchards in the area, among which are apricot trees. The apricot has become the emblematic fruit of the canton. In Mund, saffron is also gathered.

Agriculture in Valais also consists of cattle breeding in the mountains and dairy farming in the plains. The canton is notable for its cheese and dried meat production. The Hérens cattle are also used in organised cow fights.

=== Secondary sector ===

Europe&#x27;s tallest gravity dam is located at Grande Dixence in the canton, closely followed by the Mauvoisin Dam. Hydroelectric power plants from the canton produce about a quarter of Swiss electricity.

The west part and the most industrial region of the canton is called Chablais. The area is very important for the economy. The lands from Lake Geneva to the town of St-Maurice are located in the Chablais. There are a lot of factories, the most important are the subsidiaries of Novartis and Syngenta, in Monthey. In the town of Collombey-Muraz, there is an oil refinery.

The Lonza Group has large factories in Visp. Near Visp there is a large aluminium processing plant. Other metal products and chemicals are produced around Visp and Sierre, including Swiss Diamond International aluminum cookware.

=== Tertiary sector ===
Valais has a long touristic tradition. Hoteliers were at the base of the development of Valais Tourism. Many of them, such as César Ritz, spent time and money to satisfy a clientele from around the world. The canton is nowadays a year-round destination, renowned for its wild landscapes and numerous tourist facilities. In winter, skiing and other snow-related sports are the most popular activities. In summer, hiking and trekking are particularly popular. Climbing and mountaineering can be practised year-round, with the highest mountains of western Europe surrounding Valais. Many of the huts owned by the Swiss Alpine Club are located in the canton.

Valais counts more than 120 winter and summer destinations, including:

* Goms (district): Fiesch-Eggishorn, Bellwald, Binn, Ernen, Obergoms, Oberwald 
* Aletsch (UNESCO World Heritage): Bettmeralp, Fiescheralp, Riederalp 
* Brig-Glis and surrounding area: Blatten, Belalp, Mund, Termen, Birgisch

* St. Bernard Region: Les Marécottes, Bruson, La Fouly, Champex, Vichères-Liddes

The Matterhorn near Zermatt is one of the biggest tourist attractions in the Swiss mountains, as is its sister valley immediately east Saas Fee. Other parts of the mountains of the canton further west are popular as well, such as the more French-speaking resorts near Verbier and the Evolene and Arolla region. The resorts on the north side of the main Rhône valley are popular, looking out southwards towards the Peninne Alps and still part of the southern slope of the Bernese Alps, such as the family-oriented resort of Crans-Montana. The resorts in the Goms (district) are slightly less known, yet also receive attention during the summer hiking season and the winter ski season.

==Transport==

The only natural low-elevation access to Valais is via the banks of Lake Geneva, which have several railways and highways leading towards Martigny, Sion, and the rest of the canton. The major axis is on the north side of the lake and passes via Lausanne and Vevey in the canton of Vaud. From there runs the A9 motorway and the Simplon Railway, ultimately leading to Italy via the Simplon Pass and Simplon Tunnel respectively. On the south side of Lake Geneva, from the French border, is only a highway and the historical Tonkin Railway, now operating in Valais only.

The canton is surrounded by high mountains, but some major mountain passes connect it with the rest of Europe. The main road passes are the Grimsel (towards the canton of Bern and the Swiss Plateau), the Furka (Uri), the Nufenen (Ticino), the Simplon and the Great St. Bernard (Italy), and the Forclaz and the Morgins (France). Also notable are the historical and pedestrian passes of the Sanetsch, Rawil, Gemmi, and the Lötschberg, connecting Valais with the Swiss Plateau, through the Bernese Oberland.
The Lötschberg, together with the Simplon, is one of the main north–south axes of Switzerland. The historical Lötschberg Railway opened in 1913. It connects directly Brig to the Swiss Plateau across the Bernese Alps, via Spiez in the canton of Bern, through the high-elevation Lötschberg Tunnel. In 2007, the importance of that axis was further increased with the opening of the low-elevation Lötschberg Base Tunnel, the first high-speed railway connecting Valais to Bern, following essentially the same route, but at the level of the plains. The Lötschberg Base Tunnel was the longest land tunnel in the world when opened, finally opening up Valais to northern Switzerland. The summit railway, through the historical tunnel, is still used for regional traffic and car transportation across the Lötschberg. The old train line is popular for its highly scenic sections in both cantons on either side of the old tunnel.

Another railway axis connects Valais with central and eastern Switzerland. This is a metre-gauge railway owned by the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn, which ultimately leads to Disentis and Chur, from Zermatt via Visp and Brig. The main railway goes through the Furka Base Tunnel in the extreme east of the canton, with the older Furka Summit Tunnel being popular for its highly scenic sections as well. The Glacier Express directly connects Zermatt with St. Moritz, using both Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn and Rhaetian Railway network.
The canton comprehends a road network, with elevations ranging from that of Lake Geneva at Le Bouveret to that of the Nufenen Pass, the highest paved road in Valais. The A9, the only motorway, serves the valley up to Sierre, the extension towards Brig being currently under construction. All inhabited side valleys are accessible to motorized transport since the 1960s; the high-elevation reservoirs built during those years, notably the Grande Dixence, necessitating paved roads as well. As in most other cantons, localities are essentially served by PostBus Switzerland, which also operates numerous tourist lines on the Alpine passes and to the high-elevation lakes. Martigny, Sion, Sierre and Brig are hubs of public transportation. The winding mountain roads of Valais are very popular with drivers, bikers, and cyclists for their spectacular scenery and are the highlights of competitions such as Tour de Suisse and the Rallye International du Valais. For a list of high-elevation paved roads, see list of highest paved roads in Switzerland.

Because of tourism, there are many railways and cable cars in the mountains. Railways serving side valleys are the Aigle–Ollon–Monthey–Champéry railway, the Martigny–Orsières Railway (notably serving Verbier), the Martigny–Châtelard Railway (serving the Trient Valley) and the Visp-Zermatt railway. Above Zermatt, the Gornergrat Railway and the Klein Matterhorn cable car are respectively the highest open-air railway and highest public transport in Europe.

The Valais has two ports on Lake Geneva served by the CGN: St. Gingolph and Le Bouveret. The largest airport is located at Sion.

==Culture==
The size and particular geographical situation of the canton within the Alps helped Valais develop a culture that is distinct from that of the cantons of the Swiss Plateau and the northern Alpine foothills. As a bilingual canton, Valais itself includes some cultural diversity as well. The most common denominator is a strong mountain culture, symbolized by the archetypal tenacious and austere mountain dweller facing the difficult conditions and dangers of nature.

===Monuments===

Many monuments dot the Valais landscape. The best known are the Valère Basilica, where the oldest organ in the world still playable is found, and the territorial Abbey of Saint-Maurice, which dates from the 6th century. Valais has several castles of historical importance, frequently built in formerly strategic locations: Tourbillon Castle, Saint-Maurice Castle, Stockalper Palace, La Bâtiaz Castle, Majorie Castle, the episcopal Leuk Castle etc. Amongst religious buildings are several churches that present quality architecture, in particular, those due to the architect Ulrich Ruffiner (16th century) who left many buildings between Sion and the Goms valley: Saint-Théodule church in Sion, the church of Raron and church of Ernen. In the valley of Goms, are also several notable baroque churches. Contemporary religious architecture has also given rise to interesting buildings, such as the works of the Genevan architect Jean-Marie Ellenberger (1913-1988) in Sierre (Sainte-Croix church) or Verbier.

In the civil architecture, two hospices, each located at one of the passes leading to Italy, formerly provided food for pilgrims who went to Rome and travelers in general: the Great St. Bernard Hospice and the Simplon Hospice. There are also interesting Roman remains, such as the amphitheater in Martigny. Sion is also a major site of European prehistory. In particular, are the dolmens of Le Petit-Chasseur, a group of large collective burials dating back to the 3rd millennium BC. Bridges are also an important element of the Valais-built landscape. Due to its mountainous terrain which requires crossing many natural obstacles, the canton has several bridges, old or modern, often daring, including the Gueuroz Bridge which was once the highest bridge in Europe, and the Ganter Bridge, on the Simplon road.

Visible from central Valais, the statue of Christ the King in Lens recalls the Catholic tradition of the canton.

Among the most important museums in the canton, the Gianadda Foundation in Martigny attracts many visitors from all over Switzerland and neighboring countries. The canton also owns several large museums in Sion, the Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts, the Cantonal History Museum, and the Cantonal Museum of Natural History. Other museums owned by the canton are the Vine and Wine Museum in Salgesch and the Museum of Traditions and Boats of Lake Geneva in St. Gingolph.

===Gastronomy===

Traditional food products of Valais are wines, cheeses, dried meat, and rye bread. Wines are essentially produced in the Rhone Valley, but also in the lateral valleys, up to Visperterminen, which has the highest vineyards in the canton. Wines are typically white. Some of the most popular are Fendant, Petite Arvine, Humagne Blanche, Syrah and Pinot Noir. The numerous cheeses notably include raclette, which is both a variety of cheese and a dish. Along with fondue, the latter has become an emblematic dish associated with mountain culture. Other dishes of Valais include the Cholera, a pastry containing various ingredients, and the , a simple dish consisting of roasted chestnuts eaten along with various local cheeses and charcuterie. The latter is often served in autumn near the chestnut groves of the canton.

<text>Bad Dürkheim () is a district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the districts of Kaiserslautern, Donnersbergkreis and Alzey-Worms, the city of Worms, the Rhein-Pfalz-Kreis, the city of Neustadt/Weinstraße, the districts of Südliche Weinstraße, the city of Landau (the Taubensuhl/Fassendeich forest part of the city), the district Südwestpfalz, and the city of Kaiserslautern.

== History ==

The eastern rim of the Palatinate forest has been densely populated since the Middle Ages. Several medieval castles show the significance of the region during the early Holy Roman Empire.

The district was established in 1969 by combining portions of the former districts of Neustadt and Frankenthal.

=== Dialect ===

The dialect of Bad Dürkheim and environs is closer to the Pennsylvania Dutch language—also known as Pennsylvania German or as Deitsch, the native tongue of the Amish and others—than any other dialect of German.

== Geography ==

The district is located on the eastern rim of the Palatinate Forest a line of hills called the Haardt. The German Wine Road (&quot;Deutsche Weinstraße&quot;), a scenic road along the best vineyards of the Palatinate wine region, runs through the district from north to south. The district is sometimes called &quot;the heart of the Palatinate&quot;.

The best wine-growing area is the &quot;Mittelhaardt&quot; (&quot;Middle Haardt&quot;), where the Riesling wine is cultivated, which is considered to be one of the best German wines.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms displays:
* The heraldic lion of the Palatinate
* Grapes symbolising the Wine Road and the vineyards
* The heraldic eagle of the former county of Leiningen

== Towns and municipalities ==

<doc id="198796" wikidata="Q178275" url="?curid=198796" title="Spanish flu">
<text>The 1918–1920 flu pandemic, also known as the Great Influenza epidemic or by the common misnomer Spanish flu, was an exceptionally deadly global influenza pandemic caused by the H1N1 subtype of the influenza A virus. The earliest documented case was March 1918 in the state of Kansas in the United States, with further cases recorded in France, Germany and the United Kingdom in April. Two years later, nearly a third of the global population, or an estimated 500 million people, had been infected in four successive waves. Estimates of deaths range from 17 million to 50 million, and possibly as high as 100 million, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.

The pandemic broke out near the end of World War I, when wartime censors in the belligerent countries suppressed bad news to maintain morale, but newspapers freely reported the outbreak in neutral Spain, creating a false impression of Spain as the epicenter and leading to the &quot;Spanish flu&quot; misnomer. Limited historical epidemiological data make the pandemic&#x27;s geographic origin indeterminate, with competing hypotheses on the initial spread.

Most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill the young and old, with a higher survival rate in-between, but this pandemic had unusually high mortality for young adults. Scientists offer several explanations for the high mortality, including a six-year climate anomaly affecting migration of disease vectors with increased likelihood of spread through bodies of water. However, the claim that young adults had a high mortality during the pandemic has been contested. Malnourishment, overcrowded medical camps and hospitals, and poor hygiene, exacerbated by the war, promoted bacterial superinfection, killing most of the victims after a typically prolonged death bed.

The 1918 Spanish flu was the first of three flu pandemics caused by H1N1 influenza A virus; the others being the 1977 Russian flu and the 2009 Swine flu pandemics.

==Etymologies==
This pandemic was known by many different names—some old, some new—depending on place, time, and context. The etymology of alternative names historicises the scourge and its effects on people who would only learn years later that invisible viruses caused influenza. The lack of scientific answers led the &quot;Sierra Leone Weekly News&quot; (Freetown) to suggest a biblical framing in July 1918, using an interrogative from Exodus 16 in ancient Hebrew: &quot;One thing is for certain—the doctors are at present flabbergasted; and we suggest that rather than calling the disease influenza they should for the present until they have it in hand, say —&#x27;What is it?&#x27;&quot;

===Descriptive names===
Outbreaks of influenza-like illness were documented in 1916–17 at British military hospitals in Étaples, France, and just across the English Channel at Aldershot, England. Clinical indications in common with the 1918 pandemic included rapid symptom progression to a &quot;dusky&quot; heliotrope cyanosis of the face. This characteristic blue-violet cyanosis in expiring patients led to the name &#x27;purple death&#x27;.

The Aldershot physicians later wrote in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, &quot;the influenza pneumococcal purulent bronchitis we and others described in 1916 and 1917 is fundamentally the same condition as the influenza of this present pandemic.&quot; This &quot;purulent bronchitis&quot; is not yet linked to the same A/H1N1 virus, but it may be a precursor.

In 1918, &#x27;epidemic influenza&#x27; (, influence), also known at the time as &#x27;the grip&#x27; (, grasp), appeared in Kansas in the U.S. during late spring, and early reports from Spain began appearing on 21 May. Reports from both places called it &#x27;three-day fever&#x27; ().

===Associative names===

Many alternative names are exonyms in the practice of making new infectious diseases seem foreign. This pattern was observed even before the 1889–1890 pandemic, also known as the &#x27;Russian flu&#x27;, when the Russians already called epidemic influenza the &#x27;Chinese catarrh&#x27;, the Germans called it the &#x27;Russian pest&#x27;, while the Italians in turn called it the &#x27;German disease&#x27;. These epithets were re-used in the 1918 pandemic, along with new ones.

====&#x27;Spanish&#x27; influenza====

Outside Spain, the disease was soon misnamed &#x27;Spanish influenza&#x27;. In a 2 June 1918 &quot;The Times&quot; of London dispatch titled, &quot;The Spanish Epidemic,&quot; a correspondent in Madrid reported over 100,000 victims of, &quot;The unknown disease…clearly of a gripal character,&quot; without referring to &quot;Spanish influenza&quot; directly. Three weeks later &quot;The Times&quot; reported that, &quot;Everybody thinks of it as the &#x27;Spanish&#x27; influenza to-day.&quot; Three days after that an advertisement appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; for Formamint tablets to prevent &quot;Spanish influenza&quot;. When it reached Moscow, &quot;Pravda&quot; announced, &quot; (the Spanish lady) is in town,&quot; making &#x27;the Spanish lady&#x27; another common name.

The outbreak did not originate in Spain (see below), but reporting did, due to wartime censorship in belligerent nations. Spain was a neutral country unconcerned with appearances of combat readiness, and without a wartime propaganda machine to prop up morale; so its newspapers freely reported epidemic effects, including King Alfonso XIII&#x27;s illness, making Spain the apparent locus of the epidemic. The censorship was so effective that Spain&#x27;s health officials were unaware its neighboring countries were similarly affected.

In an October 1918 &quot;Madrid Letter&quot; to the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot;, a Spanish official protested, &quot;we were surprised to learn that the disease was making ravages in other countries, and that people there were calling it the &#x27;Spanish grip&#x27;. And wherefore Spanish? …this epidemic was not born in Spain, and this should be recorded as a historic vindication.&quot; But before this letter could be published, &quot;The Serbian Newspaper&quot; (Corfu) said, &quot;Various countries have been assigning the origin of this imposing guest to each other for quite some time, and at one point in time they agreed to assign its origin to the kind and neutral Spain…&quot;

====Other exonyms====

French press initially used &#x27;American flu&#x27;, but adopted &#x27;Spanish flu&#x27; in lieu of antagonizing an ally. In the spring of 1918, British soldiers called it &#x27;Flanders flu&#x27;, while German soldiers used &quot; (Flemish fever), both after a famous battlefield in Belgium where many soldiers on both sides fell ill. In Senegal it was named &#x27;Brazilian flu&#x27;, and in Brazil, &#x27;German flu&#x27;. In Spain it was also known as the &#x27;French flu&#x27; (), or the &#x27;Naples Soldier&#x27; (), after a popular song from a zarzuela. Spanish flu () is now a common name in Spain, but remains controversial there.

Othering derived from geopolitical borders and social boundaries. In Poland it was the &#x27;Bolshevik disease&#x27;, while the Bolsheviks referred to it as the &#x27;Kirghiz disease&#x27;. Some Africans called it a &#x27;white man&#x27;s sickness&#x27;, but in South Africa, white men also used the ethnophaulism (lit. negro disease). Japan blamed sumo wrestlers for bringing the disease home from a match in Taiwan by calling it &#x27;sumo flu&#x27; (), even though three top wrestlers died there.

World Health Organization &#x27;best practices&#x27; first published in 2015 now aim to prevent social stigma by no longer associating culturally significant names with new diseases, listing &quot;Spanish flu&quot; under &quot;examples to be avoided&quot;. Many authors now eschew calling this the Spanish flu, instead using variations of &#x27;1918–19/20 flu/influenza pandemic&#x27;.

===Local names===
Some language endonyms did not name specific regions or groups of people. Examples specific to this pandemic include: (let enquiries be made concerning it), (the disease of head and coughing and spine), (disease from seeking to make a profit in wartime), (disease which passes through like a bullet), and (disease of the wind).

===Other names===
This outbreak was also commonly known as the &#x27;great influenza epidemic&#x27;, after the &#x27;great war&#x27;, a common name for World War I before World War II. French military doctors originally called it &#x27;disease 11&#x27; (). German doctors downplayed the severity by calling it &#x27;pseudo influenza&#x27; (, false), while in Africa, doctors tried to get patients to take it more seriously by calling it &#x27;influenza vera&#x27; (, true).

A children&#x27;s song from the 1889–90 flu pandemic was shortened and adapted into a skipping-rope rhyme popular in 1918. It is a metaphor for the transmissibility of &#x27;Influenza&#x27;, where that name was clipped to the apheresis &#x27;Enza&#x27;:

==History==
===Timeline===
====First wave of early 1918====

The pandemic is conventionally marked as having begun on 4 March 1918 with the recording of the case of Albert Gitchell, an army cook at Camp Funston in Kansas, United States, despite there having been cases before him. The disease had already been observed away in Haskell County as early as January 1918, prompting local doctor Loring Miner to warn the editors of the U.S. Public Health Service&#x27;s academic journal &quot;Public Health Reports&quot;. Within days of the 4 March first case at Camp Funston, 522 men at the camp had reported sick. By 11 March 1918, the virus had reached Queens, New York. Failure to take preventive measures in March/April was later criticized.

As the U.S. had entered World War I, the disease quickly spread from Camp Funston, a major training ground for troops of the American Expeditionary Forces, to other U.S. Army camps and Europe, becoming an epidemic in the Midwest, East Coast, and French ports by April 1918, and reaching the Western Front by the middle of the month. It then quickly spread to the rest of France, Great Britain, Italy, and Spain and in May reached Wrocław and Odessa. After the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 1918), Germany started releasing Russian prisoners of war, who then brought the disease to their country. It reached North Africa, India, and Japan in May, and soon after had likely gone around the world as there had been recorded cases in Southeast Asia in April. In June an outbreak was reported in China. After reaching Australia in July, the wave started to recede.

The first wave of the flu lasted from the first quarter of 1918 and was relatively mild. Mortality rates were not appreciably above normal; in the United States ~75,000 flu-related deaths were reported in the first six months of 1918, compared to ~63,000 deaths during the same time period in 1915. In Madrid, Spain, fewer than 1,000 people died from influenza between May and June 1918. There were no reported quarantines during the first quarter of 1918. However, the first wave caused a significant disruption in the military operations of World War I, with three-quarters of French troops, half the British forces, and over 900,000 German soldiers sick.

====Deadly second wave of late 1918====
The second wave began in the second half of August 1918, probably spreading to Boston, Massachusetts and Freetown, Sierra Leone, by ships from Brest, where it had likely arrived with American troops or French recruits for naval training. From the Boston Navy Yard and Camp Devens (later renamed Fort Devens), about west of Boston, other U.S. military sites were soon afflicted, as were troops being transported to Europe. Helped by troop movements, it spread over the next two months to all of North America, and then to Central and South America, also reaching Brazil and the Caribbean on ships. In July 1918, the Ottoman Empire saw its first cases in some soldiers. From Freetown, the pandemic continued to spread through West Africa along the coast, rivers, and the colonial railways, and from railheads to more remote communities, while South Africa received it in September on ships bringing back members of the South African Native Labour Corps returning from France. From there it spread around southern Africa and beyond the Zambezi, reaching Ethiopia in November. On 15 September, New York City saw its first fatality from influenza. The Philadelphia Liberty Loans Parade, held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 28 September 1918 to promote government bonds for World War I, resulted in 12,000 deaths after a major outbreak of the illness spread among people who had attended the parade.

From Europe, the second wave swept through Russia in a southwest–northeast diagonal front, as well as being brought to Arkhangelsk by the North Russia intervention, and then spread throughout Asia following the Russian Civil War and the Trans-Siberian railway, reaching Iran (where it spread through the holy city of Mashhad), and then later India in September, as well as China and Japan in October. The celebrations of the Armistice of 11 November 1918 also caused outbreaks in Lima and Nairobi, but by December the wave was mostly over.

The second wave of the 1918 pandemic was much more deadly than the first. The first wave had resembled typical flu epidemics; those most at risk were the sick and elderly, while younger, healthier people recovered easily. October 1918 was the month with the highest fatality rate of the whole pandemic. In the United States, ~292,000 deaths were reported between September–December 1918, compared to ~26,000 during the same time period in 1915. The Netherlands reported over 40,000 deaths from influenza and acute respiratory disease. Bombay reported ~15,000 deaths in a population of 1.1 million. The 1918 flu pandemic in India was especially deadly, with an estimated 12.5–20 million deaths in the last quarter of 1918 alone.

====Third wave of 1919====

Pandemic activity persisted, in general, into 1919 in many places. This persistence in activity is possibly attributable to climate, specifically in the Northern Hemisphere, where it was winter and thus the usual time for influenza activity. The pandemic nonetheless continued into 1919 largely independent of region and climate.

Cases began to rise again in some parts of the United States as early as late November 1918, with the Public Health Service issuing its first report of a &quot;recrudescence of the disease&quot; being felt in &quot;widely scattered localities&quot; in early December. This resurgent activity varied across the country, however, possibly on account of differing restrictions. Michigan, for example, experienced a swift resurgence of influenza that reached its peak in December, possibly as a result of the lifting of the ban on public gatherings. Pandemic interventions, such as bans on public gatherings and the closing of schools, were reimposed in many places in an attempt to suppress the spread.

There was &quot;a very sudden and very marked rise in general death rate&quot; in most cities in January 1919; nearly all experienced &quot;some degree of recrudescence&quot; of the flu in January and February. Significant outbreaks occurred in cities including Los Angeles, New York City, Memphis, Nashville, San Francisco, and St. Louis. By 21 February, with some local variation, influenza activity was reported to have been declining since mid-January in all parts of the country. Following this &quot;first great epidemic period&quot; that had commenced in October 1918, deaths from pneumonia and influenza were &quot;somewhat below average&quot; in the large cities of the United States between May 1919 and January 1920. Nonetheless, nearly 160,000 deaths were attributed to these causes in the first six months of 1919.

It was not until later in the winter and into the spring that a clearer resurgence appeared in Europe. A significant third wave had developed in England and Wales by mid-February, peaking in early March, though it did not fully subside until May. France also experienced a significant wave that peaked in February, alongside the Netherlands. Norway, Finland, and Switzerland saw recrudescences of pandemic activity in March, and Sweden in April.

Much of Spain was affected by &quot;a substantial recrudescent wave&quot; of influenza between January and April 1919. Portugal experienced a resurgence in pandemic activity that lasted from March to September 1919, with the greatest impact being felt on the west coast and in the north of the country; all districts were affected between April and May specifically.

Influenza entered Australia for the first time in January 1919 after a strict maritime quarantine had shielded the country through the latter part of 1918. It assumed epidemic proportions first in Melbourne, peaking in mid-February. The flu soon appeared in neighboring New South Wales and South Australia and then spread across the country throughout the year. New South Wales experienced its first wave of infection between mid-March and late May, while a second, more severe wave occurred in Victoria between April and June.

Land quarantine measures hindered the spread of the disease, resulting in varied experiences of exposures and outbreaks among the various states. Queensland was not infected until late April; Western Australia avoided the disease until early June, and Tasmania remained free from it until mid-August. Out of the six states, Victoria and New South Wales experienced generally more extensive epidemics. Each experienced another significant wave of illness over the winter. The second epidemic in New South Wales was more severe than the first, while Victoria saw a third wave that was somewhat less extensive than its second, more akin to its first.

The disease also reached other parts of the world for the first time in 1919, such as Madagascar, which saw its first cases in April; the outbreak had spread to practically all sections of the island by June. In other parts, influenza recurred in the form of a true &quot;third wave&quot;. Hong Kong experienced another outbreak in June, as did South Africa during its fall and winter months in the Southern Hemisphere. New Zealand also experienced some cases in May.

Parts of South America experienced a resurgence of pandemic activity throughout 1919. A third wave hit Brazil between January and June. Between July 1919 and February 1920, Chile, which had been affected for the first time just in October 1918, experienced a severe second wave, with mortality peaking in August 1919. Montevideo similarly experienced a second outbreak between July and September.

The third wave particularly affected Spain, Serbia, Mexico and Great Britain, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. It was in general less severe than the second wave but still much more deadly than the initial first wave.

====Fourth wave of 1920====

In the Northern Hemisphere, fears of a &quot;recurrence&quot; of the flu grew as fall approached. Experts cited the history of past flu epidemics, such as that of 1889–1890, to predict that such a recurrence a year later was not unlikely, though not all agreed. In September 1919, U.S. Surgeon General Rupert Blue said a return of the flu later in the year would &quot;probably, but by no means certainly,&quot; occur. France had readied a public information campaign before the end of the summer, and Britain began preparations in the autumn with the manufacture of vaccine.

In Japan, the flu broke out again in December and spread rapidly throughout the country, a fact attributed at the time to the coming of cold weather. Pandemic-related measures were renewed to check the spread of the outbreak, and health authorities recommended the use of masks. The epidemic intensified in the latter part of December before swiftly peaking in January.

Between October 1919 and 23 January 1920, 780,000 cases were reported across the country, with at least 20,000 deaths recorded by that date. This apparently reflected &quot;a condition of severity three times greater than for the corresponding period of&quot; 1918–1919, during Japan&#x27;s first epidemic. Nonetheless, the disease was regarded as being milder than it had been the year before, albeit more infectious. Despite its rapid peak at the beginning of the year, the outbreak persisted throughout the winter, before subsiding in the spring.

In the United States, there were &quot;almost continuously isolated or solitary cases&quot; of flu throughout the spring and summer months of 1919. An increase in scattered cases became apparent as early as September, but Chicago experienced one of the first major outbreaks of the flu beginning in the middle of January. The Public Health Service announced it would take steps to &quot;localize the epidemic&quot;, but the disease was already causing a simultaneous outbreak in Kansas City and quickly spread outward from the center of the country in no clear direction. A few days after its first announcement, PHS issued another assuring that the disease was under the control of state health authorities and that an outbreak of epidemic proportions was not expected.

It became apparent within days of the start of Chicago&#x27;s explosive growth in cases that the flu was spreading in the city at an even faster rate than in winter 1919, though fewer were dying. Within a week, new cases in the city had surpassed its peak during the 1919 wave. Around the same time, New York City began to see its own sudden increase in cases, and other cities around the country were soon to follow. Certain pandemic restrictions, such as the closing of schools and theaters and the staggering of business hours to avoid congestion, were reimposed in cities like Chicago, Memphis, and New York City. As they had during the epidemic in fall 1918, schools in New York City remained open, while those in Memphis were shuttered as part of more general restrictions on public gatherings.
The fourth wave in the United States subsided as swiftly as it had appeared, reaching a peak in early February. &quot;An epidemic of considerable proportions marked the early months of 1920&quot;, the U.S. Mortality Statistics would later note; according to data at this time, the epidemic resulted in one third as many deaths as the 1918–1919 experience. New York City alone reported 6,374 deaths between December 1919 and April 1920, almost twice the number of the first wave in spring 1918. Other U.S. cities including Detroit, Milwaukee, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and St. Louis were hit particularly hard, with death rates higher than all of 1918. The Territory of Hawaii experienced its peak of the pandemic in early 1920, recording 1,489 deaths from flu-related causes, compared with 615 in 1918 and 796 in 1919.

Poland experienced a devastating outbreak during the winter months, with its capital Warsaw reaching a peak of 158 deaths in a single week, compared to the peak of 92 reached in December 1918; however, the 1920 epidemic passed in a matter of weeks, while the 1918–1919 wave had developed over the entire second half of 1918. By contrast, the outbreak in western Europe was considered &quot;benign&quot;, with the age distribution of deaths beginning to take on that of seasonal flu. Five countries in Europe (Spain, Denmark, Finland, Germany and Switzerland) recorded a late peak between January–April 1920.

Mexico experienced a fourth wave between February and March. In South America, Peru experienced &quot;asynchronous recrudescent waves&quot; throughout the year. A severe third wave hit Lima, the capital city, between January and March, resulting in an all-cause excess mortality rate approximately four times greater than that of the 1918–1919 wave. Ica similarly experienced another severe pandemic wave in 1920, between July and October. A fourth wave also occurred in Brazil, in February.

Korea and Taiwan, both colonies of Japan at this time, also experienced pronounced outbreaks in late 1919 and early 1920.

====Post-pandemic====
By mid-1920, the pandemic was largely considered to be &quot;over&quot; by the public as well as governments. Though parts of Chile experienced a third, milder wave between November 1920 and March 1921, the flu seemed to be mostly absent through the winter of 1920–1921. In the United States, for example, deaths from pneumonia and influenza were &quot;very much lower than for many years&quot;.

Seasonal Influenza after the end of the pandemic, began to be reported again from many places in 1921. Influenza continued to be felt in Chile, where a post pandemic fourth wave affected seven of its 24 provinces between June and December 1921. The winter of 1921–1922 was the first major reappearance of seasonal influenza in the Northern Hemisphere after the pandemic ended, in many parts its most significant occurrence since the main pandemic in late 1918. Northwestern Europe was particularly affected. All-cause mortality in the Netherlands approximately doubled in January 1922 alone. In Helsinki, a major epidemic (the fifth since 1918) prevailed between November and December 1921. The flu was also widespread in the United States, its prevalence in California reportedly greater in early March 1922 than at any point since the pandemic ended in 1920.

In the years after 1920, the disease, a novel one in 1918, assumed a more familiar nature, coming to represent at least one form of the &quot;seasonal flu&quot;. The virus, H1N1, remained endemic, occasionally causing more severe or otherwise notable outbreaks as it gradually evolved over the years. The period since its initial appearance in 1918 has been termed a &quot;pandemic era&quot;, in which all flu pandemics since its emergence have been caused by its own descendants. Following the first of these post-1918 pandemics, in 1957, the virus was totally displaced by the novel H2N2, the reassortant product of the human H1N1 and an avian influenza virus, which thereafter became the active influenza A virus in humans.

In 1977, an influenza virus bearing a very close resemblance to the seasonal H1N1, which had not been seen since the 1950s, appeared in Russia and subsequently initiated a &quot;technical&quot; pandemic that principally affected those 26 years of age and younger. While some natural explanations, such as the virus remaining in some frozen state for 20 years, have been proposed to explain this unprecedented phenomenon, the nature of influenza itself has been cited in favor of human involvement of some kind, such as an accidental leak from a lab where the old virus had been preserved for research purposes. Following this miniature pandemic, the reemerged H1N1 became endemic once again but did not displace the other active influenza A virus, H3N2 (which itself had displaced H2N2 through a pandemic in 1968). For the first time, two influenza A viruses were observed in cocirculation. This state of affairs has persisted even after 2009, when a novel H1N1 virus emerged, sparked a pandemic, and thereafter took the place of the seasonal H1N1 to circulate alongside H3N2.

===Potential origins===
Despite its name, historical and epidemiological data cannot identify the geographic origin of the Spanish flu. However, several theories have been proposed.

====United States====
The first confirmed cases originated in the United States. Historian Alfred W. Crosby stated in 2003 that the flu originated in Kansas, and author John M. Barry described a January 1918 outbreak in Haskell County, Kansas, as the point of origin in his 2004 article.

A 2018 study of tissue slides and medical reports led by evolutionary biology professor Michael Worobey found evidence against the disease originating from Kansas, as those cases were milder and had fewer deaths compared to the infections in New York City in the same period. The study did find evidence through phylogenetic analyses that the virus likely had a North American origin, though it was not conclusive. In addition, the haemagglutinin glycoproteins of the virus suggest that it originated long before 1918, and other studies suggest that the reassortment of the H1N1 virus likely occurred in or around 1915.

====Europe====
The major U.K. troop staging and hospital camp in Étaples in France has been theorized by virologist John Oxford as being at the center of the Spanish flu. His study found that in late 1916 the Étaples camp was hit by the onset of a new disease with high mortality that caused symptoms similar to the flu. According to Oxford, a similar outbreak occurred in March 1917 at army barracks in Aldershot, and military pathologists later recognized these early outbreaks as the same disease as the Spanish flu. The overcrowded camp and hospital at Étaples was an ideal environment for the spread of a respiratory virus.

The hospital treated thousands of victims of poison gas attacks, and other casualties of war, and 100,000 soldiers passed through the camp every day. It also was home to a piggery and poultry was regularly brought in from surrounding villages to feed the camp. Oxford and his team postulated that a precursor virus, harbored in birds, mutated and then migrated to pigs kept near the front.

A report published in 2016 in the &quot;Journal of the Chinese Medical Association&quot; found evidence that the 1918 virus had been circulating in the European armies for months and possibly years before the 1918 pandemic. Political scientist Andrew Price-Smith published data from the Austrian archives suggesting the influenza began in Austria in early 1917.

A 2009 study in &quot;Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses&quot; found that Spanish flu mortality simultaneously peaked within the two-month period of October and November 1918 in all fourteen European countries analyzed, which is inconsistent with the pattern that researchers would expect if the virus had originated somewhere in Europe and then spread outwards.

====China====
In 1993, Claude Hannoun, the leading expert on the Spanish flu at the Pasteur Institute, asserted the precursor virus was likely to have come from China and then mutated in the United States near Boston and from there spread to Brest, France, Europe&#x27;s battlefields, the rest of Europe, and the rest of the world, with Allied soldiers and sailors as the main disseminators. Hannoun considered several alternative hypotheses of origin, such as Spain, Kansas, and Brest, as being possible, but not likely.

In 2014, historian Mark Humphries argued that the mobilization of 96,000 Chinese laborers to work behind the British and French lines might have been the source of the pandemic. Humphries, of the Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John&#x27;s, based his conclusions on newly unearthed records. He found archival evidence that a respiratory illness that struck northern China (where the laborers came from) in November 1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the Spanish flu. Unfortunately, no tissue samples have survived for modern comparison. Nevertheless, there were some reports of respiratory illness on parts of the path the laborers took to get to Europe, which also passed through North America.

China was one of the few regions of the world seemingly less affected by the Spanish flu pandemic, where several studies have documented a comparatively mild flu season in 1918. (Although this is disputed due to lack of data during the Warlord Period, see Around the globe.) This has led to speculation that the Spanish flu pandemic originated in China, as the lower rates of flu mortality may be explained by the Chinese population&#x27;s previously acquired immunity to the flu virus. In the Guangdong Province it was reported that early outbreaks of influenza in 1918 disproportionately impacted young men. The June outbreak infected children and adolescents between 11 and 20 years of age, while the October outbreak was most common in those aged 11 to 15.

A report published in 2016 in the &quot;Journal of the Chinese Medical Association&quot; found no evidence that the 1918 virus was imported to Europe via Chinese and Southeast Asian soldiers and workers and instead found evidence of its circulation in Europe before the pandemic. The 2016 study found that the low flu mortality rate (an estimated one in a thousand) recorded among the Chinese and Southeast Asian workers in Europe suggests that the Asian units were not different from other Allied military units in France at the end of 1918 and, thus, were not a likely source of a new lethal virus. Further evidence against the disease being spread by Chinese workers was that workers entered Europe through other routes that did not result in a detectable spread, making them unlikely to have been the original hosts.

==Epidemiology and pathology==
===Transmission and mutation===

The basic reproduction number of the virus was between 2 and 3. The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation. The war may also have reduced people&#x27;s resistance to the virus. Some speculate the soldiers&#x27; immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility. A large factor in the worldwide occurrence of the flu was increased travel. Modern transportation systems made it easier for soldiers, sailors, and civilian travelers to spread the disease. Another was lies and denial by governments, leaving the population ill-prepared to handle the outbreaks.

The severity of the second wave has been attributed to the circumstances of the First World War. In civilian life, natural selection favors a mild strain. Those who get very ill stay home, and those mildly ill continue with their lives, preferentially spreading the mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus. The second wave began, and the flu quickly spread around the world again. Consequently, during modern pandemics, health officials look for deadlier strains of a virus when it reaches places with social upheaval. The fact that most of those who recovered from first-wave infections had become immune showed that it must have been the same strain of flu. This was most dramatically illustrated in Copenhagen, which escaped with a combined mortality rate of just 0.29% (0.02% in the first wave and 0.27% in the second wave) because of exposure to the less-lethal first wave. For the rest of the population, the second wave was far more deadly; the most vulnerable people were those like the soldiers in the trenches – adults who were young and fit.

After the lethal second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 people died in the week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, influenza had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline in the lethality of the disease is that doctors became more effective in the prevention and treatment of pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus. However, John Barry stated in his 2004 book &quot;The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague In History&quot; that researchers have found no evidence to support this position. Another theory holds that the 1918 virus mutated extremely rapidly to a less lethal strain. Such evolution of influenza is a common occurrence: there is a tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time, as the hosts of more dangerous strains tend to die out. Fatal cases did continue into 1919, however. One notable example was that of ice hockey player Joe Hall, who, while playing for the Montreal Canadiens, fell victim to the flu in April after an outbreak that resulted in the cancellation of the 1919 Stanley Cup Finals.

===Signs and symptoms===

The majority of the infected experienced only the typical flu symptoms of sore throat, headache, and fever, especially during the first wave. However, during the second wave, the disease was much more serious, often complicated by bacterial pneumonia, which was often the cause of death. This more serious type would cause &quot;heliotrope cyanosis&quot; to develop, whereby the skin would first develop two mahogany spots over the cheekbones which would then over a few hours spread to color the entire face blue, followed by black coloration first in the extremities and then further spreading to the limbs and the torso. After this, death would follow within hours or days due to the lungs being filled with fluids. Other signs and symptoms reported included spontaneous mouth and nosebleeds, miscarriages for pregnant women, a peculiar smell, teeth and hair falling out, delirium, dizziness, insomnia, loss of hearing or smell, and impaired vision. One observer wrote, &quot;One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine. Bleeding from the ears and petechial hemorrhages in the skin also occurred&quot;.

The majority of deaths were from bacterial pneumonia, a common secondary infection associated with influenza. This pneumonia was itself caused by common upper respiratory-tract bacteria, which were able to get into the lungs via the damaged bronchial tubes of the victims. The virus also killed people directly by causing massive hemorrhages and edema in the lungs. Modern analysis has shown the virus to be particularly deadly because in animal trials it triggers an overreaction of the body&#x27;s immune system (sometimes referred to as a cytokine storm). The strong immune reactions of young adults were postulated to have ravaged the body, whereas the weaker immune reactions of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups.

===Misdiagnosis===
Because the virus that caused the disease was too small to be seen under a microscope at the time, there were problems with correctly diagnosing it. The bacterium &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; was instead mistakenly thought to be the cause, as it was big enough to be seen and was present in many, though not all, patients. For this reason, a vaccine that was used against that bacillus did not make an infection rarer but did decrease the death rate.

During the deadly second wave there were also fears that it was in fact plague, dengue fever, or cholera. Another common misdiagnosis was typhus, which was common in circumstances of social upheaval, and was therefore also affecting Russia in the aftermath of the October Revolution. In Chile, the view of the country&#x27;s elite was that the nation was in severe decline, and therefore doctors assumed that the disease was typhus caused by poor hygiene, and not an infectious one, causing a mismanaged response which did not ban mass gatherings.

===The role of climate conditions===

Studies have shown that the immune system of Spanish flu victims could have been weakened by adverse climate conditions which were particularly unseasonably cold and wet for extended periods of time during the duration of the pandemic. This affected especially WWI troops exposed to incessant rains and lower-than-average temperatures for the duration of the conflict, and especially during the second wave of the pandemic. Ultra-high-resolution climate data combined with highly detailed mortality records analyzed at Harvard University and the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine identified a severe climate anomaly that impacted Europe from 1914 to 1919, with several environmental indicators directly influencing the severity and spread of the Spanish flu pandemic. Specifically, a significant increase in precipitation affected all of Europe during the second wave of the pandemic, from September to December 1918. Mortality figures follow closely the concurrent increase in precipitation and decrease in temperatures. Several explanations have been proposed for this, including the fact that lower temperatures and increased precipitation provided ideal conditions for virus replication and transmission, while also negatively affecting the immune systems of soldiers and other people exposed to the inclement weather, a factor proven to increase likelihood of infection by both viruses and pneumococcal co-morbid infections documented to have affected a large percentage of pandemic victims (one fifth of them, with a 36% mortality rate). A six-year climate anomaly (1914–1919) brought cold, marine air to Europe, drastically changing its weather, as documented by eyewitness accounts and instrumental records, reaching as far as the Gallipoli campaign, in Turkey, where ANZAC troops suffered extremely cold temperatures despite the normally Mediterranean climate of the region. The climate anomaly likely influenced the migration of H1N1 avian vectors which contaminate bodies of water with their droppings, reaching 60% infection rates in autumn. The climate anomaly has been associated with an anthropogenic increase in atmospheric dust, due to the incessant bombardment; increased nucleation due to dust particles (cloud condensation nuclei) contributed to increased precipitation.

==Responses==
===Public health management===
While systems for alerting public health authorities of infectious spread did exist in 1918, they did not generally include influenza, leading to a delayed response. Nevertheless, actions were taken. Maritime quarantines were declared on islands such as Iceland, Australia, and American Samoa, saving many lives. Social distancing measures were introduced, for example closing schools, theatres, and places of worship, limiting public transportation, and banning mass gatherings. Wearing face masks became common in some places, such as Japan, though there were debates over their efficacy. There was also some resistance to their use, as exemplified by the Anti-Mask League of San Francisco. Vaccines were also developed, but as these were based on bacteria and not the actual virus, they could only help with secondary infections. The actual enforcement of various restrictions varied. To a large extent, the New York City health commissioner ordered businesses to open and close on staggered shifts to avoid overcrowding on the subways.

A later study found that measures such as banning mass gatherings and requiring the wearing of face masks could cut the death rate up to 50 percent, but this was dependent on their being imposed early in the outbreak and not being lifted prematurely.

===Medical treatment===
As there were no antiviral drugs to treat the virus, and no antibiotics to treat the secondary bacterial infections, doctors would rely on a random assortment of medicines with varying degrees of effectiveness, such as aspirin, quinine, arsenics, digitalis, strychnine, epsom salts, castor oil, and iodine. Treatments of traditional medicine, such as bloodletting, ayurveda, and kampo were also applied.

===Information dissemination===
Due to World War I, many countries engaged in wartime censorship, and suppressed reporting of the pandemic. For example, the Italian newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; was prohibited from reporting daily death tolls. The newspapers of the time were also generally paternalistic and worried about mass panic. Misinformation also spread along with the disease. In Ireland there was a belief that noxious gases were rising from the mass graves of Flanders Fields and being &quot;blown all over the world by winds&quot;. There were also rumors that the Germans were behind it, for example by poisoning the aspirin manufactured by Bayer, or by releasing poison gas from U-boats.

==Mortality==
===Around the globe===

The Spanish flu infected around 500 million people, about one-third of the world&#x27;s population. Estimates as to how many infected people died vary greatly, but the flu is regardless considered to be one of the deadliest pandemics in history. An early estimate from 1927 put global mortality at 21.6 million. An estimate from 1991 states that the virus killed between 25 and 39 million people. A 2005 estimate put the death toll at 50 million (about 3% of the global population), and possibly as high as 100 million (more than 5%). However, a 2018 reassessment in the &quot;American Journal of Epidemiology&quot; estimated the total to be about 17 million, though this has been contested. With a world population of 1.8 to 1.9 billion, these estimates correspond to between 1 and 6 percent of the population.

Estimates done in 2021 by John M. Barry have the total death toll alone at well above 100 million.

A 2009 study in &quot;Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses&quot; based on data from fourteen European countries estimated a total of 2.64 million excess deaths in Europe attributable to the Spanish flu during the major 1918–1919 phase of the pandemic, in line with the three prior studies from 1991, 2002, and 2006 that calculated a European death toll of between 2 million and 2.3 million. This represents a mortality rate of about 1.1% of the European population ( 250 million in 1918), considerably higher than the mortality rate in the U.S., which the authors hypothesize is likely due to the severe effects of the war in Europe. The excess mortality rate in the U.K. has been estimated at 0.28%–0.4%, far below this European average.

Some 12–17 million people died in India, about 5% of the population. The death toll in India&#x27;s British-ruled districts was 13.88 million. Another estimate gives at least 12 million dead. The decade between 1911 and 1921 was the only census period in which India&#x27;s population fell, mostly due to devastation of the Spanish flu pandemic. While India is generally described as the country most severely affected by the Spanish flu, at least one study argues that other factors may partially account for the very high excess mortality rates observed in 1918, citing unusually high 1917 mortality and wide regional variation (ranging from 0.47% to 6.66%). A 2006 study in &quot;The Lancet&quot; also noted that Indian provinces had excess mortality rates ranging from 2.1% to 7.8%, stating: &quot;Commentators at the time attributed this huge variation to differences in nutritional status and diurnal fluctuations in temperature.&quot;

In Finland, 20,000 died out of 210,000 infected. In Sweden, 34,000 died.

In Japan, the flu killed nearly 500,000 people over two waves between 1918 and 1920, with nearly 300,000 excess deaths between October 1918 and May 1919 and 182,000 between December 1919 and May 1920.

In the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), 1.5 million were assumed to have died among 30 million inhabitants. In Tahiti, 13% of the population died during one month. Similarly, in Western Samoa 22% of the population of 38,000 died within two months.

In Istanbul, capital of the Ottoman Empire, 6,403 to 10,000 died, giving the city a mortality rate of at least 0.56%.

In New Zealand, the flu killed an estimated 6,400 Pākehā (or &quot;New Zealanders primarily of European descent&quot;) and 2,500 indigenous Māori in six weeks, with Māori dying at eight times the rate of Pākehā.

In Australia, the flu killed around 12,000 to 20,000 people. The country&#x27;s death rate, 2.7 per 1,000 people, was one of the lowest recorded compared with other countries at the time; however, as much as 40 percent of the population were infected, and a mortality rate of 50 percent was recorded by some Aboriginal communities. New South Wales and Victoria saw the greatest relative mortality, with 3.19 and 2.40 deaths per 1,000 people respectively, while Western Australia, Queensland, Southern Australia, and Tasmania experienced rates of 1.70, 1.14, 1.13, and 1.09 per 1,000 respectively. In Queensland, at least one-third of deaths recorded were in the Aboriginal population.

In the U.S., about 20 million out of a population of 105 million became infected in the 1918–1919 season, and an estimated 500,000 to 850,000 died (0.5 to 0.8 percent of the U.S. population). Native American tribes were particularly hard hit. In the Four Corners area, there were 3,293 registered deaths among Native Americans. Entire Inuit and Alaskan Native village communities died in Alaska. In Canada, 50,000 died.

In Brazil, 300,000 died, including president Rodrigues Alves.

In the UK, as many as 250,000 died; in France, more than 400,000.

In Ghana, the influenza epidemic killed at least 100,000 people. Tafari Makonnen (the future Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia) was one of the first Ethiopians who contracted influenza but survived. Many of his subjects did not; estimates for fatalities in the capital city, Addis Ababa, range from 5,000 to 10,000, or higher.

The death toll in Russia has been estimated at 450,000, though the epidemiologists who suggested this number called it a &quot;shot in the dark&quot;. If it is correct, Russia lost roughly 0.4% of its population, meaning it suffered the lowest influenza-related mortality in Europe. Another study considers this number unlikely, given that the country was in the grip of a civil war, and the infrastructure of daily life had broken down; the study suggests that Russia&#x27;s death toll was closer to 2%, or 2.7 million people.

====Devastated communities====

Even in areas where mortality was low, so many adults were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that healthcare workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill. Mass graves were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without coffins in many places.

Bristol Bay, a region of Alaska populated by indigenous people, suffered a death rate of 40 percent of the total population, with some villages entirely disappearing.

Nenana, Alaska, managed to avoid the extent of the pandemic between 1918 and 1919, but the flu at last reached the town in spring 1920. Reports suggested that during the first two weeks of May, the majority of the town&#x27;s population became infected; 10% of the population were estimated to have died, most of whom were Alaska Natives.

Several Pacific island territories were hit particularly hard. The pandemic reached them from New Zealand, which was too slow to implement measures to prevent ships, such as , carrying the flu from leaving its ports. From New Zealand, the flu reached Tonga (killing 8% of the population), Nauru (16%), and Fiji (5%, 9,000 people). Worst affected was Western Samoa, formerly German Samoa, which had been occupied by New Zealand in 1914. 90% of the population was infected; 30% of adult men, 22% of adult women, and 10% of children died. By contrast, Governor John Martin Poyer prevented the flu from reaching neighboring American Samoa by imposing a blockade. The disease spread fastest through the higher social classes among the indigenous peoples, because of the custom of gathering oral tradition from chiefs on their deathbeds; many community elders were infected through this process.

In Iran, the mortality was very high: according to an estimate, between 902,400 and 2,431,000, or 8% to 22% of the total population died. The country was going through the Persian famine of 1917–1919 concurrently.

In Ireland, during the worst 12 months, the Spanish flu accounted for one-third of all deaths.

In South Africa it is estimated that about 300,000 people amounting to 6% of the population died within six weeks. Government actions in the early stages of the virus&#x27; arrival in the country in September 1918 are believed to have unintentionally accelerated its spread throughout the country. Almost a quarter of the working population of Kimberley, consisting of workers in the diamond mines, died. In British Somaliland, one official estimated that 7% of the native population died. This huge death toll resulted from an extremely high infection rate of up to 50% and the extreme severity of the symptoms.

==== Other areas====
In the Pacific, American Samoa and the French colony of New Caledonia succeeded in preventing even a single death from influenza through effective quarantines. However, the outbreak was delayed into 1926 for American Samoa and 1921 for New Caledonia as the quarantine period ended. On American Samoa, at least 25% of the island residents were clinically attacked and 0.1% died, and on New Caledonia, there was widespread illness and 0.1% population died. Australia also managed to avoid the first two waves with a quarantine. Iceland protected a third of its population from exposure by blocking the main road of the island. By the end of the pandemic, the isolated island of Marajó, in Brazil&#x27;s Amazon River Delta had not reported an outbreak. Saint Helena also reported no deaths.
Estimates for the death toll in China have varied widely, a range which reflects the lack of centralized collection of health data at the time due to the Warlord period. China may have experienced a relatively mild flu season in 1918 compared to other areas of the world. However, some reports from its interior suggest that mortality rates from influenza were perhaps higher in at least a few locations in China in 1918. At the very least, there is little evidence that China as a whole was seriously affected by the flu compared to other countries in the world.

The first estimate of the Chinese death toll was made in 1991 by Patterson and Pyle, which estimated a toll of between 5 and 9 million. However, this 1991 study was criticized by later studies due to flawed methodology, and newer studies have published estimates of a far lower mortality rate in China. For instance, Iijima in 1998 estimates the death toll in China to be between 1 and 1.28 million based on data available from Chinese port cities. The lower estimates of the Chinese death toll are based on the low mortality rates that were found in Chinese port cities (for example, Hong Kong) and on the assumption that poor communications prevented the flu from penetrating the interior of China. However, some contemporary newspaper and post office reports, as well as reports from missionary doctors, suggest that the flu did penetrate the Chinese interior and that influenza was severe in at least some locations in the countryside of China.

Although medical records from China&#x27;s interior are lacking, extensive medical data were recorded in Chinese port cities, such as then British-controlled Hong Kong, Canton, Peking, Harbin and Shanghai. These data were collected by the Chinese Maritime Customs Service, which was largely staffed by non-Chinese foreigners, such as the British, French, and other European colonial officials in China. As a whole, data from China&#x27;s port cities show low mortality rates compared to other cities in Asia. For example, the British authorities at Hong Kong and Canton reported a mortality rate from influenza at a rate of 0.25% and 0.32%, much lower than the reported mortality rate of other cities in Asia, such as Calcutta or Bombay, where influenza was much more devastating. Similarly, in the city of Shanghai – which had a population of over 2 million in 1918 – there were only 266 recorded deaths from influenza among the Chinese population in 1918. If extrapolated from the extensive data recorded from Chinese cities, the suggested mortality rate from influenza in China as a whole in 1918 was likely lower than 1% – much lower than the world average (which was around 3–5%). In contrast, Japan and Taiwan had reported a mortality rate from influenza around 0.45% and 0.69% respectively, higher than the mortality rate collected from data in Chinese port cities, such as Hong Kong (0.25%), Canton (0.32%), and Shanghai.

However, it is noted that the influenza mortality rate in Hong Kong and Canton are under-recorded, because only the deaths that occurred in colony hospitals were counted. Similarly, in Shanghai, these statistics are limited to that area of the city under the control of the health section of the Shanghai International Settlement, and the actual death toll in Shanghai was much higher. The medical records from China&#x27;s interior indicate that, compared to cities, rural communities have substantially higher mortality rate. A published influenza survey in Houlu County, Hebei Province, found that the case fatality rate was 9.77% and 0.79% of county population died from influenza in October and November 1918.

===Patterns of fatality===

The pandemic mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S. occurred in people under 65, and nearly half of deaths were in young adults 20 to 40 years old. In 1920, the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but 92% of deaths still occurred in people under 65. This is unusual since influenza is typically most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants under age two, adults over age 70, and the immunocompromised. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889–1890 flu pandemic, known as the &quot;Russian flu&quot;. According to historian John M. Barry, the most vulnerable of all – &quot;those most likely, of the most likely&quot;, to die – were pregnant women. He reported that in thirteen studies of hospitalized women in the pandemic, the death rate ranged from 23% to 71%. Of the pregnant women who survived childbirth, over one-quarter (26%) lost the child. Another oddity was that the outbreak was widespread in the summer and autumn (in the Northern Hemisphere); influenza is usually worse in winter.

There were also geographic patterns to the disease&#x27;s fatality. Some parts of Asia had 30 times higher death rates than some parts of Europe, and generally, Africa and Asia had higher rates, while Europe and North America had lower ones. There was also great variation within continents, with three times higher mortality in Hungary and Spain compared to Denmark, two to three times higher chance of death in Sub-Saharan Africa compared to North Africa, and possibly up to ten times higher rates between the extremes of Asia. Cities were affected worse than rural areas. There were also differences between cities, which might have reflected exposure to the milder first wave giving immunity, as well as the introduction of social distancing measures.

Another major pattern was the differences between social classes. In Oslo, death rates were inversely correlated with apartment size, as the poorer people living in smaller apartments died at a higher rate. Social status was also reflected in the higher mortality among immigrant communities, with Italian Americans, a recently arrived group at the time, were nearly twice as likely to die compared to the average Americans. These disparities reflected worse diets, crowded living conditions, and problems accessing healthcare. Paradoxically, however, African Americans were relatively spared by the pandemic.

More men than women were killed by the flu, as they were more likely to go out and be exposed, while women would tend to stay at home. For the same reason men also were more likely to have pre-existing tuberculosis, which severely worsened the chances of recovery. However, in India the opposite was true, potentially because Indian women were neglected with poorer nutrition, and were expected to care for the sick.

A study conducted by He &quot;et al&quot;. (2011) used a mechanistic modeling approach to study the three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. They examined the factors that underlie variability in temporal patterns and their correlation to patterns of mortality and morbidity. Their analysis suggests that temporal variations in transmission rate provide the best explanation, and the variation in transmission required to generate these three waves is within biologically plausible values. Another study by He &quot;et al&quot;. (2013) used a simple epidemic model incorporating three factors to infer the cause of the three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. These factors were school opening and closing, temperature changes throughout the outbreak, and human behavioral changes in response to the outbreak. Their modeling results showed that all three factors are important, but human behavioral responses showed the most significant effects.

==Effects==
===World War I===
Academic Andrew Price-Smith has made the argument that the virus helped tip the balance of power in the latter days of the war towards the Allied cause. He provides data that the viral waves hit the Central Powers before the Allied powers and that both morbidity and mortality in Germany and Austria were considerably higher than in Britain and France. A 2006 &quot;Lancet&quot; study corroborates higher excess mortality rates in Germany (0.76%) and Austria (1.61%) compared to Britain (0.34%) and France (0.75%).

Kenneth Kahn at Oxford University Computing Services writes that &quot;Many researchers have suggested that the conditions of the war significantly aided the spread of the disease. And others have argued that the course of the war (and subsequent peace treaty) was influenced by the pandemic.&quot; Kahn has developed a model that can be used on home computers to test these theories.

===Economic===

Many businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue, while the healthcare industry reported profit gains. Historian Nancy Bristow has argued that the pandemic, when combined with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was due in part to the failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were mainly women, celebrated the success of their patient care and did not associate the spread of the disease with their work.

A 2020 study found that U.S. cities that implemented early and extensive non-medical measures (quarantine, etc.) suffered no additional adverse economic effects due to implementing those measures. However, the validity of this study has been questioned because of the coincidence of WWI and other problems with data reliability.

===Long-term effects===
A 2006 study in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; found that &quot;cohorts &quot;in utero&quot; during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher transfer payments received compared with other birth cohorts.&quot; A 2018 study found that the pandemic reduced educational attainment in populations. The flu has also been linked to the outbreak of encephalitis lethargica in the 1920s.

Survivors faced an elevated mortality risk. Some survivors did not fully recover from physiological conditions resulting from infection.

==Legacy==

Despite the high morbidity and mortality rates that resulted from the epidemic, the Spanish flu began to fade from public awareness over the decades until the arrival of news about bird flu and other pandemics in the 1990s and 2000s. This has led some historians to label the Spanish flu a &quot;forgotten pandemic&quot;. However, this label has been challenged by the historian Guy Beiner, who has charted a complex history of social and cultural forgetting, demonstrating how the pandemic was overshadowed by the commemoration of the First World War and mostly neglected in mainstream historiography, yet was remembered in private and local traditions across the globe.

There are various theories of why the Spanish flu was &quot;forgotten&quot;. The rapid pace of the pandemic, which killed most of its victims in the United States within less than nine months, resulted in limited media coverage. The general population was familiar with patterns of pandemic disease in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: typhoid, yellow fever, diphtheria, and cholera all occurred near the same time. These outbreaks probably lessened the significance of the influenza pandemic for the public. In some areas, the flu was not reported on, the only mention being that of advertisements for medicines claiming to cure it.

Additionally, the outbreak coincided with the deaths and media focus on the First World War. Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both the war and the epidemic, were among young adults. The high number of war-related deaths of young adults may have overshadowed the deaths caused by flu.

When people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war&#x27;s toll was high, the flu may not have had a tremendous psychological impact or may have seemed an extension of the war&#x27;s tragedies. The duration of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The war, however, had initially been expected to end quickly but lasted for four years by the time the pandemic struck.

===In literature and other media===

Despite the toll of the pandemic, it was never a large theme in American literature. Alfred Crosby suspects that it may be due to the fact that it occurred after World War I, which was the most important event in that generation&#x27;s lives. Katherine Anne Porter&#x27;s 1939 novella &quot;Pale Horse, Pale Rider&quot; is one of the most well-known fictional accounts of the pandemic. The 2006 novel &quot;The Last Town on Earth&quot; focuses on a town which attempts to limit the spread of the flu by preventing people from entering or leaving. &quot;The Pull of the Stars&quot; is a 2020 novel by Emma Donoghue set in Dublin during the Spanish flu. Its final draft was submitted in March 2020, and publishers fast-tracked publication because of the then ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

===Comparison with other pandemics===
The Spanish flu killed a much lower percentage of the world&#x27;s population than the Black Death, which lasted for many more years.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to have killed 17.5 - 31.4 million.
==Research==
The origin of the Spanish flu pandemic, and the relationship between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial. One hypothesis is that the virus strain originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where they spread the disease. Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined with the human pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in swine, led researchers to conclude the influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans, and swine caught the disease from humans.

Others have disagreed, and more recent research has suggested the strain may have originated in a nonhuman, mammalian species. An estimated date for its appearance in mammalian hosts has been put at the period 1882–1913. This ancestor virus diverged about 1913–1915 into two clades (or biological groups each descended from a common ancestor), which gave rise to the classical swine and human H1N1 influenza lineages. The last common ancestor of human strains dates between February 1917 and April 1918. Because pigs are more readily infected with avian influenza viruses than are humans, they were suggested as the original recipients of the virus, passing the virus to humans sometime between 1913 and 1918.
An effort to recreate the Spanish flu strain (a strain of influenza A subtype H1N1) was a collaboration among the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, the USDA ARS Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, and Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. The effort resulted in the announcement (on 5 October 2005) that the group had successfully determined the virus&#x27; genetic sequence, using historic tissue samples recovered by pathologist Johan Hultin from an Inuit female flu victim buried in the Alaskan permafrost and samples preserved from American soldiers Roscoe Vaughan and James Downs.

This enabled researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, led by Dr Terrence Tumpey, to synthesize RNA segments from the H1N1 virus and ultimately reconstruct infective virus particles. These were subsequently used to experimentally infect mice, ferrets, and macaques giving valuable insights into influenza virus biology and pathogenesis, providing important information about how to prevent and control future pandemics.

On 18 January 2007, Kobasa et al. (2007) reported that monkeys (&quot;Macaca fascicularis&quot;) infected with the recreated flu strain exhibited classic symptoms of the 1918 pandemic, and died from an overreaction of the immune system. This may explain why the Spanish flu had its surprising effect on younger, healthier people, as a person with a stronger immune system would potentially have a stronger overreaction.

In December 2008, research by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin linked the presence of three specific genes (termed PA, PB1, and PB2) and a nucleoprotein derived from Spanish flu samples to the ability of the 1918 flu virus to invade the lungs and cause pneumonia. These genes were inserted into a modern H1N1 strain and triggered similar symptoms in animal testing.

In 2008 an investigation used the virus sequence to obtain the Hemagglutinin (HA) antigen and observe the adaptive immunity in 32 survivors of the 1918 flu pandemic, all of them presented seroreactivity and 7 of 8 further tested presented memory B cells able to produce antibodies that bound to the HA antigen highlighting the ability of the immunological memory many decades after.

In June 2010, a team at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine reported the 2009 flu pandemic vaccine provided some cross-protection against the Spanish flu pandemic strain.

One of the few things known for certain about influenza in 1918 and for some years after was that it was, except in the laboratory, exclusively a disease of human beings.

In 2013, the AIR Worldwide Research and Modeling Group &quot;characterized the historic 1918 pandemic and estimated the effects of a similar pandemic occurring today using the AIR Pandemic Flu Model&quot;. In the model, &quot;a modern-day &#x27;Spanish flu&#x27; event would result in additional life insurance losses of between US$15.3–27.8 billion in the United States alone&quot;, with 188,000–337,000 deaths in the United States.

In 2018, Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biology professor at the University of Arizona who is examining the history of the 1918 pandemic, revealed that he obtained tissue slides created by William Rolland, a physician who reported on a respiratory illness likely to be the virus while a pathologist in the British military during World War One. Rolland had authored an article in the &quot;Lancet&quot; during 1917 about a respiratory illness outbreak beginning in 1916 in Étaples, France. Worobey traced recent references to that article to family members who had retained slides that Rolland had prepared during that time. Worobey extracted tissue from the slides to potentially reveal more about the origin of the pathogen.

==Sex differences in mortality==
The high mortality rate of the influenza pandemic is one aspect that sets the pandemic apart from other disease outbreaks. Another factor is the higher mortality rate of men compared with women. Men with an underlying condition were at significantly more risk. Tuberculosis was one of the deadliest diseases in the 1900s, and killed more men than women. But with the spread of influenza disease, the cases of tuberculosis cases in men decreased. Many scholars have noted that tuberculosis increased the mortality rate of influenza in males, decreasing their life expectancy. During the 1900s tuberculosis was more common in males than females, but studies show that when influenza spread the tuberculosis mortality rate among females changed. The death rate of tuberculosis in females increased significantly and would continue to decline until post-pandemic.

Death rates were particularly high in those aged 20–35. The only comparable disease to this was the Black Death, or bubonic plague, in the 1300s. As other studies have shown, tuberculosis and influenza had comorbidities and one affected the other. The ages of males dying of the flu show that tuberculosis was a factor, and as males primarily had this disease at the time of the pandemic, they had a higher mortality rate. Life expectancy dropped in males during the pandemic but then increased two years after the pandemic.

===Island of Newfoundland===
One major cause of the spread of influenza was social behavior. Men had more social variation and were mobile more than women due to their work. Even though there was a higher mortality rate in males, each region showed different results, due to such factors as nutritional deficiency. In Newfoundland, the pandemic spread was highly variable. Influenza did not discriminate who was infected, indeed it attacked the socioeconomic status of people. Although social variability allowed the disease to move quickly geographically, it tended to spread faster and affect men more than women due to labor and social contact. Newfoundland&#x27;s leading cause of death before the pandemic was tuberculosis and this is known to be a severe underlying condition for people and increases the |mortality rate when infected by the influenza disease. There was diverse labor in Newfoundland, men and women had various occupations that involved day-to-day interaction. But, fishing had a major role in the economy and so males were more mobile than females and had more contact with other parts of the world. The spread of the pandemic is known to have begun in the spring of 1918, but Newfoundland did not see the deadly wave until June or July, which aligns with the high demand for employment in the fishery. The majority of men were working along the coast during the summer and it was typical for entire families to move to Newfoundland and work. Studies show a much higher mortality rate in males compared with females. But, during the first, second, and third waves of the pandemic, the mortality shifted. During the first wave, men had a higher mortality rate, but the mortality rate of females increased and was higher during the second and third waves. The female population was larger in certain regions of Newfoundland and therefore had a bigger impact on the death rate.

====Influenza pandemic among Canadian soldiers====
Records indicate the most deaths during the first wave of the pandemic were among young men in their 20s, which reflects the age of enlistment in the war. The mobility of young men during 1918 was linked to the spread of influenza and the biggest wave of the epidemic. In late 1917 and throughout 1918, thousands of male troops gathered at the Halifax port before heading to Europe. Any soldier that was ill and could not depart was added to the population of Halifax, which increased the case rate of influenza among men during the war. To determine the cause of the death during the pandemic, war scientists used the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), which reported under 2 million men and women died during the wars, with a record of those who died from 1917 to 1918. The movement of soldiers during this time and the transportation from United States between Canada likely had a significant effect on the spread of the pandemic.

<doc id="198800" wikidata="Q318328" url="?curid=198800" title="John Harvard (clergyman)">
<text>John Harvard (16071638) was an English Puritan minister in Colonial New England whose
deathbed
bequest to the
founded two years earlier by the Massachusetts Bay Colony was so gratefully received that the colony consequently ordered 
&quot;that the
agreed upon formerly to
built at
called [[Harvard College|Harvard

Harvard was born in [[Southwark]], England, and earned bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees from [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]].
In 1637 he emigrated to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], in British America, where he became a [[Elder (Presbyterian)|teaching elder]] and assistant preacher of the First Church in [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]].

Harvard died of tuberculosis in 1638, leaving a large sum of money and his 400-volume scholar&#x27;s library to the Colony&#x27;s new school, which the Colony then voted to name in his honor.
[[Harvard University]] considers him the most honored of its founders—those whose efforts and contributions in its early days &quot;ensure[d] its permanence&quot;—and a [[Statue of John Harvard|statue in his honor]] is a prominent feature of [[Harvard Yard]].

==Life==

===Early life===

Harvard was born and raised in [[Southwark]], [[Surrey]], England, (now part of [[London]]), the fourth of nine children of Robert Harvard (1562–1625), a butcher and tavern owner, and Katherine Rogers (1584–1635), a native of [[Stratford-upon-Avon]]. Her father, Thomas Rogers (1540–1611), served on the borough corporation&#x27;s council with [[John Shakespeare]]. Harvard was baptised in St Saviour&#x27;s Church (now [[Southwark Cathedral]]) and attended [[St Saviour&#x27;s Grammar School]], where his father was a member of the governing body and a [[Churchwarden|warden of the parish church]]. His grandparents&#x27; house in Stratford-upon-Avon, largely rebuilt after a fire of 1595, survives as &#x27;Harvard House&#x27;.

In 1625, [[bubonic plague]] reduced the immediate family to only John, his brother Thomas, and Katherine. Katherine was soon remarriedfirstly in 1626 to John Elletson (1580–1626), who died within a few months, then (1627) to [[Richard Yarward|Richard Yearwood]] (1580–1632). She died in 1635, Thomas in 1637.

Left with some property,
Harvard&#x27;s mother was able to send him to the [[University of Cambridge]], He was admitted as a [[Commoner (academia)|pensioner]] to [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], on 19 December 1627; he was awarded his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1632 and [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)|M.A.]] in 1635.

===Marriage and emigration to New England===
On 19 April of either 1636 or 1637, Harvard married Ann Sadler (1614–55) of [[Patcham]] in [[East Sussex]], sister of his college contemporary [[John Sadler (Town Clerk of London)|John Sadler]], at St Michael the Archangel Church, in the parish of South Malling, [[Lewes]].

In the spring or summer of 1637, the couple emigrated to the [[New England Colonies]], where Harvard became a [[Freeman (Colonial)|freeman]] of Massachusetts and, settling in [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]], a [[Elder (Presbyterian)|teaching elder]] of the First Church there and an assistant preacher, though it is not known whether he was episcopally ordained. In 1638, a tract of land was deeded to him there, and he was appointed that same year to a committee &quot;to consider of some things tending toward a body of laws.&quot;

He built his house on Country Road (later Market Street and now Main Street), next to Gravel Lane, a site that is now [[John Harvard Mall]]. His orchard extended up the hill behind his house.

===Death===
On 14 September 1638, Harvard died of [[tuberculosis]] and was buried at Charlestown&#x27;s [[Phipps Street Burying Ground]]. In 1828, Harvard University alumni erected a granite monument to his memory there, his original stone having disappeared during the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]].

Harvard&#x27;s widow, Ann, is believed to have married again, this time to [[Thomas Allen (nonconformist)|Thomas Allen]], Harvard&#x27;s successor as teacher of the Charlestown church and administrator of Harvard&#x27;s estate.

==Bequest to college==


Two years before Harvard&#x27;s death the [[Massachusetts General Court|Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony]]desiring to &quot;advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity: dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches, when our present ministers shall lie in the dust&quot;appropriated [[Pound sterling|£]]400 toward a &quot;schoale or colledge&quot; at what was then called Newtowne.
In an oral will spoken to his wife the childless Harvard, who had inherited considerable sums from his father, mother, and brother,
bequeathed to the school [[Pound sterling|£]]780half of his monetary estatewith the remainder to his wife;
this bequest was roughly equal to the Massachusetts Bay Colony&#x27;s annual tax receipts.

Perhaps more importantly he also gave his scholar&#x27;s library comprising some 329 titles (totaling 400 volumes, some titles being multivolume works).
In gratitude, it was subsequently ordered &quot;that the

agreed upon formerly to

built at

called [[Harvard College|Harvard
(Even before Harvard&#x27;s death, Newtowne had been renamed Cambridge, after the English [[University of Cambridge|university]] attended by many early colonists, including Harvard himself.)

===Founding &quot;myth&quot;===
The Harvard College undergraduate newspaper, &quot;[[The Harvard Crimson]]&quot;, as well as what &quot;[[Harvard Magazine]]&quot; calls &quot;smartass&quot; tour guides,
commonly assert that John Harvard does not merit the honorific &quot;founder&quot;, because the Colony&#x27;s vote creating the institution occurred two years prior to Harvard&#x27;s bequest.
But as detailed in a 1934 letter by [[Jerome Davis Greene]], Secretary of the [[Harvard Corporation]], the founding of Harvard College was not the act of one but the work of many; John Harvard is therefore considered not &quot;the&quot; founder, but rather &quot;a&quot;founder, of the schoolthough the timeliness and generosity of his contribution have made him the most honored of these:
==Memorials and tributes==
A statue in Harvard&#x27;s honor—not, however, a &#x27;likeness&#x27; of him, there being nothing to indicate what he had looked like—is a prominent feature of [[Harvard Yard]] (see &quot;[[John Harvard (statue)|John Harvard statue]]&quot;) and was featured on a 1986 stamp, part of the United States Postal Service&#x27;s [[Great Americans series]]. A figure representing him also appears in a stained-glass window in the chapel of [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]].

The [[John Harvard Library]] in Southwark, London, is named in Harvard&#x27;s honor, as is the [[Harvard Bridge]] linking Boston and Cambridge.

In [[Southwark Cathedral]], the Harvard Chapel in the north transept was rebuilt with donations from Harvard graduates and dedicated in 1907. The stained-glass window was designed by the American artist, [[John La Farge]] and given by the American ambassador to the United Kingdom, [[Joseph Choate]].

<doc id="198802" wikidata="Q190882" url="?curid=198802" title="Phoney War">
<text>The Phoney War (; ; Polish: Dziwna wojna) was an eight-month period at the outset of World War II during which there were virtually no Allied military land operations on the Western Front. World War II began on 1 September 1939 with Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland. Two days later, the &quot;Phoney&quot; period began with declarations of war by the United Kingdom and France against Germany, but with little actual warfare occurring.

Although the Western Allies did not conduct major military actions during the Phoney War, they did implement economic warfare, especially a naval blockade of Germany, and they shut down German surface raiders. They meanwhile formulated elaborate plans for large-scale operations designed to cripple the German war effort. The plans included opening an Anglo-French front in the Balkans, invading Norway to seize control of Germany&#x27;s main source of iron ore, and imposing an embargo against the Soviet Union which was Germany&#x27;s primary oil supplier. By April 1940, the execution of the Norway plan was considered, by itself, inadequate to stop the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;.

The quiet of the Phoney War was punctuated by a few isolated Allied actions. The French invasion of Germany&#x27;s Saar district on 7 September was allegedly intended to assist Poland by diverting German troops from the Polish Front but the half-hearted Saar operation fizzled out within days and France withdrew. In November 1939, the Soviets attacked Finland in the Winter War, eliciting much debate in France and Britain about mounting an offensive to help Finland. However, the necessary forces for the offensive were not assembled until after the Winter War concluded to neither sides&#x27; advantage in March. The Allied discussions about a Scandinavian campaign triggered concern in Germany and resulted in the German invasion of Denmark and Norway in April 1940. This caused the Allied troops previously earmarked for Finland to be redirected to Norway. Fighting there continued until June, when the Allies evacuated, ceding Norway to Germany in response to the German invasion of France.

On the Axis side during the Phoney period, Nazi Germany initiated attacks at sea in the autumn of 1939 and winter of 1940 against British aircraft carriers and destroyers, sinking several, including the carrier . Aerial combat began in October 1939 when the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; launched air raids on British warships. There were minor bombing raids and reconnaissance flights on both sides. Fascist Italy was not involved militarily in the European war at this time.

With the German invasion of France and the Low Countries on 10 May 1940, and the ascension of Winston Churchill to British Prime Minister in that same month followed by the massive Dunkirk evacuation commencing on 26 May, the Phoney War ended and the real war began.

==Terminology==
&quot;Bore War&quot; was the initial term used by the British. It was likely a pun on the Boer War fought four decades earlier in South Africa. Eventually, the Americanism &quot;Phoney War&quot; became the favoured phrase on both sides of the Atlantic. This term gained currency in the British Empire and Commonwealth in large part to avoid confusion with the South African conflict.

Credit for coining &quot;Phoney War&quot; is generally given to U.S. Senator William Borah who, commenting in September 1939 on the inactivity on the Western Front, said: &quot;There is something phoney about this war.&quot; &quot;Phoney War&quot; customarily appears using the British spelling (with an &#x27;e&#x27;) even in North America, rather than adopting the American spelling, &quot;Phony&quot;, although some American sources do not follow the pattern. The first known recorded use of the term in print was in September 1939 in a U.S. newspaper which used the British spelling. Other contemporaneous American instances used &quot;Phony&quot; since both spellings were acceptable. In Great Britain, the term first appeared in print in January 1940.

The Phoney War was also referred to as the &quot;Twilight War&quot; (by Winston Churchill) and as the (&quot;the sitting war&quot;: a word play on created by the British press). In French, it is referred to as the (&quot;funny&quot; or &quot;strange&quot; war).

==Pre-war planning==
In March 1939, Britain and France formalized plans for how they would conduct war against Nazi Germany. Knowing their enemy would be more prepared and have land and air superiority, the Allies&#x27; strategy was to contest any specific German aggressive actions, but to essentially maintain a defensive posture. This would allow time for Britain and France to build up their own military resources and eventually attain economic and naval superiority over Germany.

To this end, Britain initially committed to sending two divisions to France, and two more eleven months later.
The Polish Army&#x27;s plan for defense, Plan West, assumed the Allies would quickly undertake a significant Western Front offensive that would provide relief to the Polish forces in the East. However, the Poles&#x27; assumption was proven wrong by the passivity of the Phoney War.

==German invasion of Poland==
Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 marked the beginning of World War II. Within 48 hours, in fulfillment of their treaty obligations to Poland, the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany.

While most of the German army was engaged in Poland, a much smaller German force manned the Siegfried Line, which was their fortified defensive line along the French border. On 7 September, the French commenced the limited Saar Offensive, but withdrew when their artillery could not penetrate German defenses. A further assault was planned for 20 September, but on 17 September, following the USSR&#x27;s invasion of Poland, the assault was called off. In the air, the Royal Air Force (RAF) launched a bombing raid over the Wilhelmshaven port on the 4th of September, though this proved costly. There were occasional dogfights between fighter planes, and the RAF dropped propaganda leaflets on Germany.

The U.S. foreign correspondent William Shirer was assigned to Berlin at the onset of World War II. In his diary entries on 9 and 10 September 1939, he wrote about the puzzlement felt by many:

During the September Campaign in Poland, the British government under Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain still hoped to persuade Germany to agree to peace. Although London hospitals prepared for 300,000 casualties in the first week of the war (Britain and France did not realise that Germany used 90% of its frontline aircraft in the Polish invasion), Germany did not launch the expected full-scale air bombardment of British cities. Combatants feared massive retaliation for attacking civilian targets. German pilots who bombed Scottish naval bases said they would have been court-martialed and executed if they bombed civilians. However both sides found that attacks on military targets, such as the British attack on Wilhelmshaven, could lead to high losses of aircraft.

In contrast to the lack of hostilities on land between the Allies and Germany, the fighting on the seas was real. On 3 September, the British liner was torpedoed off the Hebrides with the loss of 112 lives in what was to be the start of the lengthy Battle of the Atlantic. On 4 September, the Allies announced a blockade of Germany to prevent her importing food and raw materials to sustain her war effort; the Germans immediately declared a counter-blockade, while the Soviet Union helped Germany with supplies bypassing the blockade.

After World War II, it was discovered that Nazi Germany&#x27;s armed forces were vulnerable throughout the September Campaign. They had not yet reached full fighting strength and might have succumbed to a determined opponent, or at least suffered serious damage. At the Nuremberg trials, German military commander Alfred Jodl said that &quot;if we did not collapse already in the year 1939 that was due only to the fact that during the Polish campaign, the approximately 110 French and British divisions in the West were held completely inactive against the 23 German divisions.&quot; General Wilhelm Keitel stated: &quot;We soldiers had always expected an attack by France during the Polish campaign, and were very surprised that nothing happened... A French attack would have encountered only a German military screen, not a real defense.&quot; According to General Siegfried Westphal, if the French had attacked in force in September 1939, the German army &quot;could only have held out for one or two weeks.&quot;

==Saar Offensive==

The Saar Offensive on 7 September was the one limited land action by the Allies during the Phoney War. The French attacked the Saarland, which was defended by the German 1st Army. The assault, whose strategic purpose was ostensibly to assist Poland, was stopped after a few kilometres and the French forces withdrew.

According to the Franco-Polish Alliance, the French Army was to start preparations for a major offensive three days after the beginning of mobilization. The preliminary mobilization had occurred in France on 26 August. By 1 September, full mobilization was declared. The French forces were to gain control over the area between the French border and the German lines, and then to probe the German defenses. On the 15th day of the mobilization, the French Army was to start an all-out assault on Germany.

The offensive in the Rhine river valley area began on 7 September. Since the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; was occupied in the attack on Poland, the French soldiers enjoyed a decisive numerical advantage along their border with Germany. Eleven French divisions advanced along a line near Saarbrücken against weak German opposition. The assault was to have been carried out by roughly 40 divisions, including one armoured, three mechanised divisions, 78 artillery regiments and 40 tank battalions. The French Army had advanced to a depth of and captured about 20 villages evacuated by the German army, without any resistance but the half-hearted offensive was halted after France seized the Warndt Forest, of heavily mined German territory. The Saar Offensive did not result in the diversion of any German troops from the Polish Front.

On 12 September, the Anglo-French Supreme War Council gathered for the first time at Abbeville. It decided all offensive actions were to be halted immediately as the French opted to fight a defensive war, forcing the Germans to come to them. General Maurice Gamelin ordered his troops to stop no closer than from German positions along the Siegfried Line. Poland was not notified of this decision. Instead, Gamelin incorrectly informed Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły that half of his divisions were in contact with the enemy and that French advances had forced the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; to withdraw at least six divisions from Poland. The following day, the commander of the French Military Mission to Poland, General Louis Faury, told the Polish Chief of Staff—General Wacław Stachiewicz—that the major offensive on the Western Front planned from 17 to 20 September had to be postponed. At the same time, French divisions were ordered to withdraw to their barracks along the Maginot Line. This quick cessation of fighting by the French contributed to the &quot;Phoney War&quot; characterization.

==Inactivity==
In the war&#x27;s early months, antagonism between the British and German populations was not as bitter as it would later become. British pilots mapped the Siegfried Line while German troops waved at them. On 30 April 1940 when a German Heinkel He 111 bomber crashed at Clacton-on-Sea in Essex—killing its crew and injuring 160 people on the ground—the German crew members were laid to rest in the local cemetery with RAF support. Wreaths with messages of sympathy were displayed on the coffins.

When British Member of Parliament (MP) Leopold Amery suggested to Kingsley Wood, the Secretary of State for Air, that the Black Forest should be bombed with incendiaries to burn its ammunition dumps, Wood amazed the MP by responding that the forest was &quot;private property&quot; and could not be bombed; neither could weapons factories, as the Germans might do the same to England. In 1939, some officers of the British Expeditionary Force who were stationed in France tried to set up recreational hunting to pass the time. They imported packs of foxhounds and beagles, but were thwarted by French authorities who refused to make the countryside available.

==Winter War==

The Winter War started with the Soviet Union&#x27;s assault on Finland on 30 November 1939. Public opinion, particularly in France and Britain, quickly sided with Finland and demanded action from their governments in support of &quot;the brave Finns&quot; against the much larger Soviet aggressors. The public believed that effective defense of the Finns was more achievable than what had been provided for the Poles in the September Campaign.

As a consequence of its attack on Finland, the Soviet Union was expelled from the League of Nations, and a proposed Franco-British expedition to northern Scandinavia was debated. However, the British forces that were assembled to aid Finland were not dispatched in time before the Winter War ended. Instead, they were sent to Norway to help in its campaign against Germany. On 20 March, shortly after the Moscow Peace Treaty concluded the Winter War, Édouard Daladier resigned as Prime Minister of France, in part due to his failure to come to Finland&#x27;s defense.

==German invasion of Denmark and Norway==

In February 1940, Norway became a focus of attention as evidenced by the Altmark Incident. The Allies openly discussed a possible expedition to northern Scandinavia (even though they had not received a request or consent from the neutral Scandinavian countries) and the occupation of Norway. These developments alarmed the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and the Nazi government. Such an expedition would threaten their iron ore supplies and gave a strong argument for Germany to secure the Norwegian coast.

Codenamed Operation Weserübung, the German invasion of Denmark and Norway commenced on 9 April. From the 14th, Allied troops were landed in Norway, but by the end of the month, southern parts of Norway were in German hands. The fighting continued in the north until the Allies evacuated in early June in response to the German invasion of France; the Norwegian forces in mainland Norway laid down their arms at midnight on 9 June.

==Change of British government==


The debacle of the Allied campaign in Norway, which was actually an offshoot of the never-realised plans to aid Finland, forced a heated debate in the House of Commons during which Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was under constant attack. A nominal vote of confidence in his government was won by 281 to 200, but many of Chamberlain&#x27;s supporters had voted against him while others had abstained. Chamberlain found it impossible to continue to lead a National Government or to form a new coalition government with himself as the leader. So on 10 May, Chamberlain resigned the premiership but retained the leadership of the Conservative Party. Winston Churchill, who had been a consistent opponent of Chamberlain&#x27;s policy of appeasement, became Chamberlain&#x27;s successor. Churchill formed a new coalition government that included members of the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Party, as well as several ministers from a non-political background.

==Actions==
Throughout the Phoney War, most of the military clashes, such as the Battle of the Atlantic, occurred at sea. Among the notable incidents were:
* On 1 September 1939, the first day of the war, a German submarine sank the ship SS &quot;Athenia&quot;, killing 117 civilian passengers and crew.
* On 4 September 1939, British bombs killed eleven German sailors on the cruiser &quot;Emden&quot; in port Wilhelmshaven. On that same date, RAF daylight bombing raids on &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; warships in the Heligoland Bight proved a costly failure. Seven of the Bristol Blenheim and Vickers Wellington bombers were shot down without any ships being hit. Further ineffective anti-shipping raids—such as the air battle over the Wilhelmshaven naval base on 18 December 1939 which resulted in the loss of 12 out of 22 Wellingtons—led to the abandonment of daylight operations by RAF heavy bombers.
* On 17 September 1939, the British aircraft carrier was sunk by , the first British warship to be lost in the war. She went down in 15 minutes with the loss of 519 of her crew, including her captain.
* On 14 October 1939, the British battleship was sunk in the British fleet base at Scapa Flow, Orkney (north of mainland Scotland) by . A total of 833 men were lost, including Rear-Admiral Henry Blagrove, commander of the 2nd Battleship Division.
* On 16 October 1939, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; air raids on England began when Junkers Ju 88s attacked British warships at Rosyth on the Firth of Forth. Spitfires of 602 and 603 Squadrons succeeded in shooting down two Ju 88s and a Heinkel He 111 over the firth. In a raid on Scapa Flow the next day, one Ju 88 was hit by anti-aircraft fire, crashing on the island of Hoy. The first &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; plane to be shot down on the British mainland was a He 111 at Haddington, East Lothian, on 28 October, with both 602 and 603 Squadrons claiming this victory. 602 Squadron&#x27;s Archie McKellar was a principal pilot in both the destruction of the first German attacker over water and over British soil. McKellar (KIA 1 Nov. 1940) went on to be credited with 20 kills during the Battle of Britain, as well as &quot;ace in a day&quot; status by shooting down five Bf 109s; a feat accomplished by only 24 RAF pilots during the entire war.
* In December 1939, the German Deutschland-class cruiser was attacked by the Royal Navy cruisers , and in the Battle of the River Plate. &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; fled to the neutral port of Montevideo to carry out repairs on the damage sustained during the battle. She was later scuttled rather than face a large British fleet that the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; believed, incorrectly, was awaiting her departure. The support vessel for &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;, the tanker , was captured by the Royal Navy in February 1940 in southern Norway. &quot;(See: Battles of Narvik, Altmark Incident.)&quot;
* On 19 February 1940, a &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; destroyer flotilla embarked on Operation Wikinger, a sortie into the North Sea to disrupt British fishing and submarine activity around the Dogger Bank. En route, two destroyers were lost due to mines and friendly fire from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;; nearly 600 German sailors were killed and the mission was then aborted without ever encountering Allied forces.

British war planning had called for a &quot;knockout blow&quot; by strategic bombing of German industry with the RAF&#x27;s substantial Bomber Command. However, there was considerable apprehension about German retaliation, and when President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed a ban on bombing raids which might endanger civilians, Britain and France agreed at once, and Germany agreed two weeks later. The RAF therefore conducted a large number of combined reconnaissance and propaganda leaflet flights over Germany. These operations were jokingly termed &quot;pamphlet raids&quot; or &quot;Confetti War&quot; in the British press.

On 10 May 1940, eight months after the outbreak of war, German troops marched into Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, marking the end of the Phoney War and the beginning of the Battle of France.

Fascist Italy, hoping for territorial gains when France was defeated, entered the European war on 10 June 1940, although the thirty-two Italian divisions which crossed the border with France enjoyed little success against five defending French divisions.

<text>A slum is a highly populated urban residential area consisting of densely packed housing units of weak build quality and often associated with poverty. The infrastructure in slums is often deteriorated or incomplete, and they are primarily inhabited by impoverished people. Although slums are usually located in urban areas, in some countries they can be located in suburban areas where housing quality is low and living conditions are poor. While slums differ in size and other characteristics, most lack reliable sanitation services, supply of clean water, reliable electricity, law enforcement, and other basic services. Slum residences vary from shanty houses to professionally built dwellings which, because of poor-quality construction or lack of basic maintenance, have deteriorated.

Due to increasing urbanization of the general populace, slums became common in the 19th to late 20th centuries in the United States and Europe. Slums are still predominantly found in urban regions of developing countries, but are also still found in developed economies. The world&#x27;s largest slum city is found in Orangi in Karachi, Pakistan.

Slums form and grow in different parts of the world for many different reasons. Causes include rapid rural-to-urban migration, economic stagnation and depression, high unemployment, poverty, informal economy, forced or manipulated ghettoization, poor planning, politics, natural disasters, and social conflicts. Strategies tried to reduce and transform slums in different countries, with varying degrees of success, include a combination of slum removal, slum relocation, slum upgrading, urban planning with citywide infrastructure development, and public housing.

The UN defines slums as ... individuals living under the same roof lacking one or more of the following conditions: access to improved water, access to improved sanitation, sufficient living area, housing durability, and security of tenure

==Etymology and nomenclature==

It is thought that &quot;slum&quot; is a British slang word from the East End of London meaning &quot;room&quot;, which evolved to &quot;back slum&quot; around 1845 meaning &#x27;back alley, street of poor people.&#x27;

Numerous other non-English terms are often used interchangeably with &quot;slum&quot;: shanty town, favela, rookery, gecekondu, skid row, barrio, ghetto, banlieue, bidonville, taudis, bandas de miseria, barrio marginal, morro, paragkoupoli, loteamento, barraca, musseque, iskuwater, inner city, tugurio, solares, mudun safi, kawasan kumuh, karyan, medina achouaia, brarek, ishash, galoos, tanake, baladi, trushchoby, chalis, katras, zopadpattis, ftohogeitonia, basti, estero, looban, dagatan, umjondolo, watta, udukku, and chereka bete.

The word &quot;slum&quot; has negative connotations, and using this label for an area can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize that land use when hoping to repurpose it.

==History==


Before the 19th century, rich and poor people lived in the same districts, with the wealthy living on the high streets, and the poor in the service streets behind them. But in the 19th century, wealthy and upper-middle-class people began to move out of the central part of rapidly growing cities, leaving poorer residents behind.

Slums were common in the United States and Europe before the early 20th century. London&#x27;s East End is generally considered the locale where the term originated in the 19th century, where massive and rapid urbanization of the dockside and industrial areas led to intensive overcrowding in a warren of post-medieval streetscape. The suffering of the poor was described in popular fiction by moralist authors such as Charles Dickens – most famously &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1837-9) and echoed the Christian Socialist values of the time, which soon found legal expression in the Public Health Act 1848. As the slum clearance movement gathered pace, deprived areas such as Old Nichol were fictionalised to raise awareness in the middle classes in the form of moralist novels such as &quot;A Child of the Jago&quot; (1896) resulting in slum clearance and reconstruction programmes such as the Boundary Estate (1893-1900) and the creation of charitable trusts such as the Peabody Trust founded in 1862 and Joseph Rowntree Foundation (1904) which still operate to provide decent housing today.

Slums are often associated with the British Isles during the Victorian era, particularly in industrial towns. Friedrich Engels described these neighborhoods as &quot;cattle-sheds for human beings&quot;. These were generally still inhabited until the 1940s, when the British government started slum clearance and built new council houses. There are still examples left of slum housing in the UK, but many have been removed by government initiative, redesigned and replaced with better public housing.
In Europe, slums were common. By the 1920s it had become a common slang expression in England, meaning either various taverns and eating houses, &quot;loose talk&quot; or gypsy language, or a room with &quot;low going-ons&quot;. In &quot;Life in London&quot; (1821) Pierce Egan used the word in the context of the &quot;back slums&quot; of Holy Lane or St Giles. A footnote defined slum to mean &quot;low, unfrequent parts of the town&quot;. Charles Dickens used the word slum in a similar way in 1840, writing &quot;I mean to take a great, London, back-slum kind walk tonight&quot;. Slum began to be used to describe bad housing soon after and was used as alternative expression for rookeries. In 1850 the Catholic Cardinal Wiseman described the area known as Devil&#x27;s Acre in Westminster, London as follows:

Close under the Abbey of Westminster there lie concealed labyrinths of lanes and potty and alleys and slums, nests of ignorance, vice, depravity, and crime, as well as of squalor, wretchedness, and disease; whose atmosphere is typhus, whose ventilation is cholera; in which swarms of huge and almost countless population, nominally at least, Catholic; haunts of filth, which no sewage committee can reach – dark corners, which no lighting board can brighten.

This passage was widely quoted in the national press, leading to the popularization of the word &quot;slum&quot; to describe bad housing.

In France as in most industrialised European capitals, slums were widespread in Paris and other urban areas in the 19th century, many of which continued through first half of the 20th century. The first cholera epidemic of 1832 triggered a political debate, and Louis René Villermé study of various arrondissements of Paris demonstrated the differences and connection between slums, poverty and poor health. Melun Law first passed in 1849 and revised in 1851, followed by establishment of Paris Commission on Unhealthful Dwellings in 1852 began the social process of identifying the worst housing inside slums, but did not remove or replace slums. After World War II, French people started mass migration from rural to urban areas of France. This demographic and economic trend rapidly raised rents of existing housing as well as expanded slums. French government passed laws to block increase in the rent of housing, which inadvertently made many housing projects unprofitable and increased slums. In 1950, France launched its Habitation à Loyer Modéré initiative to finance and build public housing and remove slums, managed by techniciens – urban technocrats., and financed by Livret A – a tax free savings account for French public. Some slums remain in the early 21st century in France, most of which are dismantled after a few months, the largest being the &quot;Petite Ceinture&quot; slum on the northern Paris decommissioned train tracks.

New York City is believed to have created the United States&#x27; first slum, named the Five Points in 1825, as it evolved into a large urban settlement. Five Points was named for a lake named Collect. which, by the late 1700s, was surrounded by slaughterhouses and tanneries which emptied their waste directly into its waters. Trash piled up as well and by the early 1800s the lake was filled up and dry. On this foundation was built Five Points, the United States&#x27; first slum. Five Points was occupied by successive waves of freed slaves, Irish, then Italian, then Chinese, immigrants. It housed the poor, rural people leaving farms for opportunity, and the persecuted people from Europe pouring into New York City. Bars, bordellos, squalid and lightless tenements lined its streets. Violence and crime were commonplace. Politicians and social elite discussed it with derision. Slums like Five Points triggered discussions of affordable housing and slum removal. As of the start of the 21st century, Five Points slum had been transformed into the Little Italy and Chinatown neighborhoods of New York City, through that city&#x27;s campaign of massive urban renewal.

Five Points was not the only slum in America. Jacob Riis, Walker Evans, Lewis Hine and others photographed many before World War II. Slums were found in every major urban region of the United States throughout most of the 20th century, long after the Great Depression. Most of these slums had been ignored by the cities and states which encompassed them until the 1960s&#x27; War on Poverty was undertaken by the Federal government of the United States.

A type of slum housing, sometimes called poorhouses, crowded Boston Common, later at the fringes of the city.

Rio de Janeiro documented its first slum in 1920 census. By the 1960s, over 33% of population of Rio lived in slums, 45% of Mexico City and Ankara, 65% of Algiers, 35% of Caracas, 25% of Lima and Santiago, 15% of Singapore. By 1980, in various cities and towns of Latin America alone, there were about 25,000 slums.

==Causes that create and expand slums==
Slums sprout and continue for a combination of demographic, social, economic, and political reasons. Common causes include rapid rural-to-urban migration, poor planning, economic stagnation and depression, poverty, high unemployment, informal economy, colonialism and segregation, politics, natural disasters and social conflicts.

===Rural–urban migration===
Rural–urban migration is one of the causes attributed to the formation and expansion of slums. Since 1950, world population has increased at a far greater rate than the total amount of arable land, even as agriculture contributes a much smaller percentage of the total economy. For example, in India, agriculture accounted for 52% of its GDP in 1954 and only 19% in 2004; in Brazil, the 2050 GDP contribution of agriculture is one-fifth of its contribution in 1951. Agriculture, meanwhile, has also become higher yielding, less disease prone, less physically harsh and more efficient with tractors and other equipment. The proportion of people working in agriculture has declined by 30% over the last 50 years, while global population has increased by 250%.

Many people move to urban areas primarily because cities promise more jobs, better schools for poor&#x27;s children, and diverse income opportunities than subsistence farming in rural areas. For example, in 1995, 95.8% of migrants to Surabaya, Indonesia reported that jobs were their primary motivation for moving to the city. However, some rural migrants may not find jobs immediately because of their lack of skills and the increasingly competitive job markets, which leads to their financial shortage. Many cities, on the other hand, do not provide enough low-cost housing for a large number of rural-urban migrant workers. Some rural–urban migrant workers cannot afford housing in cities and eventually settle down in only affordable slums. Further, rural migrants, mainly lured by higher incomes, continue to flood into cities. They thus expand the existing urban slums.

According to Ali and Toran, social networks might also explain rural–urban migration and people&#x27;s ultimate settlement in slums. In addition to migration for jobs, a portion of people migrate to cities because of their connection with relatives or families. Once their family support in urban areas is in slums, those rural migrants intend to live with them in slums

===Urbanization===

The formation of slums is closely linked to urbanization. In 2008, more than 50% of the world&#x27;s population lived in urban areas. In China, for example, it is estimated that the population living in urban areas will increase by 10% within a decade according to its current rates of urbanization. The UN-Habitat reports that 43% of urban population in developing countries and 78% of those in the least developed countries are slum dwellers.

Some scholars suggest that urbanization creates slums because local governments are unable to manage urbanization, and migrant workers without an affordable place to live in, dwell in slums. Rapid urbanization drives economic growth and causes people to seek working and investment opportunities in urban areas. However, as evidenced by poor urban infrastructure and insufficient housing, the local governments sometimes are unable to manage this transition. This incapacity can be attributed to insufficient funds and inexperience to handle and organize problems brought by migration and urbanization. In some cases, local governments ignore the flux of immigrants during the process of urbanization. Such examples can be found in many African countries. In the early 1950s, many African governments believed that slums would finally disappear with economic growth in urban areas. They neglected rapidly spreading slums due to increased rural-urban migration caused by urbanization. Some governments, moreover, mapped the land where slums occupied as undeveloped land.

Another type of urbanization does not involve economic growth but economic stagnation or low growth, mainly contributing to slum growth in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. This type of urbanization involves a high rate of unemployment, insufficient financial resources and inconsistent urban planning policy. In these areas, an increase of 1% in urban population will result in an increase of 1.84% in slum prevalence.

Urbanization might also force some people to live in slums when it influences land use by transforming agricultural land into urban areas and increases land value. During the process of urbanization, some agricultural land is used for additional urban activities. More investment will come into these areas, which increases the land value. Before some land is completely urbanized, there is a period when the land can be used for neither urban activities nor agriculture. The income from the land will decline, which decreases the people&#x27;s incomes in that area. The gap between people&#x27;s low income and the high land price forces some people to look for and construct cheap informal settlements, which are known as slums in urban areas. The transformation of agricultural land also provides surplus labour, as peasants have to seek jobs in urban areas as rural-urban migrant workers.

Many slums are part of economies of agglomeration in which there is an emergence of economies of scale at the firm level, transport costs and the mobility of the industrial labour force. The increase in returns of scale will mean that the production of each good will take place in a single location. And even though an agglomerated economy benefits these cities by bringing in specialization and multiple competing suppliers, the conditions of slums continue to lag behind in terms of quality and adequate housing. Alonso-Villar argues that the existence of transport costs implies that the best locations for a firm will be those with easy access to markets, and the best locations for workers, those with easy access to goods. The concentration is the result of a self-reinforcing process of agglomeration. Concentration is a common trend of the distribution of population. Urban growth is dramatically intense in the less developed countries, where a large number of huge cities have started to appear; which means high poverty rates, crime, pollution and congestion.

=== Poor house planning ===

Lack of affordable low-cost housing and poor planning encourages the supply side of slums. The Millennium Development Goals proposes that member nations should make a &quot;significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers&quot; by 2020. If member nations succeed in achieving this goal, 90% of the world total slum dwellers may remain in the poorly housed settlements by 2020. Choguill claims that the large number of slum dwellers indicates a deficiency of practical housing policy. Whenever there is a significant gap in growing demand for housing and insufficient supply of affordable housing, this gap is typically met in part by slums. &quot;The Economist&quot; has observed that &quot;good housing is obviously better than a slum, but a slum is better than none&quot;.

Insufficient financial resources and lack of coordination in government bureaucracy are two main causes of poor house planning. Financial deficiency in some governments may explain the lack of affordable public housing for the poor since any improvement of the tenant in slums and expansion of public housing programs involve a great increase in the government expenditure. The problem can also lie on the failure in coordination among different departments in charge of economic development, urban planning, and land allocation. In some cities, governments assume that the housing market will adjust the supply of housing with a change in demand. However, with little economic incentive, the housing market is more likely to develop middle-income housing rather than low-cost housing. The urban poor gradually become marginalized in the housing market where few houses are built to sell to them.

===Colonialism and segregation===
Some of the slums in today&#x27;s world are a product of urbanization brought by colonialism. For instance, the Europeans arrived in Kenya in the nineteenth century and created urban centers such as Nairobi mainly to serve their financial interests. They regarded the Africans as temporary migrants and needed them only for supply of labour. The housing policy aiming to accommodate these workers was not well enforced and the government built settlements in the form of single-occupancy bedspaces. Due to the cost of time and money in their movement back and forth between rural and urban areas, their families gradually migrated to the urban centre. As they could not afford to buy houses, slums were thus formed.

Others were created because of segregation imposed by the colonialists. For example, Dharavi slum of Mumbai – now one of the largest slums in India, used to be a village referred to as Koliwadas, and Mumbai used to be referred as Bombay. In 1887, the British colonial government expelled all tanneries, other noxious industry and poor natives who worked in the peninsular part of the city and colonial housing area, to what was back then the northern fringe of the city – a settlement now called Dharavi. This settlement attracted no colonial supervision or investment in terms of road infrastructure, sanitation, public services or housing. The poor moved into Dharavi, found work as servants in colonial offices and homes and in the foreign owned tanneries and other polluting industries near Dharavi. To live, the poor built shanty towns within easy commute to work. By 1947, the year India became an independent nation of the commonwealth, Dharavi had blossomed into Bombay&#x27;s largest slum.

Similarly, some of the slums of Lagos, Nigeria sprouted because of neglect and policies of the colonial era. During apartheid era of South Africa, under the pretext of sanitation and plague epidemic prevention, racial and ethnic group segregation was pursued, people of colour were moved to the fringes of the city, policies that created Soweto and other slums – officially called townships. Large slums started at the fringes of segregation-conscious colonial city centers of Latin America. Marcuse suggests ghettoes in the United States, and elsewhere, have been created and maintained by the segregationist policies of the state and regionally dominant group.

===Poor infrastructure, social exclusion and economic stagnation===
Social exclusion and poor infrastructure forces the poor to adapt to conditions beyond his or her control. Poor families that cannot afford transportation, or those who simply lack any form of affordable public transportation, generally end up in squat settlements within walking distance or close enough to the place of their formal or informal employment. Ben Arimah cites this social exclusion and poor infrastructure as a cause for numerous slums in African cities. Poor quality, unpaved streets encourage slums; a 1% increase in paved all-season roads, claims Arimah, reduces slum incidence rate by about 0.35%. Affordable public transport and economic infrastructure empowers poor people to move and consider housing options other than their current slums.

A growing economy that creates jobs at rate faster than population growth, offers people opportunities and incentive to relocate from poor slum to more developed neighborhoods. Economic stagnation, in contrast, creates uncertainties and risks for the poor, encouraging people to stay in the slums. Economic stagnation in a nation with a growing population reduces per capita disposal income in urban and rural areas, increasing urban and rural poverty. Rising rural poverty also encourages migration to urban areas. A poorly performing economy, in other words, increases poverty and rural-to-urban migration, thereby increasing slums.

===Informal economy===
Many slums grow because of growing informal economy which creates demand for workers. Informal economy is that part of an economy that is neither registered as a business nor licensed, one that does not pay taxes and is not monitored by local, state, or federal government. Informal economy grows faster than formal economy when government laws and regulations are opaque and excessive, government bureaucracy is corrupt and abusive of entrepreneurs, labour laws are inflexible, or when law enforcement is poor. Urban informal sector is between 20 and 60% of most developing economies&#x27; GDP; in Kenya, 78 per cent of non-agricultural employment is in the informal sector making up 42 per cent of GDP. In many cities the informal sector accounts for as much as 60 per cent of employment of the urban population. For example, in Benin, slum dwellers comprise 75 per cent of informal sector workers, while in Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Chad and Ethiopia, they make up 90 per cent of the informal labour force. Slums thus create an informal alternate economic ecosystem, that demands low paid flexible workers, something impoverished residents of slums deliver. In other words, countries where starting, registering and running a formal business is difficult, tend to encourage informal businesses and slums. Without a sustainable formal economy that raise incomes and create opportunities, squalid slums are likely to continue.
The World Bank and UN Habitat estimate, assuming no major economic reforms are undertaken, more than 80% of additional jobs in urban areas of developing world may be low-paying jobs in the informal sector. Everything else remaining same, this explosive growth in the informal sector is likely to be accompanied by a rapid growth of slums.

=== Labour, work ===

Research in the latest years based on ethnographic studies, conducted since 2008 about slums, published initially in 2017, has found out the primary importance of labour as the main cause of emergence, rural-urban migration, consolidation and growth of informal settlements. It also showed that work has also a crucial role in the self-construction of houses, alleys and overall informal planning of slums, as well as constituting a central aspect by residents living in slums when their communities suffer upgrading schemes or when they are resettled to formal housing.

For example, it was recently proved that in a small favela in the northeast of Brazil (Favela Sururu de Capote), the migration of dismissed sugar cane factory workers to the city of Maceió (who initiated the self-construction of the favela), has been driven by the necessity to find a job in the city. The same observation was noticed on the new migrants who contribute to the consolidation and growth of the slum. Also, the choice of the terrain for the construction of the favela (the margins of a lagoon) followed the rationale that it could offer conditions to provide them means of work. Circa 80% of residents living in that community live from the fishery of a mussel which divides the community through gender and age. Alleys and houses were planned to facilitate the working activities, that provided subsistence and livelihood to the community. When resettled, the main reason of changes of formal housing units was due to the lack of possibilities to perform their work in the new houses designed according to formal architecture principles, or even by the distances they had to travel to work in the slum where they originally lived, which was in turn faced by residents by self-constructing spaces to shelter the work originally performed in the slum, in the formal housing units. Similar observations were made in other slums. Residents also reported that their work constitutes their dignity, citizenship, and self-esteem in the underprivileged settings in which they live. The reflection of this recent research was possible due to participatory observations and the fact that the author of the research has lived in a slum to verify the socioeconomic practices which were prone to shape, plan and govern space in slums.

===Poverty===
Urban poverty encourages the formation and demand for slums. With rapid shift from rural to urban life, poverty migrates to urban areas. The urban poor arrives with hope, and very little of anything else. They typically have no access to shelter, basic urban services and social amenities. Slums are often the only option for the urban poor.
===Politics===
Many local and national governments have, for political interests, subverted efforts to remove, reduce or upgrade slums into better housing options for the poor. Throughout the second half of the 19th century, for example, French political parties relied on votes from slum population and had vested interests in maintaining that voting block. Removal and replacement of slum created a conflict of interest, and politics prevented efforts to remove, relocate or upgrade the slums into housing projects that are better than the slums. Similar dynamics are cited in favelas of Brazil, slums of India, and shanty towns of Kenya.
Scholars claim politics also drives rural-urban migration and subsequent settlement patterns. Pre-existing patronage networks, sometimes in the form of gangs and other times in the form of political parties or social activists, inside slums seek to maintain their economic, social and political power. These social and political groups have vested interests to encourage migration by ethnic groups that will help maintain the slums, and reject alternate housing options even if the alternate options are better in every aspect than the slums they seek to replace.

===Social conflicts===
Millions of Lebanese people formed slums during the Lebanese Civil War from 1975 to 1990. Similarly, in recent years, numerous slums have sprung around Kabul to accommodate rural Afghans escaping Taliban violence.

===Natural disasters===
Major natural disasters in poor nations often lead to migration of disaster-affected families from areas crippled by the disaster to unaffected areas, the creation of temporary tent city and slums, or expansion of existing slums. These slums tend to become permanent because the residents do not want to leave, as in the case of slums near Port-au-Prince after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and slums near Dhaka after 2007 Bangladesh Cyclone Sidr.

==Slums in developing countries==
===Location and growth===
Slums typically begin at the outskirts of a city. Over time, the city may expand past the original slums, enclosing the slums inside the urban perimeter. New slums sprout at the new boundaries of the expanding city, usually on publicly owned lands, thereby creating an urban sprawl mix of formal settlements, industry, retail zones and slums. This makes the original slums valuable property, densely populated with many conveniences attractive to the poor.

At their start, slums are typically located in the least desirable lands near the town or city, that are state owned, are part of a philanthropic trust, possessed by a religious entity, or have no clear land title. In cities located in mountainous terrain, slums begin on difficult to reach slopes or start at the bottom of flood prone valleys, often hidden from the plain view of downtown but close to some natural water source. In cities located near lagoons, marshlands and rivers, they start on banks or on stilts above water or the dry river bed; in flat terrain, slums begin on lands unsuitable for agriculture, near city trash dumps, next to railway tracks, and other shunned undesirable locations.

These strategies shield slums from the risk of being noticed and removed when they are small and most vulnerable to local government officials. Initial homes tend to be tents and shacks that are quick to install, but as a slum grows, becomes established and newcomers pay the informal association or gang for the right to live in the slum, the construction materials for the slums switches to more durable materials such as bricks and concrete, suitable for slum&#x27;s topography.

The original slums, over time, get established next to centers of economic activity, schools, hospitals, and sources of employment, which the poor rely on. Established old slums, surrounded by the formal city infrastructure, cannot expand horizontally; therefore, they grow vertically by stacking additional rooms, sometimes for a growing family and sometimes as a source of rent from new arrivals in slums. Some slums name themselves after founders of political parties, locally respected historical figures, current politicians or a politician&#x27;s spouse to garner political backing against eviction.

===Insecure tenure===
Informality of land tenure is a key characteristic of urban slums. At their start, slums are typically located in undesirable lands near the town or city, that are state owned or philanthropic trust owned or religious entity owned or have no clear land title. Some immigrants regard unoccupied land as land without owners and therefore occupy it. In some cases the local community or the government allots lands to people, which will later develop into slums and over which the dwellers don&#x27;t have property rights. Informal land tenure also includes occupation of land belonging to someone else. According to Flood, 51 percent of slums are based on invasion of private land in sub-Saharan Africa, 39 percent in North Africa and West Asia, 10 percent in South Asia, 40 percent in East Asia, and 40 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean. In some cases, once the slum has many residents, the early residents form a social group, an informal association or a gang that controls newcomers, charges a fee for the right to live in the slums, and dictates where and how new homes get built within the slum. The newcomers, having paid for the right, feel they have commercial right to the home in that slum. The slum dwellings, built as the slum grows, are constructed without checking land ownership rights or building codes, are not registered with the city, and often not recognized by the city or state governments.

Secure land tenure is important for slum dwellers as an authentic recognition of their residential status in urban areas. It also encourages them to upgrade their housing facilities, which will give them protection against natural and unnatural hazards. Undocumented ownership with no legal title to the land also prevents slum settlers from applying for mortgage, which might worsen their financial situations. In addition, without registration of the land ownership, the government has difficulty in upgrading basic facilities and improving the living environment. Insecure tenure of the slum, as well as a lack of socially and politically acceptable alternatives to slums, also creates difficulty in citywide infrastructure development such as rapid mass transit, electrical and sewer pipe layout, highways and roads.

===Substandard housing and overcrowding===

Slum areas are characterized by substandard housing structures. Shanty homes are often built hurriedly, on ad hoc basis, with materials unsuitable for housing. Often the construction quality is inadequate to withstand heavy rains, high winds, or other local climate and location. Paper, plastic, earthen floors, mud-and-wattle walls, wood held together by ropes, straw or torn metal pieces as roofs are some of the materials of construction. In some cases, brick and cement is used, but without attention to proper design and structural engineering requirements. Various space, dwelling placement bylaws and local building codes may also be extensively violated.

Overcrowding is another characteristic of slums. Many dwellings are single room units, with high occupancy rates. Each dwelling may be cohabited by multiple families. Five and more persons may share a one-room unit; the room is used for cooking, sleeping and living. Overcrowding is also seen near sources of drinking water, cleaning, and sanitation where one toilet may serve dozens of families. In a slum of Kolkata, India, over 10 people sometimes share a 45 m2 room. In Kibera slum of Nairobi, Kenya, population density is estimated at 2,000 people per hectare — or about 500,000 people in one square mile.

However, the density and neighbourhood effects of slum populations may also offer an opportunity to target health interventions.

===Inadequate or no infrastructure===

One of the identifying characteristics of slums is the lack of or inadequate public infrastructure. From safe drinking water to electricity, from basic health care to police services, from affordable public transport to fire/ambulance services, from sanitation sewer to paved roads, new slums usually lack all of these. Established, old slums sometimes garner official support and get some of these infrastructure such as paved roads and unreliable electricity or water supply. Slums usually lack street addresses, which creates further problems.

Slums often have very narrow alleys that do not allow vehicles (including emergency vehicles) to pass. The lack of services such as routine garbage collection allows rubbish to accumulate in huge quantities. The lack of infrastructure is caused by the informal nature of settlement and no planning for the poor by government officials. Fires are often a serious problem.

In many countries, local and national government often refuse to recognize slums, because the slum are on disputed land, or because of the fear that quick official recognition will encourage more slum formation and seizure of land illegally. Recognizing and notifying slums often triggers a creation of property rights, and requires that the government provide public services and infrastructure to the slum residents. With poverty and informal economy, slums do not generate tax revenues for the government and therefore tend to get minimal or slow attention. In other cases, the narrow and haphazard layout of slum streets, houses and substandard shacks, along with persistent threat of crime and violence against infrastructure workers, makes it difficult to layout reliable, safe, cost effective and efficient infrastructure. In yet others, the demand far exceeds the government bureaucracy&#x27;s ability to deliver.

Low socioeconomic status of its residents is another common characteristic attributed to slum residents.

==Problems==
===Vulnerability to natural and man-made hazards===
Slums are often placed in areas vulnerable to natural disasters such as landslides and floods. In cities located in mountainous terrain, slums begin on slopes difficult to reach or start at the bottom of flood-prone valleys, often hidden from plain view in the city center but close to some natural water source. In cities located near lagoons, marshlands and rivers, they start at banks or on stilts above water or the dry river bed; in flat terrain, slums begin on lands unsuitable for agriculture, near city trash dumps, next to railway tracks, and other shunned, undesirable locations. These strategies shield slums from the risk of being noticed and removed when they are small and most vulnerable to local government officials. However, the ad hoc construction, lack of quality control on building materials used, poor maintenance, and uncoordinated spatial design make them prone to extensive damage during earthquakes as well from decay. These risks will be intensified by climate change.
Some slums risk man-made hazards such as toxic industries, traffic congestion and collapsing infrastructure. Fires are another major risk to slums and its inhabitants, with streets often too narrow to allow proper and quick access to fire control trucks.

===Unemployment and informal economy===
Due to lack of skills and education as well as competitive job markets, many slum dwellers face high rates of unemployment. The limit of job opportunities causes many of them to employ themselves in the informal economy, inside the slum or in developed urban areas near the slum. This can sometimes be licit informal economy or illicit informal economy without working contract or any social security. Some of them are seeking jobs at the same time and some of those will eventually find jobs in formal economies after gaining some professional skills in informal sectors.

Examples of licit informal economy include street vending, household enterprises, product assembly and packaging, making garlands and embroideries, domestic work, shoe polishing or repair, driving tuk-tuk or manual rickshaws, construction workers or manually driven logistics, and handicrafts production. In some slums, people sort and recycle trash of different kinds (from household garbage to electronics) for a living – selling either the odd usable goods or stripping broken goods for parts or raw materials. Typically these licit informal economies require the poor to regularly pay a bribe to local police and government officials.
Examples of illicit informal economy include illegal substance and weapons trafficking, drug or moonshine/changaa production, prostitution and gambling – all sources of risks to the individual, families and society. Recent reports reflecting illicit informal economies include drug trade and distribution in Brazil&#x27;s &quot;favelas&quot;, production of fake goods in the &quot;colonías&quot; of Tijuana, smuggling in &quot;katchi abadis&quot; and slums of Karachi, or production of synthetic drugs in the &quot;townships&quot; of Johannesburg.

The slum-dwellers in informal economies run many risks. The informal sector, by its very nature, means income insecurity and lack of social mobility. There is also absence of legal contracts, protection of labour rights, regulations and bargaining power in informal employments.

===Violence===

Some scholars suggest that crime is one of the main concerns in slums. Empirical data suggest crime rates are higher in some slums than in non-slums, with slum homicides alone reducing life expectancy of a resident in a Brazil slum by 7 years than for a resident in nearby non-slum. In some countries like Venezuela, officials have sent in the military to control slum criminal violence involved with drugs and weapons. Rape is another serious issue related to crime in slums. In Nairobi slums, for example, one-fourth of all teenage girls are raped each year.

On the other hand, while UN-Habitat reports some slums are more exposed to crimes with higher crime rates (for instance, the traditional inner-city slums), crime is not the direct resultant of block layout in many slums. Rather crime is one of the symptoms of slum dwelling; thus slums consist of more victims than criminals. Consequently, slums do not always have consistently high crime rates, as the worst crime rates exist in sectors maintaining influence of illicit economy—such as drug trafficking, brewing, prostitution, and gambling. Often in such circumstances, multiple gangs fight for control over revenue.

Slum crime rate correlates with insufficient law enforcement and inadequate public policing. In main cities of developing countries, law enforcement lags behind urban growth and slum expansion. Often police can not reduce crime because, due to ineffective city planning and governance, slums set inefficient crime prevention system. Such problems is not primarily due to community indifference. Leads and information intelligence from slums are rare, streets are narrow and a potential death traps to patrol, and many in the slum community have an inherent distrust of authorities from fear ranging from eviction to collection on unpaid utility bills to general law and order. Lack of formal recognition by the governments also leads to few formal policing and public justice institutions in slums.

Women in slums are at greater risk of physical and sexual violence. Factors such as unemployment that lead to insufficient resources in the household can increase marital stress and therefore exacerbate domestic violence.

Slums are often non-secured areas and women often risk sexual violence when they walk alone in slums late at night. Violence against women and women&#x27;s security in slums emerge as recurrent issues.

Another prevalent form of violence in slums is armed violence (gun violence), mostly existing in African and Latin American slums. It leads to homicide and the emergence of criminal gangs. Typical victims are male slum residents. Violence often leads to retaliatory and vigilante violence within the slum. Gang and drug wars are endemic in some slums, predominantly between male residents of slums. The police sometimes participate in gender-based violence against men as well by picking up some men, beating them and putting them in jail. Domestic violence against men also exists in slums, including verbal abuses and even physical violence from households.

Cohen as well as Merton theorized that the cycle of slum violence does not mean slums are inevitably criminogenic, rather in some cases it is frustration against life in slum, and a consequence of denial of opportunity to slum residents to leave the slum.

===Infectious diseases and epidemics===
Slum dwellers usually experience a high rate of disease. Diseases that have been reported in slums include cholera, HIV/AIDS, measles, malaria, dengue, typhoid, drug resistant tuberculosis, and other epidemics. Studies focus on children&#x27;s health in slums address that cholera and diarrhea are especially common among young children. Besides children&#x27;s vulnerability to diseases, many scholars also focus on high HIV/AIDS prevalence in slums among women. Throughout slum areas in various parts of the world, infectious diseases are a significant contributor to high mortality rates. For example, according to a study in Nairobi&#x27;s slums, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis attributed to about 50% of the mortality burden.

Factors that have been attributed to a higher rate of disease transmission in slums include high population densities, poor living conditions, low vaccination rates, insufficient health-related data and inadequate health service. Overcrowding leads to faster and wider spread of diseases due to the limited space in slum housing. Poor living conditions also make slum dwellers more vulnerable to certain diseases. Poor water quality, a manifest example, is a cause of many major illnesses including malaria, diarrhea and trachoma. Improving living conditions such as introduction of better sanitation and access to basic facilities can ameliorate the effects of diseases, such as cholera.

Slums have been historically linked to epidemics, and this trend has continued in modern times. For example, the slums of West African nations such as Liberia were crippled by as well as contributed to the outbreak and spread of Ebola in 2014. Slums are considered a major public health concern and potential breeding grounds of drug resistant diseases for the entire city, the nation, as well as the global community.

===Child malnutrition===
Child malnutrition is more common in slums than in non-slum areas. In Mumbai and New Delhi, 47% and 51% of slum children under the age of five are stunted and 35% and 36% of them are underweight. These children all suffer from third-degree malnutrition, the most severe level, according to WHO standards. A study conducted by Tada et al. in Bangkok slums illustrates that in terms of weight-forage, 25.4% of the children who participated in the survey suffered from malnutrition, compared to around 8% national malnutrition prevalence in Thailand. In Ethiopia and the Niger, rates of child malnutrition in urban slums are around 40%.

The major nutritional problems in slums are protein-energy malnutrition (PEM), vitamin A deficiency (VAD), iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and iodine deficiency disorders (IDD). Malnutrition can sometimes lead to death among children. Dr. Abhay Bang&#x27;s report shows that malnutrition kills 56,000 children annually in urban slums in India.

Widespread child malnutrition in slums is closely related to family income, mothers&#x27; food practice, mothers&#x27; educational level, and maternal employment or housewifery. Poverty may result in inadequate food intake when people cannot afford to buy and store enough food, which leads to malnutrition. Another common cause is mothers&#x27; faulty feeding practices, including inadequate breastfeeding and wrongly preparation of food for children. Tada et al.&#x27;s study in Bangkok slums shows that around 64% of the mothers sometimes fed their children instant food instead of a normal meal. And about 70% of the mothers did not provide their children three meals every day. Mothers&#x27; lack of education leads to their faulty feeding practices. Many mothers in slums don&#x27;t have knowledge on food nutrition for children. Maternal employment also influences children&#x27;s nutritional status. For the mothers who work outside, their children are prone to be malnourished. These children are likely to be neglected by their mothers or sometimes not carefully looked after by their female relatives.

=== Other non-communicable diseases ===
A multitude of non-contagious diseases also impact health for slum residents. Examples of prevalent non-infectious diseases include: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, neurological disorders, and mental illness. In some slum areas of India, diarrhea is a significant health problem among children. Factors like poor sanitation, low literacy rates, and limited awareness make diarrhea and other dangerous diseases extremely prevalent and burdensome on the community.

Lack of reliable data also has a negative impact on slum dwellers&#x27; health. A number of slum families do not report cases or seek professional medical care, which results in insufficient data. This might prevent appropriate allocation of health care resources in slum areas since many countries base their health care plans on data from clinic, hospital, or national mortality registry. Moreover, health service is insufficient or inadequate in most of the world&#x27;s slums. Emergency ambulance service and urgent care services are typically unavailable, as health service providers sometimes avoid servicing slums. A study shows that more than half of slum dwellers are prone to visit private practitioners or seek self-medication with medicines available in the home. Private practitioners in slums are usually those who are unlicensed or poorly trained and they run clinics and pharmacies mainly for the sake of money. The categorization of slum health by the government and census data also has an effect on the distribution and allocation of health resources in inner city areas. A significant portion of city populations face challenges with access to health care but do not live in locations that are described as within the &quot;slum&quot; area.

Overall, a complex network of physical, social, and environmental factors contribute to the health threats faced by slum residents.

==Countermeasures==

Recent years have seen a dramatic growth in the number of slums as urban populations have increased in developing countries. Nearly a billion people worldwide live in slums, and some project the figure may grow to 2 billion by 2030 if governments and the global community ignore slums and continue current urban policies. United Nations Habitat group believes change is possible.

Some NGO&#x27;s are focused at addressing local problems (i.e. sanitation issues, health, ...), through the mapping out of the slums and its health services, creation of latrines, creation of local food production projects, and even microcredit projects. In one project (in Rio de Janeiro), the government even employed slum residents for the reforestation of a nearby location.

To achieve the goal of &quot;cities without slums&quot;, the UN claims that governments must undertake vigorous urban planning, city management, infrastructure development, slum upgrading and poverty reduction. 

===Slum removal===
Some city and state officials have simply sought to remove slums. This strategy for dealing with slums is rooted in the fact that slums typically start illegally on someone else&#x27;s land property, and they are not recognized by the state. As the slum started by violating another&#x27;s property rights, the residents have no legal claim to the land.

Critics argue that slum removal by force tend to ignore the social problems that cause slums. The poor children as well as working adults of a city&#x27;s informal economy need a place to live. Slum clearance removes the slum, but it does not remove the causes that create and maintain the slum. Policymakers, urban planners, and politicians need to take the factors that cause people to live in informal housing into consideration while tackling the issue of slums.

===Slum relocation===
Slum relocation strategies rely on removing the slums and relocating the slum poor to free semi-rural peripheries of cities, sometimes in free housing. An example of this is the governmental program in Morocco called &quot;Cities without Shantytowns&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;Cities without Slums&quot; or, in French, &quot;Villes Sans Bidonvilles&quot;), which was launched to put an end to informal housing and resettle the communities in slums into apartments.

This strategy ignores several dimensions of a slum life. The strategy sees slum as merely a place where the poor lives. In reality, slums are often integrated with every aspect of a slum resident&#x27;s life, including sources of employment, distance from work, and social life. Slum relocation that displaces the poor from opportunities to earn a livelihood, generates economic insecurity in the poor. In some cases, the slum residents oppose relocation even if the replacement land and housing to the outskirts of cities is of better quality than their current house. Examples include Zone One Tondo Organization of Manila, Philippines, and Abahlali base Mjondolo of Durban, South Africa. In other cases, such as Ennakhil slum relocation project in Morocco, systematic social mediation has worked. The slum residents have been convinced that their current location is a health hazard, prone to natural disaster, or that the alternative location is well connected to employment opportunities.

===Slum upgrading===
Some governments have begun to approach slums as a possible opportunity to urban development by slum upgrading. This approach was inspired in part by the theoretical writings of John Turner in 1972. The approach seeks to upgrade the slum with basic infrastructure such as sanitation, safe drinking water, safe electricity distribution, paved roads, rain water drainage system, and bus/metro stops. The assumption behind this approach is that if slums are given basic services and tenure security – that is, the slum will not be destroyed and slum residents will not be evicted, then the residents will rebuild their own housing, engage their slum community to live better, and over time attract investment from government organizations and businesses. Turner argued not to demolish the housing, but to improve the environment: if governments can clear existing slums of unsanitary human waste, polluted water and litter, and from muddy unlit lanes, they do not have to worry about the shanty housing. &quot;Squatters&quot; have shown great organizational skills in terms of land management, and they will maintain the infrastructure that is provided.

In Mexico City for example, the government attempted to upgrade and urbanize settled slums in the periphery during the 1970s and 1980s by including basic amenities such as concrete roads, parks, illumination and sewage. Currently, most slums in Mexico City face basic characteristics of traditional slums, characterized to some extent in housing, population density, crime and poverty, however, the vast majority of its inhabitants have access to basic amenities and most areas are connected to major roads and completely urbanized. Nevertheless, smaller settlements lacking these can still be found in the periphery of the city and its inhabitants are known as &quot;paracaidistas&quot;. A more recent example of slum-upgrading approach is PRIMED initiative in Medellin, Colombia, where streets, Metrocable transportation and other public infrastructure has been added. These slum infrastructure upgrades were combined with city infrastructure upgrade such as addition of metro, paved roads and highways to empower all city residents including the poor with reliable access throughout city.

Most slum upgrading projects, however, have produced mixed results. While initial evaluations were promising and success stories widely reported by media, evaluations done 5 to 10 years after a project completion have been disappointing. Herbert Werlin notes that the initial benefits of slum upgrading efforts have been ephemeral. The slum upgrading projects in &quot;kampungs&quot; of Jakarta, Indonesia, for example, looked promising in first few years after upgrade, but thereafter returned to a condition worse than before, particularly in terms of sanitation, environmental problems and safety of drinking water. Communal toilets provided under slum upgrading effort were poorly maintained, and abandoned by slum residents of Jakarta. Similarly slum upgrading efforts in Philippines, India and Brazil have proven to be excessively more expensive than initially estimated, and the condition of the slums 10 years after completion of slum upgrading has been slum like. The anticipated benefits of slum upgrading, claims Werlin, have proven to be a myth. There is limited but consistent evidence that slums upgrading may prevent diarrhoeal diseases and water-related expenditure.

Slum upgrading is largely a government controlled, funded and run process, rather than a competitive market driven process. Krueckeberg and Paulsen note conflicting politics, government corruption and street violence in slum regularization process is part of the reality. Slum upgrading and tenure regularization also upgrade and regularize the slum bosses and political agendas, while threatening the influence and power of municipal officials and ministries. Slum upgrading does not address poverty, low paying jobs from informal economy, and other characteristics of slums. Recent research shows that the lack of these options make residents to undertake measures to assure their working needs. One example in the northeast of Brazil, Vila S. Pedro, was mischaracterized by informal self-constructions by residents to restore working opportunities originally employed in the informal settlement. It is unclear whether slum upgrading can lead to long-term sustainable improvement to slums.

===Urban infrastructure development and public housing===
Urban infrastructure such as reliable high speed mass transit system, motorways/interstates, and public housing projects have been cited as responsible for the disappearance of major slums in the United States and Europe from the 1960s through 1970s. Charles Pearson argued in UK Parliament that mass transit would enable London to reduce slums and relocate slum dwellers. His proposal was initially rejected for lack of land and other reasons; but Pearson and others persisted with creative proposals such as building the mass transit under the major roads already in use and owned by the city. London Underground was born, and its expansion has been credited to reducing slums in respective cities (and to an extent, the New York City Subway&#x27;s smaller expansion).

As cities expanded and business parks scattered due to cost ineffectiveness, people moved to live in the suburbs; thus retail, logistics, house maintenance and other businesses followed demand patterns. City governments used infrastructure investments and urban planning to distribute work, housing, green areas, retail, schools and population densities. Affordable public mass transit in cities such as New York City, London and Paris allowed the poor to reach areas where they could earn a livelihood. Public and council housing projects cleared slums and provided more sanitary housing options than what existed before the 1950s.

Slum clearance became a priority policy in Europe between 1950–1970s, and one of the biggest state-led programs. In the UK, the slum clearance effort was bigger in scale than the formation of British Railways, the National Health Service and other state programs. UK Government data suggests the clearances that took place after 1955 demolished about 1.5 million slum properties, resettling about 15% of UK&#x27;s population out of these properties. Similarly, after 1950, Denmark and others pursued parallel initiatives to clear slums and resettle the slum residents.

The US and European governments additionally created a procedure by which the poor could directly apply to the government for housing assistance, thus becoming a partner to identifying and meeting the housing needs of its citizens. One historically effective approach to reduce and prevent slums has been citywide infrastructure development combined with affordable, reliable public mass transport and public housing projects.

However, slum relocation in the name of urban development is criticized for uprooting communities without consultation or consideration of ongoing livelihood. For example, the Sabarmati Riverfront Project, a recreational development in Ahmedabad, India, forcefully relocated over 19,000 families from shacks along the river to 13 public housing complexes that were an average of 9 km away from the family&#x27;s original dwelling.

==Prevalence==
Slums exist in many countries and have become a global phenomenon. A UN-Habitat report states that in 2006 there were nearly 1 billion people settling in slum settlements in most cities of Central America, Asia, South America and Africa, and a smaller number in the cities of Europe and North America.

In 2012, according to UN-Habitat, about 863 million people in the developing world lived in slums. Of these, the urban slum population at mid-year was around 213 million in Sub-Saharan Africa, 207 million in East Asia, 201 million in South Asia, 113 million in Latin America and Caribbean, 80 million in Southeast Asia, 36 million in West Asia, and 13 million in North Africa. Among individual countries, the proportion of urban residents living in slum areas in 2009 was highest in the Central African Republic (95.9%), Chad (89.3%), Niger (81.7%), and Mozambique (80.5%).

The distribution of slums within a city varies throughout the world. In most of the developed countries, it is easier to distinguish the slum-areas and non-slum areas. In the United States, slum dwellers are usually in city neighborhoods and inner suburbs, while in Europe, they are more common in high rise housing on the urban outskirts. In many developing countries, slums are prevalent as distributed pockets or as urban orbits of densely constructed informal settlements.

In some cities, especially in countries in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, slums are not just marginalized neighborhoods holding a small population; slums are widespread, and are home to a large part of urban population. These are sometimes called &quot;slum cities&quot;.

The percentage of developing world&#x27;s urban population living in slums has been dropping with economic development, even while total urban population has been increasing. In 1990, 46 percent of the urban population lived in slums; by 2000, the percentage had dropped to 39%; which further dropped to 32% by 2010.

<text>Ash or Yuc (Tamazight: ⵢⵓⵛ, &quot;Yuc&quot;, IPA: ) was an Amazigh sky god worshipped by the Libyan and Tehenu tribes of the Western Desert, an area of desert that lies west of the Nile River. He was regarded as the &quot;Lord of the Tehenu&quot; by the Ancient Egyptians.

In particular, he was identified by the ancient Egyptians as the god of the vineyards of the western Nile Delta and thus was viewed as a benign deity. Flinders Petrie in his 1923 expedition to the Saqqara (also spelt Sakkara) found several references to Ash in Old Kingdom wine jar seals: &quot;I am refreshed by this Ash&quot; was a common inscription.

In Egyptian mythology, as god of the oases, Ash was associated with Set, who was originally a god of the desert. The first known reference to Ash dates to the Protodynastic Period, and he continued to be mentioned as late as the 26th Dynasty.

Ash was usually depicted as a human, whose head was one of the desert creatures, variously being shown as a lion, vulture, hawk, snake, or the unidentified Set animal.

Some depictions of Ash show him as having multiple heads, unlike other Egyptian deities, although some compound depictions were occasionally shown connecting gods to Min. In an article in the journal &quot;Ancient Egypt&quot; (in 1923), and again in an appendix to her book, &quot;The Splendor that was Egypt&quot;, Margaret Murray expands on such depictions, and draws a parallel to a Scythian deity, who is referenced in Sebastian Münster&#x27;s &quot;Cosmographia universalis&quot;.

The idea of Ash as an import god is contested, as he may have been the god of the city of Nebut, now known as Naqada, before Set&#x27;s introduction there. One of his titles is &quot;Nebuty&quot; or &quot;He of Nebut&quot;, indicating this position.

Ash is sometimes seen as another name for Set.

<text>Centre-Val de Loire (; , ) or Centre Region (, ), as it was known until 2015, is one of the eighteen administrative regions of France. It straddles the middle Loire Valley in the interior of the country, with a population of 2,572,853 as of 2018. Its prefecture is Orléans, and its largest city is Tours.

==Naming and etymology==

Like many current regions of France, the region of Centre-Val de Loire was created from parts of historical provinces: , and . First, the name was chosen by the government purely on the basis of geography, in reference to its location in northwest-central France (the central part of the original French language area).

However, the Centre region is not situated in the geographical centre of France (except the Cher department). The name was criticised as being too dull and nondescript. Proposed names for the region included after the Loire Valley (the main feature of the region) or (Heart of Loire). On 17 January 2015, as part of the reorganisation of French regions, the region&#x27;s official name was changed to . is associated with positive images of the Loire Valley, such as the , the gentle and refined lifestyle, wine, as well as the mild and temperate climate, all of which attract many tourists to the region. A new logo was also created.

==Geography==
Bordering six other regions, Centre-Val-de-Loire borders most of the eighteen regions in France. The adjacent regions are Normandy to the northwest, Île-de-France to the northeast, Bourgogne-Franche-Comté to the east, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes to the southeast, Nouvelle-Aquitaine to the southwest and Pays de la Loire to the west.

===Departments===
Centre-Val de Loire comprises six departments: Cher, Eure-et-Loir, Indre, Indre-et-Loire, Loir-et-Cher, and Loiret.

===Largest cities===
*Tours with 136,463 inhabitants (2018)
*Orléans with 116,238 inhabitants (2018)
*Bourges with 64,668 inhabitants (2018)
*Blois with 45,871 inhabitants (2018)
*Châteauroux with 43,442 inhabitants (2018)
*Chartres with 38,426 inhabitants (2018)
*Joué-lès-Tours with 38,250 inhabitants (2018), Tours Métropole Val de Loire
*Dreux with 30,664 inhabitants (2018)
*Vierzon with 25,725 inhabitants (2018)
*Olivet with 22,168 inhabitants (2018), Orléans Métropole

==Economy==

The gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 72.4 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 3.1% of French economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 25,200 euros or 84% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 99% of the EU average.

An economic development agency, called &quot;Centréco&quot;, was created in 1994 by the Regional Council of Centre to promote the inflow of investments and the establishment of new businesses by French and foreign companies in the Centre region. This contributes to a mission of economic promotion, international support to regional companies, and the promotion of regional agrofood products via a regional signature, &quot;du Centre&quot;.

<text>The American Mathematical Society (AMS) is an association of professional mathematicians dedicated to the interests of mathematical research and scholarship, and serves the national and international community through its publications, meetings, advocacy and other programs.

The society is one of the four parts of the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics and a member of the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences.

== History ==
The AMS was founded in 1888 as the New York Mathematical Society, the brainchild of Thomas Fiske, who was impressed by the London Mathematical Society on a visit to England. John Howard Van Amringe became the first president while Fiske became secretary. The society soon decided to publish a journal, but ran into some resistance over concerns about competing with the &quot;American Journal of Mathematics&quot;. The result was the &quot;Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society&quot;, with Fiske as editor-in-chief. The de facto journal, as intended, was influential in increasing membership. The popularity of the &quot;Bulletin&quot; soon led to the launches of the &quot;Transactions of the American Mathematical Society&quot; and &quot;Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society&quot;, which were also de facto journals.

In 1891, Charlotte Scott of Britain became the first woman to join the AMS, then called the New York Mathematical Society. The society reorganized under its present name (American Mathematical Society) and became a national society in 1894, and that year Scott became the first woman on the first Council of the society. In 1927 Anna Pell-Wheeler became the first woman to present a lecture at the society&#x27;s Colloquium.

In 1951 there was a southeastern sectional meeting of the Mathematical Association of America in Nashville. The citation delivered at the 2007 MAA awards presentation, where Lee Lorch received a standing ovation, recorded that:

:&quot;Lee Lorch, the chair of the mathematics department at Fisk University, and three Black colleagues, Evelyn Boyd (now Granville), Walter Brown, and H. M. Holloway came to the meeting and were able to attend the scientific sessions. However, the organizer for the closing banquet refused to honor the reservations of these four mathematicians. (Letters in Science, August 10, 1951, pp. 161–162 spell out the details). Lorch and his colleagues wrote to the governing bodies of the AMS [American Mathematical Society] and MAA seeking bylaws against discrimination. Bylaws were not changed, but non-discriminatory policies were established and have been strictly observed since then.&quot;

Also in 1951, the American Mathematical Society&#x27;s headquarters moved from New York City to Providence, Rhode Island. The society later added an office in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1965 and an office in Washington, D.C. in 1992.

In 1954 the society called for the creation of a new teaching degree, a Doctor of Arts in Mathematics, similar to a PhD but without a research thesis.

In the 1970s, as reported in &quot;A Brief History of the Association for Women in Mathematics: The Presidents&#x27; Perspectives&quot; by Lenore Blum, &quot;In those years the AMS was governed by what could only be called an &#x27;old boys network,&#x27; closed to all but those in the inner circle.&quot; Mary W. Gray challenged that situation by &quot;sitting in on the Council meeting in Atlantic City. When she was told she had to leave, she refused saying she would wait until the police came. (Mary relates the story somewhat differently: When she was told she had to leave, she responded she could find no rules in the by-laws restricting attendance at Council meetings. She was then told it was by &#x27;gentlemen&#x27;s agreement.&#x27; Naturally Mary replied &#x27;Well, obviously I&#x27;m no gentleman.&#x27;) After that time, Council meetings were open to observers and the process of democratization of the Society had begun.&quot; Also, in 1971 the AMS established its Joint Committee on Women in the Mathematical Sciences (JCW), which later became a joint committee of multiple scholarly societies.

Julia Robinson was the first female president of the American Mathematical Society (1983–1984), but was unable to complete her term as she was suffering from leukemia.

In 1988, the &quot;Journal of the American Mathematical Society&quot; was created, as the flagship journal of the AMS.

==AMS and mathematical research==
The American Mathematical Society plays a significant role in advancing mathematical research by fostering collaboration, supporting early-career researchers, and maintaining influential publications and databases.

===Research collaborations and support===
The AMS facilitates collaboration among mathematicians through a variety of programs aimed at different career stages. The Mathematical Research Communities, established in 2008, provides early-career researchers with opportunities to engage in intensive research workshops, collaborate with peers, and receive mentoring from senior mathematicians. These programs often lead to the formation of long-term research groups that contribute to emerging fields in mathematics.

In addition, the AMS supports Research Experiences for Undergraduates through advocacy and funding partnerships, ensuring that undergraduate students are exposed to high-level mathematical research. The AMS also offers travel grants and fellowships to encourage participation in international conferences and collaborative research projects.

==Influence on policy and education==
===Advocacy for mathematics funding===
The AMS advocates for federal funding for mathematical research. It collaborates with organizations such as the National Science Foundation and the National Academy of Sciences to promote funding initiatives. The AMS is also a member of the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics, which works with policymakers to emphasize the role of mathematics in technological advancements and national security.

In partnership with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the AMS has contributed to discussions on STEM workforce development and the applications of mathematics in areas such as cybersecurity and data science. The society has supported initiatives for stable funding in mathematical research, citing its importance in economic growth and scientific development.

== Meetings ==

The AMS, along with more than a dozen other organizations, holds the largest annual research mathematics meeting in the world, the Joint Mathematics Meeting, in early January. The 2019 Joint Mathematics Meeting in Baltimore drew approximately 6,000 attendees. Each of the four regional sections of the AMS (Central, Eastern, Southeastern, and Western) holds meetings in the spring and fall of each year. The society also co-sponsors meetings with other international mathematical societies.

== Fellows ==

The AMS selects an annual class of Fellows who have made outstanding contributions to the advancement of mathematics.

== Publications ==

The AMS publishes &quot;Mathematical Reviews&quot;, a database of reviews of mathematical publications, various journals, and books. In 1997 the AMS acquired Chelsea Publishing Company, which it uses as an imprint. In 2017, the AMS acquired MAA Press, the book publishing program of the Mathematical Association of America. The AMS has continued to publish books under the MAA Press imprint.

<text>Freezing is a phase transition in which a liquid turns into a solid when its temperature is lowered below its freezing point.

For most substances, the melting and freezing points are the same temperature; however, certain substances possess differing solid-liquid transition temperatures. For example, agar displays a hysteresis in its melting point and freezing point. It melts at and solidifies from .

==Crystallization==
Most liquids freeze by crystallization, formation of crystalline solid from the uniform liquid. This is a first-order thermodynamic phase transition, which means that as long as solid and liquid coexist, the temperature of the whole system remains very nearly equal to the melting point due to the slow removal of heat when in contact with air, which is a poor heat conductor. Because of the latent heat of fusion, the freezing is greatly slowed and the temperature will not drop anymore once the freezing starts but will continue dropping once it finishes.

Crystallization consists of two major events, nucleation and crystal growth. &quot;Nucleation&quot; is the step wherein the molecules start to gather into clusters, on the nanometer scale, arranging in a defined and periodic manner that defines the crystal structure. &quot;Crystal growth&quot; is the subsequent growth of the nuclei that succeed in achieving the critical cluster size.

==Supercooling==
In spite of the second law of thermodynamics, crystallization of pure liquids usually begins at a lower temperature than the melting point, due to high activation energy of homogeneous nucleation. The creation of a nucleus implies the formation of an interface at the boundaries of the new phase. Some energy is expended to form this interface, based on the surface energy of each phase. If a hypothetical nucleus is too small, the energy that would be released by forming its volume is not enough to create its surface, and nucleation does not proceed. Freezing does not start until the temperature is low enough to provide enough energy to form stable nuclei. In presence of irregularities on the surface of the containing vessel, solid or gaseous impurities, pre-formed solid crystals, or other nucleators, heterogeneous nucleation may occur, where some energy is released by the partial destruction of the previous interface, raising the supercooling point to be near or equal to the melting point. The melting point of water at 1 atmosphere of pressure is very close to , and in the presence of nucleating substances the freezing point of water is close to the melting point, but in the absence of nucleators water can supercool to before freezing. Under high pressure (2,000 atmospheres) water will supercool to as low as before freezing.

==Exothermicity==

Freezing is almost always an exothermic process, meaning that as liquid changes into solid, heat and pressure are released. This is often seen as counter-intuitive, since the temperature of the material does not rise during freezing, except if the liquid were supercooled. But this can be understood since heat must be continually removed from the freezing liquid or the freezing process will stop. The energy released upon freezing is a latent heat, and is known as the enthalpy of fusion and is exactly the same as the energy required to melt the same amount of the solid.

Low-temperature helium is the only known exception to the general rule. Helium-3 has a negative enthalpy of fusion at temperatures below 0.3 K. Helium-4 also has a very slightly negative enthalpy of fusion below 0.8 K. This means that, at appropriate constant pressures, heat must be &quot;added&quot; to these substances in order to freeze them.

==Vitrification==

Certain materials, such as glass and glycerol, may harden without crystallizing; these are called amorphous solids. Amorphous materials, as well as some polymers, do not have a freezing point, as there is no abrupt phase change at any specific temperature. Instead, there is a gradual change in their viscoelastic properties over a range of temperatures. Such materials are characterized by a glass transition that occurs at a glass transition temperature, which may be roughly defined as the &quot;knee&quot; point of the material&#x27;s density vs. temperature graph. Because vitrification is a non-equilibrium process, it does not qualify as freezing, which requires an equilibrium between the crystalline and liquid state.

==Expansion==
The size of substances increases or expands on being heated. This increase in the size of a body due to heating is called thermal expansion .. Thermal expansion takes place in all objects and in all states of matter. However, different substances have different rates of expansion for the same rise in temperature.&quot;

==Freezing of living organisms==
Many living organisms are able to tolerate prolonged periods of time at temperatures below the freezing point of water. Most living organisms accumulate cryoprotectants such as anti-nucleating proteins, polyols, and glucose to protect themselves against frost damage by sharp ice crystals. Most plants, in particular, can safely reach temperatures of −4 °C to −12 °C. Certain bacteria, notably &quot;Pseudomonas syringae&quot;, produce specialized proteins that serve as potent ice nucleators, which they use to force ice formation on the surface of various fruits and plants at about −2 °C. The freezing causes injuries in the epithelia and makes the nutrients in the underlying plant tissues available to the bacteria.

===Bacteria===
Three species of bacteria, &quot;Carnobacterium pleistocenium&quot;, as well as &quot;Chryseobacterium greenlandensis&quot; and &quot;Herminiimonas glaciei&quot;, have reportedly been revived after surviving for thousands of years frozen in ice.

===Plants===
Many plants undergo a process called hardening, which allows them to survive temperatures below 0 °C for weeks to months.

===Animals===
The nematode &quot;Haemonchus contortus&quot; can survive 44 weeks frozen at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Other nematodes that survive at temperatures below 0 °C include &quot;Trichostrongylus colubriformis&quot; and &quot;Panagrolaimus davidi&quot;. Many species of reptiles and amphibians survive freezing.

Human gametes and 2-, 4- and 8-cell embryos can survive freezing and are viable for up to 10 years, a process known as cryopreservation.

Experimental attempts to freeze human beings for later revival are known as cryonics.

==Food preservation==
Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. Besides the effect of lower temperatures on reaction rates, freezing makes water less available for bacteria growth. Freezing is a widely used method of food preservation. Freezing generally preserves flavours, smell and nutritional content. Freezing became commercially viable.

<text>Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim (; ; 14 September 1486 – 18 February 1535) was a German Renaissance , physician, legal scholar, soldier, knight, theologian, and occult writer. Agrippa&#x27;s &quot;Three Books of Occult Philosophy&quot; published in 1533 drew heavily upon Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and Neoplatonism. His book was widely influential among esotericists of the early modern period, and was condemned as heretical by the inquisitor of Cologne.

==Early life and education==
Agrippa was born in Nettesheim, near Cologne on 14 September 1486, to the Cornelis, a family of middle nobility. Many members of his family had been in the service of the House of Habsburg. Agrippa studied at the University of Cologne from 1499 to 1502, (age 13–16) when he received the degree of &quot;magister artium&quot;. The University of Cologne was one of the centers of Thomism, and the faculty of arts was split between the dominant Thomists and the Albertists. It is likely that Agrippa&#x27;s interest in the occult came from this Albertist influence. Agrippa himself named Albert’s &quot;Speculum&quot; as one of his first occult study texts. He later studied in Paris, where he apparently took part in a secret society involved in the occult.

==Military career==
In 1508 Agrippa traveled to Spain to work as a mercenary. He continued his travels by way of Valencia, the Baleares, Sardinia, Naples, Avignon, and Lyon. He served as a captain in the army of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, who awarded him the title of &quot;Ritter&quot; (knight).

==Academic career==

Agrippa&#x27;s academic career began in 1509, receiving the patronage of Margaret of Austria, governor of Franche-Comté, and Antoine de Vergy, archbishop of Besançon and chancellor of the University of Dole. He was given the opportunity to lecture a course at the University on Hebrew scholar Johann Reuchlin&#x27;s &quot;De verbo mirifico&quot;. At Dôle, Agrippa wrote &quot;De nobilitate et praecellentia foeminae sexus&quot; (On the Nobility and Excellence of the Feminine Sex), a work that aimed at proving the superiority of women using cabalistic ideas. The book was probably intended to impress Margaret. Agrippa’s lectures received attention, and he was given a doctorate in theology because of them. He was, however, denounced by the Franciscan prior Jean Catilinet as a &quot;Judaizing heretic&quot;, and was forced to leave Dôle in 1510.

In the winter of 1509–1510 Agrippa returned to Germany and studied with Humanist Johannes Trithemius at Würzburg. On 8 April 1510 he dedicated the then unpublished first draft of &quot;De occulta philosophia&quot; (&quot;On the Occult Philosophy&quot;) to Trithemius, who recommended that Agrippa keep his occult studies secret. Proceeding to the Netherlands he took service again with Maximilian. In 1510 the king sent Agrippa on a diplomatic mission to England, where he was the guest of the Humanist and Platonist John Colet, dean of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, and where he replied to the accusations brought against him by Catilinet (&quot;Expostulatio super Expositione sua in librum De verbo mirifico&quot;). In the reply he argued that his Christian faith was not incompatible with his appreciation for Jewish thought, writing &quot;I am a Christian, but I do not dislike Jewish Rabbis&quot;. Agrippa then returned to Cologne and gave disputations at the university&#x27;s faculty of theology.

Agrippa followed Maximilian to Italy in 1511, and as a theologian attended the schismatic council of Pisa (1512), which was called by some cardinals in opposition to a council called by Pope Julius II. He remained in Italy for seven years, partly in the service of William IX, Marquess of Montferrat, and partly in that of Charles III, Duke of Savoy, probably occupied in teaching theology and practicing medicine. During his time in northern Italy Agrippa came into contact with Agostino Ricci and perhaps Paolo Ricci, and studied the works of philosophers Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, and the kabbalah. In 1515 he lectured at the University of Pavia on the Pimander of Hermes Trismegistus, but these lectures were abruptly terminated owing to the victories of Francis I, King of France.

In 1518 the efforts of one or other of his patrons secured for Agrippa the position of town advocate and orator, or syndic, at Metz. Here, as at Dôle, his opinions soon brought him into collision with the monks, and his defense of a woman accused of witchcraft involved him in a dispute with the inquisitor, Nicholas Savin. The consequence of this was that in 1520 he resigned his office and returned to Cologne, where he stayed about two years. He then practiced for a short time as a physician at Geneva and Freiburg, but in 1524 went to Lyons on being appointed physician to Louise of Savoy, mother of Francis I. In 1528 he gave up this position, and about this time was invited to take part in the dispute over the legality of the divorce of Catherine of Aragon by Henry VIII; but he preferred an offer made by Margaret, duchess of Savoy and regent of the Netherlands, and became archivist and historiographer to the emperor Charles V.

Margaret&#x27;s death in 1530 weakened his position, and the publication of some of his writings about the same time aroused anew the hatred of his enemies; but after suffering a short imprisonment for debt at Brussels he lived at Cologne and Bonn, under the protection of Hermann of Wied, archbishop of Cologne. By publishing his works he brought himself into antagonism with the Inquisition, which sought to stop the printing of &quot;De occulta philosophia&quot;. He then went to France, where he was arrested by order of Francis I for some disparaging words about the queen-mother; but he was soon released, and on 18 February 1535 died at Grenoble. He was married three times and had a large family.

During his wandering life in Germany, France, and Italy, Agrippa worked as a theologian, physician, legal expert, and soldier. Agrippa was for some time in the service of Maximilian I, probably as a soldier in Italy, but devoted his time mainly to the study of the occult sciences and to problematic theological legal questions, which exposed him to various persecutions through life, usually in the mode described above: He would be privately denounced for one sort of heresy or another. He would only reply with venom considerably later (Nauert demonstrates this pattern effectively).

No evidence exists that Agrippa was seriously accused, much less persecuted, for his interest in or practice of magical or occult arts during his lifetime, although it was known he argued against the persecution of witches. It is impossible, of course, to cite negatively, but Nauert, the best bio-bibliographical study to date, shows no indication of such persecution, and Van der Poel&#x27;s careful examination of the various attacks suggest that they were founded on quite other theological grounds.

Recent scholarship (see Further Reading below, in Lehrich, Nauert, and Van der Poel) generally agrees that this rejection or repudiation of magic is not what it seems: Agrippa never rejected magic in its totality, but he did retract his early manuscript of the &quot;Occult Philosophy&quot; – to be replaced by the later form.

In the &quot;Third Book of Occult Philosophy&quot;, Agrippa concludes with:

According to his student Johann Weyer, in the 1563 book &quot;De praestigiis daemonum&quot;, Agrippa died in Grenoble, in 1535.

==Works==

Agrippa is perhaps best known for his books.

&quot;De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum atque artium declamatio invectiva&quot; (&quot;Declamation Attacking the Uncertainty and Vanity of the Sciences and the Arts&quot;, 1526; printed in Cologne 1527), a skeptical satire of the sad state of science. This book, a significant production of the revival of Pyrrhonic skepticism in its fideist mode, was to have a significant influence on such thinkers and writers as Montaigne, Descartes and Goethe.

&quot;Declamatio de nobilitate et praecellentia foeminei sexus&quot; (&quot;Declamation on the Nobility and Preeminence of the Female Sex&quot;, 1529), a book pronouncing the theological and moral superiority of women. Edition with English translation, London 1652

&quot;De occulta philosophia libri tres&quot; (&quot;Three Books Concerning Occult Philosophy&quot;, Book 1 printed Paris 1531; Books 2–3 in Cologne 1533). This summa of occult and magical thought, Agrippa&#x27;s most important work in a number of respects, sought a solution to the skepticism proposed in &quot;De vanitate&quot;. In short, Agrippa argued for a synthetic vision of magic whereby the natural world combined with the celestial and the divine through Neoplatonic participation, such that ordinarily licit natural magic was in fact validated by a kind of demonic magic sourced ultimately from God. By this means Agrippa proposed a magic that could resolve all epistemological problems raised by skepticism in a total validation of Christian faith.

One example of the text, not especially indicative of its broader contents, is Agrippa&#x27;s analysis of herbal treatments for malaria in numeric terms:

Rabanus also, a famous Doctor, composed an excellent book of the vertues of numbers: But now how great vertues numbers have in nature, is manifest in the hearb which is called Cinquefoil, i.e. five leaved Grass; for this resists poysons by vertue of the number of five; also drives away divells, conduceth to expiation; and one leafe of it taken twice in a day in wine, cures the Feaver of one day: three the tertian Feaver: foure the quartane. In like manner four grains of the seed of Turnisole being drunk, cures the quartane, but three the tertian. In like manner Vervin is said to cure Feavers, being drunk in wine, if in tertians it be cut from the third joynt, in quartans from the fourth.

The book was a major influence on such later magical thinkers as Giordano Bruno and John Dee. The book (whose early draft, quite different from the final form, circulated in manuscript long before it was published) is often cited in discussions of Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s famous engraving Melencolia I (1514).

A spurious &quot;Fourth book of occult philosophy&quot;, sometimes called &quot;Of Magical Ceremonies&quot;, has also been attributed to him; this book first appeared in Marburg in 1559 and is not believed to have been written by Agrippa.

<text>Rhône-Alpes () was an administrative region of France. Since 1 January 2016, it is part of the new region Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. It is located on the eastern border of the country, towards the south. The region was named after the river Rhône and the Alps mountain range. Its capital, Lyon, is the second-largest metropolitan area in France after Paris. Rhône-Alpes has the sixth-largest economy of any European region.

== Geography ==
Rhône-Alpes is located in the southeast of France. The neighboring (pre-2016) regions are Bourgogne (Burgundy) and Franche-Comté to the north, Auvergne to the west, Languedoc-Roussillon to the southwest, and Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur to the south. The eastern part of the region is in the Alps, and borders Switzerland and Italy. The highest peak is Mont Blanc, on the French-Italian border. The central part of the region comprises the river valleys of the Rhône and the Saône. The confluence of these two rivers is at Lyon. The western part of the region contains the start of the Massif Central mountain range. The region also borders or contains major lakes such as Lake Geneva (&quot;Lac Léman&quot;) and Lake Annecy. The Ardèche flows through the southwest portion of the region, where it has carved the deepest gorge in Europe.

As with the rest of France, French is the only official language of the region. Until the mid-20th century, Arpitan was widely spoken in the whole region, while many of the inhabitants of the south spoke varieties of Occitan; both are in steep decline in this region. There are immigrant populations from Armenia, Italy, North Africa, Poland and Portugal, and elsewhere.

Rhône-Alpes is made up of the following departments:
* Ain (01). Capital: Bourg-en-Bresse
* Ardèche (07). Capital: Privas
* Drôme (26). Capital: Valence
* Isère (38). Capital: Grenoble
* Loire (42). Capital: Saint-Étienne
* Rhône (69). Capital: Lyon
* Savoie (73). Capital: Chambéry
* Haute-Savoie (74). Capital: Annecy

And, since 2015, Metropolis with territorial collectivity statute:
* Metropolis of Lyon (69). Capital: Lyon

===Lakes===
There are six main lakes in Rhône-Alpes:
* Lac de Paladru
* Lac d&#x27;Aiguebelette
* Lac du Bourget
* Lac d&#x27;Annecy
* Lac de Nantua
* Lac Léman

== Prefectures ==


Prefectures listed in descending order of size:

* Grenoble (Isère)
* Saint-Étienne (Loire)
* Valence (Drôme)
* Chambéry (Savoie)
* Annecy (Haute-Savoie)
* Bourg-en-Bresse (Ain)
* Privas (Ardèche)

== History ==
Although there have been people in Rhône-Alpes since pre-historic times, the earliest recorded settlers of the region were the Gauls (Celts). Cities such as Lyon were founded by them and the region traded with both northern and southern Europe. Most of the area became part of Roman territory during the invasion of Celtic Gaul led by Julius Caesar and was at various times part of the regions of Lugdunensis and Gallia. Lyon itself became a major city in the Roman Empire.

The region, excepting Savoy, was part of the Merovingian and Carolingian Kingdoms before becoming a royal territory under the Capetians. As it became a royal territory early on in French history, its cultural, political and economic influences and developments paralleled those of greater France. (See History of France.)

== Transport ==

Rhône-Alpes is a major European transit hub, linking northern France and Europe to the Mediterranean area. Millions travel along its motorways in summertime from Paris to holidays at the sea. The E15 Euroroute (Britain to Spain) runs through the region. There are international airports at Lyon, Grenoble and Saint-Étienne and many other minor airports and airfields.
The region is also a transport hub for the rail network with the TGV running through Lyon from Paris and the north, to the Mediterranean. A high-speed rail link is planned from Lyon to Turin.

== Economy ==

Rhône-Alpes is a prosperous region which can be seen by its per capita GDP of about €31,231 ($40,000), which is higher than the French average, and an average income of €35,910 ($50,246), its economy second in size only to Île-de-France in France. This can be attributed to the diversity of the production in different sectors. The region is one of the Four Motors for Europe.
* Industry, in particular:
** Light engineering and high-tech
** Mechanical engineering in the area of Annecy
** Precision machining in the area of Cluses
* Services, in particular:
** High-tech industries, nanotechnology, biotechnology especially in Grenoble with 62,300 jobs in these sectors thanks to the presence of the Polygone Scientifique, Inovallée and some large companies as Schneider Electric. 
** Optic and design in Saint-Étienne
** Tourism with the Alps (for skiing), Lyon and Grenoble (for culture) and the Ardèche (adventure sports/camping) particularly popular
** Education, with major universities in Lyon, Grenoble and Saint-Étienne.

In the past mining, especially coal mining was an important sector, particularly around Saint-Étienne, although this has declined since the 1970s.

The area of the region that lies close to Switzerland has an economy linked to that of Geneva. This area forms a hinterland for the Geneva hub.

The Triangle of Lyon, Saint-Étienne and Grenoble contribute a GDP of €145 billion to the region. Add Valence to it, it is almost €150 billion. In addition, Lyon alone has a Gross Metropolitan Product of about €85 billion.

The region has been part of Alps–Mediterranean Euroregion since 10 July 2007.

==Major cities==
==Winter Olympics==
Rhône-Alpes region has hosted the Winter Olympics three times; in 1924 at Chamonix, 1968 at Grenoble, and 1992 at Albertville.

==Tourism==
Situated between Paris and the Côte d’Azur, on the border with both Switzerland and Italy, and offering access to two international airports (Lyon and Geneva), rail connections and a vast motorway network, the Rhône-Alpes region is at &quot;the crossroads of Europe&quot;.

Boasting eight natural parks and peerless sites such as Mont Blanc and the Gorges de l’Ardèche, Rhône-Alpes offers a wide range of different landscapes: mountains, vineyards and gentle valleys, fields of lavender and olive groves.

Every form of sport is readily available, set against a natural backdrop: skiing, hiking, mountain biking or even paragliding and canoeing. Besides hosting three Winter Olympics games due to its being the largest ski area in the world, Rhône-Alpes is the second most important golfing region in France with over 60 courses.
Enthusiasts of art and culture will not be disappointed by the region&#x27;s Villes d’Art: Lyon, which is classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage site, Annecy, Grenoble, Chambéry, and Saint-Étienne.

===Gastronomy===
Lyon is noted as a gastronomic centre of France and specialities served in its traditional &quot;bouchons&quot; include Lyon sausage, sophisticated salami (known there as &quot;rosette&quot;), tripe and quenelles. In the east of the region the food has an Alpine flavour with dishes such as fondue, raclette common, gratin dauphinois and gratin savoyard. The region is also famous for its Bresse poultry and the many varieties of cheese including Tomme de Savoie, Bleu de Bresse, Reblochon, Saint-Marcellin and Vacherin du Haut-Doubs.

Wines in this region include Beaujolais, Côtes du Rhône and Savoy wine. Chartreuse liqueur is made in the region.

Lyon is the home of very typical and traditional restaurants: the &quot;bouchons&quot;. &quot;Bouchons&quot; are usually convivial restaurants serving local dishes, and local wines.

Lyon is famous for its morning snacks, the &quot;mâchons&quot;, made up of local charcuterie, especially the rosette and usually accompanied by Beaujolais red wine. Traditional local dishes include &quot;saucisson de Lyon&quot; (sausage), andouillette, coq au vin, esox (pike) quenelle, &quot;gras double&quot; (tripe cooked with onions), &quot;salade lyonnaise&quot; (lettuce with bacon, croûtons and a poached egg), marrons glacés and cardoon &quot;au gratin&quot;.

As a three-piece, they released mini-album &quot;Trailer&quot; in 1994 and full-length album &quot;1977&quot; in 1996. This 1996 release was named by &quot;NME&quot; as one of the 500 greatest albums of all time. After the success of their full debut the band recruited Charlotte Hatherley as a guitarist and vocalist, releasing their second record &quot;Nu-Clear Sounds&quot; in 1998. After narrowly avoiding bankruptcy, the band released &quot;Free All Angels&quot; in 2001 and a string of successful singles.

The band became a three-piece again in 2006 when Hatherley left, and after five conventional albums the band released 26 singles in the &quot;A-Z Series&quot; in 2009, one every two weeks. The band have had one silver, two gold and two platinum-selling (and chart-topping) records in the United Kingdom, as well as 18 songs in the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. They have been associated with Britpop, though they were not comfortable with the association, as emphasising Britishness could be interpreted as sectarian in Northern Ireland.

==History==

===Band beginning, &quot;Trailer&quot; and &quot;1977&quot; (1989–1997)===
Ash officially formed in 1992, reportedly having taken the name from the first word they liked in the dictionary. Prior to this, Wheeler and Hamilton were in an Iron Maiden cover band called Vietnam, which had formed in 1989. The new band created three demo tapes that year – &quot;Solar Happy&quot; in June, &quot;Shed&quot; in September and the &quot;Home Demo&quot; in November. These tapes featured their earliest material and the first recordings of some songs that were later on the 1994 release, &quot;Trailer&quot;, including &quot;Intense Thing&quot;, &quot;Get Out&quot;, &quot;Obscure Thing,&quot; and the future single, &quot;Jack Names the Planets&quot;.

In 1993 the band recorded the &quot;Garage Girl&quot; demo tape, which featured &quot;Jack Names the Planets&quot; and &quot;Intense Thing&quot;, taken from &quot;Shed&quot;, and new tracks, including &quot;Petrol&quot;. Following &quot;Garage Girl&quot;, Ash released a compilation demo tape, &quot;Pipe Smokin&#x27; Brick&quot; later that year, which featured an assortment of songs from the other tapes. Downpatrick musician Ray Valentine recorded Ash&#x27;s demos at his studio, Cosmic Rays. At that time, the band was known as &quot;Genuine Real Teenagers,&quot; because they were so young when recording their early material. The demo tapes did not gain much attention at that time and the band was still playing small shows at local clubs but, in early 1994, Stephen Taverner came across the &quot;Garage Girl&quot; demo tape. Taverner put up the money to press 1,000 7″ copies of &quot;Jack Names the Planets&quot; on his own LaLaLand record label. Taverner subsequently became the band&#x27;s full-time manager.

Ash released the mini-album, &quot;Trailer&quot;, in October 1994, comprising seven songs. Airplay by Steve Lamacq followed on BBC Radio 1 and the debut single was followed by &quot;Petrol&quot; and &quot;Uncle Pat&quot;, on their new label Infectious Records. In 1995, Ash left school and released the breakthrough singles &quot;Kung Fu&quot; (featured over the end credits of Jackie Chan&#x27;s North American breakthrough film, &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot;), &quot;Girl From Mars&quot; and &quot;Angel Interceptor&quot;. The movie &quot;Angus&quot; was released, which featured two Ash songs, &quot;Jack Names the Planets&quot; and &quot;Kung Fu,&quot; and served to introduce Ash to American audiences.

Ash marked the end of their breakthrough year by releasing a cover of the Temptations&#x27; &quot;Get Ready&quot;, as a limited edition red vinyl 7&quot; single on Fantastic Plastic.

In 1996 the singles &quot;Goldfinger&quot; and &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; were released, with the successful album &quot;1977&quot; being released between these. The track &quot;Lose Control&quot; from that album was featured in the video game Gran Turismo. On 17 February 1997, Ash released &quot;Live at the Wireless&quot;, a live album, recorded at the Triple J Studios in Australia. A limited-edition version of the album was released in the UK on the band&#x27;s own Deathstar label. In the summer of 1997, Ash played at the Glastonbury Festival, and at age 20, Hamilton became the youngest person ever to headline the festival.

===Charlotte Hatherley, &quot;Nu-Clear Sounds&quot; and &quot;Free All Angels&quot; (1998–2004)===
While touring with the American band Weezer, Ash felt the limitations of a three-piece format. This led to the recruitment of a second guitarist and vocalist, Charlotte Hatherley, who had previously been with the band Nightnurse. She was introduced at a few small gigs a week before the band&#x27;s appearance at the V Festival in 1997. The first recording to be released with Hatherley was the single &quot;A Life Less Ordinary&quot;, which featured on the soundtrack to the Ewan McGregor / Cameron Diaz film of the same name.

In September 1998, Ash released &quot;Jesus Says&quot; followed in October by the band&#x27;s second album proper, &quot;Nu-Clear Sounds&quot;, and in November by &quot;Wildsurf&quot;. The pressures of near non-stop touring of 1977 and Nu-Clear Sounds began to affect the band. In 1999, Tim Wheeler disappeared for a short while following the commercial and critical failure of &quot;Nu-Clear Sounds&quot;. He eventually emerged in New York making the self-deprecating blood-, drug- and sex-fuelled video for &quot;Numbskull&quot;. A note for Stephen Taverner attached to the video read &quot;I&#x27;ve killed Bambi&quot;.

Ash became almost bankrupt as the band prepared to release what could have been its last album. The members retreated to Wheeler&#x27;s parents&#x27; house, to play and write songs in the same garage where the band began. The single &quot;Shining Light&quot; was released in January 2001, followed by the album &quot;Free All Angels&quot; in April. Subsequent singles released from &quot;Free All Angels&quot; were &quot;Burn Baby Burn&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Candy&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s a Star&quot;. The single &quot;Shining Light&quot; won the Best Contemporary Song award at the 2002 Ivor Novello awards.

A new single &quot;Envy&quot; was released, followed shortly afterward by the singles collection &quot;Intergalactic Sonic 7″s&quot; with the bonus disk entitled Cosmic Debris. &quot;Q&quot; named Ash as No. 2 of its &quot;50 Bands To See Before You Die&quot;.

In 2003, it was leaked to the music and tabloid press that Ash was working on a horror film described as a &#x27;teen slasher&#x27;. The film, called &quot;Slashed&quot;, was shot while the band was on tour in America but some scenes were also shot in the UK. The screenplay, written by Jed Shepherd and directed by Alexander Marks, included star roles by Chris Martin (Sherbet Bones) and Jonny Buckland (Agent Ford) of Coldplay as a pair of FBI agents hired to track down a supernatural serial killer. Other star performances include that of Moby, James Nesbitt, Dave Grohl and Ash themselves. The film was not put on general release.

===&quot;Meltdown&quot; and Hatherley&#x27;s departure (2004–2006)===
On 29 June 2004, Ash released &quot;Meltdown&quot;, which reached number five in the UK. At the same time Hatherley also wrote and recorded her solo side project album &quot;Grey Will Fade&quot;. The band teamed up with LucasArts for a new &quot;Star Wars&quot; game entitled &quot;Republic Commando&quot;. &quot;Meltdown&quot; and &quot;Orpheus&quot; were part of the soundtrack for &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; and appeared on the in-game soundtracks for the video games &quot;NHL 2005&quot;, &quot;Burnout 3: Takedown&quot; and &quot;Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition&quot;. The song &quot;Vampire Love&quot; was used for &quot;American Pie Presents: Band Camp&quot;. &quot;Starcrossed&quot; and &quot;Renegade Cavalcade&quot; were later released as singles from the album. Also in 2005, Tim Wheeler received a companionship (an honorary degree) from LIPA (Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts).

On 20 January 2006, Hatherley left the band; in an interview in July 2007, the others hinted they asked Hatherley to leave as they &quot;wanted to be a three-piece&quot;.

===&quot;Twilight of the Innocents&quot;, &quot;A-Z Series&quot; and second Greatest Hits (2006–2011)===
In 2006 Ash started working in a New York recording studio on what would become their first album after reverting to their original line-up, &quot;Twilight of the Innocents.&quot; A preview track, &quot;I Started A Fire&quot; was released in February 2007, coinciding with a full-length UK tour. The album&#x27;s first physical single &quot;You Can&#x27;t Have It All&quot; was released in April 2007, and the album itself followed the next month, along with an appearance at the Isle of Wight Festival. Two further songs from the album, &quot;Polaris&quot; and &quot;End of the World&quot;, were issued as singles in June and September, respectively. Ash stated that &quot;Twilight of the Innocents&quot; would be their last album and that instead, they would only release singles as &quot;(t)he way people listen to music has changed, with the advent of the download the emphasis has reverted to single tracks&quot;.

The original three-piece line-up played two-sold out nights at London&#x27;s Roundhouse in September 2008, performing &quot;1977&quot; in its entirety. This was followed by the release of a 3-disc special edition version of &quot;1977&quot;, featuring remastered and re-edited versions of the tracks, as well as tracks from &quot;Trailer&quot; and live performances from the time of its release. Ash started recording new material, which was previewed at a series of live dates in 2009. These dates coincided with the release of the single &quot;Return of White Rabbit&quot;. This single was a precursor to Ash releasing a 7&quot; single every fortnight for a whole year, starting in September 2009. Each single was simply titled by a letter, released in alphabetical order, and formed the &quot;A–Z Series&quot;.
These singles would later be compiled and released together on CD. Russell Lissack, who joined the band as a live guitarist in 2010, left in early 2011. &quot;The Best of Ash&quot; compilation was released in 2011. The same year Ash collaborated with We Are Scientists to release a cover of the song &quot;Washington Parks&quot; by British songwriter Robert Manning, raising money and awareness for Multiple Sclerosis and The MS Society.

===&quot;Kablammo!&quot; (2012–2016)===
In November 2012, the band played some US dates with Weezer and went on to headline their own shows on the East Coast. They played at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas in 2013, along with seven other US cities, and supported the Smashing Pumpkins at Wembley Arena. Despite having achieved much success throughout the U.K. and Europe (among other regions) as well as extensively touring the U.S., Ash had not achieved as much success in the U.S.

After declaring in 2007 that Ash would no longer release albums, the band brought out new long-player &quot;Kablammo!&quot; in May 2015. It was preceded by the single &quot;Cocoon&quot;, and &quot;Free&quot; and &quot;Machinery&quot; were released as follow-up singles. In December 2016 the live album &quot;Live on Mars: London Astoria 1997&quot; was released, and supported by a tour.

===&quot;Islands&quot;, their return to Infectious and Tav&#x27;s Management (2017–present)===

&quot;Islands&quot; was released on 18 May 2018, preceded by the single &quot;Buzzkill&quot;, with vocals from Damien O&#x27;Neill and Mickey Bradley from the Undertones. The band released a second single, &quot;Annabel&quot;, in April 2018, and a third, &quot;Did Your Love Burn Out?&quot;, in May to coincide with the album release.

On 14 June 2023, &quot;Race the Night&quot; was released as the first single from their upcoming album of the same name. The album was released in September 2023.

<text>USS &quot;George Washington&quot; (SSBN-598) (Ship, Submersible, Ballistic, Nuclear Powered) was the United States&#x27;s first operational ballistic missile submarine. She was the lead ship of her class of nuclear ballistic missile submarines, was the third United States Navy ship of the name, in honor of Founding Father George Washington (1732–1799), the first president of the United States, and was the first of that name to be purpose-built as a warship.

== Construction and launching ==
&quot;George Washington&quot;&#x27;s keel was laid down at Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics, Groton, Connecticut on 1 November 1958. The first of her class, she was launched on 9 June 1959 sponsored by Mrs. Ollie Mae Anderson (née Rawlins), wife of US Treasury Secretary and former Secretary of the Navy Robert B. Anderson, and commissioned on 30 December 1959 as SSBN-598 with Commander James B. Osborn in command of the Blue crew and Commander John L. From, Jr. in command of the Gold crew.

&quot;George Washington&quot; was originally laid down as the attack submarine . During construction, she was lengthened by the insertion of a -long ballistic missile section and renamed George Washington; another submarine under construction at the time received the original name and hull number. Inside &quot;George Washington&quot;&#x27;s forward escape hatch, a plaque remained bearing her original name. Because the ballistic missile compartment design of &quot;George Washington&quot; was intended to be reused in later ship classes, the section inserted into &quot;George Washington&quot; was designed with a deeper test depth rating than the rest of the submarine.

==Initial operations==
&quot;George Washington&quot; left Groton on 28 June 1960 for Cape Canaveral, Florida, where she loaded two Polaris missiles. Standing out into the Atlantic Missile Test Range with Rear Admiral William Raborn, head of the Polaris submarine development program, on board as an observer, she successfully conducted the first Polaris missile launch from a submerged submarine on 20 July 1960. At 12:39, &quot;George Washington&quot;&#x27;s commanding officer sent President Dwight Eisenhower the message:

Less than two hours later a second missile from the submarine also struck the impact area downrange.

&quot;George Washington&quot; then embarked her Gold crew, and on 30 July 1960 she launched two more missiles while submerged. Shakedown for the Gold crew ended at Groton on 30 August and the boat got underway from that port on 28 October for Naval Weapons Station Charleston, to load her full complement of 16 Polaris missiles. There she was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation, after which her Blue crew took over and embarked on her first deterrent patrol.

The submarine completed her first patrol after 66 days of submerged running on 21 January 1961, and put in at Naval Submarine Base New London at New London, Connecticut. The Gold crew took over and departed on her next patrol on 14 February 1961. After the patrol, she entered Holy Loch, Scotland, on 25 April 1961.

In 1970 ten years after her initial departure from Groton, &quot;George Washington&quot; put in to refuel in Charleston SC, having cruised some .

&quot;George Washington&quot; shifted to the United States Pacific Fleet and a new home port at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii after the refueling.

==Collision with &quot;Nissho Maru&quot;==

On 9 April 1981, &quot;George Washington&quot; was at periscope depth and was broadsided by the Japanese commercial cargo ship &quot;Nissho Maru&quot; in the East China Sea about south-southwest of Sasebo, Japan. &quot;George Washington&quot; immediately surfaced and searched for the other vessel. Owing to the heavy fog conditions at the time, they did see the Nissho Maru heading off into the fog, but it appeared undamaged. It headed into port for repairs; the crew was later flown back to Pearl Harbor from Guam. Unbeknownst to the crew of the George Washington, &quot;Nissho Maru&quot; sank in about 15 minutes. Two Japanese crewmen were lost; 13 were rescued by Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyers JDS &quot;Akigumo&quot; (DD-120) and &quot;Aogumo&quot; (ja). The submarine suffered minor damage to her sail.

The accident strained U.S.–Japanese relations a month before a meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki and President of the United States Ronald Reagan. Japan criticized the U.S. for taking more than 24 hours to notify Japanese authorities, and demanded to know what the boat was doing surfacing only about outside Japan&#x27;s territorial waters.

The U.S. Navy initially stated that &quot;George Washington&quot; executed a crash dive during the collision, and then immediately surfaced, but could not see the Japanese ship due to fog and rain (according to a U.S. Navy report). A preliminary report released a few days later stated the submarine and aircraft crews both had detected &quot;Nissho Maru&quot; nearby, but neither the submarine nor the aircraft realized &quot;Nissho Maru&quot; was in distress.

On 11 April, President Reagan and other U.S. officials formally expressed regret over the accident, made offers of compensation, and reassured the Japanese there was no cause for worry about radioactive contamination. As is its standard policy, the U.S. Government refused to reveal what the submarine was doing close to Japan, or whether she was armed with nuclear missiles. (It is government and navy policy to neither confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons on board.) The Navy accepted responsibility for the incident, and relieved and reprimanded the &quot;George Washington&quot;″s commanding officer and officer of the deck.

On 31 August, the U.S. Navy released its final report, concluding the accident resulted from a set of coincidences, compounded by errors on the part of two members of the submarine crew.

After the collision with the Nissho Maru, the damaged sail was repaired with parts from the sail from the which was waiting for disposal at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.

==Final patrol as ballistic missile submarine==
In 1981, &quot;George Washington&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor from her last missile patrol. In 1981, her missiles were unloaded at Bangor, Washington to comply with the SALT II treaty.

&quot;George Washington&quot; made 55 deterrent patrols in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in her 25-year career.

==Service as an attack submarine==
&quot;George Washington&quot; continued service as an attack submarine (SSN), returning briefly to Pearl Harbor. In 1983, she departed Pearl Harbor for the last time and made the second of four transits through the Panama Canal back to the Atlantic and to New London. While based at Submarine Base Groton, &quot;George Washington&quot; (SSN 598) participated in exercises including one teamed with a Coast Guard Cutter against the USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; (CV-67) and Carrier Group 4. From Puerto Rico’s Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, she provided support for Special Forces training. She participated in the 24th UNITAS exercise as the only US submarine. At the conclusion of exercises with Chile, &quot;George Washington&quot; completed circumnavigation of South America, escorting &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; as she transited open water between Argentina and the Falkland Islands in the early months of 1984.

==Decommissioning==
&quot;George Washington&quot; was decommissioned on 24 January 1985, stricken from the Naval Vessel Registry on 30 April 1986, and scheduled for disposal through the Ship-Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. Recycling of the ship was completed on 30 September 1998.

==Commemoration==
&quot;George Washington&quot;&#x27;s sail was removed prior to disposal and now rests at the Submarine Force Library and Museum at Groton, Connecticut.
