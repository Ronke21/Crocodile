<text>Publius Septimius Geta ( ; 7 March 189 – 26 December 211) was Roman emperor with his father Septimius Severus and older brother Caracalla from 209 to 211. Severus died in February 211 and intended for his sons to rule together, but they proved incapable of sharing power, culminating with the murder of Geta in December of that year.

==Early life==

Geta was the younger son of Septimius Severus by his second wife Julia Domna. He was born on 7 March 189 in either Rome or Mediolanum, at a time when his father was only a provincial governor at the service of Emperor Commodus. On 28 January 198, Geta was raised to &quot;caesar&quot; (heir). Septimius Severus gave him the title of &quot;augustus&quot; (emperor) in late 209, perhaps in September or October. 

During the campaign against the Britons in the early 3rd century AD, imperial propaganda promoted the image of a happy family that shared the responsibilities of rule. Geta&#x27;s brother Caracalla acted as Severus&#x27; second-in-command, and administrative and bureaucratic duties were Geta&#x27;s responsibility. In reality, however, the rivalry and antipathy between the brothers did not abate. With the death of Severus in 211, control of the empire passed to Geta and Caracalla jointly.

==Joint emperor==
When Septimius Severus died in Eboracum on 4 February 211, Caracalla and Geta were proclaimed joint emperors and returned to Rome. Their mother, Julia Domna, who had served as a crucial advisor and confidante to her husband, was able to maintain her political influence over two co-emperors. It is said that on the journey from Britain to Rome the two brothers kept away from each other, not once lodging in the same house or sharing a common meal.
Their joint rule was a failure. The Imperial Palace was divided into two separate sections, and neither allowed the servants of the other into his own. They only met in the presence of their mother, and with a strong military guard, being in constant fear of assassination. The current stability of their joint government was only through the mediation and leadership of their mother, Julia Domna, accompanied by other senior courtiers and generals in the military. The historian Herodian asserted that the brothers decided to split the empire in two halves, but with the strong opposition of their mother, the idea was rejected, when, by the end of 211, the situation had become unbearable. Caracalla tried unsuccessfully to murder Geta during the festival of Saturnalia (17 December). Finally, the next week, Caracalla had his mother arrange a peace meeting with his brother in his mother&#x27;s apartments, thus depriving Geta of his bodyguards, and then had him murdered in her arms by centurions.

Caracalla ordered the &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;, which was thoroughly carried out, as is clear from the archaeological record. Reportedly, Caracalla was thereafter tormented by guilt over his deed, but sought to expiate it by adding to this crime the proscription of all his brother&#x27;s former followers. Cassius Dio stated that around 20,000 men and women were killed or proscribed on this charge during this time.

==Portrait==
Very few marble portraits attributable to Geta survive to date, presumably due to the very thorough &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; which resulted in the erasing of his images. However Roman coins with his image are plentiful, and can reflect how his father Septimius Severus and mother Julia Domna and later Geta himself wanted him to be seen by the Roman people (and especially the Roman military).

Images of Geta and his older brother Caracalla cannot be well distinguished until the death of the father. Both sons were supposed to be presented as equally suitable heirs to the throne, showing thus more &quot;depth&quot; to the dynasty.

On his coins, Caracalla along with Geta, who became &quot;Augustus&quot; in 198, was shown with a wreath of laurels, while Geta remained bareheaded until he himself became &quot;Augustus&quot; in 209. Between 209 and their father&#x27;s death in February 211, both brothers were shown as equally mature young men with a short full beard, ready to take over the empire. Between the death of Septimus Severus and the assassination of Geta, Caracalla&#x27;s portraits did not change, while Geta was depicted with a long beard with hanging hairs, much like his father, a strong indication of Geta&#x27;s efforts to be seen as the &quot;true&quot; successor of his father.

The &quot;Severan Tondo&quot; panel painting depicts Septimius Severus and his family with an obliterated face assumed to be Geta.

Geta was portrayed by Joseph Quinn in the movie &quot;Gladiator II&quot;.

<text>Herennius Modestinus, or simply Modestinus, was a civil servant and a celebrated Roman jurist, a student of Ulpian who flourished about 250 AD.

He appears to have been a native of one of the Greek-speaking provinces, or probably Dalmatia. 
Possibly from 223 to 225 AD he was secretary &quot;a libellis&quot; under Emperor Alexander Severus, and about 228 he was &quot;praefectus vigilum&quot;.
In Valentinian&#x27;s &quot;Law of Citations&quot; he is classed with Papinian, Paulus, Gaius and Ulpian, as one of the five jurists whose recorded views were considered decisive. He is considered to be the last great jurist of the classic age of Roman law. 

He is mentioned in a rescript of Gordian III in the year 240 in connection with a responsum which he gave to the party to whom the rescript was addressed. No fewer than 345 passages in the &quot;Digest&quot; of the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot; are taken from his writings. He is the author of a collection of Responsa and Digesta written in 12 books.

<text>Air Marshal Sir John Hugh Lapsley, (24 September 1916 – 21 November 1995) was a British fighter pilot of the Second World War and, later, a senior Royal Air Force commander.

==RAF career==
Lapsely joined the Royal Air Force as an Aircraft Apprentice in 1935 later being awarded a cadetship at the RAF College Cranwell. In 1937 he was appointed to a permanent commission and a posting to No. 32 Squadron. By February 1941 he was in command of No. 274 Squadron in Malta, originally with Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters which were soon replaced by the Hawker Hurricane. He was shot down near Tobruk on 19 April 1941 and was repatriated back to England to recover. At first he was only fit for instructional duties but by 1943 he was in command of No. 125 Wing with the Hawker Typhoon fighter bomber.

After the war he attended the RAF Staff College, Bracknell and then became Officer Commanding No. 74 Squadron before taking command of the Air Fighting Development Squadron in 1949 and then taking over responsibility for Flying at the Central Flying Establishment in 1951. He went on to be Station Commander at RAF Wahn in 1954, Deputy Chief of Staff at Headquarters Second Tactical Air Force in 1961 and Director of the Defence Operations Staff on formation of the Ministry of Defence in 1964. He became Air Officer Commanding No. 19 (Reconnaissance) Group in 1967 and Air Officer Commander-in-Chief, Coastal Command in 1968. Whilst serving as Commander-in Chief won Coastal Commands Scratch Golf Championship in 1969. In that capacity he accepted the first Nimrod aircraft into service in October 1969. His last appointment was as Head of the British Defence Staff in Washington, D.C. in 1970 before retiring in 1973. Whilst serving as Commander-in Chief he won Coastal Command&#x27;s Scratch Golf Championship in 1969.

In retirement he became Director General of the Save the Children Fund.

He is buried in the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s at Benhall in Suffolk.

<doc id="204967" wikidata="Q106551" url="?curid=204967" title="Regolith">
<text>Regolith () is a blanket of unconsolidated, loose, heterogeneous superficial deposits covering solid rock. It includes dust, broken rocks, and other related materials and is present on Earth, the Moon, Mars, some asteroids, and other terrestrial planets and moons.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;&quot; combines two Greek words: (), &#x27;blanket&#x27;, and (), &#x27;rock&#x27;. The American geologist George P. Merrill first defined the term in 1897, writing:

==Earth==
Earth&#x27;s regolith includes the following subdivisions and components:

* soil or pedolith
* alluvium and other transported cover, including that transported by aeolian, glacial, marine, and gravity flow processes.
* &quot;saprolith&#x27;&quot;, generally divided into the
** &quot;upper saprolite&quot;: completely oxidised bedrock
** &quot;lower saprolite&quot;: chemically reduced partially weathered rocks
** &quot;saprock&quot;: fractured bedrock with weathering restricted to fracture margins
* volcanic ash and lava flows that are interbedded with unconsolidated material
* duricrust, formed by cementation of soils, saprolith and transported material like clays, silicates, iron oxides, oxyhydroxides, carbonates, sulfates and less common agents, into indurated layers resistant to weathering and erosion.
* groundwater- and water-deposited salts.
* biota and organic components derived from it.

Regolith can vary from being essentially absent to hundreds of metres in thickness. Its age can vary from instantaneous (for an ash fall or alluvium just deposited) to hundreds of millions of years old (regolith of Precambrian age occurs in parts of Australia, though this may have been buried and subsequently exhumed.)

Regolith on Earth originates from weathering and biological processes. The uppermost part of the regolith, which typically contains significant organic matter, is more conventionally referred to as soil. The presence of regolith is one of the important factors for most life, since few plants can grow on or within solid rock and animals would be unable to burrow or build shelter without loose material.

Regolith is also important to engineers constructing buildings, roads and other civil works. The mechanical properties of regolith vary considerably and need to be documented if the construction is to withstand the rigors of use.

Regolith may host mineral deposits, such as mineral sands, calcrete uranium, and lateritic nickel deposits. Understanding regolith properties, especially geochemical composition, is critical to geochemical and geophysical exploration for mineral deposits beneath it. The regolith is also an important source of construction material, including sand, gravel, crushed stone, lime, and gypsum.

The regolith is the zone through which aquifers are recharged and through which aquifer discharge occurs. Many aquifers, such as alluvial aquifers, occur entirely within regolith. The composition of the regolith can also strongly influence water composition through the presence of salts and acid-generating materials.

==Moon==

Regolith covers almost the entire lunar surface, bedrock protruding only on very steep-sided crater walls and the occasional lava channel. This regolith has formed over the last 4.6 billion years from the impact of large and small meteoroids, from the steady bombardment of micrometeoroids and from solar and galactic charged particles breaking down surface rocks. Regolith production by rock erosion can lead to fillet buildup around lunar rocks.

The impact of micrometeoroids, sometimes travelling faster than , generates enough heat to melt or partially vaporize dust particles. This melting and refreezing welds particles together into glassy, jagged-edged &quot;agglutinates&quot;, reminiscent of tektites found on Earth.

The regolith is generally from 4 to 5 m thick in mare areas and from 10 to 15 m in the older highland regions. Below this true regolith is a region of blocky and fractured bedrock created by larger impacts, which is often referred to as the &quot;megaregolith&quot;.

The density of regolith at the Apollo 15 landing site () averages approximately 1.35 g/cm3 for the top 30 cm, and it is approximately 1.85g/cm3 at a depth of 60 cm.

The term lunar soil is often used interchangeably with &quot;lunar regolith&quot; but typically refers to the finer fraction of regolith, that which is composed of grains one centimetre in diameter or less. Some have argued that the term &quot;soil&quot; is not correct in reference to the Moon because soil is defined as having organic content, whereas the Moon has none. However, standard usage among lunar scientists is to ignore that distinction. &quot;Lunar dust&quot; generally connotes even finer materials than lunar soil, the fraction which is less than 30 micrometers in diameter. The average chemical composition of regolith might be estimated from the relative concentration of elements in lunar soil.

The physical and optical properties of lunar regolith are altered through a process known as space weathering, which darkens the regolith over time, causing crater rays to fade and disappear.

During the early phases of the Apollo Moon landing program, Thomas Gold of Cornell University and part of President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee raised a concern that the thick dust layer at the top of the regolith would not support the weight of the lunar module and that the module might sink beneath the surface. However, Joseph Veverka (also of Cornell) pointed out that Gold had miscalculated the depth of the overlying dust, which was only a couple of centimeters thick. Indeed, the regolith was found to be quite firm by the robotic Surveyor spacecraft that preceded Apollo, and during the Apollo landings the astronauts often found it necessary to use a hammer to drive a core sampling tool into it.

==Mars==
Mars is covered with vast expanses of sand and dust, and its surface is littered with rocks and boulders. The dust is occasionally picked up in vast planet-wide dust storms. Mars dust is very fine and enough remains suspended in the atmosphere to give the sky a reddish hue.

The sand is believed to move only slowly in the Martian winds due to the very low density of the atmosphere in the present epoch. In the past, liquid water flowing in gullies and river valleys may have shaped the Martian regolith. Mars researchers are studying whether groundwater sapping is shaping the Martian regolith in the present epoch and whether carbon dioxide hydrates exist on Mars and play a role. It is believed that large quantities of water and carbon dioxide ices remain frozen within the regolith in the equatorial parts of Mars and on its surface at higher latitudes.

==Asteroids==
Asteroids have regoliths developed by meteoroid impact. The final images taken by the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft of the surface of Eros are the best images of the regolith of an asteroid. The recent Japanese Hayabusa mission also returned clear images of regolith on an asteroid so small it was thought that gravity was too low to develop and maintain a regolith. The asteroid 21 Lutetia has a layer of regolith near its north pole, which flows in landslides associated with variations in albedo.

==Titan==
Saturn&#x27;s largest moon Titan is known to have extensive fields of dunes. However, the origin of the material forming the dunes is unknown - it could be small fragments of water ice eroded by flowing methane or particulate organic matter that formed in Titan&#x27;s atmosphere and rained down on the surface. Scientists are beginning to call this loose icy material &quot;regolith&quot; because of the mechanical similarity with regolith on other bodies. However, traditionally (and etymologically), the term had been applied only when the loose layer was composed of mineral grains like quartz or plagioclase or rock fragments that were in turn composed of such minerals. Loose blankets of ice grains were not considered regolith because when they appear on Earth in the form of snow, they behave differently from regolith, the grains melting and fusing with only slight changes in pressure or temperature. However, Titan is so cold that ice behaves like rock. Thus, there is an ice-regolith complete with erosion and aeolian and/or sedimentary processes.

The &quot;Huygens&quot; probe used a penetrometer on landing to characterize the mechanical properties of the local regolith. The surface itself was reported to be a clay-like &quot;material which might have a thin crust followed by a region of relative uniform consistency.&quot; Subsequent data analysis suggests that surface consistency readings were likely caused by &quot;Huygens&quot; displacing a large pebble as it landed and that the surface is better described as a &#x27;sand&#x27; made of ice grains. The images taken after the probe&#x27;s landing show a flat plain covered in pebbles. The pebbles, which may be made of water ice, are somewhat rounded, which may indicate the action of fluids on them.

<doc id="204971" wikidata="Q1138494" url="?curid=204971" title="Historic counties of England">
<text>The historic counties of England are areas that were established for administration by the Normans, in many cases based on earlier kingdoms and shires created by the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Celts and others. They are alternatively known as &quot;ancient counties&quot;, &quot;traditional counties&quot;, &quot;former counties&quot; or simply as &quot;counties&quot;. In the centuries that followed their establishment, as well as their administrative function, the counties also helped define local culture and identity. This role continued even after the counties ceased to be used for administration after the creation of administrative counties in 1889, which were themselves amended by further local government reforms in the years following.

Unlike the partly self-governing boroughs that covered urban areas, the counties of medieval England existed primarily as a means of enforcing central government power, enabling monarchs to exercise control over local areas through their chosen representatives – originally sheriffs and later the lord-lieutenants – and their subordinate justices of the peace. Counties were used initially for the administration of justice, collection of taxes and organisation of the military, and later for local government and electing parliamentary representation. They continue to form the basis of modern local government areas in many parts of the country away from the main urban areas, although the newly created areas sometimes have considerably altered boundaries from the historic counties on which they are based.

==Nomenclature==

The name of a county often gives a clue to how it was formed, either as a division that took its name from a centre of administration, an ancient kingdom, or an area occupied by an ethnic group. The majority of English counties are in the first category, with the name formed by combining the central town with the suffix &quot;-shire&quot;, for example Yorkshire. Former kingdoms which became earldoms in the united England did not feature this formulation; so for Kent, Surrey and the Isle of Wight, the former kingdoms of the Jutes, &quot;...shire&quot; was not used. Counties ending in the suffix &quot;-sex&quot;, the former Saxon kingdoms, are also in this category. Some of these names include compass directions. The third category includes counties such as Cornwall and Devon where the name corresponds to the tribes who inhabited the area. County Durham is anomalous in terms of naming and origin, not falling into any of the three categories. Instead, it was a diocese that was turned into the County Palatine of Durham, ruled by the Bishop of Durham. The expected form would otherwise be &quot;Durhamshire&quot;, but it was rarely used.

There are customary abbreviations for many of the counties. In most cases, these consist of simple truncation, usually with an &quot;s&quot; at the end signifying &quot;shire&quot;, such as &quot;Berks&quot; for Berkshire or &quot;Bucks&quot; for Buckinghamshire. Some abbreviations are not obvious, such as &quot;Salop&quot; for Shropshire, from the Norman-derived word for its county town Shrewsbury; &quot;Oxon&quot; for Oxfordshire, from Latin &quot;Oxonia&quot; (referring to both the county and the city of Oxford); &quot;Hants&quot; for Hampshire; and &quot;Northants&quot; for Northamptonshire. Counties can be prefixed with &quot;County of&quot; in official contexts with any &quot;-shire&quot; suffix dropped, such as &quot;County of Kent&quot; or &quot;County of York&quot;. There is similar usage in the single case of Berkshire, a county with a &quot;-shire&quot; suffix which is not named after a town and whose correct formation is &quot;County of Berks&quot;. The &quot;-shire&quot; suffix was also appended for some counties, such as &quot;Devonshire&quot;, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; and &quot;Somersetshire&quot;, despite their origin. For instance, there has been an Earl of Devonshire since 1603, and Duke of Devonshire since 1694.

==History==
===Origins===
Great Britain was first divided into administrative areas by the Romans, most likely following major geographical features such as rivers. Before their arrival there were distinct tribal areas, but they were in a constant state of flux as territory was gained and lost. After the demise of Roman Britain around 410 these first divisions of land were generally abandoned, although traditional divisions taking the form of petty kingdoms such as Powys, Dumnonia and Elmet remained in those areas which remained British, such as south west England. The areas that would later form the English counties started to take shape soon afterwards, with the Kingdom of Kent founded by settlers around 445. In southern England more widely, shires emerged from earlier sub-kingdoms as part of the administrative structure of Wessex, which then imposed its system of shires, boroughs (or &quot;burhs&quot;) and &quot;ealdormen&quot; on Mercia after it came under West Saxon control during the 10th century. Once the Kingdom of England was united as a whole in 927 it became necessary to subdivide it for administrative convenience and to this end, earldoms were created out of the earlier kingdoms, which were in turn subdivided into shires. The whole kingdom was divided into shires by the time of the Norman conquest. Robert of Gloucester accounts for thirty-five shires and William of Malmesbury thirty-two, Henry of Huntingdon, thirty-seven.

In Anglo-Saxon times the earl and sheriff were jointly responsible for administering each shire through its shire court. Each earl was responsible for multiple shires, with some fluctuation in which shires belonged to which earldoms during this period. In the years following the Norman conquest of 1066 the large earldoms of the Anglo-Saxon era were gradually replaced by smaller earldoms corresponding to a single shire. The Norman French term for an earl was a &quot;comte&quot; or count; whilst in England the title count was not used for the person, the territory they controlled nevertheless became known as a &#x27;county&#x27;. As the shires and counties were generally the same areas from the 12th century onwards, the terms shire and county came to be used interchangeably. The earls&#x27; role in administering their counties was gradually reduced as the shire court was eclipsed in importance by other courts, notably the assizes and quarter sessions. Later earldoms were created that were not named after a shire, particularly from the 17th century onwards, but by that time the title of earl was honorary, with no effective role in local administration.
Although all of England was divided into shires by the time of the Norman conquest, some counties were formed later, such as Lancashire in the 12th century. Perhaps because of their differing origins the counties varied considerably in size. The county boundaries were fairly static until the Local Government Act 1888. Each shire was responsible for gathering taxes for the central government; for local defence; and for justice, through assize courts.

====Southern England====
In southern England the counties were mostly subdivisions of the Kingdom of Wessex, and in many areas represented annexed, previously independent, kingdoms or other tribal territories. Kent derives from the Kingdom of Kent, Surrey from the Anglian word for &#x27;southern region&#x27;, and Essex, Sussex and Middlesex come from the East Saxons, South Saxons and Middle Saxons. Norfolk and Suffolk were subdivisions representing the &quot;North Folk&quot; and &quot;South Folk&quot; of the Kingdom of East Anglia. Only one county on the south coast of England now usually takes the suffix &quot;-shire&quot;: Hampshire, named after the former town of &quot;Hamwic&quot; (sic), the site of which is now a part of the city of Southampton. A &quot;lost&quot; Saxon county was Winchcombeshire which lasted from 1007 to 1017 before being incorporated into Gloucestershire. Dorset and Somerset derive their names from the &quot;saete&quot; or inhabitants of the areas around the towns of Dorchester and Somerton respectively; the names were first used by the Saxons in the 9th century. Devon and Cornwall were based on the pre-Saxon Celtic tribes known in Latin as the Dumnonii and Cornovii, in the latter case with the suffix &quot;wealas&quot;, meaning foreigners, added by the Saxons.

====Midlands====
When Wessex annexed Mercia in the 10th century, it subdivided the area into various shires of roughly equal size and tax-raising potential or hidage. These generally took the name of the main town (the county town) of the county, along with &quot;-shire&quot;. Examples are Northamptonshire and Warwickshire. In some cases the original names have been worn down: for example, Cheshire was originally &quot;Chestershire&quot;.

In the east Midlands, it is thought that county boundaries may represent a 9th-century division of the Danelaw between units of the Danish army. Rutland was an anomalous territory or soke, associated with Nottinghamshire, but it eventually became considered the smallest county. Lincolnshire was the successor to the Kingdom of Lindsey, and took on the territories of Kesteven and Holland when Stamford became the only Danelaw borough to fail to become a county town.

====Northern England====
Much of Northumbria was also shired, the best known of these counties being Hallamshire and Cravenshire. The Normans did not use these divisions, and so they are not generally regarded as ancient counties. The huge county of Yorkshire was a successor to the Viking kingdom of York and the Brittonic kingdom of Elmet; at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 it was considered to include what was to become northern Lancashire, as well as parts of Cumberland, and Westmorland. Most of the later Cumberland and Westmorland were under Scottish rule until 1092. After the Norman Conquest in 1066 and the harrying of the North, much of the North of England was left depopulated and was included in the returns for Cheshire and Yorkshire in the Domesday Book. However, there is some disagreement about the status of some of this land. The area in between the River Ribble and the River Mersey, referred to as in the Domesday Book, was included in the returns for Cheshire. Whether this meant that this land was actually part of Cheshire is however not clear. The Northeast land that later became County Durham and Northumberland, was left unrecorded.

Cumberland, Westmorland, Lancashire, County Durham and Northumberland were established as counties in the 12th century. Lancashire can be firmly dated to 1182. Part of the domain of the Bishops of Durham, Hexhamshire was split off and was considered an independent county until 1572, when it became part of Northumberland.

===Welsh border===
At the time of the Domesday Book, some parts of what later became Wales were included in English counties: Monmouth, for example, was included in Herefordshire. Additionally, the Domesday Book included, as part of Cheshire, areas that later became part of Wales, including the two hundreds of Atiscross and Exestan, and the southern part of Duddestan Hundred (as it was known as the time), which later became known as Maelor Saesneg (English Maelor), and (later still) &quot;Flintshire Detached&quot;. Parts of the March of Wales, which after the Norman conquest had been administered by Marcher Lords largely independently of the English monarch, were incorporated into the English counties of Shropshire, Herefordshire and Gloucestershire in 1535.

There was historic ambiguity as to the status of the county of Monmouthshire. As with other Marcher areas added to existing counties, it was created out of &quot;the said Country or Dominion of Wales&quot; by the Laws in Wales Act 1535. It was then added to the Oxford circuit of the English Assizes. For legal purposes it was regarded as part of England, but Laws since the late 19th century were often applied to &quot;Wales and Monmouthshire&quot;. It was listed among the English counties for parliamentary purposes until 1950 and for local government until 1974, but the Local Government Act 1972 unambiguously included the area as part of Wales.

===Counties corporate===

A charter of Henry I in about 1130 gave the City of London its own Sheriff. The Sheriff of London also had jurisdiction over the county of Middlesex, so that &quot;London and Middlesex were from that time regarded as one from an administrative point of view&quot;, although they retained their separate identities. This relationship continued until the Local Government Act 1888 created a new office of High Sheriff of Middlesex appointed in the same manner as other English and Welsh counties, created the County of London with its own high sheriff, and restricted the jurisdiction of the sheriffs of London to the City.

During the Middle Ages a number of other large cities and towns were granted the status of self-governing counties separate from adjacent counties. Such a county became known as a county corporate or &quot;county of itself&quot;. For most practical purposes this separate status was replaced in the late 19th century when county boroughs were introduced.

Bristol developed as a major port in the medieval period, straddling both sides of the River Avon which formed the ancient boundary between Gloucestershire and Somerset. In 1373 Edward III decreed

Similar arrangements were later applied to Norwich (1404), Southampton (1447), Canterbury (1471), Gloucester (1483), Exeter (1537), and Poole (1571).

Charters were granted constituting the boroughs or cities of Lincoln (1409), Nottingham (1448), Lichfield (1556) and Worcester (1622) as counties. The County of the City of Coventry was separated from Warwickshire in 1451, and included an extensive area of countryside surrounding the city.

Charters granting separate county status to the cities and boroughs of Chester (1238/9), York (1396), Newcastle upon Tyne (1400) and Kingston-upon-Hull (with the surrounding area of Hullshire) (1440). In 1551 Berwick upon Tweed, on the border with Scotland, was created a county corporate.

=== Exclaves ===

The ancient counties have many anomalies, and many small exclaves, where a parcel of land was politically part of one county despite not being physically connected to the rest of the county. The Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 was passed, the effect of which was to treat many of these exclaves as part of the county which surrounded them. This had already been done for Parliamentary purposes under the Great Reform Act 1832.

Large exclaves affected by the 1844 Act included the County Durham exclaves of Islandshire, Bedlingtonshire and Norhamshire, which were subsequently treated as hundreds of Northumberland; and those parts of Halesowen forming part of Shropshire, which was subsequently treated as part of Worcestershire, as the remainder already was.

Exclaves that the 1844 Act did not touch included the part of Derbyshire around Donisthorpe, locally in Leicestershire; a part of Huntingdonshire near Woodbury Park, separated by Cambridgeshire; and most of the larger exclaves of Worcestershire, including the town of Dudley, which remained surrounded by Staffordshire. Additionally, the Furness portion of Lancashire remained separated from the rest of Lancashire by a narrow strip of Westmorland — though it was accessible by way of the Morecambe Bay tidal flats.

===1889===
When the first county councils were set up in 1889, they covered newly created entities known as administrative counties. Several historic subdivisions with separate county administrations were also created administrative counties, particularly the separate ridings of Yorkshire, the separate parts of Lincolnshire, and the East and West divisions of Sussex. The Local Government Act 1888 also contained wording to create both a new &quot;administrative county&quot; and a &quot;county&quot; of London, and to ensure that the county boroughs which were created at the same time continued for non-administrative purposes to be part of the county which they geographically lay. These counties were to be used &quot;for all purposes, whether sheriff, lieutenant, custos rotulorum, justices, militia, coroner, or other&quot;. The effect was that new county boroughs which were counties corporate retained their status as separate counties. In retrospect, these &quot;statutory&quot; counties can be identified as the predecessors of the ceremonial counties of England. The censuses of 1891, 1901 and 1911 provided figures for the &quot;ancient counties&quot;.
Several towns are historically divided between counties, including Banbury, Burton upon Trent, Newmarket, Peterborough, Royal Tunbridge Wells, Royston, Stamford, Tamworth, Todmorden, Warrington and Wisbech. In Newmarket and Tamworth the historic county boundary runs right up the middle of the high street; in Royal Tunbridge Wells the historic county boundary had a theatre (now the Corn Exchange) built right on it, with the actors playing in Sussex to an audience in Kent; and in Todmorden, the historically fractious border between Lancashire and Yorkshire (the river known as Walsden Water) had Todmorden Town Hall built right on top of it on a culvert tunnel, dividing the hall down the middle between the two counties – a division reflected in its architecture. The 1888 Act ensured that every urban sanitary district would be considered to be part of a single county. This principle was maintained in the 20th century: when county boroughs such as Birmingham, Manchester, Reading and Sheffield expanded into neighbouring counties, the area added became associated with the county borough&#x27;s geographic county. However, this principle was not applied to Stockport or Cardiff, which remained divided, the latter even divided between Wales and England (from 1938 Cardiff included Rumney in the territory of the historic county of Monmouthshire, which was legally regarded as part of England until 1972 when it was instead assigned to Wales).

===1965 and 1974===
On 1 April 1965, a number of changes came into effect. The new administrative area of Greater London was created, resulting in the abolition of the administrative counties of London and Middlesex, at the same time taking in areas from surrounding counties. On the same date the new counties of Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely and of Huntingdon and Peterborough were formed by the merger of pairs of administrative counties. The new areas were also adopted for lieutenancy and shrievalty purposes.

In 1974 a major local government reform took place under the Local Government Act 1972. The Act abolished administrative counties and county boroughs, and divided England (except Greater London and the Isles of Scilly) into counties. These were of two types: &quot;metropolitan&quot; and &quot;non-metropolitan&quot; counties. Apart from local government, the new counties were &quot;substituted for counties of any other description&quot; for judicial, shrievalty, lieutenancy and other purposes. Several counties, such as Cumberland, Herefordshire, Rutland, Westmorland and Worcestershire, vanished from the administrative map, while new entities such as Avon, Cleveland, Cumbria and Humberside appeared, in addition to the six new metropolitan counties.

The built-up areas of conurbations tend to cross historic county boundaries freely. Examples are Bournemouth–Poole–Christchurch (Dorset and Hampshire) Greater Manchester (Cheshire, Derbyshire and Lancashire), Merseyside (Cheshire and Lancashire), Teesside (Yorkshire and County Durham), South Yorkshire (Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire), Tyneside (County Durham and Northumberland) and West Midlands (Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire). Greater London itself straddles five ancient counties — Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey — and the London urban area sprawls into Buckinghamshire and Berkshire. The Local Government Act 1972 sought generally to unite conurbations within a single county, while retaining the historic county boundaries as far as was practicable.

===Postal counties===
In a period of financial crisis, the Post Office was able to alter many of its postal counties in accordance with the 1965 and 1974 reforms, but not all. The two major exceptions were Greater London and Greater Manchester. Greater London was not adopted in 1965, since, according to the Post Office at the time, it would have been too expensive to do so, while it gave as its reason for not adopting Greater Manchester the ambiguity of the name with the Manchester post town. Perhaps as a result of this, the ancient counties appear not to have fallen completely out of use for locating places in Greater Manchester, along with areas of Greater London that are not part of the London post town. It is common for people to speak of &quot;Uxbridge, Middlesex&quot;, &quot;Dagenham, Essex&quot; or &quot;Bromley, Kent&quot; (which are outside the London postal district), but much less so to speak of &quot;Brixton, Surrey&quot;, &quot;Greenwich, Kent&quot;, or &quot;West Ham, Essex&quot; (which are inside it).

In 1996, following further local government reform and the modernisation of its sorting equipment, the Royal Mail ceased to use counties at all in the direction of mail. Instead it now uses the outward code (first half) of the postcode. The former postal counties were removed in 2000 from its Postcode Address File database and included in an &quot;alias file&quot;, which is used to cross-reference details that may be added by users but are no longer required, such as former street names or historic, administrative and former postal counties.

During a public consultation in 2009 Postcomm found that many respondents objected to the use of counties in the alias file. In May 2010 Postcomm announced that it was encouraging Royal Mail to discontinue the use of counties in its alias file at the earliest opportunity. However, because some existing software included the use of counties, Royal Mail was advised not to implement the change before 2013.

===County cricket===
The historic counties of England continue to be used as the basis for county cricket teams and the governance of cricket in England through the ECB County Boards. There are exceptions in that Rutland is integrated with Leicestershire; the Isle of Wight has its own board outside the Hampshire one; there is a board for the ceremonial county of Cumbria which is representative of both Cumberland and Westmorland. In addition, the ECB County Boards include one for the country of Wales.

===Recognition of historic county boundaries===
A review of the structure of local government in England by the Local Government Commission for England led to the restoration of the East Riding of Yorkshire, Herefordshire, Rutland and Worcestershire as administrative areas in the 1990s; the abolition of Avon, Cleveland and Humberside within 25 years of their creation; and the restoration of the traditional borders between Somerset and Gloucestershire (except at Bristol), County Durham and Yorkshire (towards the mouth of the River Tees; not in Teesdale), and Yorkshire and Lincolnshire for ceremonial purposes in these areas. The case of Huntingdonshire was considered twice, but the Commission found that &quot;there was no exceptional county allegiance to Huntingdonshire, as had been perceived in Rutland and Herefordshire&quot;.

The Association of British Counties (ABC), with its regional affiliates, such as the Friends of Real Lancashire and the Yorkshire Ridings Society, promotes the historic counties. It states that the &quot;&quot;...ABC contends that Britain needs a fixed popular geography, one divorced from the ever changing names and areas of local government...The ABC, therefore, seeks to fully re-establish the use of the historic counties as the standard popular geographical reference frame of Britain and to further encourage their use as a basis for social, sporting and cultural activities.&quot;

The Campaign for Historic Counties is dedicated to campaigning, both in the public arena and among parliamentarians, for the restoration of historic counties. Their objectives are:

# Maps, roads and addresses to included historic counties as standard
# Removal of the word &#x27;county&#x27; from all local council names
# Historic Counties to be used for ceremonial purposes

In 2013, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles formally recognised and acknowledged the continued existence of England&#x27;s 39 historic counties. On 23 April 2014 a new initiative was announced to support the &#x27;tapestry&#x27; of traditional English counties, including the removal of a restriction preventing the names of traditional counties being displayed on street and road signs. In August 2014, the first road sign was erected to mark the boundary of the historic county of Yorkshire. The Government is also publishing a new online interactive map of England&#x27;s county boundaries. The Government has previously changed rules to allow local and county flags to be flown without planning permission, and supported the Flag Institute in encouraging a new wave of county and community flags to be designed and flown by local communities. The flags of England&#x27;s historic counties have been flown from Government offices in support of these identities. All 39 counties have registered flags, with the flag of Leicestershire the last to be adopted. In July 2019 the UK Government published official guidance on Celebrating the Historic Counties of England, stating that 
&quot;the tapestry of England&#x27;s historic counties is one of the bonds which draws our nation together&quot;.

Sussex and Yorkshire, both historic counties and long abandoned as units for administrative purposes, have continued to be widely recognised as cultural regions, significant in sport and used by many organisations as regional units. These counties, and several others, have a county day in which the culture and history of the historic county is celebrated; many of these county days were created in the 21st century.

A direct action group, CountyWatch, was formed in 2004 to remove what its members consider to be wrongly placed county boundary signs that do not mark the historic or traditional county boundaries of England and Wales. They have removed, resorted or erected a number of what they claim to be &quot;wrongly sited&quot; county boundary signs in various parts of England. For instance, in Lancashire 30 signs were removed. CountyWatch has been criticised for such actions by the councils that erected the signs: Lancashire County Council pointed out that the taxpayers would have to pay for the signs to be re-erected.

The only political party with a manifesto commitment to restore the boundaries and political functions of all ancient counties, including Middlesex and Monmouthshire, is the English Democrats Party.

==Functions==
By the late Middle Ages the county was being used as the basis of a number of functions.

===Administration of justice and law enforcement===
The Assize Courts used counties, or their major divisions, as a basis for their organisation. Justices of the peace originating in Norman times as Knights of the Peace, were appointed in each county. At the head of the legal hierarchy were the High Sheriff and the Custos rotulorum (keeper of the rolls) for each county.

The justices had responsibility for maintaining county gaols and houses of correction. During the 19th century penal reformers campaigned against the often primitive conditions in gaols, and under the Prison Act 1877 they came under Home Office control.

Until the 19th century law enforcement was mostly carried out at the parish level. With an increasingly mobile population, however, the system became outdated. Following the successful establishment of the Metropolitan Police in London, the County Police Act 1839 empowered justices of the peace to form county constabularies outside boroughs. The formation of county police forces was made compulsory by the County and Borough Police Act 1856.

===Defence===
In the 1540s the office of Lord Lieutenant was instituted. The lieutenants had a military role, previously exercised by the sheriffs, and were made responsible for raising and organising the militia in each county. The lieutenancies were subsequently given responsibility for the Volunteer Force. In 1871 the lieutenants lost their positions as heads of the militia, and their office became largely ceremonial. The Cardwell and Childers Reforms of the British Army linked the recruiting areas of infantry regiments to the counties.

===Parliamentary representation===
Each English county sent two Knights of the Shire to the House of Commons (in addition to the burgesses sent by boroughs). Yorkshire gained two members in 1821 when Grampound was disenfranchised. The Great Reform Act 1832 reapportioned members throughout the counties, many of which were also split into parliamentary divisions. Constituencies based on the ancient county boundaries remained in use until 1918.

===Local government===
From the 16th century onwards the county was increasingly used as a unit of local government as the justices of the peace took on various administrative functions known as &quot;county business&quot;. This was transacted at the quarter sessions, summoned four times a year by the lord lieutenant. By the 19th century the county magistrates were exercising powers over the licensing of alehouses, the construction of bridges, prisons and asylums, the superintendence of main roads, public buildings and charitable institutions, and the regulation of weights and measures. The justices were empowered to levy local taxes to support these activities, and in 1739 these were unified as a single &quot;county rate&quot;, under the control of a county treasurer. In order to build and maintain roads and bridges, a salaried county surveyor was to be appointed.

By the 1880s it was being suggested that it would be more efficient if a wider variety of functions were provided on a county-wide basis.

===Subdivisions===
Some of the counties had major subdivisions. Of these, the most significant were the divisions of Yorkshire: the East Riding, West Riding, North Riding and the ainsty of York. Since Yorkshire was so large, its ridings became established as geographical terms quite apart from their original role as administrative divisions. The second largest county, Lincolnshire, was also sub divided into three historic &quot;parts&quot;: Parts of Lindsey, Holland and Kesteven, and the Parts of Lindsey was itself divided into three ridings (North Riding, South Riding and West Riding). Other divisions include the special status of Tower Hamlets within Middlesex, those of Sussex into East Sussex and West Sussex and Suffolk into East Suffolk and West Suffolk, and, more informally and hence more vaguely, of Kent into East Kent and West Kent.

Several counties had liberties or sokes within them that were administered separately. Cambridgeshire had the Isle of Ely, and Northamptonshire had the Soke of Peterborough. Such divisions were used by such entities as the Quarter Sessions courts and were inherited by the later administrative county areas under the control of county councils.

Most English counties were subdivided into smaller subdivisions called hundreds. Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire and Lincolnshire were divided into wapentakes (a unit of Danish origin), while Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland and Westmorland were divided into wards, areas originally organised for military purposes, each centred on a castle. Kent and Sussex had an intermediate level between the county and hundreds, known as lathes in Kent and rapes in Sussex. Hundreds or their equivalents were divided into tithings and parishes (the only class of these divisions still used administratively), which in turn were divided into townships and manors. In the 17th century the Ossulstone hundred of Middlesex was further divided into four divisions, which replaced the functions of the hundred. The borough and parish were the principal providers of local services throughout England until the creation of ad-hoc boards and, later, local government districts.

==List of counties==
The historic counties are as follows:
The historic counties of England are included in the Index of Place Names (IPN) published by the Office for National Statistics. Each &quot;place&quot; included in the IPN is related to the historic county it lies within, as well as to a set of administrative areas.

==Administrative and ceremonial uses==
At the time of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England, the ancient counties continue to form, with considerably altered boundaries, many of the ceremonial and non-metropolitan counties in England. Some ancient counties have their names preserved in multiple contemporary units, such as Yorkshire in North Yorkshire and West Yorkshire or now correspond to another type of subdivision, such as the Huntingdonshire district. In some areas ancient counties have been abandoned for local government use and then later revived.

==Other uses==
The vice counties, used for biological recording since 1852, are largely based on historic county boundaries. They ignore all exclaves and are modified by subdividing large counties and merging smaller areas into neighbouring counties; such as Rutland with Leicestershire and Furness with Westmorland. The static boundaries make longitudinal study of biodiversity easier. They also cover the rest of Great Britain and Ireland.

==Footnotes==
*Note : 1889 areas recorded in 1891 census. Accurate measurements were not available until the 19th century, as a by-product of the Ordnance Survey&#x27;s boundary survey. The officially recorded areas were adjusted to match the new data at the time of the 1861 Census, replacing the less reliable figures previously used by the Registrar General.

<text>Country Joe and the Fish was an American psychedelic rock band formed in Berkeley, California, in 1965. The band was among the influential groups in the San Francisco music scene during the mid-to-late 1960s. Much of the band&#x27;s music was written by founding members Country Joe McDonald and Barry &quot;The Fish&quot; Melton, with lyrics pointedly addressing issues of importance to the counterculture, such as anti-war protests, free love, and recreational drug use. Through a combination of psychedelia and electronic music, the band&#x27;s sound was marked by innovative guitar melodies and distorted organ-driven instrumentals which were significant to the development of acid rock.

The band self-produced two EPs that drew attention on the underground circuit before signing to Vanguard Records in 1966. Their debut album, &quot;Electric Music for the Mind and Body&quot;, followed in 1967. It contained their only nationally charting single, &quot;Not So Sweet Martha Lorraine&quot;, and their most experimental arrangements. Their second album, &quot;I-Feel-Like-I&#x27;m-Fixin&#x27;-to-Die&quot;, was released in late 1967; its title track, with its dark humor and satire, became their signature tune and is among the era&#x27;s most recognizable protest songs. Further success followed, including McDonald&#x27;s appearance at Woodstock, but the group&#x27;s lineup underwent changes until its disbandment in 1970. Members of the band continue in the music industry as solo recording artists and sporadically reconvene.

==History==

===Formation (1965)===
The first lineup of Country Joe and the Fish formed in mid-1965, when Country Joe McDonald (vocals, acoustic guitar) and Barry &quot;The Fish&quot; Melton (lead guitar, vocals) came together as a duo. The two musicians had a background rooted in folk music, were enamored with the recordings of Woody Guthrie, and worked on the local acoustic coffeehouse circuit in the early 1960s. Melton honed his political protest prowess as a guitarist in Los Angeles, at venues such as the Ash Grove, before relocating to Berkeley, California, where he was a regular at the Jabberwock cafe. Prior to the group, McDonald set up two folk and jug bands, the Berkeley String Quartet and the Instant Jug Band, both of which served as outlets for his original material, and with the latter group including Melton. In addition, McDonald was a publisher of the left-wing underground magazine &quot;Et Tu Brute&quot;, which later became &quot;Rag Baby&quot;, containing poetry, drawings, and political messages. By early 1965, McDonald had become involved in the burgeoning folk scene in Berkeley, and the Free Speech Movement that was organizing demonstrations in University of California, Berkeley, which opposed the war in Vietnam. Not long afterwards, McDonald was inspired to record a &quot;talking issue&quot; of his magazine, and organized Country Joe and the Fish with Melton and fellow musicians Carl Schrager (washboard, kazoo), Bill Steele (bass guitar), and Mike Beardslee (vocals), out of both necessity of a recording alias and political device, to self-produce an extended play.

ED Denson, the co-publisher of &quot;Rag Baby&quot;, introduced McDonald to Chris Strachwitz, who owned Arhoolie Recording Studios, to self-produce the EP. Sensing the band&#x27;s potential, Denson assumed management control, and was responsible for coining the group&#x27;s name—a reference to Josef Stalin and to Mao Zedong&#x27;s description of revolutionaries as &quot;the fish who swim in the sea of the people&quot;. McDonald, who had recording experience, began utilizing Arhoolie Recording Studios to record four songs split equally between the band and a local folk musician, Peter Krug. It was during this time at Arhoolie Records that Country Joe and the Fish&#x27;s folk sound and political protest prowess—an amalgam of their own Guthrie-influenced material and their folk music roots—began to emerge. The band&#x27;s side of the EP featured two originals by McDonald, an acoustic version of &quot;I Feel Like I&#x27;m Fixin&#x27; to Die Rag&quot;, and &quot;Superbird&quot;. According to McDonald, &quot;The Fish Cheer&quot; was written in 30 minutes, with a purpose of expressing satiric and dark commentary on the US&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War. In October 1965, 100 copies of the EP, titled &quot;Rag Baby Talking Issue No. 1&quot;, were distributed on McDonald&#x27;s independent label at a Teach-in in UC Berkeley and underground shops selling &quot;Rag Baby&quot; magazine.

For a brief period, McDonald and Melton performed together as a duo at college campuses in the Northwest on behalf of Students for a Democratic Society before returning as regulars at the Jabberwock cafe. The two were joined by local jug band musicians, including Melton&#x27;s roommates, bass player Bruce Barthol and guitarist Paul Armstrong, and blues guitarist David Bennett Cohen, with whom Melton played in another jug band. The addition of drummer John Francis-Gunning rounded out the six-piece ensemble. It was during their residency at the Jabberwock that Country Joe and the Fish learned to play as a group and expand their repertoire. Within months, based on McDonald and Melton&#x27;s interest in the live performances of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, the recordings on Bob Dylan&#x27;s album, &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;, and their use of the mind-altering drug LSD, the group began equipping themselves with electric instruments and delving more into psychedelia. As a result, Cohen was moved over to the organ. Cohen&#x27;s experience with keyboards was limited to having played piano at a semiprofessional capacity at the Jabberwock, but, nonetheless, he quickly adapted to the qualities of the instrument. Melton describes the change of the group: &quot;Once we hit into the electric medium and into the rock medium, we were pandering to the public taste. We became extraordinarily popular. The little folk club where we used to play once every two weeks, we played every single night for a month, or something like that, and filled it. And after a while we filled &quot;two&quot; shows every single night&quot;.

Incidentally, the song &quot;Who Am I&quot; was written by McDonald for a play called &quot;Change Over&quot;, written by Fred Hayden. Each of the three verses was to be considered as sung by a different character.

===Electric music (1966–1968)===
As Country Joe and the Fish&#x27;s popularity grew, the band relocated to San Francisco in early 1966 and became popular fixtures at the Avalon and the Filmore Auditorium. On June 6, 1966, the band recorded a second self-produced EP, which was packaged separately from the &quot;Rag Baby&quot; magazine and, upon its release, debuted the new psychedelic rock incarnation of the group. The EP fulfilled the band&#x27;s ambitions to incorporate electric instruments into their music, effectively melding the instrumentals and pioneering an early template for the musical subgenre of acid rock. It included McDonald&#x27;s compositions &quot;(Thing Called) Love&quot; and &quot;Bass Strings&quot; on the A-side and the six-minute &quot;Section 43&quot; on the B-side. Music historian Richie Unterberger praised &quot;Section 43&quot;, saying its &quot;Asiatic guitar, tribal maracas, devious organ, floating harmonica, and ethereal mid-sections of delicate koto-like guitar picking rivaled the Paul Butterfield Blues Band&#x27;s &quot;East West&quot; as the finest psychedelic instrumental ever&quot;. Within three months, airplay of the EP spread across the new so-called progressive radio stations, reaching as far as New York City, and establishing Country Joe and the Fish as a nationally relevant musical act.

Through connections that Cohen had with record producer Samuel Charters, the group signed a recording contract with Vanguard Records in December 1966, just as the label, which had primarily released folk music, was attempting to branch out into the growing psychedelic rock scene. While the band waited to record their debut album, they were present at the Human Be-In, along with other influential San Francisco musical acts, including Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Quicksilver Messenger Service. The event was a prelude to the Summer of Love and helped publicize counterculture ideals such as ecology, free-love and the use of illicit drugs.

In February 1967, Country Joe and the Fish entered Sierra Sound Laboratories to record their debut album, &quot;Electric Music for the Mind and Body&quot;, with Charters and Denson overseeing the process. Prior to their studio work, Armstrong left the group and began a two-year alternative assignment as a conscientious objector, driving a truck for Goodwill Industries. Francis-Gunning was involved in the beginnings of the album&#x27;s development but left when the rest of the band complained about his drumming technique. He was replaced by Gary &quot;Chicken&quot; Hirsh. The next recording session was postponed for three days as the most recognizable lineup of Country Joe and the Fish rehearsed with their new drummer at the Barn, in Santa Cruz. Hirsh&#x27;s abilities were immediately distinguishable on the album, as he demonstrated an acute and articulate drum beat that music critic Bruce Eder praised as &quot;some of the best drumming on a psychedelic record this side of the late Spencer Dryden&quot;.
&quot;Electric Music for the Mind and Body&quot; was released on May 11, 1967. Much of the album&#x27;s material continued to expand upon the band&#x27;s new psychedelic medium, with it embracing all facets of the members&#x27; influences, which ranged from their folk roots, blues, raga rock and hard rock. The album also saw Cohen coming forward in a larger role with inventive distorted-organ melodies. In addition, McDonald&#x27;s lyrical content, which brazenly pronounced topics of political protest, recreational drug use, and love, augmented by satirical humor, clearly introduced the band&#x27;s orientation and message. The compositional structures followed discrete movement patterns emulating the style of John Fahey, whom McDonald admired. Though &quot;Electric Music for the Mind and Body&quot; was among the most complex works to date, it possessed the quality that several other San Francisco acts shared of being recorded mostly live, with only the vocals being overdubbed after the instrumentals were completed.

&quot;Electric Music for the Mind and Body&quot; was a success upon release, charting at number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and remains one of the most enduring psychedelic works of the counterculture era. A single, &quot;Not So Sweet Martha Lorraine&quot;, was distributed a month prior to the release of the album and became the only Country Joe and the Fish single to chart, peaking at number 98 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, in large part a culmination of its airplay on FM broadcasting and college stations. A reworked version of &quot;The Fish Cheer&quot; was intended to be released as a track on the album. However, Charters vetoed the decision to see whether the controversial song &quot;Superbird&quot; would face a radio ban. Nonetheless, the band was considered a forerunner in the emerging music scene in San Francisco, exhibiting one of the more polished debuts, just as its contemporaries were still refining their own sound. Melton attributes the album&#x27;s success, particularly in San Francisco, to the band&#x27;s appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967. Subsequently, the group toured the East Coast with an elaborate psychedelic light show.

The band returned to the studio, this time at Vanguard Studios in New York City, between July and September 1967. When &quot;Superbird&quot;, a tune mocking President Lyndon Johnson, was not banned from radio promotion, the band was given the go-ahead to record &quot;The Fish Cheer&quot;, which saw the group moving away from the original folk composition toward electric instrumentals more synthesized toward psychedelia. The song became the title track of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;I-Feel-Like-I&#x27;m-Fixin&#x27;-to-Die&quot;, released in November 1967. The album was not as successful as its predecessor, but still charted at number 67. The composition represented growing anti-war sentiment expressed by those opposing the Vietnam War, and is often considered one of the most recognized and celebrated protest songs of the era. &quot;The Fish Cheer&quot; was also pivotal in communicating the attitude against the war, but was set apart from other anti-war songs for its use of sarcastic humor and satire on the controversial conflict. Writer Lee Andresen reflects on the song&#x27;s meaning, saying, &quot;the happy beat and insouciance of the vocalist are in odd juxtaposition to the lyrics that reinforce the sad fact that the American public was being forced into realizing that Vietnam was no longer a remote place on the other side of the world, and the damage it was doing to the country could no longer be considered collateral, involving someone else.&quot;

The song met unprecedented exposure among the band&#x27;s young audience after a performance at the Schaefer Music Festival in New York City, in the summer of 1968. Hirsh suggested that instead of the opening chorus spelling &quot;fish&quot;, it would spell &quot;fuck&quot;, giving birth to the infamous &quot;Fuck Cheer&quot;. The crowd of young teenagers and college students applauded the act; however executives from &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; barred Country Joe and the Fish from their scheduled appearance on the program, and any other possible events. Hirsh never explained why he recommended the change in lyrics, but the act is seen as a social and political statement advocating free speech. The recorded version of &quot;The Fish Cheer&quot; received airplay, even on mainstream radio stations, which contributed to the success of the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Together&quot;, its most commercially successful. The album, released in August 1968, featured songwriting by all of the band members and charted at number 23 nationally.

===Lineup changes and Woodstock (1969–1970)===
In September 1968, Barthol left the band, just prior to their fourth album. His departure was due to the rest of the band&#x27;s unwillingness to partake in the Festival for Life, an event established by the Youth International Party in Chicago that was intended to have the participation of several well-known musicians attract thousands of spectators for the 1968 Democratic National Convention. However, the city refused to issue any permits, and the band members, by majority vote, decided to withdraw out of fear that their equipment would be damaged. After the festival resulted in riots and violent clashes between demonstrators and the police, Barthol&#x27;s conviction that Country Joe and the Fish should have held a larger role precipitated his departure from the group and move to England.

Between January 9 and 11, 1969, the band performed at the Fillmore West as a farewell to the group&#x27;s most famous lineup, with Jack Casady of Jefferson Airplane standing in as the bass player. The band was joined by Jerry Garcia, Jorma Kaukonen, Steve Miller, and Mickey Hart for the 38-minute finale, &quot;Donovan&#x27;s Reef Jam&quot;. Recordings from the concerts were later assembled on the live album &quot;Live! Fillmore West 1969&quot;, released on March 12, 1996. Hirsh and Cohen left soon after recording the group&#x27;s next album, &quot;Here We Are Again&quot;, and a new lineup was configured with Casady and David Getz, who formerly played drums with Big Brother and the Holding Company. The group released &quot;Here We Are Again&quot; in July 1969. It charted at number 48, and saw Country Joe and the Fish moving to a pop-oriented approach. Country Joe and the Fish&#x27;s personnel remained relatively stable for the next six months, though Peter S. Albin, also an alumnus of Big Brother and the Holding Company, replaced Casady at bass.

However, when McDonald reassembled the band for a last-minute scheduling at the Woodstock Festival, another personnel change resulted in the group&#x27;s final lineup, which included recruits Mark Kapner on keyboards, Doug Metzner on bass, and Greg Dewey on drums. Among the festival&#x27;s most memorable moments was McDonald&#x27;s unexpected solo performance on August 16, 1969, which included &quot;The Fuck Cheer&quot; as a finale. The audience receptively responded by chanting along with McDonald. McDonald&#x27;s rendition of &quot;The Fuck Cheer&quot; propelled the song into the mainstream culture in the U.S., and was featured on the &quot;Woodstock&quot; film, which was released on March 26, 1970. Radio stations regularly played both versions of the cheer, though the opposition to &quot;The Fuck Cheer&quot; limited its exposure to underground stations. In December 1969, McDonald began his own career outside the band, releasing cover versions of Guthrie-penned songs on &quot;Thinking of Woody Guthrie&quot;, and country standards on &quot;Tonight I&#x27;m Singing Just For You&quot;. All the while, the group looked to capitalize on the momentum from Woodstock and their appearance in the film, &quot;Zachariah&quot;, by releasing their fifth album, &quot;CJ Fish&quot;, in May 1970. The album was a moderate success, reaching number 111 nationally. However the band members lacked the motivation for touring and recording, which led to their disbandment in mid-1970.

===Aftermath and reunions===
McDonald pursued his solo recording career, which spans over 30 albums, and remains an active anti-war campaigner. He has also appeared in every Woodstock reunion festival since 1979. Melton performed solo as well, under the moniker &quot;The Fish&quot;, and later became a member of the Bay Area supergroup, Dinosaurs, in the 1980s. Since 1982, Melton was able to practice law in California and became a Public Defender of Yolo County, California until his retirement in June 2009. Country Joe and the Fish members sporadically reconvene, most notably when the classic 1967 lineup recorded &quot;Reunion&quot; in 1977. The lineup, except Melton, came together again as the Country Joe Band in 2004. In the same year, the group resumed touring, released the Barthol-penned single, &quot;Cakewalk to Baghdad&quot;, and the live album &quot;Live in Berkeley&quot;. Though the Country Joe Band disbanded in 2006, some of the members still occasionally tour together.

Hirsh died on August 17, 2021, at age 81. Barthol died on February 20, 2023, at age 75.

<doc id="204975" wikidata="Q213330" url="?curid=204975" title="Nicolas Flamel">
<text>Nicolas Flamel (; 1330 – 22 March 1418) was a French &quot;écrivain public&quot;, a draftsman of public documents such as contracts, letters, agreements and requests. He and his wife also ran a school that taught this trade. 

Long after his death, Flamel developed a reputation as an alchemist believed to have created and discovered the philosopher&#x27;s stone and to have thereby achieved immortality. These legendary accounts first appeared in the 17th century. According to texts ascribed to Flamel almost 200 years after his death, he had learned alchemical secrets from a Jewish &quot;converso&quot; on the road to Santiago de Compostela. He has since appeared as a legendary alchemist in various fictional works.

In modern historical publications Flamel is also often referred to as a copyist of manuscripts and a book seller, but research by M. and R. Rouse has demonstrated that this is not correct and that the very few historical documents that refer to him in this capacity do so mistakenly or are later forgeries.

==Life==

The historical Flamel lived in Paris in the 14th and 15th centuries, and his life is well documented thanks to many surviving sources that mention him. He ran two shops as a scribe and married Perenelle before 1373. She brought the wealth of two previous husbands to the marriage. The couple owned several properties and contributed financially to churches, sometimes by commissioning sculptures. Later in life, they were noted for their wealth and philanthropy.

Flamel lived into his 80s, and in 1410 designed his own tombstone, which was carved with the images of Jesus Christ, Saint Peter and Saint Paul. The tombstone is preserved at the Musée de Cluny in Paris. Records show that Flamel died in 1418. He was buried in Paris at the end of the nave of the former Church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie. His will, dated 22 November 1416, indicates that he was generous but that he did not have the extraordinary wealth of later alchemical legend. There is no indication that the real Flamel of history was involved in alchemy, pharmacy or medicine.

==House in Paris==
One of Flamel&#x27;s houses still stands in Paris, at 51 rue de Montmorency. It is the oldest stone house in the city. There is an old inscription on the wall, which states, &quot;We, plowmen and women living at the porch of this house, built in 1407, are requested to say every day an &#x27;Our Father&#x27; and an &#x27;Ave Maria&#x27; praying God that His grace forgive poor and dead sinners.&quot; As of 2008, the ground floor housed a restaurant. A Paris street near the Tour Saint-Jacques, the &quot;rue Nicolas Flamel&quot;, has been named after him; it intersects with the &quot;rue Pernelle&quot;, named after his wife.

==Posthumous reputation as an alchemist==

Legendary accounts of Flamel&#x27;s life are based on 17th-century works, primarily &quot;Livre des figures hiéroglyphiques&quot;. The essence of his reputation are claims that he succeeded at the two goals of alchemy: that he made the philosopher&#x27;s stone, which turns base metals into gold, and that he and his wife, Perenelle, achieved immortality through the &quot;Elixir of Life&quot;.

An alchemical book, published in Paris in 1612 as &quot;Livre des figures hiéroglyphiques&quot; and in London in 1624 as &quot;Exposition of the Hieroglyphical Figures&quot; was attributed to Flamel. It is a collection of designs purportedly commissioned by Flamel for a tympanum at the Cimetière des Innocents in Paris, long disappeared at the time the work was published. In the publisher&#x27;s introduction, Flamel&#x27;s search for the philosopher&#x27;s stone was described. According to that introduction, Flamel had made it his life&#x27;s work to understand the text of a mysterious 21-page book he had purchased in 1357, at the cost of two florins. The introduction claims that, around 1378, he traveled to Spain for assistance with translation. On the way back, he reported that he met a sage, who identified Flamel&#x27;s book as being a copy of the original &quot;The Book of Abraham the Jew&quot;. With this knowledge, over the next few years, Flamel and his wife allegedly decoded enough of the book to successfully replicate its recipe for the philosopher&#x27;s stone, producing first silver in 1382 and then gold. Also, Flamel is said to have studied some texts in Hebrew.

The validity of this story was first questioned in 1761 by Etienne Villain. He claimed that the source of the Flamel legend was P. Arnauld de la Chevalerie, publisher of &quot;Exposition of the Hieroglyphical Figures&quot;, who wrote the book under the pseudonym Eiranaeus Orandus. Other writers have defended the legendary account of Flamel&#x27;s life, which has been embellished by stories of sightings in the 17th and 18th centuries and expanded in fictitious works ever since.

Flamel had achieved legendary status within the circles of alchemy by the mid 17th century, with references in Isaac Newton&#x27;s journals to &quot;the Caduceus, the Dragons of Flammel&quot;. Interest in Flamel revived in the 19th century: Victor Hugo mentioned him in &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;, Erik Satie was intrigued by Flamel, and Albert Pike refers to Nicholas Flamel in his book &quot;Morals and Dogma of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry&quot;. Flamel&#x27;s reputation as an alchemist was further bolstered in the late 20th century by his depiction as the creator of the titular alchemical substance in the best-selling novel &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; and its film adaptation. He also appears in the 2018 spinoff film &quot;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald&quot;, where he is portrayed by Brontis Jodorowsky.

<doc id="204980" wikidata="Q2053636" url="?curid=204980" title="Ranulf de Glanvill">
<text>Ranulf de Glanvill (&quot;alias&quot; Glanvil, Glanville, Granville, etc., died 1190) was Chief Justiciar of England during the reign of King Henry II (1154–89) and was the probable author of &quot;Tractatus de legibus et consuetudinibus regni Anglie&quot; (&quot;The Treatise on the Laws and Customs of the Kingdom of England&quot;), the earliest treatise on the laws of England.

==Political and legal career==
There are no primary sources citing when or where he was born. He is first heard of as Sheriff of Yorkshire, Warwickshire and Leicestershire from 1163 to 1170 when, along with the majority of High Sheriffs, he was removed from office for corruption.

However, in 1173, he was appointed Sheriff of Lancashire and custodian of the honour of Richmond. In 1174, when he was Sheriff of Westmorland, he was one of the English leaders at the Battle of Alnwick, and it was to him that the king of Scotland, William the Lion, surrendered.

In 1175, he was reappointed Sheriff of Yorkshire, in 1176 he became justice of the king&#x27;s court and a justice itinerant in the northern circuit, and in 1180 Chief Justiciar of England. It was with his assistance that Henry II completed his famous judicial reforms, though many had been carried out before he came into office. He became the king&#x27;s right-hand man, and during Henry&#x27;s frequent absences was in effect regent of England. In 1176, he was also made custodian of Queen Eleanor, who was confined to her quarters in Winchester Castle.

After the death of Henry in 1189, Glanvill was removed from his office by Richard I on 17 September 1189 and imprisoned until he had paid a ransom, according to one authority, of £15,000. Shortly after obtaining his freedom he took the cross, and he died at the siege of Acre in 1190.

He founded two monasteries, both in Suffolk: Butley Priory, for Black Canons, was founded in 1171, and Leiston Abbey, for White Canons, in 1183. He also built a leper hospital at Somerton, in Norfolk.

==Marriage and progeny==

Ranulf married Bertha de Valoignes, daughter of Theobald de Valoines, lord of the manor of Parham, Suffolk, by whom he had three daughters:
* Matilda (Maud) de Glanville, who married Sir William de Auberville of Westenhanger, Kent: they were the founders of Langdon Abbey in Kent.
* Ammabil (Mabel) de Glanville, who married a certain &quot;de Arden&quot;.
* Helewis de Glanville, who married Robert fitz Ralph fitz Ribald: she was the foundress of Swainby Abbey, which was afterwards moved to Coverham Abbey, North Yorkshire.

==&quot;Tractatus de legibus&quot;==

Perhaps at the instigation of Henry II, Glanvill wrote or oversaw the writing of &quot;Tractatus de legibus et consuetudinibus regni Anglie&quot; (&quot;The Treatise on the Laws and Customs of the Kingdom of England&quot;), a practical discourse on the forms of procedure in the king&#x27;s court, which was often known simply as &quot;Glanvill&quot;. As the source of our knowledge regarding the earliest form of the &quot;curia regis&quot;, and for the information it affords regarding ancient customs and laws, it is of great value to the student of English history. It is now generally agreed that the work of Glanvill is of earlier date than the Scottish law book known from its first words as &quot;Regiam Majestatem&quot;, which bears a close resemblance to his.

The treatise of Glanvill was first printed in 1554. An English translation, with notes and introduction by John Beames, was published at London in 1812. A French version is found in various manuscripts, but has not yet been printed. The treatise was then edited and translated by G.D.G. Hall for the Oxford University Press in 1965.

The authorship of the &quot;Tractatus&quot;, while certainly within the sphere of Ranulf, is debated, other candidates for its authorship or co-authorship including Ranulf&#x27;s nephews Hubert Walter (Chief Justiciar and Lord Chancellor of England under Richard I) and Osbert fitzHervey.

<doc id="204983" wikidata="Q128740" url="?curid=204983" title="Dixon of Dock Green">
<text>Dixon of Dock Green is a BBC police procedural television series about daily life at a fictional London police station, with the emphasis on petty crime, successfully controlled through common sense and human understanding. It ran from 1955 to 1976. The central character, George Dixon, first appeared in the film &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; (1950). Dixon is a mature and sympathetic police constable, who was played by Jack Warner in all of the 432 episodes.

Dixon is the supposed embodiment of a typical &quot;bobby&quot; who would be familiar with the area in which he patrolled and its residents and often lived there himself. The series contrasted with later programmes such as &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, which more realistically reflected a more aggressive policing culture. It retained a faithful following throughout its run and was voted second-most popular programme on British television in 1961.

==Character and name origins==
The character of Police Constable George Dixon was based on an old-style British &quot;bobby&quot;—a slang term for policeman. Dixon first appeared in the Ealing Studios film &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; (1950) as a typical bobby on the beat, an experienced constable working out of the Paddington Green police station and nearing retirement. The film was produced by Michael Balcon, who had been educated at George Dixon School in Birmingham, named after a local politician: this inspired the character name.

In &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot;, Dixon has a wife named Em (Gladys Henson). It is mentioned that their only son, Bert, was killed in the Second World War—hence Dixon adopts a paternal aspect towards PC Andy Mitchell (Jimmy Hanley), a young policeman on his first day. Dixon comes across a raid and is shot. The rest of the film focuses on catching the perpetrator, a thug named Tom Riley (played by Dirk Bogarde). This gears up hugely once Dixon, who was said to be rallying in hospital, unexpectedly and suddenly dies, and Mitchell embarks on a perilous quest to find Tom Riley and bring him to justice.

==Series conception==
In 1955, the BBC Television Service was preparing to face competition from the forthcoming launch of the Independent Television network of commercial TV companies. The BBC therefore resurrected George Dixon for a new series featuring &quot;everyday stories of a London policeman&quot;. The series came with an already familiar hero, played (as in the film) by a much-loved entertainer. The image of Jack Warner in police uniform with helmet made for an effective symbol of policing in Britain.

Despite being a drama, the series was produced in its early years by the BBC&#x27;s light entertainment department. It was originally produced at the BBC&#x27;s Riverside and Lime Grove studios. Episodes in series 1 to 7 ran to 30 minutes. From series 3 to 7 each series&#x27; final episode was extended to 45 minutes. From series 8 (1961) onwards all episodes were 45, then 50, minutes in duration.

==Early series==
There were some changes made before the first series aired. Paddington Green police station became the fictitious Dock Green police station in the East End of London. The character of PC Andy Mitchell became raw new constable PC Andy Crawford (Peter Byrne). According to the first series episode &quot;Needle in a Haystack&quot; Dixon is a widower, his wife having died in an air raid during the Second World War, though they had an only daughter, Mary (played by Billie Whitelaw in early episodes, later replaced by Jeanette Hutchinson). They lived in a small mid-terrace house on a busy road. Dixon would remain basically the same character as in the film; he could be relied on to be friendly with a lot of heart, a cornerstone of which was his honesty with which you knew he would be absolutely dependable and cool in a crisis. The actor&#x27;s age meant Dixon was always an older bobby and the viewer was left to wonder why promotion hadn&#x27;t come his way earlier.

Dixon&#x27;s mentoring of Crawford was seen from &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&#x27;s&quot; first series opener, &quot;PC Crawford&#x27;s first Pinch&quot;, broadcast on Saturday 9 July 1955. Dixon was portrayed as having a paternal and steadying influence on his colleagues and episodes often highlighted the family-like nature of life in the station as well as Dixon&#x27;s actual family life at home. With his experience as a police constable frequently in evidence, he was often shown as being able to solve crimes and to keep the peace using his knowledge of human behaviour and of the Dock Green area. The initial run of six episodes ended on 13 August with the &quot;London Pride&quot; segment and was deemed a success; a further series of 13 episodes was commissioned to start broadcasting on 9 June 1956. Plots often focused on the role of the police in dealing with low-level, community-based crimes.

The last five episodes from series two are the earliest episodes of &quot;Dixon&quot; known to exist. One of those is &quot;The Rotten Apple&quot; (broadcast 11 August 1956), a story which illustrates Dixon&#x27;s belief in the honour of wearing the police uniform. A young constable, Tom Carr (Paul Eddington) appears to be enjoying a lifestyle that was more lavish than would be expected on his salary. His life begins to unravel after Dixon gets a visit from a local (legal) horse bookmaker, Maurie Weitzman (Harry Ross), to whom Carr owes a lot of money: Weitzman needs it back but knows Carr will lose his job if he makes his complaint official. With the force&#x27;s reputation at stake, Dixon visits a nervous Carr in his flat changing into his uniform. Carr agrees to settle the debt, but as Dixon prepares to leave, accidentally knocks over a box, sending silverware clattering across the floor. The items, it transpires, are stolen, and the proceeds of a series of mysterious burglaries in the area. Dixon is affronted by this betrayal of trust, and orders the disgraced Carr to remove his uniform before he will escort him through the streets to Dock Green Station.

Series two ended on 1 September 1956 with the episode &quot;Father-in-Law&quot;. Dixon is the father-in-law of the title, with Andy Crawford marrying his 23-year-old daughter, Mary. Dixon gets to sing a few songs at the wedding, but a small matter of a missing wallet emerges. At the end of the episode, with the mystery solved, Dixon wishes the viewers goodbye while the happy couple go off, to move to a flat in Chelmsford. An indicator of the series&#x27; success is that the start of series three was a mere four months away.

In the early days, a subtitle declared the series to be &quot;Some Stories of a London Policeman&quot;, with each episode starting with Dixon speaking directly to the camera (breaking the &quot;fourth wall&quot;). He begins with a salute and the greeting &quot;Good evening all&quot;, which was changed to &quot;Evening all&quot; in the early 1970s, which has lived on in Britain as a jocular greeting. In similar fashion, episodes finished with a few words to camera from Dixon in the form of philosophy on the evils of crime, before saluting and wishing the viewers &quot;Goodnight, all&quot;. Some felt Dixon to be a real person; at the end of a series, he would inform the audience that he was &quot;going on holiday for a few weeks&quot; so they shouldn&#x27;t worry about not seeing him around.

As Ted Willis noted, in bringing Dixon to the small screen, he sought to portray &quot;an ordinary, working-class policeman on the beat&quot; with focus more on people, with the tendency to &quot;concentrate on the smaller everyday type of crime, and put the emphasis on people rather than problems.&quot; Willis talked in 1957 about seeking &quot;to break away from the accepted formula for police and crime stories [...] The average policeman might go through a life-time of service without being involved in one murder case. His life is one of routine [...] Would [viewers] take simple, human stories about a simple ordinary copper and the people he meets?&quot; Change for the central character was slow, and it took until the opening episode of series 11 before George Dixon earned his stripes and was promoted to sergeant in &quot;Facing the Music&quot; (S11, E01, 19 September 1964).

==Later series==
The series evolved, though slowly, Ted Willis ensuring that the familiarity of the format remained its greatest strength for many years. The procedural detail formed a backbone on top of which the dramatic story played out, allowing the whole to make perfect sense. Often delivered at a genteel pace, this approach led to criticism from some quarters in the face of faster-paced (and sometimes more violent) contemporaries such as &quot;The Sweeney&quot; and even &quot;Z-Cars&quot;. Overall, the show ran for 22 series. Fans continued their support for the character with each new series. When Dixon was shot in one episode, the BBC received 4,000 letters of anxious inquiry and had it announced on television that Jack was all right. Other characters were not forgotten; indeed, PC Andy Crawford – as well as being the main character&#x27;s son-in-law – would go on to rise through the ranks of the CID to become chief inspector in Dock Green.

&quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; is sometimes unfavourably compared with later police procedural series (such as &quot;Z-Cars&quot; in the 1960s, &quot;The Sweeney&quot; in the 1970s and &quot;The Bill&quot; in the 1980s) which were seen as having a higher degree of realism due to their harder-hitting and more dynamic nature. However, the style of the programme did evolve over time, and some of the 1970s episodes which have been preserved demonstrate little of the homely nature for which the show was often criticised. Plot lines in this period included the suspected suicide of a police officer, a gangland killing, and the shooting of a suspect by police officers using firearms. Police in the UK do not routinely carry firearms, and in the 1970s guns were rarely ever seen in their hands.

&quot;Firearms Were Issued&quot; (20 April 1974, one of the surviving episodes) examines that last point. A notorious gang of bank robbers has performed a raid locally, and Dock Green police are tipped off &quot;from a reliable source&quot; that they have retreated into a suburban house on their patch. Taking no chances, the go-ahead for a raid is given, and Sergeant George Dixon issues firearms to D.I. Andy Crawford and his team. With the gang attempting to flee under cover of darkness, shots are fired, including two from Crawford. At least one of these apparently hits and kills the target in the dark, the truth of which only comes to light later during the investigation that is quickly launched back at Dock Green police station. All officers are quizzed and re-quizzed by a senior external CID officer, going over the rights and wrongs of each step, looking for accountability. Everyone involved is left in no doubt as to the consequences of their actions, should they prove to be truthfully theirs. In retrospect, the process can be seen as primitive compared to the in-depth procedural investigations of the 21st century, but was rarely touched on in contemporary productions. The detail ensured that neither characters nor viewers could be completely sure about the outcome, ensuring gripping television drama.

By the final years of the series in the 1970s, Warner was in his late seventies and looking increasingly implausible in uniform, mandatory retirement age being 55. This led to the formerly supportive police no longer regarding the character as a credible advertisement for the force. Warner had increasing difficulty moving about, which was helped slightly by a treatment involving bee stings. When it became known that the 1976 series of eight episodes would be the last, some changes saw familiar faces including long-standing and popular cast member Peter Byrne leave, bringing in some new blood. The final series was shown in 1976 when Warner was 80 and the producers saw the opportunity to make some changes to the format. George Dixon was shown as retired from the police and being re-employed as a civilian as the collator, a temporary appointment which allowed him to train up whoever would be the next permanent collator. The introductory monologue and winding-up speech continued to be delivered by George Dixon, now out of uniform and behind his collator&#x27;s desk. There was an increase in action whilst retaining detailed storytelling with Dixon&#x27;s values at the core.

The last series of eight episodes ended on Saturday 1 May 1976 with &quot;Reunion&quot;. Lord Willis said, &quot;I knew it had to come to an end sometime and I thought something was in the wind. They usually renew my Dock Green contract in February and it hasn&#x27;t been renewed this time&quot;. There were thoughts about continuing with the current cast using the revamped format, though any continuation would have been under a different title. Any ideas and plans were never seriously followed up and after 21 years of &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, with its lead character out of the picture, the series came to a natural end.

==Reception==
===Jack Warner===
Warner&#x27;s success as Dixon was well received by police forces. He was made an honorary member of both the Margate and Ramsgate police forces in the 1950s. Warner said of &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; in 1976: &quot;It has been a very good meal ticket for twenty-one years—although the taxman has never been far behind.&quot; In his autobiography, &quot;Jack of All Trades&quot;, Warner tells of a visit by Queen Elizabeth II to the studios where the series was made, where she commented &quot;that she thought &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; had become part of the British way of life&quot;.

The regard in which Warner&#x27;s portrayal of a fictional policeman was held was seen at the actor&#x27;s funeral at Margate Crematorium on 1 June 1981. Six Margate constables stood as guards-of-honour outside the chapel while delegations of officers attended (some coming from Wales and Newcastle upon Tyne), including 16 from the Metropolitan Police, led by Deputy Assistant Commissioner George Rushbrook and Commander John Atkins.

===Criticism===
Over the two decades-plus that &quot;Dixon&quot; was broadcast, it came in for increasing criticism, especially in its later years. &quot;The Guinness Book of Classic Television&quot; described the programme as &quot;an anachronism by the time it ended and a dangerous one at that&quot;. Ted Willis summarised the changing critical reception for &quot;Dixon&quot; in an article published in the &quot;TV Times&quot; in 1983: &quot;In the first years, the critics were almost unanimous in their acclaim for &quot;Dock Green&quot;, hailing it as a breakthrough, praising its realism. But slowly, the view began to change. We were accused of being too cosy and the good word was reserved for series like &quot;No Hiding Place&quot;, &quot;Z-Cars&quot; and &quot;Softly, Softly&quot;. These, in turn, were superseded by the violent, all-action type of police drama like &quot;The Sweeney&quot;.&quot; He also stated that: &quot;Eighty per cent of police work is ordinary and unsensational.&quot;

Willis made some further observations. He found that, in fact and fiction, characters akin to Jack Regan in &quot;The Sweeney&quot; were to be underplayed by the police who sought to restore their place in modern communities. The surviving episodes (with an emphasis on the latter years of the programme) which saw DVD releases allowed &quot;Dixon&quot; to be seen less deserving of its reputation as a &quot;cosy&quot; stereotype, and more as a programme that tells the stories honestly and entertainingly. Willis noted that it would be harder for the police to build relationships with the public if they were continually to go around beating up every suspect.

Indeed, Alan Plater, who was a writer for &quot;Z-Cars&quot; early in his career, argued in 1976 (published in the police publication &quot;Context&quot;); &quot;It is just as irresponsible to portray the police as always chasing murderers and big-time criminals as it is to show them as boy scouts like George Dixon. &quot;The Sweeney&quot; is ridiculous. It&#x27;s James Cagney and the Sundance Kid rolled into one and given a British background.&quot;

== Locations ==
The police station featured in the original opening titles was the old Ealing police station, at 5 High Street, just north of Ealing Green.

The opening and closing moments of each episode originally had PC Dixon delivering the famous lines &quot;Evening, all&quot; and &quot;Goodnight, all&quot;, and a suitably moral homily, from outside Dock Green police station. However, most of these sequences were not filmed at Ealing police station—then still operational—but on the front steps of the (1902) Ealing Grammar School for Boys on Ealing Green. The BBC would attach a blue lamp next to the double doors, and the front oak-floored vestibule of the old school would warmly glow behind. During later series Dixon addressed the audience standing in front of a painted backdrop of a London skyline.

The 1973 episode &quot;Eye Witness&quot; shows a shot of a derelict warehouse complex with a sign identifying it as part of the Metropolitan &amp; New Crane Wharves; these are located in Wapping Wall. This episode also shows the bascule bridge across the entrance to Shadwell Basin in Wapping. The warehouse is long gone; a supermarket now occupies the site.

At the end of the 1975 episode &quot;Conspiracy&quot;, the exterior of Dock Green police station is represented by the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s then recently built Chiswick police station, on Chiswick High Road in west London.

==Archive status==
Most of the original 432 episodes of &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; are still missing due both to the programme being broadcast live and not recorded in the early days, and the BBC&#x27;s later policy of reusing video tapes for new programmes. Only 33 episodes still exist in full and extracts exist for a further 19. In February 2024 it was announced that the previously missing Series 5 episode &quot;Duffy Calls the Tune&quot; was recovered.

In an episode of &quot;What&#x27;s On Talking Pictures TV With Noel&quot; in September 2024, Noel Cronin of Talking Pictures TV revealed that 3 missing episodes were found during the broadcast of the channel&#x27;s repeat run of all surviving episodes in 2024 but did not state what they were.

===Series 22===
This is the only series where all episodes - eight in all (see under &quot;DVD releases&quot; below for details) - survive intact in the archive.

An out-take sequence also exists from &quot;It&#x27;s a Gift&quot; (Series 21, Episode 3 – 1 March 1975) involving two criminals in which one of them, played by Victor Maddern, finds himself unable to deliver correctly the required line &quot;It&#x27;s down at Dock Green nick!&quot; – referring to a stolen necklace. After two failed attempts, in which the line is spoken both as &quot;It&#x27;s down at Dock Green dick!&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s down at Dick Green dock!&quot;, Maddern asks the unseen director (Vere Lorrimer) &quot;Couldn&#x27;t I just say &#x27;It&#x27;s down at the nick&#x27;?&quot;

==Music==
The British music hall song &quot;Maybe It&#x27;s Because I&#x27;m a Londoner&quot; was used originally as the theme song. It was composed by Hubert Gregg but was replaced with an instrumental theme composed by Jeff Darnell. This was later released as a single under the name &quot;An Ordinary Copper&quot;. Darnell was Warner&#x27;s original piano act partner in the 1940s. The harmonica was played by Tommy Reilly. Original incidental music for the early (1950s) series was written by Alan Yates (1912–1991).

==Dixon in other shows==
&quot;Christmas Night With The Stars&quot; was a BBC television show broadcast each Christmas night from 1958 to 1972 (with the exception of 1961, 1965 and 1966). The show featured specially made short seasonal editions (typically about 10 minutes long) of the previous year&#x27;s most successful BBC sitcoms and light entertainment programmes. &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; contributed short editions in the 1959, 1962, and 1963 shows, and featured some of the main members of the Dixon cast in Christmas Night with the Stars.

&quot;The Black and Blue Lamp&quot; by Arthur Ellis was screened in the BBC2 &quot;Screenplay&quot; series of drama plays on 7 September 1988. In the play – which begins with a montage of key scenes from &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; – Tom Riley (Sean Chapman) and PC Hughes (Karl Johnson) are projected forwards into a violent parody of 1980s police procedurals called &quot;The Filth&quot;. Once there, they meet the corrupt Superintendent Cherry (Kenneth Cranham) and Superintendent Hammond (John Woodvine) and discover just how much policing has changed between the two periods.

One of Dixon&#x27;s closing monologues from &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; was recycled for the final scene of &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; in 2010. As in &quot;The Black and Blue Lamp&quot;, characters in &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; and its predecessor, &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, were seemingly sent into different eras of policing. Moreover, Dixon&#x27;s resurrection for &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, after he was killed in &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; and the fact that he apparently continued to serve as a police officer well past the usual retirement age find a parallel in the stories of the principal characters in &quot;Life on Mars&quot; and &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, being explained in the final episode.

The ending credits to the show were seen in the 2016 animated film &quot;Ethel &amp; Ernest&quot;.

<text>Ambrose Powell Hill Jr. (November 9, 1825April 2, 1865) was a Confederate general who was killed in the American Civil War. He is usually referred to as A. P. Hill to differentiate him from Confederate general Daniel Harvey Hill, who was unrelated.

A native Virginian, Hill was a career United States Army officer who had fought in the Mexican–American War and Seminole Wars before joining the Confederate States Army. After the start of the American Civil War, he gained early fame as the commander of the &quot;Light Division&quot; in the Seven Days Battles. He became one of Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s ablest subordinates, distinguishing himself in the 1862 battles of Cedar Mountain, Second Bull Run, Antietam, and Fredericksburg.

Following Jackson&#x27;s death in May 1863 at the Battle of Chancellorsville, Hill was promoted to lieutenant general and commanded the Third Corps of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia, which he led in the summer Gettysburg Campaign and the fall campaigns of 1863. His command of the corps in 1864–65 was interrupted on multiple occasions by illness, from which he did not return until just before the end of the war. He was killed during the Union Army&#x27;s offensive at the Third Battle of Petersburg.

==Early life and education==
Hill, known to his family as &quot;Powell&quot; (and to his soldiers as &quot;Little Powell&quot;), was born in Culpeper, Virginia, the seventh and final child of Thomas and Fannie Russell Baptist Hill. Powell was named for his uncle, Ambrose Powell Hill (1785–1858), who served in both houses of the Virginia legislature, and Capt. Ambrose Powell, an Indian fighter, explorer, sheriff, legislator, and close friend of President James Madison. The younger Powell Hill lived with his family in a home on North Main Street in Culpeper as a child from age four or age seven.

Hill was nominated to enter the United States Military Academy in 1842 in a class that started with 85 cadets. He made friends easily, including such prominent future generals as Darius N. Couch, George Pickett, Jesse L. Reno, George Stoneman, Truman Seymour, Cadmus M. Wilcox, and George B. McClellan. His future commander, Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson, was in the same class, but the two did not get along. Hill had a higher social status in Virginia and valued having a good time in his off-hours. In contrast, Jackson scorned levity and practiced his religion more fervently than Hill could tolerate.

In 1844, Hill returned from a furlough with a case of gonorrhea, causing medical complications that caused him to miss so many classes that he had to repeat his third year. Reassigned to the class of 1847, he made new friendships, in particular with Henry Heth and Ambrose Burnside. Hill continued to suffer from the effects of the STI for the rest of his life, being plagued with recurrent prostatitis, which was not treatable before the advent of antibiotics. He may have also suffered urinary incontinence due to inflammation of the prostate pressing on his urethra, which could also lead to uremic poisoning and kidney damage.

He graduated in 1847, ranking 15th of 38. He was appointed to the 1st U.S. Artillery as a brevet second lieutenant. He served in a cavalry company during the final months of the Mexican–American War but fought in no major battles. After some garrison assignments along the Atlantic seaboard, he served in the Seminole Wars, again arriving near the war&#x27;s end and fighting various minor skirmishes. He was promoted to first lieutenant in September 1851.

==Career==
Robertson&#x27;s biography of Hill quotes his wife Kitty as saying her husband &quot;never owned slaves and never approved of the institution of slavery.&quot; His family, however, was involved with the institution. In the 1850 census, Thomas Hill (Hill&#x27;s father) enslaved 20 people in Culpeper County. Ten years later, Thomas Hill Jr. enslaved at least 38 people in Culpeper County. Hill&#x27;s uncle Ambrose P. Hill, for whom he was named, was also a major planter in Culpeper County, Virginia, based on using enslaved labor. In the 1840 census, the senior Ambrose P. Hill enslaved 32 people, 30 people in the 1850 census, and 10 in 1860.

From 1855 to 1860, A. P. Hill worked for the United States Coast Survey. He was once engaged to Ellen B. Marcy before her parents pressured her to break off the engagement. She married Hill&#x27;s West Point roommate George B. McClellan, who later was Commanding General of the United States Army. Although Hill denied he felt ill will afterward, during the war, a rumor spread that Hill always fought harder if he knew McClellan was present with the opposing army because of Ellen&#x27;s earlier rejection.

On July 18, 1859, Hill married Kitty (&quot;Dolly&quot;) Morgan McClung, a young widow. He became the brother-in-law of future Confederate cavalry generals John Hunt Morgan (Hill&#x27;s best man at the wedding) and Basil W. Duke.

===American Civil War===

====Early months====
On March 1, 1861, after some slave states had declared secession from the United States, and as the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 met, Hill resigned his United States Army commission. After Virginia declared secession, Hill accepted a commission as colonel of the 13th Virginia Infantry Regiment, which included units from his native Culpeper County, and nearby Orange, Louisa and Frederick Counties, as well as the Lanier Guards of Maryland and the Frontier Rifles of Hampshire County in what would soon become West Virginia. The 13th Virginia was one of the regiments in Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s army that was transported by the railroad as reinforcements to the First Battle of Bull Run, but Hill and his men were sent to guard the Confederate right flank near Manassas and saw no action during the battle. Hill was promoted to brigadier general on February 26, 1862, and commanded a brigade in the (Confederate) Army of the Potomac.

====Light Division====
In the Peninsula Campaign of 1862, Hill performed well as a brigade commander at the Battle of Williamsburg, where his brigade blunted a U.S. attack, and was promoted to major general and division command on May 26. Hill&#x27;s new division was composed mainly of brigades pulled from the Carolinas and Georgia.
His division did not participate in the Battle of Seven Pines (May 31 June 1), the battle in which Joseph E. Johnston was wounded and replaced in command of the Army of Northern Virginia by Robert E. Lee. June 1 was the first day Hill began using a nickname for his division: the &quot;Light Division&quot;. This contradictory name for the largest division in all Confederate armies may have been selected because Hill wished his men a reputation for speed and agility. One of Hill&#x27;s soldiers wrote after the war, &quot;The name was applicable, for we often marched without coats, blankets, knapsacks, or any other burdens except our arms and haversacks, which were never heavy and sometimes empty.&quot;

Hill&#x27;s rookie division was in the thick of the fighting during the Seven Days Battles, being heavily engaged at Mechanicsville, Gaines Mill, and Glendale. Following the campaign, Hill became involved in a dispute with James Longstreet over a series of newspaper articles that appeared in the &quot;Richmond Examiner&quot;; relations between them deteriorated to the point that Hill was placed under arrest and Hill challenged Longstreet to a duel. Following the Seven Days Battles, Lee reorganized the army into two corps and assigned Hill&#x27;s division to Stonewall Jackson. Their relationship was less than amicable, and the two quarreled many times. Hill frequently found himself under arrest by Jackson.

At the Battle of Cedar Mountain on August 9, Hill launched a counterattack that stabilized the Confederate left flank, preventing it from being routed. Three weeks later, at the Second Battle of Bull Run (Second Manassas), Hill was placed on the Confederate left along the unfinished railroad cut and held it against repeated U.S. attacks. During the campaign, Hill became involved in several minor disputes with Jackson concerning Jackson&#x27;s marching orders to Hill.

Hill&#x27;s performance at the Battle of Antietam was particularly noteworthy. While Lee&#x27;s army was enduring strong attacks by the U.S. Army of the Potomac outside Sharpsburg, Maryland, Hill&#x27;s Light Division had been left behind to process U.S. prisoners of war at Harpers Ferry. Responding to an urgent call for assistance from Lee, Hill marched his men at a grueling pace and reached the battlefield just in time to counterattack a strong forward movement by the corps of Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside, which threatened to destroy Lee&#x27;s right flank. Hill&#x27;s arrival neutralized the threat, ending the battle with Lee&#x27;s army battered but undefeated. Hours after the battle, Hill told an inquisitive major that Burnside owed him $8,000. During the retreat back to Virginia, he had his division push back a few regiments from the U.S. V Corps.

At the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, Hill was positioned near the Confederate right along a ridge; because of some swampy ground along his front, there was a 600-yard gap in Hill&#x27;s front line, and the nearest brigade behind it was nearly a quarter mile away; the dense vegetation prevented the brigade commander from seeing any Union soldiers advancing on his position. During the battle, Maj. Gen. George Meade&#x27;s division routed two of Hill&#x27;s brigades and part of a third. Hill required assistance from Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early&#x27;s division to repulse the U.S. attack. Hill&#x27;s division suffered over 2,000 casualties during the battle, which was nearly two-thirds of the casualties in Jackson&#x27;s corps; two of his brigade commanders were wounded, one (Maxcy Gregg) mortally. After the battle, one of his brigade commanders, Brig. Gen. James J. Archer, criticized him for the gap left in the division&#x27;s front line, saying that Hill had been warned about it before the battle but had done nothing to correct it. Hill was also absent from his division, and there is no record of where he was during the battle; this led to a rumor spread through the lines that he had been captured during the initial U.S. assault.

Hill and Jackson argued several times during the Northern Virginia Campaign and 1862 Maryland Campaign. During the invasion of Maryland, Jackson had Hill arrested and charged him with eight counts of dereliction of duty after the campaign. During the lull in campaigning following the Battle of Fredericksburg, Hill repeatedly requested that Lee set up a court of inquiry. Still, the commanding general did not wish to lose his two experienced lieutenants&#x27; effective teamwork, so he refused to approve Hill&#x27;s request. Their feud was put aside whenever a battle was being fought and then resumed afterward, a practice that lasted until the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863. There, Jackson was accidentally wounded by the 18th North Carolina Infantry of Hill&#x27;s division. Hill briefly took command of the Second Corps and was wounded himself in the calves of his legs. While in the infirmary, he requested that the cavalry commander, J. E. B. Stuart, take his place in command.

====Third Corps commander====
After Jackson&#x27;s death from pneumonia related to wounds received, Hill was promoted on May 24, 1863, to lieutenant general (becoming the Army of Northern Virginia&#x27;s fourth highest-ranking general) and placed in command of the newly created Third Corps of Lee&#x27;s army, which he led in the Gettysburg Campaign of 1863. One of Hill&#x27;s divisions, led by his West Point classmate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth, was the first to engage Union soldiers at the Battle of Gettysburg. Although the first day of the battle was a resounding Confederate success, Hill received much postbellum criticism from proponents of the Lost Cause movement, suggesting that he had unwisely brought on a general engagement against orders before Lee&#x27;s army was fully concentrated. His division under Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson fought in the unsuccessful second day assaults against Cemetery Ridge, while his favorite division commander, Maj. Gen. William Dorsey Pender, commanding the Light Division, was severely wounded, which prevented that division from cooperating with the assault. On the third day, two-thirds of the men in Pickett&#x27;s Charge were from Hill&#x27;s corps, but Robert E. Lee chose James Longstreet to be the overall commander of the assault. Of all three infantry corps of the Army of Northern Virginia, Hill&#x27;s suffered the most casualties at Gettysburg, which prompted Lee to order them to lead the retreat from Gettysburg.

During the Bristoe Campaign of the same year, Hill launched his Corps &quot;too hastily&quot; in the Battle of Bristoe Station and was bloodily repulsed by Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren&#x27;s II Corps. Lee did not criticize him for this afterward but ordered him to detail himself to the dead and wounded after hearing his account. Hill&#x27;s corps also participated in the Battle of Mine Run. Other than a brief visit to Richmond in January 1864, Hill remained with his corps in its winter encampments near Orange Court House.

In the Overland Campaign of 1864, Hill&#x27;s corps held back multiple U.S. attacks during the first day of the Battle of the Wilderness but became severely disorganized as a result. Despite several requests from his division commanders, Hill refused to straighten and strengthen his line during the night, possibly due to Lee&#x27;s plan to relieve them at daylight. At dawn on the second day of the battle, the Union Army launched an attack that briefly drove Hill&#x27;s corps back, with several units routed, but the First Corps under Longstreet arrived just in time to reinforce him. Hill was medically incapacitated with an unspecified illness at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, so Maj. Gen. Jubal Early temporarily took command of the Third Corps. Still, Hill could hear that his men were doing well and observed the battle at Lee&#x27;s side. After recovering and regaining his corps, he was later rebuked by Lee for his piecemeal attacks at the Battle of North Anna. By then, Lee was too ill to coordinate his subordinates in springing a planned trap against Union forces. Hill held the Confederate left flank at Cold Harbor, but two divisions of his corps were used to defend against the main U.S. attack on the right flank on June 3; when part of the troops to his right gave way, Hill used one brigade to launch a successful counterattack.

During the Siege of Petersburg of 1864–65, Hill and his men participated in several battles during the various U.S. offensives, particularly Jerusalem Plank Road, the Crater, Globe Tavern, Second Reams Station, and Peebles Farm. During the Battle of the Crater, he fought against his West Point classmate Ambrose Burnside, whom the former repulsed at Antietam and Fredericksburg. Hill was ill several times that winter; in March 1865, his health had deteriorated to the point where he had to recuperate in Richmond until April 1, 1865.

===Death===
Hill had said he had no desire to live to see the collapse of the Confederacy. On April 2, 1865 (during the U.S. breakthrough in the Third Battle of Petersburg, just seven days before Lee&#x27;s surrender at the Battle of Appomattox Court House), he was shot dead by a Union soldier, Corporal John W. Mauk of the 138th Pennsylvania Infantry, as he rode to the front of the Petersburg lines, accompanied by one staff officer. Hill had attempted to induce the Union soldiers to surrender. Instead, the Union soldiers refused and shot Hill through the chest. The rifle bullet traveled through his heart, exited his chest, and sliced off his left thumb. Hill fell to the ground and died within moments.

 In the late nineteenth century, interest developed in trying to locate and memorialize the site where Hill was killed, with apparent attempts made to locate the site in 1888, 1890, and 1903. It was not until 1911, however, that the Sons of Confederate Veterans undertook a careful study and located where Hill fell.

In April 1912, the SCV unveiled two monuments denoting the death of A. P. Hill in Dinwiddie County. The larger of these two monuments is located at the Boydton Plank Road and Duncan Road intersection.

The monument reads:

&quot;To the memory of
A.P. Hill, Lt-Gen. C.S.A. 
He was killed about 600 yards 
northwardly from this marker,
being shot by a small band of
stragglers from the Federal lines
on the morning of April 2, 1865.

Erected by A.P. Hill Camp Sons of
Confederate Veterans-Petersburg, Va.&quot;

This location was thought to be chosen because it was easily accessible from the road. A small parking area is located behind the monument on Duncan Road, making it easy and safe to visit and access. The marker is located at GPS coordinates: 37° 11.365′ N, 77° 28.52′ W.

The SCV also marked what was thought in April 1912 to be the exact site where Hill fell. The small granite marker at the site reads:

Spot where
A.P. Hill
Was Killed

The GPS coordinates for this marker are: 37° 11.553′ N, 77° 28.847′ W. It is approximately a half mile from the larger stone. The marker is located near Sentry Hill Court and is on land that the American Battlefield Trust preserved. It is publicly accessible via a short trail.

Hill&#x27;s widow and his surviving children attended the unveiling ceremony for the two markers.

 Across the Boydton Plank Road (US 1) from the &quot;Memory&quot; marker is a third marker to A. P. Hill. The Conservation &amp; Development Commission erected this marker in 1929. It reads:

In the field a short distance
north of this road, the Confederate
General A.P. Hill was
killed, April 2, 1865. Hill, not
knowing that Lee&#x27;s lines had
been broken, rode into a party
of Union soldiers advancing
on Petersburg.

The marker was replaced as recently as 2015. It is Virginia Historical Marker S-49. It is located just south of the turn-off for the marker in the Sentry Hill area. There is no designated pull-off area for this marker. It is located at GPS coordinates: 37° 11.348′ N, 77° 28.601′ W.

Confederates recovered Hill&#x27;s corpse shortly afterward. When Lee heard of Hill&#x27;s death, he tearfully uttered, &quot;He is now at rest, and we who are left are the ones to suffer.&quot; Hill&#x27;s family had hoped to bury Hill in Richmond, but the city&#x27;s evacuation by the Confederate government during the next days and capture by U.S. forces led to Hill&#x27;s burial, either in Chesterfield County at Bellgrade Plantation or, as suggested by Virginia&#x27;s Pickett Society, just south of the James River near Bosher Dam. Per his will, Hill was interred standing up.

==Analysis==
Hill did not escape controversy during the war. He had a frail physique and suffered from frequent illnesses that reduced his effectiveness at Gettysburg, the Wilderness, and Spotsylvania Court House. (Some historians believe these illnesses were related to the venereal disease he contracted as a West Point cadet.)

Some analysts consider Hill an example of the Peter principle. Although he was extremely successful commanding his famed &quot;Light Division,&quot; he was less effective as a corps commander. Historian Larry Tagg described Hill as &quot;always emotional ... so high strung before battle that he had an increasing tendency to become unwell when the fighting was about to commence.&quot; This tendency was, to some extent, balanced by the implied combative attitude that he displayed. He often donned a red calico hunting shirt when a battle was about to start, and the men under his command would pass the word, &quot;Little Powell&#x27;s got on his battle shirt!&quot; and begin to check their weapons.
Hill was affectionate with the rank-and-file soldiers, and one officer called him &quot;the most lovable of all Lee&#x27;s generals.&quot; Although it was said that &quot;his manner [was] so courteous as almost to lack decision,&quot; his actions were often impetuous and did not lack decision, but judgment.

Nevertheless, Hill was one of the war&#x27;s most highly regarded generals on either side.

==Legacy==

In 1897, the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) in Petersburg held its first meeting and decided to name its camp after A. P. Hill because he defended the city, his Third Corps included Petersburg&#x27;s own 12th Virginia Infantry regiment, and because Gen. Hill died in nearby Dinwiddie County during the Third Battle of Petersburg a few days before General Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia. They also erected a marker where Hill fell mortally wounded. Prominent commanders of the camp (lodge) included Congressman Patrick Henry Drewry and Petersburg&#x27;s multi-term state senator Samuel D. Rodgers. The camp may have lapsed after 1938 but was revived on June 9, 1959, with David Lyon as its Commander. Petersburg also named a school after Hill and others for Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and J.E.B. Stuart.

Hill&#x27;s sword is on display at the Chesterfield County Museum in Chesterfield, Virginia.

Hill&#x27;s remains were reinterred twice in Richmond. In February 1867, Hill&#x27;s remains were reinterred in Richmond&#x27;s Hollywood Cemetery. During the late 1880s, several former comrades raised funds for a monument to Hill in Richmond. Hill&#x27;s remains were again transferred, to the base of a monument dedicated on May 30, 1892, on land donated by developer Lewis Ginter. General Henry Heth led the procession to the dedication, and General James A. Walker gave an oration. A bronze statue of Hill, created by Caspar Buberl after William Ludwell Sheppard&#x27;s design, topped the monument, while its plaster cast was given to the A.P. Hill Camp of Petersburg. The monument was located in the center of the intersection of Laburnum Avenue and Hermitage Road in what is now the city&#x27;s Hermitage Road Historic District. This monument was the only one of its type in Richmond under which the subject individual was interred. On June 26, 2020, the Hermitage Road Historic District Association released a public statement requesting that the City of Richmond remove and relocate the monument to a more appropriate location. This request occurred within the context of the contemporary Black Lives Matter movement, and further impetus for the removal of Confederate monuments had been provided by protests in Richmond and elsewhere that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020.

In January 2022, the administration of Richmond mayor Levar Stoney announced that the Richmond statue and remains of Hill would be removed very shortly. The City of Richmond had gained authority to remove monuments to war veterans on public city grounds from legislation signed into law by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam on April 11, 2020. Because Hill was the only Confederate general who was buried under his monument in Richmond, government officials delayed any tampering with the monument until they could find a final resting place for Hill&#x27;s remains. Following the filing of a lawsuit by members of A. P. Hill&#x27;s extended family of descendants, who claimed that they, and not the City of Richmond, had the right to determine the disposition of the statue, a Virginia circuit court ruled in favor of the city&#x27;s plan to transfer the statue to the Black History Museum and Cultural Center of Virginia. The statue was removed on December 12, 2022 after the denial of a motion by the extended family members to stay its removal. It was the last statue of a Confederate officer standing in Richmond. The remains of A. P. Hill, which were exhumed one day later on December 13, were expected to be reinterred in a cemetery in Culpeper, Virginia. Hill was buried in Fairview Cemetery in Culpeper, Virginia on January 21, 2023. The statue will remain in storage until an appeal by A. P. Hill&#x27;s descendants is resolved, who want the statue to be relocated to Cedar Mountain Battlefield for it to continue to serve as Hill&#x27;s grave marker.

The United States military named both a fort and a ship after Hill. Fort Walker, formerly Fort A.P. Hill (1941–2023), is located in Caroline County, Virginia, about halfway between Richmond and Washington, D.C. During World War II, the United States Navy named a Liberty Ship the SS &quot;A. P. Hill&quot;. In 2020, there were calls to rename U.S. Army installations named after Confederate soldiers, including Fort A.P. Hill. In September 2022, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III accepted The Naming Commission&#x27;s recommendation to rename Fort A.P. Hill in honor of the first female U.S. Army surgeon, Civil War prisoner of war, and Medal of Honor recipient Mary Edwards Walker. Fort Walker received its new name in a ceremony on August 25, 2023.

==In popular culture==
* Hill is depicted in both of Ronald F. Maxwell&#x27;s Civil War films, &quot;Gettysburg&quot; (1993) and &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; (2003). In the former, he was portrayed by historian and Civil War reenactor Patrick Falci; in the latter, by character actor William Sanderson.

<text>Gershom Carmichael (1672–1729) was a Scottish philosopher.

Gershom Carmichael was a Scottish subject born in London, the son of Alexander Charmichael, a Church of Scotland minister who had been banished by the Scottish privy council for his religious opinions. As a child, he suffered from crooked limbs (probably rickets) and was treated by &quot;body menders&quot; who made him wear limb braces. Through his friendship with the Duke of Hamilton, Carmichael visited Bath to take the waters and he was eventually able to dispense with the braces.

Carmichael graduated at Edinburgh University in 1691, and became a regent at St Andrews. In 1694 he was elected a master in the university of Glasgow – an office that was converted into the professorship of moral philosophy in 1727, when the system of masters was abolished at Glasgow. He died in Glasgow.

Sir William Hamilton regarded him as &quot;the real founder of the Scottish school of philosophy&quot;. He wrote &quot;Breviuscula Introductio ad Logicam&quot;, a treatise on logic and the psychology of the intellectual powers, combining Arnauld and Nicole with Locke; &quot;Synopsis Theologiae Naturalis&quot;; and an edition of Pufendorf, &quot;De Officio Hominis et Civis&quot;, with notes and supplements of high value. His son Frederick was the author of &quot;Sermons on Several Important Subjects&quot; and &quot;Sermons on Christian Zeal&quot;, both published in 1753.

<doc id="204989" wikidata="Q311861" url="?curid=204989" title="Charles III of Naples">
<text>Charles of Durazzo, also called Charles the Small (1345 – 24 February 1386), was King of Naples and the titular King of Jerusalem from 1382 to 1386 as Charles III, and King of Hungary from 1385 to 1386 as Charles II. In 1381, Charles created the chivalric Order of the Ship. In 1383, he succeeded to the Principality of Achaea on the death of James of Baux.

== Life ==

=== Childhood and youth (1354/1357 – 1370) ===

He was the only child of Louis of Durazzo and his wife, Margaret of Sanseverino. Louis of Durazzo was a younger son of John, Duke of Durazzo, the youngest son of King Charles II of Naples and Mary of Hungary. Charles&#x27;s date of birth is uncertain: he was born in 1354, according to historian Szilárd Süttő, and in 1357, according to Nancy Goldstone. Charles was born in Durazzo.

Louis of Durazzo rebelled against his cousins, Joanna I of Naples, and her husband, Louis of Taranto in the spring of 1360, but he was defeated. He was also compelled to send the child Charles as a hostage to Queen Joanna I&#x27;s court in Naples. After Charles&#x27;s father died in prison in the summer of 1362, Queen Joanna ordered that Charles was to be treated &quot;with all honours due to the royal household and to maintain him in a royal state&quot;.

Charles&#x27;s distant cousin, Louis I of Hungary, who had not fathered a son, decided to invite Charles to Hungary. Charles came to Hungary in 1364 or 1365. King Louis initially planned to arrange a marriage between Charles and Anne, who was a daughter of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor. However, the negotiations of their marriage were broken off because the relations between Louis I and Charles IV had deteriorated. Next, Louis proposed a marriage between Charles and Charles&#x27;s cousin, Margaret of Durazzo, who was the youngest daughter of Queen Joanna&#x27;s younger sister, Maria of Calabria. Although the queen was opposed to the marriage, Pope Urban VI granted the papal dispensation that was necessary for the marriage on 15 June 1369. Their marriage took place in Naples on 24 January 1370.

Louis made Charles governor of Slavonia, Croatia and Dalmatia with the title of duke in 1371.

=== War for Naples (1379–1381) ===
Queen Joanna I of Naples officially acknowledged Clement VII as the lawful pope against Urban VI on 22 November 1378. She even gave shelter to Clement VII, who had been expelled from Rome, and helped him to leave Italy for Avignon in May 1379. In retaliation, Pope Urban VI excommunicated the queen and declared her deprived of her kingdom in favor of Charles of Durazzo and his wife Margaret on 17 June.

The conflict between Joanna and Pope Urban VI caused the Pope (as feudal overlord of the kingdom) to declare her dethroned in 1381 and give the kingdom to Charles. He marched on the Kingdom of Naples with a Croatian army, defeated her husband Otto, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen, at San Germano, seized the city and besieged Joanna in the Castel dell&#x27;Ovo. After Otto&#x27;s failed attempt to relieve her, Charles captured her and had her imprisoned at San Fele. Soon afterwards, when news reached Charles that her adopted heir, Louis I of Anjou, was setting out on an expedition to reconquer Naples, Charles had the Queen strangled in prison in 1382. Then he succeeded to the crown.

=== King of Naples (1382–1385) ===
Louis&#x27;s expedition counted to some 40,000 troops, including those of Amadeus VI of Savoy, and had the financial support of Antipope Clement VII and Bernabò Visconti of Milan. Charles, who counted on the mercenary companies under John Hawkwood and Bartolomeo d&#x27;Alviano, for a total of some 14,000 men, was able to divert the French from Naples to other regions of the kingdom and to harass them with guerrilla tactics. Amadeus fell ill and died in Molise on 1 March 1383, and his troops abandoned the field. Louis asked for help to his king in France, who sent him an army under Enguerrand VII, Lord of Coucy. The latter was able to conquer Arezzo and then invade the Kingdom of Naples, but midway was reached by the news that Louis had suddenly died at Bisceglie on 20 September 1384.

In the meantime, relationships with Urban VI became strained, as he suspected that Charles was plotting against him. In January 1385 he had six cardinals arrested, and one, under torture, revealed Charles&#x27;s part in a conspiracy. He then excommunicated Charles and his wife, and imposed an interdict over the Kingdom of Naples. The King replied by sending Alberico da Barbiano to besiege the pope in Nocera. After six months of siege, Urban was freed by two Neapolitan barons who had sided with Louis of Anjou, Raimondello Orsini and Tommaso di Sanseverino.

===Succession in Hungary===
While Urban took refuge in Genoa, Charles left the Kingdom to move to Hungary. Upon the death of King Louis I, he claimed the Hungarian throne as the senior Angevin male and ousted Louis&#x27;s daughter Mary of Hungary in December 1385. It was not difficult for him to take power, as he gained the support of several Croatian lords and many contacts he made during his tenure as Duke of Croatia and Dalmatia. However, Elizabeth of Bosnia, widow of Louis and mother of Mary, arranged to have Charles assassinated on 7 February 1386. He died of his wounds at Visegrád on 24 February.

He was buried in Visegrád without religious ceremony, because of his still valid excommunication by Pope Urban VI. His son Ladislaus (named in honor of the King-Knight Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary) succeeded him in Naples, while the regents of Mary of Hungary reinstated her as Queen of Hungary. However, Ladislaus would try to obtain the crown of Hungary in the future.

==Children==
Charles III and Margaret of Durazzo had three children:
*Mary of Durazzo (1369–1371).
*Joanna II of Naples (23 June 1373 – 2 February 1435).
*Ladislaus of Naples (11 February 1377 – 6 August 1414).

<text>James Spedding (28 June 1808 – 9 March 1881) was an English author, chiefly known as the editor of the works of Francis Bacon.

==Life==

He was born in Cumberland, the younger son of a country squire, and was educated at Bury St Edmunds and Trinity College, Cambridge; where he took a second class degree in the classical tripos, was a Cambridge Apostle, and was junior &quot;optime&quot; in mathematics in 1831. In 1835 he entered the Colonial Office, but he resigned this post in 1841. In 1842 he was secretary to Lord Ashburton on his American mission, and in 1855 he became secretary to the Civil Service Commission; but from 1841 onwards he was constantly occupied in his researches into Bacon&#x27;s life and philosophy. On 1 March 1881 he was knocked down by a cab in London, and on the 9th he died of erysipelas.

Spedding&#x27;s major edition of Bacon&#x27;s works was begun in 1847 in collaboration with Robert Leslie Ellis and Douglas Denon Heath. In 1853 Ellis had to leave the work to Spedding, with the occasional assistance of Heath, who edited most of the legal writings. The &quot;Works&quot; were published in 1857–1859 in seven volumes, followed by the &quot;Life and Letters&quot; (1861–1874). Taken together these works contain practically all the material which exists in connection with the subject, collected and weighed with care and impartiality.

In 1853, Delia Bacon approached Spedding with her belief that Francis Bacon was instrumental in the authorship of Shakespeare&#x27;s works (see Shakespearean authorship). Spedding&#x27;s initial reaction was &quot;speechless astonishment&quot;; but on later occasions he clearly expressed his disfavour of the Baconian hypothesis, and explained some of the common-sense reasons against it. Spedding was the first person to recognise the hand of John Fletcher in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry VIII&quot;—his &quot;Who Wrote &quot;Henry VIII?&quot;&quot; appeared in 1850; he was also one of the first people to perceive Shakespeare&#x27;s hand in the additions to &quot;Sir Thomas More.&quot;

Spedding humorously emphasised his devotion to Bacon in the title of one of his non-Baconian works, &quot;Reviews and Discussions, Literary, Political and Historical, not relating to Bacon&quot; (1879).

<text>Wisteria is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae (Leguminosae). The genus includes four species of woody twining vines that are native to China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, southern Canada, the Eastern United States, and north of Iran. They were later introduced to France, Germany and various other countries in Europe. Some species are popular ornamental plants. The genus name is also used as the English name, and may then be spelt &#x27;wistaria&#x27;. In some countries in Western and Central Europe, &quot;Wisteria&quot; is also known by a variant spelling of the genus in which species were formerly placed, &quot;Glycine&quot;. Examples include the French &quot;glycines&quot;, the German &quot;Glyzinie&quot;, and the Polish &quot;glicynia&quot;.

The aquatic flowering plant commonly called wisteria or &#x27;water wisteria&#x27; is &quot;Hygrophila difformis&quot;, in the family Acanthaceae.

Wisterias climb by twining their stems around any available support. &quot;W. floribunda&quot; (Japanese wisteria) twines clockwise when viewed from above, while &quot;W. sinensis&quot; (Chinese wisteria) twines counterclockwise. This is an aid in identifying the two most common species of wisteria. They can climb as high as above the ground and spread out laterally. The world&#x27;s largest known wisteria is the Sierra Madre Wisteria in Sierra Madre, California, measuring more than in size and weighing 250 tons. Planted in 1894, it is of the &#x27;Chinese lavender&#x27; variety.

The leaves are alternate, 15 to 35 cm long, pinnate, with 9 to 19 leaflets.

The flowers have drooping racemes that vary in length from species to species. &quot;W. frutescens&quot; (American wisteria) has the shortest racemes, . &quot;W. floribunda&quot; (Japanese wisteria) has the longest racemes, in some varieties and or in some cultivars. The flowers come in a variety of colors, including white, lilac, purple, and pink, and some &quot;W. brachybotrys&quot; (Silky wisteria) and &quot;W. floribunda&quot; cultivars have particularly remarkable colors. The flowers are fragrant, and especially cultivars of &quot;W. brachybotrys&quot;, &quot;W. floribunda&quot;, and &quot;W. sinensis&quot; are noted for their sweet and musky scents. Flowering is in spring (just before or as the leaves open) in some Asian species, and in mid to late summer in the American species.

==Taxonomy==

The genus &quot;Wisteria&quot; was established by Thomas Nuttall in 1818. He based the genus on &quot;Wisteria frutescens&quot;, previously included in the genus &quot;Glycine&quot;. Nuttall stated that he named the genus in memory of the American physician and anatomist Caspar Wistar (1761–1818). Both men were living in Philadelphia at the time, where Wistar was a professor in the School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Questioned about the spelling later, Nuttall said it was for &quot;euphony&quot;, but his biographer speculated that it may have something to do with Nuttall&#x27;s friend Charles Jones Wister Sr., of Grumblethorpe, the grandson of the merchant John Wister. Various sources assert that the naming occurred in Philadelphia. It has been suggested that the Portuguese botanist and geologist José Francisco Corrêa da Serra, who lived in Philadelphia beginning in 1812, four years before his appointment as ambassador of Portugal to the United States, and a friend of Wistar, proposed the name &quot;Wistaria&quot; in his obituary of Wistar.

As the spelling is apparently deliberate, there is no justification for changing the genus name under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants.

===Classification===
The genus was previously placed in the tribe Millettieae. Molecular phylogenetic studies from 2000 onwards showed that &quot;Wisteria&quot;, along with other genera such as &quot;Callerya&quot; and &quot;Afgekia&quot;, were related and quite distinct from other members of the Millettieae. A more detailed study in 2019 reached the same conclusion, and moved &quot;Wisteria&quot; to the expanded tribe Wisterieae.

===Species===

, Plants of the World Online accepted four species:

==Ecology==

&quot;Wisteria&quot; species are used as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the brown-tail moth.

==Toxicity==
The seeds are produced in pods similar to those of &quot;Laburnum&quot;, and, like the seeds of that genus, are poisonous. All parts of the plant contain a saponin called wisterin, which is toxic if ingested, and may cause dizziness, confusion, speech problems, nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, diarrhea and collapse. There is debate over whether the concentration outside of the seeds is sufficient to cause poisoning. Wisteria seeds have caused poisoning in children and pets of many countries, producing mild to severe gastroenteritis and other effects.

==Cultivation==

In North America, &quot;W. floribunda&quot; (Japanese wisteria) and &quot;W. sinensis&quot; (Chinese wisteria) are far more popular than other species for their abundance of flowers, clusters of large flowers, variety of flower colors, and fragrance. &quot;W. sinensis&quot; was brought to the United States for horticultural purposes in 1816, while &quot;W. floribunda&quot; was introduced around 1830. Because of their hardiness and tendency to escape cultivation, these non-native wisterias are considered invasive species in many parts of the U.S., especially the Southeast, due to their ability to overtake and choke out other native plant species.

&quot;W. floribunda&quot; (Japanese wisteria), which has the longest racemes of wisteria species, is decorative and has given rise to many cultivars that have won the prestigious Award of Garden Merit.

Wisteria, especially &quot;W. sinensis&quot; (Chinese wisteria), is very hardy and fast-growing. It can grow in fairly poor-quality soils, but prefers fertile, moist, well-drained soil. It thrives in full sun. It can be propagated via hardwood cutting, softwood cuttings, or seed. However, specimens grown from seed can take decades to bloom; for this reason, gardeners usually grow plants that have been started from rooted cuttings or grafted cultivars known to flower well.

Another reason for failure to bloom can be excessive fertilizer (particularly nitrogen). Wisteria has nitrogen fixing capability (provided by &quot;Rhizobia&quot; bacteria in root nodules), and thus mature plants may benefit from added potassium and phosphate, but not nitrogen. Finally, wisteria can be reluctant to bloom before it has reached maturity. Maturation may require only a few years, as in &quot;W. macrostachya&quot; (Kentucky wisteria), or nearly twenty, as in &quot;W. sinensis&quot;. Maturation can be forced by physically abusing the main trunk, root pruning, or drought stress.

Wisteria can grow into a mound when unsupported, but is at its best when allowed to clamber up a tree, pergola, wall, or other supporting structure. &quot;W. floribunda&quot; (Japanese wisteria) with longer racemes is the best choice to grow along a pergola. &quot;W. sinensis&quot; (Chinese wisteria) with shorter racemes is the best choice for growing along a wall. Whatever the case, the support must be very sturdy, because mature wisteria can become immensely strong with heavy wrist-thick trunks and stems. These can collapse latticework, crush thin wooden posts, and even strangle large trees. Wisteria allowed to grow on houses can cause damage to gutters, downspouts, and similar structures. Wisteria flowers develop in buds near the base of the previous year&#x27;s growth, so pruning back side shoots to the basal few buds in early spring can enhance the visibility of the flowers. If it is desired to control the size of the plant, the side shoots can be shortened to between 20 and 40 cm long in midsummer, and back to in the fall. Once the plant is a few years old, a relatively compact, free-flowering form can be achieved by pruning off the new tendrils three times during the growing season in the summer months. The flowers of some varieties are edible, and can even be used to make wine. Others are said to be toxic. Careful identification by an expert is strongly recommended before consuming this or any wild plant.

In the United Kingdom, the national collection of wisteria is held by Chris Lane at the Witch Hazel Nursery in Newington, near Sittingbourne in Kent.
==Art and symbolism==

Wisteria and their racemes have been widely used in Japan throughout the centuries and were a popular symbol in and heraldry. Wisteria is one of the five most commonly used motifs in the , and there are more than 150 types of wisteria . Because of its longevity and fertility, wisteria was considered an auspicious plant and was favored as a , and was adopted and popularized by the Fujiwara clan as their .

One popular dance in kabuki known as the &quot;Fuji Musume&quot; (or &#x27;The Wisteria Maiden&#x27;), is the sole extant dance of a series of five personifying dances in which a maiden becomes the embodiment of the spirit of wisteria. In the West, both in building materials such as tile, as well as stained glass, wisterias have been used both in realism and stylistically in artistic works and industrial design.

<doc id="204995" wikidata="Q203906" url="?curid=204995" title="Frederick Winslow Taylor">
<text>Frederick Winslow Taylor (March 20, 1856 – March 21, 1915) was an American mechanical engineer. He was widely known for his methods to improve industrial efficiency. He was one of the first management consultants. In 1909, Taylor summed up his efficiency techniques in his book &quot;The Principles of Scientific Management&quot; which, in 2001, Fellows of the Academy of Management voted the most influential management book of the twentieth century. His pioneering work in applying engineering principles to the work done on the factory floor was instrumental in the creation and development of the branch of engineering that is now known as industrial engineering. Taylor made his name, and was most proud of his work, in scientific management; as a result, scientific management is sometimes referred to as &quot;Taylorism&quot;. However, he made his fortune patenting steel-process improvements.

==Biography==
Taylor was born in 1856 to a Quaker family in Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Taylor&#x27;s father, Franklin Taylor, a Princeton-educated lawyer, built his wealth on mortgages. Taylor&#x27;s mother, Emily Annette Taylor (née Winslow), was an ardent abolitionist and a coworker with Lucretia Mott. His father&#x27;s ancestor, Samuel Taylor, settled in Burlington, New Jersey, in 1677. His mother&#x27;s ancestor, Edward Winslow, was one of the fifteen original Mayflower Pilgrims who brought servants or children, and one of eight who had the honorable distinction of Mister. Winslow served for many years as the Governor of the Plymouth colony.

The Taylor family had inherited wealth and property, and the family&#x27;s assets were maintained by Franklin&#x27;s older brother, Caleb Newbold Taylor.

Educated early by his mother, Taylor studied for two years in France and Germany and traveled Europe for 18 months. In 1872, he entered Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, with the plan of eventually going to Harvard and becoming a lawyer like his father. In 1874, Taylor passed the Harvard entrance examinations with honors. However, due allegedly to rapidly deteriorating eyesight caused by night study, Taylor chose quite a different path.

Instead of attending Harvard University, Taylor became an apprentice patternmaker and machinist, gaining shop-floor experience at Enterprise Hydraulic Works in Philadelphia (a pump-manufacturing company whose proprietors were friends of the Taylor family). During this time, his eyesight recovered. He left his apprenticeship for six months and represented a group of New England machine-tool manufacturers at Philadelphia&#x27;s centennial exposition. Taylor finished his four-year apprenticeship and in 1878 became a machine-shop laborer at Midvale Steel Works. At Midvale, he was quickly promoted to time clerk, journeyman machinist, machine shop foreman, research director, and finally chief engineer of the works (while maintaining his position as machine shop foreman). Taylor&#x27;s fast promotions reflected both his talent and his family&#x27;s relationship with Edward Clark, part owner of Midvale Steel. (Edward Clark&#x27;s son Clarence Clark, who was also a manager at Midvale Steel, married Taylor&#x27;s sister.)
Early on at Midvale, working as a laborer and machinist, Taylor recognized that workmen were working their machines, or themselves, not nearly as hard as they could (a practice that at the time was called &quot;&quot;) and that this resulted in high labor costs for the company. When he became a foreman he expected more output from the workmen. In order to determine how much work should properly be expected, he began to study and analyze the productivity of both the men and the machines (although the word &quot;productivity&quot; was not used at the time, and the applied science of productivity had not yet been developed). His focus on the human component of production Taylor labeled scientific management.

While Taylor worked at Midvale, he and Clarence Clark won the first tennis doubles tournament in the 1881 US National Championships, the precursor of the US Open. Taylor became a student of Stevens Institute of Technology, studying via correspondence and obtaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering in 1883. On May 3, 1884, he married Louise M. Spooner of Philadelphia.

From 1890 until 1893 Taylor worked as a general manager and a consulting engineer to management for the Manufacturing Investment Company of Philadelphia, a company that operated large paper mills in Maine and Wisconsin. He was a plant manager in Maine. In 1893, Taylor opened an independent consulting practice in Philadelphia. His business card read &quot;Consulting Engineer - Systematizing Shop Management and Manufacturing Costs a Specialty&quot;. Through these consulting experiences, Taylor perfected his management system. His first paper, &quot;A Piece Rate System&quot;, was presented to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in June 1895.

In 1898 he joined Bethlehem Steel to solve an expensive machine-shop capacity problem. While at Bethlehem, he discovered the best known and most profitable of his many patents: between 1898 and 1900 Taylor and Maunsel White (&quot;né&quot; Maunsel White III; 1856–1912; grandson of Maunsel White; 1783–1863) conducted comprehensive empirical tests, and concluded that tungsten alloyed steel doubled or quadrupled cutting speeds. The inventors received for the English patents alone, although the U.S. patent was eventually nullified.

Taylor was forced to leave Bethlehem Steel in 1901 after discord with other managers. Now a wealthy man, Taylor focused the remainder of his career promoting his management and machining methods through lecturing, writing, and consulting. From 1904 - 1914, Taylor lived in Philadelphia with his wife and three adopted children. In 1910, owing to the Eastern Rate Case, Frederick Winslow Taylor and his Scientific Management methodologies became famous worldwide. In 1911, Taylor introduced his The Principles of Scientific Management paper to the ASME, eight years after his Shop Management paper.

On October 19, 1906, Taylor was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Science by the University of Pennsylvania. In the same year, he was elected president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Taylor was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1912. That same year, he gave testimony to a special committee of the US House of Representatives regarding his own and other systems of management. Taylor eventually became a professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1915. In early spring of that year, Taylor caught pneumonia and died, one day after his fifty-ninth birthday, on March 21, 1915. He was buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

==Work==
Taylor was a mechanical engineer who sought to improve industrial efficiency. He is regarded as the father of scientific management, and was one of the first management consultants and director of a famous firm. In Peter Drucker&#x27;s description,

Taylor&#x27;s scientific management consisted of four principles:
#Replace rule-of-thumb work methods with methods based on a scientific study of the tasks.
#Scientifically select, train, and develop each employee rather than passively leaving them to train themselves.
#Provide &quot;Detailed instruction and supervision of each worker in the performance of that worker&#x27;s discrete task&quot;
#Divide work nearly equally between managers and workers, so that the managers apply scientific management principles to planning the work and the workers actually perform the tasks.

Future US Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis coined the term &quot;scientific management&quot; in the course of his argument for the Eastern Rate Case before the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1910. Brandeis argued that railroads, when governed according to Taylor&#x27;s principles, did not need to raise rates to increase wages. Taylor used Brandeis&#x27;s term in the title of his monograph &quot;The Principles of Scientific Management,&quot; published in 1911. The Eastern Rate Case propelled Taylor&#x27;s ideas to the forefront of the management agenda. Taylor wrote to Brandeis, &quot;I have rarely seen a new movement started with such great momentum as you have given this one.&quot; Taylor&#x27;s approach is also often referred to as &quot;Taylor&#x27;s Principles&quot;, or, frequently disparagingly, as &quot;Taylorism&quot;.

===Managers and workers===

Taylor had very precise ideas about how to introduce his system:

Workers were to be selected appropriately for each task.
Taylor believed in transferring control from workers to management. He set out to increase the distinction between mental (planning work) and manual labor (executing work). Detailed plans, specifying the job and how it was to be done, were to be formulated by management and communicated to the workers.

The introduction of his system was often resented by workers and provoked numerous strikes. The strike at Watertown Arsenal led to the congressional investigation in 1912.
Taylor believed the laborer was worthy of his hire, and pay was linked to productivity. His workers were able to earn substantially more than those under conventional management, and this earned him enemies among the owners of factories where scientific management was not in use.

===Rhetorical techniques===
Taylor promised to reconcile labor and capital. 

Debate about Taylor&#x27;s Bethlehem study of workers, particularly the stereotypical laborer &quot;Schmidt&quot;, continues to this day. One 2009 study supports assertions Taylor made about the quite substantial increase in productivity, for even the most basic task of picking up, carrying and dropping pigs of iron.

===Management theory===
Taylor thought that by analyzing work, the &quot;one best way&quot; to do it would be found. He is most remembered for developing the stopwatch time study, which, combined with Frank Gilbreth&#x27;s motion study methods, later became the field of time and motion study. He broke a job into its component parts and measured each to the hundredth of a minute. One of his most famous studies involved shovels. He noticed that workers used the same shovel for all materials. He determined that the most effective load was 21½ pounds, and found or designed shovels that for each material would scoop up that amount. He was generally unsuccessful in getting his concepts applied, and was dismissed from Bethlehem Iron Company/Bethlehem Steel Company. Nevertheless, Taylor was able to convince workers who used shovels and whose compensation was tied to how much they produced to adopt his advice about the optimum way to shovel by breaking the movements down into their component elements and recommending better ways to perform these movements. It was largely through his disciples&#x27; efforts (most notably Henry Gantt&#x27;s) that industry came to implement his ideas. Moreover, the book he wrote after parting company with the Bethlehem company, &quot;Shop Management&quot;, sold well.

===Relations with ASME===
Taylor&#x27;s written works were designed for presentation to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). These include &quot;Notes on Belting&quot; (1894), &quot;A Piece-Rate System&quot; (1895), &quot;Shop Management&quot; (1903), &quot;Art of Cutting Metals&quot; (1906), and &quot;The Principles of Scientific Management&quot; (1911).

Taylor was president of the ASME from 1906 to 1907. While president, he tried to implement his system into the management of the ASME but met with much resistance. He was able to reorganize only the publications department and that only partially. He also forced out the ASME&#x27;s longtime secretary, Morris Llewellyn Cooke, and replaced him with Calvin W. Rice. His tenure as president was trouble-ridden and marked the beginning of a period of internal dissension within the ASME during the Progressive Age.

In 1911, Taylor collected a number of his articles into a book-length manuscript, which he submitted to the ASME for publication. The ASME formed an ad hoc committee to review the text. The committee included Taylor allies such as James Mapes Dodge and Henry R. Towne. The committee delegated the report to the editor of the &quot;American Machinist&quot;, Leon P. Alford. Alford was a critic of the Taylor system and his report was negative. The committee modified the report slightly, but accepted Alford&#x27;s recommendation not to publish Taylor&#x27;s book. Taylor angrily withdrew the book and published &quot;Principles&quot; himself in 1912, without ASME approval. 

==Taylor&#x27;s influence==

===United States===
*Carl G. Barth helped Taylor to develop speed-and-feed-calculating slide rules to a previously unknown level of usefulness. Similar aids are still used in machine shops today. Barth became an early consultant on scientific management and later taught at Harvard.
*H. L. Gantt developed the Gantt chart, a visual aid for scheduling tasks and displaying the flow of work.
*Harrington Emerson introduced scientific management to the railroad industry, and proposed the dichotomy of &quot;staff&quot; versus &quot;line&quot; employees, with the former advising the latter.
*Morris Cooke adapted scientific management to educational and municipal organizations.
*Hugo Münsterberg created industrial psychology.
*Lillian Gilbreth introduced psychology to management studies.
*Frank Gilbreth (husband of Lillian) discovered scientific management while working in the construction industry, eventually developing motion studies independently of Taylor. These logically complemented Taylor&#x27;s time studies, as time and motion are two sides of the efficiency improvement coin. The two fields eventually became time and motion study.
*Harvard University, one of the first American universities to offer a graduate degree in business management in 1908, based its first-year curriculum on Taylor&#x27;s scientific management.
*Harlow S. Person, as dean of Dartmouth&#x27;s Amos Tuck School of Administration and Finance, promoted the teaching of scientific management.
*James O. McKinsey, professor of accounting at the University of Chicago and founder of the consulting firm bearing his name, advocated budgets as a means of assuring accountability and of measuring performance.

===France===
In France, Le Chatelier translated Taylor&#x27;s work and introduced scientific management throughout government owned plants during World War I. This influenced the French theorist Henri Fayol, whose 1916 &quot;Administration Industrielle et Générale&quot; emphasized organizational structure in management. In the classic &quot;General and Industrial Management&quot;, Fayol wrote that &quot;Taylor&#x27;s approach differs from the one we have outlined in that he examines the firm from the &#x27;bottom up.&#x27; He starts with the most elemental units of activity – the workers&#x27; actions – then studies the effects of their actions on productivity, devises new methods for making them more efficient, and applies what he learns at lower levels to the hierarchy &quot; He suggests that Taylor has staff analysts and advisors working with individuals at lower levels of the organization to identify the ways to improve efficiency. According to Fayol, the approach results in a &quot;negation of the principle of unity of command.&quot; Fayol criticized Taylor&#x27;s functional management in this way: In &quot;Shop Management&quot;, Taylor said « ... the most marked outward characteristics of functional management lies in the fact that each workman, instead of coming in direct contact with the management at one point only, ... receives his daily orders and help from eight different bosses... these eight were (1) route clerks, (2) instruction card men, (3) cost and time clerks, (4) gang bosses, (5) speed bosses, (6) inspectors, (7) repair bosses, and the (8) shop disciplinarian. » Fayol said that this was an unworkable situation and that Taylor must have reconciled the differences in some way not described in Taylor&#x27;s works.

Around 1922 the journalist Paulette Bernège became interested in Taylor&#x27;s theories, which were popular in France in the post-war period.
Bernège became the faithful disciple of the Domestic Sciences Movement that Christine Frederick had launched earlier in the United States, which Bernège adapted to French homes.
Frederick had transferred the concepts of Taylorism from the factory to domestic work. These included suitable tools, rational study of movements and timing of tasks. Scientific standards for housework were derived from scientific standards for workshops, intended to streamline the work of a housewife.
The &quot;Comité national de l&#x27;organisation française&quot; (CNOF) was founded in 1925 by a group of journalists and consulting engineers who saw Taylorism as a way to expand their client base.
Founders included prominent engineers such as Henry Louis Le Châtelier and Léon Guillet. Bernège&#x27;s Institute of Housekeeping Organization participated in various congresses on the scientific organization of work that led up to the founding of the CNOF, and in 1929 led to a section in CNOF on domestic economy.

===Great Britain===
Older historical accounts used to suggest that British industry had less interest in Taylor&#x27;s teachings than in similarly sized countries. More recent research has revealed that British engineers and managers were as interested as in other countries. This disparity was largely due to a trend that historians have been analyzing: recent research has revealed that Taylor&#x27;s practices diffused to Britain more through consultancies, in particular the Bedaux consultancy, than through institutions, as in Germany and to a lesser extent France, where a mixture was most effective.

Particularly enthusiastic were the Cadbury family, Seebohm Rowntree, Oliver Sheldon and Lyndall Urwick. In addition to establishing a consultancy to implement Taylor&#x27;s system, Urwick, Orr &amp; Partners, Urwick was also a key historian of F.W. Taylor and scientific management, publishing &quot;The Making of Scientific Management&quot; trilogy in the 1940s and &quot;The Golden Book of Management&quot; in 1956.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, the American Edward Albert Filene established the International Management Institute to spread information about management techniques. Lyndall Urwick was its director until the IMI closed in 1933.

===USSR===
In the Soviet Union, Vladimir Lenin was very impressed by Taylorism, which he and other Bolshevik leaders tried to incorporate into Soviet manufacturing. When Joseph Stalin took power in the 1920s, he championed the theory of &quot;Socialism in one country&quot; which denied that the Soviet economy needed foreign help to develop, and open advocates of Western management techniques fell into disfavor. No longer celebrated by Soviet leadership, Taylorism and the mass production methods of Henry Ford remained silent influences during the industrialization of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, &quot;[...] Frederick Taylor&#x27;s methods have never really taken root in the Soviet Union.&quot; The voluntaristic approach of Stalin&#x27;s Stakhanovite movement in the 1930s, fixated on setting individual records, was intrinsically opposed to Taylor&#x27;s systematic approach and proved to be counter-productive. The stop-and-go of the production process – workers having nothing to do at the beginning of a month and &#x27;storming&#x27; during illegal extra shifts at the end of the month – which prevailed even in the 1980s had nothing to do with the successfully taylorized plants e.g., of Toyota which are characterized by &quot;continuous&quot; production processes (heijunka) which are &quot;continuously&quot; improved (kaizen).&quot;The easy availability of replacement labor, which allowed Taylor to choose only &#x27;first-class men,&#x27; was an important condition for his system&#x27;s success.&quot; The situation in the Soviet Union was very different. &quot;Because work is so unrhythmic, the rational manager will hire more workers than he would need if supplies were even in order to have enough for storming. Because of the continuing labor shortage, managers are happy to pay needed workers more than the norm, either by issuing false job orders, assigning them to higher skill grades than they deserve on merit criteria, giving them &#x27;loose&#x27; piece rates, or making what is supposed to be &#x27;incentive&#x27; pay, premia for good work, effectively part of the normal wage. As Mary McAuley has suggested under these circumstances piece rates are not an incentive wage, but a way of justifying giving workers whatever they &#x27;should&#x27; be getting, no matter what their pay is supposed to be according to the official norms.&quot;Taylor and his theories are also referenced (and put to practice) in the 1921 dystopian novel &quot;We&quot; by Yevgeny Zamyatin.

===Canada===
In the early 1920s, the Canadian textile industry was re-organized according to scientific management principles. In 1928, workers at Canada Cotton Ltd. in Hamilton, Ontario went on strike against newly introduced Taylorist work methods. Also, Henry Gantt, who was a close associate of Taylor, re-organized the Canadian Pacific Railway.

With the prevalence of US branch plants in Canada and close economic and cultural ties between the two countries, the sharing of business practices, including Taylorism, has been common.

===The Taylor Society and its legacy===
The Taylor Society was founded in 1912 by Taylor&#x27;s allies to promote his values and influence. A decade after Taylor&#x27;s death in 1915 the Taylor Society had 800 members, including many leading U.S. industrialists and managers. In 1936 the Society merged with the Society of Industrial Engineers, forming the Society for Advancement of Management, which still exists today.

===Criticism of Taylor===
Many of the critiques of Taylor come from Marxists. The earliest was by Antonio Gramsci, an Italian Communist, in his &quot;Prison Notebooks&quot; (1937). Gramsci argued that Taylorism subordinates the workers to management. He also argued that the repetitive work produced by Taylorism might actually give rise to revolutionary thoughts in workers&#x27; minds.

Harry Braverman&#x27;s work &quot;Labor and Monopoly Capital: The Degradation of Work in the Twentieth Century&quot;, published in 1974, was critical of scientific management and of Taylor in particular. This work pioneered the field of Labor Process Theory as well as contributing to the historiography of the workplace.

Management theorist Henry Mintzberg is highly critical of Taylor&#x27;s methods. Mintzberg states that an obsession with efficiency allows measurable benefits to overshadow less quantifiable social benefits completely, and social values get left behind.

Taylor&#x27;s methods have also been challenged by socialists. Their arguments relate to progressive defanging of workers in the workplace and the subsequent degradation of work as management, powered by capital, uses Taylor&#x27;s methods to render work repeatable and precise yet monotonous and skill-reducing. James W. Rinehart argued that Taylor&#x27;s methods of transferring control over production from workers to management, and the division of labor into simple tasks, intensified the alienation of workers that had begun with the factory system of production around the period 1870 to 1890.

Criticism of Taylor and the Japanese model, according to Kōnosuke Matsushita:&quot;We are going to win and the industrial west is going to lose out. There’s nothing you can do about it, because the reasons for failure are within yourselves. Your firms are built on the Taylor model. Even worse, so are your heads. With your bosses doing the thinking while workers wield the screwdrivers, you&#x27;re convinced deep down that it is the right way to run a business. For the essence of management is getting ideas out of the heads of the bosses and into the heads of labor. We are beyond your mindset. Business, we know, is now so complex and difficult, the survival of firms so hazardous in an environment increasingly unpredictable, competitive and fraught with danger, that their continued existence depends on the day-to-day mobilization of every ounce of intelligence.&quot;

==Tennis and golf accomplishments==
Taylor was an accomplished tennis and golf player. He and Clarence Clark won the inaugural United States National tennis doubles championship at Newport Casino in 1881, defeating Alexander Van Rensselaer and Arthur Newbold (&quot;né&quot; Arthur Emlen Newbold; 1859–1920) in straight sets. In the 1900 Summer Olympics, Taylor finished fourth in golf.

* &quot;Mr. Taylor has taken out about one hundred patents, his greatest invention being the discovery between 1898 and 1900, jointly with Mr. Maunsel White, of the Taylor-White process of treating tungsten steel. This invention, according to the highest authorities, has revolutionized the machine shops of the world, enabling tools to cut metal at least three times as rapidly as before. The inventors received $100,000 [] for the English patents alone. Fame again came to Mr. Taylor upon his publication, in 1906, of the results of the extended researches of himself and others in the art of cutting metals – a work of genuine scientific character, and of the highest practical importance. Mr. Taylor, however, regarded as of far greater moment than all this other work his share in the discovery of the principles of scientific management.&quot;

<doc id="204996" wikidata="Q189033" url="?curid=204996" title="Medulla oblongata">
<text>The medulla oblongata or simply medulla is a long stem-like structure which makes up the lower part of the brainstem. It is anterior and partially inferior to the cerebellum. It is a cone-shaped neuronal mass responsible for autonomic (involuntary) functions, ranging from vomiting to sneezing. The medulla contains the cardiovascular center, the respiratory center, vomiting and vasomotor centers, responsible for the autonomic functions of breathing, heart rate and blood pressure as well as the sleep–wake cycle. &quot;Medulla&quot; is from Latin, ‘pith or marrow’. And &quot;oblongata&quot; is from Latin, ‘lengthened or longish or elongated&#x27;.

During embryonic development, the medulla oblongata develops from the myelencephalon. The myelencephalon is a secondary brain vesicle which forms during the maturation of the rhombencephalon, also referred to as the hindbrain.

The bulb is an archaic term for the medulla oblongata. In modern clinical usage, the word bulbar (as in bulbar palsy) is retained for terms that relate to the medulla oblongata, particularly in reference to medical conditions. The word bulbar can refer to the nerves and tracts connected to the medulla such as the corticobulbar tract, and also by association to those muscles innervated, including those of the tongue, pharynx and larynx.

==Anatomy==
The medulla can be thought of as being in two parts:
* an upper open part or superior part where the dorsal surface of the medulla is formed by the fourth ventricle.
* a lower closed part or inferior part where the fourth ventricle has narrowed at the obex in the caudal medulla, and surrounds part of the central canal.

===External surfaces===
The anterior median fissure contains a fold of pia mater, and extends along the length of the medulla oblongata. It ends at the lower border of the pons in a small triangular area, termed the foramen cecum. On either side of this fissure are raised areas termed the medullary pyramids. The pyramids house the pyramidal tracts–the corticospinal tract, and the corticobulbar tract of the nervous system. At the caudal part of the medulla these tracts cross over in the decussation of the pyramids obscuring the fissure at this point. Some other fibers that originate from the anterior median fissure above the decussation of the pyramids and run laterally across the surface of the pons are known as the anterior external arcuate fibers.

The region between the anterolateral and posterolateral sulcus in the upper part of the medulla is marked by a pair of swellings known as olivary bodies (also called &quot;olives&quot;). They are caused by the largest nuclei of the olivary bodies, the inferior olivary nuclei.

The posterior part of the medulla between the posterior median sulcus and the posterolateral sulcus contains tracts that enter it from the posterior funiculus of the spinal cord. These are the gracile fasciculus, lying medially next to the midline, and the cuneate fasciculus, lying laterally. These fasciculi end in rounded elevations known as the gracile and the cuneate tubercles. They are caused by masses of gray matter known as the gracile nucleus and the cuneate nucleus. The soma (cell bodies) in these nuclei are the second-order neurons of the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway, and their axons, called the internal arcuate fibers or fasciculi, decussate from one side of the medulla to the other to form the medial lemniscus.

Just above the tubercles, the posterior aspect of the medulla is occupied by a triangular fossa, which forms the lower part of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The fossa is bounded on either side by the inferior cerebellar peduncle, which connects the medulla to the cerebellum.

The lower part of the medulla, immediately lateral to the cuneate fasciculus, is marked by another longitudinal elevation known as the tuberculum cinereum. It is caused by an underlying collection of gray matter known as the spinal trigeminal nucleus. The gray matter of this nucleus is covered by a layer of nerve fibers that form the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve. The base of the medulla is defined by the commissural fibers, crossing over from the ipsilateral side in the spinal cord to the contralateral side in the brain stem; below this is the spinal cord.

===Blood supply===
Blood to the medulla is supplied by a number of arteries.

* Anterior spinal artery: This supplies the whole medial part of the medulla oblongata. 
* Posterior inferior cerebellar artery: This is a major branch of the vertebral artery, and supplies the posterolateral part of the medulla, where the main sensory tracts run and synapse. It also supplies part of the cerebellum.
* Direct branches of the vertebral artery: The vertebral artery supplies an area between the anterior spinal and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries, including the solitary nucleus and other sensory nuclei and fibers.
* Posterior spinal artery: This supplies the dorsal column of the closed medulla containing fasciculus gracilis, gracile nucleus, fasciculus cuneatus, and cuneate nucleus.

===Development===
The medulla oblongata forms in fetal development from the myelencephalon. The final differentiation of the medulla is seen at week 20 gestation.

Neuroblasts from the alar plate of the neural tube at this level will produce the sensory nuclei of the medulla. The basal plate neuroblasts will give rise to the motor nuclei.
* Alar plate neuroblasts give rise to:
** The solitary nucleus, which contains the general visceral afferent fibers for taste, as well as the special visceral afferent column.
** The spinal trigeminal nerve nuclei which contains the general somatic afferent column.
** The cochlear and vestibular nuclei, which contain the special somatic afferent column.
** The inferior olivary nucleus, which relays to the cerebellum.
** The dorsal column nuclei, which contain the gracile and cuneate nuclei.
* Basal plate neuroblasts give rise to:
** The hypoglossal nucleus, which contains general somatic efferent fibers.
** The nucleus ambiguus, which form the special visceral efferent.
** The dorsal nucleus of vagus nerve and the inferior salivatory nucleus, both of which form the general visceral efferent fibers.

==Function==
The medulla oblongata connects the higher levels of the brain to the spinal cord, and is responsible for several functions of the autonomous nervous system which include:
* The control of ventilation via signals from the carotid and aortic bodies. Respiration is regulated by groups of chemoreceptors. These sensors detect changes in the acidity of the blood; if, for example, the blood becomes too acidic, the medulla oblongata sends electrical signals to intercostal and phrenical muscle tissue to increase their contraction rate and increase oxygenation of the blood. The ventral respiratory group and the dorsal respiratory group are neurons involved in this regulation. The pre-Bötzinger complex is a cluster of interneurons involved in the respiratory function of the medulla. 
* Cardiovascular center – sympathetic, parasympathetic nervous system
* Vasomotor center – baroreceptors
* Reflex centers of vomiting, coughing, sneezing and swallowing. These reflexes which include the pharyngeal reflex, the swallowing reflex (also known as the palatal reflex), and the masseter reflex can be termed &quot;bulbar&quot; reflexes.

==Clinical significance==
A blood vessel blockage (such as in a stroke) will injure the pyramidal tract, medial lemniscus, and the hypoglossal nucleus. This causes a syndrome called medial medullary syndrome.

Lateral medullary syndrome can be caused by the blockage of either the posterior inferior cerebellar artery or of the vertebral arteries.

Progressive bulbar palsy (PBP) is a disease that attacks the nerves supplying the bulbar muscles. Infantile progressive bulbar palsy is progressive bulbar palsy in children.

==Other animals==
Both lampreys and hagfish possess a fully developed medulla oblongata. Since these are both very similar to early agnathans, it has been suggested that the medulla evolved in these early fish, approximately 505 million years ago. The status of the medulla as part of the primordial reptilian brain is confirmed by its disproportionate size in modern reptiles such as the crocodile, alligator, and monitor lizard.

<doc id="204997" wikidata="Q652514" url="?curid=204997" title="Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton">
<text>Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton (27 October 1774 – 12 May 1848), was a British politician, diplomat, nobleman, and financier, and a member of the Baring family. Baring was the second son of Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet, and his wife Harriet, daughter of William Herring.

==Early life==
Alexander was born on 27 October 1774. He was the second son born to Harriet Herring (1750–1804) and Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet (1740–1810). Among his siblings was Maria (the mother of Francis Stainforth), Thomas, Henry (a Member of Parliament for Bossiney and Colchester), and George Baring (who founded the Hong Kong trading house of Dent &amp; Co.). His father, alongside his uncle, John Baring, established the London merchant house of John and Francis Baring Company, which eventually became Barings Bank.

His paternal grandparents were Elizabeth Vowler and Johann Baring, a wool merchant who emigrated to England in 1717 from Germany and established the family in England. His maternal grandfather was merchant William Herring of Croydon and among his mother&#x27;s family was her cousin, Thomas Herring, Archbishop of Canterbury.

==Career==
Alexander was brought up in his father&#x27;s business, and became a partner at Hope and Company. He was later sent to the United States for various land deals, and formed wide connections with wealthy, socially prominent American families. In 1807, Alexander became a partner in the family financial firm, along with his brothers Sir Thomas Baring, 2nd Baronet (1772–1848), and Henry Baring (1777–1848), and the name was then changed to Baring Brothers &amp; Company. When Henry Hope died in 1811, the London offices of Hope &amp; Company then merged with the bank of Baring Brothers &amp; Company,

===Political career===
Baring sat in Parliament in the lower chamber of the House of Commons for Taunton 1806–1826, later for Callington 1826–1831, and then subsequently for Thetford 1831–1832 and following for North Essex 1832–1835. In 1835, he was elevated as a Lord Temporal to the upper parliamentary chamber of the House of Lords, sitting in London for 13 years until his 1848 death. 

He regarded politics from the point of view of the businessman. He opposed the orders-in-council for &quot;the restrictions on trade with the United States&quot; in 1812, before the tragic renewed hostilities ensued between the two English-speaking nations of the War of 1812. Fifteen years later, in 1826, he also opposed the act for the suppression of small banknotes, as well as other reforms. He accepted the important post in the realm of Chancellor of the Exchequer in the government proposed of pivotal June 1815 Battle of Waterloo&#x27;s victor, famed British Army general and now first Duke of Wellington&#x27;s projected ministry of 1832 as prime minister; but afterwards, alarmed at the type of men then serving in Parliament declared: &quot;he would face a thousand devils rather than such a House of Commons.&quot; After the financial Panic of 1847 and subsequent economic recession, Baring headed an external bi-metallist monetary movement hoping to prevent the undue restriction of the British currency and coinage of the pound sterling.

Baring was Master of the Mint in prime minister Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s government and, on Peel&#x27;s retirement in 1835, was raised to the peerage as Baron Ashburton, of Ashburton, in the County of Devon, a title previously held by his uncle-in-law, John Dunning, 1st Baron Ashburton (1731–1783). 

In 1842, he was again sent to America, on a significant diplomatic mission, and the same year concluded the Webster–Ashburton Treaty, negotiated in the American federal national capital city of Washington, D.C., with United States Secretary of State Daniel Webster. A compromise was settled concerning the north-east boundary of the state of Maine with bordering provinces to the north of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Quebec in neighboring Canada of British North America, plus other matters at issue remaining between the two governments of the extradition of certain criminals, which was arranged, and each state agreed to maintain a naval squadron of at least eighty guns onboard warships on the coast of West Africa for the suppression of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and the two governments then agreed to unite in a joint naval military effort to persuade other European powers to close all slave markets within their colonial territories. 

Despite his earlier attitude, Lord Ashburton disapproved of prime minister Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s free trade policies and opposed the Bank Charter Act 1844.

Ashburton was a trustee of the British Museum and of the National Gallery, a privy councillor and DCL. He published, besides several speeches, &quot;An Enquiry into the Causes and Consequences of ... Orders in Council&quot; (1808), and &quot;The Financial and Commercial Crisis Considered&quot; (1847).

Baring was the recipient of compensation when slavery was abolished in the British Empire in 1833. He received £10,090 sterling in compensation for the emancipation of nearly 500 owned black slaves across four estates in the colonial territory of British Guiana (modern Guyana) on the northeast coast of South America and the island colony of Saint Kitts in the West Indies islands chain in the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico in the Americas / Western Hemisphere, due to holding interests in those plantations.

==Personal life==
On 23 August 1798, Ashburton married Ann Louisa Bingham (1782–1848), daughter of Ann Willing Bingham and William Bingham of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who served as a U.S. Senator and was one of the richest men in America, having made his fortune during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), through trading and ownership of privateers commerce raider warships. Her maternal grandfather was Thomas Willing (1731–1821), the president of the First Bank of the United States in Philadelphia, one of the most important American financial institutions of that time. Together, they had nine children:

* Bingham Baring, 2nd Baron Ashburton (1799–1864), who married Lady Harriet Mary Montagu, eldest daughter of George Montagu, 6th Earl of Sandwich.
* Francis Baring, 3rd Baron Ashburton (1800–1868), who married Hortense Maret (–1882), daughter of Hugues-Bernard Maret, 1st Duke of Bassano, Prime Minister of France.
* Harriet Baring (1804–1892), married Henry Thynne, 3rd Marquess of Bath.
* Frederick Baring (1806–1868), Rector of Itchen Stoke, married Frederica Ashton on 24 April 1831.
* Anne Eugenia Baring (died 1839), married Humphrey St John-Mildmay.
* Alexander Baring (1810–1832), who died on board HMS &quot;Alfred&quot; in the Mediterranean.
* Arthur Baring (1818–1838), who died unmarried.
* Louisa Emily Baring (died 1888)
* Lydia Emily Baring (died 1868)

In 1830, Ashburton bought the country estate of Rudhall Manor in Herefordshire, England. 

Lord Ashburton died at age 73 years old on 12 May 1848 at Longleat, in Wiltshire, England. His widowed wife Ann Louisa died seven months later on 5 December 1848.

===Descendants===
Through his eldest son, he was a grandfather of Mary Florence Baring (1860–1902), who married William Compton, 5th Marquess of Northampton. Through his second son, he was a grandfather of Alexander Baring, 4th Baron Ashburton (1835–1889), and Maria Anne Louisa Baring (1833–1928), who married William FitzRoy, 6th Duke of Grafton.

==Quotes==
Of this great mercantile family the French Duke of Richelieu wittily remarked; &quot;There are six main powers in Europe: Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Prussia and the Baring-Brothers!&quot; (Vicary Gibbs, from the &quot;Complete Peerage&quot; published 1910).

<text>Falcon Cycles is a British bicycle manufacturer which was based in Brigg, North Lincolnshire, owned by Tandem Group.

==History==
In the 1880s, Hotchkiss, Mayo &amp; Meek Ltd was established in Coventry as a manufacturer of bicycles. In 1897, the company name was changed to Coventry-Eagle when John Meek left the company.

From 1898, like many bicycle manufacturers they began experimenting by adding small petrol-engines to their heavier bicycle frames. By 1899 they produced their first motorcycle, manufactured along bicycle lines from carefully manufactured components. By the start of World War I, the range included Villiers and JAP engines. Sourcing engines from four manufacturers post the war into the 1920s, during the depression of the 1930s the company concentrated on producing two-strokes. Production of motorcycles continued until the start of the World War II in 1939.

===Post-WW2===
After the war, and not of a scale to continue competitive motorcycle manufacture, the company concentrated on racing bicycles.

In the 1930s, they had launched a range of sporting bikes under the &quot;Falcon&quot; brand, and it was under this marque that the company relaunched itself. Managed from the 1950s under British bicycle racer Ernie Clements, in the 1970s the company signed a global licensing agreement with Belgian-racer Eddy Merckx brand, who at the time was the leading global road cycling racer. This allowed the company to greatly expand, and export large numbers of Merckx bikes to the United States.

===Elswick Hopper===

In 1974, rival bicycle manufacturer Elswick Hopper plc began a period of expansion, purchasing Wearwell Cycles, which had been established before 1872. In 1978 the company acquired Falcon Cycles, which was operated as a subsidiary before being later merged into Elswick Hopper&#x27;s factory at Barton-upon-Humber, North Lincolnshire.

By the mid-1980s, Elswick Hopper plc was a diversified conglomerate, spanning manufacturing, engineering, and distribution. But the company was losing money at both group and subsidiary level, and was in desperate need of reorganisation. Under a new Chief Executive, the group company renamed itself Elswick plc in 1984, and renamed its bicycle division Falcon Cycles, the name of its most popular selling sports bicycle brand. Ending production of bicycles under the Elswick brand in the same year, all bicycle manufacture was moved to a new factory at Brigg. In 1987 the company later added the Holdsworth and Claud Butler brands to its top of the range portfolio.

However, by the late 1980s cheap imports from Asia were flooding the UK market, and with a severe decline in the bicycle components industry, the company was reliant on importing those as well, and only assembling at Brigg. By this point, production had dwindled to just under 120,000 bicycles per annum. In an effort to stimulate sales and hence stem losses, Falcon were involved in cycle racing in the late 1980s and early 1990s, sponsoring and supplying the PMS Falcon and later the Banana Falcon teams.

Having rebuilt Elswick plc as printing and packaging business focussed on self adhesive and garment labels, the group sold the bicycle division to Casket Ltd., a company who controlled the import-only Townsend brand. Casket Ltd with their greater buying power enabled an expansion of the Falcon brand, but ran into difficulty themselves after buying a German-based bicycle manufacturer.

==Present==
Sold to Tandem Group plc in November 1995, Falcon Cycles and Dawes Cycles are now the two sub-groups which make up Tandem&#x27;s Cycles division.

The Falcon Cycles division is responsible for producing bikes and accessories under both its own name, as well as under the brand names of: Boss, Claud Butler, CBR, British Eagle, Coventry-Eagle, Elswick, Exile, Holdsworth, Scorpion, Shogun, Stinky Bitz and import-only Townsend brands. The Falcon Cycles division now has annual sales in excess of 300,000 bicycles.

<text>William Edward Norris (18 November 18471925) was a London-born English fiction and writer. His first story, &quot;Heap of Money&quot;, appeared in 1877, and was followed by a long series of novels and stories, many of which first appeared in the &quot;Temple Bar&quot; and &quot;Cornhill&quot; magazines.

==Life==
William Edward Norris was born in London, the son of Sir William Norris, Chief Justice of Ceylon. He was educated at Eton, and called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1874, though he never practised law. 

Norris died on 20 November 1925 at his Torquay home.

==Works==
Norris wrote over 60 novels; the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th (ed)&quot;, published in 1911, listed the following as his best to that date: &quot;Mademoiselle de Mersac&quot; (1880), &quot;Matrimony&quot; (1881), &quot;No New Thing&quot; (1883), &quot;My Friend Jim&quot; (1886), &quot;The Rogue&quot; (1888), &quot;The Despotic Lady&quot; (1895), &quot;Mathew Austin&quot; (1895), &quot;The Widower&quot; (1898), &quot;Nature&#x27;s Comedian&quot; (1904) and &quot;Pauline&quot; (1908).

<text>The Cannondale Bicycle Corporation is an American division of Dutch conglomerate Pon Holdings that supplies bicycles. Its headquarters are in Wilton, Connecticut, with engineering offices in Freiburg, Germany. Frames are manufactured in Taiwan. Bikes are assembled in Taiwan, as well as in the USA and in The Netherlands for the local markets.

==History==
The company was founded in 1971 by Joe Montgomery and Murdock MacGregor to manufacture precast concrete housing. Later Ron Davis came to Cannondale from CBS Laboratories where he was vice-president in charge of the development of microfilm reproduction. Davis had an idea for an internal combustion engine that would use ammonia as fuel. Davis, with MacGregor as his assistant, managed to duplicate and exceed results obtained by Allison Engine, then a division of General Motors. Faced with a commitment to invest a large amount of capital to take the project to a workable model installed in an automobile, Montgomery decided that the company should raise capital by developing and marketing other products that they had conceived. By now MacGregor and Davis had recruited two more CBS Laboratory alumni: John Wistrand, an industrial designer, and Jim Catrambone, in management. An air conditioner with no moving parts was a first effort.

Then Joe Montgomery, after a camping bike trip with his son, conceived &quot;the Bugger&quot; bicycle trailer. Ron Davis devised an under-seat hitch, a torsion spring made of Lexan. Wistrand designed the cloth bags and cargo carrier on the two models of trailers. Montgomery, in an effort repeated in numerous products, sourced the cloth components and oversaw their manufacture. At the New York Bicycle Show the team received requests from bike dealers who wanted to buy the bags. In less than six months Cannondale became the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of lightweight bicycle bags. Using a marketing plan devised by Montgomery, Cannondale secured orders from more than 2,500 dealers in less than 20 months. They then used the infrastructure developed to produce the bags to enter the camping goods market with backpacks and tents. Regarding the Bugger trailer, although Cannondale&#x27;s marketing department claimed to be unaware of the connotations of that name in British English, some were, nevertheless, exported to the UK.

Todd Patterson, another designer/inventor, joined the company and developed the process for jigging and welding aluminum bicycle frames, enabling Cannondale to become a bicycle manufacturer.

Today, Cannondale produces high-end bicycles, although they are no longer hand-made in the US. Many bicycle frame manufacturers use many materials such as steel or titanium whereas Cannondale specializes in aluminum and carbon fiber, a technology in which they were pioneers.

The name of the company was taken from the Cannondale Metro North train station in Wilton, Connecticut. Another story as told in their 1983 catalog is that employee Pete Meyers was sent to order telephone service installation in 1970. When asked for the name of the business to be listed under, Meyers coined the name while looking at a rusty cannon inscribed &quot;dale&quot; and the sign on the Cannon railroad crossing.

==Ownership==
Originally a privately held company, Cannondale became publicly held after a $22 million IPO in 1995.

In the late 1990s Cannondale moved into the motorsports business, producing a line of off-road motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles. According to an interview with Cannondale Communications Director, Tom Armstrong, the company was unable to reduce the cost of their vehicles fast enough. As sales increased, the company was losing money on each motorbike. This gap drove the company into bankruptcy protection on January 29, 2003. Cannondale&#x27;s full assets were then purchased at auction by Pegasus Capital Advisors fund Pegasus Partners II, L.P. Pegasus sold off the motorsport division and supported the company&#x27;s renewed focus on bicycle production.

In February 2008, Dorel Industries, a Canada-based diversified consumer products company, announced the purchase of Cannondale from Pegasus Capital for approximately $200 million. Dorel also owned Pacific Cycle, a distributor of bicycles made in Taiwan and the People&#x27;s Republic of China for sale under many historic U.S. cycle brands, including Schwinn, Mongoose, Roadmaster, and GT.

In April 2009 it was announced that all production would be transferred to Taiwan.

In January 2022, Pon Holdings, a Dutch mobility group, purchased Dorel Sports. Dorel Sports officially in hands of Pon Holdings.

==Products==

===Bicycle frames===
On January 23, 2014, Dorel Industries announced a restructuring of operations in its recreational/leisure segment. This resulted in the closure of its assembly and testing facility in Bedford, Pennsylvania. The Bedford plant, which at one point produced Cannondale&#x27;s midrange to high-end aluminum and aluminum/carbon fiber bikes, still handled some assembly, testing, quality control, and customer and technical services. Around 100 people were laid off. The Bedford facility was shuttered in 2015.
===CAAD design and manufacturing===

In 1992 Cannondale introduced the 2.8 series frame based on CAD (computer aided design) and finite element analysis to make a frame weighing only 2.8 lbs. The 2.8 series featured a tapered large diameter down tube, double-offset bottom-bracket cluster, ovalized top-tube, and double-butted seat tube to achieve the weight reduction. The same year the 1.25&quot; Sub One all aluminum fork was introduced.

Cannondale marketed subsequent frames with the CAAD designation (for &quot;Cannondale Advanced Aluminum Design&quot;) which first appeared in their mountain bike frame series. In 1997 the CAAD3 road frame was introduced featuring most of the design from the 2.8series. The CAAD4 model introduced S-bend aluminum seat stays for improved comfort.

The Six13 model, which was introduced in 2004, used carbon tube sections in the main triangle, and still employs aluminum rear triangles. This arrangement is contrary to the usual industry practice of using carbon stay inserts and aluminum front triangle tubes. The Union Cycliste Internationale has established a 6.8 kg (14.97 lb) minimum weight limit. Cannondale advertised this light weight frameset with the slogan &quot;Legalize my Cannondale&quot;. In reality, only the smallest size (50 cm) of bike actually approached the 6.8 kg limit. Some in the bicycle industry considered this to be a creative marketing effort because Six13 frames weighed the same as, or more than, competing frames from other manufacturers.

===Electric bicycles===

An electric bicycle manufactured by Cannondale Sports Group LLC includes a battery module based on Toshiba&#x27;s quick-charging lithium ion titanite rechargeable battery &quot;SCiB&quot;.

===Other components===
Cannondale developed a proprietary bottom bracket and crankset technology called &quot;Hollowgram&quot; which has been featured in its high-end bikes since 2001. The crank and bottom bracket set weigh 80 grams less and are 10% stiffer than Dura-Ace (FC-7800). The hollowgram bottom bracket shell can accept standard 68 mm English-threaded bottom bracket cartridges and external bearing cranksets through the use of an adapter. The aluminum Hollowgram crank is a two piece hollow shell that is bonded with aluminum glue. The Hollowgram bottom bracket axle is also hollow aluminum and oversized.

Cannondale has since made this a free international standard known as BB30. In BB30, the diameter of the bottom bracket spindle is increased from the standard 24mm to 30mm. As a result, the inside diameter of the bottom bracket shell is increased to 42mm. This allows a reduction in weight by permitting aluminum to be used as a spindle material instead of the more traditional steel. The larger spindle in addition to the larger bottom bracket shell make for increased stiffness of both the frame and crankset. Perhaps the biggest difference between the BB30 standard and more traditional bottom brackets is the use of pressed-in bearings rather than cartridge or cup bearings. The lack of threads or extra &quot;packaging&quot; creates additional weight savings. Because of the &quot;press fit&quot; needed to hold the bearings, tighter and more precise machining tolerances are needed. A disadvantage of BB30 is the harder-to-service nature presented by pressed-in bearings.

Cannondale has brought a few concepts to market that have since become accepted industry standards. Cannondale was the first to produce a crankset that uses externally mounted bottom bracket bearings, though they later discontinued this design. External bearings are now the most common type of bottom bracket for mid-level and higher bicycles. In 1992, Cannondale introduced the Headshok and the accompanying oversized headtube.
In 2001, the OnePointFive standard emerged using similar headtube dimensions as the Headshok headtube.

Less successfully, Cannondale mountain bikes (and briefly, the 2.8 road bike with a SubOne fork) produced in the mid-1990s used the Gary Fisher &quot;Evolution&quot;, or 1&quot; headset standard, in common with Fisher&#x27;s own bikes and Santana tandems. Although a larger headset seemed technically sound, the industry standardized instead upon the Tioga &quot;Avenger&quot;, or 1&quot; size, and headsets or stems for these bikes are now hard to find. A solution for cherished machines is to fit reducing rings and convert to a 1&quot; headset, fork and stem.

==== Notable Cannondale mountain bikes ====

===== SM-500 (1984) =====
The 1984 &quot;SM-500 All-Terrain Bicycle&quot; was Cannondale&#x27;s first mountain bike. The front wheel was 26 inches in diameter whereas the rear wheel was only 24 inches large &quot;to increase traction for climbing in steep, muddy terrain&quot;, Cannondale said. The frame was TIG welded from 6061 aluminium alloy and was fully heat treated. The same material and treatment Cannondale would use for all welded aluminum frames until the release of frames made from &quot;Alcoa Alcalyte Optimo&quot; alloy in 2003. The fork was made from chrome moly steel. The componentry on the SM-500 was a mixture of parts from Shimano Deore XT, Suntour, Specialized and Dia-Compe. The bike had a 3x5 drive train offering 15 gears, and cantilever brakes in the front and U-brakes in back. The bike retailed for $595 (approximately equivalent to $1640 in 2021–USD) in the United States.

===== Beast of the East =====

===== SE (1991) =====
The &quot;SE&quot; was Cannondale&#x27;s first frame with rear suspension, called &quot;Elevated Suspension Technology (E.S.T)&quot;, a rear triangle with a high pivot and elevated chain stays. SE models were sold with rigid &quot;Cannondale Pepperoni&quot; aluminum forks and &quot;Girvin Flexstem&quot; stems. The bikes shipped with Cannondale&#x27;s &quot;Force 40&quot; system to increase the braking power.

===== SM 3.0 =====

===== Delta V (1992) =====
The &quot;Delta V&quot; was the first bike to introduce Cannondale&#x27;s &quot;Delta V&quot; (later &quot;Headshok&quot;) suspension fork where the shock is integrated into the head tube. The Delta V was sold as a full-suspension bike with the E.S.T rear triangle, or as a &quot;front suspension only&quot; bike with a normal rigid frame (the term &quot;hardtail&quot; had not been invented). The original Delta V fork offered approximately 45–50 mm of travel and used an oil-damped air spring. The telescope of the Delta V fork had a square cross-section and instead of bushings, needle bearings were used to minimize stiction. Delta V forks were stiffer and more responsive than other suspension forks at the time.

Since the Delta V fork was taller than normal forks, the top end of head tube of Delta V frames was significantly higher. To not sacrifice stand-over clearance, Cannondale made a &quot;V-style&quot; top tube from two tubes – a very controversial design. Like other Cannondale mountain bike frames, the Delta V frame had a 50.8 mm (2 inches) down tube.

The full-suspension version was discontinued in 1994 in favor of the &quot;Super V&quot;. In 1994, the hardtail&#x27;s rear triangle was updated and was identical to the rear in the &quot;F&quot; series frames. The Delta V hardtail was finally retired in 1995 and replaced by the F series. The two-tube top tube design remained in use for the smallest frame size and reappeared in the &quot;Gemini&quot; and &#x27;Prophet&quot; models.

===== Super V (1993) =====
The &quot;Super V&quot;, a full-suspension bike, is arguably Cannondale&#x27;s most iconic mountain bike. Instead of a main triangle, Cannondale uses a massively oversized down tube and a mast to hold the seat. The rear wheel is suspended by a banana-shaped aluminum high-pivot swingarm providing about 75 mm of travel. The front wheel is guided by a Delta V fork. The Super V is one of the most futuristic looking bikes of its time.

Missy Giove won the 1994 downhill world championship on a Super V.

In 1995, the welded aluminum banana swingarm was replaced by a carbon-fiber version. This was Cannondale&#x27;s first carbon-fiber product.

In 1996, Cannondale changed the swingarm and lowered the pivot for the &quot;Super V Active&quot; to minimize pedal kickback present high-pivot swingarm designs. Different versions of the Super V Active frame and swingarm were made with travels of 80, 100, or 120 mm. Some models in 2000 and 2001 shipped with a new, bonded aluminum swingarm that was less expensive.

The Super V was discontinued in 2003.

===== V 4000 (1993) =====
The V 4000 was a non-functional full-suspension concept bike that never went into production, yet it caught attention due its futuristic design. The frame and the wheels were machined from aluminum. The highlight of the design was the suspension, two single-sided swingarms. Cannondale&#x27;s president at the time, Joe Montgomery, said he would eat his hat if the V 4000 wouldn&#x27;t be in the shops in the next season. Although Cannondale promised additional information later in the year, it was never revealed how the suspension was planned to work. The V 4000 was widely considered a show bike for magazines and trade shows, and Montgomery eventually ate his hat. The V 4000 was the first in a row of concept bikes Cannondale presented.

===== Killer V (1994) =====
The Killer V was a version of the Delta V without a suspension fork but with a 1.25&quot; rigid &quot;Pepperoni&quot; fork. The down tube diameter was increased from 50.8 mm to 58 mm which made the bike very stiff.

===== F (1995) =====
The F was the front suspension bike line with Cannondale&#x27;s suspension forks, called &quot;Headshok&quot; since 1994. In contrast to the Delta V frame, the F series had a straight top tube. The frame was available with either a swagged (&quot;2.8 series&quot;, later &quot;CAAD 3&quot;) or a straight (&quot;3.0 series&quot;, later &quot;CAAD 2&quot;) down tube. The rear triangle features wishbone seat stays.

Alison Sydor won 3 cross-country world-championships (1994–1996), and a silver medal at the 1996 Olympic Games on this bike.

===== Super V DH (1996) =====

===== Super V Raven (1997) =====
The &quot;Raven&quot; was a version of the Super V with a carbon-aluminum frame. It was the first bicycle frame by Cannondale made with carbon-fiber. Instead of an aluminum weldment, the main frame of the Raven was made of a cast and machined aluminum spine bonded between two carbon-fiber shells. The rear triangle was identical to the aluminum Super V&#x27;s. The frame was updated in 2000. After a recall in 2001 of all Raven II frames due to failures of the pivot and bottom bracket area, the Raven was discontinued in 2002. The Raven frame was hollow and a large sound box.

===== Super V DHF / Fulcrum (1997) =====

===== Jekyll (2001) =====
The &quot;Jekyll&quot; was a full-suspension bike using the same swingarm as the contemporary Super V but with a traditional down tube and top tube design. The rear shock mount in the frame was adjustable such that the head tube and seat tube angles could be changed by the rider. Initially, the Jekyll came with 120 mm rear travel, and 135 mm from 2003 on. The front suspension was typically a Cannondale &quot;Headshok Fatty&quot; or a Cannondale &quot;Lefty&quot;. The Jekyll was discontinued in 2006.

===== Scalpel (2002) =====
The &quot;Scalpel&quot; was a light-weight full-suspension bike designed for cross-country racing with flexible carbon-fiber chain stays instead of a pivot, providing 63 mm of rear travel and 67 mm from model year 2003 on.
In 2008, Cannondale introduced an all-carbon Scalpel, and moved the rear shock to enable 100 mm travel. The 26-inch version was discontinued in 2013 when Cannondale finished to 29-inch wheels for cross-country bikes.

===== Gemini (2003) =====

===== Chase (2005) =====
The &quot;Chase&quot; was a dirt-jump bike developed with Cannondale sponsored rider Aaron Chase. The Chase was discontinued in 2010 and it remained the first and only dirt-jump bike made by Cannondale until the introduction of the &quot;Dave&quot; in 2021.

<text>That Hideous Strength: A Modern Fairy-Tale for Grown-Ups (also released under the title The Tortured Planet in an abridged format) is a 1945 novel by C. S. Lewis, the final book in Lewis&#x27;s theological science fiction Space Trilogy. The events of this novel follow those of &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; and &quot;Perelandra&quot; (also titled &quot;Voyage to Venus&quot;) and once again feature the philologist Elwin Ransom. Yet unlike the principal events of those two novels, the story takes place on Earth rather than elsewhere in the Solar System. The story involves an ostensibly scientific institute, the National Institute for Co-ordinated Experiments (N.I.C.E.), which is a front for sinister supernatural forces.

The novel was heavily influenced by the writing of Lewis&#x27;s friend and fellow Inkling Charles Williams, and is markedly dystopian in style. In the foreword, Lewis states that the novel&#x27;s point is the same as that of his 1943 non-fiction work &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot;, which argues that there are natural laws and objective values that education should teach children to recognise.

The novel&#x27;s title is taken from a poem written by David Lyndsay in 1555, &quot;&quot;, also known as &quot;The Monarche&quot;. The couplet in question, &quot;&quot;, refers to the Tower of Babel.

==Plot==
The novel, written during the final period of World War II, takes place at an undetermined year &quot;after the end of the war&quot;.

Mark Studdock is a young academic who has just become a Senior Fellow in sociology at Bracton College in the University of Edgestow. The fellows of Bracton are debating the sale of a portion of college land to the National Institute for Co-ordinated Experiments (N.I.C.E.), whose staff already includes some college faculty. The sale is controversial since the land in question (Bragdon Wood) is an ancient woodland believed to be the resting place of Merlin. After the deal is struck, a N.I.C.E. insider named Lord Feverstone proposes a possible post for Mark at the Institute. (It is gradually revealed that Feverstone is the new title of Richard Devine, who accompanied Professor Weston on the trip to Mars in &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;, but not on the trip to Venus in &quot;Perelandra&quot;.)

Mark&#x27;s wife Jane (a PhD student at the university) has suffered a peculiar nightmare involving a severed head. She meets Mrs. Dimble, the wife of one of her former tutors, who is being evicted due to sale of land to the N.I.C.E. When Jane talks about her dreams, Mrs. Dimble leads her to seek counsel from a Miss Ironwood who lives in the Manor in the nearby town of St Anne&#x27;s. An argument between Jane and Mark shows how their marriage is deteriorating.

Lord Feverstone introduces Mark to the N.I.C.E., where he becomes acquainted with the top brass at their headquarters at Belbury, near Edgestow. Mark can never find out what his place in the organisation is; he has no office, is given no duties for some time, and seems to be alternately in and out of favour. A scientist named Bill Hingest, who is resigning from the N.I.C.E., warns Mark to get out. That night, Hingest is mysteriously murdered.

At the same time, Jane works up the courage to visit Miss Ironwood at St Anne&#x27;s. Miss Ironwood, who is dressed in black just as Jane had dreamed of her, is convinced that Jane&#x27;s dreams are visions of genuine events. Later, Jane is introduced to Dr Elwin Ransom, the protagonist of the first two books in Lewis&#x27;s space trilogy. He has become the Pendragon or heir of King Arthur, the ruler of the nation of Logres, which is described as the good side of Britain. More mundanely, he is the Director of the group living in the Manor at St Anne&#x27;s. He is in communication with the Oyéresu (singular &quot;Oyarsa&quot;), angelic beings who guide the planets of the Solar System. Earth has been in quarantine: its rebellious Oyarsa (who is the Devil) and his demons could not travel beyond the orbit of the Moon, and the other Oyéresu could not come to Earth.

Mark is finally given work: to write pseudonymous newspaper articles supporting the N.I.C.E., including two for use after a riot they intend to provoke in Edgestow. The riot takes place as planned, allowing the N.I.C.E.&#x27;s private police force to take over the town. They arrest Jane, in whom the N.I.C.E. are interested (as revealed later) because of her psychic abilities, which they fear will get into their opponents&#x27; hands. The head of the N.I.C.E. police, a woman known as &quot;Fairy&quot; Hardcastle, starts to torture Jane but is forced to release her when rioters turn in her direction. Totally exhausted and nearly unconscious, Jane is a rescued and taken to St Anne&#x27;s.

Mark is once again out of favour in the N.I.C.E., but after a conversation with an Italian scientist named Filostrato he is introduced to the Head of the Institute. This turns out to be a literal head – that of a recently guillotined French scientist (as Jane dreamed) which Filostrato erroneously believes he has restored to life by his own efforts.

From Jane&#x27;s dreams that people were digging up the grave of a long-buried man and that the man had left, Ransom concludes that the N.I.C.E. is looking for the body of Merlin, who truly is buried in Bragdon Wood – not dead, but rather in a timeless state. Jane will guide members of the group to the place she dreamed of.

The N.I.C.E. bosses now try to strengthen their hold over Mark by showing him trumped-up evidence that he murdered Bill Hingest. This backfires, as the crisis finally gives Mark the courage to leave Belbury. He returns to Edgestow in search of Jane only to find their apartment empty and the town under N.I.C.E. control. Later he meets Cecil Dimble, one of the St Anne&#x27;s community, who despite his misgivings offers to help him. Mark deliberates too long over Dimble&#x27;s proposal and he is found and arrested for Hingest&#x27;s murder.

That night, during a heavy storm, both the company of St Anne&#x27;s and N.I.C.E. personnel are on the trail of Merlin, who has apparently revived. He has taken the clothes of a tramp through his powers of hypnosis and acquired a wild horse. He meets the company of St Anne&#x27;s but rides away. Members of the N.I.C.E. capture the tramp, believing him to be Merlin.

Mark, while contemplating his upcoming trial and execution, discovers that he has not been arrested by the real police but by officials of the N.I.C.E. who (he now guesses) are the true murderers of Hingest. To his surprise, he is told that he is to be initiated into the group&#x27;s inner ring. In preparation for this he begins a bizarre training programme, led by Professor Frost, intended to cultivate absolute objectivity by relegating emotion to the status of a chemical phenomenon. He outwardly participates in these rituals (knowing that he will otherwise be killed) but inwardly begins to reject everything the N.I.C.E. stands for.

Merlin arrives at St Anne&#x27;s ahead of his pursuers, where he and Ransom converse in Latin. Ransom reveals that there are Satanic forces behind the N.I.C.E. and that Merlin is to be possessed by the Oyéresu; since the forces of darkness broke the lunar barrier in the earlier books, the heavenly beings may also cross the barrier and intervene in human affairs.

Jane has two mystical experiences; the first with the earth-bound counterpart of the Oyarsa of Venus and the second with God. After discussions with Mrs. Dimble and the Director, she becomes a Christian.

Merlin, now possessed by the Oyéresu, disguises himself as a Basque priest and answers the N.I.C.E.&#x27;s advertisement for an interpreter of ancient languages. He hypnotises and interviews the tramp (who the N.I.C.E. still believe may be the real Merlin) and the two of them are brought to a banquet. There Merlin pronounces the curse of Babel upon the assembled N.I.C.E. leaders, causing all present to speak gibberish, and also liberates the many animals on which the N.I.C.E. were experimenting. The bigger animals kill most of the N.I.C.E. staff.

As earthquakes destroy the building, Lord Feverstone flees to Edgestow but is killed when that too is engulfed. Others escape and wander to the Head, where Filostrato is sacrificed, Wither kills Straik, and Wither is killed by a bear. Meanwhile, Frost angrily commits suicide in the Objectivity Room. Merlin helps Mark escape and sends him to St Anne&#x27;s. The Oyarsa of Venus lingers at the Manor, as Ransom is now to be transported back to that planet. When Mark arrives, a vision of Venus leads him into a bridal chamber that Jane has been preparing for him.

==Setting and context==
The novel is set in post-war England, in the fictional English town of Edgestow, in approximately 1948 according to the internal timeline of &#x27;The Cosmic Trilogy&#x27;. The story takes place inside the University of Edgestow, within the nearby town, at the new N.I.C.E. headquarters, and at St Anne&#x27;s Manor.

Elwin Ransom, introduced in the novel in Chapter 7, is the protagonist of the first two books in Lewis&#x27;s space trilogy, and his point of view dominates their narrative. Lord Feverstone (formerly Dick Devine) was a villain in the first novel who, along with Professor Weston, had abducted Ransom to Mars in the mistaken belief that the Martians required a sacrifice. When Feverstone speaks in &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; of Weston having been murdered by &quot;the opposition&quot;, he is speaking of Ransom having killed Weston (who had become possessed by a devil) on Venus as described in &quot;Perelandra&quot;. The first two books fully explicate Lewis&#x27;s mythology (based on a combination of the Bible and medieval cosmology) according to which each planet of the solar system is ruled by an angelic spirit. This mythos is re-introduced gradually in this story, whose protagonists—the earthbound Mark and Jane Studdock—are unaware of these realities when the story opens.

==Characters==
*Mark Gainsby Studdock – Protagonist; sociologist, and ambitious to the point of obsession with reaching the &quot;inner circle&quot; of his social environment.
*Jane Tudor Studdock – Protagonist; Mark&#x27;s wife. Jane is supposedly writing a PhD thesis on John Donne, but since her marriage she has become effectively a housewife. In the course of the book she discovers herself to be clairvoyant.

===Bracton College===
*Sub-Warden Curry – Leader of the &quot;Progressive Element&quot; at Bracton College, a well-organised cabal that manipulates the college into welcoming the N.I.C.E. He is in fact a very gullible and shallow sort of man, who himself is easily manipulated by the N.I.C.E.
*James Busby – A former clergyman and bursar at Bracton College and another member of the &#x27;Progressive Element&#x27;.

===N.I.C.E.===
*John Wither – Long-winded bureaucrat and Deputy Director of the N.I.C.E. He is the true leader of the N.I.C.E. and a servant of the Macrobes. Long association with them has &quot;withered&quot; his mind, and his speech and thinking are characterised by thought-deadening vagueness and jargon. 
*Professor Augustus Frost – A psychologist and assistant to Wither, he is the only other N.I.C.E initiate who knows the true nature of the Head and of the Macrobes. He is coldhearted and unemotional and he has an exact, precise manner of speech and thinking.
*Miss Hardcastle (a.k.a. &quot;The Fairy&quot;) – The sadistic, cigar-chewing head of the N.I.C.E. Institutional Police and its female auxiliary, the &quot;Waips&quot;. Torture is her favourite interrogation method, and she takes special, sexual pleasure in abusing female prisoners.
*Dr Filostrato – An obese Italian eunuch physiologist. His ultimate goal is to free humanity from the constraints of organic life.
*Lord Feverstone (Dick Devine) – A politician, recently ennobled businessman, and nominal academic who lures Mark into the N.I.C.E. Feverstone (with Professor Weston) kidnapped Ransom in &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; and was responsible for getting Mark Studdock his fellowship at Bracton. 
*Reverend Straik – the &quot;Mad Parson&quot;. He believes that any sort of power is a manifestation of God&#x27;s will. It is noted that &quot;he was originally a good man&quot; and that he was warped by grief over the death of his daughter. 
*Horace Jules – A Cockney novelist, tabloid reporter, and pseudo-scientific journalist who has been appointed Director of the N.I.C.E. 
*William (Bill) Hingest – A distinguished chemist who is recruited by the N.I.C.E. but soon decides to resign.

===St Anne&#x27;s===
*Dr Elwin Ransom (also known as &quot;the Pendragon&quot; and &quot;the Director&quot;) – A former Cambridge don who heads the community at St Anne&#x27;s. He alone communicates with the benevolent &quot;eldila&quot; (angels), whom he met during his earlier voyages to Malacandra and Perelandra (Mars and Venus). He has changed his surname to Fisher-King and has a wound in his foot, received on Venus, that will not heal until he returns there. His heavenly experiences have made him a kingly figure among his small band of followers, and he attributes his following to a divine Power, presumably Maleldil (Jesus Christ).
*Grace Ironwood – The seemingly stern but kind psychologist and doctor who helps Jane interpret her dreams. 
*Dr Cecil Dimble – Another academic, an old friend of Ransom, and close adviser on matters of Arthurian scholarship and pre-Norman Britain. 
*Margaret &quot;Mother&quot; Dimble – The wife of Cecil Dimble and a close friend of Jane. 
*Ivy Maggs – Formerly a part-time maid for Jane Studdock; now driven out of the town by the N.I.C.E. and living at St Anne&#x27;s. 
*Merlinus Ambrosius – The wizard Merlin, awakened and returned to serve the Pendragon and save England. Receives the powers of the Oyéresu. He has been in a deep sleep since the time of King Arthur, and both sides initially believe he will join the N.I.C.E. 
*Andrew MacPhee – A scientist, sceptic and rationalist who is a close friend of Dr Ransom and joins him at St Anne&#x27;s. 
*Arthur Denniston – An academic at Edgestow and a former friend of Mark Studdock from student days. 
*Camilla Denniston – The wife of Arthur Denniston.
*Mr Bultitude – A large brown bear.

==Themes and philosophy==
A significant element of the book (Lewis rated it as &quot;second in importance&quot;) is to illustrate the destructive folly of seeking power and prestige by belonging to a ruling clique or inner circle. 

Somewhat like the early Gnostics, the main antagonists of &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; despise the human body and all organic life as frail, corrupted, and unworthy of pure mind. Like modern transhumanists, they believe that humanity can be perfected by migrating out of flesh and blood. Lewis portrays the consequences of these ideas as a dystopian nightmare: by rejecting God and His creation, the N.I.C.E inevitably falls under the dominion of demons (whom they imagine to have discovered under the guise of &quot;Macrobes&quot;). Lewis had hinted at such themes before in &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot;, in which the senior demon Screwtape tells his nephew that their goal is &quot;to emotionalise and mythologise their science to such an extent that what is, in effect, a belief in [demons] (though not under that name) will creep in while the human mind remains closed to belief in [God]. [...] If once we can produce our perfect work—the Materialist Magician, the man, not using, but veritably worshipping, what he vaguely calls &#x27;Forces&#x27; while denying the existence of &#x27;spirits&#x27;—then the end of the war will be in sight.&quot; Lewis&#x27;s attack is not on science as such, or scientific planning, but rather the kind of totalitarian planned society idealised by Nazism and Bolshevism: &quot;the disciplined cruelty of some ideological oligarchy&quot;.

In contrast, Lewis portrays reality as supporting Christian tenets such as the inherent sinfulness of humanity, the impossibility of humans perfecting themselves apart from God, the essential goodness of the physical body (though currently corrupted by sin), the omnipotence of God against the limited powers of evil, and the existence of angels and demons. Within this Christian framework, Lewis incorporates elements of the Arthurian legend as well as Roman mythological figures. In this way, Lewis integrates Christian, Roman, and British mythological symbolism, true to his identity as a British Christian student of antiquity.

==Development and influences==
Lewis started writing &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; during World War II, finishing the first draft in 1943. During the War, Lewis taught at Oxford University and among other writing projects worked on the last two books of his &quot;Space Trilogy&quot;—&quot;Perelandra&quot; (1943) and &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;.

The novel makes reference to &quot;Numinor and the True West&quot;, which Lewis credits as a then-unpublished creation of J. R. R. Tolkien; they were friends and colleagues at Oxford University and fellow members of the Inklings. The misspelling of Númenor came from Lewis&#x27;s only hearing Tolkien say the name in one of his readings.

Charles Williams&#x27;s treatments of the King Arthur legends were a significant influence on the Arthurian elements of the novel. Brenton D. G. Dickieson writes, &quot;Williams&#x27; idea of Logres emerges in &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;, forming the speculative framework of a good-evil dialectic in the apocalyptic narrative of this last Ransom chronicle&quot;.

In the book&#x27;s preface, Lewis acknowledges science-fiction writer Olaf Stapledon and his work: &quot;Mr. Stapledon is so rich in invention that he can well afford to lend, and I admire his invention (though not his philosophy) so much that I should feel no shame to borrow.&quot;

==Reception==
Some two years before writing &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, George Orwell reviewed &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; for the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, commenting: &quot;Plenty of people in our age do entertain the monstrous dreams of power that Mr Lewis attributes to his characters [the N.I.C.E. scientists], and we are within sight of the time when such dreams will be realizable.&quot; The review was written shortly after the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, Orwell argued that the book &quot;would have been stronger without the supernatural elements&quot;. Particularly, Orwell objected to the ending in which N.I.C.E. is overthrown by divine intervention: &quot;[Lewis] is entitled to his beliefs, but they weaken his story, not only because they offend the average reader&#x27;s sense of probability but because in effect they decide the issue in advance. When one is told that God and the Devil are in conflict, one always knows which side is going to win. The whole drama of the struggle against evil lies in the fact that one does not have supernatural aid.&quot; However, Orwell still maintained that the book was &quot;worth reading&quot;.

Leonard Bacon, reviewing &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;, described the book as &quot;a ghastly but in many places a magnificent nightmare&quot;. He criticised the character of Studdock as uninteresting, noting that &quot;it is hard to get excited about the vagaries of a young, insecure and ambitious academic figure whose main concern is to get into an inner circle, any inner circle&quot;, but praised the plotting of the book: &quot;The hunt of Ransom&#x27;s remnant for the real Merlin while the villains capture the false one is as vivid as a passage in Stevenson.&quot; Although Bacon regarded the book as somewhat inferior to its two predecessors, he concluded: &quot;This is just the sort of thing that pleases Mr. Lewis&#x27;s admirers. And they are right to admire him. Win, lose or draw—and the reviewer doesn&#x27;t think that this book is wholly victorious—Mr. Lewis adds energy to systems he comes in contact with.&quot;

Floyd C. Gale wrote that the book &quot;bears the authentic stamp of its creator&#x27;s awesome imagination&quot;.

J. B. S. Haldane published two essays attacking Lewis&#x27;s negative views on science and progress, as he saw them; the first was entitled &quot;Auld Hornie, F.R.S.&quot;. Lewis&#x27;s response remained unpublished in his lifetime.

Alister McGrath says the novel &quot;shows [C. S. Lewis] to have been a prophetic voice, offering a radical challenge to the accepted social wisdom of his own generation&quot;.

==Publication history==
Lewis made minor alterations between the first British and American editions. For example, some of the Latin is corrected, and a scene where Merlin hides in the hedgerow was removed by Lewis.

<text>The Great Trek was a northward migration of Dutch-speaking settlers who travelled by wagon trains from the Cape Colony into the interior of modern South Africa from 1836 onwards, seeking to live beyond the Cape&#x27;s British colonial administration. The Great Trek resulted from the culmination of tensions between rural descendants of the Cape&#x27;s original European settlers, known collectively as Boers, and the British. It was also reflective of an increasingly common trend among individual Boer communities to pursue an isolationist and semi-nomadic lifestyle away from the developing administrative complexities in Cape Town. Boers who took part in the Great Trek identified themselves as voortrekkers, meaning &quot;pioneers&quot; or &quot;pathfinders&quot; (literally &quot;fore-trekkers&quot;) in Dutch and Afrikaans.

The Great Trek led directly to the founding of several autonomous Boer republics, namely the South African Republic (also known simply as the Transvaal), the Orange Free State and the Natalia Republic. It also led to conflicts that resulted in the displacement of the Northern Ndebele people, and conflicts with the Zulu people that contributed to the decline and eventual collapse of the Zulu Kingdom.

== Background ==

Before the arrival of Europeans, the Cape of Good Hope area was populated by Khoisan tribes. The first Europeans settled in the Cape area under the auspices of the Dutch East India Company (also known by its Dutch initials &quot;VOC&quot;), which established a victualling station there in 1652 to provide its outward bound fleets with fresh provisions and a harbour of refuge during the long sea journey from Europe to Asia (Hunt, John (2005)). In a few short decades, the Cape had become home to a large population of &quot;Glidden&quot;, also denoted as &quot;burgers&quot; (free citizens), former Company employees who remained in Dutch territories overseas after completing their contracts. Since the primary purpose of the Cape settlement at the time was to stock provisions for passing Dutch ships, the VOC offered grants of farmland to its employees under the condition they would cultivate grain for the Company warehouses, and released them from their contracts to save on their wages. &quot;Vrijburgers&quot; were granted tax-exempt status for 12 years and loaned all the necessary seeds and farming implements they requested. They were married Dutch citizens, considered &quot;of good character&quot; by the Company, and had to commit to spending at least 20 years on the African continent. Reflecting the multi-national character of the VOC&#x27;s workforce, some German soldiers and sailors were also considered for &quot;vrijburger&quot; status as well, and in 1688 the Dutch government sponsored the resettlement of over a hundred French Huguenot refugees at the Cape. As a result, by 1691 over a quarter of the colony&#x27;s European population was not ethnically Dutch. Nevertheless, there was a degree of cultural assimilation through intermarriage, and the almost universal adoption of the Dutch language. Cleavages were likelier to occur along social and economic lines; broadly speaking, the Cape colonists were delineated into &quot;Boers&quot;, poor farmers who settled directly on the frontier, and the more affluent, predominantly urbanised &quot;Cape Dutch&quot;.

Following the Flanders Campaign and the Batavian Revolution in Amsterdam, France assisted in the establishment of a pro-French client state, the Batavian Republic, on Dutch soil. This opened the Cape to French warships. To protect her own prosperous maritime shipping routes, Great Britain occupied the fledgling colony by force until 1803. From 1806 to 1814, the Cape was governed as a British military dependency, whose sole importance to the Royal Navy was its strategic relation to Indian maritime traffic. The British formally assumed permanent administrative control around 1815, as a result of the Treaty of Paris.

=== Causes ===
At the onset of the British rule, the Cape Colony encompassed and was populated by about 26,720 people of European descent, a relative majority of whom were of Dutch origin. Just over a quarter were of German ancestry and about one-sixth were descended from French Huguenots, although most had ceased speaking French since about 1750. There were also 30,000 African and Asian slaves owned by the settlers, and about 17,000 indigenous Khoisan. Relations between the settlers – especially the Boers – and the new administration quickly soured. The British authorities were adamantly opposed to the Boers&#x27; ownership of slaves and what was perceived as their unduly harsh treatment of the indigenous peoples. 

The British government insisted that the Cape finance its own affairs through self-taxation, an approach which was alien to both the Boers and the Dutch merchants in Cape Town. In 1815, the controversial death of a white farmer, who was shot after resisting arrest for abusing his native servant, resulted in the abortive Slachter&#x27;s Nek Rebellion. The British executed five Boers for insurrection. In 1828, the Cape governor declared that all native inhabitants but slaves were to have the rights of &quot;citizens&quot;, in respect of security and property ownership, on parity with the settlers. This had the effect of further alienating the colony&#x27;s white population. Boer resentment of successive British administrators continued to grow throughout the late 1820s and early 1830s, especially with the official imposition of the English language. This replaced Dutch with English as the language used in the Cape&#x27;s judicial and political systems, putting the Boers at a disadvantage, as most spoke little or no English.

Britain&#x27;s alienation of the Boers was particularly amplified by the decision to abolish slavery in all its colonies in 1834. All 35,000 slaves registered with the Cape governor were to be freed and given rights on par with other citizens, although in most cases their masters could retain them as apprentices until 1838. Many Boers, especially those involved with grain and wine production, were dependent on slave labour; for example, 94% of all white farmers in the vicinity of Stellenbosch owned slaves at the time, and the size of their slave holdings correlated greatly to their production output. Compensation was offered by the British government, but payment had to be received in London, and few Boers possessed the funds to make the trip.

Bridling at what they considered an unwarranted intrusion into their way of life, some in the Boer community considered selling their farms and venturing deep into South Africa&#x27;s unmapped interior to preempt further disputes and live completely independent from British rule. Others, especially &quot;trekboers&quot;, a class of Boers who pursued semi-nomadic pastoral activities, were frustrated by the apparent unwillingness or inability of the British government to extend the borders of the Cape Colony eastward and provide them with access to more prime pasture and economic opportunities. They resolved to trek beyond the colony&#x27;s borders on their own.

===Opposition===

Although it did nothing to impede the Great Trek, Great Britain viewed the movement with pronounced trepidation. The British government initially suggested that conflict in the far interior of Southern Africa between the migrating Boers and the Bantu peoples they encountered would require an expensive military intervention. However, authorities at the Cape also judged that the human and material cost of pursuing the settlers and attempting to re-impose an unpopular system of governance on those who had deliberately spurned it was not worth the immediate risk. Some officials were concerned for the tribes the Boers were certain to encounter, and whether these tribes would be enslaved or otherwise reduced to a state of penury. 

The Great Trek was not universally popular among the settlers either. Around 12,000 of them took part in the migration, about a fifth of the colony&#x27;s Dutch-speaking white population at the time. The Dutch Reformed Church, to which most of the Boers belonged, explicitly refused to endorse the Great Trek. Despite their hostility towards the British, there were Boers who chose to remain in the Cape of their own accord.

For its part, the distinct Cape Dutch community had accepted British rule; many of its members even considered themselves loyal British subjects with a special affection for English culture. The Cape Dutch were also much more heavily urbanised and therefore less likely to be susceptible to the same rural grievances and considerations as those held by the Boers.

== Exploratory treks to Natal ==
In January 1832, Andrew Smith (an Englishman) and William Berg (a Boer farmer) scouted Natal as a potential colony. On their return to the Cape, Smith waxed very enthusiastic, and the impact of discussions Berg had with the Boers proved crucial. Berg portrayed Natal as a land of exceptional farming quality, well watered, and nearly devoid of inhabitants.

In June 1834, the Boer leaders of Uitenhage and Grahamstown discussed a (&#x27;Commission Trek&#x27;) to visit Natal and to assess its potential as a new homeland for the Cape Boers who were disenchanted with British rule at the Cape. Petrus Lafras Uys was chosen as trek leader. At the same time at Graaff-Reinet, Jan Gerritze Bantjes heard about the exploratory trek to Port Natal and, encouraged by his father Bernard Louis Bantjes, sent word to Uys of his interest in participating. Bantjes wanted to help re-establish Dutch independence over the Boers and to get away from British law at the Cape. In early August 1834, he set off with some travellers headed for Grahamstown away, a three-week journey from Graaff-Reinet. Sometime around late August 1834 he arrived in Grahamstown, contacted Uys and made his introductions. Bantjes was already well known in the area as an educated young man fluent both in spoken and written Dutch and in English. Because of these skills, Uys invited Bantjes to join him. Bantjes&#x27;s writing skills would prove invaluable in recording events as the journey unfolded.

On 8 September 1834, the of 40 men and one woman, as well as a retinue of coloured servants, set off from Grahamstown for Natal with 14 wagons. Moving through the Eastern Cape, they were welcomed by the Xhosa who were in dispute with the neighbouring Zulu King Dingane ka Senzangakhona, and they passed unharmed into Natal. They travelled more or less the same route that Smith and Berg had taken two years earlier.

The trek avoided the coastal route, keeping to the flatter inland terrain. The approached Port Natal from East Griqualand and Ixopo, crossing the upper regions of the Mtamvuna and Umkomazi rivers. Travel was slow due to the rugged terrain, and since it was the summer, the rainy season had swollen many of the rivers to their maximum. Progress required days of scouting to locate the most suitable tracks to negotiate. Eventually, after weeks of extraordinary toil, the small party arrived at Port Natal, crossing the Congela River and weaving their way through the coastal forest into the bay area. They had travelled a distance of about from Grahamstown. This trip would have taken about 5 to 6 months with their slow moving wagons. The Drakensberg route via Kerkenberg into Natal had not yet been discovered.

They arrived at the sweltering hot bay of Port Natal in February 1835, exhausted after their long journey. There, the trek was soon welcomed with open arms by the few British hunters and ivory traders there such as James Collis, including Reverend Allen Francis Gardiner, an ex-commander of the Royal Navy ship &quot;Clinker&quot;, who had decided to start a mission station there. After congenial exchanges between the Boers and British sides, the party joined them and invited Dick King to become their guide.

The Boers set up their (&#x27;wagon fort&#x27;) camp in the area of the present-day Greyville Racecourse in Durban, chosen because it had suitable grazing for the oxen and horses and was far from the foraging hippos in the bay. Several small streams running off the Berea ridge provided fresh water. Alexander Biggar was also at the bay as a professional elephant-hunter and provided the trekkers with information regarding conditions at Port Natal. Bantjes made notes suggested by Uys, which later formed the basis of his more comprehensive report on the positive aspects of Natal. Bantjes also made rough maps of the bay - although this journal is now missing - showing the potential for a harbour which could supply the Boers in their new homeland.

At Port Natal, Uys sent Dick King, who could speak Zulu, to uMgungundlovu to investigate with King Dingane the possibility of granting them land. When Dick King returned to Port Natal some weeks later, he reported that King Dingane insisted they visit him in person. Johannes Uys, brother of Piet Uys, and a number of comrades with a few wagons travelled toward King Dingane&#x27;s capital at uMgungundlovu, and after making a camp at the mouth of the Mvoti River, they proceeded on horseback, but were halted by a flooded Tugela River and forced to return to the .

The left Port Natal for Grahamstown with a stash of ivory in early June 1835, following more or less the same route back to the Cape, and arrived at Grahamstown in October 1835. On Piet Uys&#x27;s recommendation, Bantjes set to work on the first draft of the Natalialand Report. Meetings and talks took place in the main church to much approval, and the first sparks of Trek Fever began to take hold. From all the information accumulated at Port Natal, Bantjes drew up the final report on &quot;Natalia or Natal Land&quot; that acted as the catalyst which inspired the Boers at the Cape to set in motion the Great Trek.

== First wave ==
The first wave of Voortrekkers lasted from 1835 to 1840, during which an estimated 6,000 people (roughly 10% of the Cape Colony&#x27;s white population or 20% of the white population in the eastern district in 1830s) trekked.
The first two parties of Voortrekkers left in September 1835, led by Louis Tregardt and Hans van Rensburg. These two parties crossed the Vaal river at Robert&#x27;s Drift in January 1836, but in April 1836 the two parties split up, just from the Soutpansberg mountains, following differences between Tregardt and van Rensburg.

In late July 1836 van Rensburg&#x27;s entire party of 49, except two children who were saved by a Zulu warrior, were massacred at Inhambane by an impi (a force of warriors) of Manukosi. Those of Tregardt&#x27;s party that had set up around Soutpansberg moved on to colonise Delagoa Bay, with most of the party, including Tregardt, perishing from fever.

A party led by Hendrik Potgieter trekked out of the Tarka area in either late 1835 or early 1836, and in September 1836 a party led by Gerrit Maritz began their trek from Graaff-Reinet. There was no clear consensus amongst the trekkers on where they were going to settle, but they all had the goal of settling near an outlet to the sea.

===Conflict with the Matebele===
In August 1836, despite pre-existing peace agreements with local black leaders, a Ndebele (Matebele) patrol attacked the Liebenberg family part of Potgieter&#x27;s party, killing six men, two women and six children. It is thought that their primary aim was to plunder the Voortrekkers&#x27; cattle. On 20 October 1836, Potgieter&#x27;s party was attacked by an army of 4,600 Ndebele warriors at the Battle of Vegkop. Thirty-five armed trekkers repulsed the Ndebele assault on their with the loss of two men and almost all the trekkers&#x27; cattle. Potgieter, Uys and Maritz mounted two punitive commando raids. The first resulted in the sacking of the Ndebele colony at Mosega, the death of 400 Ndebele, and the taking of 7,000 cattle. The second commando forced Mzilikazi and his followers to flee to what is now modern day Zimbabwe.

By spring 1837, five to six large Voortrekker colonies had been established between the Vaal and Orange Rivers with a total population of around 2,000 trekkers.

===Conflict with the Zulu===
In October 1837 Retief met with Zulu King Dingane to negotiate a treaty for land in what is now Kwa-Zulu Natal. King Dingane, suspicious and untrusting because of previous Voortrekker influxes from across the Drakensberg, had Retief and seventy of his followers killed.

Various interpretations of what transpired exist, as only the missionary Francis Owen&#x27;s written eye-witness account survived. Retief&#x27;s written request for land contained veiled threats by referring to the Voortrekker&#x27;s defeat of indigenous groups encountered along their journey. The Voortrekker demand for a written contract guaranteeing private property ownership was incompatible with the contemporaneous Zulu oral culture which prescribed that a chief could only temporarily dispense land as it was communally owned.

Most versions agree that the following happened: King Dingane&#x27;s authority extended over some of the land in which the Boers wanted to settle. As prerequisite to granting the Voortrekker request, he demanded that the Voortrekkers return some cattle stolen by Sekonyela, a rival chief. After the Boers retrieved the cattle, King Dingane invited Retief to his residence at uMgungundlovu to finalise the treaty, having either planned the massacre in advance, or deciding to do so after Retief and his men arrived.

King Dingane&#x27;s reputed instruction to his warriors, &quot;&quot; (Zulu for &quot;kill the witches&quot;) may indicate that he considered the Boers to wield evil supernatural powers. After killing Retief&#x27;s delegation, a Zulu army of 7,000 impis were sent out and immediately attacked Voortrekker encampments in the Drakensberg foothills at what later was called Blaauwkrans and Weenen, leading to the Weenen massacre in which 532 people were killed, including 282 Voortrekkers, of whom 185 were children, and 250 Khoikhoi and Basuto accompanying them. In contrast to earlier conflicts with the Xhosa on the eastern Cape frontier, the Zulus killed women and children along with men, wiping out half of the Natal contingent of Voortrekkers.

The Voortrekkers retaliated with a 347-strong punitive raid against the Zulu (later known as the Flight Commando), supported by new arrivals from the Orange Free State. The Voortrekkers were roundly defeated by about 7,000 warriors at Ithaleni, southwest of uMgungundlovu. The well-known reluctance of Afrikaner leaders to submit to one another&#x27;s leadership, which later hindered sustained success in the Anglo-Boer Wars, was largely to blame.

In November 1838 Andries Pretorius arrived to assist in the defence. A few days later on 16 December 1838, the trekkers fought against Zulu impis at the Battle of Blood River. Pretorius&#x27;s victory over the Zulu army led to a civil war within the Zulu nation as King Dingane&#x27;s half-brother, Mpande kaSenzangakhona, aligned with the Voortrekkers to overthrow the king and impose himself. Mpande sent 10,000 impis to assist the trekkers in follow-up expeditions against Dingane.

After the defeat of the Zulu forces and the recovery of the treaty between Dingane and Retief from Retief&#x27;s body, the Voortrekkers proclaimed the Natalia Republic. After Dingane&#x27;s death, Mpande was proclaimed king, and the Zulu nation allied with the short-lived Natalia Republic until its annexation by the British Empire in 1843.

The Voortrekkers&#x27; guns offered them a technological advantage over the Zulu&#x27;s traditional weaponry of short stabbing spears, fighting sticks, and cattle-hide shields. The Boers attributed their victory to a vow they made to God before the battle: if victorious, they and future generations would commemorate the day as a &quot;Sabbath&quot;. Thereafter, 16 December was celebrated by Boers as a public holiday, first called Dingane&#x27;s Day, later changed to the Day of the Vow. Post-apartheid, the name was changed to the Day of Reconciliation by the South African government, in order to foster reconciliation between all South Africans.

== Impact ==

Conflict amongst the Voortrekkers was a problem because the trek levelled out the pre-existing class hierarchy which had previously enforced discipline, and thus social cohesion broke down. Instead the trek leaders became more reliant on patriarchal family structure and military reputation to maintain control over their parties. This had a large and lasting impact on Afrikaans culture and society.

===Centenary celebrations===

The celebration of the Great Trek in the 1930s played a major role in the growth of Afrikaans nationalism. It is thought that the experiences of the Second Boer War and the following period, between 1906 and 1934, of a lack of public discussion about the war within the Afrikaans community helped set the scene for a large increase in interest in Afrikaans national identity. The celebration of the centenary of the Great Trek along with a new generation of Afrikaners interested in learning about the Afrikaans experiences of the Boer War catalysed a surge of Afrikaans nationalism.

The centenary celebrations began with a re-enactment of the trek beginning on 8 August 1938 with nine ox wagons at the statue of Jan van Riebeeck in Cape Town and ended at the newly completed Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria and attended by over 100,000 people. A second re-enactment trek starting at the same time and place ended at the scene of the Battle of Blood River.

The commemoration sparked mass enthusiasm amongst Afrikaners as the re-enactment trek passed through the small towns and cities of South Africa. Both participants and spectators participated by dressing in Voortrekker clothing, renaming streets, holding ceremonies, erecting monuments, and laying wreaths at the graves of Afrikaner heroes. Cooking meals over an open fire in the same way the Voortrekkers did became fashionable amongst urbanites, giving birth to the South African tradition of braaing. An Afrikaans language epic called &quot;Building a Nation&quot; () was made in 1938 to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the Great Trek. The film tells the Afrikaans version of the history of South Africa from 1652 to 1910 with a focus on the Great Trek.

A number of Afrikaans organisations such as the and continued to promote the centenary&#x27;s goals of furthering the Afrikaner cause and entrenching a greater sense of unity and solidarity within the community well into the 20th century.

==== Political impact ====
The Great Trek was used by Afrikaner nationalists as a core symbol of a common Afrikaans history. It was used to promote the idea of an Afrikaans nation and a narrative that promoted the ideals of the National Party. In 1938, celebrations of the centenary of the Battle of Blood River and the Great Trek mobilised behind an Afrikaans nationalist theses. The narrative of Afrikaner nationalism was a significant reason for the National Party&#x27;s victory in the 1948 elections. A year later the Voortrekker Monument was completed and opened in Pretoria by the newly elected South African Prime Minister and National Party member Daniel Malan in 1949.

A few years later, &quot; (&#x27;The Voice of South Africa&#x27;), a poem written by Cornelis Jacobus Langenhoven referring to the Great Trek, was chosen to be the words of the pre-1994 South African national anthem. The post-1997 national anthem of South Africa incorporates a section of &quot; but it was decided to omit the section in &quot;reference to the Great Trek (&quot;), since this was the experience of only one section of our community&quot;. When apartheid in South Africa ended and the country transitioned to majority rule, President de Klerk invoked the measures as a new Great Trek.

<text>Alamut (, meaning &quot;eagle&#x27;s nest&quot;) is a ruined mountain fortress located in the Alamut region in the South Caspian, near the village of Gazor Khan in Qazvin Province in Iran, approximately 200 km (130 mi) from present-day Tehran.

In 1090 AD, the Alamut Castle, a mountain fortress in present-day Iran, came into the possession of Hassan-i Sabbah, a champion of the Nizari Ismaili cause. Until 1256, Alamut functioned as the headquarters of the Nizari Ismaili state, which included a series of strategic strongholds scattered throughout Persia and Syria, with each stronghold being surrounded by swathes of hostile territory.

Alamut, which is the most famous of these strongholds, was thought impregnable to any military attack and was fabled for its heavenly gardens, library, and laboratories where philosophers, scientists, and theologians could debate in intellectual freedom.

The stronghold survived adversaries including the Seljuq and Khwarezmian empires. In 1256, Rukn al-Din Khurshah surrendered the fortress to the invading Mongols, who dismantled it and destroyed its famous library holdings. Though commonly assumed that the Mongol conquest obliterated the Nizari Ismailis presence at Alamut, the fortress was recaptured in 1275 by Nizari forces, demonstrating that while the destruction and damage to the Ismailis in that region was extensive, it was not the complete annihilation attempted by the Mongols. However, the castle was seized once again and fell under the rule of Hulagu Khan’s eldest son in 1282. Afterward, the castle was of only regional significance, passing through the hands of various local powers.

Today, it lies in ruins.

==Origins and name==

The Alamut castle was built by the Justanid ruler of Daylam, Wahsūdān ibn Marzubān, a follower of Zaydi Shi&#x27;ism, around 840 AD. During a hunting trip, he witnessed a soaring eagle perch down high on a rock. Realizing the tactical advantage of this location, he chose the site for the construction of a fortress, which was called &quot;Aluh āmū[kh]t&quot; () by the natives, likely meaning &quot;Eagle&#x27;s Teaching&quot; or &quot;Nest of Punishment&quot;. The &quot;abjad&quot; numerical value of this word is 483, which is the date of the castle&#x27;s capture by Hassan-i Sabbah (483 AH = 1090/91 AD). Alamut remained under Justanid control until the arrival of the Isma&#x27;ili chief &quot;da’i&quot; (missionary) Hassan-i Sabbah to the castle in 1090 AD, marking the start of the Alamut period in Nizari Isma&#x27;ili history.

==History==

Following his expulsion from Egypt over his support for Nizar ibn al-Mustansir, Hassan-i Sabbah found that his co-religionists, the Isma&#x27;ilis, were scattered throughout Persia, with a strong presence in the northern and eastern regions, particularly in Daylaman, Khorasan and Quhistan. The Ismailis and other occupied peoples of Iran held shared resentment for the ruling Seljuqs, who had divided the country&#x27;s farmland into &quot;iqtā’&quot; (fiefs) and levied heavy taxes upon the citizens living therein. The Seljuq &quot;amirs&quot; (independent rulers) usually held full jurisdiction and control over the districts they administered. Meanwhile, Persian artisans, craftsmen and lower classes grew increasingly dissatisfied with the Seljuq policies and heavy taxes. Hassan too, was appalled by the political and economic oppression imposed by the Sunni Seljuq ruling class on Shi&#x27;i Muslims living across Iran. 

===Capture of Alamut===

By 1090 AD, the Seljuq vizier Nizam al-Mulk had already given orders for Hassan&#x27;s arrest and therefore Hassan was living in hiding in the northern town of Qazvin, approximately 60 km from the Alamut castle. There, he made plans for the capture of the fortress, which was surrounded by a fertile valley whose inhabitants were mainly fellow Shi’i Muslims, the support of whom Hassan could easily gather for the revolt against the Seljuqs. The castle had never before been captured by military means and thus Hassan planned meticulously. 

In the summer of 1090 AD, Hassan set out from Qazvin towards Alamut on a mountainous route through Andej. He remained at Andej disguised as a schoolteacher named Dehkhoda until he was certain that a number of his supporters had settled directly below the castle in the village of Gazorkhan or had gained employment at the fortress itself. Still in disguise, Hassan made his way into the fortress, earning the trust and friendship of many of its soldiers. Careful not to attract the attention of the castle&#x27;s Zaydi ‘Alid lord, Mahdi, Hassan began to attract prominent figures at Alamut to his mission. It has even been suggested that Mahdi&#x27;s own deputy was a secret supporter of Hassan, waiting to demonstrate his loyalty on the day that Hassan would ultimately take the castle.

Earlier in the summer, Mahdi visited Qazvin, where he received strict orders from Nizam al-Mulk to find and arrest Hassan who was said to be hiding in the province of Daylaman. Upon his return to the Alamut fortress, Mahdi noticed several new servants and guards employed there. His deputy explained that illness had taken many of the castle&#x27;s workers and it was fortunate that other labourers were found from the neighbouring villages. Worried about the associations of these workers, Mahdi ordered his deputy to arrest anyone with connections to the Ismailis.

Mahdi&#x27;s suspicions were confirmed when Hassan finally approached the lord of the fortress, revealing his true identity and declared that the castle now belonged to him. Immediately, Mahdi called upon the guards to arrest and remove Hassan from the castle, only to find them prepared to follow Hassan&#x27;s every command. Astounded, he realized he had been tricked and was allowed to exit the castle freely. Before leaving however, Mahdi was given a draft of 3000 gold dinars as payment for the fortress, payable by a Seljuq officer in service to the Isma&#x27;ili cause named Ra’is Muzaffar who honoured the payment in full. The Alamut fortress was captured from Mahdi and therefore from Seljuq control by Hassan and his supporters without resorting to any violence.

===Construction and intellectual development===

With Alamut now in his possession, Hassan swiftly embarked on a complete re-fortification of the complex. By enhancing the walls and structure of a series of storage facilities, the fortress was to act as a self-sustaining stronghold during major confrontations. The perimeters of the rooms were lined with limestone, so as to preserve provisions to be used in times of crisis. Indeed, when the Mongols invaded the fortress, Juvayni was astonished to see stored countless supplies in perfect condition to withstand a possible siege.

Next, Hassan took on the task of irrigating the surrounding villages of the Alamut valley. The land at valley&#x27;s floor was arable land, allowing for the cultivation of dry crops including barley, wheat and rice. In order to make available the maximum amount of cultivable land, the ground was terraced under Hassan&#x27;s direction. 

The construction of Alamut&#x27;s famous library likely occurred after Hassan&#x27;s fortification of the castle and its surrounding valley. With its astronomical instruments and rare collection of works, the library attracted scholars and scientists of a variety of religious persuasions from around the world who visited it for many months at a time, hosted by the Isma&#x27;ilis. By and large the writings of the Persian Ismailis, both scientific and doctrinal, did not survive beyond the Alamut period. In addition to the rich literature they had already produced in Arabic, the relocation of the Ismaili center to Iran now prompted a surge in Persian Ismaili literature.

One of the earliest losses of the library came during the early years of the Imam Jalal al-Din Hasan’s leadership at Alamut. In keeping with his principles of bridging the gaping relations between the Persian Ismailis and the broader Sunni world, Imam Jalal al-Din Hasan invited a number of religious scholars from the town of Qazvin to visit the castle&#x27;s library and burn any books they deemed heretical. However, it was not until under the direction of the Mongol ruler, Hulegu Khan, when the Mongols ascended to the fortress in December 1256 AD, that the Alamut library was lost. With the permission of Hulegu, Juvayni explored the library and selected a few works he deemed worthy of salvaging, before the remainder was set aflame. His choice items included copies of the Qur&#x27;an, a number of astronomical instruments and treatises, and a number of Ismaili works. An anti-Ismaili, Ata-Malik Juvayni&#x27;s personal leanings were the sole measure of heretical content of the library&#x27;s doctrinal works. Thus, some of the richest treatises regarding the tenets of Ismaili faith were lost with his destruction of the library. From his tour and survey of the castle, Juvayni compiled a description of Alamut that he incorporated into his chronicle of the Mongol invasions, entitled &quot;Tarikh-i Jahangushay-i Juvaini&quot; (&quot;The History of the World Conqueror&quot;).

===Concealment and emergence: Imamat at Alamut===
With the death of Hassan-i Sabbah in 1124 AD, the Alamut fortress was now in the command of the &quot;da’i&quot; Kiya Buzurg Ummid, under whose direction Ismaili-Seljuq relations improved. However, this was not without a test of the strength of Buzurg Ummid&#x27;s command, and consequently the Seljuks began an offensive in 1126 AD on the Isma&#x27;ili strongholds of Rudbar and Quhistan. Only after these assaults failed did the Seljuq sultan Ahmad Sanjar concede to recognise the independence of the Isma&#x27;ili territories.

Accordingly, Muḥammad succeeded Kiya Buzurg Ummid in 1138 AD. Though they expected some resistance to his rule, the fragmented Seljuks were met with continued solidarity amongst the Ismailis, who remained unified under Muhammad&#x27;s command. The early part of Muhammad&#x27;s rule saw a continued low level of conflict, enabling the Nizaris to acquire and construct a number of fortresses in the Qumis and Rudbar regions, including the castles of Sa’adat-kuh, Mubarak-kuh, and Firuz-kuh.

===Imam Hasan ‘ala Dhikrihi al-Salam===

Taken by illness in 1162 AD, Muhammad was succeeded by Hasan, who was then about thirty-five years of age. Only two years after his accession, the Imam Hasan, apparently conducted a ceremony known as &quot;qiyama&quot; (resurrection) at the grounds of the castle of Alamut, whereby the Imam would once again become visible to his community of followers in and outside of the Nizārī Ismā&#x27;īlī state. Given Juvayni&#x27;s polemical aims, and the fact that he burned the Ismā&#x27;īlī libraries which may have offered much more reliable testimony about the history, scholars have been dubious about his narrative but are forced to rely on it given the absence of alternative sources. Fortunately, descriptions of this event are also preserved in Rashid al-Din’s narrative and recounted in the Haft Bab-i Abi Ishaq, an Ismaili book of the 15th century AD. However, these are either based on Juvayni, or don&#x27;t go into great detail. No contemporary Ismaili account of the events has survived.

===Ismaili version of the Alamut history===
What little we know about the Imamate at Alamut is narrated to us by one of the greatest detractors of the Ismailis, Juvayni. A Sunni Muslim scholar, Juvayni was serving Mongol patrons. While he then could not openly celebrate the Mongol victories over other Muslim rulers, the Mongol victory over the Nizari Ismailis, who Juvayni considered heretics and “as vile as dogs” became the focus of his work about Mongol invasions.

According to the Ismaili version of the events, in the year following the death of the Imam-Caliph al-Mustansir, a &quot;qadi&quot; (judge) by the name of Abul Hasan Sa&#x27;idi travelled from Egypt to Alamut, taking with him Imam Nizar’s youngest son, who was known as al-Hadi.

===Imam Nur al-Din Muhammad===

Succeeding Hasan &#x27;ala dhikri al-salam in 1166, was the Imam Nūr al-Dīn Muhammad II, who, like his father and the imams of the pre-Alamut period, openly declared himself to his followers. 

===Imam Jalal al-Din Hasan===

Within Persia, the Nizaris of the qiyama period largely disregarded their former political endeavours and became considerably isolated from the surrounding Sunni world. The death of Muhammad II however, ushered in a new era for the Nizaris, under the direction of the next Imam Jalal al-din Hasan. Imam Jalal al-Din Hasan invited Sunni scholars and jurists from across Khurasan and Iraq to visit Alamut, and even invited them to inspect the library and remove any books they found to be objectionable. During his lifetime, the Imam Jalal al-Din Hasan maintained friendly relations with the `Abbasid Caliph al-Nasir. An alliance with the caliph of Baghdad meant greater resources for the self-defence of not only the Nizari Ismaili state, but also the broader Muslim world.

===Imam Ala al-Din Muhammad===
After his death in 1221, Imam Jalal al-Din Hasan was succeeded by his son ‘Ala al-Din Muhammad. Ascending to the throne at only nine years of age, Imam &#x27;Ala al-Din Muhammad continued his father&#x27;s policy of maintaining close relations with the Abbasid caliph. Under the leadership of Imam &#x27;Ala al-Din Muhammad, the need for an Imam to constantly guide the community according to the demands of the times was emphasized. Intellectual life and scholarship flourished under the rule of Imam &#x27;Ala al-Din Muhammad. The Nizari libraries were invigorated with scholars from across Asia, fleeing from the invading Mongols. 

===Imam Rukn al-Din Khurshah===

By the time of Imam &#x27;Ala al-Din Muhammad&#x27;s murder in 1255, the Mongols had already attacked a number of the Ismaili strongholds in Quhistan. Imam &#x27;Ala al-Din Muhammad was succeeded by his eldest son Imam Rukn al-Din Khurshah who engaged in a long series of negotiations with invading Mongols, and under whose leadership, the Alamut castle was surrendered to the Mongols.

===The Mongol invasion and collapse of the Nizari Ismaili state===
The expansion of Mongol power across Western Asia depended upon the conquest of the Islamic lands, the complete seizure of which would be impossible without dismantling the ardent Nizari Ismaili state.

The first Mongol attack on the Ismailis came in April 1253 AD, when many of the Quhistani fortresses were lost to the Christian Mongol general Ket-Buqa. By May, the Mongol troops had proceeded to the fortress of Girdkuh where Ismaili forces held ground for several months. In December, a cholera outbreak within the castle weakened the Ismaili defences. Reinforcements quickly arrived from the neighbouring Alamut fortress and thwarted the attacking Mongols, killing several hundred of Ket-Buqa&#x27;s troops. The castle was saved but the subsequent Mongol assaults on the towns of Tun and Tus resulted in massacres. Across Khurasan the Mongols imposed tyrannical laws and were responsible for the mass displacement of the province&#x27;s population.

After the massacres at Tun in 1256 AD, Hulegu became directly involved in the Mongol campaign to eliminate the Ismaili centres of power. From a lavish tent erected for him at Tus, Hulegu summoned the Ismaili governor at Quhistan, Nasir al-Din Muhtasham and demanded the surrender of all fortresses in his province. Nasir al-Din explained that submission could only come at the Imam&#x27;s orders and that he, as governor, was powerless to seek the Ismailis&#x27; compliance.

Meanwhile, Imam ‘Ala al-Din Mohammad, who had been murdered, was succeeded by his son Rukn al-Din Khurshah in 1255 AD. In 1256 AD, Rukn al-Din commenced a series of gestures demonstrating his submission to the Mongols. In a show of his compliance and at the demand of Hulegu, Rukn al-Din began the dismantling process at Alamut, Maymundiz and Lamasar, removing towers and battlements. However, as winter approached, Hulegu took these gestures to be a means of delaying his seizure of the castles and on November 8, 1256, the Mongol troops quickly encircled the Maymundiz fortress and residence of the Imam. After four days of preliminary bombardment with significant casualties for both sides, the Mongols assembled their mangonels around the castle in preparation for a direct siege. There was still no snow on the ground and the attacks proceeded, forcing Rukn al-Din to declare his surrender in exchange for his and his family&#x27;s safe passage.

In the hands of Hulegu, Rukn al-Din was forced to send the message of surrender to all the castles in the Alamut valley. At the Alamut fortress, the Mongol Prince Balaghai led his troops to the base of the castle, calling for the surrender of the commander of Alamut, Muqaddam al-Din. It was decreed that should he surrender and pledge his allegiance to the Great Khan within one day, the lives of those at Alamut would be spared. Maymundiz was reluctant and wondered if the Imam&#x27;s message of surrender was an actually act of duress. In obedience to the Imam, Muqaddam and his men descended from the fortress, and the Mongol army entered Alamut and began its demolition.

Compared with Maymundiz, the Alamut fortress was far better fortified and could have long withstood the assaults of the Mongol army. However, the castle was relatively small in size and was easily surrounded by the Mongols. Still, the most significant factor in determining the defeat of the Ismailis at Alamut was the command by the Imam for the surrender of the castles in the valley. Many of the other fortresses had already complied, therefore not only would Muqaddam&#x27;s resistance have resulted in a direct battle for the castle, but the explicit violation of the instructions of the Imam, which would impact significantly on the Ismaili commander&#x27;s oath of total obedience to the Imam.

The conquest of the Ismaili castles was critical to the Mongol&#x27;s political and territorial expansion westward. However, it was depicted by Juvayni as a &quot;matter of divine punishment upon the heretics [at] the nest of Satan&quot;. Juvayni&#x27;s depiction of the fall of the Nizari Ismaili state reveals the religious leanings of the anti-Ismaili historian. When Rukn al-Din arrived in Mongolia with promises to persuade the prevailing Ismaili fortresses to surrender, the Great Khan Mongke no longer believed the Imam to be of use. En route back to his homeland, Rukn al-Din was put to death. In his description of this, Juvayni concludes that the Imam&#x27;s murder cleansed &quot;the world which had been polluted by their evil&quot;. Subsequently, in Quhistan, the Ismailis were called by thousands to attend large gatherings, where they were massacred. While some escaped to neighbouring regions, the Ismailis who perished in the massacres following the capture of the Ismaili garrisons numbered nearly 100,000.

According to Ata-Malik Juvayni during the assault on the Alamut fort, &quot;Khitayan&quot; built siege weapons resembling crossbows were used. &quot;Khitayan&quot; meant Chinese and it was a type of arcuballista, deployed in 1256 under Hulagu&#x27;s command. Stones were knocked off the castle and the bolts &quot;burnt&quot; a great number of the Assassins. They could fire a distance around 2,500 paces. The device was described as an &quot;ox&#x27;s bow&quot;. Pitch which was lit on fire was applied to the bolts of the weapon before firing. Another historian thinks that instead gunpowder might have been strapped onto the bolts which caused the burns during the battle recorded by Juvayini.

===After the Mongol invasion===

It was assumed that with the initial siege of the Alamut Castle in 1256 the Nizari Ismaili presence in the area would have been obliterated. Though the damage was extensive, Nizari forces were able to recapture the Castle in 1275.

Evidence of another wave of destruction in the Safavid period has been found by archaeological studies in 2004 led by Hamideh Chubak. Further evidence suggests another Afghan attack on the castle.

==Defense and military tactics==

The natural geographical features of the valley surrounding Alamut largely secured the castle&#x27;s defence. Positioned atop a narrow rock base approximately 180 m above ground level, the fortress could not be taken by direct military force. To the east, the Alamut valley is bordered by a mountainous range called Alamkuh &quot;(The Throne of Solomon)&quot; between which the Alamut River flows. The valley&#x27;s western entrance is a narrow one, shielded by cliffs over 350 m high. Known as the Shirkuh, the gorge sits at the intersection of three rivers: the Taliqan, Shahrud and Alamut River. For much of the year, the raging waters of the river made this entrance nearly inaccessible. Qazvin, the closest town to the valley by land can only be reached by an underdeveloped mule track upon which an enemy&#x27;s presence could easily be detected given the dust clouds arising from their passage.

The military approach of the Nizari Ismaili state was largely a defensive one, with strategically chosen sites that appeared to avoid confrontation wherever possible without the loss of life. The defining characteristic of the Nizari Ismaili state was that it was scattered geographically throughout Persia and Syria. The Alamut castle therefore was only one of a nexus of strongholds throughout the regions where Ismailis could retreat to safety if necessary. West of Alamut in the Shahrud Valley, the major fortress of Lamasar served as just one example of such a retreat. In the context of their political uprising, the various spaces of Ismaili military presence took on the name &quot;dar al-hijra&quot; (place of refuge). The notion of the &quot;dar al-hijra&quot; refers to the hijrah of the Prophet Muhammad, who migrated to Yathrib with his supporters to avoid the hostility of the Quraysh. 

In pursuit of their religious and political goals, the Ismailis adopted various military strategies popular in the Middle Ages. One such method was that of assassination, the selective elimination of prominent rival figures. The murders of political adversaries were usually carried out in public spaces, creating resounding intimidation for other possible enemies. Throughout history, many groups have resorted to assassination as a means of achieving political ends. In the Ismaili context, these assignments were performed by &quot;fidā’īs&quot; (devotees) of the Ismaili mission. They were unique in that civilians were never targeted. The assassinations were against those whose elimination would most greatly reduce aggression against the Ismailis and, in particular, against those who had perpetrated massacres against the community. A single assassination was usually employed in favour of widespread bloodshed resultant from factional combat. The first instance of assassination in the effort to establish an Nizari Ismaili state in Persia is widely considered to be the murder of Seljuq vizier, Nizam al-Mulk. Carried out by a man dressed as a Sufi whose identity remains unclear, the vizier&#x27;s murder in a Seljuq court is distinctive of exactly the type of visibility for which missions of the fida’is have been significantly exaggerated. While the Seljuqs and Crusaders both employed assassination as a military means of disposing of factional enemies, during the Alamut period almost any murder of political significance in the Islamic lands was attributed to the Ismailis, whence they came to be known as the &quot;Assassins&quot;.

==Legend and folklore==

During the medieval period, Western scholarship on the Ismailis contributed to the popular view of the community as a radical sect of assassins, believed to be trained for the precise murder of their adversaries. By the 14th century AD, European scholarship on the topic had not advanced much beyond the work and tales from the Crusaders. The origins of the word forgotten, across Europe the term &quot;assassin&quot; had taken the meaning of &quot;professional murderer&quot;. In 1603 the first Western publication on the topic of the Assassins was authored by a court official for King Henry IV and was mainly based on the narratives of Marco Polo (1254–1324) from his visits to the Near East. While he assembled the accounts of many Western travelers, the author failed to explain the etymology of the term Assassin.

The infamous Assassins were finally linked by orientalists scholar Silvestre de Sacy (d.1838) to the Arabic &quot;hashish&quot; using their variant names &quot;assassini&quot; and assissini in the 19th century. Citing the example of one of the first written applications of the Arabic term &quot;hashishi&quot; to the Ismailis by historian Abu Shams (d.1267), de Sacy demonstrated its connection to the name given to the Ismailis throughout Western scholarship. Ironically, the first known usage of the term &quot;hashishi&quot; has been traced back to 1122 AD, when the Fatimid Caliph al-Amir employed it in derogatory reference to the Syrian Nizaris. Without accusing the group of utilizing the hashish drug, the caliph used the term in a pejorative manner. This label was quickly applied by anti-Ismaili historians to the Ismailis of Syria and Persia. Used figuratively, the term &quot;hashishi&quot; connoted meanings such as outcasts or rabble. 

The legends of the Assassins had much to do with the training and instruction of Nizari &quot;fida’is&quot;, famed for their public missions during which they often gave their lives to eliminate adversaries. From the Crusader accounts and the works of historians have contributed to the tales of &quot;fida’is&quot; being fed with hashish as part of their training. Whether &quot;fida’is&quot; were actually trained or dispatched by Nizari leaders is unconfirmed, but scholars including Wladimir Ivanow purport that the assassination of key figures including Seljuq vizier Nizam al-Mulk likely provided encouraging impetus to others in the community who sought to secure the Nizaris from political aggression. In fact, the Seljuqs and Crusaders both employed assassination as a military means of disposing of factional enemies. Yet during the Alamut period almost any murder of political significance in the Islamic lands became attributed to the Ismailis. So inflated had this association grown, that in the work of Orientalist scholars such as Bernard Lewis the Ismailis were virtually equated to the politically active &quot;fida’is&quot;. Thus the Nizari Ismaili community was regarded as a radical and heretical sect known as the Assassins. Originally, a &quot;local and popular term&quot; first applied to the Ismailis of Syria, the label was orally transmitted to Western historians and thus found itself in their histories of the Nizaris.

The tales of the &quot;fida’is&quot;’ training collected from anti-Ismaili historians and orientalists writers were confounded and compiled in Marco Polo’s account, in which he described a &quot;secret garden of paradise&quot;. After being drugged, the Ismaili devotees were said be taken to a paradise-like garden filled with attractive young maidens and beautiful plants in which these &quot;fida’is&quot; would awaken. Here, they were told by an &quot;old&quot; man that they were witnessing their place in Paradise and that should they wish to return to this garden permanently, they must serve the Nizari cause. So went the tale of the &quot;Old Man in the Mountain&quot;, assembled by Marco Polo and accepted by Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall (1774–1856), a prominent orientalist writer responsible for much of the spread of this legend. Until the 1930s, Hammer-Purgstall&#x27;s retelling of the Assassin legends served across Europe as the standard account of the Nizaris.

Modern works on the Nizaris have elucidated the history of the Nizaris and in doing so, showed that much of the earlier popular history was inaccurate. In 1933, under the direction of the Imam Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan III (1877–1957), the Islamic Research Association was developed. Prominent historian Wladimir Ivanow, was central to both this institution and the 1946 Ismaili Society of Bombay. Cataloguing a number of Ismaili texts, Ivanow provided the ground for great strides in modern Ismaili scholarship.

In 2005, the archaeologist Peter Willey published evidence suggesting that the Assassin histories of earlier scholars were simply repeating inaccurate folklore. Drawing on its established esoteric doctrine, Willey asserts that the Ismaili understanding of Paradise is a deeply symbolic one. While the Qur&#x27;anic description of Heaven includes natural imagery, Willey argues that no Nizari &quot;fida’i&quot; would seriously believe that he was witnessing Paradise simply by awakening in a beauteous garden. The Nizaris&#x27; symbolic interpretation of the Qur&#x27;anic description of Paradise serves as evidence against the possibility of such an exotic garden having been used as motivation for the devotees to carry out suicidal missions. Furthermore, Willey points out that Juvayni, the courtier of the Great Khan Mongke, surveyed the Alamut castle just before the Mongol invasion. In Juvayni&#x27;s reports about of the fortress, there are elaborate descriptions of sophisticated storage facilities and of the famous Alamut library. However, even this anti-Ismaili observer makes no mention of the folkloric gardens on the Alamut grounds. Having destroyed a number of texts of the library&#x27;s collection, deemed by Juvayni to be heretical, it would be expected that he would have paid significant attention to the Nizari gardens, particularly if they were the site of drug use and temptation. Given that Juvayni makes no mention of all about such gardens, Willey concludes that there is no sound evidence that the gardens are anything more than legends. A reference collection of material excavated at Alamut Castle by Willey is in the British Museum.

<text>Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (19 April 1795 – 27 June 1876) was a German naturalist, zoologist, botanist, comparative anatomist, geologist, and microscopist. He is considered to be one of the most famous and productive scientists of his time.

== Early collections ==
The son of a judge, Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg was born in Delitzsch, near Leipzig. He first studied theology at the University of Leipzig, then medicine and natural sciences in Berlin and became a friend of the famous explorer Alexander von Humboldt. In 1818, he completed his doctoral dissertation on fungi, &quot;Sylvae mycologicae Berolinenses.&quot;

In 1820–1825, on a scientific expedition to the Middle East with his friend Wilhelm Hemprich, he collected thousands of specimens of plants and animals. He investigated parts of Egypt, the Libyan Desert, the Nile valley and the northern coasts of the Red Sea, where he made a special study of the corals. Subsequently, parts of Syria, Arabia and Abyssinia were examined. Some results of these travels and of the important collections that had been made were reported on by Humboldt in 1826. While in Sudan he designed the mansion of the local governor of Dongola, Abidin Bey.

After his return, Ehrenberg published several papers on insects and corals and two volumes &quot;Symbolae physicae&quot; (1828–1834), in which many particulars of the mammals, birds, insects, etc., were made public. Other observations were communicated to scientific societies.

== Focus on microscopic organisms ==
Ehrenberg was appointed professor of medicine at Berlin University in 1827. In 1829 he accompanied Humboldt through eastern Russia to the Chinese frontier. After his return he began to concentrate his studies on microscopic organisms, which until then had not been systematically studied.

For nearly 30 years Ehrenberg examined samples of water, soil, sediment, blowing dust and rock and described thousands of new species, among them well-known flagellates such as &quot;Euglena&quot;, ciliates such as &quot;Paramecium aurelia&quot; and &quot;Paramecium caudatum,&quot; and many fossils, in nearly 400 scientific publications. He was particularly interested in a unicellular group of protists called diatoms, but he also studied, and named, many species of radiolaria, foraminifera and dinoflagellates.

This research had an important bearing on some of the infusorial earths used for polishing and other economic purposes; they added, moreover, largely to our knowledge of the microorganisms of certain geological formations, especially of the chalk, and of the marine and freshwater accumulations. Until Ehrenberg took up the study it was not known that considerable masses of rock were composed of minute forms of animals or plants. He also demonstrated that the phosphorescence of the sea was due to organisms.

He was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences from 1836 and a foreign member of the Royal Society of London from 1837. In 1839, he won the Wollaston Medal, the highest award granted by the Geological Society of London. Ehrenberg was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849. He continued until late in life to investigate the microscopic organisms of the deep sea and of various geological formations. He died in Berlin on 27 June 1876.

== Legacy ==
After his death in 1876, his collections of microscopic organisms were deposited in the Berlin&#x27;s Natural History Museum (this museum was a part of the University of Berlin until it left the university in 2009). The &quot;Ehrenberg Collection&quot; includes 40,000 microscope preparations, 5,000 raw samples, 3,000 pencil and ink drawings, and nearly 1,000 letters of correspondence. His collection of scorpions, and other arachnids from the Middle East, is also held in the Berlin Museum. Many herbaria around the world also hold botanical collections made by Ehrenberg, including the National Herbarium of Victoria at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, the National Museum of Natural History, France and the herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

He was also the first winner of the Leeuwenhoek Medal in 1877.

In his hometown, Delitzsch, the highest A-Level school, the &quot;Ehrenberg-Gymnasium&quot; is named after him. The best student of the school year receives the Ehrenberg Prize and a scholarship.

Ehrenberg Island in the Svalbard archipelago is named after Ehrenberg.

In 1998 the Linnean Society of London dedicated a special issue to &quot;Christian Gottfried Ehrenburg (1795–1876) The man and his legacy&quot;.

== Family ==
Christian Ehrenberg was the son of Johann Gottfried Ehrenberg (1757–1826) and his wife Christiane Dorothea Becker (1769–1808). His brother Carl August Ehrenberg (1801–1849) became a botanist and plant collector.
After attending the same expedition (as part of Humboldt&#x27;s team) with Gustav Rose, (who was the brother of Heinrich Rose), Ehrenberg married Gustav&#x27;s cousin Julie Rose (1804–1848). After their first son died in infancy they had four daughters: Helene (* 1834), Mathilde (1835–1890), Laura (*1836) and Clara Ehrenberg (1838–1916). His youngest daughter Clara Ehrenberg was his assistant for over twelve years. She aided his scientific research, organised and indexed his collections and correspondence, and prepared a taxonomic reference book. Clara was also a published scientific illustrator.
Helene married the botanist Johannes von Hanstein and Mathilde married the mineralogist Karl Friedrich August Rammelsberg.

In 1852 Ehrenberg married his second wife, Karoline Friederike Friccius (1812–95), who was related to the chemist Eilhard Mitscherlich. The couple had one son, Hermann Alexander Ehernberg.

<doc id="205012" wikidata="Q156849" url="?curid=205012" title="Sewerage">
<text>Sewerage (or sewage system) is the infrastructure that conveys sewage or surface runoff (stormwater, meltwater, rainwater) using sewers. It encompasses components such as receiving drains, manholes, pumping stations, storm overflows, and screening chambers of the combined sewer or sanitary sewer. Sewerage ends at the entry to a sewage treatment plant or at the point of discharge into the environment. It is the system of pipes, chambers, manholes or inspection chamber, etc. that conveys the sewage or storm water.

In many cities, sewage (municipal wastewater or municipal sewage) is carried together with stormwater, in a combined sewer system, to a sewage treatment plant. In some urban areas, sewage is carried separately in sanitary sewers and runoff from streets is carried in storm drains. Access to these systems, for maintenance purposes, is typically through a manhole. During high precipitation periods a sewer system may experience a combined sewer overflow event or a sanitary sewer overflow event, which forces untreated sewage to flow directly to receiving waters. This can pose a serious threat to public health and the surrounding environment.

The system of sewers is called &quot;sewerage&quot; or &quot;sewerage system&quot; in British English and &quot;sewage system&quot; or &quot;sewer system&quot; in American English.

==History==
It was probably the need to get rid of foul smells rather than an understanding of the health hazards of human waste that led to the first proper sewage systems. Most settlements grew next to natural waterways into which waste from latrines was readily channeled, but the emergence of major cities exposed the inadequacy of this approach. Early civilizations like the Babylonians dug cesspits below floor level in their houses and created crude drainage systems for removing storm water. But it was not until 2000 BC in the Indus valley civilization that networks of precisely made brick-lined sewage drains were constructed along the streets to convey waste from homes. Toilets in homes on the street side were connected directly to these street sewers and were flushed manually with clean water. Centuries later, major cities such as Rome and Constantinople built increasingly complex networked sewer systems, some of which are still in use. It was after the construction of the sewer systems that people realized the reduction of health hazards.

== Components and types ==

The main part of such a system is made up of large pipes (i.e. the sewers, or &quot;sanitary sewers&quot;) that convey the sewage from the point of production to the point of treatment or discharge.

Types of sanitary sewer systems that all usually are gravity sewers include:
* Combined sewer
* Simplified sewerage
* Storm drain

Sanitary sewers not relying solely on gravity include:
* Vacuum sewer
* Effluent sewer
Where a sewerage system has not been installed, sewage may be collected from homes by pipes into septic tanks or cesspits, where it may be treated or collected in vehicles and taken for treatment or disposal (a process known as fecal sludge management).

== Maintenance and rehabilitation ==
Severe constraints are applied to sewerage, which may result in premature deterioration. These include root intrusion, joint displacement, cracks, and hole formations that lead to a significant volume of leakage with an overall risk for the environment and public health. For example, it is estimated that 500 million m3 of contaminated water per year can leak into soil and ground-water in Germany. The rehabilitation and replacement of damaged sewers is very costly. Annual rehabilitation costs for Los Angeles County are about €400 million, and in Germany, these costs are estimated to be €100 million.
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is indirectly responsible for biogenic sulfide corrosion and consequently, sewers need rehabilitation work. Various repair options are available to owners over a large range of costs and potential durability. One option is the application of a cementitious material based on calcium aluminate cement, after a cleaning of the corroded structure to remove loose material and contaminants in order to expose a sound, rough and clean substrate. Depending on the concrete condition and contamination, the cleaning can range from simple high pressure jet water cleaning (200 bar) up to real hydro-demolition (2000 bars).

One method to ensure sound concrete is exposed is to verify that the surface pH is superior to 10.

As for any concrete repair, the state-of-the-art rules must be followed. After this cleaning step, the cementitious material is applied to the saturated-surface-dry substrate using either:
* Low pressure wet spray: this method is the more common because it does not produce dust and virtually no material is lost by rebound. It utilizes classical facade rotor pump, easily available in the market. The main drawback is the limited pumping distance that cannot exceed 75 meters.
* Spinning head wet spray: this method is similar to the first, but the manual spraying is replaced by a spinning head projecting the mortar onto the repaired surface. This method is fast and especially suited for cylindrical chambers such as manholes. When a structure is so severely corroded that human entry is a risk, spinning head application permits an “un-manned” consolidation of the manhole.
* High pressure dry spray: this method, also called “shotcrete” or “gunite” is allowing a faster rate of rehabilitation, and also to make a thicker application in a single pass. The main interest of dry shotcrete is the capacity to pump the mortar over a long distance and this is needed when the access points are distant. Perhaps the longest dry shotcrete distance is a job site in Australia in 2014, where 100% calcium aluminate mortar was air transported over 800 meters before being sprayed. The main drawback with dry shotcrete is the generation of dust and rebound; these could be limited and controlled with appropriate means (pre-moisture ring, adapted aggregate grading, experienced nozzleman, water mist cut-off walls, etc.).

== Challenges ==
=== Water table ===
Sewer system infrastructure often reduces the water table in areas, especially in densely populated areas where rainwater (from house roofs) is directly piped into the system, as opposed to being allowed to be absorbed by the soil. In certain areas it has resulted in a significant lowering of the water table. In the example of Belgium, a lowering of the water table by 100 meters has been the result. The freshwater that is accumulated by the system is then piped to the sea. In areas where this is a concern, vacuum sewers may be used instead, due to the shallow excavation that is possible for them.

=== Lack of infrastructure ===
In many low-income countries, sewage may in some cases drain directly into receiving water bodies without the existence of sewerage systems. This can cause water pollution. Pathogens can cause a variety of illnesses. Some chemicals pose risks even at very low concentrations and can remain a threat for long periods of time because of bioaccumulation in animal or human tissue.

== Regulations ==
In many European countries, citizens are obliged to connect their home sanitation to the national sewerage where possible. This has resulted in large percentages of the population being connected. For example, the Netherlands have 99% of the population connected to the system, and 1% has an individual sewage disposal system or treatment system, e.g., septic tank. Others have slightly lower (although still substantial) percentages; e.g., 96% for Germany.

== Trends ==
Current approaches to sewage management may include handling surface runoff separately from sewage, handling greywater separately from blackwater (flush toilets), and coping better with abnormal events (such as peaks stormwater volumes from extreme weather).

<doc id="205013" wikidata="Q108745" url="?curid=205013" title="Ghostbusters">
<text>Ghostbusters is a 1984 American supernatural comedy film directed by Ivan Reitman and written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. It stars Bill Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis as Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler, three eccentric parapsychologists who start a ghost-catching business in New York City. It also stars Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis, and features Annie Potts, Ernie Hudson, and William Atherton in supporting roles.

Based on his fascination with spirituality, Aykroyd conceived &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; as a project starring himself and John Belushi, in which they would venture through time and space battling supernatural threats. Following Belushi&#x27;s death in 1982, and with Aykroyd&#x27;s concept deemed financially impractical, Ramis was hired to help rewrite the script to set it in New York City and make it more realistic. It was the first comedy film to employ expensive special effects, and Columbia Pictures, concerned about its relatively high $25–30 million budget, had little faith in its box office potential. Filming took place from October 1983 to January 1984, in New York City and Los Angeles. Due to competition for special effects studios among various films in development at the time, Richard Edlund used part of the budget to found Boss Film Studios, which employed a combination of practical effects, miniatures, and puppets to deliver the ghoulish visuals.

&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was released on June 8, 1984, to critical acclaim and became a cultural phenomenon. It was praised for its blend of comedy, action, and horror, and Murray&#x27;s performance was often singled out for praise. It earned at least $282 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run and was the second-highest-grossing film of 1984 in the United States and Canada, and the then-highest-grossing comedy ever. It was the number-one film in US theaters for seven consecutive weeks and one of only four films to gross more than $100 million that year. Further theatrical releases have increased the worldwide total gross to around $370 million, making it one of the most successful comedy films of the 1980s. In 2015, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. Its theme song, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; by Ray Parker Jr., was also a number-one hit.

With its effect on popular culture, and a dedicated fan following, the success of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; launched a multi-billion dollar multimedia franchise. This included the popular animated television series &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; (1986), its follow-up &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot; (1997), video games, board games, comic books, clothing, music, and haunted attractions. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was followed in 1989 by &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;, which fared less well financially and critically, and attempts to develop a second sequel paused in 2014 following Ramis&#x27;s death. After a 2016 reboot received mixed reviews and underperformed financially, a second sequel to the 1984 film, &quot;&quot; (2021), was released, followed by &quot;&quot; (2024).

== Plot ==

After Columbia University parapsychology professors Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler experience their first encounter with a ghost at the New York Public Library, the university dean dismisses the credibility of their paranormal-focused research and fires them. The trio responds by establishing &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, a paranormal investigation and elimination service operating out of a disused firehouse. They develop high-tech nuclear-powered equipment to capture and contain ghosts, although business is initially slow.

Following a paranormal encounter in her apartment, cellist Dana Barrett visits the Ghostbusters. She recounts witnessing a demonic dog-like creature in her refrigerator utter a single word: &quot;Zuul&quot;. Ray and Egon research Zuul and details of Dana&#x27;s building while Peter inspects her apartment and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her. The Ghostbusters are hired to remove a gluttonous ghost from the Sedgewick Hotel. Having failed to properly test their equipment, Egon warns the group that crossing the energy streams of their proton pack weapons could cause a catastrophic explosion. They capture the ghost and deposit it in an ecto-containment unit under the firehouse. Supernatural activity rapidly increases across the city and the Ghostbusters become famous; they hire a fourth member, Winston Zeddemore, to cope with the growing demand.

Suspicious of the Ghostbusters, Environmental Protection Agency inspector Walter Peck asks to evaluate their equipment, but Peter rebuffs him. Egon warns that the containment unit is nearing capacity and supernatural energy is surging across the city. Peter meets with Dana and informs her Zuul was a demigod worshipped as a servant to &quot;Gozer the Gozerian&quot;, a shapeshifting god of destruction. Upon returning home, she is possessed by Zuul; a similar entity possesses her neighbor, Louis Tully. Peter arrives and finds the possessed Dana/Zuul claiming to be &quot;the Gatekeeper&quot;. Louis is brought to Egon by police officers and claims he is &quot;Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster&quot;. The Ghostbusters agree they must keep the pair separated.

Peck returns with law enforcement and city workers to have the Ghostbusters arrested and their containment unit deactivated, causing an explosion that releases the captured ghosts. Louis/Vinz escapes in the confusion and makes his way to the apartment building to join Dana/Zuul. In jail, Ray and Egon reveal that , leader of a Gozer-worshipping cult in the early 20th century, designed Dana&#x27;s building to function as an antenna to attract and concentrate spiritual energy to summon Gozer and bring about the apocalypse. Faced with supernatural chaos across the city, the Ghostbusters convince the mayor to release them.

The Ghostbusters travel to a hidden temple located on top of the building as Dana/Zuul and Louis/Vinz open the gate between dimensions and transform into demonic dogs. Gozer appears as a woman and attacks the Ghostbusters, then disappears when they attempt to retaliate. Her disembodied voice demands the Ghostbusters &quot;choose the form of the destructor&quot;. Ray inadvertently recalls a beloved corporate mascot from his childhood, and Gozer reappears as a gigantic Stay Puft Marshmallow Man that begins destroying the city. Against his earlier advice, Egon instructs the team to cross their proton energy streams at the dimensional gate. The resulting explosion destroys Gozer&#x27;s avatar, banishing it back to its dimension, and closes the gateway. The Ghostbusters rescue Dana and Louis from the wreckage and are welcomed on the street as heroes.

=== Development ===

&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was inspired by Dan Aykroyd&#x27;s fascination with and belief in the paranormal, which he inherited from his father, who later wrote the book &quot;A History of Ghosts&quot;; his mother, who claimed to have seen ghosts; his grandfather, who experimented with radios to contact the dead; and his great-grandfather, a renowned spiritualist. In 1981, Aykroyd read an article on quantum physics and parapsychology in &quot;The Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research&quot;, which gave him the idea of trapping ghosts. He was also drawn to the idea of modernizing the comedic ghost films of the mid-20th century by comics such as Abbott and Costello (&quot;Hold That Ghost&quot;, 1941), Bob Hope (&quot;The Ghost Breakers&quot;, 1940) and the Bowery Boys (&quot;Ghost Chasers&quot;, 1951).

Aykroyd wrote the script, intending to star alongside Eddie Murphy and his close friend and fellow &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) alumnus John Belushi, before Belushi&#x27;s accidental death in March 1982. Aykroyd recalled writing one of Belushi&#x27;s lines when producer and talent agent Bernie Brillstein called to inform him of Belushi&#x27;s death. He turned to another former &quot;SNL&quot; castmate, Bill Murray, who agreed to join without an explicit agreement, which is how he often worked. Aykroyd pitched his concept to Brillstein as three men who chase ghosts and included a sketch of the Marshmallow Man character he had imagined. He likened the Ghostbusters to pest-control workers, saying that &quot;calling a Ghostbuster was just like getting rats removed&quot;. Aykroyd believed Ivan Reitman was the logical choice to direct, based on his successes with films such as &quot;Animal House&quot; (1978) and &quot;Stripes&quot; (1981). Reitman was aware of the film&#x27;s outline while Belushi was still a prospective cast member; this version took place in the future with many groups of intergalactic ghostbusters, and felt it &quot;would have cost something like $200million to make&quot;. Aykroyd&#x27;s original 70- to 80-page script treatment was more serious in tone and intended to be scary.

Reitman met with Aykroyd at Art&#x27;s Delicatessen in Studio City, Los Angeles, and explained that his concept would be impossible to make. He suggested that setting it entirely on Earth would make the extraordinary elements funnier, and that focusing on realism from the beginning would make the Marshmallow Man more believable by the end. He also wanted to portray the Ghostbusters&#x27; origins before starting their business: &quot;This was beginning of the 1980s—everyone was going into business&quot;. After the meeting, they met Harold Ramis at Burbank Studios. Reitman had worked with Ramis on previous films and believed he could better execute the tone he intended for the script than Aykroyd. He also felt Ramis should play a Ghostbuster. After reading the script, Ramis joined the project immediately.

Although the script required considerable changes, Reitman pitched the film to Columbia Pictures executive Frank Price in March 1983. Price found the concept funny, but was unsure of the project, as comedies were seen to have limited profitability. He said the film would take a big budget due to its special effects and popular cast. Reitman reportedly said they could work with $25–30 million; varying figures have been cited. Price agreed, as long as the film could be released by June 1984. Reitman later admitted he made up the figure, basing it on three times the budget for &quot;Stripes&quot;, which seemed &quot;reasonable&quot;. This left 13 months to complete the film, with no finished script, effects studio, or filming start date. Reitman hired his previous collaborators Joe Medjuck and Michael C. Gross as associate producers. Columbia&#x27;s CEO Fay Vincent sent his lawyer Dick Gallop to Los Angeles to convince Price not to pursue the film, but Price disagreed. Gallop returned to the head office to report that Price was &quot;out of control&quot;.

As the title &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was legally restricted by the 1970s children&#x27;s show &quot;The Ghost Busters&quot;, owned by Universal Studios, several alternative titles were considered, including &quot;Ghoststoppers&quot;, &quot;Ghostbreakers&quot;, and &quot;Ghostsmashers&quot;. Price parted ways with Columbia early in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;″ production and became head of Universal Pictures, at which point he sold Columbia the title for $500,000 plus 1% of the film&#x27;s profits. Given Hollywood&#x27;s accounting practices—a method used by studios to artificially inflate a film&#x27;s production costs to limit royalty or tax payouts—the film technically never made a profit for Universal to be owed a payment.

=== Writing ===
Aykroyd, Ramis, and Reitman began reworking the script, first at Reitman&#x27;s office, then sequestering themselves and their families on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Massachusetts. Aykroyd had a home there, and they worked day and night in his basement for about two weeks. Aykroyd was willing to rework his script; he considered himself a &quot;kitchen sink&quot; writer who created the funny situations and paranormal jargon, while Ramis refined the jokes and dialogue. They wrote separately, then rewrote each other&#x27;s drafts. Many scenes had to be cut, including an asylum haunted by celebrities, and an illegal ghost-storage facility in a New Jersey gas station. Their initial draft was completed when they left the Vineyard in mid-July 1983, and a third and near-final draft was ready by early August. When Murray flew to New York after filming &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1984) to meet Aykroyd and Ramis, he offered little input on the script or his character. Having written for Murray multiple times, Ramis said he knew &quot;how to handle his character&#x27;s voice&quot;.

It was decided early on that Ramis&#x27;s character would be the brains of the Ghostbusters, Aykroyd&#x27;s the heart, and Murray&#x27;s the mouth. Aykroyd drew inspiration from fiction archetypes: &quot;Put Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz, and Egon Spengler together, and you have the Scarecrow, the Lion, and the Tin Man&quot;. His concept called for the Ghostbusters to have a boss and to be directed into situations, but Ramis preferred they be in control &quot;of their own destiny&quot; and make their own choices. This led to the development of more distinct identities for the characters: Peter as the cool, modern salesman; Ray as the honest, enthusiastic technician; and Egon as the factual, stoic intellectual.

Reitman thought the most difficult parts of the writing were determining the story&#x27;s goal, who the villain was and their goal, why ghosts were manifesting, and how a towering Marshmallow Man would appear. The creature was one of many elaborate supernatural entities in Aykroyd&#x27;s initial treatment, originally intended to emerge from the East River only 20 minutes into the film. It stood out to Reitman but concerned him because of the relatively realistic tone they were taking. Meanwhile, Reitman searched for a special effects studio, eventually recruiting Richard Edlund in the same two-week span.

=== Cast and characters ===

Murray was considered essential to &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;″ potential success, but he was known for not committing to projects until late. Price agreed to fund Murray&#x27;s passion project &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;, believing if it failed it would lose little money, and hoping the gesture would secure Murray&#x27;s commitment to &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. Michael Keaton, Chevy Chase, Tom Hanks, Robin Williams, Steve Guttenberg, and Richard Pryor were also considered for the role. Christopher Walken, John Lithgow, Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Goldblum, and Keaton were considered to portray Egon. Ramis was inspired by the cover of a journal on abstract architecture for Egon&#x27;s appearance, featuring a man wearing a three-piece tweed suit and wire-rim glasses, his hair standing straight up. He took the character&#x27;s first name from a Hungarian refugee with whom he attended school, and the surname from German historian Oswald Spengler. Apart from the three main stars, Medjuck was largely responsible for casting the roles.

Hudson auditioned five times for the role of Winston Zeddemore. According to him, an earlier version of the script gave Winston a larger role as an Air Force demolitions expert with an elaborate backstory. Excited by the part, he agreed to the job for half his usual salary. The night before shooting began, he received a new script with a greatly reduced role; Reitman told him the studio wanted to expand Murray&#x27;s part. Aykroyd said Winston was the role intended for Eddie Murphy, although Reitman denied this. Gregory Hines and Reginald VelJohnson were also considered for the part.

Daryl Hannah, Denise Crosby, Julia Roberts, and Kelly LeBrock auditioned for the role of Dana Barrett, but Sigourney Weaver attracted the filmmakers&#x27; attention. There was resistance to casting her because of the generally serious roles she had played in &quot;Alien&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; (1982). She revealed her comedic background, developed at the Yale School of Drama, and began walking on all fours and howling like a dog during her audition. It was her suggestion for Dana to become possessed by Zuul; Reitman said this solved problems with the last act by giving the characters personal stakes in the events. Weaver also changed Dana&#x27;s occupation from a model to a musician, saying that Dana can be somewhat strict, but has a soul because she plays the cello.

John Candy was offered the role of Louis Tully. He told Reitman he did not understand the character and suggested portraying Tully with a German accent and multiple German Shepherds, but the filmmakers felt there were already enough dogs in the film. Candy chose not to pursue the role. Reitman had previously worked with Rick Moranis and sent him the script. He accepted the role an hour later. Moranis developed many aspects of his character, including making him an accountant, and ad-libbed the lengthy speech at Tully&#x27;s party. Sandra Bernhard turned down the role of the Ghostbusters&#x27; secretary Janine Melnitz, which went to Annie Potts. When she arrived for her first day of filming, Reitman rushed Potts into the current scene. She quickly changed out of her street clothes and borrowed a pair of glasses worn by the set dresser which her character subsequently wore throughout the film.

William Atherton was chosen for the role of Walter Peck after he had appeared in the Broadway play &quot;Broadway&quot;. Peck was described as akin to Margaret Dumont&#x27;s role as a comedic foil to the Marx Brothers. Atherton said: &quot;It can&#x27;t be funny, and I don&#x27;t find [the Ghostbusters] in the least bit charming. I have to be outraged.&quot; The role of the Sumerian god Gozer the Gozerian, envisioned as a business-suited architect, was originally intended for Paul Reubens. When he passed on the idea, Yugoslavian actress Slavitza Jovan was cast and the character changed to one inspired by the androgynous looks of Grace Jones and David Bowie. Paddi Edwards was uncredited as the voice of Gozer, dubbing over Jovan&#x27;s strong Slavic accent. Reitman&#x27;s wife and their children, Jason and Catherine, filmed a cameo appearance as a family fleeing Dana&#x27;s building, but the scene was cut because Jason was too scared by the setup to perform a second take.

=== Filming ===

Principal photography began in New York City on October 28, 1983. On the first day, Reitman brought Murray to the set, still unsure if he had read the script. Filming in New York lasted for approximately six weeks, finishing just before Christmas. Reitman was conscious they had to complete the New York phase before they encountered inhospitable December weather. At the time, choosing to shoot in New York City was considered risky. In the early 1980s, many saw the city as synonymous with fiscal disaster and violence, and Los Angeles was seen as the center of the entertainment industry. In a 2014 interview, Reitman said he chose New York because &quot;I wanted the film to be... my New York movie&quot;. As Reitman was working with comedians, he encouraged improvisation, adapting multiple takes and keeping the cast creations that worked, but directing them back to the script.

Some guerrilla filmmaking took place, capturing spontaneous scenes at iconic locations around the city, including one shot at Rockefeller Center where the actors were chased off by a real security guard. A scene was shot on Central Park West with extras chanting &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; before the name had been cleared. Medjuck contacted the studio, urging them to secure permission to use the word as the title.

The building at 55 Central Park West served as the home of Weaver&#x27;s character and the setting of the Ghostbusters&#x27; climactic battle with Gozer. The art department added extra floors and embellishments using matte paintings, models, and digital effects to create the focal point of ghostly activity. During shooting of the final scene at the building, city officials allowed the closure of the adjacent streets during rush hour, affecting traffic across a large swath of the city. Gross commented that, from the top of the building, they could see traffic queuing all the way to Brooklyn. At various points, a police officer drew his gun on a taxi driver who refused orders; in a similar incident, another officer pulled a driver through his limo window. When angry citizens asked Medjuck what was being filmed, he blamed Francis Ford Coppola filming &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984). Aykroyd encountered science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, a man he admired, who complained, &quot;You guys are inconveniencing this building, it&#x27;s just awful; I don&#x27;t know how they got away with this!&quot; Directly next to 55 Central Park West is the Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, which is stepped on by the Marshmallow Man.
Other locations included New York City Hall, the New York Public Library main branch, the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Columbus Circle, the Irving Trust Bank on Fifth Avenue, and Tavern on the Green. Firehouse, Hook &amp; Ladder Company 8 in the Tribeca neighborhood was used as the Ghostbusters&#x27; headquarters. Columbia University allowed its Havemeyer Hall to stand in for the fictional Weaver Hall, on the condition the university not be identified by name.

Filming moved to Los Angeles, resuming between Christmas and the New Year. Due to the film&#x27;s use of practical effects, skilled technicians were needed who resided mainly in the city and soundstages that were non-existent in New York. Despite its setting, most of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was filmed on location in Los Angeles or on sets at Burbank Studios. Location scouts searched for buildings that could replicate the interiors of buildings being filmed in New York. Reitman tried using the interior of Hook &amp; Ladder 8, but was unable to take it over long enough because it was an active fire station. Interior firehouse shots were taken instead at the decommissioned Fire House No. 23 in downtown Los Angeles. The building design, while common in New York, was a rarity in Los Angeles. An archival photograph of an active crew in Fire House No. 23 from 1915 was hung in the background of the Ghostbusters&#x27; office.

Filming in the main reading room of the New York Public Library was only allowed in the early morning and had to be concluded by 10:00 am. The basement library stacks were represented by the Los Angeles Central Library as Reitman said they were interchangeable. The Millennium Biltmore Hotel stood in for the scenes set at the fictional Sedgewick Hotel. Principal photography concluded at the end of January 1984, after between 55 and 62 days of filming.

=== Post-production ===
The short production schedule and looming release date meant Reitman edited the film while it was being shot. There was often only time for a few takes. Reitman sometimes found making an effects-laden movie frustrating, as the special effects had to be storyboarded and filmed in advance; there was no option to go back and produce new scenes. As Gross described it: storyboard in advance, that&#x27;s like editing in advance. You&#x27;ve got a scene, they&#x27;re going to approve that scene, and we&#x27;re going to spend nine months doing that cut. There&#x27;s no second takes, no outtakes, there&#x27;s no coverage. You can cut stuff, but you can&#x27;t add stuff. It made [Reitman] so confined that it really bothered him&quot;.

A deleted scene involved a segment at &quot;Fort Detmerring&quot; where Ray has a sexual encounter with a female ghost. The scene was intended to introduce a love interest for Aykroyd. Ramis believed it was extraneous to the fast-moving plot, however, so Reitman used the footage as a dream sequence during the mid-film montage instead. Editor Sheldon Kahn sent Reitman black-and-white reels of sequences during filming. They not only allowed him to make changes, but he considered they also helped him understand how to better pace the film. Kahn completed the first full cut three weeks after filming concluded. The final cut runs for 105minutes.

=== Music ===
The &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; score was composed by Elmer Bernstein and performed by the 72-person Hollywood Studio Symphony orchestra at The Village in West Los Angeles, California. It was orchestrated by David Spear and Bernstein&#x27;s son Peter. Elmer Bernstein had previously scored several of Reitman&#x27;s films and joined the project early on, before all the cast had been signed. Reitman wanted a grounded, realistic score and did not want the music to tell the audience when something was funny. Bernstein used the ondes Martenot (effectively a keyboard equivalent of a theremin) to produce the &quot;eerie&quot; effect. Bernstein had to bring a musician from England to play the instrument because there were so few trained ondists. He also used three Yamaha DX7 synthesizers. In a 1985 interview Bernstein described &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; as the most difficult score he had written, finding it challenging to balance the varying comedic and serious tones. He created an &quot;antic&quot; theme for the Ghostbusters he described as &quot;cute, without being really way out&quot;. He found the latter parts of the film easier to score, aiming to make it sound &quot;awesome and mystical&quot;.

Early on Reitman and Bernstein discussed the idea that &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; would feature popular music at specific points to complement Bernstein&#x27;s original score. This includes &quot;Magic&quot; by Mick Smiley, which plays during the scene when the ghosts are released from the Ghostbusters headquarters. Bernstein&#x27;s main theme for the Ghostbusters was later replaced by Ray Parker Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. Bernstein personally disliked the use of these songs, particularly &quot;Magic&quot;, but said, &quot;it&#x27;s very hard to argue with something like [&quot;Ghostbusters&quot;], when it is up in the top ten on the charts&quot;.

Music was required for a montage in the middle of the film, and &quot;I Want a New Drug&quot; by Huey Lewis and the News was used as a temporary placeholder because of its appropriate tempo. Reitman was later introduced to Parker Jr. who developed &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; with a similar riff to match the montage. There were approximately 50 to 60 different theme songs developed for &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; by different artists before Parker Jr.&#x27;s involvement, though none was deemed suitable. Huey Lewis was approached to compose the film&#x27;s theme, but was already committed to work on &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985).

== Design ==
During the thirteen-month production, all the major special effects studios were working on other films. Those that remained were too small to work on the approximately 630 individual effects shots needed for &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. At the same time, special effects cinematographer Richard Edlund planned to leave Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) and start his own business. Reitman convinced Columbia to collaborate with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which also needed an effects studio, to advance Edlund $5 million to establish his own company, Boss Film Studios. According to Edlund, lawyers used much of the setup time finalizing the contract, leaving only ten months remaining to build the effects studio, shoot the scenes, and composite the images. The Boss Film Studios&#x27; team was split to complete work on &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and MGM&#x27;s science-fiction film &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot;. The $5 million effects came in at $700,000 over budget. The strict filming schedule meant most of the effects shots were captured in one take. Gross oversaw both the creation of Boss Film Studios, and the hiring of many conceptual designers including comic book artists Tanino Liberatore (whose work went unused) and Bernie Wrightson (who helped conceive several ghost designs), and storyboarder Thom Enriquez, whose designs contributed to the &quot;Onion Head ghost&quot;.

=== Creature effects ===

Edlund&#x27;s previous work on the supernatural horror film &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (1982) served as a reference for the ghost designs in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. Gross said it was difficult to balance making the ghosts a genuine threat while fitting the film&#x27;s more comedic tone. Special effects artist Steve Johnson sculpted the gluttonous, slimy, green ghost then known as the &quot;Onion Head ghost&quot; on set due to the puppet&#x27;s unpleasant smell. The creature was given the name &quot;Slimer&quot; in the 1986 animated television series &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;. The Slimer design took six months and cost approximately $300,000. After struggling to complete a design due to executive interference, Johnson took at least three grams of cocaine and completed the final design in one night, based in part on Aykroyd&#x27;s and Ramis&#x27;s wish for the creature to homage Belushi. The full-size foam rubber puppet was worn by Mark Wilson and filmed against a black background. Puppeteers manipulated the model&#x27;s movements with cables.

Aykroyd tasked his friend, referred to as the Viking, with designing the Marshmallow Man, asking for a combination of the Michelin Man and the Pillsbury Doughboy in a sailor hat. The Marshmallow Man outfit was built and portrayed by actor and special effects artist Bill Bryan, who modeled his walk on Godzilla. There were eighteen foam suits, each costing between $25,000 and $30,000; seventeen of them, worn by stuntman Tommy Cesar, were burned as part of filming. Bryan used a separate air supply due to the foam&#x27;s toxicity. There were three different heads for the suit, built from foam and fiberglass, with different expressions and movements controlled by cable mechanisms. The costume was filmed against scale models to finish the effect. The effects team was able to find only one model of a police car at the correct scale and bought several, modifying them to represent different vehicles. The water from a burst hydrant hit by a remote-controlled car was actually sand as the water did not scale down. The &quot;marshmallow&quot; raining down on the crowd after it is destroyed was shaving cream. After seeing the intended of shaving cream to be used, Atherton insisted on testing it. The weight knocked a stuntman down, and they ended up using only . The cream acted as a skin irritant after hours of filming, giving some of the cast rashes.

Johnson also sculpted the Zombie Cab Driver puppet. It was the only puppet shot on location in New York City. Johnson based it on a reanimated corpse puppet he had made for &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; (1981). Johnson and Wilson collaborated on the Library Ghost, creating a puppet operated by up to 20 cables running through the torso that controlled aspects such as moving the head, arms, and pulling rubber skin away from the torso to transform it from a humanoid into a monstrous ghoul. The original Library Ghost puppet was considered too scary for younger audiences and was repurposed for use in &quot;Fright Night&quot; (1985). The library catalog scene was accomplished live in three takes, with the crew blowing air through copper pipes to force the cards into the air. These had to be collected and reassembled for each take. Reitman used a multi-camera setup to focus on the librarian and the cards flying around her and a wider overall shot. The floating books were hung on strings.

Randy Cook was responsible for creating the quarter-scale stop-motion puppets of Gozer&#x27;s minions Zuul and Vinz, the Terror Dogs, when in motion. The model was heavy and unwieldy, and it took nearly thirty hours to film it moving across a stage for the scene where it pursues Louis Tully across a street. For the scene where Dana is pinned to her chair by demonic hands before a doorway beaming with light, Reitman said he was influenced by &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977). A rubber door was used to allow distortion as if something was trying to come through it, while grips concealed in a trapdoor beneath the chair, burst through it while wearing demonic dog-leg gloves. Made before the advent of computer-generated imagery (CGI), any non-puppet ghosts had to be animated. It took up to three weeks to create one second of footage. For Gozer, Slavitza Jovan wore red contact lenses that caused her a great deal of pain, and she wore a harness to move around the set.

=== Technology and equipment ===

Hardware consultant Stephen Dane was responsible for designing most of the Ghostbusters&#x27; iconic equipment, including the &quot;proton packs&quot; used to wrangle ghosts, ghost traps, and their vehicle, the Ectomobile. The equipment had to be designed and built in the six weeks before filming began in September 1983. Inspired by a military issue flamethrower, the &quot;proton packs&quot; consisted of a handheld proton stream firing &quot;neutrino wand&quot; connected by a hose to a backpack said to contain a nuclear accelerator. Dane said he &quot;went home and got foam pieces and just threw a bunch of stuff together to get the look. It was highly machined, but it had to look off-the-shelf and military surplus&quot;.

Following Reitman&#x27;s tweaks to the design, on-screen models of the &quot;proton packs&quot; were made from a fiberglass shell with an aluminum backplate bolted to a United States Army backpack frame. Each pack weighed approximately with the batteries for lighting installed, and strained the actors&#x27; backs during the long shoots. Two lighter versions were made; a hollow one with surface details for wide shots, and a foam rubber version for action scenes. The fiberglass props were created by special effects supervisor Chuck Gaspar, based on Dane&#x27;s design. Gaspar used rubber molds to create identical fiberglass shells. The &quot;neutrino wand&quot; had a flashbulb at the tip, giving animators an origin point for the proton streams. Fake walls laced with pyrotechnics were used to practically create the damage of the proton streams. The &quot;Psychokinetic Energy meter&quot; (&quot;PKE meter&quot;) prop was built using an Iona SP-1 handheld shoe polisher as a base, to which lights and electronics were affixed. The PKE meter prop was designed and built by John Zabrucky of Modern Props in partnership with an outside fabricator. The technology was designed to not be overly fancy or sleek, emphasizing the characters&#x27; scientific backgrounds combined with the homemade nature of their equipment.

The Ectomobile was in the first draft of Aykroyd&#x27;s script, and he and John Daveikis developed some early concepts for the car. Dane developed fully detailed drawings for the interior and exterior and supervised the transformation of the 1959 Cadillac Miller-Meteor ambulance conversion into the Ectomobile. According to Aykroyd, the actual vehicle was &quot;an ambulance that we converted to a hearse and then converted to an ambulance&quot;. Early concepts featured a black car with purple and white strobe lights giving it a supernatural glow, but this idea was scrapped after cinematographer László Kovács noted that dark paint would not film well at night. The concept also had fantastic features such as the ability to dematerialize and travel inter-dimensionally. Two vehicles were purchased, one for the pre-modification scenes. Dane designed its high-tech roof array with objects including a directional antenna, an air-conditioning unit, storage boxes and a radome. Because of its size, the roof rack was shipped to Manhattan on an airplane, while the car was transported to the East Coast by train. Sound designer Richard Beggs created the siren from a recording of a leopard snarl, cut and played backward.

=== Logo and sets ===

In the script, Aykroyd described the Ghostbusters clothing and vehicle as bearing a no symbol with a ghost trapped in it, crediting the Viking with the original concept. The final design fell to Gross, who had volunteered to serve as art director. As the logo would be required for props and sets, it needed to be finalized quickly, and Gross worked with Boss Film artist and creature design consultant Brent Boates who drew the final concept, and R/GA animated the logo for the film&#x27;s opening. According to Gross, two versions of the logo exist, with one having &quot;ghostbusters&quot; written across the diagonal part of the sign. Gross did not like how it looked and flipped the diagonal bar to read top left to bottom right instead, but they later removed the wording. According to Gross, this is the correct version of the sign that was used throughout Europe. The bottom left to top right version was used in the United States as that was the design of the No symbol there.

Medjuck also hired John DeCuir as production designer. The script did not specify where Gozer would appear, and DeCuir painted the top of Dana&#x27;s building with large, crystal doors that opened as written in the script. The fictional rooftop of 55 Central Park West was constructed at Stage 12 on the Burbank Studios lot. It was one of the largest constructed sets in film history and was surrounded by a 360-degree cyclorama painting. The lighting used throughout the painting consumed so much power that the rest of the studio had to be shut down, and an additional four generators added, when it was in use. Small models such as planes were hung on string to animate the backdrop. The set was built three stories off the ground to allow for filming from low angles.

The first three floors and street-front of Dana&#x27;s building were recreated as sets for filming, including the climactic earthquake scene where hydraulics were used to raise broken parts of the street. Broken pieces of pavement and the road were positioned outside the real location to create a seamless transition between the two shots. DeCuir said: &quot;They had one night to dress the street. When people went home early in the evening everything was normal, and when the little old ladies came out to walk their dogs in the morning, the whole street had erupted. Apparently, people complained to the New York Police Department and their switchboard lit up.&quot; For the scene where Dana&#x27;s apartment explodes outwards, Weaver stood on set as the stunt happened. Similarly, the scene of Weaver rotating in the air was performed on set using a body-cast and mechanical arm concealed in the curtains, a trick Reitman learned working with magician Doug Henning.

=== Test screening and marketing ===
&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was screened for test audiences on February 3, 1984, with unfinished effects shots to determine if the comedy worked. Reitman was still concerned audiences would not react well to the Marshmallow Man because of its deviation from the realism of the rest of the film. Reitman recalled that approximately 200 people were recruited off the streets to view the film in a theater on the Burbank lot. It was during the opening library scene Reitman knew the film worked. Audiences reacted with fear, laughs, and applause as the Librarian Ghost transformed into a monster. The fateful Marshmallow scene was met with a similar reaction, and Reitman knew he would not have to perform any re-shoots. The screening for fellow industry members fared less well. Price recalled laughing as the rest of the audience sat deadpan; he rationalized an industry audience wants failure. Murray and Aykroyd&#x27;s agent Michael Ovitz recalled an executive telling him, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry: we all make mistakes&quot;, while Roberto Goizueta, chairman of Columbia&#x27;s parent, The Coca-Cola Company, said: &quot;Gee, we&#x27;re going to lose our shirts&quot;.
In the months before its debut, a teaser trailer focused on the &quot;No ghosts&quot; logo, helping it become recognizable far in advance, and generating interest in the film without mentioning its title or its stars. A separate theatrical trailer contained a toll-free telephone number with a message by Murray and Aykroyd waiting for the 1,000 callers per hour it received over a six-week period. They also appeared in a video for ShoWest, a theater-owner convention, to promote the film. Columbia spent approximately $10million on marketing, including $2.25million on prints, $1million on promotional materials, and $7million on advertising and miscellaneous costs including a $150,000 premiere for a hospital and the hotel costs for the press. Including the budget and marketing costs, it was estimated the film would have to make at least $80million to turn a profit.

=== Box office ===

The premiere of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; took place on June 7, 1984, at the Avco Cinema in Westwood, Los Angeles, before its wide release the following day across 1,339 theaters in the United States (U.S.) and Canada. During its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada, the film earned $13.6million—an average of $10,040 per theater. It finished as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of premiering horror-comedy &quot;Gremlins&quot; ($12.5million), and the adventure film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; ($12 million), in its third week of release. The gross increased to $23.1 million during its first week, becoming the first major success for the studio since &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982). The film remained number one for seven consecutive weeks, grossing $146.5million, before being ousted by &quot;Purple Rain&quot; in early August.

&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; regained the number one spot the following week before spending the next five weeks at number two, behind the action film &quot;Red Dawn&quot; and then the thriller &quot;Tightrope&quot;. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; remained among the top-three grossing films for sixteen straight weeks before beginning a gradual decline and falling from the top-ten by late October. It left cinemas in early January 1985, after thirty weeks. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; had quickly become a hit, surpassing &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; as the top-grossing film of the summer, and earning $229million, making it the second highest-grossing film of 1984, approximately $5million behind Eddie Murphy&#x27;s action-comedy &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; ($234.8million) which was released in mid-December. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; surpassed &quot;Animal House&quot; as the highest-grossing comedy film ever, until &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; surpassed it six months later.

Columbia had negotiated 50% of the box-office revenues or 90% of gross after expenses, depending on whichever was higher. Since the latter was the case, the studio received a 73% share of the box office profit, an estimated $128million. The main cast members each received percentages of the gross profits or net participation. A 1987 report estimated Murray alone had earned between $20–30million from his share. 1984 saw the release of several films that would later be considered iconic of the era, including: &quot;Gremlins&quot;, &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, &quot;The Terminator&quot;, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;, and &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot;. It was also the first year in box office history in which four films, including &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, grossed over $100million.

&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was re-released in the U.S. and Canada in August 1985, grossing a further $9.4million over five weeks, raising its theatrical gross to $238.6million and surpassing &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; as the most successful comedy of the 1980s. By the end of 1999, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; had grossed $126 million internationally for a worldwide total of $364.6 million. A restored and remastered version was released in August 2014, at 700 theaters across the U.S. and Canada to celebrate its 30thanniversary. It grossed an additional $3.5million, bringing the theatrical total to $242.2 million. The film has also received limited rereleases for special events and anniversaries. Including all reissues since 2000, the film has grossed an estimated $370million worldwide. Adjusted for inflation, the North American box office is equivalent to $667.9million in 2020, making it the thirty-seventh highest-grossing film ever.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===

&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; opened to generally positive reviews. Roger Ebert gave it three and a half out of four, citing it as a rare example of successfully combining a special effects-driven blockbuster with &quot;sly&quot; dialogue. Ebert noted the effects existed to serve the actors&#x27; performances and not the reverse, saying it is &quot;an exception to the general rule that big special effects can wreck a comedy&quot;. He also cited &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; as a rare mainstream film with many quotable lines. Writing for &quot;Newsday&quot;, Joseph Gelmis described the Ghostbusters as an adolescent fantasy, comparing their firehouse base to the Batcave with a fireman&#x27;s pole and an Ectomobile on the ground floor.

&quot;Deseret News&quot;″ Christopher Hicks praised Reitman&#x27;s improved directing skills, and the crew for avoiding the vulgarity found in their previous films, &quot;Caddyshack&quot; and &quot;Stripes&quot;. He felt they reached for more creative humor and genuine thrills instead. He complained about the finale, claiming it lost its sense of fun and was &quot;overblown&quot;, but found the film compensated for this since it &quot;has ghosts like you&#x27;ve never seen&quot;. Janet Maslin agreed that the apocalyptic finale was out of hand, saying &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; worked best during the smaller ghost-catching scenes. Dave Kehr wrote that Reitman is adept at improvisational comedy, but lost control of the film as the special effects gradually escalated.

Arthur Knight appreciated the relaxed style of comedy saying while the plot is &quot;primitive&quot;, it has &quot;far more style and finesse&quot; than would be expected of the creative team behind &quot;Meatballs&quot; and &quot;Animal House&quot;. He singled out editors Sheldon Kahn and David Blewitt for creating a sustained pace of comedy and action. Despite &quot;bathroom humor and tacky sight gags&quot;, Peter Travers described &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; favorably as &quot;irresistible nonsense&quot;, comparing it to the supernatural horror film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, but with the comedy duo Abbott and Costello starring. &quot;Time&quot;″s Richard Schickel described the special effects as somewhat &quot;tacky&quot; but believed this was a deliberate commentary on other ghost films. Ultimately, he believed praise was due to all involved for &quot;thinking on a grandly comic scale&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s David Ansen enjoyed the film, describing it as a teamwork project where everyone works &quot;toward the same goal of relaxed insanity&quot;; he called it &quot;wonderful summer nonsense&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot;″s review described it as a &quot;lavishly produced&quot; film that is only periodically impressive.

Reviewers were consistent in their praise for Murray&#x27;s performance. Gene Siskel wrote that Murray&#x27;s comedic sensibilities compensated for the &quot;boring special effects&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; singled out Murray for his &quot;endearing&quot; physical comedy and ad-libbing. Hicks similarly praised Murray, saying he &quot;has never been better than he is here&quot;. Schickel considered Murray&#x27;s character a &quot;once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to develop fully his patented comic character&quot;. Gelmis appreciated Murray&#x27;s dismissal of the serious situations to keep them comedic.

The interactions between Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis, were also generally well received. Schickel praised Aykroyd and Ramis for their &quot;grace&quot; in allowing Murray to outshine them. Travers and Gelmis said the three main actors worked well as a collaborative force, and Hicks described Murray, Ramis, and Aykroyd as wanting &quot;to be like the Marx Brothers of the 80s&quot;. Conversely, Kehr believed the pair were &quot;curiously underutilized&quot;, but appreciated Murray&#x27;s deadpan line readings. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s Pauline Kael had problems with the chemistry among the three leads. She praised Murray, but felt other actors did not have much material to contribute to the story; she concluded, &quot;Murray&#x27;s lines fall on dead air&quot;. Maslin believed Murray&#x27;s talents were in service to a film lacking wit or coherence. She noted that many of the characters had little to do, leaving their stories unresolved as the plot began to give way to servicing the special effects instead. However, she did praise Weaver&#x27;s performance as an &quot;excellent foil&quot; for Murray. &quot;Variety&quot; described it as a mistake to cast top comedians but often have them working alone. Siskel enjoyed the characters interacting with each other, but was critical of Hudson&#x27;s late addition to the plot and his lack of development, believing it made &quot;him appear as only a token box office lure&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was nominated for two Academy Awards in 1985: Best Original Song for &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; by Ray Parker Jr. (losing to Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;I Just Called to Say I Love You&quot; from &quot;The Woman in Red&quot;), and Best Visual Effects for John Bruno, Richard Edlund, Chuck Gaspar and Mark Vargo (losing to &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;). That year, it was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards: Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy (losing to &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;), Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Murray (losing to Dudley Moore in &quot;Micki &amp; Maude&quot;), and Best Original Song for Parker Jr., (losing again to &quot;I Just Called to Say I Love You&quot;). &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; went on to win the BAFTA Award for Best Original Song, and Edlund was nominated for Special Visual Effects (losing again to &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;). It won Best Fantasy Film at the 12th Saturn Awards.

== Post-release ==
=== Aftermath ===
Ray Parker Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; spent three weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1984 and 21 weeks on the charts altogether. The song is estimated to have added $20 million to the film&#x27;s box office. Reitman directed the successful &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; music video that included several celebrity cameos. Shortly after the film&#x27;s release, Huey Lewis sued Parker Jr., for plagiarizing his 1983 song &quot;I Want a New Drug&quot;. The case was settled out of court in 1985. Parker Jr. later sued Lewis for breaching a confidentiality agreement about the case. In 1984, the filmmakers were also sued by Harvey Cartoons, the owner of Casper the Friendly Ghost for $50 million and the destruction of all copies of the film. Harvey alleged the Ghostbusters logo was based on their character Fatso. The case was decided in Columbia&#x27;s favor.

Murray left acting for four years following the release of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. He described the success as a phenomenon that would forever be his biggest accomplishment and, compounded by the failure of his personal project &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;, he felt &quot;radioactive&quot;. Murray avoided central roles in films until the 1988 Christmas comedy film &quot;Scrooged&quot;, which used the tagline that Murray was &quot;back among the ghosts&quot;. In a 1989 interview, Reitman said he was upset at the &quot;little respect&quot; he felt &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; received and his work was not taken seriously, believing many dismissed it as just &quot;another action-comedy&quot;.

Hudson held mixed feelings about &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. He regretted the marginalization of his character from the original script and felt &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; did not improve his career as he had hoped, or been promised. In a 2014 interview, he said: &quot;I love the character and he&#x27;s got some great lines, but I felt the guy was just kind of there... I&#x27;m very thankful that fans appreciate the Winston character. But it&#x27;s always been very frustrating—kind of a love/hate thing, I guess.&quot; Atherton said fans would call him &quot;dickless&quot; on the streets into the 1990s, to his ire.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was released on VHS in October 1985. Paramount Pictures had scheduled the equally popular &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; to release the day before &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, forcing Columbia to release it a week earlier to avoid direct competition. Priced at $79.95, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was predicted to sell well but be outperformed by &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; because of its lower $29.95 price. The release was supported by a $1million advertising campaign. The film was the tenth best-selling VHS during its launch week. Columbia earned approximately $20million selling the rights to manufacture and distribute the VHS. A record 410,000 VHS units were ordered (exceeded a few months later by &quot;&quot;″s 425,000 unit order). By February 1986, it was estimated to have sold 400,000 copies and earned $32 million in revenue, making it the third best-selling VHS of 1985, after &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (425,000 units, $12.7 million) and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; (1.4 million units sold, $41.9 million).

&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was released in 1989 on LaserDisc, a format then experiencing a resurgence in popularity. The release offered a one-disc version, and a two-disc special edition version featuring deleted scenes, a split-screen demonstration of the film&#x27;s effects, the screenplay, and other special features. In a 1999 interview for the DVD release, Reitman admitted he was not involved in the LaserDisc versions and had been embarrassed by the visual changes that &quot;pumped up the light level so much you saw all the matte lines&quot;, highlighting flaws in the special effects. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was also the first full-length film to be released on a USB flash drive when PNY Technologies did so in 2008.

Blu-ray disc editions were released for the film&#x27;s 25th, 30th, and 35th anniversaries in 2009, 2014 and 2019. They featured remastered 4K resolution video quality, deleted scenes, alternate takes, fan interviews, and commentaries by crew members and actors including Aykroyd, Ramis, Reitman, and Medjuck. The 35th-anniversary version came in a limited edition steel book cover and contained unseen footage including the deleted &quot;Fort Detmerring&quot; scene. The film was released as part of the 8-disc &quot;Ghostbusters: Ultimate Collection&quot; Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray boxset in February 2022, also containing its sequels &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; (1989) and &quot;&quot; (2021), and the 2016 reboot &quot;&quot;. Presented in a ghost trap-shaped box, the release features a 114-minute preview cut of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; including deleted scenes, an edited-for-TV version, recorded auditions for Dana, and a 90-minute documentary, &quot;Ghostbusters: Behind Closed Doors&quot; about the film&#x27;s production. Parker Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; received special edition vinyl record releases, one as a glow in the dark record—the other a white record presented in a marshmallow-scented jacket. A remaster of Bernstein&#x27;s score was also released in June 2019, on compact disc, digital, and vinyl formats. It includes four unreleased tracks, and commentary by Bernstein&#x27;s son Peter.

=== Merchandise ===

Developing merchandise for a film was still a relatively new practice at the time of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;″ release, and it was only following the success of &quot;Star Wars&quot; merchandise that other studios attempted to duplicate the idea. The unexpected success of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; meant Columbia did not have a comprehensive merchandising plan in place to fully capitalize on the film at the peak of its popularity. They were able to generate additional revenue, however, by applying the popular &quot;no ghosts&quot; logo to a variety of products. Much of the merchandising success came from licensing the rights to other companies based on the success of the 1986 animated spin-off &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;. Merchandise based directly on the film did not initially sell well until &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, which on its own helped generate up to $200 million in revenue in 1988, the same year the Ghostbusters proton pack was the most popular toy in the United Kingdom. A successful &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; video game was released alongside the film. The film also received two novelizations, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; by Larry Milne (released with the film), and &quot;Ghostbusters: The Supernatural Spectacular&quot; by Richard Mueller (released in 1985). &quot;Making Ghostbusters&quot;, an annotated script by Ramis, was released in 1985.

In the years since its release, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; merchandise has included: soundtrack albums, action figures, books, Halloween costumes, various Lego and Playmobil sets including the Ectomobile and Firehouse, board games, slot machines, pinball machines, bobbleheads, statues, prop replicas, neon signs, ice cube trays, Minimates, coin banks, Funko Pop figures, footwear, lunch boxes, and breakfast cereals. A Slimer-inspired limited-edition citrus-flavored Hi-C Ecto Cooler drink first released in 1987, was one of the more popular items, and did not cease production until 2001. The Slimer character became iconic and popular, appearing in video games, toys, cartoons, sequels, toothpaste, and juice boxes. There have also been crossover products including comic books and toys that combine the Ghostbusters with existing properties like &quot;Men in Black&quot;, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, &quot;Transformers&quot;, and World Wrestling Entertainment.

== Thematic analysis ==
=== Capitalism and private industry ===

As described by academic Christine Alice Corcos, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; is &quot;a satire on academia, intellectuals, city government, yuppies, tax professionals, and apathetic New Yorkers&quot;. It has also been analyzed as an era-appropriate example of Republican, libertarian, or neo-liberal ideology, in particular, Reagan-era economics popularized by United States President Ronald Reagan. Reaganomics focused on limited government spending and deregulation in favor of a free market provided by the private sector of entrepreneurship, profit motives, and individual initiative. Analysts point to the premise of a small private business obstructed by an arrogant, incompetent bureaucrat (Walter Peck) from a government agency. Peck&#x27;s interference compromises the Ghostbusters&#x27; ghost containment unit, unleashing spirits upon the city and ushering in Gozer&#x27;s arrival. When Peck arrives to shutter the Ghostbusters, Egon affirms &quot;this is private property&quot;. In this sense, it is Peck, not Gozer, who represents the true villain. Others note that after losing their university jobs, Aykroyd&#x27;s character is upset because their public sector funding required little of them. He had worked in the private sector where &quot;they expect results&quot;. Reitman considered himself a &quot;conservative-slash-libertarian&quot;.

The &quot;Washington Examiner&quot; wrote that the private sector arrives to combat the supernatural activity in New York, for a fee, while the government is incapable of doing anything. As &quot;Vox&quot; notes, the mayor, a government representative, is motivated to release the Ghostbusters after being reminded that their success will save the lives of &quot;millions of registered voters&quot;, a cynical view of an official who is motivated by what allows him to retain his position. The mayor&#x27;s choice is ideological: the privatized free market of the Ghostbusters or the government agency Peck represents. Even the police are forced to take Louis/Vinz to the Ghostbusters because they are incapable of dealing with him. Author Ralph Clare highlights that the Ghostbusters reside in a disused firehouse and drive an old ambulance, each sold off as public services fail. Corcos suggests the Ghostbusters are an example of the American free-thinker, representing vigilantes fighting against government overreach that is worsening the issue.

Clare wrote that &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; embraces the free market in the aftermath of American financial despair in the 1970s, particularly in New York City that led to films set in a gritty, collapsing, crime-ridden, and failed New York, such as &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), &quot;The Warriors&quot; (1979), and &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981). &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was created at the beginning of an economic recovery that Clare described as &quot;pure capitalism&quot;, focused on the privatization and deregulation to allow the private sector to supplant the government. The necessity of the mayor outsourcing the ghost problem mirrors the real New York government ceding vast areas of real estate to corporations to stimulate renewal. The use of capitalism can be further seen in how Ray, tasked to empty his mind, is incapable of recalling anything but a consumerist mascot; in another example, Dana&#x27;s refrigerator, which stores consumerist icons, is where she witnesses Zuul.

=== Inequality, immigrants, and pollution ===
The ghosts in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; have been interpreted as analogs for crime, homelessness, pollution, and faltering infrastructure and public services. Corcos discussed &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;″s negative take on government and environmental regulation. She wrote that the ghosts represent pollutants, remnants of environmental damage, and a reflection of real-life governments refusing to acknowledge environmental problems that affect humanity. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) explicitly does not believe in the ghosts or &quot;waste&quot; the Ghostbusters are collecting and, in turn, the Ghostbusters do not believe the EPA deserves obedience or compliance because of its ignorance. Even though the Ghostbusters have condensed a widespread problem into a small area, they have constructed a dangerous containment unit in a heavily populated area while possessing the unique knowledge to understand how much danger it poses. However, Peck&#x27;s rigid adherence to government regulation results in him turning off the unit and creating a more dangerous situation.

Clare identified the ghosts as representative of New York&#x27;s issues with the homeless and ethnic minorities. The ghosts, which were once human, are not acknowledged as such and are treated as a nuisance that the Ghostbusters transport to less desirable areas, similar to real-world gentrification. The Ghostbusters charge a substantial fee for their services and so generally serve the affluent such as the Sedgewick hotel and Dana Barrett, while poorer Chinese citizens pay for their services in meat. In this way, Clare argues, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; promotes the regeneration of New York City but ignores the cost to the poor and disenfranchised to achieve it. Author Zoila Clark noted that concept art of an unused Chinatown ghost bore similarities to a stereotypical Chinese immigrant including long, braided hair and a triangular agricultural hat.

=== Immaturity ===
Author Nicole Matthews argued the need to present a film targeted at both adults and children leads to the central characters being infantilized and immature. Critic Vincent Canby said a film&#x27;s profitability was dependent on addressing children who &quot;can identify with a 40-year-old-man with a mid-life crisis and 40-year-old-men in midlife crises who long to fight pirates with cardboard cutlasses&quot;. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; presents Venkman&#x27;s immature comedic sarcasm as a means of disarming situations and furthering the narrative. Author Jim Whalley wrote that this presents a clear tonal shift in the sequel; in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, the characters are hired workers just doing their job, whereas in &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; they are noble heroes saving the city. In doing so, &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; reimagines Venkman&#x27;s persona as comedic relief instead of a practical tool. The primarily male audience also results in female characters that are either absent or not important to the overall story. Author Jane Crisp wrote that Dana encountering Zuul in her fridge presents a stereotypical view of women being associated with the home and kitchen.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; is considered one of the first blockbusters and is credited with refining the term to effectively create a new genre that mixed comedy, science fiction, horror, and thrills. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; also confirmed the merchandising success of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) was not a fluke. A successful, recognizable brand could be used to launch spin-offs, helping establish a business model in the film industry that has since become the status quo. Once &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;″ popularity was clear, the studio aggressively cultivated its profile, translating it into merchandising and other media such as television, extending its profitable lifetime long after the film had left theaters.

Entertainment industry observers credit &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; with reversing the negative perception of New York City in the early 1980s. Weaver said: &quot;I think it was a love letter to New York and New Yorkers... the doorman saying, &#x27;Someone brought a cougar to a party&#x27;—that&#x27;s so New York. When we come down covered with marshmallow, and there are these crowds of New Yorkers of all types and descriptions cheering for us... it was one of the most moving things I can remember&quot;. It is similarly credited with helping diminish the divide between television and film actors. Talent agent Michael Ovitz said that before &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, television actors were only considered for minor roles in film. Describing &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;″ enduring popularity, Reitman said &quot;kids are all worried about death and... ghost-like things. By watching &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, there&#x27;s a sense that you can control this, that you can mitigate it somehow and it doesn&#x27;t have to be that frightening. It became this movie that parents liked to bring their kids to—they could appreciate it on different levels but still watch it together&quot;.

=== Cultural influence ===
&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was considered a phenomenon and highly influential. The &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;″ theme song was a hit, and Halloween of 1984 was dominated by children dressed as the titular protagonists. It had a significant effect on popular culture and is credited with inventing the special-effects driven comedy. Its basic premise of a particular genre mixed with comedy, and a team combating an otherworldly threat has been replicated with varying degrees of success in films like &quot;Men in Black&quot; (1997), &quot;Evolution&quot; (2001), &quot;The Watch&quot; (2012), &quot;R.I.P.D.&quot; (2013), and &quot;Pixels&quot; (2015). In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Reitman responded: &quot;It&#x27;s an honor to know that a movie that begins with a ghost in a library now has a spot on the shelves of the Library of Congress&quot;.

In 1984, the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; phenomenon was referred to across dozens of advertisements for everything from airlines to dentistry and real estate. The &quot;-busters&quot; suffix became a common term used at both local and national stages, being applied to topics like the United States national budget (&quot;budgetbusters&quot;), agriculture (&quot;cropbusters&quot;), B-52s (&quot;nukebusters&quot;), sanitation (&quot;litterbusters&quot;), or Pan American Airlines (&quot;pricebusters&quot;). Similarly, the &quot;no ghosts&quot; logo was modified to protest political candidates like Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale to Mickey Mouse by striking Disney workers. Other contributions to the cultural lexicon included &quot;Who ya gonna call?&quot; from Parker Jr&#x27;s &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, and Murray&#x27;s adlib of &quot;this chick is toast&quot; against Gozer to imply she was finished or doomed over the scripted line of &quot;I&#x27;m gonna turn this guy into toast&quot;. This is thought to be the first historic usage of &quot;toast&quot; as a slang term.

&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; quickly developed a dedicated fan following that has continued to thrive in the years since. Despite its mainstream success, it is considered an example of a cult blockbuster—a popular film with a dedicated fanbase. It is popular globally, inspiring fan clubs, fan-made films, art, and conventions. Fans dressed as Ghostbusters occasionally burst into the main reading room of the New York Public Library. The 2016 crowdfunded documentary &quot;Ghostheads&quot; follows various fans of the series and details the effect it has had on their lives, interspersed with interviews from crew, including Aykroyd, Reitman, and Weaver. A separate 2019 documentary, &quot;Cleanin&#x27; Up the Town: Remembering Ghostbusters&quot;, details the film production. Memorabilia from the film is popular, with a screen-used proton pack selling for $169,000 at a 2012 auction. In 2017, a newly discovered ankylosaur fossil was named &quot;Zuul crurivastator&quot; after Gozer&#x27;s minion.

&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was turned into a special-effects laden stage show at Universal Studios Florida, which ran from 1990 to 1996, based mainly on the final battle with Gozer. The 2019 Halloween Horror Nights event at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida hosted a haunted maze attraction featuring locations, characters, and ghosts from the film. The film has also been homaged or explicitly referred to across a variety of media including film, television, and video games. Aykroyd reprised his Ghostbuster character for a cameo in &quot;Casper&quot; (1995), and the celebratory parade at the film&#x27;s denouement inspired the ending of the 2012 superhero film &quot;The Avengers&quot;, showing the world celebrating the eponymous team&#x27;s victory.

=== Critical reassessment ===
&quot;Ghostbusters&quot;″s positive reception has lasted well beyond its release, and it is considered one of the most important comedy films ever made. It is listed in the 2013 film reference book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;. On its 30th anniversary in 2014, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s entertainment industry-voted ranking named it the seventy-seventh best film of all time. That year, &quot;Time Out&quot; rated &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; five out of five, describing it as a &quot;cavalcade of pure joy&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot;″s reader-voted list of the 100 Greatest Movies placed the film as number 68. In 2014, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers voted &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; the ninth-greatest film of the 1980s. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes offers a approval rating from critics, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;An infectiously fun blend of special effects and comedy, with Bill Murray&#x27;s hilarious deadpan performance leading a cast of great comic turns&quot;. The film also has a score of 71 out of 100 on Metacritic based on eight critical reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

In 2001, the American Film Institute ranked &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; number 28 on its 100 Years...100 Laughs list recognizing the best comedy films. In 2009, &quot;National Review&quot; ranked &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; number 10 on its list of the 25 Best Conservative Movies of the Last 25 Years, noting the &quot;regulation-happy&quot; Environmental Protection Agency is portrayed as the villain and it is the private sector that saves the day. In November 2015, the screenplay was listed number 14 on the Writers Guild of America&#x27;s 101 Funniest Screenplays. In 2017, the BBC polled 253 critics (118 female, 135 male) from across 52 countries on the funniest film made. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; came ninety-fifth.

&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; is considered one of the best films of the 1980s, appearing on several lists based on this metric, including: number two by Film.com, number five by &quot;Time Out&quot;, number six by &quot;ShortList&quot;, number 15 by &quot;Complex&quot;, number 31 by &quot;Empire&quot;, and it appears on Filmsite&#x27;s non-ranked list. It also appeared on several media outlets&#x27; best comedy film lists—ranked number one by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, number four by &quot;IGN&quot;, number 10 by &quot;Empire&quot;, number 25 by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, and number 45 by Rotten Tomatoes, which also listed the film number 71 on its list of 200 essential movies to watch. Others have named it one of the best science-fiction films, best science-fiction comedies, and best summer blockbusters. Murray&#x27;s Peter Venkman appeared at number44 on &quot;Empire&quot;″s 2006 list of its &quot;100 Greatest Movie Characters&quot;.

== Sequels and adaptations ==
The film&#x27;s success spawned the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; franchise, comprising animated television shows, film sequels, and reboot. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was followed by the 1986 animated television series &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;. It ran for 140 episodes over seven seasons across six years, and itself spawned a spin-off Slimer-centric sub-series, comic books, and merchandise. It was followed by a sequel series, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot;. A film sequel, &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;, was released in 1989. Despite breaking box office records and attracting an estimated two million more people to its opening than &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, the sequel earned less than the original and received a less enthusiastic response. Even so, the popularity of the actors and characters led to discussion of a third film. The concept failed to progress for many years because Murray was reluctant to participate. In a 2009 interview, he said: We did [&quot;GhostbustersII&quot;] and it was sort of rather unsatisfying for me, because the first one to me was ... the real thing. And the sequel ... They’d written a whole different movie than the one [initially discussed]... so there&#x27;s never been an interest in a third &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, because the second one was disappointing ... for me, anyway. Aykroyd pursued a sequel through to the early 2010s. &quot;&quot; was released in 2009, featuring narrative contributions from Ramis and Aykroyd, and voice acting by Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Hudson, Potts, and Atherton. Set two years after &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;, the story follows the Ghostbusters training a recruit (the player) to combat a ghostly threat related to Gozer. The game was well-received, earning award nominations for its storytelling. Aykroyd has referred to the game as being &quot;essentially the third movie&quot;. &quot;Ghostbusters: The Return&quot; (2004) was the first in a planned series of sequel novels before the publisher went out of business. Several &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; comic books have continued the original group&#x27;s adventures across the globe and other dimensions.

Following Ramis&#x27;s death in 2014, Reitman determined the creative control shared by himself, Ramis, Aykroyd, and Murray was holding the franchise back and negotiated a deal to sell the rights to Columbia; he spent two weeks convincing Murray. Reitman refused to detail the deal but said &quot;the creators would be enriched for the rest of our lives, and for the rest of our children&#x27;s lives&quot;. He and Aykroyd founded Ghost Corps, a production company dedicated to expanding the franchise, starting with the 2016 female-led reboot &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (later retitled &quot;Ghostbusters: Answer the Call&quot;). Before its release, the reboot was beset by controversies. After its release, it was considered a box-office bomb with mixed reviews. The franchise returned to the original two films with the sequels, &quot;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&quot; (2021), directed by Reitman&#x27;s son Jason, and &quot;&quot; (2024).

<doc id="205017" wikidata="Q378222" url="?curid=205017" title="Whitespace (programming language)">
<text>Whitespace is an esoteric programming language with syntax where &quot;only&quot; whitespace characters (space, tab and linefeed) have meaning contrasting typical languages that largely ignore whitespace characters.
As a consequence of its syntax, Whitespace source code can be contained within the whitespace of code written in a language that ignores whitespace making the text a polyglot.

Whitespace is an imperative, stack-based language. 
The programmer can push arbitrary-width integer values onto a stack and access a heap to store data.

An interpreter, along with its Haskell source code, is provided by the Whitespace creators.

== History ==

Edwin Brady and Chris Morris, who also developed the Kaya and Idris languages, created Whitespace in 2002 at the University of Durham. 
Slashdot published a review on April Fool&#x27;s Day 2003.

The idea of using whitespace characters as operators for the C++ language had been facetiously suggested five years earlier by Bjarne Stroustrup.

== Syntax ==

Whitespace defines a command as a sequences of whitespace characters. For example, codice_1 performs arithmetic addition of the top two elements on the stack.

A command is written as an instruction modification parameter (IMP) followed by an operation and then any parameters.

IMP sequences include:

Operator sequences, organized by IMP, include:

*Due to Haskell being lazily evaluated, the effect of the stack being too small may only show when, for example, invoking the &quot;outputting a number&quot; side-effect.

**The &quot;copy&quot; and &quot;slide&quot; operations were added in Whitespace 0.3.

=== Comments ===

Characters other than codice_2, codice_3 and codice_4 are ignored and thus can be used for comments. 

=== Numbers ===

A numeric value is represented as a sequence of codice_2 and codice_3 characters that represent 0 and 1 respectively and terminated by a codice_4. The first character represents the sign of the value codice_2 for positive and codice_3 for negative. Subsequent characters before the terminator represent the binary digits of a value.

For example:

* [space][tab][space][space][tab][space][tab][tab][linefeed] (STSSTSTTL) is positive since it starts with codice_2 and represents 1001011 in binary, which is 75 in decimal.
* [tab][tab][tab][space][space][tab][space][linefeed] (TTTSSTSL) is negative since it starts with codice_3 and represents -110010 in binary which is −50 in decimal.

=== Labels ===

A label is used for control flow. It is a codice_4-terminated sequence of codice_2and codice_3 characters. As there is only one namespace, all labels must be unique.
==Sample code==

The following source code is for a Whitespace &quot;Hello, world!&quot; program. For clarity, it is annotated with codice_15, codice_16 and codice_17 before each
codice_2,
codice_3, and codice_4.

L:End_the_program
When Whitespace source code is displayed in some browsers, the horizontal spacing produced by a tab character is not fixed, but depends on its location in the text relative to the next horizontal tab stop. Depending on the software, tab characters may also get replaced by the corresponding variable number of space characters.

<doc id="205022" wikidata="Q575345" url="?curid=205022" title="Alan Dean Foster">
<text>Alan Dean Foster (born November 18, 1946) is an American writer of fantasy and science fiction. He has written several book series, more than 20 standalone novels, and many novelizations of film scripts.

==Career==
===&quot;Star Wars&quot;===
Foster was the ghostwriter of the original novelization of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which was credited solely to George Lucas. When asked if it was difficult for him to see Lucas get all the credit for &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Foster said, &quot;Not at all. It was George&#x27;s story idea. I was merely expanding upon it. Not having my name on the cover didn&#x27;t bother me in the least. It would be akin to a contractor demanding to have his name on a Frank Lloyd Wright house.&quot;

Foster also wrote the follow-up novel &quot;Splinter of the Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot; (1978), written with the intention of being adapted as a low-budget sequel to &quot;Star Wars&quot; if the film was unsuccessful. However, &quot;Star Wars&quot; was a blockbusting success, and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) would be developed instead. Foster&#x27;s story relied heavily on abandoned concepts that appeared in Lucas&#x27;s early treatments for the first film.

Foster returned to the franchise for the prequel-era novel &quot;The Approaching Storm&quot; (2002), and also wrote the novelization of the first sequel trilogy film, &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; (2015).

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===
Foster wrote 10 books based on episodes of the animated &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the first six books each consisting of three linked novella-length episode adaptations, and the last four being expanded adaptations of single episodes that segued into original story. In the mid-seventies, he wrote original &quot;Star Trek&quot; stories for the Peter Pan-label &quot;Star Trek&quot; audio story records. He has the story credit for &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, as he wrote a treatment based on a two-page outline by Gene Roddenberry.

He later wrote the novelization of the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;, his first &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel in over 30 years, and for &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s sequel, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;.

===Dispute with Disney===
In 2020, Foster, together with the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA), alleged that The Walt Disney Company, which acquired rights to his &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot; novels via their acquisitions of Lucasfilm and 20th Century Fox, had not paid him royalties for e-book sales of his books. The issue was resolved in May 2021, when Disney arranged to pay Foster and his fellow &quot;Star Wars&quot; novelization authors James Kahn and Donald F. Glut their royalties.

==Awards==
Foster won the 2008 Grand Master award from the International Association of Media Tie-In Writers.

<text>The South Bank is an entertainment and commercial area on the south bank of the River Thames, in the London Borough of Lambeth, central London, England.

The South Bank is not formally defined, but is generally understood to be situated between County Hall in the west to the Oxo Tower on the borough boundary with Southwark, to the east.

South Bank consists of a narrow strip of riverside land opposite the City of Westminster and adjoins the Albert Embankment to the west and Bankside in the London Borough of Southwark to the east. As such, the South Bank may be regarded as akin to the riverside part of an area known previously as Lambeth Marsh and North Lambeth.

Throughout its history, it has twice functioned as an entertainment district, interspersed by around a hundred years of wharfs, domestic industry and manufacturing being its dominant use. Change came in 1917 with the construction of County Hall at Lambeth replacing the Lion Brewery. 

The name South Bank was first widely used in 1951 during the Festival of Britain. The festival redefined the area as a place for arts and entertainment.

The area&#x27;s attractions includes the County Hall complex, the Sea Life London Aquarium, the London Dungeon, Jubilee Gardens and the London Eye, the Southbank Centre, Royal Festival Hall, National Theatre, and BFI Southbank. 

==History==
Before the Thames was embanked, this area of Lambeth was often flooded, so the area was slower to develop than the north bank of the Thames. 

Throughout its history, it has twice functioned as an entertainment district, interspersed by around a hundred years of wharfs, domestic industry and manufacturing being its dominant use.

During the Middle Ages this area developed as a place of entertainment outside the formal regulation of the City of London on the north bank; this included theatres, prostitution and bear-baiting. By the 18th century the more genteel entertainment of the pleasure gardens had developed. 

The shallow bank and mud flats were ideal locations for industry and docks and went on to develop as an industrial location in a patchwork of private ownership. The Queen&#x27;s Walk pedestrianised embankment is part of the Albert Embankment, built not only for public drainage but also to raise the whole tract of land to prevent flooding.

Change began in 1917 with the construction of County Hall, near North Lambeth&#x27;s Lower Marsh. which replaced the Lion Brewery. Its Coade stone symbol was retained and placed on a pedestal at Westminster Bridge and is known as the South Bank Lion. 

The construction of County Hall returned the first section of river frontage to public use. This was extended eastwards in 1951 when a considerable area was redeveloped for the Festival of Britain.

It was renamed &#x27;South Bank&#x27; as part of promoting the Festival. The legacy of the festival was mixed, with buildings and exhibits demolished to make way for Jubilee Gardens, while the Royal Festival Hall and The Queen&#x27;s Walk were retained as part of the Southbank Centre. 

During the years following the festival the arts and entertainment complex grew with additional facilities, including the Queen Elizabeth Hall, and other arts venues opened along the river such as the Royal National Theatre. The recent developments, particularly the South Bank Place project by Canary Wharf Homes, underscore the ongoing transformation of the South Bank into a vibrant residential and cultural hub, a trend that is set to continue with more riverside projects on the horizon.

==Geography==

The South Bank is not formally defined, but is generally understood to be situated between County Hall in the west to the Oxo Tower on the borough boundary with Southwark, to the east.

South Bank consists of a narrow strip of riverside land opposite the City of Westminster and adjoins the Albert Embankment to the west and Bankside in the London Borough of Southwark to the east. As such, the South Bank may be regarded as akin to the riverside part of an area known previously as Lambeth Marsh and North Lambeth.

There are public open space along the riverside, including Bernie Spain Gardens between the London Studios and the Oxo Tower. The gardens were named after Bernadette Spain, a local community activist who was part of the Coin Street Action Group.

==Cultural aspects==
The South Bank is a significant arts and entertainment district. The Southbank Centre comprises the Royal Festival Hall, the Queen Elizabeth Hall and The Hayward Gallery. The Royal National Theatre, the London IMAX super cinema and BFI Southbank adjoin to the east, but are not strictly part of the centre.

Polish-British visual chronicler and artist Feliks Topolski was provided a studio under one of the arches of Hungerford Bridge in 1951, where he worked consistently until his death in 1989. Topolski was commissioned to produce a 60ft by 20ft mural under the arch over Belvedere Road for the Festival of Britain, unknowingly painting only two arches up from his eventual studio.[6] Offered to him by David Eccles, it was not until 1953 and Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation, when the windows from the dismantled annex to Westminster Abbey were repurposed to fit Topolski&#x27;s studio. Over the years the studio became a central feature of the South Bank, hosting countless people at his &#x27;Open Studio&#x27; Fridays from 3pm, with an open door to whosever wished to pop their head in. Now the Studio functions as an archive and exhibition space operated by Topolski Memoir, the charity set up to preserve the artist&#x27;s legacy.

Topolski was provided with three further arches in 1975 by the Greater London Council (GLC), where he painted his epic 600ft long, 12-20ft high &#x27;Memoir of the Century&#x27;. Telling his broad-ranging experience of the 20th century, Topolski painted the work from 1975 until his death, writing that he hoped to die working on it, with a brush in his hand. It remained open until 2006 in its original state, working with students, but, due to its poor condition, underwent a £3,000,000 conservation and renovation program, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, private donations and several other grant bodies, and raised by the artist&#x27;s son, Daniel Topolski. Reopened by the Duke of Edinburgh in 2009, the Memoir only ran for a year due to commercial pressures and was converted into the Bar Topolski, where some of Topolski&#x27;s work can still be seen.

County Hall was converted into &quot;The London Marriott Hotel County Hall&quot;, Sea Life London Aquarium and the London Dungeon.

The OXO Tower Wharf at the eastern end of South Bank, houses Gallery@Oxo, shops and boutiques, and the OXO Tower Restaurant run by Harvey Nichols.
Gabriel&#x27;s Wharf is a redeveloped wharf on the South Bank, which has been converted into a shopping area. 

The London Studios, the former home of ITV faces the Thames and Rambert Dance Company have their new studios on Upper Ground. The Old Vic and Young Vic theatres are nearby.

The Florence Nightingale Museum to nursing, medicine and the Crimean War adjoins the &#x27;district&#x27;.

The undercroft of the Queen Elizabeth Hall has been used by skateboarders since the early 1970s. Originally an architectural dead-spot, it became a landmark of British skateboarding culture, but later was under threat, though supported by the Long Live Southbank campaign. Part of the Southbank Centre was turned into shops looking out over the river.

The South Bank was the main scene of the 1952 comedy film &quot;The Happy Family&quot;, set around the Festival of Britain.
==Transport==
Part of the success of the area as a visitor attraction is attributed to the high levels of public transport access. Several major railway terminals are within walking distance of the South Bank, on both sides of the river, including Waterloo, Charing Cross and Blackfriars. The London Underground has stations on or near the South Bank, from west to east, at Westminster, Waterloo, Embankment, Blackfriars and Southwark.

The development of the Thameslink Blackfriars railway station in the early 2010s, which has access from both the southern and northern side of the river, prompted the additional named signage &quot;for Bankside and South Bank&quot;. Accessibility to the north bank is high, with connections made, from west to east, over the Westminster, Golden Jubilee, Waterloo and Blackfriars bridges. The river is utilised as a means of transport with piers along the South Bank at the London Eye, Royal Festival Hall and Bankside.

<text>Field-Marshall was a brand of farm tractor which was manufactured by Marshall, Sons &amp; Co. of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire in the United Kingdom.

Field-Marshalls were in production from 1945 to 1957. However, the first single-cylinder Marshall came into production in 1930.

==Earlier Marshall tractor line ==

The first single-cylinder Marshall tractor to be introduced was the Marshall 15/30 in 1930. It had a bore with a stroke (= 8.237 litres) and the maximum speed was 550 r.p.m., or 9.1666 revolutions per second.
In 1932 the 15/30 was upgraded to become the Marshall 18/30. This model featured the same bore and stroke dimensions but the maximum r.p.m. was increased and the tractor&#x27;s transmission was heavily modified.

The next single-cylinder Marshall to be introduced was the Marshall 12/20 in 1935. This tractor was of a completely new design, with a -inch bore and a stroke (= 4.17 litres). There were many smaller modifications such as a redesigned injection pump and cylinder head.

In 1938 the 12/20 model was redesigned and the model coding was changed so that the new model became the Marshall Model &quot;M&quot; tractor. During World War II tractor production was reduced greatly due to Marshall&#x27;s factory capacity being engaged on war work. However, after the war, in 1945, Marshall&#x27;s of Gainsborough introduced the improved diesel-powered tractor they had developed as the &quot;Field-Marshall&quot;.

==Field-Marshall tractor==
The Field-Marshall and its Track Marshall tracked stable-mate (Marshall-engined Fowler VF and VFA), were distinctive because of the use of a single-cylinder two-stroke diesel engine (of about 6-litre capacity) coupled to a very large flywheel, whereas tractors such as the Fordson N used a multi-cylinder engine. This single-cylinder design was quite common in Europe at the time, the Lanz Bulldog being another example. The Lanz, though, used a hot bulb engine.

=== Field-Marshall timeline ===
* Field-Marshall Series 1 - 1945–1947 - 6 mph and 9 mph gearboxes available - Mark I &amp; II variants
* Field-Marshall Series 2 - 1947–1949 - 6 mph and 9 mph gearboxes available - Mark I &amp; II variants
* Field-Marshall Series 3 - 1949–1953 - 12 mph high and low gearbox
* Field-Marshall Series 3A - 1953–1957 - 12 mph high and low gearbox

===Starting===
To start the Marshall a smouldering piece of special paper, containing saltpetre, is inserted into the cylinder head by means of the special screw-in holder in the cylinder head (this smouldering paper acts as a glow plug).

The engine is then turned over with a starting handle placed in the starting dog on the flywheel. This is aided by the decompression valve, which decompresses the engine and makes it easier to turn over to allow the flywheel to gain speed and momentum to turn the engine through compression, and get the engine to fire. A spiral groove on the perimeter of the flywheel carries a wheel on the decompressor mechanism and is used to determine the number of revolutions before the decompressor disengages. This is generally up to three revolutions, but can be anything up to six revolutions. Depending on the condition of individual tractors, it may need considerable physical exertion to start a Marshall.

A cartridge starting system is also fitted to the tractor. A shotgun type blank cartridge is loaded into a breech on the engine&#x27;s intake system. The smouldering paper is placed in the cylinder head, and the cartridge is fired by tapping the base of the protruding firing pin with a hammer. This puts a charge into the bore, sending the piston through its stroke, bursting into life. This method, however, deposits carbon which often causes jamming of the decompression valve if cartridges are regularly used. It also puts significantly more strain on the engine.

Later versions of the Field-Marshall had more sophisticated starting systems available; electric starters were optional on the Series 3As.

===Applications===
The Field-Marshall tractors were commonly used to pull agricultural machinery such as threshing machines from site to site. Once in place, the Field-Marshall would be used as the powerplant for the threshing machine, the tractor&#x27;s belt pulley coupled by a large flat drive belt to the threshing machine&#x27;s pulley.

Field-Marshalls with tracks were produced under the Fowler brand name, being converted in the Fowler factory at Leeds. The first were designated the &quot;Fowler VF&quot;, later ones being &quot;VFA&quot;s.

==Mergers and subsequent demise==
Later the two firms would be drawn together and a large number of complicated take-overs by such firms as British Leyland led to the wheeled tractor concern being owned by Bentall Simplex in the early 80s. They brought with the company the whole Leyland wheeled tractor range which had previously been built at Bathgate (which itself had started out as a Nuffield Universal tractor site). These were then badge engineered into the &#x27;Marshall&#x27; range. The company even designed and built some totally new tractors but unfortunately due to the high costs and consequently high asking price, the tractors didn&#x27;t sell well and the company slipped under. In the end only the Track Marshall concern was left, although even this has since gone bankrupt.

In the 1970s about 700 &quot;Track Marshall&quot; tractors were imported into Australia and fitted with dozer blades. These machines were powered by a 4-cylinder Perkins diesel engine and were considered very reliable in their time. They steered through an unusual wet band brake system through a differential gear system. This is known as a &#x27;controlled differential&#x27;. It is impossible to stop one track, you pull the brake lever, the track slows down, the other track speeds up. This type of steering system absorbs a lot of power when turning. Several are still in use around the Northern Rivers area of NSW, Australia.

<text>Prince Sauryavong Savang (22 January 1937 – 2 January 2018) was the youngest son of King Sisavang Vatthana of Laos.

In 1965, he married Princess Dalavan and they had four children, Sthira Sauryavong, Dayavant Sauryavong, Balavant Sauryavong, and Krishnajina Sauryavong.

Control of the Kingdom of Laos was seized by communist forces in August 1975. In November 1975, the Prince escaped from Laos by swimming across the Mekong river to Thailand. He became head of the Laotian royal family and acted as regent for his nephew Crown Prince Soulivong Savang.

Prior to leaving Laos, he headed the Office of Crown Properties. He worked for Renault in France.

In September 1997, he and his nephews Crown Prince Soulivong Savang and Prince Thayavong Savang initiated a Royal Lao Conference in Seattle, United States, over three hundred Lao exiles and representatives of the Hmong community. A resolution was established at this historic meeting between the Lao and Hmong leaders and the royal family and it held the common goal to change &quot;the totalitarian regime to a genuine democratic system&quot;, and &quot;the reunification of the Lao people&quot;.

In July 2000, he came under harsh criticism from some quarters after allegedly ordering the Vang Tao raid; he denied prior knowledge of the military attack against the Communist government of Laos.

He worked along with other surviving members of the Laos royal family such as Prince Mangkra Souvannaphouma, Crown Prince Soulivong Savang and Prince Thayavong Savang to establish a constitutional monarchy in Laos.

He died in Paris on 2 January 2018.

<text>Inki is the lead character in an animated cartoon series of Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short films by animator Chuck Jones. Five Inki cartoons were made between 1939 and 1950.

==History and description==
Inki, created for Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of theatrical animated shorts, is a little African boy who usually dresses in a simple loincloth, armband, legband, earrings, and a bone through his hair. He never speaks. The character&#x27;s pickaninny look was designed by Disney veteran Bob Givens and was cleaned up by Charlie Thorson. The plot of the first cartoon focuses on little Inki hunting, oblivious to the fact that he himself is being hunted by a hungry lion.

Also central to the series is a minimalist and expressionless mynah bird, which Givens also designed and said he based on a bird he saw in Hawaii, spelled &quot;minah bird&quot; in the title of the third short. The bird, who is accompanied by Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;The Hebrides Overture&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Fingal&#x27;s Cave&quot;, utterly disregards any obstacles or dangers. The mynah bird, shown as nearly almighty, appears randomly in the films, always intervening against the other characters. Occasionally, the bird&#x27;s intervention benefits Inki by stopping Inki&#x27;s pursuers. Inki then tries to thank the bird, but the latter ends up being disrespectful to Inki, too. He does not talk at all, and is droopy eyed almost all the time. The Minah Bird made a cameo appearance in the &quot;Animaniacs&quot; episode &quot;Bad Mood Bobby&quot; in a pet shop when he kicks The Goodfeathers away in retaliation for the insults against him when they make fun of him in order to cheer up Bobby.

Comics historian Don Markstein wrote that the character&#x27;s racial stereotype &quot;led to [the series&#x27;] unpopularity with program directors and thence to its present-day obscurity.&quot; He noted that, &quot;The Minah Bird, which appears immensely powerful, [is] an accomplished trickster; and yet acts, when it acts at all, from motives which simply can not be fathomed&quot;. The series&#x27; director, Chuck Jones, said that these cartoons were baffling to everyone, including himself. He had no understanding of what the bird was supposed to do other than walk around. But the shorts were well-accepted by audiences. According to Terry Lindvall and Ben Fraser, Inki is an everyman who encounters mysterious forces of life. He serves as a symbol of all humanity, &quot;frustrated and rescued by the wonderfully inexplicable&quot;. According to Jones, &quot;he grew up sensitive to the feeling of minorities&quot; and so never set out to mock them. 

The series did not end due to outside pressure, but Warner Bros&#x27; cartoons dropped the use of racist caricatures at the end of the 1940s. Some of the last Warner cartoons with racial stereotypes were Bugs Bunny&#x27;s 1949 &quot;Which Is Witch&quot; and Daffy Duck&#x27;s 1949 short &quot;Wise Quackers&quot;; the last Inki cartoon was &quot;Caveman Inki&quot;, in 1950.

<doc id="205058" wikidata="Q234510" url="?curid=205058" title="Heisei era">
<text>The was the period of Japanese history corresponding to the reign of Emperor Emeritus Akihito from 8 January 1989 until his abdication on 30 April 2019. The Heisei era started on 8 January 1989, the day after the death of the Emperor Hirohito, when his son, Akihito, acceded to the throne as the 125th Emperor. In accordance with Japanese customs, Hirohito was posthumously renamed &quot;Emperor Shōwa&quot; on 31 January 1989. 

Thus, 1989 corresponds to Shōwa 64 up until 7 January and from 8 January. The Heisei era ended on 30 April 2019 (Heisei 31), with the abdication of Akihito from the Chrysanthemum Throne. It was succeeded by the Reiwa era as then-crown prince Naruhito ascended the throne on 1 May midnight local time.

== History and meaning ==

Shortly after the death of Emperor Hirohito on 7 January 1989, Keizō Obuchi, then-Chief Cabinet Secretary and later Prime Minister of Japan, hosted a press conference to announce the new era name &quot;Heisei&quot; for Emperor Akihito, and explained its meaning.

According to Obuchi, the name &quot;Heisei&quot; was taken from two Chinese history and philosophy books, namely &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; () and the &quot;Book of Documents&quot; (). In the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, a sentence appears in a section honoring the wise rule of the legendary Chinese Emperor Shun, reading &quot;&quot; (Kanbun: , &quot;Uchi tairaka ni soto naru&quot;, &quot;flat inside and outside&quot;). In the &quot;Book of Documents&quot;, the sentence &quot;&quot; (Kanbun: , &quot;Chi tairaka ni ten naru&quot;, &quot;the earth is perfect&quot;) appears. By combining both meanings, Heisei is intended to mean &quot;peace everywhere&quot;. The Heisei era went into effect at midnight local time on 8 January 1989.

In August 2016, Emperor Akihito gave a televised address to the nation, in which he expressed concern that his age would one day stop him from fulfilling his official duties. This was an implication of his wish to retire. The Japanese Diet passed a law in June 2017 to allow the throne to pass to Akihito&#x27;s son, Naruhito. After meeting with members of the Imperial House Council, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe announced that 30 April 2019 would be the date set for Akihito&#x27;s abdication. The Reiwa era corresponding to Naruhito&#x27;s reign began the next day.

== Events ==
1989 marked the culmination of one of the most rapid economic growth spurts in Japanese history. With a dramatically strengthened yen after the 1985 Plaza Accord, the Bank of Japan kept interest rates low, sparking an investment boom that drove Tokyo property values up 60 percent within that year. Shortly before New Year&#x27;s Day, the Tokyo Stock Market index, Nikkei 225, reached its record high of 38,957. By 1992, it had fallen to 15,000, signifying the end of Japan&#x27;s famed &quot;bubble economy&quot;. Subsequently, Japan experienced the &quot;Lost Decade&quot;, which actually consisted of more than ten years of price deflation and largely stagnant GDP as Japan&#x27;s banks struggled to resolve their bad debts and companies in other sectors struggled to restructure.

The Recruit scandal of 1988 had already eroded public confidence in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which had controlled the Japanese government for 38 years. In 1993, the LDP was ousted by a coalition led by Morihiro Hosokawa. However, the coalition collapsed as parties had gathered only to overthrow LDP, and lacked a unified position on almost every social issue. The LDP returned to the government in 1994, when it helped to elect Japan Socialist (later Social Democrat) Tomiichi Murayama as prime minister.

The 1990s had an &quot;anime boom&quot; period marked by increased popularity of anime and anime conventions. Several anime media franchises gained global popularity such as &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;Hello Kitty&quot;, &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;, &quot;Gundam&quot;, &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh&quot; and &quot;Evangelion&quot;.

In 1995, there was a large 6.8 earthquake in Kobe, Hyōgo and sarin gas terrorist attacks were carried out on the Tokyo Metro by the doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo. Failure of the Japanese government to react to these events promptly led to the formation of non-government organisations which have been playing an increasingly important role in Japanese politics since.

On 11 December 1997, the international treaty called the Kyoto Protocol to regulate greenhouse gas emissions was adopted by 192 parties in Kyoto, Japan.

During this era, Japan reemerged as a military power. In 1991, Japan made a financial contribution of $10 billion and sent military hardware for the Gulf War. However, Article 9 of the Constitution prevented a participation in the actual war, leading Iran to criticize Japan for just pledging money and did not appreciate the way Japan co-operated in the Gulf War. However, after the war, between 26 April and October 1991 six JMSDF minesweeper vessels were sent and removed 34 sea mines in the Persian Gulf to improve the safety of ships.

Following the Iraq War, in 2003, Prime Minister Junichirō Koizumi&#x27;s Cabinet approved a plan to send about 1,000 soldiers of the Japan Self-Defense Forces to help in Iraq&#x27;s reconstruction, the biggest overseas troop deployment since World War II without the sanction of the UN. The mission lasted until February 2009.

The 2002 FIFA World Cup was the first FIFA World Cup to be held in Asia, the first to be held outside of the Americas or Europe, as well as the first to be jointly-hosted by more than one nation. This world championship for men&#x27;s national football teams was jointly hosted by Japan and South-Korea to improve relations.

On 23 October 2004, the Heisei 16 an earthquake and aftershocks rocked the Hokuriku region in Niigata Prefecture, killing 52 and injuring hundreds.

In November 2005, The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)&#x27;s robotic spacecraft Hayabusa landed on an asteroid and collected samples in the form of tiny grains of asteroidal material, which were returned to Earth aboard the spacecraft on 13 June 2010. It was the first spacecraft in history designed to deliberately land on an asteroid and then take off again. The Hayabusa mission was the first to return an asteroid sample to Earth for analysis.

After an election defeat, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe resigned suddenly, and in Autumn 2007 Yasuo Fukuda became prime minister. Fukuda in turn resigned in September 2008 citing political failings, and Tarō Asō was selected by his party.

In 2008, Greater Tokyo has the largest metropolitan economy in the world with a total GDP (nominal) of approximately $2 trillion (¥165 trillion). Greater Tokyo also has the largest metropolitan population in the world with an estimated 35 million.

In August 2009, for the first time, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) won 308 seats in the lower house election, which ended 50 years of political domination by the LDP. As a result of the election, Tarō Asō resigned as leader of the LDP, and Yukio Hatoyama, president of DPJ became prime minister on 16 September 2009. However, DPJ soon became mired in party financing scandals, particularly involving aides close to Ichirō Ozawa. Naoto Kan was chosen by the DPJ as the next prime minister, but he soon lost a working majority in the House of Councillors election, and the 2010 Senkaku boat collision incident caused increased tension between Japan and China. The 2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls also took place during this time.

The population of Japan peaked at 128 million in 2010. This was Japan&#x27;s biggest population in history. It declined due to a low birthrate in the following years.

In July 2010, The JSDF&#x27;s first postwar overseas base was established in Djibouti.

In December 2010, Japan&#x27;s 2010 National Defense Program Guidelines changed its defense policy from a focus on the former Soviet Union to China.

In 2011, the economy of China became the second largest in the world. Japan&#x27;s economy descended to the world&#x27;s third largest by nominal GDP.

In 2011, a sumo tournament was cancelled for the first time in 65 years over a match fixing scandal.
In March 2011, the Tokyo Skytree became the tallest tower in the world. and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa.
On 11 March 2011 at 2:46 p.m., Japan was hit by the Tōhoku earthquake of a magnitude scale of 9.0, the strongest recorded earthquake in its history, affecting places in the three regions of Tohoku, Chubu and Kanto in the northeast of Honshu, including the Tokyo area. A tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters (32.5 feet) flooded inland areas several kilometers from shore, causing a large number of considerable fires. The epicenter of the quake lay so close to coastal villages and towns that thousands could not flee in time despite the tsunami warning system, and also, Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and three other nuclear power plants, serious problems occurred with the cooling systems, ultimately leading to the most serious case of radioactive contamination since the Chernobyl disaster (see Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster), as well as ongoing electric power shortages. Following the earthquake, for the first time, the Emperor addressed the nation in a pre-recorded television broadcast.

In August 2011, Naoto Kan resigned, and Yoshihiko Noda became prime minister. Later that year Olympus Corporation admitted major accounting irregularities. (See Tobashi scheme.) Noda pushed for Japan to consider joining the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership, but was defeated in an election in 2012, being replaced by Shinzo Abe.
In January 2013, Shinzo Abe&#x27;s government introduced economic reforms in response to the consequences of the Lost Decade and Japan&#x27;s aging demographic crisis.

In the first half of 2014, The Toyota became the biggest automaker in the world selling 5.1 million vehicles in the six months ending 30 June 2014, an increase of 3.8% on the same period the previous year. Volkswagen AG recorded sales of 5.07 million vehicles.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sought to end deflation, but Japan entered recession again in 2014 largely due to a rise in sales tax to 8%. Abe called an election in December, and promised to delay further sales tax hikes to 2018. He won the election.

On 18 September 2015, the National Diet enacted the 2015 Japanese military legislation that allows the Japan Self-Defense Forces to collective self-defense of allies in combat for the first time under the 1947 constitution.

In October 2015, the Japan Self-Defense Forces were ranked as the world&#x27;s fourth most-powerful military in conventional capabilities in a Credit Suisse report.

A United Nations report confirmed that Greater Tokyo is the most populous metropolitan area in the world with an estimated total population of 38,140,000 in 2016.

In 2018, Pokémon became the highest-grossing media franchise of all time with an estimated $90 billion revenue. Pokémon surpassed the number 2 Hello Kitty ($80 billion) and the number 5 Star Wars ($65 billion).

A record number of 31,191,929 foreign tourists visited Japan in 2018. This is a 33% increase over 2015 (19.73 million). In 2017, 3 out of 4 foreign tourists came from South Korea, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization.

Japan activated the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade, its first marine unit since World War II, on 7 April 2018. They are trained to counter invaders from occupying Japanese islands.

Japan was the world&#x27;s largest creditor nation since 1990 and for 22 years straight. By 2018, Japan regained the leading position as the predominant source of saving and investments. Japan owned net global assets of ¥328 trillion, Germany (¥262 trillion), China (¥205 trillion).

In September 2018, Naomi Osaka became the first Japanese woman to contest a Grand Slam singles final and the first Japanese Grand Slam singles champion. Naomi Osaka was the winner of the 2018 US Open Women&#x27;s Singles.

In 2018, extraordinarily heavy rainfall in Western Japan led to many deaths in Hiroshima and Okayama. Also, an earthquake struck Hokkaido, killing 41 and causing a region-wide blackout.

The first JSDF dispatch to a peacekeeping operation that was not led by the United Nations was approved in April 2019. Two JGSDF officers were despatched to monitor a cease-fire between Israel and Egypt at the Multinational Force and Observers command in the Sinai peninsula from 19 April till 30 November 2019.

== Economy ==

The country&#x27;s economy suffered from prolonged stagnation, and both real wages and price levels experienced a decline during the period. According to IMF estimates, the country&#x27;s GDP per capita was $39,953, the third highest in the world, in 1994. In 2019, the last year of the Heisei era, it was $40,548, which ranked 27th.

<doc id="205060" wikidata="Q3493751" url="?curid=205060" title="Sponge (band)">
<text>Sponge is an American rock band formed in Detroit, Michigan, in 1992 by vocalist Vinnie Dombroski, guitarist Mike Cross, bassist Tim Cross, drummer Jimmy Paluzzi, and guitarist Joey Mazzola. Dombroski and the Cross brothers were previously in the hard rock band Loudhouse, with Mazzola joining later before the end of the band&#x27;s tenure. Sponge&#x27;s discography includes ten studio albums, four live albums, and several charting singles. They are best known for their 1994 hit &quot;Plowed&quot;, their 1995 hit &quot;Molly (16 Candles Down the Drain)&quot;, and their 1996 hit &quot;Wax Ecstatic (To Sell Angelina)&quot;.

Sponge has undergone several lineup changes throughout the band&#x27;s history, with founder and frontman Dombroski serving as the band&#x27;s sole constant member. The band released their tenth studio album, &quot;1994&quot;, in 2024.

==History==
===Formation, &quot;Rotting Piñata&quot;, and &quot;Wax Ecstatic&quot; (1991–1998)===
Vinnie Dombroski, Mike Cross, and Tim Cross were in a hard rock band called Loudhouse, fronted by vocalist Kenny Mugwump. They released one album and had a song appear on the soundtrack to the 1991 film &quot;Point Break&quot;. The band then recruited Joey Mazzola as a second guitarist. Shortly after, Mugwump decided to pursue a career in acting and directing, so Dombroski switched from drums to vocals and drummer Jimmy Paluzzi was recruited to round out the lineup. The band decided to start fresh and named themselves Sponge. They began working on new music and performed in bars and clubs; recognized for having a dual-guitar sound reminiscent of the MC5. Their debut album, &quot;Rotting Piñata&quot;, was released in August 1994 through Work Group. Sponge embarked on their first national tour around the time of &quot;Rotting Piñata&quot;&#x27;s release alongside Failure, Inch, and Rust. The tour was noted as being a &quot;Pre-Palooza Party&quot; for the 1994 incarnation of Lollapalooza. Sponge made their television debut on October 18 as they appeared on &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot;. The songs &quot;Neenah Menasha&quot; and &quot;Plowed&quot; were released as the first and second singles respectively off of &quot;Rotting Piñata&quot;, with &quot;Plowed&quot; entering the Mainstream Rock chart on November 19. By the end of 1994, Charlie Grover replaced Paluzzi on drums.

Sponge toured with Live, Love Spit Love, and Soundgarden in 1995, and also performed at the music festivals Edgefest, Rock am Ring (Germany), X-Fest, Sunstroke (Ireland), and Pukkelpop (Belgium) that year. &quot;Plowed&quot;, along with the third single that was released, &quot;Molly (16 Candles Down the Drain)&quot;, received heavy airplay on radio and MTV, and the album was certified gold by the RIAA on July 14, 1995. The fourth single, &quot;Rainin&#x27;&quot;, was released in October 1995 and had moderate success on the Mainstream Rock and Alternative Songs charts. Ultimately, &quot;Rotting Piñata&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in February 1995, peaked at No. 58 in May, and stayed on the chart for 40 weeks overall.

Throughout 1995 and 1996, the band also performed on several late-night talk shows, including &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot; (for a second time), &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; (with Kay Hanley of Letters to Cleo as a guest vocalist). On June 28, 1996, Sponge, along with Alice in Chains, opened for Kiss at Tiger Stadium in Detroit on their reunion tour. It was previously announced that Stone Temple Pilots would open the show, but had to cancel their performance due to vocalist Scott Weiland&#x27;s issues related to substance abuse. The show was reported as having an attendance of almost 40,000 people. Sponge&#x27;s second album, &quot;Wax Ecstatic&quot;, was released shortly after in 1996 and the first single, &quot;Wax Ecstatic (To Sell Angelina)&quot;, received significant airplay on radio and MTV. Sponge also performed on the Lollapalooza festival tour that summer. The second single, &quot;Have You Seen Mary&quot;, also received significant airplay and was included in the 1997 film &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;. Around this time, Sponge&#x27;s manager Susan Silver retired from the music business to focus on her family. Columbia was dissatisfied with the sales figures for &quot;Wax Ecstatic&quot; and dropped Sponge from the label once the album left the charts, despite the fact that Sponge had a third album nearly finished. Undaunted, the band continued making music while in search of a new label.

===&quot;New Pop Sunday&quot; and lineup changes (1999–2002)===
Sponge signed a new deal with Beyond Records and released their third album, &quot;New Pop Sunday&quot;, in 1999. The album was a departure from the grittier sound of their first two albums, featuring songs that were more pop rock in nature. The band also performed again at Edgefest and X-Fest that year. There wasn&#x27;t much tour support from Beyond and the new album attracted little commercial attention; however, &quot;Live Here Without You&quot; was nominated for the Outstanding National Single award by the Detroit Music Awards Foundation in 2000. Around this time, the Cross brothers had gotten tired of touring and left Sponge. Charlie Grover also left shortly after and the band would go on a brief hiatus. The remaining members (Mazzola and Dombroski) recruited Robby Graham on bass along with Paluzzi on drums to form the side project group Crud.

In 2001, Dombroski was invited by Alice in Chains drummer Sean Kinney to jam with him in Seattle, along with bandmate Mike Inez on bass and Queensrÿche guitarist Chris DeGarmo. The supergroup independently recorded and released an EP entitled &quot;Microfish&quot; under the name Spys4Darwin. They performed at Endfest on August 4, 2001 and continued working together into the following year. Around this time, Dombroski also began performing and recording music with the side project group The Orbitsuns. It was also around this time that members of Crud (Dombroski, Mazzola, Paluzzi, and Graham) began performing as Sponge, but only for a handful of local shows. Dombroski and Mazzola then created a new solidified lineup of Sponge consisting of drummer Billy Adams, guitarist Kurt Marschke, and bassist Tim Krukowski.

===&quot;For All the Drugs in the World&quot;, more lineup changes, and &quot;The Man&quot; (2003–2006)===
Sponge released their fourth studio album, &quot;For All the Drugs in the World&quot;, in 2003 through Idol Records. The album includes songs that were previously released independently by Sponge on an EP of the same name, which was only available at shows and on their website. The band toured with Soul Asylum, Gin Blossoms, Spin Doctors, The Verve Pipe, and The Presidents of the United States of America that year. Around this time, Dombroski created a new lineup once again, this time without other founding member Mazzola, replaced by guitarist Andy Patalan, while Marschke was replaced by guitarist Kyle Neely. At this point, Dombroski became the only remaining original member of Sponge. The band released another EP independently in 2005, entitled &quot;Hard to Keep My Cool&quot;.
Sponge&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;The Man&quot;, was also released in 2005 and includes songs from &quot;Hard to Keep My Cool&quot; plus new tracks. Both Crud and The Orbitsuns also released albums around this time.

===&quot;Galore Galore&quot; and &quot;Stop the Bleeding&quot; (2007–2014)===
In November 2007, Sponge announced that they would release their sixth studio album, &quot;Galore Galore&quot;, through their new label, Bellum Records. The album was released on December 4, 2007. In 2009, former Sponge producer Tim Patalan replaced Krukowski on bass. The band then independently released an EP entitled &quot;Destroy the Boy&quot;. The title track was co-written by Mazzola, the first time a former member had contributed to Sponge&#x27;s new material. In 2010, the video games &quot;Tony Hawk: Shred&quot; and &quot;Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock&quot; were released; the former features the original version of &quot;Plowed&quot; and the latter features a re-recorded version that is available as a downloadable song. Sponge performed with Alice in Chains, Everclear, Seven Mary Three, and Marcy Playground in 2010 and also performed at EarthFest on May 21, 2011. On February 21, 2012, Sponge opened for Guns N&#x27; Roses at The Fillmore Detroit during their tour that year. Sponge&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Stop the Bleeding&quot;, was released in 2013 and includes songs from &quot;Destroy the Boy&quot; plus new tracks. Sponge performed on the Summerland festival tour and also toured with Spacehog that year. In 2014, Sponge won the Detroit Music Awards Foundation&#x27;s Outstanding National Single award for &quot;Come in From the Rain&quot;.

===&quot;The Beer Sessions&quot;, original lineup reunion performance, &quot;Lavatorium&quot;, and &quot;1994&quot; (2015–present)===
Sponge continued recording new music and performed on the Summerland festival tour again in 2016. The band&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;The Beer Sessions&quot;, was released on October 8, 2016 through Three One Three Records. In May 2018 at the annual Detroit Music Awards, the original lineup of Vinnie Dombroski, Mike Cross, Tim Cross, Jimmy Paluzzi, and Joey Mazzola reunited for one night only. This was the first time in 24 years that all of the original members performed on stage together. The group received the Distinguished Achievement award at the ceremony in recognition of their debut album, &quot;Rotting Piñata&quot;. Sponge partnered with the Pope Francis Center in 2018 to help raise funds for the poor and homeless in Detroit. The band performed at Howard Stern&#x27;s SiriusXM studio and toured with The Nixons in 2019. 
Sponge also announced tour dates in North America during the spring and summer of 2020. However, the shows were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the aim to reschedule them for a later date. In August 2020, Jason Hartless replaced longtime member Adams on drums. Sponge released a music video for the song &quot;Stitch&quot;, directed by James L. Edwards, on July 6, 2021. On August 6, 2021, Sponge released their ninth studio album, &quot;Lavatorium&quot;, through Cleopatra Records. Around this time, Dave Coughlin replaced Hartless on drums. Sponge performed with Blue October, Gin Blossoms, and Fastball in 2021. On March 6, 2022, founding guitarist Mike Cross died at the age of 57.

On April 20, 2024, Sponge partnered with Sound City Records to release &quot;Planet Girls&quot;, their &quot;lost album&quot; previously slated to be released in 1998 before being shelved by Beyond Records. Sponge ultimately re-recorded various tracks off of &quot;Planet Girls&quot;, added in additional songs, and then changed the name to &quot;New Pop Sunday&quot; for its 1999 release.

Sponge released their tenth studio album, &quot;1994&quot;, on October 18, 2024. The tracklist contains cover songs of alternative rock bands, all of which were originally released in 1994.

In fall 2024 Sponge released three music videos in support of their covers album titled &quot;1994&quot;; The More You Ignore Me, the Closer I Get (Morrissey cover) directed by Drew Fortier, Fade into You (Mazzy Star cover) co-directed by Hannah Fierman &amp; Fortier, and No Excuses (Alice in Chains cover) directed by Fortier.

==Musical style and influences==
AllMusic described Sponge&#x27;s sound as being a &quot;versatile blend of classic hard rock and punchy alt-pop with a thin metal veneer&quot;. Some of the bands and artists that Sponge has cited as influences include
the MC5, The Stooges, Iggy Pop, David Bowie, The Velvet Underground, Alice Cooper, Bob Seger, Aerosmith, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, the Sex Pistols, The Clash, Fear, The Psychedelic Furs, and Hank Williams. In concert Sponge has also performed songs by Danny Davis and the Nashville Brass, the Ramones, Lou Reed, AC/DC, and Pink Floyd.

<text>The Censored Eleven is a group of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons originally produced and released by Warner Bros. between 1931 and 1951. All of them have been withheld from syndication in the United States by United Artists (UA) since 1968. UA owned the distribution rights to the Associated Artists Productions library at that time, and decided to pull these 11 cartoons from broadcast because the use of ethnic stereotypes in the cartoons, specifically African and African-American stereotypes, was deemed too offensive for contemporary audiences. 

The ban has been continued by UA and the successive owners of the pre-August 1948 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;/&quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;. , these shorts have not been officially broadcast on television and have only been exhibited theatrically by Warner Bros. once (in 2010, see below for more details) since their withdrawal. They have turned up, however, on low-cost VHS and DVD collections.

== Background ==
The cartoon output of Warner Bros. during its most active period sometimes had censorship problems more complex in some respects than those of features. Unlike feature films, which were routinely censored in the script, the animated shorts were passed upon only when completed, which made the producers exceptionally cautious as to restrictions. In 1983, director Chuck Jones commented on the television censorship of the Warner Bros. cartoons: &quot;I don&#x27;t like to see the films cut at all. [...] They make some cuts that are so arbitrary and stupid, you can&#x27;t believe it.&quot; Independent stations that once ran the syndicated Warner Bros. cartoons never had the same type of censorship as first-run networks such as ABC and CBS did for the cartoons. Some stations owned syndication rights to &quot;a few they consider[ed] racially stereotypical&quot;, but never ran them.

When Ted Turner obtained the rights to the pre-1950 Warner Bros. library from MGM/UA Entertainment Co. in 1986, he vowed that he would not distribute or air any cartoons from the Censored Eleven. They were the only cartoons in this package not to be featured in the LaserDisc series &quot;The Golden Age of Looney Tunes&quot;. Warner Bros. Pictures currently owns the theatrical distribution on behalf of Turner Entertainment Co., while Amazon MGM Studios currently owns the home video distribution on behalf of United Artists to the Censored Eleven cartoons.

== Censored Eleven list ==
Friz Freleng directed the largest number of cartoons on the list with four, followed by Tex Avery with three, and Bob Clampett with only two. Rudolf Ising, like Jones, only has one cartoon on the list. &quot;Angel Puss&quot; is the only cartoon directed by Jones on the list, as well as the only &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon on the list. &quot;Hittin&#x27; the Trail to Hallelujah Land&quot; is the only black-and-white short on the list, and the only cartoon to star Piggy. &quot;Goldilocks and the Jivin&#x27; Bears&quot; is the only cartoon on this list not to be produced by Leon Schlesinger. It is also the first to be produced by an uncredited Eddie Selzer. &quot;All This and Rabbit Stew&quot; is the only Bugs Bunny cartoon on the list. &quot;The Isle of Pingo Pongo&quot; is also the only Elmer Fudd cartoon on the list. The other eight are one-shot cartoons.

== Public awareness in the 21st century ==
As the 20th century came to a close, the Censored Eleven cartoons became better known. 

In February 2010, as part of a press release for the first annual TCM Classic Film Festival, it was announced that the Censored Eleven were to receive a special screening sourced from restored 35mm film prints. This special presentation was put together by George Feltenstein, vice president of Warner Bros.&#x27; classic film catalog. Film historian Donald Bogle, who has six books published to his credit on the subject of African American stereotypes in film, agreed to host the event for the festival. On April 24, 2010, a total of eight of the Censored Eleven were screened at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood; the three that were not shown at the event were &quot;Jungle Jitters&quot;, &quot;All This and Rabbit Stew&quot; and &quot;Angel Puss&quot;.

== Canceled official release ==
At the New York Comic Con in October 2010, Warner Bros. confirmed that it would be releasing the Censored Eleven completely uncut on DVD through the &quot;Warner Archives&quot; program sometime in 2011. On December 1, 2010, animation expert Jerry Beck announced on the Shokus Internet Radio call-in talk program &quot;Stu&#x27;s Show&quot; that there were plans for a general traditional retail release and not via the Warner Archives. It would be a high-class release featuring all of the Censored Eleven and other rare cartoons restored, with some bonus materials. However, no further news of a DVD release has surfaced since. In 2016, Jerry Beck stated that the transfers had been done, but the DVD release had been delayed indefinitely due to declining sales of previous &quot;Looney Tunes Platinum Collection&quot; releases.

<text>A teacher, also called a schoolteacher or formally an educator, is a person who helps students to acquire knowledge, competence, or virtue, via the practice of teaching.

&quot;Informally&quot; the role of teacher may be taken on by anyone (e.g. when showing a colleague how to perform a specific task). 
In some countries, teaching young people of school age may be carried out in an informal setting, such as within the family (homeschooling), rather than in a formal setting such as a school or college. 
Some other professions may involve a significant amount of teaching (e.g. youth worker, pastor).

In most countries, &quot;formal&quot; teaching of students is usually carried out by paid professional teachers. This article focuses on those who are &quot;employed&quot;, as their main role, to teach others in a &quot;formal&quot; education context, such as at a school or other place of &quot;initial&quot; formal education or training.

==Duties and functions==
A teacher&#x27;s role may vary among cultures.

Teachers may provide instruction in literacy and numeracy, craftsmanship or vocational training, the arts, religion, civics, community roles, or life skills.

Formal teaching tasks include preparing lessons according to agreed curricula, giving lessons, and assessing pupil progress.

A teacher&#x27;s professional duties may extend beyond formal teaching. Outside of the classroom teachers may accompany students on field trips, supervise study halls, help with the organization of school functions, and serve as supervisors for extracurricular activities. They also have the legal duty to protect students from harm, such as that which may result from bullying, sexual harassment, racism or abuse.
In some education systems, teachers may be responsible for student discipline.

==Competences and qualities required by teachers==

Teaching is a highly complex activity.
This is partially because teaching is a social practice, that takes place in a specific context (time, place, culture, socioeconomic situation etc.) and therefore is shaped by the values of that specific context. Factors that influence what is expected (or required) of teachers include history and tradition, social views about the purpose of education, accepted theories about learning, etc.

===Competences===
The competences required by a teacher are affected by the different ways in which the role is understood around the world. Broadly, there seem to be four models: 
:the teacher as manager of instruction; 
:the teacher as caring person; 
:the teacher as expert learner; and 
:the teacher as cultural and civic person.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has argued that it is necessary to develop a shared definition of the skills and knowledge required by teachers, in order to guide teachers&#x27; career-long education and professional development. Some evidence-based international discussions have tried to reach such a common understanding. For example, the European Union has identified three broad areas of competences that teachers require:
:Working with others
:Working with knowledge, technology, and information, and
:Working in and with society.

Scholarly consensus is emerging that what is required of teachers can be grouped under three headings:
:knowledge (such as: the subject matter itself and knowledge about how to teach it, curricular knowledge, knowledge about the educational sciences, psychology, assessment etc.) 
:craft skills (such as lesson planning, using teaching technologies, managing students and groups, monitoring and assessing learning etc.) and 
:dispositions (such as essential values and attitudes, beliefs and commitment).

===Qualities===

====Enthusiasm====

It has been found that teachers who showed enthusiasm towards the course materials and students can create a positive learning experience. These teachers do not teach by rote but attempt to invigorate their teaching of the course materials every day. Teachers who cover the same curriculum repeatedly may find it challenging to maintain their enthusiasm, lest their boredom with the content bore their students in turn. Enthusiastic teachers are rated higher by their students than teachers who did not show much enthusiasm for the course materials.

Teachers that exhibit enthusiasm are more likely to have engaged, interested and energetic students who are curious about learning the subject matter. Recent research has found a correlation between teacher enthusiasm and students&#x27; intrinsic motivation to learn and vitality in the classroom. Controlled, experimental studies exploring intrinsic motivation of college students has shown that nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm, such as demonstrative gesturing, dramatic movements which are varied, and emotional facial expressions, result in college students reporting higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn. But even while a teacher&#x27;s enthusiasm has been shown to improve motivation and increase task engagement, it does not necessarily improve learning outcomes or memory for the material.

There are various mechanisms by which teacher enthusiasm may facilitate higher levels of intrinsic motivation. 
Teacher enthusiasm may contribute to a classroom atmosphere of energy and enthusiasm which feeds student interest and excitement in learning the subject matter. Enthusiastic teachers may also lead to students becoming more self-determined in their own learning process. The concept of mere exposure indicates that the teacher&#x27;s enthusiasm may contribute to the student&#x27;s expectations about intrinsic motivation in the context of learning. Also, enthusiasm may act as a &quot;motivational embellishment&quot;, increasing a student&#x27;s interest by the variety, novelty, and surprise of the enthusiastic teacher&#x27;s presentation of the material. Finally, the concept of emotional contagion may also apply: students may become more intrinsically motivated by catching onto the enthusiasm and energy of the teacher.

====Interaction with learners====
Research shows that student motivation and attitudes towards school are closely linked to student-teacher relationships. Enthusiastic teachers are particularly good at creating beneficial relations with their students. Their ability to create effective learning environments that foster student achievement depends on the kind of relationship they build with their students. Useful teacher-to-student interactions are crucial in linking academic success with personal achievement. Here, personal success is a student&#x27;s internal goal of improving themselves, whereas academic success includes the goals they receive from their superior. A teacher must guide their student in aligning their personal goals with their academic goals. Students who receive this positive influence show stronger self-confidence and greater personal and academic success than those without these teacher interactions.

Students are likely to build stronger relations with teachers who are friendly and supportive and will show more interest in courses taught by these teachers. Teachers that spend more time interacting and working directly with students are perceived as supportive and effective teachers. Effective teachers have been shown to invite student participation and decision making, allow humor into their classroom, and demonstrate a willingness to play.

==Teaching qualifications==
In many countries, a person who wishes to become a teacher must first obtain specified professional qualifications or credentials from a university or college. These professional qualifications may include the study of pedagogy, the science of teaching. 
Teachers, like other professionals, may have to, or choose to, continue their education after they qualify, a process known as continuing professional development.

The issue of teacher qualifications is linked to the status of the profession. In some societies, teachers enjoy a status on a par with physicians, lawyers, engineers, and accountants, in others, the status of the profession is low. In the twentieth century, many intelligent women were unable to get jobs in corporations or governments so many chose teaching as a default profession. As women become more welcomed into corporations and governments today, it may be more difficult to attract qualified teachers in the future.

Teachers are often required to undergo a course of initial education at a College of Education to ensure that they possess the necessary knowledge, competences and adhere to relevant codes of ethics.

There are a variety of bodies designed to instill, preserve and update the knowledge and professional standing of teachers. Around the world many teachers&#x27; colleges exist; they may be controlled by government or by the teaching profession itself.

They are generally established to serve and protect the public interest through certifying, governing, quality controlling, and enforcing standards of practice for the teaching profession.

===Professional standards===
The functions of the teachers&#x27; colleges may include setting out clear standards of practice, providing for the ongoing education of teachers, investigating complaints involving members, conducting hearings into allegations of professional misconduct and taking appropriate disciplinary action and accrediting teacher education programs. In many situations teachers in publicly funded schools must be members in good standing with the college, and private schools may also require their teachers to be college members. In other areas these roles may belong to the State Board of Education, the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the State Education Agency or other governmental bodies. In still other areas Teaching Unions may be responsible for some or all of these duties.

====Professional misconduct====
Misconduct by teachers, especially sexual misconduct, has been getting increased scrutiny from the media and the courts. A study by the American Association of University Women reported that 9.6% of students in the United States claim to have received unwanted sexual attention from an adult associated with education; be they a volunteer, bus driver, teacher, administrator or other adult; sometime during their educational career.

A study in England showed a 0.3% prevalence of sexual abuse by any professional, a group that included priests, religious leaders, and case workers as well as teachers. It is important to note, however, that this British study is the only one of its kind and consisted of &quot;a random ... probability sample of 2,869 young people between the ages of 18 and 24 in a computer-assisted study&quot; and that the questions referred to &quot;sexual abuse with a professional,&quot; not necessarily a teacher. It is therefore logical to conclude that information on the percentage of abuses by teachers in the United Kingdom is not explicitly available and therefore not necessarily reliable. The AAUW study, however, posed questions about fourteen types of sexual harassment and various degrees of frequency and included only abuses by teachers. &quot;The sample was drawn from a list of 80,000 schools to create a stratified two-stage sample design of 2,065 8th to 11th grade students&quot;. Its reliability was gauged at 95% with a 4% margin of error.

In the United States especially, several high-profile cases such as Debra LaFave, Pamela Rogers Turner, and Mary Kay Letourneau have caused increased scrutiny on teacher misconduct.

Chris Keates, the general secretary of National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said that teachers who have sex with pupils over the age of consent should not be placed on the sex offenders register and that prosecution for statutory rape &quot;is a real anomaly in the law that we are concerned about.&quot; This has led to outrage from child protection and parental rights groups. Fears of being labelled a pedophile or hebephile has led to several men who enjoy teaching avoiding the profession. This has in some jurisdictions reportedly led to a shortage of male teachers.

==Pedagogy and teaching==


Teachers facilitate student learning, often in a school or academy or perhaps in another environment such as outdoors.

The objective is typically accomplished through either an informal or formal approach to learning, including a course of study and lesson plan that teaches skills, knowledge or thinking skills. Different ways to teach are often referred to as pedagogy. When deciding what teaching method to use teachers consider students&#x27; background knowledge, environment, and their learning goals as well as standardized curricula as determined by the relevant authority. Many times, teachers assist in learning outside of the classroom by accompanying students on field trips. The increasing use of technology, specifically the rise of the internet over the past decade, has begun to shape the way teachers approach their roles in the classroom.

The objective is typically a course of study, lesson plan, or a practical skill. A teacher may follow standardized curricula as determined by the relevant authority. The teacher may interact with students of different ages, from infants to adults, students with different abilities and students with learning disabilities.

Teaching using pedagogy also involve assessing the educational levels of the students on particular skills. Understanding the pedagogy of the students in a classroom involves using differentiated instruction as well as supervision to meet the needs of all students in the classroom. Pedagogy can be thought of in two manners. First, teaching itself can be taught in many different ways, hence, using a pedagogy of teaching styles. Second, the pedagogy of the learners comes into play when a teacher assesses the pedagogic diversity of their students and differentiates for the individual students accordingly. For example, an experienced teacher and parent described the place of a teacher in learning as follows: &quot;The real bulk of learning takes place in self-study and problem solving with a lot of feedback around that loop. The function of the teacher is to pressure the lazy, inspire the bored, deflate the cocky, encourage the timid, detect and correct individual flaws, and broaden the viewpoint of all. This function looks like that of a coach using the whole gamut of psychology to get each new class of rookies off the bench and into the game.&quot;

Perhaps the most significant difference between primary school and secondary school teaching is the relationship between teachers and children. In primary schools each class has a teacher who stays with them for most of the week and will teach them the whole curriculum. In secondary schools they will be taught by different subject specialists each session during the week and may have ten or more different teachers. The relationship between children and their teachers tends to be closer in the primary school where they act as form tutor, specialist teacher and surrogate parent during the course of the day.

This is true throughout most of the United States as well. However, alternative approaches for primary education do exist. One of these, sometimes referred to as a &quot;platoon&quot; system, involves placing a group of students together in one class that moves from one specialist to another for every subject. The advantage here is that students learn from teachers who specialize in one subject and who tend to be more knowledgeable in that one area than a teacher who teaches many subjects. Students still derive a strong sense of security by staying with the same group of peers for all classes.

Co-teaching has also become a new trend amongst educational institutions. Co-teaching is defined as two or more teachers working harmoniously to fulfill the needs of every student in the classroom. Co-teaching focuses the student on learning by providing a social networking support that allows them to reach their full cognitive potential. Co-teachers work in sync with one another to create a climate of learning.

===Classroom management===

====Teachers and school discipline====
Throughout the history of education the most common form of school discipline was corporal punishment. While a child was in school, a teacher was expected to act as a substitute parent, with all the normal forms of parental discipline open to them. 

In past times, corporal punishment (spanking or paddling or caning or strapping or birching the student in order to cause physical pain) was one of the most common forms of school discipline throughout much of the world. Most Western countries, and some others, have now banned it, but it remains lawful in the United States following a US Supreme Court decision in 1977 which held that paddling did not violate the US Constitution.

30 US states have banned corporal punishment, the others (mostly in the South) have not. It is still used to a significant (though declining) degree in some public schools in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Private schools in these and most other states may also use it. Corporal punishment in American schools is administered to the seat of the student&#x27;s trousers or skirt with a specially made wooden paddle. This often used to take place in the classroom or hallway, but nowadays the punishment is usually given privately in the principal&#x27;s office.

Official corporal punishment, often by caning, remains commonplace in schools in some Asian, African and Caribbean countries.

Currently detention is one of the most common punishments in schools in the United States, the UK, Ireland, Singapore and other countries. It requires the pupil to remain in school at a given time in the school day (such as lunch, recess or after school); or even to attend school on a non-school day, e.g. &quot;Saturday detention&quot; held at some schools. During detention, students normally have to sit in a classroom and do work, write lines or a punishment essay, or sit quietly.

A modern example of school discipline in North America and Western Europe relies upon the idea of an assertive teacher who is prepared to impose their will upon a class. Positive reinforcement is balanced with immediate and fair punishment for misbehavior and firm, clear boundaries define what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior. Teachers are expected to respect their students; sarcasm and attempts to humiliate pupils are seen as falling outside of what constitutes reasonable discipline.

Whilst this is the consensus viewpoint amongst the majority of academics, some teachers and parents advocate a more assertive and confrontational style of discipline (refer to &quot;Canter Model of Discipline&quot;). Such individuals claim that many problems with modern schooling stem from the weakness in school discipline and if teachers exercised firm control over the classroom they would be able to teach more efficiently. This viewpoint is supported by the educational attainment of countries—in East Asia for instance—that combine strict discipline with high standards of education.

It&#x27;s not clear, however that this stereotypical view reflects the reality of East Asian classrooms or that the educational goals in these countries are commensurable with those in Western countries. In Japan, for example, although average attainment on standardized tests may exceed those in Western countries, classroom discipline and behavior is highly problematic. Although, officially, schools have extremely rigid codes of behavior, in practice many teachers find the students unmanageable and do not enforce discipline at all.

Where school class sizes are typically 40 to 50 students, maintaining order in the classroom can divert the teacher from instruction, leaving little opportunity for concentration and focus on what is being taught. In response, teachers may concentrate their attention on motivated students, ignoring attention-seeking and disruptive students. The result of this is that motivated students, facing demanding university entrance examinations, receive disproportionate resources. Given the emphasis on attainment of university places, administrators and governors may regard this policy as appropriate.

====Obligation to honor students rights====
Sudbury-model democratic schools claim that popularly based authority can maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority for governments and schools alike. They also claim that in these schools the preservation of public order is easier and more efficient than anywhere else. Primarily because rules and regulations are made by the community as a whole, thence the school atmosphere is one of persuasion and negotiation, rather than confrontation since there is no one to confront. Sudbury model democratic schools&#x27; proponents argue that a school that has good, clear laws, fairly and democratically passed by the entire school community, and a good judicial system for enforcing these laws, is a school in which community discipline prevails, and in which an increasingly sophisticated concept of law and order develops, against other schools today, where rules are arbitrary, authority is absolute, punishment is capricious, and due process of law is unknown.

== Occupational hazards ==
Teachers face several occupational hazards in their line of work, including occupational stress, which can negatively impact teachers&#x27; mental and physical health, productivity, and students&#x27; performance. Stress can be caused by organizational change, relationships with students, fellow teachers, and administrative personnel, working environment, expectations to substitute, long hours with a heavy workload, and inspections. Teachers are also at high risk for occupational burnout.

A 2000 study found that 42% of UK teachers experienced occupational stress, twice the figure for the average profession. A 2012 study found that teachers experienced double the rate of anxiety, depression, and stress than average workers.

There are several ways to mitigate the occupational hazards of teaching. Organizational interventions, like changing teachers&#x27; schedules, providing support networks and mentoring, changing the work environment, and offering promotions and bonuses, may be effective in helping to reduce occupational stress among teachers. Individual-level interventions, including stress-management training and counseling, are also used to relieve occupational stress among teachers.

Apart from this, teachers are often not given sufficient opportunities for professional growth or promotions. This leads to some stagnancy, as there is not sufficient interests to enter the profession. An organisation in India called Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA) is working to reduce this hazard, by trying to open opportunities for teachers in India.

==Teaching around the world==
There are many similarities and differences among teachers around the world. In almost all countries teachers are educated in a university or college. Governments may require certification by a recognized body before they can teach in a school. In many countries, elementary school education certificate is earned after completion of high school. The high school student follows an education specialty track, obtain the prerequisite &quot;student-teaching&quot; time, and receive a special diploma to begin teaching after graduation. In addition to certification, many educational institutions especially within the US, require that prospective teachers pass a background check and psychiatric evaluation to be able to teach in classroom. This is not always the case with adult further learning institutions but is fast becoming the norm in many countries as security concerns grow.

International schools generally follow an English-speaking, Western curriculum and are aimed at expatriate communities.

===Australia===
Education in Australia is primarily the responsibility of the individual states and territories. Generally, education in Australia follows the three-tier model which includes primary education (primary schools), followed by secondary education (secondary schools/high schools) and tertiary education (universities or TAFE colleges).

===Canada===
Teaching in Canada requires a post-secondary degree Bachelor&#x27;s Degree. In most provinces a second Bachelor&#x27;s Degree such as a Bachelor of Education is required to become a qualified teacher. Salary ranges from $40,000/year to $90,000/yr. Teachers have the option to teach for a public school which is funded by the provincial government or teaching in a private school which is funded by the private sector, businesses and sponsors.

===France===
In France, teachers, or &quot;professors&quot;, are mainly civil servants, recruited by competitive examination.

===Germany===
In Germany, teachers are mainly civil servants recruited in special university classes, called &quot;Lehramtstudien&quot; (&quot;Teaching Education Studies&quot;). There are many differences between the teachers for elementary schools (&quot;Grundschule&quot;), lower secondary schools (&quot;Hauptschule&quot;), middle level secondary schools (&quot;Realschule&quot;) and higher level secondary schools (&quot;Gymnasium&quot;).
Salaries for teachers depend on the civil servants&#x27; salary index scale (&quot;Bundesbesoldungsordnung&quot;).

===India===

In ancient India, the most common form of education was gurukula based on the guru-shishya tradition (teacher-disciple tradition) which involved the disciple and guru living in the same (or a nearby) residence. These &quot;gurukulam&quot; was supported by public donations and the guru would not accept any fees from the &quot;shishya&quot;. This organized system stayed the most prominent form of education in the Indian subcontinent until the British invasion. Through strong efforts in 1886 and 1948, the gurukula system was revived in India.

The role and success of a teacher in the modern Indian education system is clearly defined. CENTA Standards define the competencies that a good teacher should possess. Schools look for competent teachers across grades. Teachers are appointed directly by schools in private sector, and through eligibility tests in government schools.

===Ireland===
Salaries for primary teachers in Ireland depend mainly on seniority (i.e. holding the position of principal, deputy principal or assistant principal), experience and qualifications. Extra pay is also given for teaching through the Irish language, in a Gaeltacht area or on an island. The basic pay for a starting teacher is €27,814 p.a., rising incrementally to €53,423 for a teacher with 25 years service. A principal of a large school with many years experience and several qualifications (M.A., H.Dip., etc.) could earn over €90,000.

Teachers are required to be registered with the Teaching Council; under Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, a person employed in any capacity in a recognised teaching post - who is not registered with the Teaching Council - may not be paid from Oireachtas funds.

From 2006 Garda vetting has been introduced for new entrants to the teaching profession. These procedures apply to teaching and also to non-teaching posts and those who refuse vetting &quot;cannot be appointed or engaged by the school in any capacity including in a voluntary role&quot;. Existing staff will be vetted on a phased basis.

===Philippines===

To become a teacher in the Philippines, one must have a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education. Other degrees are also allowed as long they are able to get 18 units of professional education subjects (10 units for arts and sciences degrees). A board exam must be taken to become a professional teacher in the Philippines. Upon passing the board exam, the Professional Regulatory Commission will issue a teaching licence.

===United Kingdom===

Education in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter with each of the countries of the United Kingdom having separate systems.

====England====
Salaries for nursery, primary and secondary school teachers ranged from £20,133 to £41,004 in September 2007, although some salaries can go much higher depending on experience and extra responsibilities. Preschool teachers may earn an average salary of £19,543 annually. Teachers in state schools must have at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree, complete an approved teacher education program, and be licensed.

Many counties offer alternative licensing programs to attract people into teaching, especially for hard-to-fill positions. Excellent job opportunities are expected as retirements, especially among secondary school teachers, outweigh slowing enrollment growth; opportunities will vary by geographic area and subject taught.

====Scotland====
In Scotland, anyone wishing to teach must be registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS). Teaching in Scotland is an all graduate profession and the normal route for graduates wishing to teach is to complete a programme of Initial Teacher Education (ITE) at one of the seven Scottish Universities who offer these courses. Once successfully completed, &quot;Provisional Registration&quot; is given by the GTCS which is raised to &quot;Full Registration&quot; status after a year if there is sufficient evidence to show that the &quot;Standard for Full Registration&quot; has been met.

For the salary year beginning April 2008, unpromoted teachers in Scotland earned from £20,427 for a Probationer, up to £32,583 after 6 years teaching, but could then go on to earn up to £39,942 as they complete the modules to earn Chartered Teacher Status (requiring at least 6 years at up to two modules per year.) Promotion to Principal Teacher positions attracts a salary of between £34,566 and £44,616; Deputy Head, and Head teachers earn from £40,290 to £78,642.
Teachers in Scotland can be registered members of trade unions with the main ones being the Educational Institute of Scotland and the Scottish Secondary Teachers&#x27; Association.

====Wales====
Education in Wales differs in certain respects from education elsewhere in the United Kingdom. For example, a significant number of students all over Wales are educated either wholly or largely through the medium of Welsh: in 2008/09, 22 per cent of classes in maintained primary schools used Welsh as the sole or main medium of instruction. Welsh medium education is available to all age groups through nurseries, schools, colleges and universities and in adult education; lessons in the language itself are compulsory for all pupils until the age of 16.

Teachers in Wales can be registered members of trade unions such as ATL, NUT or NASUWT and a report in 2010 suggested that the average age of teachers in Wales was falling with teachers being younger than in previous years. It was suggested that a proportion of older teachers had faced discrimination and did not have their experience valued. A growing cause of concern at that time was that attacks on teachers in Welsh schools reached an all-time high between 2005 and 2010.

===United States===


In the United States, each state determines the requirements for getting a license to teach in public schools. Teaching certification generally lasts three years, but teachers can receive certificates that last as long as ten years. Public school teachers are required to have a bachelor&#x27;s degree and the majority must be certified by the state in which they teach. Many charter schools do not require that their teachers be certified, provided they meet the standards to be highly qualified as set by No Child Left Behind. Additionally, the requirements for substitute/temporary teachers are generally not as rigorous as those for full-time professionals. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that there are 1.4 million elementary school teachers, 674,000 middle school teachers, and 1 million secondary school teachers employed in the U.S.

In the past, teachers have been paid relatively low salaries. However, average teacher salaries have improved rapidly in recent years. US teachers are generally paid on graduated scales, with income depending on experience. Teachers with more experience and higher education earn more than those with a standard bachelor&#x27;s degree and certificate. Salaries vary greatly depending on state, relative cost of living, and grade taught. Salaries also vary within states where wealthy suburban school districts generally have higher salary schedules than other districts. The median salary for all primary and secondary teachers was $46,000 in 2004, with the average entry salary for a teacher with a bachelor&#x27;s degree being an estimated $32,000. Median salaries for preschool teachers, however, were less than half the national median for secondary teachers, clock in at an estimated $21,000 in 2004. For high school teachers, median salaries in 2007 ranged from $35,000 in South Dakota to $71,000 in New York, with a national median of $52,000. Some contracts may include long-term disability insurance, life insurance, emergency/personal leave and investment options.

The American Federation of Teachers&#x27; teacher salary survey for the 2006–07 school year found that the average teacher salary was $51,009. In a salary survey report for K-12 teachers, elementary school teachers had the lowest median salary earning $39,259. High school teachers had the highest median salary earning $41,855. Many teachers take advantage of the opportunity to increase their income by supervising after-school programs and other extracurricular activities. In addition to monetary compensation, public school teachers may also enjoy greater benefits (like health insurance) compared to other occupations. Merit pay systems are on the rise for teachers, paying teachers extra money based on excellent classroom evaluations, high test scores and for high success at their overall school. Also, with the advent of the internet, many teachers are now selling their lesson plans to other teachers through the web in order to earn supplemental income, most notably on TeachersPayTeachers.com. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 also aims to substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers through international cooperation by 2030 in an effort to improve the quality of teaching around the world.

According to a 2024 study, the status of being a teacher in the United States (as measured by occupational prestige, interest among students, the number of individuals preparing for entry, and on-the-job satisfaction) was at its lowest levels since the 1950s.

==Assistant teachers==
Assistant teachers are additional teachers assisting the primary teacher, often in the same classroom. There are different types around the world, as well as a variety of formal programs defining roles and responsibilities.

One type is a Foreign Language Assistant, which in Germany is run by the Educational Exchange Service (Pädagogischer Austauschdienst).

British schools employ teaching assistants, who are not considered fully qualified teachers, and as such, are guided by teachers but may supervise and teach groups of pupils independently. In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;assistant teacher&quot; used to be used to refer to any qualified or unqualified teacher who was not a head or deputy head teacher.

The Japanese education system employs Assistant Language Teachers in elementary, junior high and high schools.

Learning by teaching (German short form: LdL) is a method which allows pupils and students to prepare and teach lessons or parts of lessons, with the understanding that a student&#x27;s own learning is enhanced through the teaching process.

<doc id="205076" wikidata="Q440604" url="?curid=205076" title="Shari Lewis">
<text>Shari Lewis (born Phyllis Naomi Hurwitz; January 17, 1933 – August 2, 1998) was a Peabody-winning American ventriloquist, puppeteer, children&#x27;s entertainer, television show host, dancer, singer, actress, author, and symphony conductor. She famously created and performed the sock puppet Lamb Chop for &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; in March 1956.

==Early life==
Lewis was born to Jewish parents, Ann (née Ritz) and Abraham Hurwitz, an education professor at Yeshiva University originally from Vilnius, Lithuania. She had one sister, Barbara. Her father was named New York City&#x27;s &quot;official magician&quot; by Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia during the Great Depression. Hurwitz taught his daughter to perform specialized magic acts by the time she was 13. Lewis also received instruction in acrobatics, baton twirling, juggling, ice skating, piano, and violin.

==Career==
In 1952, Lewis and her puppetry won first prize on the CBS television series &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot;. She hosted several New York children&#x27;s series through the decade. On July 5, 1953, Lewis made her television hosting debut on &quot;Facts N&#x27;Fun&quot; on NBC-owned WRCA-TV. The program was a variety show in which she engaged her viewers and studio audience members in games, hobbies, craft making, songs, stories, informational segments, interviews with guest performers and personalities. She also performed witty comedy skits with two ventriloquist&#x27;s dummies, Samson and Taffy Twinkle. The one hour show remained on the air until September 26, 1953.

She moved to WPIX in 1953 to replace Ted Steele as host of &quot;Kartoon Klub&quot;, which featured a variety format with a live studio audience. Lewis performed with Randy Rocket and Taffy Twinkle, and the program also featured reruns of &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot; cartoons. &quot;Kartoon Klub&quot; later changed its title to &quot;Shari &amp; Her Friends&quot; on September 23, 1956, and then to &quot;Shariland&quot; a month later. Lewis won New York-area Emmy Awards for her work on &quot;Shariland&quot; and a succeeding series on WRCA-TV, &quot;Hi Mom&quot; (1957–1959), which introduced Charlie Horse, Hush Puppy, and Wing Ding. Lamb Chop, also appearing, had previously been introduced during Lewis&#x27;s guest appearance on &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; in March 1956.

NBC gave Lewis her first network program, &quot;The Shari Lewis Show&quot;, which debuted on October 1, 1960, replacing &quot;The Howdy Doody Show&quot;. The show ran until September 28, 1963, and featured such characters as Hush Puppy, Charlie Horse, Lamb Chop, and Wing Ding, a black crow. Lamb Chop, which was little more than a sock with eyes, served as a sassy alter-ego for Lewis. Hush Puppy had a Southern accent with a reserved, shy and goofy personality, while Charlie Horse was a snarky, sarcastic character.

In 1961, she played title character Dulie Hudson in &quot;Watching Out for Dulie&quot;, a &quot;United States Steel Hour&quot; production. She occasionally guest-starred in TV shows such as &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot;, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, and &quot;Love, American Style&quot;.

From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, she appeared in a number of British shows, such as the &quot;Val Doonican Show&quot; and the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot;. In 1975, Lewis briefly hosted another, syndicated puppet show called &quot;The Shari Show&quot;. In 1992, her show &quot;Lamb Chop&#x27;s Play-Along&quot; began a five-year run on PBS, created as an audience participation &quot;anti-couch potato&quot; show.

When &quot;Lamb Chop&#x27;s Play-Along&quot; ended, Lewis and her husband Jeremy Tarcher created &quot;The Charlie Horse Music Pizza.&quot; A third of elementary schools were skipping music classes from their curriculum at the time, and Lewis and Tarcher felt they could introduce children to music through the show.

The faith-based video &quot;Lamb Chop&#x27;s Special Chanukah&quot; was released in 1996 and received the Parents&#x27; Choice Award of the year. Lewis and Lamb Chop both appeared in a commercial for PrimeStar in 1997. When Lewis appeared before Congress in 1993 to testify in favor of protections for children&#x27;s television, Lamb Chop gained permission to speak. An accomplished musician, Lewis conducted major symphonies in the United States, Japan, and Canada. She wrote many books and produced 17 home videos.

Lewis&#x27;s other work included providing the voice of Princess Nida in the cartoon segment &quot;Arabian Knights&quot;, part of the 1968 series &quot;The Banana Splits Adventure Hour&quot;. Her other voice work in animation includes Famous Studios&#x27; &quot;Honey Halfwitch&quot; theatrical cartoon shorts. Lewis voices the title character as well as her Cousin Maggie.

With her husband, Jeremy Tarcher, she co-wrote an episode for the original series of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;The Lights of Zetar&quot; (1969). Lewis wrote over 60 books for children.

==Personal life==
Lewis kept her surname from her first marriage to Stan Lewis (1932–1958). Her second husband was publisher Jeremy Tarcher (1932–2015), a brother of novelist Judith Krantz. Lewis met Tarcher on the set of a radio show; they married a year later. They had a daughter, Mallory Tarcher.

Mallory Tarcher wrote for the shows &quot;Lamb Chop&#x27;s Play-Along&quot; and &quot;The Charlie Horse Music Pizza&quot;. She legally changed her last name to Lewis and took over
her mother&#x27;s work with Lamb Chop in 2000. On September 20, 2015, 17 years after her death, Shari Lewis&#x27;s husband Jeremy Tarcher died from Parkinson&#x27;s disease; he was 83. Prior to her death, Shari Lewis sold the rights to Lamb Chop to Golden Books Family Entertainment. When Golden filed for bankruptcy these rights were transferred to Classic Media which was later acquired by DreamWorks Animation (now part of NBCUniversal). Her daughter Mallory still owns the live performing rights to the Lamb Chop character.

==Illness and death==
Lewis was treated for breast cancer in 1984. In June 1998, she was diagnosed with uterine cancer. She had a hysterectomy, but her doctors informed her that the cancer was inoperable and she was given six weeks to live. After her diagnosis, Lewis insisted on taping a final episode of &quot;The Charlie Horse Music Pizza&quot;. After recovering from the hysterectomy, she began chemotherapy at Cedars-Sinai Hospital. While undergoing chemotherapy, she developed viral pneumonia and died on the evening of August 2, 1998, at the age of 65. After her death, &quot;The Charlie Horse Music Pizza&quot; was canceled. A private funeral was held, and a public memorial was planned. The last episode of &quot;The Charlie Horse Music Pizza&quot; aired on January 17, 1999, on what would have been her 66th birthday.

<doc id="205078" wikidata="Q274963" url="?curid=205078" title="Hail to the Thief">
<text>Hail to the Thief is the sixth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead. It was released on 9 June 2003 through Parlophone internationally, and through Capitol Records in the United States on 10 June. It was the last album released under Radiohead&#x27;s record contract with EMI, the parent company of Parlophone and Capitol.

After transitioning to a more electronic style on their albums &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000) and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; (2001), which were recorded through protracted studio experimentation, Radiohead sought to work more spontaneously, combining electronic and rock music. They recorded most of &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; in two weeks in Los Angeles with their longtime producer, Nigel Godrich, focusing on live takes rather than overdubs.

The singer, Thom Yorke, wrote lyrics in response to the election of the US president George W. Bush and the unfolding war on terror. He took phrases from political discourse and combined them with elements from fairy tales and children&#x27;s literature. The title is a play on the American presidential anthem, &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot;.

Following a high-profile internet leak of unfinished material ten weeks before release, &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. It was certified platinum in the UK and Canada and gold in several countries. It was promoted with the singles &quot;There There&quot;, &quot;Go to Sleep&quot; and &quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot;, and short films, music videos and webcasts streamed from Radiohead&#x27;s website. &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; received acclaim; it was the fifth consecutive Radiohead album nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album, and won for the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Non-Classical Album.

==Background==
With their previous albums &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000) and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; (2001), recorded simultaneously, Radiohead replaced their guitar-led rock sound with a more electronic style. For the tours, they learned how to perform the music live, combining synthetic sounds with rock instrumentation. The singer, Thom Yorke, said: &quot;Even with electronics, there is an element of spontaneous performance in using them. It was the tension between what&#x27;s human and what&#x27;s coming from the machines. That was stuff we were getting into.&quot; Radiohead did not want to make a &quot;big creative leap or statement&quot; with their next album.

In early 2002, after the &quot;Amnesiac&quot; tour had finished, Yorke sent his bandmates CDs of demos. The CDs, titled &quot;The Gloaming&quot;, &quot;Episcoval&quot; and &quot;Hold Your Prize&quot;, comprised electronic music alongside piano and guitar sketches. Radiohead had tried to record some of the songs, such as &quot;I Will&quot;, for &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, but were not satisfied with the results. They spent May and June 2002 arranging and rehearsing the songs before performing them on their tour of Spain and Portugal in July and August.

==Recording==
In September 2002, Radiohead moved to Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, Los Angeles, with their longtime producer, Nigel Godrich. The studio was suggested by Godrich, who had used it to produce records by Travis and Beck and thought it would be a &quot;good change of scenery&quot; for Radiohead. Yorke said: &quot;We were like, &#x27;Do we want to fly halfway around the world to do this?&#x27; But it was terrific, because we worked really hard. We did a track a day. It was sort of like holiday camp.&quot; Godrich later said his clearest memory of the sessions was Yorke repeatedly saying how much he hated Los Angeles.

&quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; were created through a years-long process of recording and editing that the drummer, Philip Selway, described as &quot;manufacturing music in the studio&quot;. For their next album, Radiohead sought to capture a more immediate, &quot;live&quot; sound. Most electronic elements were not overdubbed, but recorded live in the studio. The band integrated computers into their performances with other instruments. Yorke said &quot;everything was about performance, like staging a play&quot;. Radiohead tried to work quickly and spontaneously, avoiding procrastination and overanalysis. Yorke was forced to write lyrics differently, as he did not have time to rewrite them in the studio. For some songs, he returned to the method of cutting up words and arranging them randomly he had employed for &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot;.

The lead guitarist, Jonny Greenwood, used the music programming language Max to manipulate the band&#x27;s playing. For example, he used it to process his guitar on &quot;Go To Sleep&quot;, creating a random stuttering effect. He also continued to use modular synthesisers and the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument similar to a theremin&quot;.&quot; After having used effects pedals heavily on previous albums, he challenged himself to create interesting guitar parts without effects.

Inspired by the Beatles, Radiohead tried to keep the songs concise. The opening track, &quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot;, was recorded as a studio test and finished in two hours. Radiohead struggled to record &quot;There There&quot;; after rerecording it in their Oxfordshire studio, Yorke was so relieved to have captured it he wept, feeling it was their best work. Radiohead had recorded an electronic version of &quot;I Will&quot; in the &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; sessions, but abandoned it as &quot;dodgy Kraftwerk&quot;. They used components of this version to create &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; on &quot;Amnesiac&quot;. For &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;, they sought to &quot;get to the core of what&#x27;s good about the song&quot; and not be distracted by production details or new sounds, settling on a stripped-back arrangement.

Radiohead recorded most of &quot;Hail to the Thief &quot;in two weeks, with additional recording and mixing at their studio in Oxfordshire, England, in late 2002 and early 2003. The guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; was the first Radiohead album &quot;where, at the end of making it, we haven&#x27;t wanted to kill each other&quot;. However, mixing and sequencing created conflict. According to Yorke, &quot;There was a long sustained period during which we lived with it but it wasn&#x27;t completely finished, so you get attached to versions and we had big rows about it.&quot; According to Selway, &quot;We started quickly. Then it... had more requirements.&quot; Godrich estimated that a third of the album comprises rough mixes from the Los Angeles sessions.

==Lyrics and themes==
Yorke&#x27;s lyrics were influenced by what he called &quot;the general sense of ignorance and intolerance and panic and stupidity&quot; following the 2000 election of the US president George W. Bush. He took words and phrases from discourse around the unfolding war on terror, which he described as Orwellian euphemisms, and used them in the lyrics and artwork. Yorke said the &quot;emotional context of those words had been taken away&quot; and that he was &quot;stealing it back&quot;. Though Yorke denied any intent to make a political statement, he said: &quot;I desperately tried not to write anything political, anything expressing the deep, profound terror I&#x27;m living with day to day. But it&#x27;s just fucking there, and eventually you have to give it up and let it happen.&quot;

Yorke, a new father, adopted a strategy of &quot;distilling&quot; the political themes into &quot;childlike simplicity&quot;. He took phrases from fairy tales and folklore such as the tale of Chicken Little, and from children&#x27;s literature and television he shared with his son, such as the 1970s TV series &quot;Bagpuss.&quot; Parenthood made Yorke concerned about the condition of the world and how it could affect future generations. Greenwood said Yorke&#x27;s lyrics embraced sarcasm, wit and ambiguity, and expressed &quot;confusion and escape, like &#x27;I&#x27;m going to stay at home and look after the people I care about, buy a month&#x27;s supply of food&#x27;.&quot;

Yorke also took phrases from Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, the subject of his partner Rachel Owen&#x27;s PhD thesis. Several songs, such as &quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot;, &quot;Sit Down. Stand Up&quot;, and &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot;, reference Christian ideas of heaven and hell, a first for Radiohead&#x27;s music. Other songs reference science fiction, horror and fantasy, such as the wolves and vampires of &quot;A Wolf at the Door&quot; and &quot;We Suck Young Blood&quot;, the reference to the slogan &quot;two plus two equals five&quot; of the dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; in &quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot;, and the allusion to the giant of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; in &quot;Go to Sleep&quot;. He sometimes chose words for their sounds rather than meanings, such as the title &quot;Myxomatosis&quot; or the repeated phrase &quot;the rain drops&quot; on &quot;Sit Down. Stand Up&quot;.Radiohead struggled to choose a title. They considered using &quot;The Gloaming&quot; (), but this was rejected as too poetic and &quot;doomy&quot; and so became the album&#x27;s subtitle. They also considered the titles &quot;Little Man Being Erased&quot;, &quot;The Boney King of Nowhere&quot; and &quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot;, which became the alternative titles for &quot;Go to Sleep&quot;, &quot;There There&quot; and &quot;Sit Down. Stand Up&quot;. The alternative titles were inspired by Victorian playbills showcasing moralistic songs played in music halls.

The phrase &quot;hail to the thief&quot; was used by anti-Bush protesters as a play on &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot;, the American presidential anthem. Yorke described hearing the phrase for the first time as a &quot;formative moment&quot;. Radiohead chose the title partly in reference to Bush, but also in response to &quot;the rise of doublethink and general intolerance and madness ... like individuals were totally out of control of the situation ... a manifestation of something not really human&quot;. The title also references the leak of an unfinished version of the album before its release. Yorke worried that it would be construed solely as reference to the US election, but his bandmates felt it &quot;conjured up all the nonsense and absurdity and jubilation of the times&quot;.

==Music==
&quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; incorporates alternative rock, art rock, experimental rock and electronic rock. It features more conventional rock instrumentation and less digital manipulation than Radiohead&#x27;s previous albums &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, with prominent use of live drums, guitar and piano, and Yorke&#x27;s voice is less manipulated with effects. The &quot;Spin&quot; critic Will Hermes found that &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; &quot;seesaws between the chill of sequencers and the warmth of fingers on strings and keys&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; was &quot;more tuneful and song-focused&quot;&quot;.&quot; Several tracks use the &quot;Pixies-like&quot; quiet-to-loud building of tension Radiohead had employed on previous albums. 
Though Yorke described &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; as &quot;very acoustic&quot;, he denied that it was a &quot;guitar record&quot;. It retains electronic elements such as synthesisers, drum machines and sampling. Selway said the combination of rock and electronic music covered &quot;the two hemispheres of the Radiohead brain&quot;. Radiohead saw &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; as a &quot;sparkly, shiny pop record. Clear and pretty.&quot; O&#x27;Brien felt the album captured a new &quot;swaggering&quot; sound, with &quot;space and sunshine and energy&quot;.The opening track, &quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot;, is a rock song that builds to a loud climax. &quot;Sit Down. Stand Up&quot;, an electronic song, was influenced by the jazz musician Charles Mingus. &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot; is a lullaby-like piano ballad with shifting time signatures. The lyrics allude to the Biblical story of Noah&#x27;s Ark, and was written &quot;in five minutes&quot; for Yorke&#x27;s infant son, Noah. &quot;Backdrifts&quot; is an electronic song about &quot;the slide backwards that&#x27;s happening everywhere you look&quot;.

&quot;Go to Sleep&quot; begins with an acoustic guitar riff that the bassist, Colin Greenwood, likened to 1960s English folk music. &quot;Where I End and You Begin&quot; is a rock song with &quot;walls&quot; of ondes Martenot and a rhythm section influenced by New Order. According to Yorke, &quot;We Suck Young Blood&quot; is a &quot;slave ship tune&quot; with a free jazz break, and is &quot;not to be taken seriously&quot;. With ill-timed, &quot;zombie-like&quot; handclaps, the song satirises Hollywood culture and its &quot;constant desire to stay young and fleece people, suck their energy&quot;.

&quot;The Gloaming&quot; is an electronic song with &quot;mechanical&quot; rhythms that Jonny Greenwood built from tape loops. Greenwood described it as &quot;very old school electronica: no computers, just analogue synths, tape machines, and sellotape&quot;. Yorke said it was &quot;the most explicit protest song on the record&quot;, with lyrics about the rise of fascism and &quot;intolerance and bigotry and fear, and all the things that keep a population down&quot;. &quot;There There&quot; is a rock song with layered percussion that builds to a loud climax. It was influenced by the bands Can, Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Pixies.

Yorke described &quot;I Will&quot; as the angriest song he had ever written. Its lyrics were inspired by news footage of the Amiriyah shelter bombing in the Gulf War, which killed about 400 people, including children and families. The funk-influenced &quot;A Punchup at a Wedding&quot; expresses the helplessness Yorke felt in the face of world events, and his anger over a negative review of Radiohead&#x27;s homecoming performance in South Park, Oxford, in 2001. Yorke said the performance was &quot;one of the biggest days in my life&quot;, and expressed dismay that &quot;someone, just because they had access to a keyboard and a typewriter, could just totally write off an event that meant an awful lot to an awful lot of people&quot;. 

For &quot;Myxomatosis&quot;, a song built on a driving fuzz bassline, Radiohead sought to recreate the &quot;frightening&quot; detuned synthesiser sounds of 1970s and 80s new wave bands such as Tubeway Army. Yorke said the lyrics were about mind control and media censorship. Jonny Greenwood described &quot;Scatterbrain&quot; as &quot;simple and pretty&quot; with chords that do not resolve. &quot;NME&quot; described the final track, &quot;A Wolf at the Door&quot; as &quot;a pretty song, with a sinister monologue&quot;. Greenwood likened its lyrics to a Grimms&#x27; fairy tale. Yorke described its placement at the end of the album as &quot;sort of like waking you up at the end ... It&#x27;s all been a nightmare and you need to go and get a glass of water now.&quot;

==Artwork==
The &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; artwork was created by the longtime Radiohead collaborator Stanley Donwood, who joined them during the recording in Hollywood. Donwood initially planned to create artwork based on photographs of phallic topiary, but the idea was rejected by Yorke. Instead, the cover art is a roadmap of Hollywood, with words and phrases taken from roadside advertising in Los Angeles, such as &quot;God&quot;, &quot;TV&quot; and &quot;oil&quot;. Donwood said advertising was designed to be attractive, but that there was something &quot;unsettling&quot; about being sold something. He took the advertising slogans out of context to &quot;remove the imperative&quot; and &quot;get to the pure heart of advertising&quot;.

Other words in the artwork were taken from Yorke&#x27;s lyrics and political discussion surrounding the war on terror. Among them is &quot;Burn the Witch&quot;, the title of a song Radiohead did not complete until their ninth album, &quot;A Moon Shaped Pool&quot; (2016). Other artworks included with the album refer to cities relevant to the war, including New York, London, Grozny and Baghdad. Early editions contained a fold-out road map of the cover.

Comparing the cover to the more subdued palettes of his prior Radiohead artworks, Donwood described the bright, &quot;pleasing&quot; colours as &quot;ominous because all these colours that I&#x27;ve used are derived from the petrol-chemical industry ... We&#x27;ve created this incredibly vibrant society, but we&#x27;re going to have to deal with the consequences sooner or later.&quot; The essayist Amy Britton interpreted the artwork as an allusion to the Bush administration&#x27;s &quot;road map for peace&quot; plan for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Joseph Tate likened it to the paintings of the artist Jean Dubuffet and saw it as a portrayal of &quot;capitalism&#x27;s glaring visual presence: an oppressive sameness of style and colour that mirrors globalisation&#x27;s reduction of difference&quot;. 

== Internet leak ==
On 30 March 2003, ten weeks before release, an unfinished version of &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; was leaked online. The leak comprised rough edits and unmixed songs from January that year. On Radiohead&#x27;s forum, Jonny Greenwood wrote that the band were &quot;pissed off&quot;, not with downloaders but because of the &quot;sloppy&quot; release of unfinished work. Colin Greenwood said the leak was &quot;like being photographed with one sock on when you get out of bed in the morning&quot;. However, he expressed dismay at the cease-and-desist orders sent by label EMI to radio stations and fan sites playing the leaked tracks, saying: &quot;Don&#x27;t record companies usually pay thousands of dollars to get stations to play their records? Now they&#x27;re paying money to stations not to play them.&quot;

EMI decided against moving the release date earlier to combat the leak. The EMI executive Ted Mico said the leak had generated media coverage, and that EMI was confident that &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; would sell. The leak partly influenced Radiohead&#x27;s decision to self-release their next album, &quot;In Rainbows&quot; (2007), online, terming it &quot;their leak date&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; was released on 9 June 2003 by Parlophone Records in the UK and a day later by Capitol Records in the US. The CD was printed with copy protection in some regions; the Belgian consumer group Test-Achats received complaints that it would not play on some CD players. A compilation of &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; B-sides, remixes and live performances, &quot;Com Lag (2plus2isfive)&quot;, was released in April 2004.

&quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; reached number one in the UK Albums Chart and stayed on the chart for 14 weeks, selling 114,320 copies in its first week. In the US, it entered at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 300,000 copies in its first week, more than any previous Radiohead album. By 2008, it had sold over a million copies in the US. It is certified platinum in the UK and Canada.

==Promotion==
According to the &quot;Guardian&quot; critic Alexis Petridis, &quot;Hail to the Thief&#x27;s&quot; marketing campaign was &quot;by [Radiohead] standards ... a promotional blitzkrieg&quot;. In April 2003, promotional posters spoofing talent recruitment posters appeared in Los Angeles and London with slogans taken from the lyrics of &quot;We Suck Young Blood&quot;. The posters included a phone number spelling the phoneword &quot;to thief&quot;, which connected callers to a recording welcoming them to the &quot;&quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; customer care hotline&quot;. In May, planes trailing &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; banners flew over the California Coachella Festival.

&quot;There There&quot; was released as the lead single on 21 May. The &quot;Guardian&quot; described the choice of a more conventional rock song as &quot;diplomatic&quot; following the divided response to &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac.&quot; Yorke asked the &quot;Bagpuss&quot; creator, Oliver Postgate, to create its music video, but he declined as he was retired. Instead, a stop-motion animated video was created by Chris Hopewell. The video debuted on the Times Square Jumbotron in New York on 20 May, and received hourly play that day on MTV2. &quot;Go to Sleep&quot; and &quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot; were released as singles on 18 August and 17 November. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; suggested that EMI chose the singles to &quot;retrench Radiohead as a big rock band&quot; and compete with acts such as Coldplay and Muse.

On May 26, Radiohead launched radiohead.tv, where they streamed short films, music videos and live webcasts from their studio at scheduled times. Visitors late for streams were shown a test card with &quot;1970s-style&quot; intermission music. Yorke said Radiohead had planned to broadcast the material on their own television channel, but this was cancelled due to &quot;money, cutbacks, too weird, might scare the children, staff layoffs, shareholders&quot;. The material was released on the 2004 DVD &quot;The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of All Time&quot;. Radiohead also relaunched their website, featuring digital animations on the themes of mass-media culture and 24-hour cities. 

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; has a score of 85 out of 100 on review aggregate site Metacritic, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Neil McCormick, writing for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, called it &quot;Radiohead firing on all cylinders, a major work by major artists at the height of their powers&quot;. Chris Ott of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that Radiohead had &quot;largely succeeded in their efforts to shape pop music into as boundless and possible a medium as it should be&quot; and named it the week&#x27;s &quot;Best New Music&quot;. 

The &quot;New York&quot; critic Ethan Brown said that &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; &quot;isn&#x27;t a protest album, and that&#x27;s why it works so well. As with great Radiohead records past, such as &quot;Kid A&quot;, the music – restlessly, freakishly inventive – pushes politics far into the background.&quot; Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that &quot;despite the fact that it seems more like a bunch of songs on a disc rather than a singular body, its impact is substantial&quot;, concluding that Radiohead had &quot;entered a second decade of record-making with a surplus of momentum&quot;. In &quot;Mojo&quot;, Peter Paphides wrote that &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; &quot;coheres as well as anything else in their canon&quot;.

James Oldham of &quot;NME&quot; saw &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; as &quot;a good rather than great record... The impact of the best moments is dulled by the inclusion of some indifferent electronic compositions.&quot; The &quot;Q&quot; writer John Harris felt that it &quot;comes dangerously close to being all experimentalism and precious little substance&quot;. Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that while &quot;you could never describe &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; as a bad record&quot;, it was &quot;neither startlingly different and fresh nor packed with the sort of anthemic songs that once made [Radiohead] the world&#x27;s biggest band&quot;. He felt the political lyrics and bleak mood put Radiohead in danger of self-parody. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote that while its melodies and guitar work are &quot;never as elegiac and lyrical&quot; or &quot;articulate and demented&quot; as those of &quot;OK Computer&quot;, it flowed better. He later awarded it an &quot;honourable mention&quot;.

&quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; was the fifth consecutive Radiohead album nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album, and earned Godrich and engineer Darrell Thorp the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Engineered Non-Classical Album. In 2010, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; the 89th-best album of the 2000s, writing that &quot;the dazzling overabundance of ideas makes &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; a triumph&quot;.

===Legacy===
Radiohead have criticised &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;. In 2006, Yorke said: &quot;I&#x27;d maybe change the playlist. I think we had a meltdown when we put it together ... We wanted to do things quickly, and I think the songs suffered.&quot; In 2008, Yorke posted an alternative track listing on Radiohead&#x27;s website, omitting &quot;Backdrifts&quot;, &quot;We Suck Young Blood&quot;, &quot;I Will&quot; and &quot;A Punchup at a Wedding&quot;. O&#x27;Brien said Radiohead should have cut the album to ten tracks and that its length had alienated some listeners; Colin Greenwood said several songs were unfinished and that the album was &quot;a holding process&quot;. Jonny agreed that it was too long, and said: &quot;We were trying to do what people said we were good at ... But it was good for our heads. It was good for us to be doing a record that came out of playing live.&quot; 

In 2013, Godrich said: &quot;I think there&#x27;s some great moments on there – but too many songs ... As a whole I think it&#x27;s charming because of the lack of editing. But personally it&#x27;s probably my least favourite of all the albums ... It didn&#x27;t really have its own direction. It was almost like a homogeny of previous work. Maybe that&#x27;s its strength.&quot; In 2023, approaching its 20th anniversary, Selway described &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; as a bridge between &quot;Kid A, Amnesiac&quot; and Radiohead&#x27;s subsequent album, &quot;In Rainbows.&quot; He said its combination of electronic and rock music captured &quot;two very distinctive characters of Radiohead ... That&#x27;s what was lovely about it.&quot;

Yorke is due to rework &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; for &quot;Hamlet Hail to the Thief&quot;, a stage production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; announced in September 2024. The production is directed by Christine Jones and Steven Hoggett and scheduled to run at Aviva Studios, Manchester, from April to May 2025, followed by the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon in June. Yorke said &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; &quot;chimes with the underlying grief and paranoia&quot; of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

==Reissues==
Radiohead left EMI after their contract ended in 2003. In 2007, EMI released &quot;Radiohead Box Set&quot;, a compilation of albums recorded while Radiohead were signed to EMI, including &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;. After a period of being out of print on vinyl, &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; was reissued as a double LP on 19 August 2008 as part of the &quot;From the Capitol Vaults&quot; series, along with other Radiohead albums. On 31 August 2009, EMI reissued &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; in a 2-CD &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; and a 2-CD 1-DVD &quot;Special Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;. The first CD contains the original album; the second CD collects B-sides and live performances previously compiled on the &quot;Com Lag (2plus2isfive)&quot; EP; the DVD contains music videos and a live television performance. Radiohead had no input into the reissue and the music was not remastered. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; the week&#x27;s &quot;best new reissue&quot; and &quot;Gagging Order&quot; the best B-side included in the bonus material. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that the bonus content was all &quot;worth hearing, though the live tracks stand out&quot;.

The EMI reissues were discontinued after Radiohead&#x27;s back catalogue was transferred to XL Recordings in 2016. In May 2016, XL reissued Radiohead&#x27;s back catalogue on vinyl, including &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;.

<text>The Helsinki Final Act, also known as Helsinki Accords or Helsinki Declaration, was the document signed at the closing meeting of the third phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) held in Helsinki, Finland, between 30 July and 1 August 1975, following two years of negotiations known as the Helsinki Process. All then-existing European countries except Andorra and Hoxhaist Albania, as well as the United States and Canada (altogether 35 participating states), signed the Final Act in an attempt to improve the détente between the East and the West. The Helsinki Accords, however, were not binding as they did not have treaty status that would have to be ratified by parliaments. Sometimes the term &quot;Helsinki pact(s)&quot; was also used unofficially.

== Articles ==
In the CSCE terminology, there were four groupings or baskets. In the first basket, the &quot;Declaration on Principles Guiding Relations between Participating States&quot; (also known as &quot;The Decalogue&quot;) enumerated the following 10 points:

The second basket promised economic, scientific, and technological cooperation; facilitating business contacts and industrial cooperation; linking together transportation networks; and increasing the flow of information. The third basket involved commitments to improve the human context of family reunions, marriages and travel. It also sought to improve the conditions of journalists and expand cultural exchanges. The fourth basket dealt with procedures to monitor implementation, and to plan future meetings.

=== Freedom of information ===

The United States had sought a provision that would prohibit radio jamming but it failed to find consensus due to Soviet opposition. Despite this, the West believed jamming was illegal under the agreed upon language for &quot;expansion of the dissemination of information broadcast by radio&quot;. The Soviet Union believed that jamming was a legally justified response to broadcasts they argued were a violation of the Helsinki Accords&#x27; broad purpose to &quot;meet the interest of mutual understanding among people and the aims set forth by the Conference&quot;.

== Ford administration ==
When President Gerald Ford came into office in August 1974, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) negotiations had been underway for nearly two years. Although the USSR was looking for a rapid resolution, none of the parties were quick to make concessions, particularly on human rights points. Throughout much of the negotiations, US leaders were disengaged and uninterested with the process. In August 1974, National Security Advisor and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said to Ford &quot;we never wanted it but we went along with the Europeans [...] It is meaningless — it is just a grandstand play to the left. We are going along with it.&quot;

In the months leading up to the conclusion of negotiations and signing of the Helsinki Final Act, the American public, in particular Americans of Eastern European descent voiced their concerns that the agreement would mean the acceptance of Soviet domination over Eastern Europe and forced incorporation of the Baltic States into the USSR. President Ford was concerned about this as well and sought clarification on this issue from the US National Security Council.

The US Senate was also worried about the fate of the Baltic States and the CSCE in general. Several senators wrote to President Ford requesting that the final summit stage be delayed until all matters had been settled, and in a way favorable to the West. Ford also attracted criticism from a wide range of political spectrum when he refused to meet with Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn to avoid damaging Soviet Union–United States relations before the conference.

Shortly before President Ford departed for Helsinki, he held a meeting with a group of Americans of Eastern European background, and stated definitively that US policy on the Baltic States would not change, but would be strengthened since the agreement denies the annexation of territory in violation of international law and allows for the peaceful change of borders.

Ford in July 1975 told the delegation of Americans from East European backgrounds that:
His reassurances had little effect. The volume of negative mail continued to grow. The American public was still unconvinced that American policy on the incorporation of the Baltic States would not be changed by the Helsinki Final Act. Despite protests from all around, Ford decided to move forward and sign the agreement. As domestic criticism mounted, Ford hedged on his support for the Helsinki Accords, which had the impact of overall weakening his foreign-policy stature.

Ronald Reagan made the Accords a centerpiece of his campaign against Ford for the 1976 Republican Party presidential primaries. During the general election, the Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter attacked the Accords as a legitimation of the &quot;Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.&quot; A debate about the Accords in this vein during the 1976 United States presidential debates led to an infamous presidential gaffe in which Ford claimed that there was &quot;no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration.&quot; His blunder in the debate with Carter when he denied Kremlin control of Poland proved disastrous.

== Reception and impact ==
The document was seen both as a significant step toward reducing Cold War tensions and as a major diplomatic boost for the Soviet Union at the time, due to its clauses on the inviolability of national frontiers and respect for territorial integrity, which were seen to consolidate the USSR&#x27;s territorial gains in Central Europe following World War II. Considering objections from Canada, Spain, Ireland and other states, the Final Act simply stated that &quot;frontiers&quot; in Europe should be stable but could change by peaceful internal means. US president Gerald Ford also reaffirmed that US non-recognition policy of the Baltic States&#x27; (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia) forced incorporation into the Soviet Union had not changed. Leaders of other NATO member states made similar statements.

However, the civil rights portion of the agreement provided the basis for the work of the Helsinki Watch, an independent non-governmental organization created to monitor compliance to the Helsinki Accords (which evolved into several regional committees, eventually forming the International Helsinki Federation and Human Rights Watch). While these provisions applied to all signatories, the focus of attention was on their application to the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies, including Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), Hungary, Poland, and Romania. Soviet propaganda presented the Final Act as a great triumph for Soviet diplomacy and for Brezhnev personally.

In practice, the Soviet government significantly curbed the rule of law, civil liberties, protection of law and guarantees of property, which were considered examples of &quot;bourgeois morality&quot; by Soviet legal theorists such as Andrey Vyshinsky. The Soviet Union signed legally-binding human rights documents, but they were neither widely known or accessible to people living under Communist rule, nor were they taken seriously by the Communist authorities. Human rights activists in the Soviet Union were regularly subjected to harassment, repressions and arrests.

According to the Cold War scholar John Lewis Gaddis in his book &quot;The Cold War: A New History&quot; (2005), &quot;Leonid Brezhnev had looked forward, Anatoly Dobrynin recalls, to the &#x27;publicity he would gain... when the Soviet public learned of the final settlement of the postwar boundaries for which they had sacrificed so much&#x27;... &#x27;[Instead, the Helsinki Accords] gradually became a manifesto of the dissident and liberal movement&#x27;... What this meant was that the people who lived under these [communist] systems — at least the more courageous — could claim official permission to say what they thought.&quot;

The then-People&#x27;s Republic of Albania refused to participate in the Accords, its leader Enver Hoxha arguing, &quot;All the satellites of the Soviets with the possible exception of the Bulgarians want to break the shackles of the Warsaw Treaty, but they cannot. Then their only hope is that which the Helsinki document allows them, that is, to strengthen their friendship with the United States of America and the West, to seek investments from them in the form of credits and imports of their technology without any restrictions, to allow the church to occupy its former place, to deepen the moral degeneration, to increase the anti-Sovietism, and the Warsaw Treaty will remain an empty egg-shell.&quot;

The Helsinki Accords served as the groundwork for the later Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), established in 1995 under the Paris Charter of 1990.

<text>Gregory David Kriesel (born January 20, 1965) known by his stagename Greg K., is an American retired musician and the founding bassist of the rock band the Offspring. He is also the co-founder (along with bandmate Dexter Holland) of the record label Nitro Records.

== Career ==
In 1984 Kriesel formed the band alongside friend and cross-country teammate Dexter Holland after the duo failed to participate in a Social Distortion concert. The duo hired James Lilja as their drummer and after a year Noodles joined as guitarist, Manic Subsidal changed their name to the Offspring in 1986. After drummer Ron Welty joined the band in 1987 to replace James Lilja, the band started recording their debut album in 1989.

After recording a demo in 1988, the Offspring signed a deal with a small-time label, Nemesis Records, for whom they recorded their first full-length album, &quot;The Offspring&quot;, in March 1989. This album would eventually be re-issued in 1995, by Kriesel and Holland&#x27;s own record label, Nitro Records.

In 1991, the Offspring signed with Epitaph Records (home of Bad Religion, L7, NOFX, Pennywise and other similar bands). Their first release on the label was &quot;Ignition&quot;, which was released in 1992. Their last album for that label was 1994&#x27;s &quot;Smash&quot;, which still holds the world record for most sales of an album on an independent label. The band then signed with Columbia Records in 1996 (after Brett Gurewitz, owner of Epitaph and guitarist for Bad Religion, sold the contract to Columbia) for whom they released their next six albums, &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre&quot; (1997), &quot;Americana&quot; (1998), &quot;Conspiracy of One&quot; (2000), &quot;Splinter&quot; (2003), &quot;Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace&quot; (2008) and &quot;Days Go By&quot; (2012). 

=== Lawsuit ===
In August 2019, Kriesel filed a lawsuit against his Offspring bandmates Dexter Holland and Noodles, following an alleged decision by the two in November 2018 to fire Kriesel from the Offspring and exclude him from band related activities such as studio recordings and live performances. Kriesel and his lawyers also alleged that the two conspired to &quot;seize the business, business opportunities, and assets&quot; of Kriesel&#x27;s stake in the band without compensation. As the result of his absence from touring, he had been filled in by Tony Kanal of No Doubt, with the Offspring’s touring guitarist Todd Morse becoming Kriesel&#x27;s official replacement. Dexter Holland and Noodles later sued Kriesel back, stating that &quot;Kriesel&#x27;s arguments have no basis in fact&quot; and that &quot;there could be no such thing as an oral, permanent partnership, or a partnership which required two people to perform in perpetuity&quot;. Holland and Noodles also claimed that Kriesel apparently was asked and agreed to leave the band after &quot;differences developed between how both parties viewed the band&#x27;s present and future.&quot; They further claimed that they attempted to &quot;negotiate in good faith&quot; to purchase his shares in the band and present him his chunk of the band&#x27;s assets and those assets included The Offspring trademark and various royalty payments. Kriesel allegedly refused that deal, suing the band instead. The case was settled out of court in 2023.

*February 1 – George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Adam Bede&quot;, her first full-length novel, is published by John Blackwood in the United Kingdom. Contemporary reviews are largely positive, describing it as &quot;of the highest class&quot;. and &quot;first-rate&quot;; However, it is also accused of being &quot;vile outpourings of a lewd woman&#x27;s mind&quot; and circulating libraries refuse to stock it or will supply it only under the counter.
*February 4 – German scholar Constantin von Tischendorf identifies portions of the mid-4th century Codex Sinaiticus (an uncial manuscript of the Greek Bible) at Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery on Mount Sinai in the Khedivate of Egypt and arranges for its presentation to his patron, Tsar Alexander II of Russia at Saint Petersburg.
*April 30 – Charles Dickens&#x27;s weekly magazine &quot;All the Year Round&quot; is published for the first time in London, succeeding &quot;Household Words&quot; and containing the first serial installment of his historical novel &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;.
*June–July – Frances Harper&#x27;s &quot;The Two Offers&quot;, the first English-language short story by an African American author, is published in the first volume of &quot;The Anglo-African Magazine&quot; (New York).
*September – Twenty three-year-old Isabella Beeton&#x27;s &quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot; begins publication as a partwork supplement to &quot;The Englishwoman&#x27;s Domestic Magazine&quot;, published by her husband Samuel Orchart Beeton in London.
*November 26 – Wilkie Collins&#x27;s &quot;The Woman in White&quot;, an early example of mystery fiction, begins serialisation in &quot;All the Year Round&quot;.
*&quot;unknown date&quot; – The first translation of Adam Mickiewicz&#x27;s Polish epic poem &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot; (1834) into another language, Belarusian, is made by the writer and dramatist Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich, in Vilnius, but pressure from the authorities of the ruling Russian Empire means he is able to publish only the first two chapters.
