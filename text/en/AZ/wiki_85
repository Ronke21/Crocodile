<doc id="209959" wikidata="Q407204" url="?curid=209959" title="Sodium hypochlorite">
<text>Sodium hypochlorite is an alkaline inorganic chemical compound with the formula (also written as NaClO). It is commonly known in a dilute aqueous solution as bleach or chlorine bleach. It is the sodium salt of hypochlorous acid, consisting of sodium cations () and hypochlorite anions (, also written as and ).

The anhydrous compound is unstable and may decompose explosively. It can be crystallized as a pentahydrate , a pale greenish-yellow solid which is not explosive and is stable if kept refrigerated.

Sodium hypochlorite is most often encountered as a pale greenish-yellow dilute solution referred to as chlorine bleach, which is a household chemical widely used (since the 18th century) as a disinfectant and bleaching agent. In solution, the compound is unstable and easily decomposes, liberating chlorine, which is the active principle of such products. Sodium hypochlorite is still the most important chlorine-based bleach.

Its corrosive properties, common availability, and reaction products make it a significant safety risk. In particular, mixing liquid bleach with other cleaning products, such as acids found in limescale-removing products, will release toxic chlorine gas. A common misconception is that mixing bleach with ammonia also releases chlorine, but in reality they react to produce chloramines such as nitrogen trichloride. With excess ammonia and sodium hydroxide, hydrazine may be generated.

==Chemistry==

=== Stability of the solid ===
Anhydrous sodium hypochlorite can be prepared but, like many hypochlorites, it is highly unstable and decomposes explosively on heating or friction. The decomposition is accelerated by carbon dioxide at Earth&#x27;s atmospheric levels - around 4 parts per ten thousand. It is a white solid with the orthorhombic crystal structure.

Sodium hypochlorite can also be obtained as a crystalline pentahydrate , which is not explosive and is much more stable than the anhydrous compound. The formula is sometimes given in its hydrous crystalline form as . The Cl–O bond length in the pentahydrate is 1.686 Å. The transparent, light greenish-yellow, orthorhombic crystals contain 44% NaOCl by weight and melt at 25–27 °C. The compound decomposes rapidly at room temperature, so it must be kept under refrigeration. At lower temperatures, however, it is quite stable: reportedly only 1% decomposition after 360 days at 7 °C.

A 1966 US patent claims that stable solid sodium hypochlorite dihydrate can be obtained by carefully excluding chloride ions (), which are present in the output of common manufacturing processes and are said to catalyze the decomposition of hypochlorite into chlorate () and chloride. In one test, the dihydrate was claimed to show only 6% decomposition after 13.5 months of storage at −25 °C. The patent also claims that the dihydrate can be reduced to the anhydrous form by vacuum drying at about 50 °C, yielding a solid that showed no decomposition after 64 hours at −25 °C.

=== Equilibria and stability of solutions ===
At typical ambient temperatures, sodium hypochlorite is more stable in dilute solutions that contain solvated and ions. The density of the solution is 1.093 g/mL at 5% concentration, and 1.21 g/mL at 14%, 20 °C. Stoichiometric solutions are fairly alkaline, with pH 11 or higher since the hypochlorite ion is a weak base:

The following species and equilibria are present in NaOCl/NaCl solutions:
:
:

The second equilibrium equation above will be shifted to the right if the chlorine is allowed to escape as gas. The ratios of , HOCl, and in solution are also pH dependent. At pH below 2, the majority of the chlorine in the solution is in the form of dissolved elemental . At pH greater than 7.4, the majority is in the form of hypochlorite . The equilibrium can be shifted by adding acids (such as hydrochloric acid) or bases (such as sodium hydroxide) to the solution:
:

At a pH of about 4, such as obtained by the addition of strong acids like hydrochloric acid, the amount of undissociated (nonionized) HOCl is highest. The reaction can be written as:

Sodium hypochlorite solutions combined with acid evolve chlorine gas, particularly strongly at pH &lt; 2, by the reactions:
:

At pH &gt; 8, the chlorine is practically all in the form of hypochlorite anions (). The solutions are fairly stable at pH 11–12. Even so, one report claims that a conventional 13.6% NaOCl reagent solution lost 17% of its strength after being stored for 360 days at 7 °C. For this reason, in some applications one may use more stable chlorine-releasing compounds, such as calcium hypochlorite or trichloroisocyanuric acid .

Anhydrous sodium hypochlorite is soluble in methanol, and solutions are stable.

===Decomposition to chlorate or oxygen===
In solution, under certain conditions, the hypochlorite anion may also disproportionate (autoxidize) to chloride and chlorate:

In particular, this reaction occurs in sodium hypochlorite solutions at high temperatures, forming sodium chlorate and sodium chloride:
This reaction is exploited in the industrial production of sodium chlorate.

An alternative decomposition of hypochlorite produces oxygen instead:
In hot sodium hypochlorite solutions, this reaction competes with chlorate formation, yielding sodium chloride and oxygen gas:

These two decomposition reactions of solutions are maximized at pH around 6. For example, at 80 °C, with and concentrations of 80 mM, over the pH range 5−10.5, both reactions have rate proportional to formula_1, decomposition is fastest at pH 6.5, and chlorate is produced with ~95% efficiency. Above pH 11, both reactions have rate proportional to formula_2, decomposition is much slower, and chlorate is produced with ~90% efficiency. This decomposition is affected by light and metal ion catalysts such as copper, nickel, cobalt, and iridium. Catalysts like sodium dichromate and sodium molybdate may be added industrially to reduce the oxygen pathway, but a report claims that only the latter is effective.

===Titration===
Titration of hypochlorite solutions is often done by adding a measured sample to an excess amount of acidified solution of potassium iodide (KI) and then titrating the liberated iodine () with a standard solution of sodium thiosulfate or phenylarsine oxide, using starch as indicator, until the blue color disappears.

According to one US patent, the stability of sodium hypochlorite content of solids or solutions can be determined by monitoring the infrared absorption due to the O–Cl bond. The characteristic wavelength is given as 140.25 μm for water solutions, 140.05 μm for the solid dihydrate , and 139.08 μm for the anhydrous mixed salt .

===Oxidation of organic compounds===
Oxidation of starch by sodium hypochlorite, which adds carbonyl and carboxyl groups, is relevant to the production of modified starch products.

In the presence of a phase-transfer catalyst, alcohols are oxidized to the corresponding carbonyl compound (aldehyde or ketone). Sodium hypochlorite can also oxidize organic sulfides to sulfoxides or sulfones; disulfides or thiols to sulfonyl halides; and imines to oxaziridines. It can also de-aromatize phenols.

===Oxidation of metals and complexes===
Heterogeneous reactions of sodium hypochlorite and metals such as zinc proceed slowly to give the metal oxide or hydroxide:
:NaOCl + Zn → ZnO + NaCl

Homogeneous reactions with metal coordination complexes proceed somewhat faster. This has been exploited in the Jacobsen epoxidation.

===Other reactions===
If not properly stored in airtight containers, sodium hypochlorite reacts with carbon dioxide to form sodium carbonate:

Sodium hypochlorite reacts with most nitrogen compounds to form volatile monochloramine, dichloramines, and nitrogen trichloride:
:

===Neutralization===
Sodium thiosulfate is an effective chlorine neutralizer. Rinsing with a 5 mg/L solution, followed by washing with soap and water, will remove chlorine odor from the hands.

==Production==

===Chlorination of soda===
Potassium hypochlorite was first produced in 1789 by Claude Louis Berthollet in his laboratory on the Quai de Javel in Paris, France, by passing chlorine gas through a solution of potash lye. The resulting liquid, known as &quot;Eau de Javel&quot; (&quot;Javel water&quot;), was a weak solution of potassium hypochlorite. Antoine Labarraque replaced potash lye by the cheaper soda lye, thus obtaining sodium hypochlorite (&quot;Eau de Labarraque&quot;).

Hence, chlorine is simultaneously reduced and oxidized; this process is known as disproportionation.

The process is also used to prepare the pentahydrate for industrial and laboratory use. In a typical process, chlorine gas is added to a 45–48% NaOH solution. Some of the sodium chloride precipitates and is removed by filtration, and the pentahydrate is then obtained by cooling the filtrate to 12 °C.

===From calcium hypochlorite===
Another method involved the reaction of sodium carbonate (&quot;washing soda&quot;) with chlorinated lime (&quot;bleaching powder&quot;), a mixture of calcium hypochlorite , calcium chloride , and calcium hydroxide :
:
This method was commonly used to produce hypochlorite solutions for use as a hospital antiseptic that was sold after World War I under the names &quot;Eusol&quot;, an abbreviation for Edinburgh University Solution Of (chlorinated) Lime – a reference to the university&#x27;s pathology department, where it was developed.

===Electrolysis of brine===
Near the end of the nineteenth century, E. S. Smith patented the chloralkali process: a method of producing sodium hypochlorite involving the electrolysis of brine to produce sodium hydroxide and chlorine gas, which then mixed to form sodium hypochlorite. The key reactions are:
: (at the anode)
: (at the cathode)
Both electric power and brine solutions were in cheap supply at the time, and various enterprising marketers took advantage of the situation to satisfy the market&#x27;s demand for sodium hypochlorite. Bottled solutions of sodium hypochlorite were sold under numerous trade names.

Today, an improved version of this method, known as the Hooker process (named after Hooker Chemicals, acquired by Occidental Petroleum), is the only large-scale industrial method of sodium hypochlorite production. In the process, sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and sodium chloride (NaCl) are formed when chlorine is passed into a cold dilute sodium hydroxide solution. The chlorine is prepared industrially by electrolysis with minimal separation between the anode and the cathode. The solution must be kept below 40 °C (by cooling coils) to prevent the undesired formation of sodium chlorate.

Commercial solutions always contain significant amounts of sodium chloride (common salt) as the main by-product, as seen in the equation above.

===From hypochlorous acid and soda===
A 1966 patent describes the production of solid stable dihydrate by reacting a chloride-free solution of hypochlorous acid HClO (such as prepared from chlorine monoxide ClO and water), with a concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide. In a typical preparation, 255 mL of a solution with 118 g/L HClO is slowly added with stirring to a solution of 40 g of NaOH in water 0 °C. Some sodium chloride precipitates and is removed by filtration. The solution is vacuum evaporated at 40–50 °C and 1–2 mmHg until the dihydrate crystallizes out. The crystals are vacuum-dried to produce a free-flowing crystalline powder.

The same principle was used in a 1993 patent to produce concentrated slurries of the pentahydrate . Typically, a 35% solution (by weight) of HClO is combined with sodium hydroxide at about or below 25 °C. The resulting slurry contains about 35% NaClO, and are relatively stable due to the low concentration of chloride.

==Packaging and sale==

Household bleach sold for use in laundering clothes is a 3–8% solution of sodium hypochlorite at the time of manufacture. Strength varies from one formulation to another and gradually decreases with long storage. Sodium hydroxide is usually added in small amounts to household bleach to slow down the decomposition of NaClO.

Domestic use patio blackspot remover products are ~10% solutions of sodium hypochlorite.

A 10–25% solution of sodium hypochlorite is, according to Univar&#x27;s safety sheet, supplied with synonyms or trade names bleach, Hypo, Everchlor, Chloros, Hispec, Bridos, Bleacol, or Vo-redox 9110.

A 12% solution is widely used in waterworks for the chlorination of water, and a 15% solution is more commonly used for disinfection of wastewater in treatment plants. Sodium hypochlorite can also be used for point-of-use disinfection of drinking water, taking 0.2–2 mg of sodium hypochlorite per liter of water.

Dilute solutions (50 ppm to 1.5%) are found in disinfecting sprays and wipes used on hard surfaces.

==Uses==

===Bleaching===
Household bleach is, in general, a solution containing 3–8% sodium hypochlorite, by weight, and 0.01–0.05% sodium hydroxide; the sodium hydroxide is used to slow the decomposition of sodium hypochlorite into sodium chloride and sodium chlorate.

===Cleaning===
Sodium hypochlorite has destaining properties. Among other applications, it can be used to remove mold stains, dental stains caused by fluorosis, and stains on crockery, especially those caused by the tannins in tea. It has also been used in laundry detergents and as a surface cleaner. It is also used in sodium hypochlorite washes.

Its bleaching, cleaning, deodorizing, and caustic effects are due to oxidation and hydrolysis (saponification). Organic dirt exposed to hypochlorite becomes water-soluble and non-volatile, which reduces its odor and facilitates its removal.

===Disinfection===

Sodium hypochlorite in solution exhibits broad-spectrum anti-microbial activity and is widely used in healthcare facilities in a variety of settings. It is usually diluted in water depending on its intended use. &quot;Strong chlorine solution&quot; is a 0.5% solution of hypochlorite (containing approximately 5000 ppm free chlorine) used for disinfecting areas contaminated with body fluids, including large blood spills (the area is first cleaned with detergent before being disinfected). It may be made by diluting household bleach as appropriate (normally 1 part bleach to 9 parts water). Such solutions have been demonstrated to inactivate both &quot;C. difficile&quot; and HPV. &quot;Weak chlorine solution&quot; is a 0.05% solution of hypochlorite used for washing hands, but is normally prepared with calcium hypochlorite granules.

&quot;Dakin&#x27;s Solution&quot; is a disinfectant solution containing a low concentration of sodium hypochlorite and some boric acid or sodium bicarbonate to stabilize the pH. It is effective with NaOCl concentrations as low as 0.025%.

US government regulations allow food processing equipment and food contact surfaces to be sanitized with solutions containing bleach, provided that the solution is allowed to drain adequately before contact with food and that the solutions do not exceed 200 parts per million (ppm) available chlorine (for example, one tablespoon of typical household bleach containing 5.25% sodium hypochlorite, per gallon of water). If higher concentrations are used, the surface must be rinsed with potable water after sanitizing.

A similar concentration of bleach in warm water is used to sanitize surfaces before brewing beer or wine. Surfaces must be rinsed with sterilized (boiled) water to avoid imparting flavors to the brew; the chlorinated byproducts of sanitizing surfaces are also harmful. The mode of disinfectant action of sodium hypochlorite is similar to that of hypochlorous acid.

Solutions containing more than 500 ppm available chlorine are corrosive to some metals, alloys, and many thermoplastics (such as acetal resin) and need to be thoroughly removed afterward, so the bleach disinfection is sometimes followed by an ethanol disinfection. Liquids containing sodium hypochlorite as the main active component are also used for household cleaning and disinfection, for example toilet cleaners. Some cleaners are formulated to be viscous so as not to drain quickly from vertical surfaces, such as the inside of a toilet bowl.

The undissociated (nonionized) hypochlorous acid is believed to react with and inactivate bacterial and viral enzymes.

Neutrophils of the human immune system produce small amounts of hypochlorite inside phagosomes, which digest bacteria and viruses.

===Deodorizing===
Sodium hypochlorite has deodorizing properties, which go hand in hand with its cleaning properties.

===Waste water treatment===
Sodium hypochlorite solutions have been used to treat dilute cyanide wastewater, such as electroplating wastes. In batch treatment operations, sodium hypochlorite has been used to treat more concentrated cyanide wastes, such as silver cyanide plating solutions. Toxic cyanide is oxidized to cyanate ) that is not toxic, idealized as follows:

Sodium hypochlorite is commonly used as a biocide in industrial applications to control slime and bacteria formation in water systems used at power plants, pulp and paper mills, etc., in solutions typically of 10–15% by weight.

===Endodontics===
Sodium hypochlorite is the medicament of choice due to its efficacy against pathogenic organisms and pulp digestion in endodontic therapy. Its concentration for use varies from 0.5% to 5.25%. At low concentrations it dissolves mainly necrotic tissue; at higher concentrations, it also dissolves vital tissue and additional bacterial species. One study has shown that &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot; was still present in the dentin after 40 minutes of exposure of 1.3% and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite, whereas 40 minutes at a concentration of 5.25% was effective in &quot;E. faecalis&quot; removal. In addition to higher concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, longer time exposure and warming the solution (60 °C) also increases its effectiveness in removing soft tissue and bacteria within the root canal chamber. 2% is a common concentration as there is less risk of an iatrogenic hypochlorite incident. A hypochlorite incident is an immediate reaction of severe pain, followed by edema, haematoma, and ecchymosis as a consequence of the solution escaping the confines of the tooth and entering the periapical space. This may be caused by binding or excessive pressure on the irrigant syringe, or it may occur if the tooth has an unusually large apical foramen.

=== Nerve agent neutralization ===
At the various nerve agent (chemical warfare nerve gas) destruction facilities throughout the United States, 0.5-2.5% sodium hypochlorite is used to remove all traces of nerve agent or blister agent from Personal Protection Equipment after an entry is made by personnel into toxic areas.

0.5-2.5% sodium hypochlorite is also used to neutralize any accidental releases of the nerve agent in the toxic areas.

Lesser concentrations of sodium hypochlorite are used similarly in the Pollution Abatement System to ensure that no nerve agent is released into the furnace flue gas.

===Reduction of skin damage===
Dilute bleach baths have been used for decades to treat moderate to severe eczema in humans. Still, it has not been clear why they work. One of the reasons why bleach helps is that eczema can frequently result in secondary infections, especially from bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus, which makes managing it difficult. Staphylococcus aureus infection is related to the pathogenesis of eczema and AD. Bleach baths are one method for lowering the risk of staph infections in people with eczema. The antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties of sodium hypochlorite contribute to the reduction of harmful bacteria on the skin and the reduction of inflammation, respectively. According to work published by researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine in November 2013, a very dilute (0.005%) solution of sodium hypochlorite in water was successful in treating skin damage with an inflammatory component caused by radiation therapy, excess sun exposure or aging in laboratory mice. Mice with radiation dermatitis given daily 30-minute baths in bleach solution experienced less severe skin damage and better healing and hair regrowth than animals bathed in water. A molecule called nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) is known to play a critical role in inflammation, aging, and response to radiation. The researchers found that if NF-κB activity was blocked in elderly mice by bathing them in bleach solution, the animals&#x27; skin began to look younger, going from old and fragile to thicker, with increased cell proliferation. The effect diminished after the baths were stopped, indicating that regular exposure was necessary to maintain skin thickness.

==Safety==
Dilute sodium hypochlorite solutions (as in household bleach) are irritating to mainly the skin and respiratory tract. Short-term skin contact with household bleach may cause dryness of the skin.

It is estimated that there are about 3,300 accidents needing hospital treatment caused by sodium hypochlorite solutions each year in British homes (RoSPA, 2002).

===Oxidation and corrosion===
Sodium hypochlorite is a strong oxidizer. Oxidation reactions are corrosive. Solutions burn the skin and cause eye damage, especially when used in concentrated forms. As recognized by the NFPA, however, only solutions containing more than 40% sodium hypochlorite by weight are considered hazardous oxidizers. Solutions less than 40% are classified as a moderate oxidizing hazard (NFPA 430, 2000).

Household bleach and pool chlorinator solutions are typically stabilized by a significant concentration of lye (caustic soda, NaOH) as part of the manufacturing reaction. This additive will by itself cause caustic irritation or burns due to defatting and saponification of skin oils and destruction of tissue. The slippery feel of bleach on the skin is due to this process.

===Storage hazards===
Contact of sodium hypochlorite solutions with metals may evolve flammable hydrogen gas. Containers may explode when heated due to the release of chlorine gas.

Hypochlorite solutions are corrosive to common container materials such as stainless steel and aluminium. The few compatible metals include titanium (which however is not compatible with dry chlorine) and tantalum. Glass containers are safe. Some plastics and rubbers are affected too; safe choices include polyethylene (PE), high density polyethylene (HDPE, PE-HD), polypropylene (PP), some chlorinated and fluorinated polymers such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF); as well as ethylene propylene rubber, and Viton.

Containers must allow the venting of oxygen produced by decomposition over time, otherwise, they may burst.

===Reactions with other common products===
Mixing bleach with some household cleaners can be hazardous.

Sodium hypochlorite solutions, such as liquid bleach, will release toxic chlorine gas when mixed with an acid, such as hydrochloric acid or vinegar.

A 2008 study indicated that sodium hypochlorite and organic chemicals (e.g., surfactants, fragrances) contained in several household cleaning products can react to generate chlorinated organic compounds. The study showed that indoor air concentrations significantly increase (8–52 times for chloroform and 1–1170 times for carbon tetrachloride, respectively, above baseline quantities in the household) during the use of bleach containing products.

In particular, mixing hypochlorite bleaches with amines (for example, cleaning products that contain or release ammonia, ammonium salts, urea, or related compounds and biological materials such as urine) produces chloramines. These gaseous products can cause acute lung injury. Chronic exposure, for example, from the air at swimming pools where chlorine is used as the disinfectant, can lead to the development of atopic asthma.

Bleach can react violently with hydrogen peroxide and produce oxygen gas:

Explosive reactions or byproducts can also occur in industrial and laboratory settings when sodium hypochlorite is mixed with diverse organic compounds.

===Limitations in health care===
The UK&#x27;s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in October 2008 recommended that Dakin&#x27;s solution should not be used in routine wound care.

==Environmental impact==
In spite of its strong biocidal action, sodium hypochlorite per se has limited environmental impact, since the hypochlorite ion rapidly degrades before it can be absorbed by living beings.

However, one major concern arising from sodium hypochlorite use is that it tends to form persistent chlorinated organic compounds, including known carcinogens, that can be absorbed by organisms and enter the food chain. These compounds may be formed during household storage and use as well as during industrial use. For example, when household bleach and wastewater were mixed, 1–2% of the available chlorine was observed to form organic compounds. As of 1994, not all the byproducts had been identified, but identified compounds include chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. The exposure to these chemicals from use is estimated to be within occupational exposure limits.

<doc id="209960" wikidata="Q10476" url="?curid=209960" title="Auriga">
<text>Auriga is a constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. It is one of the 88 modern constellations; it was among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy. Its name is Latin for &#x27;(the) charioteer&#x27;, associating it with various mythological beings, including Erichthonius and Myrtilus. Auriga is most prominent during winter evenings in the northern Hemisphere, as are five other constellations that have stars in the Winter Hexagon asterism. Because of its northern declination, Auriga is only visible in its entirety as far south as −34°; for observers farther south it lies partially or fully below the horizon. A large constellation, with an area of 657 square degrees, it is half the size of the largest, Hydra.

Its brightest star, Capella, is an unusual multiple star system among the brightest stars in the night sky. Beta Aurigae is an interesting variable star in the constellation; Epsilon Aurigae, a nearby eclipsing binary with an unusually long period, has been studied intensively. Because of its position near the winter Milky Way, Auriga has many bright open clusters in its borders, including M36, M37, and M38, popular targets for amateur astronomers. In addition, it has one prominent nebula, the Flaming Star Nebula, associated with the variable star AE Aurigae.

In Chinese mythology, Auriga&#x27;s stars were incorporated into several constellations, including the celestial emperors&#x27; chariots, made up of the modern constellation&#x27;s brightest stars. Auriga is home to the radiant for the Aurigids, Zeta Aurigids, Delta Aurigids, and the hypothesized Iota Aurigids.

== History and mythology ==

The first record of Auriga&#x27;s stars was in Mesopotamia as a constellation called GAM, representing a scimitar or crook. However, this may have represented just Capella (Alpha Aurigae) or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM in the MUL.APIN. The crook of Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed from most of the stars of the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for Elnath, traditionally assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology. The association with goats carried into the Greek astronomical tradition, though it later became associated with a charioteer along with the shepherd.

In Greek mythology, Auriga is often identified as the mythological Greek hero Erichthonius of Athens, the chthonic son of Hephaestus who was raised by the goddess Athena. Erichthonius was generally credited to be the inventor of the quadriga, the four-horse chariot, which he used in the battle against the usurper Amphictyon, the event that made Erichthonius the king of Athens. His chariot was created in the image of the Sun&#x27;s chariot, the reason Zeus placed him in the heavens. The Athenian hero then dedicated himself to Athena and, soon after, Zeus raised him into the night sky in honor of his ingenuity and heroic deeds.
Auriga, however, is sometimes described as Myrtilus, who was Hermes&#x27;s son and the charioteer of Oenomaus. The association of Auriga and Myrtilus is supported by depictions of the constellation, which rarely show a chariot. Myrtilus&#x27;s chariot was destroyed in a race intended for suitors to win the heart of Oenomaus&#x27;s daughter Hippodamia. Myrtilus earned his position in the sky when Hippodamia&#x27;s successful suitor, Pelops, killed him, despite his complicity in helping Pelops win her hand. After his death, Myrtilus&#x27;s father Hermes placed him in the sky. Yet another mythological association of Auriga is Theseus&#x27;s son Hippolytus. He was ejected from Athens after he refused the romantic advances of his stepmother Phaedra, who committed suicide as a result. He was killed when his chariot was wrecked, but revived by Asclepius.

Auriga is also said to represent Phaethon, son of the sun Helios, who tricked his father into letting him drive his chariot for a day. Phaethon crashed and burned, scorching the earth. He was then placed in the night sky as the Auriga. Regardless of Auriga&#x27;s specific representation, it is likely that the constellation was created by the ancient Greeks to commemorate the importance of the chariot in their society.

An incidental appearance of Auriga in Greek mythology is as the limbs of Medea&#x27;s brother. In the myth of Jason and the Argonauts, as they journeyed home, Medea killed her brother and dismembered him, flinging the parts of his body into the sea, represented by the Milky Way. Each individual star represents a different limb.

Capella is associated with the mythological she-goat Amalthea, who breast-fed the infant Zeus. It forms an asterism with the stars Epsilon Aurigae, Zeta Aurigae, and Eta Aurigae, the latter two of which are known as the &quot;Haedi&quot; (the Kids). Though most often associated with Amalthea, Capella has sometimes been associated with Amalthea&#x27;s owner, a nymph. The myth of the nymph says that the goat&#x27;s hideous appearance, resembling a Gorgon, was partially responsible for the Titans&#x27; defeat, because Zeus skinned the goat and wore it as his aegis. The asterism containing the goat and kids had been a separate constellation; however, Ptolemy merged the Charioteer and the Goats in the 2nd-century Almagest. Before that, Capella was sometimes seen as its own constellation—by Pliny the Elder and Manilius—called &quot;Capra&quot;, &quot;Caper&quot;, or &quot;Hircus&quot;, all of which relate to its status as the &quot;goat star&quot;. Zeta Aurigae and Eta Aurigae were first called the &quot;Kids&quot; by Cleostratus, an ancient Greek astronomer.

Traditionally, illustrations of Auriga represent it as a chariot and its driver. The charioteer holds a goat over his left shoulder and has two kids under his left arm; he holds the reins to the chariot in his right hand. However, depictions of Auriga have been inconsistent over the years. The reins in his right hand have also been drawn as a whip, though Capella is almost always over his left shoulder and the Kids under his left arm. The 1488 atlas &quot;Hyginus&quot; deviated from this typical depiction by showing a four-wheeled cart driven by Auriga, who holds the reins of two oxen, a horse, and a zebra. Jacob Micyllus depicted Auriga in his &quot;Hyginus&quot; of 1535 as a charioteer with a two-wheeled cart, powered by two horses and two oxen. Arabic and Turkish depictions of Auriga varied wildly from those of the European Renaissance; one Turkish atlas depicted the stars of Auriga as a mule, called &quot;Mulus clitellatus&quot; by Johann Bayer. One unusual representation of Auriga, from 17th-century France, showed Auriga as Adam kneeling on the Milky Way, with a goat wrapped around his shoulders.

Occasionally, Auriga is seen not as the Charioteer but as Bellerophon, the mortal rider of Pegasus who dared to approach Mount Olympus. In this version of the tale, Jupiter pitied Bellerophon for his foolishness and placed him in the stars.

Oxford research finds it likely the group was equally named Agitator in about the 15th century and provides a quotation as late as 1623, from a Gerard de Malynes multi-topic work. Some of the stars of Auriga were incorporated into a now-defunct constellation called Telescopium Herschelii. This constellation was introduced by Maximilian Hell to honor William Herschel&#x27;s discovery of Uranus. Originally, it included two constellations, Tubus Hershelii Major &#x27;, in Gemini, Lynx, and Auriga, and Tubus Hershelii Minor &#x27; in Orion and Taurus; both represented Herschel&#x27;s telescopes. Johann Bode combined Hell&#x27;s constellations into Telescopium Herschelii in 1801, located mostly in Auriga.

Since the time of Ptolemy, Auriga has remained a constellation and is officially recognized by the International Astronomical Union, although like all modern constellations, it is now defined as a specific region of the sky that includes both the ancient pattern and the surrounding stars. In 1922, the IAU designated its recommended three-letter abbreviation, &quot;Aur&quot;. The official boundaries of Auriga were created in 1930 by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte as a polygon of 20 segments. Its right ascension is between 4h 37.5m and 7h 30.5m and its declination is between 27.9° and 56.2° in the equatorial coordinate system.

=== In non-Western astronomy ===

The stars of Auriga were incorporated into several Chinese constellations. &quot;Wuche&quot;, the five chariots of the celestial emperors and the representation of the grain harvest, was a constellation formed by Alpha Aurigae, Beta Aurigae, Beta Tauri, Theta Aurigae, and Iota Aurigae. &quot;Sanzhu&quot; or &quot;Zhu&quot; was one of three constellations which represented poles for horses to be tethered. They were formed by the triplets of Epsilon, Zeta, and Eta Aurigae; Nu, Tau, and Upsilon Aurigae; and Chi and 26 Aurigae, with one other undetermined star. &quot;Xianchi&quot;, the pond where the sun set and &quot;Tianhuang&quot;, a pond, bridge, or pier, were other constellations in Auriga, though the stars that composed them are undetermined. &quot;Zuoqi&quot;, representing chairs for the emperor and other officials, was made up of nine stars in the east of the constellation. &quot;Bagu&quot;, a constellation mostly formed from stars in Camelopardalis representing different types of crops, included the northern stars of Delta and Xi Aurigae.

In ancient Hindu astronomy, Capella represented the heart of Brahma and was important religiously. Ancient Peruvian peoples saw Capella, called &quot;Colca&quot;, as a star intimately connected to the affairs of shepherds.

In Brazil, the Bororo people incorporate the stars of Auriga into a massive constellation representing a caiman; its southern stars represent the end of the animal&#x27;s tail. The eastern portion of Taurus is the rest of the tail, while Orion is its body and Lepus is the head. This constellation arose because of the prominence of caymans in daily Amazonian life. There is evidence that Capella was significant to the Aztec people, as the Late Classic site Monte Albán has a marker for the star&#x27;s heliacal rising. Indigenous peoples of California and Nevada also noticed the bright pattern of Auriga&#x27;s stars. To them, the constellation&#x27;s bright stars formed a curve that was represented in crescent-shaped petroglyphs. The indigenous Pawnee of North America recognized a constellation with the same major stars as modern Auriga: Alpha, Beta, Gamma (Beta Tauri), Theta, and Iota Aurigae.

The people of the Marshall Islands featured Auriga in the myth of Dümur, which tells the story of the creation of the sky. Antares in Scorpius represents Dümur, the oldest son of the stars&#x27; mother, and the Pleiades represent her youngest son. The mother of the stars, Ligedaner, is represented by Capella; she lived on the island of Alinablab. She told her sons that the first to reach an eastern island would become the King of the Stars, and asked Dümur to let her come in his canoe. He refused, as did each of her sons in turn, except for Pleiades. Pleiades won the race with the help of Ligedaner, and became the King of the Stars. Elsewhere in the central Caroline Islands, Capella was called &quot;Jefegen uun&quot; (variations include &quot;efang alul&quot;, &quot;evang-el-ul&quot;, and &quot;iefangel uul&quot;), meaning &quot;north of Aldebaran&quot;. Different names were noted for Auriga and Capella in Eastern Pacific societies. On Pukapuka, the figure of modern Auriga was called &quot;Te Wale-o-Tutakaiolo&quot; (&quot;The house of Tutakaiolo&quot;); in the Society Islands, it was called &quot;Faa-nui&quot; (&quot;Great Valley&quot;). Capella itself was called &quot;Tahi-anii&quot; (&quot;Unique Sovereign&quot;) in the Societies. &quot;Hoku-lei&quot; was the name for Capella but may have been the name for the whole constellation; the name means &quot;Star-wreath&quot; and refers to one of the wives of the Pleiades, called &quot;Makalii&quot;.

The stars of Auriga feature in Inuit constellations. Quturjuuk, meaning &quot;collar-bones&quot;, was a constellation that included Capella (Alpha Aurigae), Menkalinan (Beta Aurigae), Pollux (Beta Geminorum), and Castor (Alpha Geminorum). Its rising signalled that the constellation Aagjuuk, made up of Altair (Alpha Aquilae), Tarazed (Gamma Aquilae), and sometimes Alshain (Beta Aquilae), would rise soon. Aagjuuk, which represented the dawn following the winter solstice, was an incredibly important constellation in the Inuit mythos. It was also used for navigation and time-keeping at night.

==== Bright stars ====
Alpha Aurigae (Capella), the brightest star in Auriga, is a G8III class star (G-type giant) 43 light-years away and the sixth-brightest star in the night sky at magnitude 0.08. Its traditional name is a reference to its mythological position as Amalthea; it is sometimes called the &quot;Goat Star&quot;. Capella&#x27;s names all point to this mythology. In Arabic, Capella was called &quot;al-&#x27;Ayyuq&quot;, meaning &quot;the goat&quot;, and in Sumerian, it was called mul.ÁŠ.KAR, &quot;the goat star&quot;. On Ontong Java, Capella was called &quot;ngahalapolu&quot;. Capella is a spectroscopic binary with a period of 104 days; the components are both yellow giants, more specifically, the primary is a G-type star and the secondary is between a G-type and F-type star in its evolution. The secondary is formally classified as a G0III class star (G-type giant). The primary has a radius of 11.87 solar radii () and a mass of 2.47 solar masses (); the secondary has a radius of and a mass of . The two components are separated by 110 million kilometers, almost 75% of the distance between the Earth and the Sun. The star&#x27;s status as a binary was discovered in 1899 at the Lick Observatory; its period was determined in 1919 by J.A. Anderson at the 100-inch Mt. Wilson Observatory telescope. It appears with a golden-yellow hue, though Ptolemy and Giovanni Battista Riccioli both described its color as red, a phenomenon attributed not to a change in Capella&#x27;s color but to the idiosyncrasies of their color sensitivities. Capella has an absolute magnitude of 0.3 and a luminosity of 160 times the luminosity of the Sun, or (the primary is and the secondary is ). It may be loosely associated with the Hyades, an open cluster in Taurus, because of their similar proper motion. Capella has one more companion, Capella H, which is a pair of red dwarf stars located 11,000 astronomical units (0.17 light-years) from the main pair.

Beta Aurigae (Menkalinan, Menkarlina) is a bright A2IV class star (A-type subgiant). Its Arabic name comes from the phrase &quot;mankib dhu al-&#x27;inan&quot;, meaning &quot;shoulder of the charioteer&quot; and is a reference to Beta Aurigae&#x27;s location in the constellation. Menkalinan is 81 light-years away and has a magnitude of 1.90. Like Epsilon Aurigae, it is an eclipsing binary star that varies in magnitude by 0.1m. The two components are blue-white stars that have a period of 3.96 days. Its double nature was revealed spectroscopically in 1890 by Antonia Maury, making it the second spectroscopic binary discovered, and its variable nature was discovered photometrically 20 years later by Joel Stebbins. Menkalinan has an absolute magnitude of 0.6 and a luminosity of . The component of its motion in the direction of Earth is per second. Beta Aurigae may be associated with a stream of about 70 stars including Delta Leonis and Alpha Ophiuchi; the proper motion of this group is comparable to that of the Ursa Major Moving Group, though the connection is only hypothesized. Besides its close eclipsing companion, Menkalinan has two other stars associated with it. One is an unrelated optical companion, discovered in 1783 by William Herschel; it has a magnitude of 10.5 and has a separation of 184 arcseconds. The other is likely associated gravitationally with the primary, as determined by their common proper motion. This 14th-magnitude star was discovered in 1901 by Edward Emerson Barnard. It has a separation of 12.6 arcseconds, and is around 350 astronomical units from the primary.

==== Other bright stars ====

Besides particularly bright stars of Alpha and Beta Aurigae, Auriga has many dimmer naked-eye visible stars.

Gamma Aurigae, now known under its once co-name Beta Tauri (El Nath, Alnath) is a B7III class star (B-type giant). At about +1.65 it would rank a clear third in apparent magnitude if still co-placed in Auriga. It is a mercury-manganese star, with some large signatures of heavy elements.

Iota Aurigae, also called Hasseleh and Kabdhilinan, is a K3II class star (K-type bright giant) of magnitude 2.69; it is about 494 light-years away from Earth. It evolved from a B-type star to K-type over the estimated 30–45 million years since its birth. It has an absolute magnitude of −2.3 and a luminosity of . It is classed as a particularly luminous bright giant but its light is in part &quot;extinguished&quot; (blocked) by intra-galactic dust clouds — astronomers estimate by these it appears 0.6 magnitudes fainter. It is also a hybrid star, an x-ray producing giant star that emits x-rays from its corona and has a cool stellar wind. Though its proper motion is just 0.02 arcseconds per year, it has a radial velocity of per second in recession. The traditional name Kabdhilinan, sometimes shortened to &quot;Alkab&quot;, comes from the Arabic phrase &quot;al-kab dh&#x27;il inan&quot;, meaning &quot;shoulder of the rein holder&quot;. Iota may end as a supernova, but because it is close to the mass limit for such stars, it may instead become a white dwarf.

Delta Aurigae, the northernmost bright star in Auriga, is a K0III-type star (K-type giant), 126 light-years from Earth and approximately 1.3 billion years old. It has a magnitude of 3.72, an absolute magnitude of 0.2, and a luminosity of . About 12 times the radius of the Sun, Delta weighs only two solar masses and rotates with a period of almost one year. Though it is often listed as a single star, it actually has three very widely spaced optical companions. One is a double star of magnitude 11, two arcminutes apart; the other is a star of magnitude 10, three arcminutes apart.

Lambda Aurigae (Al Hurr) is a G1.5IV-V-type star (G-type star intermediate between a subgiant and main-sequence star) of magnitude 4.71. It has an absolute magnitude of 4.4 and is 41 light-years from Earth. It has very weak emissions in the infrared spectrum, like Epsilon Aurigae. In photometric observations of Epsilon, an unusual variable, Lambda is commonly used as a comparison star. It is reaching the end of its hydrogen-fusing lifespan at an age of 6.2 billion years. It also has an unusually high radial velocity at 83 km/second. Though older than the Sun, it is similar in many ways; its mass is 1.07 solar masses, a radius of 1.3 solar radii, and a rotational period of 26 days. However, it differs from the Sun in its metallicity; its iron content is 1.15 times that of the Sun and it has relatively less nitrogen and carbon. Like Delta, it has several optical companions and is often categorized as a single star. The brightest companions are of magnitude 10, separated by 175 and 203 arcseconds. The dimmer companions are of magnitude 13 and 14, 87 and 310 arcseconds from Lambda, respectively.

Nu Aurigae is a G9.5III (G-type giant) star of magnitude 3.97, 230 light-years from Earth. It has a luminosity of and an absolute magnitude of 0.2. Nu is a giant star with a radius of 20–21 solar radii and a mass of approximately 3 solar masses. It may technically be a binary star; its companion, sometimes listed as optical and separated by 56 arcseconds, is a dwarf star of spectral type K6 and magnitude 11.4. Its period is more than 120,000 years and it orbits at least 3,700 AU from the primary.

==== Eclipsing binary stars ====

The most prominent variable star in Auriga is Epsilon Aurigae (Al Maz, Almaaz), an F0 class eclipsing binary star with an unusually long period of 27 years; its last minima occurred in 1982–1984 and 2009–2011. The distance to the system is disputed, variously cited as 4600 and 2,170 light-years. The primary is a white supergiant, and the secondary may be itself a binary star within a large dusty disk. Its maximum magnitude is 3.0, but it stays at a minimum magnitude of 3.8 for around a year; its most recent eclipse began in 2009. The primary has an absolute magnitude of −8.5 and an unusually high luminosity of , the reason it appears so bright at such a great distance. Epsilon Aurigae is the longest-period eclipsing binary currently known. The first observed eclipse of Epsilon Aurigae occurred in 1821, though its variable status was not confirmed until the eclipse of 1847–48. From that time forward, many theories were put forth as to the nature of the eclipsing component. Epsilon Aurigae has a noneclipsing component, which is visible as a 14th magnitude companion separated from the primary by 28.6 arcseconds. It was discovered by Sherburne Wesley Burnham in 1891 at the Dearborn Observatory, and is about 0.5 light-years from the primary.

Another eclipsing binary in Auriga, part of the &quot;Haedi&quot; asterism with Eta Aurigae, is Zeta Aurigae (Sadatoni), an eclipsing binary star at a distance of 776 light-years with a period of 2 years and 8 months. It has an absolute magnitude of −2.3. The primary is an orange-hued K5II-type star (K-type bright giant) and the secondary is a smaller blue star similar to Regulus; its period is 972 days. The secondary is a B7V-type star, a B-type main-sequence star. Zeta Aurigae&#x27;s maximum magnitude is 3.7 and its minimum magnitude is 4.0. The full eclipse of the small blue star by the orange giant lasts 38 days, with two partial phases of 32 days at the beginning and end. The primary has a diameter of 150 D☉ and a luminosity of ; the secondary has a diameter of 4 D☉ and a luminosity of . Zeta Aurigae was spectroscopically determined to be a double star by Antonia Maury in 1897 and was confirmed as a binary star in 1908 by William Wallace Campbell. The two stars orbit each other about apart. Zeta Aurigae is moving away from Earth at a rate of per second. The second of the two &quot;Haedi&quot; or &quot;Kids&quot; is Eta Aurigae, a B3 class star located 243 light-years from Earth with a magnitude of 3.17. It is a B3V class star, meaning that it is a blue-white hued main-sequence star. Eta Aurigae has an absolute magnitude of −1.7 and a luminosity of . Eta Aurigae is moving away from Earth at a rate of per second.

T Aurigae (Nova Aurigae 1891) was a nova discovered at magnitude 5.0 on January 23, 1892, by Thomas David Anderson. It became visible to the naked eye by December 10, 1891, as shown on photographic plates examined after the nova&#x27;s discovery. It then brightened by a factor of 2.5 from December 11 to December 20, when it reached a maximum magnitude of 4.4. T Aurigae faded slowly in January and February 1892, then faded quickly during March and April, reaching a magnitude of 15 in late April. However, its brightness began to increase in August, reaching magnitude 9.5, where it stayed until 1895. Over the subsequent two years, its brightness decreased to 11.5, and by 1903, it was approximately 14th magnitude. By 1925, it had reached its current magnitude of 15.5. When the nova was discovered, its spectrum showed material moving at a high speed towards Earth. However, when the spectrum was examined again in August 1892, it appeared to be a planetary nebula. Observations at the Lick Observatory by Edward Emerson Barnard showed it to be disc-shaped, with clear nebulosity in a diameter of 3 arcseconds. The shell had a diameter of 12 arcseconds in 1943. T Aurigae is classified as a slow nova, similar to DQ Herculis. Like DQ Herculis, WZ Sagittae, Nova Persei 1901 and Nova Aquilae 1918, it is a very close binary with a very short period. T Aurigae&#x27;s period of 4.905 hours is comparable to DQ Herculis&#x27;s period of 4.65 hours, and it has a partial eclipse period of 40 minutes.

==== Other variable stars ====

There are many other variable stars of different types in Auriga. ψ1 Aurigae (Dolones) is an orange-hued supergiant, which ranges between magnitudes 4.8 and 5.7, though not with a regular period. It has a spectral class of K5Iab, an average magnitude of 4.91, and an absolute magnitude of −5.7. Dolones is 3,976 light-years from Earth. RT Aurigae is a Cepheid variable which ranges between magnitudes 5.0 and 5.8 over a period of 3.7 days. A yellow-white supergiant, it lies at a distance of 1,600 light-years. It was discovered to be variable by English amateur T.H. Astbury in 1905. It has a spectral class of F81bv, meaning that it is an F-type supergiant star. RX Aurigae is a Cepheid variable as well; it varies in magnitude from a minimum of 8.0 to a maximum of 7.3; its spectral class is G0Iabv. It has a period of 11.62 days. RW Aurigae is the prototype of its class of irregular variable stars. Its variability was discovered in 1906 by Lydia Ceraski at the Moscow Observatory. RW Aurigae&#x27;s spectrum indicates a turbulent stellar atmosphere, and has prominent emission lines of calcium and hydrogen. Its spectral type is G5V:e. SS Aurigae is an SS Cygni-type variable star, classified as an explosive dwarf. Discovered by Emil Silbernagel in 1907, it is almost always at its minimum magnitude of 15, but brightens to a maximum up to 60 times brighter than the minimum an average of every 55 days, though the period can range from 50 days to more than 100 days. It takes about 24 hours for the star to go from its minimum to maximum magnitude. SS Aurigae is a very close binary star with a period of 4 hours and 20 minutes. Both components are small subdwarf stars; there has been dispute in the scientific community about which star originates the outbursts. UU Aurigae is a variable red giant star at a distance of 2,000 light-years. It has a period of approximately 234 days and ranges between magnitudes 5.0 and 7.0.

AE Aurigae is a blue-hued main-sequence variable star. It is normally of magnitude 6.0, but its magnitude varies irregularly. AE Aurigae is associated with the 9-light-year-wide Flaming Star Nebula (IC 405), which it illuminates. However, AE Aurigae likely entered the nebula only recently, as determined through the discrepancy between the radial velocities of the star and the nebula, per second and per second, respectively. It has been hypothesized that AE Aurigae is a &quot;runaway star&quot; from the young cluster in the Orion Nebula, leaving the cluster approximately 2.7 million years ago. It is similar to 53 Arietis and Mu Columbae, other runaway stars from the Orion cluster. Its spectral class is O9.5Ve, meaning that it is an O-type main-sequence star. The Flaming Star Nebula, is located near IC 410 in the celestial sphere. IC 410 obtained its name from its appearance in long exposure astrophotographs; it has extensive filaments that make AE Aurigae appear to be on fire.

There are four Mira variable stars in Auriga: R Aurigae, UV Aurigae, U Aurigae, and X Aurigae, all of which are type M stars. More specifically, R Aurigae is of type M7III, UV Aurigae is of type C6 (a carbon star), U Aurigae is of type M9, and X Aurigae is of type K2. R Aurigae, with a period of 457.5 days, ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 13.9 to a maximum of 6.7. UV Aurigae, with a period of 394.4 days, ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 10.6 to a maximum of 7.4. U Aurigae, with a period of 408.1 days, ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 13.5 to a maximum of 7.5. X Aurigae, with a particularly short period of 163.8 days, ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 13.6 to a maximum of 8.0.

==== Binary and double stars ====

Auriga is home to several less prominent binary and double stars. Theta Aurigae (Bogardus, Mahasim) is a blue-white A0p class binary star of magnitude 2.62 with a luminosity of . It has an absolute magnitude of 0.1 and is 165 light-years from Earth. The secondary is a yellow star of magnitude 7.1, which requires a telescope of in aperture to resolve; the two stars are separated by 3.6 arcseconds. It is the eastern vertex of the constellation&#x27;s pentagon. Theta Aurigae is moving away from Earth at a rate of per second. Theta Aurigae additionally has a second optical companion, discovered by Otto Wilhelm von Struve in 1852. The separation was at 52 arcseconds in 1978 and has been increasing since then because of the proper motion of Theta Aurigae, 0.1 arcseconds per year. The separation of this magnitude 9.2 component was 2.2 arcminutes (130.7 arcseconds) in 2007 with an angle of 350°. 4 Aurigae is a double star at a distance of 159 light-years. The primary is of magnitude 5.0 and the secondary is of magnitude 8.1. 14 Aurigae is a white optical binary star. The primary is of magnitude 5.0 and is at a distance of 270 light-years; the secondary is of magnitude 7.9 and is at a distance of 82 light-years. HD 30453 is spectroscopic binary of magnitude 5.9, with a spectral type assessed as either A8m or F0m, and a period of seven days.

==== Stars with planetary systems ====

There are several stars with confirmed planetary systems in Auriga; there is also a white dwarf with a suspected planetary system. HD 40979 has one planet, HD 40979 b. It was discovered in 2002 through radial velocity measurements on the parent star. HD 40979 is 33.3 parsecs from Earth, a spectral class F8V star of magnitude 6.74 — just past the limit of visibility to the naked eye. It is of similar size to the Sun, at 1.1 solar masses and 1.21 solar radii. The planet, with a mass of 3.83 Jupiter masses, orbits with a semi-major axis of 0.83 AU and a period of 263.1 days. HD 45350 has one planet as well. HD 45350 b was discovered through radial velocity measurements in 2004. It has a mass of 1.79 Jupiter masses and orbits every 890.76 days at a distance of 1.92 AU. Its parent star is faint, at an apparent magnitude of 7.88, a G5IV type star 49 parsecs away. It has a mass of 1.02 solar masses and a radius of 1.27 solar radii. HD 43691 b is a significantly larger planet, with a mass of 2.49 Jupiter masses; it is also far closer to its parent star, HD 43691. Discovered in 2007 from radial velocity measurements,
it orbits at a distance of 0.24 AU with a period of 36.96 days. HD 43691 has a radius identical to the Sun&#x27;s, though it is more dense—its mass is 1.38 solar masses. It is a G0IV type star of magnitude 8.03, 93.2 parsecs from Earth.

HD 49674 is a star in Auriga with one planet orbiting it. This G3V type star is faint, at magnitude 8.1, and fairly distant, at 40.7 parsecs from Earth. Like the other stars, it is similar in size to the Sun, with a mass of 1.07 solar masses and a radius of 0.94 solar radii. Its planet, HD 49674 b, is a smaller planet, at 0.115 Jupiter masses. It orbits very close to its star, at 0.058 AU, every 4.94 days. HD 49674 b was discovered by radial velocity observations in 2002. HAT-P-9 b is the first transiting exoplanet confirmed in Auriga, orbiting the star HAT-P-9. Unlike the other exoplanets in Auriga, detected by radial velocity measurements, HAT-P-9 b was detected using the transit method in 2008. It has a mass of 0.67 Jupiter masses and orbits just 0.053 AU from its parent star, with a period of 3.92 days; its radius is 1.4 Jupiter radii, making it a hot Jupiter. Its parent star, HAT-P-9, is an F-type star approximately 480 parsecs from Earth. It has a mass of 1.28 solar masses and a radius of 1.32 solar radii.

The star KELT-2A (HD 42176A) is the brightest star in Auriga known to host a transiting exoplanet, KELT-2Ab, and is the fifth-brightest transit hosting star overall. The brightness of the star KELT-2A allows the mass and radius of the planet KELT-2Ab to be known quite precisely. KELT-2Ab is 1.524 Jupiter masses and 1.290 Jupiter radii and on a 4.11-day-long orbit, making it another hot Jupiter, similar to HAT-P-9b. The star KELT-2A is a late F-dwarf and is one member of the common-proper-motion binary star system KELT-2. KELT-2B is an early K-dwarf about 295 AU away, and was discovered the same time as the exoplanet.

=== Deep-sky objects ===

Auriga has the galactic anticenter, about 3.5° to the east of Beta Aurigae. This is the point on the celestial sphere opposite the Galactic Center; it is the edge of the galactic plane roughly nearest to the solar system. Ignoring nearby bright stars in the foreground this is a smaller and less luminous part of the Milky Way than looking towards the rest of its arms or central bar and has dust bands of the outer spiral arms. Auriga has many open clusters and other objects; rich star-forming arms of the Milky Way - including the Perseus Arm and the Orion–Cygnus Arm - run through it. The three brightest open clusters are M36, M37 and M38, all of which are visible in binoculars or a small telescope in suburban skies. A larger telescope resolves individual stars. Three other open clusters are NGC 2281, lying close to ψ7 Aurigae, NGC 1664, which is close to ε Aurigae, and IC 410 (surrounding NGC 1893), a cluster with nebulosity next to IC 405, the Flaming Star Nebula, found about midway between M38 and ι Aurigae. AE Aurigae, a runaway star, is a bright variable star currently within the Flaming Star Nebula.

M36 (NGC 1960) is a young galactic open cluster with approximately 60 stars, most of which are relatively bright; however, only about 40 stars are visible in most amateur instruments. It is at a distance of 3,900 light-years and has an overall magnitude of 6.0; it is 14 light-years wide. Its apparent diameter is 12.0 arcminutes. Of the three open clusters in Auriga, M36 is both the smallest and the most concentrated, though its brightest stars are approximately 9th magnitude. It was discovered in 1749 by Guillaume Le Gentil, the first of Auriga&#x27;s major open clusters to be discovered. M36 features a 10-arcminute-wide knot of bright stars in its center, anchored by Struve 737, a double star with components separated by 10.7 arcseconds. Most of the stars in M36 are B type stars with rapid rates of rotation. M36&#x27;s Trumpler class is given as both I 3 r and II 3 m. Besides the central knot, most of the cluster&#x27;s other stars appear in smaller knots and groups.

M37 (NGC 2099) is an open cluster, larger than M36 and at a distance of 4,200 light-years. It has 150 stars, making it the richest cluster in Auriga; the most prominent member is an orange star that appears at the center. M37 is approximately 25 light-years in diameter. It is the brightest open cluster in Auriga with a magnitude of 5.6; it has an apparent diameter of 23.0 arcminutes. M37 was discovered in 1764 by Charles Messier, the first of many astronomers to laud its beauty. It was described as &quot;a virtual cloud of glittering stars&quot; by Robert Burnham, Jr. and Charles Piazzi Smyth commented that the star field was &quot;strewed ...with sparkling gold-dust&quot;. The stars of M37 are older than those of M36; they are approximately 200 million years old. Most of the constituent stars are A type stars, though there are at least 12 red giants in the cluster as well. M37&#x27;s Trumpler class is given as both I 2 r and II 1 r. The stars visible in a telescope range in magnitude from 9.0 to 13.0; there are two 9th magnitude stars in the center of the cluster and an east to west chain of 10th and 11th magnitude stars.

M38 is a diffuse open cluster at a distance of 3,900 light-years, the least concentrated of the three main open clusters in Auriga; it is classified as a Trumpler Class II 2 r or III 2 r cluster because of this. It appears as a cross-shaped or pi-shaped object in a telescope and contains approximately 100 stars; its overall magnitude is 6.4. M38, like M36, was discovered by Guillaume Le Gentil in 1749. It has an apparent diameter of approximately 20 arcseconds and a true diameter of about 25 light-years. Unlike M36 or M37, M38 has a varied stellar population. The majority of the population consists of A and B type main sequence stars, the B type stars being the oldest members, and a number of G type giant stars. One yellow-hued G type star is the brightest star in M38 at a magnitude of 7.9. The brightest stars in M38 are magnitude 9 and 10. M38 is accompanied by NGC 1907, a smaller and dimmer cluster that lies half a degree south-southwest of M38; it is at a distance of 4,200 light-years. The smaller cluster has an overall magnitude of 8.2 and a diameter of 6.0 arcminutes, making it about a third the size of M38. However, NGC 1907 is a rich cluster, classified as a Trumpler Class I 1 m n cluster. It has approximately 12 stars of magnitude 9–10, and at least 25 stars of magnitude 9–12.

IC 410, a faint nebula, is accompanied by the bright open cluster NGC 1893. The cluster is thin, with a diameter of 12 arcminutes and a population of approximately 20 stars. Its accompanying nebula has very low surface brightness, partially because of its diameter of 40 arcminutes. It appears in an amateur telescope with brighter areas in the north and south; the brighter southern patch shows a pattern of darker and lighter spots in a large instrument. NGC 1893, of magnitude 7.5, is classified as a Trumpler Class II 3 r n or II 2 m n cluster, meaning that it is not very large and is somewhat bright. The cluster possesses approximately 30 stars of magnitude 9–12. In an amateur instrument, IC 410 is only visible with an Oxygen-III filter. NGC 2281 is a small open cluster at a distance of 1,500 light-years. It contains 30 stars in a crescent shape. It has an overall magnitude of 5.4 and a fairly large diameter of 14.0 arcseconds, classified as a Trumpler Class I 3 m cluster. The brightest star in the cluster is magnitude 8; there are approximately 12 stars of magnitude 9–10 and 20 stars of magnitude 11–13.

NGC 1931 is a nebula in Auriga, slightly more than one degree to the west of M36. It is considered to be a difficult target for an amateur telescope. NGC 1931 has an approximate integrated magnitude of 10.1; it is 3 by 3 arcminutes. However, it appears to be elongated in an amateur telescope. Some observers may note a green hue in the nebula; a large telescope will easily show the nebula&#x27;s &quot;peanut&quot; shape, as well as the quartet of stars that are engulfed by the nebula. The open cluster portion of NGC 1931 is classed as a I 3 p n cluster; the nebula portion is classed as both an emission and reflection nebula. NGC 1931 is approximately 6,000 light-years from Earth and could easily be confused with a comet in the eyepiece of a telescope.

NGC 1664 is a fairly large open cluster, with a diameter of 18 arcminutes, and moderately bright, with a magnitude of 7.6, comparable to several other open clusters in Auriga. One open cluster with a similar magnitude is NGC 1778, with a magnitude of 7.7. This small cluster has a diameter of 7 arcminutes and contains 25 stars. NGC 1857, a small cluster, is slightly brighter at magnitude 7.0. It has a diameter of 6 arcminutes and contains 40 stars, making it far more concentrated than the similar-sized NGC 1778. Far dimmer than the other open clusters is NGC 2126 at magnitude 10.2. Despite its dimness, NGC 2126 is as concentrated as NGC 1857, having 40 stars in a diameter of 6 arcminutes.

=== Meteor showers ===

Auriga is home to two meteor showers. The Aurigids, named for the entire constellation and formerly called the &quot;Alpha Aurigids&quot;, are renowned for their intermittent outbursts, such as those in 1935, 1986, 1994, and 2007. They are associated with the comet Kiess (C/1911 N1), discovered in 1911 by Carl Clarence Kiess. The association was discovered after the outburst in 1935 by Cuno Hoffmeister and Arthur Teichgraeber. The Aurigid outburst on September 1, 1935, prompted the investigation of a connection with Comet Kiess, though the 24-year delay between the comet&#x27;s return caused doubt in the scientific community. However, the outburst in 1986 erased much of this doubt. Istvan Teplickzky, a Hungarian amateur meteor observer, observed many bright meteors radiating from Auriga in a fashion very similar to the confirmed 1935 outburst. Because the position of Teplickzky&#x27;s observed radiant and the 1935 radiant were close to the position of Comet Kiess, the comet was confirmed as the source of the Aurigid meteor stream.

The Aurigids had a spectacular outburst in 1994, when many grazing meteors—those that have a shallow angle of entry and seem to rise from the horizon—were observed in California. The meteors were tinted blue and green, moved slowly, and left trails at least 45° long. Because they had such a shallow angle of entry, some 1994 Aurigids lasted up to 2 seconds. Though there were only a few visual observers for part of the outburst, the 1994 Aurigids peak, which lasted less than two hours, was later confirmed by Finnish amateur radio astronomer Ilkka Yrjölä. The connection with Comet Kiess was finally confirmed in 1994. The 2007 outburst of the Aurigids was predicted by Peter Jenniskens and was observed by astronomers worldwide. Despite some predictions that there would be no Alpha Aurigid outburst, many bright meteors were observed throughout the shower, which peaked on September 1 as predicted. Much like in the 1994 outburst, the 2007 Aurigids were very bright and often colored blue and green. The maximum zenithal hourly rate was 100 meteors per hour, observed at 4:15 am, California time (12:15 UTC) by a team of astronomers flying on NASA planes.

The Aurigids are normally a placid Class II meteor shower that peaks in the early morning hours of September 1, beginning on August 28 every year. Though the maximum zenithal hourly rate is 2–5 meteors per hour, the Aurigids are fast, with an entry velocity of /sec. The annual Aurigids have a radiant located about two degrees north of Theta Aurigae, a third-magnitude star in the center of the constellation. The Aurigids end on September 4. Some years, the maximum rate has reached 9–30 meteors per hour.

The other meteor showers radiating from Auriga are far less prominent and capricious than the Alpha Aurigids. The Zeta Aurigids are a weak shower with a northern and southern branch lasting from December 11 to January 21. The shower peaks on January 1 and has very slow meteors, with a maximum rate of 1–5 meteors per hour. It was discovered by William Denning in 1886 and was discovered to be the source of rare fireballs by Alexander Stewart Herschel. There is another faint stream of meteors called the &quot;Aurigids&quot;, unrelated to the September shower. This shower lasts from January 31 to February 23, peaking from February 5 through February 10; its slow meteors peak at a rate of approximately 2 per hour. The Delta Aurigids are a faint shower radiating from Auriga. It was discovered by a group of researchers at New Mexico State University and has a very low peak rate. The Delta Aurigids last from September 22 through October 23, peaking between October 6 and October 15. They may be related to the September Epsilon Perseids, though they are more similar to the Coma Berenicids in that the Delta Aurigids last longer and have a dearth of bright meteors. They too have a hypothesized connection to an unknown short period retrograde comet. The Iota Aurigids are a hypothesized shower occurring in mid-November; its parent body may be the asteroid 2000 NL10, but this connection is highly disputed. The hypothesized Iota Aurigids may instead be a faint stream of Taurids.

<text>An auriga (plural aurigae) was a slave who drove vehicles in the Roman circuses. The position of auriga was a dangerous one as the aurigae drove with the reins wrapped around his waist. In case of accident, the auriga also wore a curved knife (falx) stuck in the waistband.

In ancient Rome, chariot racing was a favorite pastime. A successful charioteer’s prize earnings in a day could surpass a teacher’s annual earnings. Most charioteers were slaves, and many were foreigners, who entered the sport to garner fame and fortune. Aurigas were also employed as charioteers for important men. The auriga would drive a &quot;biga&quot;, the light vehicle powered by two horses, to transport some important Romans, mainly &quot;duces&quot; (military commanders). An auriga was a sort of &quot;chauffeur&quot; for important men and was carefully selected from among trustworthy slaves only.

It has also been speculated that this name was given to the slave who held a laurel crown, during Roman Triumphs, over the head of the &quot;dux&quot;, standing at his back but continuously whispering in his ears &quot;&quot; (&quot;remember you are mortal&quot;) to prevent the celebrated commander from losing his sense of proportion in the excesses of the celebrations.

The term became common in later times to indicate any &quot;biga&quot; driver.

<text>The Barbican Estate, or Barbican, is a residential complex of around 2,000 flats, maisonettes and houses in central London, England, within the City of London. It is in an area once devastated by World War II bombings and densely populated by financial institutions, 1.4 miles (2.2 km) north east of Charing Cross. Originally built as rental housing for middle- and upper-middle-class professionals, it remains an upmarket residential estate. It contains, or is adjacent to, the Barbican Arts Centre, the Museum of London, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, the Barbican public library, the City of London School for Girls and a YMCA (now closed), forming the &quot;Barbican Complex&quot;.

The Barbican Complex is a prominent example of British brutalist architecture and is Grade II listed as a whole, with the exception of the former Milton Court, which once contained a fire station, medical facilities and some flats but was demolished to allow the construction of a new apartment tower—named The Heron—which also provides additional facilities for the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.

==History==

The main fort of Roman London was built between 90 and 120 AD south-east of where the Museum of London now stands at the corner of London Wall and Aldersgate Street. Around 200 AD, walls were built around the city that incorporated the old fort, which became a grand entrance known as Cripplegate. The word &quot;barbican&quot; comes from the Low Latin word &quot;Barbecana&quot;, which referred to a fortified outpost or gateway, such as an outer defence of a city or castle or any tower situated over a gate or bridge that was used for defence purposes. In this case there seems to have been a Roman &quot;specula&quot; or watchtower in front of the fort from numbers 33–35 onwards on the north side of the street formerly called Barbican (now the west end of Beech St), which was later incorporated into the fortifications north of the wall. The Normans called it the &quot;Basse-cour&quot; or Base Court, synonymous with the modern word &quot;bailey&quot; and still applied to the outer courtyard of Hampton Court Palace.
The Base Court continued to serve a military function during the reign of Edward I, but Edward III gave it to Robert d&#x27;Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk, who made it his London home. By the 16th century it had passed to Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. Brandon married his ward Catherine Willoughby, daughter of María de Salinas, who had been a confidante and lady-in-waiting of Catherine of Aragon, and after his death the building was retained by the Willoughby family. The original Base Court seems to have been destroyed and the large building that replaced it was called Willoughby House, a name revived for part of the modern development. The house was later owned by Thomas Egerton, Lord Ellesmere, and later named Bridgewater House after the title bestowed on John Egerton in 1617.

The Barbican terrace blocks and residences, including the green garden in the centre, are laid on an area just outside the city fortifications, to the north west of the surviving London Wall and bastions. Most of the residences and the green square, as well as some of the area to the south, currently occupied by the Museum of London, are on an area that was previously the cemetery serving the London Jewish community before their expulsion. Records of transactions of the time show that the cemetery had been expanded several times through the acquisition of property by the Jews between 1268 and 1290. The Jews were expelled from England in 1290, and on 12 July 1291 Edward I granted the site of the cemetery to Master William de Montford, who was Dean of St Paul&#x27;s but seems to have held this land privately. Archaeological excavations were undertaken on part of the cemetery site prior to construction of the Barbican and the results of these investigations were published in Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England (JHSE) in 1961.

===Post-war development===
During World War II the City suffered serious damage and loss of life. The Cripplegate ward was virtually demolished and by 1951 the resident population of the City stood at 5,324, of whom 48 lived in Cripplegate. Discussions began in 1952 about the future of the site, and the decision to build new residential properties was taken by the Court of Common Council on 19 September 1957.

To accommodate the estate, of the Metropolitan line was realigned between Barbican and Moorgate stations between 1963 and 1965.

The estate was built between 1965 and 1976, on a site. The complex was designed by architects Chamberlin, Powell and Bon, whose first work was the ground-breaking Golden Lane Estate immediately north of the Barbican. Unlike its northern neighbour, however, the Barbican Estate was not social housing. Rather, it was designed and built for affluent City professionals and their families, with all flats let out at commercial rents by the Corporation of London. To help let out the flats, brochures were produced advertising the Barbican Estate as containing the perfect residences for well-heeled professionals and international businesspeople. Indeed, in its early years, a substantial number of high-profile politicians, lawyers, judges and bankers made their home here (see &quot;famous residents&quot;).

The Barbican was never &#x27;council housing&#x27; in the conventional sense, since flats were targeted at professionals and let at &#x27;market&#x27; rents, i.e. for similar prices to equivalent private homes in Central London. It was, however, owned and managed by the Corporation of the City of London, considered a local authority under the Housing Act 1980. This meant that Right to Buy applied to it, and, as a result, almost all flats are now privately owned, although a few continue to be let out by the City of London at market (non-subsidised) rents.

The first building on the estate, Speed House, was officially opened in 1969, though extensive industrial disputes in the 1970s led to the last building, Shakespeare Tower, being completed only in 1976. It is now home to around 4,000 people living in 2,014 flats. The flats reflect the widespread use in Britain in the 1960s and 1970s of concrete as the visible face of the building. The complex is also characterised by its total separation of vehicles from pedestrians throughout the area (&quot;slab urbanism&quot;). This is achieved through the use of &#x27;highwalks&#x27;—walkways of varying width and shape, usually 1 to 3 storeys above the surrounding ground level. Most pedestrian circulation takes place on these highwalks whilst roads and car-parking spaces are relegated to the lower level.

The Minister for the Arts, Tessa Blackstone, announced in September 2001 that the Barbican complex was to be Grade II listed. It has been designated a site of special architectural interest for its scale, its cohesion and the ambition of the project. The complex is architecturally important as it is one of London&#x27;s principal examples of concrete brutalist architecture and considered a landmark.

Various garden features punctuate the brutalist architecture, including a community-run wildlife garden.

==Blocks and towers==
The residential estate consists of four tower blocks, 13 terrace blocks, two mews and &quot;The Postern&quot;, &quot;Wallside&quot; and &quot;Milton Court&quot;.

===The terrace blocks===

These are grouped around a lake and green squares. The main buildings rise up to seven floors above a podium level, which links all the facilities in the Barbican, providing a pedestrian route above street level. Some maisonettes are built into the podium structure. There is no vehicular access within the estate, but there are some car parks at its periphery. Public car parks are located within the Barbican Centre.

The terrace blocks are named:
* &quot;Andrewes House&quot; – named after Lancelot Andrewes the 16th-century English bishop and scholar
* &quot;Breton House&quot; – named after Nicholas Breton, the 16th-century English poet and novelist
* &quot;Bryer Court&quot; – named after &quot;W. Bryer &amp; Sons&quot; gold refiners and assayers premises were Numbers 53 and 54 and demolished to make way for the building
* &quot;Bunyan Court&quot; – named after John Bunyan, the 17th-century English writer and Baptist preacher
* &quot;Defoe House&quot; – named after Daniel Defoe, the English novelist and spy
* &quot;Frobisher Crescent&quot; – named after Martin Frobisher, English seaman and privateer
* &quot;Gilbert House&quot; – named after Sir Humphrey Gilbert, English adventurer and privateer
* &quot;Ben Jonson House&quot; – named after Ben Jonson, the English playwright, poet and actor
* &quot;Thomas More House&quot; – named after Sir Thomas More, English lawyer, statesman and social philosopher and saint in the Catholic Church
* &quot;Mountjoy House&quot; – named after &quot;Christopher Mountjoy&quot;, the French wig-maker who let a room to William Shakespeare
* &quot;Seddon House&quot; – named after George Seddon, English cabinetmaker
* &quot;Speed House&quot; – named after John Speed, English cartographer and explorer
* &quot;John Trundle Court&quot; – named after John Trundle, a London publisher and bookseller
* &quot;Willoughby House&quot; – named after Catherine Willoughby English noblewoman and courtier

===Tower blocks===

The estate also contains three of London&#x27;s tallest residential towers, at 42 storeys and high. The top two or three floors of each block comprise three penthouse flats. The towers are:

* Cromwell Tower, completed in 1973 – named after Oliver Cromwell
* , completed in 1974 – named after the Earls of Lauderdale
* Shakespeare Tower, completed in 1976 – named after William Shakespeare
* Blake Tower, completed in 1971 – originally a YMCA but was converted to flats in 2015

Once the tallest residential towers in London, they were surpassed by the Pan Peninsula development on the Isle of Dogs.

==Barbican complex==
The Barbican Estate also contains the Barbican Centre (an arts, drama and business venue), the Barbican public library, the City of London School for Girls, the Museum of London, and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. A YMCA building was constructed between 1965 and 1968 to link the Barbican and Golden Lane Estate; it is also listed. In 2015–16, the YMCA building was converted by Redrow Homes into a new residential block called Blake Tower with 74 flats run as part of the Barbican Estate.

The Barbican complex also is centered around St Giles Cripplegate, which survived the bombings of World War 2. Remnants of the London Wall, built in Roman era can be seen from the balconies of apartments and in the park area

==Notable residents==
The Barbican has had a number of well-known residents throughout its history, especially in the years immediately after it was completed, when it was considered one of the most prestigious residential developments in London. Notable residents have included:

* Conservative Cabinet Minister Norman Tebbit, who lived in a house on Wallside with his wife until the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing
* Leader of the Labour Party John Smith, who lived in Cromwell Tower with his family until his death in 1994
* Former leader of the National Union of Mineworkers Arthur Scargill
* Former Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto
* Andrew Bruce, 11th Earl of Elgin
* Film and theatre director Sir Peter Hall
* Footballer George Best
* Investment adviser, commentator and author Bob Beckman
* Author, journalist, and broadcaster Brian Redhead
* Senior British judge and Master of the Rolls John Donaldson and his wife, the first female Lord Mayor of London Mary Donaldson
* Artist Sir Michael Craig-Martin
* Newspaper cartoonist Frank Dickens
* Journalist and political activist S. W. Alexander
* Writer and conservationist Robert Aickman lived in Willoughby House until 1977

==In popular culture==

The Barbican features in Michael Paraskos&#x27;s novel &quot;In Search of Sixpence&quot; as the home of the lead character, Geroud, and also a bar called &quot;The Gin Bar&quot; loosely based on the Gin Joint bar at the Barbican Centre. Clive James&#x27;s 1987 novel &quot;The Remake&quot; also used the Barbican as a major setting.

In the 2024 series of &quot;Call the Midwife&quot;, Nurse Trixie Aylward mentions she and her husband Matthew will be moving to the Barbican Estate once their property is finished.

The final scene of the 1983 vampire film, &quot;The Hunger&quot;, directed by Tony Scott and starring David Bowie, Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon, was filmed in Cromwell Tower.

The estate&#x27;s Shakespeare Tower is featured in the 2000 film &quot;Gangster No. 1&quot; as the home of the two main characters. This is an anachronism, as the film begins in 1968 and the tower was not constructed until 1976.

The Barbican towers can be seen in a sequence from the 1975 Disney film &quot;One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing&quot;, an unintentional anachronism for a film set in the 1920s.

The Barbican was also used to represent the MI6 headquarters in the James Bond film &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;.

Various shots of the Barbican towers are shown on the inner record cover of the 1979 album &quot;Real to Real Cacophony&quot; by the Scottish rock band Simple Minds.

The Barbican Estate is mentioned by name in the intro to English band Saint Etienne&#x27;s song &quot;Language Lab&quot;, from their 2002 &quot;Finisterre&quot; album.

The titular skyscraper in J. G. Ballard&#x27;s novel &quot;High Rise&quot; (and subsequent film) is largely inspired by the Barbican Estate&#x27;s towers.

The estate&#x27;s Lauderdale Tower is home to fictional character Alice Morgan, a psychopathic murderer, in the BBC series &quot;Luther&quot;. Morgan lives in a sparsely furnished minimalist apartment on one of the tower&#x27;s upper floors.

The estate is prominently featured in Skepta&#x27;s &quot;Shutdown&quot; music video.

The estate is featured in several scenes of the Apple TV show &quot;Slow Horses&quot;. The show is focused on a group of MI5 agents working in Slough House based at 126 Aldersgate Street, which is opposite the Barbican Estate.

The estate is featured in several scenes of the Star Wars TV show &quot;Andor&quot;. The brutalist complex was used as the backdrop for the fictional city world of Coruscant.

<doc id="209963" wikidata="Q1192753" url="?curid=209963" title="Fluid bearing">
<text>Fluid bearings are bearings in which the load is supported by a thin layer of rapidly moving pressurized liquid or gas between the bearing surfaces. Since there is no contact between the moving parts, there is no sliding friction, allowing fluid bearings to have lower friction, wear and vibration than many other types of bearings. Thus, it is possible for some fluid bearings to have near-zero wear if operated correctly.

They can be broadly classified into two types: fluid dynamic bearings (also known as hydrodynamic bearings) and hydrostatic bearings. Hydrostatic bearings are externally pressurized fluid bearings, where the fluid is usually oil, water or air, and is pressurized by a pump. Hydrodynamic bearings rely on the high speed of the journal (the part of the shaft resting on the fluid) to pressurize the fluid in a wedge between the faces. Fluid bearings are frequently used in high load, high speed or high precision applications where ordinary ball bearings would have shortened life or caused high noise and vibration. They are also used increasingly to reduce cost. For example, hard disk drive motor fluid bearings are both quieter and cheaper than the ball bearings they replace. Applications are very versatile and may even be used in complex geometries such as leadscrews.

The fluid bearing may have been invented by French civil engineer L. D. Girard, who in 1852 proposed a system of railway propulsion incorporating water-fed hydraulic bearings.

==Operation==
Fluid bearings are noncontact bearings that use a thin layer of rapidly moving pressurized liquid or gas fluid between the moving bearing faces, typically sealed around or under the rotating shaft. The moving parts do not come into contact, so there is no sliding friction; the load force is supported solely by the pressure of the moving fluid. There are two principal ways of getting the fluid into the bearing:

*In fluid static, hydrostatic and many gas or air bearings, the fluid is pumped in through an orifice or through a porous material. Such bearings should be equipped with the shaft position control system, which adjusts the fluid pressure and consumption according to the rotation speed and shaft load. 
*In fluid-dynamic bearings, the bearing rotation sucks the fluid on to the inner surface of the bearing, forming a lubricating wedge under or around the shaft.

Hydrostatic bearings rely on an external pump. The power required by that pump contributes to system energy loss, just as bearing friction otherwise would. Better seals can reduce leak rates and pumping power, but may increase friction.

Hydrodynamic bearings rely on bearing motion to suck fluid into the bearing, and may have high friction and short life at speeds lower than design, or during starts and stops. An external pump or secondary bearing may be used for startup and shutdown to prevent damage to the hydrodynamic bearing. A secondary bearing may have high friction and short operating life, but good overall service life if bearing starts and stops are infrequent.

===Hydrodynamic lubrication===
&quot;Hydrodynamic&quot; (HD) &quot;lubrication&quot;, also known as &quot;fluid-film lubrication&quot; has essential elements:

#A lubricant, which must be a viscous fluid. 
#Hydrodynamic flow behavior of fluid between bearing and journal.
#The surfaces between which the fluid films move must be convergent.

Hydrodynamic (full film) lubrication is obtained when two mating surfaces are completely separated by a cohesive film of lubricant.

The thickness of the film thus exceeds the combined roughness of the surfaces. The coefficient of friction is lower than with boundary-layer lubrication. Hydrodynamic lubrication prevents wear in moving parts, and metal to metal contact is prevented.

Hydrodynamic lubrication requires thin, converging fluid films. These fluids can be liquid or gas, so long as they exhibit viscosity. In computer fan and spinning device, like a hard disk drive, heads are supported by hydrodynamic lubrication in which the fluid film is the atmosphere.

The scale of these films is on the order of micrometers. Their convergence creates pressures normal to the surfaces they contact, forcing them apart.

Three types of bearings include:

*Self-acting: Film exists due to relative motion. e.g. spiral groove bearings.
*Squeeze film: Film exists due to relative normal motion.
*Externally-pressurized: Film exists due to external pressurization.

Conceptually the bearings can be thought of as two major geometric classes: bearing-journal (anti-friction), and plane-slider (friction).

The Reynolds equations can be used to derive the governing principles for the fluids. Note that when gases are used, their derivation is much more involved.

The thin films can be thought to have pressure and viscous forces acting on them. Because there is a difference in velocity there will be a difference in the surface traction vectors. Because of mass conservation we can also assume an increase in pressure, making the body forces different.

* Hydrodynamic lubrication – characteristics:
*# Fluid film at the point of minimum thickness decreases in thickness as the load increases
*# Pressure within the fluid mass increases as the film thickness decreases due to load
*# Pressure within the fluid mass is greatest at some point approaching minimum clearance and lowest at the point of maximum clearance (due to divergence)
*# Viscosity increases as pressure increases (more resistance to shear)
*# Film thickness at the point of minimum clearance increases with the use of more viscous fluids
*# With same load, the pressure increases as the viscosity of fluid increases
*# With a given load and fluid, the thickness of the film will increase as speed is increased
*# Fluid friction increases as the viscosity of the lubricant becomes greater
* Hydrodynamic condition – Fluid velocity:
*# Fluid velocity depends on velocity of the journal or rider
*# Increase in relative velocity tends towards a decrease in eccentricity of journal bearing centers
*# This is accompanied by greater minimum film thickness
* Hydrodynamic condition – load:
*# Increase in load decreases minimum film thickness
*# Also increases pressure within the film mass to provide a counteracting force
*# Pressure acts in all directions, hence it tends to squeeze the oil out of the ends of the bearing
*# Increase in pressure increases fluid viscosity
Bearing characteristic number: Since viscosity, velocity, and load determine the characteristics of a hydrodynamic condition, a bearing characteristic number was developed based on the effects of these on film thickness.

: Increase in velocity increases min. film thickness
: Increase in viscosity increases min. film thickness
: Increase in load decreases min. film thickness

Therefore,
: Viscosity × velocity/unit load = a dimensionless number = &quot;C&quot;

&quot;C&quot; is known as the bearing characteristic number.

The value of &quot;C&quot;, to some extent, gives an indication of whether there will be hydrodynamic lubrication or not

==Characteristics of operation==
Fluid bearings can be relatively cheap compared to other bearings with a similar load rating. The bearing can be as simple as two smooth surfaces with seals to keep in the working fluid. In contrast, a conventional rolling-element bearing may require many high-precision rollers with complicated shapes. Hydrostatic and many gas bearings do have the complication and expense of external pumps.

Most fluid bearings require little or no maintenance, and have almost unlimited life. Conventional rolling-element bearings usually have shorter life and require regular maintenance. Pumped hydrostatic and aerostatic (gas) bearing designs retain low friction down to zero speed and need not suffer start/stop wear, provided the pump does not fail.

Fluid bearings generally have very low friction—far better than mechanical bearings. One source of friction in a fluid bearing is the viscosity of the fluid leading to dynamic friction that increases with speed, but static friction is typically negligible. Hydrostatic gas bearings are among the lowest friction bearings even at very high speeds. However, lower fluid viscosity also typically means fluid leaks faster from the bearing surfaces, thus requiring increased power for pumps or friction from seals.

When a roller or ball is heavily loaded, fluid bearings have clearances that change less under load (are &quot;stiffer&quot;) than mechanical bearings. It might seem that bearing stiffness, as with maximum design load, would be a simple function of average fluid pressure and the bearing surface area. In practice, when bearing surfaces are pressed together, the fluid outflow is constricted. This significantly increases the pressure of the fluid between the bearing faces. As fluid bearing faces can be comparatively larger than rolling surfaces, even small fluid pressure differences cause large restoring forces, maintaining the gap.

However, in lightly loaded bearings, such as disk drives, the typical ball bearing stiffnesses are ~10^7 MN/m. Comparable fluid bearings have stiffness of ~10^6 MN/m. Because of this, some fluid bearings, particularly hydrostatic bearings, are deliberately designed to pre-load the bearing to increase the stiffness.

Fluid bearings often inherently add significant damping. This helps attenuate resonances at the gyroscopic frequencies of journal bearings (sometimes called conical or rocking modes).

It is very difficult to make a mechanical bearing which is atomically smooth and round; and mechanical bearings deform in high-speed operation due to centripetal force. In contrast, fluid bearings self-correct for minor imperfections and slight deformations.

Fluid bearings are typically quieter and smoother (more consistent friction) than rolling-element bearings. For example, hard disk drives manufactured with fluid bearings have noise ratings for bearings/motors on the order of 20–24 dB, which is a little more than the background noise of a quiet room. Drives based on rolling-element bearings are typically at least 4 dB noisier.

Fluid bearings can be made with a lower NRRO (non repeatable run out) than a ball or rolling element bearing. This can be critical in modern hard disk drive and ultra precision spindles.

Tilting pad bearings are used as radial bearings for supporting and locating shafts in compressors.

===Disadvantages===
* Bearings must maintain pressure to prevent wear and hydrostatic types may be completely immobile when depressurised.
*Overall power consumption is typically higher compared to ball bearings.
* Power consumption and stiffness or damping greatly vary with temperature, which complicates the design and operation of a fluid bearing in wide temperature range situations.
* Many types of fluid bearings can catastrophically seize under shock situations or unexpected loss of supply pressure. Ball bearings deteriorate more gradually and provide acoustic symptoms.
* Like cage frequency vibration in a ball bearing, the half frequency whirl is a bearing instability that generates eccentric precession which can lead to poor performance and reduced life.
* Fluid leakage; keeping fluid in the bearing can be a challenge for liquid types, vacuum recovery and filtration can be needed in some situations.
* Oil fluid bearings are impractical in environments where oil leakage can be destructive or where maintenance is not economical.
* Fluid bearing &quot;pads&quot; often have to be used in pairs or triples to avoid the bearing tilting and losing the fluid from one side.
* Unlike greaseless mechanical bearings, fluid bearings cannot operate at the extremely low temperatures needed for some specialized scientific research applications.

==Some fluid bearings==

===Foil bearings===

Foil bearings are a type of fluid dynamic air bearing that were introduced in high speed turbine applications in the 1960s by Garrett AiResearch. They use a gas as the working fluid, usually air, and require no external pressurisation system but need careful design to prevent wear during spin-up and spin-down when the bearing makes physical contact.
===Water-lubricated rubber bearings===

Water-lubricated rubber bearings have long cylindrical metal shell that hosts multiple rubber staves separated by axial grooves. The usage of the bearing has three major advantages: (i) pumped water going through the bearing is conveniently used as a lubricant, which reduces pump operation cost; (ii) water flow takes away heat and fine particles through the bearing grooves; and (iii) the natural resilience of rubber gives the bearing good properties for shock and vibration absorption and wear resistance. Water lubricated rubber bearings operate under the condition of mixed-lubrication.
===Air bearings===

Unlike contact-roller bearings, an air bearing (or air caster) utilises a thin film of pressurized air to provide an exceedingly low friction load-bearing interface between surfaces. The two surfaces don&#x27;t touch. Being non-contact, air bearings avoid the traditional bearing-related problems of friction, wear, particulates, and lubricant handling, and offer distinct advantages in precision positioning, such as lacking backlash and stiction, as well as in high-speed applications.

The fluid film of the bearing is air that flows through the bearing itself to the bearing surface. The design of the air bearing is such that, although the air constantly escapes from the bearing gap, the pressure between the faces of the bearing is enough to support the working loads. This pressure may be generated externally (aerostatic) or internally (aerodynamic).

Aerodynamic bearings can only be operated in high-speed applications, aerostatic bearings are required for load bearing at low speed. Both types require highly finished surfaces and precise manufacturing.

====Examples====
Air hockey is a game based on an aerostatic bearing which suspends the puck and players&#x27; paddles to provide low friction and thus sustain high puck speeds. The bearing uses a flat plane with periodic orifices which deliver air just over ambient pressure. The puck and paddles rest on air.

===Michell/Kingsbury tilting-pad fluid bearings===

Michell/Kingsbury fluid dynamic tilting-pad bearings were invented independently and almost simultaneously by both British-born Australian, Anthony George Maldon Michell and American tribologist Albert Kingsbury. Both designs were near-identical except for differences in the approach used for pivoting the pads. Michell mathematically derived the pressure distribution where a span-wise line pivot was placed, allowing the load to act through the point of maximum fluid pressure. The Kingsbury patent lacked this mathematical approach, and the pad&#x27;s pivot point was placed in the geometric centre of the bearing. Michell&#x27;s patent (in Britain and Australia) was granted in 1905, while Kingsbury&#x27;s first patent attempt was 1907. Kingsbury&#x27;s U.S. patent was eventually granted in 1911 after he demonstrated that he had been working on the concept for many years. As stated by Sydney Walker, a long-time employee of Michell&#x27;s, the granting of Kingsbury&#x27;s patent was &quot;a blow which Michell found hard to accept&quot;.

The bearing has sectional &quot;shoes&quot;, or &quot;pads&quot; on pivots. When the bearing is in operation, the rotating part of the bearing carries fresh oil in to the pad area through viscous drag. Fluid pressure causes the pad to tilt slightly, creating a narrow constriction between the shoe and the other bearing surface. A wedge of pressurised fluid builds behind this constriction, separating the moving parts. The tilt of the pad adaptively changes with bearing load and speed. Various design details ensure continued replenishment of the oil to avoid overheating and pad damage.

Michell/Kingsbury fluid bearings are used in a wider variety of heavy-duty rotating equipment, including in hydroelectric plants to support turbines and generators weighing hundreds of tons. They are also used in very heavy machinery, such as marine propeller shafts.

It is likely the first tilting pad bearing in service was built in 1907 by George Weymoth (Pty) Ltd (under A.G.M. Michell&#x27;s guidance) for a centrifugal pump at Cohuna on the Murray River, Victoria, Australia, just two years after Michell had published and patented his three-dimensional solution to Reynold&#x27;s equation. By 1913, the great merits of the tilting-pad bearing had been recognised for marine applications. The first British ship to be fitted out with the bearing was the cross-channel steamboat the &quot;Paris&quot;, but many naval vessels were similarly equipped during the First World War. The practical results were spectacular – the troublesome thrust block became dramatically smaller and lighter, significantly more efficient, and remarkably free from maintenance troubles. It was estimated that the Royal Navy saved coal to a value of £500,000 in 1918 alone as a result of fitting Michell&#x27;s tilting-pad bearings.

According to the ASME (see reference link), the first Michell/Kingsbury fluid bearing in the US was installed in the Holtwood Hydroelectric Power Plant (on the Susquehanna River, near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, US) in 1912. The 2.25-tonne bearing supports a water turbine and electric generator with a rotating mass of about 165 tonnes and water turbine pressure adding another 40 tonnes. The bearing has been in nearly continuous service since 1912, with no parts replaced. The ASME reported it was still in service as of 2000. As of 2002, the manufacturer estimated the bearings at Holtwood should have a maintenance-free life of about 1,300 years.

Until now tilting pad bearings play an essential role for rotating equipment like expanders, pumps, gas or steam turbines or compressors. Next to the traditional babbitt bearings which were used since the early 20th century modern manufacturers like Miba use other materials for example Bronze or Copper-Chromium as well to improve the bearings&#x27; performance.

<doc id="209966" wikidata="Q351701" url="?curid=209966" title="Daniel Goleman">
<text>Daniel Goleman (born March 7, 1946) is an American psychologist, author, and science journalist. For twelve years, he wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reporting on the brain and behavioral sciences. His 1995 book &quot;Emotional Intelligence&quot; was on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for a year and a half, a bestseller in many countries, and is in print worldwide in 40 languages. Apart from his books on emotional intelligence, Goleman has written books on topics including self-deception, creativity, transparency, meditation, social and emotional learning, ecoliteracy and the ecological crisis, and the Dalai Lama&#x27;s vision for the future.

==Biography==
Daniel Goleman grew up in a Jewish household in Stockton, California, the son of Fay Goleman (née Weinberg; 1910–2010), professor of sociology at the University of the Pacific, and Irving Goleman (1898–1961), humanities professor at Stockton College (now San Joaquin Delta College). His maternal uncle was nuclear physicist Alvin M. Weinberg.

Goleman attended Amherst College, graduating &quot;magna cum laude&quot;. He also attended the University of California at Berkeley through Amherst&#x27;s Independent Scholar program. He went on to earn a Ph.D. in clinical psychology at Harvard University.

Goleman studied in India using a pre-doctoral fellowship from Harvard and a post-doctoral grant from the Social Science Research Council. While in India, he spent time with spiritual teacher Neem Karoli Baba, who was also the guru to Ram Dass, Krishna Das, and Larry Brilliant. He wrote his first book based on travel in India and Sri Lanka.

Goleman then returned as a visiting lecturer to Harvard, where during the 1970s his course on the psychology of consciousness was popular. David McClelland, his mentor at Harvard, recommended him for a job at &quot;Psychology Today&quot;, from which he was recruited by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1984.In 1993 Goleman co-founded the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning at Yale University&#x27;s Child Studies Center, which then moved to the University of Illinois at Chicago. Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) the organization&#x27;s mission is to introduce social and emotional learning into the education of students from preschool to high school. Social and emotional learning (SEL) entails the methods by which children and young adults develop and use the knowledge, attitudes, and abilities required to comprehend and regulate emotions, and accomplish constructive goals, empathize with others, form and sustain beneficial relationships, and make ethical choices. Goleman also co-founded Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations (CREIO) in 1996. The organization is dedicated to enhancing the understanding and application of emotional and social intelligence within organizations by fostering the creation and sharing of knowledge. Currently he co-directs the Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations at Rutgers University. He is on the board of the Mind &amp; Life Institute.

==Career==
Goleman was a science journalist at the New York Times until 1996, covering psychology, emotions, and the brain. He was twice nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for his work at the &quot;Times&quot;. While there, he wrote the internationally bestselling book &quot;Emotional Intelligence&quot; (Bantam Books, 1995), which spent more than a year and a half on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. 

Goleman gained widespread recognition for his contributions to the field of emotional intelligence, a notion that includes the abilities of self-awareness, managing one&#x27;s own emotions, empathy, and social skills – essentially, how effectively we manage our emotions and understand the emotions of others. His book &quot;Emotional Intelligence&quot; has been translated into 40 languages globally and was celebrated by TIME magazine as one of the top 25 most pivotal books in the realm of business management.

In his first book, &quot;The Varieties of Meditative Experience&quot; (1977) (republished in 1988 as &quot;The Meditative Mind&quot;), Goleman describes almost a dozen different meditation systems. He wrote that &quot;the need for the meditator to retrain his attention, whether through concentration or mindfulness, is the single invariant ingredient in the recipe for altering consciousness of every meditation system&quot;.

In &quot;Working with Emotional Intelligence&quot; (Bantam Books, 1998), Goleman developed the argument that non-cognitive skills can matter as much as IQ for workplace success, and made a similar argument for leadership effectiveness in &quot;Primal Leadership&quot; (Harvard Business School Press, 2001). Goleman&#x27;s most recent bestseller is &quot;Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence&quot; (Harper, 2013). In Goleman&#x27;s Book &quot;Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence&quot; (Harper, 2013) he discusses the secret to success, and how mindfulness allows us to concentrate on what&#x27;s important. Goleman explains that high achievers of mindfulness have mastered a &quot;triple-focus,&quot; which encompasses three distinct types of attention: &quot;inner,&quot; &quot;other,&quot; and &quot;outer.&quot; &quot;Inner&quot; focus is about self-awareness, &quot;other&quot; focus pertains to empathy, and &quot;outer&quot; focus involves an understanding of our surroundings. Goleman emphasizes that for business leaders, the practice of mindfulness is especially critical. The essence of leadership depends on the successful steering of the collective focus. This requires not only monitoring external developments relative to the organization but also engaging and guiding the focus of individuals both within and beyond the company&#x27;s boundaries.

===Awards===
Goleman has received many awards, including: 
* Career Achievement award for Excellence in the Media (1984) from the American Psychological Association.
* Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in recognition of his efforts to communicate the behavioral sciences to the public
* Washburn Award for Science Journalism in 1997
* Ranked 39th on the 2011 Thinkers50
* Centennial Medal from the Harvard Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 2023

<text>Carlos Teo Rosario Cruz (November 4, 1937 – February 15, 1970) was a boxer from the Dominican Republic. Cruz was world lightweight champion from 1968 to 1969. He is the older brother of former super bantamweight world champion of boxing, Leo Cruz.

==Amateur career==
Cruz claimed he didn&#x27;t put on his first pair of boxing gloves until his 20th birthday. He fought as an amateur from 1957 to 1959, posting a 14–3 record.

==Personal==
Cruz&#x27;s father, Francisco Rosario Almonte was an army officer in the Dominican military. Cruz met his wife, Mildred Ortiz in the town of Río Piedras in Puerto Rico. They were married in 1961 when Ortiz was 24 years old. Cruz had two children.

Cruz&#x27;s younger brother, Leo Cruz, went on to become a world champion.

==Pro career==
He started his career as a professional boxer with a loss, being defeated by decision in eight rounds by Juan José Jiménez, October 23 of 1959 in Santo Domingo. His first win came on December 3 of that year, also in Santo Domingo, with a ten-round decision win over Rafael Acevedo.

After one more win in Santo Domingo, he moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico. There, he posted a record of 7 wins and 2 losses before returning to Santo Domingo in 1962. Out of the 7 wins in Puerto Rico during that era, 5 were by knockout. In his return to Santo Domingo, he posted a decision win over Acevedo in a rematch. Towards the end of 1962, he started campaigning in the United States, particularly in New York. There, he boxed 5 times before returning to San Juan for another bout. He won 4 and drew 1 of those fights, all wins by decision.

He spent the first half of 1964 touring Australia, where he won 2 fights and lost one. He lost on points to Graham Dicker in Brisbane, stopped Guizani Rezgui in Sydney and outpointed Gilberto Biondi in Melbourne. Then he returned to Latin America, his first fight after arriving from Australia being a major step up in quality of opposition for him: In Caracas, he met fellow world champion boxer Carlos Morocho Hernández. He was knocked out in four rounds by Hernandez. On to Panama City, where he lost a ten-round decision to Julio Ruiz. He finished his year by beating Marcos Morales, a boxer of Puerto Rico during this era, at Santo Domingo.

In 1965, he was undefeated. He fought in St. Croix, in Mayagüez, in Caguas and in London among other places. He won all ten of his bouts that year.

He won 8 bouts, lost 1 and drew 1 in 1966. He drew with Jaime Valladares in Quito, and lost to Frankie Narvaez in San Juan. But he also beat former world title challenger Bunny Grant. In 1967, he avenged his loss to Narvaez, and went undefeated the rest of the year, securing his position as the world&#x27;s number one challenger among Lightweights.

He won three more fights to begin 1968, and then, on June 29 in Santo Domingo, he was given his first chance to challenge for a world title. He became world Lightweight champion when he defeated Carlos Ortiz by a decision in fifteen rounds.

He defended the world title with a fifteen-round decision over Mando Ramos in Los Angeles, and then, he closed the year by winning a non-title bout in Tokyo, also by decision, in ten.

There was a rematch between Cruz and Ramos, also held in Los Angeles. The second time around, Ramos became world Lightweight champion by beating Cruz with an eleventh-round knockout. Cruz went on to win his next three bouts of 1969.

On January 17 of 1970, Cruz won his last fight. He beat Benito Juarez in San Juan by a decision in ten, and then returned to Santo Domingo.

==Professional boxing record==

==Death==
On February 15, 1970, Cruz was flying back to San Juan alongside his family for a fight against Roger Zami, when their Dominicana de Aviación DC-9 plane crashed into the waters of the Caribbean shortly after take-off, killing Cruz, his wife and two children, along with all other passengers and crew on board, which included the coach and eleven players of the Puerto Rico women&#x27;s national volleyball team.

<doc id="209982" wikidata="Q2900" url="?curid=209982" title="Quito">
<text>Quito (; ), officially San Francisco de Quito, is the capital and second-largest city of Ecuador, with an estimated population of 2.8 million in its metropolitan area. It is also the capital of the province of Pichincha. Quito is located in a valley on the eastern slopes of Pichincha, an active stratovolcano in the Andes.

Quito&#x27;s elevation of makes it either the highest or the second highest national capital city in the world. This varied standing is because Bolivia is a country with multiple capitals; if La Paz is considered the Bolivian national capital, it tops the list of highest capitals, but if Sucre is specified as the capital, then it is the second highest, behind Quito.

Quito is the political and cultural center of Ecuador as the country&#x27;s major governmental, administrative, and cultural institutions are located within the city. The majority of transnational companies with a presence in Ecuador are headquartered there. It is also one of the country&#x27;s two major industrial centers—the port city of Guayaquil being the other one.

The date of its first habitation is unknown, but archaeological evidence suggests that it was first settled by sedentary populations between 4400 and 1600 BC. In the late fifteenth century, the Inca Emperor Huayna Capac defeated the Quitu, the region&#x27;s original inhabitants, and incorporated Quito into the Inca Empire, designating it into the capital of the Inca Empire&#x27;s northern region. The Spanish conquest of the city in 1534 is the date most frequently cited as the city&#x27;s official founding, making Quito the oldest capital in South America.

Quito&#x27;s historic center is among the largest and best-preserved in the Americas. In 1978, Quito and Kraków were the first World Cultural Heritage Sites declared by UNESCO. Quito is the capital city closest to the Equator, which runs through the northern part of the metropolitan area in the parish of San Antonio.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian period===
The oldest traces of human presence in Quito were excavated by American archeologist Robert E. Bell in 1960, on the slopes of the Ilaló volcano, located between the eastern valleys of Los Chillos and Tumbaco. Hunter-gatherers left tools of obsidian glass, dated to 8000 BC. This archeological site, called &quot;EI Inga,&quot; was brought to Robert Bell&#x27;s attention by Allen Graffham. As a geologist in Ecuador, Graffham pursued his amateur interest in archeology. He made surface collections at the site during 1956. The discovery of projectile points, particularly specimens with basal fluting, stimulated his interest, and he made several visits to the site to collect surface materials. Graffham&#x27;s previous interest in Paleo-Indian remains, and his experience with early human-made materials in Kansas and Nebraska in the Central Plains of the United States, led him to believe that the site was an important discovery.

The second important vestige of human settlement was found in the current neighborhood of Cotocollao (1500 BC), northwest of Quito. The prehistoric village covered over 26 hectares in an area irrigated by many creeks. Near the ancient rectangular houses, there are burials with pottery and stone offerings. The Cotocollao people extracted and exported obsidian to the coastal region.

The priest Juan de Velasco wrote about a Kingdom of Quito. His source was a lost work by Marcos de Niza, the existence of which has not been confirmed. His account said that another people, known as the Cara or the Schyris, came from the coast and took over the entire region by AD 890. He goes on by saying that this kingdom lasted until the Inca took over the territory in the 15th century. However archeological evidence does not indicate unity among the different ethnic groups in the region. The local Quitu or Quillaco tribe is distinct in its art and architecture from its neighbors.

By the 20th century, many prominent historians who began more academic studies, doubted the account of the Quitu-Cara kingdom. They think it was a legendary pre-Hispanic account of the highlands.

These days, most historians deny the existence of the kingdom of Quito in favor of a more fragmented region. The Quitu ruled over Quito at the time of the Inca invasion by Topa Inca Yupanqui under the reign of his father. In the early 21st century, there were spectacular new finds of 20-meter deep tombs in the La Florida neighborhood of Quito. Dating to AD 800, they provide evidence of the high quality of craftsmanship among the Quitu, and of the elaborate and complex character of their funerary rites. In 2010, the Museo de Sitio La Florida opened to preserve some of the artifacts from the tombs and explain this complex culture.

===Colonial period===


Incan uprising against the Spanish continued during 1534. The conquistador Diego de Almagro founded Santiago de Quito (in present-day Colta, near Riobamba) on 15 August 1534, renamed as San Francisco de Quito on 28 August 1534. The city was later refounded at its present location on 6 December 1534 by 204 settlers led by Sebastián de Benalcázar, who captured leader Rumiñahui, effectively ending all organized resistance. Rumiñahui was executed on 10 January 1535.

On 28 March 1541, Quito was declared a city. Further, on 23 February 1556, it was given the title &quot;Muy Noble y Muy Leal Ciudad de San Francisco de Quito&quot; (&quot;Very Noble and Loyal City of San Francisco of Quito&quot;), marking the start of its next phase of urban development. In 1563 Quito became the seat of a &quot;Real Audiencia&quot; (administrative district) of Spain. It was classified as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1717, after which the &quot;Audiencia&quot; was part of the new Viceroyalty of New Granada. Under both Viceroyalties, the district was administered from Quito, (see Real Audiencia de Quito).


The Spanish established Roman Catholicism in Quito. The first church (&quot;El Belén&quot;) was built before the city was officially founded. In January 1535 the San Francisco Convent was constructed, the first of about 20 churches and convents built during the colonial period. The Spanish converted the indigenous population to Christianity and used them as labor for construction.

In 1743, after nearly 210 years of Spanish colonization, Quito was a city of about 10,000 inhabitants. Quito briefly proclaimed its de facto independence from Spain between 1765 and 1766 during the Quito Revolt. On 10 August 1809, a movement was again started in Quito to win independence from Spain. On that date a plan for government was unveiled, which appointed Juan Pío Montúfar as president and prominent pro-independence figures in other government positions. 
This initial movement was defeated on 2 August 1810, when colonial troops arrived from Lima, Peru, and killed the leaders of the uprising and about 200 other settlers. A chain of conflicts climaxed on 24 May 1822, when Antonio José de Sucre, under the command of Simón Bolívar, led troops into the Battle of Pichincha, on the slopes of the volcano. Their victory established the independence of Quito and the surrounding areas.

===Republican Ecuador===
In 1833, members of the Society of Free Inhabitants of Quito were assassinated by the government after they conspired against it. On 6 March 1845, the Marcist Revolution began. In 1875 the country&#x27;s president, Gabriel García Moreno, was assassinated in Quito. Two years later, in 1877, Archbishop José Ignacio Checa y Barba was killed by poison while celebrating Mass in Quito.

In 1882, insurgents rose up against the regime of dictator Ignacio de Veintimilla. However, this did not end the violence that was occurring throughout the country. On 9 July 1883, the liberal commander Eloy Alfaro participated in the Battle of Guayaquil, and after further conflict he became the president of Ecuador on 4 September 1895. Upon completing his second term in 1911, he moved to Europe. He returned to Ecuador in 1912 and attempted to return to power unsuccessfully; he was arrested on 28 January 1912, and imprisoned, then lynched by a mob that stormed the prison. His body was dragged through the streets of Quito to a city park, where it was burned.

In 1932, the Four Days&#x27; War broke out. This was a civil war that followed the election of Neptalí Bonifaz and the subsequent realization that he carried a Peruvian passport. On 12 February 1949, a realistic broadcast of H. G. Wells&#x27; novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; led to citywide panic, and the deaths of more than twenty people who died in fires set by mobs.

===21st century===
In 2011, the city&#x27;s population was 2,239,191 people. Since 2002, the city has been renewing its historic center. The old airport was closed to air traffic on 19 February 2013. The area was redeveloped as &quot;Parque Bicentenario&quot; (Bicententennial Park). The new Mariscal Sucre International Airport, A 45 minutes drive from central Quito, opened to air traffic on 20 February 2013.

During 2003 and 2004, the bus lines of the Metrobus (Ecovia) were constructed, traversing the city from the north to the south. Many avenues and roads were extended and enlarged, depressed passages were constructed, and roads were restructured geometrically to increase the flow of traffic. A new subway system opened with one line on 1 December 2023.

==Geography==

Quito is located in the northern highlands of Ecuador in the Guayllabamba river basin. The city is built on a long plateau lying on the east flanks of the Pichincha volcano. The valley of Guayllabamba River where Quito lies is flanked by volcanoes, some of them snow-capped, and visible from the city on a clear day. Quito is the closest capital city to the equator. Quito&#x27;s altitude is listed at .

===Nearby volcanoes===
Quito&#x27;s closest volcano is Pichincha, looming over the western side of the city. Quito is the only capital city that was developed so close to an active volcano. Pichincha volcano has several summits, among them Ruku Pichincha at above sea level and Guagua Pichincha at .

Pichincha is active and being monitored by volcanologists at the Geophysical institute of the national polytechnic university. The largest eruption occurred in 1660 when more than of ash covered the city. There were three minor eruptions in the 19th century. The latest eruption was recorded on 5 October 1999, when a few puffs of smoke were seen and much ash was deposited on the city.

Activity in other nearby volcanoes can also affect the city. In November 2002 the volcano Reventador erupted and showered the city in fine ash particles, to a depth of several centimeters.

The volcanoes on the Central Cordillera (Royal Cordillera), east of Quito, surrounding the Guayllabamba valley, include Cotopaxi, Sincholagua, Antisana and Cayambe. Some of the volcanoes of the Western Cordillera, to the west of the Guayllabamba valley, include Illiniza, Atacazo, and Pululahua (which is the site of the Pululahua Geobotanical Reserve).

===Climate===
The southern part of Quito has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;), while the northern part has a warm-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csb&quot;). Because of its altitude and location on the equator, Quito has a fairly constant cool but comfortable climate. The average afternoon maximum temperature is , and the average night-time minimum temperature is . The annual average temperature is . The city has only two seasons: dry and wet. The dry season, June through August (3 months), is referred to as summer; the wet season, September through May (9 months), is referred to as winter. Annual precipitation, depending on location, is over .

Due to its altitude, Quito receives some of the greatest solar radiation in the world, sometimes reaching a UV Index of 24 by solar noon under clear skies.

The fact that Quito lies almost on the equator means that high pressure systems are extremely rare. Pressure is stable, so very low pressure systems are also rare. From 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011 the lowest pressure recorded was , and the highest was . Despite the absence of high pressure, Quito can still experience settled weather. Generally, the highest pressure is around midnight and the lowest in the mid-afternoon.

==Topographical zones==

Quito is divided into three areas, separated by hills:
#Central: houses the colonial old city.
#Southern: is mainly an industrial and working-class residential area.
#Northern: is the modern Quito, with high-rise buildings, shopping centers, the financial district, and a mix of upper-class, middle-class, and working-class residential areas.

==Economy==

Quito is the largest city in contribution to national GDP, and the highest in per capita income. Quito has the highest level of tax collection in Ecuador, exceeding the national 57% per year 2009, currently being the most important economic region of the country, as the latest &quot;study&quot; conducted by the Central Bank of Ecuador.

The top major industries in Quito includes textiles, metals and agriculture, with major crops for export being coffee, sugar, cacao, rice, bananas and palm oil.

Petroecuador, the largest company in the country and one of the largest in Latin America is headquartered in Quito.

Headquarters and regional offices of many national and international financial institutions, oil corporations and international businesses are also located in Quito, making it a world class business city.

In &quot;The World according to GaWC&quot; global cities report, which measures a city&#x27;s integration into the world city network, Quito is ranked as a Beta city: an important metropolis instrumental in linking its region or state into the world economy. 

==Politics==
===Governance===
Quito is governed by a mayor and a 15-member city council. The mayor is elected to a five-year term and can be re-elected. The position also doubles as Mayor of the Metropolitan District of Quito (the canton). The current mayor is Pabel Muñoz Lopez.

===Urban parishes===
In Ecuador, cantons are subdivided into &quot;parishes&quot;, so called because they were originally used by the Catholic Church, but with the secularization and liberalization of the Ecuadorian state, the political parishes were spun off the ones used by the church. Parishes are called &quot;urban&quot; if they are within the boundaries of the seat (capital) of their corresponding canton, and &quot;rural&quot; if outside those boundaries. Inside Quito (the city proper), subdivision into urban parishes depends on the organizations that use these parishes (e.g., the municipality, the electoral tribunals, the postal service, the Ecuadorian statistics institute). The urban parishes of different types are not necessarily coterminous nor the same in number or name.

, the municipality of Quito divided the city into 32 urban parishes. These parishes, which are used by the municipality for administrative purposes, are also known as &quot;cabildos&quot; since 2001. Since the times of the Metropolitan District of Quito, parishes of this type are also grouped into larger divisions known as &quot;municipal zones&quot; (&quot;zonas municipales&quot;). These parishes are as follows:

# Belisario Quevedo
# Carcelén
# Centro Histórico
# Chilibulo
# Chillogallo
# Chimbacalle
# Cochapamba
# Comité del Pueblo
# Concepción
# Cotocollao
# El Condado
# El Inca
# Guamaní
# Iñaquito
# Itchimbía
# Jipijapa
# Kennedy
# La Argelia
# La Ecuatoriana
# La Ferroviaria
# La Libertad
# La Mena
# Magdalena
# Mariscal Sucre
# Ponceano
# Puengasí
# Quitumbe
# Rumipamba
# San Bartolo
# San Juan
# Solanda
# Turubamba
===Ecclesiastical parishes===
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quito divides the city into 167 parishes, which are grouped into 17 zones.
==Transport==
===Public transport===
The MetrobusQ network, also known as &quot;Red Integrada de Transporte Público&quot;, is the bus rapid transit system running in Quito, and it goes through the city from south to north. It&#x27;s divided into three sections—the green line (the central trolleybus, known as &quot;El Trole&quot;), the red line (the north-east Ecovía), and the blue line (the north-west Central Corridor). In addition to the bus rapid transit system, there are many bus companies running in the city. The buses have both a name and a number, and they have a fixed route. Taxi cabs are all yellow, and they have meters that show the fare. There are nearly 8,800 registered taxicabs.

In August 2012, the Municipality of Quito government established a municipal bicycle sharing system called Bici Q. 
In March 2023, a new bicycle sharing system was established in order to promote the bicycle as a sustainable, healthy and fast mean of transport. With this service, the objective is to reduce mobilization times, air pollution and improve the quality of life of the citizens.

===Highways===
Although public transport is the primary form of travel in the city, including fleets of taxis that continually cruise the roadways, the use of private vehicles has increased substantially during the past decade.
Because of growing road congestion in many areas, there were plans to construct a light rail system, which were conceived to replace the northern portion of the &quot;Trole&quot;. These plans have been ruled out and replaced by the construction of the first metro line (subway) in 2012. It started to operate in December 2023, joining the existing public transportation network.

===Roads, avenues and streets===
Because Quito is about long and at its widest, most of the important avenues of the city extend from north to south. The two main motorways that go from the northern part of the city to the southern are Avenue Oriental (Corridor Periférico Oriental) on the eastern hills that border the city, and Avenue Occidental on the western side of the city on the Pichincha volcano. The street 10 de Agosto also runs north to south through most of the city, running down the middle of it. The historic center of the city is based on a grid pattern, despite the hills, with the streets Venezuela, Chile, García Moreno, and Guayaquil being the most important.

===Aviation===

The Mariscal Sucre International Airport serves as the city&#x27;s principal airport for passenger travel and freight. The airport is located east of the city&#x27;s center in the Tababela parish. It began operations on 20 February 2013, replacing the Old Mariscal Sucre International Airport located north of the city center within city limits. The old airport was replaced due to tall buildings and nighttime fog that made landing from the south difficult. The old airport was converted into a metropolitan park.

===Railways===
There is a railroad that goes through the southern part of Quito and passes through the &quot;Estación de Chimbacalle&quot;. It is managed by the Empresa de Ferrocarriles Ecuatorianos (EFE). This form of transportation is nowadays used mostly for tourism.

===Metro===
A metro subway system (Quito Metro) began construction in 2013 with Phase One, which entailed the construction of stations at La Magdalena and El Labrador. Phase Two, which began in 2016, involves 15 stations, a depot, and sub-systems. The project is expected to carry 400,000 passengers per day and cost $1.5 billion with financing coming from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF). The line opened on 1 December 2023.

==Points of interest==
===Historic center===

Quito has the largest, least-altered, and best-preserved historic center in the Americas. This center was, together with the historic center of Kraków, Poland, the first to be declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO on 18 September 1978. The historic center of Quito is to the south of the capital&#x27;s current center, on an area of , and one of the most important historic areas in Latin America. There are about 130 monumental buildings (which host a variety of pictorial art and sculpture, mostly religiously inspired, in a multi-faceted range of schools and styles), and 5,000 properties registered in the municipal inventory of heritage properties.

;Palacio de Carondelet
Palacio de Carondelet () is the seat of the Government of the Republic of Ecuador, located in the historic center of Quito. The palace overlooks the bustling public space known as Independence Square or Plaza Grande (colonial name), together with the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace, the Municipal Palace, the Hotel Plaza Grande and the Metropolitan Cathedral. During the Republican era almost all the presidents (constitutional, internees and dictators) have governed from the Carondelet Palace. The presidential residence is located on the third level of the Palace, along with administrative offices.

;Basílica del Voto Nacional
The monumental Basilica del Voto Nacional is the most important neo-Gothic building in Ecuador, and one of the most representative of the American continent. It was once the largest in the New World.

;Quito Metropolitan Cathedral
The Quito Metropolitan Cathedral, is one of the largest religious symbols of spiritual value for the Catholic community in the city. Construction of this church began in 1535, seventeen years after the Diocese of Quito was created in 1545. The church building was completed in 1799, during the administration of President of the Real Audiencia, Baron Héctor de Carondelet.

One of the major events that took place in this cathedral was the murder of the Bishop of Quito, José Ignacio Checa y Barba, who during the mass of Good Friday on 30 March 1877, was poisoned by strychnine dissolved in the consecrated wine. The cathedral is also the burial place of the remains of the Grand Marshal Antonio José de Sucre and also of several presidents of the Republic, as well as of bishops and priests who died in the diocese. The cathedral is on the south side of the Plaza de La Independencia.

;Church of La Compañía de Jesús
Construction of The Church of La Compañía began in 1605. Building took 160 years. In 1765 the work was completed with the construction of the façade. This was done by Native Americans who carefully shaped the stones to build the façade in the ornate Baroque style, in what is one of the finest examples of this art in the Americas.

;Basilica of San Francisco
The Basilica of San Francisco is the largest of the existing architectural ensembles in the historic centers of cities in Latin America. The construction of the church began in 1550, on land adjacent to the plaza where the Native Americans engaged in the barter of products.

;Church of El Sagrario
In colonial times, the Church of El Sagrario was one of the largest architectural marvels of Quito. The construction is of the Italian Renaissance style and it was built in the late 17th century. It has a screen that supports its sculptures and decorations. This structure was built by Bernardo de Legarda. Its central arch leads to a dome decorated with frescoes of biblical scenes featuring archangels. It was done by Francisco Albán. The altarpiece was gilded by Legarda. It is located on Calle García Moreno, near the cathedral.

;Church of Santo Domingo

Church of Santo Domingo. Although they arrived in Quito in 1541, the Dominicans started to build their own temple in 1580, using the plans of Francisco Becerra, and under his direction. The work was completed in the first half of the 17th century. Inside the church are valuable structures, such as the neo-Gothic main altar. This was installed in the late 19th century by Italian Dominicans. The roof of the Mudéjar style church features paintings of martyrs of the Order of Saint Dominic. The roof of the nave is supported by a pair-and-knuckle frame, decorated inside by tracery. In the museum on the north side of the lower cloister, there are wonderful pieces by great Quito sculptors such as the Saint Dominic de Guzmán by Father Carlos, the Saint John of God by Caspicara, and the Saint Thomas Aquinas by Legarda. Another Baroque masterpiece that still stands today, is the Chapel of Nuestra Señora del Rosario, a recognizable architectural icon of Quito. This chapel was built next to the church. The largest fraternity in the city of Quito was founded in this chapel.
===El Panecillo===

El Panecillo is a hill in the middle west of the city at an altitude of about above sea level. A monument to the Virgin Mary is located on top of El Panecillo and is visible from most of the city of Quito. In 1976, the Spanish artist Agustín de la Herrán Matorras was commissioned by the religious order of the Oblates to build a –tall aluminum monument of a madonna, which was assembled on a high pedestal on the top of Panecillo. The statue of the Virgin on the Panecillo is a replica of a sculpture made by Bernardo de Legarda in 1732. So this monument is also called Virgen de Legarda or Virgen del Panecillo.

===La Mariscal===
This modern area is considered to be the city&#x27;s entertainment hub. It is a meeting point for both local residents and tourists. Its cosmopolitan atmosphere is expressed in a wide variety of culinary, artistic, and cultural options, and the large number of hotels, inns, travel agencies, shops, bars, and discothèques that light up when the sun sets. &quot;El Gran Desfile de Mariscal&quot; (the Great Parade of Mariscal) is held in this area during the &quot;Fiestas de Quito&quot;.

===Plaza Foch (La Zona)===

This area is considered to be the &quot;zona rosa&quot; of the city. It hosts various night clubs and bars, and has a great night vibe, complete with street vendors selling gum, cigarettes and other small items. Plaza Foch is heavily frequented from Thursday to Saturday, and draws tourists from all over the world. For this reason, prices for liquor, beer and food are expensive compared to other places in Quito. Due to its small driveways and big sidewalks, it&#x27;s mostly a pedestrian area.

===Parks===
====Metropolitano====
Parque Metropolitano Guanguiltagua is the largest urban park in South America at (as reference, New York&#x27;s Central Park is ). The park is located in northern Quito, on the hill of Bellavista behind Estadio Olímpico Atahualpa. The park is suited for mountain biking, walking, and running. Most of it is eucalyptus forest with trails, but there also are numerous sculptures on display. The park has four sites that can be used for picnics or barbecues, and the eastern section has a view of Cotopaxi, Antisana, and the Guayllabamba river basin.

====Bicentenario====

It was inaugurated on 27 April 2013. This park has , and it is located at , above mean sea level. The former runway has been converted into recreational space with lanes painted for bicycles and pedestrians. There are play structures and games for children. As well, there is outdoor exercise equipment for adults. The park contains a man-made pond and more than one thousand trees, many newly planted. The park also hosts cultural exhibits and outdoor concerts.

====La Carolina====

La Carolina is a 165.5-acre (670,000 m2) park in the center of the Quito main business area, bordered by the avenues Río Amazonas, de los Shyris, Naciones Unidas, Eloy Alfaro, and de la República. This park started from the expropriation of the farm La Carolina in 1939. The design of the park was made by the Dirección Metropolitana de Planificación Territorial (DMPT). Pope John Paul II headed a great mass in the park during his visit to Ecuador in 1985. A giant cross has been built in this place.

====El Ejido====
El Ejido is the fourth-largest park of Quito (after Metropolitan, Bicentenario and La Carolina), and it divides the old part of the city from the modern one. This park is known for handicrafts available for sale every Saturday and Sunday, with all pricing subject to negotiation (that is, haggling). Local painters sell copies of paintings by Oswaldo Guayasamín, Eduardo Kingman, and Gonzalo Endara Crow. Otavaleños sell traditional sweaters, ponchos, carpets, and jewelry.

====Guápulo====
Set on the side on a cliff with González Suárez Street, one of the most famous in Quito and to the other side the valley and further in the distance, the Amazon Jungle. Guápulo is a district of Quito, Ecuador, also called an electoral parish (&quot;parroquia electoral urbana&quot;). The parish was established as a result of the October 2004 political elections when the city was divided into 19 urban electoral parishes. Set behind Hotel Quito, the neighborhood of Guápulo runs down the winding Camino de Orellana, from González Suárez to Calle de los Conquistadores, the main road out of Quito and to the neighboring suburbs. Often considered an artsy, bohemian neighborhood of Quito, Guápulo is home to many local artists and a couple of hippy cafés/bars. Every year on 7 September the guapuleños honor their neighborhood with the Fiestas de Guápulo, a fantastic celebration complete with costumes, parade, food, drink, song, dance, and fireworks.

====La Alameda====
The long triangular La Alameda is located at the beginning of street Guayaquil, where the historic center begins. It has an impressive monument of Simón Bolívar at the apex. There are several other interesting monuments in this park. In the center of the park is the Quito Observatory, which was opened by President García Moreno in 1873. It is used for both meteorology and astronomy. At the north end of the park are two ornamental lakes, where rowboats can be rented.

====La Floresta====
One of the most iconic neighborhoods in the city, with an important cultural and gastronomic offer. The neighborhood has local and international restaurants, a cinema, small theaters, cafes, bars, museums and coworking spaces.
===TeleferiQo===
The Aerial tramway Station at Cruz Loma (part of the Pichincha mountain complex at about ). Since July 2005, Quito has had an aerial tramway, known as the &quot;Telefériqo&quot;, from the city center to the hill known as Cruz Loma on the east side of the Pichincha volcano. The ride takes visitors to an elevation of about . There are also trails for hiking and areas where pictures can be taken of Quito. Because of the increased elevation and the wind on the mountain, it is considerably cooler.

Besides the aerial tramway to Cruz Loma, the Telefériqo as a whole is a visitor center that includes an amusement park (Vulqano Park), fine-dining restaurants, Go Karts, Paint Ball, shopping malls, an extensive food court, and other attractions.

===Outside the city===

La Mitad del Mundo (the middle of the world) is a small village administered by the prefecture of the province of Pichincha, north of Quito. It has since been determined, with the use of Global Positioning System technology, that the actual equator is some north of the monument area. Nearby is the Intiñan Solar Museum, which may be closer to the true equator. The Intiñan Solar Museum provides a demonstration which purports to show the Coriolis force causing a clockwise rotation of sink water a few meters south of the equator and a counterclockwise rotation a few meters north, but many scientific sources claim that this is implausible.

Pululahua Geobotanical Reserve, located a few miles northwest from La Mitad del Mundo, contains the Pululahua volcano, whose caldera (crater) is visible from a spot easily accessible by car. It is believed to be one of only a few in the world with human inhabitants.

Quito Zoo,
located near the rural parish of Guayllabamba, about outside Quito, has the biggest collection of native fauna in Ecuador, including several kinds of animals that are sometimes targeted in Ecuador in the illegal fur trade. The Zoo works in conservation and education in Ecuador and has successfully bred the endangered Andean condor.

Maquipucuna Reserve is located in Quito&#x27;s rural parish of Nanegal. This 14,000 acre high biodiversity rainforest and cloud forest reserve protects over 1966 species of plants (10% of Ecuador&#x27;s plant diversity) and close to 400 bird species. This reserve, which is surrounded by a 34,000 acre protected forest, was declared an IBA (Important Bird Area) in 2005 and is the core of the conservation corridor for the spectacled bear (Andean bear) declared in 2013. The area has an ecolodge located in the northern end of the Reserve where the spectacled bear can be sighted for about two months every year.

Some of the other nearby natural attractions are:
* Maquipucuna Reserve Conservation, community projects, bird watching, spectacled bear watching
* Bellavista Cloud Forest Reserve conservation and bird watching lodge
* Cayambe – Coca Ecological Reserve
** Papallacta &amp; Oyacachi thermal springs
* Cotopaxi National Park
* Mindo Nambillo cloud forest
* Illiniza volcano
* Pasochoa Wildlife Refuge
* Pichincha volcano with its peaks Wawa Pichincha and Ruku Pichincha

<text>Fideuà (dialectal pronunciation of the Valencian word &quot;fideuada&quot; &quot;large amount of noodles&quot; from Hisp. Ar. &quot;fidáwš&quot;) is a seafood dish originally from the coast of Valencia that is similar to paella, and even more so to arròs a banda, but with pasta noodles instead of rice. Its main ingredients are pasta noodles (often hollow), fish (rockfish, monkfish, cuttlefish, squid), and shellfish (&quot;Squilla mantis&quot;, shrimp, crayfish). It is seasoned mainly with lemon.

== History ==
The invention of fideuà is attributed to a picturesque story. Gabriel Rodríguez Pastor, (&quot;Gabrielo&quot; from a kiosk in the port district of Grau in Gandía), worked as a cook on a boat and Juan Bautista Pascual (&quot;Zábalo&quot;), was the youngest man on the boat and his assistant. According to Gabriel&#x27;s family, the boat captain loved rice and the rest of sailors almost never received their full portion of arròs a banda, the dish that the cook usually prepared. Trying to find a solution for the problem, the cook had the idea of using noodles instead of rice to see if the result was a little less appetizing for the captain.

The invention was liked, and fame of the dish spread to harbor restaurants such as the &quot;Pastaora House&quot;, where they cooked the first &quot;fideuades&quot;. The dish became distinctive and essential in the area.

== Characteristics ==
Just like paella, it is cooked in a special wide and flat frying pan, called &quot;paella&quot; (the word for &quot;frying pan&quot; in Catalan language), although there are other traditional variants made in a casserole.

The pasta is sautéed in stock, rather than boiled. 

Gandia is the birthplace of fideuà, and in this city of La Safor region, there is an annual competition where the best cooks try to prepare the best fideuà.

<text>North Asia or Northern Asia is the northern region of Asia, which is defined in geographical terms and consists of three federal districts of Russia: Ural, Siberian, and the Far Eastern. The region forms the bulk of the Asian part of Russia. North Asia is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to its north; by Eastern Europe to its west; by Central Asia and East Asia to its south; and by the Pacific Ocean and Northern America to its east. It covers an area of , or 8.8% of Earth&#x27;s total land area; and is the largest subregion of Asia by area, occupying approx. 29.4% of Asia&#x27;s land area, but is also the least populated, with a population of around 37 million, accounting for merely 0.74% of Asia&#x27;s population.

Topographically, the region is dominated by the Eurasian Plate, except for its eastern part, which lies on the North American, Amurian, and Okhotsk Plates. It is divided by three major plains: the West Siberian Plain, Central Siberian Plateau, and Verhoyansk-Chukotka collision zone. The Uralian orogeny in the west raised Ural Mountains, the informal boundary between Asia and Europe. Tectonic and volcanic activities are frequently occurred in the eastern part of the region as part of the Ring of Fire, evidenced by the formation of island arcs such as the Kuril Islands and ultra-prominent peaks such as Klyuchevskaya Sopka, Kronotsky, and Koryaksky. The central part of North Asia is a large igneous province called the Siberian Traps, formed by a massive eruption which occurred 250 million years ago. The formation of the traps coincided with the Permian–Triassic extinction event.

Geographically, North Asia is a subregion of Asia. Historically, it has been home to various East Asian-related ethnic groups from a diverse range of language families, including the Ainu, Chukotko-Kamchatkan, Mongolic, Nivkh, Tungusic, Turkic, Uralic, Yeniseian, Yukaghir, and Eskaleut peoples. However, due to the Russian conquest of Siberia, the entirety of North Asia was colonised and incorporated into Russia. Consequently, some international organisations classify North Asia as part of Eastern Europe along with European Russia, rather than as a part of Asia. European cultural influences, specifically Russian, are predominant in the entire region, due to it experiencing Russian emigration from Europe starting from the 16th century. Slavs and other Indo-Europeans make up the vast majority of North Asia&#x27;s population, and over 85% of the region&#x27;s population is of European descent. Whereas the indigenous peoples comprise only about 5% of the North Asian population.

==History==

The region was first populated by hominins in the Late Pleistocene, approximately 100,000 years ago, and modern humans are confirmed to arrived in the region by 45,000 years ago with the first humans in the region having West Eurasian origins.

Its Neolithic culture is characterized by characteristic stone production techniques and the presence of pottery of eastern origin. The Bronze Age began during the 3rd millennium BCE, with influences of Indo-Iranian cultures as evidenced by the Andronovo culture. During the 1st millennium BCE, polities such as the Scythians and Xiongnus emerged in the region, who often clashed with its Persian and Chinese neighbors in the south.

The Göktürks dominated southern Siberia during the 1st millennium CE, while in the early 2nd millennium, the Mongol Empire and its successor states ruled the region. The Khanate of Sibir was one of the last independent Turkic states in North Asia before its conquest by the Tsardom of Russia in the 16th century. Russia would then gradually annex the region into its territory until the Convention of Peking was signed in 1860.

After the October Revolution in 1917, the region was contested between the Bolsheviks and Whites until the Soviet Union asserted full control in 1923. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left Russia as the administrator of the region.

==Geography==

For geographical and statistical reasons, the United Nations geoscheme and various other classification schemes will not subdivide countries, and thus place all of Russia in Europe or the Eastern Europe subregion. There are no mountain chains in North Asia to prevent air currents from the Arctic flowing down over the plains of Siberia and Turkestan.

The plateau and plains of North Asia comprise the West Siberian Lowlands; the Angara Shield, with the Taymyr Peninsula, the coastal lowlands (the East Siberian Lowland and the North Siberian Lowland), and the Central Siberian Plateau (the Anabar Plateau, the Lena Plateau, the Lena-Angara Plateau, the Putorana Plateau, the Tunguska Plateau, and the Vilyuy Plateau); and the Central Yakutian Lowland. Western Siberia is usually regarded as the Northwest Asia, Kazakhstan also sometimes included there. However, Northwest Asia sometimes refers to the South Caucasus or its nearby areas.

===Geomorphology===
The geomorphology of Northern Asia in general is imperfectly known, although the deposits and mountain ranges are well known.

To compensate for new sea floor having been created in the Siberian basin, the whole of the Eurasian Plate has pivoted about a point in the New Siberian Islands, causing compression in the Verkhoyansk mountains, which were formed along the eastern margin of the Angara Shield by tectonic uplift during the Mesozoic Era. There is a southern boundary to this across the northern margin of the Alpine folds of Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and Bhutan, which at the east of Brahmaputra turns to run south towards the Bay of Bengal along the line of the Naga Hills and the Arakan Yoma, continues around Indonesia, and follows the edge of the continental shelf along the eastern seaboard of China. The Eurasian Plate and the North American Plate meet across the neck of Alaska, following the line of the Aleutian Trench, rather than meeting at the Bering Straits.

Northern Asia is built around the Angara Shield, which lies between the Yenisey River and the Lena River. It developed from fragments of Laurasia, whose rocks were mainly Precambrian crystalline rocks, gneisses, and schists, and Gondwana. These rocks can be found in the Angara Shield, Inner Mongolian-Korean Shield, Ordes Shield, and Southeast Asia Shield. The fragments have been subject to orogenesis around their margins, giving a complex of plateaux and mountain ranges. One can find outcrops of these rocks in unfolded sections of the Shields. Their presence has been confirmed below Mesozoic and later sediments.

There are three main periods of mountain building in Northern Asia, although it has occurred many times. The outer fold mountains that are on the margins of the Shields and that only affected Asia north of the line of the Himalayas, are attributed to the Caledonian and Hercynian orogenies of the late Palaeozoic Era. The Alpine orogeny caused extensive folding and faulting of Mesozoic and early Tertiary sediments from the Tethys geosyncline. The Tibetan and Mongolian plateaux, and the structural basins of Tarim, Qaidam, and Junggar, are delimited by major east–west lithospheric faults that were probably the results of stresses caused by the impact of the Indian Plate against Laurasia. Erosion of the mountains caused by this orogeny has created a large amount of sediment, which has been transported southwards to produce the alluvial plains of India, China, and Cambodia, and which has also been deposited in large amounts in the Tarim and Dzungarian basins.
Northern Asia was glaciated in the Pleistocene, but this played a less significant part in the geology of the area compared to the part that it played in North America and Europe. The Scandinavian ice sheet extended to the east of the Urals, covering the northern two thirds of the Ob Basin and extending onto the Angara Shield between the Yenisei River and the Lena River. There are legacies of mountain glaciation to be found on the east Siberian mountains, on the mountains of the Kamchatka Peninsula, on the Altai, on Tian Shan, and on other small areas of mountains, ice caps remain on the islands of Severnaya Zemlya and Novaya Zemlya, and several Central Asian mountains still have individual glaciers. North Asia itself has permafrost, ranging in depths from 30 to 600 metres and covering an area of 9.6 million km2.

Several of the mountainous regions are volcanic, with both the Koryak Mountains and the Kamchatka Peninsula having active volcanoes. The Anadyr Plateau is formed from igneous rocks. The Mongolian Plateau has an area of basaltic lavas and volcanic cones.

The Angara Shield also underlies the lowlands of the Ob River, but to the south and east in the Central Asian mountains and in the East Siberian Mountains there are folded and faulted mountains of Lower Palaeozoic rocks.

==Demographics==

Most estimates are that there are around 33 million Russian citizens living east of the Ural Mountains, a widely recognized but informal geographical divide between Europe and Asia. Of these Russian citizens of Siberia, most are Slavic-origin Russians and Russified Ukrainians. The Turkic peoples who are native to some parts of Siberia and native Tungusic and Mongolic peoples are now a minority in North Asia due to the Russification process during the last three centuries. Russian census records indicate they make up only an estimated 10% of the region&#x27;s population, with the largest being the Buryats numbering at 445,175, and the Yakuts at 443,852. According to the 2002 census, there are 500,000 Tatars in Siberia, but 300,000 of them are Volga Tatars who settled in Siberia during periods of colonization. Other ethnic groups that live in the region and make a significant portion include ethnic Germans numbering about 400,000.

In 1875, Chambers reported the population of North Asia to be 8 million. Between 1801 and 1914, an estimated 7 million settlers moved from European Russia to Siberia, 85% during the quarter-century before World War I.

<doc id="209990" wikidata="Q903425" url="?curid=209990" title="Trio sonata">
<text>The trio sonata is a genre, typically consisting of several movements, with two melody instruments and basso continuo. It originated in the early 17th century and was a favorite chamber ensemble combination in the Baroque era.

==Basic structure==
The trio sonata typically was written for two melody instruments (such as two violins) and basso continuo. However, either or both of the melody parts could be played on the flute, recorder, oboe, or even viola da gamba. The bass part, the continuo, typically involves two players. One player plays the bass line on a bass instrument such as a bass viol, violone, violoncello, or bassoon. The second player fills in harmonies above the bass line, using an instrument that can produce chords, such as a small organ, a harpsichord, or a theorbo. These chords are normally indicated to the player by placing numbers above the bass part rather than writing out the chords in full, a style of notation called figured bass.

Because there normally are two people playing the continuo part, there are usually four players in all. This accounts for the title of Henry Purcell&#x27;s second collection, &quot;Ten Sonatas in Four Parts&quot; (1697); his first publication &quot;Sonnata&#x27;s of III Parts&quot; (1683) likewise included separate parts for cello and keyboard. From about the middle of the 17th century two distinct types of sonatas appeared: sonata da camera (chamber sonata) and sonata da chiesa (church sonata). The sonata da camera was a suite of dances, while the sonata da chiesa had a typical four-movement structure of slow-fast-slow-fast.

==Composers, compositions and variant formats==
The genre originated as instrumental adaptation of the three-part texture common in Italian vocal music in the late 16th century. The earliest published trio sonatas appeared in Venice (Salamone Rossi &quot;Il primo libro delle sinfonie e gagliarde&quot;, 1607) and in Milan (Giovanni Paolo Cima, Sonata a tre for violin, cornett and continuo in the collection &quot;Concerti ecclesiastici&quot;, 1610).

===Arcangelo Corelli===
Italian composer Arcangelo Corelli was one of the most influential composers of the trio sonata. The published trio sonatas by Corelli are:

*Twelve Church Trio-Sonatas, Op. 1 (dedicated to Queen Christina of Sweden), published in Rome in 1681
*Twelve Chamber Trio-Sonatas, Op. 2 (dedicated to Cardinal Pamphili), published in Rome in 1685
*Twelve Church Trio-Sonatas, Op. 3 (dedicated to Francesco II d&#x27;Este, Duke of Modena), published in Rome in 1689
*Twelve Chamber Trio-Sonatas, Op. 4 (dedicated to Cardinal Ottoboni), published in Rome in 1694.

An additional collection of Trio Sonatas, for two violins, cello, and organ, was published as &quot;Op. post.&quot; in Amsterdam, in 1714. Corelli&#x27;s trios would serve as models for other composers well into the 18th century.

===Johann Sebastian Bach===
German composer Johann Sebastian Bach is another notable composer of the trio sonata, but he was known for shying away from the traditional structure of the sonata. He typically played the three parts with fewer than three instruments. One part could be played by a violin and the other two parts could be played by a keyboard, or all three parts could be played on the organ.

Trio sonatas by Bach include:

* Trio Sonatas for organ, BWV 525–530, combining all three parts on one instrument: typically the right hand, left hand and pedals will each take a different part thus creating the same texture as in a trio.
* A further innovation by Bach was the trio sonata involving a concertante (obbligato) right-hand harpsichord part in addition to the bass line, plus one melodic instrument, thus for two players. Examples are the Six Sonatas for Violin and Harpsichord, BWV 1014–1019, three sonatas for viola da gamba and harpsichord, BWV 1027–1029, and two sonatas for flute and harpsichord, BWV 1030 and 1032; BWV 1020, BWV 1031 and BWV 1033 are doubtful.
* Trio Sonatas BWV 1036–1040: BWV 1039 is a variant version of BWV 1027. The attribution of BWV 1036-1038 to Bach is doubtful, but all are typical of baroque chamber music.
* The mid-18th-century manuscript D-B Mus. ms. Bach &quot;St 345&quot; contains a Concerto (or: Trio Sonata) in C major for violin, cello and continuo, arranged from (or: earlier version of) BWV 525/1, 1032/2 and 525/3 respectively. The 1998 edition of the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis lists this version as BWV 525a, and considers the attribution of the arrangement to Bach doubtful. Based on the New Bach Edition, the Bach Digital website gives &quot;BWV deest&quot; instead of the BWV number 525a for this chamber music version.

===Other composers===
* Tomaso Albinoni, 12 sonatas da chiesa Op. 1, twelve balletti a tre Op. 3, six sonatas da camera as part of Op. 8, six unpublished trio sonatas Op. 11, and a further six trio sonatas without opus number in a manuscript in Vienna, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Musiksammlung.
* Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach wrote at least 44 trio sonatas, including one for flute, viola, and piano, said to have been given its world premiere by the Society for Forgotten Music at the New York Public Library on 30 January 1949. His best-known work in the genre is the programmatic Trio (&quot;Sanguineus und Melancholicus&quot;), in C minor, composed in 1749 and published in Nuremberg in 1751, which exists in two versions: one for obbligato keyboard and violin, the other for two violins and continuo. Trio Sonatas and .
* William Boyce, 12 Trio Sonatas for two violins and continuo (1747).
* Dieterich Buxtehude, Op. 1, six sonatas, and Op. 2, seven sonatas, scored for violin, viola da gamba and basso continuo. These were the only works by Buxtehude that were published during his lifetime. Though real trio texture does occur from time to time, these are really &quot;sonate a due&quot; for violin and viola da gamba, with the continuo often being a simplification of the gamba part. There are however four genuine trio sonatas by Buxtehude surviving in manuscript, two for two violins, viola da gamba and continuo in C and G major (BuxWV 266 and 271), one for two violins and continuo in F major (BuxWV 270, fragmentary), and one for viola da gamba, viola, and continuo in D major (BuxWV 267).
* François Couperin published a number of trio sonatas: &quot;Le Parnasse, ou L’apothéose de Corelli, grande sonade en trio&quot;, for two violins and continuo (Paris, 1724); &quot;Concert instrumental sous le titre d’Apothéose composé à la mémoire immortelle de l’incomparable Monsieur de Lully&quot;, for two violins (two flutes, or other unspecified instruments), and continuo (Paris, 1725); and the collection &quot;Les nations: sonades et suites de simphonies en trio&quot;, for two violins and continuo (Paris, 1726), consisting of &quot;La Françoise&quot; [La pucelle], &quot;L’Espagnole&quot; [La visionnaire], &quot;L’impériale&quot;, and &quot;La Piemontoise&quot; [L’astrée]. In addition, two trio sonatas have survived in manuscript: &quot;La Steinquerque&quot; and &quot;La superbe&quot;, both for two violins and continuo.

* George Frideric Handel, trio sonatas Op. 2 and 5, all in &quot;sonata da chiesa form&quot;. The attribution to Handel of the six trios HWV 380-385 for two oboes and continuo is doubtful, and the authenticity of the three trios HWV 393-395 is uncertain.

* Pietro Antonio Locatelli, six Trio Sonatas, Op. 5, for two violins or two traversos and continuo (1736).
* Johann Pachelbel, &quot;Musikalische Ergötzung&quot; (&quot;Musical Delight&quot;), containing six suites for two violins and basso continuo, each commencing with a sonata, followed by a succession of dances. The violin parts use scordatura tuning. The sonatas are of two types. Nos. 1 and 3 are marked Allegro, and are fughettas. The remaining four are Adagio movements and are similar to French overtures, in two sections.
* Henry Purcell, Sonnata&#x27;s of III Parts, 1683, ten sonatas in four parts, 1697, but both sets are scored for two violins, bass viol, and organ or harpsichord. In terms of style, Purcell&#x27;s trio sonatas are conservative, modeled on the older generation of Italians (Giovanni Legrenzi, Lelio Colista, and Giovanni Battista Vitali) rather than Corelli or Giovanni Battista Bassani.

* Antonio Vivaldi, 12 trio sonatas da camera Op. 1, two trio sonatas mixed with solo sonatas in Op. 5, and thirteen unpublished trios. One further trio sonata, RV 80, in G major, for two flutes and continuo, is attributed to Vivaldi but is probably spurious.

<text>Telescreens are two-way video devices that appear in George Orwell&#x27;s dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. Omnipresent and almost never turned off, they are an unavoidable source of propaganda and tools of surveillance.

The concept of the telescreen has been explored as a metaphor or allegory for the erosion of privacy in totalitarian regimes, as well as in the modern era in the context of Internet- and cellular-based devices that allow for the surreptitious collection of individuals&#x27; audiovisual data, frequently without their explicit consent or awareness.

== Telescreen function ==

All members of the Inner Party (upper-class) and Outer Party (middle-class) have telescreens in their homes, but the proles (lower-class) are not typically monitored as they are unimportant to the Party. As later explained in Emmanuel Goldstein&#x27;s book of which Winston Smith reads some excerpts, the Party does not feel threatened by the Proles, assuming that they would never rebel on their own, and therefore does not find a need to monitor their daily lives. Telescreens are also located throughout the workplaces of Party members, and more are positioned in busy public areas of London. It is unclear whether they can be used anywhere in Airstrip One (Britain) other than London; the novel at one point suggests technical limitations, forcing the Party to use hidden microphones and patrols for surveillance purposes in the countryside.

The character O&#x27;Brien claims that he, as a member of the Inner Party, can turn off his telescreen (although etiquette dictates only for half an hour at a time). While the programmes could no longer be seen or heard, the screen still functioned as a surveillance device, as after Winston is taken into the Ministry of Love, the audio of his meeting with O&#x27;Brien with the telescreen &quot;off&quot; is played back to Winston. It is likely that Inner Party members are permitted to fully turn off their telescreens but O’Brien most likely kept the microphone on to expose Winston and Julia as Thought Criminals. The Outer Party Members are strictly prohibited from turning off their telescreens. Winston, a member of the Outer Party, can only turn the volume on his telescreen down.

The screens are monitored by the Thought Police. However, it is not clear how many screens are monitored at once, or what the precise criteria (if any) for monitoring a given screen are (although it is seen that during an exercise programme that Winston takes part in every morning, the instructor can see him). As the book notes:

Telescreen cameras do not have night vision technology, thus, they cannot monitor in the dark. This is compensated by the fact that their microphones are extremely sensitive, and they are said to pick up a heartbeat.

In addition to being surveillance devices, telescreens are also televisions. They broadcast propaganda about Oceania&#x27;s military victories, economic production figures, spirited renditions of the national anthem to heighten patriotism, and Two Minutes Hate, which is a two-minute film of Emmanuel Goldstein&#x27;s wishes for freedom of speech and press, which the citizens have been trained to disagree with through doublethink.

Though rationally aware that the telescreen is just the means by which a human being can see them or talk to them, the psychological effect of them is such that Orwell&#x27;s characters often tend to personify the telescreen and think in terms of the telescreen speaking to them or watching them, rather than any of the individuals using it. Moreover, the telescreen&#x27;s omnipresence in private and public life significantly affects the behaviour of the characters. Winston, for example, makes a regular effort to not arouse suspicion from anyone who may be watching him through the telescreen. The novel describes his setting &quot;his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen,&quot; and notes that when Winston turns his back to it, &quot;...as he well knew, even a back can be revealing.&quot;

== Origin ==
Jeff Prucher listed the first use of the term, as &quot;tele-screen&quot;, in a short story by F. Flagg, &quot;After Armageddon&quot;, in &quot;Wonder Stories&quot; in 1932. The word &quot;telescreen&quot; appears occasionally in the early science fiction novels of Robert Heinlein, published in the late 1940s - roughly concurrently with Orwell&#x27;s book. As used by Heinlein, &quot;telescreen&quot; denoted simply what is now called &quot;television&quot;, with none of the Orwellian sinister connotations. By the 1950s, the wide publicity of Orwell&#x27;s book precluded further such usage.

Orwell&#x27;s novel was written in 1947–1948. The telescreen he created was based on some already existing technologies (see history of television), although the first surveillance cameras began to be sold in the United States only in 1949, shortly after the publication of the novel.

According to the Canadian literary scholar Thomas Dilworth, Orwell, inventing telescreens, might have been inspired by the film &quot;Modern Times&quot; directed by Charlie Chaplin, where a device recording and receiving an audiovisual signal was shown. Dilworth noted that the theme of using subliminal messaging through the telescreen is also reminiscent of the theme of using hypnopedia on children in Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;.

Another inspiration for the telescreen could come from the 19th-century idea of a panopticon - a prison whose design would allow the prison guards to observe all prisoners, with the inmates not knowing if and when they are being watched.

== Analysis ==
The telescreen is basically the only significant futuristic technological gadget in Orwell&#x27;s book. Telescreens also appear in later works, such as the film &quot;Equilibrium&quot; by Kurt Wimmer (from 2002), where their use is no longer a technological novelty, but rather a &quot;retro-quote&quot; referring to Orwell&#x27;s work.

Telescreens have been described as an allegory or metaphor for informers in communist countries or, more broadly, of the loss of privacy in totalitarian states. Nowadays, telescreens are compared to, among others, a television surveillance system, TV sets controlled by voice commands that collect data (both actual commands and private conversations) for analysis on servers, modern cellphones, and other devices that allow people to collect audiovisual data, including the Internet itself.

Peter Huber notes that for Orwell, electronic media is ugly, oppressive and mind-numbing, and that Orwell believed that they would significantly empower those in power who would be given more and more opportunities to spy on citizens. Huber, however, consider Orwell&#x27;s argument to be wrong, pointing out that progress in the field of communication technology, including the Internet, is progress towards the technology of freedom, and the level of freedom of society increases with the development and popularity of these technologies. Similarly, Richard A. Posner writes that Orwell approached technology too pessimistically - in his book, the television (telescreen) is a tool for spying and indoctrination, while in fact this medium became an educational tool reducing the elite&#x27;s monopoly of power.

On the other hand, Lawrence Lessig gives Orwell some credence, arguing that a fictitious telescreen is less intrusive than today&#x27;s Internet; similarly, David Brin writes that the process of privacy erosion cannot be stopped, but it can be counterbalanced by monitoring monitors on a double telescreen basis, where those who monitor us can also be monitored.

The town of Inhambane existed in the 10th century, and was the southernmost port used by Arabs for slave trading. The region was visited by Vasco da Gama in 1498, who claimed Inhambane Bay for Portugal. The Portuguese established a trading post at Inhambane in 1534.

The province is the second largest grower of cashews (after Nampula), and also produces coconut and citrus fruit (inspiring Mozambique&#x27;s most famous poet Craveirinha to write of &quot;The Tasty Tangerines of Inhambane&quot;). The long coastline supports much fishing. The Inhambane Bay area is of some interest for tourism, with a number of beaches, and one of the last remaining populations of dugong in Mozambique.

<doc id="210008" wikidata="Q1372774" url="?curid=210008" title="Lao cuisine">
<text>Lao cuisine or Laotian cuisine (, , ) is the national cuisine of Laos.

The staple food of the Lao is sticky rice (, &quot;khao niao&quot;, ). Laos has the highest sticky rice consumption per-capita in the world with an average of of sticky rice consumed annually per person. Sticky rice is deeply ingrained in the culture, religious tradition, and national identity of Laos. It is a common belief within the Lao community that no matter where they are in the world, sticky rice will always be the glue that holds the Lao communities together, connecting them to their culture and to Laos. Affinity for sticky rice is considered the essence of what it means to be Lao. Often the Lao will refer to themselves as &quot;luk khao niao&quot; (, ), which can be translated as &#x27;children or descendants of sticky rice&#x27;.

The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has described Laos as a &quot;collector&#x27;s paradise&quot;. Laos has the highest degrees of biodiversity of sticky rice in the world. As of 2013, approximately 6,530 glutinous rice varieties were collected from five continents (Asia, South America, North America, Europe and Africa) where glutinous rice are grown for preservation at the International Rice Genebank (IRGC). The IRRI gathered more than 13,500 samples and 3,200 varieties of glutinous rice from Laos.

The trifecta of Laos&#x27; national cuisine are sticky rice, &quot;larb&quot;, and green papaya salad (, ). The most famous Lao dish is &quot;larb&quot; (, ; sometimes also spelled &quot;laab&quot; or &quot;laap&quot;), a spicy mixture of marinated meat or fish that is sometimes raw (prepared like &quot;ceviche&quot;) with a variable combination of herbs, greens, and spices.

Lao cuisine has many regional variations, corresponding in part to the fresh foods local to each region. A French legacy is still evident in the capital city, Vientiane, where baguettes (, ) are sold on the street and French restaurants are common and popular, which were first introduced when Laos was a part of French Indochina.

==Origins of the Lao cuisine==
The Lao originally came from a northern region that is now part of China. As they moved south they brought their traditions with them. Due to historical Lao migrations from Laos into neighboring regions, Lao cuisine has influenced the mainly Lao-populated region of Northeastern Thailand, and Lao foods were also introduced to Cambodia and Northern Thailand where the Lao have migrated.
Like most Southeast Asian nations, Laos has been heavily influenced by Indian and Chinese culture. From time immemorial, Lao people traded directly with ancient China. It was the Indianization of Laos, however, that has had the most impact. The spread of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam into Southeast Asia during this period took with it Indian traditions and culture to what are now Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Burma, Cambodia and Laos where it took roots and continues to flourish to this day. It is also during this time that Buddhist monks introduced traditional Indian spices, curry, and coconut milk to Laos. However, unlike most of its neighbours, Lao people&#x27;s affinity for glutinous or sticky rice and Lao cuisine&#x27;s heavy focus on sticky rice meant that coconut milk and noodles never played a significant role in Lao cuisine. Instead, coconut milk, curry and noodles are limited to a few Laotian soups, noodle dishes and sticky rice-based desserts. 

With the Columbian exchange, non-native crops—such as tomato, papaya, sweetcorn, pineapple, and chili peppers—were introduced to Southeast Asia probably through the various sea ports of modern-day Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam via the Philippines and Malacca. Through trades with the Portuguese and other Europeans, acceptance and cultivation of non-native crops and ingredients quickly spread throughout Southeast Asia.

By the mid-1500s, Europeans were exploring and trading with mainland Southeast Asia, reaching as far as Vientiane and Luang Prabang. Some of the more notable Europeans who had travelled there or wrote extensively about their experiences were Fernão Mendes Pinto (1542-1545), Diogo Veloso and Blas Ruiz (1596), Geebard van Wusthof (1641), Giovanni Filippo de Marini (1642-1648), Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix (1830), and Henri Mouhot (1861).

Simon de la Loubère (1642-1729) observed that the cultivation of the papaya was already widespread in Siam around the early-1700s and by the time Pallegoix arrived as missionary to Bangkok, the papaya and chili peppers was already fully integrated in the Lao territory, dependencies and the Southeast Asian food culture as a whole.

French explorer Mouhot, during his trip to Luang Prabang, noted that the Laotians adored chili peppers.

==Lao and Thai cuisine==
In his book &quot;Culture and Customs of Laos&quot;, Arne Kislenko noted the following about Lao cuisine:

Any discussion about Lao cuisine cannot be limited to Laos. There are approximately six times more ethnic Lao in the Isan region of northeastern Thailand than in Laos itself, which makes it necessary to go beyond national boundaries in search of definitively Lao food. In fact, with the recent droves of migrants from Isan further south to Bangkok, the Thai capital has in many respects become the epicenter of Lao cuisine. Some estimate that more Lao are there than in any other city in the world, including Vientiane. There are also sizable expatriate communities in places like the United States and France that make for numerous culinary variations abroad.

According to the cultural anthropologist Penny Van Esterik, during the 1950s and 1960s, Lao food was little known by the central Thais and could be found only where there were gatherings of Lao or northeasterners: 

In the 1950s and 1960s glutinous rice, roast chicken, &quot;laab&quot;, &quot;somtam&quot; (papaya salad), and other Lao favorites were available in Bangkok only around the boxing stadium where northeastern boxers and fans gathered to eat and drink before and after boxing matches. Lao food could also be found outside construction sites in mobile food carts providing construction workers from the northeast with their regional foods and beside gas stations serving long-distance bus drivers.

At the conclusion of the Vietnam War, between 1975 and 1995, it was estimated that approximately 200,000 Lao refugees crossed the Mekong River into Thailand. Most stayed in the refugee camps while others moved to Bangkok looking for work.

The opening of the Mittraphap Road and the northeastern railway connecting central Thailand to its northern provinces created a gateway for one of Thailand&#x27;s biggest inter-regional migrations during the economic boom of the 1980s, as demand for labour increased. It was estimated that between 1980 and 1990, about 1.1 million northeasterners moved from the northeast to central Thailand and Bangkok. This, in turn, helped popularize and create an unprecedented demand for Lao food outside of Laos and the northeast.

Van Esterik also noted that, &quot;[i]n attempting to include northeastern food in a standardized national cuisine, middle-class Bangkok selected and modified the taste of a few dishes—grilled chicken, &quot;somtam&quot;, &quot;laab&quot;—by reducing the chili peppers and increasing the sugar, and ignored other dishes such as fermented fish and insects&quot;. According to Professor Sirijit Sunanta, these dishes were then represented as Thai food when presented to the world.

Although more ethnic Lao live in Thailand than in Laos and Lao cuisine is key to popularising Thai food abroad, the word &quot;Lao&quot; is hardly mentioned. This is perhaps due to forced Thaification, an official attempt to promote national unity and &quot;Thainess&quot;, in which any mention of &quot;Lao&quot; and other non-Thai descriptors were removed and replaced with &quot;northeastern Thai&quot; or &quot;Isan&quot;.

Consequently, Thaification has led to social discrimination against northeasterners, and the word &quot;Lao&quot; became a derogatory term. Being &quot;Lao&quot; was stigmatized as being uneducated and backward, causing many northeasterners to be ashamed to be known as Lao. However, there is a sense of resurgence and pride in Lao identity as it loses its stigma, particularly among the Isan youth.

In the West, even with sizable expatriate communities, Lao cuisine is still virtually unknown, even though much of what is served in Thai restaurants is likely to be Lao or Lao-owned. Unbeknownst to most people, when they eat their favourite som tam, larb, and sticky rice at their favourite Thai or northeastern Thai (Isan) restaurants they are actually eating the Thai versions of traditional Lao food. This accidental reinforcement of Thaification by expatriate Lao communities and Lao restaurateurs is observed by Malaphone Phommasa and Celestine Detvongsa in their article &quot;Lao American Ethnic Economy&quot;:
Unlike […] ethnic specific stores, Lao-owned restaurants are doing better in reaching out to the general public. Although there are some restaurants that advertised as singularly &quot;Laotian&quot;, many Lao restaurants are established under the guise of Thai restaurants and Thai/Lao restaurants to entice mainstream customers. Because most Americans are unfamiliar with Laotian food, Lao entrepreneurs have aimed to acquire more business by advertising themselves as Thai restaurants: the latter have successfully achieved popularity with the mainstream population. These restaurateurs would then incorporate Lao dishes onto the menu. Although there are many similarities between Lao and northern Thai cuisine, certain foods will distinguish a true Thai restaurant from a Lao-owned restaurant would be the inclusion of &quot;sticky rice&quot; on the menu... One of the earliest Thai restaurants to open in North America was by Keo Sananikone, a Lao refugee and early pioneer of Thai food in the US. In 1977, Keo opened a series of Thai restaurants starting with Mekong, Keo&#x27;s, and Mekong II in Hawaii, which became a hot spot for the Hollywood crowd. Keo later wrote an internationally best-selling Thai cookbook, &quot;Keo&#x27;s Thai Cuisine&quot;, in 1985. Keo explains the reason for opening Thai as opposed to Lao restaurants: &quot;I felt that Laotian food would not have been successful in America at that time. Laotian food is very basic and simple, and Thai food is very exotic and colourful.&quot;

=== Insects ===
===Fruits===
Fruits in Laos include watermelon, pineapple, sugar apple, (custard apple or sweetsop), longan, litchi, Asian pear, mango, rose apple (water apple), banana, jackfruit, rambutan, young coconut, orange, sweet tamarind, papaya, durian, sugarcane, pomelo, sapodilla, guava, star apple, mangosteen, melon, santol, langsat, grapes, corossolier (soursop), &quot;mak yom&quot;, and &quot;mak num nom&quot;.

==Kitchen utensils==
The typical Lao stove, or brazier, is called a &quot;tao-lo&quot; and is fueled by charcoal. It is shaped like a bucket, with room for a single pot or pan to sit on top. The wok, &quot;maw khang&quot; in Lao, is used for frying and stir frying. Sticky rice is steamed inside of a bamboo basket, a &quot;huad&quot;, which sits on top of a pot, which is called the &quot;maw nung&quot;.

A large, deep mortar called a &quot;khok&quot; is used for pounding &quot;tam mak hoong&quot; and other foods. It is indispensable in the Lao kitchen.

==Cooking methods==

Grilling, boiling, stewing, steaming, searing and mixing (as in salads) are all traditional cooking methods. Stir-frying is common, and considered to be a Chinese influence. Stews are often green in color, because of the large proportion of vegetables used as well as &quot;ya nang&quot; leaf. 

&quot;Ping&quot; means grilled. &quot;Ping gai&quot; is grilled chicken, &quot;ping sin&quot; is grilled meat, and &quot;ping pa&quot; is grilled fish. Before grilling, the meat may be seasoned with minced garlic, minced coriander root, minced galangal, salt, soy sauce, and fish sauce.

Ways Lao food differs from neighboring cuisines include that Lao meals commonly include a large quantity of fresh raw greens, vegetables and herbs served undressed on the side, and that savory dishes are never sweet, and some dishes are bitter.

==Eating customs==
The traditional manner of eating was communal, with diners sitting on a reed mat on the wooden floor around a raised platform woven out of rattan called a &quot;ka toke&quot;. Dishes are arranged on the &quot;ka toke,&quot; which is of a standard size. Where there are many diners, multiple &quot;ka tokes&quot; will be prepared. Each &quot;ka toke&quot; will have one or more baskets of sticky rice, which is shared by all the diners at the &quot;ka toke.&quot;

In recent times, eating at a &quot;ka toke&quot; is the exception rather than the rule. The custom is maintained, however, at temples, where each monk is served his meal on a &quot;ka toke.&quot; Once food is placed on the &quot;ka toke&quot; it becomes a &quot;pha kao&quot;. In modern homes, the term for preparing the table for a meal is still &quot;taeng pha kao,&quot; or prepare the &quot;phah kao.&quot;

Traditionally, spoons were used only for soups and white rice, and chopsticks (ໄມ້ທູ່,&quot;mai thu&quot;) were used only for noodles. Most food was handled by hand. The reason this custom evolved is probably due to the fact that sticky rice can only be easily handled by hand.

Lao meals typically consist of a soup dish, a grilled dish, a sauce, greens, and a stew or mixed dish (&quot;koy&quot; or &quot;laap&quot;). The greens are usually fresh raw greens, herbs and other vegetables, though depending on the dish they accompany, they could also be steamed or more typically, parboiled. Dishes are not eaten in sequence; the soup is sipped throughout the meal. Beverages, including water, are not typically a part of the meal. When guests are present, the meal is always a feast, with food made in quantities sufficient for twice the number of diners. For a host, not having enough food for guests would be humiliating.

The custom is to close the rice basket when one is finished eating.

==Drinks==
Lao coffee is often called &quot;Pakxong&quot; coffee (&quot;cafe pakxong&quot; in Lao), which is grown on the Bolovens Plateau around the town of Pakxong. This area is sometimes said to be the best place in Southeast Asia for coffee cultivation. Both &quot;robusta&quot; and &quot;Arabica&quot; are grown in Laos. Most of the Arabica in Laos is consumed locally and most of the Robusta is exported to Thailand, where it goes into Nescafé. The custom in Laos is to drink coffee in glasses, with condensed milk in the bottom, followed by a chaser of green tea. The highly regarded tea is also grown on the Bolovens Plateau.

There are two general types of traditional alcoholic beverages, both produced from rice: &quot;lao hai&quot; and &quot;lao lao&quot;. &quot;Lao hai&quot; means &quot;jar alcohol&quot; and is served from an earthen jar. It is communally and competitively drunk through straws at festive occasions. It can be likened to sake in appearance and flavor. &quot;Lao lao&quot; or &quot;Lao alcohol&quot; is more like a whiskey. It is also called &quot;lao khao&quot; or, in English, &quot;white alcohol&quot;. However, there is also a popular variant of lao lao made from purple rice, which has a pinkish hue.

The Lao state-owned brewery&#x27;s Beerlao has become very popular in Laos. The &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; has described it as the &quot;Dom Pérignon&quot; of Asian beers. In 2004, &quot;Time&quot; magazine described it as Asia&#x27;s best beer. In June 2005, it beat 40 other brews to take the silver prize at Russia&#x27;s Osiris Beer Festival, which it had entered for the first time.

<text>Glutinous rice (&quot;Oryza sativa var. glutinosa&quot;; also called sticky rice, sweet rice or waxy rice) is a type of rice grown mainly in Southeast Asia and the northeastern regions of South Asia, which has opaque grains and very low amylose content and is especially sticky when cooked. It is widely consumed across Asia.

It is called glutinous () in the sense of being glue-like or sticky, and not in the sense of containing gluten (which it does not). While often called &quot;sticky rice&quot;, it differs from non-glutinous strains of japonica rice, which also become sticky to some degree when cooked. There are numerous cultivars of glutinous rice, which include &quot;japonica&quot;, &quot;indica&quot; and &quot;tropical japonica&quot; strains.

==History==
The origin of glutinous rice is difficult to ascertain because of its long-standing cultural importance across a wide geographical region in Asia.

A 2002 genetic study discovered that the waxy mutation that disrupted amylose synthesis likely has a single origin. This is supported by the fact that all glutinous rice accessions in the study contain the same mutation. From comparisons of subsequent mutations in the different accessions in the study, it was found that the progenitor haplotype is highest among Southeast Asian glutinous rice cultivars, indicating strongly that the waxy mutation first arose in Southeast Asia, likely in the upland regions of Mainland Southeast Asia, before spreading to the rest of Asia.

The waxy mutation is also known to have first arisen in temperate japonica rice, where it is far more common, before spreading to tropical japonica rice (javanica) and indica cultivars via gene flow.

==Cultivation==
Glutinous rice is cultivated in countries across Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and East Asia, including Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Northeast India, China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines. In Laos, it is estimated that 85% of the rice produced is glutinous rice.

As of 2013, the International Rice Genebank (IRGC) has preserved approximately 6,530 varieties of glutinous rice from five continents—Asia, South America, North America, Europe, and Africa. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has referred to Laos as a &quot;collector&#x27;s paradise&quot; for its remarkable diversity of glutinous rice. IRRI-trained collectors have gathered over 13,500 samples and 3,200 distinct varieties from Laos alone, making it home to the largest known biodiversity of sticky rice in the world.

==Composition==
Glutinous rice is distinguished from other types of rice by having no (or negligible amounts of) amylose and high amounts of amylopectin (the two components of starch). Amylopectin is responsible for the sticky quality of glutinous rice. The difference has been traced to a single mutation that farmers selected.

Like all types of rice, glutinous rice does not contain dietary gluten (i.e. does not contain glutenin and gliadin) and should be safe for gluten-free diets.

Glutinous rice can be consumed milled or unmilled (that is, with the bran removed or not removed). Milled glutinous rice is white and fully opaque (unlike non-glutinous rice varieties, which are somewhat translucent when raw), whereas the bran can give unmilled glutinous rice a purple or black colour. Black and purple glutinous rice are distinct strains of white glutinous rice. In developing Asia, there is little regulation, and some governments have issued advisories about toxic dyes being added to colour-adulterated rice. Both black and white glutinous rice can be cooked as discrete grains or ground into flour and cooked as a paste or gel.

==Use in foods==
Glutinous rice is used in a wide variety of traditional dishes in different countries. They include the following:

===Bangladesh===
Especially in the eastern side (Chittagong, Cox&#x27;s Bazaar, Sylhet areas) of Bangladesh, Glutinous rice is known as Binni chal (Bangla: বিন্নি চাল) or Binni choil (বিন্নি ছোইল) in Chittagong, both meaning &quot;husked sticky rice&quot; in Bangla. Both white and pink varieties are cultivated at many homestead farms. Unhusked sticky rice is called &quot;binni dhan&quot;. Boiled or steamed &quot;binni chal&quot; is called &quot;binni bhat&quot;. Served with a curry of fish or meat, &quot;Binni Bhat&quot; is a popular breakfast. Sometimes, it is eaten with a splash of palm sugar or cane sugar, salt, and coconut shreds alone. &quot;Binni dhan&quot; is also used to make &quot;khoi&quot; (popcorn-like puffed rice) and &quot;chida&quot; (bitten husked rice).

Many other sweet items, or Pitha made of &quot;binni chal&quot; are also popular:

One pitha made of &quot;binni chal&quot; is &quot;Atikka pitha&quot;. It is made with a mixture of cubed or small sliced coconut, white or brown sugar, (specifically date palm sugar), ripe bananas, milk, and &quot;binni chal&quot; wrapped in banana leaf and steamed. A similar dessert is enjoyed throughout Southeast Asian countries where it is known as Khao tom mat in Thai, Num ansom in Khmer, Lepet in Indonesian, Suman in Filipino, Bánh tét and Bánh chưng in Vietnamese, and Khao tom in Lao.

Another delicacy is called &quot;Binni chaler patishapta pitha, which is sprayed over a hot pan and then adding a mixture of grated coconut, palm sugar, and sometimes milk powder in the center to make a roll.

One kind of rice porridge made of &quot;binni chal&quot; is called &quot;Modhu bhat&quot;, which literally means &quot;honey rice&quot;. It is made by cooking water and &quot;binni chal&quot; for a long time, slightly blending it, and then topping it off with coconut shreds. This is also a delicacy known to the Chittagong area.

===Cambodia===
Glutinous rice is known as &quot;bay damnaeb&quot; () in Khmer.

In Cambodian cuisine, glutinous rice is primarily used for desserts and is an essential ingredient for most sweet dishes, such as &quot;ansom chek&quot;, &quot;kralan&quot;, and &quot;num ple aiy&quot;.

===China===

In the Chinese language, glutinous rice is known as &quot;nuòmǐ&quot; (糯米) or &quot;chu̍t-bí&quot; (秫米) in Hokkien.

Glutinous rice is also often ground to make glutinous rice flour. This flour is made into &quot;niangao&quot; and sweet-filled dumplings &quot;tangyuan&quot;, both of which are commonly eaten at Chinese New Year. It is also used as a thickener and for baking.

Glutinous rice or glutinous rice flour are both used in many Chinese bakery products and in many varieties of dim sum. They produce a flexible, resilient dough, which can take on the flavours of whatever other ingredients are added to it. Cooking usually consists of steaming or boiling, sometimes followed by pan-frying or deep-frying.

Sweet glutinous rice is eaten with red bean paste.

&quot;Nuòmǐ fàn&quot; (糯米飯), is steamed glutinous rice usually cooked with Chinese sausage, chopped Chinese mushrooms, chopped barbecued pork, and optionally dried shrimp or scallop (the recipe varies depending on the cook&#x27;s preference).

&quot;Zongzi&quot; (Traditional Chinese 糭子/糉子, Simplified Chinese 粽子) is a dumpling consisting of glutinous rice and sweet or savoury fillings wrapped in large flat leaves (usually bamboo), which is then boiled or steamed. It is especially eaten during the Dragon Boat Festival but may be eaten at any time of the year. It is popular as an easily transported snack, or a meal to consume while travelling. It is a common food among Chinese in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia.

Cifangao (Traditional Chinese 糍飯糕, Simplified Chinese 糍饭糕) is a popular breakfast food originating in Eastern China consisting of cooked glutinous rice compressed into squares or rectangles, and then deep-fried. Additional seasoning and ingredients such as beans, zha cai, and sesame seeds may be added to the rice for added flavour. It has a similar appearance and external texture to hash browns.

&quot;Cifantuan&quot; (Traditional Chinese 糍飯糰, Simplified Chinese 糍饭团) is another breakfast food consisting of a piece of youtiao tightly wrapped in cooked glutinous rice, with or without additional seasoning ingredients. Japanese onigiri resembles this Chinese food.

&quot;Lo mai gai&quot; (糯米雞) is a dim sum dish consisting of glutinous rice with chicken in a lotus-leaf wrap, which is then steamed. It is served as a dim sum dish in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia.

&quot;Ba bao fan&quot; (八寶飯), or &quot;eight treasure rice&quot;, is a dessert made from glutinous rice, steamed and mixed with lard, sugar, and eight kinds of fruits or nuts. It can also be eaten as the main course.

A distinctive feature of the cuisine of the Hakka people of Southern China is its variety of steamed snack-type buns, dumplings, and patties made with a dough of coarsely ground rice, or &quot;ban&quot;. Collectively known as &quot;rice snacks&quot;, some kinds are filled with various salty or sweet ingredients.

Common examples of rice snacks made with &quot;ban&quot; from glutinous or sticky rice and non-glutinous rice include &quot;Aiban&quot; (mugwort patty), &quot;Caibao&quot; (yam bean bun), &quot;Ziba&quot; (sticky rice balls) and &quot;Bantiao&quot; (&quot;Mianpaban&quot; or flat rice noodles).

&quot;Aiban&quot; encompasses several varieties of steamed patties and dumplings of various shapes and sizes, consisting of an outer layer made of glutinous &quot;ban&quot; dough filled with salty or sweet ingredients. It gets its name from the aromatic &quot;ai&quot; grass (mugwort), which after being dried, powdered, and mixed with the &quot;ban&quot;, gives the dough a green colour and an intriguing tea-like taste. Typical salty fillings include ground pork, mushrooms, and shredded white turnips. The most common sweet filling is made with red beans.

&quot;Caibao&quot; is a generic term for all types of steamed buns with various sorts of filling. Hakka-style &quot;caibao&quot; are distinctive in that the enclosing skin is made with glutinous rice dough in place of wheat flour dough. Besides ground pork, mushrooms, and shredded turnips, fillings may include ingredients such as dried shrimp and dry fried-shallot flakes.

&quot;Ziba&quot; is glutinous rice dough that, after steaming in a big container, is mashed into a sticky, putty-like mass from which small patties are formed. After that, it is to be place in a dry place to dry. When ready to eat, it is commonly be fried, boiled or grilled. Then, it is usually coated with a layer of Chinese brown sugar syrup with sugary peanut or soybean powder. It has no filling.

===Indonesia===
Glutinous rice is known as beras ketan or simply ketan in Java and most of Indonesia, and pulut in Sumatra. It is widely used as an ingredient for a wide variety of sweet, savoury, or fermented snacks. Glutinous rice is used as either hulled grains or milled into flour. It is usually mixed with santan, meaning coconut milk in Indonesian, along with a bit of salt to add some taste. Glutinous rice is rarely eaten as a staple. One example is &quot;lemang&quot;, which is glutinous rice and coconut milk cooked in bamboo stems lined by banana leaves. Glutinous rice is also sometimes used in a mix with normal rice in rice dishes such as &quot;nasi tumpeng&quot; or nasi tim. It is widely used during the Lebaran seasons as traditional food. It is also used in the production of alcoholic beverages such as &quot;tuak&quot; and &quot;brem bali&quot;.

====Savoury snacks====
* Ketan – traditionally refers to the glutinous rice itself as well as sticky rice delicacy in its simplest form. The handful mounds of glutinous rice are rounded and sprinkled with grated coconut, either fresh or sauteed as serundeng.
* Ketupat – square-shaped crafts made from the same local leaves as &quot;palas&quot;, but it is usually filled with regular rice grains instead of &quot;pulut&quot;, though it depends on the maker.
* Gandos – a snack made from ground glutinous rice mixed with grated coconut, and fried.
* Lemang – wrapped in banana leaves and inside a bamboo, and left to be barbecued/grilled on an open fire, to make the taste and texture tender and unique
* Lemper – cooked glutinous rice with shredded meat inside and wrapped in banana leaves, popular in Java
* Nasi kuning – either common rice or glutinous rice can be made into ketan kuning, yellow rice coloured with turmeric
* Songkolo or Sokko – steamed black glutinous rice serves with serundeng, anchovies, and sambal. It was very popular in Makassar
* Tumpeng – glutinous rice can be made into tumpeng nasi kuning, yellow rice coloured by turmeric, and shaped into a cone.

====Sweet snacks====
* Variety of kue – glutinous rice flour is also used in certain traditional local desserts, known as &quot;kue&quot;, such as &quot;kue lapis&quot;.
* Bubur ketan hitam – black glutinous rice porridge with coconut milk and palm sugar syrup
* Cendil – glutinous rice flour cake with sugar and grated coconut
* Dodol – traditional sweets made of glutinous rice flour and coconut sugar. Similar variants include &quot;wajik&quot; (or &quot;wajit&quot;).
* Gemblong – white glutinous rice flour balls smeared with palm sugar caramel. In East Java, it was known as &quot;getas&quot;, except it uses black glutinous rice flour as the main ingredient.
* Jipang – popped glutinous rice held together by caramelized sugar
* Klepon – glutinous rice flour balls filled with palm sugar and coated with grated coconut
* Lupis – glutinous rice wrapped in individual triangles using banana leaves and left to boil for a few hours. The rice pieces are then tossed with grated coconut all over and served with palm sugar syrup.
* Onde-onde – glutinous rice flour balls filled with sweetened mung bean paste and coated with sesame similar to Jin deui
* Wingko babat – baked glutinous rice flour with coconut

====Fermented snacks====
* Brem – solid cake from the dehydrated juice of pressed fermented glutinous rice
* Tapai ketan – cooked glutinous rice fermented with &quot;yeast&quot;, wrapped in banana or roseapple leaves. Usually eaten as it is or in a mixed cold dessert

====Crackers====
* Rengginang – traditional rice crackers related to kerupuk

In addition, glutinous rice dishes adapted from other cultures are just as easily available. Examples include &quot;kue moci&quot; (mochi, Japanese) and &quot;bacang&quot; (zongzi, Chinese).

===Japan===
In Japan, glutinous rice is known as &quot;mochigome&quot; (). It is used in traditional dishes such as sekihan also known as Red bean rice, okowa, and ohagi. It may also be ground into &quot;mochiko&quot; (もち粉), a rice flour, used to make &quot;mochi&quot; (もち), a kind of sweet rice cake. Mochi is traditionally prepared for the Japanese New Year, but can also be eaten year-round. Many different types of mochi exist from different regions, and they are normally flavoured with traditional ingredients such as red beans, water chestnuts, green tea, and pickled cherry flowers. See also Japanese rice.

===Korea===
In Korea, glutinous rice is called &quot;chapssal&quot; (), and its characteristic stickiness is called &quot;chalgi&quot; (). Cooked rice made of glutinous rice is called &quot;chalbap&quot; () and rice cakes () are called &quot;chalddeok&quot; or &quot;chapssalddeok&quot; (). &quot;Chalbap&quot; is used as stuffing in &quot;samgyetang&quot; ().

===Laos===
Along the Greater Mekong Sub-region, the Lao have been cultivating glutinous rice for approximately 4000 – 6000 years. Glutinous rice is the national dish of Laos. In Laos, a tiny landlocked nation with a population of approximately 6 million, per-capita sticky rice consumption is the highest on earth at 171 kg or 377 pounds per year.
Sticky rice is deeply ingrained in the culture, religious tradition, and national identity of Laos (see Lao cuisine). Sticky rice is considered the essence of what it means to be Lao. It has been said that no matter where they are in the world, sticky rice will always be the glue that holds the Lao communities together, connecting them to their culture and to Laos. Lao people often identify themselves as the &quot;children of sticky rice&quot; and if they did not eat sticky rice, they would not be Lao.

Sticky rice is known as &quot;khao niao&quot; (Lao:): &quot;khao&quot; means rice, and &quot;niao&quot; means sticky. It is cooked by soaking for several hours and then steaming in a bamboo basket or &quot;houat&quot; (Lao: ຫວດ). After that, it should be turned out on a clean surface and kneaded with a wooden paddle to release the steam; this results in rice balls that will stick to themselves but not to fingers. The large rice ball is kept in a small basket made of bamboo or &quot;thip khao&quot; (Lao:ຕິບເຂົ້າ). The rice is sticky but dry, rather than wet and gummy-like non-glutinous varieties. Laotians consume glutinous rice as part of their main diet; they also use toasted glutinous rice &quot;khao khoua&quot; (Lao:ເຂົ້າຄົ່ວ) to add a nut-like flavour to many dishes. A popular Lao meal is a combination of larb (Lao:ລາບ), Lao grilled chicken ping gai (Lao:ປີ້ງໄກ່), spicy green papaya salad dish known as &quot;tam mak hoong&quot; (Lao:ຕຳໝາກຫູ່ງ), and sticky rice (&quot;khao niao&quot;).

*Khao lam (Lao:ເຂົ້າຫລາມ): sticky rice is mixed with coconut milk, red or black bean, or taro, and is filled in a bamboo tube. The tube is roasted until all the ingredients are cooked and blended together to give a sweet aromatic treat. Khao Lam is such a popular food for Laotians and is sold on the streets.
*Nam Khao (Lao:ແໝມເຂົ້າ): sticky rice has also been used for preparing a popular dish from Laos called Nam Khao (or Laotian crispy rice salad). It is made with a deep-fried mixture of sticky rice and jasmine rice balls, chunks of Lao-style fermented pork sausage called som moo, chopped peanuts, grated coconut, sliced scallions or shallots, mint, cilantro, lime juice, fish sauce, and other ingredients.
*Khao Khua (Lao:ເຂົ້າຂົ້ວ): sticky rice are toasted and crushed. Khao Khua is a necessary ingredient for preparing a national Laotian dish called Larb (Lao:ລາບ) and Nam Tok (Lao:ນ້ຳຕົກ) that are popular for ethnic Lao people living in both Laos and in the Northeastern region of Thailand called Isan.
*Khao tom (Lao:ເຂົ້າຕົ້ມ): a steamed mixture of &quot;khao niao&quot; with sliced fruits and coconut milk wrapped in banana leaf.
*Khao jee: Lao sticky rice pancakes with egg coating, an ancient Laotian cooking method of grilling glutinous rice or sticky rice over an open fire.
*Sai Krok (Lao:ໄສ້ກອກ): Lao sausage made from coarsely chopped fatty pork seasoned with lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, shallots, cilantro, chillies, garlic, salt, and sticky rice.
*Or lam (Lao:ເອາະຫຼາມ): a mildly spicy and tongue-numbing stew originating from Luang Prabang, Laos.
*Lao-Lao (Lao:ເຫລົ້າລາວ): Laotian rice whisky produced in Laos.

Khao niao is also used as an ingredient in desserts. Khao niao mixed with coconut milk can be served with ripened mango or durian.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, glutinous rice is known as pulut. It is usually mixed with santan (coconut milk) along with a bit of salt to add some taste. It is widely used during the Raya festive seasons as traditional food which is shared with certain parts of Indonesia, such as:
* Dodol – traditional sweets made of glutinous rice flour and coconut sugar. Similar variants are &quot;wajik&quot; (or &quot;wajit&quot;).
* Inang-inang – glutinous rice cracker. Popular in Melaka.
* Kelupis – a type of glutinous rice kuih in East Malaysia.
* Ketupat – square-shaped crafts made from the same local leaves as &quot;palas&quot;, but it is usually filled with regular rice grains instead of &quot;pulut&quot;, though it depends on the maker.
* Kochi – Malay-Peranakan sweet and sticky kuih.
* Lamban – another type of glutinous rice dessert in East Malaysia.
* Lemang – wrapped in banana leaves and inside a bamboo, and left to be barbecued/grilled on an open fire, to make the taste and texture tender and unique.

===Myanmar===
Glutinous rice, called &quot;kao hnyin&quot; (), is very popular in Myanmar (also known as Burma).
* &quot;Kao hnyin baung&quot; () is a breakfast dish with boiled peas (pèbyouk) or with a variety of fritters, such as urad dal (&quot;baya gyaw&quot;), served on a banana leaf. It may be cooked wrapped in a banana leaf, often with peas, and served with a sprinkle of salted toasted sesame seeds and often grated coconut.
* The purple variety, known as &quot;kao hynin ngacheik&quot; (), is equally popular cooked as &quot;ngacheik paung&quot;.
* They may both be cooked and pounded into cakes with sesame called &quot;hkaw bouk&quot;, another favourite version in the north among the Shan and the Kachin, and served grilled or fried.
* The &quot;Htamanè pwè&quot; festival () takes place on the full moon of Dabodwè() (February), when &quot;htamanè&quot; () is cooked in a huge wok. Two men, each with a wooden spoon the size of an oar, and a third man coordinate the action of folding and stirring the contents, which include &quot;kao hnyin&quot;, &quot;ngacheik&quot;, coconut shavings, peanuts, sesame and ginger in peanut oil.
* &quot;Si htamin&quot; () is glutinous rice cooked with turmeric and onions in peanut oil, and served with toasted sesame and crisp-fried onions; it is a popular breakfast like &quot;kao hnyin baung&quot; and &quot;ngacheik paung&quot;.
* &quot;Paung din&quot; () or &quot;Kao hyin kyi tauk&quot; () is another ready-to-eat portable form cooked in a segment of bamboo. When the bamboo is peeled off, a thin skin remains around the rice and also gives off a distinctive aroma.

===Nepal===
In Nepal, Latte/Chamre is a popular dish made from glutinous rice during Teej festival, the greatest festival of Nepalese women.

===Northeastern India===
Sticky rice called &quot;bora saul&quot; is the core component of indigenous Assamese sweets, snacks, and breakfast. This rice is widely used in the traditional sweets of Assam, which are very different from the traditional sweets of India whose basic component is milk.

Such traditional sweets in Assam are Pitha (Narikolor pitha, Til pitha, Ghila pitha, Tel pitha, Keteli pitha, Sunga pitha, Sunga saul etc.). Also, its powder form is used as breakfast or other light meals directly with milk. They are called Pitha guri (if the powder was done without frying the rice, by just crushing it after soaking) or Handoh guri (if rice is dry fried first, and then crushed).

The soaked rice is also cooked with no added water inside a special kind of bamboo (called &quot;sunga saul bnaah&quot;). This meal is called &quot;sunga saul&quot;.

During religious ceremonies, indigenous Assamese communities make &quot;Mithoi&quot; (&quot;Kesa mithoi&quot; and &quot;Poka mithoi&quot;) using &quot;Gnud&quot; with it. Sometimes &quot;Bhog&quot;, &quot;Payokh&quot; are also made from it using milk and sugar with it.

Different indigenous Assamese communities make rice beer from sticky rice, preferring it over other varieties of rice for the sweeter and more alcoholic result. This rice beer is also offered to their gods and ancestors. Rice cooked with it is also taken directly as lunch or dinner on rare occasions.
Similarly, other indigenous communities from NE India use sticky rice in various forms similar to the native Assamese style in their cuisine.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, glutinous rice is known as malagkit in Tagalog or pilit in Visayan, among other names such as diket in Ilocano. Both mean &quot;sticky&quot;. The most common way glutinous rice is prepared in the Philippines is by soaking uncooked glutinous rice in water or coconut milk (usually overnight) and then grinding it into a thick paste (traditionally with stone mills). This produces a rich and smooth viscous rice dough known as galapóng, which is the basis for numerous rice cakes in the Philippines. However, in modern preparation methods, &quot;galapong&quot; is sometimes made directly from dry glutinous rice flour (or from commercial Japanese &quot;mochiko&quot;), with poorer-quality results.

&quot;Galapong&quot; was traditionally allowed to ferment, which is still required for certain dishes. A small amount of starter culture of microorganisms (&quot;tapay&quot; or &quot;bubod&quot;) or palm wine (&quot;tubâ&quot;) may be traditionally added to rice being soaked to hasten the fermentation. These can be substituted with yeast or baking soda in modern versions. Other versions of &quot;galapong&quot; may also be treated with wood ash lye.

Aside from the numerous white and red glutinous rice cultivars, the most widely used glutinous rice heirloom cultivars in the Philippines are &quot;tapol&quot; rice, which is milky white in colour, and &quot;pirurutong&quot; rice, which ranges in colour from black to purple to reddish brown. However both varieties are expensive and becoming increasingly rare, thus some Filipino recipes nowadays substitute it with dyed regular glutinous rice or infuse purple yam (&quot;ube&quot;) to achieve the same colouration.

Dessert delicacies in the Philippines are known as &quot;kakanin&quot; (from &quot;kanin&quot;, &quot;prepared rice&quot;). These were originally made primarily from rice, but in recent centuries, the term has come to encompass dishes made from other types of flour, including corn flour (&quot;masa&quot;), cassava, wheat, and so on. Glutinous rice figures prominently in two main subtypes of &quot;kakanin&quot;: the &quot;puto&quot; (steamed rice cakes), and the &quot;bibingka&quot; (baked rice cakes). Both largely utilize glutinous rice &quot;galapong&quot;. A notable variant of &quot;puto&quot; is &quot;puto bumbong&quot;, which is made with &quot;pirurutong&quot;.

Other &quot;kakanin&quot; that use glutinous rice include &quot;suman&quot;, &quot;biko&quot;, and &quot;sapin-sapin&quot; among others. There is also a special class of boiled &quot;galapong&quot; dishes like &quot;palitaw&quot;, &quot;moche&quot;, &quot;mache&quot;, and &quot;masi&quot;. Fried &quot;galapong&quot; is also used to make various types of &quot;buchi&quot;, which are the local Chinese-Filipino versions of &quot;jian dui&quot;. They are also used to make &quot;puso&quot;, which are boiled rice cakes in woven leaf pouches.

Aside from &quot;kakanin&quot;, glutinous rice is also used in traditional Filipino rice gruels or porridges known as &quot;lugaw&quot;. They include both savory versions like &quot;arroz caldo&quot; or &quot;goto&quot; which are similar to Chinese-style congee; and dessert versions like &quot;champorado&quot;, &quot;binignit&quot;, and &quot;ginataang mais&quot;.

===Thailand===
In Thailand, glutinous rice is known as &quot;khao niao&quot; (; lit. &#x27;sticky rice&#x27;) in central Thailand and Isan, and as &quot;khao nueng&quot; (; lit. &#x27;steamed rice&#x27;) in northern Thailand. Sticky rice at the table is typically served individually in a small woven basket (, ).

*Steamed glutinous rice is one of the main ingredients in making the sour-fermented pork skinless sausage called &quot;naem&quot;, or its northern Thai equivalent &quot;chin som&quot;, which can be made from pork, beef, or water buffalo meat. It is also essential for the fermentation process in the northeastern Thai sausage called &quot;sai krok Isan&quot;. This latter sausage is made, in contrast to the first two, with a sausage casing.
*Sweets and desserts: Famous among tourists in Thailand is &quot;khao niao mamuang&quot; (): sweet coconut sticky rice with mango, while &quot;khao niao tat&quot;, sweet sticky rice with coconut cream and black beans, &quot;Khao niao na krachik&quot; (), sweet sticky rice topped with caramelized roasted grated coconut, &quot;khao niao kaeo&quot;, sticky rice cooked in coconut milk and sugar and &quot;khao tom hua ngok&quot;, sticky rice steamed with banana with grated coconut and sugar, are traditional popular desserts.
*&quot;Khao lam&quot; () is sticky rice with sugar and coconut cream cooked in specially prepared bamboo sections of different diameters and lengths. It can be prepared with white or dark purple (&quot;khao niao dam&quot;) varieties of glutinous rice. Sometimes a few beans or nuts are added and mixed in. Thick &quot;khao lam&quot; containers may have a custard-like filling in the centre made with coconut cream, egg and sugar.
*&quot;Khao chi&quot; () are cakes of sticky rice having the size and shape of a patty and a crunchy crust. In order to prepare them, the glutinous rice is laced with salt, often also lightly coated with beaten egg, and grilled over a charcoal fire. They were traditionally made with leftover rice and given in the early morning to the children, or to passing monks as an offering.
*&quot;Khao niew tua dum&quot; is a sticky with sugar, thickened coconut milk and black beans.
*&quot;Khao pong&quot; () is a crunchy preparation made of leftover steamed glutinous rice that is pounded and pressed into thin sheets before being grilled.
*&quot;Khao tom mat&quot; (), cooked sticky rice mixed with banana and wrapped in banana leaf, &quot;khao ho&quot;, sticky rice moulded and wrapped in a conical shape, &quot;khao pradap din&quot;, &quot;kraya sat&quot; and &quot;khao thip&quot; are preparations based on glutinous rice used as offerings in religious festivals and ceremonies for merit-making or warding off evil spirits.
*&quot;Khao niao ping&quot; (), sticky rice mixed with coconut milk and taro (&quot;khao niao ping pheuak&quot;), banana (&quot;khao niao ping kluai&quot;) or black beans (&quot;khao niao ping tua&quot;), wrapped in banana leaf and grilled slowly over a charcoal fire. Glutinous rice is traditionally eaten using the right hand
*&quot;Khao khua&quot; (), roasted ground glutinous rice, is indispensable for making the northeastern Thai dishes &quot;larb&quot;, &quot;nam tok&quot;, and &quot;nam chim chaeo&quot;. Some recipes also ask for &quot;khao khua&quot; in certain northern Thai curries. It imparts a nutty flavour to the dishes in which it is used.
*&quot;Naem khluk&quot; (&quot;Thai&quot;: ยำแหนม) or &quot;yam naem khao thot&quot; is a salad made from crumbled deep-fried, curried-rice croquettes, and &quot;naem&quot; sausage
*&quot;Chin som mok&quot; is a northern Thai speciality made with grilled, banana leaf-wrapped pork skin that has been fermented with glutinous rice
*&quot;Sai krok Isan&quot;: grilled, fermented pork sausages, a speciality of northeastern Thailand
*Glutinous rice is also used as the basis for the brewing of &quot;sato&quot; (), an alcoholic beverage also known as &quot;Thai rice wine&quot;.

<text>The University of King&#x27;s College is a public liberal arts university in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Established in 1789, it is the oldest chartered university in Canada, and the oldest English-speaking university in the Commonwealth outside the United Kingdom. The university is regarded for its Foundation Year Program (FYP), an undergraduate curriculum designed to comprehensively study a variety of intellectual developments—past and present—through great books and ideas. It is also known for its upper-year interdisciplinary programs, particularly in contemporary studies, early modern studies, and the history of science and technology. In addition, the university has a journalism school that attracts students from across the world for its intensive graduate programs in journalism, writing, and publishing.

The university was founded by royal charter in Windsor, Nova Scotia as the &quot;King&#x27;s Collegiate School&quot; in 1788, but the school moved to its current location in Halifax after a fire destroyed a large portion of the original university in 1920. The relocation was made possible with the help of Dalhousie University, which has since maintained a joint Faculty of Arts and Sciences with King&#x27;s. As a result, this has provided students at King&#x27;s with full access to Dalhousie’s facilities and services. Furthermore, students from King’s and Dalhousie can enroll in courses offered at either institution as both campuses are located adjacent to each other. Despite this academic partnership, the University of King&#x27;s College remains independent under its own charter.

==History==

===Late 18th century and 19th century===
As part of Evacuation Day, Bishop Charles Inglis, the rector of Trinity Church, led the flight of Loyalists to Windsor, Nova Scotia. In 1788, the resettled Anglican loyalists founded the King&#x27;s Collegiate School in Windsor and named it for King George III of Great Britain. In the following year, the University of King&#x27;s College emerged from the collegiate while an act was passed for &quot;the permanent establishment and effectual support of a college at Windsor,&quot; and £400 per annum was granted towards its maintenance. The college opened in 1790, and received a royal charter from King George III in 1802, becoming Canada&#x27;s first English-speaking, degree-granting university. Even though the University of New Brunswick traces its history to another King&#x27;s College, this one at Fredericton, established in 1785, it did not initially receive degree-granting powers through a Royal Charter until 1827. Similarly, McGill University traces its origins to 1801 but did not receive a Royal Charter until 1821.
Windsor was chosen as the location of the college, as it was described at the time as &quot;a cherished semi-rural retreat for generations of Nova Scotians.&quot; Prior to European settlement, the Mi&#x27;kmaq occupied the land, called &quot;Pesaquid,&quot; for more than 10,000 years. In the 16th century, the land was taken from the Mi&#x27;kmaq by French colonists, who then named the area Pisiguit as part of the colony of Acadia. British colonists later took over the land from the French, as part of a larger conflict in the Seven Years&#x27; War. The founders of King&#x27;s College, representing the political and financial elite of these British colonists, had only been in the area since the 1750s, with the construction of Fort Edward and the expulsion of the Acadians, beginning in 1755.

A significant reason for the establishment of King&#x27;s College was to discourage white, Anglican colonial males from studying in the United States, so as to guard against the influence of American Republicanism and maintain loyalty to the British Crown. The founding of a College or Seminary of learning on a liberal plan in that province [Nova Scotia] where youth may receive a virtuous education and can be qualified for the learned professions, is, we humbly conceive, a member of great consequence, as it would diffuse religious literature, loyalty, and good morals among His Majesty&#x27;s subjects there.

If such a seminary is not established the inhabitants will have no means of educating their sons at home, but will be under the but will necessity of sending them for that purpose either to Great Britain…or else some of the states of this continent, where they will soon imbibe principles that are unfavourable to the British Constitution.On this, the Archbishop of Nova Scotia and a founder of the college, Charles Inglis, was quite clear:...one of the principle motives for pushing [the college] forward was to prevent the importation of American Divines and American politics into the province. Unless we have a seminary here, the youth of Nova Scotia will be sent for their education to the Revolted Colonies—the inevitable consequences would be a corruption of their religious and political principle.Maintaining British English as the dominant language in the colony was another significant reason for the college, as was made clear by the college&#x27;s founders:A very principal object of the new institution would be accomplished by assimilating the manner of the rising generation to those of the parent state . . . to teach the genuine use, practice and pronunciation of the English language, which in distant colonies is apt to degenerate, and that the purity of the language, undebased by local or national accents and solecisms, is undeniably to be found in the Kingdom of England.These ideas continued during the development and appointments of the college&#x27;s board, principals, and faculty. Influence in the development of the college came from the highest levels, both in Nova Scotia, including the first Bishop of Nova Scotia, and in England, through the Archbishop of Canterbury, and King George III. The first Board of Governors include the colony&#x27;s Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Chief Justice, the Secretary of the colony, the Speaker of the House of Assembly, the Attorney General, and the Solicitor General.

The university was modelled on older English universities which were generally residential, tutorial, and closely tied to the Church of England. Only white, British males could attend the college, and with its Anglican affiliation, these students, during the 19th century, were required to adhere to the 39 Articles of the Anglican Church. As a result, significant groups were barred from attending, including the Mi&#x27;kmaq, Francophones, Roman Catholics, other Protestant sects, and enslaved peoples, including those owned by the founders of the town of Windsor.

==== Other facts ====
Upon discovering the chalice and paten of St. Peter&#x27;s Anglican Church (West LaHave, Nova Scotia) were being sold in Halifax, Senator William Johnston Almon purchased them and donated them to the King&#x27;s College Chapel (1891). The chalice is reported to be the oldest Anglican chalice in Canada, dated to c. 1663.

The Town of Windsor assert that students at King&#x27;s College invented ice hockey c. 1800 on Long Pond adjacent to the campus. (A similar game developed, perhaps independently, in Kingston, Ontario several years later which has led to occasional confusion about the sport&#x27;s origins.)

The noted Canadian poet Sir Charles G. D. Roberts taught at King&#x27;s College from 1885 to 1895.

===Early and mid-20th century===

On February 5, 1920, a fire consumed many of the university’s buildings. Although the cause of the blaze is still unknown, legend states it was caused by students playing with matches in a dormitory. Due to frozen fire hydrants at the time of the event, the blaze could not be put out and a majority of the 28-hectare campus burned to the ground.

In 1922, the Carnegie Foundation offered a conditional grant to rebuild King&#x27;s College. Among the provisions were that King&#x27;s College was to be rebuilt in Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, and that it was to enter into an association with Dalhousie University. The partnership required King&#x27;s to pay the salaries of select Dalhousie professors, who, in return, would help manage King&#x27;s College. In addition, students at King&#x27;s would be permitted to study at Dalhousie, while Dalhousie students would be permitted to study at King&#x27;s with the exception of divinity; the granting of all other degrees outlined in the 1802 charter was to be temporarily halted. The conditions were in hope that one day all of Nova Scotia&#x27;s universities would merge into a single body, much like the University of Toronto. As consolidation was a way to strengthen a small and financially insecure institution, King&#x27;s College accepted the funding and relocated to the northwest corner of Dalhousie&#x27;s Studley Campus, at the intersection of Oxford Street and Coburg Road. Alongside the move, the institution renamed itself “University of King&#x27;s College”. Other universities in Halifax similarly did not follow through with the Carnegie Foundation&#x27;s merger plan.

In the formative years of King&#x27;s College, many more types of degrees were offered than the institution offers today; for example, the University of New Brunswick Faculty of Law traces its history to the &quot;King&#x27;s College Law School&quot; that was established in 1892 by King&#x27;s College (in Windsor). While the University of King&#x27;s College has never lost nor relinquished interest in these granting powers, they are held in abeyance due to agreements with the University of King&#x27;s College&#x27;s partner, Dalhousie University, as part of the agreement to allow the portion of Dalhousie&#x27;s campus to be used by the University of King&#x27;s College. In addition, professional education in the 19th century expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law, and medicine — thus, graduate training based on the German model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced at the school.

In 1923, the former site of King&#x27;s College in Windsor was designated a National Historic Site.

When World War II broke out, King&#x27;s was requisitioned by the military for the training of naval officers between 1941 and 1945. King&#x27;s functioned as a &quot;stone frigate&quot;, providing a facility for navigation training before officers were sent to their ships. This role is highlighted in the 1943 Hollywood feature film, &quot;Corvette K-225&quot;, a part of which was filmed on the University campus. The academic life of the College carried on during those years elsewhere in Halifax, aided by Dalhousie University and the United Church&#x27;s Pine Hill Divinity Hall. In reflection of this naval past, the student bar on campus is known as the HMCS King&#x27;s Wardroom, often referred to as &quot;The Wardroom&quot; or &quot;The Wardy&quot;.

During the war, the Germans would occasionally broadcast names of Allied ships they had sunk. As ships had to keep radio silence, these reports could not be verified, and it was suspected that many were false. Allies circulated lists of non-active ships in the hopes of feeding the Germans misinformation; when the Germans broadcast that they had sunk HMCS &quot;King&#x27;s,&quot; their ruse was exposed.

After the war, the campus was returned to the University. The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.

===Late 20th century and 21st century===
Until the spring of 1971, the university granted graduate theological degrees as well as undergraduate degrees. In the same year, the Faculty of Divinity was moved to Pine Hill, where it was formally amalgamated into the Atlantic School of Theology, an ecumenical venture with the United Church of Canada and the Roman Catholic Church. While this new institution now grants its own degrees, King&#x27;s holds in abeyance its rights to grant divinity credentials and still continues to grant annual honorary degrees.

In 1972, King&#x27;s faculty and alumni created the Foundation Year Program, a first-year great books course that would count for four of a student&#x27;s five first-year credits. The program consisted of six sections from The Ancient World to The Contemporary World, in which students would read the work of major philosophers, poets, historians and scientists, receive lectures from a range of experts in all these areas, write critical papers and engage in small-group discussion and tutorials. The program initially had 30 students; it now draws almost 300 a year, most of whom live in residence on campus. Many of those who taught in the program in its early days were colleagues and students of the philosopher James Doull, who exercised a considerable degree of influence on the program in its formative stages. In 1989, Doull was awarded an honorary doctorate by the university.

In 1977, King&#x27;s introduced two Bachelor of Journalism programs: a four-year honours degree and a one-year compressed degree for students who already hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

In 1989, a campus library building was erected to commemorate the bicentennial of the university. It replaced a smaller library in the Arts and Administration building. The library has won numerous architectural awards. In 2000, the same architect designed the school&#x27;s New Academic Building. In 2001, additional residence rooms were added in the basement of Alexandra Hall to accommodate some of the new students. Residence can currently accommodate 274 students, and nearly all on-campus living spaces are reserved for FYP students, though some spaces are reserved for upper-year students. All buildings on the present campus are celebrated reconstructions and derivations of the buildings of the original 1789 campus in Windsor, Nova Scotia. A system of tunnels connects the residences to the other buildings of the campus, a feature particularly common to North American universities.

The King&#x27;s Library houses an impressive collection not only of rare Anglican church documents, but also a vast collection of original artwork, Renaissance and medieval books, and extensive archival material of relevance both to the history of Nova Scotia and the university. It also has some ancient artifacts, along with the Weldon Collection of fine imported china. Many of the rare books stem from the original, private collection of university founder, Charles Inglis. Recently, the blueprints for the buildings of the current campus were consulted in the library to restore the famed cupola crowning the A&amp;A Building to its original 1920s condition.

In 1993, King&#x27;s created the Contemporary Studies program. In 1999, King&#x27;s launched the Early Modern Studies program. In 2000, King&#x27;s commenced the History of Science and Technology program. Each of these programs can constitute one component of a jointly conferred combined honours degree with Dalhousie. The Upper Year Program, like the Foundation Year Program, place a strong emphasis on historical contextualized, interdisciplinary study as opposed to traditional university departmentalization.

Today, there are over 1,000 students at King&#x27;s, which represents significant growth over enrolment in the 1960s and 1970s. Its first-year class is made up mainly of Foundation Year Program students. In 2001, the FYP class was 274 students, with slightly over a hundred of these students coming from Ontario. The growing number of students from out of province reflects King&#x27;s growing academic reputation and its transformation from a small, local college to a nationally acclaimed university. However, King&#x27;s maintains strong ties to its host city and province and the number of Nova Scotians attending King&#x27;s rose 23 per cent between 1994 and 2004.

The largest ever FYP class was in 2004 with 309 students. However, the administration has resolved to cap future classes at just under 300. With improved retention rates, the school&#x27;s population looks to stabilize at around 1,200 in future years. The number of students leaving after first year has dropped significantly since the introduction of the upper year inter-disciplinary programs.

King&#x27;s&#x27; transformation from a small college catering mainly to local Anglican students into a more intellectually cosmopolitan university with a strong national profile has been a resounding success. In terms of teaching quality, King&#x27;s has been placed in the same academic league as top Canadian research universities like McGill and Toronto. One recent academic commentator summed up King&#x27;s growing renown for its quality of teaching and eccentric student culture by remarking &quot;If there is a Harvard of the North, it’s more likely King’s than McGill — although a better analogy would be a cross between Harry Potter’s Hogwarts and Camp Wanapitei in Temagami.&quot; The new programs, combined with a rigorous set of academic expectations and a cooperative academic culture, have proven a hit with high achieving high school students. Conservative estimates put the entrance average of first year King&#x27;s students at 87%, or a strong A in Canadian high school marks.

In October 2003, Dr. William Barker was installed as president and vice-chancellor, replacing Dr. Colin Starnes. Dr. Barker and the rest of the university administration have declared that King&#x27;s has grown as much as it can and should. They describe the coming years as &quot;a time of consolidation&quot;, with a focus on retention and development of new programs.

The university&#x27;s growth has changed some King&#x27;s traditions. Formal meals, with Latin grace and academic gowns, formerly held at regular intervals, were suspended from 2001 until 2003. Only with the arrival of Dr. Barker were they reinstated. They now take place on the first Wednesday of every month.

In July 2006, the King&#x27;s Student Union founded the King&#x27;s Co-op Bookstore; it stocks every title on the FYP Reading List, as well as all necessary books for King&#x27;s other courses and a number of Dalhousie courses and general interest fiction and non-fiction. The bookstore is a student-owned co-operative which functions separately from both the student union and the university.

King&#x27;s College administration has not avoided controversy. After the Sodexo cleaning staff unionized in 2004, the housekeeping contract was awarded to a different company during the summer. The King&#x27;s Student Union had been involved in encouraging the workers to unionize in order to improve their working conditions, and there were strenuous objections to the awarding of the new contract.

The University of King’s College&#x27;s arms were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on August 15, 2007.

==Academics==

Since 1972, King&#x27;s has been offering its Foundation Year Program (FYP) for undergraduate students, an intensive survey course of history, philosophy, and literature in the Western tradition. The core texts program has been described by the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada as having &quot;a national reputation for excellence as an alternative first-year of undergraduate studies&quot;, and is regarded as a prototype for similar liberal arts programs elsewhere. The Canadian news magazine Maclean&#x27;s likewise reflected this view in a discussion of small, specialized undergraduate programs in Canada, expressing &quot;it&#x27;s unlikely that any of the other programs would exist if not for the Foundation Year at King&#x27;s&quot;. In 2008 and 2009, the FYP program was ranked first in Canada by the National Survey of Student Engagement.

King&#x27;s students take the FYP in their first year, then choose a specific degree program to pursue in their final three years. Furthermore, the college offers First-Year Interest Groups (FIGs), which are small study groups meant to supplement student learning in the FYP as well as the individual’s academic interests; these are open to students from any program and generally consist of tutorials, study sessions, and social events. Because of King’s affiliation with Dalhousie, it is common for students at King&#x27;s to take some classes for their major and/or minor through Dalhousie University. With the exception of the journalism program, King&#x27;s students graduate with joint degrees from both institutions. King&#x27;s students are also eligible to complete these degrees in any subject from Dalhousie&#x27;s Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences or Faculty of Science.

The specialized &quot;Contemporary Studies Program&quot; (CSP), the &quot;Early Modern Studies Program&quot; (EMSP), and the &quot;History of Science and Technology Program&quot; (HOST) are offered jointly with Dalhousie University as combined honours degrees requiring a second honours discipline. If the students decide to do a King&#x27;s subject as their primary honours subject, they are required to write an honours thesis, varying in length from program to program. A Bachelor of Journalism program is offered as either a four-year honours degree or an intensive one-year program to students already holding a bachelor&#x27;s degree. King&#x27;s College and Dalhousie University also jointly offer a 10-month Master of Journalism program and a two-year limited residency Master of Fine Arts degree in Creative Nonfiction program.

==Student life==

===Traditions===
Once every two months, formal meals are held. Students wearing traditional academic gowns are led into the meal hall by a bagpiper. Once they have found their seat, a Latin grace is said. Afterwards, the catered meal begins. These meals were formerly held at regular intervals, but were suspended from 2001 until 2003. They were reinstated during the presidency of William Barker at his behest.

The UKing&#x27;s Literary Society (formerly the Haliburton Society), a student-run literary society, has hosted discussions concerning poetry and prose since 1884. The society remains the longest-standing university literary society throughout the Commonwealth of Nations and North America. The society took its original name from the Canadian politician Thomas Chandler Haliburton. It adopted its current name in 2020, as a result of a long-standing controversy over Haliburton&#x27;s pro-slavery views.

===Residence===
The residences are built in the Georgian style typical of the original campus. Each &quot;bay&quot;, as the original residences were termed in Windsor, is modelled on the system of &#x27;staircases&#x27; at England&#x27;s Oxford University. Each has also been named with a seemingly ironic moniker: North Pole Bay sits atop the university&#x27;s boiler rooms, and is arguably the warmest location on campus; Chapel Bay is named after the campus chapel, but is located the furthest distance from it; Radical Bay originally housed the refined, quiet divinity students; Middle Bay, which was named for its location as it is between Chapel and Radical, is named ironically as being the only non-ironic name; in addition, there is Cochran Bay, named after the first president of the College, William Cochran, and is the closest to the campus chapel.

Often residence-wide parties, known as &#x27;bay parties,&#x27; occurred, but were cancelled for in 2003. However, there was a brief a revival during the 2005-2006 school year, with both Radical Bay and Cochran Bay hosting several highly successful events. In place of this tradition, each Bay now organizes a themed-event on campus during different times of the school year.

Another consequence of increased enrolment has been a more unbalanced composition of the residences. Traditionally, students from all years of study have lived in residence, but increasingly, very few upper year students continue to live on campus, thus making way for more first years. In 2006, Alexandra Hall, traditionally the all-women&#x27;s residence, was made co-ed for the first time with rooms in the basement alternating between male and female occupants as well as one wing of the first floor becoming all-male. In addition, two of the five bays were re-converted to co-ed living spaces in 2006.

=== Tuition ===
The current Arts tuition for a full, 15-credit hour semester at the University of King&#x27;s College is $3,541.20 CAD. This cost is subject to change from semester to semester. A single, 3-credit hour course in Winter 2023 was reimbursed to students at the cost of $819.75 CAD.

There are separate fees for student services, residence, and meal plans. Some of these are not required to be paid by all students. The following table are the Fall 2023/2024 costs for a domestic student taken from the Dalhousie Online portal &#x27;Student Records - Account Detail by Term.&quot; 

International students pay higher prices, with one student paying a sum total of $35,348.14 for the Fall 2022/Winter 2023 Semester while living in the North Pole Bay residence.

===Annual events===

====Alex Fountain Memorial Lecture====
Since 2011, an annual memorial lecture is given by an individual chosen each year by the student body. After a nomination process at the beginning of the winter semester, a long list of twenty is narrowed to a short list of ten by student election. The short list is then prioritized by a student committee, which includes the program directors and president. The lecture is free, open to the public, and concludes in a question and answer period. Previous lecturers and lectures include Michaëlle Jean on &#x27;Building Social Change Locally and Globally&#x27;, Charles Taylor on &#x27;Is Democracy in Danger?&#x27;, Michael Ondaatje on &#x27;Mongrel art: A discussion of literature and its neighbours&#x27;, Jan Zwicky on &#x27;What Meaning Is and Why It Matters&#x27;, and Tanya Tagaq on &#x27;Climate, culture, and collaboration&#x27;, as well as Canadian author Joseph Boyden.

The event is held in memorial after Alex Fountain, a student who died by suicide on 22 August 2009 at the age of 20. His family donated $1 million to the mental health program at the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, as well as additional contributions to other mental health programs at Dalhousie University, the IWK Health Centre and Capital Health. In addition, they founded the lecture series.

===Athletics===
King&#x27;s is a member of the Atlantic Colleges Athletic Association (ACAA). The Varsity athletics teams at the University of King&#x27;s College are named the Blue Devils. Sporting teams include men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, soccer, badminton and rugby, and women&#x27;s volleyball.

<doc id="210019" wikidata="Q127080" url="?curid=210019" title="Edward Kelley">
<text>Sir Edward Kelley or Kelly, also known as Edward Talbot (; 1 August 1555 – 1597/8), was an English Renaissance occultist and scryer. He is known for working with John Dee in his magical investigations. Besides the professed ability to see spirits or angels in a &quot;shew-stone&quot; or mirror, which John Dee so valued, Kelley also said that he possessed the secret of transmuting base metals into gold, a goal of alchemy, as well as the philosopher&#x27;s stone itself.

Legends began to surround Kelley shortly after his death. His flamboyant biography, his relationships with Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s royal magus Sir John Dee and Emperor Rudolf II, and his repute of having great alchemical skill and the ability to communicate with angels have all led to his relative notoriety among historians.

==Biography==

===Birth and early career===
Much of Kelley&#x27;s early life is obscure. He said he was descended from the family of Ui Maine in Ireland. He was born at Worcester on 1 August 1555, at 4 P.M. according to a horoscope that John Dee drew up (based on notes Dee kept in his almanac/diary). His sister Elizabeth was born in 1558, and he had a brother Thomas who later joined him in Dee&#x27;s household. However, much of Kelley&#x27;s life before meeting John Dee is not known. He may have studied at Oxford under the name of Talbot; whether or not he attended university, Kelly was educated and knew Latin and possibly some Greek by the time he met Dee.

Anthony à Wood records in &quot;Athenae Oxoniensis&quot; that Kelley, &quot;being about 17 years of age, at which time he attained to a competency of Grammar learning at Worcester and elsewhere, was sent to Oxford, but to what house I cannot tell. However, I have been informed by an ancient Bachelor of Divinity who in his younger years had been an Amanuensis to Mr Thomas Allen of Gloucester-hall, that he (Kelly) had spent some time in that House; whereupon I, recurring to the matriculation, could not find the name Kelly, only Talbot of Ireland, three of which name were students there in 1573, 74, &amp;c... This relation being somewhat dubiously delivered to me, I must tell you that Kelly having an unsettled mind, left Oxford abruptly, without being entitled into the matricula.&quot; According to some accounts, Kelley was pilloried in Lancaster for forgery or counterfeiting. Both his ears were supposedly cropped, a common punishment during the Tudor Dynasty. He usually wore a cap on his head, and it was thought this was to hide his lack of ears. John Weever says, &quot;Kelly (otherwise called Talbot) that famous English alchemist of our times, who flying out of his own country (after he had lost both his ears at Lancaster) was entertained with Rudolf the second, and last of that Christian name, Emperor of Germany.&quot;

===With Dee in England===
Kelley approached John Dee in 1582. Dee had already been trying to contact angels with the help of a &quot;scryer&quot;, or crystal-gazer, but he had not been successful. Kelley professed the ability to do so, and impressed Dee with his first trial. Kelley became Dee&#x27;s regular scryer or medium. Dee and Kelley devoted huge amounts of time and energy to these &quot;spiritual conferences&quot;. From 1582 to 1589, Kelley&#x27;s life was closely tied to Dee&#x27;s. In those seven years, they conducted conferences or seances, including &quot;prayers for enlightenment... in the spirit of Dee&#x27;s ecumenical hopes that alchemy and angelic knowledge would heal the rift of Christendom&quot;. Dee also believed that the angels held knowledge that would aid the English in their discoveries of new and uncharted lands on Earth.

Kelley married a widow, Jane (or Joanna) Cooper of Chipping Norton (1563–1606). He helped educate her two children: the girl, future poet Westonia, later described him as a &#x27;kind stepfather&#x27; and noted how he took her in after the deaths of her two grandmothers. Kelley had also hired a Latin tutor for her, named John Hammond (Johannes Hammonius in Latin).

About a year after entering into Dee&#x27;s service, Kelley appeared with an alchemical book (&quot;The Book of Dunstan&quot;) and a quantity of a red powder which, Kelley said, he and a certain John Blokley had been led to by a &quot;spiritual creature&quot; at Northwick Hill. (Accounts of Kelley&#x27;s finding the book and the powder in the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey were first published by Elias Ashmole, but are contradicted by Dee&#x27;s diaries.) With the powder (whose secret was presumably hidden in the book) Kelley believed he could prepare a red &quot;tincture&quot; which would allow him to transmute base metals into gold. He reportedly demonstrated its power a few times over the years, including in Bohemia (present Czech Republic) where he and Dee resided for many years.

===With Dee on the Continent===
In 1583, Dee became acquainted with Olbracht Łaski, a Polish nobleman interested in alchemy. In September of that year, Dee, Kelley, and their families left England with Łaski for the Continent. Dee sought the patronage of Emperor Rudolf II in Prague and King Stefan I of Poland in Kraków; Dee apparently failed to impress either monarch enough to earn a permanent station. Dee and Kelley lived a nomadic life in Central Europe, meanwhile continuing their spiritual conferences. While Kelley was apparently more interested in alchemy than in scrying, Dee seemed more interested in making contact with the angels. Kelley&#x27;s supposed value was as a medium, as only he was able to understand and scribe their language. According to those close to Dee (particularly his son Arthur) there was no little tension between the two men and their families as they journeyed through Europe.

Kelley and Dee&#x27;s involvement in necromancy eventually caught the attention of the Catholic Church, and on 27 March 1587 they were required to defend themselves in a hearing with the papal nuncio, Germanico Malaspina, bishop of San Severo. Dee handled the interview with tact, but Kelley is said to have infuriated the nuncio by stating that one of the problems with the Catholic Church is the &quot;poor conduct of many of the priests.&quot; The nuncio noted in a letter that he was tempted to toss Kelley out of the window (defenestration was a somewhat common tradition in Prague at the time).

In 1586, Kelley and Dee found the patronage of the wealthy Bohemian Lord William of Rosenberg, a senior official from a powerful family who also shared Kelley and Dee&#x27;s alchemical interests and is known to have participated in spiritual sessions with the two men. Kelley and Dee settled in the town of Třeboň and continued their research there (in Dee&#x27;s journal, he states &quot;Oct. 26th, Mr. Edward Kelly came to Trebona from Prage&quot;), and according to Dee&#x27;s diary it was during this time that Kelley is said to have performed his first alchemical transmutation (on 19 December 1586). Kelley&#x27;s skilled draughtsmanship is evident in the notes taken by Dee during certain séances (these notes are available in Dee&#x27;s Book of Enoch). These notes show Kelley&#x27;s initial commitment to the alchemists&#x27; mutual goal. However, he soon began to waver and expressed a desire to stop. Dee insisted that they continue. In 1587, possibly as an act to sever the sessions, Kelley revealed to Dee that the angels (namely a spirit &quot;Madimi&quot;) had ordered them to share everything they had, including their wives. Dee, anguished by the &quot;order&quot; of the angels, subsequently broke off the spiritual conferences. He did, however, share his wife. This &quot;cross-matching&quot; occurred on 22 May 1588 and is noted in John Dee&#x27;s diary: &quot;May 22nd, Mistris Kelly received the sacrament, and to me and my wife gave her hand in charity; and we rushed not from her.&quot;

Though it seems the two shared an intimate and often cooperative partnership, it was often characterised as &quot;quarrelsome&quot; and &quot;tense&quot; by contemporaries and historians. Also they were clearly involved in activities that could be seen as heretical to the Catholic Church of the time, so a certain amount of tact and secrecy was required. Kelly left Dee at Třeboň in 1589, possibly to join the emperor&#x27;s court at Prague. Dee returned to England. They did not see each other again.

The manuscript collector Karl Widemann from Augsburg was between 1587 and 1588 his secretary at the court of Rudolf II, and also worked for the Rosenberg family in Třeboň.

===Apogee and fall===
In England in 1588 rumours circulated that Kelley was arrested by the Emperor for falsely advertising that he could transmute base metals to gold, a skill that Queen Elizabeth could employ. William Cecil wrote to Edward Dyer, an English diplomat, inviting Kelly to return to England and the queen&#x27;s service.

In October 1590 one of his associates, Ralph Lacy, a recusant from Yorkshire, arrived at the court of James VI of Scotland from Prague. He had served the king&#x27;s grandfather, the Earl of Lennox. The English ambassador Robert Bowes was suspicious of him, and persuaded James VI to send him back.

By 1590 Kelley was living an opulent lifestyle in Europe, enjoying the patronage of nobility: he received several estates and large sums of money from Rosenberg. Meanwhile, he continued his alchemical experiments until he had convinced Rudolf II that he was ready to start producing gold, the purpose of his work. Rudolf knighted him Sir Edward Kelley of Imany and New Lüben on 23 February 1590 (but it is possible that this happened in 1589). In May 1591, Rudolf had Kelley arrested and imprisoned in the Křivoklát Castle outside Prague, supposedly for killing an official named Jiri Hunkler in a duel; it is possible that he also did not want Kelley to escape before he had actually produced any gold. In 1595, Kelly agreed to co-operate and return to his alchemical work; he was released and restored to his former status. When he failed to produce any gold, he was again imprisoned, this time in Hněvín Castle in Most. His wife and stepdaughter attempted to hire an imperial counselor who might free Kelley from imprisonment, but he died a prisoner in late 1597/early 1598 of injuries received while attempting to escape. However, according to the account of Simon Tadeáš, Rudolf II&#x27;s geologist, he poisoned himself in front of his wife and children.

In 1674, Sir Thomas Browne, an acquaintance of John Dee&#x27;s son Arthur Dee, in correspondence to Elias Ashmole, stated that &quot;Arthur Dee said also that Kelley dealt not justly by his father, and that afterwards imprisoned by the Emperor in a castle, from whence attempting an escape down the wall, he fell and broke his leg and was imprisoned again.&quot;

A few of Kelley&#x27;s writings are extant today, including two alchemical verse treatises in English, and three other treatises, which he dedicated to Rudolf II from prison. They were entitled &quot;Tractatus duo egregii de lapide philosophorum una cum theatro astronomiae&quot; (1676). The treatises have been translated as &quot;The Alchemical Writings of Edward Kelley&quot; (1893).

==Angelical, the &quot;Enochian&quot; language==
Kelley believed that angels communicated to him in a special language termed &#x27;Angelical&#x27;, subsequently called Enochian, which he then relayed to Dee. Some modern cryptographers argue that Kelley invented it (see for example the introduction to &quot;The Complete Enochian Dictionary&quot; by Donald Laycock). Some say that this was all a farce, but are not clear whether Dee was a victim or an accomplice. Because of this precedent, and of a dubious connection between the Voynich Manuscript and John Dee (through Roger Bacon), Kelley has been suspected of having fabricated that book too, to swindle Rudolf.

Kelley said that Angelical was dictated by angels who he saw and heard by means scrying in a crystal ball or mirror. He also described the angels as communicating by means of tapping out letters displayed in a rectangular tablet. The first third were tapped out with each Angelical word backwards; the following two-thirds with each word forwards. There are no significant errors or discrepancies in word usage between the first and following parts. The English translations were not tapped out but, according to Kelley, appeared on little strips of paper coming out of the angels&#x27; mouths.

Dee considered the dictation of the Angelical material highly important for three reasons. First, Dee believed Angelical represented a documentable case of true glossolalia, thereby proving Kelley was actually speaking with angels and not from his imagination. Second, the angels communicated that their language was actually the original prototype of Hebrew: the language with which God spoke to Adam, and thus the first human word. Third, the Angelical material takes the form of a set of conjurations which would summon an extremely powerful set of angels who would reveal many secrets to those who sought them, especially the key to the philosopher&#x27;s stone, to god-like wisdom, and eternal life.

<text>The Third Geneva Convention, relative to the treatment of prisoners of war, is one of the four treaties of the Geneva Conventions. The Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War was first adopted in 1929, but significantly revised at the 1949 conference. It defines humanitarian protections for prisoners of war. There are 196 state parties to the Convention.

==Part I: General provisions ==
This part sets out the overall parameters for GCIII:

* Articles 1 and 2 cover which parties are bound by GCIII
* Article 2 specifies when the parties are bound by GCIII
** That any armed conflict between two or more &quot;High Contracting Parties&quot; is covered by GCIII;
** That it applies to occupations of a &quot;High Contracting Party&quot;;
** That the relationship between the &quot;High Contracting Parties&quot; and a non-signatory, the party will remain bound until the non-signatory no longer acts under the strictures of the convention. &quot;...Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.&quot;
* Article 3 has been called a &quot;Convention in miniature.&quot; It is the only article of the Geneva Conventions that applies in non-international conflicts. It describes minimal protections which must be adhered to by all individuals within a signatory&#x27;s territory during an &quot;armed conflict not of an international character&quot; (regardless of citizenship or lack thereof): Non-combatants, members of armed forces who have laid down their arms, and combatants who are &quot;hors de combat&quot; (out of the fight) due to wounds, detention, or any other cause &quot;shall in all circumstances be treated humanely&quot;, including prohibition of &quot;outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment.&quot; The passing of sentences must also be &quot;pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognised as indispensable by civilised peoples.&quot; Article 3&#x27;s protections exist even if one is not classified as a &quot;prisoner of war&quot;. Article 3 also states that parties to the internal conflict should &quot;endeavour to bring into force, by means of special agreements, all or part of the other provisions of&quot; GCIII.
* Article 4 defines prisoners of war to include:
**4.1.1 Members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict and members of militias of such armed forces
**4.1.2 Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organised resistance movements, provided that they fulfill all of the following conditions:
*** that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;
*** that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognisable at a distance (there are limited exceptions to this among countries who observe the 1977 Protocol I);
*** that of carrying arms openly;
*** that of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.
**4.1.3 Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognised by the Detaining Power.
**4.1.4 Civilians who have non-combat support roles with the military and who carry a valid identity card issued by the military they support.
**4.1.5 Merchant marine and the crews of civil aircraft of the Parties to the conflict, who do not benefit by more favourable treatment under any other provisions of international law.
**4.1.6 Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units, provided they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war.
** 4.3 makes explicit that Article 33 takes precedence for the treatment of medical personnel of the enemy and chaplains of the enemy.
* Article 5 specifies that prisoners of war (as defined in article 4) are protected from the time of their capture until their final repatriation. It also specifies that when there is any doubt whether a combatant belongs to the categories in article 4, they should be treated as such until their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.

==Part II: General Protection of Prisoners of War==

This part of the convention covers the status of prisoners of war.

Article 12 states that prisoners of war are the responsibility of the state, not the persons who capture them, and that they may not be transferred to a state that is not party to the Convention.

Articles 13 to 16 state that prisoners of war must be treated humanely without any adverse discrimination and that their medical needs must be met.

==Part III: Captivity==
This part is divided into several sections:

Section 1 covers the beginning of captivity (Articles 17–20). It dictates what information a prisoner must give (&quot;surname, first names and rank, date of birth, and army, regimental, personal or serial number&quot;), and interrogation methods that the detaining power may use (&quot;No physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion&quot;). It dictates what private property a prisoner of war may keep and that the prisoner of war must be evacuated from the combat zone as soon as possible.

Section 2 covers the internment of prisoners of war and is broken down into 8 chapters which cover:
#General observations (Articles 21–24)
#Quarters, food and clothing (Articles 25–28)
#Hygiene and medical attention (Articles 29–32)
#The treatment of enemy medical personnel and chaplains retained to assist prisoners of war (Article 33)
#Religious, intellectual and physical activities (Articles 34–38)
#Discipline (Articles 39–42)
#Military rank (Articles 43–45)
#Transfer of prisoners of war after their arrival in a camp (Articles 46–48)

Section 3 (Articles 49–57) covers the type of labour that a prisoner of war may be compelled to do, taking such factors as rank, age, and sex into consideration, and that which because it is unhealthy or dangerous can only be done by prisoners of war who volunteer for such work. It goes into details about such things as the accommodation, medical facilities, and that even if the prisoner of war works for a private person the military authority remains responsible for them. Rates of pay for work done are covered by Article 62 in the next section.

Section 4 (Articles 58–68) covers the financial resources of prisoners of war.

Section 5 (Articles 69–74) covers the relations of prisoners of war with the exterior. This covers the frequency of which a prisoner of war can send and receive post, including parcels. The Detaining power has the right to censor all mail, but must do so as quickly as possible.

Section 6 covers the relations between prisoners of war and the detaining authorities: it is broken down into three chapters.
#Complaints of prisoners of war respecting the conditions of captivity (Article 78)
#Prisoner of war representatives (Articles 79–81). Where there is no senior officer available in a camp the section stipulates that &quot;prisoners shall freely elect by secret ballot, [a representative] every six months&quot;. The representative, whether the senior officer or an elected person, acts as a conduit between the authorities of the detaining power and the prisoners.
#The sub-section on &quot;Penal and disciplinary sanctions&quot; is subdivided into three parts:
##General provisions (Articles 82–88)
##Disciplinary sanctions (Articles 89–98)
##Juridical proceedings (Articles 99–108)

==Part IV: Termination of Captivity==
This part is divided into several sections:

Section 1 (Articles 109–117) covers the direct repatriation and accommodation in neutral countries.

Section 2 (Articles 118–119) covers the release and repatriation of prisoners of war at the close of hostilities.

Section 3 (Articles 120–121) covers the death of a prisoner of war.

==Part V: Information Bureau and Relief Societies for Prisoners of War==

The Information Bureau is an organisation that must be set up by the Detaining Power to facilitate the sharing of information by the parties to conflict and neutral powers as required by the various provisions of the Third Geneva Convention. It will correspond freely with &quot;A Central Prisoners of War Information Agency ... created in a neutral country&quot; to act as a conduit with the Power to which the prisoners of war owe their allegiance. The provisions of this part are contained in Articles 122 to 125.

The central prisoners of war information agency was created within the Red Cross.

==Part VI: Execution of the Convention==
Consists of two sections.

Section 1 (Articles 126–132) General provisions.

Section 2 (Articles 133–143) Final provisions.

<text>Valentin Tomberg (February 26, 1900 – February 24, 1973) was an Estonian-Russian Christian mystic, polyglot scholar and esotericist. 

==Early life==
Valentin Tomberg was born on February 26, 1900 (February 14 in the Old Russian Julian calendar) in St. Petersburg, Russia. His parents were Lutheran, the mother was a Russian and the father of Baltic German origin, he was an official in the Tsarist government. As an adolescent, Tomberg was drawn to Theosophy and the mystical practices of Eastern Orthodoxy. In 1917, he was initiated into Hermetic Martinism by G. O. Mebes. He also discovered the works of Rudolf Steiner. In 1920, Tomberg fled with his family to Tallinn, in newly independent Estonia. Tomberg worked as a nurse at a hospital, in a pharmacy, on a farm and in the Tallinn Central Post Office. He studied languages and comparative religion at the University of Tartu in Estonia.

==Career==
In 1925, Tomberg joined Rudolf Steiner&#x27;s Anthroposophical Society. In the early 1930s he married divorcée Maria Belozwetow (née Demski) (died March 1973), a Polish Catholic; they had a son, Alexis (August 31, 1933 – 1975). During the 1930s, Tomberg, then in his 30s, published his original occult research in a number of articles and lectures, which made him a controversial figure in Anthroposophical circles. As a result of the controversies, in 1938 the Tombergs were invited to move to Amsterdam. In 1940, however, he was asked to withdraw from the Anthroposophical Society in the Netherlands as well, by its chairman Willem Zeylmans van Emmichoven (1893–1961), due to his being too controversial.

He was active in Dutch anti-Nazi resistance by hiding allied pilots and parachutists. Tomberg and a Russian friend, the poet-philosopher Nikolai Nikolaevich Bielotsvietov (Nikolaj Belozwetow) (1892–1950), allegedly approached the leader of the Christian Community, Emil Bock (1895–1959) about creating a new ritual focusing on Sophia, but were rebuffed. He then joined the Russian Orthodox Church in the Netherlands but left shortly thereafter, as its leadership turned out to be sympathetic to National Socialism.

Towards the end of World War II, Tomberg received a Ph.D. in jurisprudence from the University of Cologne, where he had moved in 1944. He studied under Ernst Arthur Franz von Hippel (1895–1984), professor of law in the University of Cologne, who became a personal friend and an anthroposophist. Tomberg&#x27;s thesis was published as &quot;Degeneration and Regeneration in the Science of Law&quot;, followed by the thesis &quot;Peoples&#x27; Rights as Humanity&#x27;s Rights&quot; in 1946. Around this time, he converted to Roman Catholicism.

Shortly after the war he helped founding a community college in the Ruhr area. In 1948, however, he moved to England, where he became a translator for the BBC, monitoring Soviet broadcasts during the Cold War at BBC Caversham Park. He retired early, in 1960, to the suburbanized village of Emmer Green, not far from Reading, where he worked on the manuscripts for his main work, written in French and entitled &quot;Méditations sur les 22 arcanes majeurs du Tarot&quot; (&quot;Meditations on the Tarot&quot; in English).

==Death==
Tomberg died on a holiday in Majorca. Two weeks later his wife and collaborator Maria died as well. A Dutch or German rough translation of the manuscript to &quot;Méditations sur les 22 arcanes majeurs du Tarot&quot; was circulated in the Netherlands against Tomberg&#x27;s intentions a year before his death, but was only formally published in 1984.

Robert A. Powell and others have reportedly identified Tomberg as the 20th century incarnation of the boddhisattva who they say will in time incarnate as the Maitreya Buddha, a claim contested by T. H. Meyer and other Anthroposophists.

==Published works==
Tomberg&#x27;s major written works were published posthumously. They include:

*&quot;Lazarus, komm heraus: vier Schriften&quot; (&quot;Come Forth, Lazarus&quot;), a study of Christian mysticism, written in German and published in 1985, . Translated as &quot;Covenant of the Heart&quot; and published in English in 1992. Also published as &quot;Lazarus, come forth! Meditations of a Christian esotericist on the mysteries of the raising of Lazarus, the Ten Commandments, the Three Kingdoms, and the Breath of Life&quot;. .
*&quot;Méditations sur les 22 arcanes majeurs du Tarot&quot; (a study of the Tarot of Marseilles) published anonymously in French in 1980 (with an afterword by a Catholic theologian and priest, Hans Urs von Balthasar). An English translation was then published in 1985, with Robert A. Powell basing his rendering on the author&#x27;s original French manuscript, whereas the published French edition () does not always follow the French original manuscript.

<doc id="210027" wikidata="Q356724" url="?curid=210027" title="Antoine Pinay">
<text>Antoine Pinay (; 30 December 1891 – 13 December 1994) was a French conservative politician who served as Prime Minister of France from 1952 to 1953 and French Foreign Minister from 1955 to 1956.

==Life==
Antoine Pinay was born on 30 December 1891 in Saint-Symphorien-sur-Coise. He was a child of Claude Pinay (5 July 1852 – 4 March 1919), and his wife, Marie Antoinette Besson (10 October 1861 – 23 November 1936).

On 25 April 1917, Pinay married Marguerite Fouletier (3 June 1895 – 3 December 1970) and had two daughters and one son, Geneviève (1918–2017), Odette (1920–2015), and Pierre (1922–1964).

As a young man, Pinay fought in World War I and injured his arm so that it was paralyzed for the rest of his life.

After the war, he managed a small business and in 1929 he was elected mayor of Saint-Chamond, Loire.

He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1936, running as an independent candidate opposed to the Popular Front. In 1938 he was elected to the Senate, where he joined the Independent Radicals. On 10 July 1940 he voted to give the Cabinet presided over by Marshal Philippe Pétain authority to draw up a new constitution, effectively ending the French Third Republic and establishing Vichy France. In 1941, Antoine Pinay was appointed to the &quot;Conseil National&quot; of the Vichy regime. He was also awarded the Order of the Francisque. During the occupation, Antoine Pinay remained mayor of Saint-Chamond, although he had been urged by General Georges to move to Algiers, in order to better protect the residents of this city. Pinay resigned from the &quot;Conseil National&quot; within a few months and refused any official position with the Vichy regime, such as the &quot;préfecture de l&#x27;Hérault&quot; offered by Laval. He also gave several hundreds of identity papers to help Jews and members of the Resistance flee from France to Algiers or Switzerland. An official commission in 1946 recognized his long lasting opposition to the Nazis and the help he gave to the Resistance and released him without charge.

In 1944, he was first placed on house arrest, and stripped of his right to be candidate to an election on 5 September 1945. After the intervention of René Cassin, the vice-president of the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot;, who pointed to his fierce opposition to the German occupation, his citizen rights were restored on 5 October 1945. On 2 June 1946, he could successfully run for election to the &quot;Assemblée Constituante&quot; as a moderate candidate.

He helped create a conservative party, the National Center of Independents and Peasants (CNIP). He acquired the reputation as one of France&#x27;s more spirited politicians and in 1952 became prime minister by virtue of being the most popular elected CNIP official. His ministry was seen as the return of the &quot;classical right&quot;, discredited since the Liberation. He stabilized the finances of the French nation and the French currency.

In 1952/53 he was one of the founders of Le Cercle Pinay, a secret invitation-only foreign policy forum for conservatives. In 1955, he was one of the participants of the Messina Conference, which would lead to the Treaty of Rome in 1957.

During the May 1958 crisis precipitated by the Algerian war, he supported Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s return to power and approved of the Fifth Republic&#x27;s constitution. He served as finance minister until 1960. In 1973, he was made &quot;médiateur de la République&quot; (ombudsman) by President Georges Pompidou.

Having died aged , he is the third longest lived national state leader in history, behind only Chau Sen Cocsal Chhum and Celâl Bayar. He died 17 days before his 103rd birthday, and was buried in Saint-Symphorien-sur-Coise. From 14 December 1990, when former Republic of China Premier Zhang Qun died until his own death, Pinay was the world&#x27;s oldest living former head of government.

<doc id="210028" wikidata="Q6886801" url="?curid=210028" title="Mobile Bay jubilee">
<text>Jubilee is the name used locally for a natural phenomenon that occurs sporadically on the shores of Mobile Bay, a large body of water on Alabama&#x27;s Gulf Coast. During a jubilee many species of crab and shrimp, as well as flounder, eels, and other demersal fish will leave deeper waters and swarm—in large numbers and very high density—in a specific, shallower coastal area of the bay. A jubilee is a celebrated event in Mobile Bay, and it attracts large crowds, many drawn by the promise of abundant and easy-to-catch seafood.

Although similar events have been reported in other bodies of water, Mobile Bay is the only place where the regular appearance of this phenomenon has been documented.

==Descriptions==

The Mobile Bay jubilee typically takes place at least annually, and sometimes several times per year; years without a jubilee have been recorded, but they are exceedingly rare. Many accounts of the jubilee exist, the oldest dating back to the 1860s.

The size, scope, and duration of the jubilee can vary greatly. Sometimes a stretch of coast representing most of the eastern shore can be affected, and at other times the extent can be limited to as little as of coastline. Smaller jubilees occur more frequently than larger ones, but can be difficult to find. Most jubilees happen in the pre-dawn hours.

Author Archie Carr comments, &quot;At a good jubilee you can quickly fill a washtub with shrimp. You can gig a hundred flounders and fill the back of your pickup truck a foot deep in crabs.&quot;

In addition, harvesting them is made considerably easier by the effect that the oxygen deprivation has on the animals. Their behavior has been described as &quot;depressed and moribund&quot;, or &quot;unnatural&quot;; crabs are observed &quot;climbing tree stumps to escape the water&quot; and flounder &quot;slither up the banks.&quot;

==Causes==
It was not until 1960 that the phenomenon was explored in-depth by marine biologist Harold Loesch for the journal &quot;Ecology&quot;. Locals and laymen had based some earlier attempts to explain the animals&#x27; strange behaviors on the interaction of sea- and fresh water during the incoming tide.

After researching the oral histories and journalistic records of past jubilees, measuring physical and meteorologic conditions, and taking biological and chemical measurements, Loesch concluded that accumulated organic material on the bay floor could, under a certain set of conditions, result in a rapid depletion of oxygen in parts of the bay, driving fish to the surface seeking oxygenated water.

Another, more comprehensive study by Edwin B. May in 1973, as well as smaller studies by the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and the NOAA confirmed many of Loesch&#x27;s hypotheses. If wind direction, surface temperature, salinity, and tidal variation interact in ways that allow or promote a jubilee, the situation can develop rather quickly. May sums up the mechanism of action thus:

==History==
While the occurrence of jubilees in Mobile Bay predates European settlement in the region, it is unknown exactly when or how these events came to be known by this name. The first recorded printed use of the term &quot;jubilee&quot; in this context was in the &quot;Mobile Daily Register&quot; (now the &quot;Mobile Press-Register&quot;) on July 29, 1912:

This was not, however, the first time the newspaper had covered the phenomenon; in his research, oceanographer Edwin B. May found several dozen mentions of similar events, the earliest dated back to July 17, 1867 and alludes to the fact that the phenomenon was known to have happened earlier:

In an oral account from 1960 a local fishing captain named Frank Phillips stated that he had observed jubilee events for the previous 60 years, indicating that &quot;[N]either [the] frequency nor intensity ... had changed&quot;. He also stated that his father had also seen jubilee events &quot;...during all his life.&quot;

==Favorable conditions, locations, and frequency==
Loesch studied jubilee events spanning 11 years, from 1946–1956, hoping to find patterns in the jubilee occurrence. From this data he was able to conclude several things.

===Month===
Over the 11-year period studied, the 37 jubilees all occurred between the months of June and September, more frequently in August than all other months combined.

===Location===
Jubilees are most common on the upper eastern shore of the bay, from Point Clear to slightly north of Daphne, but they also occur with less frequency south of Point Clear to Mullet Point, and on the Bay&#x27;s western shore at Deer River and Dog River Point south to Fowl River.

===Time of day===
Most jubilees occur in the hours immediately preceding dawn.

===Wind, rain and tide===
There is disagreement as to what, if any, effect local rainfall can have on the jubilee. Almost all jubilees occur with an incoming tide, and an easterly wind.

===Folk consensus===
Loesch lists five observations that he reported as having a strong concurrence among witnesses of several jubilees: 
# Jubilees occur only in the summer.
# They usually occur in early morning hours, &quot;i.e.&quot;, before sunrise.
# The wind on the day previous and during the jubilee is from some easterly direction. If wind direction changes, the jubilee will cease.
# There is a rising tide during a jubilee; a change to falling will stop the jubilee.
# There are two water masses meeting, with the saltier water invading during a jubilee.

==Jubilee in local culture==
The length of coast that serves as the most popular jubilee grounds is densely populated. When a jubilee is spotted people living near the shore will often ring bells and call out to alert their neighbors so that everyone can rush down to the water with washtubs, gigs and nets, and gather a bountiful—and easily reaped—harvest of seafood. As jubilees only happen on warm summer nights, often in the early pre-dawn hours, the event takes on the character of a community beach party, with lights shining into the waters of Mobile Bay.

<doc id="210031" wikidata="Q1974008" url="?curid=210031" title="Separate but equal">
<text>Separate but equal was a legal doctrine in United States constitutional law, according to which racial segregation did not necessarily violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which nominally guaranteed &quot;equal protection&quot; under the law to all people. Under the doctrine, as long as the facilities provided to each race were equal, state and local governments could require that services, facilities, public accommodations, housing, medical care, education, employment, and transportation be segregated by race, which was already the case throughout the states of the former Confederacy. The phrase was derived from a Louisiana law of 1890, although the law actually used the phrase &quot;equal but separate&quot;.

The doctrine was confirmed in the &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; Supreme Court decision of 1896, which allowed state-sponsored segregation. Though segregation laws existed before that case, the decision emboldened segregation states during the Jim Crow era, which had commenced in 1876, and supplanted the Black Codes, which restricted the civil rights and civil liberties of African Americans during the Reconstruction era.

In practice, the separate facilities provided to African Americans were rarely equal; usually they were not even close to equal, or they did not exist at all. For example, in the 1930 census, black people were 42% of Florida&#x27;s population, yet according to the 1934–1936 report of the Florida Superintendent of Public Instruction, the value of &quot;white school property&quot; in the state was $70,543,000, while the value of African American school property was $4,900,000. The report says that &quot;in a few south Florida counties and in most north Florida counties many Negro schools are housed in churches, shacks, and lodges, and have no toilets, water supply, desks, blackboards, etc. Counties use these schools as a means to get State funds and yet these counties invest little or nothing in them.&quot; At that time, high school education for African Americans was provided in only 28 of Florida&#x27;s 67 counties. In 1939–1940, the average salary of a white teacher in Florida was $1,148, whereas for a black teacher it was $585.
During the era of segregation, the myth was that the races were separated but were provided equal facilities. No one believed it. Almost without exception, black students were given inferior buildings and instructional materials. Black educators were generally paid less than their white counterparts and had more students in their classrooms... In 1938, Pompano white schools collectively had one teacher for every 25 students, while the Pompano Colored School had one teacher for every 54 students. At the Hammondville School, the single teacher employed there had 67 students.

Because new research showed that segregating students by race was harmful to them, even if facilities were equal, &quot;separate but equal&quot; facilities were found to be unconstitutional in a series of Supreme Court decisions under Chief Justice Earl Warren, starting with &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; of 1954. However, the subsequent overturning of segregation laws and practices was a long process that lasted through much of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, involving federal legislation (especially the Civil Rights Act of 1964), and many court cases.

==Background==

The American Civil War brought slavery in the United States to an end with the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865. Following the war, the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed equal protection under the law to all people, and Congress established the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau to assist in the integration of former slaves into Southern society. The Reconstruction Era brought new freedoms and laws promoting racial equality to the South. However, after the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction and withdrew federal troops from all Southern states, many former slaveholders and Confederates were elected to office. The Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed equal protection to all people but Southern states contended that the requirement of equality could be met in a way that kept the races separate. Furthermore, the state and federal courts tended to reject the pleas by African Americans that their Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated, arguing that the Fourteenth Amendment applied only to federal, not state, citizenship. This rejection is evident in the Slaughter-House Cases and Civil Rights Cases.

After the end of Reconstruction, the federal government adopted a general policy of leaving racial segregation up to the individual states. One example of this policy was the second Morrill Act (Morrill Act of 1890). Before the end of the war, the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act (Morrill Act of 1862) had provided federal funding for higher education by each state with the details left to the state legislatures. The 1890 Act implicitly accepted the legal concept of &quot;separate but equal&quot; for the 17 states that had institutionalized segregation.

Provided, That no money shall be paid out under this act to any State or Territory for the support and maintenance of a college where a distinction of race or color is made in the admission of students, but the establishment and maintenance of such colleges &quot;separately&quot; for white and colored students shall be held to be a compliance with the provisions of this act if the funds received in such State or Territory be &quot;equitably&quot; divided as hereinafter set forth.
In New York, courts repealed the local &quot;separate but equal&quot; statute in 1938 and the last school for African-American children in New York was shut down in 1944.

== Early legal support ==

===Laws===
In the late 1800s, many states of the former Confederacy adopted laws, collectively known as Jim Crow laws, that mandated separation of whites and African Americans. The Florida Constitution of 1885 and that of West Virginia mandated separate educational systems. In Texas, laws required separate water fountains, restrooms, and waiting rooms in railroad stations. In Georgia, restaurants and taverns could not serve white and &quot;colored&quot; patrons in the same room; separate parks for each race were required, as were separate cemeteries. These are just examples from a large number of similar laws.

Prior to the Second Morrill Act, 17 states excluded blacks from access to the land-grant colleges without providing similar educational opportunities. In response to the Second Morrill Act, 17 states established separate land-grant colleges for blacks which are now referred to as public historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). In fact, some states adopted laws prohibiting schools from educating blacks and whites together, even if a school was willing to do so. The constitutionality of such laws was upheld in &quot;Berea College v. Kentucky (1908)&quot; 211 U.S. 45.

===&quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;===

The legitimacy of such laws under the Fourteenth amendment was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1896 case of &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, 163 U.S. 537 (1896). The &quot;Plessy&quot; doctrine was extended to the public schools in &quot;Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education&quot;, 175 U.S. 528 (1899).

In 1892, Homer Plessy, who was of mixed ancestry and appeared to be white, boarded an all-white railroad car between New Orleans and Covington, Louisiana. The conductor of the train collected passenger tickets at their seats. When Plessy told the conductor he was white and black, he was informed that he had to move to a coloreds-only car. Plessy said he resented sitting in a coloreds-only car and was arrested immediately.

One month after his arrest, Plessy appeared in court before Judge John Howard Ferguson. Plessy&#x27;s lawyer, Albion Tourgee, claimed Plessy&#x27;s 13th and 14th amendment rights were violated. The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery, and the 14th amendment gave equal protection to all under the law.

The Supreme Court decision in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; formalized the legal principle of &quot;separate but equal&quot;. The ruling required &quot;railway companies carrying passengers in their coaches in that State to provide equal, but separate, accommodations for the white and colored races&quot;. Accommodations provided on each railroad car were required to be the same as those provided on the others. Separate railroad cars could be provided. The railroad could refuse service to passengers who refused to comply, and the Supreme Court ruled this did not infringe upon the 13th and 14th amendments.

The &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine applied in theory to all public facilities: not only railroad cars but schools, medical facilities, theaters, restaurants, restrooms, and drinking fountains. However, neither state nor Congress put &quot;separate but equal&quot; into the statute books, meaning the provision of equal services to non-whites could not be legally enforced. The only possible remedy was through federal court, but costly legal fees and expenses meant that this was out of the question for individuals; it took an organization with resources, the NAACP, to file and pursue &quot;Brown v. Board of Education.&quot;
Equal facilities were unusual. The facilities and social services offered to African Americans were almost always of a lower quality than those offered to white Americans, if they existed at all. Most African-American schools had less public funding per student than nearby white schools; they had old textbooks, discarded by the white schools, used equipment, and poorly paid, prepared, or taught and trained teachers. In addition, according to a study conducted by the American Psychological Association, black students are emotionally impaired when segregated at a young age. In Texas, the state established a state-funded law school for white students but none for black students. As previously mentioned, the majority of counties in Florida during the 1930s had no high school for African-American students. African Americans had to pay state and local taxes that were used for the benefit of whites only. (See Florida A&amp;M Hospital for an example.)

Although the &quot;Separate but Equal&quot; doctrine was eventually overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954), the implementation of the changes this decision required was long, contentious, and sometimes violent (see massive resistance and Southern Manifesto). While modern legal doctrine interprets the 14th amendment to prohibit &quot;explicit&quot; segregation on the basis of race, societal issues surrounding racial discrimination still remain topical (see racial profiling).

==Legal rejection==
=== Before Warren Court ===
The repeal of such restrictive laws, generally known as Jim Crow laws, was a key focus of the Civil Rights Movement prior to 1954. In &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot;, the Supreme Court addressed a legal challenge to the doctrine when a Texan black student, Heman Marion Sweatt, was seeking admission into the state-supported School of Law of the University of Texas. Since Texas did not have a law school for black students, the lower court continued the case for six months so that a state-funded law school for black students (now known as Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University) could be created. When further appeals to the Texas Supreme Court failed, Sweatt, along with the NAACP, took the case to the federal courts, before it eventually reached the Supreme Court of the United States. Here, the original decision was reversed and Sweatt was admitted into the University of Texas School of Law. This decision was based on the grounds that the separate school failed to qualify as being &quot;equal&quot;, because of both quantitative differences, such as its facilities, and intangible factors, such as its isolation from most of the future lawyers with whom its graduates would interact. The court held that, when considering graduate education, intangible factors must be considered as part of &quot;substantive equality&quot;. The same day, the Supreme Court in &quot;McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents&quot; ruled that segregation laws in Oklahoma, which had required an African-American graduate student working on a Doctor of Education degree to sit in the hallway outside the classroom door, did not qualify as &quot;separate but equal&quot;. These cases ended the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine in graduate and professional education.

=== The Warren Court ===
In 1953, Earl Warren became the 14th Chief Justice of the United States, and the Warren Court started a liberal constitutional revolution which outlawed racial segregation and &quot;separate but equal&quot; throughout the United States in a series of landmark rulings.

In &quot;Brown v. Board of Education (1954)&quot; &quot;347 U.S. 483&quot; , attorneys for the NAACP referred to the phrase &quot;equal but separate&quot; used in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; as a custom &quot;de jure&quot; racial segregation enacted into law. The NAACP, led by Thurgood Marshall (who became the first black Supreme Court Justice in 1967), was successful in challenging the constitutional viability of the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine. The Warren Court voted to overturn sixty years of law that had developed under &quot;Plessy&quot;. The Warren Court outlawed segregated public education facilities for blacks and whites at the state level. The companion case of &quot;Bolling v. Sharpe&quot;, &quot;347 U.S. 497&quot; outlawed such practices at the Federal level in the District of Columbia. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in the court opinion:
We conclude that, in the field of public education, the doctrine of &quot;separate but equal&quot; has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.

Although &quot;Brown&quot; overturned the doctrine of &quot;separate but equal&quot; in institutions of public education, it would be almost ten more years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would prohibit racial discrimination in facilities that were deemed public accommodations (transportation, hotels, etc.).

Additionally, in 1967, under &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot;, the Warren Court declared Virginia&#x27;s anti-miscegenation statute, the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, unconstitutional, thus invalidating all anti-miscegenation laws in the United States. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote the court majority opinion:

=== After Warren Court ===
In 1975, Jake Ayers Sr. filed a lawsuit against Mississippi, stating that they gave more financial support to the predominantly white public colleges. The state settled the lawsuit in 2002, directing $503 million to three historically black colleges over 17 years.

<text>William Dean Howells ( ; March 1, 1837 – May 11, 1920) was an American realist novelist, literary critic, and playwright, nicknamed &quot;The Dean of American Letters&quot;. He was particularly known for his tenure as editor of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, as well as for the novels &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; and &quot;A Traveler from Altruria,&quot; and the Christmas story &quot;Christmas Every Day,&quot; which was adapted into a 1996 film of the same name.

==Biography==

===Early life and family===
William Dean Howells was born on March 1, 1837, in Martinsville, Ohio (now known as Martins Ferry, Ohio), to William Cooper Howells and Mary Dean Howells, the second of eight children. He had Welsh, German, Irish, and English ancestry. His father was a newspaper editor and printer who moved frequently around Ohio. In 1840, the family settled in Hamilton, Ohio, where his father oversaw a Whig newspaper and followed Swedenborgianism. Their nine years there were the longest period that they stayed in one place. The family had to live frugally, although the young Howells was encouraged by his parents in his literary interests. He began at an early age to help his father with typesetting and printing work, a job known at the time as a printer&#x27;s devil. In 1852, his father arranged to have one of his poems published in the &quot;Ohio State Journal&quot; without telling him.

===Early career===
In 1856, Howells was elected as a clerk in the State House of Representatives. In 1858, he began to work at the &quot;Ohio State Journal&quot;, where he wrote poetry and short stories, and also translated pieces from French, Spanish, and German. He avidly studied German and other languages and was greatly interested in Heinrich Heine. In 1860, he visited Boston, Massachusetts and met with writers James T. Fields, James Russell Lowell, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. He became a personal friend to many of them, including Henry Adams, William James, Henry James, and Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.

In 1860 Howells wrote Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s campaign biography &quot;Life of Abraham Lincoln&quot; and subsequently gained a consulship in Venice. He married Elinor Mead on Christmas Eve 1862 at the American embassy in Paris. She was a sister of sculptor Larkin Goldsmith Mead and architect William Rutherford Mead of the firm McKim, Mead, and White. Among their children was architect John Mead Howells.

===Editorship and other literary pursuits===
Howells and his family returned to the United States in 1865 and settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He wrote for various magazines, including &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. In January 1866, James Fields offered him a position as assistant editor at &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;; he accepted after successfully negotiating for a higher salary, though he was frustrated by Fields&#x27; close supervision.

Howells was made editor in 1871, after five years as assistant editor, and he remained in this position until 1881. In 1869, he met Mark Twain with whom he formed a longtime friendship. But his relationship with journalist Jonathan Baxter Harrison was more important for the development of his literary style and his advocacy of Realism. Harrison wrote a series of articles for &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; during the 1870s on the lives of ordinary Americans. Howells gave a series of twelve lectures on &quot;Italian Poets of Our Century&quot; for the Lowell Institute during its 1870–71 season.

Howells published his first novel &quot;Their Wedding Journey&quot; in 1872, but his literary reputation soared with the realist novel &quot;A Modern Instance&quot; (1882), which described the decay of a marriage. His 1885 novel &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; became his best known work, describing the rise and fall of an American entrepreneur of the paint business. His social views were also strongly represented in the novels &quot;Annie Kilburn&quot; (1888), &quot;A Hazard of New Fortunes&quot; (1889), and &quot;An Imperative Duty&quot; (1891).

Howells was particularly outraged by the trials resulting from the Haymarket affair, which led him to portray a similar riot in &quot;A Hazard of New Fortunes&quot; and to write publicly to protest the trials of the men allegedly involved in the affair. In his public writing and in his novels, he drew attention to pressing social issues of the time. He joined the Anti-Imperialist League in 1898, in opposition to the U.S. annexation of the Philippines.

His poems were collected in 1873 and 1886, and a volume was published in 1895 under the title &quot;Stops of Various Quills&quot;. He was the initiator of the school of American realists, and he had little sympathy with any other type of fiction. However, he frequently encouraged new writers in whom he discovered new ideas or new fictional techniques, such as Stephen Crane, Frank Norris, Hamlin Garland, Harold Frederic, Abraham Cahan, Sarah Orne Jewett, and Paul Laurence Dunbar.

===Later years===

In 1902, Howells published &quot;The Flight of Pony Baker&quot;, a book for children partly inspired by his own childhood. The same year, he bought a summer home overlooking the Piscataqua River in Kittery Point, Maine. He returned there annually until Elinor&#x27;s death when he left the house to his son and family and moved to a house in York Harbor. His grandson, John Noyes Mead Howells, donated the property to Harvard University as a memorial in 1979. In 1904 he was one of the first seven people chosen for membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters, of which he became president.

In February 1910, Elinor Howells began using morphine to treat her worsening neuritis. She died on May 6, a few days after her birthday, and only two weeks after the death of Howells&#x27;s friend Mark Twain. Henry James offered his condolences, writing &quot;I think of this laceration of your life with an infinite sense of all it will mean for you&quot;. Howells and his daughter Mildred decided to spend part of the year in their Cambridge home on Concord Avenue; though, without Elinor, they found it &quot;dreadful in its ghostliness and ghastliness&quot;.

Howells died in his sleep shortly after midnight on May 11, 1920, of influenza and was buried in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Eight years later his daughter published his correspondence as a biography of his literary life.

==Literary criticism==

In addition to his own creative works, Howells wrote criticism, and essays about contemporary literary figures such as Henrik Ibsen, Émile Zola, Giovanni Verga, Benito Pérez Galdós, and, especially, Leo Tolstoy, which helped establish their reputations in the United States. He also wrote critically in support of American writers Hamlin Garland, Stephen Crane, Emily Dickinson, Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Sarah Orne Jewett, Charles W. Chesnutt, Abraham Cahan, Madison Cawein, and Frank Norris. In his &quot;Editor&#x27;s Study&quot; column at &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; and, later, at &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, he formulated and disseminated his theories of realism in literature.

Howells viewed realism as &quot;nothing more and nothing less than the truthful treatment of material.&quot;

In defense of the real, as opposed to the ideal, he wrote, I hope the time is coming when not only the artist, but the common, average man, who always &#x27;has the standard of the arts in his power,&#x27; will have also the courage to apply it, and will reject the ideal grasshopper wherever he finds it, in science, in literature, in art, because it is not &#x27;simple, natural, and honest,&#x27; because it is not like a real grasshopper. But I will own that I think the time is yet far off, and that the people who have been brought up on the ideal grasshopper, the heroic grasshopper, the impassioned grasshopper, the self-devoted, adventureful, good old romantic card-board grasshopper, must die out before the simple, honest, and natural grasshopper can have a fair field.

Howells believed the future of American writing was not in poetry but in novels, a form which he saw shifting from &quot;romance&quot; to a serious form.

Howells was a Christian socialist whose ideals were greatly influenced by Russian writer Leo Tolstoy. He joined a Christian socialist group in Boston between 1889 and 1891 and attended several churches, including the First Spiritual Temple and the Church of the Carpenter, the latter being affiliated with the Episcopal Church and the Society of Christian Socialists. These influences led him to write on issues of social justice from a moral and egalitarian point of view, being critic of the social effects of industrial capitalism. He was, however, not a Marxist.

==Reception==
Noting the &quot;documentary&quot; and truthful value of Howells&#x27;s work, Henry James wrote &quot;Stroke by stroke and book by book your work was to become, for this exquisite notation of our whole democratic light and shade and give and take, in the highest degree documentary.&quot; The late 19th-century English novelist George Gissing read two of Howells&#x27;s works, &quot;The Shadow of a Dream&quot; and &quot;A Fearful Responsibility&quot;, calling the latter &quot;inane triviality&quot;. Bliss Perry considered a knowledge of his work vital for an understanding of the American provincial novel and believed that &quot;he has never in his long career written an insincere, a slovenly, or an infelicitous page.&quot; Mark Twain considered Howells not merely unusually talented as a writer but in fact superlatively so.

<text>A papal bull is a type of public decree, letters patent, or charter issued by a pope of the Catholic Church. It is named after the leaden seal (&quot;bulla&quot;) traditionally appended to authenticate it.

==History==

Papal bulls have been in use at least since the 6th century, but the phrase was not used until around the end of the 13th century, and then only internally for unofficial administrative purposes. However, it had become official by the 15th century, when one of the offices of the Apostolic Chancery was named the &quot;register of bulls&quot; (&quot;registrum bullarum&quot;).

By the accession of Pope Leo IX in 1048, a clear distinction developed between two classes of bulls of greater and less solemnity. The majority of the &quot;great bulls&quot; now in existence are in the nature of confirmations of property or charters of protection accorded to monasteries and religious institutions. In an era when there was much fabrication of such documents, those who procured bulls from Rome wished to ensure that the authenticity of their bull was above suspicion. A papal confirmation, under certain conditions, could be pleaded as itself constituting sufficient evidence of title in cases where the original deed had been lost or destroyed.

Since the 12th century, papal bulls have carried a leaden seal with the heads of the apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul on one side and the pope&#x27;s name on the other. Papal bulls were originally issued by the pope for many kinds of communication of a public nature, but by the 13th century, papal bulls were only used for the most formal or solemn of occasions. Papyrus seems to have been used almost uniformly as the material for these documents until the early years of the eleventh century, after which it was rapidly superseded by a rough kind of parchment.

Modern scholars have retroactively used the word &quot;bull&quot; to describe any elaborate papal document issued in the form of a decree or privilege, solemn or simple, and to some less elaborate ones issued in the form of a letter. Popularly, the name is used for any papal document that contains a metal seal.

Today, the bull is the only written communication in which the pope will refer to himself as &quot;Episcopus Servus Servorum Dei&quot; (&quot;Bishop, Servant of the Servants of God&quot;).

While papal bulls always used to bear a metal seal, they now do so only on the most solemn occasions. A papal bull is today the most formal type of public decree or letters patent issued by the Vatican Chancery in the name of the pope.

==Format==
A bull&#x27;s format formerly began with one line in tall, elongated letters containing three elements: the pope&#x27;s name, the papal title &quot;Episcopus Servus Servorum Dei&quot; (&quot;Bishop, Servant of the Servants of God&quot;), and its incipit, i.e., the first few Latin words from which the bull took its title for record-keeping purposes, but which might not be directly indicative of the bull&#x27;s purpose.
The body of the text was often very simple in layout, and it had no specific conventions for its formatting. The closing section consisted of a short &quot;&quot;datum&quot; that mentioned the place of issuance, day of the month and year of the pope&#x27;s pontificate on which issued, and signatures, near which was attached the seal.

For the most solemn bulls, the pope signed the document himself, in which case he used the formula &quot;Ego N. Catholicae Ecclesiae Episcopus&quot;&quot; (&quot;I, N., Bishop of the Catholic Church&quot;). Following the signature in this case would be an elaborate monogram, the signatures of any witnesses, and then the seal. In modern times, a member of the Roman Curia signs the document on behalf of the pope, usually the Cardinal Secretary of State, and thus the monogram is omitted.

==Seal==

The most distinctive characteristic of a bull was the metal seal (&quot;bulla&quot;), which was usually made of lead, but on very solemn occasions was made of gold, as those on Byzantine imperial instruments often were (see Golden Bull). On the obverse it depicted, originally somewhat crudely, the early Fathers of the Church of Rome, the apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul, identified by the letters Sanctus PAulus&quot; and Sanctus PEtrus&quot; (thus, SPA •SPE or SPASPE). St. Paul, on the left, was shown with flowing hair and a long pointed beard composed of curved lines, while St. Peter, on the right, was shown with curly hair and a shorter beard made of dome-shaped &quot;globetti&quot; (beads in relief). Each head was surrounded by a circle of &quot;globetti&quot;, and the rim of the seal was surrounded by an additional ring of such beads, while the heads themselves were separated by a depiction of a cross. On the reverse was the name of the issuing pope in the nominative Latin form, with the letters &quot;PP&quot;, for &quot;&quot; (&quot;Shepherd of Shepherds&quot;). This disc was then attached to the document either by cords of hemp, in the case of letters of justice and executory letters, or by red and yellow silk, in the case of letters of grace, that was looped through slits in the vellum of the document. The term &quot;&quot;bulla&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;bullire&quot;&quot; (&quot;to boil&quot;), and alludes to the fact that, whether of wax, lead, or gold, the material making the seal had to be melted to soften it for impression.

In 1535, the Florentine engraver Benvenuto Cellini was paid 50 &quot;scudi&quot; to recreate the metal matrix which would be used to impress the lead &quot;bullae&quot; of Pope Paul III. Cellini retained definitive iconographic items like the faces of the two apostles, but he carved them with a much greater attention to detail and artistic sensibility than had previously been in evidence. On the reverse of the seal he added several fleurs-de-lis, a heraldic device of the Farnese family, from which Pope Paul III descended.

Since the late 18th century, the lead &quot;bulla&quot; has been replaced with a red ink stamp of Saints Peter and Paul with the reigning pope&#x27;s name encircling the picture, though very formal letters, e.g. the bull of Pope John XXIII convoking the Second Vatican Council, still receive the leaden seal.

Original papal bulls exist in quantity only after the 11th century onward, when the transition from fragile papyrus to the more durable parchment was made. None survives in entirety from before 819. Some original lead &quot;bullae&quot;, however, still survive from as early as the 6th century.

==Content==

In terms of content, the bull is simply the format in which a decree of the pope appears. Any subject may be treated in a bull, and many were and are, including statutory decrees, episcopal appointments, dispensations, excommunications, apostolic constitutions, canonizations, and convocations.

The bull was the exclusive letter format from the Vatican until the 14th century, when the papal brief appeared. The brief is the less formal form of papal communication and was authenticated with a wax impression, now a red ink impression, of the Ring of the Fisherman.

<text>Inini was an inland territory of French Guiana, administered separately between 6 June 1930 and 19 March 1946, after which all of French Guiana became a department of France. The territory remained governed as a special entity, until 17 March 1969 when it was dissolved into communes, and subject to regular government. Its capital was Saint-Élie. The population of the territory consisted of Amerindians, Maroons, and gold prospectors. The district was named after the river Inini, a major river in the interior of French Guiana which runs east to west, unlike the other major rivers which run south to north.

The purpose of the colony was to develop the interior separately from the coastal area around Cayenne. The colony came into effect on 6 June 1930, and was mainly a military affair. The territory was ruled by decree first by the governor of French Guiana and later by the prefect. Initially only three services were offered: water management, forest management, and mines.
In 1930, a total of seven military officers and nine gendarmes were stationed in the territory. The main focus was on the legal gold mining companies, and the difficult access to the mines in the jungle. In 1931, a labour force consisting of 535 Annamite prisoners who had revolted against French rule in Indochina were brought in to make the territory accessible. Senegalese Tirailleurs were used to guard and oversee the prisoners. In 1936, the governor informed Paris that the project was successful, because the interior could soon be opened for colonisation. In 1937, the prisoners at Camp Crique Anguille revolted.

In 1941, American troops were stationed in Suriname to protect the colony and its bauxite industry, which was primarily American-owned. One year later, Brazil declared war on Germany. Inini was part of Vichy France, a neutral state associated with Nazi Germany through the Armistice of 22 June 1940, and now found itself squeezed between two hostile countries, therefore the main effort of the administration was guarding the borders until 16 March 1943 when Inini sided with Free France. On 6 December 1944, the prisoner camps were abandoned and the Annamites returned to the normal prisons. The first group was released in July 1946, however the last group had to wait until August 1953.

The plan to develop the territory did not work out, owing to the difficulties of railroad construction in the interior. The ruins of the three prisons used may still be seen. In 1944, the Brazzaville Conference was held among Free French leaders which promised all citizens of France&#x27;s colonies equal rights with French citizens after the war. Therefore, on 19 March 1946 all of French Guiana became a department of France; however, Inini would be administrated separately, because it was lacking basic services like health care and education. On 17 March 1969, the territory was dissolved into communes, and subject to regular democratic government.

==Postage stamps==

During this period, the postage stamps of French Guiana were overprinted with several variations on &quot;TERRITOIRE DE L&#x27;ININI&quot; and the omnibus issues for the Colonial Arts Exhibition in 1937 and the New York World&#x27;s Fair in 1939 included stamps inscribed &quot;ININI&quot;. Despite the limited audience, the stamps of Inini are commonly available at minimal prices today.

<text>Prairie Chapel Ranch, nicknamed Bush Ranch, is a ranch in unincorporated McLennan County, Texas, located northwest of Crawford (about from Waco). The property was acquired by George W. Bush in 1999 and was known as the Western White House during his presidency. Bush spent vacation time at the house, where he also entertained visiting dignitaries from around the world. The ranch received its name from the Prairie Chapel School which was built nearby on land donated by mid-19th century German immigrant Heinrich Engelbrecht from Oppenwehe, Germany, who owned the land that now comprises the Bush ranch. Engelbrecht also donated land for the nearby Canaan Baptist Church (the &quot;Prairie Chapel&quot;).

==History==
Engelbrecht and his heirs raised turkeys and hogs. The original Engelbrecht ranch house is about from the main house on Rainey Road and is now called the &quot;Governor&#x27;s House&quot; and is used to accommodate overflow guests. The Bushes stayed in the house during construction of the new house.

In 1999, a year before he was elected president, shortly after earning a $14.3 million profit from the sale of the Texas Rangers, then-Texas Governor Bush bought the land for an estimated $1.3 million from the Engelbrecht family. Assisting Bush in arrangements for the purchase was the then Texas Secretary of State Elton Bomer.

Bush removed five large hog barns on Mill Road leading into the compound in order to construct a new house, guest house, and garage.

In 2004, George Bush met a fourth grade girl named Shelby, while campaigning in St. Cloud Minnesota, and she suggested he turn his Ranch into a fully sustainable complex.

On May 10, 2008, the ranch played host to the wedding of Jenna Bush to Henry Hager, a son of former Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, John H. Hager. The ceremony was relatively simple and was attended by some two hundred friends and family members.

==House and grounds==

===House===

David Heymann, then an associate professor of architecture at the University of Texas at Austin, designed the four-bedroom, honey-colored native limestone single-level home with painted white galvanized tin roof manufactured and installed on the site. Heymann said the house was built from the less sought after portion of the local &quot;Lueders limestone&quot;. The middle portion of each block of stone has a cream color, while the edges are multicolored. &quot;We bought all this throwaway stone. It&#x27;s fabulous. It&#x27;s got great color and it is relatively inexpensive,&quot; Heymann said.

In addition there is an open limestone porch that encircles the house. The house was built by Byron Bottoms Builder from nearby Elm Mott, Texas, and wasn&#x27;t completed until after Bush&#x27;s inauguration because of needed accommodations for security, meeting space, etc.

Laura Bush said they decided to keep a single level ranch design because &quot;We wanted our older parents to feel comfortable here... We also want to grow old here ourselves.&quot;

The passive-solar house is positioned to absorb winter sunlight, warming the interior walkways and walls of the residence. ground source heat pumps circulate water through pipes buried ) deep in the ground. A underground cistern collects rainwater gathered from roof urns; wastewater from sinks, toilets, and showers cascades into underground purifying tanks and is also funneled into the cistern. The water from the cistern is then used to irrigate the landscaping around the home.

The one-story, eight-room, ground-level house runs east and west. There are no stairs, even at entrances. There are no thresholds. For the most part, the house is one room wide, making for easy ventilation. The porch is the usual route from one room to another. A few rooms have interior doors.

&quot;Every room has a relationship with something in the landscape that&#x27;s different from the room next door,&quot; Heymann says. &quot;Each of the rooms feels like a slightly different place.&quot; In the guest bathroom, for example, when you look up from the sink, you look out on an oak tree rather than into a mirror, which is on a side wall.

&quot;There’s a great grove of oak trees to the west that protects it from the late afternoon sun,&quot; Heymann says. &quot;Then there is a view out to the north looking at hills, and to the east out over a lake, and the view to the south running out to beautiful hills.&quot;

Heymann says most of the rooms are relatively small and have high ceilings. The living-family room and the kitchen-dining room in the east end of the house are large, laid out for frequent entertaining and family gatherings. The living room has a series of glass picture doors. The tin roof of the house extends beyond the porch. When it rains, it&#x27;s possible to sit on the patio and watch the water pour down without getting wet. Under a gravel border around the house, a concrete gutter channels the water into the cistern for irrigation. In hot weather, a terrace directly above the cistern is a little cooler than the surrounding area.

The Bushes installed a geothermal heating and cooling system, which uses about 25% of the electricity that traditional heating and air-conditioning systems consume. Several holes were drilled deep, where the temperature is a constant . Pipes connected to a heat pump inside the house circulate water into the ground, then back up and through the house, heating it in winter and cooling it in summer. The water for the outdoor pool is heated with the same system, which proved so efficient that initial plans to install solar energy panels were cancelled.

===Other structures===

In addition to the house there is a guest house and a garage in separate buildings to the southwest of the main house.

The facility includes a helicopter hangar which was used as an auditorium on the rare occasions when the former president held a press conference at the ranch.

In 2002, the ranch was wired for what Bush described in a 2003 tour of the ranch as &quot;real time, secure videoconferencing&quot; to be used for his briefings from the CIA and other secured communications.

Overnight visitors stay in the main house, its associated guest house, the original Englebrecht farmhouse, or in a five-bedroom three-bath mobile home.

News reporters stayed in hotels in Waco. Press conferences that didn&#x27;t involve the President were conducted in the gymnasium of Crawford Middle School, away from the ranch. The barn often seen behind TV correspondents during their live reports was actually on private property behind the school.

===Grounds===
The land includes seven canyons and of frontage along Rainey Creek and the Middle Bosque River. In August 2001 while touring the canyons with reporters Bush noted that the cedars in the canyons would be a good nesting ground for the endangered golden-cheeked warbler although the warblers have not actually been seen on the compound.

Bush added an man-made pond that he stocked with 600 largemouth bass and 30,000 bait fish. There are also bluegill and red ear sunfish. The pond has a maximum depth of . In May 2006, when asked to name the best moment in his administration, Bush jokingly said: &quot;I would say the best moment was when I caught a largemouth bass on my lake.&quot;

At the urging of his daughters, Bush also built a swimming pool over the objections of Heymann who thought it would interrupt the stark views. Bush referred to it as &quot;the whining pool&quot;—whine long enough and you get it. It offers a respite from the hot Texas summers, and is heated by the same geothermal system as the house is during the winter.

==Activities==

A prized souvenir from the ranch is a gray Under Armour athletic shirt emblazoned with a Texas star encircled by the words &quot;The President&#x27;s 100-Degree Club.&quot; In order to qualify a visitor must run , or bike for 10, when the thermometer hits triple digits.

When he was president, Bush used the ranch for vacations, meetings, and entertaining foreign dignitaries. In the less formal setting, dress code for meetings called for an open collar and no tie. When not holding meetings or briefings, Bush spent his time mountain biking, jogging, fishing, bird hunting, and clearing brush.

In 2001–2002, Bush held meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abudallah in his 2001 Ford F-250 pickup truck at the ranch. The meetings were covered by the media as &quot;pickup diplomacy&quot; as part as a personal approach to foreign policy. For security concerns, Presidents cannot drive on public roads, but Bush could drive himself, dignitaries, legislators, press and others around the ranch in his truck. In 2013, President Bush donated his personal 2013 Ford F-150 King Ranch edition to be auctioned for charity.

Bush made clear his preference for spending some time away from his official residence at the White House in Washington, DC. In 2001, he said, &quot;I think it is so important for a president to spend some time away from Washington, in the heartland of America.&quot;

====Putin&#x27;s visit to the ranch====

On November 16, 2001, Vladimir Putin visited President Bush on his Prairie ranch where discussions were held as well as relationships amended. With the two holding a press conference at Crawford High School they spoke about how Russia is now an ally and that they should quit holding on to the dead weight of the Cold War and further their friendship with each other. They then spoke about Afghanistan and the arms control that they would like to see in the coming years. They agreed to deep cuts in long-range nuclear warheads. But they did not reach a deal on how to pave the way for testing and deployment of a U.S. missile defense shield. President Bush quickly turned serious. He returned to a theme that had echoed throughout the summit: That U.S.-Russian ties had entered a new phase and arms control was no longer the driving force. &quot;We&#x27;ve found many areas in which we can cooperate and we&#x27;ve found some areas where we disagree. But nevertheless, our disagreements will not divide us, as nations that need to combine to make the world more peaceful and prosperous,&quot; he said.

==Security considerations==

The Federal Aviation Administration had a full-time no fly zone, designated &quot;Prohibited Area 49&quot; (P-49), around the ranch during the Bush Presidency. When President Bush was in residence at the ranch, a Temporary Flight Restriction was issued, expanding the radius to , with lesser restrictions extending to , containing some exceptions for Waco Regional Airport nearby. The size of the restricted area P-49 was reduced in June 2010 to a radius up to an altitude of 2,000 feet, which is still in effect.

Bush normally flew in and out of TSTC Waco Airport (the former Connally Air Force Base that is now owned by Texas State Technical College) on Air Force One, and was shuttled on Marine One to the ranch.

==Future of the ranch==
At the close of the Bush presidency, the Bushes purchased a home in Dallas. Laura Bush confirmed that they would make that their permanent residence, while spending weekends and holidays at the ranch.
&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; quoted an unnamed White House official: &quot;They&#x27;ll have their place in Crawford. He just loves it.&quot;

<text>David William Edmunds (born 15 April 1944) is a Welsh retired singer, songwriter, guitarist and record producer. Although he is mainly associated with pub rock and new wave, having many hits in the 1970s and early 1980s, his natural leaning has always been towards 1950s-style rock and roll and rockabilly.

==Career==
===Early bands===
Edmunds was born in Cardiff, Wales. As a ten-year-old, he first played in 1954 with a band called the Edmunds Bros Duo with his older brother Geoff (born 5 December 1939, Cardiff); this was a piano duo. Then the brothers were in the Stompers, later called the Heartbeats, formed around 1957 with Geoff Edmunds and Allan Goldsworty on rhythm guitars, Dave on lead guitar, Denny Driscoll on lead vocals, Johnny Stark on drums, and Tom Edwards on bass. Then Dave and Geoff were in the 99ers along with scientist and writer Brian J. Ford. After that Dave Edmunds was in Crick Feathers&#x27; Hill-Bills formed in about 1960, with Edmunds (&quot;Feathers&quot;) on lead guitar, Zee Dolan on bass, Tennessee Tony on lead vocals, Tony Kees on piano and Hank Two Sticks on drums. The first group that Edmunds fronted was the Cardiff-based 1950s style rockabilly trio the Raiders formed in 1961, along with Brian &#x27;Rockhouse&#x27; Davies on bass (born 15 January 1943, Cardiff) and Ken Collier on drums. Edmunds was the only constant member of the group, which later included bassist Mick Still, Bob &#x27;Congo&#x27; Jones on drums (b. 13 August 1946, Barry, South Wales) and John Williams (stage name John David) on bass. The Raiders worked almost exclusively in the South Wales area.

In 1966, after a short spell in a Parlophone recording band, the Image (1965–1966), with local drummer Tommy Riley, Edmunds shifted to a more blues-rock sound, reuniting with Congo Jones and bassist John Williams and adding second guitarist Mickey Gee to form the short-lived Human Beans, a band that played mostly in London and on the UK university circuit. In 1967, the band recorded a cover of &quot;Morning Dew&quot; on the British Columbia label that failed to have any chart impact. After just eighteen months, the core of Human Beans formed a new band called Love Sculpture that again reinstated Edmunds, Jones and Williams as a trio. Love Sculpture released their debut single &quot;River to Another Day&quot; in 1968. Their second single was a quasi-novelty Top 5, a reworking of Khachaturian&#x27;s classical piece &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; as a speed-crazed rock number, inspired by Keith Emerson&#x27;s classical rearrangements. &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; became a hit after garnering the enthusiastic attention of British DJ John Peel, who was so impressed he played it twice in one programme on &quot;Top Gear&quot;. The band issued two albums.

=== Solo career ===

After Love Sculpture split, Edmunds had a UK Christmas Number 1 single in 1970 with &quot;I Hear You Knocking&quot;, a Smiley Lewis cover, which he came across while producing Shakin&#x27; Stevens and the Sunsets&#x27; first album entitled &quot;A Legend&quot;. The recording was the first release on Edmunds&#x27; manager&#x27;s MAM Records label. This single also reached No. 4 in the US, making it Edmunds&#x27; biggest hit by far on either side of Atlantic Ocean. It sold over three million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Edmunds had intended to record Wilbert Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Work Together&quot;, but when he was beaten to that song by Canned Heat, he adapted the arrangement he intended to use for it to &quot;I Hear You Knocking&quot;. The success of the single caused EMI&#x27;s Regal Zonophone Records to use an option that it had to claim Edmunds&#x27; album, 1972&#x27;s &quot;Rockpile&quot;, and the momentum from the single&#x27;s success on a different label went away.

Edmunds&#x27; only acting role followed, as a band member in the David Essex movie &quot;Stardust&quot;. After learning the trade of producer, culminating in a couple of singles in the style of Phil Spector, &quot;Baby I Love You&quot; (No. 8 in the chart) and &quot;Born to Be with You&quot; (No. 5 in the chart), he became linked with the pub rock movement of the early 1970s, producing (among others) Brinsley Schwarz, Ducks Deluxe, Flamin&#x27; Groovies, and blues rock band Foghat, using a stripped down, grittier sound.

Edmunds had bought a house in Rockfield, Monmouth, a few miles away from Charles and Kingsley Ward&#x27;s Rockfield Studios, where he became an almost permanent fixture for the next twenty years. His working regime involved arriving at the studio in the early evening and working through till well after dawn, usually locked in the building alone. Applying the layered Spector Wall of Sound to his own productions, it was not unusual for Edmunds to multilayer up to forty separately recorded guitar tracks into the mix.

===Rockpile and other collaborations===

His own solo LP from 1975, &quot;Subtle as a Flying Mallet&quot;, was similar in style. The Brinsley Schwarz connection brought about a collaboration with Nick Lowe starting with this album, and in 1976 they formed the group Rockpile, with Billy Bremner and Terry Williams. Because Edmunds and Lowe signed to different record labels that year, they could not record as Rockpile until 1980, but many of their solo LPs (such as Lowe&#x27;s &quot;Labour of Lust&quot; and Edmunds&#x27; own &quot;Repeat When Necessary&quot;) were group recordings. Edmunds had more UK hits during this time, including Nick Lowe&#x27;s &quot;I Knew the Bride&quot;, Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;Girls Talk&quot;, Hank DeVito&#x27;s &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot; (later a larger, international hit for American country-rock singer Juice Newton), Graham Parker&#x27;s &quot;Crawling from the Wreckage&quot;, and Melvin Endsley&#x27;s &quot;Singing the Blues&quot; (originally a 1956 US Country No. 1 hit for Marty Robbins, then a US pop No. 1 cover for Guy Mitchell, and a UK No. 1 for both Mitchell and Tommy Steele).

The album &quot;Repeat When Necessary&quot; received a Silver Certification from the British Phonographic Industry on 20 March 1980 (for over 60,000 copies sold in the UK). The single &quot;Girls Talk&quot; also received a Silver Certificate from the BPI. Edmunds, with Rockpile, performed in a music video for &quot;Girls Talk&quot;, directed by Martin Pitts and produced by Derek Burbidge and Helen Pollack. For the video, the band set up on the roof of the Warner Brothers Records building in Midtown Manhattan in the early afternoon. Unexpectedly, after Rockpile released their first LP under their own name, &quot;Seconds of Pleasure&quot; (1980), the band split. Edmunds spent the 1980s collaborating with and producing an assortment of artists, including Paul McCartney, King Kurt, Stray Cats, Fabulous Thunderbirds, and Status Quo.

On his 1983 release, &quot;Information&quot;, Edmunds collaborated on two songs with Jeff Lynne, the leader of Electric Light Orchestra. One of these songs, a Lynne composition, &quot;Slipping Away&quot;, became Edmunds&#x27; only other US Top 40 hit, spending a single week at No. 39 while having a video clip in heavy rotation on MTV. It was not a hit in the UK. In 1984, Lynne produced six tracks on Edmunds&#x27; following album, &quot;Riff Raff&quot;. He also recorded the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Porky&#x27;s Revenge!&quot;, supplying the main theme, &quot;High School Nights.&quot;

In late 1985, Dave Edmunds was the musical director and a participating band member of Carl Perkins&#x27;s &quot;Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session&quot; television special recorded live at Limehouse Studios in London. Other musicians involved in the project included George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton and Rosanne Cash. In 1989, Edmunds produced the album &quot;Yo Frankie&quot; for Dion.

===1990 onwards===

Edmunds recorded less frequently after the mid-1980s, living in Wales in semi-retirement, but occasionally touring. He joined up with Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band for tours in 1992 and 2000. However, 2007 marked a return to touring for Edmunds, alongside Joe Brown, on a lengthy tour around the UK. He made an appearance on stage alongside Stray Cats, at the Brixton Academy in London, on 10 September 2008, playing &quot;The Race Is On&quot; and &quot;Tear It Up&quot; with the band.

In 1993 Edmunds was in Cardiff Crown Court as a co-defendant along with Shakin&#x27; Stevens facing charges of non-payment of playing royalties from former Sunsets&#x27; band members Robert Llewellyn, Carl Petersen, Steve Percy and Paul Dolan. The prosecution asserted that the former band members were due a share of those additional royalties that Stevens and Edmunds had received from the successful reissue of the album &quot;A Legend&quot; during the early eighties. The judge agreed and, while the unpaid royalties only amounted to around £70,000 to be divided among the four musicians, the associated court costs to be paid by Stevens and Edmunds amounted to £500,000.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2008, he appeared on &quot;Jools&#x27; Annual Hootenanny&quot;, performing &quot;Girls Talk&quot; and &quot;I Hear You Knocking&quot;. He was Holland&#x27;s guest again at Borde Hill Garden on 20 June 2009, on 28 August at an open-air concert at Carrickfergus Castle, on 31 October at Ipswich Regent, on 7 November at Stoke Victoria Hall and on 14 November at Nottingham Concert Hall. Edmunds also played a five-song set, including &quot;I Hear You Knocking,&quot; &quot;I Knew the Bride&quot; and &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; with the Holland Big Band at the Royal Albert Hall on 27 November 2009.

He returned and performed &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; on &quot;Jools&#x27; Annual Hootenanny&quot; on the 2009/10 edition. An album release on 19 November 2013 called &quot;...Again&quot;, featured recordings from the 1990s, plus four new tracks, Edmunds&#x27; first for almost 20 years, with the title track released as a digital download single. In 2015, Edmunds released his first instrumental album &quot;On Guitar... Dave Edmunds: Rags &amp; Classics&quot;, which featured instrumental covers of classic songs, such as The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;God Only Knows&quot; and Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Your Song&quot;. The album was Edmunds&#x27; final album and after playing a final show in July 2017, he was reported to have retired from the music business.

<text>Mountain guns are artillery pieces designed for mountain warfare and other areas where wheeled transport is not possible. They are generally capable of being taken apart to make smaller loads for transport by horses, humans, mules, tractors, or trucks. As such, they are sometimes called &quot;pack guns&quot; or &quot;pack howitzers&quot;. During the American Civil War these small portable guns were widely used and were called &quot;mountain howitzers&quot;.

The first designs of modern breechloading mountain guns with recoil control and the capacity to be easily broken down and reassembled into highly efficient units were made by Greek army engineers P. Lykoudis and Panagiotis Danglis (after whom the Schneider-Danglis gun was named) in the 1890s.

Mountain guns are similar to infantry support guns. They are largely outdated, their role being filled by howitzers, mortars, multiple rocket launchers, recoilless rifles, and missiles. Most modern artillery is manufactured from light-weight materials and can be transported fully assembled by helicopters.

<text>The Canon de 76 FRC was a Belgian infantry support gun, produced by the Fonderie Royale des Canons (FRC). The gun was typically of 76 mm calibre; however, an optional 47 mm barrel could be fitted instead. The gun was designed for transport via a trailer towed by a vehicle. In 1940, the Wehrmacht redesignated these as 7.6 cm IG 260(b). At the start of World War II, 198 of these guns had been produced.

<text>Infantry support guns or battalion guns are artillery weapons designed and used to increase the firepower of the infantry units they are intrinsic to, offering immediate tactical response to the needs of the unit&#x27;s commanding officer. They typically have short, low-velocity barrels, and light construction carriages, allowing them to be more easily manoeuvered on the battlefield. They are generally used for direct fire, rather than the indirect fire of other types of artillery. Their role has generally been replaced by tanks using tank guns, infantry fighting vehicles using autocannons, other combat vehicles, mortars, recoilless rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and shoulder-launched missiles.

==Infantry support guns==

===Development history===
Infantry support guns were the first type of artillery employed by armed forces, initially in China, and later brought to Europe by the Mongol invasion. In their initial form, they lacked carriages or wheels, and were simple cast barrels called in French, or in Italian. These weapons were relatively small, immobile, and fired large bolts or quarrels. Along with increases in the sizes of ordnance (the barrels) came the requirement of easier transportation. This led to two divergent approaches, the very light hand-gun, and eventually the arquebus, while another avenue of development led to the light ordnance, now on wheeled carriages, such as the 2-pounder Culvern moyane, the 1-pounder falcon, and the -pounder falconet. These lighter Renaissance pieces eventually led to the development of the 3-pounder and 4-pounder regimental guns of the 17th century as well as the leather cannon, notably in the army of Gustavus Adolphus. The light field guns of the 17th century, commonly known as a drake in England, came in almost 100 different calibres, with each having its own distinct name, some of which were:
:5-pound, -inch saker, weighing 1 ton
:4-pound, 3-inch minion, weighing ton
:2-pound, -inch falcon, weighing ton
:1-pound, 2-inch falconet, weighing 
:-pound, -inch robinet, weighing 

The saker and falcon had point-blank ranges of , and extreme ranges respectively.

Although oxen were used to haul the heavier field and siege ordnance, some on wagons rather than limbers, they were too slow to keep up with the infantry, and so horses were used to pull the lighter pieces, leading to the development of the artillery carriage and horse team that survived until the late 19th century.

===17th- to 19th-century development===
The first School of Artillery in Venice was opened early in the 16th century, and by the late 17th century the different old names of the lighter ordnance were abandoned, and replaced with the French &quot;canon&quot;, or cannon.

The first regimental guns in English service were ordered by King James II in 1686; two 3-pounders for each of the seven regiments (of one battalion each) encamped in Hyde Park. Attachment of guns to the infantry had practical reasons also. While the allocation of horses was reckoned at one for each 350–500 pounds of ordnance and its carriage, this was only true for availability of good horses and good roads, both in short supply due to unscrupulous civilian contractors and lack of road building technology. In cases where the work was excessive for horses alone, infantry would join them in pulling the guns, calculated at 80 lbs per infantryman, a load which remains at the upper limit of the average light infantry unit requirement today.

The 3-pounder Grasshopper cannon was in use with British forces in the 18th century. Each British infantry battalion had an officer and 34 non commissioned officers and other ranks trained by the Royal Artillery to handle the two 3- or light 6-pounder guns battalion guns.

Frederick the Great of Prussia was the first to introduce artillery tactics for the regimental guns which were to accompany the infantry units as part of his reform of the Prussian artillery as a whole before and during the Seven Years&#x27; War. This included the determination that canister shot was only effective at a range of 100 yards, same as that of the musket range, and therefore put the gunners into the environment of direct infantry combat due to Frederick&#x27;s insistence that artillery should participate in the infantry attack.

In 1732 Florent-Jean de Vallière standardized French artillery ordnance (barrels) into five calibers. The lightest piece was the Vallière 4-pounder and the heavier cannons were 8-, 12-, 16- and 24-pounders. The 4-pounder proved too heavy to be employed as a battalion gun so Swedish 4-pounders were used for that purpose beginning in 1757. Two years later the French began using the 1-pdr Rostaing gun but it only had limited service.

Manufacture of the ordnance was also revolutionised by the early-18th century invention of the boring mechanism by the Swiss gun-founder Moritz of Geneva which allowed for a far greater precision achieved in the casting, in essence creating a huge lathe on which the barrel casting turned instead of the boring tool. Manufacture of cannonballs was also improved so the projectiles were now well-fitted to the bore of the ordnance, and after conducting experiments with gunpowder, the powder charges were determined to be one-third the weight of the shot (cannonball).

Frederick&#x27;s artillery doctrine influenced the development of the French artillery troops, and after 1764 Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval, the first Inspector of Artillery, after conducting trials in Strasbourg, reorganised French artillery units to provide them with greater mobility, changing length of the barrels to standard 18-calibre length, including the regimental 4-pounders. These were now pulled by four horses and used large six-wheeled vehicles that also included the caissons. The system of ordnance, carriages, ball, and powder charges introduced by de Gribeauval remained virtually unaltered through the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars.

===20th-century development===

Infantry support guns drew much interest in course of World War I because of the developments in trench warfare. In addition to the usual requirements that they needed to be portable enough to be carried by infantry, two separate capabilities were desired. First, it needed to engage in high angle indirect fire, especially given the prevalence of trenches. Second, it needed to be capable of low angle direct fire, while being carried by assault infantry, to engage strongpoints, bunkers, and other fortifications. Some infantry support guns that appeared between world wars, such as the German 7.5 cm leichtes Infanteriegeschütz 18 and Japanese Type 92 battalion gun were designed to meet all these requirements simultaneously and saw action during WWII.

==List of infantry support guns==
=== Belgium ===
*Canon de 76 FRC

The Canon de 76 FRC was a Belgian infantry support gun, produced by the Fonderie Royale des Canons (FRC). The gun was typically of 76 mm calibre; however, an optional 47 mm barrel could be fitted instead. The gun was designed for transport via a trailer towed by a vehicle. In 1940, the Wehrmacht redesignated these as 7.6 cm IG 260(b).

=== France ===
*Canon d&#x27;Infanterie de 37 modèle 1916 TRP

The Canon d&#x27;Infantrie de 37 modele 1916 TRP (37mm mle.1916) was a French infantry support gun, first used during World War I. The gun was used by a number of forces during and after the war. The US acquired a number of these guns, which they designated 37mm M1916; however, by 1941 the US Army had put these into storage (or scrapped them). Poland fielded a number. In 1940, the Wehrmacht began using these as 3.7 cm IG 152(f). During the First World War, the Japanese Type 11 was based on this design.

=== United States ===
*M1916 37mm gun
*37 mm Gun M3
*M116 howitzer
*105 mm Howitzer M3

==Modern times==
Very few support guns are still in service with infantry units, as their roles have been largely replaced by rocket-propelled grenades, grenade launchers, anti-tank guided missiles, Recoilless rifles, howitzers, and mortars. Heavier wire-guided missiles are used to engage point targets, such as structures.

Most pack guns (guns designed to be disassembled into multiple parts for easier movement over terrain) and airborne guns (guns designed for use by paratroopers by being either disassemblable for deployment or especially light, or both) are infantry support guns, but these types are also obsolete.

<doc id="210058" wikidata="Q732699" url="?curid=210058" title="Grammatical modifier">
<text>In linguistics, a modifier is an optional element in phrase structure or clause structure which &quot;modifies&quot; the meaning of another element in the structure. For instance, the adjective &quot;red&quot; acts as a modifier in the noun phrase &quot;red ball&quot;, providing extra details about which particular ball is being referred to. Similarly, the adverb &quot;quickly&quot; acts as a modifier in the verb phrase &quot;run quickly&quot;. Modification can be considered a high-level domain of the functions of language, on par with predication and reference.

==Premodifiers and postmodifiers==
Modifiers may come either before or after the modified element (the &quot;head&quot;), depending on the type of modifier and the rules of syntax for the language in question. A modifier placed before the head is called a premodifier; one placed after the head is called a postmodifier.
For example, in &quot;land mines&quot;, the word &quot;land&quot; is a premodifier of &quot;mines&quot;, whereas in the phrase &quot;mines in wartime&quot;, the phrase &quot;in wartime&quot; is a postmodifier of &quot;mines&quot;. A head may have a number of modifiers, and these may include both premodifiers and postmodifiers. For example:
* &quot;that nice tall man from Canada whom you met&quot;
In this noun phrase, &quot;man&quot; is the head, &quot;nice&quot; and &quot;tall&quot; are premodifiers, and &quot;from Canada&quot; and &quot;whom you met&quot; are postmodifiers.

In English, simple adjectives are usually used as premodifiers, with occasional exceptions such as &quot;&quot; (which always appears after the noun, coming from Irish in which most adjectives are postmodifiers) or the adjectives &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; in the phrases &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; (the latter comes from French, where most adjectives are postmodifiers). Sometimes placement of the adjective after the noun entails a change of meaning: compare &quot;a responsible person&quot; and &quot;the person responsible&quot;, or &quot;the proper town&quot; (the appropriate town) and &quot;the town proper&quot; (the area of the town as properly defined).

In English (and other languages) a modifier can be separated from its head by other modifiers, making the phrase &quot;discontinuous&quot;, as in &quot;The man here whom you bumped into in the street yesterday&quot;, where the relative clause &quot;whom...yesterday&quot; is separated from the word it modifies (&quot;man&quot;) by the modifier &quot;here&quot;. In some other languages, words other than modifiers may occur in between; this type of situation is especially likely in languages with free word order, and often agreement between the grammatical gender, number or other feature of the modifier and its head is used to indicate the relationship. In English, modifiers may sometimes even be interposed between component words or syllables of the head, such as in split infinitives (&quot;to boldly go&quot;) or infixation, most commonly expletive infixation (&quot;in-fucking-credible&quot;).

==Types==
===Formal types===
Two common parts of speech used for modification are adjectives (and adjectival phrases and adjectival clauses), which modify nouns; and adverbs (and adverbial phrases and adverbial clauses), which modify other parts of speech, particularly verbs, adjectives and other adverbs, as well as whole phrases or clauses. Not all adjectives and adverbs are necessarily modifiers, however; an adjective will normally be considered a modifier when used attributively, but not when used predicatively – compare the examples with the adjective &quot;red&quot; at the start of this article.

Another type of modifier in some languages, including English, is the noun adjunct, which is a noun modifying another noun (or occasionally another part of speech). An example is &quot;land&quot; in the phrase &quot;land mines&quot; given above.

Examples of the above types of modifiers, in English, are given below.
* &quot;It was &quot;[&quot;a nice house&quot;]&quot;.&quot; (adjective modifying a noun, in a noun phrase)
* [&quot;The swiftly flowing waters&quot;]&quot; carried it away.&quot; (adjectival phrase, in this case a participial phrase, modifying a noun in a noun phrase)
* &quot;She&#x27;s &quot;[&quot;the woman with the hat&quot;]&quot;.&quot; (adjectival phrase, in this case a prepositional phrase, modifying a noun in a noun phrase)
* &quot;I saw &quot;[&quot;the man whom we met yesterday&quot;]&quot;.&quot; (adjectival clause, in this case a relative clause, modifying a noun in a noun phrase)
* &quot;His desk was in &quot;[&quot;the faculty office&quot;]&quot;.&quot; (noun adjunct modifying a noun in a noun phrase)
* [&quot;Put it gently in the drawer&quot;]. (adverb in verb phrase)
* &quot;He was &quot;[&quot;very gentle&quot;]&quot;.&quot; (adverb in adjective phrase)
* &quot;She set it down &quot;[&quot;very gently&quot;]&quot;.&quot; (adverb in adverb phrase)
* [&quot;Even more&quot;]&quot; people were there.&quot; (adverb modifying a determiner)
* &quot;It ran &quot;[&quot;right up the tree&quot;]&quot;.&quot; (adverb modifying a prepositional phrase)
* [&quot;Only the dog&quot;]&quot; was saved.&quot; (adverb modifying a noun phrase)

In some cases, noun phrases or quantifiers can act as modifiers:
* [&quot;A few more&quot;]&quot; workers are needed.&quot; (quantifier modifying a determiner)
* &quot;She&#x27;s &quot;[&quot;two inches taller than her sister&quot;]&quot;.&quot; (noun phrase modifying an adjective)

===Functional types===
Modifiers of all types of forms may be used for certain function with different semantic features. The grammar of a language determines which morpho-syntactic forms are used for which function, as it varies from language to language. The functions of modification can be grouped into five such types:
* &quot;Classifying modification&quot; further specifies the kind of a referent: e.g. solar energy&quot;, departmental meeting&quot;.
* &quot;Qualifying modification&quot; further specifies some quality of a referent: e.g. &quot;black cars&quot;, &quot;a heavy box&quot;.
* &quot;Quantifying modification&quot; specifies the quantity (or number/cardinality) of a referent: e.g. two boxes&quot;, several cars&quot;.
* &quot;Localizing (or anchoring) modification&quot; specifies the location of a referent: e.g. this car&quot;, &quot;the house on the corner.
* &quot;Discourse-referential modification&quot; specifies the status of the referent in the discourse universe: e.g. &quot;the/a car&quot;.

==Ambiguous and dangling modifiers==

Sometimes it is not clear which element of the sentence a modifier is intended to modify. In many cases this is not important, but in some cases it can lead to genuine ambiguity. For example:
*&quot;He painted her sitting on the step.&quot;
Here the participial phrase &quot;sitting on the step&quot; may be intended to modify &quot;her&quot; (meaning that the painting&#x27;s subject was sitting on the step), or it may be intended to modify the verb phrase &quot;painted her&quot; or the whole clause &quot;he painted her&quot; (or just &quot;he&quot;), meaning in effect that it was the painter who was sitting on the step.

Sometimes the element which the modifier is intended to modify does not in fact appear in the sentence, or is not in an appropriate position to be associated with that modifier. This is often considered a grammatical or stylistic error. For example:
*&quot;Walking along the road, a vulture loomed overhead.&quot;
Here whoever was &quot;walking along the road&quot; is not mentioned in the sentence, so the modifier (&quot;walking along the road&quot;) has nothing to modify, except &quot;a vulture&quot;, which is clearly not the intention. Such a case is called a &quot;dangling modifier&quot;, or more specifically, in the common case where (as here) the modifier is a participial phrase, a &quot;dangling participle&quot;.

<text>The Škoda 7.5 cm Gebirgskanone M. 15 (; ) was a mountain gun used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. In German service, it was known as the 7,5cm Škoda Geb. K. M. 15. The Italians designated them as the Obice da 75/13 and the Wehrmacht would designate captured guns as 7.5 cm GebK 259(i) after the surrender of Italy in 1943.

==History==
Its development was quite prolonged, as the Austrians couldn&#x27;t decide on the specifications that they wanted. Initially, they wanted a gun that could be broken down into no more than five pack-animal loads to replace the various 7 cm mountain guns in service, but prolonged trials proved that the 7.5 cm M. 12 prototype to be the best gun. However, the commander-in-chief of Bosnia and Hercegovina believe it to be too heavy and demanded a return to the 7 cm caliber to save weight. Škoda dutifully built enough guns for a test battery in the smaller caliber and tested them during the spring of 1914 where they were judged inferior to the 7.5 cm guns. This cost the Austrians heavily as the 7.5 cm guns began to be delivered in April 1915 instead of the planned date of April 1914.

For transport, the gun could be dismantled into six parts, generally carried in four loads. In addition, there was a folding Gun shield fitted on some (perhaps many) such guns. A revised version of this gun was released as the Škoda 75 mm Model 1928. The Germans bought some guns during World War I, but used them as infantry guns in direct support of the infantry, as their light weight would allow them to move with the infantry. They complained that the guns were too fragile and didn&#x27;t have a high enough muzzle velocity to act as an anti-tank gun. Considering that the guns were designed to be disassembled, it is not too surprising that they couldn&#x27;t stand the abuse moving through the shell-pocketed front lines on the Western Front.

A standard Austro-Hungarian Gebirgs-Artillerie-Regimenter, which was used to beef up Field Artillery Regiments in some Corps, would be equipped with 36 Škoda M15s on paper, though in reality the number of guns and batteries varied quite a bit. Part of this reason was due to the slow production and dispersement of the guns and parts. 76 artillery pieces were delivered in the first half of 1915, with 250-252 barreled assemblies &amp; 248 carriages delivered in the second half of that same year. The German Army used the Škoda as a substitute for the 7.62 cm Infanteriegeschütz L/16.5 in the infantry support role with 14 Infanteriegeschütz-batallions equipped with these guns but using more powerful HE grenades than those used by the Austro-Hungarians. While the Austro-Hungarians were generally well pleased with the Škoda, the Germans tended to use the gun in situations it wasn&#x27;t designed for such as a mobile close support weapon. The M15 was designed to be disassembled for transport but the Germans often towed them on long marches as-is, so that the main parts had a tendency to become lose or disconnected after traveling on bumpy terrain. This was mainly because there wasn&#x27;t a large need for disassembly on the Western Front as there were in other areas such as the Italian Front.

== Surviving examples ==

Serial number 1399 (manufactured 1917) is displayed in Bundaberg, Queensland, having been gifted to that city as a war trophy, in 1921, by the Australian Government.

Another, also repatriated in the 1920s, serves as a memorial to the men and women of the armed forces in Tuamarina Cemetery, Marlborough, New Zealand.

<text>Harland &amp; Wolff is a British shipbuilding and fabrication company headquartered in London with sites in Belfast, Arnish, Appledore and Methil. It specialises in ship repair, shipbuilding and offshore construction.

Today, the company is focused on supporting five sectors: Defence, Energy, Cruise &amp; Ferry, Renewables and Commercial. It offers services including technical services, fabrication &amp; construction, repair &amp; maintenance, in-service support, conversion and decommissioning. 

Having entered administration for the second time in five years, it was bought by Navantia in January 2025.

==Overview==
Harland &amp; Wolff is famous for having built the majority of the ocean liners for the White Star Line, including &quot;Olympic&quot;-class trio – , and HMHS &quot;Britannic&quot;. Outside of White Star Line, other ships that have been built include the Royal Navy&#x27;s ; Royal Mail Line&#x27;s &quot;Andes&quot;; Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion&#x27;s ; Union-Castle&#x27;s ; P&amp;O&#x27;s ; and Hamburg-America&#x27;s SS Amerika of 1905.

In 2022, the company was awarded a major naval contract as part of Team Resolute (alongside Navantia UK and BMT), to deliver the Royal Fleet Auxiliary&#x27;s three new Fleet Solid Support vessels. Harland and Wolff&#x27;s official history, &quot;Shipbuilders to the World&quot;, was published in 1986.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===

Harland &amp; Wolff was formed in 1861 by Edward James Harland (1831-1895) and Hamburg-born Gustav Wilhelm Wolff (1834–1913) who moved to England aged 15, and then to Ireland in 1857. In 1858 Harland, then general manager, bought the small shipyard on Queen&#x27;s Island from his employer Robert Hickson.

After buying Hickson&#x27;s shipyard, Harland made his assistant Wolff a partner in the company. Wolff was the nephew of Gustav Schwabe, Hamburg, who was heavily invested in the Bibby Line, and the first three ships that the newly incorporated shipyard built were for that line. Harland made a success of the business through several innovations, notably replacing the wooden upper decks with iron ones which increased the strength of the ships; and giving the hulls a flatter bottom and squarer cross section, which increased their capacity. Walter Henry Wilson became a partner of the company in 1874.

When Harland died in 1895, William James Pirrie became the chairman of the company and remained so until his death in 1924.

=== 1900s to 1940s ===


Thomas Andrews, nephew of the then-chairman William Pirrie, became the general manager and head of the draughting department in 1907. It was in this period that the company built and the two other ships in her class, and , between 1909 and 1914. It commissioned Sir William Arrol &amp; Co. to construct a massive twin slipway and gantry structure for the project.

In 1912, due primarily to increasing political instability in Ireland, the company acquired another shipyard at Govan in Glasgow, Scotland. It bought the former London &amp; Glasgow Engineering &amp; Iron Shipbuilding Co&#x27;s Middleton and Govan New shipyards in Govan and Mackie &amp; Thomson&#x27;s Govan Old Yard, which had been owned by William Beardmore and Company. The three neighbouring yards were amalgamated and redeveloped to provide a total of seven building berths, a fitting-out basin and extensive workshops. Harland &amp; Wolff specialised in building tankers and cargo ships at Govan. The nearby shipyard of A. &amp; J. Inglis, on the north bank of the Clyde and the east bank of the Kelvin, was also purchased by Harland &amp; Wolff in 1919, along with the Meadowside shipyard of D. and W. Henderson and Company, on the north bank of the Clyde but on the west bank of the Kelvin. The company also bought a stake in the company&#x27;s primary steel supplier, David Colville &amp; Sons. Harland &amp; Wolff also established shipyards at Bootle in Liverpool, North Woolwich in London and Southampton. However, these shipyards were all eventually closed, beginning in the early 1960s when the company opted to consolidate its operations in Belfast.

In the First World War, Harland and Wolff built Abercrombie-class monitors and cruisers, including the 15-inch gun armed &quot;large light cruiser&quot; .
In 1918, the company opened a new shipyard on the eastern side of the Musgrave Channel which was named the East Yard. This yard specialised in mass-produced ships of standard design developed in the First World War.

During the 1920s, Catholic workers, Socialists and labour activists were routinely expelled from their jobs in the shipyard: Similar actions had occurred in June 1898 and July, 1912. See The Troubles in Ulster (1920–1922).

The company started an aircraft manufacturing subsidiary with Short Brothers, called Short &amp; Harland Limited in 1936. Its first order was for 189 Handley Page Hereford bombers built under licence from Handley Page for the Royal Air Force. In the Second World War, this factory built Short Stirling bombers as the Hereford was removed from service.

The shipyard was busy in the Second World War, building six aircraft carriers, two cruisers (including ) and 131 other naval ships; and repairing over 22,000 vessels. It also manufactured tanks and artillery components. It was in this period that the company&#x27;s workforce peaked at around 35,000 people. However, many of the vessels built in this era were commissioned right at the end of the Second World War, as Harland and Wolff were focused on ship repair in the first three years of the war. The yard on Queen&#x27;s Island was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe in April and May 1941 during the Belfast Blitz, causing considerable damage to the shipbuilding facilities and destroying the aircraft factory.

=== 1950s to 1990s ===
With the rise of the jet-powered airliner in the late 1950s, the demand for ocean liners declined. This, coupled with competition from Japan, led to difficulties for the British shipbuilding industry. The last liner that the company launched was MV &quot;Arlanza&quot; for Royal Mail Line in 1960; the last liner completed was SS &quot;Canberra&quot; for P&amp;O in 1961.

In the 1960s, notable achievements for the yard included the tanker &quot;Myrina&quot;, which was the first supertanker built in the UK and the largest vessel ever launched down a slipway, as it was in September 1967. In the same period the yard also built the semi-submersible drilling rig &quot;Sea Quest&quot; which, due to its three-legged design, was launched down three parallel slipways. This was a first and only time this was ever done.

In the mid-1960s, the Geddes Committee recommended that the British government advance loans and subsidies to British shipyards to modernise production methods and shipyard infrastructure to preserve jobs. A major modernisation programme at the shipyard was undertaken, centred on the creation of a large construction graving dock serviced by two Krupp Goliath cranes, the iconic Samson and Goliath, enabling the shipyard to build much larger post-war merchant ships, including one of 333,000 tonnes.

The shipyard had a long-standing reputation as a Protestant closed shop, and in 1970, during the Troubles, 500 Catholic workers were expelled from their role.

Continuing financial problems led to the company&#x27;s nationalisation, though not as part of British Shipbuilders, in 1977. In 1971, the Arrol Gantry complex, within which many ships were built until the early 1960s, was demolished. The nationalised company was sold by the British government in 1989 to a management/employee buy-out in partnership with the Norwegian shipping magnate Fred Olsen; this buy-out led to a new company called Harland &amp; Wolff Holdings Plc. By this time, the number of people employed by the company had fallen to around 3,000.

For the next few years, Harland &amp; Wolff specialised in building standard Suezmax oil tankers, and has continued to concentrate on vessels for the offshore oil and gas industry. It has made some forays outside this market.

In the late 1990s, the yard was part of the then British Aerospace team for the Royal Navy&#x27;s Future Carrier (CVF) programme. It was envisaged that the ship would be assembled at the Harland &amp; Wolff dry-dock in Belfast. In 1999, BAE merged with Marconi Electronic Systems. The new company, BAE Systems Marine, included the former Marconi shipyards on the Clyde and at Barrow-in-Furness thus rendering H&amp;W&#x27;s involvement surplus to requirements.

Faced with competitive pressures, Harland &amp; Wolff sought to shift and broaden their portfolio, focusing less on shipbuilding and more on design and structural engineering, as well as ship repair, offshore construction projects and competing for other projects to do with metal engineering and construction. This led to Harland and Wolff constructing a series of bridges in Britain and also in the Republic of Ireland, such as the James Joyce Bridge and the restoration of Dublin&#x27;s Ha&#x27;penny Bridge, building on the success of its first foray into the civil engineering sector with the construction of the Foyle Bridge in the 1980s.
Harland &amp; Wolff&#x27;s last shipbuilding project was MV &quot;Anvil Point&quot;, one of six near identical s built for use by the Ministry of Defence. The ship, built under licence from German shipbuilders Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft, was launched in 2003.

The company unsuccessfully tendered against Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique for the construction of Cunard line&#x27;s .

=== 2000s to 2020s ===

In 2003, Harland &amp; Wolff&#x27;s parent company sold 185 acres of surplus shipyard land and buildings to Harcourt Developments for £47 million. This is now known as the Titanic Quarter, and includes the £97 million Titanic Belfast visitor attraction.
In recent years the company has seen its ship-related workload increase. While Harland &amp; Wolff has had no recent involvement in shipbuilding projects, the company is increasingly involved in overhaul, re-fitting and ship repair, as well as the construction and repair of off-shore equipment such as oil platforms. On 1 February 2011 it was announced that Harland &amp; Wolff had won the contract to refurbish , effectively rekindling its nearly 150-year association with the White Star Line. Structural steel work on the ship began on 10 February 2011 and was completed in time for the 2012 Belfast Titanic Festival. In July 2012 Harland &amp; Wolff was to carry out the dry docking and service of the Husky Oil SeaRose FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading) vessel.

Belfast&#x27;s skyline is still dominated today by Harland &amp; Wolff&#x27;s famous twin gantry cranes, Samson and Goliath, built in 1974 and 1969 respectively. 

In late 2007, the &#x27;Goliath&#x27; gantry crane was re-commissioned, having been moth-balled in 2003 due to the lack of heavy-lifting work at the yard.

In June 2008, assembly work at the Belfast yard was underway on 60 Vestas V90-3MW wind turbines for the Robin Rigg Wind Farm. This was the second offshore wind farm assembled by the company for Vestas having completed the logistics for the Barrow Offshore Wind Farm in 2006. In August 2011 Harland and Wolff completed the logistics for the Ormonde Wind Farm which consisted of 30 REpower 5MW turbines.

In March 2008, the construction of the world&#x27;s first commercial tidal stream turbine, for Marine Current Turbines, was completed at the Belfast yard. The installation of the 1.2MW SeaGen Tidal System was begun in Strangford Lough in April 2008.

In July 2010, Harland &amp; Wolff secured a contract to make a prototype tidal energy turbine for Scotrenewables Ltd. Manufacture of the SR250 device was completed in May 2011 and has been undergoing testing in Orkney since.

Since April 2012, the booming offshore wind power industry has taken centre stage. Harland &amp; Wolff had been working on three innovative meteorological mast foundations for the Dogger Bank and Firth of Forth offshore wind farms, as well as putting the finishing touches to two Siemens substations for the Gwynt y Môr offshore wind farm. Seventy-five per cent of the company&#x27;s work was based on offshore renewable energy. Harland &amp; Wolff was one of many UK and international companies profiting from the emergence of UK wind- and marine-generated electricity, which had been attracting significant inward investment. As the business environment became increasingly competitive the yard began to have difficulty in generating enough business to meet overhead expenses. The yard was last profitable in 2015 and the following year it had an operating loss of £6 million.

In 2018, the parent company Fred. Olsen &amp; Co. restructured and decided to place Harland and Wolff up for sale. No buyer emerged and on 5 August 2019 the company announced that they would cease trading and entered formal administration.
Subsequently, on 1 October 2019, it was announced that the shipyard had been bought for £6 million by the London-based energy firm, InfraStrata.

In August 2020, InfraStrata also bought the dormant Appledore shipyard for £7 million. The deal will see the shipyard renamed H&amp;W Appledore complementing the H&amp;W Belfast shipyard by focusing on smaller ships of up to 119 metres in the shipbuilding and ship repair market.

In February 2021, InfraStrata acquired two BiFab yards, the £850,000 deal was struck for the Methil and Arnish yards, (but not the Burntisland facility). These Scottish facilities will trade under the Harland &amp; Wolff brand. In September 2021, Infrastrata plc was renamed Harland &amp; Wolff Group Holdings plc. 

In April 2023, the Belfast yard completed its first new vessel since &quot;Anvil Point&quot; in 2003. It is a barge for the waste management company, Cory, the first of an order for 23 such craft. From 2025 the yard is expecting to complete the final assembly of three naval support ships for the Royal Navy as part of the Team Resolute Consortium.

On 16 September 2024, it was reported that Harland &amp; Wolff entered administration for the second time in 5 years. The company was expected to continue operations normally, with its non-core operations winding down and up to 60 jobs being lost. On 19 December 2024, it was announced that the Spanish State-owned shipbuilding company Navantia had agreed to buy Harland &amp; Wolff&#x27;s four shipyards and retain all employees.

In January 2025, it was announced that Navantia had completed its purchase of the British company.

== Archives ==

A collection of Harland &amp; Wolff papers are held at Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI). The Harland &amp; Wolff archive in PRONI comprises c.2,000 files, c.200 volumes and c.16,000 documents, 1861–1987, documenting most aspects of the history of Belfast&#x27;s famous shipbuilding firm. A further major archive is held at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum (UFTM). This has a photographic collection and a ships&#x27; plans collection (i.e., technical drawings). Around 8,000 prints of Harland &amp; Wolff-built ships covering the period 1890-1945 are held in bound volumes in the UFTM&#x27;s library. However the UFTM&#x27;s collection of ships&#x27; plans is not currently available to the public nor is there a copy service. Selected early ship&#x27;s plans (dating from 1860 to 1882) are reproduced in a pictorial book by McCluskie (1998). Records relating to the Govan yard of Harland &amp; Wolff plc are maintained by the Archives of the University of Glasgow (GUAS).

<doc id="210081" wikidata="Q886931" url="?curid=210081" title="List of governors of New Jersey">
<text>The governor of New Jersey is the head of government of New Jersey and the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the New Jersey Legislature, to convene the legislature, and to grant pardons, except in cases of treason or impeachment.

The first New Jersey State Constitution, ratified in 1776, provided that a governor be elected annually by the state legislature, the members of which were selected by the several counties. Under this constitution, the governor was president of the upper house of the legislature, then called the Legislative Council. The 1844 constitution provided for a popular vote to elect the governor, who no longer presided over the upper house of the legislature, now called the Senate. The 1844 constitution also lengthened the governor&#x27;s term to three years, set to start on the third Tuesday in January following an election, and barred governors from succeeding themselves. The 1947 constitution extended terms to four years, and limits governors from being elected to more than two consecutive terms, though they can run again after a third term has passed. Joseph Bloomfield, Peter Dumont Vroom, Daniel Haines, Joel Parker, Leon Abbett, and Walter Evans Edge each served two non-consecutive stints as governor while A. Harry Moore served three non-consecutive stints. Foster McGowan Voorhees, James Fairman Fielder, and Richard Codey each served two non-consecutive stints, one as acting governor and one as official governor.

The 1776 constitution provided that the vice-president of the Legislative Council would act as governor (who was president of the council) should that office be vacant. The 1844 constitution placed the president of the Senate first in the line of succession, as did the subsequent 1947 constitution. A constitutional amendment in 2006 created the office of lieutenant governor, to be elected on the same ticket for the same term as the governor, and if the office of governor is vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. This office was first filled in 2010.

There have been 56 official governors of New Jersey, 1 of whom was female, with several others acting as governor for a time. In the official numbering, governors are counted only once each, and traditionally, only elected governors were included. However, legislation signed on January 10, 2006, allowed acting governors who had served at least 180 days to be considered full governors. The law was retroactive to January 1, 2001; it therefore changed the titles of Donald DiFrancesco and Richard Codey, affecting Jim McGreevey&#x27;s numbering. The first and longest-serving governor of New Jersey was William Livingston, who served from August 31, 1776, to July 25, 1790. A. Harry Moore remains the longest-serving popularly elected governor. The current and 56th governor is Phil Murphy, a Democrat who assumed office on January 16, 2018.

==Governors==

New Jersey was one of the original Thirteen Colonies and was admitted as a state on December 18, 1787. Before it declared its independence, New Jersey was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain.

Prior to 2010, unlike most other states, New Jersey did not have the office of lieutenant governor. Until 2010, when the office of governor was vacant or the governor was unable to fulfill their duties, the president of the State Senate served as the acting governor. The Senate president continued in the legislative role during their tenure as the state&#x27;s acting chief executive, thus giving the person both executive and legislative authority. The acting governor served either until a special election was held (which would occur if the governor died, resigned, or was removed from office with more than 16 months before the end of the term), until the governor recovered from their injuries, or, if the governor died, resigned, or was removed from office less than 16 months before end of the term, until the end of the term.

Following the resignation of Christine Todd Whitman in 2001 to become EPA Administrator, Donald DiFrancesco assumed the acting governor&#x27;s post. Following Whitman&#x27;s resignation and DiFrancesco&#x27;s departure, John O. Bennett served as acting governor for three and a half days. During that time, he signed a few bills into law, gave a State of the State Address, and held parties at Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor&#x27;s mansion. Similarly, Richard J. Codey served as acting governor during January 2002 as well. Because control of the New Jersey State Senate was split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett, each held the office of acting governor for three days. Richard Codey served as governor of New Jersey from November 2004 until January 2006, following the resignation of Jim McGreevey. Spurred by the chaotic transfers of the governorship, New Jersey voters approved a state constitutional amendment in 2005 to create the office of lieutenant governor of New Jersey effective with the 2009 state elections.

<doc id="210083" wikidata="Q2142726" url="?curid=210083" title="Macintosh SE/30">
<text>The Macintosh SE/30 is a personal computer designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer from January 1989 to October 1991. It is the fastest of the original black-and-white compact Macintosh series.

The SE/30 has a black-and-white monitor and a single Processor Direct Slot (rather than the NuBus slots of the IIx, with which the SE/30 shares a common architecture) which supported third-party accelerators, network cards, or a display adapter. The SE/30 could expand up to 32 MB of RAM (a significant amount of RAM at the time), and included a 40 or 80 MB hard drive. It was also the first compact Mac to include a 1.44 MB high density floppy disk drive as standard (late versions of the SE had one, but earlier versions did not). The power of the SE/30 was demonstrated by its use to produce the &quot;This Week&quot; newspaper, the first colour tabloid newspaper in the UK to use new, digital pre-press technology on a personal, desktop computer. 

In keeping with Apple&#x27;s practice, from the Apple II+ until the Power Macintosh G3 was announced, a logic board upgrade was available for US$1,699 to convert a regular SE to an SE/30. The SE would then have exactly the same specs as an SE/30, with the difference only in the floppy drive if the SE had an 800 KB drive. The set included a new front bezel to replace the original SE bezel with that of an SE/30.

Although this machine was succeeded in Q4 of 1990 by the Macintosh Classic, the SE/30 wasn&#x27;t discontinued until 1991 by the Macintosh Classic II, which despite featuring the same processor and clock speed, was only 60% as fast as the SE/30 due to its 16-bit data path, supported no more than 10 MB of memory, lacked an internal expansion slot, and made the Motorola 68882 FPU an optional upgrade.

==Hardware==

Although the Motorola 68030 in the SE/30 supports 32-bit addressing, the SE/30 ROM, like the IIx ROM, includes some code using 24-bit addressing, rendering the ROM &quot;32-bit dirty&quot;. This limits the actual amount of RAM that can be accessed to 8 MB under System 6.0.8. A system extension called MODE32 enables access to installed extra memory under System 6.0.8. Under System 7.0 up to System 7.5.5 the SE/30 can use up to 128 MB of RAM. Alternatively, replacing the ROM SIMM with one from a Mac IIsi or Mac IIfx makes the SE/30 &quot;32-bit clean&quot; and thereby enables use of up to 128 MB RAM and System 7.5 through OS 7.6.1.

A standard SE/30 can run up to System 7.5.5, since Mac OS 7.6 requires a &quot;32-bit clean&quot; ROM.

Additionally, the SE/30 can run A/UX, Apple&#x27;s older version of Unix that was able to run Macintosh programs.

Though there was no official upgrade path for the SE/30, several third-party processor upgrades were available. A 68040 upgrade made it possible to run Mac OS 8.1, which extended the SE/30&#x27;s productive life for many more years. 
Also extending the useful life of the SE30 were Micron Technology video cards. Three cards were available, which fit into the SE/30&#x27;s Processor Direct Slot: the 8-bit Gray-Scale 30, the SE/306-48, 640x480 resolution 8-bit color, and SE/3010-78 1024x768 resolution 8-bit color. With the first, the internal display was 8-bit greyscale; the latter two were used with 13&quot; and 14&quot;, respectively, external color monitors, while retaining 1-bit (black and white) on the internal monitor.

==Reception==
Nick Baran of &quot;BYTE&quot; in February 1989 approved of the SE/30&#x27;s performance improvements over the SE and II, stating that the only reasons to instead buy a IIx were the latter&#x27;s NuBus slots and official support for A/UX. Bruce F. Webster wrote in &quot;Macworld&quot; in March 1989 that the SE/30 did not &quot;break new ground. It does, however, establish Apple&#x27;s commitment to the classic Mac product line, and it provides users with an Apple-supported alternative to either a small, slow Mac or a large, powerful one. More important, it fills a gap in the Macintosh family ... a new level of power and portability for the Macintosh community&quot;. 

In a January 2009 &quot;Macworld&quot; feature commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Macintosh, three industry commentators – Adam C. Engst of TidBITS, John Gruber of Daring Fireball, and John Siracusa of &quot;Ars Technica&quot; – chose the SE/30 as their favorite Mac model of all time. &quot;Like any great Mac,&quot; wrote Gruber, &quot;the SE/30 wasn&#x27;t just a terrific system just when it debuted; it remained eminently usable for years to come. When I think of the original Mac era, the machine in my mind is the SE/30.&quot;

The SE/30 remains popular with hobbyists, and has been described as “the best computer Apple will ever make,” with used models selling for a significant premium relative to other machines of the era. Contemporary PDS upgrades allowed an SE/30&#x27;s internal monitor to be upgraded to support 256 shades of gray (the only original-design Macintosh to support such an upgrade) or a 68040 processor, and the SE/30&#x27;s standard RAM limit of 128 MB greatly exceeded even that of much later models such as the Color Classic and Macintosh LC II. In 2018, add-ons and software became available to add WiFi and even make the SE/30 work as a remote control for Spotify.

==In popular culture==
In the NBC TV series &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, Jerry has an SE/30 sitting on the desk of his apartment during the first few seasons. This would be the first of many Macs to occupy the desk, including a PowerBook Duo and a Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh.

In the FX series &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;, the Waitress is seen with a Macintosh SE/30 on her bedroom desk in the episode &quot;The Gang Gives Back&quot;.

In the film &quot;Watchmen,&quot; Ozymandias has an all-black TEMPEST-shielded SE/30 on his desk.
