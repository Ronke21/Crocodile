<text>In the practice of Christianity, canonical hours mark the divisions of the day in terms of fixed times of prayer at regular intervals. A book of hours, chiefly a breviary, normally contains a version of, or selection from, such prayers.

In the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, canonical hours are also called officium, since it refers to the official prayer of the Church, which is known variously as the (&quot;divine service&quot; or &quot;divine duty&quot;), and the (&quot;work of God&quot;). The current official version of the hours in the Roman Rite is called the Liturgy of the Hours () or &quot;divine office&quot;.

In Lutheranism and Anglicanism, they are often known as the daily office or divine office, to distinguish them from the other &quot;offices&quot; of the Church (e.g. the administration of the sacraments). 

In the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic Churches, the canonical hours may be referred to as the [[Divine Service (Eastern Orthodoxy)|divine services]], and the &quot;book of hours&quot; is called the (). Despite numerous small differences in practice according to local custom, the overall order is the same among Byzantine Rite monasteries, although parish and cathedral customs vary rather more so by locale.

The usage in Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Assyrian Church of the East, and their Eastern Catholic and Eastern Lutheran counterparts vary based on the rite, for example the East Syriac Rite or the Byzantine Rite.

==Development==
===Judaism and the early church===
The canonical hours stemmed from Jewish prayer. In the Old Testament, God commanded the Israelite priests to offer sacrifices of animals in the morning and afternoon (). Eventually, these sacrifices moved from the Tabernacle to Solomon&#x27;s Temple in Jerusalem.

During the Babylonian captivity, when the Temple was no longer in use, synagogues carried on the practice, and the services (at fixed hours of the day) of Torah readings, psalms, and hymns began to evolve. This &quot;sacrifice of praise&quot; began to be substituted for the sacrifices of animals. After the people returned to Judea, the prayer services were incorporated into Temple worship as well.

The miraculous healing of the crippled beggar described in Acts of the Apostles 3:1, took place as Peter and John went to the Temple for the three o&#x27;clock hour of prayer. The practice of daily prayers grew from the Jewish practice of reciting prayers at set times of the day known as : for example, in the &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot;, Saint Peter and John the Evangelist visit the Temple in Jerusalem for the afternoon prayers.

Psalm 119:164 states: &quot;Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous laws&quot; (of this, Symeon of Thessalonica writes that &quot;the times of prayer and the services are seven in number, like the number of gifts of the Spirit, since the holy prayers are from the Spirit&quot;). In Act 10:9, the decision to include Gentiles among the community of believers, arose from a vision Peter had while praying about noontime.

Early Christians prayed the Psalms (), which have remained the principal part of the canonical hours. By AD 60, we find the Didache recommending that disciples pray the Lord&#x27;s Prayer three times a day; this practice found its way into the canonical hours as well. By the second and third centuries, such Church Fathers as Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Tertullian wrote of the practice of Morning and Evening Prayer, and of the prayers at the third, sixth and ninth hours.

From the time of the early Church, the practice of seven fixed prayer times, being attached to , have been taught; in &quot;Apostolic Tradition&quot;, Hippolytus instructed Christians to pray seven times a day &quot;on rising, at the lighting of the evening lamp, at bedtime, at midnight&quot; and &quot;the third, sixth and ninth hours of the day, being hours associated with Christ&#x27;s Passion.&quot;

In the early church, during the night before every feast, a vigil was kept. The word &quot;Vigils&quot;, at first applied to the Night Office, comes from a Latin source, namely the or nocturnal watches or guards of the soldiers. The night from six o&#x27;clock in the evening to six o&#x27;clock in the morning was divided into four watches or vigils of three hours each, the first, the second, the third, and the fourth vigil. The Night Office is linked to : &quot;At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.&quot;

Christians attended two liturgies on the Lord&#x27;s Day, worshipping communally in both a morning service and evening service, with the purpose of reading the Scriptures and celebrating the Eucharist. Throughout the rest of the week, Christians assembled at the church every day for morning prayer (which became known as &quot;lauds&quot;) and evening prayer (which became known as &quot;vespers&quot;), while praying at the other fixed prayer times privately. In the evening the faithful assembled in the place or church where the feast was to be celebrated and prepared themselves by prayers, readings, and sometimes also by hearing a sermon. Pliny the Younger (63 – ) mentions not only fixed times of prayer by believers, but also specific services—other than the Eucharist—assigned to those times: &quot;they met on a stated day before it was light, and addressed a form of prayer to Christ, as to a divinity ... after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble, to eat in common a harmless meal.&quot; (cf. Lovefeast) This vigil was a regular institution of Christian life and was defended and highly recommended by St. Augustine and St. Jerome.

The Office of the Vigils was a single Office, recited without interruption at midnight. Probably in the fourth century, in order to break the monotony of this long night prayer the custom of dividing it into three parts or Nocturns was introduced. John Cassian in speaking of the solemn Vigils mentions three divisions of this Office.

Around the year 484, the Greek-Cappadocian monk Sabbas the Sanctified began the process of recording the liturgical practices around Jerusalem, while the cathedral and parish rites in the Patriarchate of Constantinople evolved in an entirely different manner. The two major practices were synthesized, commencing in the 8th century, to yield an office of great complexity.

In 525, Benedict of Nursia set out one of the earliest schemes for the recitation of the Psalter at the Office. The Cluniac Reforms of the 11th century renewed an emphasis on liturgy and the canonical hours in the reformed priories of the Order of Saint Benedict, with Cluny Abbey at their head.

===Middle Ages===
As the form of fixed-hour prayer developed in the Christian monastic communities in the East and West, the Offices grew both more elaborate and more complex, but the basic cycle of prayer still provided the structure for daily life in monasteries. By the fourth century, the elements of the canonical hours were more or less established. For secular (non-monastic) clergy and lay people, the fixed-hour prayers were by necessity much shorter, though in many churches, the form of the fixed-hour prayers became a hybrid of secular and monastic practice (sometimes referred to as &#x27;cathedral&#x27; and &#x27;monastic&#x27; models).

====Byzantine Rite====

In the Byzantine Empire, the development of the Divine Services shifted from the area around Jerusalem to Constantinople. In particular, Theodore the Studite ( – ) combined a number of influences from the Byzantine court ritual with monastic practices common in Anatolia, and added thereto a number of hymns composed by himself and his brother Joseph (see for further details).

====Western rites====
In the West, the Rule of Saint Benedict (written in 516) was modeled on his guidelines for the prayers on the customs of the basilicas of Rome. It was he who expounded the concept in Christian prayer of the inseparability of the spiritual life from the physical life. St. Benedict set down the dictum – &quot;Pray and work&quot;. The Order of Saint Benedict began to call the prayers the or &quot;Work of God&quot;.

By the time of Saint Benedict of Nursia, author of the Rule, the monastic Liturgy of the Hours was composed of seven daytime hours and one at night. He associated the practice with Psalm 118/119:164, &quot;Seven times a day I praise you&quot;, and Psalm 118/119:62, &quot;At midnight I rise to praise you&quot;. The fixed-hour prayers came to be known as the &quot;Divine Office&quot; (office coming from , lit., &quot;duty&quot;).

Initially, the term &quot;Matins&quot; from Latin , meaning &quot;of or belonging to the morning&quot;, was applied to the psalms recited at dawn. At first &quot;Lauds&quot; (i.e. praises) derived from the three last psalms in the office (148, 149, 150), in all of which the word is repeated frequently, and to such an extent that originally the word Lauds designated the end, that is to say, these three psalms with the conclusion. The Night Office and Lauds are grouped together as a single canonical hour to form a total of seven canonical hours.

By the fourth century the word &quot;matins&quot; became attached to the prayer originally offered at cockcrow. and, according to the sixth-century &quot;Rule of Saint Benedict&quot;, could be calculated to be the eighth hour of the night (the hour that began at about 2 a.m.). Outside of monasteries few rose at night to pray. The canonical hour of the vigil was said in the morning, followed immediately by lauds, and the name of &quot;matins&quot; replaced that of &quot;vigils&quot;. Gradually the title &quot;Lauds&quot; was applied to the early morning office.

Already well-established by the 9th century in the West, these canonical hours consisted of daily prayer liturgies:
* Matins (nighttime) 
* Lauds (early morning)
* Prime (first hour of daylight)
* Terce (third hour)
* Sext (noon)
* Nones (ninth hour)
* Vespers (sunset evening)
* Compline (end of the day)

The three major hours were Matins, Lauds and Vespers; the minor hours were Terce, Sext, Nones and Compline.

As the Divine Office grew more important in the life of the Church, the rituals became more elaborate. Praying the Office already required various books, such as a Psalter for the psalms, a lectionary to find the assigned Scripture reading for the day, a Bible to proclaim the reading, a hymnal for singing, etc. As parishes grew in the Middle Ages away from cathedrals and basilicas, a more concise way of arranging the hours was needed. So, a sort of list developed called the breviary, which gave the format of the daily office and the texts to be used.

The spread of breviaries eventually reached Rome, where Pope Innocent III extended their use to the Roman Curia. The Franciscans sought a one-volume breviary for their friars to use during travels, so the order adopted the , but substituting the Gallican Psalter for the Roman. The Franciscans gradually spread this breviary throughout Europe. Eventually, Pope Nicholas III adopted the widely used Franciscan breviary to be the breviary used in Rome. By the 14th century, the breviary contained the entire text of the canonical hours.

In general, when modern secular books reference canonical hours in the Middle Ages, these are the equivalent times:
* Vigil (eighth hour of night: 2 a.m.) 
* Matins (a later portion of Vigil, from 3 a.m. to dawn)
* Lauds (dawn; approximately 5 a.m., but varies seasonally)
* Prime (early morning, the first hour of daylight, approximately 6 a.m.)
* Terce (third hour, 9 a.m.)
* Sext (sixth hour, noon)
* Nones (ninth hour, 3 p.m.)
* Vespers (sunset, approximately 6 p.m.)
* Compline (end of the day before retiring, approximately 7 p.m.)

Church bells are tolled at the fixed times of these canonical hours in some Christian traditions as a call to prayer.

== Roman Rite==

In the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, bishops, priests, deacons and the members of the consecrated life are obliged to recite the hours each day, keeping as far as possible to the true time of day, and using the text of the approved liturgical books that apply to them. The laity are encouraged to recite the prayer of the hours.

===Diurnal offices===
The diurnal offices or daytime offices (Ecclesiastical Latin: ) are the canonical hours during the day. Interpretation of their number and identity varies.

The monastic rule drawn up by Benedict of Nursia ( – ) distinguishes between the seven daytime canonical hours of lauds (dawn), prime (sunrise), terce (mid-morning), sext (midday), none (mid-afternoon), Vespers (sunset), compline (retiring) and the nighttime canonical hour of vigil. It links the seven daytime offices with Psalm 118/119:164 (&quot;Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous rules&quot;), and the one nighttime office with Psalm 118/119:62 (&quot;At midnight I rise to praise you, because of your righteous rules&quot;).

In this reckoning, the one nocturnal office, together with Lauds and Vespers, are the three major hours; the other five are the minor or little hours.

According to Dwight E. Vogel, Daniel James Lula and Elizabeth Moore the diurnal offices are Terce, Sext, and Nones, which are distinguished from the major hours of Matins, Lauds and Vespers and from the nighttime hours of Compline and Vigil.

=== Revisions===
The Council of Trent, in its final session on 4 December 1563, entrusted the reform of the Breviary to the Pope. On 9 July 1568, Pope Pius V, the successor of the pope who closed the Council of Trent, promulgated an edition, known as the Roman Breviary, with his Apostolic Constitution , imposing it in the same way in which, two years later, he imposed his Roman Missal. Later popes altered the Roman Breviary of Pope Pius V. Pope Pius XII began reforming the Roman Breviary, allowing use of a new translation of the psalms and establishing a special commission to study a general revision, with a view to which all the bishops were consulted in 1955. His successor, Pope John XXIII, made a further revision in 1960.

===Second Vatican Council revisions===
Following the Second Vatican Council, the Catholic Church&#x27;s Roman Rite simplified the observance of the canonical hours and sought to make them more suited to the needs of today&#x27;s apostolate and accessible to the laity, hoping to restore their character as the prayer of the entire Church.

The council abolished the office of Prime, and envisioned a manner of distributing the psalms over a period of more than 1 week. The Roman breviary is published under the title . A translation is published by Catholic Book Publishing Corp. under the title &quot;The Liturgy of the Hours&quot; in four volumes, arranged according to the seasons of the liturgical year.

The current liturgical books for the celebration of the hours in Latin are those of the (second typical edition) promulgated in 1985. The official title is .

====Official English translations====
* &quot;The Divine Office&quot; is translated by a commission set up by the Episcopal Conferences of England and Wales, Australia and Ireland. First published in 1974 by HarperCollins, this edition is the English edition approved for use the above countries, as well as many Asian and African dioceses.
* Catholic Truth Society published Prayer During the Day in 2009.
* The &quot;Liturgy of the Hours&quot; is translated by the International Commission on English in the Liturgy (ICEL). First published in 1975 by Catholic Book Publishing Company in the US, this edition is the English edition approved for use in the US, Canada and several other English-speaking dioceses.

===Current practice===
After the Second Vatican Council, which decided that the hour of Prime should be suppressed, as it was perceived as duplicating Lauds, Pope Paul VI decreed a new arrangement of the Liturgy of the Hours. It has, however, been revived in the Daily Office prayed by the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham and the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross.

The major hours consist of the Matins (or Office of Readings), Lauds and Vespers. The character of Lauds is that of praise, of Vespers, that of thanksgiving. The Office of Readings has the character of reflection on the day that is past and preparing the soul for its passage to eternal life. In each office, the psalms and canticle are framed by antiphons.

== Byzantine Rite usage ==

=== Historical development ===
Because the Rite of Constantinople evolved as a synthesis of two distinct rites – cathedral rite of Constantinople called the (&quot;sung services&quot;) and the monastic typicon of the Holy Lavra of Saint Sabbas the Sanctified near Jerusalem – its offices are highly developed and quite complex.

=== Local variations ===
Two main strata exist in the rite, those places that have inherited the traditions of the Russian Church which had been given only the monastic which is used to this day in parishes and cathedrals as well as in monasteries, and everywhere else where some remnant of the cathedral rite remained in use; therefore, the rite as practiced in monasteries everywhere resembles the Russian recension, while non-Russian non-monastic customs differs significantly. For example, in the Russian tradition, the &quot;all-night vigil&quot; is served in every church on Saturday nights and the eves of feast days (although it may be abridged to be as short as two hours) while elsewhere, it is usual to have Matins on the morning of the feast; however, in the latter instance, Vespers and matins are rather less abridged but the Divine Liturgy commences at the end of matins and the hours are not read, as was the case in the extinct cathedral rite of Constantinople.

Also, as the rite evolved in sundry places, different customs arose; an essay on some of these has been written by Archbishop Basil Krivoshein and is posted on the web.

=== Liturgical books ===
The (; Church Slavonic: , ), or &quot;Book of Hours&quot;, provides the fixed portions of the Daily Cycle of services (, ) as used by the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches.

Into this fixed framework, numerous moveable parts of the service are inserted. These are taken from a variety of liturgical books:
* Psalter (Greek: , ; Slavonic: or , ) A book containing the 150 Psalms divided into 20 sections called Kathismata together with the nine Biblical canticles which are chanted at Matins; although these canticles had been chanted in their entirety, having over time come to be supplemented by interspersed hymns (analogously to stichera) to form the Canon, the canticles themselves are now only regularly used in a few large monasteries. The Psalter also contains the various &quot;selected psalms&quot;, each composed of verses from a variety of psalms, sung at matins on feast days, as well as tables for determining which Kathismata are to be read at each service; in addition to the Psalms read at the daily offices, all the Psalms are read each week and, during Great Lent, twice a week.
* (Greek: ; Slavonic: or )—Literally, the Book of the &quot;Eight Tones&quot; or modes. This book contains a cycle of eight weeks, one for each of the eight echoi (church modes of the Byzantine musical system of eight modes), providing texts for each day of the week for Vespers, Matins, Compline, and (on Sundays) the Midnight Office. The origins of this book go back to compositions by St. John Damascene.
* (Greek: ; Slavonic: , )—A twelve-volume set which provides liturgical texts for each day of the calendar year, printed as 12 volumes, one for each month of the year. Another volume, the &quot;General&quot; contains propers for each class of saints for use when the propers for a particular saint are not available. Additionally, locally venerated saints may have services in supplemental volumes, pamphlets, or manuscripts.
* A collection of the lives of the saints and commentaries on the meaning of feasts for each day of the calendar year, also printed as 12 volumes, appointed to be read at the meal in monasteries and, when there is an all-night vigil for a feast day, between Vespers and Matins.
* (Greek: , ; Slavonic: , ; Romanian: ), also called the Lenten . The Lenten contains propers for:
** the Pre-Lenten Season
** the Forty Days of Great Lent itself
** Lazarus Saturday and Palm Sunday
** Holy Week
* (Greek: , ; Slavonic: , , literally &quot;Flowery Triodon&quot;; Romanian: ) This volume contains the propers for the period from Pascha to the Sunday of All Saints. This period can be broken down into the following periods:
** Bright Week (Easter Week) Commencing with matins on Pascha (Easter Sunday) through the following Saturday
** Paschal Season—The period from Thomas Sunday until Ascension
** Ascension and its Afterfeast
** Pentecost and its Afterfeast
** All Saints Sunday (the Sunday after Pentecost)
* (Greek: ; Romanian: )—The contains for each day of the year brief lives of the saints and meanings of celebrated feasts, appointed to be read after the and at Matins.
* (Greek: ; Slavonic: , )—Contains the chanted at the Canon of Matins and other services.
* Priest&#x27;s Service Book (Greek: , ; Slavonic: , )—Contain the portions of the services which are said by the priest and deacon and is given to a deacon and to a priest with his vestments at ordination.
* Bishop&#x27;s Service Book (Greek: , Slavonic: , ) the portions of the services which are said by the Bishop; for the Canonical Hours, this differs little from what is in the Priest&#x27;s Service Book.
* Gospel Book (Greek: , ) Book containing the 4 Gospels laid out as read at the divine services.
* Apostle Book (Greek: , ; Slavonic: , ) Contains the readings for the Divine Liturgy from the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles together with the and Alleluia verses that are chanted with the readings.
* Patristic writings Many writings from the Church fathers are prescribed to be read at matins and, during great lent, at the hours; in practice, this is only done in some monasteries and frequently therein the abbot prescribes readings other than those in the written rubrics. therefore it is not customary to enumerate all the volumes required for this.
* Collections (Greek: , ; Slavonic: , ) There are numerous smaller anthologies available which were quite common before the invention of printing but still are in common use both because of the enormous volume of a full set of liturgical texts and because the full texts have not yet been translated into several languages currently in use.
* (Greek: , ; Slavonic: , or , ) Contains all of the rules for the performance of the Divine Services, giving directions for every possible combination of the materials from the books mentioned above into the Daily Cycle of Services.

===Liturgical cycles===
Various cycles of the liturgical year influence the manner in which the materials from the liturgical books (above) are inserted into the daily services:

==== Weekly Cycle ====
Each day of the week has its own commemoration:
* &quot;Sunday&quot;—Resurrection of Christ
* &quot;Monday&quot;—The Holy Angels
* &quot;Tuesday&quot;—St. John the Forerunner
* &quot;Wednesday&quot;—The Cross and the 
* &quot;Thursday&quot;—The Holy Apostles and St. Nicholas
* &quot;Friday&quot;—The Cross
* &quot;Saturday&quot;—All Saints and the departed

Most of the texts come from the , which has a large collections of hymns for each weekday for each of the eight tones; during great lent and, to a lesser degree, the pre-lenten season, the supplements this with hymns for each day of the week for each week of that season, as does the during the pascal season. Also, there are fixed texts for each day of the week are in the and &quot;Priest&#x27;s Service Book&quot; (e.g., dismissals) and the Kathismata (selections from the &quot;Psalter&quot;) are governed by the weekly cycle in conjunction with the season.

==== Fixed Cycle ====
Commemorations on the Fixed Cycle depend upon the day of the calendar year, and also, occasionally, specific days of the week that fall near specific calendar dates, e.g., the Sunday before the Exaltation of the Cross. The texts for this cycle are found in the .

==== Paschal Cycle ====
The commemorations on the Paschal Cycle (Moveable Cycle) depend upon the date of Pascha (Easter). The texts for this cycle are found in the , the , the and also, because the daily Epistle and Gospel readings are determined by this cycle, the &quot;Gospel Book&quot; and &quot;Apostle Book&quot;. The cycle of the continues through the following Great Lent, so the variable parts of the lenten services are determined by both the preceding year&#x27;s and the current year&#x27;s dates of Easter.

===== 8 Week Cycle of the Octoechos =====
The cycle of the eight Tones is found in the and is dependent on the date of Easter and commences with the Sunday after (eighth day of) Easter, that week using the first tone, the next week using the second tone, and so, repeating through the week preceding the subsequent Palm Sunday.

===== 11 Week Cycle of the Matins Gospels =====
The portions of each of the Gospels from the narration of the Resurrection through the end are divided into eleven readings which are read on successive Sundays at matins; there are hymns sung at Matins that correspond with that day&#x27;s Matins Gospel.

=== Daily cycle of services ===
The Daily Cycle begins with Vespers and proceeds throughout the night and day according to the following table:

The Typica is served whenever the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated at its usual time, i.e., when there is a vesperal Liturgy or no Liturgy at all. On days when the Liturgy may be celebrated at its usual hour, the Typica follows the sixth hour (or Matins, where the custom is to serve the Liturgy then) and the Epistle and Gospel readings for the day are read therein; otherwise, on aliturgical days or when the Liturgy is served at vespers, the Typica has a much shorter form and is served between the ninth hour and vespers.

Also, there are Inter-Hours for the First, Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours. These are services of a similar structure to, but briefer than, the hours. their usage varies with local custom, but generally they are used only during the Nativity Fast, Apostles Fast, and Dormition Fast on days when the lenten alleluia replaces &quot;God is the Lord&quot; at matins, which may be done at the discretion of the ecclesiarch when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated.

In addition to these public prayers, there are also private prayers prescribed for both monastics and laypersons; in some monasteries, however, these are read in church. These include Morning and Evening Prayers and prayers (and, in Russia, canons) to be prayed in preparation for receiving the Eucharist.

The full cycle of services are usually served only in monasteries, cathedrals, and other . In monasteries and parishes of the Russian tradition, the Third and Sixth Hours are read during the Prothesis (Liturgy of Preparation); otherwise, the Prothesis is served during Matins, the final portion of which is omitted, the Liturgy of the Catechumens commencing straightway after the following the Great Doxology.

The Midnight Office is seldom served in parishes churches except at the Paschal Vigil as the essential office wherein the burial shroud is removed from the tomb and carried to the altar.

===Aggregates===
The sundry Canonical Hours are, in practice, grouped together into aggregates so that there are three major times of prayer a day: Evening, Morning and Midday. The most common groupings are as follows:

==== Ordinary days ====
* Evening – Ninth Hour, Vespers, Compline
* Morning Watches – Midnight Office, Matins, First Hour
* Morning – Third Hour, Sixth Hour, and the Divine Liturgy or Typica

==== Weekdays during lent ====
* Evening – Great Compline
* Morning Watches – Midnight Office, Matins, First Hour
* Morning – Third Hour, Sixth Hour, Ninth Hour, Typica, Vespers (sometimes with the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts or, on the Annunciation, the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom)

==== When there is an all-night vigil ====
On the eves before Great Feasts and, in some traditions, on all Sundays, this grouping is used. However, the all-night vigil is usually abridged so as to not last literally &quot;all-night&quot; and may be as short as two hours; on the other hand, on Athos and in the very traditional monastic institutions, that service followed by the hours and Liturgy may last as long as 18 hours.
* Afternoon – Ninth Hour, Little Vespers, Compline (where it is not read at the commencement of the Vigil)
* Early night – Compline (where it is not the custom for it to follow small vespers), Great Vespers, a reading, Matins, First Hour

==== When the royal hours are read ====
* Evening – Ninth Hour, Vespers, Compline
* Morning Watches – Midnight Office, Matins
* Morning – First, Third, Sixth, and Ninth Hours and the Typica

==== On the eves of Christmas, Theophany, and Annunciation ====
When the feast is a weekday (or, in the Russian tradition, on any day for Christmas, Theophany), Vespers (with the Liturgy in most instances) is served earlier in the day and so Great Compline functions much as Great vespers does on the vigils of other feast days.
* Evening – Great Compline (in some traditions) and, if there be an All-Night Vigil, the reading, matins, first hour.
* Morning Watches – (unless there be an all-night vigil) midnight office, matins, first hour.

== Alexandrian Rite ==
The Alexandrian Rite is observed by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and the Coptic Catholic Church. The cycle of canonical hours is largely monastic, primarily composed of psalm readings. The Coptic equivalent of the Byzantine &quot;Horologion&quot; is the Agpeya.

Seven canonical hours exist, corresponding largely to the Byzantine order, with an additional &quot;Prayer of the Veil&quot; which is said by Bishops, Priests, and Monks (something like the Byzantine Midnight Office).

The hours are chronologically laid out, each containing a theme corresponding to events in the life of Jesus Christ:
* &quot;Midnight Praise&quot; (said in the early morning before dawn) commemorates the Second Coming of Christ. It consists of three watches, corresponding to the three stages of Christ&#x27;s prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane ( ).
* Prime (dawn) is said upon waking in the morning or after the Midnight Praise the previous night. Associated with the Eternity of God, the Incarnation of Christ, and his Resurrection from the dead.
* Terce (9 a.m.) commemorates Christ&#x27;s trial before Pilate, the descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.
* Sext (noon) commemorates the Passion of Christ.
:Terce and Sext are prayed before each Divine Liturgy.
* None (3 p.m.) commemorates the death of Christ on the Cross. This hour is also read during fasting days.
* Vespers (sunset) commemorates the taking down of Christ from the Cross.
* Compline (9 p.m. – before bedtime) commemorates the burial of Christ, the Final Judgment.
:Vespers and Compline are both read before the Liturgy during Lent and the Fast of Nineveh.
* The Veil is reserved for bishops, priests and monks, as an examination of conscience.

Every one of the Hours follows the same basic outline:
* Introduction, which includes the Lord&#x27;s Prayer
* Prayer of Thanksgiving
* Psalm 50 (LXX).
* Various Psalms
* An excerpt from the Holy Gospel
* Short Litanies
* Some prayers (Only during Prime and Compline)
* Lord Have Mercy is then chanted 41 times (representing the 39 lashes Christ received before the crucifixion, plus one for the spear in His side, plus one for the crown of thorns)
* Prayer of &quot;Holy Holy Holy...&quot; and Lord&#x27;s Prayer
* Prayer of Absolution
* Prayer of Every Hour

==Syriac rites==
=== East Syriac Rite ===

The East Syriac Rite (also known as the Chaldean, Assyrian, or Persian Rite) has historically been used in Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia, and Malabar. The nucleus of the Daily Office is mainly of course the recitation of the Psalter. There are usually seven regular hours of service;
the following are the times of prayer:

* Ramsha (ܪܲܡܫܵܐ) or &quot;the Evening Liturgy&quot; (6 pm)
* Suba-a (ܣܘܼܒܵܥܵܐ) or &quot;the Supper Liturgy&quot; (9 pm)
* Lelya (ܠܸܠܝܵܐ) or &quot;the Night Liturgy&quot; (12 am)
* Qala d-Shahra ( ܩܵܠܵܐ ܕܫܲܗܪܵ ) or &quot;the Vigil Liturgy&quot; (3 am), a rarely used
* Sapra (ܨܲܦܪܵܐ) or &quot;the Morning Liturgy&quot; (6 am) 
* Quta&#x27;a (ܩܘܼܛܵܥܵܐ) or &quot;the Third Hour Liturgy&quot; (9 am)
* Endana (ܥܸܕܵܢܵܐ) or &quot;the Noon Liturgy&quot; (12 pm)

When East Syriac monasteries existed (which is no longer the case) seven hours of prayer were the custom in them, and three &quot;hulali&quot; (sections) of the Psalter were recited at each service. This would accomplish the unique feat of the common recitation of the entire Psalter each day.

The present arrangement provides for seven &quot;hulali&quot; at each ferial night service, ten on Sundays, three on &quot;Memorials&quot;, and the whole Psalter on Feasts of the Lord. At the evening service there is a selection of from four to seven psalms, varying with the day of the week, and also a &quot;Shuraya&quot;, or short psalm, with generally a portion of Psalm 118, varying with the day of the fortnight. At the morning service the invariable psalms are 109, 90, 103:1–6, 112, 92, 148, 150, 116. On ferias and &quot;Memorials&quot; Psalm 146 is said after Psalm 148, and on ferias Psalm 1:1–18, comes at the end of the psalms.

The rest of the services consist of prayers, antiphons, litanies, and verses (&quot;giyura&quot;) inserted—like the Greek stichera, but more extensively—between verses of psalms. On Sundays the Gloria in Excelsis and Benedicte are said instead of Psalm 146. Both morning and evening services end with several prayers, a blessing, (&quot;Khuthama&quot;, &quot;Sealing&quot; ), the kiss of peace, and the Creed.

The variables, besides the psalms, are those of the feast or day, which are very few, and those of the day of the fortnight. These fortnights consist of weeks called &quot;Before&quot; (&quot;Qdham&quot;) and &quot;After&quot; (&quot;Wathar&quot;), according to which of the two choirs begins the service. Hence the book of the Divine Office is called &quot;Qdham u wathar&quot;, or at full length &quot;Kthawa daqdham wadhwathar&quot;, the &quot;Book of Before and After&quot;.

The East Syriac liturgical Calendar is unique. The year is divided into periods of about seven weeks each, called &quot;Shawu&#x27;i&quot;; these are Advent (called &quot;Subara&quot;, &quot;Annunciation&quot;), Epiphany, Lent, Easter, the Apostles, Summer, &quot;Elias and the Cross&quot;, &quot;Moses&quot;, and the &quot;Dedication&quot; (&quot;Qudash idta&quot;). &quot;Moses&quot; and the &quot;Dedication&quot; have only four weeks each. The Sundays are generally named after the &quot;Shawu&#x27;a&quot; in which they occur, &quot;Fourth Sunday of Epiphany&quot;, &quot;Second Sunday of the Annunciation &quot;, etc., though sometimes the name changes in the middle of a &quot;Shawu&#x27;a&quot;. Most of the &quot;Memorials&quot; (&quot;dukhrani&quot;), or saints&#x27; days, which have special lections, occur on the Fridays between Christmas and Lent, and are therefore movable feasts; but some, such as Christmas, Theophany, the Dormition, and about thirty smaller days without proper readings, are on fixed days.

There are four shorter fasting periods besides the Great Lent; these are:
* the &quot;Fast of Mar Zaya&quot; (three days after the second Sunday of the Nativity)
* the &quot;Fast of the Virgins&quot; (after the first Sunday of the Epiphany)
* the &quot;Fast of the Ninevites&quot; (seventy days before Easter)
* the &quot;Fast of Mart Mariam&quot; (Our Lady) (from the first to the fourteenth of August)

The Fast of the Ninevites commemorates the repentance of Nineveh at the preaching of Jonah, and is carefully kept. Those of Mar Zaya and the Virgins are nearly obsolete. The Malabar Rite has largely adopted the Roman Calendar, and several Roman days have been added to that of the Chaldean Catholics. The Chaldean Easter coincides with that of the Eastern Orthodox Church, as the Julian Calendar is used to calculate Easter. The years are numbered, not from the birth of Christ, but from the Seleucid era (year 1 = 311 B.C.).

=== West Syriac Rite ===

The West Syriac Rite, used in India and Syria by the Indian Orthodox and Syriac Orthodox (Jacobites), as well as Syriac and Maronite Catholics, is in its origin simply the old rite of Antioch in the Syriac language. The translation must have been made very early, evidently before the division in the church over Chalcedon, before the influence of Constantinople over the Antiochian Rite had begun. No doubt as soon as Christian communities arose in the rural areas of Syria the prayers which in the cities (Antioch, Jerusalem, etc.) were said in Greek, were, as a matter of course, translated into Syriac for common use.

In accordance with Psalm 119:164, &quot;Seven times in the day have I praised Thee for Thy judgments, O Righteous One,&quot; the Syriac Orthodox Church observes seven services of prayer each day:
* Evening or &quot;Ramsho&quot; prayer (Vespers)
* Drawing of the Veil or &quot;Sootoro&quot;, meaning &quot;Protection&quot;, from Psalm 91, which is sung at this prayer, &quot;He who sits under the protection of the Most High&quot; (Compline)
* Midnight or &quot;Lilyo&quot; prayer (Matins)
* Morning or &quot;Saphro&quot; prayer (Prime, 6 a.m.)
* Third Hour or &quot;Tloth sho&#x27;in&quot; prayer (Terce, 9 a.m.)
* Sixth Hour or &quot;Sheth sho&#x27;in&quot; prayer (Sext, noon)
* Ninth Hour or &quot;Tsha&#x27; sho&#x27;in&quot; prayer (None, 3 p.m.)

The Midnight prayer (Matins) consists of three &quot;qawme&quot; or &quot;watches&quot; (literally &quot;standings&quot;). As in other traditional rites, the ecclesiastical day begins in the evening at sunset with Vespers (&quot;Ramsho&quot;). Today, even in monasteries, the services are grouped together: Vespers and Compline are said together; Matins and Prime are said together; and the Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours are said together; resulting in three times of prayer each day.

The Syriac Orthodox Book of Hours is called the Shehimo, &quot;simple prayer&quot;. The &quot;Shehimo&quot; has offices for the canonical hours for each day of the week. Each canonical office begins and ends with a &quot;qawmo&quot;, a set of prayers that includes the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. At the end of the office, the Nicene Creed is recited. The great part of the office consists of lengthy liturgical poems composed for the purpose, similar to the Byzantine odes.

In the Maronite eparchies of the United States, the breviary commonly used is called the ‘’Prayer of the Faithful’’. This is a three-volume set that is divided up by the liturgical year: Vol. I for the Sundays of the Church, Seasons of Announcement and Birth of Our Lord, Epiphany, and Three Weeks of Commemoration; Vol. II for Great Lent and Eastertide; Vol. III for Pentecost through Season of the Holy Cross. This edition is rather simplified, containing only the offices of Ramsho, Sootoro, and Safro.

== Armenian Rite ==
The Daily Services in the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Armenian Catholic Church are made up of nine services. The daily cycle of prayer begins with the Night Service, according to the ancient belief that a new day begins at nightfall.

The Night Service (midnight) Dedicated to the praising of God the Father. Themes of the service are: thanksgiving to God for the blessing of sleep and asking that the remainder of the night pass in peace and tranquility, and that the next day be spent in purity and righteousness.

The Morning Service (dawn) Dedicated to the praising of God the Son. Symbolizes the Resurrection of Christ and his appearance to the Myrrh-bearing Women.

The Sunrise Service (6:00 a.m.) Dedicated to the praising of the Holy Spirit. Symbolizes the appearance to Christ to the disciples after the Resurrection.

The Third Hour (9:00 a.m.) Dedicated to the Holy Spirit. Symbolizes Eve&#x27;s original tasting the forbidden fruit and eventual liberation from condemnation through Jesus Christ. The service has a profound penitential meaning.

The Sixth Hour (noon) Dedicated to God the Father. Symbolizes Christ&#x27;s Crucifixion. The prayers at the service ask for God&#x27;s help towards feeble human nature.

The Ninth Hour (3:00 p.m.) Dedicated to God the Son. Symbolizes Christ&#x27;s death and liberation of humanity from the power of the Hell.

The Evening Service (before sunset) Dedicated to God the Son. Symbolizes Christ&#x27;s burial, asks God for a quiet night and a peaceful sleep.

The Peace Service (after sunset) Dedicated to the Holy Spirit. Symbolizes Christ&#x27;s descent into Hell and liberation of the righteous from torments.

The Rest Service (before retiring for sleep) Dedicated to God the Father. In early times it was the continuation of the Peace Service.

In ancient times all nine services were offered every day, especially in monasteries. At present the following services are conducted in churches daily for the majority of the year:
* In the morning: Night and Morning Services together
* In the evening: Evening Service

During Great Lent, all of the services are offered on weekdays (except Saturday and Sunday) according to the following schedule:
* In the morning: Night, Morning and Sunrise Services
* In the afternoon: Third, Sixth, Ninth Hours
* In the evening:
** Monday, Tuesday, Thursday: Peace Service
** Wednesday, Friday: Rest Service
** Saturday, Sunday: Evening Service

The book which contains the hymns which constitute the substance of the musical system of Armenian liturgical chant is the &quot;Sharagnots&quot; (see Armenian Octoechos), a collection of hymns known as &quot;Sharakan&quot;. Originally, these hymns were Psalms and biblical Canticles that were chanted during the services, similar to the Byzantine Canon. In addition, the eight modes are applied to the psalms of the Night office, called &quot;ganonaklookh&quot; (Canon head).

==Protestantism==
=== Lutheran Rite ===
Like the Mass (liturgy) itself, the Daily Office within the Lutheran Church has had considerable variety, in both language and form. In the Reformation era, the Daily Office was largely consolidated into Matins, Vespers, and sometimes Compline, though there are notable exceptions. The &quot;Missale Germanicum&quot; of 1568, for example, simply translated the pre-Reformation breviary into German, retaining all of the canonical hours. The 1613 &quot;Cantica Sacra&quot; of the Magdeburg Cathedral, on the other hand, provides for Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline to be sung in Latin every day of the year, including plainsong melodies and text for Latin invitatories, responsories, and antiphons provided. As a result, a rural Lutheran parish church in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries might pray Saturday Vespers, Sunday Matins, and Sunday Vespers in the vernacular, while the nearby cathedral and city churches could be found praying the eight canonical hours in Latin with polyphony and Gregorian chant on a daily basis throughout the year.

The advent of Pietism and Rationalism led to a disdain for and a decline in the observation of liturgies of every sort in Lutheran Germany, including the Daily Office, as described in Paul Graff&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte der Auflösung der alten gottesdienstlichen Formen in der evangelischen Kirche Deutschlands&quot;. Despite the disdain of these movements for the Daily Office, a Latin choir hymnal was published in Nuremberg as late as 1724, and weekday observations of Matins and Vespers continued in many German Lutheran parishes until the end of the 18th century.

A renewal in the Daily Office took place in the nineteenth century as a part of the confessional revival among Lutherans, particularly as a result of the work of such figures as Johann Konrad Wilhelm Löhe. Among English-speaking Lutherans in North America, this influence helped give rise to traditional forms of Matins and Vespers, based on sixteenth century Lutheran precedents, found in the &quot;Common Service of 1888&quot;, which were then included in English-language Lutheran hymnals in America prior to the 1970s. In 1969, the &quot;Worship Supplement&quot; of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod reintroduced the offices of Prime, Sext, and Compline, though only Compline was retained in subsequent hymnals.

In 1978, the Lutheran Book of Worship was published, containing newly revised forms of the Daily Office influenced by liturgical reforms in vogue following the Second Vatican Council, with an order of Evening Prayer that includes a &quot;Service of Light&quot;. Both the 2006 &quot;Lutheran Service Book&quot; of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the 2006 &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Worship&quot; of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America provide forms of the modern Daily Office rites introduced in &quot;Lutheran Book of Worship&quot;, though &quot;Lutheran Service Book&quot; also provides traditional forms of Matins and Vespers patterned on those found in the &quot;Common Service of 1888&quot;.

Today, in addition to denominational hymnals, there are a variety of books and resources used by Lutherans around the world to pray the hours. In Germany, the Diakonie Neuendettelsau religious institute uses a breviary unique to the order, and the Evangelisch-Lutherische Gebetsbruderschaft uses its &quot;Breviarium Lipsiensae: Tagzeitengebete&quot;. Among English-speaking Lutherans in the United States, the twentieth century saw a proliferation in breviaries and prayer books alongside renewed interest in praying the canonical hours. Among the volumes presently in use is a translation of the &quot;Breviarum Lipsiensae: Tagzeitengebete&quot;, entitled &quot;The Brotherhood Prayer Book&quot;, which provides for eight canonical hours and includes a psalter, responsories, and antiphons set to Gregorian chant. It is largely used by clergy and laity within the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. &quot;For All the Saints: A Prayer Book for and by the Church&quot; was published in 1995, and follows the daily lectionary of the 1978 &quot;Lutheran Book of Worship&quot;, providing three scriptural readings and a non-Scriptural reading from a Christian theologian or source for each day of the year in a two year cycle. In 2008, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod published &quot;The Treasury of Daily Prayer&quot;, the only current denominational effort among Lutherans to reinvigorate the observation of the Daily Office. For each day, it provides a psalm (or a portion thereof), an Old Testament reading, a New Testament reading, a writing from a Christian theologian or writer, a hymn stanza, and a collect. In a further effort to encourage widespread use of the Daily Office, the &quot;Treasury of Daily Prayer&quot; has also been made available as a mobile app called &quot;PrayNow&quot;.

=== Anglican usage ===

The daily offices have always had an important place in Anglican spirituality. Until comparatively recently Mattins and Evensong were the principal Sunday services in most Anglican churches, sung to settings by composers both ancient and modern. While Evensong with its musical repertory spanning five centuries continues to play an important role in Anglican worship, the eucharist has replaced Morning Prayer as the principal service on Sunday mornings in most Anglican parishes and cathedrals.

The &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, first published in 1549 and revised down the centuries, constitutes the basis of the liturgy for Anglicans and Anglican Use Roman Catholics. All Anglican prayer books provide offices for Morning Prayer (often called Mattins or Matins) and Evening Prayer (colloquially known as Evensong).

The traditional structure of Matins and Evensong in most Anglican prayer books reflects the intention by the reforming Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, to return to the office&#x27;s older roots as the daily prayer of parish churches. For this purpose, he followed some German Lutheran liturgies in eliminating the lesser hours and conflating the medieval offices of Matins and Lauds, while incorporating the canticles associated with each: the Benedictus and Te Deum. Similarly, Evening Prayer, also derived from German Lutheran liturgies, incorporated both the Magnificat from Vespers and the Nunc Dimittis from Compline. In Cranmer&#x27;s adaptation of preceding Lutheran forms, each canticle was preceded by a reading from scripture. For the sake of simplicity, Cranmer also eliminated responsories and antiphons, although these have been restored in many contemporary Anglican prayer books. Since his time, every edition of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; has included the complete psalter, usually arranged to be read over the course of a month. One distinctive contribution of Anglican worship is a broad repertory of Anglican Chant settings for the psalms and canticles.

Since the early 20th century, revised editions of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; or supplemental service books published by Anglican churches have often added offices for midday prayer and Compline. In England and other Anglican provinces, service books now include four offices:
* Morning Prayer, corresponding to Matins and Lauds.
* Prayer During the Day, conflating the lesser hours of Terce, Sext, and None.
* Evening Prayer, corresponding to Vespers.
* Night Prayer, or Compline.

Some prayer books also include a selection of prayers and devotions specifically for family use. The 1979 &quot;Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church in the U.S.&quot; also provides an &quot;Order of Worship for the Evening&quot; as a prelude to Evensong with blessings for the lighting of candles and the singing of the ancient Greek lamp-lighting hymn, the Phos Hilaron. In the Church of England, the publication in 2005 of &quot;Daily Prayer&quot;, the third volume of &quot;Common Worship&quot;, adds &quot;Prayer During the Day&quot; to the services for Morning Prayer, Evening Prayer, and Compline, and adds a selection of antiphons and responsories for the seasons of the Church Year. The 1989 &quot;New Zealand Prayer Book&quot; provides different outlines for Mattins and Evensong on each day of the week, as well as &quot;Midday Prayer&quot;, &quot;Night Prayer&quot;, and &quot;Family Prayer&quot;. In 1995, the Episcopal Church (United States) published the &quot;Contemporary Office Book&quot; in one volume with the complete psalter and all readings from the two-year Daily Office lectionary.

Most Anglican monastic communities use a Daily Office based on the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; or on &quot;Common Worship&quot; but with additional antiphons and devotions. The Order of the Holy Cross and Order of St. Helena published &quot;A Monastic Breviary&quot; (Wilton, Conn.: Morehouse-Barlow) in 1976. The Order of St. Helena published the &quot;St. Helena Breviary&quot; (New York: Church Publishing) in 2006 with a revised psalter eliminating male pronouns in reference to God. The All Saints Sisters of the Poor also use an elaborated version of the Anglican Daily Office. The Society of St. Francis publishes &quot;Celebrating Common Prayer&quot;, which has become especially popular for use among Anglicans.

Some Anglo-Catholics use the Anglican Breviary, an adaptation of the Pre-Vatican II Roman Rite and the Sarum Rite in the style of Cranmer&#x27;s original &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, along with supplemental material from other western sources, including a common of Octaves, a common of Holy Women, and other material. It provides for the eight historical offices in one volume, but does not include the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which was bound along with many editions of the &quot;Breviarium Romanum&quot;. Other Anglo-Catholics use the Roman Catholic &quot;Liturgy of the Hours&quot; (US) or &quot;Divine Office&quot; (UK). Various Anglican adaptations of pre-Vatican II Roman office-books have appeared over the years, among the best known being Canon W. Douglas&#x27; translation of the &#x27;Monastic Diurnal&#x27; into the idiom of the &#x27;Book of Common Prayer&#x27;.

Historically, Anglican clergy have vested in cassock, surplice, and tippet for Morning and Evening Prayer, while bishops wear the rochet and chimere. In some monastic communities and Anglo-Catholic parishes, the officiant wears a surplice or an alb with stole and cope when Evensong is celebrated solemnly.

The canons of the Church of England and some other Anglican provinces require clergy to read Morning and Evening Prayer daily, either in public worship or privately. According to Canon C.24, &quot;Every priest having a cure of souls shall provide that, in the absence of reasonable hindrance, Morning and Evening Prayer daily and on appointed days the Litany shall be said in the church, or one of the churches, of which he is the minister.&quot; Canon C.26 stipulates that, &quot;Every clerk (cleric) in Holy Orders is under obligation, not being let (prevented) by sickness or some other urgent cause, to say daily the Morning and Evening Prayer...&quot; In other Anglican provinces, the Daily Office is not a canonical obligation but is strongly encouraged.

=== Methodist usage ===

F. W. Macdonald, the biographer of The Rt. Rev. John Fletcher Hurst, stated that Oxford Methodism &quot;with its almost monastic rigors, its living by rule, its canonical hours of prayer, is a fair and noble phase of the many-sided life of the Church of England&quot;.

The traditional 1784 Methodist Daily Office is contained in &quot;The Sunday Service of the Methodists&quot;, which was written by John Wesley himself. It was consequently updated in the &quot;Book of Offices&quot;, published in 1936 in Great Britain, and &quot;The United Methodist Book of Worship&quot;, published in 1992 in the United States. Some Methodist religious orders publish the Daily Office to be used for that community, for example, &quot;The Book of Offices and Services of The Order of Saint Luke&quot; contains Morning, Mid-Morning, Noon, Mid-Afternoon, Evening, Compline and Vigil.

Certain Methodist parishes, such as Saint Paul&#x27;s Free Methodist Church, offer a daily corporate praying of the canonical hours at church.

=== Reformed usage ===
Some Reformed churches—notably the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the United Church of Christ—have published daily office books adapted from the ancient structure of morning and evening prayer in the Western church, usually revised for the purpose of inclusive language.

&quot;The New Century Psalter&quot;, published in 1999 by The Pilgrim Press, includes an inclusive-language revision of the psalms adapted from the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible with refrains and complete orders for Morning and Evening Prayer. Simple family prayers for morning, evening and the close of day are also provided.

&quot;Book of Common Worship Daily Prayer&quot;, published in 1994 by Westminster John Knox Press, includes the daily offices from The Book of Common Worship of 1993, the liturgy of the Presbyterian Church USA. In addition to Morning and Evening Prayer there is a complete service for Compline. Its psalter—an inclusive-language revision of the psalter from the 1979 American Book of Common Prayer—also includes a collect for each psalm. Antiphons and litanies are provided for the seasons of the church year. A new &quot;Book of Common Worship Daily Prayer&quot; with expanded content was published in 2018. It adds a service for Mid-Day Prayer. Its new psalter is from Evangelical Lutheran Worship.

Both books are intended for ecumenical use and can be used with any daily lectionary.

=== Anabaptism ===
In Anabaptist Christianity, Mennonites (especially Old Order Mennonites and Conservative Mennonites) and Amish have family prayer every morning and evening, which is done kneeling; the &quot;Christenpflicht&quot; prayer book is used for this purpose. Bible readings may be read after this, often after the evening prayer; to this end, the &quot;Tägliches Manna&quot; devotional is used by many Anabaptists.

== Liberal Catholic usage ==
The Liberal Catholic Church, and many groups in the Liberal Catholic movement, also use a simple version of the Western canonical hours, said with various scripture reading and collects. According to the &quot;Liturgy of the Liberal Catholic Church,&quot; the Scriptures used are generally limited to the readings of the day, and the complete psalter is not incorporated unless at the discretion of the priest presiding, if as a public service, or of the devotee in private use. The Hours of the Liberal Rite consist of: Lauds, Prime, Sext, Vespers, and Compline. Its recitation is not obligatory on Liberal Catholic priests or faithful, according to current directs from the General Episcopal Synod.

<doc id="203689" wikidata="Q7676689" url="?curid=203689" title="Kra–Dai-speaking peoples">
<text>The term Kra–Dai peoples or Kra–Dai-speaking peoples refers collectively to the ethnic groups of southern China and Southeast Asia, stretching from Hainan to Northeast India and from southern Sichuan to Laos, Thailand and parts of Vietnam, who not only speak languages belonging to the Kra–Dai language family, but also share similar traditions, culture and ancestry.

==Origin==
Chamberlain (2016) proposes that the Kra–Dai language family was formed as early as the 12th century BCE in the middle of the Yangtze basin, coinciding roughly with the establishment of the Chu state and the beginning of the Zhou dynasty. Following the southward migrations of Kra and Hlai (Rei/Li) peoples around the 8th century BCE, the Yue (Be-Tai people) started to break away and move to the east coast in the present-day Zhejiang province, in the 6th century BCE, forming the state of Yue and conquering the state of Wu shortly thereafter. According to Chamberlain, Yue people (Be-Tai) began to migrate southwards along the east coast of China to what are now Guangxi, Guizhou and northern Vietnam, after Yue was conquered by Chu around 333 BCE. There the Yue (Be-Tai) formed the Luo Yue, which moved into Lingnan and Annam and then westward into northeastern Laos and Sip Song Chau Tai, and later became the Central-Southwestern Tai, followed by the Xi Ou, which became the Northern Tai). 

Tao et. al (2023), however, suggests that the Kra-Dai language family originated from coastal south China, around the Fujian, Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, and underwent a radial expansion into the Guizhou-Yunnan region, Hainan Island, and Mainland Southeast Asia. This language dispersal might also be associated with environmental change and demographic changes.

Kra–Dai peoples are thought to originate from Taiwan, where they spoke a dialect of proto-Austronesian or one of its descendant languages. The Kra–Dai-speaking peoples migrated to southern China, where they brought with them the Proto-Kra–Dai language. Like the Malayo-Polynesians, they may originally have been of Austronesian descent. Unlike the Malayo-Polynesian group who later sailed south to the Philippines and other parts of maritime Southeast Asia, the ancestors of the modern Kra–Dai people sailed west to mainland China and possibly traveled along the Pearl River, where their language greatly changed from other Austronesian languages under the influence of Sino-Tibetan and Hmong–Mien language infusion. However, no archaeological evidence has been identified which would correspond to this Daic expansion in its earliest phases. Aside from linguistic evidence, the connection between Austronesian and Kra–Dai can also be found in some common cultural practices. Roger Blench (2008) demonstrates that dental evulsion, face tattooing, teeth blackening and snake cults are shared between the Taiwanese Austronesians and the Kra–Dai peoples of Southern China.

== Linguistic subdivisions ==
There are five established branches of the Kra–Dai languages, which may not directly correspond to ethnicity:
* the Tai peoples of China and much of Southeast Asia (including most notably the Thai, Lao, Isan, Shan and Zhuang, and Saek people of Laos and Thailand)
* the Hlai people and Be people of China, especially on Hainan
* the Kra peoples of China and Vietnam (also known as the Geyan peoples)
* the Kam–Sui peoples (which may or not include the Biao people) in central China

The Lakkia people of Guangxi Autonomous Region of China (&quot;Tai Lakka&quot; in neighboring portions of Vietnam) are ethnically of Yao, but speak a Kra–Dai language called &quot;Lakkia&quot;. These Yao were likely in an area dominated by Tai speakers and assimilated an early Kra–Dai language (possibly the language of the ancestors of the Biao people).
* The Lingao people in Hainan Province of China speak a Kra–Dai language called &quot;Be&quot; or &quot;Lincheng,&quot; although the ethnicity of the Lingao traces back to the Han nationality.

==Geographic distribution==
The Kra-Dai have historically resided in China, continental Southeast Asia and parts of northeastern India since the early Kra-Dai expansion period. Their primary geographic distribution in those countries is roughly in the shape of an arc extending from northeastern India through southern China and down to Southeast Asia. Recent Kra-Dai migrations have brought considerable numbers of Kra-Dai peoples to Japan, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, North America and Argentina as well. The greatest ethnic diversity within the Kra-Dai occurs in China, which is their prehistoric homeland.

The Kra peoples are clustered in the Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hunan and Hainan provinces of China, as well as the Hà Giang, Cao Bằng, Lào Cai and Sơn La provinces of Vietnam.

The Kam–Sui peoples are clustered in China as well as neighboring portions of northern Laos and Vietnam.

===List of Kra–Dai-speaking peoples per country===

====China====
In southern China, people speaking Kra-Dai languages are mainly found in Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hunan, Guangdong, and Hainan. According to statistics from the fourth census taken in China in 1990, the total population of these groups amounted to 23,262,000. Their distribution is as follows:

* Dai (or Tai) have a population of about 19 million, mainly inhabiting Guangxi, Yunnan, Guangdong and parts of Guizhou and Hunan provinces.
* Kam-Sui (Kam-Shui) have a population of about 4 million and live mainly in Hunan, Guizhou, and in Guangxi.
* Kra have a population of about 22,000 and live mostly in Yunnan, Guangxi and Hunan.

==History in China==
In China, Kra–Dai peoples and languages are mainly distributed in a radial area from the western edge of Yunnan Province to Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou Hunan and Hainan Provinces. Most speakers live in compact communities. Some of them are scattered among the Han Chinese or other ethnic minorities. The ancient Baiyue people, who covered a large area in southern China, were their common ancestors.

The use of name &quot;Zhuang&quot; for the Zhuang people today first appeared in a book named &quot;A History of the Local Administration in Guangxi&quot;, written by Fan Chengda during the Southern Song dynasty. From then on, &quot;Zhuang&quot; would usually be seen in Han Chinese historical books together with &quot;Lao&quot;. In Guangxi, until the Ming dynasty, the name &quot;Zhuang&quot; was generally used to refer to those called &quot;Li&quot; (originating from &quot;Wuhu Man&quot;) who lived in compact communities in Guigang (the present name), the &quot;Mountain Lao&quot; in Guilin and the &quot;Tho&quot; in Qinzhou. &quot;According to A History of the Ming Dynasty – Biography of Guangxi Ethnic Minority Hereditary Headman&quot; &quot;In Guangxi, most of the people were the Yaos and the Zhuangs, ...the other small groups were too numerous to mention individually.&quot; Gu Yanwu (a Chinese scholar in the Ming dynasty) gave the correct explanation of this point, saying &quot;The Yao were Jing Man (aborigines from Hunan), and the Zhuang originated from the ancient Yue.&quot;

The word &quot;Zhuang&quot; was the short form of &quot;Buzhuang&quot;, which was the name the ancestors of the Zhuang people living in the northeast of Guangxi, the south of Guizhou and the west of Guangdong used to refer to themselves. Later this name was gradually accepted by those who had different names, and finally became the general name for the whole group (Ni Dabai 1990). &quot;Zhuang&quot; had several variant written forms in the ancient Han historical books.

The Buyi, who lived in Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau since ancient times, were called &quot;Luoyue, Pu, Puyue, Yi, Yipu, Lao, Pulao, Yilai&quot;, etc., in the Qin and Han dynasties. Since the Yuan dynasty, the name &quot;Zhong&quot;, which appeared in the historical book later than &quot;Zhuang&quot; was used to refer to the Buyi. It was originally a variant form of &quot;Zhuang&quot;, referring to both the Zhuang and the Buyi in Yunnan, Guangxi and Guizhou. Later, it referred to the Buyi only, and always appeared in the historical books as &quot;Zhongjia, Zhongmiao,&quot; and &quot;Qingzhong&quot;, until the early 1950s. Like &quot;Zhuang, Zhong&quot; may also be the short form of &quot;Buzhuang&quot;, which &quot;Zhuang&quot; people use to refer to themselves, as the pronunciation of &quot;Zhong&quot; and &quot;Zhuang&quot; is similar, and &quot;Zhong&quot; was once a variant form of &quot;Zhuang&quot; in the Han Chinese historical books. But today, Buyi people never use &quot;Buzhuang or Buzhong&quot; to refer to themselves, therefore, the use of &quot;Zhong&quot; as the name of Buyi may have something to do with the common origin of these two groups of peoples, or the mass migration by Zhuang into Buyi areas (Zhou Guoyan 1996)

Hlai (黎) people living on Hainan island were called &quot;Luoyue&quot; (雒越) during the western Han dynasty. During the period from the Sui to the Tang dynasty, &quot;Li&quot; began to appear in the Han historical books. &quot;Li&quot; (黎) was frequently used in the Song dynasty, and sometimes &quot;Lao&quot; was also used. Fan Chengda wrote in &quot;History of Local Administration in Guangxi&quot;: &quot;On the island (Hainan island) there is a Limu Mountain; different groups of aborigines lived around it, calling themselves Li.&quot;

The Kam lived in compact communities in neighboring areas across the Guizhou and Hunan Provinces, and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region until the Ming dynasty. At that time, the name Dong and Dong-Man began to be recorded, In the Qing dynasty, they were called Dong Miao, Dong Min and Dong Jia. Much earlier, during the period of the Qin and the Han dynasty, they were called Wulin Man or Wuxi Man. Later the name Lao, Laohu, and Wuhu were used to refer to a group of people who might be the ancestors of the Kam.

As suggested by some scholars, the ancestors of the Sui were a group of Luoyue (雒越) who were forced to move to the adjacent areas of Guangxi and Guizhou from the Yonjiang River Valley, tracing a path along the Longjiang River because of the chaos of war during the Qin dynasty. The name Sui first appeared in the Ming dynasty. Before that, the Sui had been included in the Baiyue, Man and Lao groups.

The ancestors of the Dai in Yunnan were the Dianyue (滇越) group mentioned in the &quot;Records of a Historian&quot; by Sima Qian. In &quot;Records of the Later Han Dynasty&quot;, they were called Shan, and in &quot;Records of the Local Countries in Southern China&quot;, they were called &quot;Dianpu&quot;. In the Tang dynasty, they were mentioned as Black Teeth, and as Face-Tattooed in a book named A &quot;Survey of the Aborigines&quot; by Fan Chuo. These monikers were given based on their customs of tattooing and teeth decoration. In the Song dynasty, they were called Baiyi Man, and in the Yuan dynasty were called Jinchi Baiyi. Until the Ming dynasty, they were generally called Baiyi and after the Qing dynasty, they were called Baiyi. The modern Dai people can be traced back to Dianyue, a subgroup among the ancient Baiyue groups.

==Common culture==
===Language===

The languages spoken by the Kra-Dai people are classified as the Kra–Dai language family. The high diversity of Kra–Dai languages in southern China points to the origin of the Kra–Dai language family in southern China. The Tai branch moved south into Southeast Asia only around 1000 AD. These languages are tonal languages, meaning variations in tone of a word can change that word&#x27;s meaning.

===Festivals===
Several Kra-Dai groups celebrate a number of common festivals, including a holiday known as &quot;Songkran,&quot; which originally marked the vernal equinox, but is now celebrated on 13 April every year.

==Genetics of Kra–Dai-speaking peoples==
=== Li (2008) ===
The following table of Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup frequencies of modern Kra-Dai speaking peoples is from Li, et al. (2008).

=== Full genome analysis ===
A 2015 genetic and linguistic analysis showed great genetic homogeneity between Kra-Dai speaking people, suggesting a common ancestry and a large replacement of former non-Kra-Dai groups in Southeast Asia. Kra-Dai populations are closest to southern Chinese and Taiwanese populations.

A 2020 study states that Kra-Dai ancestry most likely originated from a local Austronesian-related lineage in continental southeast China, ranging from Zheijiang to Guangdong, with additional gene flow from an Austroasiatic-related lineage. Kra-Dai ancestry also represents the southern ancestry that was introduced in the ancestors of Han Chinese although this ancestry increases further south in China. Other groups like mainland Southeast Asians and Hmong-Mien peoples have Kra-Dai ancestry too. Most significantly, Kra-Dai groups have more ancestry from Late Neolithic Fujianese (39.0%–53.9%) than Neolithic Mekong (24.9%–32.3%). Similar patterns were observed for present southeastern Han Chinese (28.9%–40.3% for Late Neolithic Fujianese and 21.8%–25.2% for Neolithic Mekong). However, there is evidence that Kra-Dai groups expanded further west in southern China and mixed with groups like Hmong-Mien, who have more affinities with Austroasiatic groups.

A 2021 study states that 1,500 year old populations from Guangxi contributed to the ancestries of modern Kra-Dai groups in Guangxi. They could be modeled as a mixture of 58.2%–90.6% Dushan-related (or Qihe3-related) ancestry and 9.4%–41.8% northern-East-Asian-related ancestry. They also received Northeast Asian-related Shandong ancestry, which emerged 9,500–7,700 years ago. Han Chinese in Guangxi, who possess the lowest Northern East Asian ancestry among Han subgroups (33.8 ± 4.8%), are also believed to be descendants of local Kra-Dai speakers who adopted Chinese dialects.

A 2022 study states that Han Chinese in Fujian and Guangdong provinces show excessive ancestries from Late Neolithic Fujianese sources (35.0–40.3%), which are more significant in modern Ami, Atayal and Kankanaey (66.9–74.3%), and less significant in Han Chinese from Zhejiang (22%), Jiangsu (17%) and Shandong (8%). This suggests a significant genetic contribution from Kra-Dai-speaking peoples, or a peoples related to them, to southern Han Chinese.

Genetic characteristics of the &quot;Bai-Yue&quot; lineage are also present in modern Tai-Kadai speakers residing in southern China and northern Vietnam. But these populations were significantly admixed with other populations, such as Han Chinese, except for Li people, who are enriched with ~85% Baiyue ancestry. The latter separated themselves from other Baiyue peoples and migrated to Hainan Island, where they preserved their Baiyue ancestry due to geographic isolation. This occurred about 4000 to 3000 years ago. The Li people also shared stronger genetic connections with Austronesians that harbored more divergent ancestry, such as the Ami, Atayal, and Kankanaey. However, there is evidence of admixture between Li and Han Chinese about 2000 years ago, with Li having about 56.56% Han ancestry as a result.

Most Kra-Dai-speaking populations in China and Vietnam share connections with the Atayal, with the former harboring about ~3–38% Atayal-related ancestry. They also have Tibetan-related ancestry. Other studies state that Kra-Dai groups derive ancestries from southeastern Asians (i.e. Paiwan, other Taiwanese aboriginals etc.), southern East Asians (i.e. Dushan) and northeast Asians (Late Neolithic Shimao) although they shared more ancestral components with Atayal.

<doc id="203690" wikidata="Q1138102" url="?curid=203690" title="Coverage data">
<text>A coverage is the digital representation of some spatio-temporal phenomenon. ISO 19123 provides the definition:
* &quot;[a] feature that acts as a function to return values from its range for any direct position within its spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal domain&quot;
Coverages play an important role in geographic information systems (GIS), geospatial content and services, GIS data processing, and data sharing.

A coverage is represented by its &quot;domain&quot; (the universe of extent) and a collection representing the coverage&#x27;s values at each defined location within its range. For example, a satellite image derived from remote sensing might record varying degrees of light pollution. Aerial photography, land cover data, and digital elevation models all provide coverage data. Generally, a coverage can be multi-dimensional, such as 1-D sensor timeseries, 2-D satellite images, 3-D x/y/t image time series or x/y/z geo tomograms, or 4-D x/y/z/t climate and ocean data.

However, coverages are more general than just regularly gridded imagery. The corresponding standards (see below) address regular and irregular grids, point clouds, and general meshes.

An interoperable service definition for navigating, accessing, processing, and aggregation of coverages is provided by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Coverage Service (WCS) suite and Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS), a spatio-temporal coverage query language.

== Standards ==

Coverages represent digital geospatial information representing space/time-varying phenomena. OGC Abstract Topic 6 - which is identical to ISO 19123 - defines an abstract model of coverages. 
Many implementations are conceivable which all conform to this abstract model while not being interoperable.
This abstract coverage model is concretized to the level of interoperability by the OGC standard GML 3.2.1 Application Schema - Coverages (often referred to as GMLCOV) which in turn is based on the Geography Markup Language (GML) 3.2, an XML grammar written in XML Schema for the description of application schemas as well as the transport and storage of geographic information.

The European legal framework for a unified Spatial Data Infrastructure, INSPIRE, in its Annex II and III relies on the OGC definitions of coverages as well, but modifies them in places in a way making them less compatible and interoperable with the OGC standard. For example, components of the coverage concept are selectively recombined into new, different definitions of a coverage.

== Coverage model ==

Formally, in GMLCOV AbstractCoverage is a subtype of AbstractFeature (indicating its close relation).
An abstract coverage consists of the following components:
* coverage domain: the extent where valid values are available;
* range set: the set of values (&quot;pixels&quot;, &quot;voxels&quot;) the coverage consists of, together with their locations
* range type: a type definition of the range set values
* metadata: a slot where any kind of metadata can be added

This abstract coverage is refined into several concrete coverage types, which can be instantiated, for example:
* gridded coverages:
** GridCoverage: a regular, equispaced grid which is not spatially referenced (like a raster image which has no geo coordinates associated)
** RectifiedGridCoverage: a regular, equispaced grid which is spatially referenced (like a satellite image which does have geo coordinates associated)
** ReferenceableGridCoverage: a grid which is not necessarily equispaced (like satellite image time series where images do not arrive at regular time intervals, or curvilinear grids following river estuaries)
* multi-feature coverages:
** MultiPointCoverage: sets of values associated with points located in space/time (&quot;point clouds&quot;)
** MultiCurveCoverage: sets of values associated with curves located in space/time (such as trajectories)
** MultiSurfaceCoverage: sets of values associated with surfaces located in space/time (such as iso-surfaces)
** MultiSolidCoverage: sets of values associated with solids located in space/time (such as CAD objects)

Among the special cases which can be modeled by coverages are
* set of Thiessen polygons, used to analyse spatially distributed data such as rainfall measurements
* triangulated irregular network (TIN), often used for terrain models

=== Relationship to Features ===

A coverage is a special kind of geographic feature, with the distinguishing characteristics that other features have one particular value associated (such as a road number, which remains constant over all the road&#x27;s extent) whereas a coverage typically conveys different values at different locations within its domain. ISO 19109 (2nd Ed.) explains the relationship between features and coverages as follows (clause 7.2.2):
* &quot;Many aspects of the real-world may be represented as features whose properties are single-valued and static. These conventional features provide a model of the world in terms of discrete objects located in it. However, in some applications it is more useful to use a model focussing on the variation of property values in space and time, formalized as coverages. &quot;

Both viewpoints are required since they each express a fundamental meta-model of the world: as a space populated by things, or as a space within which properties vary. Furthermore, requirements relating to both viewpoints may occur in a single application, typically matching a data-flow: from observation through interpretation, and then elaboration and simulation.

== Coverage encoding ==

The format-independent logical structure of coverages can be mapped to GML (such as for sensor time series) or to any of a series of data formats, such as GeoTIFF, NetCDF, HDF-EOS, or NITF.

As some of these encoding formats are not capable of incorporating all metadata making up a coverage, the coverage model foresees a multipart MIME encoding (see Figure) where the first component encodes the coverage description (domain extent, range type, metadata, etc.) and the second part consists of the range set &quot;payload&quot; using some encoding format.

== Services ==

In Web services following the open OGC standards, coverages can be used by various service types:
* Web Coverage Service which offers a simple access protocol for coverage subsetting, as well as optional advanced functionality
* Web Coverage Processing Service which offers a multi-dimensional coverage query language for ad hoc processing, fusion, aggregation, and filtering
* Web Feature Service (although coverages can only be served as a whole, making it unwieldy in face of the often high-volume coverages, like satellite maps)
* Web Processing Service which allows publishing any kind of algorithm through an advanced remote procedure call style protocol

==Industry Terminology: GIS format==
Early GIS systems were often characterised as either &#x27;raster&#x27; or &#x27;vector&#x27; systems, depending on the underlying approach to handling geometry. Raster GIS could be interpreted as using a regular discrete coverage model, while Vector GIS are more feature-oriented. The term &quot;coverage&quot; was most notably applied to the legacy ARC/INFO (ArcInfo) format developed by ESRI. At that time this was a novel concept, extending CAD formats into more spatially aware data that featured linked attributes. This usage was consistent with the coverage concept discussed here, in the sense that an ArcInfo coverage provided a one-to-one mapping from space to the thematic value or classification for each layer or coverage. However, ArcInfo coverages had a particular topological approach to ensure completeness and uniqueness, processed using the BUILD and CLEAN commands are 2D planar datasets that maintain topological information, thus a polygon &quot;knows&quot; which segments of its perimeter it shares with adjacent polygons. Due to the lack of processing power in computing at the time of its development, the Coverage model employs indexed binary files to store spatial and attribute data separately as opposed to utilizing a RDBMS.

This has changed with the advent of raster database technology like rasdaman which makes efficient ad hoc filtering and processing feasible.

<text>Chao Anouvong (; ; ), or regnal name Xaiya Setthathirath V (; ; ), (1767 – 1829), led the Lao rebellion (1826–28) against Siam as the last monarch of the Kingdom of Vientiane. Anouvong succeeded the throne in 1805 upon the death of his brother, Chao Inthavong (; ), &quot;Xaiya Setthathirath IV&quot;, who had succeeded their father, Ong Bun or Phrachao Siribounyasan (; ) &quot;Xaiya Setthathirath III&quot;. Anou was known by his father&#x27;s regnal number until recently discovered records disclosed that his father and brother had the same regnal name.

==Reign==
In 1779, following the fall of Vientiane to the army of Taksin of the Thonburi Kingdom, the city was looted but was spared destruction. However, the Emerald Buddha and several other important Buddha images were taken to Thonburi, and the sons and daughter of Ong Bun or King Siribounyasan were taken as hostages, along with several thousand Lao families, who were resettled in Saraburi, north of the Thai capital. Siribounyasan had three sons, who were all to succeed him as king of Vientiane – Nanthasen, Inthavong, and Anouvong.

On the death of King Siribounyasan in 1781, Siam allowed his eldest son, Nathasen, to return to Vientiane as king. He was permitted to take with him the Phra Bang, a gold Buddharupa that had, according to legend had been originally brought from Angkor by Fa Ngum, the first king of Lan Xang, and was taken to Thonburi in 1779. In 1791, Nanthasan convinced Rama I that King Anourouth of Luang Phrabang was secretly meeting with the Bamar-ruled Konbaung Kingdom and plotting a rebellion against Thonburi. Nathasan was allowed to attack Luang Prabang and capture the city in 1792. The Luang Phrabang royal family were sent to Bangkok as prisoners and remained there for four years. Two years later, Nanthasan was himself accused of plotting a rebellion with the Lao governor of Nakhon Phanom, allegedly having made diplomatic overtures to Tây Sơn Vietnam. Nanthasen was arrested and possibly executed in 1794.

In 1795, Inthavong was installed as King of Vientiane, with his brother Anouvong assuming the traditional post of oupahat (, &quot;vice-king&quot;). Burmese armies invaded Siam in both 1797 and 1802, and Inthavong dispatched several Lao armies under Anouvong to assist in the defense. Anouvong gained recognition for his bravery and won several major victories at Sipsong Chao Thai.

Inthavong died in 1804, and Anouvong succeeded him as the ruler of Vientiane. However, by 1813 he had begun a series of religious and symbolic acts which remain highly controversial. Anouvong called a great council of the sangha, only the third ever held in Laotian history, and it was decided that a new Emerald Buddha would be carved. Anouvong ordered repairs on the Ho Phra Kèo, and also ordered several new temples to be established and dedicated to the Emerald Buddha. Bizarrely, he ordered a major bridge to be built across the wide Mekong.

In 1819 Anouvong rushed to suppress a rebellion in the Kingdom of Champasak, led by a charismatic monk, who had caused the ruler to flee to Bangkok. Anouvong&#x27;s son Nyô led an army south from Vientiane and easily suppressed the uprising. As the king of Champasak had died, Rama II of Siam appointed Nyô the new ruler of Champasak. Anouvong had succeeded in uniting two of the three Lao kingdoms under his control. Also that year, Anouwong ordered the construction of Wat Si Saket, which was completed in 1824. The temple was a major statement of his authority, since it was oriented so that when Anouvong&#x27;s vassals came to pledge their annual allegiance, they physically turned their backs on Bangkok.

=== Funeral of Rama II ===

Rama II died in 1824, and it was unclear who would succeed him. The likely successors were young Mongkut, who was the son of Queen Sri Suriyendra, and Mongkut&#x27;s elder and more experienced half-brother Jessadabodindra, who was only the son of a court concubine. A crisis was avoided when Prince Mongkut chose to become a bhikkhu (Buddhist monk) and Jessadabodindra ascended as Rama III.

The potential crisis had caused the military to be on high alert, and the British Empire, who had recently begun the First Anglo-Burmese War, monitored closely the situation.

In the midst of these events, the Lao kings of Luang Phrabang, Vientiane, and Champasak made their way to Bangkok for the royal funeral ceremonies to be held the following year in accordance with custom. Rama III had already begun implementing the census and forced tattooing policies in the Khorat Plateau. Anouvong&#x27;s retinue and one of his sons were impressed into corvee projects, including digging canals, felling sugar palms, harvesting bamboo, and constructing the Phra Samut Chedi. At one of the projects, Anouvong&#x27;s son allegedly had been mocked and possibly even beaten. Anouvong was furious and cut short the traditional obeisance at the Chakri court.

It is not clear whether Anouvong had decided to rebel during his stay in Bangkok, or he had planned it earlier and was just awaiting an excuse. Nevertheless, he made demands before he left. He wanted the return of the Emerald Buddha (which had originally been brought to Vientiane from Chiang Mai), the release of his sister (taken hostage forty-five years earlier), and the return of the Lao families who had been relocated in Saraburi. Thai historians write that Anouvong rebelled over a personal slight, since each of his requests was denied and he was told he could return with only one dancer from his retinue. However, the intensity of his rebellion suggests that his motivations were more complex.

== Rebellion ==

By 1826, Anouvong was making military preparations for rebellion. His strategy involved three key points: 1) respond to the immediate crisis caused by the popular discontent over the forced tattooing; 2) remove the ethnic Lao on the Khorat Plateau to the Kingdom of Vientiane, conducting a scorched Earth policy as he did so to slow the inevitable Siamese pursuit; and 3) seek a diplomatic victory by gaining support from Vietnam, China or Britain.

Anouvong may have believed that the balance of power in Southeast Asia was turning away from Siam. The factionalism at the Siamese court, the presence of the British in nearby Burma, the growing influence of Vietnam in the Cambodian provinces, and the regional dissatisfaction in the Lao areas suggested that Siamese power was waning. In 1826, the British had arrived to finalize the Burney Treaty between Siam and the British Empire, and the presence of the British fleet may have led Anouvong to believe that an invasion was imminent. However, his most serious miscalculation was in the disparity of military power between Siam and Laos. From at least 1822, Siam had been purchasing large quantities of modern firearms and ammunition from Britain, which had a military surplus from the recently ended Napoleonic Wars.

In December 1826, Anouvong&#x27;s rebellion began with an army of 10 000 men making its way toward Kalasin, following the path of the Siamese tattooing officials. In January, Anouvong led a second larger force towards Nakhon Ratchasima and was able to take the city by a ruse. A contingent of Anouvong&#x27;s army was sent to Lomsak and Chaiyaphum, before making its way to Saraburi to bring the Lao families there back to Vientiane. A fourth army led by Anouvong&#x27;s son Nyô, the King of Champasak, was dispatched to take Ubon. All of these armies moved under a web of misinformation and false dispatches that warned of impending attacks on Siam by neighbouring powers.

Anouvong&#x27;s planned retreats were slowed by the civilians who occupied the roads and passes. Lao commanders also delayed to search for the Thai officials responsible for tattooing, forcing those captured to march north as prisoners. Anouvong wasted foolishly over a month searching for the governor of Nakhon Ratchasima, who had been a key figure in the tattooing and population transfers.

Siam quickly organized a massive counterstrike and dispatched two armies, one by way of Saraburi to retake Nakhon Ratchasima, and the other through the Pasak Valley towards Lomsak. Anouvong&#x27;s forces withdrew to Nong Bua Lamphu, the strongest fortress on the Khorat Plateau and traditionally held by the crown prince of Vientiane. After a three-day battle, Nong Bua Lamphu finally fell, and Anouvong&#x27;s men fell back to a second line of defence. Siamese strength and modern arms were greater than what Anouvong had imagined, and his armies continued to march towards Vientiane. They defended the city for five days, as Anouvong fled for his life towards the border with Vietnam.

Siamese general Phraya Ratchasuphawadi, later promoted to Chao Phraya Bodindecha, at last took Anouvong&#x27;s capital city. He sacked the palaces and levelled the city&#x27;s defences, but he left the monasteries and much of the city intact. Following the sacking of Vientiane, the rulers of Chiang Mai, Lampang, Lamphun, Nan, Phrae, and the kingdom of Luang Phrabang all pledged their renewed allegiance to Siam, although Phraya Bodindecha noted that they had “waited to see the turn of events, and their actions greatly depended on the outcome of the war.”

Bodindecha spent several months organizing the removal of the remaining people from around Vientiane and confiscating all arms and ammunition. He then left a small garrison across the river opposite the empty city and returned to the Khorat Plateau.

Anouvong eventually returned with about 1 000 soldiers and 100 Vietnamese observers. This small force was meant only to negotiate a settlement with Siam. However, he learned that a nine-spire stupa had been erected as a victory monument at Wat Thung Sawang Chaiyaphum (วัดทุ่งสว่างชัยภูมิ) in the town of Yasothon. This enraged him, and he crossed the Mekong and attacked the 300 Thai defenders, killing all but about 40. The now furious Rama III ordered Chao Phraya Bodindecha to return and completely destroy Vientiane, and to capture Anouvong at all costs.

Chao Phraya Bondindecha pursued Anouvong to Xieng Khouang, where according to some accounts he was betrayed by Chao Noy and handed over to the Siamese. Anouvong and his family were placed under heavy guard and marched to Bangkok. A British observer recalled:

==Aftermath==
The city of Vientiane was totally destroyed and its population completely relocated. The destruction was so thorough that the first French explorers more than 30 years later found only ruins in a jungle to show where the city had once been. The remaining Lao kingdoms of Champasak and Luang Phrabang understandably came under stricter control and arms limitations, while the Khorat Plateau was formally annexed by Siam. Regional rivals Siam and Vietnam would come into increasing conflict over control of the inland trade and Lao territory, leading to the Siamese-Vietnamese Wars of the 1830s. Vietnam annexed the Lao principality of Xieng Khouang, and Chinese bandits after the Taiping rebellion were able to force their way down the Mekong River to fight what became known as the Haw Wars of the 1860s. The first French explorers navigating the Mekong River used the political vacuum as a convenient excuse to create their own colony of French Indochina.

==Legacy==
The most significant legacy of Anouvong&#x27;s Lao Rebellion was the impact of the forced population transfers throughout the region. As a consequence of the warfare and population transfers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, there are now over 19 million ethnic Lao living in the Isan region of Thailand, while less than 6 million live in the independent country of Laos.

During the French colonial period, Vientiane was rebuilt as the Laotian capital in a deliberate attempt win favor and to demonstrate French authority.

Several accounts of the Siamese-Lao conflict have been written by historians and authorities, many in direct conflict with one another. In particular, the accounts of the Siamese heroines Thao Suranari (or “Lady Mo”) and Khunying Bunleu have been popularized and possibly exaggerated. During the 1930s, Field Marshall Phibun promoted Siamese legends as part of a political and military campaign to unify all of the Tai peoples.

The Siamese government also named schools and a museum after the victorious general. However, modern Lao nationalist movements have turned Anouvong into a hero, even though his rebellion caused the end of the kingdom of Lan Xang, the destruction of Vientiane, and a permanent division of the Lao people between the country of Laos and the Lao-speaking provinces of northeastern Thailand. Nevertheless, his rebellion is regarded as the point at which Lao nationality and identity solidified. He has been credited with the existence of the modern country of Laos, which might have otherwise have been completely incorporated into Thailand, as was the neighboring Tai Yuan kingdom of Lanna.

==Memorials==

Anouvong had ordered Wat Si Saket to be built in Vientiane, and his name will always be connected with it. An elephant howdah he once owned and used is on display in the Lao National Museum in Vientiane.

In 2010, to coincide with the 450th Anniversary celebrations of Vientiane, the Laos government created Chao Anouvong Park, complete with a large bronze statue of the locally revered ruler.

==Children==
 &quot;Chao&quot; Anouvong had 27 children.

<text>Setthathirath (; 24 January 1534 – 1571) or Xaysettha (; , , ) is considered one of the great leaders in Lao history. Throughout the 1560s until his death, he successfully defended his kingdom of Lan Xang against military campaigns of Burmese conqueror Bayinnaung, who had already subdued Xieng Mai (Chiang Mai) in 1558 and Ayutthaya in 1564. Setthathirath was a prolific builder and erected many Buddhist monuments including Wat Xieng Thong in Luang Prabang, Haw Phra Kaew, Wat Ong Teu Mahawihan and the Pha That Luang in Vientiane.

==King of Lanna==
Setthathirath also known as Chaiyachettha or Chaiyaset or Jayajestha, Son of the King Photisarath of Lan Xang, he was crowned King of Lanna after the death of his grandfather, Ketklao the previous King of Lanna, who died without a male heir to the throne and gave his daughter Princess Yotkhamtip in marriage to his father King Photisarath of Lan Xang.

When King Ketklao died, there was no other descendant available to succeed him. High-ranking officials and Buddhist monks therefore agreed unanimously to assign the Lanna throne to Prince Setthathirath in 1546. His name was lengthened to Chao Chaiyasetthathirath.

In 1548 King Setthathirath (as King of Lanna) had taken Chiang Saen as his capital. Chiang Mai still had powerful factions at court, and the threats from Burma and Ayutthaya were growing.

==King of Lan Xang==
After the death of King Photisararath, the nobles of Lan Xang were divided, a group supported Prince Tha Heua, another group of nobles led by Phya Vieng, Saen Marong and Kwan Darmpa supported Prince Lanchang who was born from an Ayutthayan princess. Prince Tha Heua and Prince Lanchang began to split the Kingdom up between them, when Prince Settathathirath was still in Chiang Mai. Hearing of the news of his half brothers, King Settathathirath quickly returned to Lan Xang leaving the affairs of Chiang Mai under Queen Chiraprapha&#x27;s leadership, taking with him the Phra Kaew (Emerald Buddha), the Saekkam and the Phra Phuttha Sihing images. He also claimed that taking the statue would allow his relatives the opportunity to venerate the image and make merit. The Nobles of Lanna felt that Setthathirath had stayed away too long, and sought another descendant of Mangrai dynasty to take the throne in 1551. They chose a distant relative of Setthathirath, the Shan Prince known as Mekuti.

Settathathirath subdued Prince Tarua in Louang Phrabang, and sent his general Phya Sisatthamatailoke to go fight Prince Lanchang in the town of Kengsah, Prince Lanchang was defeated and fled to Thakhek, where the local Lord had him arrested and sent to Phya Sisatthama. The nobles that supported Prince Lanchang were executed, but Prince Setthatathirath pardoned Prince Lanchang and appointed him as governor of Seanmuang. Phya Sisatthama was thus made Lord of Viangchan, and given the title Phya Chantaburi, who built Wat Chan and Pia Wat that can be still found in Viangchan today.

In 1553 King Setthathirath sent an army to retake Lanna from Mekuti but was defeated. Again in 1555 King Setthathirath sent an army to retake Lanna at the command of Sen Soulintha, and managed to take Chiang Saen. For his success, Sen Soulintha was given the title &quot;Luxai&quot; (Victorious) and offered one of his daughters to King Setthathirath. In 1556 Burma, under King Bayinnaung invaded Lanna. King Mekuti of Lanna surrendered Chiang Mai without a fight, but was reinstated as a Burmese vassal under military occupation.

In 1560, King Setthathirath formally moved the capital of Lan Xang from Luang Prabang to Viangchan, which would remain the capital over the next two hundred and fifty years. The formal movement of the capital followed an expansive building program which included strengthening city defenses, the construction of a massive formal palace and the Haw Phra Kaew to house the Emerald Buddha, and major renovations to That Luang in Viangchan. In Luang Prabang, Wat Xieng Thong was constructed perhaps in compensation for the loss of status as the former capital of Lan Xang, and in Nakhon Phanom major renovations were made to That Phanom.

==The Burmese invasions==
In 1563, a treaty was signed between Lan Xang and Ayutthaya, which was sealed by the betrothal of Princess Thepkasattri (whose mother was Queen Suriyothai of Ayutthaya). However, King King Maha Chakkraphat instead tried to exchange Princess Kaeo Fa, which was immediately rejected. In the midst of the disagreement, the Burmese invaded northern Ayutthaya with the assistance of Maha Thammaracha the royal viceroy and governor of Phitsanulok. It was only then in 1564 that King Chakkraphat sent Princess Thepkasattri to Lan Xang along with a massive dowry in an attempt to buy back the broken alliance.

While the procession was en route, Maha Thammaracha ambushed the princess and sent her to his overlords in Burma; she committed suicide shortly thereafter or en route. Facing the threat of a superior Burmese force, King Chakkraphat had lost a potential alliance with Lan Xang, the northern territories of Ayutthaya and his daughter. To prevent further incursions, King Chakkraphat became a vassal of Burma and had to deliver both himself and his son Prince Ramesuan as hostages to King Bayinnaung leaving another son Prince Mahinthrathirat as a vassal in Ayutthaya.

The Burmese then turned north to depose King Mekuti of Lanna, who had failed to support the Burmese invasion of Ayutthaya in 1563. When Chiang Mai fell to the Burmese, a number of refugees fled to Viangchan and stripped of supplies. When the Burmese took Viangchan they were forced into the countryside for supplies, where King Setthathirath had organized guerrilla attacks and small raids to harass the Burmese troops. Facing disease, malnutrition and demoralizing guerrilla warfare, King Bayinnaung was forced to retreat in 1565 leaving Lan Xang the only remaining independent Tai kingdom.

==Covert plans==

In 1567, King Mahinthrathirat approached King Setthathirath with covert plans for Ayutthaya to rebel against Burma by launching a counterattack against Mahathammarachathirat in Phitsanulok. The plan would involve an overland invasion from Lan Xang with assistance from the royal navy in Ayutthaya passing up the Nan River. Mahathammarachathirat was in Burma at the time, and Maha Chakkraphat had been allowed to return to Ayutthaya as Burma was facing small rebellions in the Shan areas.

The plan was discovered and reinforcements were sent to Phitsanulok. Realizing Phitsanulok was too fortified, Setthathirath withdrew his attack, but set up a devastating counter ambush on his retreat to Vientiane in which five pursuing Burmese generals were killed. Seizing on the weakness, King Chakkraphat ordered a second attack on Phitsanulok in which he successfully took the city, but could only briefly hold it having suffered repeated heavy losses.

King Bayinnaung sent a massive invasion in 1568 in response to the uprising. In early 1569, the city of Ayutthaya was directly under threat and Vientiane sent reinforcements. The Burmese had planned on the reinforcements however and Setthathirath fell into a trap. After a two-day struggle the Lan Xang forces prevailed at the Pa Sak Valley near Phetchabun, at which point one of the commanding generals from Nakhon Phanom broke south toward Ayutthaya. The Burmese rallied and were able to destroy the divided forces, and Setthathirath had to retreat toward Viangchan.

The Burmese then focused their attack on Ayutthaya and took the city. King Setthathirath upon reaching Vientiane ordered an immediate evacuation. The Burmese took several weeks to regroup and rest having taken Ayutthaya, which allowed Setthathirath to rally his forces and plan for prolonged guerrilla warfare. The Burmese arrived in Viangchan and were able to take the lightly defended city. Just as in 1565, Setthathirath began a guerrilla campaign from his base near the Nam Ngum River, northeast of Vientiane. In 1570 Bayinnaung retreated, Setthathirath counterattacked and more than 30,000 were taken prisoner, along with 100 elephants, and 2,300 pieces of ivory from the retreating Burmese.

In 1571, the Ayutthaya Kingdom and Lan Na were Burmese vassals. Having twice defended Lan Xang from Burmese invasions, King Setthathirath moved south to conduct a campaign against the Khmer Empire. Defeating the Khmer would have greatly strengthened Lan Xang, giving it vital sea access, trade opportunities, and most importantly, European firearms which had been growing use since the early 1500s. The &quot;Khmer Chronicles&quot; record that armies from Lan Xang invaded in 1571 and 1572, during the second invasion King Barom Reacha I was slain in an elephant duel. The Khmer must have rallied and Lan Xang retreated.

==Death and aftermath==
In 1571, a conspiracy between Lord Phya Nakhon and the former abbot of Wat Maximavat, who held personal grudges against Setthathirath, led to the king&#x27;s murder in the southern frontier of the country. He was 37 years of age.

Because Setthathirath left only a toddler as his heir, prince Noi Hno Muang Keo Koumane, the child&#x27;s maternal grandfather, a military commander of common birth named Sen Soulintha, declared himself king. This began a period of turbulence, with different kings ruling unsteadily for short periods, which saw the country finally conquered by King Bayinnaung in 1574, and the toddler son of Setthathirath taken to Burma. with a fratricide by a crown prince; with a rebellion led by someone claiming to be Setthathirath-resurrected; and with a nine-year period in which the country had no king. (The Burmese would rule Laos for eighteen years.) Quarrels and conflicts among the feudal nobility and their followings led to disruptions and unrest within the population.

With the country in chaos, Prince Noi Hno Muang Keo Koumane was always recognised as the rightful king by the people of Laos who campaigned for his return for many years. They finally succeeded when they sent a delegation to Burma after the prince had come of age in 1590. Released from captivity in Burma by King Nanda Bayin, he returned to Vientiane where he was crowned in 1591. He declared independence from the Burmese in 1593, but suffered several attacks from them throughout his reign.

There was little peace in Laos until King Sourigna Vongsa ascended the throne in 1637 (possibly in 1638).

<text>Wat Xieng Thong (, ; &quot;Temple of the Golden City&quot;) is a Buddhist temple (vat or wat) on the northern tip of the peninsula of Luang Prabang, Laos. Built between 1559 and 1560 by King Setthathirath, Wat Xieng Thong is one of the most important of Lao monasteries and remains a significant monument to the spirit of religion, royalty and traditional art.

== Etymology ==
The name Vat Xieng Thong (Lao: ວັດຊຽງທອງ), means &quot;Temple of the Golden City.&quot; In Lao, wat, or vat, means Buddhist temple; these buildings are central to the life of Laotian communities.

==History ==
Wat Xieng Thong was built under the rule of King Setthathirath between 1559 and 1560. Setthathirath oversaw the Lan Xang (&quot;Land of a Million Elephants&quot;) kingdom, a geographical area that is now Laos. During his rule, Setthathirath moved the capital from Xieng Thong (which was later renamed Luang Prabang) to Vientiane, claiming dislike for the lack of flat land in Xieng Thong. But, Luang Prabang remained a royal capital until 1975, when the Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic (LPDR) was established.

Vat Xieng Thong was a royal temple under the patronage of the royal family (until the creation of the LPDR), created alongside Vat Keo and Vat That Luang. The vat functioned as a place for kings to be crowned, a place of worship for monks and the laity, a shrine to Buddhist relics, a celebration space of religious rites and festivals, a library for ancient scripts, and a showcasing of traditional architecture.

== Architecture ==

=== Site ===
Vat Xieng Thong is located in Luang Prabang, Laos. Luang Prabang means &quot;the place of the Buddha,&quot; for the sacred image of Buddha from which kings would derive their divine right. The city is between the Mekong and Nam Khan rivers, and according to UNESCO, contains some of &quot;the most sophisticated Buddhist temples in Southeast Asia.&quot; Luang Prabang was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995.

=== Style and Features ===
The vat represents typical Laos art and craft.

A Sim is the central shrine hall of a Laotian temple. Vat Xieng Thong&#x27;s Sim is composed of nine cascading roofs and is decorated by gold stenciling. The roofs are a central element of the structure, sweeping downward in an elaborate array. Along the center of the roof is the Dok So Fa, small pagodas covered in gold that hook upwards to the sky. The number of pagodas and overall detail of this floral sculpture signifies the relative importance of a Laotian temple.

On one side of the sim, there are small halls and stupas that contain Buddha images of the period. There is a reclining Buddha sanctuary, which contains an especially rare reclining Buddha that dates back to the construction of the temple. In 1931, the image was taken to France and displayed at the Paris Exhibition. It was kept in Vientiane until 1964, when it was returned to Luang Prabang. In the near compound&#x27;s eastern gate stands the royal funerary carriage house, where it houses the funeral carriage, which stands high and there are various urns for the members of the royal family.

The interior of the Sim is similarly adorned by gold stenciling. Rich red and black walls are decorated completely with gold stencils of mythological scenes and geometric design. The ceiling displays Dharmachakras — dharma wheels symbolising Buddhist law and the circle of reincarnation. The rear gable is decorated with a glass mosaic depicting the tree of life. Behind the Sim is the Sanctuary of the Reclining Buddha, a small chapel decorated with mosaics and featuring a large Buddhist statue.

Many other structures fill the compound and complement the Sim, including the Kouti, Ho Tai, and Hor Kong, the library, monk living space, and boat house, respectively.

== Wat Xieng Thong Today ==

=== Restoration and Conservation ===
A number of restorations have taken place to maintain the temple, which remains in remarkable condition since its creation in the 1500s.

In 1928, when the French Governor General visited Luang Prabang, King Sisavangvong successfully demanded that the French share in the cost of restoration, as Laos was a French protectorate from 1893 to 1953. In the 1950s and 1960s, the funerary carriage house was built. Renovations in 2012 and 2013 involved carefully cleaning the building, repainting the gold stencils, restoring damaged tiles and doors and windows, and repainting walls. Interestingly, scholars have noted that in the mid 20th century,

In 1880, the Tripiṭaka library was added and the drum tower in 1961. This temple, along with Wat Suwannaphumaham, was spared any damage during the sacking of the city in 1887. This was because the Black Flag Haw leader, Đèo Văn Trị, had studied here as a monk in his early life and used it as his headquarters during the sacking of Luang Phrabang.

In January 2024, the entrance fee to the temple was 20,000 kip.

<text>Prince Boun Oum (also Prince Boun Oum [[Na Champassak]]; ; ; ; 2 December 1911 – 17 March 1980) was the son of King Ratsadanay, and was the hereditary prince of Champassak and also Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos from March 1949 to February 1950 and again from December 1960 to June 1962.

==Early life==
He was born in Don Talad in 1911, the eldest son of Prince Ratsadanay, Prince of Champassak by his fourth wife, Princess Sudhi Saramuni. He was educated at Wat Liep Monastery Sch. and l&#x27;École de Droit, Vientiane. He met Mom Bouaphanh Soumpholphakdy of Kengkok and married in 1943. The couple had six sons and three daughters: Prince Keo Champhonesak na Champassak, Prince Saysanasak na Champassak, Prince Keo Halusak na Champassak, Prince Simoungkhounsak na Champassak, Prince Vannahsak na Champassak, Prince Vongdasak na Champassak, Princess Ninhdasak na Champassak, Princess Keosondarasak na Champassak and Princess Keomanisak na Champassak. He had 11 grandchildren. He succeeded on the death of his father as Head of the Princely House of Champassak, June 1946. At the same time, he renounced his rights in order to establish a unified kingdom, the Kingdom of Laos, on 27 August 1946. He was appointed the President of the Royal Council in 1947. In 1949, he was appointed as Inspector-General of the Kingdom.

==Prime Minister of Laos==
Sympathetic to the French in Laos, he commanded a force of 15,000 that fought Japanese troops and the Lao Issara in the south of Laos. Titular leader of the royalist faction (and one of the Three Princes of the Kingdom of Laos), he served as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos from March 1949 to February 1950 and again from December 1960 to June 1962 when The National Assembly installed him by unanimous vote.

He retired from politics to pursue business interests from his base in Pakse and Champassak but continued to be a major power broker until his exile in 1975, the year the communist Pathet Lao came to power. In 1975 he went to France for medical treatment and never returned to Laos. He died in Boulogne-Billancourt, France in 1980 and his ashes are buried at the Cimetiere de Trivaux in Meudon France, next to his wife Princess Bouaphanh na Champassak (1920–2013).

<doc id="203711" wikidata="Q179924" url="?curid=203711" title="Bioluminescence">
<text>Bioluminescence is the emission of light during a chemiluminescence reaction by living organisms. Bioluminescence occurs in diverse organisms ranging from marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi, microorganisms including some bioluminescent bacteria, dinoflagellates and terrestrial arthropods such as fireflies. In some animals, the light is bacteriogenic, produced by symbiotic bacteria such as those from the genus &quot;Vibrio&quot;; in others, it is autogenic, produced by the animals themselves.

In most cases, the principal chemical reaction in bioluminescence involves the reaction of a substrate called luciferin and an enzyme, called luciferase. Because these are generic names, luciferins and luciferases are often distinguished by the species or group, e.g. firefly luciferin or cypridina luciferin. In all characterized cases, the enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of the luciferin resulting in excited state oxyluciferin, which is the light emitter of the reaction. Upon their decay to the ground state they emit visible light. In all known cases of bioluminescence the production of the excited state molecules involves the decomposition of organic peroxides.

In some species, the luciferase requires other cofactors, such as calcium or magnesium ions, and sometimes also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In evolution, luciferins vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is found in 11 different animal phyla, though in some of these, the animals obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferases vary widely between different species. Bioluminescence has arisen over 40 times in evolutionary history.

Both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder mentioned that damp wood sometimes gives off a glow. Many centuries later Robert Boyle showed that oxygen was involved in the process, in both wood and glowworms. It was not until the late nineteenth century that bioluminescence was properly investigated. The phenomenon is widely distributed among animal groups, especially in marine environments. On land it occurs in fungi, bacteria and some groups of invertebrates, including insects.

The uses of bioluminescence by animals include counterillumination camouflage, mimicry of other animals, for example to lure prey, and signaling to other individuals of the same species, such as to attract mates. In the laboratory, luciferase-based systems are used in genetic engineering and biomedical research. Researchers are also investigating the possibility of using bioluminescent systems for street and decorative lighting, and a bioluminescent plant has been created.

==History==
Before the development of the safety lamp for use in coal mines, dried fish skins were used in Britain and Europe as a weak source of light. This experimental form of illumination avoided the necessity of using candles which risked sparking explosions of firedamp. In 1920, the American zoologist E. Newton Harvey published a monograph, &quot;The Nature of Animal Light&quot;, summarizing early work on bioluminescence. Harvey notes that Aristotle mentions light produced by dead fish and flesh, and that both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder (in his &quot;Natural History&quot;) mention light from damp wood. He records that Robert Boyle experimented on these light sources, and showed that both they and the glowworm require air for light to be produced. Harvey notes that in 1753, J. Baker identified the flagellate &quot;Noctiluca&quot; &quot;as a luminous animal&quot; &quot;just visible to the naked eye&quot;, and in 1854 Johann Florian Heller (1813–1871) identified strands (hyphae) of fungi as the source of light in dead wood.

Tuckey, in his posthumous 1818 &quot;Narrative of the Expedition to the Zaire&quot;, described catching the animals responsible for luminescence. He mentions pellucids, crustaceans (to which he ascribes the milky whiteness of the water), and cancers (shrimps and crabs). Under the microscope he described the &quot;luminous property&quot; to be in the brain, resembling &quot;a most brilliant amethyst about the size of a large pin&#x27;s head&quot;.

Charles Darwin noticed bioluminescence in the sea, describing it in his &quot;Journal&quot;:

While sailing in these latitudes on one very dark night, the sea presented a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a fresh breeze, and every part of the surface, which during the day is seen as foam, now glowed with a pale light. The vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake she was followed by a milky train. As far as the eye reached, the crest of every wave was bright, and the sky above the horizon, from the reflected glare of these livid flames, was not so utterly obscure, as over the rest of the heavens.

Darwin also observed a luminous &quot;jelly-fish of the genus Dianaea&quot;, noting that: &quot;When the waves scintillate with bright green sparks, I believe it is generally owing to minute crustacea. But there can be no doubt that very many other pelagic animals, when alive, are phosphorescent.&quot; He guessed that &quot;a disturbed electrical condition of the atmosphere&quot; was probably responsible. Daniel Pauly comments that Darwin &quot;was lucky with most of his guesses, but not here&quot;, noting that biochemistry was too little known, and that the complex evolution of the marine animals involved &quot;would have been too much for comfort&quot;.

Bioluminescence attracted the attention of the United States Navy in the Cold War, since submarines in some waters can create a bright enough wake to be detected; a German submarine was sunk in the First World War, having been detected in this way. The Navy was interested in predicting when such detection would be possible, and hence guiding their own submarines to avoid detection.

Among the anecdotes of navigation by bioluminescence is one recounted by the Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell, who as a Navy pilot had found his way back to his aircraft carrier USS &quot;Shangri-La&quot; when his navigation systems failed. Turning off his cabin lights, he saw the glowing wake of the ship, and was able to fly to it and land safely.

The French pharmacologist Raphaël Dubois carried out work on bioluminescence in the late nineteenth century. He studied click beetles (&quot;Pyrophorus&quot;) and the marine bivalve mollusc &quot;Pholas dactylus&quot;. He refuted the old idea that bioluminescence came from phosphorus, and demonstrated that the process was related to the oxidation of a specific compound, which he named luciferin, by an enzyme. He sent Harvey siphons from the mollusc preserved in sugar. Harvey had become interested in bioluminescence as a result of visiting the South Pacific and Japan and observing phosphorescent organisms there. He studied the phenomenon for many years. His research aimed to demonstrate that luciferin, and the enzymes that act on it to produce light, were interchangeable between species, showing that all bioluminescent organisms had a common ancestor. However, he found this hypothesis to be false, with different organisms having major differences in the composition of their light-producing proteins. He spent the next 30 years purifying and studying the components, but it fell to the young Japanese chemist Osamu Shimomura to be the first to obtain crystalline luciferin. He used the sea firefly &quot;Vargula hilgendorfii&quot;, but it was another ten years before he discovered the chemical&#x27;s structure and published his 1957 paper &quot;Crystalline Cypridina Luciferin&quot;. Shimomura, Martin Chalfie, and Roger Y. Tsien won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their 1961 discovery and development of green fluorescent protein as a tool for biological research.

Harvey wrote a detailed historical account on all forms of luminescence in 1957. An updated book on bioluminescence covering also the twentieth and early twenty-first century was published recently.

== Evolution ==

In 1932 E. N. Harvey was among the first to propose how bioluminescence could have evolved. In this early paper, he suggested that proto-bioluminescence could have arisen from respiratory chain proteins that hold fluorescent groups. This hypothesis has since been disproven, but it did lead to considerable interest in the origins of the phenomenon. Today, the two prevailing hypotheses (both concerning marine bioluminescence) are those put forth by Howard Seliger in 1993 and Rees et al. in 1998.

Seliger&#x27;s theory identifies luciferase enzymes as the catalyst for the evolution of bioluminescent systems. It suggests that the original purpose of luciferases was as mixed-function oxygenases. As the early ancestors of many species moved into deeper and darker waters natural selection favored the development of increased eye sensitivity and enhanced visual signals. If selection were to favor a mutation in the oxygenase enzyme required for the breakdown of pigment molecules (molecules often associated with spots used to attract a mate or distract a predator) it could have eventually resulted in external luminescence in tissues.

Rees et al. use evidence gathered from the marine luciferin coelenterazine to suggest that selection acting on luciferins may have arisen from pressures to protect oceanic organisms from potentially deleterious reactive oxygen species (e.g. H2O2 and O2− ). The functional shift from antioxidation to bioluminescence probably occurred when the strength of selection for antioxidation defense decreased as early species moved further down the water column. At greater depths exposure to ROS is significantly lower, as is the endogenous production of ROS through metabolism.

While popular at first, Seliger&#x27;s theory has been challenged, particularly on the biochemical and genetic evidence that Rees examines. What remains clear, however, is that bioluminescence has evolved independently at least 40 times. Bioluminescence in fish began at least by the Cretaceous period. About 1,500 fish species are known to be bioluminescent; the capability evolved independently at least 27 times. Of these, 17 involved the taking up of bioluminous bacteria from the surrounding water while in the others, the intrinsic light evolved through chemical synthesis. These fish have become surprisingly diverse in the deep ocean and control their light with the help of their nervous system, using it not just to lure prey or hide from predators, but also for communication.

All bioluminescent organisms have in common that the reaction of a &quot;luciferin&quot; and oxygen is catalyzed by a luciferase to produce light. McElroy and Seliger proposed in 1962 that the bioluminescent reaction evolved to detoxify oxygen, in parallel with photosynthesis.

Thuesen, Davis et al. showed in 2016 that bioluminescence has evolved independently 27 times within 14 fish clades across ray-finned fishes. The oldest of these appears to be Stomiiformes and Myctophidae. In sharks, bioluminescence has evolved only once.

Genomic analysis of octocorals indicates that their ancestor was bioluminescent as long as 540 million years ago.

==Chemical mechanism==

Bioluminescence is a form of chemiluminescence where light energy is released by a chemical reaction. This reaction involves a light-emitting pigment, the luciferin, and a luciferase, the enzyme component. Because of the diversity of luciferin/luciferase combinations, there are very few commonalities in the chemical mechanism. From currently studied systems, the only unifying mechanism is the role of molecular oxygen; often there is a concurrent release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, the firefly luciferin/luciferase reaction requires magnesium and ATP and produces CO2, adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PP) as waste products. Other cofactors may be required, such as calcium (Ca2+) for the photoprotein aequorin, or magnesium (Mg2+) ions and ATP for the firefly luciferase. Generically, this reaction can be described as:

:Luciferin + O2&lt;chem&gt;-&gt;[\text{Luciferase}][\text{other cofactors}]&lt;/chem&gt;Oxyluciferin + light energy

Instead of a luciferase, the jellyfish &quot;Aequorea victoria&quot; makes use of another type of protein called a photoprotein, in this case specifically aequorin. When calcium ions are added, rapid catalysis creates a brief flash quite unlike the prolonged glow produced by luciferase. In a second, much slower step, luciferin is regenerated from the oxidized (oxyluciferin) form, allowing it to recombine with aequorin, in preparation for a subsequent flash. Photoproteins are thus enzymes, but with unusual reaction kinetics. Furthermore, some of the blue light released by aequorin in contact with calcium ions is absorbed by a green fluorescent protein, which in turn releases green light in a process called resonant energy transfer.

Overall, bioluminescence has arisen over 40 times in evolutionary history. In evolution, luciferins tend to vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is the light emitting pigment for nine phyla (groups of very different organisms), including polycystine radiolaria, Cercozoa (Phaeodaria), protozoa, comb jellies, cnidaria including jellyfish and corals, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow worms and vertebrates (ray-finned fish). Not all these organisms synthesise coelenterazine: some of them obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferase enzymes vary widely and tend to be different in each species.

==Distribution==

Bioluminescence occurs widely among animals, especially in the open sea, including fish, jellyfish, comb jellies, crustaceans, and cephalopod molluscs; in some fungi and bacteria; and in various terrestrial invertebrates, nearly all of which are beetles. In marine coastal habitats, about 2.5% of organisms are estimated to be bioluminescent, whereas in pelagic habitats in the eastern Pacific, about 76% of the main taxa of deep-sea animals have been found to be capable of producing light. More than 700 animal genera have been recorded with light-producing species. Most marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum. However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared light, and the genus &quot;Tomopteris&quot; emits yellow light.

The most frequently encountered bioluminescent organisms may be the dinoflagellates in the surface layers of the sea, which are responsible for the sparkling luminescence sometimes seen at night in disturbed water. At least 18 genera of these phytoplankton exhibit luminosity. Luminescent dinoflagellate ecosystems are present in warm water lagoons and bays with narrow openings to the ocean. A different effect is the thousands of square miles of the ocean which shine with the light produced by bioluminescent bacteria, known as mareel or the milky seas effect. 
=== Pelagic zone ===
Bioluminescence is abundant in the pelagic zone, with the most concentration at depths devoid of light and surface waters at night. These organisms participate in diurnal vertical migration from the dark depths to the surface at night, dispersing the population of bioluminescent organisms across the pelagic water column. The dispersal of bioluminescence across different depths in the pelagic zone has been attributed to the selection pressures imposed by predation and the lack of places to hide in the open sea. In depths where sunlight never penetrates, often below 200m, the significance of bioluminescent is evident in the retainment of functional eyes for organisms to detect bioluminescence.

==== Bacterial symbioses ====

Organisms often produce bioluminescence themselves, rarely do they generate it from outside phenomena. However, there are occasions where bioluminescence is produced by bacterial symbionts that have a symbiotic relationship with the host organism. Although many luminous bacteria in the marine environment are free-living, a majority are found in symbiotic relationships that involve fish, squids, crustaceans etc. as hosts. Most luminous bacteria inhabit the sea, dominated by &quot;Photobacterium&quot; and &quot;Vibrio&quot;.

In the symbiotic relationship, bacterium benefit from having a source of nourishment and a refuge to grow. Hosts obtain these bacterial symbionts either from the environment, spawning, or the luminous bacterium is evolving with their host. Coevolutionary interactions are suggested as host organisms&#x27; anatomical adaptations have become specific to only certain luminous bacteria, to suffice ecological dependence of bioluminescence.

=== Benthic zone ===

Bioluminescence is widely studied amongst species located in the mesopelagic zone, but the benthic zone at mesopelagic depths has remained widely unknown. Benthic habitats at depths beyond the mesopelagic are also poorly understood due to the same constraints. Unlike the pelagic zone where the emission of light is undisturbed in the open sea, the occurrence of bioluminescence in the benthic zone is less common. It has been attributed to the blockage of emitted light by a number of sources such as the sea floor, and inorganic and organic structures. Visual signals and communication that is prevalent in the pelagic zone such as counter-illumination may not be functional or relevant in the benthic realm. Bioluminescence in bathyal benthic species still remains poorly studied due to difficulties of the collection of species at these depths.

==Uses in nature==

Bioluminescence has several functions in different taxa. Steven Haddock et al. (2010) list as more or less definite functions in marine organisms the following: defensive functions of startle, counterillumination (camouflage), misdirection (smoke screen), distractive body parts, burglar alarm (making predators easier for higher predators to see), and warning to deter settlers; offensive functions of lure, stun or confuse prey, illuminate prey, and mate attraction/recognition. It is much easier for researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light than to analyze the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light serves. In some cases the function is unknown, as with species in three families of earthworm (Oligochaeta), such as &quot;Diplocardia longa,&quot; where the coelomic fluid produces light when the animal moves. The following functions are reasonably well established in the named organisms.

===Counterillumination camouflage===

In many animals of the deep sea, including several squid species, bacterial bioluminescence is used for camouflage by counterillumination, in which the animal matches the overhead environmental light as seen from below. In these animals, photoreceptors control the illumination to match the brightness of the background. These light organs are usually separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria. However, in one species, &quot;Euprymna scolopes&quot;, the bacteria are an integral component of the animal&#x27;s light organ.

===Attraction===
Bioluminescence is used in a variety of ways and for different purposes. The cirrate octopod &quot;Stauroteuthis syrtensis&quot; uses emits bioluminescence from its sucker like structures. These structures are believed to have evolved from what are more commonly known as octopus suckers. They do not have the same function as the normal suckers because they no longer have any handling or grappling ability due its evolution of photophores. The placement of the photophores are within the animals oral reach, which leads researchers to suggest that it uses it bioluminescence to capture and lure prey.

Fireflies use light to attract mates. Two systems are involved according to species; in one, females emit light from their abdomens to attract males; in the other, flying males emit signals to which the sometimes sedentary females respond. Click beetles emit an orange light from the abdomen when flying and a green light from the thorax when they are disturbed or moving about on the ground. The former is probably a sexual attractant but the latter may be defensive. Larvae of the click beetle &quot;Pyrophorus nyctophanus&quot; live in the surface layers of termite mounds in Brazil. They light up the mounds by emitting a bright greenish glow which attracts the flying insects on which they feed.

In the marine environment, use of luminescence for mate attraction is chiefly known among ostracods, small shrimp-like crustaceans, especially in the family Cyprididae. Pheromones may be used for long-distance communication, with bioluminescence used at close range to enable mates to &quot;home in&quot;. A polychaete worm, the Bermuda fireworm creates a brief display, a few nights after the full moon, when the female lights up to attract males.

===Defense===

The defense mechanisms for bioluminescent organisms can come in multiple forms; startling prey, counter-illumination, smoke screen or misdirection, distractive body parts, burglar alarm, sacrificial tag or warning coloration. The shrimp family Oplophoridae Dana use their bioluminescence as a way of startling the predator that is after them. &quot;Acanthephyra purpurea&quot;, within the Oplophoridae family, uses its photophores to emit light, and can secrete a bioluminescent substance when in the presence of a predator. This secretory mechanism is common among prey fish.

Many cephalopods, including at least 70 genera of squid, are bioluminescent. Some squid and small crustaceans use bioluminescent chemical mixtures or bacterial slurries in the same way as many squid use ink. A cloud of luminescent material is expelled, distracting or repelling a potential predator, while the animal escapes to safety. The deep sea squid &quot;Octopoteuthis deletron&quot; may autotomize portions of its arms which are luminous and continue to twitch and flash, thus distracting a predator while the animal flees.

Dinoflagellates may use bioluminescence for defense against predators. They shine when they detect a predator, possibly making the predator itself more vulnerable by attracting the attention of predators from higher trophic levels. Grazing copepods release any phytoplankton cells that flash, unharmed; if they were eaten they would make the copepods glow, attracting predators, so the phytoplankton&#x27;s bioluminescence is defensive. The problem of shining stomach contents is solved (and the explanation corroborated) in predatory deep-sea fishes: their stomachs have a black lining able to keep the light from any bioluminescent fish prey which they have swallowed from attracting larger predators.

The sea-firefly is a small crustacean living in sediment. At rest it emits a dull glow but when disturbed it darts away leaving a cloud of shimmering blue light to confuse the predator. During World War II it was gathered and dried for use by the Japanese army as a source of light during clandestine operations.

The larvae of railroad worms (&quot;Phrixothrix&quot;) have paired photic organs on each body segment, able to glow with green light; these are thought to have a defensive purpose. They also have organs on the head which produce red light; they are the only terrestrial organisms to emit light of this color.

===Warning===

Aposematism is a widely used function of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; some millipedes glow for the same purpose. Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but further research is needed to fully establish the function of the luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way. The limpet &quot;Latia neritoides&quot; is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail &quot;Hinea brasiliana&quot; uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.

===Communication===

Communication in the form of quorum sensing plays a role in the regulation of luminescence in many species of bacteria. Small extracellularly secreted molecules stimulate the bacteria to turn on genes for light production when cell density, measured by concentration of the secreted molecules, is high.

Pyrosomes are colonial tunicates and each zooid has a pair of luminescent organs on either side of the inlet siphon. When stimulated by light, these turn on and off, causing rhythmic flashing. No neural pathway runs between the zooids, but each responds to the light produced by other individuals, and even to light from other nearby colonies. Communication by light emission between the zooids enables coordination of colony effort, for example in swimming where each zooid provides part of the propulsive force.

Some bioluminous bacteria infect nematodes that parasitize Lepidoptera larvae. When these caterpillars die, their luminosity may attract predators to the dead insect thus assisting in the dispersal of both bacteria and nematodes. A similar reason may account for the many species of fungi that emit light. Species in the genera &quot;Armillaria&quot;, &quot;Mycena&quot;, &quot;Omphalotus&quot;, &quot;Panellus&quot;, &quot;Pleurotus&quot; and others do this, emitting usually greenish light from the mycelium, cap and gills. This may attract night-flying insects and aid in spore dispersal, but other functions may also be involved.

&quot;Quantula striata&quot; is the only known bioluminescent terrestrial mollusk. Pulses of light are emitted from a gland near the front of the foot and may have a communicative function, although the adaptive significance is not fully understood.

===Mimicry===
Bioluminescence is used by a variety of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the anglerfish and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to within striking distance of the fish.

The cookiecutter shark uses bioluminescence to camouflage its underside by counter-illumination, but a small patch near its pectoral fins remains dark, appearing as a small fish to large predatory fish like tuna and mackerel swimming beneath it. When such fish approach the lure, they are bitten by the shark.

Female &quot;Photuris&quot; fireflies sometimes mimic the light pattern of another firefly, &quot;Photinus&quot;, to attract its males as prey. In this way they obtain both food and the defensive chemicals named lucibufagins, which &quot;Photuris&quot; cannot synthesize.

South American giant cockroaches of the genus &quot;Lucihormetica&quot; were believed to be the first known example of defensive mimicry, emitting light in imitation of bioluminescent, poisonous click beetles. However, doubt has been cast on this assertion, and there is no conclusive evidence that the cockroaches are bioluminescent.

=== Illumination ===

While most marine bioluminescence is green to blue, some deep sea barbeled dragonfishes in the genera &quot;Aristostomias&quot;, &quot;Pachystomias&quot; and &quot;Malacosteus&quot; emit a red glow. This adaptation allows the fish to see red-pigmented prey, which are normally invisible to other organisms in the deep ocean environment where red light has been filtered out by the water column. These fish are able to utilize the longer wavelength to act as a spotlight for its prey that only they can see. The fish may also use this light to communicate with each other to find potential mates. The ability of the fish to see this light is explained by the presence of specialized rhodopsin pigment. The mechanism of light creation is through a suborbital photophore that utilizes gland cells which produce exergonic chemical reactions that produce light with a longer, red wavelength. The dragonfish species which produce the red light also produce blue light in photophore on the dorsal area. The main function of this is to alert the fish to the presence of its prey. The additional pigment is thought to be assimilated from chlorophyll derivatives found in the copepods which form part of its diet.

The angler siphonophore (&quot;Erenna&quot;) utilizes red bioluminescence in appendages to lure fish.

==Biotechnology==

===Biology and medicine===
Bioluminescent organisms are a target for many areas of research. Luciferase systems are widely used in genetic engineering as reporter genes, each producing a different color by fluorescence, and for biomedical research using bioluminescence imaging. For example, the firefly luciferase gene was used as early as 1986 for research using transgenic tobacco plants. &quot;Vibrio&quot; bacteria symbiose with marine invertebrates such as the Hawaiian bobtail squid (&quot;Euprymna scolopes&quot;), are key experimental models for bioluminescence. Bioluminescent activated destruction is an experimental cancer treatment.

&quot;In Vivo&quot; luminescence cell and animal imaging uses dyes and fluorescent proteins as chromophores. The characteristics of each chromophore determine which cell area(s) will be targeted and illuminated.

===Light production===

The structures of photophores, the light producing organs in bioluminescent organisms, are being investigated by industrial designers. Engineered bioluminescence could perhaps one day be used to reduce the need for street lighting, or for decorative purposes if it becomes possible to produce light that is both bright enough and can be sustained for long periods at a workable price. The gene that makes the tails of fireflies glow has been added to mustard plants. The plants glow faintly for an hour when touched, but a sensitive camera is needed to see the glow. University of Wisconsin–Madison is researching the use of genetically engineered bioluminescent E. coli bacteria, for use as bioluminescent bacteria in a light bulb. In 2011, Philips launched a microbial system for ambience lighting in the home. An iGEM team from Cambridge (England) has started to address the problem that luciferin is consumed in the light-producing reaction by developing a genetic biotechnology part that codes for a luciferin regenerating enzyme from the North American firefly. In 2016, Glowee, a French company started selling bioluminescent lights for shop fronts and street signs, for use between 1 and 7 in the morning when the law forbids use of electricity for this purpose. They used the bioluminescent bacterium &quot;Aliivibrio fischeri&quot;, but the maximum lifetime of their product was three days. In April 2020, plants were genetically engineered to glow more brightly using genes from the bioluminescent mushroom &quot;Neonothopanus nambi&quot; to convert caffeic acid into luciferin.
Another possible application is to replace chemiluminescence with bioluminescent enzymes. A Canadian company, Lux Bio, is developing long-duration bioluminescent enzymes for this purpose.

=== ATP bioluminescence ===

ATP bioluminescence is the process in which ATP is used to generate luminescence in an organism, in conjunction with other compounds such as luciferin. It proves to be a very good biosensor to test for the presence of living microbes in water. Different types of microbial populations are determined through different sets of ATP assays using other substrates and reagents. &quot;Renilla&quot;- and &quot;Gaussia&quot;-based cell viability assays use the substrate coelenterazine.

<text>Prince Phetsarath Ratanavongsa (&quot;Somdej Chao Maha Uparaja Petsaraj Ratanavongsa &quot;() (19 January 1890 – 14 October 1959) was the 1st Prime Minister of Luang Phrabang in French Laos from 21 August 1941 to 10 October 1945, and Head of State of Laos between 12 October 1945 and 24 April 1946.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Phetsarath was born on 19 January 1890 in the Kingdom of Luang Phrabang, Siam, the second son of Oupahat Bounkhong and his second wife, Princess Thongsy. One of his younger brothers was Souvanna Phouma. Bounkong&#x27;s eleventh wife was the mother of Souphanouvong. Luang Phrabang became a French protectorate in 1893. Phetsarath went to study at the colonial Lycée Chasseloup-Laubat in Saigon and continued on in 1905 at the Lycée Montaigne and to the École coloniale in Paris. He returned to Laos in 1912, married Princess Nhin Kham Venne in 1913, and started working as an interpreter for his father.

===Government service: 1914–1941===
In 1914, he became a clerk at the Office of the French governor in Vientiane. Two years later he was promoted to assistant secretary to the French governor. In 1919 he received the title of Somdeth Chao Ratsaphakhinay, a title held by his father and one of the highest ranks in the country. That same year he was named Director of Indigenous Affairs of Laos operating under the French governor in Laos.

As the country&#x27;s last uparaja, he became a leading figure of modern Laos. He established the system of ranks and titles of the civil service, promotion and pension plans, and created a Lao consultative assembly, reorganized the king&#x27;s Advisory Council. Phetsarath reorganized the administrative system of the Buddhist clergy, and established a system of schools for educating monks in Pali. He created the Institute of Law and Administration to train entry level officers (Samien) who would then move up the ladder as Phouxouei, Chao Meuang, and Chao Khoueng successively. He set up rules to reward, reassign, and promote deserving civil servants, and created the judicial system, including civil and penal codes.

===Japanese occupation and Lao Issara: 1941–1957===

Phetsarath played a dominant role in Lao politics before and after the Japanese occupation. He was the Prime Minister of Luang Phrabang, beginning in August 1941, ascending in prominence under the promises for power from Japan. From 1941 to 1945, Phetsarath attempted to supplant officials in Laos and Vietnam, but in the regions of Vietnam, the resistance from the local proletariat was too strong.

In March 1945 Japan overthrew the French rule in all of Indochina, including Laos. On 8 April 1945 King Sisavang Vong had declared–under Japanese pressure and at the urging of Phetsarath–that his kingdom was no longer a French protectorate. Shortly thereafter however, on 28 August 1945, Japan surrendered. 

In the ensuing power vacuum, Phetsarath moved to unite the southern provinces of Laos with Luang Phrabang. This put him at odds with the pro-French King Sisavang Vong, who had agreed with the French that he intended to have the country resume its former status as a French colony. Phetsarath sent a telegram to all Laotian provincial governors notifying them that the Japanese surrender did not affect Laos&#x27; status as independent and warning them to resist any foreign intervention. On 15 September Phetsarath declared a unified Kingdom of Laos which led the King to dismiss him from his post as Prime Minister on 10 October.

Phetsarath and other Lao nationalists then created the Lao Issara (&quot;Free Laos&quot;) movement and took control of the country. The Lao Issara provisional assembly under Phetsarath proclaimed the deposition of the King and appointed Phetsarath as &quot;Head of State&quot;. As the French retook control of Laos, Phetsarath fled in April 1946 to Thailand, where he led the Lao Issara government-in-exile. The group was dissolved in 1949 and its former members were allowed to return to Laos under amnesty.

===Return: 1957–1959===
In March 1957, he returned to Vientiane where he received a wild welcome. On 10 April 1957, he traveled to Luang Prabang by car and was received by an enormous crowd of citizens, government officials, and members of the police and the army. On 16 April he paid a courtesy call to King Sisavang Vong and was given back his old title of Uparaja of the Kingdom of Laos. In December 1957 he visited Samneua and Phongsaly where Souphanouvong symbolically offered the return of the Pathet Lao&#x27;s two regrouping provinces to the Kingdom of Laos.

He was offered an official government residence in Vientiane, but preferred to stay in his villa, Xieng Keo, in Luang Prabang with his Thai consort, Mom Aphiphorn. In early October 1959 the Phoui Sananikone Government decided to use Phetsarath&#x27;s official residence in Vientiane as the new prime minister&#x27;s office. They vacated the building and shipped his personal belongings by boat to Luang Prabang, which upset him immensely. On 14 October 1959 Phetsarath was taken ill to the hospital, suffering from a severe brain hemorrhage. A French doctor operated on him, but it was already too late. He never regained consciousness and he died at the age of 69.

In part because of his popularity and in part because of his perceived &quot;shakti/shiva&quot; power, many Lao people hang his picture in their homes.

<doc id="203718" wikidata="Q7759745" url="?curid=203718" title="The Rebel Angels">
<text>The Rebel Angels is novel by Canadian author Robertson Davies. First published by Macmillan of Canada in 1981, &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot; is the first of the three connected novels of Davies&#x27; Cornish Trilogy. It was followed by &quot;What&#x27;s Bred in the Bone&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Lyre of Orpheus&quot; (1988). 

Like the rest of the Cornish Trilogy, the novel takes place in the same universe as the Deptford Trilogy, with the major characters Clement Hollier and John Parlabane being alums of Colborne College (the college where Dunstan Ramsay taught history in &quot;Fifth Business&quot;) and former classmates of Boy Staunton&#x27;s son David.

==Plot==

&quot;The Rebel Angels&quot; follows several faculty and staff of the fictional College of St. John and Holy Ghost, affectionately referred to as &quot;Spook&quot;. The story, like many of Davies&#x27;, is notable for very strongly drawn and memorable characters:

* The defrocked monk Parlabane, a brilliant and sinister sodomite with a thundering voice and voracious appetite;
* Anglican priest and professor of New Testament Greek Simon Darcourt;
* Maria Theotoky, a graduate student researching Rabelais;
* Clement Hollier, a frazzled and absentminded professor; and 
* Urquhart McVarish, a greedy and manipulative counterpoint to Hollier.

The novel&#x27;s narration alternates between Theotoky&#x27;s and Darcourt&#x27;s points of view. Darcourt is attempting to write a history of the university based on Aubrey&#x27;s &quot;Brief Lives&quot;.

Much of the story is set in motion by the death of eccentric art patron and collector Francis Cornish. Hollier, McVarish, and Darcourt are the executors of Cornish&#x27;s complicated will, which includes material that Hollier wants for his studies. The deceased&#x27;s nephew Arthur Cornish, who stands to inherit the fortune, is also a character.

==Background==

Many of the characters (including Parlabane and McVarish) were based on college acquaintances of Davies; their stories are recounted in Judith Skelton Grant&#x27;s biography &quot;Robertson Davies: Man of Myth&quot; (1994) and Brian Busby&#x27;s &quot;Character Parts: Who&#x27;s Really Who in CanLit&quot; (2003). As well, many believe that Davies based the College of St. John and the Holy Ghost (or &quot;Spook&quot; as it is affectionately called in the novel) on Toronto&#x27;s Trinity College. Evidence for this connection includes numerous similarities between the fictional and the real life college (including architectural style, layout of rooms, age, and religious affiliation); the fact that Davies taught at Trinity College for twenty years and lived across the street from Trinity while master of Massey College; and perhaps most convincingly that a picture of Trinity&#x27;s central tower is prominently featured on the cover of the novel&#x27;s first edition. Equally plausible is the belief that Ploughwright College in the book is patterned after Davies&#x27;s own Massey College. This connection is supported by the fact that much of the fortune donated by the Massey family to the University of Toronto for the founding of Massey College was originally made in the manufacture of farm equipment. Like the real-life Massey College, Ploughwright is a graduate college where scholars are invited to partake in interdisciplinary discussions and High Table dinners.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #45, and stated, &quot;Not for the squeamish, it features a murder whose inventive nastiness makes the destruction of whole shiploads of the people in &quot;Downbelow Station&quot; pale into insignificance.&quot;

The book was published less than five years after an influx of Czech-Roma immigrants occurred in Canada. In a 1998 fact sheet about Roma in Canada, Ronald Lee wrote that in its wake, &quot;media was carried away with the mythological, racist and stereotypical image of the Romani people created by Victorian writers, and perpetuated by such recent pundits of Canadian literature as the late Robertson Davies [in &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot;] where Roma were portrayed as magical, surrealistic, phantasmagoric, light-fingered, characters likely to pick the pockets of Canadians in general.&quot;

<text>An assistance dog is a dog that receives specialized training to aid an individual with a disability in navigating everyday life. Assistance dogs can be trained by an organization, or by their handler.

== Terminology ==
&#x27;Assistance dog&#x27; is the internationally established term for a dog that provides assistance to a disabled person and is task-trained to help mitigate the handler&#x27;s disability. In the United States, assistance dogs are also commonly referred to as &#x27;service dogs&#x27;.

Assistance dogs are not emotional support animals (ESAs), which are generally not protected by the same laws and typically have little to no training compared to an assistance or service dog. Assistance dogs and ESAs are also both distinct from therapy dogs. While therapy dogs are required to undergo training and become certified, they work for people other than their handler and are not covered by laws such as the US Americans with Disabilities Act.

==Distinctive features==

For a dog to be considered an assistance dog, they must meet the following criteria:

# The dog&#x27;s handler must meet the legal definition of disability in a specific country or region.
# The dog must be specifically trained to mitigate the handler&#x27;s disability in some way,--e.g. opening doors, detecting high blood sugar or allergens and notifying of such, alerting to a ringing phone or other audible stimuli, assisting handlers with PTSD, assisting those who are visual impaired, helping individuals with disabilities that affect their mobility, and much more.
# The dog must be docile and well-behaved, as well as clean and healthy.
Individual countries and regions will have specific laws and regulations, with these international criteria having broad recognition across the globe. In many countries, notably in Europe, assistance dogs must be certified by a State-recognized body to enjoy the legal protections.

== Training process ==
Assistance dogs have traditionally been trained by organizations. In a few countries, such as the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, assistance dogs can also be trained by their handlers but in most countries, only dogs trained and certified by an officially recognized organization can be recognized as assistance dogs and enjoy the associated legal protections.

A prospective assistance dog candidate will go through socialization and desensitization training, where the dog is exposed to unfamiliar locations, sounds, scents, and other stimuli. This training sets the foundations for the assistance dog to remain focused while working. An assistance dog prospect will also go through obedience training to ensure they remain under control of the handler.

After completing obedience training, an assistance dog commences specialized task training. During this training, the assistance dog will learn to perform tasks that will aid their disabled handler. The tasks that an assistance dog is trained to perform will differ based on the handler&#x27;s disabilities and needs.

Examples of tasks include alerting to a fire alarm or doorbell, retrieving a medication during a medical episode, pulling a wheelchair, retrieving an item that has been dropped by the handler, and turning on lights. Some tasks may require a larger dog with healthy joints, while others (e.g. alerting to a sound) can be performed by a dog of any size.

==Types==

Common examples of assistance dogs include: 
* Guide dogs
* Hearing dogs
* Mobility assistance dogs
* Medical response dogs
* Seizure response dogs
* Psychiatric assistance dogs
* Autism assistance dogs

In the United States, the Americans with Disability Act states that there is no formal certification or registration required for a dog to become an Assistance Dog. State and local governments, businesses, and nonprofit organizations that serve the public generally must allow service animals to accompany people with disabilities in all areas of the facility where the public is normally allowed to go.

<text>Cristal is the flagship &quot;cuvée&quot; of Champagne Louis Roederer, created in 1876 for Alexander II, tsar of Russia.

==History==

Champagne increased in popularity with the Russian nobility from 1855 onwards. An especially popular brand was Louis Roederer&#x27;s, who shipped a third of his production to Russia.

Cristal was first created for Alexander II of Russia, and is viewed by many as the first &quot;prestige cuvée&quot;. As the political situation in Russia at the time of his rule was unstable, the Tsar feared assassination. Thus when he visited Paris in 1867 for the Exposition Universelle, the Tsar ordered that champagne bottles for the lavish dinner he hosted for the Prussian King Wilhelm I and Chancellor Otto von Bismarck (later termed the Three Emperors Dinner) be made clear, so that he could see the bubbles and also to prevent an explosive being hidden beneath them, as could happen with a typical dark green indented bottle. Louis Roederer commissioned a Flemish glassmaker to create a clear lead glass Champagne bottle with a flat bottom. The Champagne has since become known as &quot;Cristal&quot;.

The wine was not commercially available until 1945.

===Hip-hop culture===
In the mid 1990s to early 2000s, hip hop music discovered the brand, with several artists referencing the drink in song lyrics and as part of their public image, including Raekwon, 50 Cent, The Notorious B.I.G., R. Kelly, Diddy, Big L, Jeru the Damaja, Trina, and Jay-Z. Those in hip hop sometimes used the nickname &quot;Crissy&quot; for the drink. Tupac Shakur created a cocktail called &quot;Thug Passion&quot;, which is a blend of Alizé Gold Passion and Cristal.

In an interview with &quot;The Economist&quot; in 2006, Louis Roederer managing director Frederic Rouzaud said he viewed the attention from rappers with &quot;curiosity and serenity.&quot; Asked if he thought the association would harm the brand, he replied, &quot;that&#x27;s a good question, but what can we do? We can&#x27;t forbid people from buying it. I&#x27;m sure Dom Pérignon or Krug would be delighted to have their business.&quot;

Subsequent interpretations and reactions to these statements resulted in those associated with hip-hop culture disengaging from the brand. Jay-Z, for example, released a statement saying he would never &quot;drink Cristal or promote it in any way or serve it at any of [his] clubs&quot;. The loss of position in hip hop and Jay Z&#x27;s statement had no effect on sales of Cristal; output doubled from 400,000 bottles in 2004 to over 800,000 bottles in 2010.

==Production==
The 1974 vintage was the first release of a rosé Cristal. The grape composition is an approximately equal blend of Chardonnay and Pinot noir, while the rosé contains more Pinot noir, and is coloured with red wine via the &quot;saignée&quot; method rather than by the Pinot noir grape skins. The 2000 vintage was 55% Pinot Noir and 45% Chardonnay, with a dosage of 10 g/L.

Cristal had an annual production run of 300,000 to 400,000 bottles in the early to mid 2000s but that had doubled to 800,000 bottles by 2010.

Since 2012, all vintages of Cristal champagne are produced entirely from Demeter-certified, biodynamically-farmed fruit, which is a landmark for Maison Roederer.

==Collaboration==
In November 2024, it was reported that Singapore Airlines will be the sole airline serving Cristal 2015 champagne beginning 1 December 2024, through an exclusive agreement with Louis Roederer. The wine, blending 40% Chardonnay and 60% Pinot Noir, is crafted by Jean-Baptiste Lécaillon. The ingredients are sourced from 45 vineyard plots across Louis Roederer&#x27;s seven Grands Crus.

<text>Prince Souvanna Phouma (; 7 October 1901 – 10 January 1984) was the leader of the neutralist faction and Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos several times (1951–1954, 1956–1958, 1960, and 1962–1975).

==Early life==
Souvanna Phouma was the son of Bounkhong, the last vice-king of Luang Prabang and a nephew of King Sisavang Vong of Laos, given a French education in Hanoi, Paris and Grenoble, where he obtained his degree in architecture and engineering. He returned to his homeland in 1931, married Aline Claire Allard, the daughter of a French father and a Lao mother, and entered the Public Works Service of French Indochina.

Souvanna Phouma, together with his brother, Prince Phetsarath Rattanavongsa (1891–1959) and his half-brother, Prince Souphanouvong (1909–1995), around the end of World War II, joined the Lao Issara (Free Laos) movement established to counter the French occupation and its provisional Vientiane government (1945–46).

When the French reoccupied Laos, Souvanna fled to exile in Bangkok, but returned to Laos in 1949 as France began conceding autonomy to Laos.

Souvanna Phouma and his wife had four children including Mangkra Souvanna Phouma and Princess Moune, who married Perry J. Stieglitz, cultural-affairs attaché of the U.S. embassy.

==Prime Ministership==
In 1951, Souvanna became Prime Minister of Laos under the National Progressive Party banner with a landslide victory, winning 15 of the 39 seats in the National Assembly. He was prime minister until 1954.

After elections in December 1955, Souvanna Phouma returned to the prime ministership on a platform of national reconciliation. In August 1956 Souvanna and the Communist Pathet Lao, which his half-brother Souphanouvong headed agreed on broad proposals for a &#x27;government of national union&#x27;. Elections for 21 extra assembly seats were finally held in May 1958, with parties aligned with the Pathet Lao acquiring 13. Souphanouvong entered the government as Economic Minister. Another Pathet Lao leader, Phoumi Vongvichit, also acquired a Ministry.
In June 1958 Souvanna was again forced to resign by the rightists. The king accepted the vote as legal the next day when he signed Royal Ordinance No. 282, dismissing Souvanna Phouma&#x27;s government and giving powers provisionally to the Revolutionary Committee. Royal Ordinance No. 283, approved a provisional government formed by Prince Boun Oum, who acted as front man for Phoui Sananikone. He was one of the Three Princes, whom Sisavang Vatthana appointed to form a coalition government between the rightists and Pathet Lao but it collapsed, and the Laotian Civil War began.

Souvanna Phouma was elected President of National Assembly from May 1960 to August 1960 following the 1960 elections. 

After the end of the civil war he became an advisor to the new Lao PDR government and died in Vientiane in 1984.

<text>In geographic information systems, a feature is an object that can have a geographic location and other properties. Common types of geometries include points, arcs, and polygons. Carriageways and cadastres are examples of feature data. Features can be labeled when displayed on a map.

==Feature types==
The definition of features that share membership of a common theme is a &quot;feature type&quot;, though there are a number of terms for this characteristic, including &quot;category&quot;, &quot;feature class&quot;, &quot;group&quot;, &quot;layer&quot;, &quot;level&quot;, &quot;object&quot;, and &quot;theme&quot;.

&quot;Layer&quot; served as the traditional term of choice, but use of this word has declined, as data has become more object-oriented and less concerned with cartographic layering. 

Data modelers can use &quot;feature types&quot; to create a hierarchical structure. For example, a dataset may consist of types called highways, streets and lanes. The system may group these particular types together under a category called &quot;Roads&quot;.

<doc id="203726" wikidata="Q726751" url="?curid=203726" title="Varadero">
<text>Varadero (), also referred to as &quot;Playa Azul&quot; (Blue Beach), is a resort town in the province of Matanzas, Cuba, and one of the largest resort areas in the Caribbean. Varadero Beach is rated one of the world&#x27;s best beaches in TripAdvisor&#x27;s Traveler&#x27;s Choice Awards since 2019, ranking at number 9 as of January 2024. Common activities include fishing and excursions to Matanzas, Cárdenas, and the Península de Zapata.

==Geography==

Varadero is a two-hour drive east of central Havana. It is situated on the Hicacos Peninsula, between the Bay of Cárdenas and the Straits of Florida, some 140 km east of Havana, at the eastern end of the Via Blanca highway. The peninsula is only 1.2 km wide at its widest point and is separated from the island of Cuba by the Kawama Channel, separated from the mainland by the Laguna Paso Malo. This spit of land extends more than 20 kilometers from the mainland in a northeasterly direction and its tip, Punta Hicacos, is the northernmost point of the island of Cuba. Varadero&#x27;s town has three longitudinal avenues, intersected by 69 cross streets. At the northeastern end of the peninsula there is a nature reserve with virgin forests and beaches. The Hicacos Point Natural Park is a ecological preserve established in 1974. It contains the -long Cave of Ambrosio, Mangón Lake (home to 31 species of birds and 24 species of reptiles) and the ruins of the La Calavera (The Skull) Salt Works (one of the first salt works to be constructed by the Spanish in the New World). The cays developed off shore, such as Cayo Piedras and Cayo Cruz del Padre are the westernmost part of the Sabana-Camaguey Archipelago.

Juan Gualberto Gómez Airport, located 16 kilometers west of Varadero and situated west of the peninsula, is Varadero&#x27;s airport. It is the second-most important airport of the island after José Martí Airport in Havana, and serves international and domestic flights. It was finished in the 1990s and replaced the old Varadero airport.

== Economy ==
Havana and Varadero each have the greatest development in Cuba. Varadero generates and provides over 50,000 jobs with over 52 hotel facilities. Canada&#x27;s Blue Island and Spain&#x27;s Meliá, Iberostar and Globalia are some of the foreign companies that operate these hotels. A record 1.7 million foreign tourists visited the resort in 2017. Plans for the next three years exist to build at least 3,000 more rooms in five-star hotels, to add facilities including a theme park and a shopping mall, and to bring back the Festival de la Cancion, a music festival.

== Climate ==
The climate in Varadero is tropical, for it is at sea level at the tip of the island. Weather may change due to many factors such as exposure to hurricanes, windy tropical storms and by the cooling effect of the trade winds. It is surrounded by enormous bodies of water that can cool air flowing from North America. The yearly mean is 25˚ Celsius (77 ˚F). Summer mean is 27˚Celsius (80.6 ˚F), while winter mean is 21˚C (69.8 ˚F). Humidity is 81% and the average yearly rainfall is roughly 1,400 millimeters (55 inches). June 1 is the beginning of hurricane season; this normally ends on November 15. September and October are the months when hurricanes are most likely to occur.

Over 150 hurricanes have passed through the country of Cuba since 1498, when Christopher Columbus first recorded them. These hurricanes have caused significant damage to the Cuban economy and claimed many Cuban lives. One of the worst hurricanes occurred in 1791 and killed an estimated 3,000 Cubans. The most recent, Hurricane Irma, hit Varadero as a Category 5 storm on September 8, 2017. Irma claimed 10 Cuban lives and caused major flooding and wind damage. Meteorologists reported this hurricane as one of the biggest in the Atlantic and the strong winds were reported at 125 mph. Irma ripped many trees from the ground and roofs from homes. Much of Varadero was damaged, along with the country&#x27;s agricultural main crops such as sugar.

==History==
Varadero was mentioned for the first time in 1555. The place was first used as a dry dock (Spanish: &quot;varadero&quot;) and the salt mines of the peninsula (closed in 1961) supplied most of the Spanish Latin America Fleet since 1587. However, the foundation date of Varadero as city was only on December 5, 1887, when ten families from the city of Cárdenas obtained a permission to build their vacation homes between today&#x27;s 42nd and 48th Streets. Varadero village came about in the 1880s as a summer resort. The first homes with red roofs made of wood can still be seen along Avenida 1ra.

It was established as a municipality (Spanish: &quot;municipio&quot;) at the administrative re-distribution of July 3, 1976 from territories previously part of Cárdenas. In August 2010, the Varadero municipality was abolished according to a Law approved by the Cuban National Assembly, becoming again part of the Cárdenas municipality.

==Tourism==

Varadero is known as a tourist resort town, with more than 20 km of white sandy beaches. The first tourists visited Varadero as early as the 1870s, and for years it was considered an elite resort. In 1910 the annual rowing regatta was started; five years later the first hotel, named Varadero, which later was renamed Club Nautico, was built. Tourism grew in the early 1930s as Irénée du Pont, an American millionaire, built his estate on the peninsula (now Maison Xanadu or DuPont House). People who have stayed in the area include Al Capone.

After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, many mansions were expropriated from their rich owners. These mansions soon became museums. As a symbol of the new integrated tourism for Cubans and foreign visitors of all social classes, the Park of the 8000 Cubicles (Parque de las 8000 Taquillas) was built in 1960. Visitors could leave their belongings in the basement of the park, had access to sanitary installations and gastronomic services on the first floor, and could rent bathing articles and swimsuits. The surroundings of the park became the center of the city.

Between the 1960s and 1980s Varadero transformed itself into a cultural centre. During those years the central park (8000 Taquillas) (located between 44th and 46th Street) saw countless concerts, festivals and sporting events.

The 1990s brought the start of another hotel building campaign, mostly in the 4-star and 5-star segment. Many of the hotels are operated or co-owned by foreign businesses like Meliá, Barceló, TRYP, etc. (France&#x27;s Club Med used to have a property but has since left Varadero.) As international tourism was opened up, the local population expanded with the arrival of people, some in key economic positions, from other parts of Cuba. As a consequence, Varadero has lost much of its social and cultural life and its traditions. The central park, the cinema and various cultural meeting places were neglected in favor of a hotel-centred all-inclusive-tourism and finally closed. The International Carnival, an initiative of Cubans and foreigners started in the 1980s, also ceased.
In addition to the beach, Varadero has natural attractions such as caves and a chain of easily accessed virgin cays. There are also cultural, historical and environmental attractions in the vicinity, such as the cities of Matanzas and Cárdenas, the Zapata Peninsula and the resort of San Miguel de los Baños. Varadero, which is a free port, also possesses facilities for scuba diving, deep-sea fishing, yachting and other water sports.

Varadero receives more than 1 million tourists annually.

Varadero is primarily visited by European and Canadian tourists. The number of U.S. tourists visiting Varadero, although increasing, has been limited because of the U.S. government restrictions that make it difficult for U.S. citizens to visit Cuba as &quot;tourists&quot;, as defined by US rules.

Varadero is home to one of two Canadian Consulates in Cuba.

=== Activities and attractions ===

Varadero hotels offer catamaran cruises with snorkeling and a visit to the dolphin center, Delfinario, a coral-rimmed lagoon located 400 meters east of Marina Chapelín. Swimming and interacting with the dolphins along with dolphin shows are available here. Hotels can also supply kayaks or small boats for their guests. Fishing charts are available at Marlin Náutica y Marinas at Marina Chapelin. They also have sailboards and kiteboards.

Other attractions in the area include the amusement park Centro Todo En Uno, Puente Bacunayagua, and an electric-powered Hershey train.

Scuba diving is another attraction in Varadero. There are more than 30 dive sites, such as Parque Marino Cayo Piedras del Norte, where divers can view a sunken military vessel and a soviet military AN-24 aircraft, and Ojo de Mégano, which has an underwater cave east of Varadero.

=== Events and festivals ===
* Every year, in the month of June, Varadero hosts the Josone World Music Festival. Artists come to perform from different parts of Latin America and beyond. Concerts and open-air shows happen in different places of Varadero each year.

==Transportation==
===Air===

===Roads===
The main road is Autopista Sur, which begins before crossing the bridge over Laguna Paso Malo and ends at a cul de sac at Barceló Marina Palace. Traffic from Vía Blanca and Carretera a into the Barceló Marina Palace merges into Varadero on this road near Kawama Airport. The paved highway has two lanes in both directions for most of the route, but a portion is closed off reducing it to only a single lane in each direction. Side roads cross this road as regular intersections with only a partial cloverleaf at Laguna Paso Malo.

The main street is Avenida Primera (1ra) and runs along the oceanfront from Calle 8 in the west to Calle 64 in the East. In the Kawama suburb cross streets begin at Calle 1 and run eastward to Calle 64. Farther east the streets become lettered beginning with Calle A to L. Between Calles 23 and 54 you will find the old village.

===Bus operators===
There are several bus operators, some providing connections from resorts to town and others as public transit operators within the main town.

<text>Sisavang Vatthana () or sometimes Savang Vatthana (full title: &quot;Samdach Brhat Chao Mavattaha Sri Vitha Lan Xang Hom Khao Phra Rajanachakra Lao Phengdara Parama Sidha Khattiya Suriya Varman Brhat Maha Sri Savangsa Vadhana&quot;; 13 November 1907 – 13 May 1978) was the last king of the Kingdom of Laos and the 6th prime minister of Laos serving from 29 October to 21 November 1951. He ruled from 1959 after his father&#x27;s death until his forced abdication in 1975. His rule ended with the takeover by the Pathet Lao in 1975, after which he and his family were sent to a re-education camp by the new government.

==Early life==
Prince Savang Vatthana was born on 13 November 1907 at the Royal Palace of Luang Prabang, the son of King Sisavang Vong and Queen Kham-Oun I. He was the second of five children along with Princess Khampheng, Princess Sammathi, Prince Sayasack, and Prince Souphantharangsri. He was also a distant cousin of Prince Souvanna Phouma and Prince Souphanouvong. At the age of 10, Prince Savang was sent to study in France. He attended a &quot;lycée&quot; in Montpellier and obtained a degree from École Libre des Sciences Politiques (now called Sciences Po) in Paris, where French diplomats were trained. The young heir continued his studies in France, and after a decade overseas, he could no longer speak Lao. Upon his return, he had to be instructed by a palace functionary for years.

On 7 August 1930, he married Queen Khamphoui and they had five children, Crown Prince Vong Savang, Prince Sisavang Savang, Prince Sauryavong Savang, Princess Savivanh Savang, and Princess Thala Savang. The family played tennis together, and liked to attend major tournaments on their travels abroad. The prince was also a devout Buddhist and became an authority on the &quot;Sangha&quot;, and would later take his role as protector of the state religion seriously.
During World War II, he represented his father with the Japanese forces. His father sent him to the Japanese headquarters in Saigon, where he vigorously protested about the Japanese actions, when they invaded Laos and forced them to declare independence from France.

==King of Laos==

In 1951, Savang served as prime minister, and when his father became ill on 20 August 1959, he was named Regent. On 29 October 1959, he informally acceded upon the death of his father. He was, however, never officially crowned king, deferring his coronation until the cessation of civil war.

The king was active in politics as he was trying to stabilize Laos after the political turmoil started with the Geneva Conference of July 1954, which granted full independence to the country but did not settle the issue of who would rule. As a result, the position of prime minister was disputed between three princes: Prince Souvanna Phouma, a neutralist, operated from Vientiane, whose claim was recognized by the Soviet Union; Prince Boun Oum of Champassak in the south, right-wing and pro-United States, dominated the Pakse area and was recognized as prime minister by the US; and in the far north, Prince Souphanouvong led the leftist Pathet Lao resistance movement, drawing support from North Vietnam and having his claim backed of the Communists. To avoid argument over whether any of the three princes was the &quot;legitimate&quot; Prime Minister, all sides would deal through the pro-Western king.

In 1961, a majority of the National Assembly had already voted Boun Oum into power and the king left Luang Prabang, visiting the capital to give the new government his blessing. In 1962, the king formed a coalition government which soon collapsed.

In March 1963, accompanied by his prime minister, Souvanna Phouma, the king toured 13 countries signatory to the Geneva Conference that guaranteed the &quot;neutrality&quot; of the Kingdom of Laos on &quot;diplomatic missions&quot;, starting with the USSR, where he received gifts of GAZ-13 &quot;Chaika&quot; limousines, before meeting US president John F. Kennedy in Washington, D.C.

In 1964, a series of coups and countercoups resulted in the final alignment of the Pathet Lao on one side and the neutralist and right-wing factions on the other. From this point, the Pathet Lao refused to join any offers of coalition or national elections and the Laotian Civil War began.

==Abdication and death==
On 23 August 1975, Pathet Lao forces entered Vientiane, the last city to be captured. The Phouma Government became effectively powerless for the next few months. On 2 December, Vatthana was forced to abdicate the throne by the Pathet Lao, abolishing the 600-year-old monarchy, and was appointed to the meaningless position of &quot;Supreme Advisor to the President&quot;. He refused to leave the country and in 1976 he surrendered the royal palace to the Lao Government, which turned it into a museum, and moved to a nearby private residence where he was later placed under house arrest. In March 1977, fearing Vatthana might escape to lead a resistance, the Communist authorities arrested him along with the Queen, Crown Prince Vong Savang, Prince Sisavang, and his brothers Princes Souphantharangsri and Thongsouk and sent them to the northern province of Viengxai. He was transported to Xam Neua and imprisoned in &quot;Camp Number One,&quot; which held high-ranking officials from the former government. During his time in the camp, he and other members of the royal family were allowed to move freely around their compounds during the day, and were often visited by members of the politburo, including Souphanouvong himself. Vatthana was the oldest prisoner in the camp and turned 70 during the earlier months of his imprisonment, whereas the average age of prisoners was around 55.

In 1978, the government reported that Vatthana, Queen Khamphoui, and Crown Prince Vong Savang had died from malaria. The &quot;World Press Review&quot; reported that they had suffered from the effects of forced labor and starvation. More recent accounts suggest that the King died in mid-March 1980. However, according to Kaysone Phomvihane, Vatthana died in 1984, at the age of 77. Following the deaths of Vatthana and the Crown Prince, the King&#x27;s youngest son, Sauryavong Savang, became the head of the Laotian royal family, acting as regent for his nephew Crown Prince, Soulivong Savang, until the regent died in Paris in 2018.

<text>The Deptford Trilogy (published 1970 to 1975) is a series of inter-related novels by Canadian novelist Robertson Davies.

==Overview==

The trilogy consists of &quot;Fifth Business&quot; (1970), &quot;The Manticore&quot; (1972), and &quot;World of Wonders&quot; (1975). The series revolves around a precipitating event: a young boy throws a snowball at another, hitting a pregnant woman instead, who goes into premature labor. It explores the longterm effects of these events on numerous characters. 

The Deptford trilogy has won praise for its narrative voice and its characterizations. The main characters originate from the same small village. Each carries a secret that crosses the lives of the others and drives the plot forward. &quot;Fifth Business&quot; is considered one of Davies&#x27; best novels. The second novel, &quot;The Manticore&quot;, won the Governor-General&#x27;s Literary Award in the English-language fiction category in 1972.

The trilogy was named for its setting in the fictional village of Deptford, Ontario. This is based in part on Davies&#x27; native Thamesville. Davies takes the view of different characters in each novel, and expresses each in a different style. The tone and unconventional literary devices of metafiction have led some later critics to suggest the series was a precursor to what has been called &quot;slipstream&quot; fiction in the 21st century.

==&quot;Fifth Business&quot;==

&quot;Fifth Business&quot; is narrated by Dunstable (later Dunstan) Ramsay, who grows up in Deptford, a fictional town in southwestern Ontario, Canada. After World War I, he becomes a teacher and serves for decades at a college. The epistolary novel takes the form of a letter Ramsay writes to the headmaster of Colborne College after his retirement. He feels ill used by an article about him in the school paper. He recalls how, as a boy, he ducked a snowball intended for him. It hit a pregnant woman instead, and she gave birth prematurely. This incident and related events deeply affected Ramsay&#x27;s life. He tells how he came to terms with his guilt. He also tells of his boyhood friend and enemy, Percy Boyd &quot;Boy&quot; Staunton, who becomes a wealthy businessman and politician.

==&quot;The Manticore&quot;==

&quot;The Manticore&quot; is the story of Boy Staunton&#x27;s only son, David, who undergoes Jungian psychoanalysis in Switzerland. During his therapy, he tries to understand his father and his relationship to him. The novel is a detailed record of his therapy and his coming to understand his own life. It sheds new light on many of the characters introduced in &quot;Fifth Business,&quot; including his father&#x27;s friend Dunstan Ramsay, who happens to be in Switzerland recuperating from a heart attack.

&quot;The Manticore&quot; won the Governor-General&#x27;s Literary Award in the English-language fiction category in 1972.

==&quot;World of Wonders&quot;==

&quot;World of Wonders&quot; tells of Paul Dempster, a boy born prematurely who is befriended by Dunstan Ramsay. He learns to conjure and, as an adult, takes the name of Magnus Eisengrim as he establishes a successful career as a noted magician. Eisengrim is to portray Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin in a television movie. During lulls in the filming, he recounts his life, including obstacles he has overcome. He elaborates on his career as an actor traveling through Canada in the early 20th century. Dunstan Ramsay also appears in this novel. More insight is provided into the characters of &quot;Fifth Business&quot;.

==Key characters==
===Dunstan Ramsay===
Dunstan Ramsay is the narrator of both &quot;Fifth Business&quot; and &quot;World of Wonders&quot; (he is not the protagonist in the last novel). He also appears as a major character in &quot;The Manticore&quot; and as a supporting character in several other novels by Davies. Ramsay is a gentle schoolmaster with surprising depths and is probably a stand-in for Davies himself. (Since Davies has said that the main business of a writer is to be an enchanter, a weaver of spells, a magician, Dempster/Eisengrim may stand for Davies.) Ramsay counsels his students to write in &quot;the plain style,&quot; as Davies does—to highlight the story rather than the writer.

Ramsay appears in Davies&#x27; novels &quot;What&#x27;s Bred in the Bone&quot; and &quot;The Lyre of Orpheus,&quot; two of his Cornish trilogy, and in the later novel &quot;The Cunning Man&quot;. Ramsay is not religious but he is fascinated by the lives of the saints. He writes several well-regarded treatises on saints. In the novels he is compared with Saint Dunstan in his struggle with Satan.

===Magnus Eisengrim===

Like several of the main characters in Davies&#x27; novels, Paul Dempster undergoes a series of symbolic rebirths, each of which is accompanied by a name change. Magnus Eisengrim is the final name taken on by Paul Dempster in the course of story told in the Deptford trilogy. The name is derived from &#x27;Isengrin&#x27;, a wolf in the stories of Reynard the Fox.
In &quot;World of Wonders&quot;, the final book of the Deptford trilogy, Magnus Eisengrim, now a world famous stage magician, relates his life story to several friends and colleagues as they work to complete a film about the life of the renowned 19th century theatrical magician Robert-Houdin.

As related by Eisengrim:
On December 28, 1908, Paul Dempster was born prematurely after his pregnant mother was hit in the head by a snowball thrown by Percy Boyd Staunton. As a result (it is assumed) of the mishap, she went insane. 

Paul is raised by his strict and religious father, but at age 10 Paul visits the traveling &#x27;World of Wonders&#x27; circus, where he is raped by Willard the Wizard, a performing sleight-of-hand magician with the troupe. To protect Willard, the troupe abducts and renames Paul. Traveling with the troupe under the assumed identity of Cass Fletcher, Paul endures a long period of continued psychological and physical abuse by Willard, but he also manages to learn the rudimentary skills of pick-pocketing, sleight of hand, and watch-repair. After eight hellish years, Paul escapes the World of Wonders and travels to France where, under a new assumed name, Faustus LeGrande, he becomes a traveling magician. Eventually, Willard dies. Although penniless, uneducated, and psychologically wounded, Paul, finally rid of his sodomizing tormentor, is at last able to begin shaping his own life in whatever way he wishes. 

After several years later, Paul makes his way to England, where, by a stroke of great luck, he becomes the stunt double for Sir John Tresize, a famous, aging English actor. As time goes by Paul (under the new assumed name, &quot;Fetch&quot;) begins to adopt Sir John&#x27;s personality and appearance until he has almost completely taken on Sir John&#x27;s persona.

<doc id="203741" wikidata="Q1841852" url="?curid=203741" title="List of cruisers of the United States Navy">
<text>This list of [[cruiser]]s of the [[United States Navy]] includes all ships that were ever called &quot;cruiser&quot;, either publicly or in internal documentation.

The Navy has 9 cruisers in active service, as of 10 October 2024, with the last tentatively scheduled for decommissioning in 2029. With the cancellation of the CG(X) program in 2010, the Navy currently has no cruiser replacement program planned. The Navy is looking to the Aegis-equipped destroyers to increasingly fill the role of the cruiser in the protection of the carrier strike group, as it could be well into the 2030s before any possible cruiser replacement program is up and running.

Ship status is indicated as either currently active [A] (including ready reserve), inactive [I], or precommissioning [P]. Ships in the inactive category include only ships in the inactive reserve, ships which have been disposed from US service have no listed status. Ships in the precommissioning category would include ships under construction or on order; as described above there currently are no such cruisers.

==Historical overview==
===Nomenclature===
Comprehension of the history of cruisers as shown in these lists requires some understanding of the unique role (sharing both independent and combined fleet operations) that cruisers were expected to support in the US fleet, and of the consequent influence this role had on design. In one example, the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ships issued a memorandum in 1947 listing the ways in which cruiser hulls differed from destroyer hulls, including details such as double hull construction, electrical generation and distribution, water mains for firefighting, fuel lines and tankage, and fresh water distillation.

CGN-9 &quot;Long Beach&quot;, commissioned in 1961, was the last US cruiser built on a true cruiser hull. All subsequent cruisers, including nuclear powered cruisers, were based on the less expensive and less capable destroyer hulls. The one attempt since &quot;Long Beach&quot; to revert to the advantages of a &quot;cruiser hull&quot; design was the canceled CSGN nuclear strike cruiser; the CSGN proposal mentioned the greater powerplant survivability from the separation of the two nuclear reactors in a cruiser hull over the adjacent reactors in a destroyer hull.

The sole example of a destroyer built on a cruiser hull was the experimental DL-1 &quot;Norfolk&quot;, which was originally classed as a hunter-killer cruiser (CLK).

===Overview of hull classifications===
Since the cruiser nomenclature predates the hull numbering system, and there were several confusing renumberings and renamings, there are multiple entries on these lists referring to the same physical ship. Combat history summaries (wars and battle stars) are listed only for the specific hull classification and number; for example, the World War II battle stars for a heavy cruiser (CA) and the Vietnam War battle stars for the same ship after its conversion to a guided missile cruiser (CG) are listed separately in each ship type list.

===Hull reclassifications and skipped hull numbers===
CA-1, CA-6 and CA-10 were never used, as ACR-1 &quot;Maine&quot;, ACR-6 &quot;California/San Diego&quot; and ACR-10 &quot;Tennessee/Memphis&quot; were lost prior to the 1920 redesignation, and their sisters&#x27; original hull numbers were carried over. CA-20 through CA-23 were skipped with the merger of the CA and CL sequences, which allowed the reclassification of the Washington Treaty CLs as CAs without re-numbering.

Heavy cruisers CA-149 and CA-151 to CA-153, light cruisers CL-154 to CL-159, and nuclear guided missile cruiser CGN-42 were canceled before being named.

Guided missile cruisers CG-1 through 8 and CG-10 through 12 were converted from World War II cruisers. CAG-1 USS &quot;Boston&quot; and CAG-2 USS &quot;Canberra&quot; retained most of their original gun armament and were later returned to their gun cruiser designations CA-69 and CA-70. CGN-9, &quot;Long Beach&quot;, originally held the last designation in the heavy-light cruiser sequence, CLGN-160.

CG-15 was skipped so the &quot;Leahy&quot;-class guided missile frigates (CG-16 class) could be redesignated without renumbering. The other missing numbers in the guided-missile cruiser series, 43–46, were not used so that DDG-47 &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and DDG-48 &quot;Yorktown&quot; could be similarly redesignated. (It has been argued in some sources that the DDG-993 guided missile destroyers, which were essentially identically armed to the s, should have been redesignated CG-43 through −46.)

Before 30 June 1975, CG-16 USS &quot;Leahy&quot; through CGN-38 USS &quot;Virginia&quot; were designated DLG or DLGN (Destroyer Leader, Guided Missile (Nuclear powered)). They were redesignated cruisers in the 1975 ship reclassification. CGN-39 USS &quot;Texas&quot; and CGN-40 USS &quot;Mississippi&quot; were laid down as DLGNs but redesignated CGN before commissioning. CG-47 &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and CG-48 &quot;Yorktown&quot; were ordered as guided missile destroyers (DDG) but were redesignated to guided missile cruisers (CG) before any ship was laid down. CGN-41 &quot;Arkansas&quot; and CG-49 through 73 were ordered, laid down and delivered as guided missile cruisers, although as &quot;Virginia&quot; or &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class ships they had not been designed as cruisers.

==Cruisers without hull designations==
===First cruisers===
The first three modern cruisers in the Navy, the &quot;Atlanta&quot;, &quot;Boston&quot;, and &quot;Chicago&quot;, were most successful as technology demonstrators that stimulated the US industrial base, with features such as steel hulls and electricity generation. Their technology proved so operationally decisive they came to be seen as the dividing line between the &quot;Old Navy&quot; and the &quot;New Navy&quot;. The last two protected cruisers which initially served without hull classification numbers, the &quot;New Orleans&quot; and &quot;Albany&quot;, were purchased from a British builder during mobilization for the 1898 Spanish–American War.

* &quot;Atlanta&quot; (1884), protected cruiser
* &quot;Boston&quot; (1884), protected cruiser – Spanish–American War, later &quot;Despatch&quot; (IX-2)
* &quot;Chicago&quot; (1885), protected cruiser
* &quot;Vesuvius&quot; (1888), experimental dynamite guns – Spanish–American War

&quot;New Orleans&quot; class
* &quot;New Orleans&quot; (1898), ex-Brazilian &quot;Amazonas&quot; – Spanish–American War, WW1
* &quot;Albany&quot; (1899), ex-Brazilian &quot;Almirante Abreu&quot; – Spanish–American War, WW1

===Armed merchant cruisers===

Beginning in 1891 Congress subsidized a number of fast ocean liners with plans to requisition them in wartime. &quot;St. Louis&quot;, &quot;St. Paul&quot;, &quot;Harvard&quot;, and &quot;Yale&quot; were the largest and were chartered by the Navy for the Spanish–American War, and seven others were purchased in 1898.
* &quot;St. Louis&quot; (1894) – Spanish–American War
* &quot;St. Paul&quot; (1895) – Spanish–American War
* &quot;Harvard&quot; (1898), ex-SS &quot;City of New York&quot; – Spanish–American War, later WW1 as troopship USS &quot;Plattsburg&quot; SP-1645
* &quot;Yale&quot; (1889), ex-SS&quot;City of Paris&quot; – Spanish–American War, later WW1 as troopship USS &quot;Harrisburg&quot; ID-1663
* &quot;Badger&quot; (1889), ex-&quot;Yumuri&quot; – Spanish–American War
* &quot;Panther&quot; (1889), ex-&quot;Austin&quot; – Spanish–American War, later WW1 as destroyer tender AD-6
* &quot;Prairie&quot; (1890), ex-&quot;El Sol&quot; – Spanish–American War, United States occupation of Veracruz, later WW1 as destroyer tender AD-5
* &quot;Buffalo&quot; (1892), ex-&quot;El Cid&quot;, later WW1 as destroyer tender AD-8
* &quot;Yankee&quot; (1892), ex-&quot;El Norte&quot; – Spanish–American War, sank 4 December 1908 after grounding
* &quot;Yosemite&quot; (1892), ex-&quot;El Sud&quot; – Spanish–American War, scuttled on or after 15 November 1900 after typhoon damage
* &quot;Dixie&quot; (1893), ex-&quot;El Rio&quot; – Spanish–American War, later WW1 as destroyer tender, later AD-1

===German war prize===
* &quot;Frankfurt&quot; (1915), sunk as target 1921

==Armored cruisers (ACR)==

Officially these ships were e.g., &quot;Armored Cruiser No. 1&quot;. Unofficially, top naval officers initially referred to these ships as battleships because they cost almost as much, shared many features with them, and were intended to accompany them in fleet actions; they took care to ensure that Congress never heard their opinion. The 1905 Russo-Japanese War showed armored cruisers did not perform as well as either battleships or as other cruiser types. As battleship technology advanced they were judged obsolete for their original role about the time the last U.S. armored cruiser was commissioned (this advance in part led to the development of battlecruisers as a replacement), and so they were retained for other cruiser roles despite their deficiencies. During 1912–1920 the U.S. armored cruisers had their names changed from states to cities within those states to free up the names for battleships.
* (ACR-1) &quot;Maine&quot; (1895), later classed as a second class battleship, sunk by explosion 15 February 1898, 286 killed
* (ACR-2) &quot;New York&quot; (1893) – Spanish–American War, later &quot;Saratoga&quot;, WW1 as &quot;Rochester&quot;, later CA-2

* (ACR-5) &quot;West Virginia&quot; (1905), later &quot;Huntington&quot; – WW1, later CA-5
* (ACR-6) &quot;California&quot; (1907), later &quot;San Diego&quot; – WW1, sunk by mine 19 July 1918, 6 killed
* (ACR-7) &quot;Colorado&quot; (1905), later &quot;Pueblo&quot; – WW1, later CA-7

In the pre-1920 period abbreviations were informal and not standardized; officially these ships were, e.g., &quot;Cruiser No. 1&quot;. Only the &quot;Montgomery&quot; class were unprotected cruisers, all the rest were protected cruisers. The Navy often referred to unprotected cruisers and obsolete protected cruisers (and some large gunboats without cruiser features) as &quot;peace cruisers&quot; due to their use in major policing and diplomatic roles.

* (PG-51) &quot;Charleston&quot; (1936) – WW2: 1 battle star

==Cruiser minelayers (CM)==

In 1919 two cruisers were reclassified as Cruiser Minelayers (CM); they had participated in the laying of the North Sea mine barrage during WW1. Other large minelayers with no cruiser features or history were later given the &#x27;CM&#x27; hull symbol, and the &#x27;cruiser&#x27; nomenclature was dropped. 

* (CM-1) &quot;Baltimore&quot;, ex-C-3
* (CM-2) &quot;San Francisco&quot;, ex-C-5

==Scout cruisers (SCR, SC, CS)==

The use of fast armed merchant cruisers in the Spanish–American War and the fleet exercises of 1902-03 convinced the Navy that it needed fast scout cruisers. The &quot;Chester&quot; class was built in part to test high speed propulsion plants. The &quot;Omaha&quot; class would become the oldest U.S. cruisers to serve in World War II. Officially these ships were, e.g., &quot;Scout Cruiser No. 1&quot;, and sometimes abbreviated SC or SCR; on 8 August 1921 all would be reclassed as light cruisers.

==Battlecruisers (CC)==

The United States laid down its only six battlecruisers as part of the 1917 construction program; in accordance with the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty four were scrapped incomplete and two converted during construction into the s.

In the 1920 hull designation system, of the Third Class Cruisers the fast Scout Cruisers became Light Cruisers (CL), and the slower &quot;New Orleans&quot; and &quot;Denver&quot;-class &quot;peace cruisers&quot; were reclassified as Patrol Gunboats (PG).

On 8 August 1921 the system was revised; the surviving protected cruisers (except for the &quot;semi-armored&quot; &quot;St Louis&quot; class) and the peace cruiser/patrol gunboats were all grouped with the scout cruisers as Light Cruisers (CL).

The CA/CL overlap of hull numbers would persist until the last armored cruiser of the original CA series, &quot;Seattle&quot;, was reclassed as IX-39 on 17 February 1941.

=== Washington Naval Treaty ===


The first cruisers of the &quot;Pensacola&quot;, &quot;Northampton&quot;, &quot;New Orleans&quot;, and &quot;Portland&quot; classes – which were designed after the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, so quickly that the last design was complete before sea trial of the first were finished – were originally designated Light Cruisers (CL) due to their light protection. Later, in accordance with the 1930 London Naval Treaty, they were reclassified as &quot;Heavy Cruisers&quot; (CA) in 1931 due to their guns. &quot;Thenceforward new heavy and light cruisers were numbered in a single sequence.&quot; These four classes were known as &quot;Treaty cruisers&quot; and &quot;Tinclads&quot; and were seen even before World War II as deficient by the Navy due to the treaty limitations, but despite their high losses in the early days of the war they performed well.
* (CL/CA-24) &quot;Pensacola&quot; (1930) – WW2: 13 battle stars
* (CL/CA-25) &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; (1929) – WW2: 11 battle stars
:Both ships of the &quot;Pensacola&quot; class would be Operation Crossroads nuclear test targets in 1946.
* (CL/CA-26) &quot;Northampton&quot; (1930) – WW2: 6 battle stars, sunk by torpedoes 1 December 1942, 50 killed
* (CL/CA-27) &quot;Chester&quot; (1930) – WW2: 11 battle stars
* (CL/CA-28) &quot;Louisville&quot; (1931) – WW2: 13 battle stars
* (CL/CA-29) &quot;Chicago&quot; (1931) – WW2: 3 battle stars, sunk by air attack 30 January 1943, 62 killed
* (CL/CA-30) &quot;Houston&quot; (1930) – WW2: 2 battle stars, sunk by torpedoes 1 March 1942, 693 killed and 77 POWs died
* (CL/CA-31) &quot;Augusta&quot; (1931) – WW2: 3 battle stars
* (CL/CA-32) &quot;New Orleans&quot; (1934) – WW2: 17 battle stars
* (CL/CA-33) &quot;Portland&quot; (1933) – WW2: 16 battle stars

* (CA-39) &quot;Quincy&quot; (1936) – WW2: 1 battle star, sunk by gunfire and torpedoes 9 August 1942, 370 killed

=== London Naval Treaty ===
The terms of the 1930 London Naval Treaty motivated the signatories to de-emphasize heavy cruiser construction in favor of light cruisers. The resultant nine ship &quot;Brooklyn&quot;-class of light cruisers had a strong influence on US cruiser design. Nearly all subsequent US cruisers, heavy and light, were directly or indirectly based on them, including the unique heavy cruiser &quot;Wichita&quot;.

* (CL-40) &quot;Brooklyn&quot; (1937) – WW2: 4 battle stars, later Chilean &quot;O&#x27;Higgins&quot;
* (CL-41) &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (1937) – WW2: 5 battle stars, later Brazilian &quot;Barroso&quot;
* (CL-42) &quot;Savannah&quot; (1938) – WW2: 3 battle stars
* (CL-43) &quot;Nashville&quot; (1938) – WW2: 10 battle stars, later Chilean &quot;Capitan Prat &quot;

&quot;New Orleans&quot; class
* (CA-44) &quot;Vincennes&quot; (1937) – WW2: 2 battle stars, sunk by gunfire and torpedoes 9 August 1942, 332 killed

* (CL-48) &quot;Honolulu&quot; (1938) – WW2: 8 battle stars

&quot;Brooklyn&quot; class (&quot;St. Louis&quot; subclass)

* (CL-50) &quot;Helena&quot; (1939) – WW2: 7 battle stars, war loss 6 July 1943, 168 killed

=== Second London Naval Treaty ===

The 1936 Second London Naval Treaty would also influence the Navy&#x27;s light cruiser program. It imposed limits that resulted in the smaller displacement &quot;Atlanta&quot; class with a dual purpose rapid fire main gun battery, the first such ship in the Navy.
* (CL-51) &quot;Atlanta&quot; (1941) – WW2: 5 battle stars, scuttled after torpedo damage 13 November 1942
* (CL-52) &quot;Juneau&quot; (1942) – WW2: 4 battle stars, sunk by torpedoes 13 November 1942, 687 killed
* (CL-53) &quot;San Diego&quot; (1942) – WW2: 18 battle stars
* (CL-54) &quot;San Juan&quot; (1942) – WW2: 13 battle stars

====Cruiser-Destroyer (CLD)====
Parallel to the &quot;Atlanta&quot; design was an abortive attempt to design a super-&quot;Atlanta&quot; known as the Cruiser-Destroyer, or CLD. The &quot;ship characteristics&quot; resulting from this study would be almost identical to that of the later CL-154 design. CLD did not become an official hull classification symbol.

=== Early World War II ===
When the United States entered World War II it had three major classes of cruisers under construction: the &quot;Atlanta&quot; and &quot;Cleveland&quot; light cruiser classes (with 5-inch and 6-inch main batteries, respectively), and the &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class of heavy cruisers. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class was an improvement of the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; design, while the &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class was an improved &quot;Wichita&quot;. These ships would form the bulk of the cruiser war construction effort, with eight &quot;Atlanta&quot;-class, twenty-seven &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class, and fourteen &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class cruisers ultimately completed. Early in the war nine &quot;Cleveland&quot; hulls would be diverted for conversion into light aircraft carriers (CVLs). By the end of the war three &quot;Cleveland&quot; hulls would be canceled, and one incomplete hull would later be converted to a guided missile cruiser.

=== Late World War II ===
As the Navy gained experience with World War II combat conditions, it was decided that the &quot;Atlanta&quot;, &quot;Cleveland&quot;, and &quot;Baltimore&quot; classes needed improvement. However, major improvements would cause unacceptable delays in the construction programs. A new generation of cruisers with minor improvements would consist of the &quot;Juneau&quot; and &quot;Fargo&quot; classes of light cruisers (respectively 5-inch and 6-inch main batteries), and the &quot;Oregon City&quot;-class of heavy cruisers. The major noticeable difference would be that the &quot;Fargo&quot; and the &quot;Oregon City&quot; classes would have their engine exhausts trunked into a single funnel to aid anti-aircraft fire. Due to the near-total destruction of the Imperial Japanese Navy, the number of the ships of this generation to be completed as gun cruisers would be small: three &quot;Juneau&quot;-class, two &quot;Fargo&quot;-class, and three &quot;Oregon City&quot;-class cruisers. A fourth &quot;Oregon City&quot;-class cruiser would be completed postwar as a command cruiser. Seventeen hulls from among the three classes were canceled.

Late in the war the &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class would also serve as the basis of the two light aircraft carriers (CVLs).

=== Post-World War II ===
The Navy agreed in the waning days of the war to construct a small number of cruisers for the purpose of operationally testing new gun designs and other major improvements incorporating the lessons learned of World War II combat: the &#x27;CL-154&#x27; and &quot;Worcester&quot; classes of light cruisers (respectively 5-inch and 6-inch main batteries), and the &quot;Des Moines&quot;-class of heavy cruisers. Initially the Navy wanted at least one squadron of six ships of each class, but in the end only two &quot;Worcester&quot;-class and three &quot;Des Moines&quot;-class cruisers would be completed, and the CL-154 class would be cancelled in its entirety. A total of seventeen hulls from among the three planned classes would be canceled.


* (CA-134) &quot;Des Moines&quot; (1948)

&quot;Baltimore&quot; class
* (CA-135) &quot;Los Angeles&quot; (1945) – WW2: 1 battle star, Korea: 5 stars
* (CA-136) &quot;Chicago&quot; (1945) – WW2: 1 battle star, later converted to CG-11

&quot;Oregon City&quot; class
* (CA-137) &quot;Norfolk&quot; – canceled after construction started
* (CA-138) &quot;Scranton&quot; – canceled after construction started

&quot;Des Moines&quot; class
* (CA-139) &quot;Salem&quot; (1949), museum ship
* (CA-140) &quot;Dallas&quot; – canceled after construction started
* CA-141 to 143 – canceled unnamed
* (CL-144) &quot;Worcester&quot; (1948) – Korea: 2 battle stars
* (CL-145) &quot;Roanoke&quot; (1949)
* (CL-146) &quot;Vallejo&quot; – canceled after construction started
* (CL-147) &quot;Gary&quot; – canceled after construction started

&quot;Des Moines&quot; class
* (CA-148) &quot;Newport News&quot; (1949) – Vietnam: 3 battle stars
* (CA-149) – canceled unnamed
* (CA-150) &quot;Dallas&quot; – canceled
* CA-151 to 153 – canceled unnamed

CL-154 class
* CL-154 to 159 – canceled unnamed

The last ship to be assigned a hull number in the Heavy and Light Cruiser sequence would be the 1950s era nuclear powered &quot;Long Beach&quot;, though this ship would be assigned another number and designation under the guided missile cruiser hull classification before launch.

&quot;Long Beach&quot; class
* (CLGN/CGN-160) &quot;Long Beach&quot;, completed as CGN-9 (1961)

==Large cruisers (CB)==

The motivation for the large cruiser concept came from the deployment of Germany&#x27;s so-called pocket battleships in the early 1930s, and from concerns that Japan would follow with similar ships. These large cruisers had design features intermediate between heavy cruisers and battleships (such as the unique and highly effective 12-inch/50-caliber Mark 8 guns); this was unlike the designs of the earlier battlecruisers, the ultimate design of which had the same 16-inch guns as battleships but less armor and more speed. Despite these differences large cruisers and battlecruisers were intended to serve much the same role.
* (CB-1) &quot;Alaska&quot; (1944) – WW2: 3 battle stars
* (CB-2) &quot;Guam&quot; (1944) – WW2: 2 battle stars
* (CB-3) &quot;Hawaii&quot; – construction stopped after launching, conversion to a missile ship (CBG-3) and then a command ship (CBC-1) canceled
* (CB-4) &quot;Philippines&quot; – canceled
* (CB-5) &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; – canceled
* (CB-6) &quot;Samoa&quot; – canceled

==German cruiser war prize (IX)==

*(IX-300) &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, 1940 Germany heavy cruiser, entered USN service in 1945 as an unclassified miscellaneous vessel (IX) after award as a war prize and was expended in nuclear testing in 1946 following engine sabotage by her German POW crew.

==Hunter-Killer cruisers (CLK)==
 CLK-1 was authorized in 1947 as an anti-submarine hunter killer. She was designed on a light cruiser hull so she could carry a greater variety of detection gear than a destroyer. CLK-2 was cancelled due to the high cost ($61.9 million) of CLK-1.
* (CLK-1) &quot;Norfolk&quot;, reclassified as Destroyer Leader DL-1 prior to launch
* (CLK-2) &quot;New Haven&quot;, canceled

==Antiaircraft cruisers (CLAA)==
 On 18 March 1949, the surviving light cruisers of the &quot;Atlanta&quot; and &quot;Juneau&quot; classes were redesignated as antiaircraft cruisers (CLAA) without changing their hull numbers; &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;San Juan&quot;, and &quot;Flint&quot; were redesignated even though they had been decommissioned and were in reserve. The CL-154 class would also have received this designation had they not been canceled.
&quot;Atlanta&quot; class
* (CLAA-53) &quot;San Diego&quot;
* (CLAA-54) &quot;San Juan&quot;

&quot;Atlanta&quot; class (&quot;Oakland&quot; subclass)
* (CLAA-95) &quot;Oakland&quot;
* (CLAA-96) &quot;Reno&quot;
* (CLAA-97) &quot;Flint&quot;
* (CLAA-98) &quot;Tucson&quot;

&quot;Juneau&quot; class
* (CLAA-119) &quot;Juneau&quot; – Korea: 5 battle stars
* (CLAA-120) &quot;Spokane&quot;, later AG-191
* (CLAA-121) &quot;Fresno&quot;

==Command cruisers (CLC, CC)==

By the end of World War II the Navy had gained favorable experience with dedicated amphibious command ships, and desired similar but faster ships to accompany aircraft carriers for fleet command, which would also relieve overcrowded fleet command facilities on other ships. Both completed conversions, &quot;Northampton&quot; and &quot;Wright&quot;, were indirectly based on the &quot;Baltimore&quot; class heavy cruiser design (the first via the &quot;Oregon City&quot; class, the second via the &quot;Saipan&quot; class). The result would be the highly capable but expensive command cruisers. These ships would be absorbed into the National Emergency Command Post Afloat mission, and then retired when that role was cancelled.
* (CLC/CC-1) &quot;Northampton&quot; (ex-CA-125) (1953)
* (CBC-1) &quot;Hawaii&quot; (ex-CB-3, ex-CBG-3) – conversion canceled
* (CC-2) &quot;Wright&quot; (ex-CVL-49, ex-AVT-7) (1963)
* (CC-3) &quot;Saipan&quot; (ex-CVL-48, ex-AVT-6), - conversion canceled, later AGMR-2 as &quot;Arlington&quot;

==Guided missile cruisers (CAG, CLG, CG)==
===&#x27;Cruiser hulls&#x27;===

With the exception of the purpose-built nuclear powered guided missile cruiser &quot;Long Beach&quot;, all of the early guided missile cruisers were converted heavy or light cruisers from the World War II era. The early conversions were heavy (CAG) and light (CLG) &#x27;single-enders&#x27; which placed the missile facilities aft and conservatively retained their forward main gun batteries; the later conversions (CG) were &#x27;double-enders&#x27; which eliminated the main guns. In 1975 the surviving &#x27;single enders&#x27; would be reclassified as CG even though they retained their guns.

&quot;Alaska&quot; class
* (CBG-3) &quot;Hawaii&quot; (ex-CB-3) – conversion canceled
* (CAG-1) &quot;Boston&quot; (ex- and later CA-69, 1955) – Vietnam: 5 battle stars
* (CAG-2) &quot;Canberra&quot; (ex- and later CA-70, 1956) – Vietnam: 4 battle stars

* (CLG/CG-6) &quot;Providence&quot; (ex-CL-82, 1959) – Vietnam: 6 battle stars
* (CLG/CG-7) &quot;Springfield&quot; (ex-CL-66, 1960)
* (CLG-8) &quot;Topeka&quot; (ex-CL-67, 1960) – Vietnam: 3 battle stars

&quot;Long Beach&quot; class
* (CGN-9) &quot;Long Beach&quot; (ex-CLGN-160, 1961) – Vietnam: 7 battle stars
* (CG-10) &quot;Albany&quot; (ex-CA-123, 1962)
* (CG-11) &quot;Chicago&quot; (ex-CA-136, 1964) – Vietnam: 11 battle stars
* (CG-12) &quot;Columbus&quot; (ex-CA-74, 1962)
* (CG-13) &quot;Rochester&quot; (ex-CA-124) – conversion canceled
* (CG-14) &quot;Bremerton&quot; (ex-CA-130)– conversion canceled

CSGN class

:The CSGN class, a proposed nuclear-powered Aegis strike cruiser, canceled unnamed and unnumbered; this was the sole proposal since 1961 to use &#x27;cruiser hull&#x27; standards in a ship designated &#x27;cruiser&#x27;.

===&#x27;Destroyer hulls&#x27;===
Following the conversion of the &quot;Albany&quot; class, all guided missile cruisers would be built on &#x27;destroyer hulls&#x27;; the pre-1975 ships were originally classified as destroyers (DDG) or as destroyer leaders (DLG) and termed &#x27;frigates&#x27; before reclassification as cruisers.

<text>The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a large breed of dog belonging to the retriever, gundog, and sporting breed groups. The breed was developed in the United States Chesapeake Bay area during the 19th century. Historically used by local market hunters to retrieve waterfowl, pull fishing nets, and rescue fishermen, it is today primarily a family pet and hunting companion, known for a bright and happy disposition; courage; willingness to work; alertness; intelligence; love of water; and hunting capabilities. The Chesapeake is a medium- to large-sized dog similar in appearance to the Labrador Retriever, but with a wavy coat.

==Appearance==
Distinctive features include eyes that are very clear, of yellowish or amber hue, hindquarters as high or a trifle higher than the shoulders, and a double-coat that tends to wave on shoulders, neck, back, and loins. The waterproof coat feels slightly oily and is often associated with a slight musky odor. Three basic colors are generally seen in the breed: brown, which includes all shades from a light to a deep dark brown; sedge, which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; and deadgrass in all its shades, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. The breed standard states that white may also appear but it must be limited to the breast, belly, toes, or back of the feet. The head is round and broad with a medium stop and muzzle. The lips are thin, and the ears are small and of medium leather. The forelegs should be straight with good bone. The hindquarters are especially strong and the toes webbed since excellent swimming ability is important for the Chesapeake. This breed is also known for its large and powerful chest, used to break apart ice when diving into cold water while duck hunting.

===Coat===
The coat of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever is given the most consideration of any trait listed on the Positive Scale of Points in the Breed Standard. However the AKC Standard also reads &quot;The question of coat and general type of balance takes precedence over any scoring table which could be drawn up. The Chesapeake should be well proportioned, an animal with a good coat and well balanced in other points being preferable to one excelling in some but weak in others.&quot; The hair on the face and legs should be very short and straight with a tendency to wave, never curl, on the shoulders, neck, back, and loins only and nowhere over long. Moderate feathering on the rear of the hindquarters and tail is permissible although not longer than long. The texture of the thick double-coat is important in protecting the dog from cold water and icy conditions. The oil in the harsh outer coat and woolly undercoat resists water, keeping the dog dry and warm. Maintenance of the coat is minimal and mainly consists of brushing with a short-tooth brush once a week. It is difficult to get a Chesapeake Bay Retriever thoroughly wet, but they should be bathed every 3–4 months using a suitably mild shampoo, then dried thoroughly. Brushing or bathing more often can ruin the texture since it strips the protective oil from the coat and may even remove the undercoat. The color of the coat must be similar to the working surroundings. Any color of brown, sedge, or deadgrass is acceptable and one color is not preferred over another. The American Chesapeake Club includes a discussion on color:

A white spot on the breast (not extending above the sternum), belly, toes, or back of the feet is permissible, but the smaller the spot the better. White beyond these areas and black anywhere on the body is not allowed in the breed standard.

==Temperament==
The quintessential Chesapeake Bay Retriever has a bright and happy disposition, intelligence, quiet good sense, and an affectionate protective nature. Some can be quite vocal when happy, and some will &quot;smile&quot; by baring their front teeth in a peculiar grin; this is not a threat, but a sign of joy or submissiveness.

Chesapeake Bay Retrievers can make excellent family dogs when socialized properly. Some Chesapeakes are assertive and willful and may be reserved with strangers, but others are passive and outgoing with people.

===Training===
The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a versatile breed competing in field trials, hunt tests, conformation, obedience, agility, and tracking, yet remains true to its roots as a hunting dog of great stamina and ability. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is an intelligent breed and learns at a high speed. Historically considered stubborn and difficult to train, many trainers thought this breed required more physical discipline than other retriever breeds. Some trainers now recommend that the Chesapeake Bay Retriever owner use consistent, daily obedience training with play time before and after to keep the dog wanting to work with little or no physical discipline required.

==Health==
The breed is subject to a number of hereditary diseases. These include, but are not limited to:

*Exercise-induced collapse
*Hip dysplasia
*Progressive retinal atrophy
*Type 3 von Willebrand disease
*Cataract
*Regional Alopecia in both sexes

A UK Kennel Club survey puts the median lifespan of the breed at 10.75 years (average 9.85). A US breed club survey puts the average lifespan at 9.4 years. One in four lived to 13 years or more, while one in five did not live past 5 years.

The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is one of the breeds more commonly affected by degenerative myelopathy.

==History==

Chesapeake Bay Retrievers trace their history to two pups who were rescued from a foundering ship in Maryland in 1807. The male &quot;Sailor&quot; and female &quot;Canton&quot; were described as Newfoundland dogs, but were more accurately Lesser Newfoundland or St. John&#x27;s water dogs. These two lived in different parts of the bay area and there is no record of a litter being produced together. They were bred with area dogs, with more consideration given to ability than to breed, to create the beginnings of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever breed. There are few records of the breeds of these early dogs, but spaniels and hounds were included. Dogs from both Chesapeake Bay shores were recognized as one of three types of Chesapeake Bay Ducking Dog in 1877. In 1918 a single type, called the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, was recognized by the American Kennel Club, and there have been few changes to the breed standard since then.

George Law, who rescued the pups, wrote this account in 1845 which appears on the website of the American Chesapeake Bay Retriever Club:

:In the fall of 1807 I was on board of the ship &quot;Canton&quot;, belonging to my uncle, the late Hugh Thompson, of Baltimore, when we fell in, at sea, near the termination of a very heavy equinoctial gale, with an English brig in a sinking condition, and took off the crew. The brig was loaded with codfish, and was bound to Pole, in England, from Newfoundland. I boarded her, in command of a boat from the Canton, which was sent to take off the English crew, the brig&#x27;s own boats having been all swept away, and her crew in a state of intoxication. I found onboard of her two Newfoundland pups, male and female, which I saved, and subsequently, on our landing the English crew at Norfolk, our own destination being Baltimore, I purchased these two pups of the English captain for a guinea apiece. Being bound again to sea, I gave the dog pup, which was called Sailor, to Mr. John Mercer, of West River; and the slut pup, which was called Canton, to Doctor James Stewart, of Sparrow&#x27;s Point. The history which the English captain gave me of these pups was, that the owner of his brig was extensively engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and had directed his correspondent to select and send him a pair of pups of the most approved Newfoundland breed, but of different families, and that the pair I purchased of him were selected under this order. The dog was of a dingy red colour; and the slut black. They were not large; their hair was short, but very thick-coated; they had dew claws. Both attained great reputation as water-dogs. They were most sagacious in every thing, particularly so in all duties connected with duck-shooting. Governor Lloyd exchanged a Merino ram for the dog, at the time of the Merino fever, when such rams were selling for many hundred dollars, and took him over to his estate on the eastern shore of Maryland, where his progeny were well known for many years after; and may still be known there, and on the western shore, as the Sailor breed. The slut remained at Sparrows Point till her death, and her progeny were and are still well known, through Patapsco Neck, on the Gunpowder, and up the bay, amongst the duck-shooters, as unsurpassed for their purposes. I have heard both Doctor Stewart and Mr. Mercer relate most extraordinary instances of the sagacity and performance of both dog and slut, and would refer you to their friends for such particulars as I am unable, at this distance of time, to recollect with sufficient accuracy to repeat.

Mercer is said to have described Sailor:

:... he was of fine size and figure-lofty in his carriage, and built for strength and activity; remarkably muscular and broad across the hips and breast; head large, but not out of proportion; muzzle rather longer than is common with that race of dogs; his colour a dingy red, with some white on the face and breast; his coat short and smooth, but uncommonly thick, and more like a coarse fur than hair; tail full, with long hair, and always carried very high. His eyes were very peculiar: they were so light as to have almost an unnatural appearance, something resembling what is termed a wail eye, in a horse; and it is remarkable, that in a visit which I made to the Eastern Shore, nearly twenty years after he was sent there, in a sloop which had been sent expressly for him, to West River, by Governor Lloyd, I saw many of his descendants who were marked with this peculiarity.

In 1964, it was declared the official dog of Maryland. It is the mascot of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

Members of the breed were owned by General George Armstrong Custer, President Theodore Roosevelt, Senator John McCain, and actors Paul Walker and Tom Felton.

<text>Sarit Thanarat ( ; alternatively transcribed as &quot;Dhanarajata&quot;; 16 June 1908 – 8 December 1963) was a Thai politician and military commander. He served as commander-in-chief of the Royal Thai Army (from 1954) and as Minister of Defense during Plaek Phibunsongkhram&#x27;s premiership. In 1957, he became chief of a military junta after leading a coup in which Phibun was overthrown. Sarit lasted the de facto prime minister only five days before was replaced by Pote Sarasin, but assumed power again as the head of the Revolutionary Council after 1958 coup and then as the eleventh Prime Minister of Thailand in February 1959 until he died in 1963.

Born in Phra Nakhon province (now Bangkok) and raised in Mukdahan, Sarit graduated from the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy in 1928 and began his military career as a second lieutenant in the 2nd Infantry Division. He first gained recognition during the Boworadet Rebellion, where he commanded government forces under Plaek Phibunsongkhram. During World War II, he participated in the Burma campaign, leading forces in the invasion of the Shan State under General Phin Choonhavan. Known for his strict discipline and effective leadership, Sarit quickly rose through the ranks and established himself as a prominent figure within the military after the war.

After the 1947 coup d&#x27;état, Sarit became a key political figure in Phibun&#x27;s government and played an active role in suppressing the Palace Rebellion of 1949. By the 1950s, Sarit emerged as a central figure in the &quot;Triumvirate&quot; alongside Phao Siyanon and Phibun, as they competed for dominance in Thai politics. Sarit&#x27;s influence grew significantly after the February 1957 election crisis, during which he led a coup that ousted Phibun and temporarily assumed leadership as the head of the Revolutionary Council. Although he initially restored power to civilian authorities, Sarit launched another coup in 1958, consolidating power and officially becoming Prime Minister.

As Prime Minister, Sarit established a highly centralized and authoritarian government. He suspended the constitution, dissolved parliament, and banned political parties, consolidating all power in his hands. Sarit emphasized modernization and economic development, focusing on Infrastructure, agriculture, and industrialization. His government received substantial support from the United States, as it aligned itself with the anti-communist bloc during the Cold War. Domestically, Sarit promoted a strong sense of Thai nationalism and emphasized the importance of the monarchy, which became central to his administration&#x27;s legitimacy. 

Sarit’s legacy remains significant and controversial. He is credited with stabilizing Thailand during a period of turbulence and implementing policies that fostered economic growth and modernization. However, his regime was also characterized by authoritarianism, corruption, and political repression. Sarit’s efforts to elevate the monarchy&#x27;s role in politics have had a lasting impact on Thailand’s political structure and influencing subsequent military-led government.

==Military career==
Sarit Thanarat was educated at a monastery school, and entered Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy in 1919, not completing his military studies until 1928, after which he was commissioned as a second lieutenant. During World War II he served as commander of an infantry battalion and took part in the invasion and occupation of the Shan States in Burma. Unlike many of his fellow officers, Sarit was not discharged at the end of the war. Instead, he was promoted to command the 1st Infantry Regiment of the Bangkok-based Guards Division. As a colonel, he played a leading role in the 1947 military coup that overthrew the government of Prime Minister Thawal Thamrong Navaswadhi, a protege of Pridi Phanomyong, reinstalling the previously deposed Field Marshal Luang Phibunsongkram as premier. Sarit thereafter took a lasting interest in politics. He became Commander of the Royal Thai Army in 1954.

==Events leading to the coup==
During the early-1950s, the Phibun government grew increasingly unpopular. This paved the way for the rise of Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat.

=== Elections of 26 February 1957 ===
The passing of the 1955 Political Party Bill led to the proliferation of more than twenty-five political parties. The government&#x27;s Legislative Committee was revamped into the Seri Manangkhasila Party which was headed by Phibun with Sarit as deputy chief and Phao as secretary-general. Sarit did not play a significant role in the election process and generally left Phao in charge.

Although the Seri Manangkhasila Party beat the Democrat Party, the latter was seen to have won a moral victory. The Democrat Party and the press accused the government of rigging the vote and using hooligans to terrorize both candidates and voters. In a bid to repress public discontent, Phibun declared a state of emergency and Sarit was appointed as the supreme commander of military forces. However, Sarit effectively disassociated himself from the corrupt party when he commented that the 1957 elections. &quot;were dirty, the dirtiest. Everybody cheated.&quot;

=== The Isan crisis ===
In 1957, one of Isan&#x27;s worst droughts occurred. It prompted a mass exodus of people from the northeast to Bangkok, which led to social problems. The government seemed to regard this diaspora as natural and said that it could neutralize peasant discontent. The Minister of Agriculture, Field Marshal Phin Choonhavan, said that northeasterner&#x27;s migration to the city and their consumption of frogs and lizards was normal and that there was nothing to worry about. At Hua Lamphong railway station in Bangkok, there were so many refugees arriving daily that students and monks had to set up emergency help stations.

On 10 August, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Phin, was sent by helicopter to survey the Isan region where he found nothing amiss. A second survey, also done by air, was published and again indicated that there was no crisis in Isan as all the land was in acceptable condition. In a final attempt to resolve the issue, the Phibun government allocated 53 million baht, which was to be divided equally among the 53 Isan representatives.

=== The lumber swindle ===
Before the government could recover from its inept management of the Isan crisis, its integrity was once again questioned. Thailand was loaned US$66 million for the Bhumibol Dam, a dam 154 meters high on the Ping River in Tak. The project was to take six years and had to pay for itself after completion. Many MPs were against the loan as it came immediately after the Isan famine. Out of respect for the king, the plan for the dam was not rejected. Things further escalated when Thiem Khomrit, Director-General of the Forestry Department, was forced to resign and was charged with administrative incompetence.

Enraged by the charges, Thiem went to the press to reveal the real reason for his dismissal. He stated that several powerful figures in the Thai government wanted to establish the Forestry Company of Thailand which would merge with other private companies and thereby control the lumber and teak industries. Phin, who headed this project, wanted to suspend all forestry licenses when other companies refused to collude. The plan to establish the Forestry Company of Thailand involved the Bhumibhol Dam project, as members of the Forestry Company wanted to monopolize the cutting of timber in the areas to be flooded by the dam. Thiem further revealed that the Seri Manangkhasila Party had submitted an early application for a license to cut down trees in the area. According to Thiem, his refusal to approve the government&#x27;s application was the cause of his dismissal.

== The coup ==

On 13 September 1957, Sarit handed Phibun the army&#x27;s ultimatum. The ultimatum, signed by 58 army officers, called for the resignation of the government. The public supported Sarit&#x27;s ultimatum.

On 16 September, a public gathering assembled to protest Phibun and his government. The crowd, which quickly grew in numbers, marched to Sarit&#x27;s residence to show support for the army&#x27;s demands. As Sarit was not at home, the crowd broke into the government compound where they made speeches condemning the government. The protesters later returned to Sarit&#x27;s home where he was waiting to address them. In his speech, Sarit said, &quot;In the name of the army and deputies of the second category, I have conducted my activities based on popular will, and the interests of the people — your coming here gives me moral support to continue.&quot;

The following morning, Sarit and his army staged a &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot;. In less than an hour, the army successfully captured strategic points with no resistance. To identify themselves, Sarit&#x27;s forces wore white arm bands as a sign of purity. Following these developments, Phibun immediately fled the country and Phao was deported to Europe. Thus began Sarit&#x27;s rule.

== Influences on Sarit&#x27;s rule ==
According to many Western academics, the Cold War largely propped up Sarit&#x27;s regime. In his book, Daniel Fineman states that Phibun, and later Sarit, aligned their foreign policies with US anti-communist foreign policy, so as to receive financial and military aid. Sarit&#x27;s strict stance against communism further reinforced the US belief that only the Thai military could contain the communist threat.

In contrast, Likhit Dhiravegin stresses that the notion of &quot;phokho&quot; (patriarchal rule) from the Sukhothai Kingdom and &quot;devaraja&quot; (god–king) and &quot;sakdina&quot; (dignity marks) from the Ayutthaya Kingdom are essential in understanding modern Thai politics. Likhit&#x27;s analysis shows how Sarit combined paternalistic rule from the Sukothai (&quot;phokhun&quot;) with Ayuthaya&#x27;s despotic power to create his personal political style. According to Thak, Luang Wichit Wathakan was essential in moulding the leadership principles of Phibun and Sarit. From him, Sarit was introduced to the idea of &quot;pattiwat&quot; (revolution) and the guiding leadership principle of &quot;phokhun&quot;.

== Sarit&#x27;s tenure ==

=== Paternalism ===
Within days of the coup, electricity rates were lowered and families living in the water-scarce Bangkok-Thonburi area were given 300 large buckets of water free every month. To help the needy, the Revolutionary Council ordered the municipal government to abolish certain taxes, charges for official service, and license fees. Hospitals were ordered to give out free medicine and healthcare to the poor, while student nurses and social workers were instructed to make house calls to help with child delivery and health problems.

To lower food prices, Sarit ordered the opening of new markets modeled after the Sunday flea markets at Sanam Luang. Merchants could sell their goods directly to the public instead of going through , thus reducing food prices. Participating merchants only had to pay nominal fee. Sarit also lowered the price of iced black coffee, a popular beverage among locals, from 70 satang per glass to 50 satang per glass. (To evade this, merchants served the coffee in smaller glasses, added less coffee, or more ice into the beverage. Thais were then forced to order the &quot;special&quot; coffee which was the original coffee at the original price).

The Association of Rice Merchants agreed to lower their rice prices in the stores they controlled. In a bid to show that everyone was participating in the revolution, the navy was called on by Sarit to provide cheap coconuts to be sold to the public.

Even though many of these programs did not last long or were not implemented, their announcements helped to create an atmosphere of enthusiasm for the new government.

=== Dealing with deviants ===
Soon after the coup, Sarit ordered the arrest and reformation of hooligans (&quot;anthaphan&quot;). According to the Revolutionary Council&#x27;s Proclamation No. 21, &quot;anthaphan&quot; were the bane of the society and to maintain common people&#x27;s happiness, there was a need to get rid of them. Those with long hair, flashy clothing, and tight pants, in fashion at the time, were also targeted. Weekly dances at Lumpini Garden were banned, and rock and roll music was prohibited from government parties. Upon the release of the victims, Sarit said that he did not hate them, but his actions were necessary for the &quot;family&quot;.

Prostitution was also considered as a menace to society. Sarit ordered all arrested prostitutes be reformed by sending them to institutions which would equip them with new skills. He also passed the Law Against Prostitution, B.E. 2503.

=== Getting rid of opium ===
Sarit was determined to end the consumption and sale of opium in Thailand for several reasons. First, he wanted to illustrate to the people that he did not intend to gain from the opium trade, unlike his predecessor Phao. Second, he wanted to please the Western powers who believed that the drug was used by communists to undermine the morals and economy of democratic countries. Last, he saw the eradication of opium as part of his mission to uplift the country morally. Consequently, 43,445 opium pipes were destroyed, and the Committee to Combat Addictive Drugs, headed by Sarit, was created.

=== Imposing order ===
General Sarit declared that Thailand would abide by the UN&#x27;s Universal Declaration on Human Rights of 1948, to which Thailand was a signatory, except in cases when it did not.

Article 17 of the Interim Constitution of Thailand, B.E. 2502 or &quot; M17&quot; was the legal basis for Sarit to order executions. Using M17, parliament was abolished, newspapers were strictly censored, political parties were prohibited, and people who were suspected of colluding with communists were imprisoned. From 1958 to 1963, eleven people were executed under M17. Five were given death penalty for arson, one for heroin production, one for spearheading a messianic uprising, and four on charges of communism, including the activist and former MP Khrong Chandawong. The Revolutionary Council Proclamation No. 12, dated 22 October 1958, gave investigating authorities the power to detain suspects as long as needed. Many of those persecuted were not communists, but rather writers or intellectuals who opposed Sarit&#x27;s rule. Under the proclamation, an estimated 1,000 suspects were imprisoned.

According to Frank Darling, Sarit&#x27;s regime was authoritarian and retreated from what little democracy was gained during the 1932 revolution. Thak suggests that Sarit&#x27;s strict rule can be understood as the modern &quot;phokhun&quot; style of leadership, where the benevolent leader intervenes to help his people.

==The monarchy==

Under Sarit&#x27;s rule, the monarchy was revived and brought back to centre stage. Sarit arranged for King Bhumibhol Adulyadej to attend public ceremonies, visit provinces, patronize development projects, and present diplomas to Thailand&#x27;s university graduates, helping to bring the monarchy closer to the people and raising the stature of the king to that of reverence. The practice of prostration, with the head touching the ground before royal audiences, banned decades earlier by King Chulalongkorn, was reinstated. On 5 December 1982, the Army&#x27;s 21st infantry regiment was transferred to the palace and Queen Sirikit was appointed its colonel-in-chief.

The Sarit government revived traditional festivals and ceremonies which were abandoned after the 1932 revolution. An example was the revival of the First Ploughing ceremony (Raek Nakhwan) which dates back to the Sukothai Kingdom.

According to Thak, the Sarit regime had two main reasons for reinvigorating the monarchy. First, the monarchy legitimized not only his regime, but its policies as well. Sarit&#x27;s plan to stage a coup against Phibun was supported by the monarchy as evidenced by a letter written by the king. The letter expressed the king&#x27;s confidence in Sarit and urged Sarit to do his duty to the government. Second, the monarch contributed to regime&#x27;s paternalistic programs. In this instance, the throne acted as a charity, collecting funds from private donors, channeling them into public programs that enhanced both the regime&#x27;s and the monarchy&#x27;s reputation.

After 1966, the number of public appearances by the king increased and as the years passed, more visits were made. The king&#x27;s newly powerful position was evidenced by the number of scheduled audiences with the prime minister and other cabinet ministers. The monarchy also moved closer to the military as illustrated by the number of military affairs attended by the king in 1963.

==Sarit&#x27;s death and aftermath==
Sarit died unexpectedly in late 1963 from liver failure, just as his economic measures were proving successful. There was a peaceful transfer of power to Sarit&#x27;s deputy generals: Thanom Kittikachorn, who became prime minister, and Praphas Charusathien, who became deputy prime minister. Thanom and Praphas maintained Sarit&#x27;s authoritarian style of government, his anti-communism, and his pro-US policies.

The strength of Sarit&#x27;s relationship with King Bhumibol was evident when the king ordered 21 days of official mourning in the palace after his death, with Sarit&#x27;s body lying in state under royal patronage for 100 days and the king and queen attending his cremation on 17 March 1964.

==Posthumous revelations==
After Sarit&#x27;s death, his reputation took a blow when an inheritance battle between his son, Major Setha Thanarat, and his last wife, Thanpuying Vichitra Thanarat, revealed the massive extent of Sarit&#x27;s wealth, which totaled over US$100 million. Besides sitting on the boards of 22 companies, he was discovered to have owned a trust company, a brewery, 51 cars, and 30 plots of land, most of which he gave to his dozens of mistresses. Thai language newspapers published the names of 100 women who claimed to have shared his bed, shocking the public when his corruption was uncovered.

==Royal decorations==
As usual with senior Thai military officers and politicians, Sarit received many royal decorations in the Honours System. These include:

<doc id="203754" wikidata="Q319669" url="?curid=203754" title="Rama III">
<text>Nangklao (born Thap; 31 March 1788 – 2 April 1851), also known by his regnal name Rama III, was the third king of Siam from the Chakri dynasty, ruling from 21 July 1824 to 2 April 1851.

Nangklao was the eldest surviving son of King Rama II. His mother Sri Sulalai was one of Rama II&#x27;s secondary wives. Nangklao was likely designated as heir by his father. His accession was uncontested and smoothly confirmed by the grand council. Foreign observers, however, falsely perceived him as having usurped the prior claim of his younger half-brother Prince Mongkut, who was born to Queen Sri Suriyendra and thus &quot;legitimate&quot; according to Western customs. Under the old concept of Thai monarchy, however, a proper king must emulate Maha Sammata in that he must be &quot;elected by the people.&quot; Ironically, Mongkut may have later contributed to this misconception, when he feared that his own accession might be perceived by foreign observers as a usurpation.

During Nangklao&#x27;s reign, the military hegemony of Siam was established by putting down the Laotian Rebellion (1826–1828, in what would come to be called Isan), the Siamese–Vietnamese War (1831–34), and the Siamese-Vietnamese War fought in Cambodia (1841–45).

==Early life==
King Nangklao was born as Prince Thap in 1788 to Prince Itsarasunthon and one of his royal wives Chao Chom Manda Riam, who came from a Muslim noble family from the south. Following Isarasundhorn&#x27;s coronation (posthumously known as Phutthaloetla Naphalai, or Rama II) in 1809, Prince Kshatriyanuchit (Mom Men), the surviving son of Taksin, revolted as pretender to the throne. Prince Thap was assigned to suppress the rebellion, which he did. Praised by his father for his competence, Prince Thap was given the Sanskrit-derived title Chetsadabodin, raised to the bureaucratic rank of Kromma Muen, and served his father as &quot;Kromma Tha&quot; (minister of trade and foreign affairs.) As Kromma Tha, he developed proficiency in foreign trade, and developed an affection for Chinese goods and culture. Temples he later had constructed were characterized by Chinese influence. After a private audience in 1822, Crawfurd wrote of the Prince Krom-chiat that, &quot;he seemed certainly to maintain the character assigned to him in public estimation, of being the most intelligent of all the princes and chiefs of the Siamese Court.&quot; The Portuguese Consul stated that the Prince had offered him a large sum of money, if he would translate from the French into the Portuguese language a history of the wars of Napoleon, for the purpose of being rendered into Siamese through the Christian interpreters.
==Succession==
As the prince administered trade affairs, his half-brother Prince Mongkut pursued the way of religion, becoming a monk in 1824. In that year, Phutthaloetla Naphalai died suddenly without having named a successor to viceroy Maha Senanurak, who had died 16 July 1817. According to the traditions of royal succession, the viceroy or uparaja was heir presumptive. If there were none, then an &quot;ad hoc&quot; &quot;senabodi&quot; consisting of senior officials present at the death of a king, would elect a successor. Foreign observers accustomed to the concept of an heir apparent expected Prince Mongkut, as a son of the queen, to ascend to the throne. However, the assembled Senabodi considered Prince Chetsadabodin a more competent choice as he had served the king in &quot;Kromma Tha&quot; for years. Support came strongly from high-ranking nobility, including &quot;Chao Phraya&quot; Abhay Pudhorn, the &quot;Samuha Nayok&quot;, and Dis Bunnag then Minister of &quot;Kromma Tha&quot;, and other Bunnag family members.

Chetsadabodin accepted the throne and was crowned in 1824. He raised his mother, Riam, to Princess Mother Sri Suralai. He appointed his uncle, Sakdiphonlasep, viceroy on 21 July 1824 – who predeceased the king 1 May 1832, leading to yet another succession crisis. He did not name his reign, but was posthumously awarded the name Nangklao by Mongkut, who had in the interim remained in ecclesiastic status to avoid the intrigues of royal politics.

==Western contacts==

The reign of Nangklao (as he was posthumously known) saw the renewal of Western contacts. In 1822, British East India Company agent John Crawfurd&#x27;s mission to Siam laid the groundwork for a British request for Siamese support in the First Anglo-Burmese War, which broke out in 1824. Nangklao provided fleets and elephants and sent Siamese armies to participate in the invasion of Burma since the British promised Siam the conquered lands. Phraya Chumporn ordered the forced migration of Mergui (a common practice in Southeast Asia regarding the newly-conquered lands), which had been conquered by the British. The British were frustrated at Phraya Chumporn&#x27;s actions, and hostilities were heightened. Nangklao ordered the Siamese armies to leave to avoid further conflict.

In 1825, Henry Burney arrived to negotiate peace agreements. The Burney Treaty was the first treaty with the West in the Rattanakosin period. Its purpose was to established free trade in Siam and to greatly reduce taxation on foreign trading ships. That it accomplished the objectives is disputed.

In 1833, US President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s &quot;special agent&quot; and envoy Edmund Roberts, referring often to Crawfurd&#x27;s account, concluded the Siamese–American Treaty of Amity and Commerce, signed at the Royal City of Sia-Yut&#x27;hia (Bangkok) on 20 March, the last of the fourth month of the year 1194 CS (Chula Sakarat). This treaty, with later modifications, is still in force. Dan Beach Bradley, an American physician and prominent Western personality of the time, introduced printing and vaccination.

==Anouvong insurgency==
The three Laotian kingdoms (Lan Xang in Vientiane, Luang Prabang, and Champasak) became Siamese tributary states after Chao Phraya Maha Kshatriyaseuk (King Rama I, Nangklao&#x27;s grandfather) had conquered them in 1778. Anouvong, the son of the king of Vientiene, was taken to Bangkok as a captive. He spent nearly thirty years in Siam and joined the Siamese forces in wars with Burma. In 1805, Anouvong returned to Vientiane to be crowned as the king.

In 1824, Phutthaloetla Naphalai died and, in the following year, Siam was dragged into conflicts with the British Empire. Anouvong saw this as an opportunity to wield his power. In 1825, returning from the funeral of Phutthaloetla Naphalai in Bangkok, Anouvong assembled a large force and went on the offensive. After defeating Bangkok-vassal principalities along the way, Anouvong captured Korat, the main defensive stronghold of Siam in the northeast. He forced the city to be evacuated while marching to Saraburi, on approach to the capital, Bangkok. However, the Korat captives rebelled—said to have been at the instigation of Lady Mo, wife of a ruling noble of Korat—although this claim is countered by many historians who say Mo had no heroic role in the events at Tung Samrit, though a contemporary account did mention her action. As Bangkok gathered counterattacking troops, Anouvong withdrew to return to Vientiane.

Nangklao sent his uncle Maha Sakdi Polsep the Front Palace and Sing Singhaseni (at the time styled Phraya Ratchasuphawadi) to defeat the armies of Anouvong in Isan. Anouvong was defeated and fled to Vietnam. The Siamese captured Vientiane and ordered the evacuation of the city.

In 1827, Nangklao ordered the total destruction of Vientiane. Anouvong returned to Laos with Vietnamese forces. Ratchasuphawadi led the Siamese to fight and the engagements occurred at Nong Khai. Anouvong was defeated again and, after an attempt to flee, was captured. Vientiane was razed, extinguishing her 200 year reign, and ceased to be a kingdom. Anouvong was imprisoned in an iron cage in front of the Suthaisawan Hall and died in 1829.

==Vietnam and Cambodia==

In 1810, internal conflicts between Cambodian princes forced Ang Im and Ang Duong to flee to Bangkok. Otteyraja of Cambodia turned to Gia Long of Vietnam for support against the opposing princes. However, this was perceived by Siam as treacherous as the two countries had fought for centuries for control of Cambodia.

In 1833, the Lê Văn Khôi revolt against Minh Mạng broke out in Vietnam. Lê Văn Khôi, the rebel leader, sought Siamese aid. Nangklao intended to take this opportunity to install a pro-Siamese monarch on the Cambodian throne.

Phraya Ratchasuphawadi, who had been promoted to &quot;Chao Phraya&quot; Bodindecha, was ordered to capture Saigon. Dis Bunnag, the Minister of &quot;Kromma Tha&quot;, commanded a fleet to rendezvous with ground forces at Saigon. The two Cambodian princes, Ang Im and Ang Duong, also joined the expedition. Bodindecha took Udongk and the fleet took Bantey Mas. The fleet proceeded to Saigon but was repelled.

Bodindecha then took Phnom Penh and again invaded Vietnam by land in 1842. In 1845, the Vietnamese recaptured Phnom Penh, but Bodindecha was able to defend Udongk. In 1847, prompted by Emperor Thiệu Trị&#x27;s treatment of Christian missionaries, French forces invaded Vietnam. A cessation of hostilities with Siam was negotiated. Ang Duong was installed as the Cambodian monarch under the equal patronage of both Siam and Vietnam, thus ending the war.

==Revolt of Kedah==
In 1837, Krom Somdet Phra Sri Suralai, mother of Nangklao, died. All officials throughout the kingdom went to Bangkok to attend the funeral. At Syburi (Kedah of Malaysia now), without the presence of Siamese governors, a nephew of the Sultan of Kedah then staged a revolt. Nangklao then sent Tat Bunnag down south to subjugate the rebellion quickly in 1838. Tat then suggested an autonomous government for Kedah Sultanate. In 1839, Kedah was divided into four autonomous parts.

==Religious devotion and educational reforms==
Nangklao was famous for his Buddhist faith. He fed the poor each day after becoming prince, and released animals every monastery day. More than 50 temples were built and repaired in his reign, including the first Chinese style temple at Rajorasa, the highest stupa at Wat Arun, the Golden Mountain at Wat Saket, the metal temple at Wat Ratchanadda, and Chetupol Temple or Wat Pho. Wat Pho is the site of the first university in Thailand. Under his reign, King Rama III was also responsible for the writing of the Chindamanee textbook and also the revision of the Buddhist textbook the Tripitaka which was to be distributed throughout the kingdom. In addition to that Rama III also allowed monks to use castles as classrooms for the teaching of Buddhism.

==Death and legacy==
Nangklao died on 2 April 1851 without having named a successor. He had 51 children including sons, but had raised none of his consorts to the queen. The throne passed to his half-brother, Prince Mongkut.

Nangklao stated on his deathbed that &quot;Our wars with Burma and Vietnam were over, only the threats of the Westerners was left to us. We should study their innovations for our own benefits but not to the degree of obsession or worship.&quot; This vision coincided with Western intervention in Siam in the reign of Mongkut. He was able to predict, but not live to see the neighboring kingdoms of Burma and Vietnam fall to European colonial rule.

During his reign, trade between Siam and China became lucrative. The king kept his profits in red purses beside his bed, subsequently this money was known as &quot;red purse money&quot;. Nangklao stipulated that the red purse money that he had earned through his business acumen should be set aside as the state&#x27;s emergency fund for the future &quot;so that Siam would be able to buy the land back&quot; if it fell into a squabble with a foreign power. In the reign of his nephew Chulalongkorn, Siam indeed had to pay reparations to France for the 1893 Paknam incident during the Franco-Siamese crisis, and funding in part came from Nangklao&#x27;s red purse money.

<doc id="203756" wikidata="Q855252" url="?curid=203756" title="Bhumibol Adulyadej">
<text>Bhumibol Adulyadej (5 December 192713 October 2016), titled Rama IX, was King of Thailand from 1946 until his death in 2016. His reign of 70 years and 126 days is the longest of any Thai monarch, the longest on record of any independent Asian sovereign, and the third-longest of any sovereign state.

Born in the United States, Bhumibol spent his early life in Switzerland, in the aftermath of the 1932 Siamese revolution, which toppled Thailand&#x27;s centuries-old absolute monarchy, ruled at the time by his uncle, King Prajadhipok (Rama VII). He ascended to the throne in June 1946, succeeding his brother, King Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII), who had died under mysterious circumstances. 

In the course of his rule, Bhumibol presided over Thailand&#x27;s transformation into a major US ally and a regional economic power. Between 1985 and 1994, Thailand was the world&#x27;s fastest-growing economy, according to the World Bank, and in the 1990s was predicted by many international journalists to be the next &quot;Asian Tiger&quot;. During this period, the country also saw the emergence of an urban middle class as well as mass political participation in its electoral politics. However, this rapid economic growth came to an end with the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which triggered political instability in Thailand during the 2000s and 2010s. Bhumibol&#x27;s reign was characterized by several periods of gradual democratization punctuated by frequent military coups. The 2014 coup, the last coup during Bhumibol&#x27;s reign, ended 20 years of civilian government and saw the return of the Thai military&#x27;s influence within Thai politics.

&quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Bhumibol&#x27;s fortune—including property and investments managed by the Crown Property Bureau, a body that is neither private nor government-owned (assets managed by the Bureau were owned by the crown as an institution, not by the monarch as an individual)—to be  billion in 2010, and he headed the magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;world&#x27;s richest royals&quot; from 2008 to 2013. In 2014, Bhumibol&#x27;s wealth was again listed as  billion.

After a period of deteriorating health which left him hospitalized on several occasions, Bhumibol died in 2016 at Siriraj Hospital. He was highly revered by the people in Thailand—some saw him as close to divine. Notable political activists and Thai citizens who criticized the king or the institution of monarchy were often forced into exile or suffered frequent imprisonments. His cremation was held in 2017 at the royal crematorium at Sanam Luang. His son, Vajiralongkorn, succeeded him as King Rama X of Thailand.

==Early life==

Bhumibol was born at Cambridge Hospital (now Mount Auburn Hospital) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, on 5 December 1927, during the reign of his paternal uncle, King Rama VII (Prajadhipok). He was the youngest son of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, the Prince of Songkla, and his commoner wife Mom Sangwan (later Princess Srinagarindra, the Princess Mother). His father was enrolled in the public health program at Harvard University, which is why Bhumibol was the only monarch to be born in the US. Bhumibol had an older sister, Princess Galyani Vadhana, and an older brother, Prince Ananda Mahidol.

His US birth certificate read simply &quot;Baby Songkla&quot;, as the parents had to consult his uncle, King Prajadhipok, then head of the House of Chakri, for an auspicious name. The king chose a name of Sanskrit origin, &quot;Bhumibol Adulyadej&quot; (Devanagari: भूमिबल अतुल्यतेज, : &quot;Bhūmibala Atulyateja&quot;), a compound of &quot;Bhūmi&quot; (), meaning &quot;Land&quot;; &quot;Bala&quot; (), meaning &quot;Strength&quot; or &quot;Power&quot;; &quot;Atulya&quot; (), meaning &quot;Incomparable&quot;; and &quot;Tej&quot; (), meaning &quot;Power&quot;. Thus, &quot;Bhūmibala Atulyateja&quot;, or &quot;Bhumibol Adulyadej&quot; as it is transliterated in Thai, can be literally translated as &quot;Strength of the Land, Incomparable Power&quot;.

Bhumibol came to Thailand in 1928, after his father obtained a certificate from Harvard. His father died of kidney failure in September 1929, when Bhumibol was less than two years old. He briefly attended Mater Dei school in Bangkok, but in 1933 his mother took her family to Switzerland, where he continued his education at the École nouvelle de la Suisse romande in Lausanne. In 1934 Bhumibol was given his first camera, which ignited his lifelong enthusiasm for photography. When Bhumibol&#x27;s childless uncle Prajadhipok abdicated in 1935, his nine-year-old brother Ananda Mahidol became King Rama VIII. However, the family remained in Switzerland and the affairs of the head of state were conducted by a regency council. They returned to Thailand for only two months in 1938. In 1942, Bhumibol became a jazz enthusiast, and started to play the saxophone, a passion that he kept throughout his life. He received the &quot;baccalauréat des lettres&quot; (high-school diploma with a major in French literature, Latin, and Greek) from the Gymnase Classique Cantonal de Lausanne, and by 1945 had begun studying sciences at the University of Lausanne, when World War II ended and the family was able to return to Thailand.

==Accession and marriage==

Bhumibol ascended the throne following the death by gunshot wound of his brother, King Ananda Mahidol, on 9 June 1946, under circumstances that remain unclear. While an initial government statement stated that Ananda had accidentally shot himself, an investigation committee ruled this was virtually impossible. Three palace aides (Chit Singhaseni, But Patthamasarin, and Chaliao Pathumrot) were eventually convicted of regicide, and were executed by firing squad on 17 February 1955, after their appeals for clemency were rejected by Bhumibol. A third possibility, that Bhumibol accidentally shot his brother while the brothers played with their pistols, was never officially considered.

Bhumibol succeeded his brother, but returned to Switzerland before the end of the 100-day mourning period. Despite his interest in science and technology, he changed his major and enrolled in law and political science to prepare for his duties as head of state. His uncle, Rangsit, Prince of Chainat, was appointed Prince Regent. In Bhumibol&#x27;s name, Prince Rangsit acknowledged a military coup that overthrew the government of Thamrongnawasawat in November 1947. The regent also signed the 1949 constitution, which returned to the monarchy many of the powers it had lost by the 1932 Revolution.

In 1948, the royalist government made a law that increase the power to control the Crown Property by the monarch as the restoration of their political power and assets, which was taken to the state property by the People Party from the Siamese revolution of 1932. Additionally, former Queen Rambhai Barni, Bhumibol&#x27;s aunt was returned the 6 million baht that the People Party seized.

In December 1946, the Siamese government allocated several hundred thousand dollars for the ceremonial cremation of the remains of the late King Ananda, a necessary preliminary to the coronation of Bhumibol who was required by religious custom to light the funeral pyre. Unsettled conditions in 1947 following a coup d&#x27;état resulted in a postponement, and court astrologers determined that 2 March 1949 was the most auspicious date.

While doing his degree in Switzerland, Bhumibol visited Paris frequently. It was in Paris that he first met Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara, daughter of the Thai ambassador to France (Nakkhatra Mangala) and a great-granddaughter of King Chulalongkorn and thus a cousin of Bhumibol. She was then 15 years old and training to be a concert pianist.

On 4 October 1948, while Bhumibol was driving a Fiat Topolino on the Geneva-Lausanne road, he collided with the rear of a braking truck 10 km outside Lausanne. He injured his back, suffered paralysis in half of his face and incurred cuts on his face that cost him the sight of his right eye. Both the royal cremation and coronation had to be postponed once more. While he was hospitalised in Lausanne, Sirikit visited him frequently. She met his mother, who asked her to continue her studies nearby so that Bhumibol could get to know her better. Bhumibol selected for her a boarding school in Lausanne, Riante Rive. A quiet engagement in Lausanne followed on 19 July 1949, and they were married on 28 April 1950, just a week before his coronation. Their wedding was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;the shortest, simplest royal wedding ever held in the land of gilded elephants and white umbrellas&quot;. The ceremony was performed by Bhumibol&#x27;s ageing grandmother, Savang Vadhana.

Bhumibol and Sirikit had four children:
* (Formerly HRH) Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya, born 5 April 1951 in Lausanne, Switzerland; married Peter Ladd Jensen (now divorced), and has two daughters. Her son, Bhumi Jensen, was killed in the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.
* King Maha Vajiralongkorn (Rama X), born 28 July 1952; married Mom Luang Soamsawali Kitiyakara (later divorced and became HRH the Princess Niece); one daughter. Then married Yuvadhida Polpraserth (later divorced); four sons and a daughter. Third marriage was to Srirasmi Suwadee (now divorced); one son. Fourth and current marriage is to Suthida Tidjai.
* HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, The Princess Royal, born 2 April 1955; never married, no issue
* HRH Princess Chulabhorn Walailak, born 4 July 1957; married Virayudh Tishyasarin (now divorced); two daughters

==Coronation and titles==

After presiding over the long-delayed, ceremonial cremation of his brother Ananda Mahidol, Bhumibol was crowned King of Thailand on 5 May 1950 in the Phaisan Thaksin Throne Hall in the Grand Palace in Bangkok. It was the first coronation ceremony of a Thai sovereign to rule under the system of constitutional monarchy. During the ceremony, he pledged that he would &quot;reign with righteousness for the benefit and happiness of the Siamese people&quot;. Notable elements associated with the coronation included the beneath the Great White Umbrella of State and royal regalia and utensils.

In 1950 on Coronation Day, Bhumibol&#x27;s consort was made queen (Somdej Phra Boromarajini). The date of his coronation is celebrated each 5 May in Thailand as Coronation Day, a public holiday.

The royal couple spent their honeymoon at Hua Hin before they returned to Switzerland, where the king completed his university studies. They returned to Thailand in 1951.

Following the death of his grandmother Queen Savang Vadhana, Bhumibol entered a 15-day monkhood (22 October 19565 November 1956) at Wat Bowonniwet, as is customary for Buddhist males on the death of elder relatives. He was ordained by the Supreme Patriarch on 22 October 1956 at the Royal Chapel of the Emerald Buddha in the Grand Palace. At this time, Sirikit was appointed his regent. She was later appointed Queen Regent (Somdej Phra Boromarajininat) in recognition of this.

Although Bhumibol was sometimes referred to as King Rama IX in English, Thais referred to him as &quot;Nai Luang&quot; or &quot;Phra Chao Yu Hua&quot;, which translated to &quot;the King&quot; and &quot;Lord Upon our Heads&quot;, respectively. He was also called &quot;Chao Chiwit&quot; (&quot;Lord of Life&quot;). Formally, he was referred to as &quot;Phrabat Somdet Phra Chao Yu Hua&quot; or, in legal documents, &quot;Phrabat Somdet Phra Paraminthara Maha Bhumibol Adulyadej&quot;, and in English as &quot;His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej&quot;. He signed his name as (Bhumibol Adulyadej Por Ror, the Thai equivalent of &quot;Bhumibol Adulyadej R[ex])&quot;.

==Role in Thai politics==
In 1957, a military coup overthrew the government of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram with allegations of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;, corruption and manipulation of the election held earlier that year. This began a new and long-lasting relationship between the monarch and military, leading some to perceive that the king condones the Thammasat University massacre in defense of his throne, and support a series of military dictatorships. However, during his interview given to the BBC in 1979, the king reiterated that the monarchy should remain impartial and be in peaceful co-existence with everybody. Bhumibol invited public criticism in a 2005 speech, but the &quot;lèse majesté&quot; laws have not been revoked by the Thai parliament yet.

===Plaek Phibunsongkhram era===
In the early years of his reign, during the government of military dictator Plaek Phibunsongkhram, Bhumibol had no real political power and was little more than a ceremonial figure under the military-dominated government. In August 1957, six months after parliamentary elections, General Sarit Thanarat accused the government of Field Marshal Phibunsongkhram of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; due to its conduct of the 2,500th anniversary celebration of Buddhism. On 16 September 1957, Phibunsongkhram went to Bhumibol to seek support for his government. Bhumibol advised the field marshal to resign to avoid a coup. Phibunsongkhram refused. That evening, Sarit Thanarat seized power. Two hours later Bhumibol imposed martial law throughout the kingdom. Bhumibol issued a proclamation appointing Sarit as &quot;military defender of the capital&quot; without anyone countersigning the proclamation. It included the following:

Whereas it appears that the public administration by the government under the premiership of Field Marshal P. Phibunsongkhram is untrustworthy, and that the government could not maintain the public order; and whereas the military, led by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, has successfully taken over the public administration and now acts as the Military Defender of the Capital; now, therefore, I do hereby appoint Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat as the Military Defender of the Capital, and command that all the citizens shall remain calm whilst all the government officers shall serve the orders issued by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat. This Proclamation shall come into force immediately. Done this 16th Day of September, Buddhist Era 2500 (1957). Sarit later admitted in a rare interview with foreign correspondent that the king had no involvement and did not acknowledge anything about the coup until it had been done successfully.

===Sarit Thanarat era===


During Sarit&#x27;s dictatorship, the monarchy was revitalised. Bhumibol attended public ceremonies, toured the provinces and patronised development projects, he also visited the United States in June 1960, addressing Congress, and many countries in Europe, including a visit to Rome, hosted by PM Giovanni Gronchi, in September 1960.

Under Sarit, the practice of crawling in front of royalty during audiences, banned by King Chulalongkorn, was revived in certain situations and the royal-sponsored Thammayut Nikaya order was revitalised. For the first time since the absolute monarchy was overthrown, a king was conveyed up the Chao Phraya River in a Royal Barge Procession to offer robes at temples.

Other disused ceremonies from the classical period of the Chakri Dynasty, such as the royally patronised ploughing ceremony (Thai: พิธีพืชมงคล), were also revived. Bhumibol&#x27;s birthday (5 December) was declared the national day, replacing the previous national day, the anniversary of the Siamese revolution of 1932 (24 June). Upon Sarit&#x27;s death on 8 December 1963, an unprecedented 21 days of mourning were declared in the palace. A royal five-tier umbrella shaded his body while it lay in state. Long-time royal adviser Phraya Srivisaravacha later noted that no Prime Minister ever had such an intimate relationship with Bhumibol as Sarit.

Bhumibol biographer Paul Handley, in &quot;The King Never Smiles&quot;, writes that the dictator Sarit was Bhumibol&#x27;s tool. Political scientist Thak Chaloemtiarana writes that Sarit used Bhumibol in order to build his own credibility.

===Thammasat University massacre===

Following Sarit&#x27;s death General Thanom Kittikachorn rose to power to lead Thailand&#x27;s military dictatorship, ultimately challenged by the 1973 Thai popular uprising. Bhumibol initially asked student protestors to disband. When police attacked and killed dozens of students, sparking protest riots, Bhumibol announced general Thanom&#x27;s resignation and departure from Thailand. According to William Stevenson, the king had asked the three tyrants to avoid bloodshed; although the three tyrants had agreed, they later changed their minds. Eventually, it led to the incidents of October 1973.

Bhumibol distanced himself from the Thai military after Thanom&#x27;s fall. Political events in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos brought powerful guerrilla and communist movements into power or prominence, which threatened the Thai monarchy and political establishment. Fearing unrest, Bhumibol began to court the military in 1975, visiting camps throughout the country, and publicly warning of internal and external threats. At this time, Bhumibol increasingly cultivated far-right militias and paramilitary forces, including the Red Gaurs and the Village Scouts, warning that students and political dissidents planned to bring communists to power in Thailand. Finally, Bhumibol provoked outrage among students and legal groups by inviting general Thanom back into the country.

The ensuing chaos was used as a pretext for a military coup, which Bhumibol backed and described as a manifestation of the people&#x27;s will. The event that catalyzed the coup was the Thammasat University massacre, carried out in the name of defending Bhumibol&#x27;s throne. The victorious military junta submitted three names to the king as possible premiers: Deputy President of the king&#x27;s Privy Council , right-wing Bangkok Governor , and staunchly anti-communist Supreme Court judge Thanin Kraivichien. Bhumibol chose Thanin as the most suitable premier, leading student protesters to flee to join the communists in the jungle. Thanin was overthrown in a military coup in October 1977 led by General Kriangsak Chamanan.

===Prem Tinsulanonda era===
Kriangsak was succeeded in 1980 by the popular Army Commander-in-Chief, General Prem Tinsulanonda, who later became the Privy Council President.

Bhumibol&#x27;s refusal to endorse military coups in April 1981 and September 1985 ultimately led to the victory of forces loyal to the government, despite some violence – including, in 1981, the seizure of Bangkok by rebel forces. The coups led many to believe that Bhumibol had misjudged Thai society and that his credibility as an impartial mediator between various political and military factions had been compromised.

In 1989, Bhumibol became the world&#x27;s longest-reigning living monarch following the deaths of Emperor Hirohito of Japan and Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein.

===1992 crisis===
In 1992, Bhumibol played a key role in Thailand&#x27;s transition to a democratic system. The 1991 Thai coup d&#x27;état on 23 February returned Thailand to military dictatorship. After a general election in 1992, the majority parties invited General Suchinda Kraprayoon, a leader of the coup group, to be prime minister. This caused much dissent, which escalated into demonstrations called Black May that led to a large number of deaths when the military was brought in to control protesters. The situation became increasingly critical as police and military forces clashed with protesters. Violence and riots spread to many areas of the capital with rumours of a rift among the armed forces.

Amidst the fear of civil war, Bhumibol intervened. He summoned Suchinda and the leader of the pro-democracy movement, retired Major General Chamlong Srimuang, to a televised audience, and urged them to find a peaceful resolution. At the height of the crisis, the sight of both men appearing together on their knees (in accordance with royal protocol) made a strong impression on the nation. Bhumibol then signed Suchinda&#x27;s amnesty decree that applied to both sides of the conflict, with the reason to protect security and unity of the country. Suchinda resigned soon afterwards.

It was one of the few occasions in which Bhumibol directly and publicly intervened in a political conflict. A general election was held shortly afterward, leading to a civilian government.

===2005–2006 crisis===

Weeks before the April 2006 legislative election, the Democrat Party-led opposition and the People&#x27;s Alliance for Democracy petitioned Bhumibol to appoint a replacement prime minister and cabinet. Demands for royal intervention were met with much criticism from the public. Bhumibol, in a speech on 26 April 2006, responded, &quot;Asking for a Royally-appointed prime minister is undemocratic. It is, pardon me, a mess. It is irrational&quot;.

After publicly claiming victory in the boycotted April parliamentary elections, Thaksin Shinawatra had a private audience with the king. A few hours later, Thaksin appeared on national television to announce that he would be taking a break from politics. Due to the election result, Bhumibol took the unprecedented step of calling the elections undemocratic.

In May 2006, the Sondhi Limthongkul-owned &quot;Manager Daily&quot; newspaper published a series of articles describing the &quot;Finland Plot&quot;, alleging that Thaksin and former members of the Communist Party of Thailand planned to overthrow the king and seize control of the nation. No evidence was ever produced to verify the existence of such a plot, and Thaksin and his Thai Rak Thai party vehemently denied the accusations and sued the accusers.

In a rare, televised speech to senior judges, Bhumibol requested the judiciary to take action to resolve the political crisis. On 8 May 2006, the Constitutional Court invalidated the results of the April elections and ordered new elections scheduled for 15 October 2006. The Criminal Court later jailed the Election Commissioners.

On 14 July, Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda addressed graduating cadets of the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, telling them that the Thai military must serve the nation and the king—not the government.

On 20 July, Bhumibol signed a royal decree calling new House elections for 15 October 2006. In an unprecedented act, the King wrote a note on the royal decree calling for a clean and fair election. Bhumibol also underwent spinal surgery that day.

=== 60th anniversary celebrations ===

A series of celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of Bhumibol&#x27;s accession were held in June 2006. Events included a royal barge procession on the Chao Phraya River, fireworks displays, art exhibitions, and the pardoning of 25,000 prisoners, concerts, and dance performances.

Tied in with the anniversary, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan presented Bhumibol with the United Nations Development Programme&#x27;s first Human Development Lifetime Achievement Award on 26 May 2006. National holidays were observed on 9 June and 12–13 June 2006. On 9 June, the king and queen appeared on the balcony of Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall before hundreds of thousands of people. The official royal barge procession on 12 June was attended by the king and queen and royal visitors from 26 other countries. On 13 June, a state banquet for the royal visitors was held in the newly constructed Rama IX Throne Hall at the Grand Palace, the first official function of the hall. The Chiang Mai Royal Floral Expo was also held to honour the anniversary.

===2006 coup===

On the evening of 19 September, the Thai military overthrew the Thaksin government and seized control of Bangkok in a bloodless coup. The junta, led by the Sonthi Boonyaratglin, Commander of the Army, called itself the Council for Democratic Reform under the Constitutional Monarchy. It accused the deposed prime minister and his regime of crimes, including lèse majesté, and pledged its loyalty to Bhumibol. Martial law was declared, the constitution repealed and the October elections cancelled. Protests and political meetings were banned.

The king&#x27;s role in the coup was the subject of much speculation among Thai analysts and the international media, although publication of such speculation was banned in Thailand. The king had an audience with Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda at the same time that special forces troops were mobilised. Anti-coup protesters claimed that Prem was the mastermind of the coup, although the military claimed otherwise and banned any discussion of the topic. In a BBC interview, Thitinan Pongsudhirak of Chulalongkorn University noted, &quot;This coup was nothing short of Thaksin versus the King... He [the king] is widely seen as having implicitly endorsed the coup.&quot; In the same interview, social critic Sulak Sivaraksa claimed, &quot;Without his [the king&#x27;s] involvement, the coup would have been impossible.&quot; Sulak added that the king is &quot;very skillful. He never becomes obviously involved. If this coup goes wrong, Sonthi will get the blame, but whatever happens, the King will only get praise.&quot; The junta later warned it would &quot;urgently retaliate against foreign reporters whose coverage has been deemed insulting to the monarchy.&quot; Prem did help secure the appointment of Surayud Chulanont, another member of the King&#x27;s Privy Council, as Premier, and allegedly had a say in the appointment of Surayud&#x27;s Cabinet. Critics claimed the cabinet was full of &quot;Prem&#x27;s boys&quot;.

The junta appointed a constitutional tribunal to rule on alleged polling fraud involving the Thai Rak Thai and Democrat political parties. Guilty rulings would have dissolved both parties, Thailand&#x27;s largest and oldest, respectively, and banned the parties&#x27; leadership from politics for five years. The weeks leading up to the verdicts saw rising political tensions. On 24 May 2007, about a week before the scheduled verdict, Bhumibol gave a rare speech to the Supreme Administrative Court (the president of which is also a member of the constitutional tribunal). &quot;You have the responsibility to prevent the country from collapsing&quot;, he warned them in the speech, which was shown on all national television channels simultaneously during the evening. &quot;The nation needs political parties... In my mind, I have a judgment but I cannot say&quot;, he said. &quot;Either way the ruling goes, it will be bad for the country, there will be mistakes&quot;. The tribunal later acquitted the Democrat Party, but dissolved the Thai Rak Thai Party and banned 111 of its executives from politics for five years.

The junta-appointed Constitution Drafting Assembly later tried to use the King in a propaganda campaign to increase public support for its widely criticised draft constitution. The CDA placed billboards saying &quot;Love the King. Care about the King. Vote in the referendum&quot; throughout northeast Thailand, where opposition to the junta was greatest.

On 20 April 2009, Thaksin claimed in an interview with the &quot;Financial Times&quot; that Bhumibol had been briefed by Privy Councillors Prem Tinsulanonda and Surayud Chulanont about their plans to stage the 2006 coup. He claimed that General Panlop Pinmanee, a leader of the People&#x27;s Alliance for Democracy, had told him of the briefing. The Thai embassy in London denied Thaksin&#x27;s claims.

===2008 crisis===
The military&#x27;s constitution passed the referendum, and a general election was held in December 2007. The People&#x27;s Power Party (PPP), consisting of many former Thai Rak Thai Party MPs and supporters, won the majority and formed a government. The People&#x27;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) refused to accept the election results and started protests, eventually laying siege to Government House, Don Mueang Airport, and Suvarnabhumi Airport. Although the PAD claimed they were defending the monarchy, Bhumibol remained silent. However, after a PAD supporter died in a clash with police, Queen Sirikit presided over her cremation. Princess Sirindhorn, when asked at a US press conference whether PAD was acting on behalf of the monarchy, replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t think so. They do things for themselves.&quot; Questioning and criticism over Bhumibol&#x27;s role in the crisis increased, particularly from the international press. &quot;It is more and more difficult for them to hold the illusion that the monarchy is universally adored&quot;, says a Thai academic.

In April 2008, Bhumibol appointed alleged coup plotter General Surayud Chulanont to the Privy Council of Thailand. In the weeks leading up to the 2011 general election, Bhumibol appointed Air Chief Marshal Chalit Pukbhasuk, a leader of the 2006 military coup, to his privy council.

===2013–2014 crisis and coup===

On 22 May 2014, Prayut Chan-o-cha, Commander of the Royal Thai Army launched a coup d&#x27;état, the 12th since the country&#x27;s first coup in 1932, against the caretaker government, following six months of political crisis. On 24 May 2014, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) said Bhumibol had acknowledged the coup, but stopped short of describing the response as an endorsement. However, two days later, he formally appointed General Prayut to run the country. In Thailand the monarchy is highly respected and royal endorsement was seen as a legitimization of the takeover.

Paul Chambers, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said that the military was the only institution that could sustain the power of the monarchy, and that the most recent two coups showed a relationship between the military and the monarch as Bhumibol gave an endorsement to each of them.

==Declining health==

Bhumibol suffered from lumbar spinal stenosis, and received a microsurgical decompression for the condition in July 2006. He was admitted to the hospital in October 2007 and diagnosed with a blood shortage to his brain. He received treatment for various ailments including heart problems and was released after three weeks.

Bhumibol was again admitted to Siriraj Hospital in September 2009, apparently suffering from flu and pneumonia. In 2011, it was revealed as part of WikiLeaks&#x27; leak of United States diplomatic cables that he had suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease and depression. He was diagnosed with diverticulitis in hospital in November 2011, and was treated for the condition in January 2012. Bhumibol suffered minute subdural bleeding in the left frontal area of his brain for which he was treated in July 2012. Bhumibol left the hospital in July 2013, and travelled to Klai Kangwon Palace at Hua Hin on 2 August 2013, but returned intermittently in the following years, most recently on 1 June 2015.

Bhumibol was too ill to appear for the public celebration of his birthday on 5 December 2015, but made a televised appearance on 14 December, his first in several months. The king temporarily left hospital for a brief visit to Chitralada Royal Villa on 11 January 2016. In February, he developed a high fever due to sepsis, which improved following antibiotics treatment. By October, the king subsequently developed organ failure owing to hypotension and became dependent on hemodialysis due to kidney failure.

==Death==
King Bhumibol Adulyadej died at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand on 13 October 2016, at 15:52 local time, at the age of 88, as announced by the royal palace later that day. The following day, his body was taken by motorcade to the Grand Palace for the customary bathing rite. Thousands of the bereaved public lined the route, demonstrating their affection for their &quot;king of kings&quot;. The royal procession arrived at the Grand Palace through Viset Chaisri Gate at 17:00. His only son and the next in line to rule the kingdom, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, presided over the bathing ritual at Phiman Rattaya Throne Hall.

A royal cremation ceremony took place over five days at the end of October 2017. The actual cremation, which was not broadcast on television, was held in the late evening of 26 October 2017. Following cremation his ashes were taken to the Grand Palace and were enshrined at the Chakri Maha Phasat Throne Hall (royal remains), the Royal Cemetery at Wat Ratchabophit and the Wat Bowonniwet Vihara Royal Temple (royal ashes). Following burial, the mourning period officially ended on midnight of 30 October 2017, after which Thais resumed wearing regular colours while they awaited the future coronation of King Vajiralongkorn, which was hosted between 4–6 May 2019.

==Royal powers==
===Constitutional powers===

Bhumibol retained enormous powers, partly because of his immense popularity and partly because his powers – although clearly defined in the Thai constitution – were often subject to conflicting interpretations. This was highlighted by the controversy surrounding the appointment of Jaruvan Maintaka as Auditor-General. Jaruvan had been appointed by The State Audit Commission, but in July 2004, the Constitutional Court ruled that her appointment was unconstitutional. Jaruvan refused to vacate her office without an explicit order from Bhumibol, on the grounds that she had previously been royally approved. When the Senate elected a replacement for Jaruvan, Bhumibol refused to approve him. The Senate declined to vote to override Bhumibol&#x27;s veto. Finally in February 2006 the Audit Commission reinstated Jaruvan when it became clear from a memo from the Office of the King&#x27;s Principal Private Secretary that King Bhumibol supported her appointment.
Bhumibol only vetoed legislation on rare occasions. In 1976, when the Parliament voted 149–19 to extend democratic elections down to district levels, Bhumibol refused to sign the law. The Parliament refused to vote to overturn the King&#x27;s veto. In 1954, Bhumibol vetoed parliamentary-approved land reform legislation twice before consenting to sign it. The law limited the maximum land an individual could hold to 50 rai (), at a time when the Crown Property Bureau was the kingdom&#x27;s largest land-owner. The law was not enforced as General Sarit soon overthrew the elected government in a coup and repealed the law.

Bhumibol had the constitutional prerogative to pardon criminals, although there are several criteria for receiving a pardon, including age and remaining sentence. The 2006 pardoning of several convicted child rapists, including an Australian rapist and child pornographer, caused controversy. However, under the Thai constitution, the king has the prerogative to grant pardons and all laws, royal rescripts, and royal commands relating to state affairs must be countersigned by a minister unless otherwise provided for in the constitution.

===Network monarchy and extraconstitutional powers===
Several academics outside Thailand, including Duncan McCargo and Federico Ferrara, noted the active but indirect political involvement of Bhumibol through a &quot;network monarchy&quot;, whose most significant proxy is Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda. McCargo claimed that Bhumibol&#x27;s conservative network worked behind the scenes to establish political influence in the 1990s, but was threatened by the landslide election victories of Thaksin Shinawatra in 2001 and 2005. Ferrara claimed, shortly before the Thai Supreme Court delivered its verdict to seize Thaksin Shinawatra&#x27;s assets, that the judiciary was a well-established part of Bhumibol&#x27;s network and represented his main avenue to exercise extra-constitutional prerogatives despite having the appearance of being constitutional. He also noted how, in comparison to the Constitutional Court&#x27;s 2001 acquittal of Thaksin, the judiciary was a much more important part of the &quot;network&quot; than it was in the past.

The network&#x27;s ability to exercise power is based partly on Bhumibol&#x27;s popularity and strict control of Bhumibol&#x27;s popular image. According to Jost Pachaly of the Heinrich Böll Foundation, Bhumibol &quot;plays an important role behind the scenes. But the role is difficult to assess because nothing is reported about it and no one really knows anything specific&quot;, due to lese majeste laws forbidding discussion about Bhumibol&#x27;s political activities. Bhumibol&#x27;s popularity was demonstrated following the 2003 Phnom Penh riots in Cambodia, when hundreds of Thai protesters, enraged by rumors that Cambodian rioters had stomped on photographs of Bhumibol, gathered outside the Cambodian embassy in Bangkok. Photographs of the stomping were not published in Thailand, but were available on the internet. The situation was resolved peacefully only when Police General Sant Sarutanonda told the crowd that he had received a call from royal secretary Arsa Sarasin conveying Bhumibol&#x27;s request for calm. The crowd dispersed.

==Royal projects==
===History===

Bhumibol was involved in many social and economic development projects. The nature of his involvement varied by political regime.

The government of Plaek Phibunsongkhram (1951–1957) limited Bhumibol to a ceremonial role. During that period Bhumibol produced some films and operated a radio station from Chitlada Palace using personal funds.

In the military governments of Sarit Thanarat and his successors (1958–1980), Bhumibol was portrayed as the &quot;development King&quot; and the inspiration for the economic and political goals of the regime. Royally ordered projects were implemented under the financial and political support of the government, including projects in rural areas and communities under the influence of the Communist Party of Thailand. Bhumibol&#x27;s visits to these projects were heavily promoted by the Sarit government and broadcast in state-controlled media.

During the governments of General Prem Tinsulanonda (1981–1987), the relationship between the Thai state and the monarch was at its closest. Prem, later to become President of Bhumibol&#x27;s Privy Council, officially allocated government budgets and manpower to support royal projects. Most activities in this period involved the development of large-scale irrigation projects in rural areas.

During the modern period (post-1988), the structured development of the royal projects reached its apex. Bhumibol&#x27;s Chaipattana Foundation was established, promoting his &quot;sufficiency economy&quot; theory, an alternative to the export-oriented policies adopted by the period&#x27;s elected governments. Following the 2006 coup, establishment of a &quot;sufficiency economy&quot; was enshrined in the constitution as being a primary goal of the government, and government financial support for royal projects was boosted.

==Private life==

Bhumibol was a painter, musician, photographer, author and translator. His book &quot;Phra Mahachanok&quot; is based on a traditional &quot;Jataka&quot; story of Buddhist scripture. &quot;The Story of Thong Daeng&quot; is the story of his dog Thong Daeng.

In his youth, Bhumibol was greatly interested in firearms. He kept a carbine, a Sten gun and two automatic pistols in his bedroom, and he and his elder brother, King Ananda Mahidol, often used the gardens of the palace for target practice.

There are two English-language books that provide extensive detail—albeit not always verifiable—about Bhumibol&#x27;s life, especially his early years and then throughout his entire reign. One is &quot;The Revolutionary King&quot; (2001) by William Stevenson, the other is &quot;The King Never Smiles&quot; (2006) by Paul M. Handley. A third and earlier work, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Discus&quot; (1964), is also available in Thai and English. The latter two books are banned in Thailand, while the first has never been sold in the country due to its &quot;inaccuracies&quot;, despite having been written with royal patronage.

Bhumibol&#x27;s creativity in, among other things, music, art and invention, was the focus of a two-minute long documentary created by the government of Abhisit Vejjajiva that was screened at all branches of the Major Cineplex Group and SF Cinema City, the two largest cinema chains in Thailand.

===Music===
Bhumibol was an accomplished jazz saxophone player and composer, playing Dixieland and New Orleans jazz, and also the clarinet, trumpet, guitar, and piano. It is widely believed that his father, Mahidol Adulyadej, may have inspired his passion for artistic pursuits at an early age. Bhumibol initially focused on classical music exclusively for two years but eventually switched to jazz since it allowed him to improvise more freely. It was during this time that he decided to specialize in wind instruments, especially the saxophone and clarinet. By the time Bhumibol turned 18, he started to compose his own music with the first being &quot;Candlelight Blues&quot;. He continued to compose even during his reign following his coronation in 1946. Bhumibol performed with Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Benny Goodman, Stan Getz, Lionel Hampton, and Benny Carter. Throughout his life, Bhumibol wrote a total of 49 compositions. Much of it is jazz swing but he also composed marches, waltzes, and Thai patriotic songs. His most popular compositions were &quot;Candlelight Blues&quot;, &quot;Love at Sundown&quot;, and &quot;Falling Rain&quot; which were all composed in 1946. Bhumibol&#x27;s musical influences included Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Benny Carter, and Johnny Hodges. The Bhumibol Adulyadej (King of Thailand) Collection, 1946–1954 at the Library of Congress Music Division includes some of his compositions, including 13 music manuscripts, 100 pieces of printed music, clippings, correspondence, and other miscellaneous documents.

Bhumibol initially received general music training privately while he was studying in Switzerland, but his older brother, then King Ananda Mahidol, who had bought a saxophone, sent Bhumibol in his place. King Ananda would later join him on the clarinet. On his permanent return to Thailand in 1950, Bhumibol started a jazz band, Lay Kram, whom he performed with on a radio station he started at his palace. The band grew, being renamed the Au Sau Wan Suk Band and he would perform with them live on Friday evenings, occasionally taking telephoned requests. Bhumibol also performed with his band at Thai universities, composing anthems for the universities of Chulalongkorn, Thammasat, and Kasetsart. Bhumibol performed with Benny Goodman at the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall, in 1956, and later played at Goodman&#x27;s home in New York in 1960. Many bands such as Les Brown and His Band of Renown, Claude Bolling Big Band, and Preservation Hall Jazz Band recorded some of Bhumibol&#x27;s compositions and can still be heard in Thailand. A 1996 documentary, &quot;Gitarajan&quot;, was made about Bhumibol&#x27;s music.

Bhumibol still played music with his Au Sau Wan Suk Band in later years, but was rarely heard in public. In 1964, Bhumibol became the 23rd person to receive the Certificate of Bestowal of Honorary Membership on behalf of Vienna&#x27;s University of Music and Performing Arts.

===Sailing===
Bhumibol was an accomplished sailor and sailboat designer. He won a gold medal for sailing in the Fourth Southeast Asian Peninsular (SEAP) Games in 1967, together with Princess Ubol Ratana whom he tied for points. This accomplishment was all the more remarkable given Bhumibol&#x27;s lack of binocular depth perception. On 19 April 1966, Bhumibol also sailed the Gulf of Thailand from Hua Hin to Toey Ngam Harbour in Sattahip, covering in a 17-hour journey on the &quot;Vega 1&quot;, an OK Class dinghy he built.

Like his father, a former military naval engineer, Bhumibol was an avid boat designer and builder. He produced several small sailboat designs in the International Enterprise, OK, and Moth classes. His designs in the Moth class included the &quot;Mod&quot;, &quot;Super Mod&quot;, and &quot;Micro Mod&quot;.

===Radio amateur===
Bhumibol was a radio amateur with the call sign HS1A. He was also the patron of the Radio Amateur Society of Thailand (RAST).

===Patents===
Bhumibol was the only Thai monarch to hold a patent. He obtained one in 1993 for a waste water aerator named &quot;Chai Pattana&quot;, and several patents on rainmaking after 1955: the &quot;sandwich&quot; rainmaking patent in 1999 and the &quot;supersandwich&quot; patent in 2003.

==Wealth==
Estimates of the post-devaluation (c. 1997–1998) wealth of the royal household and the Crown Property Bureau (CPB) range from US$10–20 billion. In August 2008, &quot;Forbes&quot; published its 2008 version of &quot;The World&#x27;s Richest Royals&quot; and King Bhumibol was listed first, with an estimated wealth of US$35 billion. A few days later, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand issued a statement that the &quot;Forbes&quot; report incorrectly conflated the wealth of the CPB and that of Bhumibol. In the 2009 &quot;Forbes&quot; list, the Thai government&#x27;s objections were acknowledged, but &quot;Forbes&quot; justified the continued inclusion of the CPB&#x27;s assets, as the bureau is responsible for handling the Crown&#x27;s property and investments. The 2009 estimate was a reduced figure of US$30 billion due to declines in real estate and stocks, and this figure was also published in April 2014 by &quot;Business Spectator&quot;, which also confirmed that the CPB is the body responsible for the management of the Crown&#x27;s wealth.

The wealth and properties of Bhumibol and the royal family are managed by the Privy Purse. The CPB manages the assets of the Crown as an institution. It was established by law, but is directed without the involvement of the Thai government and reports only to the king. The CPB receives many state privileges. Although the minister of finance presides over the CPB&#x27;s board of directors, final decisions were made solely by Bhumibol. During his lifetime Bhumibol was the only person who could view the CPB&#x27;s annual report, which was not released to the public.

Through the CPB, the Crown owns equity in many companies and massive amounts of land, including 3,320 acres in central Bangkok, as well as 13,200 acres of rural land. The CPB owns 32 percent of Siam Cement (worth US$12.6 billion), 23 percent of Siam Commercial Bank (Thailand&#x27;s largest bank), and interests in Christiani &amp; Nielsen, Deves Insurance, and Shin Corporation.

The CPB also lets or leases about 36,000 properties to third parties, including the sites of the Anantara Siam Bangkok Hotel, the Suan Lum Night Bazaar, Siam Paragon, and the Central World Tower. The CPB spearheaded a plan to turn Bangkok&#x27;s historical Ratchadamnoen Avenue into a shopping street known as the &quot;Champs-Élysées of Asia&quot; and in 2007, shocked longtime residents of traditional marketplace districts by serving them with eviction notices. The Crown&#x27;s substantial income from the CPB, estimated to be at least five billion baht in 2004, is exempt from taxes.

King Bhumibol was the owner of the Golden Jubilee Diamond, the largest faceted diamond in the world, which is estimated to be worth between US$4–12 million in April 2014.

==Criticism==
Although Bhumibol was held in great respect by many Thais, he was also protected by some of the strictest &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; laws in the world. Under these laws, critics could be jailed for three to fifteen years. After the Thammasat University Massacre in 1976, the laws were toughened during the dictatorship of royalist and anti-communist Premier Thanin Kraivichien. Criticism of any member of the royal family, the royal development projects, the royal institution, the Chakri Dynasty or any previous Thai king was also banned.

During his 2005 birthday speech, Bhumibol invited criticism: &quot;Actually, I must also be criticised. I am not afraid if the criticism concerns what I do wrong, because then I know. Because if you say the king cannot be criticised, it means that the king is not human&quot;, he claimed. &quot;If the king can do no wrong, it is akin to looking down upon him because the king is not being treated as a human being. But the king can do wrong.&quot; A widespread barrage of criticisms resulted, followed by a sharp rise in &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; prosecutions. &quot;Lèse-majesté&quot; cases rose from five or six a year pre-2005 to 478 in 2010.

Although &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; officially only applies to current kings, in practice the laws are very broadly construed and flexible. Even after his death, Bhumibol remains protected by &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;.

==Biographies==
American journalist Paul Handley, who spent thirteen years in Thailand, wrote the biography &quot;The King Never Smiles&quot;. The Information and Communications Ministry banned the book and blocked the book&#x27;s page on the Yale University Press website in January 2006. In a statement dated 19 January 2006, Thai National Police Chief General Kowit Wattana said the book had &quot;contents which could affect national security and the good morality of the people&quot;. The book provided a detailed discussion of Bhumibol&#x27;s role in Thai political history, and it also analyzed the factors behind Bhumibol&#x27;s popularity.

William Stevenson, who had access to the royal court and the royal family, wrote the biography &quot;The Revolutionary King&quot; in 2001. An article in &quot;Time&quot; said the idea for the book was suggested by Bhumibol. Critics noted that the book displayed intimate knowledge about personal aspects of Bhumibol. However, the book was unofficially banned in Thailand and the Bureau of the Royal Household warned the Thai media about even referring to it in print. An official ban was not possible as it was written with Bhumibol&#x27;s blessing. The book was criticised for factual inaccuracies, disrespecting Bhumibol (it refers to him by his personal nickname &quot;Lek&quot;), and proposing a controversial theory explaining the mysterious death of King Ananda. Stevenson said: &quot;The king said from the beginning the book would be dangerous for him and for me.&quot;

==Succession to the throne==

Prior to 1972, there was widespread speculation that Bhumibol had been considering his eldest child Ubol Ratana as successor. Ubol Ratana, considered Bhumibol&#x27;s most intelligent and favorite child, disobeyed her parents by marrying Peter Ladd Jensen, her classmate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her parents stripped her of her royal title and banished her from the court; she did not return to Thailand for eight years. After this, Bhumibol&#x27;s only son, Prince Vajiralongkorn, was given the title &quot;Somdej Phra Boroma Orasadhiraj Chao Fah Maha Vajiralongkorn Sayam Makutrajakuman&quot; (Crown Prince of Siam) on 28 December 1972 and made heir apparent () to the throne in accordance with the Palace Law on Succession of 1924.

On 5 December 1977, Princess Sirindhorn was given the title &quot;Siam Boromrajakumari&quot; (Princess Royal of Siam). Her title is often translated by the English-language press as &quot;Crown Princess&quot;, although her official English-language title is simply &quot;Princess&quot;.

Although the constitution was later amended to allow the Privy Council to appoint a princess as successor to the throne, this would only occur in the absence of an heir apparent. This amendment is retained in Section 23 of the 1997 &quot;People&#x27;s Constitution&quot;. This effectively allowed Princess Sirindhorn to potentially be second in line to the throne, but did not affect Prince Vajiralongkorn&#x27;s status as heir apparent.

Recent constitutions of Thailand have made the amendment of the Palace Law of Succession the sole prerogative of the reigning king. According to Assoc. Prof. Gothom Arya, former election commissioner, this allows the reigning king, if he so chooses, to appoint his son or any of his daughters to the throne.

Plaek was a key figures in the 1932 Siamese revolution, which transitioned the country from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy.

Plaek was a member of the army wing of Khana Ratsadon, the first political party in Thailand, and a leader of the Siamese revolution of 1932, which replaced Thailand&#x27;s absolute monarchy with a constitutional monarchy. Plaek became the third Prime Minister of Thailand in 1938 while serving as Commander of the Royal Siamese Army. Inspired by the Italian fascism of Benito Mussolini, he established a &quot;de facto&quot; military dictatorship run along fascist lines, promoted Thai nationalism and Sinophobia, and allied Thailand with Imperial Japan in World War II. Plaek launched a modernization campaign known as the Thai Cultural Revolution that included a series of cultural mandates, which changed the country&#x27;s name from &quot;Siam&quot; to &quot;Thailand&quot;, and promoted the Thai language.

Plaek was ousted as prime minister by the National Assembly in 1944 and replaced by members of the Free Thai Movement, but returned to power after the Siamese coup d&#x27;état of 1947, led by the Coup Group. Plaek aligned Thailand with anti-communism in the Cold War, entered the Korean War under the United Nations Command, and abandoned fascism for a façade of democracy. Phibun&#x27;s second term as prime minister was plagued by political instability and several attempts to launch a coup d&#x27;etat against him were made, including the Army General Staff plot in 1948, the Palace Rebellion in 1949, and the Manhattan Rebellion in 1951. Plaek attempted to transform Thailand into an electoral democracy from the mid-1950s onward, but was overthrown in 1957 and went into exile in Japan, where he died in 1964.

At fifteen years and one month, Plaek&#x27;s term as Prime Minister of Thailand was the longest to date.

== Early years ==
Phibun was born Plaek on 14 July 1897 in Mueang Nonthaburi, Nonthaburi Province, in the Kingdom of Siam to durian farmers. His family began using the surname Khittasangkha () after a 1913 decree on surnames. 

He received his given name – meaning &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;weird&quot; in English – because of his unusual appearance as a child where his ears were positioned below his eyes, rather than above his eyes like others.

Plaek&#x27;s paternal grandfather was a Chinese immigrant from Guangdong of Cantonese descent. However, the family was completely assimilated, being considered Central Thai people, since most of the Chinese in Thailand are from the Teochew dialect group, Plaek did not pass the criteria for being considered Chinese as well, enabling him to successfully conceal and deny his Chinese roots.

He studied in Buddhist temples before joining the Royal Military Academy; upon graduation in 1914, he was commissioned into the Royal Siamese Army as a second lieutenant in the artillery. Following World War I, he was sent to France to study artillery tactics at the École d&#x27;application d&#x27;artillerie. In 1928, as he rose in rank, he received the noble title &quot;Luang&quot; from King Prajadhipok, and became known as Luang Phibunsongkhram. He would later drop his &quot;Luang&quot; title but permanently adopted Phibunsongkhram as his surname.

=== 1932 revolution ===

In 1932, Phibun was one of the leaders of the Royal Siamese Army branch of the People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Khana Ratsadon&quot;), a political organization that staged a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; which overthrew Siam&#x27;s absolute monarchy and replaced it with a constitutional monarchy. Phibun, at the time a lieutenant colonel, quickly rose to prominence in the military as a &quot;man-on-horseback&quot;. The 1932 coup was followed by the nationalization of several companies and increased state control of the economy.

The following year, Phibun and his military allies successfully crushed the Boworadet Rebellion, a royalist revolt led by Prince Boworadet. The new king, Ananda Mahidol, was still a child studying in Switzerland, and the Parliament appointed Colonel Prince Anuwatjaturong, Lieutenant Commander Prince Aditya Dibabha, and Chao Phraya Yommaraj (Pun Sukhum) as his regents.

== Prime Minister of Thailand ==
===First premiership===
On 16 December 1938, Phibun replaced Phraya Phahon as Prime Minister of Thailand and as the Commander of the Royal Siamese Army. Phibun became a &quot;de facto&quot; dictator, and established a military dictatorship, consolidating his position by rewarding several members of his own army clique with influential positions in his government.

After the revolution of 1932, the Thai government of Phraya Phahol was impressed by the success of the March on Rome of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italian fascist movement. Phibun, also an admirer of Italian fascism, sought to replicate fascist-style propaganda tactics, valued in Italy as one of the most powerful propaganda instruments of political power. In Italy, its main purpose was to promote nationalism and militarism, strengthen the unity and harmony of the state, and glorify the policy of ruralisation in Italy and abroad. As a consequence of the fascist leanings of Thai political leaders, Italian propaganda films including newsreels, documentaries, short films, and full-length feature films, such as Istituto Luce Cinecittà, were shown in Thailand during the interwar period. Phibun adopted the fascist salute, modelled on the Roman salute, using it during speeches. The salute was not compulsory in Thailand, and it was opposed by Luang Wichitwathakan and many cabinet members as they believed it inappropriate for Thai culture. Together with Wichitwathakan, the Minister of Propaganda, he built a leadership cult in 1938 and thereafter. Photographs of Phibun were to be found everywhere, and those of the abdicated King Prajadhipok were banned. His quotes appeared in newspapers, were plastered on billboards, and were repeated over the radio.

==== Thai Cultural Revolution ====

Phibun immediately promoted Thai nationalism (to the point of ultranationalism), and to support this policy, he launched a series of major reforms, known as the Thai Cultural Revolution, to increase the pace of modernisation in Thailand. His goal aimed to uplift the national spirit and moral code of the nation and instil progressive tendencies and a newness into Thai life. A series of cultural mandates were issued by the government, which encouraged all Thais to salute the flag in public places, learn the new national anthem and use the standardised Thai language (not regional dialects or languages). People were encouraged to adopt Western-style attire as opposed to traditional clothing styles, and eat with Western-style utensils, such as forks and spoons, rather than with their hands as was customary in Thai culture at the time. Phibun saw these policies as necessary, in the interest of progressivism, to change Thailand&#x27;s international image from that of an undeveloped country into a civilized and modern nation.

Phibun&#x27;s administration encouraged economic nationalism and espoused staunch anti-Teochew sentiment. Sinophobic policies were imposed by the government to reduce the economic power of Siam&#x27;s Teochew-Hoklo population and encouraged the Central Thai people to purchase as many Thai products as possible. In a speech in 1938, Luang Wichitwathakan, himself of one-quarter Chinese ancestry, followed Rama VI&#x27;s book &quot;Jews of the East&quot; in comparing the Teochew in Siam to the Jews in Germany, who at the time were harshly repressed.

On 24 June 1939, Phibun changed the country&#x27;s official English name from &quot;Siam&quot; to &quot;Thailand&quot; at Wichitwathakan&#x27;s urging. The name &quot;Siam&quot; was an exonym of unknown and probably foreign origin, which conflicted with Phibun&#x27;s nationalist policies. 

In 1941, in the midst of World War II, Phibun decreed 1 January as the official start of the new year instead of the traditional &quot;Songkran&quot; date on 13 April.

====Franco-Thai War====

Phibun exploited the Fall of France in June 1940 and the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in September 1940 to advance Thai interests in French Indochina following a border dispute with France. Phibun believed Thailand could recover territories ceded to France by King Rama V because the French would avoid armed confrontation or offer serious resistance. Thailand fought against Vichy France over the disputed areas from October 1940 to May 1941. The technologically and numerically superior Thai force invaded French Indochina and attacked military targets in major cities. Despite Thai successes, the French tactical victory at the Battle of Ko Chang prompted intervention from the Japanese, who mediated an armistice where the French were forced to cede the disputed territories to Thailand.

==== Alliance with Japan ====

Phibun and the Thai public viewed the outcome of the Franco-Thai War as a victory, but it resulted in the rapidly expanding Japanese gaining the right to occupy French Indochina. Although Phibun was ardently pro-Japanese, he now shared a border with them and felt threatened by a potential Japanese invasion. Phibun&#x27;s administration also realised that Thailand would have to fend for itself if a Japanese invasion came, considering its deteriorating relationships with Western powers in the area.

When the Japanese invaded Thailand on 8 December 1941, (because of the International Date Line this occurred an hour and a half before the attack on Pearl Harbor), Phibun was reluctantly forced to order a general ceasefire after just one day of resistance and allow the Japanese armies to use the country as a base for their invasions of the British colonies of Burma and Malaya. Hesitancy, however, gave way to enthusiasm after the Japanese rolled through the Malayan Campaign in a &quot;Bicycle Blitzkrieg&quot; with surprisingly little resistance. On 21 December Phibun signed a military alliance with Japan. The following month, on 25 January 1942, Phibun declared war on Britain and the United States. South Africa and New Zealand declared war on Thailand on the same day. Australia followed soon after. Phibun purged all who opposed the Japanese alliance from his government. Pridi Banomyong was appointed acting regent for the absent King Ananda Mahidol, while Direk Jayanama, the prominent foreign minister who had advocated continued resistance against the Japanese, was later sent to Tokyo as an ambassador. The United States considered Thailand to be a puppet state of Japan and refused to declare war on it. When the Allies were victorious, the United States blocked British efforts to impose a punitive peace.

====Removal====
In 1944, as the Japanese neared defeat and the underground anti-Japanese Free Thai Movement steadily grew in strength, the National Assembly ousted Phibun as prime minister and his six-year reign as the military commander-in-chief came to an end. Phibun&#x27;s resignation was partly forced by two grandiose plans: one was to relocate the capital from Bangkok to a remote site in the jungle near Phetchabun in north central Thailand, and another was to build a &quot;Buddhist city&quot; in Saraburi. Announced at a time of severe economic difficulty, these ideas turned many government officers against him. After his resignation, Phibun went to stay at the army headquarters in Lopburi.

Khuang Aphaiwong replaced Phibun as prime minister, ostensibly to continue relations with the Japanese, but, in reality, to secretly assist the Free Thai Movement. At the war&#x27;s end, Phibun was put on trial at Allied insistence on charges of having committed war crimes, mainly that of collaborating with the Axis powers. However, he was acquitted amid intense pressure as public opinion was still favourable to him, as he was thought to have done his best to protect Thai interests. Phibun&#x27;s alliance with Japan had Thailand take advantage of Japanese support to expand Thai territory into Malaya and Burma.

===Second premiership===


In November 1947, Royal Thai Army units under the control of Phibun known as the Coup Group carried out the 1947 Thai coup d&#x27;état which forced then-Prime Minister Thawan Thamrongnawasawat to resign. The rebels installed Khuang Aphaiwong again as prime minister as the military coup risked international disapproval. Pridi Phanomyong was persecuted but was aided by British and US intelligence officers, and thus managed to escape the country. On 8 April 1948, Phibun assumed the position of Prime Minister after the military forced Khuang out of office.

Phibun&#x27;s second premiership was notably different, abandoning the fascist styling and rhetoric that characterised his first premiership, and instead promoted a façade of democracy. The beginning of the Cold War saw Phibun align Thailand with the anti-communist camp.

Phibun supported UN action in the Korean War and dispatched an expeditionary force of 4,000 troops. and received large quantities of US aid following Thailand&#x27;s entry into the Korean War as part of the United Nations Command&#x27;s multi-national allied force against the communist forces of North Korea and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Phibun&#x27;s anti-Chinese campaign was resumed, with the government restricting Chinese immigration and undertaking various measures to restrict economic domination of the Thai market by those of Chinese descent. Chinese schools and associations were once again shut down. Despite open pro-Western and anti-Chinese policies, in the late 1950s Phibun arranged to send two of the children of Sang Phathanothai, his closest advisor, to China with the intention of establishing a backdoor channel for dialogue between China and Thailand. Sirin Phathanothai, aged eight, and her brother, aged twelve, were sent to be brought up under the assistants of Premier Zhou Enlai as his wards. Sirin later wrote &quot;The Dragon&#x27;s Pearl&quot;, an autobiography telling her experiences growing up in the 1950s and 1960s among the leaders of China.

Phibun was reportedly thrilled by the democracy and freedom of speech he had witnessed during a long trip abroad to the United States and Europe in 1955. Following the example of Hyde Park in London, he set up a &quot;Speakers&#x27; Corner&quot; at the Sanam Luang in Bangkok. Phibun began to democratize Thailand by allowing the formation of new political parties, amnestied political opponents, and planned free elections. Phibun founded and became chairman of his own new political party, the Seri Manangkhasila Party, which was dominated by the most influential in the military and the government. The Employment Act of January 1957 legalized trade unions, limited weekly working hours, regulated holidays and overtime, and instituted health and safety regulations. The International Workers&#x27; Day became a public holiday.

====Power play====
Phibun&#x27;s second premiership was longer but plagued with political instability, and there were numerous attempts to oppose his rule and remove him from power. Unlike his first premiership, Phibun faced noticeable opposition from people connected to the Free Thai Movement due to his alliance with the Japanese, including from within the military. Additionally, Phibun was indebted to the powerful Coup Group that had returned him to power.

On 1 October 1948, the unsuccessful Army General Staff Plot was launched by members of the army general staff to topple his government, but failed when discovered by the Coup Group. As a result, more than fifty army and reserve officers and several prominent supporters of Pridi Phanomyong were arrested.

On 26 February 1949, the Palace Rebellion was another failed coup attempt against Phibun to restore Pridi Phanomyong by occupying the Grand Palace in Bangkok and declaring a new government led by Direk Jayanama, a close associate of Pridi. The civilian rebels were quickly ousted from the palace, but fighting broke out between military rebels and loyalists which lasted for over a week.

On 29 June 1951, Phibun was attending a ceremony aboard the &quot;Manhattan&quot;, a US dredge boat, when he was taken hostage by a group of Royal Thai Navy officers, who then quickly confined him aboard the warship &quot;Sri Ayutthaya&quot;. Negotiations between the government and the coup organizers swiftly broke down, leading to violent street fighting in Bangkok between the navy and the army, which was supported by the Royal Thai Air Force. Phibun was able to escape and swim back to shore when the &quot;Sri Ayutthaya&quot; was bombed by the air force, and with their hostage gone, the navy were forced to lay down their arms.

On 29 November 1951, the Silent Coup was staged by the Coup Group and it consolidated the military&#x27;s hold on the country. It reinstated the Constitution of 1932, which effectively eliminated the Senate, established a unicameral legislature composed equally of elected and government-appointed members, and allowed serving military officers to supplement their commands with important ministerial portfolios.

In 1954 Phibun allied Thailand further with the West in the Cold War by helping establish SEATO.

In 1956, it became clearer that Plaek, allied to Phao, was losing to another influential group led by Sarit which consisted of &quot;Sakdina&quot; (royalties and royalists). Both Plaek and Phao intended to bring home Pridi Banomyong to clear his name from the mystery around the death of King Rama VIII. However, the US government disapproved, and they cancelled the plan.

===1957 coup and exile===
In February 1957, public opinion turned against Phibun at the end of his second term when his party was suspected of fraudulent practices during an election, including the intimidation of the opposition, buying votes, and electoral fraud. In addition, critics of Phibun accused him of a lack of respect for the Thai monarchy, as the anti-aristocratic prime minister had always sought to limit the role of the monarchy to a constitutional minimum and had taken on religious functions that traditionally belonged to the monarch. For example, Phibun led the celebrations of the 2500th anniversary of Buddhism in 1956/57 instead of the King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who was openly critical of Phibun. On 16 September 1957, Phibun was eventually overthrown in a coup d&#x27;etat by members of the Royal Thai Army under the command of Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, who had earlier sworn to be Phibun&#x27;s most loyal subordinate. Sarit was supported by many royalists who wanted to regain a foothold, and there were rumours that the United States was &quot;deeply involved&quot; in the coup.

Phibun was then forced into exile after the coup, first fleeing to Cambodia, but later settled in Japan after Sarit&#x27;s new regime rejected his requests to allow him to return to Thailand. In 1960, Phibun briefly travelled to India to be a monk in the Buddhist temple in Bodhgaya. 

==Death==
Phibun died on 11 June 1964 from heart failure in Tokyo, Japan.

After his death, Phibun&#x27;s ashes were transferred to Thailand in an urn and decorated with military honours in Wat Phra Sri Mahathat (also called &quot;The Temple of Democracy&quot;) he had founded in Bang Khen.

<text>Bob the Angry Flower is a webcomic by Stephen Notley, published weekly starting in 1992. It tells the exploits of an easily angered anthropomorphic flower named Bob and his interactions with the world, often in search of either global domination or love. Though the comic strip features a range of recurring characters, most strips stand alone with little or no continuity.

==Characters and style==
Bob has an intense hatred of the incorrect use of the apostrophe to form plurals, and is also often found in outlandish but self-inflicted predicaments. The strips themselves range from absurdist humor to dadaist &quot;anti-humor&quot;.

Bob&#x27;s two sidekicks are &quot;Stumpy&quot; (a talking tree stump) and &quot;Freddie the Flying Fetus&quot;. While Stumpy&#x27;s appearance and demeanour epitomise existential &quot;&quot;, Freddie – as befits his tender years – is a vital and innocent spirit, insuppressibly enthusiastic and trusting; the pair provide two different counterpoints to the single-minded irascibility of the protagonist.
Other recurring minor characters include robots (and their natural enemies, bears), ninjas, Daleks (from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;) and various evil masterminds. Dick Cheney, Kofi Annan, and other world leaders have also appeared as characters on occasion.

==Background==

&quot;Bob the Angry Flower&quot; is the creation of Canadian cartoonist Stephen Notley, a native of Edmonton, who has been based in Seattle since early 2005. The cartoon has been carried, at different times, by several local newspapers and magazines including &quot;See&quot; magazine, &quot;Vue Weekly&quot;, the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot;, and &quot;The Gateway.&quot; Notley also generally posts new strips to his website every Friday.

&quot;Bob the Angry Flower&quot; has had one spin-off series, &quot;Lovebot Conquers All&quot;, featuring Lovebot, a robot built by Bob and then abandoned, and who reappears occasionally in the strip to bring readers up to date on his fruitless quest for love. It appeared in black and white as a bonus feature in the collection &quot;Bob the Angry Flower: The Ultimate Book of Perfect Energy&quot;, and ran in color on the subscription site Graphic Smash.

There are currently eleven books published, mostly consisting of compiled cartoons from the weekly series, with a few extra features. They are:
* &quot;In Defence of Fascism&quot; (1997) ()
* &quot;Coffee with Sinistar&quot; (1999) ()
* &quot;Everybody vs. Bob the Angry Flower&quot; (2001) ()
* &quot;Bob the Angry Flower: The Ultimate Book of Perfect Energy!!!&quot; (2003) ()
* &quot;Dog Killer&quot; (2005) ()
* &quot;Pamplemousse&quot; (2008) ()
* &quot;Rothgar&quot; (2010) ()
* &quot;How to Operate a Chair&quot; (2012) ()
* &quot;The Unthinkable&quot; (2015) ()
* &quot;X&quot; (2017) ()
* &quot;exciting space adventure&quot; (2019) ()

Notley is the son of politician Grant Notley, a former leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party, and the brother of Rachel Notley, the current leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party and former Premier of Alberta.

==Reception==

&quot;Bob the Angry Flower&quot; was referenced by science fiction writer Michael Swanwick in a September 2002 short story about an encounter with Notley. Swanwick writes, &quot;Bob the Angry Flower experiences all emotions at exaggerated levels. He builds giant killer robots, he deploys world-destroying lasers. He&#x27;s sort of like your id with an unlimited budget. The cartoons involve irrational and surreal menaces that are resolved, usually, through abrupt changes of mood and subject.&quot;

==Licensing==
Notley has released his &quot;Bob the Angry Flower&quot; work under an original license. The license only enables sale of T-shirts with &quot;Bob the Angry Flower&quot; material from CafePress stores, and also requires that the image is sent to Notley, and by implication the link of the relevant CafePress store.&lt;ref name=&#x27;angryflower.com/t-shirts&#x27;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, &quot;Bob the Angry Flower&quot; was released as a collection by Tachyon Publications.

<doc id="203774" wikidata="Q78514" url="?curid=203774" title="Franz Werfel">
<text>Franz Viktor Werfel (; 10 September 1890 – 26 August 1945) was an Austrian-Bohemian novelist, playwright, and poet whose career spanned World War I, the Interwar period, and World War II. He is primarily known as the author of &quot;The Forty Days of Musa Dagh&quot; (1933, English tr. 1934, 2012), a novel based on events that took place during the Armenian genocide of 1915, and &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1941), a novel about the life and visions of the French Catholic saint Bernadette Soubirous, which was made into a Hollywood film of the same name.

== Early life ==
Born in Prague (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), now the capital of the Czech Republic, Werfel was the first of three children of a wealthy manufacturer of gloves and leather goods, Rudolf Werfel. His mother, Albine Kussi, was the daughter of a mill owner. His two sisters were Hanna (born 1896) and Marianne Amalie (born 1899). His family was Jewish. As a child, Werfel was raised by his Czech Catholic governess, Barbara Šimůnková, who often took him to mass in Prague&#x27;s main cathedral. Like the children of other progressive German-speaking Jews in Prague, Werfel was educated at a Catholic school run by the Piarists, a teaching order that allowed for a rabbi to instruct Jewish students for their Bar Mitzvahs. This, along with his governess&#x27;s influence, gave Werfel an early interest (and expertise) in Catholicism, which soon branched out to other faiths, including Theosophy and Islam, such that his fiction, as well as his nonfiction, provides some insight into comparative religion.

== Career ==
Werfel began writing at an early age and, by 1911, had published his first book of poems, &quot;Der Weltfreund&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;the friend to the world&quot; as well as philanthropist, humanitarian, and the like. By this time, Werfel had befriended other German Jewish writers who frequented Prague&#x27;s , chief among them Max Brod and Franz Kafka, and his poetry was praised by such critics as Karl Kraus, who published Werfel&#x27;s early poems in Kraus&#x27;s journal, &quot;Die Fackel&quot; (The Torch). In 1912, Werfel moved to Leipzig, where he became an editor for Kurt Wolff&#x27;s new publishing firm, where Werfel championed and edited Georg Trakl&#x27;s first book of poetry. While he lived in Germany, Werfel&#x27;s milieu grew to include Else Lasker-Schüler, Martin Buber, Rainer Maria Rilke, among other German-language writers, poets, and intellectuals in the first decades of the twentieth century.

With the outbreak of World War I, Werfel served in the Austro-Hungarian Army on the Russian front as a telephone operator. His duties both exposed him to the vicissitudes of total war as well as provided him with enough of a haven to continue writing Expressionist poems, ambitious plays, and letters voluminously. His eclectic mix of humanism, confessionalism, autobiography, as well as mythology and religiosity developed further during this time. His poems and plays ranged from scenes of ancient Egypt (notably the potentially monotheistic religion of Akhenaton) to occult allusions (Werfel had participated in séances with his friends Brod and Kafka) and incorporate a parable from the Baháʼí Faith in the poem &quot;Jesus and the Carrion Path&quot;. His bias for Christian subjects, as well as his antipathy for Zionism, eventually alienated many of his Jewish friends and readers, including early champions such as Karl Kraus. Others, however, stood by him, including Martin Buber, who published a sequence of poems from Werfel&#x27;s wartime manuscript, &quot;Der Gerichtstag&quot; (Judgment Day, published in 1919) in his monthly journal, &quot;Der Jude&quot; (&quot;The Jew&quot;). and wrote of Werfel in his prefatory remark:

Since I was first moved by his poems, I have opened (knowing well, I should say, it&#x27;s a problem) the gates of my invisible garden [i.e., an imaginarium] to him, and now he can do nothing for all eternity that would bring me to banish him from it. Compare, if you will, a real person to an anecdotal one, a late book to an earlier, the one you see to you yourself; but I am not putting a value on a poet, only recognizing that he is one—and the way he is one.

In the summer of 1917, Werfel left the frontline for the Military Press Bureau in Vienna, where he joined other notable Austrian writers serving as propagandists, among them Robert Musil, Rilke, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, and Franz Blei. Through the latter, Werfel met and fell in love with Alma Mahler, widow of Gustav Mahler, the former lover of the painter Oskar Kokoschka, and the wife of the architect Walter Gropius, then serving in the Imperial German Army on the Western Front. Alma, who was also a composer, had already set one of Werfel&#x27;s poems to music, despite Werfel&#x27;s being much younger, shorter, and having Jewish features that she, being both anti-Semitic and attracted to Jewish men, initially found distasteful. Their love affair culminated in the premature birth of a son, Martin, in August 1918. Martin, who was given the surname of Gropius, died in May of the following year. Despite attempts to save his marriage to Alma, with whom he had a young daughter, Manon, Gropius reluctantly agreed to a divorce in 1920. Ironically, Alma refused to marry Werfel for the next nine years. However, Alma, more so than with her first two husbands and lovers, lent herself to the development of Werfel&#x27;s career and influenced it in such a way that he became an accomplished playwright and novelist as well as poet. They married on 6 July 1929.
In April 1924, &quot;Verdi – Roman der Oper&quot; (Novel of the Opera) was published by Zsolnay Verlag, establishing Werfel&#x27;s reputation as a novelist. In 1926, Werfel was awarded the Grillparzer Prize by the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and in Berlin, Max Reinhardt performed his play &quot;Juarez and Maximilian&quot; (depicting the struggle in 1860&#x27;s Mexico between the Republican leader Benito Juárez and the French-backed Emperor Maximilian). By the end of the decade, Werfel had become one of the most important and established writers in German and Austrian literature and had already merited one full-length critical biography.

Werfel&#x27;s journey (with his wife Alma) in 1930, to British-ruled Palestine, and his encounter with the Armenian refugee community in Jerusalem, inspired his novel &quot;The Forty Days of Musa Dagh&quot; which drew world attention to the Armenian genocide by the Ottoman government. Werfel lectured on this subject across Germany. The Nazi newspaper &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot; denounced him as a propagandist of &quot;alleged Turkish horrors perpetrated against the Armenians&quot;. The same newspaper, suggesting a link between the Armenian and the later Jewish genocide, condemned &quot;America&#x27;s Armenian Jews for promoting in the U.S.A. the sale of Werfel&#x27;s book&quot;.

Werfel was forced to leave the Prussian Academy of Arts in 1933. His books were burned by the Nazis. Werfel left Austria after the Anschluss in 1938 and went to France, where they lived in a fishing village near Marseille. Visitors to their home at this time included Bertolt Brecht and Thomas Mann. After the German invasion and occupation of France during World War II, and the deportation of French Jews to the Nazi concentration camps, Werfel had to flee again. With the assistance of Varian Fry and the Emergency Rescue Committee in Marseille, he and his wife narrowly escaped the Nazi regime, finding shelter for five weeks in the pilgrimage town of Lourdes. He also received much help and kindness from the Catholic orders that staffed the shrine. He vowed to write about the experience and, safe in the United States, he published &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; in 1941.

Fry and Unitarian Waitstill Sharp organized a secret crossing over the Pyrenees on foot. Assisted by Justus Rosenberg, they went to Madrid and then traveled on to Portugal. They stayed in Monte Estoril, at the Grande Hotel D&#x27;Itália, between 8 September and 4 October 1940. On the same day they checked out, they boarded the &quot;S.S. Nea Hellas&quot; headed for New York City, arriving on 13 October.

Werfel and his family settled in Los Angeles, where they met other German and Austrian emigrants, such as Mann, Reinhardt, and Erich Wolfgang Korngold as well as Czech (as Werfel was Czechoslovak citizen). In southern California, Werfel wrote his final play, &quot;Jacobowsky and the Colonel&quot; (&quot;Jacobowsky und der Oberst&quot;) which was made into the 1958 film &quot;Me and the Colonel&quot; starring Danny Kaye; Giselher Klebe&#x27;s opera &quot;Jacobowsky und der Oberst&quot; (1965) is also based on this play. Before his death, he completed the first draft of his last novel &quot;Star of the Unborn&quot; (&quot;Stern der Ungeborenen&quot;), which was published posthumously in 1946.

== Death ==

Franz Werfel died of heart failure in Los Angeles in 1945 and was interred there in the Rosedale Cemetery. However, his body was returned in 1975 to Vienna for reburial in the Zentralfriedhof.

<text>Burning Man is a week-long large-scale desert event focused on &quot;community, art, self-expression, and self-reliance&quot; held annually in the western United States. The event&#x27;s name comes from its culminating ceremony: the symbolic burning of a large wooden effigy, referred to as the Man, that occurs on the penultimate night, the Saturday evening before Labor Day. Since 1990, the event has been at Black Rock City in northwestern Nevada, a temporary city erected in the Black Rock Desert about north-northeast of Reno. According to Burning Man co-founder Larry Harvey in 2004, the event is guided by ten stated principles: radical inclusion, gifting, decommodification, radical self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, leaving no trace, participation, and immediacy.

Burning Man features no headliners or scheduled performers; participants create all the art, activities, and events. Artwork includes experimental and interactive sculptures, buildings, performances, and art cars, among other media. These contributions are inspired by a theme chosen annually by the Burning Man Project. The event has been called &quot;countercultural revelry&quot; and described by its organizers as an &quot;excuse to party in the desert&quot;. However, NPR said of Burning Man in 2019, &quot;Once considered an underground gathering for bohemians and free spirits of all stripes, Burning Man has since evolved into a destination for social media influencers, celebrities and the Silicon Valley elite.&quot;
Burning Man originated on June 22, 1986, on Baker Beach in San Francisco as a small function organized by Larry Harvey and Jerry James, the builders of the first Man. It has since been held annually, spanning the nine days leading up to and including Labor Day. Over the event&#x27;s history, attendance has generally increased. In 2019, 78,850 people participated.

Burning Man is organized by the Burning Man Project, a nonprofit organization that, in 2013, succeeded Black Rock City LLC, a for-profit limited liability company. Black Rock City LLC was formed in 1999 to represent the event&#x27;s organizers and is now considered a subsidiary of the nonprofit organization. The Burning Man Project endorses multiple smaller regional events guided by the Burning Man principles in the United States and internationally.

The film &quot;Stalker&quot; by Tarkovsky heavily influenced the Cacophony Society, which began in 1986 in the San Francisco Bay Area and which organized &quot;Zone Trips&quot; for participants.

The first burning of a wooden, symbolic man at Black Rock Desert, Nevada, occurred on &quot;Zone Trip Number 4&quot; in 1990. This occasion evolved into an enormous annual festival of arts, music, and culture called Burning Man.

== History ==

=== 1980s ===

Burning Man began as a bonfire ritual on the summer solstice. Sculptor Mary Grauberger, a friend of Larry Harvey&#x27;s girlfriend, Janet Lohr, held solstice bonfire gatherings on Baker Beach for several years before 1986, some of which Harvey attended. When Grauberger stopped organizing it, Harvey &quot;picked up the torch&quot;, with Grauberger&#x27;s permission, and ran with it. He and Jerry James built the first wooden effigy on June 21, 1986, cobbled together using scrap wood, to be torched that evening. On June 22, Harvey, James, and a few friends met on Baker Beach in San Francisco and burned an wooden man and a smaller wooden dog. Harvey later described his inspiration for burning these effigies as a spontaneous act of &quot;radical self-expression&quot;. In 1987, the Man grew to tall, and by 1988, it had grown to .

By 1988, Harvey formally named the summer solstice ritual &quot;Burning Man&quot; by titling flyers for the happening as such. This was done to ward off references to &quot;wicker man&quot;, the reputed Celtic pagan practice of burning live sacrifices in human-shaped wicker cages. Harvey has said that he had not seen the 1973 cult film&quot; The Wicker Man&quot; until many years after and that it did not inspire the action.

=== 1990 to 1996 ===

In 1990, a separate event was planned by Kevin Evans and John Law on the remote and largely unknown &quot;playa&quot;, known as the Black Rock Desert, about north of Reno, Nevada. Evans conceived it as a dadaist temporary autonomous zone with sculptures to be burned and situationist performance art. He asked John Law, who also had experience on the dry lake and was a defining founder of the Cacophony Society, to take on central organizing functions of the events. In the Cacophony Society&#x27;s newsletter, it was announced as Zone Trip No. 4, A Bad Day at Black Rock (inspired by the 1955 film of the same name).

Meanwhile, the solstice burn at Baker Beach was interrupted by the park police for not having a permit. After striking a deal to raise the Man but not to burn it, event organizers disassembled it and returned it to the vacant lot where it had been built. Shortly thereafter, the legs and torso of the Man were chain-sawed, and the pieces were removed when the space was unexpectedly leased as a parking lot. The Man was reconstructed, led by Dan Miller, Harvey&#x27;s then-housemate of many years, just in time to take it to Zone Trip No. 4.

Michael Mikel, another active Cacophonist, realized that participants unfamiliar with the environment of the dry lake would benefit from knowledgeable persons helping to ensure they did not get lost in the deep dry lake and risk dehydration and death. He took the name Danger Ranger and created the Black Rock Rangers to assist them. Thus, Black Rock City began as a fellowship organized by Law and Mikel, based on Evans&#x27;s and Grauberger&#x27;s ideas and Harvey&#x27;s and James&#x27;s symbolic man. Drawing on experience in the sign business and with light sculpture, Law prepared custom neon tubes for the Man starting in 1991 so it could be seen as a beacon to aid navigation at night long before there were any planned roads.

In its early years, the community grew by word of mouth alone, and all were considered (and generally not invited until they could be expected to be) participants in their contribution to the cacophonous situationist vibe. There were no paid or scheduled performers or artists, no separation between art and life nor art space and living space, no rules other than &quot;Don&#x27;t interfere with anyone else&#x27;s immediate experience&quot; and &quot;no guns in central camp&quot;.

1991 marked the first year that the event had a legal permit through the BLM (the Bureau of Land Management). It was also the year that art model and fire dancer (and later Burning Man&#x27;s first art director) &quot;Crimson Rose&quot; attended the event. 1992 saw the birth of a smaller, intensive, nearby event named &quot;Desert Siteworks&quot;, conceived and directed by William Binzen and co-produced (in 1993 and &#x27;94) with Judy West. There were about 20 participants the first year, and approximately 100 in the second and third year. The annual, several weeks-long event, was held over summer Solstice at various fertile hot springs surrounding the desert. Participants built art and participated in self-directed performances.

Some key organizers of Burning Man were also part of Desert Siteworks (Law, Mikel) and Binzen was a friend of Harvey. Hence, the two events saw much cross-pollination of ideas and participants. The Desert Siteworks project ran for three years (1992–1994). 1996 was the first year a formal partnership was created to own the name &quot;Burning Man&quot; and was also the last year the event was held in the middle of the Black Rock Desert with no fence around it.

Before the event opened to the public in 1996, a worker named Michael Furey was killed in a motorcycle crash while riding from Gerlach, Nevada, to the Burning Man camp in the Black Rock Desert. Harvey insisted that the death had not occurred at Burning Man, since the gates were not yet open. Another couple were run over in their tent by an art car driving to the &quot;rave camp&quot;, which was at that time distant from the main camp. After the 1996 event, Law broke with Burning Man and publicly said the event should not continue.

=== 1997 to 2013 ===
1997 marked another major pivotal year for the event. It had to be moved because the permit for Black Rock was denied for the 1997 event. A team conducting land speed trials had a conflicting permit that took precedence. Fly Ranch, with the smaller adjoining Hualapai dry lakebed, just west of the Black Rock desert, was chosen as the alternate location. This moved Burning Man from Pershing County/federal BLM land into the jurisdiction of Washoe County, which brought a protracted list of permit requirements.

In 1999 to comply with the new requirements and manage the increased liability load, Harvey and five organizers formed Black Rock City LLC with the assistance of &quot;Biz Babe&quot; Dana Harrison. The LLC founders consisted of Larry Harvey (chief philosophy officer), Harley K. DuBois (chief transition officer), Marian Goodell (CEO), Crimson Rose (art transition officer), Will Roger Peterson (Nevada relations director), and Michael Mikel (historian and archivist).

Will Roger Peterson and Flynn Mauthe created the Black Rock City Department of Public Works (DPW) to build the &quot;city&quot; grid layout (a requirement so that emergency vehicles could be directed to an &quot;address&quot;), designed by Rod Garrett, an architect. Garrett continued as the city designer until his death in 2011, at age 76. He is also credited with the design of all of the Man bases from 2001 through 2012, the center camp café and first camp. 1998 saw a return to the Black Rock desert, although not to the deep playa, along with a temporary perimeter fence. The event has remained there since.

As the population of Black Rock City grew, the BLM added more restrictions, and changes were made in how people were invited to the event, notably the addition of publicized online ticket sales to all comers; further rules were established concerning its survival. Some critics of the later phase of the event cite these rules as impinging on the original freedoms and principles, diminishing the scope of the experience unacceptably, while many newer attendees find the increased level of activity more than balances out the changes:
* A grid street structure.
* A speed limit of .
* A ban on driving, except for approved &quot;mutant vehicles&quot; and service vehicles.
* Safety standards on mutant vehicles.
* Burning of any art must be done on an approved burn platform.
* A ban on fireworks.
* A ban on animals.

Another notable restriction to attendees is the 9.2-mile- (14.8 km) long temporary plastic fence that surrounds the event and defines the pentagon of land used by the event on the southern edge of the Black Rock dry lake. This 4-foot- (1.2-meter) high barrier is known as the &quot;trash fence&quot; because its initial use was to catch wind-blown debris that might escape from campsites during the event. Since 2002, the area beyond this fence has not been accessible to Burning Man participants during the event.

One visitor who was accidentally burned at the 2005 event unsuccessfully sued Black Rock City LLC in San Francisco County Superior Court. On June 30, 2009, the California Court of Appeal for the First District upheld the trial court&#x27;s grant of summary judgment to Black Rock City LLC on the basis that people who deliberately walk toward The Man after it is ignited assume the risk of getting burned by such a hazardous object.

=== 2013 to 2019 ===

In December 2013, following negotiations between founders, Black Rock City LLC was made a subsidiary of a new nonprofit entity known as the Burning Man Project.

On September 3, 2017, a 41-year-old man, Aaron Joel Mitchell, fought his way past a safety cordon of volunteers and firefighters and threw himself into the flames of the Man. Mitchell died the next day due to cardiac arrest, bodily shock, and third-degree burns to 97% of his body. His death was ruled a suicide.

=== 2020 to 2021 ===
On April 10, 2020, the Burning Man Project announced that Burning Man was canceled for 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making 2020 the first year Burning Man did not happen since its inception. They then decided to offer ticket refunds despite the tickets being sold explicitly as non-refundable.

On September 7, 2020, an estimated 1,000 Burners celebrated on San Francisco&#x27;s Ocean Beach. San Francisco Mayor London Breed tweeted about the event, &quot;This was reckless and selfish. You aren&#x27;t celebrating, but are putting people&#x27;s lives and our progress at risk. No one is immune from spreading the virus.&quot; Several thousand also showed up in the Black Rock desert for an unofficial event and some described it as a return to the &quot;old days&quot;.

The 2021 event was canceled on April 27, 2021, due to the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite progress on vaccination, organizers said that &quot;uncertainties that need to be resolved are impossible to resolve in the time we have&quot;. On May 14, 2021, the Burning Man Project released tickets on their website for online events slated between August 22 and September 7, 2021.

The unofficial event was more extensive than in 2020, with an estimated 20,000 attending. Various groups loosely coordinated it, including Black Rock Plan B and Rogue Burn. The Bureau of Land Management implemented restrictions including no structures other than shade structures and no fires other than campfires. There was a massive illuminated drone display outlining the Man instead of the burning of a Man effigy.

=== 2023 ===

The 2023 Burning Man had rains and subsequent flooding on Labor Day weekend, with a lockdown preventing vehicle movement throughout the site. Organizers arranged for some cellular service and shared a 2023 Wet Playa Survival Guide: &quot;no driving is permitted until the playa surface dries up, with the exception of emergency services… Participants are encouraged to conserve food, water, and fuel, and shelter in a warm, safe space&quot; and told attendees about Burning Man Information Radio (BMIR) 94.5 FM and Gate Information Radio Station (GARS) 95.1. One person died following the flooding, with thousands more stranded.

=== 2024 ===
On August 25, 2024, the first day of the 2024 Burning Man festival, a female participant died. On August 26, it was reported that tickets remained unsold for the festival for the first time since 2011.

An epic dust storm was reported on the final day of the event, snarling departure traffic and causing lines to last more than four hours.

The Burning Man Project is currently engaged in a fundraising campaign that began in October 2024. The campaign aims to collect $20 million. On December 19, 2024, CEO Marian Goodell emailed supporters that the project still requires $14 million to meet its financial goal for the 2025 festival.

== Event timeline ==
The statistics below illustrate the growth in both the scale and scope of Burning Man in terms of location, height of the central Man sculpture, population, ticket price, and several registered camps and art.

After starting at and growing taller each of the next three years, the height of the titular Man remained at between 1989 and 2013. During those years, changes in the size and form of the base on which the wooden Man stood accounted for the differing heights of the overall structures. In 2014 the construction of the Man changed to a tall figure standing directly on the ground with no base. From 2015 to 2019 the Man returned to in height.
=== Population counts ===
The population count is a stipulation of the Special Recreation Permit (SRP) granted to the Burning Man Project, formerly Black Rock City, LLC (BRC), by the BLM, for the event each year. Originally used to calculate fees, it&#x27;s now used to ensure that the event does not exceed the maximum authorized population as specified in the SRP. Not everyone at the event is included in the population count. Exempted from the count are government personnel and government contractors; however, this has changed over time.

The population count was originally used to calculate fees owed to the BLM. It was not long until the BLM began considering putting a limit on the number of people that would be allowed to attend the event. This became a point of contention as early as 1998 when the BLM proposed a complicated usage formula, effectively limiting the size of the event to that of the previous year.

Starting in 2006, the SRP stipulated that BRC manage &quot;ticket sales in a manner to keep the maximum population of the event from increasing more than 6% above the highest population recorded in a previous year.&quot; Fees were based on the daily population counts of Black Rock City at noon. This was the first year where fees were explicitly exempted for BRC staff..

In 2011, the fee structure changed to be based on adjusted gross income and was no longer tied to daily population counts.

The 2012 SRP further defined who was to be counted in population counts. The term &quot;participant&quot; was introduced, as defined in that year&#x27;s Environmental Assessment (EA), to include &quot;all attendees of the event, including paid participants and volunteers. The population does not include government personnel, Humboldt General Hospital emergency service providers, vendors and contractors.&quot; The maximum authorized population now applied to &quot;participants&quot;.

In 2014, volunteers were explicitly exempted from the population count and the population cap was further refined to now apply to &quot;paid participants&quot;.

In 2019, the definition of &quot;population&quot; changed again, this time to include BRC staff and volunteers, now collectively referred to as &quot;attendees&quot;. This coincided with the necessity of a new Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the 2019–2028 SRP application which introduced this change in definition.
The Burning Man Project reported a population of 78,850 for that year, an increase of about 8,600 people from the previous year, noting that &quot;everyone&quot; was now being counted in the maximum population count. This roughly correlates with the Burning Man Project&#x27;s 2019 Form 990 disclosure which states it employs 986 people and has 10,000 volunteers.

In 2022, an additional restriction on the total number of attendees for the entirety of the event was introduced. &quot;The cumulative maximum authorized population for the 2022 event is 87,000 total attendees.&quot; The maximum number of attendees on the playa at any one time remained as it was in 2019 at 80,000.

== Principles ==

Because of the variety of goals fostered by participatory attendees, known as &quot;Burners,&quot; Burning Man does not have a single focus. Features of the event are subject to the participants and include &quot;community&quot;, &quot;artwork&quot;, &quot;absurdity&quot;, &quot;decommodification&quot; and &quot;revelry&quot;. Participation is encouraged.

The Burning Man event and its affiliated communities are guided by 10 principles meant to evoke the cultural ethos that has emerged from the event. They were originally written by Larry Harvey in 2004 as guidelines for regional organizing, then later became universal criteria of the general culture of the multifaceted movement. The 10 Principles are:
* radical inclusion
* gifting
* decommodification
* radical self-reliance
* radical self-expression
* communal effort
* civic responsibility
* leaving no trace
* participation
* immediacy
The descriptions in quotes are the actual text:

=== Radical inclusion ===
&quot;Anyone may be a part of Burning Man. We welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in our community.&quot; This was written with a broad stroke for general organizing, meaning anyone is welcome to the Burning Man culture. Prerequisites for the Burning Man event are: participants are expected to provide for their own basic needs, follow the guidelines in the annually updated event &quot;survival guide&quot;, and purchase a $475 ticket to get in.

=== Gifting ===
&quot;Burning Man is devoted to acts of gift-giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value.&quot; Instead of cash, burners are encouraged to rely on a gift economy, a sort of potlatch. In the earliest days of the event, an underground barter economy also existed, in which burners exchanged &quot;favors&quot; with each other. While this was originally supported by the Burning Man organization, it is now largely discouraged. Instead, burners are encouraged to give one another gifts unconditionally.

=== Decommodification ===
&quot;To preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience.&quot; No cash transactions are permitted between burners. Cash can be used for a select few charity, fuel, and sanitation vendors as follows:
* Café beverages such as coffee, chai, lemonade, etc., which are sold at Center Camp Café, operated by the organizers of the event. Citing cost, decreased need, environmental impact, and decommodification, beverage sales were halted in 2022.
* Ice sales benefit the local Gerlach-Empire school system.
* Tickets for the shuttle bus to the nearest Nevada communities of Gerlach and Empire which is operated by a contractor not participating in the event: Green Tortoise.
* A reentry wristband, which allows a person to leave and reenter the event and may be purchased at the gate upon exit.
* An airport use fee, payable at the airport upon first entry.
* Diesel and biodiesel sold by third-party contractors.
* RV dump service and camp graywater disposal service.
* Private portable toilets and servicing, which can be arranged with the official contractor.

=== Radical self-reliance ===

&quot;Burning Man encourages the individual to discover, exercise, and rely on his or her inner resources.&quot; The event&#x27;s harsh environment and remote location require participants to be responsible for their subsistence. Since the LLC forbids most commerce, participants must be prepared and bring all their own supplies with the exception of the items stated in Decommodification. Public portable toilets are also available throughout the city; some of these are, like art cars, decorated in imaginative ways by volunteers.

=== Radical self-expression ===

&quot;Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others. In this spirit, the giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient.&quot; Burners are encouraged to express themselves in a number of ways through various art forms and projects. The event is clothing-optional and public nudity is common, though not practiced by the majority.

=== Communal effort ===
&quot;Our community values creative cooperation and collaboration. We strive to produce, promote and protect social networks, public spaces, works of art, and methods of communication that support such interaction.&quot; Burners are encouraged to work with and help one another.

=== Civic responsibility ===
&quot;We value civil society. Community members who organize events should assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants. They must also assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local, state and federal laws.&quot;

=== Leave no trace ===
&quot;Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.&quot;

=== Participation ===

&quot;Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through actions that open the heart.&quot; People are encouraged to participate, rather than observe.

=== Immediacy ===
&quot;Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers. No idea can substitute for this experience.&quot;

== The Temple ==

The Temple is the secondary major recurring art installation at Burning Man after the Man, and is considered just as important to the event culture. According to the Burning Man Project, &quot;The Temple is a community shared space that is an important part of Black Rock City. It is not a temple in recognition of any religion; it&#x27;s a neutral, non-denominational spiritual space where everyone can gather to share in the experience of remembering the past, honoring or cursing the present, and pondering the future to come.&quot;

The prime function of the Temple is to be a canvas upon which people can leave words and objects behind to be burned, and to serve as &quot;a place of contemplation, a place to rest, a place of reflection, a place of rituals, weddings, reunions, etc&quot;. During the event, 400 volunteer Temple Guardians monitor the Temple 24 hours a day. The Temple is burned on the eighth and final night of the festival, following the &quot;Man burn&quot; on the previous night.

== Art ==

A hallmark of Burning Man is large-scale interactive installation art inspired by the intersection of maker culture, technology, and nature. Many works invite participation through climbing, touch, technological interfaces, or motion. At night much of the artwork is illuminated by fire or LEDs. Creative expression through art is encouraged at Burning Man in many forms. Music, performance art, and guerrilla theatre are art forms commonly presented within the camps and developed areas of the city. Artwork is placed in the open playa beyond the streets of the city. Each year hundreds of works of art, ranging from small to very large-scale, are brought to Black Rock City.

Art on the playa is assisted by a department of the Burning Man Project called the Artery, which helps artists place their art in the desert and ensures lighting to prevent collisions, burn platform to protect the integrity of the dry lake bed and that fire safety requirements are met. Art grants are available to participants via a system of curation and oversight, with application deadlines early in the year. Grants are intended to help artists produce work beyond the scope of their own means, and are generally intended to cover only a portion of the costs associated with creation of the pieces, usually requiring considerable reliance on an artist&#x27;s community resources. Aggregate funding for all grants varies depending on the number and quality of the submissions (usually well over 100) but amounts to several percent (in the order of $500,000 in recent years) of the gross receipts from ticket sales. In 2006, 29 pieces were funded.

Various standards regarding the nature of the artworks eligible for grants are set by the Art Department, but compliance with the theme and interactivity are important considerations. This funding has fostered artistic communities, most notably in the Bay Area of California, the region that has historically provided a majority of the event&#x27;s participants. There are active and successful outreach efforts to enlarge the regional scope of the event and the grant program.

=== &quot;No Spectators: The Art of Burning Man&quot; ===
In 2018, the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., brought art from Burning Man to the nation&#x27;s capital. The exhibition took over the entire Renwick Gallery building and surrounding neighborhood. The exhibit featured room-sized installations, costumes, and jewelry, while photographs and archival materials from the Nevada Museum of Art trace Burning Man&#x27;s growth and its bohemian roots.

Large-scale installations form the core of the exhibition. Individual artists and collectives featured in the exhibit include David Best, Candy Chang, Marco Cochrane, Duane Flatmo, Michael Garlington and Natalia Bertotti, Five Ton Crane Arts Collective, FoldHaus Art Collective, Scott Froschauer, HYBYCOZO, (Yelena Filipchuk and Serge Beaulieu), Android Jones, Aaron Taylor Kuffner, Christopher Schardt, Richard Wilks, and Leo Villareal.

In addition, multiple large-scale public Burning Man art installations were exhibited throughout the neighborhood surrounding the museum, for an extension of the show &quot;No Spectators: Beyond the Renwick&quot;, which included works by Jack Champion, Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson, HYBYCOZO, Laura Kimpton, Kate Raudenbush, and Mischell Riley. All outdoor works had been installed as honorarium artwork at Burning Man in years past, except for the artwork by Hybycozo. This outdoor exhibition was co-produced by a first ever collaboration with the Golden Triangle BID (Business Improvement District in Washington DC), curated by Karyn Miller.

== Mutant vehicles ==

Mutant Vehicles are purpose-built or creatively altered motorized vehicles. The term &quot;Mutant Vehicle&quot; was coined by organizers of the Burning Man event to delineate a type of &quot;Art Car&quot; that was more dramatically modified than simply decorating an existing vehicle.

Burning Man participants who wish to bring motorized mutant vehicles must submit their designs in advance to the event&#x27;s own DMV or &quot;Department of Mutant Vehicles&quot; for consideration. If a vehicle design meets the &quot;Mutant Vehicle Criteria,&quot; the vehicle is invited to the event for a final physical inspection and licensing at the event. Not all designs and proposals are accepted.

The event organizers, and the DMV, have set the bar high for what it deems an acceptable MV each year, in effect capping the number of Mutant Vehicles. This is in response to constraints imposed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which grants permits to hold the event on federal property, and to participants who want to maintain a pedestrian-friendly environment. Vehicles that are minimally altered, and/or whose primary function is to transport participants, are discouraged and not invited.

One of the criteria the DMV employs to determine whether an application for a proposed Mutant Vehicle is approved is &quot;can you recognize the base vehicle&quot;. For example, if a 1967 VW van covered with glitter, dolls&#x27; heads, and old cooking utensils can still be recognized as a VW van, the DMV would consider it an &quot;Art Car,&quot; but it would not be sufficiently altered to meet the Mutant Vehicle Criteria.

There were over six hundred approved Mutant Vehicles at the event in 2010.

== Bicycles ==

Bicycles and tricycles are popular for getting around on the dry lake. Mountain bikes are generally preferred over road bikes for riding on the dried silt, which is normally hard but becomes loose with traffic. Participants often decorate their bikes to make them unique. Since lighting on the bikes is critically important for safety at night, many participants incorporate the lighting into their decorations, using electroluminescent wire (a thin, flexible tube that glows with a neon-like effect when energized with electricity, also known as el wire) to create intricate patterns over the frame of the bike. Every night during Burning Man, thousands of people on their bikes and art cars, illuminated sculptures and stages create a unique visual effect.

== Theme camps ==

=== Electronic music ===
Camps focusing on electronic music, often played by live DJs, began to appear in 1992, an influence of the rave culture of the San Francisco area. Terbo Ted was identified as the first ever DJ in Burning Man history, opening with a Jean Michel Jarre song played off a vinyl record. DJs typically occupied an area on the outskirts of the Playa nicknamed the &quot;Techno Ghetto&quot;. In later years, certain spokes of the main camp were designated for &quot;sound camps&quot;, with limits on volume and speaker positioning, angled away from the center of Black Rock City.

To work around the rules, mutant vehicles with live DJs and large sound systems began to appear as well. A number of major electronic music camps have been well-known returnees at Burning Man, including Opulent Temple and Robot Heart. Major producers and DJs representing various eras and genres have performed at Burning Man, however DJ events or &quot;lineups&quot; are discouraged from being publicized in the spirit of decommodification and immediacy.

In recent years, concerns began to surface among attendees that a growing number of &quot;mainstream&quot; electronic dance music acts had begun to appear. In 2015, organizers established a new area known as the &quot;Deep Playa Music Zone&quot; (or DMZ), to serve as a new host for art cars featuring live DJs.

== Black Rock City ==


Black Rock City, often abbreviated to BRC, is the temporary city created by Burning Man participants. Much of the layout and general city infrastructure is constructed by Department of Public Works (DPW) volunteers who often reside in Black Rock City for several weeks before and after the event. The remainder of the city including theme camps, villages, art installations and individual camping are all created by participants.

=== City planning ===
The developed part of the city is arranged as a series of concentric streets in an arc composing, since 1999, two-thirds of a 1.5-mile (2.4-km) diameter circle with the Man at the center. Radial streets, sometimes called Avenues, extend from the Man to the outermost circle. The outlines of these streets are visible on aerial photographs. The &quot;missing&quot; third of the circle, along with the open interior, is used for art installations.
The innermost street is named the &quot;Esplanade&quot;. The remaining streets are given names to coincide with the overall theme of the burn, and ordered in ways such as alphabetical order or stem to stern, to make them easier to recall. For example, in 1999, for the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; theme, and again in 2004 for &quot;The Vault of Heaven&quot; theme, the streets were named after the planets of the solar system. The radial streets are usually given a clock designation, for example, 6:00 or 6:15, in which the Man is at the center of the clock face. 12:00 is in the middle of the third of the arc lacking streets, usually at a bearing of 60° true from the Man.

These avenues have been identified in other ways, notably in 2002, in accordance with &quot;The Floating World&quot; theme, as the degrees of a compass. For example 175 degrees, and in 2003 as part of the Beyond Belief theme as adjectives (&quot;Rational, Absurd&quot;) that caused every intersection with a concentric street, named after concepts of belief such as &quot;Authority, Creed&quot;, to form a phrase such as &quot;Absurd Authority&quot; or &quot;Rational Creed.&quot; These proved unpopular with participants due to difficulty in navigating the city without the familiar clock layout.

The Black Rock City Airport is constructed adjacent to the city, typically on its southern side .

=== Center Camp ===

Center Camp is along the midline of Black Rock City, facing the Man at the 6:00 position on the Esplanade. This area serves as a central meeting place for the city and contains the Center Camp Cafe, and a number of other city operations such as camps supporting public radio (BMIR 94.5 FM), Earth Guardians, Recycling Camp, Ranger Outposts, BLM and ESD (Emergency Response), and Arctica (ice).

=== Villages and theme camps ===
Villages and theme camps are along the innermost streets of Black Rock City, often offering entertainment or gifts to participants.

Theme camps are a collective of anywhere between several, to several hundred participants, representing theirselves under a unique value offering. To qualify as a &quot;theme camp&quot;, and therefore be granted placement in BRC, you must apply through official Burning Man placement channels, and remain in good standing to be placed for future years.

Furthermore, &quot;Villages&quot; exist in Black Rock City and are collections of theme camps which share common values, and coordinate resources between their &quot;village&quot; of individual theme camps.

Theme camps and villages, as well as &quot;open campers&quot; who are free to camp outside of Placement boundaries, form to create an atmosphere in Black Rock City that they have collectively envisioned. As Burning Man grows it attracts an ever more diverse crowd. Subcultures form around theme camps at Black Rock City similar to what can be found in other cities.

=== Volunteers ===
The Burning Man event is heavily dependent on a large number of volunteers.

=== Safety, policing and regulations ===
Black Rock City is patrolled by various local and state law enforcement agencies as well as the Bureau of Land Management Rangers. The local police issue $1,500 fines for drug use and serving alcohol to minors. Burning Man also has its own in-house group of volunteers, the Black Rock Rangers, who act as informal mediators when disputes arise.

Firefighting, emergency medical services (EMS), mental health, and communications support is provided by the volunteer Black Rock City Emergency Services Department (ESD). Three &quot;MASH&quot;-like stations are set up in the city: station 3, 6, and 9. Station 6 is staffed by physicians and nurses working with a contracted state licensed ALS Medical provider. Stations 3 and 9 are staffed by Black Rock City ESD personnel. While Station 3 and 9 provide emergency services and basic life support, the volunteers are generally doctors, nurses, EMTs/paramedics, and firefighters. Both station 3 and 9 have a small fire engine available in addition to a Hazardous material/Rescue truck and quick response vehicle for medical emergencies.

In documents from February 2013 first made public in August 2015, it was revealed that in August 2010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had sent a memo to its field offices in Nevada stating that it would patrol Burning Man to &quot;aid in the prevention of terrorist activities and intelligence collection&quot;. Although a threat assessment performed by the FBI determined that drug usage and crowd control were the only major threats to Burning Man, the Bureau still sent an unspecified number of undercover agents to the event, with &quot;no adverse threats or reactions&quot;.

== Black Rock City design evolution ==

=== 1986–1991 ===
From the very beginning on Baker Beach, to 1991 when Burning Man was set into its desert home, there was no real organizational structure to the city. According to Rod Garrett, designer of Black Rock City, &quot;The original form of the camp was a circle. This was not particularly planned, but formed instinctively from the traditional campfire circle and the urge to &#x27;circle the wagons&#x27; against the nearly boundless space.&quot; This didn&#x27;t work much longer, as attendance was reaching into the hundreds, and such a large gathering required some planning.

=== 1992–1995 ===
The Bureau of Land Management took notice of the event, and required that plans be drawn up to maintain safety. They required the Burn to be registered as an official event. In response, four cardinal roads were added emanating from center camp. The Man was located west of Center camp, due to the camp being oriented with the path of the sun across the sky, as opposed to north-to-south. The center circle from the birth of the event was maintained.

In 1993, the first sound camp was opened. It was known as the Techno Ghetto, and it was located two miles north of Center Camp. It was not a usual theme camp, but was instead a mini hub on its own. There was a small &quot;center camp&quot; with a message board and Port-a-potties. The center was surrounded by a circle of camping area across. Six massive sound systems faced out from the circle. The Techno Ghetto was placed separately to keep the &#x27;rave&#x27; out of the main event. As time has progressed, music has become more and more closely tied into the core culture of Burning Man, even spawning a unique genre known as Playa Tech.

=== 1996 ===
With the population growing to 8,000 in 1996, more structure was essential to both appease the Bureau of Land Management and to maintain safety. A ring around Center Camp, named Ring Road, was added to provide for a second circle of theme camps. The eastern section of the circle around Center Camp, in a cone shape, was declared a &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, devoid of all art installations and campsites. The goal was to provide a picturesque view from Center Camp of the Man in the distance. In addition to the camps circling the center, there were camps lining the outside of the No Man&#x27;s Land cone.

The techno ghetto had its last year in 1996. Regardless, the spark of music had ignited, and other sound camps followed.

=== 1997 ===
In 1997 Burning Man was relocated off of the Playa to the Hualapai Flat, due to political problems with Washoe County. Black Rock City truly became a city in 1997, with formal, labeled streets, zoning, and registration for vehicles and theme camps. Rod Garret was brought on board as the lead designer of Black Rock City from then on. In his design, Center Camp remained the starting point, with two angular arms reaching out on either side to form a shallow &quot;V&quot; shape around the Man. These main arms consisted of six annular roads, and two outlying plazas. 1997 was the first year of a Ranger-patrolled perimeter, and the first year of one entry gate.

=== 1998 ===
Burning Man returned to the playa in 1998, and the basis of the modern layout was implemented. The idea was to &quot;recreate some of the intimacy of our original camping circle, but on a much larger civic scale&quot;. Rod Garret&#x27;s design smoothed out the angular &quot;V&quot; from 1997 and implemented the arc. In 1998, it stretched less than half-way around the circle. The radial streets were numbered North 1–20 and South 1–20, instead of the modern clock face system of names such as 11:30 or 5:15. There were four large plazas, each occupied by a major theme camp.

=== 1999–2010 ===
In 1999, for the Wheel of Time theme, the great arc of the city was expanded to the full 240° ( of a circle) that it is today. The streets were renumbered to correspond to a clock face. The Man was in the center, Center Camp at 6:00, and streets every 30 minutes (15°) 2:00 through 10:00.

2000 saw the introduction of the Temple as a fixture on the playa, and it has grown to be easily as important as the Man. It was placed at 12:00 out in the deep playa in the open third of the circle. 2000 introduced the concept of a loud side. A quiet side was replaced by the rule that large scale sound camps would be placed at the 10:00 and 2:00 edges, facing out into the deep playa.

Extra annular streets have been added, as need has increased.

=== 2011–present ===
In 2011, extra radial streets were added, from G street out, to make outer-city navigation easier. These streets were added at intervals of fifteen minutes.

== Transportation ==
=== Road access ===
Highway 34 provides access to the main entrance to Black Rock City. The highway connects to Highway 447 north of Gerlach, which then runs south to Highway 427 in Wadsworth near Interstate 80.

Vehicles then proceed from the Highway 34 entrance north to the main gate via Gate Road, a desert dirt road with a speed limit of 10 mph. All vehicles driving into the city must have the appropriate vehicle pass. All occupants are required to have valid tickets in order to get in. Vehicles are searched for any items that are prohibited in the city. For those who have their tickets held at Will Call, the booths are located between the Highway 34 entrance and the main gate.

All tickets and vehicle passes must be bought in advance. They are not directly sold outside the gate or at the Will Call booths. Unless they have a valid early arrival pass for the pre-event set up, any vehicle who arrives before the gate opens is turned away and told to go back to Reno, and not to wait along the side of the road on either Highways 34 or 447, which would be a safety hazard, nor stay in Gerlach, and overcrowd the small town.

When the Burning Man ends, and the mass exodus from Black Rock City begins, a road traffic control procedure called &quot;Pulsing&quot; is used to direct vehicles out of the city. At regular intervals, usually an hour during the peak periods, all vehicles are &quot;pulsed&quot; forward all at once for about a mile along Gate Road. This allows vehicles to stop and turn off their engines, while those at the southernmost mile of the multi-lane Gate Road slowly merge and then turn onto the two-lane Highway 34.

=== Commercial airports ===
The airport with regular commercial service closest to the event is the Reno–Tahoe International Airport in Reno, Nevada, over two hours&#x27; drive away. In 2018 an estimated 18,000 burners arrived and departed through Reno&#x27;s airport for the event, giving the airport an $11 million boost. Inside the airport that year, a Burning Man-specific information table was created and placed near the baggage claim area.

San Francisco International Airport, nearly six hours away by car, is the nearest airport with a high volume of international service. Other prominent airports, albeit with less international passenger traffic and more domestic services, are Sacramento International Airport, a 4.5-hour drive from Black Rock City, as well as other Bay Area airports such as Oakland International Airport and San Jose International Airport.

Salt Lake City International Airport, serving Salt Lake City, Utah, and Harry Reid International Airport, serving Las Vegas, Nevada, are both an 8.5-hour drive to Black Rock City.

=== Temporary airport ===
A section of the Playa is used for a temporary airport, which is set up before each event and completely erased afterward. It serves both general aviation and charter flights. Pilots began camping there about 1995. Once compelled to add structure, in 1999, it was established in a form acceptable to the BLM through the efforts of Tiger Tiger (Lissa Shoun) and LLC board member Mr. Klean (Will Roger). In 2009, it was recognized by the FAA as a private airport and designated 88NV. It is found on the Klamath Falls Sectional, using a CTAF of 122.9 MHz.

Black Rock UNICOM and the airport are operational on that frequency from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm PDT each day during the event. The runway is simply a compacted strip of playa, and is not lighted. Because of the unique air traffic and safety issues associated with the airport, pilots are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with published information and procedures provided by, for example, AOPA. Because of the changes in the surface of the playa each year, information about the airport is subject to change.

=== Shuttles ===
There are prepaid shuttles originating in Reno and San Francisco that move participants to and from the event. During the event there was also a paid shuttle between the event and the nearby towns of Gerlach and Empire, but this has been discontinued. Exiting and reentering the event requires an additional fee, and is highly discouraged.

=== Other ===
Participants share rides and hitchhike, although walking or bicycling into the event is not allowed.

== &quot;Leave No Trace&quot; policy ==
Burning Man takes place in the middle of a large playa. While not inhabited by humans itself, the area around the playa is home to many animals and plants. Supporters of Burning Man point out that participants are encouraged to leave no trace (LNT) of their visit to Black Rock City (BRC) and to not contaminate the area with litter, commonly known as MOOP (Matter Out of Place). Despite the BLM and LLC&#x27;s insistence on the practice of LNT, the amount of residual trash at the site has increased over the years.

While fire is a primary component of many art exhibits and events, materials must be burned on a burn platform. From 1990 through 1999, burning was allowed to take place directly on the surface of the playa, but this left burn scars (fired pinkish clay-like playa surface). When it was determined in 2000 that the burn scars do not dissipate with the annual winter rains and flooding, the organization declared that fires had to be elevated from the playa surface for its protection.

When it was discovered by two of the founders of the Friends of Black Rock / High Rock (Garth Elliott and Sue Weeks) and BLM Winnemucca district director Terry Reid that burn scars from prior sites (numbering 250) still remained, they were eradicated in 2000 by the DPW clean up crew headed by Dan Miller.

On the last day of the event, public shared burn areas are prepared for participants to use. It is an ongoing educational process each year to encourage participants to protect the environment and other participants by not burning toxic materials.

Even gray water is not to be dumped on the playa. Used shower water must be captured and either evaporated off or collected and carried home with participants or disposed of by roving septic-pumping trucks, which also service RVs. Methods used for evaporating water often include a plastic sheet with a wood frame.

The Bureau of Land Management, which maintains the desert, has very strict requirements for the event. These stipulations include trash cleanup, removal of burn scars, dust abatement, and capture of fluid drippings from participant vehicles. For four weeks after the event has ended, the Black Rock City Department of Public Works (BRC – DPW) Playa Restoration Crew remains in the desert, cleaning up after the temporary city in an effort to make sure that no evidence of the event remains.

In spite of the festival&#x27;s clean up policies, Pershing County Sheriff Jerry Allen has stated that each festival &quot;typically leaves a fair amount of detritus littered across the desert&quot;. He said that the leftover trash, including abandoned vehicles, was particularly heavy after the 2023 event.

== Lawsuit against geothermal energy exploration ==
In 2023, Burning Man filed a lawsuit against exploration of geothermal energy, a renewable green energy source, in the Nevada desert. Subsequently, county commissioners rescinded a permit for the geothermal energy exploration, putting the project indefinitely on halt and potentially scuttling it all together. The Burning Man organization celebrated the move.

==Environmental and sustainability efforts==
Black Rock Solar: In 2008, Black Rock Solar was established to extend the Burning Man ethos of environmental responsibility beyond the festival. The organization provides solar power installations and training to underserved communities, aiming to promote clean energy and economic development. This initiative aligns with the festival’s values of Leave No Trace, which encourages participants to minimize their environmental impact.

Fly Ranch Acquisition: In 2016, the Burning Man Project acquired Fly Ranch, a 3,800-acre property near the festival site. Fly Ranch serves as a space for year-round experiments in sustainable living and art installations, furthering the community’s environmental goals. The acquisition reflects Burning Man&#x27;s shift towards creating lasting impacts beyond the annual event

== Criticism ==
=== Negative effects on the environment ===

Burning Man&#x27;s carbon footprint is primarily from transportation to the remote area. The CoolingMan organization has estimated that the 2006 Burning Man was responsible for the generation of 27,000 tons of carbon dioxide, with 87% being from transportation to and from the location. In 2010, The Sierra Club criticized Burning Man for the &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; of plastic water bottles that end up in landfills, as well as ostentatious displays of flames and explosions.

Burning Man&#x27;s 2007 theme, &quot;Green Man,&quot; received criticism for the artwork &quot;Crude Awakening&quot;, a oil derrick that consumed of jet fuel and of liquid propane to blast a mushroom cloud high into the sky.

In an attempt to offset some of the event&#x27;s carbon footprint, 30- and 50- solar arrays were constructed in 2007 as permanent artifacts, providing an estimated annual carbon offset of 559 tons. The Burn Clean Project is a volunteer organization that has helped replace the use of fossil fuel with biodiesel. In 2023 a group of climate activists blockaded the road into Black Rock city.

Scientists have noted &quot;scars&quot; on the playa, the dry lake bed the festival takes place upon, especially during rainy years. The playa hosts fairy shrimp, water fleas and tadpole shrimp eggs which hatch only after rain and which may be harmed by mechanical damage to the playa during the event. Burning Man also increases wind erosion, which changes the way that the playa absorbs rain in the future.

=== Gentrification ===
Burning Man has attracted a number of billionaires and celebrities, many of them from Silicon Valley and Hollywood. It has become a networking event for them, with Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk once stating that Burning Man &quot;&quot;is&quot; Silicon Valley.&quot;

These billionaires have paid for more luxurious camps to be set up in recent years. Derisively nicknamed &quot;plug-n-play&quot; or &quot;turnkey&quot; camps, they in general consist of lavish RVs and luxury restroom trailers that are driven into the city and connected together to form &quot;de facto&quot; gated areas. These billionaires then fly in to the airport on private planes, are driven to their camps, served by hired help, nicknamed &quot;sherpas&quot;, and sleep in air-conditioned beds. One venture capitalist billionaire threw a $16,500-per-head party at his camp. In 2017, Google employees shipped in a box of lobsters for a meal.

Despite allowing the rich to participate in Burning Man per the &quot;radical inclusion&quot; principle, many traditional attendees have spoken out against their exclusive practices. Larry Harvey wrote that they also conflict with the &quot;radical self-reliance&quot; and other principles, but has also said that permitting the wealthy to attend is beneficial to Burning Man. Vandalism that occurred at the White Ocean sound camp in 2016 was said to have been a &quot;revolution&quot; against these attendees, describing them as a &quot;parasite class&quot; or &quot;rich parasites&quot;.

Meanwhile, the regular admission price has increased over the years. In addition, Nevada lawmakers have modified the state&#x27;s entertainment and sales tax code to include nonprofit organizations like Burning Man that sell more than 15,000 tickets. As a result, an individual ticket, including taxes, cost $424 in 2016. Even tickets sold under Burning Man&#x27;s low-income program are subject to these taxes. Including transportation, food, camp fees, clothing and costumes, and gifts, CNBC estimated in 2016 that the total cost of attending could range from $1,300 up to $20,000. In 2017, &quot;Money&quot; magazine estimated an average total cost of $2,348 to attend.

According to the racial makeup of Burning Man attendees in 2014, 87% of them identified themselves as White, 6% as Hispanic / Latino, 6% as Asian, 2% as Native American, and 1% as Black (figures rounded). (Nevada&#x27;s population, per the 2022 census, is 51% White, 29% Hispanic, 11% Asian, 2% Native, 11% Black). When interviewed by &quot;The Guardian&quot; about these figures, Harvey replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t think Black folks like to camp as much as White folks... . We&#x27;re not going to set racial quotas... This has never been, imagined by us, as a utopian society.&quot;

While there has been criticism that Burning Man has &quot;jumped the shark,&quot; this proposition was criticized by cultural anthropologist Graham St John in 2020, who said that Burning Man was never a utopia in the first place.

=== Criticism from conservatives and religious fundamentalists ===

Some conservative commentators have criticized Burning Man as sinful and hedonistic. For example, Ben Shapiro writes that Burning Man&#x27;s ten principles are a &quot;paganistic morality&quot; which cover for hedonistic acts of sex and drug use. He holds the event as an example of &quot;countercultural garbage that eats at the roots of fundamental societal institutions&quot; in America. Similarly, James Goll and Lou Engle write that Burning Man &quot;exalts Satan, mocks God, and demeans Christianity&quot; because of its nudity, open sexuality, and neo-paganism.

=== Photography restrictions ===

The terms of the Burning Man ticket require that participants wishing to use photo and video-recording equipment share a joint copyright of their images of Black Rock City with Burning Man and forbid them from using their images for commercial purposes. This has been criticized by many, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). The amount of casual nudity at the event has significantly decreased over the years, due to the rise of ubiquitous cell phone cameras and the ability to easily upload photos to the Internet.

A Burning Man spokeswoman replied that the policies are not new, were written by a former head of the EFF, were used when suing to block pornographic videos, and ultimately arose from participant concerns: &quot;We&#x27;re proud that Black Rock City (a private event held on public land) is widely acknowledged as a bastion of creative freedom. [B]ut that protection [of participants&#x27; freedoms] does necessitate the acceptance of some general terms of engagement when it comes to cameras... EFF seems to think that anyone attending any event somehow has an absolute right to take photographs, and then to do whatever they want with those images without any effective restriction or manner of enforcement. While we believe that such rights do make sense for any of us taking pictures in purely public spaces, this is not true in the private space of Burning Man – if it were, it would mean that Burning Man couldn&#x27;t protect participant privacy or prevent commercialization of imagery.&quot;

The Burning Man organization has since worked with the EFF and with Creative Commons and other parties and has revised and clarified the photography policies.

== Regional events ==
Burning Man&#x27;s popularity has encouraged other groups and organizations to hold similar events, some of which serve as an epilogue for participants.

Burners have created smaller regional events modeled on Burning Man, such as Burning Flipside in Texas; Apogaea in Colorado; Playa del Fuego in Delaware; Firefly in New England; Kiwiburn in New Zealand; Blazing Swan in Australia; Transformus in West Virginia; AfrikaBurn in South Africa; NoWhere near Zaragoza in Spain; Midburn in Israel; and many others.

Some of the events are officially affiliated with the Burning Man organization via the Burning Man Regional Network. This official affiliation usually requires the event to conform to the 10 principles and certain standards outlined by the Burning Man organization and to be accompanied by a &quot;Burning Man Regional Contact,&quot; a volunteer with an official relationship to the Burning Man Project via a legal Letter of Agreement. The Netherlands was the first country outside the United States to have an event officially associated with Burning Man named Where the Sheep Sleep since 2016.

In exchange for conforming to these standards, the event is granted permission to officially communicate itself as a Burning Man Regional Event. The regional event organizers are enabled to exchange best practices with each other on a global level via online platforms and in-person conferences, which are partly sponsored by the Burning Man Project.

<text>Chögyam Trungpa (Wylie: &quot;Chos rgyam Drung pa&quot;; March 5, 1939 – April 4, 1987), formally named the 11th Zurmang Trungpa, Chokyi Gyatso, was a Tibetan Buddhist master and holder of both Kagyu and Nyingma lineages of Tibetan Buddhism. He was recognized by both Tibetan Buddhists and other spiritual practitioners and scholars as a preeminent teacher of Tibetan Buddhism. He was a major figure in the dissemination of Buddhism in the West, founding Vajradhatu and Naropa University and establishing the Shambhala Training method. The 11th of the Trungpa tülkus, he was a tertön, supreme abbot of the Surmang monasteries, scholar, teacher, poet, artist, and originator of Shambhala Buddhist tradition.

Among Trungpa&#x27;s contributions are the translation of numerous Tibetan Buddhist texts, the introduction of the Vajrayana teachings to the West, and a presentation of Buddhism largely devoid of traditional trappings. Trungpa popularized the term &quot;crazy wisdom&quot;, referring to some spiritual masters&#x27; unconventional and flamboyant teaching methods. Some of his own methods and actions, particularly his heavy drinking, sexual promiscuity, and his ordering of a physical assault on a student and his girlfriend, caused controversy during his lifetime and afterward.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Born in the Nangchen region of Tibet in March 1939, Chögyam Trungpa was eleventh in the line of Trungpa tülkus, important figures in the Kagyu lineage, one of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Among his three main teachers were Jamgon Kongtrul of Sechen, HH Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, and Khenpo Gangshar.

The name &quot;Chögyam&quot; is a contraction of &quot;Chökyi Gyamtso&quot; (), which means &quot;Ocean of Dharma&quot;. &quot;Trungpa&quot; () means &quot;attendant&quot;. He was deeply trained in the Kagyu tradition and received his khenpo degree at the same time as Thrangu Rinpoche; they continued to be very close in later years. Chögyam Trungpa was also trained in the Nyingma tradition, the oldest of the four schools, and was an adherent of the &quot;ri-mé&quot; (&quot;nonsectarian&quot;) ecumenical movement within Tibetan Buddhism, which aspired to bring together and make available all the valuable teachings of the different schools, free of sectarian rivalry.

At the time of his escape from Tibet, Trungpa was head of the Surmang group of monasteries.

=== Escape from Tibet ===

On April 23, 1959, the 20-year-old Trungpa set out on a nine-month escape from his homeland. Masked in his account in &quot;Born in Tibet&quot; to protect those left behind, the first, preparatory stage of his escape had begun a year earlier, when he fled his home monastery after its occupation by the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA). After spending the winter in hiding, he decided definitively to escape after learning that his monastery had been destroyed. Trungpa started with Akong Rinpoche and a small party of Buddhist monastics, but as they traveled people asked to join until the party eventually numbered 300 refugees, from the elderly to mothers with babies. Even the Queen of Nangchen joined for a period. These additions greatly slowed and complicated the journey. Forced to abandon their animals, over half the journey was on foot as the refugees journeyed through an untracked mountain wilderness to avoid the PLA troops. Sometimes lost, sometimes traveling at night, after three months they reached the Brahmaputra River. Trungpa, the monastics and about 70 refugees managed to cross the river under heavy gunfire, then, eating their leather belts and bags to survive, they climbed 19,000 feet over the Himalayas before reaching the safety of Pema Ko. After reaching India, on January 24, 1960, the party was flown to a refugee camp.

Between 2006 and 2010, independent Canadian and French researchers using satellite imagery tracked and confirmed Trungpa&#x27;s escape route. In 2012, five survivors of the escape in Nepal, Scotland, and the United States confirmed details of the journey and supplied their personal accounts. More recent analysis has shown the journey to be directly comparable to such sagas as Shackleton&#x27;s Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–1917. In 2016 accumulated research and survivors&#x27; stories were published in a full retelling of the story, and later in the year preliminary talks began on the funding and production of a movie.

===Early teachings in the West===
The 16th Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, was known for seeing the future and made plans accordingly. In 1954, shortly after giving Trungpa the monastic vows, the Karmapa turned to him and said, &quot;In the future you will bring Dharma to the West&quot;. At the time, Trungpa wondered what he could be talking about.

In exile in India, Trungpa began his study of English. Freda Bedi then initiated a project with Trungpa and Akong Tulku called the Young Lamas Home School in Dalhousie, India. After seeking endorsement from the 14th Dalai Lama, they were appointed its spiritual director and administrator respectively.

In 1963, with the assistance of Bedi and other sympathetic Westerners, Trungpa received a Spalding Trust fellowship to spend time at Oxford, and was granted &quot;common room&quot; access to St Antony&#x27;s College, at Oxford University. Akong Rinpoche and another monk shared the common room with Trungpa.

In 1966, after the departure of the western Theravadin monk Ananda Bodhi, the Johnstone House Trust in Scotland invited Trungpa and Akong to take over Ananda Bodhi&#x27;s meditation center, which in 1967 became Samye Ling, the first Tibetan Buddhist monastery in the West. Actor and musician David Bowie had been one of Ananda Bodhi&#x27;s meditation students there.

Shortly after his move to Scotland in 1966–67, a variety of experiences including his interactions with his Western students, a solitary retreat in Bhutan, and a car accident that left him partially paralyzed on the left side of his body, led Trungpa to disrobe and return his monastic vows in 1969, in order to work as a lay teacher. He made that decision principally to mitigate students&#x27; becoming distracted by exotic cultures and dress and to undercut their preconceptions of how a guru should behave. He drank, smoked, slept with students, and often kept students waiting for hours before giving teachings. Much of his behavior has been construed as deliberately provocative and sparked controversy. In one account, he encouraged students to give up smoking marijuana, claiming that the smoking was not of benefit to their spiritual progress and that it exaggerated neurosis. Students were often angered, unnerved and intimidated by him, but many remained fiercely loyal, committed, and devoted.

In January 1970, he married his student Diana Pybus, with whom he moved to North America. Akong stayed in Scotland at Samye Ling. Trungpa landed in Ontario, and made deeper connections into Nova Scotia. They soon moved to the United States at the invitation of several students, and traveled mostly to Vermont, California, and Colorado, where he was gaining renown for his ability to present Buddhism in a form readily understandable to Western students. He settled in Boulder, Colorado, and grew his sanghas of students. During this period, he conducted 13 Vajradhatu Seminaries, three-month residential programs at which he presented a vast body of Buddhist teachings in an atmosphere of intensive meditation practice. &quot;The seminaries also had the important function of training his students to become teachers themselves.&quot;

===Introduction of the Vajrayana===
Trungpa was one of the first teachers to introduce Tibetan Buddhism and the Vajrayana to the West. As in Tibet, the schools of the Vajrayana Buddhism and their practices are the domain of everyone, including the monastic &quot;sangha&quot;, the vow-holding &quot;sangha&quot;, and the lay &quot;sangha&quot;. In the United States, Trungpa introduced the Vajrayana mostly to the lay &quot;sangha&quot;.

The presentation of these teachings gave rise to some criticism. According to Trungpa&#x27;s former student Stephen Butterfield, &quot;Trungpa told us that if we ever tried to leave the Vajrayana, we would suffer unbearable, subtle, continuous anguish, and disasters would pursue us like furies&quot;. Other Vajrayana teachers also warn their students about the dangers of the path.

Butterfield said, &quot;to be part of Trungpa&#x27;s inner circle, you had to take a vow never to reveal or even discuss some of the things he did.&quot; But Butterfield also said, &quot;This personal secrecy is common with gurus, especially in Vajrayana Buddhism&quot;, and though he noted &quot;disquieting resemblances&quot; to cults, acknowledged that Trungpa&#x27;s organization is not a cult: &quot;a mere cult leaves you disgusted and disillusioned, wondering how you could have been a fool. I did not feel that charlatans had hoodwinked me into giving up my powers to enhance theirs. On the contrary, mine were unveiled.&quot;

===Meditation and education centers===
In 1973, Trungpa established Vajradhatu, encompassing all his North American institutions, headquartered in Boulder, Colorado. Trungpa also founded more than 100 meditation centers throughout the world. Originally known as Dharmadhatus, these centers, now more than 150 in number, are known as Shambhala Meditation Centers. He also founded retreat centers for intensive meditation practice, including Rocky Mountain Dharma Center in Red Feather Lakes, Colorado, Karmê Chöling in Barnet, Vermont, and Gampo Abbey in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.

In 1974, Trungpa founded the Naropa Institute, which later became Naropa University, in Boulder, Colorado. Naropa was the first accredited Buddhist university in North America. Trungpa hired Allen Ginsberg to teach poetry and William Burroughs to teach literature.

Trungpa had a number of notable students, among whom were Pema Chödrön, Allen Ginsberg, Peter Orlovsky, Anne Waldman, Diane di Prima, Peter Lieberson, John Steinbeck IV, José Argüelles, David Nichtern, Ken Wilber, David Deida, Francisco Varela, and Joni Mitchell, who portrayed Trungpa in the song &quot;Refuge of the Roads&quot; on her 1976 album &quot;Hejira&quot;. Ginsberg, Waldman, and di Prima also taught at Naropa University, and in the 1980s Marianne Faithfull taught songwriting workshops.
Lesser-known students Trungpa taught in England and the US include Alf Vial, Rigdzin Shikpo (né Michael Hookham), Jigme Rinzen (né P. Howard Useche), Karma Tendzin Dorje (né Mike Crowley), Ezequiel Hernandez Urdaneta (known as Keun-Tshen Goba after setting up his first meditation center in Venezuela), Miguel Otaola (aka Dorje Khandro), Francisco Salas Roche, German financier Burkhard Brauch (aka Chugai Keisho), and Francesca Fremantle. Rigdzin Shikpo promulgated Trungpa&#x27;s teachings from a primarily Nyingma rather than Kagyü point of view at the Longchen Foundation.

===Shambhala vision===
In 1976, Trungpa began giving a series of secular teachings, some of which were gathered and presented as the Shambhala Training, inspired by his vision of the legendary Kingdom of Shambhala. Trungpa actually started writing about Shambhala before his 1959 escape from Tibet to India, but most of those writings were lost during the escape.

In his view not only was individual enlightenment not mythical, but the Shambhala Kingdom, an enlightened society, could in fact be actualized. The practice of Shambhala vision is to use mindfulness/awareness meditation as a way to connect with one&#x27;s basic goodness and confidence. It is presented as a path that &quot;brings dignity, confidence, and wisdom to every facet of life.&quot; Trungpa proposed to lead the Kingdom as &quot;sakyong&quot; (Tib. &quot;earth protector&quot;) with his wife as queen-consort or &quot;sakyong wangmo&quot;.

Shambhala vision is described as a non-religious approach rooted in meditation and accessible to individuals of any, or no, religion. In Shambhala terms, it is possible, moment by moment, for individuals to establish enlightened society. His book, &quot;&quot;, provides a concise collection of the Shambhala views. According to Trungpa, it was his intention to propagate the Kingdom of Shambala that provided the necessary inspiration to leave his homeland and make the arduous journey to India and the West.

===Work with arts and sciences===
From the beginning of his time in the United States, Trungpa encouraged his students to integrate a contemplative approach into their everyday activities. In addition to making a variety of traditional contemplative practices available to the community, he incorporated his students&#x27; already existing interests (especially anything relating to Japanese culture), evolving specialized teachings on a meditative approach to these various disciplines. These included kyūdō (Japanese archery), calligraphy, ikebana (flower arranging), Sadō (Japanese tea ceremony), dance, theater, film, poetry, photography, health care, and psychotherapy. His aim was, in his own words, to bring &quot;art to everyday life.&quot; He founded the Nalanda Foundation in 1974 as an umbrella organization for these activities, but changed its name to Naropa Institute.

===Death===
Trungpa visited Nova Scotia for the first time in 1977. In 1983 he established Gampo Abbey, a Karma Kagyü monastery in Cape Breton. The following year, 1984–85, he observed a yearlong retreat at Mill Village and in 1986 he moved his home and Vajradhatu&#x27;s international headquarters to Halifax.

By then he was in failing health due to paralysis from the 1969 auto accident, diabetes, high blood pressure, and years of heavy alcohol use. On September 28, 1986, he suffered cardiac arrest, after which his condition deteriorated, requiring intensive care at the hospital, then at his home and finally, in mid-March 1987, back at the hospital, where he died on April 4, 1987.

In 2006 his wife, Diana Mukpo, wrote, &quot;Although he had many of the classic health problems that develop from heavy drinking, it was in fact more likely the diabetes and high blood pressure that led to abnormal blood sugar levels and then the cardiac arrest&quot;. Trungpa&#x27;s doctor Michael Levy concurred in his initial statement, and added that a bacterial infection likely caused his death. In a 2008 interview for the &quot;Chronicles of Chogyam Trungpa&quot;, Levy changed his statement when asked again &quot;What was he ill with? What did he die of?&quot; He added that Trungpa also &quot;had chronic liver disease related to his alcohol intake over many years.&quot; One of Trungpa&#x27;s nursing attendants reported that he suffered in his last months from classic symptoms of terminal alcoholism and cirrhosis, yet continued drinking heavily. She added, &quot;At the same time there was a power about him and an equanimity to his presence that was phenomenal, that I don&#x27;t know how to explain.&quot;

His body was packed in salt, laid in a wooden box, and conveyed to Karmê Chöling. On 26 May 1987, more than 2,000 students and friends and Tibetan Buddhist masters including Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, the 12th Tai Situ Rinpoche, the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, and the 12th Tsurpu Gyeltsab, Drakpa Tenpa Yarpel Rinpoche, attended Trungpa&#x27;s cremation ceremony before his &quot;kudung&quot; was interred in a stupa at Shambhala Mountain Center. Attendants at the ceremony at Karmê Chöling witnessed that the ceremony was accompanied by rainbows, circling eagles, and a cloud in the shape of an &quot;Ashe&quot; as symbolic of enlightenment. &quot;Everyone who stayed long enough at Trungpa&#x27;s cremation saw the rainbows&quot;, Butterfield said.

===Continuation of the Shambhala lineage===
Upon Trungpa&#x27;s death, the leadership of Vajradhatu was first carried on by his American disciple, appointed Vajra Regent, and Dharma heir Ösel Tendzin (Thomas Rich). Among Tendzin&#x27;s controversial actions was his rejection of the recommendation of senior Kagyu lineage holder the Tai Situpa to take over leadership of Vajradhatu in conjunction with Trungpa&#x27;s half-brother, Damchu Tenphel, who resided in Tibet. This was &quot;regarded by members as a serious slight to lineage authorities and was construed as the Regent&#x27;s attempt to secure his position of control&quot;.

Also controversial was that Tendzin &quot;took further action to buttress his centrality by denying students permission to seek teachings from other Kagyu Tibetan teachers, claiming that only he possessed the special transmission, materials and knowledge unique to the Trungpa lineage. Students were told that if they wanted to practice within the community, they would have to take spiritual instruction from the Regent.&quot;

Other behavior was troubling as well. As one scholar who has studied the community noted, Tendzin was &quot;bisexual and known to be very promiscuous&quot; and &quot;enjoyed seducing straight men&quot; but the community &quot;did not find [this behavior] particularly troublesome&quot;. Not all his partners were unwilling; one scholar said &quot;it became a mark of prestige for a man, gay or straight, to have sex with the Regent, just as it had been for a woman to have sex with [Trungpa] Rinpoche&quot;, but at least one student reported that Tendzin had raped him. As a former Vajradhatu member attested, &quot;a chilling story had recently been reported by one of ... [the] teachers at the Buddhist private school [for the Vajradhatu community]. This straight, married male was pinned face-down across Rich&#x27;s desk by the guards [the Dorje Kasung] while Rich forcibly raped him.&quot;

In 1989 it was revealed that Ösel Tendzin had contracted HIV and knowingly continued to have unprotected sex with his students, without informing them for nearly three years. Some of these students later died of AIDS. Others close to Tendzin, including Vajradhatu&#x27;s board of directors, knew for two years that Tendzin was HIV-positive and sexually active but kept silent. As one student reported at the time:
Shambhala&#x27;s leadership then passed on to Trungpa&#x27;s eldest son and Shambhala heir, Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche. In 2018, Buddhist Project Sunshine, an organization founded as a survivors&#x27; network for former Shambhala Buddhist members,&lt;ref name=&quot;http://andreamwinn.com/offerings&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; reported multiple allegations of sexual assault within the Shambhala community. In response, and to allow time for the community to investigate these accusations, Sakyong Mipham temporarily stepped aside as leader, and the Shambhala governing council resigned and appointed an interim Board of Directors and a Process Team. In response, Sakyong Mipham issued a letter to the community, saying:

After the allegations of sexual misconduct, Naropa Institute removed Sakyong Mipham from its board in 2018. In 2020, The Walrus published an investigative report detailing a culture of abuse dating to Shambhala&#x27;s earliest days, with all three leaders of the organization, including Chögyam Trungpa, having been credibly accused of sexual misconduct and abuse of power.

==Acclaim==
Major lineage holders of Trungpa&#x27;s Tibetan Buddhist traditions and many other Buddhist teachers supported his work.
In 1974, Trungpa invited the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa, head of the Karma Kagyu lineage, to come to the West and offer teachings. Based on this visit, the Karmapa proclaimed Trungpa one of the principal Kagyu lineage holders in the West:
The ancient and renowned lineage of the Trungpas, since the great siddha Trungmase Chökyi Gyamtso Lodrö, possessor of only holy activity, has in every generation given rise to great beings. Awakened by the vision of these predecessors in the lineage, this my present lineage holder, Chökyi Gyamtso Trungpa Rinpoche, supreme incarnate being, has magnificently carried out the vajra holders&#x27; discipline in the land of America, bringing about the liberation of students and ripening them in the dharma. This wonderful truth is clearly manifest.

Accordingly, I empower Chögyam Trungpa Vajra Holder and Possessor of the Victory Banner of the Practice Lineage of the Karma Kagyu. Let this be recognized by all people of both elevated and ordinary station.
In 1981, Trungpa and his students hosted the 14th Dalai Lama in his visit to Boulder, Colorado. Of Trungpa, the Dalai Lama later wrote, &quot;Exceptional as one of the first Tibetan lamas to become fully assimilated into Western culture, he made a powerful contribution to revealing the Tibetan approach to inner peace in the West.&quot;

Trungpa also received support from one of his own main teachers, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, head of the Nyingma lineage. In addition to numerous &quot;sadhana&quot; and poems dedicated to Trungpa, Khyentse Rinpoche wrote a supplication after Trungpa&#x27;s death specifically naming him a &quot;mahasiddha&quot;. Among the Tibetan Rinpoches to name Trungpa a mahasiddha are the Sixteenth Karmapa, Thrangu Rinpoche, Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche and Tai Situpa Rinpoche.

The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche said, &quot;As taught in the Buddhist scriptures, there are nine qualities of a perfect master of buddhadharma. The Eleventh Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche possessed all nine of these.&quot;

Suzuki Roshi, founder of the San Francisco Zen Center and Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, and another important exponent of Buddhism to western students, described Trungpa in the context of a talk about emptiness:
The way you can struggle with this is to be supported by something, something you don&#x27;t know. As we are human beings, there must be that kind of feeling. You must feel it in this city or building or community. So whatever community it may be, it is necessary for it to have this kind of spiritual support.

That is why I respect Trungpa Rinpoche. He is supporting us. You may criticize him because he drinks alcohol like I drink water, but that is a minor problem. He trusts you completely. He knows that if he is always supporting you in a true sense you will not criticize him, whatever he does. And he doesn&#x27;t mind whatever you say. That is not the point, you know. This kind of big spirit, without clinging to some special religion or form of practice, is necessary for human beings.
Gehlek Rinpoche, who lived with Trungpa when they were young monks in India and later visited and taught with him in the U.S., remarked:

He was a great Tibetan yogi, a friend, and a master. The more I deal with Western Dharma students, the more I appreciate how he presented the dharma and the activities that he taught. Whenever I meet with difficulties, I begin to understand – sometimes before solving the problem, sometimes afterward – why Trungpa Rinpoche did some unconventional things. I do consider him to be the father of Tibetan Buddhism in the United States. In my opinion, he left very early – too early. His death was a great loss. Everything he did is significant.
Diana Mukpo, his wife, stated:

First, Rinpoche always wanted feedback. He very, very much encouraged his students’ critical intelligence. One of the reasons that people were in his circle was that they were willing to be honest and direct with him. He definitely was not one of those teachers who asked for obedience and wanted their students not to think for themselves. He thrived, he lived, on the intelligence of his students. That is how he built his entire teaching situation.

From my perspective, I could always be pretty direct with him. Maybe I was not hesitant to do that because I really trusted the unconditional nature of our relationship. I felt there was really nothing to lose by being absolutely direct with him, and he appreciated that.
==Controversies==
Among the forebears formally acknowledged by the Trungpa lineage, and referred to by Trungpa, were the Indian &quot;mahasiddha&quot; Ḍombipa (also known as Ḍombi Heruka; his name may have stemmed from his consorting with Dhombis, outcast women) and Drukpa Künlek (also Kunley), the Mad Yogi of Bhutan, who converted Bhutan to Buddhism and was famous for his fondness for beer and women. Both were recognized for their powerful but unorthodox teaching styles.

Trungpa&#x27;s own teaching style was often unconventional. In his own words, &quot;When we talk about compassion, we talk in terms of being kind. But compassion is not so much being kind; it is being creative to wake a person up.&quot; He did not encourage his students to imitate his own behavior, and was allegedly troubled by those who felt empowered by his example to do whatever they wanted and manipulate people. As the third Jamgön Kongtrül explained to Trungpa&#x27;s students, &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t imitate or judge the behavior of your teacher, Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, unless you can imitate his mind.&quot;

Trungpa&#x27;s sexuality has been one of the sources of controversy, as he cultivated relations with a number of his female students. Tenzin Palmo, who met him in 1962 while he was still at Oxford, did not become one of his consorts, refusing his advances because he had presented himself as &quot;a pure monk&quot;. But Palmo stated that had she known Trungpa had been having sexual relations with women since he was 13, she would not have declined. Trungpa formally renounced his monastic vows in 1969.

Trungpa was also known for smoking tobacco and liberally using alcohol; many who knew him characterized him as an alcoholic. He began drinking occasionally shortly after arriving in India. Before coming to the United States, Trungpa drove a sports car into a joke shop in Gateshead in North-East England, May 1969. While his companion was not seriously injured, Trungpa was left partially paralyzed. Later, he described this event as a pivotal moment that inspired the course of his teachings. Some accounts ascribe the accident to drinking. Others suggest he may have had a stroke. According to Trungpa himself, he blacked out.

Trungpa often combined drinking with teaching. David Chadwick recounts:

Suzuki [Roshi] asked Trungpa to give a talk to the students in the zendo the next night. Trungpa walked in tipsy and sat on the edge of the altar platform with his feet dangling. But he delivered a crystal-clear talk, which some felt had a quality – like Suzuki&#x27;s talks – of not only being about the dharma but being itself the dharma.
In some instances Trungpa was too drunk to walk and had to be carried. Also, according to his student John Steinbeck IV and his wife, on a couple of occasions Trungpa&#x27;s speech was unintelligible. One woman reported serving him &quot;big glasses of gin first thing in the morning.&quot;

The Steinbecks wrote &quot;The Other Side of Eden&quot;, a sharply critical memoir of their lives with Trungpa in which they claim that, in addition to alcohol, he spent $40,000 a year on cocaine, and used Seconal to come down from the cocaine. The Steinbecks said the cocaine use was kept secret from the wider Vajradhatu community. Joni Mitchell said Trungpa cured her of her cocaine addiction during a meeting with him in 1976, leaving her with a three-day experience of selfless awakening. She went on to refer his unorthodox characteristics in the first verse of &quot;Refuge of the Roads&quot;, the last track of her 1976 album &quot;Hejira&quot;.

An incident that became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; among some poets and artists was the Halloween party at Snowmass Colorado Seminary in 1975, held during a 3-month period of intensive meditation and study of the Hinayana, Mahayana, and Vajrayana vehicles of Tibetan Buddhism. The poet W. S. Merwin had arrived at the Naropa Institute that summer and been told by Allen Ginsberg that he ought to attend the seminary. Although he had not gone through the several years&#x27; worth of study and preparatory mind training required, Merwin asked if he and Hawaiian poet Dana Naone, his girlfriend, could attend and Trungpa granted his request. At seminary the couple kept to themselves. At the Halloween party, after many, including Trungpa himself, had taken off their clothes, Merwin was asked to join the event but refused. On Trungpa&#x27;s orders, his Vajra Guard forced entry into the poet&#x27;s locked and barricaded room; brought him and his girlfriend, Dana Naone, against their will, to the party; and eventually stripped them of all their clothes, with onlookers ignoring Naone&#x27;s pleas for help and for someone to call the police. The next day Trungpa asked Merwin and Naone to remain at the Seminary as either students or guests. They agreed to stay for several more weeks to hear the Vajrayana teachings, with Trungpa&#x27;s promise that &quot;there would be no more incidents&quot; and Merwin&#x27;s that there would be &quot;no guarantees of obedience, trust, or personal devotion to him.&quot; They left immediately after the last talk. In a 1977 letter to members of a Naropa class investigating the incident, Merwin concluded,

My feelings about Trungpa have been mixed from the start. Admiration, throughout, for his remarkable gifts; and reservations, which developed into profound misgivings, concerning some of his uses of them. I imagine, at least, that I&#x27;ve learned some things from him (though maybe not all of them were the things I was &quot;supposed&quot; to learn) and some through him, and I&#x27;m grateful to him for those. I wouldn&#x27;t encourage anyone to become a student of his. I wish him well.
The incident became known to a wider public when Tom Clark published &quot;The Great Naropa Poetry Wars&quot;. The Naropa Institute later asked Ed Sanders and his class to conduct an internal investigation, resulting in a lengthy report.

Eliot Weinberger commented on the incident in a critique aimed at Trungpa and Allen Ginsberg published in &quot;The Nation&quot; on April 19, 1980. He complained that the fascination of some of the best minds of his generation with Trungpa&#x27;s presentation of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan theocracy created a dangerous exclusivity and elitism.

Author Jeffery Paine commented on this incident that &quot;[s]eeing Merwin out of step with the rest, Trungpa could have asked him to leave, but decided it was kinder to shock him out of his aloofness.&quot; Paine also noted the outrage felt in particular by poets such as Robert Bly and Kenneth Rexroth, who began calling Trungpa a fascist.

Trungpa&#x27;s choice of Westerner Ösel Tendzin as his dharma heir was controversial, as Tendzin was the first Western Tibetan Buddhist lineage holder and Vajra Regent. This was exacerbated by Tendzin&#x27;s own behavior as lineage holder. While knowingly HIV-positive, Tendzin was sexually involved with students, one of whom became infected and died.

<text>The Ministry of Defence (MOD or MoD) is a ministerial department of the Government of the United Kingdom. It is responsible for implementing the defence policy set by the government and serves as the headquarters of the British Armed Forces.

The MOD states that its principal objectives are to defend the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and its interests and to strengthen international peace and stability. The MOD also manages day-to-day running of the armed forces, contingency planning and defence procurement.

The expenditure, administration and policy of the MOD are scrutinised by the Defence Select Committee, except for Defence Intelligence which instead falls under the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament.

==History==
During the 1920s and 1930s, British civil servants and politicians, looking back at the performance of the state during World War I, concluded that there was a need for greater co-ordination between the three services that made up the armed forces of the United Kingdom: the Royal Navy, the British Army and the Royal Air Force. The formation of a united ministry of defence was rejected by the coalition government of David Lloyd George in 1921, but the Chiefs of Staff Committee was formed in 1923, for the purposes of inter-service co-ordination. As rearmament became a concern during the 1930s, Stanley Baldwin created the position of Minister for Co-ordination of Defence. Ernle Chatfield, 1st Baron Chatfield held the post until the fall of the Chamberlain government in 1940. His success was limited by his lack of control over the existing Service departments, and his lack of political influence.

On forming his government in 1940, Winston Churchill created the office of Minister of Defence, to exercise ministerial control over the Chiefs of Staff Committee and to co-ordinate defence matters. The post was held by the Prime Minister of the day until Clement Attlee&#x27;s government introduced the Ministry of Defence Act of 1946. After 1946, the three posts of Secretary of State for War, First Lord of the Admiralty, and Secretary of State for Air were formally subordinated to the new Minister of Defence, who had a seat in the Cabinet. The three service ministers – Admiralty, War, Air – remained in direct operational control of their respective services, but ceased to attend Cabinet.

From 1946 to 1964, five Departments of State did the work of the modern Ministry of Defence: the Admiralty, the War Office, the Air Ministry, the Ministry of Aviation, and an earlier form of the Ministry of Defence. Those departments merged in 1964, and the defence functions of the Ministry of Aviation Supply were merged into the Ministry of Defence in 1971. The unification of all defence activities under a single ministry was motivated by a desire to curb interservice rivalries and followed the precedent set by the American National Security Act of 1947.

===Controversies===

===Fraud===

The most notable fraud conviction has been that of Gordon Foxley, Director of Ammunition Procurement at the Ministry of Defence from 1981 to 1984. Police claimed he received at least £3.5m in total in corrupt payments, such as substantial bribes from overseas arms contractors aiming to influence the allocation of contracts.

===Germ and chemical warfare tests===
A government report covered by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper in 2002 indicated that between 1940 and 1979, the Ministry of Defence &quot;turned large parts of the country into a giant laboratory to conduct a series of secret germ warfare tests on the public&quot; and many of these tests &quot;involved releasing potentially dangerous chemicals and micro-organisms over vast swathes of the population without the public being told.&quot; The Ministry of Defence claims that these trials were to simulate germ warfare and that the tests were harmless. However, families who have been in the area of many of the tests are experiencing children with birth defects and physical and mental handicaps and many are asking for a public inquiry. The report estimated these tests affected millions of people, including during one period between 1961 and 1968 where &quot;more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including &quot;E.coli&quot; and &quot;Bacillus globigii&quot;, which mimics anthrax.&quot; Two scientists commissioned by the Ministry of Defence stated that these trials posed no risk to the public. This was confirmed by Sue Ellison, a representative of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down who said that the results from these trials &quot;will save lives, should the country or our forces face an attack by chemical and biological weapons.&quot;

=== Civil action ===
In February 2019, former soldier Inoke Momonakaya won £458,000 payout after a legal battle for the racial harassment and bullying he received while serving in the army. In August 2019, &quot;A Commons Defence Select Committee&quot; report revealed that several female and BAME military staff have raised concerns regarding discrimination, bullying and harassment. In September 2019, two former British army soldiers Nkululeko Zulu and Hani Gue won a racial discrimination claim against the Ministry of Defence (MoD). In November 2019, mixed race soldier Mark De Kretser sued MoD for £100k claiming he was subjected to &quot;grindingly repetitive&quot; racist taunts from colleagues.

===Territorial Army cuts===
In October 2009, the MOD was heavily criticised for withdrawing the bi-annual non-operational training £20m budget for the Territorial Army (TA), ending all non-operational training for six months until April 2010. The government eventually backed down and restored the funding. The TA provides a small percentage of the UK&#x27;s operational troops. Its members train on weekly evenings and monthly weekends, as well as two-week exercises generally annually and occasionally bi-annually for troops doing other courses. The cuts would have meant a significant loss of personnel and would have had adverse effects on recruitment.

===Overspending===
In 2013, it was found that the Ministry of Defence had overspent on its equipment budget by £6.5bn on orders that could take up to 39 years to fulfil. The Ministry of Defence has been criticised in the past for poor management and financial control.
Specific examples of overspending include:
* Eight Boeing Chinook HC3 were ordered in 1995 as dedicated special forces helicopters. The aircraft were to cost £259 million and the forecast in-service date was November 1998. However, although delivered in 2001, the Mk3 could not receive airworthiness certificates as it was not possible to certify the avionics software, and would not enter service until 2017. The procurement was described by Edward Leigh, then Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, as &quot;one of the most incompetent procurements of all time&quot; and the National Audit Office issued a scathing report on the affair, stating that the whole programme was likely to cost £500 million.
* In 2010, the Nimrod MRA4 maritime patrol aircraft procurement was cancelled after £3.4 billion had been spent on the programme. In addition there were termination costs which were not disclosed. In January 2011 it was reported by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; that when the decision was taken to scrap the aircraft, &quot;[it] was still riddled with flaws&quot;.

=== Hacking ===
In May 2024, the ministry&#x27;s payroll system was reportedly targeted multiple times in a cyberattack in which personnel and their bank details were compromised. While initial reports attributed the cyberattack to China, the Minister of Defence Grant Shapps said it would take some time to conclude who was to blame.

==Ministerial team==
The Ministers in the Ministry of Defence are as follows, with cabinet ministers in bold:

==Senior military officials==

===Chiefs of the Defence Staff===

The CDS is supported by the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff (VCDS) who deputises and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the armed services aspect of the MOD through the Central Staff, working closely alongside the Permanent Secretary. They are joined by the professional heads of the three British armed services (Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force) and the Commander of Strategic Command. All personnel sit at OF-9 rank in the NATO rank system.

Together the Chiefs of Staff form the Chiefs of Staff Committee with responsibility for providing advice on operational military matters and the preparation and conduct of military operations.

==Defence policy==

The Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 included £178 billion investment in new equipment and capabilities. The review set a defence policy with four primary missions for the Armed Forces:
* Defend and contribute to the security and resilience of the UK and Overseas Territories.
* Provide the nuclear deterrent.
* Contribute to improved understanding of the world through strategic intelligence and the global defence network.
* Reinforce international security and the collective capacity of our allies, partners and multilateral institutions.
The review stated the Armed Forces will also contribute to the government&#x27;s response to crises by being prepared to:
* Support humanitarian assistance and disaster response, and conduct rescue missions.
* Conduct strike operations.
* Conduct operations to restore peace and stability.
* Conduct major combat operations if required, including under NATO Article 5.

==Governance and departmental organisation==
=== Governance ===
Defence is governed and managed by several committees.
* The Defence Council provides the formal legal basis for the conduct of defence in the UK through a range of powers vested in it by statute and Letters Patent. It too is chaired by the Secretary of State, and its members are ministers, the senior officers and senior civilian officials.
* The Defence Board is the main MOD corporate board chaired by the Secretary of State oversees the strategic direction and oversight of defence, supported by an Investment Approvals Committee, Audit Committee and People Committee. The board&#x27;s membership comprises the Secretary of State, the Armed Forces Minister, the Permanent Secretary, the Chief and Vice Chief of the Defence Staff, the Chief of Defence Materiel, Director General Finance and three non-executive board members.
* Head Office and Corporate Services (HOCS), which is made up of the Head Office and a range of corporate support functions. It has two joint heads the Chief of the Defence Staff and the Permanent Secretary who are the combined TLB holders for this unit they are responsible for directing the other TLB holders.

=== Departmental organisation ===

===Contracting===
Competitive procurement processes are used whenever possible, and all new direct tender and contract opportunities valued over £10,000 are advertised on a system called the Defence Sourcing Portal. A separate internal policy generally operates in respect of low value purchasing below this threshold.

DEFCON contract conditions are numbered defence contract conditions are in contracts issued by the MOD (not to be confused with DEFCON as used by the United States Armed Forces, which refers to a level of military &quot;defence readiness condition&quot;).

Examples include:
*DEFCON 534: Subcontracting and prompt payment
*DEFCON 620: a change control procedure
*DEFCON 658 (cyber) applies to all suppliers down the supply chain
*DEFCON 659 relates to security measures for disclosure of &quot;Secret Matters&quot; including within the supply chain, requiring a contractor to ensure that employees &quot;engaged on any work in connection with the Contract have notice that the Official Secrets Acts 1911–1989 apply to them and will continue so to apply after the completion or termination of the Contract&quot;, potentially also requiring employees to &quot;sign a statement acknowledging that, both during the term of the Contract and after its completion or termination&quot;, they are bound by the Official Secrets Acts 1911–1989 (and where applicable by any other legislation).
*DEFCON 705: the MOD&#x27;s standard IPR condition for fully funded research and technology contracts.

A full set of the DEFCONs can be accessed via the MoD&#x27;s Defence Gateway (registration required).

The government noted in 2013 that the MoD&#x27;s third-party expenditure was characterised by &quot;complex, high-value contracts&quot;. Defence purchasing contributes to government ambitions to make supply chains more accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises, but the government commented that it had yet to secure good insight into the supply chain role of SMEs.

==Property portfolio==
The Ministry of Defence is one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest landowners, owning 227,300 hectares of land and foreshore (either freehold or leasehold) at April 2014, which was valued at &quot;about £20 billion&quot;. The MOD also has &quot;rights of access&quot; to a further 222,000 hectares. In total, this is about 1.8% of the UK land mass. The total annual cost to support the defence estate is &quot;in excess of £3.3 billion&quot;.

The defence estate is divided as training areas &amp; ranges (84.0%), research &amp; development (5.4%), airfields (3.4%), barracks &amp; camps (2.5%), storage &amp; supply depots (1.6%), and other (3.0%). These are largely managed by the Defence Infrastructure Organisation.

=== Main Building ===

The headquarters of the MOD are in Whitehall and is known as MOD Main Building. This structure is neoclassical in style and was originally built between 1938 and 1959 to designs by Vincent Harris to house the Air Ministry and the Board of Trade. A major refurbishment of the building was completed under a Private Finance Initiative contract by Skanska in 2004. The northern entrance in Horse Guards Avenue is flanked by two monumental statues, &quot;Earth&quot; and &quot;Water&quot;, by Charles Wheeler. Opposite stands the Gurkha Monument, sculpted by Philip Jackson and unveiled in 1997 by Queen Elizabeth II. Within it is the Victoria Cross and George Cross Memorial, and nearby are memorials to the Fleet Air Arm and RAF (to its east, facing the riverside).

Henry VIII&#x27;s wine cellar at the Palace of Whitehall, built in 1514–1516 for Cardinal Wolsey, is in the basement of Main Building, and is used for entertainment. The entire vaulted brick structure of the cellar was encased in steel and concrete and relocated nine feet to the west and nearly deeper in 1949, when construction was resumed at the site after World War II. This was carried out without any significant damage to the structure.

<text>Alma Mahler-Werfel (born Alma Margaretha Maria Schindler; 31 August 1879 – 11 December 1964) was an Austrian composer, author, editor, and socialite. Musically active from her early years, she was the composer of nearly fifty songs for voice and piano, and works in other genres as well. 17 songs are known to have survived. At 15, she was mentored by Max Burckhard.

She married composer Gustav Mahler but he died in 1911. In 1915, Alma married Walter Gropius, and they had a daughter, Manon Gropius. Throughout her marriage to Gropius, Alma engaged in an affair with Franz Werfel. Following her separation from Gropius, Alma and Werfel eventually married.

In 1938, after Nazi Germany annexed Austria, Werfel and Alma fled, as it was unsafe for the Jewish Werfel. Eventually the couple settled in Los Angeles. In later years, her salon became part of the artistic scene, first in Vienna, then in Los Angeles and New York.

==Early years==
Alma Maria Schindler was born on 31 August 1879 in Vienna, Austria, (then Austria-Hungary) to the famous landscape painter Emil Jakob Schindler and his wife Anna Sofie. She was tutored at home and brought up in the Catholic Church. In 1886, Crown Prince Rudolf found interest in Emil Jakob Schindler&#x27;s paintings and commissioned Schindler to take a trip with his family to the Adriatic coast to produce landscape paintings. In 1892, the family also traveled to the North Sea island of Sylt, where Emil Schindler died.

After her father&#x27;s death, Alma focused on the piano. She studied composition and counterpoint with Josef Labor, a blind organist who introduced her to a &quot;great deal of literature&quot;. At 15, she was sent to school but attended for only a few months. As she grew older, a case of childhood measles left her with decreased hearing. Max Burckhard, a friend of Emil Schindler and director of Vienna&#x27;s Burgtheater theater, became Alma&#x27;s mentor. On Alma&#x27;s 17th birthday, Burckhard gave her two laundry baskets full of books. In 1895, Anna Schindler, Alma&#x27;s mother, married Carl Moll, Emil Schindler&#x27;s student. In 1899 they had a daughter together named Maria.

Alma met Gustav Klimt through Carl Moll. Moll and Klimt were both founding members of the Vienna Secession, &quot;a group organized for the purpose of breaking with Vienna&#x27;s tradition-bound Imperial Academy of the visual arts&quot;. Klimt fell in love with Alma. While she initially was interested in Klimt, her desire cooled soon after. Klimt and Alma were friends until Klimt&#x27;s death. In autumn 1900, Alma began studying composition with Alexander von Zemlinsky. Zemlinsky and Alma fell in love and kept their relationship a secret.
Alma teased Zemlinsky about what she thought were his ugly features, saying she could easily have &quot;ten others&quot; to replace him. She also noted that to marry Zemlinsky would mean she would &quot;bring short, degenerate Jew-children into the world&quot;. As the relationship grew strained, Zemlinsky visited her less and less. On 7 November 1901, she attended Zuckerkandl&#x27;s salon where she began a flirtation with Gustav Mahler. In the month of November, while still in a relationship with Zemlinsky, she started an affair with Mahler. By 8 December, Mahler and Alma secretly were engaged; however, it was not until 12 December that she wrote to Zemlinsky about her engagement. The engagement was formally announced on 23 December.

==Marriage to Gustav Mahler==
On 9 March 1902, she married Gustav Mahler, who was 19 years her senior and the director of the Vienna Court Opera. With him she had two daughters, Maria Anna (1902–1907), who died of scarlet fever or diphtheria, and Anna (1904–1988), who later became a sculptor. Gustav was not interested in Alma&#x27;s composition, desiring for her to abandon composing. Although one scholar disputes whether or not Gustav outright forbade Alma Mahler to compose, the lengthy letter Gustav sent her on 19 December 1901 is emphatic that she must give up composing, and Alma did artistically stifle herself and embraced the role of a loving wife and supporter of her husband&#x27;s music.

In June 1910, after becoming severely depressed in the wake of Maria&#x27;s death, Alma began an affair with the young architect Walter Gropius (later head of the Bauhaus), whom she met during a rest at a spa. Gustav sought advice from Sigmund Freud in August. The 2010 film &quot;Mahler on the Couch&quot; suggests that Gustav&#x27;s consultations with Freud might have focused on his curtailing of Alma&#x27;s musical career as a major marital obstacle, but the actual content of these meetings is not known.
Following the emotional crisis in their marriage after Gustav&#x27;s discovery of Alma&#x27;s affair with Gropius, Gustav began to take a serious interest in Alma&#x27;s musical compositions, regretting his earlier dismissive attitude and taking promotional actions. Gustav edited some of her songs (&quot;Die stille Stadt&quot;, &quot;In meines Vaters Garten&quot;, &quot;Laue Sommernacht&quot;, &quot;Bei dir ist es traut&quot;, &quot;Ich wandle unter Blumen&quot;). Upon his urging and under his guidance, Alma prepared five of her songs for publication (they were issued in 1910, by Gustav&#x27;s own publisher, Universal Edition).

In February 1911, Gustav fell severely ill with an infection related to a heart defect that had been diagnosed several years earlier. He died on 18 May.

==Relationship with Walter Gropius==
After Gustav&#x27;s death, Alma did not immediately resume contact with Gropius. Between 1912 and 1914 she had a tumultuous affair with the artist Oskar Kokoschka, who created works inspired by their relationship, including his painting &quot;The Bride of the Wind&quot;. Kokoschka&#x27;s possessiveness wore on Alma, and the emotional vicissitudes of the relationship tired them both.

With the coming of World War I, Kokoschka enlisted in the Austro-Hungarian Army. Alma subsequently distanced herself from Kokoschka and resumed contact with Walter Gropius, who was also serving in combat at that time. She and Gropius married on 18 August 1915 in Berlin during one of his military leaves. They had a daughter together, Manon Gropius (1916–1935), who grew up being friends with Maria Altmann. After Manon died of polio at the age of 18, composer Alban Berg dedicated his newly composed Violin Concerto to her, &quot;In Memory of an Angel&quot;.

Alma became pregnant and gave birth to a son, Martin Carl Johannes Gropius (1918–1919). Gropius at first believed that the child was his, but Alma&#x27;s ongoing affair with Franz Werfel was common knowledge in Vienna by this time. Within a year, Alma and Gropius agreed to a divorce. In the meantime, Martin, who had been born prematurely, developed hydrocephalus and died at 10 months. Alma&#x27;s divorce from Gropius became final in October 1920.

==Relationship with Franz Werfel==

While Gropius&#x27;s military duties were still keeping him absent, Alma met and began an affair with Prague-born poet and writer Franz Werfel in the fall of 1917. She and Werfel began openly living together after her divorce from Gropius. However, she postponed marrying Werfel until 1929, after which she took the name Alma Mahler-Werfel.

In 1938, following the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, Alma and Werfel, who was Jewish, were forced to flee Austria for France; they maintained a household in Sanary-sur-Mer on the French Riviera from the summer of 1938 until the spring of 1940. With the German invasion and occupation of France during World War II and the deportation of Jews and political adversaries to Nazi concentration camps, the couple were no longer safe in France and frantically sought to secure their emigration to the United States. In Marseille, they were contacted by Varian Fry, an American journalist and emissary of the Emergency Rescue Committee, a private American relief organization that aided refugee intellectuals and artists at that time.

As exit visas could not be obtained, Fry and Unitarian Waitstill Sharp arranged for the Werfels to journey on foot across the Pyrenees into Spain to evade the Vichy French border officials. From Spain, Alma and Franz traveled to Portugal. They stayed in Monte Estoril, at the Grande Hotel D&#x27;Itália, between 8 September and 4 October 1940. On the same day, they boarded the S.S. &quot;Nea Hellas&quot; headed for New York City, arriving on 13 October.

Eventually they settled in Los Angeles, where Alma continued her role as a hostess, bringing together Arnold Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky, Thomas Mann, and many other artists. Werfel, who had enjoyed moderate renown in the US as an author, achieved popular success with his novel &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot;, and the science fiction novel &quot;Star of the Unborn&quot;, published after his death. Werfel, who had experienced serious heart problems throughout his exile, died of a heart attack in California in 1945.

==Cultural icon in the US==
In 1946, Mahler-Werfel became a US citizen. Several years later she moved to New York City, where she remained a cultural figure. Leonard Bernstein, who was a champion of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s music, stated in his Charles Eliot Norton lectures of 1973 that Mahler-Werfel had attended some of his rehearsals. Benjamin Britten, considering her to be a &quot;living&quot; link to both Mahler and Alban Berg, dedicated his &quot;Nocturne for Tenor and Small Orchestra&quot; to her. In 1951 Alma Mahler-Werfel moved to New York, where she had purchased four small condominiums in a house on the Upper East Side (120 East 73rd Street). She lived herself on the third floor and used one apartment as a living room, the second as a bedroom.

==Death==
Alma Mahler-Werfel died 11 December 1964 in New York City. She was buried on 8 February 1965 in the Grinzing Cemetery of Vienna in the same grave as her daughter Manon Gropius and a few steps away from Gustav Mahler.

== Nazi-looted art ==
In 1999, Mahler-Werfel&#x27;s granddaughter requested that five artworks seized under the Nazis be restored to the family. The paintings were “A summer&#x27;s night on the beach” (1902) by Edvard Munch and three landscapes by her great-grandfather Emil Jakob Schindler. Alma Werfel had loaned the paintings to the Oesterreichische Galerie before fleeing the Nazis; Carl Moll, a militant Nazi, gained control of them, selling the Munch to the Oesterreichische Galerie in 1940 and keeping the others until, fearing retribution from the Red Army, he committed suicide. Mahler-Werfel filed claims after the war but was only able to recover the Kokoschka portrait. When Austria modified its restrictive restitution laws, the granddaughter revived the claims. Austria initially rejected the claim. After a restitution battle that lasted six decades, Austria finally agreed to restitute the stolen Munch in 2006.

== The Alma Problem ==
Mahler-Werfel&#x27;s two books on Gustav Mahler influenced studies of the latter. As an articulate, well-connected, and influential woman who outlived her first husband by more than 50 years, Mahler-Werfel was for decades treated as the main authority on the mature Gustav Mahler&#x27;s values, character, and day-to-day behavior, and her various publications quickly became the central source material for Mahler scholars and music-lovers alike. As scholars investigated her depiction of Mahler and her relationship with him, her accounts have increasingly been revealed as unreliable, false, and misleading. Nevertheless, the deliberate distortions have had a significant influence on several generations of scholars, interpreters, and music-lovers.

Citing the serious contradictions between Alma&#x27;s accounts and other evidence, including her own diaries, several historians and biographers began to speak of the Alma Problem. According to Hugh Wood: &quot;Often she is the only witness, and the biographer has to depend on her while doubting with every sentence her capacity for telling the truth. Everything that passed through her hands must be regarded as tainted&quot;. Countering this stance is that of musicologist Nancy Newman, whose study provides a &quot;theoretical foundation&quot; that &quot;grounds extensive critique of both the conventions of &quot;fin-de-siècle&quot; Vienna and the chauvinism of late twentieth-century scholars.&quot;

==As a composer==
Alma played the piano from childhood and in her memoir (&quot;Mein Leben&quot;), reports that she first attempted composing at age eight in the beginning of 1888 on the Greek island of Corfu. She studied composition with Josef Labor beginning in 1894 or 1895 and until 1901. She met Alexander von Zemlinsky in early 1900, began composition lessons with him that fall, and continued as his student until her engagement to Gustav Mahler in December 1901, after which she ceased composing. Until this time, she had composed or sketched mostly Lieder, but around 20 piano pieces and a small number of chamber music works, and a scene from an opera. She briefly resumed composing in 1910, but stopped in 1915. The chronology of her compositions is difficult to establish because she did not date her manuscripts and destroyed many of them herself. Attempts to establish a chronological list of her works have been made by Susanne Rode-Breymann in 1999 and 2014 and by Knud Martner in 2018.

A total of 17 songs by her survive. Fourteen were published during her lifetime in three publications dated 1910, 1915, and 1924. The first two volumes appeared under the name Alma Maria Schindler-Mahler, and the last volume was published as &quot;Fünf Gesänge&quot; by Alma Maria Mahler; the cover of the 1915 set was illustrated by Oskar Kokoschka. Three additional songs were discovered in manuscripts posthumously; two of them were published in the year 2000, edited by Susan M. Filler, and one published in 2018, edited by Barry Millington. Her personal papers, including music manuscripts, are held at the University of Pennsylvania, the Austrian National Library in Vienna, and the Bavarian State Library in Munich. These songs have been performed and recorded regularly since the 1980s. Orchestral versions of the accompaniments have been produced. Seven songs were orchestrated by David and Colin Matthews (published by Universal Edition), and all 17 songs were orchestrated by Julian Reynolds, and by Jorma Panula.

==In popular culture==
American satirist Tom Lehrer described her obituary as the &quot;juiciest, spiciest, raciest&quot; obituary he had ever read. It prompted him to write the ballad, &quot;Alma&quot;, portraying her as &quot;the loveliest girl in Vienna ... the smartest as well&quot;. Lehrer writes, &quot;All modern women are jealous&quot; of her &quot;For bagging Gustav and Walter and Franz&quot;, each of whom came under her &quot;spell&quot;.

In the 1974 film &quot;Mahler&quot;, by director Ken Russell, Gustav Mahler, while on his last train journey, remembers the important events of his life, such as his relationship with his wife, the deaths of his brother and young daughter, and his trouble with the muses. In the film, Alma was portrayed by Georgina Hale and Gustav by Robert Powell.

In 1996, Israeli writer Joshua Sobol and Austrian director Paulus Manker created the polydrama &quot;Alma&quot;. It played in Vienna for six successive seasons and toured with over 400 performances to Venice, Lisbon, Los Angeles, Petronell, Berlin, Semmering, Jerusalem, and Prague—all places where Mahler-Werfel had lived. The show was made into a three-part TV miniseries in 1997.

Mohammed Fairouz set the words of Alma Mahler in his song cycle &quot;Jeder Mensch&quot;. It premiered in a coupling with songs of Alma Mahler by mezzo-soprano Kate Lindsey in 2011.

A treatment of Mahler-Werfel&#x27;s life was presented in the 2001 Bruce Beresford film &quot;Bride of the Wind&quot;, in which Alma was played by Australian actress Sarah Wynter. Gustav Mahler was portrayed by British actor Jonathan Pryce. Swiss actor Vincent Pérez portrayed Oskar Kokoschka.

In 1998, extracts from Alma&#x27;s diaries were published, covering the years from 1898 to 1902, until the time she married Mahler. In the 2001 novel &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Wife&quot; by Max Phillips, she tells her story from the afterlife, focusing on her complicated relationships.

In 2010, the German filmmaker Percy Adlon and his son released their film &quot;Mahler auf der Couch&quot; (&quot;Mahler on the Couch&quot;), which relates Gustav Mahler&#x27;s tormented relationship with his wife, Alma, and his meeting with Sigmund Freud in 1910. In the film&#x27;s introduction, the directors state, &quot;That it happened is fact. How it happened is fiction.&quot;

Alma appears in chapter 6, &quot;Montredon&quot; of the 2019 novel, &quot;The Flight Portfolio&quot;, by Julie Orringer. She and Werfel are depicted meeting with Varian Fry to discuss the arrangements Fry is trying to make in order to effect their escape from France.

Roz Chast, drew a comic serial entitled &quot;The Inescapable Thingness&quot; in The New Yorker online magazine regarding the doll that Oskar Kokoschka had made of Alma after their affair had ended.

<doc id="203795" wikidata="Q310992" url="?curid=203795" title="Rama I">
<text>Phutthayotfa Chulalok (born Thongduang; 20 March 1737 – 7 September 1809), also known by his regnal name Rama I, was the founder of the Rattanakosin Kingdom (now Thailand) and the first King of Siam from the reigning Chakri dynasty. He ascended the throne in 1782, following the deposition of King Taksin of Thonburi. He was also celebrated as the founder of Rattanakosin (now Bangkok) as the new capital of the reunited kingdom. 

Rama I, whose given name was Thongduang, was born from a Mon male line descent family, great-grandson of Kosa Pan. His father served in the royal court of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. Thongduang and his younger brother Boonma served King Taksin in wars against the Burmese Konbaung dynasty and helped him in the reunification of Siam. During this time he emerged as Siam&#x27;s most powerful military leader. Thongduang was the first &quot;Somdet Chao Phraya&quot;, the highest rank the nobility could attain, equaled to that of royalty. In 1782, he took control of Siam and crowned himself as the monarch. The most famous event in his reign was the Burmese–Siamese War (1785–1786), which was the last major Burmese assault on Siam.

Rama I&#x27;s reign marked a revival of Siamese culture and state organization following the collapse of the Siamese kingdom in 1767, whose capital was then situated at Ayutthaya. He established a new purified Buddhist sect which allied and tied together Buddhism and the monarchy. Rama I consolidated and expanded on Taksin&#x27;s military campaigns throughout Mainland Southeast Asia, whose mandala in 1809 stretched as far North and South as the Shan States and the Northern Malay Peninsula and as far East as the Annamite Range, respectively. His reign also marked the beginning of a new &quot;Golden Age of Culture&quot;, which continued in the footsteps of the blossoming of the arts during the Late Ayutthaya Period.

==Name==
Like other high-ranking figures of old Siam, Rama I&#x27;s name changed several times during his lifetime, depending on his respective position, and even posthumously. His name at birth was Thongduang (also spelled &quot;Thong Duang&quot; ทองด้วง), family names had not yet been introduced in Siam at that time.

When Thongduang served as deputy governor of Ratchaburi Province during the rule of King Ekkathat of Ayutthaya, he bore the title of &quot;Luang Yokkrabat&quot;. After the demise of Ayutthaya, the new king Taksin to whom he served as an important military commander, awarded him successively the titles of &quot;Phra Ratcharin Chao Krom Phra Tamruat&quot; (head of the police department), &quot;Phraya Aphaironnarit&quot;, &quot;Phraya Yommarat&quot;, &quot;Phraya Chakri&quot; and &quot;Chaophraya Chakri&quot; (minister of the northern provinces). Finally Taksin created him the title of &quot;Somdet Chaophraya Maha Kasatsuek&quot;, a noble title as high as no Siamese official had born before him, making him quasi-royalty.

When he ascended to the throne in 1782, he took the name &quot;Ramathibodi&quot;, just like the founder of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. His full title was much longer (&quot;Phra Borommarachathirat Ramathibodi Sisin Borommaha Chakkraphat Rachathibodin&quot; etc.), intended to demonstrate his universal claim to power like of earlier Siamese kings.

After his death, the people referred to him simply as &quot;Phaendin Ton&quot; (&quot;the first reign&quot;), to his son as &quot;Phaendin Klang&quot; (&quot;the middle reign&quot;). Continuing this system consequently, his grandson Rama III would have been &quot;the last reign&quot;. To avoid this inauspicious title, he ended this practice by donating two Buddha statues that were placed to the sides of the Emerald Buddha at Wat Phra Kaeo and dedicated one each to his father and grandfather. He demanded to refer to his two predecessors using the names of these Buddha statues. The one dedicated to the first Chakri king was named &quot;Phra Phutthayotfa Chulalok&quot; (&quot;the Buddha on top of the sky and the crown of the worlds&quot;). This is how this king is still referred to in Thai history books.

His descendant Vajiravudh (Rama VI) who had studied in England, realised that most Siamese kings&#x27; names were difficult to reproduce and remember for Westerners. He therefore disposed to use for all kings of the Chakri dynasty the name &quot;Rama&quot; together with the respective ordinal number. So this king is &quot;Rama I&quot; in Western literature. In 1982, 200 years after his accession, the Thai cabinet decided to award him the epithet &quot;Maharat&quot; (&quot;The Great&quot;).

==Early life==
===An Ayuttayan aristocrat===

Thongduang was born in 1737 in the reign of King Boromakot of Ayutthaya. His father was Thongdi, a Mon noble serving the royal court (posthumously raised to Somdet Phra Prathom Borommahachonnok – &quot;the grand primordial father&quot;) who was &quot;Phra Akson Sunthonsat&quot; (Royal Secretary of northern Siam, Keeper of the Royal Seal). Phra Akson Sunthonsat was also a descendant of Kosa Pan, the leader of King Narai&#x27;s embassy to the French court. His mother, Daoreung (original name Yok), was part-Chinese. Thongduang had six other siblings.

Thongduang at a young age entered the Royal Palace as one of the royal pages of King Uthumphon, where he met his childhood friend Taksin. In 1757, aged 21, he became a monk temporarily, in accordance with Siamese custom. In 1760, he married Nak, daughter of a town patron in Samut Sakorn. He was later appointed the &quot;Luang Yokkrabat&quot; (deputy governor) of Ratchaburi Province by King Ekkathat in 1758.

===Service under Taksin===
On the eve of the fall of Ayutthaya, Phraya Wachiraprakan (later King Taksin) had foreseen that the fall of the city was certain. Wachiraprakan decided to break the siege of the city of Ayutthaya by the Burmese army and establish a new base outside. Phraya Ratchaburi also joined this venture. In 1767, Ayutthaya under King Ekkathat fell to Burmese invaders, the city was completely destroyed; burned and looted. Local warlords rose up to establish their supremacy in the absence of a central authority.

Despite the fall of Ayutthaya, Taksin and his men in the same year managed to capture Chantaburi and Trat. During this time Phraya Ratchaburi became one of Taksin&#x27;s six ministers and together with Phraya Pichai they were regarded by Taksin as his two most valuable generals.

===Military leader===
Swiftly Taksin made a strategic plan and under it recaptured Ayutthaya in one year. In 1768 Taksin crowned himself and founded the Kingdom of Thonburi on the west bank of the mouth of the Chao Phraya river, using Thonburi as a new capital. Under the new Thonburi regime, Thongduang was appointed head of the royal police department, bearing the title &quot;Phra Ratcharin&quot;. After subjugating the warlord of Phimai with his brother Bunma (at that time called Phra Mahamontri, the future Maha Sura Singhanat), he was raised to &quot;Phraya Aphairanarit&quot;.

After the campaign to subdue the lord of Fang in 1769, Thongduang was raised to &quot;Phraya Yommarat&quot; and in the next year became &quot;Chao Phraya Chakri&quot; – the &quot;Samuhanayok&quot; (chief minister of the northern provinces). Chakri commanded the Siamese troops in the wars against Burma and went on to subjugate Cambodia. His brother Bunma (who by that time held the title of Phraya Anuchit Raja), accompanied him in various campaigns. Chakri and his brother were sent to the north to Lan Na in 1774 to free the kingdom from Burmese rule with the help of Phraya Kawila, a prince from Lampang. In 1776, he conquered Khmer Pa Dong (around modern Surin). He was assigned the task of conquering Lao kingdoms in 1778 and all the three kingdoms (Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Champasak) fell to the Siamese in the same year. He was eventually raised to &quot;Somdet Chao Phraya Maha Kasatsuek&quot;, the first official to ever hold this rank.

==Ascension as King==

In 1781, he went on the campaigns against Cambodia, only to return prematurely due to the instability of Thonburi. The rebellion of Phraya Sun had broken out and the rebels deposed King Taksin. Some sources report that Taksin was consigned to a monastery. After arriving in Thonburi in 1782, Chao Phraya defeated the Phraya Sun with his forces. Later sources widely reported that the general eventually executed the ousted Taksin, contradicting to some earlier sources. He then seized power and made himself King, establishing the Chakri dynasty, which continues to rule Thailand to this day.

General Maha Kasatsuek crowned himself on 6 April 1782. Soon after, he decided to move the capital of Siam to the east bank of the Chao Phraya river for several reasons, including its better strategic location and a desire to promote his legitimacy by starting from a clean slate. He decided to name his new capital &quot;Rattanakosin&quot; (&quot;Keeping place of the Emerald Buddha&quot;). Rama I also raised various members of his family to royalty. He appointed his brother Surasi (Anuchit Raja) or Maha Sura Singhanat as the &quot;Front Palace&quot; (conventional title of the viceroy and heir presumptive) and his nephew Thong-In or Anurak Devesh as the &quot;Rear Palace&quot;.

The King had 42 children. Ten of these were born to Queen Amarinda, the others by various concubines. The Queen&#x27;s children included Prince Isarasundhorn, later King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai (Rama II) (whom the King appointed as Front Palace after the death of Maha Sura Singhanat in 1803), Prince Maha Senanurak and Prince Maha Sakdi Polsep.

==Foreign policy and war==

===Vietnam and Cambodia===

In 1784–1785, the last of the Nguyễn Lords, Nguyễn Ánh, convinced Rama I to give him forces to attack Vietnam, which was then under the control of the Tây Sơn brothers. However, the joint Nguyễn-Siam fleet was destroyed in the Battle of Rach Gam–Xoai Mut in the Mekong Delta region. Nguyễn&#x27;s appeal for Siamese assistance enabled the Siamese to exert considerable political influence over Nguyễn&#x27;s court. Mac Tu Sinh, the son of Mạc Thiên Tứ and his Siamese wife, was raised among the Siamese, and held office as the governor of Hà Tiên until his death in 1787. Ngo Ma, a general of Siamese descent, was appointed as its acting governor in Mac&#x27;s place. Nguyễn Ánh also took refuge in Siam at the King&#x27;s court waiting for the opportunities to defeat Tây Sơn. These episodes demonstrated Rama I&#x27;s willingness to extend Siamese power beyond his Kingdom.

In Cambodia, King Reamraja (Ang Non II) was deposed in 1779 and the throne was given to the young prince Ang Eng. However, the pro-Vietnamese policies of certain Cambodian aristocrats under Ang Eng alarmed Rama I. As a result, Rama I had Ang Eng captured and deported to Bangkok, where Rama adopted him as his son, the purpose of which was to impose pro-Siamese sentiments on him. Rama I also imposed Chao Phraya Abhaya Bhubet as the Regent of Cambodia.

Nguyễn Ánh secretly left for Vietnam in 1787, leaving Rama I a note. Ánh managed to recapture Saigon by 1788 and later ascended as Emperor Gia Long in 1802.

In 1794, upon Ang Eng&#x27;s majority, Rama I reinstalled him as the Neareay Reachea III. The area around Siem Reap and Battambang was annexed by Siam, and were governed by Abhaya Bhubet. However, Rama I allowed these territories to be ruled in accordance with Cambodian traditions.

===Wars with Burma===

Soon King Bodawpaya of Burma started to pursue his ambitious campaigns to expand his dominions over Siam. The Burmese–Siamese War (1785–1786), also known in Siam as the &quot;Nine Armies War&quot; because the Burmese came in nine armies, broke out. The Burmese soldiers poured into Lanna and Northern Siam. Siamese forces, commanded by Kawila, Prince of Lampang, put up a brave fight and delayed the Burmese advance, all the while waiting for reinforcements from Bangkok. When Phitsanulok was captured, Anurak Devesh the &quot;Rear Palace&quot;, and Rama I himself led Siamese forces to the north. The Siamese relieved Lampang from the Burmese siege.

In the south, Bodawpaya was waiting at Chedi Sam Ong ready to attack. The Front Palace was ordered to lead his troops to the south and counter-attack the Burmese coming to Ranong through Nakhon Si Thammarat. He brought the Burmese to battle near Kanchanaburi. The Burmese also attacked Thalang (Phuket), where the governor had just died. Chan, his wife, and her sister Mook gathered the local people and successfully defended Thalang against the Burmese. Today, Chan and Mook are revered as heroines because of their opposition to the Burmese invasions. In their own lifetimes, Rama I bestowed on them the titles Thao Thep Kasattri and Thao Sri Sunthon.

The Burmese proceeded to capture Songkhla. Upon hearing the news, the governors of Phatthalung fled. However, a monk named Phra Maha encouraged the citizens of the area to take up arms against the Burmese; his campaign was also successful. Phra Maha was later raised to the nobility by Rama I.

As his armies were destroyed, Bodawpaya retreated. The next year, he attacked again, this time constituting his troops as a single army. With this force Bodawpaya passed through the Chedi Sam Ong pass and settled in Tha Din Daeng. The Front Palace marched the Siamese forces to face Bodawpaya. The fighting was very short and Bodawpaya was quickly defeated. This short war was called the Tha Din Daeng campaign.

==Death and legacy==

King Rama I died on 7 September 1809 after a short but acute illness; he was succeeded by his son Prince Isarasundhorn as Buddha Loetla Nabhalai or Rama II.

Siam during the reign of Rama I reached a new height of power not seen since the sixteenth century. Militarily Siam was able to successfully repel Burmese invasions and exerted control over Laos and Cambodia and Vietnam. Culturally Rama I also encouraged cultural works to rehabilitate people after the successive series of wars and built many temples and monuments during his reign. His policies laid the foundation for Siam to expand within the next decades.

<doc id="203798" wikidata="Q372245" url="?curid=203798" title="Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat">
<text>The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) is an international body in the field of tall buildings, including skyscrapers, and sustainable urban design. A non-profit organization based at the Monroe Building in Chicago, Illinois, United States, the CTBUH announces the title of &quot;The World&#x27;s Tallest Building&quot; and is widely considered to be an authority on the official height of tall buildings. Its stated mission is to study and report &quot;on all aspects of the planning, design, and construction of tall buildings.&quot; 

The CTBUH was founded at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in 1969 by Lynn S. Beedle, where its office remained until October 2003 when it relocated to the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago.

==Ranking tall buildings==

The CTBUH ranks the height of buildings using three different methods:

#Height to architectural top: This is the main criterion under which the CTBUH ranks the height of buildings. Heights are measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance to the top of the building, inclusive of spires but excluding items such as flagpoles and antennae.
#Highest occupied floor: Height to the floor level of the highest floor that is occupied by residents, workers or other building users on a consistent basis.
#Height to tip: Height to the highest point of the building, including antennae, flagpoles, and technical equipment.

A category measuring to the top of the roof was removed from the ranking criteria in November 2009. This is because flat-topped skyscrapers are not as common in the modern era, as skyscrapers with intricate spire designs and parapet features atop their roofs make it more difficult to define the roof of a building.

The CTBUH insist that a building should only be added to the official tallest list when it is (i) topped out structurally and architecturally, (ii) fully clad, and (iii) open for business, or at least partially open. This became the CTBUH official definition of a building&#x27;s &quot;completion&quot;.

The CTBUH maintains an extensive database (named The Skyscraper Center) of the tallest buildings in the world, organized by various categories. Buildings under construction are also included, although not ranked until completion. The CTBUH also produces an annual list of the 10 tallest buildings completed in that particular year. Topping the 2008 list was the Shanghai World Financial Center in Shanghai, the then tallest building in the world according to the criteria of highest occupied floor, and home to the world&#x27;s highest observation deck. Second on the 2008 list was the Almas Tower in Dubai, third was the Minsheng Bank Building in Wuhan which stands at , whilst fourth was The Address Downtown Burj Dubai (). All in all, six of the 10 tallest buildings completed in 2008 are located in Asia, three in the Middle East and one in North America.

==Events==
The CTBUH also hosts annual conferences and a World Congress every three to five years. The 2012 World Congress was held in Shanghai from September 19 to 21 . The next World Congress was held in Chicago between October 28 and November 2, 2019.
The CTBUH also bestows Tall Building Awards each year, with four regional awards to the Americas, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, and Asia and Australasia. Among these four regional awards, one is given the &quot;Best Tall Building Award Overall.&quot; There are also two lifetime achievement awards. Starting in 2010, these awards are presented at a symposium and dinner held on the Illinois Institute of Technology&#x27;s campus. In 2012, the CTBUH added two new awards for Innovation and Performance.

==Publications==
In addition to the monthly newsletter and daily updated global news archive, the CTBUH publishes a quarterly CTBUH Journal. The Journal includes peer-reviewed technical papers, in-depth project case studies, book reviews, interviews with prominent persons in the tall building industry, and much more.

The CTBUH also publishes guidebooks, reference manuals, and monographs related to the tall building industry. In 2006 it published the book &quot;101 of the World&#x27;s Tallest Buildings&quot; in conjunction with author and CTBUH member Georges Binder, a reference to 101 of the world&#x27;s tallest skyscrapers. It includes photos, plans, details on architects, engineers and stakeholders, and comprehensive technical data on each building. Since 2008 it has published a &quot;Best Tall Buildings&quot; book to accompany that year&#x27;s awards.

<doc id="203800" wikidata="Q1751266" url="?curid=203800" title="Skynet (satellite)">
<text>Skynet is a family of military communications satellites, now operated by Babcock International on behalf of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Ministry of Defence (MOD). They provide strategic and tactical communication services to the branches of the British Armed Forces, the British intelligence agencies, some UK government departments and agencies, and to allied governments. Since 2015 when Skynet coverage was extended eastward, and in conjunction with an Anik G1 satellite module over America, Skynet offers near global coverage.

The Skynet contract allows Airbus Defence and Space to sell surplus bandwidth, through the Skynet partner programme, to NATO and allied governments, including the Five Eyes intelligence alliance members (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States). As of 2020, seven Skynet satellites are operating, plus Anik G1.

The Skynet 1 to 4 series were developed and operated by the Signals Research and Development Establishment, Royal Signals and Radar Establishment and Royal Air Force until 2003. It was subsequently operated with Skynet 5 by Paradigm Secure Communications until October 2012, when the organisation was rebranded to Astrium Services then through merger in 2015 became Airbus Defence and Space.

The MOD is currently specifying a new architecture for Skynet to replace the Skynet 5 system, whose funding programme ended in August 2022. The vision for Skynet 6 is a flexible system architecture that combines UK government, allied and commercial satellites, including the current Skynet 5 satellites. Skynet is the large part of the MOD Future Beyond Line of Sight satellite communications programme (FBLOS), which extends to 2041, with expected transition costs of about £6 billion.
== History ==
In the 1960s, only two countries had communication satellites, the United States and the Soviet Union. The United Kingdom created Skynet as its own military communications satellite system, because of inadequate undersea communications cable availability and to increase flexibility, reliability, data capacity and security. The Signals Research and Development Establishment led the development of Skynet 1 and 2, and its successor Royal Signals and Radar Establishment carried out research for the development of the subsequent satellites and ground terminals.

The MOD space communications research programme began in 1962, initially considering Moon and space debris bounce techniques, before considering a UK satellite. In 1964, it was decided Skynet should be in geostationary orbit over the Indian Ocean, significantly to support East of Suez deployments, and have a transponder with two channels permitting communications between two types of ground station. This would be an advance over the ongoing U.S. Interim Defense Communication Satellite Program (IDCSP). In 1965, the U.S. invited the MOD to participate in their IDCSP programme, and to participate Marconi were contracted to build three 40 foot diameter air transportable ground stations for the launch of the first IDCSP satellites in 1966. As Britain had insufficient industry expertise to build satellites, a contact was placed with U.S. Philco Ford to build Skynet 1, but with the assistance of Marconi to improve UK expertise for Skynet 2.

Nine ground stations were initially planned, which could also communicate with sub-geostationary U.S. IDCSP satellites:
* three principal stations at RAF Oakhanger, Cyprus and Singapore with 40 foot dishes and 20 kW transmitters
* two stations at HMS Jufair and RAF Gan (Indian Ocean) with air transportable 20 foot dishes and 5 kW transmitters called SKYNET V
* two additional air-transportable stations
* two Royal Navy ship stations with 6 foot dishes and 5 kW transmitters, initially installed on and but movable to and as required

Skynet 1A was the first military satellite in geostationary orbit, in 1969. The Royal Air Force displayed a model of the Skynet satellite on the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Blue Peter&quot; in 1969, the show also described the new British satellite control centre at RAF Oakhanger.

The Skynet satellites provided secure and encrypted facilities, though expensively, for the British armed forces and intelligence agencies. It enables an important sovereign command and control service. The largest user of the Skynet satellites during the Cold War was the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), who were responsible for over 80% of traffic at some locations such as Cyprus. Despite the enormous communications capability of Skynet, GCHQ still found the capacity provided by Skynet to be inadequate. In 1972, GCHQ was still the satellite&#x27;s largest funder, and argued for the purchase of an American built Type-777 (DSCS II) satellite instead. GCHQ would later plan their own secret signals intelligence satellite, Zircon, which was subsequently cancelled. The circumstances around the reporting of Zircon&#x27;s existence would become known as the Zircon affair.

Skynet has had throughout all its models a good degree of interoperability with U.S. and NATO military communications satellites and ground stations.

In 2010, the Civil Contingencies Secretariat of the Cabinet Office launched the High Integrity Telecommunications System, a satellite-based emergency communications service based on Skynet, for use by UK police and other emergency services, primarily for use at Strategic Command Centres and at major events and emergencies. It replaced the earlier Emergency Communications Network.

In 2021 UK Space Command was created, which when fully operational will take over responsibility for Skynet from Strategic Command (previously known as Joint Forces Command), likely in 2023.

== Models ==
=== Skynet 1 ===
There were two Skynet 1 satellites (1A and 1B); Skynet 1A was launched on a Delta M on 22 November 1969, and stationed over the east coast of Africa. However, the satellite ceased operating after about 18 months when all of its Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers (TWTAs) failed, probably when soldered high voltage joints failed after cycling between extreme temperatures. Some time in the mid-1970s, the now-defunct satellite was moved far from its original position; its current location in a stable &quot;gravity well&quot; (see Geostationary orbit#Stability) at longitude 105° W off the Pacific coast of Latin America is 36,000 km away from its original position, and it could not have simply drifted and ended up in this stable orbit. The new location is near satellite traffic and it has to be monitored for collision risks. In 2024, the BBC reported that there is no record of who moved it or why. Skynet 1B was launched on a Delta M on 19 August 1970. Skynet 1B was placed in a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) and was abandoned in transfer orbit (270 x 36058 km) due to a failure of the Thiokol Star 17A apogee kick motor.

Skynet 1 series satellites had an orbit mass of , were spin-stabilised with a single despun antenna with 3 watts of output on two channels (2 MHz and 20 MHz). The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO 2A and NATO 2B satellites, launched 1970 and 1971, were identical except for an antenna shaped to only cover NATO countries.

=== Skynet 2 ===
Following the operational failure of the Skynet 1A satellite, the timetable for the launch of the Skynet 2 communications satellite was delayed. Skynet 2A was launched on the Delta 2313 by NASA for the United Kingdom on 19 January 1974. A short circuit in an electronics package circuit board (on second stage) left the upper stages and satellite in an unstable low orbit (96 x 3406 km x 37.6°) that rapidly decayed. An investigation revealed that a substandard coating had been used on the circuit board.

Despite being in an unstable orbit, the ground stations successfully located and tracked Skynet 2A and were able to use telemetry readings from the solar panels to determine its alignment. Based on this analysis, it was decided to use the alignment thrusters to deorbit the unit, and it was destroyed when it re-entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on 24 January 1974.

Skynet 2B was successfully launched on the Delta 2313 by NASA for the United Kingdom on 23 November 1974. It was positioned in geostationary orbit above Kenya to give coverage of Europe, Africa and a substantial part of Asia as far east at the Philippines. It could support about ten simultaneous users. Major ground stations used a 40-foot diameter dish, while in the field or at sea a 2 m diameter dish was used.

Skynet 2 satellites had an orbit mass of , with a single antenna with 16 watts of output.

The Skynet 2 series satellites were assembled and tested at the Marconi Space and Defence Systems establishment in Portsmouth, England, and were the first non-amateur communication satellites built outside the United States and USSR. The Signals Research and Development Establishment (SRE) led the development, and performed initial in-orbit testing. Subsequently, the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment supported Skynet satellites, including developing ground terminals and modems, at RAF Defford which was also a backup for the primary ground station at RAF Oakhanger. The Skynet 2B system was very successful for its time, and remained in service for 20 years although only having 2 communications channels.

=== Skynet 3 ===
Skynet 3 series satellites was cancelled as the United Kingdom withdrew East of Suez, and instead the capability it was intended to offer was delivered via U.S. and NATO assets. This dependence on U.S. assets was identified as a weakness during the Falklands War and was one of the contributing factors for the emergence of the Skynet 4 series satellites tranche of space vehicles. Technology improvements created the possibility of tactical satellite communications using smaller terminals, creating a new requirement beyond Skynet 3 strategic headquarters communications. The Royal Navy was also concerned that the high frequency radio alternative enabled location tracking by the Soviet Union Ocean Surveillance System.

=== Skynet 4 ===

Skynet 4 series satellites have few similarities to the earlier generations, being based on the British Aerospace European Communications Satellite. The cylindrical body of Skynet 1 and 2 was replaced by a large square body housing antennas with deployable solar-cell arrays. This marks the technological improvement from spin-stabilisation, used in earlier cylindrical satellites, to three-axis stabilisation using momentum wheels and reaction wheels controlling the satellite gyroscopically. Each satellite had a design operational life of 7 years.

Skynet 4 manufacture was carried out by British Aerospace Dynamics (BAe Dynamics) with Matra Marconi Space (MMS) providing the Communications payload. NATO adapted the design for the NATO IVA and IVB communication satellites, also manufactured by BAe Dynamics. The programme timescales were delayed, as initially Skynet 4 was designed to be launched from the Space Shuttle (STS), with chosen RAF officers to be part of each Shuttle Crew. However, following the 1986 Challenger disaster (STS 51-L), the programme slowed and all the Skynet 4 series satellites had to be modified to suit the changes needed to go on a disposable launch vehicle. As Skynet 4A build was advanced it needed significant modification, and its completion was overtaken by Skynet 4B which had not progressed as far, and hence more easily converted. Consequently, Skynet 4B was finished first and launched in 1988, with Skynet 4A next in early 1990, and Skynet 4C later the same year. As of 2022, Skynet 4C is still in operation, providing service to the U.S. Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station for up to six hours a day because its orbital inclination has increased to 10.3°.

The Stage 1 satellites (4A, 4B and 4C) have multi-frequency capability and considerable operational flexibility, with selectable channels, gain and four antenna types of differing widths to support varying requirements, Ultra high frequency (UHF), Super high frequency (SHF) and experimental Extremely high frequency (EHF) channels are available. They are hardening against electromagnetic pulse (EMP) and have anti-jamming capability, with an un-degraded 1600 watts power supply. The satellites have a dry mass of , with three reaction wheels and hydrazine thrusters for station keeping.

The improved Stage 2 satellites (4D, 4E and 4F) were built by Matra Marconi Space and Astrium to replace the earlier versions. Improvements included increased power and resistance to electronic jamming. Skynet 4D was launched in 1998, Skynet 4E in 1999 and Skynet 4F in 2001. Skynet 4D was parked in a non-operational supersynchronous orbit on 28 January 2008.

Skynet 4 provides Ultra high frequency and Super high frequency services using Earth cover, wide area and spot beam coverage.

=== Skynet 5 ===
Skynet 5 is the next generation of satellites, replacing the existing Skynet 4 Stage 2 satellites. It was contracted via Private Finance Initiative (PFI) to a partnership between 
Paradigm Secure Communications and EADS Astrium, a European spacecraft manufacturer. EADS Astrium was responsible for the build and delivery of Skynet 5 series satellites in orbit, whilst subsidiary company Paradigm was responsible for the provision of service to the Ministry of Defence (MOD). In 2010, the PFI contract was extended by two years to 2022, to a total cost of £3.66 billion over the course of the contract, with Paradigm able to sell bandwidth in excess of the capacity of 1.1 Skynet satellites to other allied countries. Paradigm had 220 staff and about 100 sub-contractors working on Skynet. Serco is a major subcontractor on the PFI programme. This was the biggest ever outsourced military satellite communications contract.

The Skynet 5 satellite is based on the Eurostar E3000 satellite bus design, weighs about , has two solar panels each about fifteen metres long, and has a power budget of five kilowatts. It has four steerable transmission dishes, and a phased-array receiver designed to allow jamming signals to be cancelled out. They will also resist attempts to disrupt them with high-powered lasers.

Astrium described in 2010 the Skynet 5 system as: 

Skynet 5A was launched by an Ariane 5 launch vehicle at 22:03 UTC on 11 March 2007, in a launch shared with the Indian INSAT 4B civil communications satellite, and entered full service on 10 May 2007. The launch was delayed from 10 March 2007 due to malfunction of a launch pad deluge system. Skynet 5A successfully separated from its launch vehicle and telemetry was acquired by its dedicated Control Centre approximately 40 minutes after launch.

Skynet 5B was launched at 22:06 UTC on 14 November 2007, from Centre Spatial Guyanais, Kourou, in French Guiana, aboard an Ariane 5ECA launch vehicle. This launch was delayed from 9 November 2007 due to problems with the electronics on one of the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB), and 12 November 2007 due to a fuelling problem with the launch pad. At time of launch, the Ariane 5ECA launcher set a new record on this mission, deploying a total payload of more than .

Skynet 5C was launched at 22:05:09 UTC on 12 June 2008, from Centre Spatial Guyanais, Kourou, in French Guiana, aboard an Ariane 5ECA launch vehicle. The launch had been delayed twice. Originally scheduled for 23 May 2008, more checks were carried out on the launch vehicle and the launch was rescheduled for 30 May 2008. A problem with the launch software during pre-launch checks led Arianespace to reschedule the launch for a second time to 12 June 2008.

Skynet 5D was launched at 21:49:07 UTC on 19 December 2012, from Centre Spatial Guyanais, Kourou, in French Guiana, aboard an Ariane 5ECA launch vehicle. Skynet 5D provides more than double the UHF channels of the previous satellites, which are in demand as they support &quot;comms on the move&quot; for soldiers with backpack radios. The Ministry of Defence described the satellite as having a &quot;key role in gathering intelligence on operations&quot;, as well as communications. Skynet 5D has larger fuel tanks enabling it to be repositioned more frequently if necessary.

The programme marks a change of approach in the UK from traditional defence procurement methods to a services-based contract which also includes provision of leased ground terminals, &quot;Reacher&quot; vehicles, the &quot;Satellite Communications Onboard Terminal&quot; (SCOT) for ships, and the associated baseband equipment.

Initially two Skynet 5 satellites were to be built, with insurance covering any launch loss; the MOD later decided to have a third satellite built in advance, and later still to have the third satellite launched to serve as an on-orbit spare, as well as an option to a fourth satellite, as a cheaper alternative to insurance.

In 2011, The MOD took ownership of a NATO satellite with two UHF channels, to support the additional demands from British involvement in the War in Afghanistan. Control of this satellite was incorporated into the Skynet 5 PFI contract.

The satellites are managed from a site named Hawthorn, a few hundred metres north of MOD Corsham, in partnership with MOD&#x27;s Defence Digital (previously Information Systems &amp; Services) who are based at MOD Corsham.

==== Expansion to near global coverage ====
In 2010, Paradigm announced it would lease the X-band (SHF) module on the Anik G1 commercial satellite at 107.3° West over the Pacific Ocean, covering the Americas and as far west as Hawaii, to complement Skynet system coverage. The three-channel, wide-beam X-band payload has performance similar to a Skynet 5 satellite, but without the military hardening. Anik G1 launched on 16 April 2013, improving the constellation&#x27;s X-band capacity to 2.2 GHz of throughput.

In 2015, Skynet 5A was moved from 6° East, where it reinforced Middle East coverage, to 95° East, near West Sumatra. This move was to extend the Skynet coverage eastward in the Indian Ocean and to the western Pacific Ocean. With this move and Anik G1, Skynet offers near global coverage, from 178° West to 163° East.

In 2016, a new Australian ground station was opened at Mawson Lakes, Adelaide, managed by Airbus in partnership with SpeedCast, an Australian provider for over 25 years which works with the Australian military at that base. This complements Airbus&#x27;s existing chain of ground stations in France, Germany, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States. The British High Commissioner Menna Rawlings said at the opening ceremony &quot;Territorial disputes over uninhabited rocks and reefs have the potential to generate enough friction in international affairs to spark a confrontation&quot;, alluding to the territorial disputes in the South China Sea.

Airbus Defence and Space signed a further three partners, Hughes Network Systems, Inmarsat and SpeedCast, into its Skynet partner programme who offer third-party Skynet services. The Skynet contract also allow Airbus to sell surplus bandwidth to NATO and allied governments, including the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States).

==== Technical specifications ====
The fleet of military X-band satellites have been specifically designed to support smaller, low powered, tactical terminals. Each Skynet 5 satellite is equipped with:

* High power 160W TWTAs on all transponders, giving 56 dBW peak EIRP in each transmit spot beam and 41 dBW peak EIRP in each global beam per transponder
* 15 active SHF / EHF transponders ranging in bandwidth from 20 GHz to 40 GHz
* Up to 9 UHF channels
* Multiple fully steerable downlink spot beams
* On Board Active Receive Antenna (OBARA) capable of generating multiple shaped uplink beams
* Flexible switching capability allowing connectivity between any uplink beam and at least two downlink beams
* Nuclear hardening, anti-jamming countermeasures and laser protection

=== Skynet 6 ===

In 2018, the MOD was specifying the replacement of Skynet 5, whose PFI programme ended in August 2022. Airbus Defence and Space will build a non-competitively sourced Skynet 6A satellite planned for a 2025 launch, as a transition to a new architecture. As of 2017, the PFI project was viewed as unlikely to be extended, as PFI contracting was then seen as generally poor value for taxpayers, and it had depleted MOD of satellite expertise which made specifying its replacement difficult.

Skynet 6A is based on the Airbus Eurostar Neo satellite bus, using electric orbit raising and station keeping propulsion, and built at Airbus Stevenage and Portsmouth, England. It uses more radio frequencies for communication, and will have more capacity and versatility than Skynet 5 satellites. A contract for over £500 million was agreed in July 2020, including launch, testing and related ground operations improvements. Due to the delay in agreeing the Skynet 6A contract, preliminary contracts for initial design and to manufacture long lead items had been agreed earlier to prevent end-date slippage. Manufacture of 6A started in October 2021, and a Falcon 9 launch was booked with SpaceX for 2025.

The vision for Skynet 6 is a flexible system architecture that combines UK government, allied and commercial satellites. The MOD has become a user of U.S. military constellations Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) and the Wideband Global Satcom (WGS) systems, and may become a partner in the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS). Part of the enhanced capability would be to support data links to unmanned aerial vehicles and F-35B Lightning II aircraft.

As of 2019, Skynet is the large part of the MOD Future Beyond Line of Sight Satellite Communications programme (FBLOS), which extends to 2041, and has four elements:
* Skynet 6A, a single transition satellite
* Service Delivery Wrap, a support contract to manage and control the Skynet constellation and ground infrastructure
* Skynet 6 Enduring Capability, to provide and operate communication satellites and ground infrastructure into the future
* Secure Telemetry, Tracking and Command (STT&amp;C), to provide assured UK control and management of satellites and their payloads into the future

On 3 July 2020, the UK Government announced that it had acquired a 45% stake in the OneWeb low Earth orbit satellite communications company, for US$500 million including a golden share to give it control over any future ownership sale. Analysts believe OneWeb will be incorporated into the Skynet 6 architecture. OneWeb satellites are already manufactured by a joint venture including Airbus Defence and Space, which positions the current Skynet operator well for future involvement in Skynet 6.

In 2021, a one-year transition was expected to start from the Airbus PFI contract to the new Service Delivery Wrap contract which will operate ground stations until a new generation of satellites under an Enduring Capability contract are launched from about 2028. This transition is expected to cost about £6 billion.

In February 2023, Babcock International won the Service Delivery Wrap support contract to operate and manage Skynet, including the ground infrastructure and integrating new user terminals, for six years from March 2024 at a cost of £400 million.

During 2023 contractors were preparing to bid on the SkyNet Enduring Capability programme, which is split into two contracts: the major one to deliver a constellation of up to three geostationary wideband satellite systems for launch from 2028 to 2030, and a smaller contract for a narrowband service for tactical battlefield access.

In 2025, the MOD gave a contract to Amazon subsidiary Kuiper Systems to study an advanced communications architecture using &quot;translator&quot; satellites to bridge between military, government and private satellites. U.S. DARPA has been working on a similar architecture.

== Information assurance ==
In early 1999, Reuters reported that the Skynet system was breached by a group of hackers who issued blackmail threats against the MOD. Duncan Campbell reported that the wire reports were wrong.
