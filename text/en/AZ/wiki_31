<text>The , Northeast region, , or consists of the northeastern portion of Honshu, the largest island of Japan. This traditional region consists of six prefectures (&quot;ken&quot;): Akita, Aomori, Fukushima, Iwate, Miyagi, and Yamagata.

Tōhoku retains a reputation as a remote, scenic region with a harsh climate. In the 20th century, tourism became a major industry in the Tōhoku region.

==History==
===Ancient and classical period===

In mythological times, the area was known as Azuma (吾妻, あづま) and corresponded to the area of Honshu occupied by the native Emishi and Ainu. The area was historically the Dewa and the Michinoku regions, a term first recorded in (654). There is some variation in modern usage of the term &quot;Michinoku&quot;.

Tōhoku&#x27;s initial historical settlement occurred between the seventh and ninth centuries, well after Japanese civilization and culture had become firmly established in central and southwestern Japan. The last stronghold of the indigenous Emishi on Honshu and the site of many battles, the region has maintained a degree of autonomy from Kyoto at various times throughout history.

The &quot;Northern Fujiwara&quot; (奥州藤原氏 &quot;Ōshū Fujiwara-shi&quot;) were a Japanese noble family that ruled the Tōhoku region during the 12th century as their own realm. They kept their independence vis-à-vis the Imperial Court in Kyoto by the strength of their warrior bands until they were overwhelmed by Minamoto no Yoritomo in 1189.

===Feudal period===
====Christianity in Tōhoku====
Date Masamune (1567–1636), feudal lord of Date clan, expanded trade in the Tōhoku region. Although initially faced with attacks by hostile clans, he managed to overcome them after a few defeats and eventually ruled one of the largest fiefdoms of the later Tokugawa shogunate. He built many palaces and worked on many projects to beautify the region. He is also known to have encouraged foreigners to come to his land. Even though he funded and promoted an envoy to establish relations with the Pope in Rome, he was likely motivated at least in part by a desire for foreign technology, similar to that of other lords, such as Oda Nobunaga. 
He showed sympathy for Christian missionaries and traders in Japan. In addition to allowing them to come and preach in his province, he also released the prisoner and missionary Padre Sotelo from the hands of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Date Masamune allowed Sotelo as well as other missionaries to practice their religion and win converts in Tōhoku.

Further, once Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543–1616) outlawed Christianity, Masamune reversed his position, and though disliking it, let Ieyasu persecute Christians in his domain. For 270 years, Tōhoku remained a place of tourism, trade and prosperity. Matsushima, for instance, a series of tiny islands, was praised for its beauty and serenity by the wandering haiku poet Matsuo Bashō.

===Early modern period===

The haiku poet Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694) wrote &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot; (&quot;The Narrow Road to the Deep North&quot;) during his travels through Tōhoku.

===Contemporary period===

In the 1960s, ironworks, steelmaking, cement, chemical industry, pulp, and petroleum refining industries began developing. The region is traditionally known as a less developed area of Japan.

The catastrophic 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011, inflicted massive damage along the east coast of this region, causing and was the costliest natural disaster ever which left 500,000 people homeless along with radioactive emissions from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.

==Geography==
Tōhoku, like most of Japan, is hilly or mountainous, with the Ōu Mountains running north–south. The inland location of many of the region&#x27;s lowlands has led to a concentration of much of the population there. Coupled with coastlines that do not favor seaport development, this settlement pattern resulted in a much greater than usual dependence on land and rail transportation. Low points in the central mountain range make communications between lowlands on either side of the range moderately easy.

Tōhoku was traditionally considered the granary of Japan because it supplied Sendai and the Tokyo-Yokohama market with rice and other farming commodities. Tōhoku provided 20 percent of the nation&#x27;s rice crop.
===Subdivision===
The most often used subdivision of the region is dividing it to consisting of Aomori, Akita, and Iwate Prefectures and consisting of Yamagata, Miyagi, and Fukushima Prefectures.

==Climate==
The climate is colder than in other parts of Honshū due to the stronger effect of the Siberian High, and permits only one crop a year on paddy fields. The Pacific coast of Tōhoku, however, is generally much less snowy than the region&#x27;s popular image and has among the smallest seasonal temperature variation in Japan. The city of Iwaki, for instance, has daily mean temperatures ranging from in January to in August.

==Demographics==
The population decline of Tōhoku, which began before the year 2000, has accelerated, now including previously dynamic Miyagi. Despite this, Sendai City has grown, in part due to relocations of people affected by the 2011 disaster. The population decline of Aomori, Iwate and Akita Prefectures, Honshu&#x27;s three northernmost, began in the early 1980s after an initial loss of population in the late 1950s. Fukushima Prefecture, prior to 1980, had traditionally been the most populated, but today Miyagi is the most populated and urban by far.

<text>The Swedish Social Democratic Party, formally the Swedish Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party ( , S or SAP), usually referred to as The Social Democrats ( ), is a social democratic political party in Sweden. The party is member of the Progressive Alliance and the Party of European Socialists.

Founded in 1889, the SAP is the country&#x27;s oldest and currently largest party. From the mid-1930s to the 1980s, the Social Democratic Party won more than 40% of the vote. From 1932 to 1976, the SAP was continuously in government. From 1982 to 2022, the party was in government with the exception of the periods 1991–1994 and 2006–2014. Since 2022, the party has been out of government. It participates in elections as &quot;The Workers&#x27; Party – The Social Democrats&quot; ( ). The first female PM in Swedish history, Magdalena Andersson, is the current leader of the Social Democratic Party.

== History ==
Founded in 1889 as a member of the Second International, a split occurred in 1917 when the left socialists split from the Social Democrats to form the Swedish Social Democratic Left Party (later the Communist Party of Sweden and now the Left Party). The words of honour as recorded by the 2001 party programme are &quot;freedom, equality, and solidarity&quot;. The party had influences from Marxism in its early days, but these were gradually removed in the years leading up to the split in 1917. Between 1923 and 1940, the party was a member of the Labour and Socialist International.

Swedish social democracy rose due to the extension of suffrage to the working class and the organizing of trade unions and other civic associations. Unlike in many other European countries, the Swedish socialist left was able to form a stable majority coalition during the early 20th century. Early on, in large part due to the leadership of Hjalmar Branting, the Swedish socialists adopted a flexible and pragmatic understanding of Marxism. They were also willing to form cross-class coalitions with liberals and farmers. Political scientist Sheri Berman also credits the Swedish Social Democratic success during the interwar years to the party&#x27;s adoption of Keynesianism during the Great Depression (which she contrasts with the Social Democratic Party of Germany&#x27;s reluctance towards Keynesian policies during the same time and the German Social Democrats&#x27; subsequent decline).

In 2007, the Social Democrats elected Mona Sahlin as their first female party leader. On 7 December 2009, the Social Democrats launched a political and electoral coalition with the Greens and the Left Party known as the Red–Greens. The parties contested the 2010 election on a joint manifesto, but lost the election to the incumbent centre-right coalition, The Alliance. On 26 November 2010, the Red–Green alliance was dissolved. The party is a member of the Progressive Alliance, the Party of European Socialists and SAMAK. The party was a member of the Socialist International until March 2017.

== Ideology, political impact and history ==

The party&#x27;s first chapter in its statutes says &quot;the intention of the Swedish Social Democratic Labour Party is the struggle towards Democratic Socialism&quot;, i.e. a society with a democratic economy based on the socialist principle &quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot;. Since the party held power of office for a majority of terms after its founding in 1889 through 2003, the ideology and policies of the SAP have had strong influence on Swedish politics. The Swedish social democratic ideology is partially an outgrowth of the strong and well-organized 1880s and 1890s working class emancipation, temperance and religious &quot;folkrörelser&quot; (folk movements), by which peasant and workers&#x27; organizations penetrated state structures early on and paved the way for electoral politics. In this way, Swedish social democratic ideology is inflected by a socialist tradition foregrounding widespread and individual human development.

In 1967, Gunnar Adler-Karlsson confidently likened the social democratic project to the successful social democratic effort to divest the king of all power but formal grandeur: &quot;Without dangerous and disruptive internal fights. ... After a few decades they [the capitalists] will then remain, perhaps formally as kings, but in reality as naked symbols of a passed and inferior development state.&quot;

The Social Democrats are strong supporters of egalitarianism and maintain a strong opposition to discrimination and racism. The party supports social welfare provision, paid for by progressive taxation. The party also supports a social corporatist economy involving the institutionalization of a social partnership system between capital and labour economic interest groups, with government oversight to resolve disputes between the two factions. Concerning constitutional issues, the Social Democrats advocate the abolition of monarchy.

=== Liberalism ===

Liberalism has also strongly infused social democratic ideology. Liberalism has oriented social democratic goals to security. Tage Erlander, prime minister from 1946 to 1969, described security as &quot;too big a problem for the individual to solve with only his own power&quot;. Up to the 1980s, when neoliberalism began to provide an alternative, aggressively pro-capitalist model for ensuring social quiescence, the SAP was able to secure capital&#x27;s co-operation by convincing capital that it shared the goals of increasing economic growth and reducing social friction. For many Social Democrats, Marxism is loosely held to be valuable for its emphasis on changing the world for a more just, better future. In 1889, Hjalmar Branting, leader of the SAP from its founding to his death in 1925, asserted: &quot;I believe that one benefits the workers so much more by forcing through reforms which alleviate and strengthen their position, than by saying that only a revolution can help them&quot;.

Some observers have argued that this liberal aspect has hardened into increasingly neoliberal ideology and policies, gradually maximizing the latitude of powerful market actors. Certainly, neoclassical economists have been firmly nudging the Social Democratic Party into capitulating to most of capital&#x27;s traditional preferences and prerogatives which they term &quot;modern industrial relations&quot;. Both socialist and liberal aspects of the party were influenced by the dual sympathies of early leader Hjalmar Branting and manifest in the party&#x27;s first actions, namely reducing the work day to eight hours and establishing the franchise for working-class people.

While some commentators have seen the party lose focus with the rise of SAP neoliberal study groups, the Swedish Social Democratic Party has for many years appealed to Swedes as innovative, capable and worthy of running the state. The Social Democrats became one of the most successful political parties in the world, with some structural advantages in addition to their auspicious birth within vibrant &quot;folkrörelser&quot;. At the close of the 19th century, liberals and socialists had to band together to augment establishment democracy which was at that point embarrassingly behind in Sweden and they could point to formal democratic advances elsewhere to motivate political action. In addition to being small, Sweden was a semi-peripheral country at the beginning of the 20th century, considered unimportant to competing global political factions, so it was permitted more independence while soon the existence of communist and capitalist superpowers allowed social democracy to flourish in the geo-political interstices. The SAP has the resource of sharing ideas and experiences and working with its sister parties throughout the Nordic countries. Sweden could also borrow and innovate upon ideas from English-language economists which was an advantage for the Social Democrats in the Great Depression, but more advantageous for the bourgeois parties in the 1980s and afterward.

=== Revisionism ===

Among the social movement tactics of the Swedish Social Democratic Party in the 20th century was its redefinition of &quot;socialization&quot; from &quot;common ownership of the means of production&quot; to increasing &quot;democratic influence over the economy&quot;. Starting out in a socialist-liberal coalition fighting for the vote, the Swedish Social Democrats defined socialism as the development of democracy—political and economic. On that basis, they could form coalitions, innovate and govern where other European social democratic parties became crippled and crumbled under right-wing regimes. The Swedish Social Democrats could count the middle class among their solidaristic working class constituency by recognizing the middle class as &quot;economically dependent&quot;, &quot;working people&quot;, or among the &quot;progressive citizens&quot;, rather than as sub-capitalists. The Social Democratic congress of 1932 established that &quot;[t]he party does not aim to support and help [one] working class at the expense of the others&quot;. In fact, with social democratic policies that refrained from supporting inefficient and low-profit businesses in favor of cultivating higher-quality working conditions as well as a strong commitment to public education, the middle class in Sweden became so large that the capitalist class has remained concentrated. Not only did the SAP fuse the growing middle class into their constituency, they also ingeniously forged periodic coalitions with small-scale farmers (as members of the &quot;exploited classes&quot;) to great strategic effect. The SAP version of socialist ideology allowed them to maintain a prescient view of the working class. The party&#x27;s 1932 election manifesto asserted that &quot;[the SAP] does not question whether those who have become capitalism&#x27;s victims are industrial workers, farmers, agricultural laborers, forestry workers, store clerks, civil servants or intellectuals&quot;.

While the SAP has worked more or less constructively with more radical left-wing parties in Sweden, the Social Democrats have borrowed from socialists some of their discourse and decreasingly the socialist understanding of the structurally compromised position of labor under capitalism. Even more creatively, the Social Democrats commandeered selected, transcendental images from such nationalists as Rudolf Kjellen in 1912, very effectively undercutting fascism&#x27;s appeal in Sweden. In this way, Per Albin Hansson declared that &quot;there is no more patriotic party than the [SAP since] the most patriotic act is to create a land in which all feel at home&quot;, famously igniting Swedes&#x27; innermost longing for transcendence with the 1928 idea of the Folkhem, or the People&#x27;s Home. The Social Democratic Party promoted Folkhemmet as a socialist home at a point in which the party turned its back on class struggle and the policy tool of nationalization. Hansson soothed that &quot;[t]he expansion of the party to a people&#x27;s party does not mean and must not mean a watering down of socialist demands&quot;. He further stated:

The basis of the home is community and togetherness. The good home does not recognize any privileged or neglected members, nor any favorite or stepchildren. In the good home there is equality, consideration, co-operation, and helpfulness. Applied to the great people&#x27;s and citizens&#x27; home this would mean the breaking down of all the social and economic barriers that now separate citizens into the privileged and the neglected, into the rulers and the dependents, into the rich and the poor, the propertied and the impoverished, the plunderers and the plundered. Swedish society is not yet the people&#x27;s home. There is a formal equality, equality of political rights, but from a social perspective, the class society remains, and from an economic perspective the dictatorship of the few prevails.

=== Social democracy ===
The Social Democratic Party is generally recognized as the main architect of the progressive taxation, fair trade, low-unemployment, active labor market policies (ALMP)-based Swedish welfare state that was developed in the years after World War II. Sweden emerged sound from the Great Depression with a brief, successful &quot;Keynesianism-before Keynes&quot; economic program advocated by Ernst Wigforss, a prominent Social Democrat who educated himself in economics by studying the work of the British radical Liberal economists. The social democratic labor market policies, or ALMPs, were developed in the 1940s and 1950s by LO (Landsorganisationen i Sverige, the blue-collar union federation) economists Gösta Rehn and Rudolf Meidner. The Rehn-Meidner model featured the centralized system of wage bargaining that aimed to both set wages at a just level and promote business efficiency and productivity. With the pre-1983 cooperation of capital and labor federations that bargained independently of the state, the state determined that wages would be higher than the market would set in firms that were inefficient or uncompetitive and lower than the market would set in firms that were highly productive and competitive. Workers were compensated with state-sponsored retraining and relocating. At the same time, the state reformed wages to the goal of &quot;equal pay for equal work&quot;, eliminated unemployment, also known as (&quot;the reserve army of labor&quot;) as a disciplinary device and kept incomes consistently rising while taxing progressively and pooling social wealth to deliver services through local governments. Social Democratic policy has traditionally emphasized a state spending structure, whereby public services are supplied via local government as opposed to emphasizing social insurance program transfers.

These social democratic policies have had international influence. The early Swedish red–green coalition encouraged Nordic-networked socialists in the state of Minnesota to dedicate efforts to building a similarly potent labor-farmer alliance that put the socialists in the governorship, running statewide model innovative anti-racism programs in the early years of the 20th century and enabled federal forest managers in the state of Minnesota to practice a precocious ecological-socialism before U.S. Democratic Party reformers appropriated the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party infrastructure to the liberal Democratic Party in 1944.

Under the Social Democrats&#x27; administration, Sweden retained neutrality as a foreign policy guideline during the wars of the 20th century, including the Cold War. Neutrality preserved the Swedish economy and boosted Sweden&#x27;s economic competitiveness in the first half of the 20th century as other European countries&#x27; economies were devastated by war. Under Olof Palme&#x27;s Social Democratic leadership, Sweden further aggravated the hostility of United States’ political conservatives when Palme openly denounced the American aggression in Vietnam. President Richard Nixon suspended diplomatic ties with the social democratic country, because of its denouncement of the war. In 2003, top-ranking Social Democratic Party politician Anna Lindh—who criticized the American-led invasion of Iraq as well as both Israeli and Palestinian atrocities and who was the lead figure in promoting the European Union in Sweden—was publicly assassinated in Stockholm. As Lindh was to succeed Göran Persson in the party leadership, her death was deeply disruptive to the party as well as to the campaign to promote the adoption of the EMU (euro) in Sweden. The neutrality policy has changed with the contemporary ascendance of the centre-right coalition as Sweden had committed troops to support the United States and United Kingdom&#x27;s previous interventions in Afghanistan.

=== From Rehn–Meidner to neoliberalism ===
Because the Rehn–Meidner model allowed capitalists owning very productive and efficient firms to retain excess profits at the expense of the firms&#x27; workers, thus exacerbating inequality, workers in these companies began to ask for a share of the profits in the 1970s, just as women working in the state sector began to assert pressure for better wages. Meidner established a study committee that came up with a 1976 proposal that entailed transferring the excess profits into investment funds controlled by the workers in the firms, with the intention that the companies’ employment would increase and thus pay more workers higher wages, rather than increasing the wealth of the company owners and managers. Capitalists immediately distinguished this proposal as socialism, and launched an unprecedented opposition—including calling off the class compromise established in the 1938 Saltsjöbaden Agreement.

The 1980s were a very turbulent time in Sweden that initiated the occasional decline of Social Democratic Party rule. In the 1980s, pillars of Swedish industry were massively restructured. Shipbuilding was discontinued, wood pulp was integrated into modernized paper production, the steel industry was concentrated and specialized and mechanical engineering was digitalized. In 1986, Olof Palme, one of the Social Democratic Party&#x27;s strongest champions of democracy and egalitarianism, was assassinated. Swedish capital was increasingly moving Swedish investment into other European countries as the European Union coalesced and a hegemonic consensus was forming among the elite financial community while progressive taxation and pro-egalitarian redistribution became economic heresy. A leading proponent of capital&#x27;s cause at the time, Social Democrat Finance Minister Kjell-Olof Feldt reminisced in an interview: &quot;The negative inheritance I received from my predecessor Gunnar Sträng (Minister of Finance, 1955–1976) was a strongly progressive tax system with high marginal taxes. This was supposed to bring about a just and equal society. But I eventually came to the opinion that it simply didn&#x27;t work out that way. Progressive taxes created instead a society of wranglers, cheaters, peculiar manipulations, false ambitions and new injustices. It took me at least a decade to get a part of the party to see this&quot;. With the capitalist confederation&#x27;s defection from the 1938 Saltsjöbaden Agreement and Swedish capital investing in other European countries rather than Sweden as well as the global rise of neoliberal political-economic hegemony, the Social Democratic Party backed away from the progressive Meidner reform.

The economic crisis in the 1990s has been widely cited in the Anglo-American press as a social democratic failure, but it is important to note that not only did profit rates begin to fall worldwide after the 1960s, this period also saw neoliberal ascendance in Social Democratic ideology and policies as well as the rise of bourgeois coalition rule in place of the Social Democrats. In the 1980s the Social Democratic party&#x27;s neoliberal measures—such as depressing and deregulating the currency to prop up Swedish exports during the economic restructuring and transition, dropping of corporate taxation and taxation on high income-earners and switching from anti-unemployment policies to anti-inflationary policies—were exacerbated by the international recession, unchecked currency speculation and by a Moderate Party government led by Carl Bildt (1991–1994), creating the fiscal crisis of the early 1990s. According to Cerra and Saxena (2005) almost all of the fall in the substantial GDP per capita lead over the OECD average that Sweden enjoyed through the 1960-1990 period can be attributed to the Swedish financial crisis, and there is no evidence for a substantial negative growth impact from egalitarian policies as in the &#x27;Eurosclerosis&#x27; hypothesis. The financial crisis can in turn be explained by policy errors. For example, in the late 1980s high inflation interacted with the tax code to produce negative real interest rates and an investment boom. However, in 1990-1991 the highly trade exposed Swedish economy was impacted by the global downturn, but the commitment to the fixed exchange rate now required a rapid shift to high real interest rates in order to defend the peg, collapsing asset markets and fixed investment. The household savings rate rose appreciably, exacerbated by fears of welfare state retrenchment, worsening the fall in aggregate demand. Unemployment rose rapidly, and the banking sector went into crisis as the nonperforming rate rose sharply, prompting a large bailout program. According to Cerra and Saxena, the deep recession had large and permanent negative effects on the Swedish GDP, which is consistent with other research suggesting that a financial crisis can have extremely persistent effects.
When the Social Democrats returned to power in 1994, they responded to the fiscal crisis by stabilizing the currency—and by curtailing the welfare state and privatizing the public sector and goods as governments did in many countries influenced by conservative Milton Friedman, the Chicago School of political and economic thought and the global neoliberal movement. Social Democratic Party leaders—including Göran Persson, Mona Sahlin and Anna Lindh—promoted European Union (EU) membership and the Swedish referendum passed by 52–48% in favor of joining the EU on 14 August 1994. Liberal leader Lars Leijonborg at his 2007 retirement could recall the 1990s as a golden age of liberalism in which the Social Democrats were under the expanding influence of the Liberals and its partners in the centre-right political coalition. Leijonborg recounted neoliberal victories such as the growth of private schooling and the proliferation of private, for-profit radio and television. It has been argued that the Swedish Social Democrats&#x27; Third Way pension reforms have been more successful than those enacted by the German Social Democrats.

=== 21st century ===
In the 21st century, many of the aspects of the social democratic welfare state continued to function at a high level, due in no small part to the high rate of unionization in Sweden, the independence of unions in the wage-setting and the exemplary competency of the female public sector workforce as well as widespread public support for welfare. The Social Democrats initiated studies on the effects of the neoliberal changes and the picture that emerged from those findings allowed the party to reduce many tax expenditures, slightly increase taxes on high income-earners and significantly reduce taxes on food. The Social Democratic Finance Minister increased spending on child support and continued to pay down the acquired public debt. By 1998, the Swedish macro-economy recovered from the 1980s industrial restructuring and the currency policy excesses. At the turn of the 21st century, Sweden had a well-regarded, generally robust economy and the average quality of life after government transfers was very high, inequality was low and the (Gini coefficient was .28) and social mobility was high (compared to the affluent Anglo-American and Central European countries).

The Social Democratic Party pursues environmentalist and feminist policies which promote healthful and humane conditions. Feminist policies formed and implemented by the Social Democratic Party along with the Green Party and the Left Party (which made an arrangement with the Social Democrats to support the government while not forming a coalition), include paid maternity and paternity leave, high employment for women in the public sector, combining flexible work with living wages and benefits, providing public support for women in their traditional responsibilities for care giving and policies to stimulate women&#x27;s political participation and leadership. Reviewing policies and institutional practices for their impact on women had become common in social democratic governance.

The Social Democratic Party was defeated in 2006 by the centre-right Alliance for Sweden coalition. Mona Sahlin succeeded Göran Persson as party leader in 2007, becoming the party&#x27;s first female party leader. Prior to the 2010 Swedish general election, the Social Democratic Party formed a cooperation with the Green Party and the Left Party culminating in the Red–Green alliance. The cooperation was dissolved following another defeat in 2010, throwing the party in to its longest period in opposition since before 1936. Sahlin announced her resignation following the 2010 defeat and she was succeeded by Håkan Juholt in 2011. Initially, his leadership gave a rise in the opinion polls before being involved in a scandal surrounding benefits from parliament which after a period culminated in his resignation. Sahlin and Juholt become the first SPA party leaders since Claes Tholin, who was party leader 1896–1907, to not become Prime Ministers of Sweden.

Stefan Löfven, elected by the party council, succeeded Juholt as party leader. Löfven led the Social Democratic Party into the 2014 European Parliament election which resulted in the party&#x27;s worst electoral results at national level since universal suffrage was introduced in 1921. He then led the party into the 2014 Swedish general election which resulted in the party&#x27;s second worst election result to the Riksdag since universal suffrage was introduced in 1921. With a hung parliament, Löfven formed a minority coalition government with the Green Party. On 2 October 2014, the Riksdag approved Löfven to become the country&#x27;s Prime Minister and he took office on 3 October 2014 alongside his Cabinet. The Social Democratic Party and the Green Party voted in favour of Löfvén becoming Prime Minister while the Left Party, a close ally of the SAP, abstained. The oppositional Alliance-parties also abstained while the Sweden Democrats voted against.

In the 2018 Swedish general election, the Social Democrats&#x27; vote share fell to 28.3 percent, its lowest level of support since 1911. Nevertheless, a Social Democrat and Green Party coalition government was formed in January 2019. Relying on support of the Centre Party and Liberals, it was one of the weakest governments in Swedish history.

In August 2021, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven announced his resignation and finance minister Magdalena Andersson was elected as the new head of Sweden&#x27;s ruling Social Democrats in November 2021. On 30 November 2021, Magdalena Andersson became Sweden&#x27;s first female prime minister. She formed a minority government made up of only her Social Democrats. Her plan for forming a new coalition government with the Green Party was unsuccessful because her budget proposal failed to pass.

On 18 October 2022, conservative leader Ulf Kristersson became the new Prime Minister to succeed Magdalena Andersson, meaning that the Social Democratic Party, although still Sweden&#x27;s largest party, would be in the opposition.

== Party organisation and voter base ==
SAP has been the largest party in the Riksdag since 1914. The member base is diverse, but it prominently features organized blue-collar workers and public sector employees. The party has a close, historical relationship with the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO). As a corporatist organ, it has also formed policy in compromise mediation with employers&#x27; associations (primarily the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise and its predecessors) as well as trade unions.

Organisations within the Swedish Social Democratic movement include:
* The Social Democratic Women in Sweden (&quot;S-kvinnor&quot;) organizes women.
* The Swedish Social Democratic Youth League organizes youth.
* The Social Democratic Students of Sweden organizes university students.
* The Religious Social Democrats of Sweden organizes all members with religious beliefs. 
* The LGBT Social Democrats of Sweden ( ) organizes queer people.

The SAP had its golden age during the mid-1930s to mid-1980s when in half of all general elections it received between 44.6% and 46.2% (averaging 45.3%) of the votes, making it one of the most successful parties in the history of the liberal-democratic world.

In two of the general elections in 1940 and 1968, it got more than 50% of the votes, although both cases had special circumstances. In 1940, all established Swedish parties, except for the Communist Party of Sweden (SKP), participated in a coalition government due to the pressures of the Second World War, and it led to voters most likely wanting one party to be in majority to give a parliament that could not be hung. In 1944, the tides of the war had turned and the Allied nations looked to win, giving voters more confidence in voting by preference and explaining the more normal electoral result of 46.6%. The previously excluded SKP also achieved a result of 10.3% in this election. In 1968, the established Communists, most likely due to bad press about the Soviets overtaking of Czechoslovakia (Prague Spring), got a historically bad result of 3% of the votes while the SAP enjoyed 50.1% and an absolute majority in parliament. Only in a fairly brief period between the elections of 1973 to 1979 did the SAP get below the normal interval of 44.6% to 46.2%, instead scoring an average of 43.2%, losing in 1976 (the first time in 44 years) and again just barely in 1979. However, the Social Democrats won back power in 1982 with a normal result of 45.6%.

The voter base consists of a diverse swathe of people throughout Swedish society, although it is particularly strong amongst organised blue-collar workers.

=== Decline since 2006 ===
In the 2006 Swedish general election, the SAP received the smallest share of votes (34.99%) ever in a Swedish general election with universal suffrage, resulting in the loss of office to the opposition, the centre-right coalition Alliance for Sweden. Among the support that the SAP lost was the vote of pensioners (down 10% from 2002) and blue-collar trade unionists (down 5%). The combined SAP and Left Party vote of citizens with non-Nordic foreign backgrounds sank from 73% in 2002 to 48% in 2006. Stockholm County typically votes for the centre-right parties and only 23% of Stockholm City residents voted for the SAP in 2006.

From 2006 to 2014, the SAP lost two consecutive terms to the centre-right Alliance due to the centrist liberal attitudes of then-Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt attracting some of the SAP voters. In 2010, 2014 and 2018, the vote share of SAP dramatically declined, with some of these votes being lost to the right-wing populist party, Sweden Democrats.

In the 2018 Swedish general election, the Social Democrats&#x27; vote share fell to 28.3 percent, its lowest level of support since 1908.

In the 2022 Swedish general election, the Social Democrats remained Sweden&#x27;s largest party, with 30.3% of the vote, however the right-wing bloc won a slim majority in the parliament.

<text>The Moderate Party ( , , M), commonly referred to as the Moderates ( ), is a liberal-conservative political party in Sweden. The party generally supports tax cuts, the free market, civil liberties and economic liberalism. Globally, it is a full member of the International Democracy Union and the European People&#x27;s Party.

The party was founded in 1904 as the General Electoral League ( ) by a group of conservatives in the Riksdag, the Swedish parliament. The party was later known as The Right ( ; 1938–1952) and Right Party ( ; 1952–1969). During this time, the party was usually called the Conservative Party outside of Sweden.

After holding minor posts in centre-right governments, the Moderates eventually became the leading opposition party to the Swedish Social Democratic Party and since then those two parties have dominated Swedish politics. After the 1991 Swedish general election, party leader Carl Bildt formed a minority government, the first administration since 1930 to be headed by a member of the party, which lasted three years. The party returned to government under leader and Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, after the 2006 and 2010 general elections. In 2010, the party was the leading member of the Alliance, a centre-right coalition, along with the Centre Party (C), the Christian Democrats (KD) and the Liberal People&#x27;s Party (L), and obtained its best result ever (30.1%), despite the coalition not being able to obtain majority.

The current chairman of the party, Ulf Kristersson, was elected at a special party congress on 1 October 2017, following Anna Kinberg Batra&#x27;s sudden resignation. Kinberg Batra had replaced Reinfeldt, Prime Minister from 2006 to 2014. Under Reinfeldt&#x27;s leadership, the party moved more towards the centre. Under Kristersson&#x27;s leadership, the party moved back to the right and opened up to the Sweden Democrats (SD) following the 2018 Swedish general election. Having formed in late 2021 an informal right-wing alliance with SD and former Alliance members, KD and L, with Kristersson as the prime ministerial candidate, the right-wing bloc obtained a narrow win in the 2022 Swedish general election.

== History ==
=== General Electoral League (1904–1938) ===
The party was founded on 17 October 1904 in a restaurant called &quot;Runan&quot; in Stockholm. The intention was to start a campaign organization in support of the group of Conservatives which had emerged in the Riksdag. During the 19th century conservatives had organised themselves in the Riksdag but there was no party to support them. The Swedish right was also threatened by the rise of the Swedish Social Democratic Party (founded in 1889) and the Liberals (1902). The party was called the &quot;General Electoral League&quot; ().

At first, the party was clearly nationalist and staunchly conservative. The importance of a strong defence was underlined and other societal institutions embraced by the party were the monarchy and the state of law. The party initially held ia protectionist view towards the economy; tariffs were widely supported as well as interventionist economical measures such as agricultural subsidies. In the defence policy crisis in 1914 (which overturned the parliamentary Liberal government), the party sided with King Gustaf V but stopped short of accepting a right-wing government by royal appointment, instead opting for an independent-conservative &quot;war cabinet&quot; under Hjalmar Hammarskjöld which was eventually overturned in favour of a Liberal-Social Democratic majority coalition government and thus the breakthrough of parliamentary rule, albeit reluctantly embraced by the right.Arvid Lindman (often called &quot;The Admiral&quot;) became influential in the party and served two terms as Prime Minister of Sweden, before and after the enactment of universal suffrage. In 1907, he proposed universal male suffrage to the parliament and in 1912 he was formally elected leader. But the party voted against universal suffrage and the party again voted against women&#x27;s right to vote. It was only because the party was in the minority that Sweden was able to grant the right to vote for all, pushed through by the Liberals and the Social Democrats (the left), against the objections of the right. Although not one of the founders of the party and not a prominent ideologist, Lindman and his achievements as a leader are often appreciated as being of great importance to the new party. His leadership was marked by a consolidation of the Swedish right, and by transforming the party into a modern, effective, political movement. Lindman was a very pragmatic politician, but without losing his principles. He was a formidable negotiator and peace broker. For this, he was widely respected, even by his fiercest political opponents and when he resigned and left the parliament in 1935, the leader of the Social Democrats, Per Albin Hansson, expressed his &quot;honest thanks over the battle lines&quot;.

From the beginning of the 20th century, social democracy and the labour movement rose to replace liberalism as the major political force for radical reforms. The Moderate Party intensified its opposition to socialism during the leadership of Lindman—the importance of continuance and strengthening national business were cornerstones. But at the same time, recent social issues gained significant political attention; by appeasing the working class, the party also hoped to reduce the threat of revolutionary tendencies. During the governments led by Lindman, several reforms for social progress were made, and it was his first government that initiated the public state pension.
In the 1920s, the Swedish right slowly started to move towards a classical liberal view on economic issues, mainly under the influence of the liberal economist Gustav Cassel, but the economic downturn following the Great Depression frustrated the possible liberal transition of their economic policy. Before that occurred the party gained its greatest success yet with 29.4% in the general election of 1928, often called the &quot;Cossack Election&quot;, on a clearly anti-socialist programme. The government later formed by the party did not accept the concept of the market economy but continued the protectionist policy by generous financial aid. The government also began complete regulation of agriculture. Production associations, with the objective to administer the regulations and running monopolies on imports, were also established during the period. All this made for a corporate control of the Swedish economy unsurpassed since the popularisation of liberalism at the end of the 19th century. The government of Lindman fell in 1930 after the Social Democrats and the Freeminded People&#x27;s Party had blocked a proposition for a raised customs duty on grain.

The 1930s saw the party in conflict over how to relate to the rising threat of National Socialism and Fascism. Its loosely affiliated youth organisation, the National Youth League of Sweden () was openly pro-Nazi and set up uniformed &quot;fighting groups&quot; to combat political enemies on the streets. The mother party did not like this development, with Lindman clearly stating that pro-Nazi views were not to be accepted in the party, and in 1933 the National Youth League was separated from the party. While the party set up a new youth league, which came to be called Moderate Youth League or &quot;The Young Swedes&quot; (currently the largest youth league in Sweden in terms of membership), the core of the old one (in spite of some districts, such as Young Swedes-Gothenburg joining the new one) set up its own party—the National League of Sweden—which fought elections as an openly pro-Nazi party and temporarily gained parliamentary representation in the shape of three rightist MPs.

=== National Organization of the Right (1938–1952) ===
The party participated in the third cabinet of Per Albin Hansson during the Second World War. It was a grand coalition including all major parties, only excluding the Communist Party and the pro-Nazi Socialist Party, both parties being members of the parliament at this time.

In 1934, the Social Democrats formed a new government, and except for the World War II era, would stay in power until 1976. From having been a ruling party, the General Electoral League turned into a bastion of right-wing opposition, and in 1938 it was renamed the National Organization of the Right ( ), a name that would stay until 1952. Outside Sweden, the party was typically called the &quot;Conservative Party&quot;.

After the Second World War, the party gradually lost support and the Liberals rose to become the second most popular party after the Social Democrats.

=== Conservative Party (1952–1969) ===

At the beginning of the 1950s, the party re-emerged after being renamed the Rightist Party (); its name outside Sweden remained &quot;Conservative Party.&quot; Under the leadership of Jarl Hjalmarson (1950–1961) the party became a prominent voice against the rising levels of taxation and a defender of private ownership from, what the party saw as, the growing tendencies of state centralization.

The party had significant success in the elections during the 1950s and became the largest party of the opposition in 1958. However, the next decade brought changes to the political climate of Sweden. The election of 1968 gave the Social Democrats an absolute majority in the parliament and made the Rightist Party into the smallest party of the opposition.

=== Moderate Party (1969–present) ===

By 1968, the dominance of the Social Democratic Party and 24 years of trailing the liberal People&#x27;s Party among the opposition bloc had pushed the party to the edge of political relevance. Seeking to shed its conservative image, in 1969, the party changed its name to the Moderate Coalition Party (, generally just referred to as ) or just the Moderate Party.

In 1970, Gösta Bohman was elected leader of the Moderate Party. During his leadership the party continued its gradual movement from nationalist traditionalist conservatism towards internationalist liberal conservatism, calling for Swedish membership in the EEC since the 1960s and in practice adopting most policies affiliated with classical liberalism. It also adopted a much more liberal social outlook, which was seen as a key factor in the foundation of the Christian Democratic Gathering in 1964, a socially conservative party. Bohman proved a successful leader, and helped lead the non-socialist opposition to victory in the 1976 election.

The Moderate Party joined the government under Thorbjörn Fälldin, with Gösta Bohman as Minister of Economy. The non-socialist parties managed to remain in power until 1982 in different constellations, but the election of 1979 again made the Moderate Party become the second most popular after the Social Democrats, a position it has held since then. Gösta Bohman was in 1981 replaced by Ulf Adelsohn.

In 1986, Carl Bildt was elected leader of the party. A son-in-law of Bohman, he managed to lead the party to an election victory in 1991. The Moderate Party led a center-right coalition between 1991 and 1994, with Bildt serving as the first conservative Prime Minister since Arvid Lindman. The cabinet of Carl Bildt did much to reform the Swedish government: they cut taxes, cut public spending, introduced voucher schools, made it possible for counties to privatize health care, liberalised markets for telecommunications and energy, and privatised former publicly owned companies (further deregulations and privatisations were carried out by the following Social Democratic Cabinet of Göran Persson). The negotiations for membership with the European Union were also finalized.

The party gained votes in 1994, but the governing coalition lost its majority. While Bildt stayed on as the Moderate Party leader, failing to unite with the Greens, the non-socialist parties failed to return to government after the election in 1998 as well. Bo Lundgren replaced him and led the party in the disastrous general election of 2002, much owed to his alleged neoliberal stances, for which Lundgren continued to receive praise from younger members. Former head of the Moderate Youth Fredrik Reinfeldt was elected as the new party leader in 2003.

Prior to the 2006 general election, the Moderate Party adjusted its position in the political spectrum, moving towards the centre-right. To reflect these changes, the party&#x27;s unofficial name was altered to The New Moderates (Swedish: ). This has included focus on proactive measures against unemployment, lower taxes combined with reforms to strengthen the Swedish welfare state. The Moderate Party has since 2006 used the slogan &quot;the Swedish Workers&#x27; Party&quot;, a slogan formerly synonymous with the Social Democrats.

In the 2006 general election, the Moderate Party enjoyed its best result since 1928 with 26.2% of the votes. The Moderate Party had formed the Alliance for Sweden, a political and electoral alliance, along with the Centre Party, the Liberal People&#x27;s Party and the Christian Democrats prior to this election. After the election, the Alliance for Sweden was able to form a coalition government. Party leader Fredrik Reinfeldt took office as Prime Minister of Sweden on 6 October 2006 along with his cabinet. In the 2010 general election, the Moderate Party performed their best results, since the introduction of universal suffrage in 1919, with 30.1% of the votes. However, the minor parties in the Alliance performed relatively poorly, and the Reinfeldt cabinet continued in office as a minority government.

He is the longest-serving non–Social Democrat Prime Minister since Erik Gustaf Boström who left office in 1900.

In the 2014 European elections, the Moderate Party came in third place nationally with 13.6% of the vote, returning three MEPs.

In the 2014 general election, the Red-Green coalition outpolled Reinfeldt&#x27;s incumbent Alliance coalition, prompting its resignation. The Social Democrat Stefan Löfven became Prime Minister on 3 October 2014. The Moderate Party performed reasonably well also in the 2014 election, making Reinfeldt its most successful leader with three of their four best election results since 1932. Anna Kinberg Batra was elected to succeed Reinfeldt as party leader on 10 January 2015. Ulf Kristersson succeeded Kinberg-Batra on 1 October 2017.

The Moderate Party made its worst election result since 2002 in the 2018 general election. Ulf Kristersson announced that the party would &quot;create a new Swedish Model&quot; at the Moderate Party Congress on 5 April 2019 and also that the party would be phasing out the New Moderates name. The party also presented its new logo, the old &quot;M&quot; logo which was used between 1972 and 2006 was adopted again. The change in logo was seen by analysts as a way to show that the party breaks with Reinfeldt&#x27;s policies. Ulf Kristersson has also been critical of multiculturalism.

Kristersson held a meeting in December 2019 with Jimmie Åkesson, leader of the Sweden Democrats, and said that he would cooperate with them in parliament. The anti-immigration party had previously been subject to a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; by all other parties, with Kristersson himself ruling out dialogue with them ahead of the 2018 elections. According to Ann-Cathrine Jungar of Södertörn University, this put Sweden in line with several other European countries in which the centre-right and nationalist-right parties cooperate.

In October 2022, the Tidö Agreement was formed, which led to the formation of the Kristersson Cabinet as Sweden&#x27;s government. On 18 October 2022, Ulf Kristersson became the new Prime Minister of Sweden. The Moderates formed a centre-right coalition with the Christian Democrats and the Liberals, backed by the Sweden Democrats. Soon after his appointment as foreign minister, Tobias Billström of the Moderate Party, announced that Sweden will renounce &quot;feminist foreign policy&quot;, implemented by the previous left-wing government. 

In 2024, new laws proposed by the Kristersson Cabinet to combat Sweden&#x27;s criminality crisis took in effect including harder penalties against weapons offences, breach of the permit obligation for explosive goods, arms smuggling and smuggling of explosive goods. Other laws gave increased opportunities to the police to use covert means of coercion to prevent and investigate serious crime, tougher border controls and extended power to security guards. On 20 February 2024, the Kristersson cabinet sent the largest military support package to Ukraine. During Kristerssons Premiership, Sweden ended longstanding neutrality to become a NATO member on 7 March.

== Ideology and political positions ==

The Moderate Party states that its ideology is a mix of liberalism and conservatism, and corresponds to what is called liberal conservatism. As is common in European centre-right and conservative parties, the term &quot;liberalism&quot; in Sweden refers to the traditional meaning of classical liberalism rather than progressivism or social liberalism in countries such as the United States.

The party supports free markets and personal freedom and has historically been the essential force for privatisation, deregulation, lowering tax rates, and a reduction of the public-sector growth rate. Other issues emphasized by the party are such as actions against violent crime and sex crime, increasing and promoting the value of working, and quality in the educational system. The party supports same-sex marriage in Sweden and Sweden&#x27;s membership in the European Union. The Moderate Party considers itself as a &quot;green-right&quot; party.

The party campaigned for changing currency to the euro in the 2003 referendum. As of 2013, the party was still in favor of the euro, but it expressed that the issue of a membership of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union and the eurozone would not be relevant until the member states have met certain strict requirements set up by the party in regard to budget deficits. In the 2024 EU elections, the Moderate Party proposed making abortion constitutionally protected in Europe.

After Fredrik Reinfeldt became leader, the party slowly moved further towards the political centre and also adopted pragmatic views. The party abandoned several of its old key features such as a proportional income tax and increased military spending. Criticism of the labour laws, its former characteristic which was neoliberal, was changed towards conserving the Swedish model and a careful embracing of balance on the labour market.

With the ascension of Anna Kinberg Batra as party leader, the party adjusted its position in the political spectrum and moved back towards the political right. The party abandoned its previously liberal stance on immigration, notably manifested by Fredrik Reinfeldt&#x27;s summer speech in 2014 in which he appealed for &quot;open hearts&quot; to meet the expected migrant waves. The party supports border controls and tougher rules for immigrants, including temporary residence permits, stricter requirements for family reunification and cuts in welfare benefits. Swedish values was a recurring subject in Anna Kindberg Batra&#x27;s speech at the Almedalen Week in 2016, and she said that immigrants should make efforts to learn the Swedish language and take part of Swedish societal orientation, or risk getting reduced benefits and harder to get permanent residence permits. Since 2015, the party has taken up its demand for increased military spending, and has supported the re-introduction of mandatory military service, inactivated in Sweden under Fredrik Reinfeldt in 2010.

The party is in favour of Swedish membership of NATO and supported Sweden&#x27;s application for membership. The party expressed a wish that a membership is applied for together with Finland which is what happened in May 2022.

<text>Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf (; , born 30 July 1940) is an Iraqi former diplomat and politician. He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1992 to 2001. He came to worldwide prominence around the 2003 invasion of Iraq, during which he was the Minister of Information under Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, acting as spokesman for the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party and Saddam&#x27;s government. He has also been nicknamed Baghdad Bob or Comical Ali (a play on &quot;Chemical Ali&quot;) for his notable and colorful television appearances as the Information Minister of Iraq.

== Early life and career ==
Al-Sahhaf was born in Hilla, near Karbala, to a Shi&#x27;ite Arab family. After studying journalism at Baghdad University, he graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in English literature. He planned to become an English teacher before joining the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party in 1963. In the early days of Ba&#x27;athist governance, he read out regular announcements of recently executed Iraqis on state television.

He served as an ambassador to Sweden, Burma, the United Nations and Italy, before returning to Iraq to serve as Foreign Minister in 1992. The reasons for his removal as Foreign Minister in April 2001 are unclear, but his achievements in the position were often claimed to be less satisfactory than that of his predecessor, Tariq Aziz. At least one report suggests that Uday Hussein, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s son, was responsible for the removal.

== Invasion of Iraq ==
===Nicknames===
Al-Sahhaf is known for his daily press briefings in Baghdad during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. His colorful appearances caused him to be nicknamed &quot;Baghdad Bob&quot; (in the style of previous propagandists with geographical aliases—some of them alliterative, such as &quot;Hanoi Hannah&quot; and &quot;Seoul City Sue&quot;) by commentators in the United States. He was nicknamed &quot;Comical Ali&quot; by commentators in the United Kingdom; commentators in Italy similarly nicknamed him &quot;Alì il Comico&quot;. These nicknames were given because he made statements about the conflict that were wildly at odds with reality, and western media treated him as a parody during the initial stages of the Iraq War.

===Announcements===
His pronouncements included claims that American soldiers were committing suicide &quot;by the hundreds&quot; outside the city, and denial that there were any American tanks in Baghdad, when in fact they were only several hundred meters away from the press conference where he was speaking and the combat sounds of nearing American troops could already be heard in the background. On another occasion, he spoke of the disastrous outcomes of previous foreign attempts to invade Iraq, citing an unspecified Western history book and inviting the journalists present to come to his home to read it. His last public appearance as Information Minister was on 8 April 2003, when he said that the Americans &quot;are going to surrender or be burned in their tanks. They will surrender; it is they who will surrender&quot;. When asked where he had gotten his information, he replied, &quot;authentic sources—many authentic sources&quot;. He pointed out that he &quot;was a professional, doing his job&quot;.

He frequently used the word &quot;‘ulūj&quot; (), an obscure and particularly insulting term for infidels, to describe the American forces in Iraq. This caused some debate in the Arabic-language media about the exact meaning of the word, with most concluding it meant &quot;bloodsucking insect&quot;. In an August 2003 interview on Abu Dhabi TV, al-Sahhaf said it was an archaic term attributed to Umar ibn Al-Khattāb.

US intelligence analysts later concluded that Al-Sahhaf confidently made false statements because he genuinely believed in what he was saying. As the American forces approached Baghdad, the Iraqi army falsely reported that they had successfully counterattacked US forces, destroying numerous tanks and killing hundreds of American troops. Army Col. Steve Boltz, the deputy chief of intelligence for V Corps, expressed that they held the belief that Al-Sahhaf sincerely held the information he reported to be true. Boltz theorized that because Saddam&#x27;s regime was known for frequently punishing those who delivered bad news, military officers would fabricate reports about the battlefield situation. This systemic self-deception within the Iraqi hierarchy led to a surprising lack of awareness when the Americans entered the capital, with some captured Iraqi officers later bewilderingly admitting that they had no idea that the US forces had been so close.

Al-Sahhaf gained something of a cult following in the West, appearing on T-shirts, cartoons, and in Internet phenomena. In the UK, a DVD documentary was sold about his exploits and televised interviews, called &quot;Comical Ali&quot;.

==Post-war life==
On 25 June 2003, British newspaper the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported that al-Sahhaf had been captured by coalition troops at a roadblock in Baghdad. The report was not confirmed by military authorities and was denied by al-Sahhaf&#x27;s family through Abu Dhabi TV. The next day, al-Sahhaf recorded an interview for Riyadh-based news channel al-Arabiya. He was reportedly paid as much as US$200,000 for the television interview, during which he appeared very withdrawn, in contrast with the bombastic persona he projected during the war. Many of his answers consisted of a simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. He refused to speculate on the causes of the downfall of the Iraqi government and answered only &quot;history will tell&quot; when asked if video clips purporting to prove that Saddam Hussein was alive were genuine, amid speculation at that time that Hussein had been killed during the war.

His fame quickly evaporated as the war continued into the insurgency phase; from the middle of 2003 onward, he faded from the public spotlight, and was no longer a figure in the war. Al-Sahhaf said that he had surrendered to United States forces, had been interrogated by them and then released. He was not charged for his role in Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government.

In March 2008, it was reported by &quot;The Times&quot; that al-Sahhaf was living in the United Arab Emirates.

<text>Philippa Gregory (born 9 January 1954) is an English historical novelist who has been publishing since 1987. The best known of her works is &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; (2001), which in 2002 won the Romantic Novel of the Year Award from the Romantic Novelists&#x27; Association and has been adapted into two films.

&quot;AudioFile&quot; magazine has called Gregory &quot;the queen of British historical fiction&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Philippa Gregory was born on 9 January 1954 in Nairobi, at that time serving as capital city of the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya (modern-day Republic of Kenya), the second daughter of Elaine (Wedd) and Arthur Percy Gregory, a radio operator and navigator for East African Airways. When she was two years old, her family moved to Bristol, UK.

She was a &quot;rebel&quot; at Colston&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School where she obtained a B grade in English and two E grades in History and Geography at A-level. She then went to journalism college in Cardiff and spent a year as an apprentice with the &quot;Portsmouth News&quot; before she managed to gain a place on an English literature degree course at the University of Sussex, where she switched to a history course. In 1982, she received a B.A. degree in history from Sussex University.

She worked for BBC radio for two years before attending University of Edinburgh, where she obtained a Ph.D. degree in 18th-century literature in 1985 for her thesis entitled &quot;The popular fiction of eighteenth-century commercial circulating libraries&quot;. Gregory has taught at the University of Durham, University of Teesside, and the Open University, and was made a fellow of Kingston University in 1994.

==Career==
===Writing===

She has written novels set in several different historical periods, though primarily the Tudor period and the 16th century. Reading a number of novels set in the 17th century led her to write the best-selling Lacey trilogy &quot;Wideacre&quot;, which is a story about the love of land and incest, &quot;The Favoured Child&quot; and &quot;Meridon&quot;. This was followed by &quot;The Wise Woman&quot;. &quot;A Respectable Trade&quot;, a novel of the slave trade in England, set in 18th-century Bristol, was adapted by Gregory for a four-part drama series for BBC television. Gregory&#x27;s script was nominated for a BAFTA, won an award from the Committee for Racial Equality, and the film was shown worldwide.

Two novels about a gardening family are set during the English Civil War: &quot;Earthly Joys&quot; and &quot;Virgin Earth&quot;, while she has in addition written contemporary fiction – &quot;Perfectly Correct&quot;, &quot;Mrs Hartley and the Growth Centre&quot;, &quot;The Little House&quot; and &quot;Zelda&#x27;s Cut&quot;. She has also written for children.

Some of her novels have won awards and have been adapted into television dramas. The most successful of her novels has been &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl,&quot; published in 2001 and adapted for BBC television in 2003 with Natascha McElhone, Jodhi May and Jared Harris. In the year of its publication, &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; also won the Romantic Novel of the Year and it has subsequently spawned sequels – &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Fool,&quot; &quot;The Virgin&#x27;s Lover,&quot; &quot;The Constant Princess,&quot; &quot;The Boleyn Inheritance,&quot; and &quot;The Other Queen&quot;. Miramax bought the film rights to &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; and released a film of the same name in February 2008 starring Eric Bana, Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson.

Gregory has also published a series of books about the Plantagenets, the ruling houses that preceded the Tudors, and the Wars of the Roses. Her first book &quot;The White Queen&quot;, published in 2009, centres on the life of Elizabeth Woodville, the wife of Edward IV. &quot;The Red Queen&quot;, published in 2010, is about Margaret Beaufort the mother of Henry VII and grandmother to Henry VIII. &quot;The Lady of the Rivers&quot; (2011), is the life of Jacquetta of Luxembourg, mother of Elizabeth Woodville. &quot;The Kingmaker&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, published in 2012, is about Anne Neville, the wife of Richard III, and &quot;The White Princess&quot; (2013) centres on the life of Elizabeth of York, wife of Henry VII and the mother of Henry VIII. &quot;The Last Tudor&quot; is a novel about Jane Grey and her sisters Katherine and Mary. The 2013 BBC One television series &quot;The White Queen&quot; is a 10-part adaptation of Gregory&#x27;s novels &quot;The White Queen&quot;, &quot;The Red Queen&quot; and &quot;The Kingmaker&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2012).
In 2013, Helen Brown of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; wrote that &quot;Gregory has made an impressive career out of breathing passionate, independent life into the historical noblewomen whose personalities had previously lain flat on family trees, remembered only as diplomatic currency and brood mares.&quot; She added, &quot;Gregory’s historical fiction has always been entertainingly speculative (those tempted to sneer should note that she’s never claimed otherwise) and comes with lashings of romantic licence.&quot;

In 2011, she contributed a short story &quot;Why Holly Berries are as Red as Roses&quot; to an anthology supporting the Woodland Trust. The anthology, &quot;Why Willows Weep&quot; has so far helped The Woodland Trust plant approximately 50,000 trees.

Gregory was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2021 Birthday Honours for services to literature and to charity in the UK and the Gambia.

In 2024, Gregory&#x27;s play on Richard III, &quot;Richard, My Richard&quot;, was performed at Shakespeare North Playhouse and Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds.

====Criticism====
Gregory has said that her &quot;commitment to historical accuracy&quot; is a hallmark of her writing. This is disputed by historians. Historian David Starkey, appearing alongside Gregory in a documentary about Anne Boleyn, described her work as &quot;good Mills and Boon&quot;, adding that: &quot;We really should stop taking historical novelists seriously as historians. The idea that they have authority is ludicrous.&quot; Susan Bordo criticised Gregory&#x27;s claims to historical accuracy as &quot;self-deceptive and self-promoting chutzpah&quot;, and notes that it is not so much the many inaccuracies in her work as &quot;Gregory&#x27;s insistence on her meticulous adherence to history that most aggravates the scholars.&quot;

In her novel &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot;, her portrayal of Henry VIII&#x27;s second wife Anne Boleyn drew criticism. The novel depicts Anne as cold and ruthless, as well as strongly implying that the accusations that she committed adultery and incest with her brother were true, despite it being widely accepted that she was innocent of the charges. Novelist Robin Maxwell refused on principle to write a blurb for this book, describing its characterisation of Anne as &quot;vicious, unsupportable&quot;.

==Philanthropy==
Gregory runs a small charity building wells in school gardens in The Gambia. Gardens for The Gambia was established in 1993 when Gregory was in The Gambia, researching for her book &quot;A Respectable Trade&quot;.

Since then the charity has dug almost 200 low technology, low budget and therefore easily maintained wells, which are on-stream and providing water to irrigate school and community gardens to provide meals for the poorest children and harvest a cash crop to buy school equipment, seeds and tools.

In addition to wells, the charity has piloted a successful bee-keeping scheme, funded feeding programmes and educational workshops in batik and pottery and is working with larger donors to install mechanical boreholes in some remote areas of the country where the water table is not accessible by digging alone.

Philippa Gregory is a patron of The UK Chagos Support Association, which supports the Chagos islanders in their legal disputes with the British government.

==Personal life==
Gregory wrote her first novel &quot;Wideacre&quot; while completing her doctorate and lived during that time in a cottage on the Pennine Way with her first husband Peter Chislett, editor of the &quot;Hartlepool Mail&quot;, and their baby daughter. They divorced before the book was published.

<doc id="202997" wikidata="Q1349837" url="?curid=202997" title="Henry Lawes">
<text>Henry Lawes (1596 – 1662) was the leading English songwriter of the mid-17th century. He was elder brother of fellow composer William Lawes.

==Life==
Henry Lawes (baptised 5 January 1596 – 21 October 1662), the elder son of Thomas Lawes (died 1640) and Lucris Lawes (born Shephard) was born at Dinton, near Wilton, Wiltshire, just before 5 January 1596. Around 1602 Thomas, a church musician, moved to Salisbury as lay vicar and the family took up residence in the Close. Henry&#x27;s three brothers, born in Salisbury, were also able musicians: William, Thomas (1608 – 1666) and John (d 1655). It is presumed that Henry, and subsequently William, sang in the Cathedral choir but there is no direct evidence. Nor is there information about his upbringing or musical training before he appeared in London, probably about 1615.

At an early stage in London he was employed by John Egerton, earl of Bridgewater to teach music to his daughters. He was sworn &#x27;epistoler&#x27; of the Chapel Royal in January 1625/6 and Gentleman in November following. On 6 January 1630/1 he was cited in the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s accounts as being appointed &#x27;for the lutes and voice&#x27; as one of Charles I&#x27;s musicians, replacing the recently deceased Robert Marsh. By 28 February he was receiving an annual salary of £20, with a livery allowance of £16 2s 6d. Lawes was one of six countertenors of the Chapel Royal who attended the King at his coronation in Scotland in 1633). That same year he served as the Clerk of the Cheque of the Chapel Royal and was a member of the royal band.

During the mid-1630s he composed songs for Milton&#x27;s &quot;Arcades&quot; and arranged for John Milton to write the masque &quot;Comus&quot;; its first performance on 29 September 1634 at Ludlow Castle marked the appointment of Bridgewater as President of the Council of Wales. Compositions for masques and other entertainments followed in the 1630s, sometimes with brother William and others such as Simon Ives. Unlike his songs (see below), little of his music for the masques survives. The portrait now in the Faculty of Music, Oxford University, is dated around this time, approximately 1642.

The English Civil War altered this way of life and affected Henry especially when William was killed in 1645, joining what was believed to be a victorious rout in the fighting at the siege of Chester. In 1648 Henry published &quot;Choice Psalms&quot; containing three-part psalms by himself and William as a memorial to William. It includes verse memorials by Townshend, Harington, Milton and Sambrooke, with musical elegies by Henry Lawes, John Wilson, John Taylor, John Cobb, Edmond Foster, John Jenkins and John Hilton.

Whereas William had continued in the King&#x27;s service, Henry developed his activities as teacher and performer. He taught the daughter of Sir Edward Dering, Lady Mary, to whom he later dedicated his 1655 collection of airs. He appears to have opened his house for music - the duchess of Newcastle attended &quot;several times&quot;. Playford listed Henry in 1651 as among the London teachers &quot;for the Voyce or Viol&quot;. In the later Commonwealth musical entertainments revived and Henry contributed to entertainments written by William Davenant such as his &quot;First Day&#x27;s Entertainment&quot; performed at Rutland House on 23 May 1656.

With the publication of his second book of &quot;Ayres and Dialogues&quot; from 1655, Lawes reflected on his life&#x27;s changes wrought by the Civil War: &quot;...although I have lost my fortunes with my Master (of ever blessed memory) [the reference is to Charles I], I am not so low to bow for a subsistence to the follies of this age.&quot;

At the Restoration Lawes was reinstated in both of his old positions in the King&#x27;s Musick (16 June, as Composer in the Private Musick &quot; in place of Thomas Ford) and the Chapel Royal. On 23 April 1661 Henry Lawes&#x27;s anthem &quot;Zadok the priest&quot; was sung at the coronation of Charles II. However it had been noted by William Child and Samuel Pepys among others that &quot;he lies very sick&quot;: he died on 21 October 1662 and was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey on 25 October.

==Works==
Henry Lawes wrote little instrumental music though some may have been lost: and though some of his 1638 psalm tunes are found in modern hymn-books, his devotional music does not now appeal. It is his output of more than 430 songs on which his reputation rests, linking the period of Dowland to that of Purcell. The major quantity of songs remain in MS, most especially an autograph collection, thought to be in chronological order between 1620 and 1650, containing 325 songs. Another substantial MS source is in New York. The favoured poets were Carew, Waller, Herrick, Suckling and Lovelace.

Printed sources have some degree of overlap with the MSS but account for a further 239 songs:
1638: Psalms to paraphrase by George Sandys;
1648: Choice Psalms (see above);
1653: First Booke of Ayres and Dialogues;
1655: Second Booke of Ayres and Dialogues;
1658: Third Booke of Ayres and Dialogues;

In addition there are many songs and catches in publications by John Playford from 1652 (&quot;Catch that Catch Can&quot;) through to 1678.

<doc id="203006" wikidata="Q254215" url="?curid=203006" title="Rosemary Sutcliff">
<text>Rosemary Sutcliff (14 December 1920 – 23 July 1992) was an English novelist best known for children&#x27;s books, especially historical fiction and retellings of myths and legends. Although she was primarily a children&#x27;s author, some of her novels were specifically written for adults. In a 1986 interview she said, &quot;I would claim that my books are for children of all ages, from nine to ninety.&quot;

For her contribution as a children&#x27;s writer Sutcliff was a runner-up for the Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1974.

==Biography==
Sutcliff was born 14 December 1920 to George Ernest Sutcliff and his wife Nessie Elizabeth, née Lawton, in East Clandon, Surrey. She spent her childhood in Malta and various naval bases where her father, a Royal Navy officer, was stationed. She was affected by Still&#x27;s disease when she was very young, and used a wheelchair most of her life. Due to her chronic illness, Sutcliff spent most of her time with her mother from whom she learned many of the Celtic and Saxon legends that she would later expand into works of historical fiction. Sutcliff&#x27;s early schooling was constantly interrupted by moving house and her illness. She did not learn to read until she was nine years of age, and left school at age 14 to enter the Bideford Art School, which she attended for three years, graduating from the General Art Course. Sutcliff then worked as a painter of miniatures.

Inspired by the children&#x27;s historical novels of Geoffrey Trease, her first published book was &quot;The Chronicles of Robin Hood&quot; in 1950. In 1954, she published what remains her best-known work &quot;The Eagle of the Ninth,&quot; part of a series on Roman Britain and its aftermath; they were not written as such or in sequential order but connected by the linking device of an emerald ring, passed down through generations of the same family. Between 1954 and 1958, Sutcliff&#x27;s works &quot;The Eagle of the Ninth&quot;, its sequel &quot;The Silver Branch&quot;, &quot;Outcast&quot; and &quot;Warrior Scarlet&quot; were runners-up in the annual Carnegie Medal, given by the Library Association to the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book by a British subject. She finally won the Medal for her third book in the &quot;Eagle&quot; series, &quot;The Lantern Bearers&quot; (1959). Where the first two books and one subsequent one were set in Roman Britain, &quot;The Lantern Bearers&quot; immediately follows the withdrawal of the Roman Empire, when the British people are threatened by remaining Germanic troops and by invaders.

Sutcliff was Carnegie runner-up again for her retelling of the Arthurian legend in &quot;Tristan and Iseult&quot;, which in 1971 won the American Horn Book Award. In 1985, &quot;The Mark of the Horse Lord&quot; was the inaugural winner of the Phoenix Award, created by the Children&#x27;s Literature Association to recognise the best English-language children&#x27;s book that did not win a major award when originally published twenty years earlier. &quot;The Shining Company&quot; won the same award in 2010.

Sutcliff lived for many years in Walberton near Arundel, Sussex. In 1975, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to children&#x27;s literature, and later Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1992. She wrote incessantly throughout her life and was still doing so on the morning of her death in 1992. Sutcliff never married and had no children.

In 1966 Sutcliff made a small donation to the de Grummond Children&#x27;s Literature Collection at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.

The Sutcliff Papers include a manuscript and two typescripts for the radio play &quot;The New Laird&quot;. That programme was taped 4 April 1966 and broadcast from Edinburgh on 17 May 1966 as part of the &quot;Stories from Scottish History&quot; series (BBC Radio Scotland).

==Awards==
The biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children&#x27;s books. Sutcliff was one of three runners-up for the writing award in 1974 (and the British nominee in 1968 as well).

She won several awards for particular works.

* 1959 Carnegie Medal, &quot;The Lantern Bearers&quot;
* 1971 (the Dutch Silver Pencil), &quot;The Chronicles of Robin Hood&quot;
* 1972 Boston Globe–Horn Book Award for Fiction, &quot;Tristan and Iseult&quot;

* 1985 Phoenix Award, &quot;The Mark of the Horse Lord&quot; (1965)
* 2010 Phoenix Award, &quot;The Shining Company&quot; (1990)

Besides winning the 1959 Carnegie Medal, Sutcliff was a commended runner-up five times. Alan Lee, who illustrated Sutcliff&#x27;s posthumously published retellings of &quot;The Iliad&quot; and &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, won the companion Kate Greenaway Medal for the former, &quot;Black Ships Before Troy&quot; (1993).

<doc id="203016" wikidata="Q995016" url="?curid=203016" title="Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne">
<text>Bryan Walter Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne (27 October 1905 – 6 July 1992), was a British writer, poet, socialite, and heir to part of the Guinness family brewing fortune. He was vice-chairman of Guinness plc and authored several works of poetry and novels.

==Early life==
He was born on 27 October 1905, the son of the Hon. Walter Guinness (later created Baron Moyne), third son of Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh, and his wife, Lady Evelyn Hilda Stuart Erskine (1883–1939), daughter of the 14th Earl of Buchan. He was educated at Heatherdown School, Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, and was called to the bar in 1931. At Oxford, Guinness was part of the Railway Club. 

As an heir to the Guinness family brewing fortune and a handsome, charming young man, Guinness was considered an eligible bachelor. One of London&#x27;s &quot;Bright young things&quot;, he was an organiser of the 1929 &quot;Bruno Hat&quot; hoax art exhibition held at his home in London.

==Marriages and family==
In 1929, Guinness married the Hon. Diana Freeman-Mitford, daughter of the 2nd Baron Redesdale and one of the Mitford sisters. They had two sons:

* Jonathan Bryan Guinness, 3rd Baron Moyne (born 16 March 1930)
* Hon. Desmond Walter Guinness (8 September 1931 – 20 August 2020)

The couple became leaders of the London artistic and social scene and were dedicatees of Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s second novel &quot;Vile Bodies&quot;. However, they divorced in 1933 after Diana deserted Guinness for British fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley.

In 1931, Guinness bought Biddesden House – an 18th-century country house in Wiltshire, near Ludgershall village and the Hampshire town of Andover – together with about . In 1990, he and his family owned about 600 acres in Ludgershall parish, including Biddesden Farm.

Guinness remarried in 1936 to Elisabeth Nelson (1912–1999), daughter of Thomas Arthur Nelson, of the Nelson publishing family, with whom he had nine children:

* Hon. Rosaleen Elisabeth Guinness (born 7 September 1937)
* Hon. Diarmid Edward Guinness (23 September 1938 – 15 August 1977)
* Hon. Fiona Evelyn Guinness (born 26 June 1940)
* Hon. Dr. Finn Benjamin Guinness (born 26 August 1945)
* Hon. Thomasin Margaret Guinness (born 16 January 1947)
* Hon. Kieran Arthur Guinness (born 11 February 1949)
* Hon. Catriona Rose Guinness (born 13 December 1950)
* Hon. Erskine Stuart Richard Guinness (born 16 January 1953)
* Hon. Mirabel Jane Guinness (born 8 September 1956)

==Public life==
During World War II, Guinness served for three years in the Middle East with the Spears Mission to the Free French, being a fluent French speaker. He gained the rank of Major in the Royal Sussex Regiment. In November 1944, Guinness succeeded to the barony when his father, posted abroad as Resident Minister in the Middle East by his friend Winston Churchill, was assassinated in Cairo.

After the war, Lord Moyne was on the board of the Guinness corporation as vice-chairman from 1947 to 1979, as well as the Guinness Trust and the Iveagh Trust, and sat as a crossbencher in the House of Lords. He served for 35 years as a trustee of the National Gallery of Ireland and donated several works to the gallery. He wrote a number of critically applauded novels, memoirs, books of poetry, and plays. With Frank Pakenham he sought the return of the &quot;Lane Bequest&quot; to Dublin, resulting in the 1959 compromise agreement. He was invested as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He served as pro-chancellor of Trinity College Dublin from 1965 to 1977 and was made an honorary fellow in 1977.

== Death ==
Lord Moyne died in 1992 at Biddesden House, his Wiltshire home (near Andover, Hampshire), and was succeeded by his eldest son from his first marriage, Jonathan Guinness, 3rd Baron Moyne.

<doc id="203030" wikidata="Q4798994" url="?curid=203030" title="Arthur Haselrig">
<text>Sir Arthur Haselrig, 2nd Baronet (1601 – 7 January 1661) was an English politician and eminent heavy cavalry commander. A major critic of Charles I of England during the period of Personal Rule from 1629 to 1640, he was one of the Five Members whose attempted arrest sparked the First English Civil War in August 1642. As a leading Parliamentarian, he held various military and political posts during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. 

Haselrig approved the Execution of Charles I in January 1649, although he refused to participate in his trial, but later opposed Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s creation of The Protectorate in 1653. In the political struggle which ended with the Stuart Restoration in May 1660, he sought to prevent the return of Charles II of England. Viewed as an opponent of the new regime, he was arrested and held in the Tower of London, where he died on 7 January 1661.

==Personal details==
Descended from Leicestershire landed gentry, Haselrig was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Hesilrige, 1st Baronet of Noseley Hall, Leicestershire, and of Frances Gorges, daughter of Sir William Gorges, of Alderton, Northamptonshire. 

Haselrig married firstly Frances Elmes, daughter of Thomas Elmes of Lilford Hall, Northamptonshire, by whom he had two sons and two daughters. He married secondly Dorothy Greville, sister of Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke, by whom he had three sons and five daughters.

==Short and Long Parliaments==
In April 1640, Haselrig was elected Member of Parliament for Leicestershire in the Short Parliament He was re-elected MP for Leicestershire for the Long Parliament in November 1640. He was heavily involved in the Act of Attainder against Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, the Root and Branch Bill and the Militia Bill of 7 December 1641. Charles I tried to arrest him for treason on 3 January 1642, along with John Hampden, Denzil Holles, John Pym and William Strode. However the so-called &quot;Five Members&quot;, together with the peer Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester who was also due to be arrested, were tipped off by Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex. The king marched with his guards into the House of Commons chamber only to find that the Five Members had fled.

==Civil War==
Haselrig was very active in the First English Civil War on the Parliamentarian side. He raised a troop of horse for the Earl of Essex and fought at the Battle of Edgehill. He was a commander in the West under William Waller, being nicknamed his &quot;fidus Achates&quot;, and led his cuirassiers, who were known as the London lobsters. He and his troops distinguished themselves at the Battle of Lansdowne on 5 July 1643, where his men defeated Sir Beville Grenville&#x27;s Pikemen, although the battle is traditionally seen as indecisive. At the Battle of Roundway Down, on 13 July, Haselrig&#x27;s force met a Royalist cavalry charge at the halt and after a brief clash, retreated in disorder, the Parliamentarian army losing the battle to Lord Wilmot. Haselrig was shot three times at Roundway Down, with the bullets apparently bouncing off his armour. After firing a pistol at Haselrig&#x27;s helmeted head at close range without any effect Richard Atkyns described how he attacked him with his sword, but it too caused no visible damage; Haselrig was under attack from several people and succumbed only when Atkyns attacked his unarmoured horse. After the death of his horse Haselrig tried to surrender, but as he fumbled with his sword, which was tied to his wrist, he was rescued. He suffered only minor wounds from his ordeal. This incident was related to Charles I and elicited one of his rare attempts at humour. The king said that if Haselrig had been as well supplied as he was fortified he could have withstood a siege.

At the Battle of Cheriton, his men defeated Sir Henry Bard&#x27;s cavalry charge, seriously weakening Ralph Hopton&#x27;s army in the west. This battle was a turning point in the war and the king&#x27;s secretary Sir Edward Walker said that after Cheriton, instead of an offensive war they were forced to make a defensive war.

==Governor of Newcastle==
Haselrig supported Oliver Cromwell in his dispute with the Earl of Manchester and the Earl of Essex. When the Self-denying Ordinance was approved by Parliament he gave up his commission and became one of the leaders of the Independent party in Parliament. On 30 December 1647 he was appointed governor of Newcastle upon Tyne, which he successfully defended, besides defeating the Royalists on 2 July 1648 and regaining Tynemouth. In October he accompanied Cromwell to Scotland, and gave him valuable support in the Scottish expedition in 1650. Between 1647 and 1650 Haselrig and his son brought a large amount of property in the north east which included the manors of Bishop Auckland, Middleham, Easingwoodborough and Wolsingham at a total cost of over £22,500.

==Parliamentary career under Cromwell==
Haselrig approved of the king&#x27;s execution but declined to act as a judge at his trial. He was one of the leading men in the Commonwealth, but he was antagonised by Cromwell&#x27;s expulsion of the Rump Parliament, and he opposed the Protectorate refusing to pay taxes. Haselrig considered Cromwell to be a traitor to the cause after this as he was a staunch republican and opposed to all rule by a single person whether by hereditary succession or military might. Edmund Ludlow, one of his opponents admitted &quot;to do him justice .. I must acknowledge that I am under no manner of doubt concerning the rectitude and sincerity of his intentions. For he made it his buseness to prevent arbitrary power wherever he knew it to be affected, and to keep the sword subserviant to the civil magistrate&quot;.

In 1654, Haselrig was elected MP for Leicester in the First Protectorate Parliament and in 1656 for the Second Protectorate Parliament, but he was excluded from them both. He refused a seat, offered to him by Cromwell, in the Protectorate House of Lords.

==Parliament against Lambert==
On Cromwell&#x27;s death Haselrig refused support to Richard Cromwell, and was instrumental in his downfall. He was elected MP for Leicester for the Third Protectorate Parliament in 1659. In April 1659, the army officers of the Wallingford House party acted to close down this parliament, and in May to restore the Rump Parliament, of which Haselrig was also a member, with government in the hands of the Council of State, appointed by the Rump. Haselrig became one of the most influential men in both Council and Parliament. He tried to keep a republican parliamentary administration, &quot;to keep the sword subservient to the civil magistrate&quot;. He opposed the schemes of John Lambert who was resisting parliamentary control over the military. In one altercation Lambert complained that the army was being held at ransom; Haselrig replied that &quot;You are only at the mercy of Parliament who are your friends&quot; to which Lambert replied &quot;I know not why they should not be at our mercy as well as we at theirs.&quot; Anger at the independence of the army resulted in nine leading officers, including Lambert, being cashiered. Lambert reacted by calling out the army and blocking all routes to Parliament, and putting guards upon its doors.

After Lambert had halted Parliament, Haselrig decided to restore Parliament. The strength of the army in London called for another location, and for a variety of reasons Portsmouth was chosen. Portsmouth had strong naval traditions and had always maintained independence from the army; it benefited from defensible fortifications on its land side and the support of Admiral John Lawson ensured that the city would not fall easily to a protracted siege. Haselrig knew the area well having campaigned around Hampshire during the civil war. The newly appointed Governor Nathaniel Whetham was a republican who had declared that his men would support him. Whetham was a friend of General George Monck in Scotland who had the best forces in Britain at his disposal and who had declared himself for Parliament in October. On 4 December 1659 Haselrig met with his allies in the Red Lion Inn having arrived at 4 in the afternoon. By the next day a declaration was posted calling for citizens to &quot;restore Parliament to their former freedom, being the peoples indubitable and undoubted birthright&quot;. Hurst Castle and the Isle of Wight soon declared for Parliament. The military government, which was now named the Committee of Safety, despatched a force hoping that pro-army members would open the gates. However the Commander of the Army Colonel Nathaniel Rich entered into negotiations and his men decided to join Haselrig. Word soon spread and soon Hull and Plymouth were recorded to be going the same way. The army council, unsure of support of its troops, restored the Rump Parliament by 26 December. On 29 December Haselrig marched to London and attended Parliament still in his riding clothes. Haselrig was at the height of his power as the major figure in a restored republic and was appointed to the Council of State on 2 January 1660. On 11 February he became a commissioner for the army.

==Monck and the Restoration==
However Monck had begun to march south from Coldstream on 1 January. Lambert moved to face Monck but knowing the strength of Monck&#x27;s forces and the doubtful loyalty of his own troops avoided engagement. Monck avoided answering questions as to his intentions and by 3 February entered London. Haselrig, trusting to his assurance of fidelity to the &quot;Good Old Cause&quot; consented to the retirement of his regiment from London. The Rump Parliament was dissolved and Haselrig found himself marginalised by the unfolding events. A new Convention Parliament came in on 31 April and by 8 May Charles II was proclaimed King. Haselrig petitioned for a pardon, claiming he had not supported the overthrow of Charles I and had supported the Commonwealth only to avoid bloodshed.

Despite Monck&#x27;s guarantee of a pardon, Haselrig was targeted by the Royalist Silius Titus, who was also responsible for disinterring the bodies of Cromwell, Bradshaw and Ireton and having them ritually executed at Tyburn. His life was spared but he was imprisoned in the Tower of London where he died on 7 January 1661.

==Character==
Clarendon described Haselrig as &quot;an absurd, bold man.&quot; He was rash, &quot;hare-brained,&quot; and devoid of tact and had little claim to the title of a statesman, but his energy in the field and in parliament was often of great value to the parliamentary cause. He exposed himself to considerable obloquy by his exactions and appropriations of confiscated landed property, though the accusation brought against him by John Lilburne was examined by a parliamentary committee and adjudged to be false.

==Legacy==
In 1646, Haselrig purchased Auckland Castle, previously home of the Bishop of Durham, and replaced it with a new country house. After the 1660 Restoration, the property was returned to the Church of England, and the new bishop, John Cosin, demolished Haselrig&#x27;s home and constructed his own. In 2024, a team of archaeologists began excavating the area, looking for traces of Haselrig&#x27;s building.

<doc id="203032" wikidata="Q335173" url="?curid=203032" title="Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon">
<text>Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon (18 February 16099 December 1674) was an English statesman, lawyer, diplomat and historian who served as chief advisor to Charles I during the First English Civil War, and Lord Chancellor to Charles II from 1660 to 1667.

Hyde largely avoided involvement in the political disputes of the 1630s until elected to the Long Parliament in November 1640. Like many moderates he felt attempts by Charles I to rule without Parliament had gone too far, but by 1642 felt Parliament&#x27;s leaders were, in turn, seeking too much power. A devout believer in an Episcopalian Church of England, his opposition to Puritan attempts to reform it drove much of his policy over the next two decades. He joined Charles in York shortly before the First English Civil War began in August 1642, and initially served as his senior political advisor. However, as the war turned against the Royalists, his rejection of attempts to build alliances with Scots Covenanters or Irish Catholics led to a decline in his influence.

In 1644, the king&#x27;s son, the future Charles II, was placed in command of the West Country, with Hyde and his close friend Sir Ralph Hopton as part of his Governing Council. When the Royalists surrendered in June 1646, Hyde went into exile with the younger Charles, who (from the royalist perspective) became king after his father&#x27;s execution in January 1649. Hyde avoided participation in the Second or Third English Civil War, for both involved alliances with Scots and English Presbyterians; instead he served as a diplomat in Paris and Madrid. After The Restoration in 1660, Charles II appointed him Lord Chancellor and Earl of Clarendon, while Hyde&#x27;s daughter Anne married the future James II, making him grandfather of two queens, Mary II and Anne. 

Lord Clarendon&#x27;s links to the king brought him both power and enemies, while Charles became increasingly irritated by his criticism. Despite having limited responsibility for the disastrous Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665–1667), Clarendon was charged with treason and forced into permanent exile. He lived in continental Europe until his death in 1674; during this period he completed &quot;The History of the Rebellion&quot;, now regarded as one of the most significant histories of the 1642-to-1646 civil war. First written as a defence of Charles I, it was extensively revised after 1667 and became far more critical and franker, particularly in its assessments of his contemporaries.

==Personal details==
Edward Hyde was born on 18 February 1609, at Dinton, Wiltshire, sixth of nine children and third son of Henry Hyde (1563–1634) and Mary Langford (1578–1661). His siblings included Anne (1597–?), Elizabeth (1599–?), Lawrence (1600–?), Henry (1601–1627), Mary (1603–?), Sibble (1605–?), Susan (1607–1656) and Nicholas (1610–1611).

His father and two of his uncles were lawyers; although Henry retired after his marriage, Nicholas Hyde became Lord Chief Justice, Lawrence was legal advisor to Anne of Denmark, wife of James I. Educated at Gillingham School, in 1622 Hyde was admitted to Hertford College, Oxford, then known as Magdalen Hall, graduating in 1626. He was originally intended for a career in the Church of England, but the death of his elder brothers left him as his father&#x27;s heir, and instead, he entered the Middle Temple to study law.

He married twice, first in 1629 to Anne Ayliffe, who died six months later from smallpox, then to Frances Aylesbury in 1634. They had six children who survived infancy: Henry (1638–1709), Laurence (1642–1711), Edward (1645–1665), James (1650–1681), Anne (1637–1671), and Frances, who married Thomas Keightley. As mother of two queens, Anne is the best remembered, but both Henry and Laurence had significant political careers, the latter being &quot;an exceptionally able politician&quot;.

==Career: before 1640==

Hyde later admitted he had limited interest in a legal career, and declared that &quot;next the immediate blessing and providence of God Almighty&quot; he &quot;owed all the little he knew and the little good that was in him to the friendships and conversation ... of the most excellent men in their several kinds that lived in that age.&quot; These included Ben Jonson, John Selden, Edmund Waller, John Hales and especially Lord Falkland, who became his best friend.

Hyde was one of the most prominent members of the famous Great Tew Circle, a group of intellectuals who gathered at Lord Falkland&#x27;s country house Great Tew in Oxfordshire.

On 22 November 1633 he was called to the bar and obtained quickly a good position and practice; &quot;you may have great joy of your son Ned&quot; his uncle the Attorney General assured his father. Both his marriages gained him influential friends, and in December 1634 he was made keeper of the writs and rolls of the Court of Common Pleas. His able conduct of the petition of the London merchants against Lord Treasurer Portland earned him the approval of Archbishop William Laud, with whom he developed a friendship, though Laud did not make friends easily and his religious views were very different from Hyde&#x27;s. Hyde in his &quot;History&quot; explained that he admired Laud for his integrity and decency and excused his notorious rudeness and bad temper, partly because of Laud&#x27;s humble origins and partly because Hyde recognised the same weaknesses in himself.

==Career: 1640 to 1660==

In April 1640, Hyde was elected Member of Parliament for both Shaftesbury and Wootton Bassett in the Short Parliament and chose to sit for Wootton Bassett. In November 1640 he was elected MP for Saltash in the Long Parliament, Hyde was at first a moderate critic of King Charles I, but became more supportive of the king after he began to accept reforming bills from Parliament. Hyde opposed legislation restricting the power of the King to appoint his own advisors, viewing it as unnecessary and an affront to the royal prerogative. He gradually moved over towards the royalist side, championing the Church of England and opposing the execution of the Earl of Strafford, Charles&#x27;s primary adviser. Following the Grand Remonstrance of 1641, Hyde became an informal adviser to the King. He left London about 20 May 1642 and rejoined the king at York. In February 1643, Hyde was knighted and was officially appointed to the Privy Council; the following month he was made Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Despite his own previous opposition to the King, he found it hard to forgive anyone, even a friend, who fought for Parliament, and he severed many personal friendships as a result. With the possible exception of John Pym, he detested all the Parliamentarian leaders, describing Oliver Cromwell as &quot;a brave bad man&quot; and John Hampden as a hypocrite, while Oliver St. John&#x27;s &quot;foxes and wolves&quot; speech, in favour of the attainder of Strafford, he considered to be the depth of barbarism. His view of the conflict and of his opponents was undoubtedly coloured by the death of his best friend Lord Falkland at the First Battle of Newbury in September 1643. Hyde mourned his death, which he called &quot;a loss most infamous and execrable to all posterity&quot;, to the end of his own life.

In 1644, the Royalist-controlled West Country was created a separate government under the Prince of Wales, with Hyde appointed to his General Council; this was partly intended by his opponents as a way to remove him from access to the king. Hyde found it difficult to control his military commanders, notably George Goring, Lord Goring, who, although a brave and capable cavalry general, often refused to follow orders and whose ill-disciplined troops gained a reputation for looting and drunkenness. He described Goring as a man who would &quot;without hesitation have broken any trust, or performed any act of treachery...Of all his qualifications, dissimulation was his masterpiece; in which he so much excelled, that men were not ordinarily ashamed or out of countenance, in being but twice deceived by him&quot;.

After the Royalist defeat, Hyde fled to Jersey in 1646; his opposition to alliances with the Scots meant he was not closely involved with the 1648 Second English Civil War, which resulted in the execution of Charles I in January 1649. Despite their differences, he was horrified by the Execution of Charles I; he later described Charles as a man who had an excellent understanding but was not sufficiently confident of it himself, so that he often changed his opinion for a worse one, and &quot;would follow the advice of a man who did not judge as well as himself&quot;.

During this period Hyde began writing &quot;The History of the Rebellion&quot;, but following defeat in the Third English Civil War in 1651, he resumed his position as advisor to Charles II and was appointed Lord Chancellor on 13 January 1658. He also employed his sister Susanna as a Royalist agent; arrested in 1656, she was held in Lambeth Palace prison, where she died soon afterward. Although other female spies are mentioned in his &quot;History&quot;, she does not appear.

==Career: 1660 to 1667==
After the Stuart Restoration in 1660, he returned to England and became even closer to the royal family through the marriage of his daughter Anne to the king&#x27;s brother James, Duke of York. Contemporaries naturally assumed that Hyde had arranged the royal marriage of his daughter, but modern historians, in general, accept his repeated claims that he had no hand in it, and that indeed it came as an unwelcome shock to him. He is supposed to have told Anne that he would rather see her dead than to so disgrace her family.

There were good reasons for his opposition, since he may have hoped to arrange a marriage for James with a foreign princess, and he was well aware that nobody regarded his daughter as a suitable royal match, a view Clarendon shared. On the personal level, he seems to have disliked James, whose impulsive attempt to repudiate the marriage can hardly have endeared him to his father-in-law. Anne enforced the rules of etiquette governing such marriages with great strictness, and thus caused her parents some social embarrassment: as commoners, they were not permitted to sit down in Anne&#x27;s presence, or to refer to her as their daughter. As Cardinal Mazarin remarked, the marriage damaged Hyde&#x27;s reputation as a politician, whether he was responsible for it or not. On 3 November 1660, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Hyde, of Hindon in the County of Wiltshire, and on 20 April the next year, at the coronation, he was created Viscount Cornbury and Earl of Clarendon. He served as Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1660 to 1667.

As effective chief minister in the early years of the reign, he accepted the need to fulfil most of what had been promised in the Declaration of Breda, which he had partly drafted. In particular, he worked hard to fulfil the promise of mercy to all the King&#x27;s enemies, except the regicides, and this was largely achieved in the Act of Indemnity and Oblivion. Most other problems he was content to leave to Parliament, and in particular to the restored House of Lords; his speech welcoming the Lords&#x27; return shows his ingrained dislike of democracy.

He played a key role in Charles&#x27; marriage to Catherine of Braganza, with ultimately harmful consequences to himself. Clarendon liked and admired the Queen, and disapproved of the King&#x27;s openly maintaining his mistresses. The King, however, resented any interference with his private life. Catherine&#x27;s failure to bear children also was damaging to Clarendon, given the nearness of his own grandchildren to the throne, although it is most unlikely, as was alleged, that Clarendon had planned deliberately for Charles to marry an infertile bride. He and Catherine remained on friendly terms; one of his last letters thanked her for her kindness to his family.

As Lord Chancellor, it is commonly thought that Clarendon was the author of the &quot;Clarendon Code&quot;, designed to preserve the supremacy of the Church of England. In reality, he was not very heavily involved with its drafting and actually disapproved of much of its content. The &quot;Great Tew Circle&quot; of which he had been a leading member prided itself on tolerance and respect for religious differences. The code was thus merely named after him as chief minister.

In 1663, he was one of eight Lords Proprietor given title to a huge tract of land in North America which became the Province of Carolina. Shortly after this, an attempt was made to impeach him by George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol, a longstanding political opponent from the Civil War. He was accused of arranging for Charles to marry a woman he knew to be barren in order to secure the throne for the children of his daughter Anne, while Clarendon House, his palatial new mansion in Piccadilly, was cited as evidence of corruption. He was also blamed for the Sale of Dunkirk, and the cost of supporting the colony of Tangiers, acquired along with Bombay as part of Catherine&#x27;s dowry. The windows of Clarendon House were broken, and a placard fixed to the house blaming Hyde for &quot;Dunkirk, Tangiers and a barren Queen&quot;.

While these allegations were not taken seriously, and ended by damaging Bristol more than Hyde, he became increasingly unpopular with the public and with Charles, whom he subjected to frequent lectures on his shortcomings. His contempt for Charles&#x27; mistress Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland, earned him her enmity, and she worked with the future members of the Cabal Ministry to destroy him.

His authority was weakened by increasing ill-health, in particular attacks of gout and back pain that became so severe that he was often incapacitated for months on end: Samuel Pepys records that early in 1665 Hyde was forced to lie on a couch during Council meetings. Even neutrals began to see him as a liability, and when attempts to persuade him to retire failed, some spread false reports that he was anxious to step down. These included Sir William Coventry who later admitted to Pepys that he was largely responsible for these reports; he claimed this was because Clarendon&#x27;s dominance of policy and refusal to consider alternatives made even their discussion impossible. In his memoirs, Clarendon makes clear his bitterness against Coventry for what he regarded as betrayal, which he contrasted with the loyalty shown by his brother Henry.

Above all, the military setbacks of the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665 to 1667, together with the disasters of the Plague of 1665 and the Great Fire of London, led to his downfall, and the successful Dutch raid on the Medway in June 1667 was the final blow to his career. Despite having opposed the war, unlike many of his accusers, he was removed from office; as he left Whitehall, Barbara Villiers shouted abuse at him, to which he replied with simple dignity: &quot;Madam, pray remember that if you live, you will also be old&quot;.

At almost the same time he suffered a great personal blow when his wife died after a short illness: in a will drawn up the previous year, he described her as &quot;my dearly beloved wife, who hath accompanied and assisted me in all my distresses&quot;. Clarendon was impeached by the House of Commons for blatant violations of &quot;Habeas Corpus&quot;, for having sent prisoners out of England to places like Jersey and holding them there without benefit of trial. He was forced to flee to France in November 1667. The King made it clear that he would not defend him, which betrayal of his old and loyal servant harmed Charles&#x27;s reputation. Efforts to pass an Act of Attainder against him failed, but an Act providing for his banishment (19 &amp; 20 Cha. 2. c. 2) was passed in December and received the royal assent. Apart from the Duke of York (Clarendon&#x27;s son-in-law) and Henry Coventry, few spoke in his defence. Clarendon was accompanied to France by his private chaplain and ally William Levett, later Dean of Bristol.

==Exile, death, and legacy==

The rest of Clarendon&#x27;s life was passed in exile. He left Calais for Rouen on 25 December, returning on 21 January 1668, visiting the baths of Bourbon in April, thence to Avignon in June, residing from July 1668 till June 1671 at Montpellier, whence he proceeded to Moulins and to Rouen again in May 1674. His sudden banishment entailed great personal hardships. His health at the time of his flight was much impaired, and on arriving at Calais he fell dangerously ill; and Louis XIV, anxious at this time to gain popularity in England, sent him peremptory and repeated orders to quit France. He suffered severely from gout, and during the greater part of his exile could not walk without the aid of two men. At Évreux, on 23 April 1668, he was the victim of a murderous assault by English sailors, who attributed to him the non-payment of their wages, and who were on the point of despatching him when he was rescued by the guard. For some time he was not allowed to see any of his children; even correspondence with him was rendered treasonable by the Act of Banishment; and it was not apparently until 1671, 1673, and 1674 that he received visits from his sons, the younger, Lawrence Hyde, being present with him at his death.

He spent his exile updating and expanding his &quot;History&quot;, the classic account of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, and for which he is chiefly remembered today. The sale proceeds from this book were instrumental in building the Clarendon Building and Clarendon Fund at Oxford University Press. During his exile, he also wrote his autobiography, a number of essays, a work on David&#x27;s psalms, and a critique of Thomas Hobbes&#x27;s book &quot;Leviathan&quot;.

The diarist Samuel Pepys wrote thirty years later that he never knew anyone who could speak as well as Hyde.

He died in Rouen, France, on 9 December 1674. Shortly after his death, his body was returned to England, and he was buried in a private ceremony in Westminster Abbey on 4 January 1675.

==Portrayals in drama and fiction==
Nigel Bruce played Sir Edward Hyde in the 1947 film &quot;The Exile&quot;, with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as Charles II.

In the film &quot;Cromwell&quot;, Clarendon (called only Sir Edward Hyde in the film), is portrayed by Nigel Stock as a sympathetic yet conflicted man torn between Parliament and the king. He finally turns against Charles I altogether when the king pretends to accept Cromwell&#x27;s terms of peace but secretly and treacherously plots to raise a Catholic army against Parliament and start a second civil war. Clarendon reluctantly, but bravely, gives testimony at the king&#x27;s trial (where in real life he was not present) which is instrumental in condemning him to death.

In the 2003 BBC TV mini-series &quot;Charles II: The Power and The Passion&quot;, Clarendon was played by actor Ian McDiarmid. The series portrayed Clarendon (referred to as &#x27;Sir Edward Hyde&#x27; throughout) as acting in a paternalistic fashion towards Charles II, something the king comes to dislike. It is also intimated that he had arranged the marriage of Charles and Catherine of Braganza already knowing that she was infertile so that his granddaughters through his daughter Anne Hyde (who had married the future James II) would eventually inherit the throne of England.

In the 2004 film &quot;Stage Beauty&quot;, starring Billy Crudup and Claire Danes, Clarendon (again referred to simply as Edward Hyde) is played by Edward Fox.

In fiction, Clarendon is a minor character in &quot;An Instance of the Fingerpost&quot; by Iain Pears and in &quot;Act of Oblivion&quot; (2022) by Robert Harris. He is also a recurring character in the Thomas Chaloner series of mystery novels by Susanna Gregory. All three authors show him in a fairly sympathetic light.

<text>William Lauder (–1771) was a Scottish literary forger, the second son of Dr William Lauder (1652–1724), one of the original 21 Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, by his spouse Catherine Brown (died 1698). Dr William Lauder was a son of Sir John Lauder, 1st Baronet of Fountainhall.

While yet a boy, Lauder suffered amputation of one of his legs, in consequence of having accidentally received a stroke from a golf ball on his knee. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh, acquired a high college character for talent and scholarship, and graduated in 1695. He applied unsuccessfully for the permanent post of Professor of Humanity there, in succession to Adam Watt, in whose place, since 1734, owing to Watt&#x27;s illness, he had been teaching. &quot;William Lauder, Teacher of Humanities at Edinburgh University&quot; appears in a Disposition in the National Archives of Scotland, (GD267/27/138/1746) to Ninian Home of Billie, dated 25 August 1740.

Lauder had also applied at some point for the keepership of the university library. In 1739 he had published a collection of sacred poems by himself and other writers, mostly paraphrased from the Bible. These were published by Ruddiman in 2 volumes, under the title of &quot;Poetarum Scotorum Musae Sacrae&quot;, today a well-known work of Scottish literature.

In 1739 Lauder narrowly failed in his application to become one of the masters of the High School in Edinburgh, but in 1742 Lauder was appointed one of the doctors, or junior masters, at Dundee Grammar School, where he remained until the Jacobite rising of 1745, whereupon he went to London. In 1747 he wrote an article for the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; suggesting that John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; was largely a plagiarism from the &quot;Adamus Exul&quot; (1601) of Hugo Grotius, the &quot;Sarcotis&quot; (1654) of Jacob Masen (Masenius, 1606–1681), and the &quot;Poemata Sacra&quot; (1633) of Andrew Ramsay (1574–1659). Lauder expounded his case in a series of articles, and in a book (1753) increased the list of plundered authors to nearly a hundred.

His success was short-lived. Several scholars, who had independently studied the alleged sources of Milton&#x27;s inspiration, showed that Lauder had not only garbled most of his quotations, but had inserted amongst them extracts from a Latin version of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. This led to his exposure by Bishop John Douglas, and he was obliged to write a complete confession at the dictation of his former friend, Samuel Johnson. After several vain endeavours to clear his character he emigrated to Barbados, where he purchased a hotel and also taught in a school. He remained there until his death.

<text>Magnus Eriksson (April or May 1316  – 1 December 1374) was King of Sweden from 1319 to 1364, King of Norway as Magnus VII from 1319 to 1355, and ruler of Scania from 1332 to 1360. By adversaries he has been called &quot;Magnus Smek&quot; ().

Medieval Swedish kings did not use regnal numbers as part of their title. As the king of Sweden, he is sometimes referred to as Magnus II, Magnus III, or Magnus IV. He is the second longest-reigning monarch in Swedish history after the current king Carl XVI Gustaf, who surpassed Magnus in 2018.

== Biography ==
Magnus was born in Norway, either in April or May 1316. His father was Duke Erik Magnusson, son of King Magnus Ladulås of Sweden. His mother was Ingeborg, daughter of King Haakon V of Norway. Magnus was elected king of Sweden on 8 July 1319 at Mora Thing to prevent the previous king Birger Magnusson, his uncle, from returning to power. Magnus was also acknowledged as the hereditary king of Norway at Haugating in Tønsberg in August of the same year. After his mother Ingeborg was removed from the regency in 1322–1323, the countries were ruled by local magnates until Magnus came of age.

Magnus was declared to have come of age at 15 in 1331. This provoked resistance in Norway, where a statute from 1302 stipulated that a king came of age at the age of 20, and a rising by Erling Vidkunsson and other Norwegian nobles ensued. In 1333, the rebels submitted to King Magnus.

In 1332, King Christopher II of Denmark died as a &quot;king without a country&quot; after he and his older brother and predecessor had pawned Denmark piece by piece. King Magnus took advantage of his neighbour&#x27;s distress, redeeming the pawn for the eastern Danish provinces for a huge amount of silver, and thus became ruler also of Scania.

On 21 July 1336, Magnus was crowned king of both Norway and Sweden in Stockholm. This caused further resentment in Norway, where the nobles and magnates desired a separate Norwegian coronation. A second rising by members of the high nobility of Norway ensued in 1338.
In 1335, Magnus married Blanche, daughter of John I, Marquis of Namur, and Marie of Artois, a descendant of Louis VIII of France. The wedding took place in October or early November 1335, possibly at Bohus castle. As a wedding gift Blanche received the province of Tunsberg in Norway and Lödöse in Sweden as fiefs. They had two sons, Erik and Haakon, plus at least two daughters who died in infancy and were buried at Ås Abbey.
Opposition to Magnus&#x27; rule in Norway led to a settlement between the king and the Norwegian nobility at Varberg on 15 August 1343. In violation of the Norwegian laws on royal inheritance, Magnus&#x27; younger son, Haakon, would become king of Norway, with Magnus as regent during his minority. Later the same year, it was declared that Magnus&#x27; elder son, Erik, would become king of Sweden on Magnus&#x27; death. Thus, the union between Norway and Sweden would be severed. This occurred when Haakon came of age in 1355.

Because of the increase in taxes to pay for the acquisition of the Scanian province, some Swedish nobles supported by the Church attempted to oust Magnus, setting up his elder son Erik as king. Erik died supposedly of the plague in 1359, with his wife Beatrix and their son.

== Peace of Nöteborg ==
On 12 August 1323, Magnus concluded the first treaty between Sweden and Novgorod (represented by Grand Prince Yury of Moscow) at Nöteborg (Orekhov) where Lake Ladoga empties into the Neva River. The treaty delineated spheres of influence among the Finns and Karelians and was supposed to be an &quot;eternal peace&quot;, but Magnus&#x27; relations with the Russian states were not so peaceful. In 1337, religious strife between Orthodox Karelians and the Swedes led to a Swedish attack on the town of Korela (Keksholm, Priozersk) and Viborg (Viipuri in Finnish, Vyborg in Russian), in which the Novgorodian and Ladogan merchants there were slaughtered. A Swedish commander named Sten also captured the fortress at Orekhov. Negotiations with the Novgorodian mayor (&quot;posadnik&quot;) Fedor were inconclusive and the Swedes attacked Karelians around Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega before a peace was concluded in 1339 along the old terms of the 1323 treaty. In this treaty, the Swedes claimed that Sten and others acted on their own without the consent of the king.

== Outlawing thralldom (slavery) ==

In 1335, Magnus outlawed thralldom (slavery) for thralls &quot;born by Christian parents&quot; in Västergötland and Värend, being the last parts of Sweden where slavery had remained legal. This put an end to Medieval Swedish slavery – though it was only applicable within the borders of Sweden, which left an opening – used long afterwards – for the 17th- and 18th-century Swedish slave trade.

== Crusade against Novgorod ==
Relations were quiet between Sweden and Novgorod until 1348, when Magnus led a crusade against Novgorod, marching up the Neva, forcibly converting the tribes along that river, and briefly capturing the fortress of Orekhov for a second time, in August. The city of Pskov took advantage of the situation and was able to pressure Novgorod into granting the city its formal independence. The Novgorodians retook the fortress in February 1349 after a six-month siege, without the aid of Pskov and with minimal aid from Moscow. Magnus fell back, in large part due to the ravages of the plague farther West. While he spent much of 1351 trying to drum up support for further crusading action among the German cities in the Baltic States, he never returned to attack Novgorod.

== Greenland ==
In 1355, Magnus sent a ship (or ships) to Greenland to inspect its Western and Eastern Settlements. Sailors found settlements entirely Norse and Christian. The Greenland carrier (&quot;Groenlands Knorr&quot;) made the Greenland run at intervals till 1369, when she sank and was apparently not replaced.

== Later years ==

King Valdemar IV of Denmark reconquered Scania in 1360. He went on to conquer Gotland in 1361. On 27 July 1361, outside the city of Visby, the main city of Gotland, the final battle took place. It ended in a complete victory for Valdemar. Magnus had warned the inhabitants of Visby in a letter and started to gather troops to reconquer Scania. Valdemar went home to Denmark again in August and took a lot of plunder with him. Either in late 1361 or early 1362 the inhabitants of Visby raised themselves against the few Danish that Valdemar left behind and killed them.

In 1363, members of the Swedish Council of Aristocracy, led by Bo Jonsson Grip, arrived at the court of Mecklenburg. They had been banished from Sweden after a revolt against King Magnus. At the nobles&#x27; request, Albert of Mecklenburg launched an invasion of Sweden supported by several German dukes and counts. Several Hanseatic cities and dukes in Northern Germany expressed support of the new king. Stockholm and Kalmar, with large Hanseatic populations, also welcomed the intervention. Albert was proclaimed King of Sweden and crowned on 18 February 1364.

Magnus found refuge with his younger son in Norway. According to Icelandic annals, he drowned in a shipwreck at Lyngholmen in Bømlafjorden on 1 December 1374. He had retained his sovereignty over Iceland until his death.

== Evaluation of his reign ==

In spite of his many formal expansions his rule was considered a period of decline both for the Swedish royal power and for Sweden as a whole. Foreign nations like Denmark (after its recovery in 1340) and Mecklenburg intervened and Magnus does not seem to have been able to counter internal opposition that arose. He was regarded as a weak king and criticised for giving favourites too much power.

Magnus&#x27;s young favourite courtier was Bengt Algotsson, whom he elevated to Duke of Finland and Halland, as well as Viceroy of the province of Scania. Because homosexuality was a mortal sin and vehemently scorned at that time, rumours about the king&#x27;s alleged love relationship with Algotsson, and other erotic escapades, were spread by his enemies, particularly by some noblemen who referred to mystical visions of St. Bridget. Bridget and these allegations caused Magnus in posterity to be given the epithet of &quot;Magnus smek (Magnus Caress)&quot; and caused him a lot of harm, but there is no factual basis for them in historical sources. Another angle is that the epithet &quot;Caress&quot; had nothing to do with the allegations of homosexuality but was given because of his alleged foolishness and naivety, as &quot;smek&quot; at the time was an insult inferring such weakness.

Russians drew up an allegedly autobiographical account known as the Testament of Magnus (&quot;Rukopisanie Magnusha&quot;) which was inserted into the Russian &quot;Sofia First Chronicle&quot;, composed in Novgorod; it claimed that Magnus did not, in fact, drown at sea, but saw the errors of his ways and converted to Orthodoxy, becoming a monk in a Novgorodian monastery in Karelia. The account is apocryphal.

==Popular culture==

Most of the Kristin Lavransdatter trilogy by Sigrid Undset takes place in Norway during Magnus&#x27;s reign. He appears in one scene, and is presented in a relatively critical manner.

<text>The snowy albatross (Diomedea exulans), also known as the wandering albatross, white-winged albatross, or goonie, is a large seabird from the family Diomedeidae; they have a circumpolar range in the Southern Ocean. It is the most recently described species of albatross and was long considered to be the same species as the Tristan albatross and the Antipodean albatross. Together with the Amsterdam albatross, it forms the wandering albatross species complex, which some began referring to more recently as &quot;snowy&quot;.

The snowy albatross is one of the two largest members of the genus &quot;Diomedea&quot; (the great albatrosses), being similar in size to the southern royal albatross. It has the greatest known wingspan of any living bird and is also one of the most far-ranging birds. Some individual snowy albatrosses are known to circumnavigate the Southern Ocean three times in one year, covering more than .

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomic history of this species is long and complicated. The species was first described as &quot;Diomedea exulans&quot; by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, based on a specimen from the Cape of Good Hope. &quot;Diomedea&quot; refers to Diomedes from Greek mythology whose companions turned to birds, and &quot;exulans&quot; or &quot;exsul&quot; are Latin for &quot;exile&quot; or &quot;wanderer&quot; referring to its extensive flights. The type locality has been restricted to South Georgia.

Some experts considered there to be four subspecies of &quot;D. exulans&quot;, which they elevated to species status, and use the term &quot;wandering albatross&quot; to refer to a species complex that includes the proposed species &quot;D. antipodensis&quot;, &quot;D. dabbenena&quot;, &quot;D. exulans&quot;, and &quot;D. gibsoni&quot;.

==Description==

The plumage varies with age, with the juveniles starting chocolate brown. As they age they become whiter. The adults have white bodies with black and white wings. Males have whiter wings than females, with just the tips and trailing edges of the wings black. The snowy albatross is the whitest of the wandering albatross species complex, the other species having a great deal more brown and black on the wings and body, very closely resembling immature wandering albatrosses. The large bill is pink, as are the feet. They also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. They excrete a high saline solution from their nose, which is a probable cause for the pink-yellow stain seen on some animals&#x27; necks.

=== Size ===

The snowy albatross has the longest wingspan of any living bird, reaching upwards of , with a mean span of in Bird Island, South Georgia. Wingspan measured an average of in 123 birds measured off the coast of Malabar, New South Wales. On the Crozet Islands, adults averaged in wingspan. The longest-winged specimens have been about . Two specimens have been reported having wingspans of and , but these reports remain unverified. As a result of its large wingspan, it is capable of remaining in the air without flapping its wings for several hours at a time (traveling 22m for every meter of drop). The length of the body is about with females being slightly smaller than males.

Adults can weigh from , although most will weigh . On Macquarie Island, three males averaged and three females averaged . In parts of the Crozet Islands, males averaged while females averaged . However, 10 unsexed adults from the Crozet Islands averaged . On South Georgia, 52 males were found to average while 53 females were found to average . On Île de la Possession, adult male snowy albatrosses averaged while adult females averaged . Another sampling of adult body masses from the same colony found males to average and females to average . Immature birds have been recorded weighing as much as during their first flights (at which time they may still have fat reserves that will be shed as they continue to fly). On South Georgia, fledglings were found to average . Albatrosses from outside the &quot;snowy&quot; wandering albatross group (&quot;D. exulans&quot;) are smaller but are now generally deemed to belong to different species.

==Distribution and habitat==
The snowy albatross breeds on South Georgia Island, Crozet Islands, Kerguelen Islands, Prince Edward Islands, and Macquarie Island, is seen feeding year-round off the Kaikōura Peninsula on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand, and ranges in all the southern oceans from 28° to 60°. Some individual snowy albatrosses are known to circumnavigate the Southern Ocean three times, covering more than , in one year. Snowy albatrosses spend most of their life in flight, landing only to breed and feed. Distances traveled each year are difficult to measure, but one banded bird was recorded traveling in twelve days.

==Behavior==

=== Feeding ===

Snowy albatrosses travel vast distances to find food, and tend to feed further out in open oceans and in colder waters further south, whereas other albatross such as the related royal albatross tend to forage in somewhat shallower waters and closer to continental shelves. They feed at the surface, mainly during daylight hours, and are not well adapted for diving. During flight, speeds of have been recorded. They feed on cephalopods, small fish, and crustaceans. The species has been shown to be attracted to fishing vessels, foraging on bait, caught fish, and offal.

===Reproduction===

The snowy albatross mates for life and breeds every other year. At breeding time they occupy loose colonies on isolated island groups in the Southern Ocean. When courting they will spread their wings, wave their heads, and rap their bills together while braying. Wanderers have a large range of displays from screams and whistles to grunts and bill clapping. They lay one egg that is white, with a few spots, and is about long. They lay between 10 December and 5 January. The nests are large bowls built of grassy vegetation and soil peat, that is 1 meter wide at the base and half a meter wide at the apex. Incubation takes about 11 weeks and both parents are involved. The 11-week incubation period is among the longest of any bird. During the early stages of the chick&#x27;s development, the parents take turns sitting on the nest while the other searches for food. Later, both adults search for food and visit the chick at irregular intervals. Researchers previously assumed that chicks went without food for the whole winter after a weaning period of roughly 12 to 16 weeks. Later studies disproved this concept, as chicks were found to be feeding during this period. They are a monogamous species, usually for life. Adolescents return to the colony within six years; however, they will not start breeding until 11 to 15 years. About 31.5% of fledglings survive. They can live for over 50 years.

==Relationship with humans==
Sailors used to capture the birds for their long wing bones, from which they made tobacco pipe stems. The early explorers of the great Southern Sea were cheered by the companionship of the albatross in their dreary solitudes, and as shown in Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; killing them was seen as extremely bad luck. The metaphor of &quot;an albatross around his neck&quot; also comes from the poem and indicates an unwanted burden causing anxiety or hindrance. In the days of sail the bird often accompanied ships for days, not merely following it, but wheeling in wide circles around it without ever being observed to land on the water. It continued its flight, apparently untired, in tempestuous as well as moderate weather.

The Māori of New Zealand used albatrosses as a food source. They caught them using baited hooks. Because the wing bones of albatross are light but very strong, Māori used them to make a number of different items including &quot;kōauau&quot; (flutes), needles, tattooing chisel blades, and barbs for fish hooks.

===Conservation===

The IUCN lists the snowy albatross as vulnerable status. Adult mortality is 5% to 7.8% per year as of 2003. It has an occurrence range of , although its breeding range is only .

The biggest threat to their survival is that they are attracted by the bait for longline fishing and get caught in the same way as the fish; however, pollution is also taking a toll, mainly from plastics and abandoned fishing hooks. The CCAMLR has introduced measures to reduce bycatch of albatrosses around South Georgia by 99%, and other regional fishing commissions are taking similar measures to reduce fatalities. The Prince Edward Islands are a nature preserve, the Macquarie Islands are a World Heritage site, and large parts of the Crozet Islands and the Kerguelen Islands are nature reserves.

<doc id="203048" wikidata="Q313015" url="?curid=203048" title="Haakon VI">
<text>Haakon VI (; ; August 1340 – 11 September 1380) was King of Norway from 1343 until his death and King of Sweden between 1362 and 1364. He is sometimes known as &quot;Haakon Magnusson the Younger&quot; to distinguish him from his great-grandfather, Haakon V ().

Haakon was the younger son of Magnus Eriksson, king of both Norway and Sweden. His older brother Eric was meant to succeed their father on the throne of Sweden, while Haakon was made king of Norway in his father&#x27;s lifetime. Magnus greatly favored Haakon over Eric, leading to the latter&#x27;s rebellion and seizure of Southern Sweden. Eric died in 1359, and Haakon became co-ruler of Sweden with his father three years later. The two reigned over Sweden together until 1364, when they were deposed in favor of Magnus&#x27; sororal nephew, Albert of Mecklenburg, by a clique of exiled Swedish noblemen led by Bo Jonsson Grip. Magnus and Haakon tried to retake the Swedish throne, but without success.

In 1363, Haakon married Margaret, daughter of Valdemar IV of Denmark. The marriage, itself a significant element in the Nordic power struggle, resulted in the birth of one son, Olav. Haakon&#x27;s continuous conflicts with his father-in-law ended only with the latter&#x27;s death in 1375. Haakon seized the opportunity to have his son elected Valdemar&#x27;s successor, defeating the claims of his and his wife&#x27;s Mecklenburg relatives.

Upon his death in 1380, Haakon was succeeded by Olav, with Margaret as regent. Olav died childless seven years later, and Haakon&#x27;s widow proceeded to assert authority over all three Scandinavian kingdoms as their first female monarch.

==Early life==

Haakon was born in 1340 (possibly in mid-August), most likely in Sweden, though the exact date and location of his birth remain unknown. He was the younger son of Magnus Eriksson, king of Sweden and Norway, and Blanche of Namur. His older brother Eric was a rival king of Sweden in opposition to his father between 1356 and 1359. Haakon and his paternal family belonged to the Swedish House of Bjälbo, which had succeeded the House of Eric in Sweden and the House of Sverre in Norway. Haakon was a great-grandson of Haakon V of Norway through his only legitimate daughter, Ingeborg, and was considered an acceptable heir to the throne by the Norwegian nobility. Another noteworthy ancestor of Haakon, through his paternal grandfather Eric Magnusson, Duke of Södermanland, is King Magnus Ladulås of Sweden.

== Accession in Norway ==
Haakon was raised in Norway, to prepare the young prince to later rule the kingdom in his own right. During the early autumn of 1343, the most prominent members of the Norwegian Council of the Realm attended a meeting with Magnus at Varberg Castle. On 15 August 1343, letters were issued throughout Norway and Sweden stating that the King and the Council had decided to place Haakon on the throne of Norway.

Barely a year later, representatives of the cities and the general public assembled at Båhus Castle, where they hailed Haakon as their king and took the oath of perpetual fealty and servitude to him. Though the meeting at Båhus Castle forged historic ties to the old elective monarchy in Norway, the acclamation documents created by the Council of the Realm stipulated that Haakon was to rule over only parts of Norway, and it was also carefully documented that the Norwegian Law of Succession would apply if he were to die leaving no legitimate son, thereby ensuring that the hereditary monarchy would be upheld. The next in line to the Norwegian throne would then be his older brother Eric and his descendants, but the provision became moot when Eric died in 1359. The meetings at Varberg Castle in 1343 and at Båhus Castle in 1344 were later properly ratified in another meeting in the port city of Bergen as late as 1350.

Magnus abdicated his Norwegian throne sometime between 8 and 18 August in 1355. Haakon would then rule as the sole king in the kingdom, though his father continued to exercise control over Norway in the following years, albeit not in name anymore. The first documented event in which Haakon acted as sole king and ruler over his kingdom was on 22 January 1358, when he sent a letter of approval for the privileges in the city of Oslo. Norway in 1355 was actually partitioned between Haakon and Magnus: Magnus had specifically requested the territories of Hålogaland and the Norwegian islands in the North Sea at the ratification meeting in Bergen in 1350. Magnus additionally held the territories of Tønsberg and Skien, and he was also the real ruler over the territories of Borgar and most of Bohuslän which were held as personal fiefs by Queen Blanche. Because of this, the realm of Magnus was centered in the south-east, up against the important south-Swedish countryside and the Swedish-held Scania province.

== Accession in Sweden ==
As king, Haakon was immediately pulled into his father&#x27;s internal strife in Sweden, where a growing conflict eventually had erupted into open warfare. Eric was discontent with his father&#x27;s rule, likely because he had not been granted a membership in the Swedish Council of the Realm, and because of favouritism Magnus had shown his youngest son. With Eric as a rallying figure, a part of Sweden&#x27;s most powerful nobility rose up in rebellion against the rule of Magnus. The rebellion was short-lived however and Magnus and Eric made peace with each other a year after the conflict erupted. Eric &quot;XII&quot; was elevated to King of Sweden and was made co-ruler with his father in the subsequent peace agreement. Eric was also given dominion over Southern Sweden. It all took a dramatic turn when Eric suddenly died of the plague in 1359. In accordance with the peace agreement between father and eldest son in 1357, the Swedish nobility soon deposed Magnus and elected Haakon as King of Sweden in Uppsala 15 February 1362. From 1357 Haakon had styled himself &quot;Lord of Sweden&quot;, but dropped this title upon his election and styled himself &quot;King of Norway and Sweden&quot;.

== Marriage ==
In 1359, Valdemar IV of Denmark&#x27;s younger daughter, Margaret, was betrothed to Haakon in a marriage contract intended to be a part of a larger alliance treaty between Magnus and Valdemar. It was presumed that Valdemar would assist Magnus in the aforementioned rebellion, started by his eldest son Eric, by invading the province of Scania, which had been pawned by Christopher II of Denmark before his death in 1332 to Magnus and had been under Swedish rule since. Valdemar in turn would receive Helsingborg Castle as compensation for that assistance, but in June 1359 Eric unexpectedly died of the plague and Magnus tried to renege on his promise to return the castle to the Danish Crown. Valdemar was far too ambitious a ruler to have his plan to reassemble the Danish kingdom fall into pieces, and so he proceeded to invade Scania in 1360 with his mercenary army. The Danish forces quickly occupied the province and started besieging Helsingborg Castle, eventually forcing the Swedish garrison to surrender and capturing the castle. When the castle was captured, Valdemar had virtually regained control over all of Scania, and when Magnus proved to be unable to retake the province by force, it simply passed back to Danish rule. Further strife between the two kingdoms would put the marriage contract on hold for a few years until the two parties eventually reconciled in 1363; Haakon and Margaret were married that year in the Copenhagen Cathedral. Margaret&#x27;s marriage was broadly considered to be a part of the Nordic power struggle.

== Rebellion in Sweden ==

In 1363, former members of the Swedish Council of the Realm, led by Bo Jonsson Grip, arrived at the court in the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The Swedish noblemen promptly persuaded Duke Albert II of Mecklenburg, who had gained influence in the affairs of Sweden by marrying Magnus&#x27; sister Euphemia, to intervene against Magnus and Haakon in Sweden and depose them both in favour of his and Euphemia&#x27;s son Albert. In 1364, Duke Albert enlisted military support from several powerful North German noblemen and proceeded to swiftly invade and conquer Sweden and subsequently installed his son as the new king. In November 1365, the younger Albert was formally hailed as Sweden&#x27;s new king, though he had already been crowned on 18 February 1364. Magnus sought refuge with his son in Norway where they immediately planned the reconquest of Sweden. After an invasion, a temporary truce was established between the two warring parties, and though Haakon and Magnus had lost control over much of Sweden, they still maintained control over the important provinces of Västergötland, Dalsland and Värmland.

In early 1365, Haakon and Magnus assembled a large army in Västergötland, consisting mainly of Norwegians, but also a large number of Swedes from the said province, and marched on the German-held city of Stockholm. On 27 February, Haakon issued a proclamation against Albert of Mecklenburg and his supporters, encouraging the local populace to stir up in rebellion against the German usurper. The Norwegian army entered Uppland through Västerås and clashed against the Swedish-German army in the disastrous Battle of Gataskogen where Haakon and Magnus suffered a devastating defeat and Magnus was captured and taken prisoner by the Germans; which he would remain for six years.

The chief foreign policy of Haakon was now to retrieve Sweden from the Germans and his father from captivity. He was still in possession of West Sweden and found that he could rely on the support from several noblemen who were displeased with the Germans. The war between Norway and Sweden continued, and Haakon soon found himself in need of allies. He entered into an alliance with King Valdemar, the father of his wife, which was something that later would dramatically concentrate the Norwegian foreign policy to the east, rather than to the traditional west. After a turbulent conflict and war against the North German cities and the Hanseatic League, Haakon was again free to turn his attention to Sweden, and launched a successful campaign against the Germans in Sweden. The military campaign ended in the Siege of Stockholm in 1371, where it looked like Haakon could decisively defeat the Germans and acquire revenge for his defeat at the Battle of Gataskogen; but Albert and his German supporters managed to withstand the siege and Haakon was forced to sign a peace treaty. The treaty was signed on 14 August 1371, and Haakon would have to be content with having his father released from captivity against a large ransom. When released, Magnus resumed ruling his remaining domains in Norway and Sweden until his death in 1374 only three years later.

== Foreign policies in the east ==

In 1361, Valdemar had invaded and conquered the Swedish province of Scania, as well as the two islands of Öland and Gotland, and captured the major Hanseatic town of Visby in the process. In 1361, the Hanseatic League&#x27;s fleet launched a counter-strike at the Danish fleet, culminating in the Battle of Helsingborg in which the Danish fleet inflicted a devastating defeat upon the League&#x27;s fleet. Furthermore, the League was forced to accept a humiliating truce, which eventually led to the unfavourable Treaty of Vordingborg, severely curtailing the League&#x27;s power and influence. In Norway, Haakon had shifted his political and foreign affairs towards the east, and the reconquest of his Swedish kingdom was in particular his strongest motivation for the alliance with the recuperating Danish kingdom. The alliance between the Norwegians and the Danes threatened to shift the political and military power in the Nordic and Baltic areas, and in 1365 a series of German protests in the city of Bergen eventually forced the Hanseatic office on Bryggen in the city to be closed until 1366, which temporarily damaged the trade for the kingdom.

Valdemar was unable to enforce the fragile peace with the Hanseatic cities, and in 1367 the League founded the Confederation of Cologne against Denmark and Norway to counter the growing ambitions of the two allied kings. The Confederation renewed their alliance with German-held Sweden and assembled a large fleet of warships and subsequently assaulted the Norwegian coast and continued to raid it all the way to Agder. Also, the Confederation launched a successful campaign against Valdemar in Denmark, which turned out to be disastrous for Valdemar&#x27;s plans to reassemble the Danish kingdom. The Confederation raided and pillaged the Danish coast, invaded the province of Danish-held Scania, and even captured and looted the city of Copenhagen through a successful siege. This, in combination with the rebellious nobles in Jutland, forced Valdemar to flee his kingdom during Easter in 1368.

Realizing the futility in a prolonged and costly war, as well as Haakon&#x27;s wavering support for the disastrous conflict, Valdemar appointed his friend and advisor, Rigsdrost Henning Podebusk, to negotiate peace with the Confederation in his absence. The Confederation agreed to a truce, but only on the promise of having Valdemar acknowledge their right to tax exemption on trade across the entire Baltic Sea and renewed fishing rights in the Danish Sound. In addition to this, the Confederation forced Valdemar to grant the Hanseatic League a considerable amount of influence over the future Danish king-elections, including the right to veto against any throne candidate. Lastly, the Confederation put several towns on the coast of Scania and Helsingborg Castle under the control of the Hanseatic League for a fixed period of fifteen years.

On 24 May 1370, representatives from the Hanseatic cities, Denmark and Norway signed the Treaty of Stralsund at Båhus Castle and formally ended the war between them, the treaty included an extension of the already established truce for an additional five years. Through this treaty, the Hanseatic League reached its pinnacle of power in the region with a virtual monopoly on lucrative trade. The defeat at the hands of the Hanseatic cities was another humiliating blow to the foreign policies of Haakon in the east. Not only did the power of the monarch gradually weaken under the mounting pressure and influence of the Hanseatic cities, but the Norwegian trade also suffered as a consequence of the Hanseatic monopoly. Haakon became less interested in Danish affairs following the military failures against the Hanseatic cities, and would again turn his attention to his chief foreign policy of retaking Sweden from the Germans, something which he would have some limited success with in the following years. However, Haakon would gain a renewed interest in Danish affairs when the opportunity to have his son elected king of Denmark arose upon Valdemar&#x27;s death in 1375.

== Danish succession ==
On 24 October 1375, Valdemar succumbed to illness and died at Gurre Castle in Zealand. The new monarch would have to be elected by the Danish Council of the Realm and any potential candidate had to be approved by the Hanseatic League. As Valdemar left no immediate clear successor to the throne, two candidates were put forward for the election: Haakon and Margaret suggested their only son, Olav, as a claimant to the throne. Their brother-in-law Henry of Mecklenburg (widower of Margaret&#x27;s sister older Ingeborg and another son of Haakon&#x27;s aunt Euphemia) in turn suggested his son (their nephew) Albert as a rival claimant.

Haakon, having already lost a substantial portion of his Swedish realm to the Germans, would go to great and costly lengths to assure his son&#x27;s accession to the Danish throne. To accomplish this, Haakon borrowed large sums of money and offered it to the Hanseatic League in return for the League&#x27;s neutrality in the upcoming election, which they promptly accepted. In addition to this, the Danish Council of the Realm was more inclined to a potential union and alliance with Norway, largely because of anti-German sentiments within the Council, and the general reluctance to have a second German ruler in Scandinavia. On 3 May 1376, Olav was elected king in Slagelse, succeeding his grandfather. The election proved to be a major victory for Haakon and his foreign ambitions, curtailing the German influence while greatly expanding his own over much of Scandinavia.

== Domestic policies ==

In 1349, the Black Death was brought to Bergen on board an English merchant ship to devastating effects, killing between 50% and 60% of the population, leaving the kingdom in a period of social and economic decline. The kingdom&#x27;s financial framework (which was originally weak) virtually collapsed as the plague ravaged through the realm, and the aggressive foreign policies of Haakon would in addition take a heavy toll on the kingdom&#x27;s decaying economy. In 1371, Haakon acquired the release of his father from German imprisonment against a large ransom sum of 12,000 silver marks, which alone was more than the kingdom&#x27;s ordinary tax incomes just before the outbreak of the plague. A special tax had to be imposed on Haakon&#x27;s subjects to pay for the ransom.

In 1379, Haakon resolved the succession dispute over the Earldom of Orkney, a Norwegian dignity located within the Kingdom of Scotland. On 2 August the same year, at Marstrand near Tønsberg, Haakon invested and confirmed the title of Earl of Orkney upon Henry Sinclair, Baron of Roslin (a grandson of Maol Íosa V, Earl of Strathearn) over the rival claim of Sinclair&#x27;s cousin, Malise Sparre. In return, Sinclair pledged to pay a sum of 1000 nobles before 11 November the same year, and when called upon, was to serve the Norwegian king on Orkney or elsewhere with 100 equipped and armed men for up to three months. As a security for upholding this arrangement, Sinclair had to leave behind valued hostages when he departed for his earldom. It is unknown if Haakon ever attempted to call upon the forces pledged by Sinclair, or if the agreed sum was ever actually paid in full. Shortly before his death in 1380, Haakon permitted the hostages to return home.

Furthermore, throughout Haakon&#x27;s reign he reportedly had an unproblematic relationship with the church. Also, throughout his rule, especially after the loss of Sweden to the Germans, a noticeable number of Swedish noblemen pledged their support to Haakon and settled on Norwegian lands. The generally accepted reason was because of their displeasure towards the German usurper and his favoritism towards his own kinsmen. Curiously enough, German noblemen from Mecklenburg reportedly entered the service of Haakon during his reign.

== Military policies ==
Throughout the reign of Haakon, the Norwegian military was extensively reformed. The military structure was altered from that of the traditional &quot;leidang&quot; peasant conscription to under the direct control of loyal Norwegian lords. His Norwegian predecessor had pursued a domestic policy to establish a functional civil service in his realm, also extending to the military. This was however not continued by Haakon who elected to transfer more power and military responsibilities on to loyal lords. As a consequence, Haakon would be able to field much larger armies, but it became increasingly expensive to maintain this system. Because of the war against Sweden and the aggressive Norwegian policies in the east, Haakon had to mortgage and borrow money at an unprecedented scale to maintain his armies, and had to increasingly rely on the Norwegian nobility and the rich German merchants. The substantial rise in foreign debt would eventually come to shift the political power in Norway, and gradually weakened the power of the monarch.

== Later life and death ==
Nearing his final days, Haakon was exhausted by the almost constant warfare and the straining conflict with his cousin, Albert of Mecklenburg. It has been speculated that this, in addition to the considerable financial difficulties of Haakon&#x27;s reign, may have contributed to his early death. Haakon never ceased to pursue his inherited responsibility to reclaim the lost Swedish territories, and would in March 1380 issue letters to prepare for war against the Germans in Sweden. The letters requested that the &quot;leidang&quot; fleet should be assembled and made ready for departure. Apparently, the Germans had broken the previous peace treaty and conspired to wage war against Haakon. However, there are no existing records of any war or battles fought during this period of time. 

Sometime during the late summer or early in the autumn Haakon died in Oslo, barely reaching the age of forty. He was buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Oslo. His son succeeded him as the King of Norway with Queen Margaret acting as his regent.

<doc id="203049" wikidata="Q602598" url="?curid=203049" title="Black-browed albatross">
<text>The black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophris), also known as the black-browed mollymawk, is a large seabird of the albatross family Diomedeidae; it is the most widespread and common member of its family.

==Taxonomy==
Mollymawks are albatrosses in the family Diomedeidae and order Procellariiformes, which also includes shearwaters, fulmars, storm petrels, and diving petrels. These birds share certain identifying features. They have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns, although the nostrils on the albatross are on the sides of the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. They produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This is used against predators as well as being an energy-rich food source for chicks and also for the adults during their long flights. The albatross also has a salt gland above the nasal passage which helps to remove salt from the ocean water that they imbibe. The gland excretes a high saline solution through the bird&#x27;s nose.

In 1998, Robertson and Nunn published their view that the Campbell albatross (&quot;Thalassarche impavida&quot;), should be split from this species (&quot;T. melanophris&quot;). Over the course of the next few years, others agreed, including BirdLife International in 2000, and Brooke in 2004. James Clements did not adopt the split, the ACAP has not yet adopted the split, and the SACC recognizes the need for a proposal.

The black-browed albatross was first described as &quot;Diomedea melanophris&quot; by Coenraad Jacob Temminck, in 1828, based on a specimen from the Cape of Good Hope.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name &quot;melanophris&quot; comes from two Greek words &quot;melas&quot; or &quot;melanos&quot;, meaning &quot;black&quot;, and &quot;ophris&quot;, meaning &quot;eyebrow&quot;, referring to dark feathering around the eyes.

==Description==

The black-browed albatross is a medium-sized albatross, at long with a wingspan and an average weight of . It can have a natural lifespan of over 70 years. It has a dark grey saddle and upperwings that contrast with the white rump, and underparts. The underwing is predominantly white with broad, irregular, black margins. It has a dark eyebrow and a yellow-orange bill with a darker reddish-orange tip. Juveniles have dark horn-colored bills with dark tips, and a grey head and collar. They also have dark underwings. The features that distinguish it from other mollymawks (except the closely related Campbell albatross) are the dark eyestripe which gives it its name, a broad black edging to the white underside of its wings, white head and orange bill, tipped darker orange. The Campbell albatross is very similar but with a pale eye. Immature birds are similar to grey-headed albatrosses but the latter have wholly dark bills and more complete dark head markings.

==Range and habitat==
The black-browed albatross is circumpolar in the southern oceans, and it breeds on 12 islands throughout that range. In the Atlantic Ocean, it breeds on the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and the Cape Horn Islands. In the Pacific Ocean it breeds on Islas Ildefonso, Diego de Almagro, Islas Evangelistas, Campbell Island, Antipodes Islands, Snares Islands, and Macquarie Island. In the Indian Ocean it breeds on the Crozet Islands, Kerguelen Islands, Heard Island, and McDonald Island.

There are an estimated 1,220,000 birds alive with 600,853 breeding pairs, as estimated by a 2005 count. Of these birds, 402,571 breed in the Falklands, 72,102 breed on South Georgia Island, 120,171 breed on the Chilean islands of Islas Ildefonso, Diego de Almagro, Islas Evangelistas, and Islas Diego Ramírez. 600 pairs breed on Heard Island, Finally, the remaining 5,409 pairs breed on the remaining islands. This particular species of albatross prefers to forage over shelf and shelf-break areas. Falkland Island birds winter near the Patagonian Shelf, and birds from South Georgia forage in South African waters, using the Benguela Current, and the Chilean birds forage over the Patagonian Shelf, the Chilean Shelf, and even make it as far as New Zealand. It is the most likely albatross to be found in the North Atlantic due to a northerly migratory tendency. There have been 20 possible sightings in the Continental United States.

==Behaviour==

Colonies are very noisy as they bray to mark their territory, and also cackle harshly. They use their fanned tail in courting displays.

===Feeding===
The black-browed albatross feeds on fish, squid, crustaceans, carrion, and fishery discards. This species has been observed stealing food from other species.

===Reproduction===
This species normally nests on steep slopes covered with tussock grass and sometimes on cliffs; however, on the Falklands it nests on flat grassland on the coast. They are an annual breeder laying one egg from between 20 September and 1 November, although the Falklands, Crozet, and Kerguelen breeders lay about three weeks earlier. Incubation is done by both sexes and lasts 68 to 71 days. After hatching, the chicks take 120 to 130 days to fledge. Juveniles will return to the colony after two to three years but only to practice courtship rituals, as they start breeding around the 10th year.

==Conservation==
Until 2013, the IUCN classified this species as endangered due to a drastic reduction in population. Bird Island near South Georgia Island had a 4% per year loss of nesting pairs, and the Kerguelen Island population had a 17% reduction from 1979 to 1995. Diego Ramírez decreased in the 1980s but has rebounded recently, and the Falklands had a surge in the 1980s probably due to abundant fish waste from trawlers; however, recent censuses have shown drastic reduction in the majority of the nesting sites there. There has been a 67% decline in the population over 64 years.

Increased longline fishing in the southern oceans, especially around the Patagonian Shelf and around South Georgia has been attributed as a major cause of the decline of this bird, The black-browed albatross has been found to be the most common bird killed by fisheries. Trawl fishing, especially around the Patagonian Shelf and near South Africa, is also a large cause of deaths.

Conservation efforts underway start with this species being placed on Convention on Migratory Species Appendix II, and Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels Annex 1. It is being monitored on half of the islands, and most of the breeding sites are reserves. Heard Island, McDonald Island, Macquarie Island, and the New Zealand islands are World Heritage Sites. An initial Chilean census has also been completed.

==Vagrancy==
Although this is a rare occurrence, on several occasions a black-browed albatross has summered in Scottish gannet colonies (Bass Rock, Hermaness and now Sula Sgeir) for a number of years. Ornithologists believe that it was the same bird, known as &quot;Albert&quot;, who lives in north Scotland. It is believed that the bird was blown off course into the North Atlantic in 1967. A similar incident took place in the gannet colony in the Faroe Islands island of Mykines, where a black-browed albatross lived among the gannets for over 30 years. This incident is the reason why an albatross is referred to as a &quot;gannet king&quot; (Faroese: súlukongur) in Faroese. In July 2013 the first recorded sighting of a black-browed albatross in the Bahamas was made from the Bahamas Marine Mammal Research Organisation&#x27;s research vessel, off Sandy Point, Abaco. For four consecutive years from 2014 on, a bird - probably the same individual named &quot;Albert&quot; - has been sighted over Heligoland, and on the east coast of England.

<text>Valdemar IV Atterdag (the epithet meaning &quot;Return of the Day&quot;), Valdemar Christoffersen or Waldemar (24 October 1375) was King of Denmark from 1340 to 1375. He is mostly known for his reunion of Denmark after the bankruptcy and mortgaging of the country to finance wars under previous rulers.

==Accession==
He was the youngest son of King Christopher II of Denmark and Euphemia of Pomerania. He spent most of his childhood and youth in exile at the court of Emperor Louis IV in Bavaria, after the defeats of his father and the death and imprisonment, respectively, of his two older brothers, Eric and Otto, at the hand of the Holsteiners. Here he acted as a pretender, waiting for a comeback.

Following the assassination of Gerhard III, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg, by Niels Ebbesen and his warriors, Valdemar was proclaimed king of Denmark at the Viborg Assembly (&quot;landsting&quot;) on St John&#x27;s Day (St Hans&#x27; Day) on 24 June 1340, led by Ebbesen. Through his marriage with Helvig of Schleswig, the daughter of Eric II, Duke of Schleswig and what he inherited from his father, he controlled about one-quarter of the territory of Jutland north of the Kongeå river. He was not compelled to sign a charter as his father had done, probably because Denmark had been without a king for years, and no one expected the twenty-year-old king to be any more trouble to the great nobles than his father had been. But Valdemar was a clever and determined man and realized that the only way to rule Denmark was to get control of its territory. Ebbesen attempted to liberate central Jutland from the Holsteiners at the siege of Sønderborg Castle on 2 November 1340, but Ebbesen and his men were surrounded and killed by the Germans.

==Reunification of Denmark==
Under his father, King Christopher II, Denmark went bankrupt and was mortgaged out in parcels. King Valdemar IV sought to repay the debt and reclaim the lands of Denmark. The first opportunity came with his wife Helvig&#x27;s dowry. The mortgage on the rest of northern Jutland was paid off by taxes collected from King Valdemar&#x27;s peasants above the Kongeå. In 1344, he recovered North Friesland, which he immediately taxed to pay off the debt on southern Jutland (7,000 silver marks). The over-taxed peasants grew restive under the constant demands for money.

Valdemar next set his sights on Zealand. The bishop of Roskilde, who owned Copenhagen Castle and town, gave both to Valdemar, providing a secure base from which to gather taxes on trade through the Sound (the Øresund). He was the first Danish king to rule from Copenhagen. Valdemar was able to capture or buy other castles and fortresses until he could force the Holsteiners out. When he ran out of money, he tried to take Kalundborg and Søborg Castles by force. While in the midst of that campaign, he went to Estonia to negotiate with the Teutonic Knights who controlled Estonia. Danes had never migrated there in any numbers, and so for 19,000 marks Valdemar gave up Danish Estonia, a far-off eastern province, which allowed him to pay off mortgages of parts of Denmark that were more important to him.

Around 1346 Valdemar IV initiated a crusade against Lithuania. Franciscan chronicler Detmar von Lübeck noted that Valdemar IV traveled to Lübeck in 1346, then turned to Prussia together with Eric II of Saxony in order to fight the Lithuanians. However, the crusade against the Lithuanians came to nothing, instead, Valdemar went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem (without Papal permission). He succeeded and was made a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre in honor of his accomplishment. He was censured by Pope Clement VI for not getting prior approval for such a journey.

Upon his return, Valdemar gathered an army. In 1346, he took back Vordingborg Castle, the main headquarters of the Holsteiners. By the end of the year, Valdemar could claim all of Zealand as his own. He made Vordingborg his personal residence, expanded the castle, and built the Goose Tower which has become the symbol of the town. Valdemar&#x27;s reputation for ruthlessness against those who opposed him made many think carefully about switching sides. His tax policy crushed the peasants who feared to do anything but pay up. By 1347 Valdemar had thrown out the Germans and once again Denmark was a nation.

With his increased income, Valdemar was able to pay for a larger army and by treachery came into possession of Nyborg Castle and eastern Funen Island and the smaller islands. Valdemar&#x27;s attention had just turned to Scania, held by Sweden when disaster struck the entire region.

==Black Death==
In 1349 the Black Death arrived. Tradition has it that bubonic plague came to Denmark on a ghost ship that beached itself on the coast of northern Jutland. Those who went aboard found the dead swollen and black-faced, but stayed long enough to take everything of value from it and thereby introduced the fleas that carried the disease into the population. People began to die by the thousands. During the next two years, plague swept through Denmark like a forest fire. In Ribe twelve parishes ceased to exist in a single diocese. A few towns simply died with no one left alive. The general figures for plague in 1349–50 ranged between 33% and 66% of the people of Denmark. City dwellers were often harder hit than farm folk leading many people to abandon towns altogether. Valdemar remained untouched and took advantage of the deaths of his enemies to add to his growing lands and properties. He refused to reduce the taxes the following year though fewer peasants farmed less land. Nobles, too, felt their incomes shrink and the tax burdens fell heavier on them as well. Uprisings flared up in the following years.

==Final pieces==
In 1350, Valdemar IV formed an alliance with Poland against the Teutonic Knights.

In 1354 the King and nobles met together as the Danish Court (&quot;Danehof&quot;) and worked out a peace settlement among the parties. The terms of the charter said that the Danehof was to meet at least once a year on St. John&#x27;s Day, 24 June. The old system established in 1282 was reinstated and everyone&#x27;s rights reverted to the traditional ones from before Christopher II&#x27;s charter which gutted the powers of the king.

Valdemar responded by raising an army and marching through southern Jutland taking still more pieces of the lands that German counts had pried away from Denmark in the previous years. Rebellion spread quickly through Funen and he ravaged the Holsteiners&#x27; remaining territories and took the rest of the island. The charter proved to be useless when the king ignored the terms and the sporadic rebellions continued. That same year there was a monetary crisis which caused panic all over northern Europe.

There is a famous poem, written by Jens Peter Jacobsen and included in his work &quot;Gurresange&quot;, about Valdemar&#x27;s mistress, Tove, who was killed on the orders of Queen Helvig, though that particular legend originally seems to be connected with his ancestor Valdemar I of Denmark. It was later set to music by Arnold Schoenberg from 1900 to 1903 (and 1910) as his &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot;.

In 1358 Valdemar went back to Funen to try to reconcile with Jutland leader Niels Bugge (c. 1300-c. 1358) and several other nobles and two bishops. The king refused to meet their terms, so they left the meeting in disgust. When they reached the town of Middelfart to find a ship to carry them over to Jutland, the fishermen they hired to transport them, murdered them. King Valdemar was blamed and the restive people of Jutland came out in open rebellion once again. They agreed to support each other in their fight to restore the rights the king once again had abrogated.

Valdemar turned once again to Scania which still lay under Swedish rule. In 1355, Prince Eric XII of Sweden rebelled against his father, King Magnus IV of Sweden, taking Scania and other parts of Sweden. King Magnus turned to Valdemar and entered into an agreement with him for help with Erik. Erik suddenly died in 1359. Valdemar crossed the Sound with an army and forced Magnus to give up Helsingborg in 1360. With the taking of Helsingborg, Valdemar for all intents regained Scania. Magnus wasn&#x27;t strong enough to hold Scania, so it passed back to Danish control. Valdemar captured Halland, Blekinge, and Scania.

==Foreign policy after 1360==
Valdemar could do little about the increasing power of the Hanseatic League which had already become a major power in the region. Even before the conclusion of the small conflict with King Magnus, Valdemar decided to attack the Swedish island of Gotland, specifically the town of Visby. He raised an army, loaded them onto ships, and invaded Gotland in 1361. Valdemar fought the Gotlanders and defeated them in front of the city, killing 1800 men. The city surrendered, and Valdemar tore down part of the wall to make his entry. Once in possession, he set up three huge beer barrels and informed the city fathers that if the barrels weren&#x27;t filled with silver and gold within three days, he would turn his men loose to pillage the town.
To Valdemar&#x27;s surprise, the barrels were filled before nightfall of the first day passed. The churches were stripped of their valuables and the riches were loaded on Danish ships and carried home to Vordingborg, Valdemar&#x27;s residence. Valdemar added &quot;King of Gotland&quot; to his title list. But his action against Visby, a member of the Hanseatic League, would have dire consequences later.

Valdemar tried to interfere with the succession in Sweden by capturing Countess Elizabeth who was to marry Crown Prince Håkon of Sweden. She was forced into a nunnery and Valdemar convinced King Magnus that his son should marry Valdemar&#x27;s daughter, Margrethe. The king agreed, but the nobles did not and forced Magnus to abdicate.
They elected Albrecht of Mecklenburg, one of Valdemar&#x27;s sworn enemies, as King of Sweden. Albrecht immediately went to work to stop Valdemar in his tracks. He persuaded the Hansa states to work with him because Valdemar threatened their access through the Sound and to the lucrative herring trade.

Valdemar attacked the Hansa fleet trying to force them out of the Sound fishing grounds. The Hansa member states demanded action. With Lübeck in the lead, they wrote to Valdemar complaining about his interference with trade. 
In 1362 the Hansa states, Sweden, and Norway allied against Valdemar seeking retribution. The Hansa sent a fleet and an army to ravage the coasts of Denmark, and they succeeded in capturing and pillaging Copenhagen and parts of Scania. Combined with the rebellious nobles in Jutland, they forced Valdemar out of Denmark at Easter in 1368.

In 1363, Valdemar IV renewed his alliance with Poland.

He appointed his friend and advisor Henning Podebusk (c. 1350 – c. 1388) to negotiate with the Hanseatic League in his absence. They agreed to a truce so long as Valdemar acknowledged their right to free trade and fishing rights in the Sound. They took control of several towns on the coast of Scania and the fortress at Helsingborg for 15 years. They also forced the king to grant the Hanseatic League a say in Denmark&#x27;s succession after Valdemar&#x27;s death.
Valdemar was forced to sign the Treaty of Stralsund in 1370, which acknowledged Hansa&#x27;s rights to participate in the herring trade and tax exemptions for its trading fleet. The king was able to return to Denmark after an absence of four years. Valdemar received Gotland, however, so even in defeat he was able to salvage something for himself and Denmark.

==Death==

Even while dealing with the Hansa states, he was trying to suppress rebellious nobles who tried to assert the rights they had forced Valdemar&#x27;s father to concede and fight the Swedes and Norwegians. He was in the process of taking gradual control of southern Jutland when he fell ill.
Valdemar enlisted the help of Pope Gregory XI who agreed to excommunicate rebellious Danes. But before anything along those lines was done, Valdemar died at Gurre Castle in North Zealand on 24 October 1375 and was buried at Sorø Abbey. When Podebusk died, he was buried next to Valdemar at Sorø Abbey.

==Legacy==
King Valdemar was a pivotal figure in Danish history; he gradually reacquired the lost territories that had been added to Denmark over the centuries. His heavy-handed methods, endless taxation, and usurpation of rights long held by noble families led to uprisings throughout Valdemar&#x27;s reign. His attempt to recreate Denmark as a power in northern Europe was welcomed by the Danes in the beginning, but Valdemar&#x27;s policies were met with bitter opposition by the great landed families of Jutland. He expanded the powers of the king based upon his military prowess and the loyal nobility that became the foundation of Danish rulers until 1440. Many foreigners were appointed as court officials and councilors. The most important of them was the German-Slavic nobleman Henning Podebusk who was drost (prime minister) from 1365 to 1388.

Valdemar IV is often regarded as one of the most important of all Danish medieval kings. The sources give the impression of an intelligent, cynical, reckless, and clever ruler with a talent for both policies and economy. His grandson Albert by his eldest daughter Ingeborg was offered unsuccessfully by his grandfather Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg as Valdemar&#x27;s successor. Instead, his grandson Olaf II, the offspring of his daughter Margaret and Haakon VI of Norway, son of Magnus Eriksson, was elected as his successor.

His nickname &quot;Atterdag&quot; is usually interpreted as &quot;day again&quot; (its literal meaning in Danish), indicating that he brought new hope to the realm after a dark period of bad kingship. The epithet has also been suggested as a misinterpretation of the Middle Low German phrase &quot;ter tage&quot; (&quot;these days&quot;), which can best be interpreted as &quot;what times we live in!&quot; In his biography of Valdemar, Fletcher Pratt stated it meant &quot;another day&quot;, that is, whatever happened today, good or bad, tomorrow would be another day.

Many stories, ballads, and poems have been made about Valdemar. He was &quot;reinvented&#x27; as one of the Danish hero kings during the mid-19th century when Denmark was fighting Germany for its traditional southern Jutland region.

==Issue==
In the 1330s, Valdemar V, Duke of Schleswig (previous king of Denmark as Valdemar III) made an alliance with Valdemar IV against his uncle, Gerhard III, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg, and arranged a marriage between Valdemar IV and his sister, Helvig of Schleswig. She was to bring the pawned province of Nørrejylland, one-quarter of the territory of Jutland, as a dowry. The wedding took place at Sønderborg Castle in 1340. Helvig was the daughter of Eric II, Duke of Schleswig and Adelaide of Holstein-Rendsburg. After the wedding, the couple traveled to Viborg to be officially greeted as king and queen of Denmark. With his wife Helvig, Valdemar IV had the following children:
#Christopher of Denmark, Duke of Lolland (1341–1363)
#Margaret of Denmark (1345–1350), betrothed to Henry III, Duke of Mecklenburg, died young.
#Ingeborg of Denmark (1347–1370), married Henry III, Duke of Mecklenburg, and was the maternal grandmother of King Eric VII of Denmark.
#Catherine of Denmark (1349), died young.
#Valdemar of Denmark (135011 June 1363), died young.
#Margaret I of Denmark (1353–1412), married King Haakon VI of Norway, and was Queen of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.

Evidence indicated also an illegitimate son, Erik Sjællandsfar, at Orebygård on Zealand, buried in Roskilde Cathedral with a crown. However, other evidence indicates that he was a son of King Eric VI of Denmark.

<text>Orthographic projection (also orthogonal projection and analemma) is a means of representing three-dimensional objects in two dimensions. Orthographic projection is a form of parallel projection in which all the projection lines are orthogonal to the projection plane, resulting in every plane of the scene appearing in affine transformation on the viewing surface. The obverse of an orthographic projection is an oblique projection, which is a parallel projection in which the projection lines are &quot;not&quot; orthogonal to the projection plane.

The term &quot;orthographic&quot; sometimes means a technique in multiview projection in which principal axes or the planes of the subject are also parallel with the projection plane to create the &quot;primary views&quot;. If the principal planes or axes of an object in an orthographic projection are &quot;not&quot; parallel with the projection plane, the depiction is called &quot;axonometric&quot; or an &quot;auxiliary views&quot;. (&quot;Axonometric projection&quot; is synonymous with &quot;parallel projection&quot;.) Sub-types of &quot;primary views&quot; include &quot;plans&quot;, &quot;elevations&quot;, and &quot;sections&quot;; sub-types of &quot;auxiliary views&quot; include &quot;isometric&quot;, &quot;dimetric&quot;, and &quot;trimetric projections&quot;. 

A lens that provides an orthographic projection is an object-space telecentric lens.

== Geometry ==


A simple orthographic projection onto the plane &quot;z&quot; = 0 can be defined by the following matrix:
:formula_1

For each point &quot;v&quot; = (&quot;v&quot;&quot;x&quot;, &quot;v&quot;&quot;y&quot;, &quot;v&quot;&quot;z&quot;), the transformed point &quot;Pv&quot; would be
:formula_2

Often, it is more useful to use homogeneous coordinates. The transformation above can be represented for homogeneous coordinates as 
:formula_3

For each homogeneous vector &quot;v&quot; = (&quot;v&quot;&quot;x&quot;, &quot;v&quot;&quot;y&quot;, &quot;v&quot;&quot;z&quot;, 1), the transformed vector &quot;Pv&quot; would be
:formula_4

In computer graphics, one of the most common matrices used for orthographic projection can be defined by a 6-tuple, (&quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;, &quot;top&quot;, &quot;near&quot;, &quot;far&quot;), which defines the clipping planes. These planes form a box with the minimum corner at (&quot;left&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;, -&quot;near&quot;) and the maximum corner at (&quot;right&quot;, &quot;top&quot;, -&quot;far&quot;).

The box is translated so that its center is at the origin, then it is scaled to the unit cube which is defined by having a minimum corner at (−1,−1,−1) and a maximum corner at (1,1,1).

The orthographic transform can be given by the following matrix:
:formula_5
which can be given as a scaling &quot;S&quot; followed by a translation &quot;T&quot; of the form
:formula_6

The inversion of the projection matrix &quot;P−1&quot;, which can be used as the unprojection matrix is defined:

formula_7

== Types ==
Three sub-types of orthographic projection are &quot;isometric projection&quot;, &quot;dimetric projection&quot;, and &quot;trimetric projection&quot;, depending on the exact angle at which the view deviates from the orthogonal. Typically in axonometric drawing, as in other types of pictorials, one axis of space is shown to be vertical.

In isometric projection, the most commonly used form of axonometric projection in engineering drawing, the direction of viewing is such that the three axes of space appear equally foreshortened, and there is a common angle of 120° between them. As the distortion caused by foreshortening is uniform, the proportionality between lengths is preserved, and the axes share a common scale; this eases one&#x27;s ability to take measurements directly from the drawing. Another advantage is that 120° angles are easily constructed using only a compass and straightedge.

In dimetric projection, the direction of viewing is such that two of the three axes of space appear equally foreshortened, of which the attendant scale and angles of presentation are determined according to the angle of viewing; the scale of the third direction is determined separately.

In trimetric projection, the direction of viewing is such that all of the three axes of space appear unequally foreshortened. The scale along each of the three axes and the angles among them are determined separately as dictated by the angle of viewing. Trimetric perspective is seldom used in technical drawings.

==Multiview projection==
In &quot;multiview projection&quot;, up to six pictures of an object are produced, called &quot;primary views&quot;, with each projection plane parallel to one of the coordinate axes of the object. The views are positioned relative to each other according to either of two schemes: &quot;first-angle&quot; or &quot;third-angle&quot; projection. In each, the appearances of views may be thought of as being &quot;projected&quot; onto planes that form a six-sided box around the object. Although six different sides can be drawn, usually three views of a drawing give enough information to make a three-dimensional object. These views are known as front view (also &quot;elevation&quot;), top view (also &quot;plan&quot;) and end view (also &quot;section&quot;). When the plane or axis of the object depicted is &quot;not&quot; parallel to the projection plane, and where multiple sides of an object are visible in the same image, it is called an &quot;auxiliary view&quot;. Thus &quot;isometric projection&quot;, &quot;dimetric projection&quot; and &quot;trimetric projection&quot; would be considered &quot;auxiliary views&quot; in multiview projection. A typical characteristic of multiview projection is that one axis of space is usually displayed as vertical.

== Cartography ==
An orthographic projection map is a map projection of cartography. Like the stereographic projection and gnomonic projection, orthographic projection is a perspective (or azimuthal) projection, in which the sphere is projected onto a tangent plane or secant plane. The &quot;point of perspective&quot; for the orthographic projection is at infinite distance. It depicts a hemisphere of the globe as it appears from outer space, where the horizon is a great circle. The shapes and areas are distorted, particularly near the edges.

The orthographic projection has been known since antiquity, with its cartographic uses being well documented. Hipparchus used the projection in the 2nd century BC to determine the places of star-rise and star-set. In about 14 BC, Roman engineer Marcus Vitruvius Pollio used the projection to construct sundials and to compute sun positions.

Vitruvius also seems to have devised the term orthographic – from the Greek &quot;orthos&quot; (&quot;straight&quot;) and &quot;graphē&quot; (&quot;drawing&quot;) – for the projection. However, the name &quot;analemma&quot;, which also meant a sundial showing latitude and longitude, was the common name until François d&#x27;Aguilon of Antwerp promoted its present name in 1613.

The earliest surviving maps on the projection appear as woodcut drawings of terrestrial globes of 1509 (anonymous), 1533 and 1551 (Johannes Schöner), and 1524 and 1551 (Apian).

<text>In mathematics and physical science, spherical harmonics are special functions defined on the surface of a sphere. They are often employed in solving partial differential equations in many scientific fields. The table of spherical harmonics contains a list of common spherical harmonics.

Since the spherical harmonics form a complete set of orthogonal functions and thus an orthonormal basis, every function defined on the surface of a sphere can be written as a sum of these spherical harmonics. This is similar to periodic functions defined on a circle that can be expressed as a sum of circular functions (sines and cosines) via Fourier series. Like the sines and cosines in Fourier series, the spherical harmonics may be organized by (spatial) angular frequency, as seen in the rows of functions in the illustration on the right. Further, spherical harmonics are basis functions for irreducible representations of SO(3), the group of rotations in three dimensions, and thus play a central role in the group theoretic discussion of SO(3).

Spherical harmonics originate from solving Laplace&#x27;s equation in the spherical domains. Functions that are solutions to Laplace&#x27;s equation are called harmonics. Despite their name, spherical harmonics take their simplest form in Cartesian coordinates, where they can be defined as homogeneous polynomials of degree formula_1 in formula_2 that obey Laplace&#x27;s equation. The connection with spherical coordinates arises immediately if one uses the homogeneity to extract a factor of radial dependence formula_3 from the above-mentioned polynomial of degree formula_1; the remaining factor can be regarded as a function of the spherical angular coordinates formula_5 and formula_6 only, or equivalently of the orientational unit vector formula_7 specified by these angles. In this setting, they may be viewed as the angular portion of a set of solutions to Laplace&#x27;s equation in three dimensions, and this viewpoint is often taken as an alternative definition. Notice, however, that spherical harmonics are &quot;not&quot; functions on the sphere which are harmonic with respect to the Laplace-Beltrami operator for the standard round metric on the sphere: the only harmonic functions in this sense on the sphere are the constants, since harmonic functions satisfy the Maximum principle. Spherical harmonics, as functions on the sphere, are eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (see Higher dimensions).

A specific set of spherical harmonics, denoted formula_8 or formula_9, are known as Laplace&#x27;s spherical harmonics, as they were first introduced by Pierre Simon de Laplace in 1782. These functions form an orthogonal system, and are thus basic to the expansion of a general function on the sphere as alluded to above.

Spherical harmonics are important in many theoretical and practical applications, including the representation of multipole electrostatic and electromagnetic fields, electron configurations, gravitational fields, geoids, the magnetic fields of planetary bodies and stars, and the cosmic microwave background radiation. In 3D computer graphics, spherical harmonics play a role in a wide variety of topics including indirect lighting (ambient occlusion, global illumination, precomputed radiance transfer, etc.) and modelling of 3D shapes.

==History==

Spherical harmonics were first investigated in connection with the Newtonian potential of Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation in three dimensions. In 1782, Pierre-Simon de Laplace had, in his &quot;Mécanique Céleste&quot;, determined that the gravitational potential formula_10 at a point associated with a set of point masses located at points was given by

formula_11

Each term in the above summation is an individual Newtonian potential for a point mass. Just prior to that time, Adrien-Marie Legendre had investigated the expansion of the Newtonian potential in powers of and . He discovered that if then

formula_12

where is the angle between the vectors and . The functions formula_13 are the Legendre polynomials, and they can be derived as a special case of spherical harmonics. Subsequently, in his 1782 memoir, Laplace investigated these coefficients using spherical coordinates to represent the angle between and . (See for more detail.)

In 1867, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and Peter Guthrie Tait introduced the solid spherical harmonics in their &quot;Treatise on Natural Philosophy&quot;, and also first introduced the name of &quot;spherical harmonics&quot; for these functions. The solid harmonics were homogeneous polynomial solutions formula_10 of Laplace&#x27;s equation
formula_15
By examining Laplace&#x27;s equation in spherical coordinates, Thomson and Tait recovered Laplace&#x27;s spherical harmonics. (See Harmonic polynomial representation.) The term &quot;Laplace&#x27;s coefficients&quot; was employed by William Whewell to describe the particular system of solutions introduced along these lines, whereas others reserved this designation for the zonal spherical harmonics that had properly been introduced by Laplace and Legendre.

The 19th century development of Fourier series made possible the solution of a wide variety of physical problems in rectangular domains, such as the solution of the heat equation and wave equation. This could be achieved by expansion of functions in series of trigonometric functions. Whereas the trigonometric functions in a Fourier series represent the fundamental modes of vibration in a string, the spherical harmonics represent the fundamental modes of vibration of a sphere in much the same way. Many aspects of the theory of Fourier series could be generalized by taking expansions in spherical harmonics rather than trigonometric functions. Moreover, analogous to how trigonometric functions can equivalently be written as complex exponentials, spherical harmonics also possessed an equivalent form as complex-valued functions. This was a boon for problems possessing spherical symmetry, such as those of celestial mechanics originally studied by Laplace and Legendre.

The prevalence of spherical harmonics already in physics set the stage for their later importance in the 20th century birth of quantum mechanics. The (complex-valued) spherical harmonics formula_16 are eigenfunctions of the square of the orbital angular momentum operator
formula_17
and therefore they represent the different quantized configurations of atomic orbitals.

==Laplace&#x27;s spherical harmonics==


Laplace&#x27;s equation imposes that the Laplacian of a scalar field is zero. (Here the scalar field is understood to be complex, i.e. to correspond to a (smooth) function formula_18.) In spherical coordinates this is:

formula_19

Consider the problem of finding solutions of the form . By separation of variables, two differential equations result by imposing Laplace&#x27;s equation:
formula_20
The second equation can be simplified under the assumption that has the form . Applying separation of variables again to the second equation gives way to the pair of differential equations

formula_21
formula_22

for some number . A priori, is a complex constant, but because must be a periodic function whose period evenly divides , is necessarily an integer and is a linear combination of the complex exponentials . The solution function is regular at the poles of the sphere, where . Imposing this regularity in the solution of the second equation at the boundary points of the domain is a Sturm–Liouville problem that forces the parameter to be of the form for some non-negative integer with ; this is also explained below in terms of the orbital angular momentum. Furthermore, a change of variables transforms this equation into the Legendre equation, whose solution is a multiple of the associated Legendre polynomial . Finally, the equation for has solutions of the form ; requiring the solution to be regular throughout forces .

Here the solution was assumed to have the special form . For a given value of , there are independent solutions of this form, one for each integer with . These angular solutions formula_23 are a product of trigonometric functions, here represented as a complex exponential, and associated Legendre polynomials:

formula_24

which fulfill
formula_25

Here formula_26 is called a spherical harmonic function of degree and order , formula_27 is an associated Legendre polynomial, is a normalization constant, and and represent colatitude and longitude, respectively. In particular, the colatitude , or polar angle, ranges from at the North Pole, to at the Equator, to at the South Pole, and the longitude , or azimuth, may assume all values with . For a fixed integer , every solution , formula_28, of the eigenvalue problem
formula_29
is a linear combination of formula_30. In fact, for any such solution, is the expression in spherical coordinates of a homogeneous polynomial formula_31 that is harmonic (see below), and so counting dimensions shows that there are linearly independent such polynomials.

The general solution formula_18 to Laplace&#x27;s equation formula_33 in a ball centered at the origin is a linear combination of the spherical harmonic functions multiplied by the appropriate scale factor ,

formula_34

where the formula_35 are constants and the factors are known as (&quot;regular&quot;) solid harmonics formula_31. Such an expansion is valid in the ball

formula_37

For formula_38, the solid harmonics with negative powers of formula_39 (the &quot;irregular&quot; solid harmonics formula_40) are chosen instead. In that case, one needs to expand the solution of known regions in Laurent series (about formula_41), instead of the Taylor series (about formula_42) used above, to match the terms and find series expansion coefficients formula_43.

===Orbital angular momentum===
In quantum mechanics, Laplace&#x27;s spherical harmonics are understood in terms of the orbital angular momentum
formula_44
The is conventional in quantum mechanics; it is convenient to work in units in which . The spherical harmonics are eigenfunctions of the square of the orbital angular momentum
formula_45
Laplace&#x27;s spherical harmonics are the joint eigenfunctions of the square of the orbital angular momentum and the generator of rotations about the azimuthal axis:
formula_46

These operators commute, and are densely defined self-adjoint operators on the weighted Hilbert space of functions &quot;f&quot; square-integrable with respect to the normal distribution as the weight function on R3:
formula_47
Furthermore, L2 is a positive operator.

If is a joint eigenfunction of and , then by definition
formula_48
for some real numbers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;λ&quot;. Here &quot;m&quot; must in fact be an integer, for &quot;Y&quot; must be periodic in the coordinate &quot;φ&quot; with period a number that evenly divides 2&quot;π&quot;. Furthermore, since
formula_49
and each of &quot;L&quot;&quot;x&quot;, &quot;L&quot;&quot;y&quot;, &quot;L&quot;&quot;z&quot; are self-adjoint, it follows that .

Denote this joint eigenspace by , and define the raising and lowering operators by
formula_50
Then and commute with , and the Lie algebra generated by , , is the special linear Lie algebra of order 2, formula_51, with commutation relations
formula_52
Thus (it is a &quot;raising operator&quot;) and (it is a &quot;lowering operator&quot;). In particular, must be zero for &quot;k&quot; sufficiently large, because the inequality must hold in each of the nontrivial joint eigenspaces. Let be a nonzero joint eigenfunction, and let be the least integer such that
formula_53
Then, since
formula_54
it follows that
formula_55
Thus for the positive integer .

The foregoing has been all worked out in the spherical coordinate representation, formula_56 but may be expressed more abstractly in the complete, orthonormal spherical ket basis.

==Harmonic polynomial representation==
The spherical harmonics can be expressed as the restriction to the unit sphere of certain polynomial functions formula_31. Specifically, we say that a (complex-valued) polynomial function formula_58 is &quot;homogeneous&quot; of degree formula_1 if
formula_60
for all real numbers formula_61 and all formula_62. We say that formula_63 is &quot;harmonic&quot; if
formula_64
where formula_65 is the Laplacian. Then for each formula_1, we define
formula_67

For example, when formula_68, formula_69 is just the 3-dimensional space of all linear functions formula_31, since any such function is automatically harmonic. Meanwhile, when formula_71, we have a 5-dimensional space:
formula_72

For any formula_1, the space formula_74 of spherical harmonics of degree formula_1 is just the space of restrictions to the sphere formula_76 of the elements of formula_77. As suggested in the introduction, this perspective is presumably the origin of the term “spherical harmonic” (i.e., the restriction to the sphere of a harmonic function).

For example, for any formula_78 the formula
formula_79
defines a homogeneous polynomial of degree formula_1 with domain and codomain formula_31, which happens to be independent of formula_82. This polynomial is easily seen to be harmonic. If we write formula_63 in spherical coordinates formula_84 and then restrict to formula_85, we obtain
formula_86
which can be rewritten as
formula_87
After using the formula for the associated Legendre polynomial formula_88, we may recognize this as the formula for the spherical harmonic formula_89 (See Special cases.)

==Conventions==

===Orthogonality and normalization===
Several different normalizations are in common use for the Laplace spherical harmonic functions formula_16. Throughout the section, we use the standard convention that for formula_91 (see associated Legendre polynomials)
formula_92
which is the natural normalization given by Rodrigues&#x27; formula.

In acoustics, the Laplace spherical harmonics are generally defined as (this is the convention used in this article)
formula_93
while in quantum mechanics:
formula_94

where formula_95 are associated Legendre polynomials without the Condon–Shortley phase (to avoid counting the phase twice).

In both definitions, the spherical harmonics are orthonormal
formula_96
where is the Kronecker delta and . This normalization is used in quantum mechanics because it ensures that probability is normalized, i.e.,
formula_97
The Condon–Shortley phase convention is used here for consistency. The corresponding inverse equations defining the complex spherical harmonics formula_23 in terms of the real spherical harmonics formula_99 are
formula_100

The real spherical harmonics formula_99 are sometimes known as &quot;tesseral spherical harmonics&quot;. These functions have the same orthonormality properties as the complex ones formula_23 above. The real spherical harmonics formula_103 with are said to be of cosine type, and those with of sine type. The reason for this can be seen by writing the functions in terms of the Legendre polynomials as
formula_104

The same sine and cosine factors can be also seen in the following subsection that deals with the Cartesian representation.

See here for a list of real spherical harmonics up to and including formula_105, which can be seen to be consistent with the output of the equations above.

==== Use in quantum chemistry ====
As is known from the analytic solutions for the hydrogen atom, the eigenfunctions of the angular part of the wave function are spherical harmonics. However, the solutions of the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation without magnetic terms can be made real. This is why the real forms are extensively used in basis functions for quantum chemistry, as the programs don&#x27;t then need to use complex algebra. Here, the real functions span the same space as the complex ones would.

For example, as can be seen from the table of spherical harmonics, the usual functions (formula_106) are complex and mix axis directions, but the real versions are essentially just , , and .

== Spherical harmonics in Cartesian form ==

The complex spherical harmonics formula_107 give rise to the solid harmonics by extending from formula_76 to all of formula_109 as a homogeneous function of degree formula_1, i.e. setting
formula_111
It turns out that formula_112 is basis of the space of harmonic and homogeneous polynomials of degree formula_1. More specifically, it is the (unique up to normalization) Gelfand-Tsetlin-basis of this representation of the rotational group formula_114 and an explicit formula for formula_112 in cartesian coordinates can be derived from that fact.

===The Herglotz generating function===

If the quantum mechanical convention is adopted for the formula_116, then
formula_117
Here, formula_7 is the vector with components formula_119, formula_120, and
formula_121
formula_122 is a vector with complex coordinates:

formula_123

The essential property of formula_124 is that it is null:
formula_125

It suffices to take formula_126 and formula_127 as real parameters.
In naming this generating function after Herglotz, we follow , who credit unpublished notes by him for its discovery.

Essentially all the properties of the spherical harmonics can be derived from this generating function. An immediate benefit of this definition is that if the vector formula_7 is replaced by the quantum mechanical spin vector operator formula_129, such that formula_130 is the operator analogue of the solid harmonic formula_131, one obtains a generating function for a standardized set of spherical tensor operators, formula_130:

formula_133

The parallelism of the two definitions ensures that the formula_134&#x27;s transform under rotations (see below) in the same way as the formula_135&#x27;s, which in turn guarantees that they are spherical tensor operators, formula_136, with formula_137 and formula_138, obeying all the properties of such operators, such as the Clebsch-Gordan composition theorem, and the Wigner-Eckart theorem. They are, moreover, a standardized set with a fixed scale or normalization.

===Separated Cartesian form===
The Herglotzian definition yields polynomials which may, if one wishes, be further factorized into a polynomial of formula_139 and another of formula_140 and formula_141, as follows (Condon–Shortley phase):
formula_142
and for :
formula_143
Here
formula_144
formula_145
and
formula_146
For formula_147 this reduces to
formula_148

The factor formula_149 is essentially the associated Legendre polynomial formula_150, and the factors formula_151 are essentially formula_152.

====Examples====

Using the expressions for formula_149, formula_154, and formula_155 listed explicitly above we obtain:
formula_156

formula_157
It may be verified that this agrees with the function listed here and here.

====Real forms====

Using the equations above to form the real spherical harmonics, it is seen that for formula_91 only the formula_159 terms (cosines) are included, and for formula_160 only the formula_161 terms (sines) are included:

formula_162
and for &quot;m&quot; = 0:
formula_163

==Special cases and values==
# When formula_147, the spherical harmonics formula_116 reduce to the ordinary Legendre polynomials: formula_166
# When formula_167, formula_168 or more simply in Cartesian coordinates, formula_169
# At the north pole, where formula_170, and formula_6 is undefined, all spherical harmonics except those with formula_147 vanish: formula_173

==Symmetry properties==
The spherical harmonics have deep and consequential properties under the operations of spatial inversion (parity) and rotation.

=== Parity ===

The spherical harmonics have definite parity. That is, they are either even or odd with respect to inversion about the origin. Inversion is represented by the operator formula_174. Then, as can be seen in many ways (perhaps most simply from the Herglotz generating function), with formula_7 being a unit vector,
formula_176

In terms of the spherical angles, parity transforms a point with coordinates formula_177 to formula_178. The statement of the parity of spherical harmonics is then
formula_179
(This can be seen as follows: The associated Legendre polynomials gives and from the exponential function we have , giving together for the spherical harmonics a parity of .)

Parity continues to hold for real spherical harmonics, and for spherical harmonics in higher dimensions: applying a point reflection to a spherical harmonic of degree changes the sign by a factor of .

===Rotations===

Consider a rotation formula_180 about the origin that sends the unit vector formula_7 to formula_182. Under this operation, a spherical harmonic of degree formula_1 and order formula_184 transforms into a linear combination of spherical harmonics of the same degree. That is,
formula_185
where formula_186 is a matrix of order formula_187 that depends on the rotation formula_180. However, this is not the standard way of expressing this property. In the standard way one writes,

formula_189
where formula_190 is the complex conjugate of an element of the Wigner D-matrix. In particular when formula_182 is a formula_192 rotation of the azimuth we get the identity,

formula_193

The rotational behavior of the spherical harmonics is perhaps their quintessential feature from the viewpoint of group theory. The formula_107&#x27;s of degree formula_1 provide a basis set of functions for the irreducible representation of the group SO(3) of dimension formula_187. Many facts about spherical harmonics (such as the addition theorem) that are proved laboriously using the methods of analysis acquire simpler proofs and deeper significance using the methods of symmetry.

==Spherical harmonics expansion==
The Laplace spherical harmonics formula_26 form a complete set of orthonormal functions and thus form an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions formula_198. On the unit sphere formula_76, any square-integrable function formula_200 can thus be expanded as a linear combination of these:

formula_201

This expansion holds in the sense of mean-square convergence — convergence in L2 of the sphere — which is to say that

formula_202

The expansion coefficients are the analogs of Fourier coefficients, and can be obtained by multiplying the above equation by the complex conjugate of a spherical harmonic, integrating over the solid angle Ω, and utilizing the above orthogonality relationships. This is justified rigorously by basic Hilbert space theory. For the case of orthonormalized harmonics, this gives:

formula_203

If the coefficients decay in &quot;ℓ&quot; sufficiently rapidly — for instance, exponentially — then the series also converges uniformly to &quot;f&quot;.

A square-integrable function formula_204 can also be expanded in terms of the real harmonics formula_99 above as a sum

formula_206

The convergence of the series holds again in the same sense, namely the real spherical harmonics formula_99 form a complete set of orthonormal functions and thus form an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions formula_208. The benefit of the expansion in terms of the real harmonic functions formula_103 is that for real functions formula_204 the expansion coefficients formula_211 are guaranteed to be real, whereas their coefficients formula_212 in their expansion in terms of the formula_135 (considering them as functions formula_214) do not have that property.

==Spectrum analysis==
===Power spectrum in signal processing===
The total power of a function &quot;f&quot; is defined in the signal processing literature as the integral of the function squared, divided by the area of its domain. Using the orthonormality properties of the real unit-power spherical harmonic functions, it is straightforward to verify that the total power of a function defined on the unit sphere is related to its spectral coefficients by a generalization of Parseval&#x27;s theorem (here, the theorem is stated for Schmidt semi-normalized harmonics, the relationship is slightly different for orthonormal harmonics):

formula_215
where
formula_216

is defined as the angular power spectrum (for Schmidt semi-normalized harmonics). In a similar manner, one can define the cross-power of two functions as
formula_217
where
formula_218

is defined as the cross-power spectrum. If the functions and have a zero mean (i.e., the spectral coefficients and are zero), then and represent the contributions to the function&#x27;s variance and covariance for degree , respectively. It is common that the (cross-)power spectrum is well approximated by a power law of the form

formula_219

When , the spectrum is &quot;white&quot; as each degree possesses equal power. When , the spectrum is termed &quot;red&quot; as there is more power at the low degrees with long wavelengths than higher degrees. Finally, when , the spectrum is termed &quot;blue&quot;. The condition on the order of growth of is related to the order of differentiability of in the next section.

===Differentiability properties===
One can also understand the differentiability properties of the original function in terms of the asymptotics of . In particular, if decays faster than any rational function of as , then is infinitely differentiable. If, furthermore, decays exponentially, then is actually real analytic on the sphere.

The general technique is to use the theory of Sobolev spaces. Statements relating the growth of the to differentiability are then similar to analogous results on the growth of the coefficients of Fourier series. Specifically, if
formula_220
then is in the Sobolev space . In particular, the Sobolev embedding theorem implies that is infinitely differentiable provided that
formula_221
for all .

==Algebraic properties==

=== Addition theorem ===
A mathematical result of considerable interest and use is called the &quot;addition theorem&quot; for spherical harmonics. Given two vectors and , with spherical coordinates formula_84 and formula_223, respectively, the angle formula_224 between them is given by the relation
formula_225
in which the role of the trigonometric functions appearing on the right-hand side is played by the spherical harmonics and that of the left-hand side is played by the Legendre polynomials.

The &quot;addition theorem&quot; states

where is the Legendre polynomial of degree . This expression is valid for both real and complex harmonics. The result can be proven analytically, using the properties of the Poisson kernel in the unit ball, or geometrically by applying a rotation to the vector y so that it points along the &quot;z&quot;-axis, and then directly calculating the right-hand side.

In particular, when , this gives Unsöld&#x27;s theorem
formula_226
which generalizes the identity to two dimensions.

In the expansion (), the left-hand side formula_227 is a constant multiple of the degree zonal spherical harmonic. From this perspective, one has the following generalization to higher dimensions. Let be an arbitrary orthonormal basis of the space of degree spherical harmonics on the -sphere. Then formula_228, the degree zonal harmonic corresponding to the unit vector , decomposes as
({\mathbf{y}}) = \sum_{j=1}^{\dim(\mathbf{H}_\ell)}\overline{Y_j({\mathbf{x}})}\,Y_j({\mathbf{y}})&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Furthermore, the zonal harmonic formula_229 is given as a constant multiple of the appropriate Gegenbauer polynomial:
({\mathbf{y}}) = C_\ell^{((n-2)/2)}({\mathbf{x}}\cdot {\mathbf{y}})&lt;/math&gt;|}}
Combining () and () gives () in dimension when and are represented in spherical coordinates. Finally, evaluating at gives the functional identity
formula_230
where is the volume of the (&quot;n&quot;−1)-sphere.

=== Contraction rule ===
Another useful identity expresses the product of two spherical harmonics as a sum over spherical harmonics
formula_231
Many of the terms in this sum are trivially zero. The values of formula_232 and formula_224 that result in non-zero terms in this sum are determined by the selection rules for the 3j-symbols.

=== Clebsch–Gordan coefficients ===

The Clebsch–Gordan coefficients are the coefficients appearing in the expansion of the product of two spherical harmonics in terms of spherical harmonics themselves. A variety of techniques are available for doing essentially the same calculation, including the Wigner 3-jm symbol, the Racah coefficients, and the Slater integrals. Abstractly, the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients express the tensor product of two irreducible representations of the rotation group as a sum of irreducible representations: suitably normalized, the coefficients are then the multiplicities.

==Visualization of the spherical harmonics==


The Laplace spherical harmonics formula_107 can be visualized by considering their &quot;nodal lines&quot;, that is, the set of points on the sphere where formula_235, or alternatively where formula_236. Nodal lines of formula_107 are composed of &quot;ℓ&quot; circles: there are circles along longitudes and &quot;ℓ&quot;−|&quot;m&quot;| circles along latitudes. One can determine the number of nodal lines of each type by counting the number of zeros of formula_107 in the formula_5 and formula_6 directions respectively. Considering formula_107 as a function of formula_5, the real and imaginary components of the associated Legendre polynomials each possess &quot;ℓ&quot;−|&quot;m&quot;| zeros, each giving rise to a nodal &#x27;line of latitude&#x27;. On the other hand, considering formula_107 as a function of formula_6, the trigonometric sin and cos functions possess 2|&quot;m&quot;| zeros, each of which gives rise to a nodal &#x27;line of longitude&#x27;.

When the spherical harmonic order &quot;m&quot; is zero (upper-left in the figure), the spherical harmonic functions do not depend upon longitude, and are referred to as zonal. Such spherical harmonics are a special case of zonal spherical functions. When (bottom-right in the figure), there are no zero crossings in latitude, and the functions are referred to as sectoral. For the other cases, the functions checker the sphere, and they are referred to as tesseral.

More general spherical harmonics of degree are not necessarily those of the Laplace basis formula_107, and their nodal sets can be of a fairly general kind.

==Higher dimensions==
The classical spherical harmonics are defined as complex-valued functions on the unit sphere formula_76 inside three-dimensional Euclidean space formula_109. Spherical harmonics can be generalized to higher-dimensional Euclidean space formula_252 as follows, leading to functions formula_253. Let P&quot;ℓ&quot; denote the space of complex-valued homogeneous polynomials of degree in real variables, here considered as functions formula_254. That is, a polynomial is in provided that for any real formula_61, one has

formula_256

Let A&quot;ℓ&quot; denote the subspace of P&quot;ℓ&quot; consisting of all harmonic polynomials:
formula_257
These are the (regular) solid spherical harmonics. Let H&quot;ℓ&quot; denote the space of functions on the unit sphere
formula_258
obtained by restriction from 
formula_259

The following properties hold:
* The sum of the spaces is dense in the set formula_260 of continuous functions on formula_261 with respect to the uniform topology, by the Stone–Weierstrass theorem. As a result, the sum of these spaces is also dense in the space of square-integrable functions on the sphere. Thus every square-integrable function on the sphere decomposes uniquely into a series of spherical harmonics, where the series converges in the sense.
* For all , one has formula_262 where is the Laplace–Beltrami operator on . This operator is the analog of the angular part of the Laplacian in three dimensions; to wit, the Laplacian in dimensions decomposes as formula_263
* It follows from the Stokes theorem and the preceding property that the spaces are orthogonal with respect to the inner product from . That is to say, formula_264 for and for .
* Conversely, the spaces are precisely the eigenspaces of . In particular, an application of the spectral theorem to the Riesz potential formula_265 gives another proof that the spaces are pairwise orthogonal and complete in .
* Every homogeneous polynomial can be uniquely written in the form formula_266 where . In particular, formula_267

An orthogonal basis of spherical harmonics in higher dimensions can be constructed inductively by the method of separation of variables, by solving the Sturm-Liouville problem for the spherical Laplacian
formula_268
where &quot;φ&quot; is the axial coordinate in a spherical coordinate system on &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1. The end result of such a procedure is
formula_269
where the indices satisfy and the eigenvalue is . The functions in the product are defined in terms of the Legendre function
formula_270

==Connection with representation theory==
The space of spherical harmonics of degree is a representation of the symmetry group of rotations around a point (SO(3)) and its double-cover SU(2). Indeed, rotations act on the two-dimensional sphere, and thus also on by function composition
formula_271
for a spherical harmonic and a rotation. The representation is an irreducible representation of SO(3).

The elements of arise as the restrictions to the sphere of elements of : harmonic polynomials homogeneous of degree on three-dimensional Euclidean space . By polarization of , there are coefficients formula_272 symmetric on the indices, uniquely determined by the requirement
formula_273
The condition that be harmonic is equivalent to the assertion that the tensor formula_272 must be trace free on every pair of indices. Thus as an irreducible representation of , is isomorphic to the space of traceless symmetric tensors of degree .

More generally, the analogous statements hold in higher dimensions: the space of spherical harmonics on the -sphere is the irreducible representation of corresponding to the traceless symmetric -tensors. However, whereas every irreducible tensor representation of and is of this kind, the special orthogonal groups in higher dimensions have additional irreducible representations that do not arise in this manner.

The special orthogonal groups have additional spin representations that are not tensor representations, and are &quot;typically&quot; not spherical harmonics. An exception are the spin representation of SO(3): strictly speaking these are representations of the double cover SU(2) of SO(3). In turn, SU(2) is identified with the group of unit quaternions, and so coincides with the 3-sphere. The spaces of spherical harmonics on the 3-sphere are certain spin representations of SO(3), with respect to the action by quaternionic multiplication.

==Connection with hemispherical harmonics==
Spherical harmonics can be separated into two set of functions. One is hemispherical functions (HSH), orthogonal and complete on hemisphere. Another is complementary hemispherical harmonics (CHSH).

===Generalizations===
The angle-preserving symmetries of the two-sphere are described by the group of Möbius transformations PSL(2,C). With respect to this group, the sphere is equivalent to the usual Riemann sphere. The group PSL(2,C) is isomorphic to the (proper) Lorentz group, and its action on the two-sphere agrees with the action of the Lorentz group on the celestial sphere in Minkowski space. The analog of the spherical harmonics for the Lorentz group is given by the hypergeometric series; furthermore, the spherical harmonics can be re-expressed in terms of the hypergeometric series, as is a subgroup of .

More generally, hypergeometric series can be generalized to describe the symmetries of any symmetric space; in particular, hypergeometric series can be developed for any Lie group.

<text>The margay (Leopardus wiedii) is a small wild cat native to Mexico, Central and South America. A solitary and nocturnal felid, it lives mainly in primary evergreen and deciduous forest.

Until the 1990s, margays were hunted for the wildlife trade, at which point the killing of the species was outlawed in most countries; however, years of persecution resulted in a notable population decrease. Since 2008, the margay has been listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, as the population is thought to be declining due to loss of habitat and deforestation.

The scientific name &quot;Felis wiedii&quot; was used by Heinrich Rudolf Schinz in 1821 in his first scientific description of the margay, named in honour of Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied, who collected specimens in Brazil.

==Characteristics==
The margay is very similar to the larger ocelot (&quot;Leopardus pardalis&quot;) in appearance, although the head is a little shorter, the eyes larger, and the tail and legs longer. It weighs from , with a body length of and a tail length of . Unlike most other cats, the female possesses only two teats.

Its fur is brown and marked with numerous rows of dark brown or black rosettes and longitudinal streaks. The undersides are paler, ranging from buff to white, and the tail has numerous dark bands and a black tip. The backs of the ears are black with circular white markings in the centre.

==Distribution and habitat==
The margay is distributed from the tropical lowlands in Mexico through Central America to Brazil and Paraguay. In Mexico it has been recorded in 24 of the 32 states, ranging northward up the coastal lowlands and Sierra Madres as far north as of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas on the US border in the east and southern Sonora in the west. The southern edge of its range reaches Uruguay and northern Argentina. It inhabits almost exclusively dense forests, ranging from tropical evergreen forest to tropical dry forest and high cloud forest. The margay has sometimes been observed in coffee and cocoa plantations.

The only record from the United States was collected sometime before 1852 near Eagle Pass, Maverick County, Texas, and it is currently considered locally extinct in Texas. The margay&#x27;s presence in the United States is considered &quot;uncertain&quot; by the IUCN Red List.

== Fossil record ==
Fossilized margay remains have been collected from Pleistocene deposits in Orange County, Texas along the Sabine River; like the ocelot and jaguar, it is thought to have ranged over considerable portions of southern Texas at the time. Margay fossils dating to 45,475–46,157 BP are known from the Toca da Barriguda cave in Bahia, Brazil. Pleistocene remains of the margay were also found in Florida.

Pleistocene fossils of margay-like cats, dubbed &quot;Leopardus amnicola&quot;, have been found in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, suggesting that they may have had an even wider distribution in prehistory.

==Behavior and ecology==

The margay is a skillful climber, and colloquially it is sometimes called the tree ocelot because of this ability. It spends most of the time in trees, leaping after and chasing birds and monkeys through the treetops. It can turn its ankles up to 180 degrees, so it can grasp branches equally well with its fore and hind paws, and it is able to jump up to horizontally. They also utilize their long tails to maintain balance while climbing. Morphological adaptation such as these is a strong indication that the margay is well equipped to thrive in ecosystems such as rainforests in which vegetation provides the wild with protection from possible threats. Additionally, scientists that have conducted behavioral studies on margays found that population density was higher in environments with substantial amount of trees and minimal human disturbance.

===Diet===
Dietary studies (based on stomach-content and fecal analyses) have shown that the margay feeds on small primates (such as marmosets, tamarins, squirrel and titi monkeys), numerous birds and lizards (and their eggs and young), small snakes, tree frogs and arthropods. It also hunts arboreal mammals, including Ingram&#x27;s squirrel, eats grass, as well as fruits and other vegetation, most likely to help digestion. It can live and hunt its prey entirely arboreally. However, margay will sometimes venture to the ground, and have been reported to hunt terrestrial prey, such agoutis, armadillos, cavies, and paca.

===Reproduction and lifecycle===
Female margays are in estrus for four to ten days over a cycle of 32 to 36 days, during which they attract males with a long, moaning call. The male responds by yelping or making trilling sounds, and also by rapidly shaking his head from side to side, a behavior not seen in any other cat species. Copulation lasts up to sixty seconds and is similar to that of domestic cats; it takes place primarily in the trees and occurs several times while the female is in heat. Unlike other felids, margays are not induced ovulators.

Gestation lasts about 80 days and generally results in the birth of a single kitten (very rarely, there are two), usually between March and June. Kittens weigh at birth. This is relatively large for a small cat and is probably related to the long gestation period. The kittens open their eyes at around two weeks of age and begin to eat solid food at seven to eight weeks. Margays reach sexual maturity at twelve to eighteen months of age and have been reported to live more than 20 years in captivity.

Cubs suffer from a 50% mortality rate. Unless mortality rates were previously lower, this is not a factor in the population decline. Simplifying, provided a pair of cats can raise 2 kittens to adulthood in their lifetime, population would be in equilibrium. Assuming one year to reach breeding age, then as long as the cats that survive infancy reach 5 years of age on average, then the pair would produce 4 kittens, of which 2 would survive infancy, thus providing a replacement pair. Coupled with the problems they have breeding in captivity, this makes the prospect of increasing the population very difficult.

It is usually solitary and lives in home ranges of . It uses scent marking to indicate its territory, including urine spraying and leaving scratch marks on the ground or on branches. Its vocalisations all appear to be short range; it does not call over long distances.

A margay has been observed to mimic the vocalisation of a pied tamarin (&quot;Saguinus bicolor&quot;) infant while hunting. This represents the first observation of a Neotropical predator employing this type of mimicry.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Felis wiedii&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Heinrich Rudolf Schinz in 1821 for a zoological specimen from Brazil. &quot;Felis macroura&quot; was proposed by Maximilian von Wied in 1825 who described margays that he obtained in the jungles along the Mucuri River in Brazil.
In the 20th century, several type specimens were described and proposed as new species or subspecies:

* &quot;Felis glaucula&quot; by Oldfield Thomas in 1903 was an adult female cat skin and skull from Jalisco in central Mexico.
* &quot;Felis wiedii vigens&quot; by Thomas in 1904 was an adult male cat skin and skull from Igarapé-Assu near Pará in Brazil.
* &quot;Felis pirrensis&quot; by Edward Alphonso Goldman in 1914 was an adult female cat skin and skull from Cana in eastern Panama.
* &quot;Margay glaucula nicaraguae&quot; by Joel Asaph Allen in 1919 was an adult male cat skin and skull from Volcan de Chinandego in Nicaragua.
* &quot;Felis glaucula oaxacensis&quot; and &quot;F. g. yucatanicus&quot; by Edward William Nelson and Goldman in 1931 were an adult male skin and skull from Cerro San Felipe in Oaxaca, and a female cat skin from Yucatan, Mexico, respectively.
* &quot;Felis wiedii cooperi&quot; by Nelson in 1943 was a skin of a male cat from Eagle Pass, Texas.

Results of a genetic study of margay mitochondrial DNA samples indicate that three phylogeographic groups exist. Therefore, three subspecies are currently considered valid taxa:

* &quot;L. w. wiedii&quot; south of the Amazonas
* &quot;L. w. vigens&quot; north of the Amazonas
* &quot;L. w. glauculus&quot; in Central America

==Local names==
In the Spanish language, it is known as , , , or . In Portuguese, it is called or simply . In the Guaraní language, the term originally referred only to the margay but is now also used for domestic cats.

<doc id="203071" wikidata="Q259110" url="?curid=203071" title="Herleva">
<text>Herleva () was an 11th-century Norman woman known for having been the mother of William the Conqueror, born to an extramarital relationship with Robert I, Duke of Normandy, and also of William&#x27;s prominent half-brothers Odo of Bayeux and Robert, Count of Mortain, born to Herleva&#x27;s marriage to Herluin de Conteville.

==Life==
Herleva&#x27;s background and the circumstances of William&#x27;s birth are shrouded in mystery. The written evidence dates from a generation or two later, and is not entirely consistent, but of all the Norman chroniclers only the Tours chronicler and William of Malmesbury, the latter thought to have simply copied the Tours source, assert that William&#x27;s parents were subsequently joined in marriage. According to Edward Augustus Freeman, the Tours chronicler&#x27;s version cannot be true, because if Herleva married the Duke, then William&#x27;s birth would have been legitimized, and thus he would not have been known as William the Bastard by his contemporaries.

The earliest source to refer to Herleva&#x27;s origin is the early-12th-century additions made by Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis to the &quot;Gesta Normannorum Ducum&quot;, where Herleva&#x27;s father is named as Fulbert, who would become the Duke&#x27;s Chamberlain (&quot;cubicularii ducis&quot;). Orderic reports the birth of William as occurring at Falaise, in Normandy, presumed to be Herleva&#x27;s native town, apparently during 1026/7.

In a separate addition to the &quot;Gesta&quot;, Orderic relates an anecdote that has given rise to Fulbert being characterized with more humble origins, as a tanner. During his siege of Alençon, the townspeople are said to have called William &quot;peliciarius&quot; (pelterer) because his mother&#x27;s kinsmen had been &quot;pollinctors&quot;. The latter is a rarely-used word, and two late-12th century poets, Wace and Benoît de Sainte-Maure, translate it differently, as &quot;parmentier&quot; (skinner/furrier/tanner) and &quot;peletier&quot; (tailor), respectively. An alternative suggested reading of &quot;pollinctors&quot; would see Fulbert as an embalmer, apothecary, or a person who laid out corpses for burial, the latter perhaps in turn an allusion to the court official who supervised that process, the chamberlain. Indirect evidence suggests that Herleva&#x27;s father was not a lowly tanner but, rather, a member of the burgher class. Her brothers appear in a later document as for an under-age William. Also, the Count of Flanders accepted Herleva as a proper guardian for his own daughter. Both of these would have been nearly impossible had Herleva&#x27;s father only been a mere tanner, which would place his social standing little above that of a peasant.

According to one legend, her relationship with Robert began when he saw Herleva from the roof of his castle tower. The walkway on the roof still looks down on the dyeing trenches cut into stone in the courtyard below, which can be seen to this day from the tower ramparts above. The traditional way of dyeing leather or garments was to trample barefoot on the garments which were awash in the liquid dye in these trenches. Herleva, legend goes, seeing the Duke on his ramparts above, raised her skirts perhaps a bit more than necessary in order to attract the Duke&#x27;s eye. The latter was immediately smitten and ordered her brought in (as was customary for any woman that caught the Duke&#x27;s eye) through the back door. Herleva refused, saying she would only enter the Duke&#x27;s castle on horseback through the front gate, and not as an ordinary commoner. The Duke, filled with lust, could only agree. In a few days, Herleva, dressed in the finest her father could provide, and sitting on a white horse, rode proudly through the front gate, her head held high. This gave Herleva a semi-official status as the Duke&#x27;s concubine. She later gave birth to his son, William, in 1027 or 1028.

===Marriage to Herluin de Conteville===

Herleva later married Herluin de Conteville in 1031. Some accounts maintain that Robert always loved her, but the gap in their social status made marriage impossible, so, to give her a good life, he married her off to one of his favourite noblemen.

From her marriage to Herluin she had two sons: Odo, who later became Bishop of Bayeux, and Robert, who became Count of Mortain. Both became prominent during William&#x27;s reign. They also had at least two daughters: Emma, who married Richard le Goz, Viscount of Avranches, and a daughter of unknown name who married William, lord of la Ferté-Macé.

== Death ==

According to Robert of Torigni, Herleva was buried at the abbey of Grestain, which was founded by Herluin and their son Robert around 1050. This would put Herleva in her forties around the time of her death.

<doc id="203076" wikidata="Q2463688" url="?curid=203076" title="Brian Bell">
<text>Brian Lane Bell (born December 9, 1968) is an American musician, singer, and songwriter. He is best known as the rhythm guitarist, keyboardist, backing vocalist, and occasional lead vocalist of the rock band Weezer, with whom he has recorded fifteen studio albums. Bell also fronted the rock band The Relationship and was the lead vocalist and guitarist of the indie rock band Space Twins.

Moving to Los Angeles at the age of eighteen, Bell played bass guitar in the band Carnival Art, releasing three studio albums with the band before departing in 1993. Bell subsequently joined Weezer as its rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist, at the request of band member Matt Sharp. Replacing founding member Jason Cropper, Bell joined the band during the recording of its debut album, &quot;Weezer&quot; (1994). Backed by the singles &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;, &quot;Undone – The Sweater Song&quot; and &quot;Say It Ain&#x27;t So&quot;, the album was a critical and commercial success.

==Early life==
Bell was born in Iowa City, Iowa to parents Tom Bell, a geography professor at University of Tennessee, and Linda Menasco, an elementary school assistant principal, and raised in Knoxville, Tennessee. He first took an interest in music at age four, when his parents took him to an Elvis Presley concert at the Stokely Athletic Centre in Knoxville. Soon after, Bell became obsessed with his father&#x27;s record collection, and played it constantly. Bell was forced by his mother to take piano lessons, and refused to let him take guitar lessons until high school, because she &quot;wouldn&#x27;t believe that he would practice.&quot; Eventually, during his freshman year in high school, Bell&#x27;s parents allowed him to take guitar lessons from Knoxville musician Ben Bolt. 

During his first year in high school, Bell had to switch schools; &quot;I was zoned to go to county school and my mom taught in the city, which meant I could go to a more privileged school. In doing that, I was surrounded by snobs&#x27;. &#x27;I was kind of finding myself at the time, so I decided to go to the school I was zoned for.&quot; During this time, Bell had a job delivering pizzas in the Knoxville area at Stefano&#x27;s Pizza. He worked with Jason Bales and Blair and Todd Mitchell (who he introduced to Queensryche&#x27;s music). He worked and started playing in a band with school friends, Tim and Glenn Maloof, named Blooshroom, which Bell described as &quot;Pink Floyd-meets-The Stooges.&quot;

After completing high school at Bearden High School in 1987, Bell decided against college, feeling it would be a &quot;waste of money.&quot; At the age of 18, Bell moved to Los Angeles, California, and enrolled at G.I.T. In 1991, he became a member of a band named Carnival Art, which released 3 official albums and an EP, with Bell playing bass guitar. The band had low record sales, and were dropped by their record label, Beggars Banquet. 

As Carnival Art was disintegrating, Bell became acquainted with the members of Weezer. He said: &quot;They started playing on the scene, and I instantly saw something unique in them. I didn&#x27;t necessarily want to be in their band. They were for some reason, in with the wrong crowd and playing at the wrong venues. I wanted to help them out any way I could and I wanted to play a show with them.&quot; In mid-1993, Bell quit Carnival Art. At home, he found on his answering machine a message from Weezer bassist Matt Sharp. Sharp called again the next day, and Rivers Cuomo took the phone and asked him to join the band.

==Weezer==

Despite being credited for guitar and vocals in the liner notes, Bell&#x27;s last-minute arrival at the &quot;Blue Album&quot; sessions meant that he only had time to re-record Cropper&#x27;s backing vocals, while Cuomo re-did all of Cropper&#x27;s guitar parts. Besides doing back-up vocals and playing rhythm guitar, during Weezer&#x27;s live performances, Bell takes on many of the multi-instrumental duties, including keyboards or harmonica.

Although all songwriting credits on Weezer&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Make Believe&quot; are credited to Rivers Cuomo, Bell wrote the intro to &quot;We Are All on Drugs&quot; and the dueling guitars in the solo of &quot;This is Such a Pity.&quot; Bell also contributed the song &quot;Thought I Knew&quot; to the band&#x27;s 2008 self-titled album as well as &quot;It&#x27;s Easy,&quot; an iTunes exclusive demo that serves as a bonus track to that album. This marks the first time Weezer has officially released a song written and sung by Bell, although the band demoed and played his song &quot;Yellow Camaro&quot; live in 2002. The song eventually made it onto the Space Twins debut LP &quot;The End of Imagining&quot;.

In 2005, during live appearances, Bell sang lead vocals on &quot;Why Bother?&quot;, &quot;Smile&quot;, &quot;Getchoo&quot; and &quot;Keep Fishin&#x27;&quot;. In 2008 during the band&#x27;s Hootenanny Tour he began taking lead vocals on &quot;El Scorcho&quot;. He continued singing &quot;El Scorcho&quot; and sang &quot;Suzanne&quot; as well on the band&#x27;s Troublemaker Tour in 2008.

==Space Twins==
Throughout the years Bell fronted his own band, Space Twins, who have had various incarnations since 1993. They have released three EPs and an LP, &quot;The End of Imagining&quot;, in 2003. Yet in 2006, Bell stated that he was &quot;not presently pursuing&quot; projects with The Space Twins.

==The Relationship==
In 2007 Bell recorded for a side project called The Relationship. The recording took place at Henson Recording Studios and Padre Terrace in Los Angeles and is produced by Weezer engineer Eric J. Sean Lennon mentioned in an interview that he will appear with Bell on The Relationship&#x27;s debut record. Rivers Cuomo and Bell co-wrote a song together for the project titled &quot;Hand to Hold,&quot; but Bell does not think it will be on their debut album. In May 2007 he uploaded &quot;Hand to Hold&quot; on the band&#x27;s Myspace page. It is a reworking of the Weezer song &quot;Private Message,&quot; which was originally in the running for inclusion on &quot;Make Believe&quot;. In March 2017, Bell announced that the band&#x27;s newest album, &quot;Clara Obscura&quot; (meaning &quot;Clear&quot; and &quot;Obscure&quot;)&quot;,&quot; would be released on April 18.

==Other projects==
Bell and Weezer drummer Patrick Wilson collaborated on a cover of the Velvet Underground song &quot;Heroin&quot;, for the 2006 film &quot;Factory Girl&quot;.

In November 2006, Lyon Guitars (by Washburn) introduced a limited edition guitar series called &quot;Limited Edition 2006,&quot; each of which had been hand-signed by Bell, and were in the same &quot;strat&quot; body style that he prefers to play.

Bell has also expressed an interest in the works of William Shakespeare. During the band&#x27;s downtime in 2003 and 2004, Bell and his ex-girlfriend Peggy Nunez studied Shakespeare and poetry theory at the collegiate level. They also appeared in a production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, in which Bell wrote four songs, all using Shakespeare&#x27;s words.

Bell has appeared in one-off performances on guitar with other bands. Playing on March 17, 2006 at The Troubador in LA with Weezer tour-mates Ringside, and performing &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot;, with the Go-Go&#x27;s member, Jane Wiedlin, on June 1, 2006 at the Viper Room. He sat in on guitars and back up vocals for Ringside&#x27;s winter &#x27;06 tour in Russia.

It was announced that Bell will make his producing debut on the Ultra Sonic Edukators next album.

==Equipment==
As of 2014, Bell solely uses Gibson Guitars, his current main instrument being a 2001 Gibson Explorer in limited edition diamond sparkle finish, which he found in Rivers Cuomo&#x27;s basement, with a chrome mirror pickguard. His main amplifier is a Matchless Independence, a three channel, hand-wired tube amplifier, providing the thick distortion that Weezer is known for.

==Movie career==

In 2006, Bell made his on-screen debut, playing Lou Reed in the Edie Sedgwick biographical film, &quot;Factory Girl.&quot; Bandmate Patrick Wilson also appeared as John Cale, another member of the Velvet Underground.

Bell voiced a band member on a &#x27;booze-cruise&quot; and was animated as himself in the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Hateful Eight-Year-Olds&quot;, along with the rest of Weezer.

<text>The Wireless Set Number 11, or WS No. 11, was a radio set designed for the British Army in 1938. It was designed to replace the 1933 Wireless Set No. 1 which had been found inadequate for a number of reasons. Like the No. 1, it was designed to be used in fixed locations like regimental field headquarters, as well as in vehicles and tanks.

Some No. 11s were produced between 1938 and 1940 before they, too, were considered inadequate. A smaller production run in Canada was also completed by Canadian Marconi and used both by Canadian and British forces. The No. 11 was replaced in tanks by the significantly more capable Wireless Set No. 19, while the No. 11 went on to be used by many others, notably the Long Range Desert Group.

==History==
The No. 11 set, a radio transceiver featuring a single tuning unit, was designed in 1938 to replace the 1933 Wireless Set No. 1. Originally designed to be used in tanks for short- and medium-range communications, it was later used by the Long Range Desert Group in Libya and Tunisia for long-range communications while deep behind enemy lines. The Germans reportedly captured several sets in France and put them to use for their own communication needs. The set was also manufactured in Australia by AWA with different valves and alterations to its circuitry.

==Specifications==
*Power: Batteries or 6 V or 12 V mains supply 
*RF output: 0.6 W to 4.5 W 
*Communication range: Approximately using or aerials. 
*Dimensions: 
*Weight: ; complete low and high power stations weigh and .
*Control: Direct or remote, enabling operation at and a remote aerial at up to 
* Frequency range: 4.5 to 7.1 MHz

<doc id="203079" wikidata="Q343069" url="?curid=203079" title="Rivers Cuomo">
<text>Rivers Cuomo ( ; born June 13, 1970) is an American musician best known as the lead vocalist, guitarist, and songwriter of the rock band Weezer. Cuomo was born in New York City and raised in several Buddhist communities in the northeastern U.S. until the age of 10 when his family settled in Connecticut. He played in several bands in Connecticut and California before forming Weezer in 1992.

After the success of Weezer&#x27;s debut, the &quot;Blue Album&quot; (1994)&quot;,&quot; Cuomo enrolled at Harvard University, but dropped out after recording Weezer&#x27;s second album, &quot;Pinkerton&quot; (1996). He later re-enrolled and graduated in 2006. Though &quot;Pinkerton&quot; is now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s and has been certified platinum, it was initially a commercial and critical failure, pushing Cuomo&#x27;s songwriting toward pop music for Weezer&#x27;s next album, the &quot;Green Album&quot; (2001). Weezer has released more than a dozen albums since.

Cuomo has released several compilations of demos, including &quot;&quot; (2007) and &quot;Alone II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo&quot; (2008), and has released thousands of home recordings on his website. He has collaborated with artists including Hayley Williams, B.O.B., AJR, Todd Rundgren and Panic! at the Disco. With the American songwriter Scott Murphy, Cuomo has released two Japanese-language albums under the name Scott &amp; Rivers.

== Early life ==
Rivers Cuomo was born on June 13, 1970, in New York City to Frank Cuomo, of Italian descent, and Beverly Shoenberger, of German-English descent. Frank was a musician who played drums on Wayne Shorter&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Odyssey of Iska&quot;. According to one account, Cuomo&#x27;s mother named him Rivers either because he was born between the East and Hudson rivers in Manhattan or because she could hear a river outside her hospital window. But his father has said Rivers was named after three prominent soccer players: Rivellino, Gigi Riva, and Gianni Rivera, all of whom were playing in the 1970 World Cup in Mexico.

Cuomo was raised in Rochester, New York, at the Rochester Zen Center, until his father left the family in 1975. His mother relocated the family to Yogaville, an ashram in Pomfret, Connecticut. Cuomo attended the Pomfret Community School, and his mother married Stephen Kitts. In 1980, Yogaville relocated to Virginia. The Kitts family opted to stay in Connecticut and moved to the Storrs/Mansfield area. During this time, Cuomo attended Mansfield Middle School and E.O. Smith High School. He was a member of the high school choir and performed in a school production of &quot;Grease&quot; as Johnny Casino. While in high school, Cuomo attended a summer program at the Berklee College of Music. He also changed his name to Peter Kitts; after graduating, Cuomo reverted to his original name.

One of Cuomo&#x27;s earliest music projects was the glam metal band Avant Garde. In 1989, after playing several shows in Connecticut, Avant Garde moved to Los Angeles and changed its name to Zoom. It broke up in 1990. During this time, Cuomo attended Santa Monica College. In 1990 and 1991, while Cuomo was writing material for what became Weezer&#x27;s debut album, he was a roadie for the band Kingsize. He also worked at Tower Records on Sunset Boulevard, where he met the drummer Patrick Wilson. Cuomo began to move away from metal and absorbed alternative influences such as Nirvana, the Pixies and Sonic Youth. He also dived deep into The Beach Boys and The Beatles which would influence his songwriting. He did not want audiences to realize he had once been a metal musician, as &quot;there was so much anxiety about authenticity at the time&quot;. He also began to think of himself as a singer for the first time.

== Weezer ==
Cuomo formed Weezer in 1992 with Wilson, the bassist Matt Sharp and the guitarist Jason Cropper. &quot;Weezer&quot; was the nickname Cuomo&#x27;s father gave him when he was a toddler. On June 25, 1993, Weezer signed with DGC, a subsidiary of Geffen Records. They released their self-titled debut album, commonly known as the &quot;Blue Album&quot;, in May 1994. Cropper was fired during the recording and replaced by Brian Bell.

The &quot;Blue Album&quot; was certified platinum on January 1, 1995, with sales of over one million. Cuomo tired of the monotony and loneliness of touring and developed a &quot;huge inferiority complex&quot; about rock music, saying: &quot;I thought my songs were really simplistic and silly, and I wanted to write complex, intense, beautiful music.&quot;
In March 1995, Cuomo had extensive surgery to extend his left leg, which was shorter than the right. This involved the surgical breaking of the leg bone, followed by months of wearing a steel brace and painful physical therapy. The procedure affected his songwriting, as he spent long periods hospitalized under the influence of painkillers.

In late 1995, Cuomo enrolled at Harvard University to study classical composition. He told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;The only time I could write songs was when my frozen dinner was in the microwave. The rest of the time I was doing homework.&quot; He auditioned for the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum chorus, but was not selected. He became introverted and grew a beard, mentioning in a letter to the Weezer fan club that students wearing Weezer T-shirts did not recognize him.

Cuomo had planned Weezer&#x27;s second album to be a rock opera, &quot;Songs from the Black Hole&quot;, but he abandoned the project as his songwriting became &quot;darker, more visceral and exposed, less playful&quot;. Realizing he did not enjoy contemporary classical music, and missing Weezer, Cuomo dropped out of Harvard two semesters before graduation. He expressed the isolation and sexual frustration he had felt at Harvard on Weezer&#x27;s second album, &quot;Pinkerton&quot;, released in September 1996. With a darker, more abrasive sound than Weezer&#x27;s debut, &quot;Pinkerton&quot; was a commercial and critical failure, but attained critical acclaim later.

After &quot;Pinkerton&quot;, Weezer went on a three-year hiatus. Cuomo enrolled at Harvard twice more and completed semesters in 1997 and 2004. During the 1997 semester, he played with a new band, Homie, in Boston. In February 1998, Cuomo disbanded Homie and moved to Los Angeles to work on new Weezer demos with Bell and Wilson, but the sessions were unproductive. In 1998 and 1999, he lived in an apartment under a freeway in Culver City, California. In an essay for Harvard, he wrote: &quot;I became more and more isolated. I unplugged my phone. I painted the walls and ceiling of my bedroom black and covered the windows with fiberglass insulation.&quot;

Disappointed by &quot;Pinkerton&quot;&#x27;s reception, Cuomo intended to return to simpler songwriting with less personal lyrics. He said that Weezer&#x27;s subsequent albums, the &quot;Green Album&quot; (2001) and &quot;Maladroit&quot; (2002), were &quot;very intentionally not about me. Not about what was going on in my life, at least in a conscious way.&quot; He also developed a greater appreciation for pop music, feeling that its multiple disciplines—including lyrics, improvisation, and image—produce a multifaceted art &quot;that moves people and is important, and relevant to our culture in a way that serious classical music isn&#x27;t right now&quot;. 

In June 2006, Cuomo graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in English from Harvard and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. On December 6, 2009, Cuomo suffered cracked ribs and internal bleeding when his tour bus hit an icy road in Glen, New York, and crashed. Weezer canceled their performances until 2010.

==Other projects==

During Weezer&#x27;s hiatus after &quot;Pinkerton&quot;, Cuomo formed Homie, and performed what he called &quot;goofball songs&quot; for his &quot;country band&quot;. An album was planned, but only one studio recording, the song &quot;American Girls&quot;, was released. Cuomo has contributed to recordings by various other musicians (Crazy Town, Cold, Mark Ronson). He managed the band AM Radio in 2002 and 2003; he and the band&#x27;s frontman, Kevin Ridel, went to school together.

In early 2004, Cuomo joined ex-Weezer bassist Matt Sharp onstage at California State University, Fullerton. They worked on a record together in February that year, but the material remains unreleased. In March 2008, Cuomo began a YouTube video series in which he wrote a song in collaboration with YouTube viewers. The finished song, &quot;Turning Up the Radio&quot;, was released in 2010 on the Weezer compilation album &quot;Death to False Metal&quot;.
In December 2007, Cuomo released &quot;&quot;, a compilation of his demos recorded from 1992 to 2007. It was followed by &quot;Alone II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo&quot; in November 2008. In November 2010, Cuomo released &quot;Alone III: The Pinkerton Years&quot;. It was sold exclusively with a book, &quot;The Pinkerton Diaries&quot;, collecting Cuomo&#x27;s writings from the &quot;Pinkerton&quot; period. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; awarded &quot;Alone III&quot; 7.3 out of 10, writing: &quot;&quot;Alone III&quot; casts the creative up-ramp to &quot;Pinkerton&quot; as an inspired if not always productive time for Cuomo—you can practically visualize his brain giddily whirring with a flood of new ideas and classicist ambitions ... If you value these archaeological digs as an opportunity to construct an alternate band history, &quot;Alone III&quot; is easily Cuomo&#x27;s most worthwhile project since, well, &quot;Pinkerton&quot;.&quot;

Cuomo has made cameos in music videos including the Crystal Method&#x27;s &quot;Murder&quot; and the Warlocks&#x27; &quot;Cocaine Blues&quot;. He also makes a guest appearance on Sugar Ray&#x27;s &quot;Boardwalk&quot;, the first single on the group&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Music for Cougars&quot;. Cuomo featured on the song &quot;Magic&quot;, on B.o.B&#x27;s debut album &quot;B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray&quot;, released in April 2010. In a May interview with HitQuarters, producer-songwriter Lucas Secon confirmed that he had recently worked with Cuomo on both a Steve Aoki single and &quot;some Weezer stuff&quot;.

In 2011, Cuomo collaborated with Japanese singer Hitomi for her first independent album &quot;Spirit&quot;, in the duet &quot;Rollin&#x27; with da Homies&quot;, which he co-wrote. He was also featured on the Simple Plan song &quot;Can&#x27;t Keep My Hands Off You&quot; and Miranda Cosgrove&#x27;s song &quot;High Maintenance&quot;. In 2013, Cuomo released a self-titled Japanese-language album with Scott Murphy under the name Scott &amp; Rivers. The album debuted at #1 on the iTunes Japan alternative charts. It was physically released in Japan and digitally worldwide on iTunes. In 2015, Cuomo appeared on Big Data&#x27;s song &quot;Snowed In&quot;, from its album &quot;2.0&quot;. In the same year, he produced a pilot for a sitcom based on his life, &quot;DeTour&quot;, starring Ben Aldridge as Cuomo. The pilot was not picked up. In 2016, he wrote the song &quot;She Makes Me Laugh&quot; for the Monkees&#x27; twelfth studio album, &quot;Good Times!&quot;.

In 2017, Cuomo featured in RAC&#x27;s &quot;I Still Wanna Know&quot;, as well as Vic Mensa&#x27;s &quot;Homewrecker&quot;, which sampled Weezer&#x27;s &quot;The Good Life&quot;. The same year, he co-wrote and appeared on AJR&#x27;s &quot;Sober Up&quot;. &quot;Sober Up&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Charts, becoming Cuomo&#x27;s first song as a solo artist to reach number one on Billboard&#x27;s Alternative chart. Cuomo also co-wrote the song &quot;Why Won&#x27;t You Love Me&quot; on 5 Seconds of Summer&#x27;s 2018 album &quot;Youngblood&quot;. In 2018, he helped write two songs, &quot;Clock Work&quot; and &quot;Dancing Girl&quot;, for Asian Kung-Fu Generation&#x27;s 2018 album &quot;Hometown&quot;. Cuomo also performed a live cover of Toto&#x27;s &quot;Africa&quot; during the homecoming halftime show at Santa Monica College. Also in 2018, Cuomo released a single called &quot;Medicine for Melancholy&quot;, produced by AJR. In 2019, he wrote and performed &quot;Backflip&quot;, the theme song for the Netflix series &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot;. In 2020, Cuomo released more than 2,000 demos and home recordings on his website.

In November 2022, Cuomo released the Indonesian-language song &quot;Anak Sekolah&quot;, originally by Indonesian singer Chrisye. Cuomo later performed the song live with Weezer during its headline appearance at SoundrenAline 2022 in Jakarta. According to CNN Indonesia, the idea to cover the song had come from Cuomo&#x27;s Discord server, after he had asked fans about Indonesian-language songs he could perform for Weezer&#x27;s Indonesia show.

== Artistry ==

Appearing on the &quot;Song Exploder&quot; podcast in 2016, Cuomo explained the process he used to write albums such as the &quot;White Album&quot;. He sometimes uses the piano to write vocal melodies he would not create through singing, and vocally improvises melodies for guitar solos, to avoid guitar habits and create solos &quot;you can sing along to&quot; with &quot;space in [them] because I have to breathe&quot;. He maintains Spotify playlists of music with chord progressions for inspiration. 

Cuomo has a tenor vocal range. Cuomo&#x27;s process of writing lyrics involves writing stream-of-consciousness thoughts in his journal, highlighting interesting lines, and adding them to a spreadsheet organized by the number of syllables they contain and strong-weak emphasis. He finds lines that fit the melody and assembles them in a way that suggests a story. Cuomo&#x27;s lyrics rarely use profanity; according to Cuomo, &quot;Weezer came up at a time when Jane&#x27;s Addiction released &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot;; everyone was trying to be controversial. We looked back to rock and roll&#x27;s pre-drug days—to the clean images of the Beach Boys that felt, ironically, rebellious.&quot; Cuomo has experimented with various means of &quot;concentration&quot; to aid his songwriting, such as fasting.

=== Influences ===
Cuomo credited the Beach Boys as a major influence on his early songwriting. He told &quot;Upset&quot;: &quot;I remember when I was 21 or 22, right when Weezer got together. I went to the local used record shop in Santa Monica with the intention of buying a classic album that was going to be a huge influence on me and my writing for Weezer. I flipped through all the records and I narrowed it down to two records. One of them was &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot;, the other was &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; by the Beach Boys. It was almost a coin toss but I ended up going with &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, and I really came to love the melodies and the chord progression and the emotion on that record. It has to be one of the biggest influences right when Weezer was starting out.&quot;

Prior to the formation of Weezer, Cuomo was interested in heavy metal and &quot;hook-heavy punk-pop&quot;. On tour with the band after the &quot;Blue Album&quot;, Cuomo listened extensively to the operas &quot;Aida&quot; (1871) and &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; (1904), the rock opera &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (1970), and the musical &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1980), which influenced the composition of &quot;Pinkerton&quot; and the unreleased &quot;Songs from the Black Hole.&quot;

Cuomo&#x27;s other influences include the Beatles, Kiss, Nirvana, Giacomo Puccini, Green Day, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Judas Priest, Cat Stevens, Lou Barlow, the Who, Pixies, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Elliott Smith, Mike Smith, and Sonic Youth. Many are referenced in Weezer&#x27;s 2008 song &quot;Heart Songs&quot;. In the late 1990s, Cuomo created an &quot;Encyclopedia of Pop&quot; for himself, a three-ring binder in which he examined pop and rock songs by artists including Nirvana, Green Day, and Oasis.

==Equipment==

Cuomo recorded the &quot;Blue Album&quot; with a Gibson Les Paul Special, a Gibson Les Paul Junior, and a Fender Jaguar borrowed from producer Ric Ocasek. His amp was a vintage Mesa/Boogie Mark I. For touring, he initially used a sonic blue Warmoth Fender Stratocaster copy with Seymour Duncan and DiMarzio pickups alongside Marshall amps, but the guitar was split down the middle onstage in 1997 and eventually retired in 2000. In recent years, he has used additional Warmoth Strat copies (in blue, seafoam green, black and blonde), as well as a Gibson SG painted white with a Seymour Duncan bridge pickup. During the Hella Mega Tour in 2021, Cuomo was seen playing a Jackson Rhoads (he had recently used Randy Rhoads&#x27;s solo on &quot;Crazy Train&quot;). The guitars are plugged into a Kemper Profiler amp.

==Personal life==
Cuomo took a vow of sexual abstinence from 2003 until his marriage in 2006, and considered his celibacy a positive influence on Weezer&#x27;s &quot;Make Believe&quot; (2005). On June 18, 2006, Cuomo married Kyoko Ito, whom he met in 1997 at one of his solo concerts at the Middle East club in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He proposed to her in Tokyo in 2005. The wedding was on a beach on Paradise Cove in Malibu, and all of Weezer&#x27;s past and present members except Mikey Welsh attended, as did Cuomo&#x27;s old bandmate Kevin Ridel and &quot;Make Believe&quot; producer Rick Rubin.

Cuomo was born with equally long legs, but as he grew, his right leg grew nearly two inches longer than his left. After the &quot;Blue Album&quot; success, he underwent the Ilizarov procedure to correct the condition. This involved surgical breaking of the bone in his leg, followed by several months of wearing a steel brace that required self-administered &quot;stretching&quot; of the leg four times daily. Cuomo likened the ordeal to &quot;crucifying his leg&quot;.

Cuomo has been vegetarian since childhood, but in 2002, he told an interviewer that he might like to start eating meat regularly and said he had done so in the past, eating &quot;some kind of barbecued beef in Tokyo&quot;.

Cuomo practices Vipassanā meditation and was a student of S. N. Goenka. As of 2009, he also teaches children&#x27;s meditation as taught by Goenka. Cuomo helped acquire music rights and provided financial support for the 2007 documentary &quot;The Dhamma Brothers&quot;, about Vipassanā meditation being instituted in an Alabama state prison.

Cuomo was a fan of soccer at an early age. He wrote the 2006 song &quot;My Day Is Coming&quot; in tribute to the U.S. men&#x27;s soccer team, and in 2010, wrote &quot;Represent&quot;, an &quot;unofficial anthem&quot; for the U.S. team, which was released as a Weezer single on June 11, the day before Team USA&#x27;s World Cup opener against England. In early 2008, Cuomo played in the Mia and Nomar Celebrity Soccer Challenge and scored a goal in the game. The video for &quot;Lover in the Snow&quot;, from the &quot;Alone&quot; album, deals with this game and his childhood love of soccer. In August 2009, Cuomo participated in the Athletes for Africa 5v5 Charity Soccer Tournament in Toronto, alongside actor Michael Cera.

Cuomo performed at a campaign rally for Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang in Iowa on November 1, 2019, though he did not explicitly endorse Yang.

Cuomo&#x27;s hobbies include computer programming. He took the CS50 course and maintains a GitHub profile and a Discord server.

<text>Kuehneodon is a genus of extinct mammal of the Upper Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous of Europe. It was a relatively early member of the also extinct order of Multituberculata. Members of this genus lived alongside such dinosaurs as Allosaurus. It belongs to the suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot;, family Paulchoffatiidae. In addition, this genus is the only known member of a subfamily called Kuehneodontinae. It was named by Hahn G. in 1969, the name meaning &quot;Kühne’s tooth&quot; in honor of paleontologist Walther Kühne, pioneer of the Guimarota site of Portugal where remains were found in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

&quot;Kuehneodon&quot; is the one genus of the taxon Paulchoffatiidae from the Guimarota site whereby the lower and upper jaws have been found united. These &quot;exhibit the lowest number of derived characters (apomorphies), and are thus closest to the main evolutionary lineage of the multituberculates&quot; (Hahn &amp; Hahn 2000, p. 106).

The genus is based mainly upon remains of jaw, a number of species are recorded from Guimarota: &quot;Kuehneodon dietrichi&quot; Hahn G, 1969; &quot;K. dryas&quot; Hahn G, 1977; &quot;K. guimarotensis&quot; Hahn G, 1969; &quot;K. simpsoni&quot; Hahn, 1969 and &quot;K. uniradiculatus&quot; Hahn, 1978. A further Upper Jurassic, Portuguese locality near Lourinhã, Porto das Barcas, has yielded &quot;K. barcasensis&quot; Hahn G &amp; Hahn R, 2001. Lower Cretaceous fossils have also been found in Galve, Spain.
K. hahni Antunes, 1998 was reported from Paimogo, Lourinhã, by Miguel Telles Antunes.

<text>Michael Edward Welsh (April 20, 1971 – October 8, 2011) was an American artist and musician who played bass for several bands, including the rock band Weezer. During Weezer&#x27;s hiatus, he played with Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo in the band Homie, during Cuomo&#x27;s time in Boston. Following original bassist Matt Sharp&#x27;s departure from Weezer, Welsh joined as bassist and played with them from the time that they unofficially regrouped in 1998 until August 2001, when he experienced mental health problems. Shortly afterwards, he retired from music to focus on his art career. Welsh died from a drug overdose on October 8, 2011.

==Career==
Welsh was born on April 20, 1971, in Syracuse, New York. He began his career as a Boston-area musician, playing in bands such as Heretix, Chevy Heston, Jocobono, Left Nut, and Slower. He was a touring bassist for Juliana Hatfield and Verbena. In 1997, he joined the first incarnation of the Rivers Cuomo Band, the side-project of Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo. He joined Weezer following the departure of Matt Sharp in 1998.

During Weezer&#x27;s hiatus, he played with Verbena and the first incarnation of Patrick Wilson&#x27;s band the Special Goodness. He wrote a large number of basslines in this period, recorded them and sent them to Rivers Cuomo for writing inspiration, although Cuomo never used any of them. Instead, he contributed four of these to Juliana Hatfield&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Juliana&#x27;s Pony: Total System Failure&quot;. Welsh was given a co-writing credit for four songs.

He toured with Weezer beginning with their resurgence in the summer of 2000 and first appeared on their limited edition &quot;Christmas CD&quot; EP later that year (re-released in 2005 as &quot;Winter Weezerland&quot;). He subsequently played on 2001&#x27;s Green Album as well as a number of B-sides and unreleased songs from the era, and also performed with the band most of the way through tours supporting the album.

===Mental illness and exit from Weezer===
In 2001, Welsh suffered a breakdown brought on by drug use, undiagnosed mental health problems, and the strain of touring. After attempting suicide by drug overdose, he left Weezer. The reason for his exit was not made public until some time later. He was checked into a psychiatric hospital in August 2001. He later spoke about the ordeal in an interview with the website &quot;Rock Salt Plum&quot;: 

Weezer shot a new version of the video for their song &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; without Welsh. Following Welsh&#x27;s departure in 2001, the band hired Scott Shriner to replace Welsh.

===Retirement from music===
In late 2001/2002, Welsh returned to the Boston music scene by temporarily joining the Kickovers, the band of Nate Albert, guitarist for the Mighty Mighty Bosstones. In an interview, he expressed his distaste for the corporate music process, stating that, &quot;It&#x27;s actually fun to just be playing in the studio without some major-label idiot standing over your shoulder.&quot; Soon after, he retired from music to become a full-time artist. He, his wife and their two sons lived in Vermont.

Welsh attended a Weezer show on July 12, 2005, in Lewiston, Maine. Cuomo dedicated &quot;Hash Pipe&quot; to him, drawing cheers from the crowd. On September 2, 2010, he joined the band on stage at a show in Essex Junction, Vermont, to play bass on the song &quot;Hash Pipe&quot;. On July 29, 2011, Welsh played guitar on the song &quot;Undone&quot; with Weezer and the Flaming Lips at a show in New York.

===Art career===
Welsh became an artist and, as of August 2008, had 13 exhibitions of his artwork. He was a member of &quot;Outsider Art&quot;.

A quote from Welsh&#x27;s official website explained his methods of creating his art:

Welsh&#x27;s artwork is featured on a Burton snowboard, in a line of snowboards titled &quot;The Farm&quot;. He designed and painted the album cover for Twin Berlin&#x27;s debut album.

==Death==
On September 26, 2011, Welsh wrote on Twitter: &quot;dreamt i died in chicago next weekend (heart attack in my sleep). need to write my will today.&quot; On October 8, 2011, Welsh was found dead in a Chicago hotel room from a suspected heroin overdose, leading to a heart attack. His death was not formally declared a suicide, despite his prior attempt by the same method.

<text>Temperate coniferous forest is a terrestrial biome defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature. Temperate coniferous forests are found predominantly in areas with warm summers and cool winters, and vary in their kinds of plant life. In some, needleleaf trees dominate, while others are home primarily to broadleaf evergreen trees or a mix of both tree types. A separate habitat type, the tropical coniferous forests, occurs in more tropical climates.

Temperate coniferous forests are common in the coastal areas of regions that have mild winters and heavy rainfall, or inland in drier climates or montane areas. Many species of trees inhabit these forests including pine, cedar, fir, and redwood. The understory also contains a wide variety of herbaceous and shrub species. Temperate coniferous forests sustain the highest levels of biomass in any terrestrial ecosystem and are notable for trees of massive proportions in temperate rainforest regions.

Structurally, these forests are rather simple, consisting of 2 layers generally: an overstory and understory. However, some forests may support a layer of shrubs. Pine forests support an herbaceous ground layer that may be dominated by grasses and forbs that lend themselves to ecologically important wildfires. In contrast, the moist conditions found in temperate rain forests favor the dominance by ferns and some forbs.
Forest communities dominated by huge trees (e.g., giant sequoia, &quot;Sequoiadendron gigantea&quot;; redwood, &quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;), unusual ecological phenomena, occur in western North America, southwestern South America, as well as in the Australasian region in such areas as southeastern Australia and northern New Zealand.

The Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion of western North America harbors diverse and unusual assemblages and displays notable endemism for a number of plant and animal taxa.

<text>Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands is a terrestrial biome defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature. The biome is dominated by grass and/or shrubs located in semi-arid to semi-humid climate regions of subtropical and tropical latitudes. Tropical grasslands are mainly found between 5 degrees and 20 degrees in both North and south of the Equator.

==Description==
Grasslands are dominated by grasses and other herbaceous plants. Savannas are grasslands with scattered trees. Shrublands are dominated by woody or herbaceous shrubs.

Large expanses of land in the tropics do not receive enough rainfall to support extensive tree cover. The tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands are characterized by rainfall levels between per year. Rainfall can be highly seasonal, with the entire year&#x27;s rainfall sometimes occurring within a couple of weeks.

African savannas occur between forest or woodland regions and grassland regions. Flora includes acacia and baobab trees, grass, and low shrubs. Acacia trees lose their leaves in the dry season to conserve moisture, while the baobab stores water in its trunk for the dry season. Many of these savannas are in Africa.

Large mammals that have evolved to take advantage of the ample forage typify the biodiversity associated with these habitats. These large mammal faunas are richest in African savannas and grasslands. The most intact assemblages currently occur in East African Acacia savannas and Zambezian savannas consisting of mosaics of miombo, mopane, and other habitats. Large-scale migration of tropical savanna herbivores, such as wildebeest (&quot;Connochaetes taurinus&quot;) and zebra (&quot;Equus quagga&quot;), are continuing to decline through habitat alteration and hunting. They now only occur to any significant degree in East Africa and the central Zambezian region. Much of the extraordinary abundance of Guinean and Sahelian savannas has been eliminated, although the large-scale migrations of Ugandan Kob still occur in the savannas in the Sudd region. The Sudan type of climate is characterized by an alternating hot and rainy season, and a cool and dry season. In the Northern Hemisphere, the hot rainy season normally begins in May and lasts until September. Rainfall varies from 25 cm to 150 cm and is usually unreliable. The rest of the year is cool and dry. Rainfall decreases as one goes either towards North in Northern Hemisphere or South in the Southern Hemisphere. Drought is very common.

==Occurrence==
Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands occur on all continents but Antarctica. They are widespread in Africa, and are also found all throughout South Asia and Southeast Asia, the northern parts of South America and Australia, and the southern United States.

<text>Flooded grasslands and savannas is a terrestrial biome of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) biogeographical system, consisting of large expanses or complexes of flooded grasslands. These areas support numerous plants and animals adapted to the unique hydrologic regimes and soil conditions. Large congregations of migratory and resident waterbirds may be found in these regions. The relative importance of these habitat types for these birds as well as more migratory animals typically varies, as the availability of water and productivity annually and seasonally shifts among complexes of smaller and larger wetlands throughout a region.

This habitat type is found in Asia, Africa, North America and South America. Some globally outstanding flooded savannas and grasslands occur in the Everglades, Pantanal, Lake Chad flooded savanna, Zambezian flooded grasslands, and the Sudd. The Everglades, with an area of , are the world&#x27;s largest rain-fed flooded grassland on a limestone substrate, and feature some 11,000 species of seed-bearing plants, 25 varieties of orchids, 300 bird species, and 150 fish species. The Pantanal, with an area of , is the largest flooded grassland on Earth, supporting over 260 species of fish, 700 birds, 90 mammals, 160 reptiles, 45 amphibians, 1,000 butterflies, and 1,600 species of plants. The flooded savannas and grasslands are generally the largest complexes in each region.

<doc id="203091" wikidata="Q1214920" url="?curid=203091" title="The Music of Erich Zann">
<text>&quot;The Music of Erich Zann&quot; is a horror short story by American author H. P. Lovecraft. Written in December 1921, it was first published in &quot;National Amateur&quot;, March 1922.

The story is an account of the enigmatic Erich Zann, an elderly musician whose unique and unworldly melodies draw the curiosity of a young university student.

==Plot==
Due to lack of funds, a student studying metaphysics abroad is forced to take up lodging in a cheap apartment building on a street named the &quot;Rue d&#x27;Auseil&quot;. The street is not far from his university and is bordered by a river, dark warehouses and a large wall, and is described as being very steeply inclined, as if being on a cliff. The student cannot see what lies on the other side of the wall, as only a single window on the top floor of his building looks over it. Along with the building&#x27;s disabled landlord, Blandot, one of the few other tenants is an old German man named Erich Zann. The old man is mute and plays the viol with a local theater orchestra. He lives alone on the top floor and at night he plays strange melodies the student has never heard before.

Despite Zann&#x27;s reclusiveness, Blandot reveals his identity to the student, who approaches him in the hallway one evening and asks if he can listen to Zann&#x27;s music. Zann allows the student to enter his room. He plays for the student some of his unique melodies but not the same as the student had previously heard. The student asks him if he could play his music from the previous nights, awkwardly humming and whistling the notes he remembered. Zann is taken aback by the request and nervously glances at the window in his room, covered by curtains. The student recognizes the window as the only one that can oversee the wall at the end of the mysterious street. He approaches it to look outside but Zann angrily pulls him back. The student is fed up with Zann&#x27;s eccentricities but Zann explains through writing that he is simply a lonely old man, and suffers from numerous phobias and nervous disorders. He is pleased that the student likes his music, but refuses to play the particular tunes that the student asked for. He persuades the student to move to a lower floor in the apartment as he would prefer the student not listen to them. The student sympathizes with Zann and agrees to move. Zann promises that he will invite the student to his room to hear his other music. After the student moves, however, Zann returns to his antisocial behavior and his health deteriorates, eventually not letting the student listen at all.

The student&#x27;s curiosity to hear the secret music and look out the window grows, and he begins eavesdropping on Zann while he plays at night. His melodies have an unearthly sound, and the student praises Zann as a musical genius. One night while secretly listening outside Zann’s room, the student hears a commotion and the old man scream inside. When the student bangs at the door, Zann lets him in and asks him to wait while he writes, promising to explain everything. More than an hour into writing, Zann is startled by a distant sound in the form of a low note, interrupts his writing and starts furiously playing his viol with a crescent terror. The music is horrific and the student surmises that Zann is playing wildly to drown out or keep something out of the room. Zann seemingly enters a stupor, doing nothing but playing his music. Another sound from outside the room, which the student perceives to be mocking them, is heard and a gust shatters the window. The unnatural wind sweeps through the room, blowing Zann&#x27;s unread papers out the window, despite the student&#x27;s attempts at catching them. The student remembers his curiosity and finally looks out the window. Instead of seeing the city lights, he only sees a terrible black void, an infinite abyss of chaos.

The howling winds and cacophony of elements snuff out the candles in the room, leaving the student and Zann in complete darkness. He blindly moves through the dark with desperation, and feels a &quot;chill thing&quot; brush up against him. Determined to save Zann, the student reaches the musician and screams at him to run, but Zann only continues to play his music. Upon attempting to physically carry him to safety, he discovers Zann is dead, although his body is still playing. With this realization, the student bolts for the door, frantically fleeing the apartment and entire neighborhood. He only realizes afterward that the sky was calm and the city lights were shining.

Writing an account of the incident years later, the student states that despite his best efforts, he has never again been able to find the Rue d&#x27;Auseil. It does not appear on any maps, and it seems no one else has even heard of it. But he feels a degree of relief that he cannot find the street, or the lost papers that could have explained the music of Erich Zann.

==Setting==
The setting of the story is presumably France or another French-speaking country, sometime in the late-19th or early-20th century, though the exact location and date are never named. &quot;Auseil&quot; is not a true French word, but it has been suggested that Lovecraft derived it from the phrase &quot;au seuil&quot;, meaning &quot;at the threshold&quot;. Auseil is read like &quot;oseille&quot;, meaning sorrel or, colloquially, money. The identity of the student is never elaborated upon, only that he is a foreigner like Zann and studies metaphysics.

==Reactions==
Lovecraft considered &quot;The Music of Erich Zann&quot; one of his best stories, in part because it avoided the overexplicitness that he saw as a major flaw in some of his other work. &quot;An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia&quot; notes that it &quot;might, however, be said that HPL erred on the side of &quot;under&quot;explicitness in the very nebulous horror to be seen through Zann&#x27;s garret window.&quot;

The story was frequently anthologized even during Lovecraft&#x27;s lifetime, including in Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s 1931 collection &quot;Creeps by Night&quot;. Ramsey Campbell has stated that &quot;The Music of Erich Zann&quot; was &quot;the single Lovecraft story that the late Robert Aickman liked&quot;. Campbell himself used only &quot;The Music of Erich Zann&quot; when creating the &quot;Folio Book of Horror Stories&quot;.

==Influence==
===Comics===
* A comic book adaption was released in 1993 by Caliber Press. It apparently incorporates vistas and creatures described in &quot;The Dreams in the Witch House&quot; in the story including the eponymous Erich Zann encountering Nyarlathotep in flashbacks.

===Literature===
*James Wade wrote a sequel to the story, &quot;The Silence of Erika Zann&quot;, first published in &quot;The Disciples of Cthulhu&quot; (1976).
*The story is illustrated by Barry Moser as part of the 1998 children&#x27;s book, &quot;Great Ghost Stories&quot;.
*In Charles Stross&#x27;s &quot;The Laundry Files&quot; novels series including &quot;The Jennifer Morgue&quot;, &quot;The Fuller Memorandum&quot;, &quot;The Apocalypse Codex&quot;, &quot;The Rhesus Chart&quot;, and &quot;The Annihilation Score&quot; one of the characters has a violin made by an &quot;Erich Zahn&quot; which is made from human bones and, when played, eats the soul of the intended victim.

===Film===
*Leigh Blackmore scripted a short film version in 1975, however the script was never filmed

===Music===
*American composer Raymond Wilding-White created a piece in 1980 by the same title for violin and electronics, with Eugene Gratovich of DePaul University in the role of the university student.
*Univers Zéro&#x27;s album &quot;Ceux du dehors&quot; (1981) includes a track titled &quot;La musique d&#x27;Erich Zann&quot;. According to drummer and bandleader Daniel Denis, all members read the short story in the studio and promptly improvised the piece.
*German technical thrash metal band Mekong Delta titled their 1988 second album &quot;The Music of Erich Zann&quot; after the story. 
*British Anarcho-punk band Rudimentary Peni featured a depiction of Eric Zann on the original cover of their 1988 album &quot;Cacophony&quot;.
*Hungarian Metal band Without Face has a song called &quot;The Violin of Erich Zann&quot; on the 2002 album &quot;Astronomicon&quot;.
*Japanese jazz-rock band Fragile&#x27;s album ZANN is probably a reference to this story.
*German ambient band Forma Tadre titled their 2008 album &quot;The Music of Erich Zann&quot;.

<doc id="203095" wikidata="Q1213800" url="?curid=203095" title="The Cats of Ulthar">
<text>&quot;The Cats of Ulthar&quot; is a short story written by American fantasy author H. P. Lovecraft in June 1920. In the tale, an unnamed narrator relates the story of how a law forbidding the killing of cats came to be in a town called Ulthar. As the narrative goes, the city is home to an old couple who enjoy capturing and killing the townspeople&#x27;s cats. When a caravan of wanderers passes through the city, the kitten of an orphan (Menes) traveling with the band disappears. Upon hearing of the couple&#x27;s violent acts towards cats, Menes invokes a prayer before leaving town that causes the local felines to swarm the cat-killers&#x27; house and devour them. Upon witnessing the result, the local politicians pass a law forbidding the killing of cats.

Influenced by Lord Dunsany, the tale was a personal favorite of Lovecraft&#x27;s and has remained popular since his death. Considered one of the best short stories of Lovecraft&#x27;s early period, aspects of &quot;The Cats of Ulthar&quot; would be referenced again in the author&#x27;s works &quot;The Other Gods&quot; and &quot;The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot;. It was first published in the literary journal &quot;Tryout&quot; in November 1920 and now resides in the public domain.

==Synopsis==
An unnamed narrator, while gazing upon his pet cat, begins to reminisce about a law in the town of Ulthar which forbids the killing of cats and relates the story of how this law came to be. The tale begins with the introduction of an old cotter and his wife, who delight in trapping and violently killing any cats who venture onto their property. The people of the town are too afraid of the couple to speak against these acts, so they instead focus their efforts on keeping their felines from approaching the cotter&#x27;s house. One night, a caravan of travelers from a distant land arrives and passes through the village. They bring with them an orphan named Menes who, having lost his family to a plague, has only a small, black kitten to keep him company. After being unable to find his kitten on the third day of his stay, Menes hears the stories of the old cotter and his wife, and decides to take action.

Menes spends time meditating prior to unleashing a prayer that affects the shapes and movements of the clouds in the sky, granting all the cats of Ulthar sentience. The caravan leaves Ulthar that night, shortly before the townspeople notice that all of their cats have gone missing. The townspeople suspect both the old couple and the wanderers, but the innkeeper&#x27;s son Atal witnesses the felines circling the property of the cotter. The next morning, the cats have returned to their owners well-fed, but the cotter and his wife have vanished. When the townspeople explore their abandoned house, they discover nothing more than two skeletons that have been picked clean. The local burgesses, after reviewing the evidence and stories of the townspeople, decide to pass a law that forbids the killing of cats in Ulthar.

==Background==
Lovecraft outlined the plot to his friend Rheinhart Kleiner in May 1920 and wrote &quot;The Cats of Ulthar&quot; on June 15, 1920, five months after completing his previous tale, &quot;The Terrible Old Man&quot;. Conceived during the author&#x27;s early period, Lovecraft was influenced by the writing of Anglo-Irish writer Lord Dunsany and attempted to mimic his style. Among the literary aspects that Lovecraft borrows are the &quot;vengeance motif&quot; and the &quot;ponderous tone&quot; of Dunsany. Dunsany&#x27;s influence is evident on the surface of the text as well: wanderers, similar to the ones portrayed in &quot;The Cats of Ulthar&quot;, appear in Dunsany&#x27;s earlier tale &quot;Idle Days on the Yann&quot;. Lovecraft&#x27;s character of Menes shares his name with Menes, the semi-mythical founder of the ancient city of Memphis, Egypt. The ancient Egyptians were admirers of cats who made it a crime to kill or export felines.

Prior to &quot;The Cats of Ulthar&quot;, Lovecraft had penned several tales in the style of Lord Dunsany, including &quot;The White Ship&quot;, &quot;The Street&quot;, &quot;The Doom that Came to Sarnath&quot;, &quot;The Terrible Old Man&quot;, and &quot;The Tree&quot;. His next Dunsanian tale, &quot;Celephaïs&quot;, was considered by Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi to be &quot;one of his best and most significant&quot;. &quot;The Cats of Ulthar&quot; was first published in the literary journal &quot;Tryout&quot; in November 1920, and later appeared in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in February 1926 and 1933, as well as being privately reprinted in a forty two-copy run in December 1935.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;The Cats of Ulthar&quot; was a personal favorite of Lovecraft&#x27;s, who was an ardent cat lover. A number of contemporary critics, as well as Lovecraft himself, consider the story to be the best of all his Dunsanian tales. Other critics have noted that the story is one of Lovecraft&#x27;s most famous tales that fits both the Dunsanian and the &quot;weird fantasy&quot; style. Literary critic Darrell Schweitzer, however, comments that &quot;The Cats of Ulthar&quot; resembles Dunsany in &quot;mood and execution&quot; only and that &quot;[it] has no obvious parallels in any Dunsany story&quot;. Schweitzer refers to the prose as &quot;restrained&quot;, and notes that, unlike Lovecraft, Dunsany preferred dogs and would have been unlikely to have written such an enthusiastic tribute. Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi disagrees, claiming that &quot;[t]his tale owes more to Dunsany than many of his other &#x27;Dunsanian&#x27; fantasies&quot;.

The character of Atal, the innkeeper&#x27;s son who witnesses the cats of Ulthar circling the antagonists&#x27; cottage, would later appear in Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Other Gods&quot;. In this short story, written in August 1921 and first published in November 1933, Atal, now an adult, becomes an apprentice to Barzai the Wise and travels with him to seek out the tale&#x27;s eponymous deities. Barzai even mentions the law against killing cats in Ulthar, further cementing the connection. Atal also appears as a priest in the long &quot;The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot; — written in 1927 but not published until 1943 — when protagonist Randolph Carter visits the city 300 years after the events in &quot;The Cats of Ulthar&quot;, when the town is still heavily populated by felines. Carter is later able to summon the cats of Ulthar to his aid. Cats would be used in what scholar Katharine M. Rogers calls &quot;a more original way&quot; in Lovecraft&#x27;s 1923 work &quot;The Rats in the Walls&quot;. Here, as in others of Lovecraft&#x27;s later tales, cats embody the attraction to horror while, unlike the human protagonists, &quot;never pursuing horror to the point of becoming horrible themselves&quot;. The text of &quot;The Cats of Ulthar&quot;, like many of Lovecraft&#x27;s works, has fallen into the public domain and can be accessed in several compilations of the author&#x27;s work as well as on the Internet.

<doc id="203096" wikidata="Q336091" url="?curid=203096" title="Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford">
<text>Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford (13 April 1593 (N.S.)12 May 1641), was an English statesman and a major figure in the period leading up to the English Civil War. He served in Parliament and was a supporter of King Charles I. From 1632 to 1640 he was Lord Deputy of Ireland, where he established a strong authoritarian rule. Recalled to England, he became a leading advisor to the King, attempting to strengthen the royal position against Parliament. When Parliament condemned Lord Strafford to death, Charles reluctantly signed the death warrant and Strafford was executed. He had been advanced several times in the Peerage of England during his career, being created 1st Baron Wentworth in 1628, 1st Viscount Wentworth in late 1628 or early 1629, and, finally, 1st [[Earl of Strafford]] in January 1640. He was known as Sir Thomas Wentworth, 2nd Baronet, between 1614 and 1628.

==Early life==
Wentworth was born in London. He was the son of Sir William Wentworth, 1st Baronet, of Wentworth Woodhouse, near Rotherham, a member of an old Yorkshire family, and of Anne, daughter of Sir Robert Atkins of Stowell, Gloucestershire. He was educated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, became a law student at the Inner Temple in 1607, and in 1611 was knighted. He married firstly Margaret, daughter of Francis Clifford, Earl of Cumberland and Grisold Hughes.

==Early parliamentary career==
The young Sir Thomas Wentworth, 2nd Baronet, entered the English Parliament in 1614 as Yorkshire&#x27;s representative in the &quot;Addled Parliament&quot;, but it was not until the parliament of 1621, in which he sat for the same constituency, that he took part in a debate. His position was ambivalent. He did not sympathise with the zeal of the popular party for war with Spain, favoured by George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, James I&#x27;s foremost advisor and favourite, but James&#x27;s denial of the rights and privileges of parliament seems to have caused Wentworth to join in the vindication of the claims of the House of Commons, and he supported the protestation which dissolved the third parliament of James.

In 1622 Wentworth&#x27;s first wife Margaret Clifford died. Wentworth, according to his friends, was deeply grieved by her death; but in February 1625 he married Arabella Holles, daughter of John Holles, 1st Earl of Clare and Anne Stanhope: a marriage which was generally believed to be a true love affair on both sides. He represented Pontefract in the Happy Parliament of 1624, but appears to have taken no active part. He expressed a wish to avoid foreign complications and &quot;do first the business of the commonwealth&quot;.

In the first parliament of Charles I, in June 1625, Wentworth again represented Yorkshire, and showed his hostility to the proposed war with Spain by supporting a motion for an adjournment before the house proceeded to business. He opposed the demand for war subsidies made on Buckingham&#x27;s behalf—after the death of James I, Buckingham had become first minister to Charles—and after Parliament was dissolved in November he was made High Sheriff of Yorkshire, a position which excluded him from the parliament which met in 1626. Yet he had never taken up an attitude of antagonism to the King. His position was very different from that of the regular opposition. He was anxious to serve the Crown, but he disapproved of the King&#x27;s policy.

In January 1626 Wentworth asked for the presidency of the Council of the North, and was favourably received by Buckingham. But after the dissolution of the parliament, he was dismissed from the justiceship of the peace and the office of &quot;custos rotulorum&quot; of Yorkshire—which he had held since 1615—probably because he would not support the court in forcing the country to contribute money without a parliamentary grant. In 1627, he refused to contribute to the forced loan, and was subsequently imprisoned.

==The Petition of Right and its aftermath==
In 1628, Wentworth was one of the more vocal supporters of the Petition of Right, which attempted to curb the power of the King. Once Charles had grudgingly accepted the Petition, Wentworth felt it appropriate to support the crown, saying, &quot;The authority of a king is the keystone which closeth up the arch of order and government&quot;. He was consequently branded a turncoat.

In the parliament of 1628, Wentworth joined the popular leaders in resistance to arbitrary taxation and imprisonment, but tried to obtain his goal without offending the Crown. He led the movement for a bill which would have secured the liberties of the subject as completely as the Petition of Right afterwards did, but in a manner less offensive to the King. The proposal failed because of both the uncompromising nature of the parliamentary party and Charles&#x27;s stubborn refusal to make concessions, and the leadership was snatched from Wentworth&#x27;s hands by John Eliot and Edward Coke. Later in the session, he quarrelled with Eliot because Wentworth wanted to come to a compromise with the Lords, so as to leave room for the King to act unchecked in special emergencies.

On 22 July 1628, not long after the prorogation, Wentworth was created Baron Wentworth, and received the promise of the presidency of the Council of the North at the next vacancy. This implied no change of principle. He was now at variance with the Parliamentary Party on two great subjects of policy, disapproving both of the intention of Parliament to take the powers of the executive and also of its inclination towards Puritanism. When once the breach was made it naturally grew wider, partly from the energy each party put into its work, and partly from the personal animosities which arose.

As yet Wentworth was not directly involved in the government of the country. However, following the assassination of Buckingham, in December 1628, he became Viscount Wentworth and not long afterwards president of the Council of the North. In the speech delivered at York on taking office, he announced his intention, almost in the words of Francis Bacon, of doing his utmost to bind up the prerogative of the Crown and the liberties of the subject in an indistinguishable union. &quot;Whoever&quot;, he said, &quot;ravels forth into questions the right of a king and of a people shall never be able to wrap them up again into the comeliness and order he found them&quot;. His tactics were the same as those he later practised in Ireland, leading to the accusation that he planned to centralise all power with the executive at the expense of the individual in defiance of constitutional liberties.

The parliamentary session of 1629 ended in a breach between the King and Parliament, which made the task of a moderator hopeless. Wentworth had to choose between either helping the House of Commons dominate the King or helping the King to dominate the House of Commons. He chose the latter course, throwing himself into the work of repression with characteristic energy and claiming that he was maintaining the old constitution and that his opponents in Parliament were attempting to alter it by claiming supremacy for Parliament. From this time on, he acted as one of two principal members (the other being Archbishop William Laud of Canterbury) in a team of key royal advisors (the &quot;Thorough Party&quot;) during an 11-year period of total monarchical rule without parliament (known both as &quot;the Personal Rule&quot; and the &quot;eleven-year tyranny&quot;).

==Lord Deputy of Ireland==


The 1st Viscount Wentworth, as he had become, became a privy counsellor in November 1629. On 12 January 1632 he was made Lord Deputy of Ireland, arriving in Dublin on 23 July the following year. He had recently suffered the loss of his beloved second wife Arabella in childbirth. Despite his genuine grief for Arabella, his third marriage to Elizabeth Rhodes in 1632 was also a happy one; but through a strange lapse of judgement, he did not announce it publicly for almost a year, by which time damaging rumours about the presence of a young woman in his house (who was reputed to be his mistress) had gained wide circulation. Wedgwood remarks that it was typical of Wentworth to be oblivious to the bad impression which actions like this might make on the public. Gossip later linked his name with that of Eleanor Loftus, daughter-in-law of The 1st Viscount Loftus, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, but although a strong bond existed between them, and her death in 1639 caused him much grief, there is no evidence that their relationship went beyond friendship.

In his government here he proved to be an able ruler. &quot;The lord deputy of Ireland&quot;, wrote Sir Thomas Roe to Elizabeth of Bohemia, &quot;doth great wonders and governs like a king, and hath taught that kingdom to show us an example of envy, by having parliaments and knowing wisely how to use them.&quot; He reformed the administration, summarily dismissing the inefficient English officials. He succeeded in so manipulating the parliaments that he obtained the necessary grants, and secured their cooperation in various useful legislative enactments. He started a new victualling trade with Spain, promoted linen manufacture, and encouraged the development of the resources of the country in many directions. The Court of Castle Chamber, the Irish counterpart of the Star Chamber, which up to that time had only operated intermittently, was transformed into a regular and efficient part of the Irish administration.

Customs duties rose from a little over £25,000 in 1633–34 to £57,000 in 1637–38. Wentworth raised an army, put an end to piracy, imposed Arminian reforms onto the Calvinist-dominated Church of Ireland, and launched a campaign to win back Church lands lost during the Reformation. His strong administration reduced the tyranny of the wealthy over the poor. Yet these measures were all carried out by arbitrary methods which made them unpopular. Their aim was not the prosperity of the Irish but the benefit to the English exchequer, and Wentworth suppressed the trade in cloth &quot;lest it should be a means to prejudice that staple commodity of England.&quot; Castle Chamber, like its model Star Chamber, was accused of brutal and arbitrary proceedings. Individual cases of unfairness included those of Robert Esmond, a ship&#x27;s captain, and cousin of Laurence Esmonde, Lord Esmonde, accused of customs evasions, whom Wentworth was alleged to have assaulted, so causing his death, Lord Chancellor Loftus and Lord Mountnorris, the last of whom Wentworth caused to be sentenced to death to obtain the resignation of his office, and then pardoned. Promises of legislation such as the concessions known as &#x27;The Graces&#x27; were not kept.

Wentworth ignored Charles&#x27; promise that no colonists would be awarded land, to the detriment of Catholic landholders, in Connaught. In 1635 he raked up an obsolete title—the grant in the 14th century of Connaught to Lionel of Antwerp, whose heir Charles was—and insisted upon the grand juries finding verdicts for the King. One county only, County Galway, resisted, and the confiscation of Galway was effected by the Court of Exchequer, while Wentworth fined the sheriff £1,000 for summoning such a jury, and cited the jurymen to the Castle Chamber to answer for their offence. In Ulster the arbitrary confiscation of the property of the city companies aroused dangerous animosity against the government. His actions in Galway led to a clash with the powerful Burke family, headed by the ageing Richard Burke, Earl of Clanricarde. Clanricarde&#x27;s death was said by some to have been hastened by the clash: Wentworth, on hearing these reports, said he could hardly be blamed for the fact that Clanricarde was nearly seventy. It was, however, unwise to have made an enemy of the new Earl, Ulick Burke, 5th Earl of Clanricarde, who through his mother Frances Walsingham had powerful English connections: Clanricarde&#x27;s half-brother, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, by 1641 was to become one of Wentworth&#x27;s (who became Earl of Strafford in 1640) most implacable enemies.

Wentworth made many enemies in Ireland, but none more dangerous than Richard Boyle, Earl of Cork, the most powerful of the &quot;New English&quot; magnates. A more diplomatic man than Wentworth would no doubt have sought Cork&#x27;s friendship, but Wentworth saw Cork&#x27;s great power as a threat to the Crown&#x27;s central authority, and was determined to curb it. He prosecuted Lord Cork in Castle Chamber for misappropriating the funds of Youghal College; and ordered him to take down the tomb of his first wife in St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin. Cork, a patient and implacable enemy, worked quietly for Wentworth&#x27;s downfall, and in 1641 recorded calmly in his diary that Wentworth (by then Earl of Strafford) had been beheaded &quot;as he well deserved&quot;.

Toward the native Irish, Wentworth had no notion of developing their qualities by a process of natural growth; his only hope for them lay in converting them into Englishmen as soon as possible. They must be made English in their habits, in their laws and in their religion. &quot;I see plainly ... that, so long as this kingdom continues popish, they are not a people for the Crown of England to be confident of&quot;, he wrote. Although staunchly Protestant, he showed no desire to persecute Catholics: as J.P. Kenyon remarks, it was understood that so long as Catholics remained the great majority of the population, there would have to be a much larger degree of toleration than was necessary in England. He was prepared to give tacit recognition to the Catholic hierarchy, and even gave an interview to Archbishop Thomas Fleming of Dublin, whose homely face, plain dress and lack of ostentation made a poor impression on him.

Under Wentworth&#x27;s patronage, the Werburgh Street Theatre, Ireland&#x27;s first theatre, was opened by John Ogilby, a member of his household, and survived for several years despite the opposition of Archbishop James Ussher of Armagh. James Shirley, the English dramatist, wrote several plays for it, one with a distinctively Irish theme, and &quot;Landgartha&quot;, by Henry Burnell, the first known play by an Irish dramatist, was produced there in 1640.

Wentworth&#x27;s heavy-handed approach did yield some improvements, as well as contribute to the strength of the royal administration in Ireland. His hindrance in 1634 of &#x27;The Graces&#x27;, a campaign for equality by Roman Catholics in the Parliament of Ireland, lost him goodwill but was based on fiscal and not religious principles. Wentworth regarded the proper management of Parliament as a crucial test of his success, and in the short term, his ruthless methods did produce results. Having settled on Nathaniel Catelyn as the most suitable Speaker, he coerced the voters of Dublin into returning him as member, and ordered the Commons to elect him Speaker. The Parliament of 1634/5 did pass some useful legislation: the Act against Fraudulent Conveyances remained in force into the 21st century. His second Parliament, however, having paid him abject compliments, began to attack his administration as soon as Wentworth left for England.

The future Duke of Ormond became Wentworth&#x27;s chief friend and supporter. Wentworth planned large-scale confiscations of Catholic-owned land, both to raise money for the crown and to break the political power of the Irish Catholic gentry, a policy which Ormonde supported. Yet it infuriated Ormonde&#x27;s relatives and drove many of them into opposition to Wentworth and ultimately into armed rebellion. In 1640, with Wentworth having been recalled to attend to the Second Bishops&#x27; War in England, Ormonde was made commander-in-chief of the forces in Ireland. Wedgwood concludes that whatever his intentions Wentworth/Strafford in Ireland achieved only one thing: to unite every faction in Ireland in their determination to be rid of him.

Wentworth&#x27;s rule in Ireland made him more high-handed at court than ever. He had never been consulted on English affairs until February 1637 when King Charles asked Wentworth&#x27;s opinion on a proposed interference in the affairs of the Continent. In reply, Wentworth assured Charles it would be unwise to undertake even naval operations till he had secured absolute power at home. He wished that Hampden and his followers &quot;were well whipped into their right senses&quot;. The judges had given the King the right to levy ship-money, but, unless his majesty had &quot;the like power declared to raise a land army, the Crown&quot; seemed &quot;to stand upon one leg at home, to be considerable but by halves to foreign princes abroad&quot;. When the Scottish Covenanters rebelled he advocated the most decided measures of repression, in February 1639 sending the King £2000 as his contribution to the expenses of the coming war, at the same time deprecating an invasion of Scotland before the English army was trained, and advising certain concessions in religion.

Wentworth apparently intended to put down roots in Ireland: in the late 1630s he was much occupied with building a mansion, Jigginstown Castle, near Naas, County Kildare. He is thought to have intended it to be his official residence where he could entertain the King, should he visit Ireland. The castle, which was to be built partly of red brick and partly of Kilkenny marble, would, had it been completed, have been probably the largest private house in Ireland, but after Wentworth&#x27;s death, it quickly fell into ruin, although the ground floor still exists.

He made some efforts also to build up a network of family alliances in Ireland: his brother George, to whom he was close, married Anne Ruish, sister of Strafford&#x27;s great friend Eleanor Loftus, and his sister Elizabeth married James Dillon, Earl of Roscommon. Roscommon, unlike most of the Anglo-Irish nobility, remained staunchly loyal to the King during the Civil War. His son Wentworth Dillon, 4th Earl of Roscommon, was named for his distinguished uncle, and grew up to be a poet of some distinction. Strafford seems to have taken some interest in his nephew&#x27;s education, and he spent part of his childhood at his uncle&#x27;s Yorkshire home.

==Recall and impeachment==
Wentworth was recalled to England in September 1639. He was expected to help sort out the problems that were growing at home: namely, bankruptcy and war with the Scottish Covenanters, and became the King&#x27;s principal adviser. Unaware how much opposition had developed in England during his absence, he recommended the calling of a parliament to support a renewal of the war, hoping that by the offer of a loan from the Privy Councillors, to which he contributed £20,000, he would save Charles from having to submit to the new parliament if it proved truculent.

The King created him Earl of Strafford in January 1640 (the Wentworth family seat of Wentworth Woodhouse lay in the hundred of Strafford (Strafforth) in the West Riding of Yorkshire) and in March he went to Ireland to hold an Irish parliament, where the Catholic vote secured a grant of subsidies to be used against the Presbyterian Scots. An Irish army was to be levied to assist in the coming war. When Strafford returned to England, he found that the Commons were holding back from a grant of supply, so he tried to enlist the peers on the side of the King, and persuaded Charles to be content with a smaller grant than he had originally asked for.

From April to August 1640, on his return from Ireland, Strafford occupied the newly built Leicester House, Westminster, in the absence of its owner Lord Leicester.

The Commons insisted on peace with the Scots. Charles, on the advice of—or perhaps by the treachery of—Henry Vane the Elder, returned to his larger demand of 12 subsidies; and on 9 May, at the privy council, Strafford, though reluctantly, voted for a dissolution. The same morning the Committee of Eight of the privy council met again. Vane and others were for a mere defence against invasion. Strafford&#x27;s advice was the contrary. &quot;Go on vigorously or let them alone ... go on with a vigorous war as you first designed, loose and absolved from all rules of government, being reduced to extreme necessity, everything is to be done that power might admit ... You have an army in Ireland you may employ here to reduce this kingdom&quot;. He tried to force the citizens of London to lend money, and supported a project for debasing the coinage and seizing bullion in the Tower of London (the property of foreign merchants). He also advocated the purchase of a loan from Spain by the offer of a future alliance. Strafford was now appointed to command the English army, and was made a Knight of the Garter, but he fell ill at a crucial moment. In the great council of peers, which assembled on 24 September at York, the struggle was given up, and Charles announced that he had issued writs for another parliament.

By late 1640, there was no option but to call a new Parliament. The Long Parliament assembled on 3 November 1640, and Charles immediately summoned Strafford to London, promising that he &quot;should not suffer in his person, honour or fortune&quot;. One of Parliament&#x27;s first actions was to impeach Strafford for &quot;high misdemeanours&quot; regarding his conduct in Ireland. He arrived on 9 November and the next day asked Charles I to forestall his impeachment by accusing the leaders of the popular party of treasonable communications with the Scots. The plan having been betrayed, John Pym immediately took up the impeachment to the House of Lords on 11 November. Strafford came in person to confront his accusers, but was ordered to withdraw and taken into custody. On 25 November his preliminary charge was brought up, whereupon he was sent to the Tower of London, and, on 31 January 1641, the accusations in detail were presented. These were that Strafford had tried to subvert the fundamental laws of the kingdom. Much stress was laid on Strafford&#x27;s reported words: &quot;You have an army in Ireland you may employ here to reduce &quot;this kingdom&quot;&quot;.

==The failure of impeachment and the Bill of Attainder==


However tyrannical Strafford&#x27;s earlier conduct may have been, his offence was outside the definition of high treason. Although a flood of complaints poured in from Ireland, and Strafford&#x27;s many enemies there were happy to testify against him, none of them could point to any act which was treasonable, as opposed to high-handed. The copy of rough notes of Strafford&#x27;s speech in the committee of the council, obtained from Sir Henry Vane the Younger, were validated by councillors who had been present on the occasion, including Henry Vane the Elder, who did ultimately corroborate them (but nearly disowned his own son for having found and leaked them in the first place), and partially by Algernon Percy, Earl of Northumberland. This was not evidence which would convict in a court of law, and all parties knew this. Strafford&#x27;s words, particularly the crucial phrase &quot;this kingdom&quot;, had to be arbitrarily interpreted as referring to the subjection of England and not of Scotland, and were also spoken on a privileged occasion. Strafford took full advantage of the weak points in his attack on the evidence collected. Over and over Strafford pointed to the fundamental weakness in the prosecution: how could it be treason to carry out the King&#x27;s wishes? The lords, his judges, were influenced in his favour. The impeachment failed on 10 April 1641. Pym and his allies increased public pressure, threatening members of Parliament unless they punished Strafford.

The Commons, therefore, feeling their victim slipping from their grasp, dropped the impeachment, and brought in and passed a bill of attainder on 21 April by a vote of 204 to 59. Owing to the opposition of the Lords, and Pym&#x27;s own preference for the more judicial method, the procedure of impeachment was adhered to. Few of the Lords felt much personal liking for Strafford, but there were a fair number of &quot;moderates&quot;, notably Francis Russell, Earl of Bedford, who thought that barring him from ever serving the King again was sufficient punishment. The families of his first two wives, the Cliffords and Holleses, used all their influence to gain a reprieve: even Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles, who was implacably hostile to the King, put aside political differences to plead for the life of his favourite sister&#x27;s husband. Strafford might still have been saved but for Charles I&#x27;s ill-advised conduct. A scheme to gain over the leaders of the parliament, and a scheme to seize the Tower of London and to liberate Strafford by force, were entertained concurrently and were mutually destructive. The revelation of the First Army Plot on 5 May 1641 caused the Lords to reject the submissions in defence of Strafford by Richard Lane and to pass the attainder. Strafford&#x27;s enemies were implacable in their determination that he should die: in the Earl of Essex&#x27;s phrase &quot;stone dead hath no fellow&quot;, while the view of Oliver St. John was that Strafford should be regarded not a man, but as a dangerous animal who must be &quot;knocked on the head&quot;. Nothing now remained but the King&#x27;s signature.

Still, Strafford had served Charles with what the King felt was a high degree of loyalty, and Charles had a serious problem with signing Strafford&#x27;s death warrant as a matter of conscience, especially as he had explicitly promised Stafford that, no matter what happened, he would not die. However, to refuse the will of Parliament on this matter could seriously threaten the monarchy. When he summoned the bishops to ask for their advice, they were divided. Some, like James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh argued that the King could not in conscience break his promise to Strafford to spare him; others, like Bishop John Williams of Lincoln, took the contrary view that reasons of State permitted the King to break his word where a private citizen could not. Charles had, after the passing of the attainder by the Commons, for the second time assured Strafford &quot;upon the word of a king, you shall not suffer in life, honour or fortune&quot;.

According to &quot;Cobbett&#x27;s State Trials&quot; Strafford wrote releasing the King from his engagements and declaring his willingness to die to reconcile Charles to his subjects: &quot;I do most humbly beseech you, for the preventing of such massacres as may happen by your refusal, to pass the bill; by this means to remove ... the unfortunate thing forth of the way towards that blessed agreement, which God, I trust, shall for ever establish between you and your subjects&quot;. David Hume notes an account from Thomas Carte that the letter was &quot;entirely a forgery of the popular leaders&quot;, although Hume states his own fidelity to the &quot;common way of telling this story&quot;, calling Carte&#x27;s evidence a &quot;hearsay of a hearsay&quot;.

The King did not release the letter to Parliament. Meanwhile, violent mobs threatened the palace with harm to the queen and her children. The King&#x27;s inept efforts to overpower Parliament with military force were revealed by Pym and caused irresistible pressure. Charles gave his assent on 10 May, remarking sadly &quot;My Lord Strafford&#x27;s condition is happier than mine&quot;. Accounts of Strafford&#x27;s reaction when he was told that he must die differ: by one account he took the news stoically; according to another he was deeply distressed, and said bitterly &quot;Put not your trust in princes&quot;. Archbishop Laud wrote that the King&#x27;s abandonment of Strafford proved him to be &quot;a mild and gracious prince, that knows not how to be, or be made, great&quot;.

==Death and aftermath==

Strafford met his fate two days later on Tower Hill, receiving the blessing of Archbishop Laud (who went on to be likewise imprisoned in the Tower, and executed on 10 January 1645). He was executed before a crowd estimated, probably with some exaggeration, at 300,000 on 12 May 1641 (as this number was roughly the population of London at the time, the crowd is likely to have been a good deal smaller). As the common hangman of London, Richard Brandon carried out Strafford&#x27;s execution, and incidentally also of Archbishop Laud in January 1645.

Following news of Strafford&#x27;s execution, Ireland rose in sanguinary rebellion in October 1641, which led to more bickering between King and Parliament, this time over the raising of an army. Any hope that Strafford&#x27;s death would avert the coming crisis soon vanished: Wedgwood quotes the anonymous protest &quot;They promised us that all should be well if my Lord Strafford&#x27;s head were off, since when there is nothing better&quot;. Many of Strafford&#x27;s Irish enemies, like Lord Cork, found that his removal had put their estates, and even their lives, at risk. When Charles I himself was executed eight years later, among his last words were that God had permitted his execution as punishment for his consenting to Strafford&#x27;s death: &quot;that unjust sentence which I suffered to take effect&quot;. In 1660, the House of Lords voted to expunge the record of Strafford&#x27;s attainder from its official Journal, with the intention of repudiating its legal validity.

==Assessment==
In the course of his career, he made many enemies, who pursued him, with a remarkable mixture of fear and hatred, to his death. Yet Strafford was capable of inspiring strong friendships in private life: at least three men who served him in Ireland, Christopher Wandesford, George Radcliffe and Guildford Slingsby, remained his loyal friends to the end. Wentworth&#x27;s last letter to Slingsby before his execution shows an emotional warmth with which he is not often credited. Sir Thomas Roe speaks of him as &quot;Severe abroad and in business, and sweet in private conversation; retired in his friendships but very firm; a terrible judge and a strong enemy&quot;. He was a good husband and a devoted father. His appearance is described by Sir Philip Warwick: &quot;In his person he was of a tall stature, but stooped much in the neck. His countenance was cloudy whilst he moved or sat thinking, but when he spoke, either seriously or facetiously, he had a lightsome and a very pleasant air; and indeed whatever he then did he performed very gracefully&quot;. He himself jested on his own &quot;bent and ill-favoured brow&quot;, Lord Exeter replying that had he been &quot;cursed with a meek brow and an arch of white hair upon it, he would never have governed Ireland nor Yorkshire&quot;. Despite his terrifying manner, there is no real evidence that he was physically violent: even the most serious charge against him, that he ill-treated Robert Esmonde, causing his death, rests on disputed testimony.

==Family==
Strafford was married three times:
* Margaret Clifford (died 1622), daughter of Francis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland.
* Arabella Holles (died October 1631), daughter of John Holles, 1st Earl of Clare. Married in February 1625.
* Elizabeth Rhodes, daughter of Sir Godfrey Rhodes. Married in October 1632; she died in 1688.

Strafford&#x27;s honours were forfeited by his attainder, but his only son, William, who was born on 8 June 1626, received them all by a fresh grant from Charles I on 1 December 1641. In 1662 Parliament reversed his father&#x27;s attainder, and William, already 1st Earl of Strafford of the second creation, became also 2nd earl of the first creation in succession to his father.

In addition to William, Strafford and Arabella had two daughters who outlived him: Anne, born October 1627, who married Edward Watson, 2nd Baron Rockingham; and Arabella, born October 1630, who married Justin McCarthy, Viscount Mountcashel. Through his daughter Anne, Strafford was the ancestor of the prominent eighteenth-century statesman Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham. Strafford had a daughter, Margaret, with his third wife. The hatred felt by so many for Strafford did not extend to his widow and children, who were generally regarded with compassion: even at the height of the Civil War Parliament treated &quot;that poor unfortunate family&quot; with consideration.

==Portrayals==
Thomas was the subject of a verse play by the poet Robert Browning entitled &quot;Strafford&quot; (1837).

Strafford was portrayed by Patrick Wymark in the historical drama film &quot;Cromwell&quot; (1970).

<text>Sir Philip Warwick (24 December 160915 January 1683), English writer and politician, born in Westminster, was the son of Thomas Warwick, or Warrick, a musician.

==Life==
He was educated at Eton, he travelled abroad for some time and in 1636 became secretary to the lord high treasurer, William Juxon; later he was a member of the Long Parliament, for New Radnor Boroughs, being one of those who voted against the attainder of Strafford and who followed Charles I to Oxford. He fought at Edgehill and was one of the king&#x27;s secretaries during the negotiations with the parliament at Hampton Court, and also during those at Newport, Charles speaking very highly of his services just before his execution. Warwick later wrote unflatteringly of Oliver Cromwell that,

He wore... a plain cloth-suit, which seemed to have been made by a poor tailor; his shirt was plain, and not very clean; and I remember a speck or two of blood upon his collar... his face was swollen and red, his voice sharp and untunable, and his speech full of passion.

Remaining in England, Warwick was passively loyal to Charles II during the English Commonwealth period and enjoyed the confidence of the royalist leaders. In 1660 the king made him a knight, and in 1661 he became a member of parliament for Westminster and secretary to another Lord Treasurer, Lord Southampton, retaining this post until the treasury was put into commission on Southampton&#x27;s death in May 1667.

Warwick&#x27;s only son, the younger Philip Warwick (1640–1683), served as envoy to Sweden in 1680.

Warwick is chiefly known for his &quot;Memoirs of the reigne of King Charles I, with a continuation to the happy restoration of King Charles II&quot;, written between 1675 and 1677 and published in London in 1701.

<text>Galveodon is an extinct mammal of the Lower Cretaceous. It was a relatively early representative of the also extinct order of Multituberculata. 

Genus: &quot;Galveodon&quot; (Hahn G &amp; Hahn R, 1992)

Species: &quot;Galveodon nannothus&quot; (Hahn G &amp; Hahn R, 1992) from the Barremian (Lower Cretaceous) Camarillas Formation of Galve, Spain. This species is represented by a tooth in the collection of the museum in Galve.

<doc id="203103" wikidata="Q144005" url="?curid=203103" title="Montane grasslands and shrublands">
<text>Montane grasslands and shrublands are a biome defined by the World Wildlife Fund. The biome includes high elevation grasslands and shrublands around the world. The term &quot;montane&quot; in the name of the biome refers to &quot;high elevation&quot;, rather than the ecological term that denotes the region below the treeline.

This biome includes high elevation (montane and alpine) grasslands and shrublands, including the puna and páramo in South America, subalpine heath in New Guinea and East Africa, steppes of the Tibetan plateaus, as well as other similar subalpine habitats around the world.

The plants and animals of tropical montane páramos display striking adaptations to cool, wet conditions and intense sunlight. Around the world, characteristic plants of these habitats display features such as rosette structures, waxy surfaces, and abundant pilosity.

The páramos of the northern Andes are the most extensive examples of this habitat type. Although ecoregion biotas are most diverse in the Andes, these ecosystems are distinctive wherever they occur in the tropics. The heathlands and moorlands of East Africa (e.g., Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Kenya, Rwenzori Mountains), Mount Kinabalu of Borneo, and the Central Range of New Guinea are all limited in extent, isolated, and support endemic plants and animals.

Drier subtropical montane grasslands, savannas, and woodlands include the Ethiopian Highlands, the Zambezian montane grasslands and woodlands, and the montane habitats of southeastern Africa.

The montane grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau still support relatively intact migrations of Tibetan antelope (&quot;Pantholops Hodgsoni&quot;) and kiang, or Tibetan wild ass (&quot;Equus hemionus&quot;). A unique feature of many tropical páramos is the presence of giant rosette plants from a variety of plant families, such as Lobelia (Africa), Puya (South America), Cyathea (New Guinea), and Argyroxiphium (Hawai’i). These plant forms can reach elevations of above sea level.

<text>Alpine tundra is a type of natural region or biome that does not contain trees because it is at high elevation, with an associated harsh climate. As the latitude of a location approaches the poles, the threshold elevation for alpine tundra gets lower until it reaches sea level, and alpine tundra merges with polar tundra.

The high elevation causes an adverse climate, which is too cold and windy to support tree growth. Alpine tundra transitions to sub-alpine forests below the tree line; stunted forests occurring at the forest-tundra ecotone are known as &quot;krummholz&quot;. With increasing elevation it ends at the snow line where snow and ice persist through summer.

Alpine tundra occurs in mountains worldwide. The flora of the alpine tundra is characterized by dwarf shrubs close to the ground. The cold climate of the alpine tundra is caused by adiabatic cooling of air, and is similar to polar climate.

== Geography ==
Alpine tundra occurs at high enough altitude at any latitude. Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera and parts of the northern Appalachian Mountains in North America, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa, the Snowy Mountains of Australia, the South Island of New Zealand, and the Scandinavian Mountains.

Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.

Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between .

== Climate ==
Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder when reaching higher elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.

In the alpine tundra, trees cannot tolerate the environmental conditions (usually cold temperatures, extreme snowpack, or associated lack of available moisture). Typical high-elevation growing seasons range from 45 to 90 days, with average summer temperatures near . Growing season temperatures frequently fall below freezing, and frost occurs throughout the growing season in many areas. Precipitation occurs mainly as winter snow, but soil water availability is highly variable with season, location, and topography. For example, snowfields commonly accumulate on the lee sides of ridges while ridgelines may remain nearly snow free due to redistribution by wind. Some alpine habitats may be up to 70% snow free in winter. High winds are common in alpine ecosystems, and can cause significant soil erosion and be physically and physiologically detrimental to plants. Also, wind coupled with high solar radiation can promote extremely high rates of evaporation and transpiration.

=== Quantifying the climate ===

There have been several attempts at quantifying what constitutes an alpine climate.

Climatologist Wladimir Köppen demonstrated a relationship between the Arctic and Antarctic tree lines and the 10 °C summer isotherm; i.e., places where the average temperature in the warmest calendar month of the year is below 10 °C cannot support forests. See Köppen climate classification for more information.

Otto Nordenskjöld theorized that winter conditions also play a role: His formula is &quot;W&quot; = 9 − 0.1 &quot;C&quot;, where &quot;W&quot; is the average temperature in the warmest month and &quot;C&quot; the average of the coldest month, both in degrees Celsius (this would mean, for example, that if a particular location had an average temperature of in its coldest month, the warmest month would need to average or higher for trees to be able to survive there).

In 1947, Holdridge improved on these schemes, by defining biotemperature: the mean annual temperature, where all temperatures below 0 °C are treated as 0 °C (because it makes no difference to plant life, being dormant). If the mean biotemperature is between , Holdridge quantifies the climate as alpine.

== Flora ==

Since the habitat of alpine vegetation is subject to intense radiation, wind, cold, snow, and ice, it grows close to the ground and consists mainly of perennial grasses, sedges, and forbs. Perennial herbs (including grasses, sedges, and low woody or semi-woody shrubs) dominate the alpine landscape; they have much more root and rhizome biomass than that of shoots, leaves, and flowers. The roots and rhizomes not only function in water and nutrient absorption but also play a very important role in over-winter carbohydrate storage. Annual plants are rare in this ecosystem and usually are only a few inches tall, with weak root systems. Other common plant life-forms include prostrate shrubs; tussock-forming graminoids; cushion plants; and cryptogams, such as bryophytes and lichens.

Relative to lower elevation areas in the same region, alpine regions have a high rate of endemism and a high diversity of plant species. This taxonomic diversity can be attributed to geographical isolation, climate changes, glaciation, microhabitat differentiation, and different histories of migration or evolution or both. These phenomena contribute to plant diversity by introducing new flora and favoring adaptations, both of new species and the dispersal of pre-existing species.

Though tundra covers only a minority of the Earth&#x27;s surface (17-20%), the biodiversity of plant species is important to human nutrition. Of the 20 plant species that make up 80% of human food, 7 of them (35%) originated in this region. 
Plants have adapted to the harsh alpine environment. Cushion plants, looking like ground-hugging clumps of moss, escape the strong winds blowing a few inches above them. Many flowering plants of the alpine tundra have dense hairs on stems and leaves to provide wind protection or red-colored pigments capable of converting the sun&#x27;s light rays into heat. Some plants take two or more years to form flower buds, which survive the winter below the surface and then open and produce fruit with seeds in the few weeks of summer. In various areas of alpine tundra, woody plant encroachment is observed.

Alpine areas are unique because of the severity and complexity of their environmental conditions. Very small changes in topography – as small as 1 foot (0.3 m) or less – may mean the difference between a windswept area or an area of snow accumulation, changing the potential productivity and plant community drastically. Between these extremes of drought versus saturation, several intermediate environments may exist all within a few yards of each other, depending on topography, substrate, and climate. Alpine vegetation generally occurs in a mosaic of small patches with widely differing environmental conditions. Vegetation types vary from cushion and rosette plants on the ridges and in the rock crannies; to herbaceous and grassy vegetation along the slopes; dwarf shrubs with grasses and forbs below the melting snowdrifts; and sedges, grasses, low shrubs, and mosses in the bogs and along the brooks.
Alpine meadows form where sediments from the weathering of rocks has produced soils well-developed enough to support grasses and sedges. Non-flowering lichens cling to rocks and soil. Their enclosed algal cells can photosynthesize at any temperature above , and the outer fungal layers can absorb more than their own weight in water. The adaptations for survival of drying winds and cold may make tundra vegetation seem very hardy, but in some respects the tundra is very fragile. Repeated footsteps often destroy tundra plants, allowing exposed soil to blow away; recovery may take hundreds of years.

== Fauna ==

Because alpine tundra is located in various widely separated regions of the Earth, there is no animal species common to all areas of alpine tundra. Some animals of alpine tundra environments include the kea, marmot, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, chinchilla, Himalayan tahr, yak, snow leopard, and pika.

<doc id="203106" wikidata="Q19625" url="?curid=203106" title="Canine tooth">
<text>In mammalian oral anatomy, the canine teeth, also called cuspids, dogteeth, eye teeth, vampire teeth, or fangs, are the relatively long, pointed teeth. In the context of the upper jaw, they are also known as &quot;fangs&quot;. They can appear more flattened, however, causing them to resemble incisors and leading them to be called &quot;incisiform&quot;. They developed and are used primarily for firmly holding food in order to tear it apart, and occasionally as weapons. They are often the largest teeth in a mammal&#x27;s mouth. Individuals of most species that develop them normally have four, two in the upper jaw and two in the lower, separated within each jaw by incisors; humans and dogs are examples. In most species, canines are the anterior-most teeth in the maxillary bone. 
The four canines in humans are the two upper maxillary canines and the two lower mandibular canines.
They are specially prominent in dogs (Canidae), hence the name.

== Details ==

There are generally four canine teeth: two in the upper (maxillary) and two in the lower (mandibular) arch. A canine is placed laterally to (outside of) each lateral incisor and mesial to (inwards of) the premolars. They are larger and stronger than the incisors, and their roots sink deeply into the bones, causing well-marked prominences upon the surface. They are the only teeth in dentition with a single cusp, their crowns are roughly triangular from a mesial viewpoint and trapezoidal from a buccal viewpoint .

The crown is large and conical, very convex on its labial surface, a little hollowed and uneven on its lingual surface, and tapering to a blunted point or cusp, which projects beyond the level of the other teeth. The root is single, but longer and thicker than that of the incisors, conical in form, compressed laterally, and marked by a slight groove on each side. The lingual surface also presents two depressions on either side of the surface separated by a ridge in between; these depressions are known as mesial and distal lingual fossae.

=== Eruption ===
In humans, the upper canine teeth (popularly called eye teeth, from their position under the eyes) are larger and longer than the lower, and usually present a distinct basal ridge. Eruption typically occurs between the ages of eleven and twelve years for upper canines and between nine and ten years for lower canines. Upper deciduous canines also known as the baby tooth, typically erupt between the ages of sixteen and twenty-two months and shed between ten and twelve years. Lower deciduous canines typically erupt between the ages of seventeen and twenty-two months and shed between nine and twelve years.

=== Developmental defects ===
Transposition (positional interchange of two adjacent teeth) is a development defect that most commonly found in the permanent canine, with the maxillary being more commonly seen than mandibular. The upper canine frequently transposed with the first premolar whilst the lower canine transposed with the lateral incisor. Occasionally canines are congenitally missing.

=== Maxillary canine morphology ===
From a facial aspect, maxillary canines are approximately one millimetre narrower than the central incisor. Their mesial aspects resemble the adjacent lateral incisors, while their distal aspects anticipate the first premolars. They are slightly darker and more yellow in color than the other anterior teeth. From a lingual aspect, they have well-developed mesial and distal marginal ridges and a well-developed cingulum. A prominent lingual ridge divides the lingual aspect in half and creates the mesial and distal lingual fossae between the lingual ridge and the marginal ridges. From a proximal aspect, they resemble the incisors, but are more robust, especially in the cingulum region. Incisally, they are visibly asymmetrical, as the mesial incisal edge is slightly shorter than the distal incisal edge, which places the cusp slightly mesial to the long axis of the tooth. They are also thicker labiolingually than mesiodistally. Because of the disproportionate incisal edges, the contacts are also asymmetrical. Mesially, the contact sits at the junction of the incisal and middle third of the crown, while distally, the contact as more cervical, in the middle of the middle third of the crown. The root of the maxillary canines are the longest root of any tooth and conical in shape.

=== Mandibular canine morphology ===
The lower canine teeth are placed nearer the middle line than the upper, so that their summits correspond to the intervals between the upper canines and the lateral incisors. From a facial aspect, the mandibular canine is notably narrower mesiodistally than the maxillary one, the root is compressed mesiodistally with well-marked grooves on both sides and may be just as long as the maxillary (and at times bifurcated). A distinctive feature is the nearly straight outline this tooth has compared to the maxillary canine which is slightly more bowed. As in the maxillary canine, the mesial incisal edge (or cusp ridge) is shorter than the distal side, however, the cusp is displaced slightly lingual relative to the cusp of the maxillary canine.

Lingually, the surface of the tooth is much smoother compared to the very pronounced surface of the maxillary canine, and the cingulum is noted as less developed. The cusp may be lost with attrition over time and may resemble an upper second permanent incisor.

== Sexual dimorphism ==
In many species the canine teeth in the upper or lower jaw, or in both jaws, are much larger in males than in females, where they are sometimes hidden or completely absent. Animals where this occurs include antelopes, musk-deer, camels, horses, wild boar, some apes, seals, narwhal, and walrus. Male dogs have larger canines with different contour than do females.

Humans have the proportionately smallest male canine teeth among all anthropoids and exhibit relatively little sexual dimorphism in canine tooth size. It has been proposed that the receding canine teeth in human males was likely to be a result of sexual selection for less aggressive partners by female humans. The dimorphism is also similarly less pronounced in bonobos and chimpanzees.

==Non-synapsids==

In non-synapsids, such as reptiles and crocodiles, teeth similar to canines may be termed &quot;caniniform&quot; (&quot;canine-shaped&quot;) teeth. Teeth or appendages with similar appearances found in many snakes and invertebrates, such as spiders, are referred to as fangs, but are usually modified to inject venom.

<doc id="203107" wikidata="Q2468655" url="?curid=203107" title="The Terrible Old Man">
<text>&quot;The Terrible Old Man&quot; is a short story of fewer than 1200 words by American writer H. P. Lovecraft. It was written on January 28, 1920, and first published in the &quot;Tryout&quot;, an amateur press publication, in July 1921. It is notable as the first story to make use of Lovecraft&#x27;s imaginary New England setting, introducing the fictional town of Kingsport. The story, about the fate of three would-be robbers of the titular old man&#x27;s house, has been criticized by Peter Cannon for being an openly xenophobic polemic against immigration.

==Plot==
A strange old man, &quot;so old that no one can remember when he was young, and so taciturn that few know his real name,&quot; lives alone in an ancient house on Water Street in the town of Kingsport. Even among the locals, few know the details of the old man&#x27;s life, but it is believed that he in his youth captained East Indian clipper ships and accumulated great riches throughout his life. Those who had visited the property had seen bizarre collections of stones in the front yard and observed the old man carrying on conversations with mysterious bottles on his table, which make &quot;certain definite vibrations as if in answer.&quot; Most locals take care to avoid the man and his house.

Angelo Ricci, Joe Czanek and Manuel Silva, three robbers, learn about the old man&#x27;s supposed hoard of treasure and resolve to take it. Ricci and Silva go inside to &quot;interview&quot; the old man about the treasure, while Czanek waits outside in the getaway car. After waiting impatiently for a long time, Czanek is startled by an outburst of horrific screaming from the house but assumes that his colleagues have been too rough with the old man during their interrogation. However, the gate of the house opens, revealing the old man &quot;smiling hideously&quot; at him. For the first time, Czanek takes note of the man&#x27;s unsettling yellow eyes.

The mutilated bodies of the three robbers are later found by the seaside, &quot;horribly slashed as with many cutlasses, and horribly mangled as by the tread of many cruel boot-heels.&quot; The people of Kingsport talk about the discovery, as well as about the abandoned car and the screams heard in the night, but the old man shows no interest in their gossip.

==The Terrible Old Man character==
The Terrible Old Man reappears in the story &quot;The Strange High House in the Mist&quot; in a more benevolent role. He further elaborates on the origin of the Strange High House, mentioning that the house was old when his own grandfather had been a boy. Given the Old Man&#x27;s own implied longevity, the house must date to the very early days of colonial America.

He has a number of similarities with later characters created by Lovecraft, in particular Joseph Curwen, the villain of &quot;The Case of Charles Dexter Ward&quot;: Both were improbably old, such that no one remembered when they were young; possessed vaguely defined but powerful abilities oriented around storing the dead in peculiar objects and calling them forth to serve them; and had access to ancient coinage of precious metals (as do the Whateleys in &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;).

==Reception==
Lovecraft scholar Peter Cannon describes the story as &quot;little more than a polemic against the intrusion of people Lovecraft regarded as &#x27;foreigners&#x27;, that is, the non-English immigrants who arrived in the nineteenth century as cheap labor to fill the factories of an increasingly industrialized America.&quot; S. T. Joshi identified the story as having been inspired by Lord Dunsany&#x27;s short story &quot;Probable Adventure of the Three Literary Men&quot;. Joshi wrote that modern critics have &quot;tried to deny the racism seemingly evident in the tale&quot;, but Lovecraft takes obvious satisfaction in killing off the criminal immigrants.

==Other media==
The short story was adapted into a free point and click adventure game of the same name released for Windows and Android in 2015 by Cloak and Dagger Games. The game follows the plot of the short story, with players controlling Joe Czanek during the night of the attempted robbery, and features the ending text from the short story at its conclusion.

<text>Sunnyodon is a genus of tiny, extinct mammal, probably of the Lower Cretaceous. Found in what is now southern England and Denmark, it was a relatively early member of the extinct order of Multituberculata. It is part of the suborder Plagiaulacida and family Paulchoffatiidae.

The genus &quot;Sunnyodon&quot; (meaning &quot;Sunny tooth&quot;, after Sunnydown Farm) was named by Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska and Ensom P.C. in 1992 based on a single specimen.

Fossil remains of the species &quot;Sunnyodon notleyi&quot; Lower Cretaceous-age strata of the Lulworth Formation in Durlston Bay, Dorset, England and the Rabekke Formation in Denmark. This is a tooth-based species.

A tooth from the Danish island of Bornholm was assigned to &quot;Sunnyodon&quot; in 2004. It is the first fossil of a Mesozoic mammal found in Scandinavia. A tooth has also been assigned to &quot;Sunnyodon&quot; from the Berriasian aged Angeac-Charente bonebed in France.

<doc id="203109" wikidata="Q622896" url="?curid=203109" title="Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests">
<text>Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest is a temperate climate terrestrial habitat type defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature, with broadleaf tree ecoregions, and with conifer and broadleaf tree mixed coniferous forest ecoregions. 

These forests are richest and most distinctive in central China and eastern North America, with some other globally distinctive ecoregions in the Himalayas, Western and Central Europe, the southern coast of the Black Sea, Australasia, Southwestern South America and the Russian Far East.

==Ecology==
The typical structure of these forests includes four layers.
* The uppermost layer is the canopy composed of tall mature trees ranging from high. Below the canopy is the three-layered, shade-tolerant understory that is roughly shorter than the canopy. 
* The top layer of the understory is the sub-canopy composed of smaller mature trees, saplings, and suppressed juvenile canopy layer trees awaiting an opening in the canopy. 
* Below the sub-canopy is the shrub layer, composed of low growing woody plants. 
* Typically the lowest growing (and most diverse) layer is the ground cover or herbaceous layer.

==Trees==
In the Northern hemisphere, characteristic dominant broadleaf trees in this biome include oaks (&quot;Quercus&quot; spp.), beeches (&quot;Fagus&quot; spp.), maples (&quot;Acer&quot; spp.), or birches (&quot;Betula&quot; spp.). The term &quot;mixed forest&quot; comes from the inclusion of coniferous trees as a canopy component of some of these forests. Typical coniferous trees include pines (&quot;Pinus&quot; spp.), firs (&quot;Abies&quot; spp.), and spruces (&quot;Picea&quot; spp.). In some areas of this biome, the conifers may be a more important canopy species than the broadleaf species. In the Southern Hemisphere, endemic genera such as &quot;Nothofagus&quot; and &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; occupy this biome, and most coniferous trees (members of the Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae) occur in mixtures with broadleaf species, and are classed as broadleaf and mixed forests.

==Climate==
Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests occur in areas with distinct warm and cool seasons, including climates such as humid continental, humid subtropical, and oceanic, that give them moderate annual average temperatures: . These forests occur in relatively warm and rainy climates, sometimes also with a distinct dry season. A dry season occurs in the winter in East Asia and in summer on the wet fringe of the Mediterranean climate zones. Other areas, such as central eastern North America, have a fairly even distribution of rainfall; annual rainfall is typically over and often over , though it can go as low as in some parts of the Middle East and close to in the mountains of New Zealand and the Azores. Temperatures are typically moderate except in parts of Asia such as Ussuriland, or the Upper Midwest, where temperate forests can occur despite very harsh conditions with very cold winters.

The climates are typically humid for much of the year, usually appearing in the humid subtropical climate and in the humid continental climate zones to the south of tundra and the generally subarctic taiga. In the Köppen climate classification they are represented respectively by &quot;Cfa&quot;, &quot;Dfa/Dfb&quot; southern range and &quot;Cfb&quot;, and more rarely, &quot;Csb&quot;, &quot;BSk&quot; and &quot;Csa&quot;.

<text>Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests are a tropical forest habitat type defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature. These forests are found predominantly in North and Central America and experience low levels of precipitation and moderate variability in temperature. Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests are characterized by diverse species of conifers, whose needles are adapted to deal with the variable climatic conditions. Most tropical and subtropical coniferous forest ecoregions are found in the Nearctic and Neotropical realms, from Mexico to Nicaragua and on the Greater Antilles, Bahamas, and Bermuda. Other tropical and subtropical coniferous forests ecoregions occur in Asia. Mexico harbors the world&#x27;s richest and most complex subtropical coniferous forests. The conifer forests of the Greater Antilles contain many endemics and relictual taxa. 

Many migratory birds and butterflies spend winter in tropical and subtropical conifer forests. This biome features a thick, closed canopy which blocks light to the floor and allows little underbrush. As a result, the ground is often covered with fungi and ferns. Shrubs and small trees compose a diverse understory.

<doc id="203112" wikidata="Q983131" url="?curid=203112" title="Thomas Roe">
<text>Sir Thomas Roe ( 1581 – 6 November 1644) was an English diplomat of the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods. Roe&#x27;s voyages ranged from Central America to India; as ambassador, he represented England in the Mughal Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Holy Roman Empire. He held a seat in the House of Commons at various times between 1614 and 1644. Roe was an accomplished scholar and a patron of learning.

==Life==

Roe was born at Low Leyton near Wanstead in Essex, the son of Sir Robert Rowe of Gloucestershire and Cranford, Middlesex, and his wife Elinor Jermy, daughter of Robert Jermy of Worstead, Norfolk. He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 6 July 1593, at the age of twelve. In 1597 he entered Middle Temple and became esquire of the body to Queen Elizabeth I of England. He was knighted by James I on 23 July 1604, and became friendly with Henry, Prince of Wales, and also with Henry&#x27;s sister Elizabeth, afterwards briefly Queen of Bohemia, with whom he maintained a correspondence and whose cause he championed.

Sir Thomas Roe died in 1644 at the age of about 63. He was buried in the parish church of St. Mary in Woodford, London.

===Family===
Roe married Eleanor, Lady Beeston, the young widowed daughter of Sir Thomas Cave of Stanford-on-Avon, Northamptonshire in 1614, just weeks before embarking for India. Eleanor did not go to India, but did accompany Roe on the subsequent embassy to Constantinople. The couple were childless and adopted Jane Rupa, an orphaned girl introduced by Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia. When Eleanor died in 1675 she was buried alongside him in the parish church of St. Mary, Woodford.

==Career==
===Amazon explorer===

In 1610, Roe was sent by Prince Henry on a mission to the West Indies, during which he visited Guiana and the Amazon River. He tried to reach the Lake Parime location of the fabled El Dorado, that was represented in the map of Thomas Harriot in 1596. However, he failed then, and in two subsequent expeditions, to discover the gold he was seeking.

===Ambassador to the Mughal Empire===
In 1614, Roe was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Tamworth.

The East India Company persuaded King James to send Roe as a royal envoy to the Agra court of the Great Mughal Emperor, Jahangir. Roe resided at Agra for three years, until 1619. At the Mughal court, Roe allegedly became a favourite of Jahangir and may have been his drinking partner; certainly he arrived with gifts of &quot;many crates of red wine&quot; and explained to him &quot;What beere was? How made?&quot;

The immediate result of the mission was to obtain permission and protection for an East India Company factory at Surat. While no major trading privileges were conceded by Jahingir, &quot;Roe&#x27;s mission was the beginning of a Mughal-Company relationship that would develop into something approaching a partnership and see the said Company gradually drawn into the Mughal nexus&quot;.

While Roe&#x27;s detailed journals are a valuable source of information on Jahangir&#x27;s reign, the Emperor did not return the favour, with no mention of Roe in his own voluminous diaries.
===Indian Ocean and East African coast===

Prior to his arrival at the Mughal court, Roe explored the Eastern African islands and coastlines of the Indian Ocean, where he met the Somali navigator and ship pilot Maalim Ibrahim at one of the Islands of the Comoros in 1615. The latter influenced Roe’s cartographic knowledge of the Indian Ocean through his map which Roe summarised as a “graduated map of high quality” drawn on parchment and as a result began adjusting his own. Maalim invited Roe to visit the city of Mogadishu, which at the time was the richest on the East African coast, and despite Roe appreciating the invitation, he could not split up the fleet heading for the Mughal Empire.

===Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire===
In 1621, Roe was elected MP for Cirencester.

Roe received diplomatic credentials to the Ottoman Empire on 6 September, arriving at Constantinople in December. In this role, he obtained an extension of the privileges of the English merchants. He concluded a treaty with Algiers in 1624, by which he secured the liberation of several hundred English captives. He also gained the support, by an English subsidy, of the Transylvanian Prince Gabriel Bethlen for the European Protestant alliance and the cause of the Palatinate.

Through his friendship with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Cyril Lucaris, the famous &quot;Codex Alexandrinus&quot; was presented to James I, and Roe himself collected several valuable manuscripts which he subsequently presented to the Bodleian Library. 29 Greek and other manuscripts, including an original copy of the synodal epistles of the council of Basle, he presented in 1628 to the Bodleian Library, after his letters of appointment had been revoked on 26 October 1627. But Roe did not leave the Porte until June 1628. A collection of 242 coins was given by his widow, at his desire, to the Bodleian Library after his death. He also searched for Greek marbles on behalf of the Duke of Buckingham and the second Earl of Arundel.

===Diplomat in the Thirty Years&#x27; War===
In 1629, Roe was successful in another mission undertaken, to arrange a peace between Sweden and Poland. In so doing, he enabled Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden to intervene decisively in the Thirty Years&#x27; War on the side of the Protestant German princes. Roe also negotiated treaties with Danzig and Denmark. A gold medal was struck in his honour on his return home in 1630 after attending the Diet of Regensburg.

===Sponsor of Arctic exploration===
In 1631, he sponsored the Arctic exploration of Luke Fox. Roes Welcome Sound was named in his honor.

===English statesman and envoy===
In January 1637, Roe was appointed Chancellor of the Order of the Garter, with a pension of £1200 a year.

In June 1640, Roe was made a privy councillor. In November of that year he was elected MP for Oxford University in the Long Parliament. 
He was appointed as England&#x27;s ambassador to the Holy Roman Empire from 1641 to 1642. He took part in the peace conferences at Hamburg, Regensburg and Vienna, and used his influence to obtain the restoration of the Palatinate, the emperor declaring that he had &quot;scarce ever met with an ambassador till now.&quot;

==Works==

* The Embassy of Sir Thomas Roe to the Court of the Great Mogul, 1615–1619, as narrated in his journal and correspondence 
His &quot;Embassy of Sir Thomas Roe to the Court of the Great Mogul, 1615-1619, as narrated in his journal and correspondence&quot;, several times printed, has been re-edited, with an introduction by William Foster, for the Hakluyt Society (1899). This is a valuable contribution to the history of India in the early 17th century.
* Negotiations in his Embassy to the Ottoman Porte, 1621–28, vol. i
&quot;Vol. i&quot;. was published in 1740, but the work was not continued. Other correspondence, consisting of letters relating to his mission to Gustavus Adolphus, was edited by SR Gardiner for the &quot;Camden Society Miscellany&quot; (1875), vol. vii., and his correspondence with Lord Carew in 1615 and 1617 by Sir F. Maclean for the same society in 1860.
* True and Faithful Relation ... concerning the Death of Sultan Osman ... (1622)
Several of his manuscripts are in the British Museum collections. Roe published a &quot;True and Faithful Relation ... concerning the Death of Sultan Osman ...&quot;, 1622; a translation from Paolo Sarpi,
* Discourse upon the Resolution taken in the Valteline (1628); and in 1613 Dr T Wright published &quot;Quatuor Colloquia&quot;, consisting of theological disputations between himself and Roe; a poem by Roe is printed in &quot;Notes and Queries, iv. Ser. v. 9&quot;.
* The Swedish Intelligencer (1632–33), including an account of the career of Gustavus Adolphus and of the Diet of Ratisbon (Regensburg), is attributed to Roe in the catalogue of the British Museum. Several of his speeches, chiefly on currency and financial questions, were also published. Two other works in manuscripts are mentioned by Wood: &quot;Compendious Relation of the Proceedings ... of the Imperial Diet at Ratisbon &quot;and &quot;Journal of Several Proceedings of the Order of the Garter&quot;.

<doc id="203113" wikidata="Q511668" url="?curid=203113" title="Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests">
<text>The tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forest is a habitat type defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature and is located at tropical and subtropical latitudes. Though these forests occur in climates that are warm year-round, and may receive several hundred millimeters of rain per year, they have long dry seasons that last several months and vary with geographic location. These seasonal droughts have great impact on all living things in the forest.

Deciduous trees predominate in most of these forests, and during the drought a leafless period occurs, which varies with species type. Because trees lose moisture through their leaves, the shedding of leaves allows trees such as teak and mountain ebony to conserve water during dry periods. The newly bare trees open up the canopy layer, enabling sunlight to reach ground level and facilitate the growth of thick underbrush. Trees on moister sites and those with access to ground water tend to be evergreen. Infertile sites also tend to support evergreen trees. Three tropical dry forest ecoregions, the East Deccan dry evergreen forests, the Sri Lanka dry-zone dry evergreen forests, and the Southeastern Indochina dry evergreen forests, are characterized by evergreen trees.

Though less biologically diverse than rainforests, tropical dry forests are home to a wide variety of wildlife including monkeys, deer, large cats, parrots, various rodents, and ground dwelling birds. Mammalian biomass tends to be higher in dry forests than in rain forests, especially in Asian and African dry forests. Many of these species display extraordinary adaptations to the difficult climate.

This biome is alternately known as the tropical and subtropical dry forest biome or the tropical and subtropical deciduous forest biome.

==Geographical variation==
Dry forests tend to exist in the drier areas north and south of the tropical rainforest belt, south or north of the subtropical deserts, generally in two bands: one between 10° and 20°N latitude and the other between 10° and 20°S latitude. The most diverse dry forests in the world occur in western and southern Mexico and in the Bolivian lowlands. The dry forests of the Pacific Coast of northwestern South America support a wealth of unique species due to their dry climate. The Maputaland-Pondoland bushland and thickets along the east coast of South Africa are diverse and support many endemic species. The dry forests of central India and Indochina are notable for their diverse large vertebrate faunas. Madagascar dry deciduous forests and New Caledonia dry forests are also highly distinctive (pronounced endemism and a large number of relictual taxa) for a wide range of taxa and at higher taxonomic levels. Trees use underground water during the dry seasons.

==Biodiversity patterns and requirements==

Species tend to have wider ranges than moist forest species, although in some regions many species do display highly restricted ranges; most dry forest species are restricted to tropical dry forests, particularly in plants; beta diversity and alpha diversity high but typically lower than adjacent moist forests.

Effective conservation of dry broadleaf forests requires the preservation of large and continuous areas of forest. Large natural areas are required to maintain larger predators and other vertebrates, and to buffer sensitive species from hunting pressure. The persistence of riparian forests and water sources is critical for many dry forest species. Large swathes of intact forest are required to allow species to recover from occasional large events, like forest fires.

Dry forests are highly sensitive to excessive burning and deforestation; overgrazing and invasive species can also quickly alter natural communities; restoration is possible but challenging, particularly if degradation has been intense and persistent.

<text>Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests (TSMF), also known as tropical moist forest, is a subtropical and tropical forest habitat type defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

== Description ==

TSMF is generally found in large, discontinuous patches centered on the equatorial belt and between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn. TSMF are characterized by low variability in annual temperature and high levels of rainfall of more than annually. Forest composition is dominated by evergreen and semi-deciduous tree species.

These forests are home to more species than any other terrestrial ecosystem on Earth: Half of the world&#x27;s species may live in these forests, where a square kilometer may be home to more than 1,000 tree species. These forests are found around the world, particularly in the Indo-Malayan Archipelago, the Amazon Basin, and the African Congo Basin.

The perpetually warm, wet climate makes these environments more productive than any other terrestrial environment on Earth and promotes explosive plant growth. A tree here may grow over in height in just 5 years. From above, the forest appears as an unending sea of green, broken only by occasional, taller &quot;emergent&quot; trees. These towering emergents are the realm of hornbills, toucans, and the harpy eagle.

Generally, biodiversity is highest in the forest canopy. The canopy can be divided into five layers: overstory canopy with emergent crowns, a medium layer of canopy, lower canopy, shrub level, and finally understory.

The canopy is home to many of the forest&#x27;s animals, including apes and monkeys. Below the canopy, a lower understory hosts snakes and big cats. The forest floor, relatively clear of undergrowth due to the thick canopy above, is stalked by other animals such as gorillas and deer.

All levels of these forests contain an unparalleled diversity of invertebrate species, including New Guinea&#x27;s stick insects and butterflies that can grow over in length.

Many forests are being cleared for farmland, while others are subject to large-scale commercial logging. An area the size of Ireland is destroyed every few years.

== Types ==

The biome includes several types of forests:
* Lowland equatorial evergreen rain forests, commonly known as tropical rainforests, are forests which receive high rainfall (tropical rainforest climate with more than 2000 mm, or 80 inches, annually) throughout the year. These forests occur in a belt around the equator, with the largest areas in the Amazon basin of South America, the Congo Basin of central Africa, the Wet Tropics of Queensland in Australia and parts of the Malay Archipelago. About half of the world&#x27;s tropical rainforests are in the South American countries of Brazil and Peru. Rainforests now cover less than 6% of Earth&#x27;s land surface. Scientists estimate that more than half of all the world&#x27;s plant and animal species live in tropical rainforests.
* Tropical seasonal forests, also known as moist deciduous, monsoon or semi-evergreen (mixed) seasonal forests, have a monsoon or wet savannah climates (as in the Köppen climate classification): receiving high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and (often) a cooler winter dry season. Some trees in these forests drop some or all of their leaves during the winter dry season. These forests are found in South Florida, parts of South America, in Central America and around the Caribbean, in coastal West Africa, parts of the Indian subcontinent, Northern Australia and across much of Indochina.
* Montane rain forests are found in cooler-climate mountainous areas. Those with elevations high enough to regularly encounter low-level cloud cover are known as cloud forests.
* Flooded forests, including freshwater swamp forests and peat swamp forests.
* Manigua a low, often impenetrable dense forest of tangled tropical shrub and small trees. It is usually found in marshy areas but also on dry land in certain places. The term is used in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Colombia.

<text>Vulpes is a genus of the sub-family Caninae. The members of this genus are colloquially referred to as true foxes, meaning they form a proper clade. The word &quot;fox&quot; occurs in the common names of all species of the genus, but also appears in the common names of other canid species. True foxes are distinguished from members of the genus &quot;Canis&quot;, such as domesticated dogs, wolves, jackals and coyotes, by their smaller size (5–11 kg), longer, bushier tail, and flatter skull. They have black, triangular markings between their eyes and nose, and the tip of their tail is often a different color from the rest of their pelt. The typical lifespan for this genus is between two and four years, but can reach up to a decade.

==Extant species==
Within &quot;Vulpes&quot;, 12 separate extant species and four fossil species are described:

==Early history==

The oldest known fossil species within &quot;Vulpes&quot; is &quot;V. riffautae&quot;, dating back to the late Miocene of Chad, which is within the Neogene. The deposits where these fossils are found are about 7 million years old, which might make them the earliest Canidae in the Old World. They are estimated to have weighed between 1.5 and 3.5 lb. &quot;V. skinneri&quot;, from the Malapa Fossil Site from South Africa, is younger than &quot;V. riffautae&quot; by roughly 5 million years, and shows up in the early Pleistocene.

Two other extinct, less documented fossils are known: &quot;V. praeglacialis&quot; and &quot;V. hassani&quot;. &quot;V. praeglacialis&quot; was discovered in the Petralona Cave in Chalkidiki, Greece. The age of the deposits (Early Pleistocene) makes it the earliest occurrence of &quot;Vulpes&quot; in Europe. &quot;V. hassani&quot; is found in a Miocene-Pliocene deposit in northwestern Africa. This species may have given rise to current Rüppell&#x27;s fox, which lends support that the close phylogenetic clustering of Rüppels and Red foxes is the result of recent introgressive hybridization rather than recent speciation.

In the Pleistocene, &quot;Vulpes&quot; had a fairly wide distribution, with eight species found in North America. Of these eight, six are not fossil, and three species still remain in North America (&quot;V. velox&quot;, &quot;V. macrotis&quot;, and &quot;V. vulpes&quot;). The remaining three moved on to sections of Africa over time. &quot;V. stenognathus&quot; is extinct, but has extant sister taxa including &quot;V. chama&quot;, &quot;V. rueppellii&quot;, &quot;V. velox&quot;, and &quot;V. vulpes&quot;, which fits with these species all evolving together in North America.

==Description==

True foxes are small to medium-sized animals, usually smaller than other canines, such as wolves, dogs, and jackals. For example, the largest species, the red fox, weighs on average 4.1–8.7 kg and the smallest species, the fennec fox, weighs only 0.7–1.6 kg. They have long, dense fur, and a bushy, rounded tail that is at least half as long, or fully as long as, the head and body. They have a rather long body with shorter limbs, a long, narrow muzzle, and large, pointed ears. The forelimbs have five toes, while the hind legs have only four. The skull is light and slender, elongated. Sagittal crest not developed at all or weakly defined.

&quot;Vulpes&quot; species have vertically slit pupils, which generally appear elliptical in strong light like those of cats, which provide them with significant advantages. Like most canids, true foxes have a muscular body, powerful jaws, and teeth for grasping prey. Blunt claws are especially useful for gripping the ground while tracking down their prey. Some species have a pungent &quot;foxy&quot; odor, arising mainly from a gland located on the dorsal surface of the tail, not far from its base. Not much sexual dimorphism is displayed, although males are slightly larger.

In general, &quot;Vulpes&quot; has a bone structure very close to that of its canid relatives, but there are some variations. For example, although canid limbs are designed specifically for running quickly on land to catch prey, &quot;Vulpes&quot; species avoid rapid sprints, excluding when being chased, and have become more specialized for leaping and grasping prey. In &quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;, for example, the adaptions for leaping, grasping, and climbing include the lengthening of hind limbs in relation to fore limbs, as well as overall slenderizing of both hind and fore limbs. Muscles are also emphasized along the axis of limbs.

The length, color and density of the fur of fox species differ. Fennec foxes (and other desert-adapted fox species such as &quot;Vulpes macrotis&quot;) have large ears and a short coat to keep the body cool. On the other hand, the Arctic fox has small ears and a thick, insulating coat to keep the body warm. A solid color coat is seen in most animals, but there are occasions where the coat color varies over the year to enhance camouflage against the current seasons landscape. The red fox, Ruppell&#x27;s fox, and Tibetan sand fox possess white-tipped tails. The Arctic fox&#x27;s tail-tip is of the same color as the rest of the tail (white or blue-gray). Blanford&#x27;s fox usually possesses a black-tipped tail, but a small number of specimens (2% in Israel, 24% in the United Arab Emirates) possess a light-tipped tail. The other foxes in this group (Bengal, Cape, corsac, fennec, kit, pale, and swift) all possess black-tipped or dark-tipped tails.

==Distribution and habitat==
The range of the genus is very wide, present in a wide variety of habitats, from the desert to the Arctic, and from high altitudes in the mountains to open plains. True foxes are opportunistic and thrive anywhere they can find food and shelter. They are also widespread in suburban and urban areas, where they can take advantage of human food supplies; however, they prefer to stay away from large industrial areas. In certain areas, foxes tend to do better where humans are present, including in many agricultural landscapes, forests and patchy woodlands.

==Behavior and ecology==
Most true foxes are nocturnal, but they can be active during the morning and dusk and occasionally hunt and scavenge in daylight during winter. Many fox species are solitary or nomadic, living most of their lives on their own, except for the mating season, when they have a monogamous relationship with a partner. Some live in small family groups, others are more gregarious.

&quot;Vulpes&quot; have a high variation in social organization between species and populations. Their hierarchical society usually depends on population densities. As population density increases, there is also an increase in the formation of social groups. These groups consist of one dominant pair and a few other subordinate adults that tend to be related. Dominance is established within the den, and dominant kits have usually more access to food and often hold higher social status. If a dispute occurs, dominance is determined by fighting, and the loser may be rejected from its group. These social groups can consist of up to ten adults. Cape foxes likely have a matriarchal social organization.

===Diet===
This genus is omnivorous and prone to scavenging. The foods of choice for &quot;Vulpes&quot; consist of invertebrates, a variety of small vertebrates, grasses, and some angiosperms. The typical intake per day is about 1 kg. True foxes exhibit hoarding behavior or caching where they store away food for another day out of sight from other animals.

===Predators===
Adult foxes have very few predators except coyotes, bears, and wolves, depending on the location. Juvenile foxes face a wider range of threats from small carnivores and large birds of prey, such as eagles.

===Reproduction===
Most true foxes are monogamous. However, they can form polyandrous and polygynous pairs. Breeding season varies between species and habitat, but they generally breed between late December and late March. Most foxes dig out dens to provide a safe underground space for raising their young. Born deaf and blind, kits or cubs require their mother&#x27;s milk and complete supervision for the first four to five weeks out of the womb, but begin to be progressively weaned after the first month. Once fully weaned, kits seek out various insects. The parents supplement this diet with a variety of mammals and birds. During early to middle July, the kits are able to hunt on their own and soon move away from their parents.

==Relationship with humans==
===Domestication===

The silver fox is a melanistic form of the wild red fox. Though rare, domestication has been documented in silver foxes. The most notable experiment was conducted in Novosibirsk, Russia, at the Siberian Institute of Cytology and Genetics. In this study, generations of silver foxes were divided into those with friendly traits and those with unfriendly traits. After 50 years, the friendly foxes developed “dog-like” domesticated traits such as spots, tail wagging, enjoyment of human touch, and barking.

===Fox hunting ===

Fox hunting was started in the United Kingdom in the 16th century that involves tracking, chasing, and killing a fox with the aid of foxhounds and horses. It has since then spread to Europe, the United States, and Australia.

<text>The red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio) is a carnivorous passerine bird and member of the shrike family, Laniidae. Its breeding range stretches from Western Europe east to central Russia. It is migratory and winters in the eastern areas of tropical Africa and southern Africa.

==Taxonomy==
The red-backed shrike was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current binomial name &quot;Lanius collurio&quot;. The genus name, &quot;Lanius&quot;, is derived from the Latin word for &quot;butcher&quot;, and some shrikes are also known as &quot;butcher birds&quot; because of their feeding habits. The specific &quot;collurio&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;kollurion&quot;, a bird mentioned by Aristotle. The common English name &quot;shrike&quot; is from Middle English &quot;*schrike&quot;, &quot;*schryke&quot;, from Old English &quot;sċrīc&quot;, &quot;shriek&quot;, from the same root as &quot;shriek&quot; and &quot;screech&quot;, referring to the bird&#x27;s shrill cry or call.

==Description==
This migratory bird eats large insects, small birds, frogs, rodents and lizards. Like other shrikes it hunts from prominent perches, and impales corpses on thorns or barbed wire as a &quot;larder.&quot; This practice has earned it the nickname of &quot;butcher bird.&quot;

The general colour of the male&#x27;s upper parts is reddish. It has a grey head and a typical shrike black stripe through the eye. Underparts are tinged pink, and the tail has a black and white pattern similar to that of a wheatear. In the female and young birds the upperparts are brown and vermiculated. Underparts are buff and also vermiculated.

==Distribution and habitat==
This bird breeds in most of Europe and western Asia and winters in tropical Africa. The bird is listed as a &quot;least concern&quot; (LC) species on a global scale, but some parts of its range have seen a steep decline in numbers, so locally its status can be less secure.

===Great Britain===
Once a common migratory visitor to Great Britain, numbers declined sharply during the 20th century, and it is now classified as a UK &#x27;Red List&#x27; species. The bird&#x27;s last stronghold was in Breckland but by 1988 just a single pair remained, successfully raising young at Santon Downham. The following year for the first time no nests were recorded in the UK. But since then sporadic breeding has taken place, mostly in Scotland and Wales. In September 2010 the RSPB announced that a pair had raised chicks at a secret location on Dartmoor where the bird last bred in 1970. In 2011, two pairs nested in the same locality, fledging seven young. In 2012 there was another breeding attempt, this time unsuccessful, probably due to a prolonged spell of wet weather. In 2013 breeding was again confirmed in Devon, with two young fledged at a new site. The return to south-western England was an unexpected development, raising speculation that a warming climate might assist the bird in re-colonising some of its former haunts. However, since then breeding has been confirmed on only two occasions, both in Shetland, in 2015 and 2020.

<doc id="203137" wikidata="Q4679420" url="?curid=203137" title="Adam Loftus, 1st Viscount Loftus">
<text>Adam Loftus, 1st Viscount Loftus (c. 1568–1643), was Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1619 and from 1622 raised to the peerage of Ireland as Viscount Loftus of Ely, King&#x27;s County. His uncle, another Adam Loftus, was both Lord Chancellor of Ireland and Church of Ireland primate.

Lord Loftus clashed with the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Viscount Falkland, in 1624; and in the late 1630s his quarrel with Falkland&#x27;s successor, The 1st Viscount Wentworth, was even fiercer. Lord Wentworth was created The 1st Earl of Strafford in January 1640. One of the principal articles of the then Lord Strafford&#x27;s impeachment in 1641, which led to his attainder and execution for treason, was based on his alleged mistreatment of Lord Loftus.

==Early life==
Loftus was the second son of Robert Loftus; little is known of his mother. His grandfather was Edward Loftus of Swineside, of the parish of Coverham, Yorkshire. In or about 1592, his uncle Adam Loftus, Lord Chancellor of Ireland and Archbishop of Dublin, who knew how to look after his own family, bestowed upon his nephew a prebend of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin, without a cure of souls. The young man was then in holy (or perhaps only deacon&#x27;s) orders, and had been for three or four years a Master of Arts, probably of the University of Cambridge. Two years later he held the archdeaconry of Glendalough, and on 17 September 1597, he was made judge of the Irish Marshal&#x27;s Court. The patent calls him Bachelor of Civil Law, and notes his good knowledge therein.

==Career==

During the Elizabethan wars in Ireland martial law was commonly imposed, and the object of Loftus&#x27;s appointment as judge of the Irish Marshal&#x27;s Court was to secure that its decrees should be &quot;orderly and judiciously examined and determined&quot;. He was the only holder of this office, which became obsolete in the next reign. Loftus afterwards complained that his ill-paid duties as a judge had obliged him to abandon a lucrative practice in the ecclesiastical courts.

On 8 November 1598 he was made a master in chancery, and a year later he obtained an interest in lands leased by his uncle with the consent of the chapters of St. Patrick&#x27;s and Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin. In 1604 the archbishop officially described his nephew, a professor of civil law and his own vicar-general, as archdeacon of Glendalough Cathedral, and as keeping a competent vicar to perform the parochial duties attached. The archdeacon was soon afterwards knighted. Later, Archbishop Laud protested strongly against this arrangement, but Loftus kept Glendalough until his death.

In 1607 he seems to have gone to England; on 21 March Archbishop Jones, whose chancellor he then was, recommended him strongly to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, then the dominant figure in the English Government. Three months later he obtained a lifetime annuity of £219. Early in 1608, Loftus was made a member of the Irish Privy Council. He seems to have worked well with Lord-Deputy Chichester, who praised his conduct in the marshal&#x27;s court. In 1610 he had a bitter dispute with Lord Thomond, which Salisbury decided against him. In 1611 he became constable of Maryborough, Queen&#x27;s County, which was already a virtual sinecure.

Loftus was returned, along with Sir Francis Rushe, as MP for King&#x27;s County in the Irish Parliament of 1613, more apparently by the act of the sheriff than by the choice of the freeholders, and he was one of the Protestant majority who made Sir John Davies Speaker of the House of Commons, over the vehement objections of the Catholic minority, who had voted for Sir John Everard. In the following year, he had a grant of forfeited lands in Wexford.

==Lord Chancellor of Ireland==

In the summer of 1618, Loftus went to England, carrying with him a commendatory letter from Lord-Deputy St. John and his Council, and in the following year, he was made one of the Commissioners of the Court of Wards. Thomas Jones, Archbishop of Dublin, died on 10 April 1619, and on the 23rd Loftus was appointed Lord Chancellor in his stead.

===Clash with Lord Falkland===

On the recall of St. John in May 1622, Loftus was appointed Lord Justice of Ireland and he was at the same time created Viscount Loftus of Ely. In the privy seal directing this creation James I said he had bestowed this hereditary honour on him &quot;that his virtues may be recorded to future ages, so long as there shall remain an heir male to his house&quot;. As Lord Chancellor, Loftus was included in the commissions which inquired into the state of the Church and completed the Ulster settlement. With St. John he had always agreed well, and he was at first on good terms with the new Lord Deputy, Henry Cary, 1st Viscount Falkland, but by 1624 they were at open war. The Chancellor refused to affix the Great Seal of Ireland to certain licenses for tanning and distilling, but offered to submit their legality to the decision of the judges. Falkland, as the King&#x27;s representative, claimed that he had in practice the power to overrule all legal objections, as Strafford was to do after him. The dispute lasted long, Loftus complaining bitterly that his thirty years&#x27; service was despised, that his dues were not paid, and that he had but £300 a year to support the dignity of his great place. These complaints appeared well founded, and half the fines of chancery writs were granted to him in 1625.

The accession of Charles I made no difference to the bad relations between Falkland and his Chancellor, and in May 1627 the latter was summoned to England, the Great Seal being placed in commission. After a long inquiry Charles I declared Loftus quite innocent of all charges made against him as a judge, and in May 1628 Falkland was ordered to reinstate him fully, and to treat him with the respect due to himself and to his office. In 1629 the King granted Loftus the unusual favour of a general license to visit England when he pleased, leaving the Great Seal in the hands of the commissioners last appointed, of whom his cousin, Sir Adam Loftus of Rathfarnham was one. Falkland left Ireland in August 1629, and the Chancellor became for the second time Lord Justice of Ireland along with Sir Richard Boyle, afterwards Earl of Cork. In 1632 Loftus took an active part in forcing William Newman, afterwards his chaplain, upon Trinity College Dublin as a fellow.

==Clash with Wentworth==

Lord Falkland&#x27;s successor, The 1st Viscount Wentworth, did not reach Ireland until the summer of 1633, but Loftus wrote him a congratulatory letter as soon as his appointment was known. He thanked him for some former services, deplored his own differences with Falkland, and promised to deserve the favour of one &quot;whose fame had outrun his presence&quot;. When Lord Wentworth arrived he had to deal with a Lord Chancellor who had been acting Viceroy for four years. Until 1636, the two men seem to have got on pretty well together; however, on 23 April of that year, Wentworth wrote to Bishop Bramhall of Loftus and of &quot;that fury his lady&quot; (Sarah Barlow) in disparaging terms.

Lord Wentworth now accused Lord Loftus of a variety of corrupt or at the least irregular practices, including hearing cases at his private residence, rather than in open Court (although Wentworth sometimes did this himself, and the practice could be defended on the grounds of convenience and saving of costs). More seriously, Loftus was accused of never giving judgment except in return for a bribe.

Wentworth&#x27;s first attack was indirect: Loftus&#x27;s second son Edward was accused of corruption in administering the estate of one Metcalfe. Edward prudently left the country, much to Wentworth&#x27;s fury; Wentworth insisted on his return to Ireland (that he could enforce such a demand is a sign of his power). Edward was forced to apologise for his defiance of the Lord Deputy, and was briefly imprisoned.

Wentworth then moved directly against Loftus in the Lord Deputy&#x27;s own prerogative court, the Court of Castle Chamber, the Irish equivalent of Star Chamber. He evidently reasoned that Loftus, despite his legal training, would be at a disadvantage in Castle Chamber, since Wentworth could simply overrule Loftus&#x27;s arguments by use of the royal prerogative. A farmer named John Fitzgerald had managed, despite Loftus&#x27;s attempt to intercept it, to send a petition to Wentworth claiming that Loftus had first given judgment against him without hearing him or his witnesses in his defence. Loftus had then imprisoned him for allegedly hiding a crop of wheat, his principal asset, to avoid paying the judgment debt, despite Fitzgerald&#x27;s plea that, as a prudent farmer, he had simply stored the crop in his barns. Castle Chamber, without pre-judging the case, asked Loftus to release Fitzgerald pending a further inquiry, but he refused to do so, despite repeated reminders.

Lord Wentworth resolved to use the Fitzgerald case, together with the controversy over the Loftus-Rushe marriage settlement (below), to finally destroy Loftus. In this he was successful, but he could not prevent Loftus from retiring to England, where he worked diligently for Wentworth&#x27;s downfall.

===The Loftus marriage settlement controversy===

In 1621, the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s eldest son, Sir Robert Loftus, married Eleanor Ruishe, daughter of Sir Francis Ruishe; her sisters, Mary and Anne, respectively married The 1st Earl of Mountrath and Sir George Wentworth, the Lord Deputy&#x27;s brother. Sir Francis died in 1629, leaving his three daughters as his co-heiresses. Sir Robert Loftus and his wife lived in the Chancellor&#x27;s house, and mainly at his expense, until the beginning of 1637, when the lady&#x27;s half-brother, Sir John Gifford, petitioned the King, as her next friend, for specific performance of her father-in-law&#x27;s alleged promise to make her a post-nuptial settlement. The consideration for the promised settlement was that she had brought with her a marriage portion of 1,750l.

As the Lord Chancellor could scarcely be the judge in his own case, the matter was referred to the Lord Deputy and the Privy Council, who decided, upon the evidence of a single witness, who testified to words spoken nearly twenty years before, that Loftus must settle upon Sir Robert Loftus and his children by Eleanor Ruishe his house at Monasterevin, County Kildare, furnished, and £1,200 a year in land. The promise, if promise there was, had been purely verbal, and it was not pretended that there was anything to bind the Lord Chancellor in law. He declared that all his land was not worth more than £800 a year, out of which he had settled a jointure of about £300 a year on his daughter-in-law; and he declined altogether to oust his second son, Edward, who ultimately succeeded to the peerage. Costs were given against Loftus, who refused to pay them and appealed to the King. His property was sequestered, and he was imprisoned in Dublin Castle from February 1637 until May 1639, and afterwards in his own house until August, the great seal being transferred to commissioners.

Wentworth, as so often throughout his career, aggravated matters by his habit of bullying, and ordered Loftus to kneel in his presence; the furious old man, who whatever his faults certainly did not lack courage, said that he would die first. He accused the Lord Deputy of partiality at the trial, but apologised and withdrew the charges as being unsupported by evidence and as not proper to be lightly made against a viceroy. Even this was not enough for Lord Wentworth, and the Chancellor had to make his whole estate over to trustees as security before he was allowed to go to England to prosecute his appeal. Wentworth&#x27;s friends, Christopher Wandesford and Sir Philip Mainwaring, were two of those trustees.

In November 1639, the Chancellor&#x27;s appeal was heard before the King in Council and dismissed. The Great Seal of Ireland was in December 1639 given to Sir Richard Bolton. Young Lady Loftus had died in the previous summer, &quot;one of the noblest persons&quot;, Wentworth wrote, &quot;I ever had the happiness to be acquainted with. … With her are gone the greatest part of my affections to the country, and all that is left of them shall be thankfully and religiously paid to her excellent memory and lasting goodness&quot;. In January 1640, Viscount Wentworth was advanced further in the Peerage of England when he was created The 1st Earl of Strafford.

When the Long Parliament met Loftus appealed to it, and on 3 May 1642, the English House of Lords quashed all the decisions against him. The question was again raised after the Restoration, during the viceroyalty of The 1st Earl of Essex, whose report to the King gives the best general account of the whole affair. The result was that the House of Lords in England, after several days&#x27; hearing, reversed the decree made in 1637, thus finally and solemnly declaring that Charles I, Lord Strafford, and their respective councils had been wrong throughout. His arbitrary treatment of Lord Loftus formed part of the eighth article of Strafford&#x27;s impeachment.

Eleanor Loftus herself was Strafford&#x27;s close friend, as well as the sister of his brother&#x27;s wife, but there is no evidence that she was his mistress, and his words quoted above do not support the accusation, which seems to rest upon some ambiguous expressions in Clarendon&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;. Richard Bagwell in the DNB article states &quot;On the other hand, it may be thought suspicious that Sir Robert Loftus refused to join in his wife&#x27;s suit against his father&quot;.

==Last years==

After his fall, Lord Loftus lived at or near his small property at Coverham in Yorkshire. His son Edward had married Jane Lyndley, daughter and heiress of Arthur Lyndley of Middleham, and seems to have been then in possession of Middleham Castle, Yorkshire. In 1641 the ex-chancellor was one of several Irish lords and gentlemen living in England who petitioned Parliament against disseminators of false news from Ireland. The outbreak of the Irish Rebellion in 1641 rendered his Irish estates worthless; like so many of Strafford&#x27;s enemies who helped to bring about and then rejoiced in his destruction, he found that Strafford&#x27;s death precipitated the collapse of the stability of the society he had lived in. He died at the beginning of 1643, and was buried in Coverham Church.

==Family==
Loftus married Sarah Bathow (died 1650), of whom Strafford spoke unkindly, widow of Richard Meredith, Bishop of Leighlin, by whom he had four sons and two daughters, including:
*Robert, who married Eleanor Ruishe, daughter of Sir Francis Ruishe and Mary Giffard, but died before his father, leaving only a daughter.
*Edward who was succeeded to the peerage as the 2nd Viscount. He married Jane Lyndley, daughter of Arthur Lyndley of Middleham, and had issue.
*The younger daughter, Alice, married Charles Moore, 2nd Viscount Moore of Drogheda by whom she had several children. In June 1639 she was seen on her knees before the King at Berwick-upon-Tweed, &quot;very earnestly soliciting for her father&#x27;s coming over&quot;. On the extinction of the male Loftus line, Monasterevin passed through her children to the Moore family. After her husband&#x27;s death in battle in 1643, she broke with the King and was briefly imprisoned for conspiracy. She died of gangrene in 1649 following a fall from her horse.

The title, which became extinct on the death of his grandson, the 3rd Viscount, in 1725 (when the family estate of Monasterevin, renamed Moore Abbey, passed to his daughter&#x27;s son Henry, 4th Earl of Drogheda), was re-granted in 1756 to his cousin Nicholas Loftus, a lineal descendant of the archbishop. It again became extinct more than once afterwards, but was on each occasion revived in favour of a descendant through the female line; and it later became held by the Marquess of Ely in conjunction with other family titles.

In 1900 the Marquess of Drogheda possessed a portrait of the Chancellor, and many interesting papers connected with him.

==Reputation==
Strafford&#x27;s biographer C.V. Wedgwood paints an unfavourable picture of Loftus: &quot;corrupt, crafty, cunning, mean and vain&quot;. She admits that had legal ability, but argues that he owed his rise less to his own talents than to his powerful family connections. Elrington Ball, in his definitive study of the pre-independence Irish judiciary, paints a picture which is not dissimilar but somewhat less severe.

<text>In anatomy, the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) are the two joints connecting the jawbone to the skull. It is a bilateral synovial articulation between the temporal bone of the skull above and the condylar process of mandible below; it is from these bones that its name is derived. The joints are unique in their bilateral function, being connected via the mandible.

== Structure ==
The main components are the joint capsule, articular disc, mandibular condyles, articular surface of the temporal bone, temporomandibular ligament, stylomandibular ligament, sphenomandibular ligament, and lateral pterygoid muscle.

===Capsule===
The articular capsule (capsular ligament) is a thin, loose envelope, attached above to the circumference of the mandibular fossa and the articular tubercle immediately in front; below, to the neck of the condyle of the mandible. Its loose attachment to the neck of the mandible allows for free movement.

===Articular disc===

The unique feature of the temporomandibular joint is the articular disc. The disc is composed of dense fibrocartilagenous tissue that is positioned between the head of the mandibular condyle and the mandibular fossa of the temporal bone. The temporomandibular joints are one of the few synovial joints in the human body with an articular disc, another being the sternoclavicular joint. The disc divides each joint into two compartments, the lower and upper compartments. These two compartments are synovial cavities, which consist of an upper and a lower synovial cavity. The synovial membrane lining the joint capsule produces the synovial fluid that fills these cavities. The disc is biconcave in shape. The anterior portion of the disc serves as the insertion site for the superior head of the lateral pterygoid. The posterior portion attaches to the temporal bone. Both upper and lower compartments do not communicate with each other unless the disc is damaged.

The central area of the disc is avascular and lacks innervation, thus getting its nutrients from the surrounding synovial fluid. In contrast, the posterior ligament and the surrounding capsules along have both blood vessels and nerves. Few cells are present, but fibroblasts and white blood cells are among these. The central area is also thinner but of denser consistency than the peripheral region, which is thicker but has a more cushioned consistency. The synovial fluid in the synovial cavities provides nutrition for the avascular central area of the disc. With age, the entire disc thins and may undergo the addition of cartilage in the central part, changes that may lead to impaired movement of the joint. The synovial membrane covers the inner surface of the articular capsule in the TMJ, except for the surface of the articular disc and condylar cartilage.

The lower joint compartment formed by the mandible and the articular disc is involved in rotational movement—this is the initial movement of the jaw when the mouth opens. The upper joint compartment formed by the articular disc and the temporal bone is involved in translational movement—this is the secondary gliding motion of the jaw as it is opened widely.

In some cases of anterior disc displacement, the pain felt during movement of the mandible is due to the condyle compressing this area against the articular surface of the temporal bone.

===Ligaments===
There are three ligaments associated with the temporomandibular joints: one major and two minor ligaments. These ligaments are important in that they define the border movements, or in other words, the farthest extents of movements, of the mandible. Movements of the mandible made past the extents functionally allowed by the muscular attachments will result in painful stimuli, and thus, movements past these more limited borders are rarely achieved in normal function.

*The major ligament, the temporomandibular ligament, is actually the thickened lateral portion of the capsule, and it has two parts: an outer oblique portion (OOP) and an inner horizontal portion (IHP). The base of this triangular ligament is attached to the zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the articular tubercle; its apex is fixed to the lateral side of the neck of the mandible. This ligament prevents excessive retraction or moving backward of the mandible, a situation that might lead to problems with the joint.
*The two minor ligaments, the stylomandibular and sphenomandibular ligaments are accessory and are not directly attached to any part of the joint.
** The stylomandibular ligament separates the infratemporal region (anterior) from the parotid region (posterior), and runs from the styloid process to the angle of the mandible; it separates the parotid and submandibular salivary glands. It also becomes taut when the mandible is protruded.
** The sphenomandibular ligament runs from the spine of the sphenoid bone to the lingula of mandible. The inferior alveolar nerve descends between the sphenomandibular ligament and the ramus of the mandible to gain access to the mandibular foramen. The sphenomandibular ligament, because of its attachment to the lingula, overlaps the opening of the foramen. It is a vestige of the embryonic lower jaw, Meckel cartilage. The ligament becomes accentuated and taut when the mandible is protruded.

Other ligaments, called &quot;oto-mandibular ligaments&quot;, connect the middle ear (malleus) with the temporomandibular joint:
* discomallear (or disco-malleolar) ligament,
* malleomandibular (or malleolar-mandibular) ligament.

===Nerve supply===
Sensory innervation of the temporomandibular joint is provided by the auriculotemporal nerve and the masseteric nerve (both branches of mandibular nerve (CN V3) which is in turn a branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). Free nerve endings, many of which act as nociceptors, innervate the bones, ligaments, and muscles of the TMJ. The fibrocartilage that overlays the is not innervated.

===Blood supply===
Its arterial blood supply is provided by branches of the external carotid artery, predominately the superficial temporal branch. Other branches of the external carotid artery, namely the deep auricular artery, anterior tympanic artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, and maxillary artery, may also contribute to the arterial blood supply of the joint.

The fibrocartilage that overlays the is avascular in healthy subjects.

=== Development ===
Formation of the temporomandibular joints occurs at around 12 weeks &quot;in utero&quot; when the joint spaces and the articular disc develop. At approximately 10 weeks the component of the fetus future joint becomes evident in the mesenchyme between condylar cartilage of the mandible and the developing temporal bone. Two slits like joint cavities and intervening disk make their appearance in this region by 12 weeks. The mesenchyme around the joint begins to form the fibrous joint capsule. Very little is known about the significance of newly forming muscles in joint formation. The developing superior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle attaches to the anterior portion of the fetal disk. The disk also continues posteriorly through the petrotympanic fissure and attaches to the malleus of the middle ear.

A growth center is located in the head of each mandibular condyle before an individual reaches maturity. This growth center consists of hyaline cartilage underneath the periosteum on the articulating surface of the condyle. This is the last growth center of bone in the body and is multidirectional in its growth capacity, unlike a typical long bone. This area of cartilage within the bone grows in length by appositional growth as the individual grows to maturity. Over time, the cartilage is replaced by bone, using endochondral ossification. This mandibular growth center in the condyle allows the increased length of the mandible needed for the larger permanent teeth, as well as for the larger brain capacity of the adult. This growth of the mandible also influences the overall shape of the face and thus is charted and referred to during orthodontic therapy. When an individual reaches full maturity, the growth center of bone within the condyle has disappeared.

== Function ==
Since the TMJ is connected to the mandible, the right and left joints function together and interdependently.
Each temporomandibular joint is classed as a &quot;ginglymoarthrodial&quot; joint since it is both a ginglymus (hinging joint) and an arthrodial (sliding) joint. The condyle of the mandible articulates with the temporal bone in the mandibular fossa. The mandibular fossa is a concave depression in the squamous portion of the temporal bone.

These two bones are actually separated by an articular disc, which divides the joint into two distinct compartments. The inferior compartment allows for rotation of the condylar head around an instantaneous axis of rotation, corresponding to the first 20mm or so of the opening of the mouth. After the mouth is open to this extent, the mouth can no longer open without the superior compartment of the temporomandibular joints becoming active.

At this point, if the mouth continues to open, not only are the condylar heads rotating within the lower compartment of the temporomandibular joints, but the entire apparatus (condylar head and articular disc) &quot;translates&quot;. Although this had traditionally been explained as a forward and downward sliding motion, on the anterior concave surface of the mandibular fossa and the posterior convex surface of the articular eminence, this translation actually amounts to a rotation around another axis. This effectively produces an evolute which can be termed the resultant axis of mandibular rotation, which lies in the vicinity of the mandibular foramen, allowing for a low-tension environment for the vasculature and innervation of the mandible.

The necessity of translation to produce further opening past that which can be accomplished with a sole rotation of the condyle can be demonstrated by placing a resistant fist against the chin and trying to open the mouth more than 20 or so mm.

The resting position of the temporomandibular joint is not with the teeth biting together. Instead, the muscular balance and proprioceptive feedback allow a physiologic rest for the mandible, an interocclusal clearance, or freeway space, which is 2 to 4 mm between the teeth.

The temporomandibular joint is less stable when teeth are clenched together (occlusion).

===Jaw movement===

Normal full jaw opening is 40-50 millimeters as measured from the edge of lower front teeth to edge of upper front teeth.

When measuring the vertical range of motion, the measurement must be adjusted for the overbite. For example, if the measurement from the edge of the lower front teeth to the edge of the upper front teeth is 40 millimeters and the overbite is 3 millimeters, then the jaw opening is 43 millimeters.

During jaw movements, only the mandible moves.

Normal movements of the mandible during function, such as mastication, or chewing, are known as excursions. There are two lateral excursions (left and right) and the forward excursion, known as protrusion. The reversal of protrusion is retrusion.

When the mandible is moved into protrusion, the mandibular incisors, or front teeth of the mandible, are moved so that they first come edge to edge with the maxillary (upper) incisors and then surpass them, producing a temporary underbite. This is accomplished by translation of the condyle down the articular eminence (in the upper portion of the joint) without any more than the slightest amount of rotation taking place (in the lower portion of the joint), other than that necessary to allow the mandibular incisors to come in front of the maxillary incisors without running into them. (This is all assuming an ideal Class I or Class II occlusion.)

During chewing, the mandible moves in a specific manner as delineated by the two temporomandibular joints. The side of the mandible that moves laterally is referred to as either the working or rotating side, while the other side is referred to as either the balancing or orbiting side. The latter terms, although a bit outdated, are actually more precise, as they define the sides by the movements of the respective condyles.

When the mandible is moved into a lateral excursion, the working side condyle (the condyle on the side of the mandible that moves outwards) only performs rotation (in the horizontal plane), while the balancing side condyle performs the translation. During actual functional chewing, when the teeth are not only moved side to side but also up and down when biting of the teeth is incorporated as well, rotation (in a vertical plane) also plays a part in both condyles.

The mandible is moved primarily by the four muscles of mastication: the masseter, medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid and the temporalis. These four muscles, all innervated by V3, or the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, work in different groups to move the mandible in different directions. Contraction of the lateral pterygoid acts to pull the disc and condyle forward within the glenoid fossa and down the articular eminence; thus, the action of this muscle serves to protrude the jaw, it with the assistance of gravity, and the digastricus muscle also opens the jaw. The other three muscles close the mouth; the masseter and the medial pterygoid by pulling up the angle of the mandible and the temporalis by pulling up on the coronoid process of the mandible.

==Clinical significance==
===Pain===

Temporomandibular joint pain is generally due to one of four reasons.
*Myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome, primarily involving the muscles of mastication. This is the most common cause.
*Internal derangements, an abnormal relationship of the disc to any of the other components of the joint. Disc displacement is an example of internal derangement.
*Osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint, a degenerative joint disease of the articular surfaces.
*Temporal arteritis, for which it is considered a reliable diagnostic criteria

Pain or dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint is referred to as temporomandibular joint dysfunction or temporomandibular joint &quot;disorder&quot; (TMD). This term is used to refer to a group of problems involving the temporomandibular joints and the muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, and other tissues associated with them.

Although rare, other pathologic conditions may also affect the function of temporomandibular joints, causing pain and swelling. These conditions include chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, giant cell tumor, and aneurysmal bone cyst.

===Examination===
The temporomandibular joints can be felt in front of or within the external acoustic meatus during movements of the mandible. Auscultation of the joint can also be performed.

===Disc displacement===
The most common disorder of a temporomandibular joint is disc displacement. In essence, this is when the articular disc, attached anteriorly to the superior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle and posteriorly to the retrodiscal tissue, moves out from between the condyle and the fossa so that the mandible and temporal bone contact is made on something other than the articular disc. This, as explained above, is usually very painful, because, unlike these adjacent tissues, the central portion of the disc contains no sensory innervation.

In most instances of disorder, the disc is displaced anteriorly upon translation, or the anterior and inferior sliding motion of the condyle forward within the fossa and down the articular eminence. On opening, a &quot;pop&quot; or &quot;click&quot; can sometimes be heard and usually felt also, indicating the condyle is moving back onto the disk, known as &quot;reducing the joint&quot; (&quot;disc displacement with reduction&quot;). Upon closing, the condyle will slide off the back of the disc, hence another &quot;click&quot; or &quot;pop&quot; at which point the condyle is posterior to the disc. Upon clenching, the condyle compresses the bilaminar area, and the nerves, arteries, and veins against the temporal fossa, causing pain and inflammation.

In disc displacement without reduction, the disc stays anterior to the condylar head upon opening. Mouth opening is limited and there is no &quot;pop&quot; or &quot;click&quot; sound on opening.

=== Congenital disorders ===
* Aplasia of mandible or cranial bone
* Hypoplasia of mandible or cranial bone
* Hyperplasia of mandible or cranial bone
* Dysplasia abnormal tissue development

===Traumatic disorders===
* Mandibular dislocation
* Fracture
* Subluxation

===Inflammatory disorders===
* Synovitis
* Capsulitis
* Myositis

===Degenerative disorders===
* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Juvenile idiopathic arthritis

===Idiopathic disorders===
* Temporomandibular disorder (TMD, also termed &quot;temporomandibular joint pain-dysfunction syndrome&quot;) is pain and dysfunction of the TMJ and the muscles of mastication (the muscles that move the jaw). TMD does not fit neatly into any one etiologic category since the pathophysiology is poorly understood and it represents a range of distinct disorders with multifactorial etiology. TMD accounts for the majority of pathology of the TMJ, and it is the second most frequent cause of orofacial pain after dental pain (i.e. toothache).

<doc id="203140" wikidata="Q1243510" url="?curid=203140" title="Adam Loftus (bishop)">
<text>Adam Loftus (c. 1533 – 5 April 1605) was an English Roman Catholic priest from North Yorkshire who conformed to Anglicanism following the ascension to the throne of Queen Elizabeth I of England. Loftus subsequently served as Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh, Archbishop of Dublin, and Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1581. Loftus is particularly important to Irish history as the first Provost of Trinity College Dublin and for his central role in the 1584 torture and execution of Archbishop Dermot O&#x27;Hurley, who was Beatified by Pope John Paul II as one of the Irish Catholic Martyrs in 1992. Loftus is also notable, through the marriage of his daughter Anne to the son and heir of Sir Henry Colley and their subsequent issue, as the ancestor of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.

==Early life==
Adam Loftus was born in 1533, the second son of Edward Loftus, bailiff of Swineside (also described as Swineshead) in Coverdale, one of the Yorkshire Dales, for Coverham Abbey. Edward died when Loftus was only eight years old, leaving his estates to his elder brother Robert Loftus. Edward Loftus had made his living through the Catholic Church, but the son embraced the Protestant faith early in his development. He was an undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he reportedly attracted the notice of the young Queen Elizabeth, as much by his physique as through the power of his intellect, having shone before her in oratory. This encounter may never have happened, but Loftus certainly met with the Queen more than once, and she became his patron for the rest of her reign. At Cambridge, Loftus took holy orders as a Catholic priest and was appointed rector of Outwell St Clement in Norfolk. He came to the attention of the Catholic Queen Mary (1553–58), who named him vicar of Gedney, Lincolnshire. On Elizabeth&#x27;s accession in 1558, he declared himself Anglican.

==Ireland==
Loftus made the acquaintance of the Queen&#x27;s favourite Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex and served as his chaplain in Ireland in 1560. In 1561 he became chaplain to Alexander Craike, Bishop of Kildare, and Dean of St Patrick&#x27;s in Dublin. Later that year he was appointed Rector of Painstown, County Meath, and earned a reputation as a learned and discreet advisor to the English authorities in Dublin. In 1563, he was consecrated archbishop of Armagh at the unprecedented age of 30 by Hugh Curwen, Archbishop of Dublin.

Following a clash with Shane O&#x27;Neill, Chief of the Name of Clan O&#x27;Neill, Lord of Tír Eoghain, and the real power in Ulster during these years, Loftus moved his residence to Dublin in 1564. To supplement the meager income of his troubled archbishopric he was temporarily appointed to the Deanery of St Patrick&#x27;s by the queen in the following year, &quot;in lieu of better times ahead&quot;. He was also appointed president of the new Commission for Ecclesiastical Causes. This led to a serious quarrel with the highly respected Bishop of Meath, Hugh Brady. 
In 1567 Loftus, having lobbied successfully for the removal of Hugh Curwen, who became Bishop of Oxford, and having defeated the rival claims of the Bishop of Meath, was appointed Archbishop of Dublin, where the queen expected him to carry out reforms in the Church. On several occasions, he temporarily carried out the functions of Lord Keeper, and in August 1581 he was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland after an involved dispute with Nicholas White, Master of the Rolls in Ireland. Loftus was constantly occupied in attempts to improve his financial position by obtaining additional preferment (he had been obliged to resign the Deanery of St Patrick&#x27;s in 1567) and was subject to repeated accusations of corruption in public office.

In 1582 Loftus acquired land and built a castle at Rathfarnham, which he inhabited from 1585 (and which has been recently restored to public view).

==Reformation==
In 1569–1570 the divisions in Irish politics took on a religious tinge with the First Desmond Rebellion in Munster and Pope Pius V&#x27;s 1570 papal bull &quot;Regnans in Excelsis&quot;. The bull sentenced Queen Elizabeth to excommunication and deposition for both heresy and the religious persecution of the Catholics under her rule. Thereafter, to a much greater extent than before, all Roman Catholics, even those who were completely apolitical, were regarded as traitors by the Queen and her officials.

Between 1583 and 1584, Archbishop Loftus took a leading part in the arrest, torture, and execution of Dermot O&#x27;Hurley, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cashel. Even though Archbishop O&#x27;Hurley revealed that he was not involved in anything except his religious mission and that he had refused to carry letters from the Cardinal Protector of Ireland to the leaders of the Second Desmond Rebellion, Sir Francis Walsingham suggested he should be tortured. Loftus replied to Walsingham: &quot;Not finding that easy method of examination does any good, we made a command to Mr. Waterhouse and Mr. Secretary Fenton to put him to the torture, such as your honour advised us, which was to toast his feet against the fire with hot boots&quot;. Although the Irish judges repeatedly decided that there was no case against O&#x27;Hurley, on 19 June 1584 Loftus and Sir Henry Wallop wrote to Walsingham &quot;We gave warrant to the knight-marshal to do execution upon him, which accordingly was performed, and thereby the realm rid of a most pestilent member&quot;.

Much has been written about Loftus during this time but between 1584 and 1591; he had a series of clashes with Sir John Perrot on the location of an Irish University. Perrot wanted to use St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin as the site of the new University, which Loftus sought to preserve as the principal place of Protestant worship in Dublin (as well as a valuable source of income for himself). The Archbishop won the argument with the help of his patron, Queen Elizabeth I, and Trinity College Dublin was founded at its current location, named after his old college at Cambridge, leaving the Cathedral unaffected. Loftus was named as its first Provost in 1593.

The issue of religious and political rivalry continued during the two Desmond Rebellions (1569–83) and the Nine Years&#x27; War (1594–1603), both of which overlapped with the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604), during which some rebellious members of the Gaelic nobility of Ireland were covertly aided by the Papacy and by Elizabeth&#x27;s arch-enemy King Philip II of Spain. Due to the unsettled state of the country, Protestantism made little progress in English-speaking or Gaelic Ireland, in direct contrast to the similarly Celtic-language-speaking people of Scotland, the Isle of Man, and Wales. Protestantism came to be associated with military conquest and was intensely hated by many. The political-religious overlap was personified by Adam Loftus, who served as Archbishop and as Lord Chancellor of Ireland. An unlikely alliance accordingly formed between Gaelic Irish families and the Hiberno-Norman &quot;Old English&quot;, who had been mortal enemies for centuries but who now mostly remained Roman Catholic.

==Family==
Around 1560 Adam was quietly married to Jane (c. 1540–1595), the daughter of James Purdon (1516-1595), and his wife Jane Little, daughter of Thomas Little of Thornhill, Cumberland, and Margaret Graham. The Purdons settled in Ireland and became substantial landowners in County Clare and County Cork, and were particularly associated with Ballyclogh, County Cork.

Adam and Jane Loftus were the parents of twenty children, eight of whom died in infancy. The twelve who grew to adulthood were:
# Sir Dudley Loftus, married Anne Bagenal (grandparents of Dudley Loftus, a pioneer scholar of Middle Eastern languages);
# Sir Edward Loftus (died 1601), Recorder of Dublin, killed at the Siege of Kinsale; married Anne Duke, no surviving issue;
# Adam Loftus, unmarried, killed in battle;
# Sir Thomas Loftus, married Ellen Hartpole;
# Henry Loftus, Thomas&#x27; twin, died in his teens;
# Isabella Loftus (also found as &#x27;Isabel&#x27;), married (as his 1st wife) Sir William Ussher, son of John Ussher, Alderman of Dublin, and his wife Ales (or Alison), daughter of Sir William Newman, Knight, Mayor of Dublin;
# Anne Loftus, married (i) Sir Henry Colley of Carbury; (ii) George Blount; and (iii) Edward Blayney, 1st Baron Blayney; she and Henry were ancestors of the Duke of Wellington;
# Catherine Loftus, who married Sir Francis Berkeley and then Henry Berkeley;
# Martha Loftus, who married Sir Thomas Colclough of Tintern Abbey, County Wexford;
# Dorothy Loftus, married Sir John Moore of Croghan;
# Alice Loftus, married Sir Henry Warren of Warrenstown; and
# Margaret Loftus, married Sir George Colley of Edenderry

==Death==
Loftus died in Dublin in 1605 and was interred in the building he had helped to preserve for future generations, while many of his portraits hang today within the walls of the University which he helped found. Having buried his wife Jane (Purdon) and two sons (of their 20 children) in the family vault at St. Patrick&#x27;s, Adam Loftus died at his Episcopal Palace in Kevin Street &quot;worn out with age&quot; and joined his family in the same vault. Loftus&#x27; zeal and efficiency were commended by James I upon the king&#x27;s accession.

==Personality==
Elrington Ball describes him as the dominant judicial figure in Elizabethan Ireland, who through his exceptional strength of personality towered above all his contemporaries.

<text>Richard Mant (12 February 1776 – 2 November 1848) was an English churchman who became a bishop in Ireland. He was a prolific writer, his major work being a &quot;History of the Church of Ireland&quot;.

==Life==
He was born at Southampton, where his father Richard Mant D.D. was headmaster of the King Edward VI School. He was educated at Winchester College and at Trinity College, Oxford (which he entered in 1793). His youngest sister was the writer Alicia Catherine Mant. His maternal grandfather was the scholar Joseph Bingham. He was elected a Scholar of the College in 1794, graduated with a B.A. in 1797, and became a Fellow of Oriel College in 1798 (a position he held up to 1804).

Mant was ordained in the Church of England, initially holding a curacy at Southampton in 1802. He was then appointed to the vicarage of Coggeshall, Essex in 1810, and in 1811 he became Bampton Lecturer. In 1816 he was made rector of St Botolph&#x27;s, Bishopsgate, and in 1820 became Bishop of Killaloe and Kilfenora, in Ireland. In 1823 he was translated to Down and Connor, and from 1842 was the Bishop of Down, Connor and Dromore when the two dioceses united.

Richard Mant died in Ballymoney, Ireland on 2 November 1848.

==Works==
In 1808 Mant published &quot;The Simpliciad&quot;, a satirical poem that parodied &quot;Poems, in Two Volumes&quot; (1807) by William Wordsworth. He gave notes relating his parodies to the originals. The aim of the work included the other Lake Poets, Robert Southey and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, with &quot;To a Young Ass&quot; by Coleridge used to tease the group as a whole. In 1832, Mant published &quot;The Gospel of Miracles, in a Series of Poetical Sketches, with Illustrative Conversations,&quot; an attempt to represent the miracles of the Saviour in verse.

Mant&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Hymns from the Roman Breviary&quot; (1837) was one of the earliest collections of translated Latin hymnody in English. He belonged to a group of revivalist translators of Latin hymns, with John Chandler (1806–1876) and Isaac Williams. John Ellerton commented on his good taste, but also discerned a lack of understanding of the group of hymns he was handling. The &quot;Psalms in an English Metrical Version&quot; (1824) were influenced by Robert Lowth&#x27;s theories of biblical poetry, the psalms becoming &quot;stiff and stately odes&quot; according to John Julian.

Other works included:

*A biblical commentary written with George D&#x27;Oyly
*&quot;History of the Church of Ireland&quot; (1839–1841; 2 vols.).
*&quot;An Appeal to the Gospel&quot; (1812), Bampton Lectures.
*&quot;The Book of Common Prayer...with Notes&quot; (1850).
*&quot;An Explanation of the Rubrics of the Book of Common Prayer&quot; (1864).

==Family==
Mant married Elizabeth Wood (died 2 April 1846), of a Sussex family, on 22 December 1804. Their children were Walter Bishop Mant, another son, and a daughter.

<text>The woodchat shrike (Lanius senator) is a member of the shrike family Laniidae. It can be identified by its red-brown crown and nape. It is mainly insectivorous and favours open wooded areas with scattered trees such as orchards, particularly when there is bare or sandy ground. The woodchat shrike breeds in southern Europe, the Middle East and northwest Africa, and winters in tropical Africa.

==Taxonomy==
The woodchat shrike was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Lanius senator&quot;. Linnaeus based his description on the &quot;red headed butcher-bird&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1734 by the English naturalist Eleazar Albin in the second volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Birds&quot;. Linnaeus mistakenly specified the type locality as &quot;Indiis&quot;. This was corrected to the River Rhine in Germany by Ernst Hartert in 1907. The genus name, &quot;Lanius&quot;, is derived from the Latin word for &quot;butcher&quot;, and some shrikes are also known as &quot;butcher birds&quot; because of their feeding habits. The specific &quot;senator&quot; is Latin for &quot;senator&quot;, so-named because its chestnut cap recalled the colour of the stripe on the toga of a Roman senator. The common name &quot;woodchat&quot; is an Anglicisation of German &quot;waldkatze&quot;, literally &quot;woodcat&quot;, and &quot;shrike&quot; is from Old English &quot;scríc&quot;, &quot;shriek&quot;, referring to the shrill call.

A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2019 found that within the genus &quot;Lanius&quot; the woodchat shrike was sister to the lesser grey shrike (&quot;Lanius minor&quot;), a migratory species which breeds in the Mediterranean and steppe regions of the southern Palearctic. The two species diverged from each other around 3.9–5.0 million years ago.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;L. s. senator&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 – central, south Europe and north Africa
* &quot;L. s. badius&quot; Hartlaub, 1854 – west Mediterranean Islands
* &quot;L. s. niloticus&quot; (Bonaparte, 1853) – Cyprus and south Turkey to Iran

==Description==

The woodchat shrike is in overall length which is slightly larger than a red-backed shrike. The male is a striking bird with black and white upper parts, a chestnut crown and pure white underparts. The race &quot;L. s. badius&quot; of the western Mediterranean lacks the large white wing patches. In the female and young birds, the upperparts are brown and white and vermiculated. Underparts are buff and also vermiculated.

==Distribution and habitat==
The breeding range of the woodchat shrike is in southern Europe, northern Africa and the Middle East. The range extends from Portugal to Greece, Turkey, Iraq and Iran, and in the Arabian Peninsula including Bahrain and Kuwait, and from Mauritania and Western Sahara in northern Africa to Libya. This bird overwinters in tropical central Africa, its winter range extending from Senegal to Sudan and Ethiopia in the east and southwards to Gabon. This species often overshoots its breeding range on spring migration, and is a rare, but annual, visitor to Great Britain. The Balearic race &quot;badius&quot; has occurred in Britain around four times as a vagrant, and has also been recorded once in Ireland.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===

Eggs are laid from early May to mid-July. The nest is built by both sexes and is placed in a tree, usually a fruit or olive tree. The nest is a strong cup of plant material which is lined with wool, hair, fine roots, cobwebs and lichen. The nest sometimes includes green plant material. The clutch is usually 5–6 eggs which are laid daily. The eggs are glossy and vary in colour: they can be pale olive-green, sandy, greyish-yellow or brown. They have brown to pale olive speckles concentrated at the broader end. For the nominate subspecies the average size is with a calculated weight of . After the last egg is laid they are incubated by the female; only very rarely does the male participate. The eggs hatch after 14–15 days. The young are cared for by both parents and fledge after 15–20 days. The parents continue to feed the fledgelings up to 3 to 4 weeks of age.

The longest lived woodchat shrike recorded by ring-recovery data is 5 years and eight months for a bird found dead in Germany.

===Food and feeding===
The woodchat shrike mainly eats insects, particularly beetles, but its diet can include other invertebrates and very occasionally small mammals and small birds. It hunts by perching on an exposed lookout such as on a branch of a tree or on a fence, typically above the ground, and then dropping or gliding down to its prey. It also makes sallying flights after flying insects. Small insects are crushed in its bill but large insects are dismembered. Impaling prey on a thorn has been recorded but is unusual. Indigestible material such as chitin, bones and hair is regurgitated as pellets.

==Population==
Though it remains common, the woodchat shrike has been declining for a long period. In its European range, it is listed as a threatened species in many countries, such as France, Poland, and Switzerland. Due to its large population, estimated to be 5.9-10 million individuals, it was listed as a least concern species by the IUCN since 1988. The species for a long time had battled several devastating threats, including loss of habitat due to agriculture, afforestation, excessive use of pesticides, climate change shrinking the species’ range, trans-migratory hunting, declines of insect prey and droughts.

<doc id="203144" wikidata="Q313846" url="?curid=203144" title="Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence">
<text>Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, (; 29 November 133817 October 1368), was an English prince, Earl of Ulster &quot;jure uxoris&quot; from 1347, Duke of Clarence from 1362, Guardian of England in 1345–46, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1361–66, Knight of the Garter from 1361, third son (second surviving) of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault. He was named after his birthplace, at Antwerp in the Duchy of Brabant. 

In 1355–60, Lionel took part in the Hundred Years&#x27; War with France and the Second War of Scottish Independence. After the Treaty of Brétigny, much of the Prince&#x27;s later career was linked to Ireland. Through his first marriage to Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster, he inherited large holdings in Northern, Western and South-Western Ireland, as well as the title of Earl of Ulster. In 1361, Edward III appointed his son the royal lieutenant (viceroy) of Ireland, and in 1362 he created the title of Duke of Clarence for him, making Lionel the first among the Irish peers. The prince remained viceroy until 1366 (with two short breaks in 1364 and 1365, when he went to England). During this time, Lionel led several military campaigns on the island and adopted the Statutes of Kilkenny in February 1366, which became his most important legacy for the Irish government.

Lionel&#x27;s first wife died in 1363. In 1367, Edward III arranged a new marriage for his son with Violante Visconti, whose father was the ruler of Milan. A lavish marriage ceremony took place in May or June 1368, but Lionel died soon after, possibly poisoned by his father-in-law. He left one daughter, Philippa, from his first marriage. In the 15th century, the House of York justified their preemptive right to the English throne through their descent from Lionel and Philippa.

==Life==
===Origins===
Lionel patrilineally descended from the English royal House of Plantagenet. His father was Edward III, King of England since 1327 and his mother was Philippa of Hainault, who came from the French Avesnes family. His paternal grandparents were King Edward II of England and Isabella of France, and his maternal grandparents were William I, Count of Hainaut, Holland and Zeeland and Joan of Valois. Edward III and Philippa had 12 children in the course of their marriage. Lionel was the fifth born child and the third but second surviving son (one of his older brothers, William of Hatfield, died in infancy in 1337). Of the other brothers, the eldest, Edward the Black Prince, was the heir to Edward III. Lionel also had four younger brothers (three of them survived infancy: John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York and Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester), as well as five sisters, of whom only the eldest, Isabella, Countess of Bedford, survive to adulthood.

===Birth and early years===
Lionel was born on 29 November 1338 at St. Michael&#x27;s Abbey in Antwerp, while his parents were living in the Low Countries. Gilles de Monte, a doctor from Hainault, took care of the newborn prince for 13 weeks, for which he received a reward of 15 £. Due to the place of birth, Lionel received the nickname &quot;of Antwerp&quot;.

There are several versions explaining the unusual name that Edward III gave to his son. According to one of them, it is a reference to the Lion of Brabant —the heraldic symbol of John III, Duke of Brabant, one of the allies of the English king at that time. However, according to modern researchers, the choice of name is more likely due to the fact that Edward III, who adored the legends of King Arthur, at that time identified himself with one of the Knights of the Round Table —Sir Lionel, often participating in jousting tournaments with his coat of arms (for example, at a tournament in Dunstable in 1334). In addition, the name had an obvious association with the heraldic lions (more precisely, leopards) depicted on the English coat of arms. According to another version, Edward III decided to revive the &quot;Welsh name Llywelyn&quot;.

Lionel&#x27;s godfather was William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury. Previously, the king had granted the earl the privilege of wearing the royal arms bearing an eagle; in 1339 Salisbury&#x27;s godson received the same privilege.

Already at the age of 3, Lionel was included in the dynastic policy of his father, who sought to ensure the inheritance of his sons. Back in 1333, William de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster and 6th Baron Connaught, the head of one of the largest Anglo-Norman families in Ireland, died. From his marriage to Maud of Lancaster, he left an only daughter, Elizabeth, who inherited the de Burghs&#x27; large estates in Ireland. On 9 September 1342, Lionel and Elizabeth de Burgh were married in the Tower of London. The composition of the possessions inherited by Lionel as a dowry included large territories of Connacht, Munster and Ulster, located in Northern, Western and Southwestern Ireland.

The marriage was consummated in 1352, but no later than 26 January 1347, Lionel was recognized Earl of Ulster &quot;jure uxoris&quot; (by right of his wife). Apparently, Edward III wanted to make his son the largest Irish magnate. However, during this period, the power of the leaders of the Gaelic tribes increased on the island. In addition, claims to Ulster were made by other representatives of the de Burgh family. As a result, the governors who ruled on Lionel&#x27;s behalf only had effective control over a very limited area. To remedy this situation, Edward III married off Maud of Lancaster, Elizabeth&#x27;s mother, to Sir Ralph de Ufford, brother of his close friend Robert Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk. In 1345 Ralph was appointed Justiciar (viceroy) of Ireland and he was given the task of restoring the County of Ulster, but already in 1346 he died. As a result, the plans of the English king did not materialize. Only 15 years later, Lionel was able to get control of Ireland.

One of the reasons for the delay in gaining power in Ireland was the war that Edward III waged against France. When the English king went to Flanders in July 1345, Lionel was appointed Guardian (Regent) of England from 3 to 26 July. He held the same position from 11 July 1346 to 12 October 1347, when Edward III conducted a long military campaign in France, ending with the Siege of Calais and the Battle of Crécy. Since Lionel at this time, due to his age, could not independently manage the kingdom, a council exercised royal power on his behalf. Nevertheless, in the second period, the regent was provided with a personal seal at the expense of the king, which allowed Lionel to solve a limited range of administrative duties assigned to him personally. Documents surviving bearing this seal show that the prince&#x27;s personal household was successively located during this period at the Tower, Windsor, Reading (most of 1367) and Bristol.

===Participation in the wars with France and Scotland===
In 1355, Lionel&#x27;s military career began: in that year he was knighted, after which he accompanied his father to Calais and took part in an unsuccessful raid on French lands. During his participation in the French expedition, Lionel&#x27;s wife Elizabeth de Burgh gave birth to a daughter on 16 August 1355 at Eltham Palace: named Philippa after her paternal grandmother, she was Lionel&#x27;s only legitimate offspring but also the eldest grandchild of Edward III and Philippa of Hainault, and thus a potential heiress of the English throne.

In the winter of 1355–1356, Lionel took part in the royal army&#x27;s invasion of Scotland. In the treaty in which the Scottish claimant Edward Balliol renounced his rights to the Scottish throne in favor of the English king, the prince&#x27;s name headed the list of witnesses.

In May 1359, Lionel fought in a jousting tournament held in Smithfield, London. From October 1359 to May 1360, he participated in his father&#x27;s military campaigns, including the unsuccessful siege of Reims and later the peace negotiations at Brétigny.

On 2 December 1360, John Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp of Warwick, one of the Knights of the Order of the Garter, died. In April 1361, Edward III held a ceremony, giving the vacant seat in the Order to Lionel.

===Lord Lieutenant of Ireland===
The peace between England and France concluded at Brétigny in 1360, which lasted until 1369, finally allowed Lionel to take the role in Ireland that his father had planned for him. In July 1360, representatives of the Anglo-Irish political community approached Edward III, begging him to send them a leader who would have sufficient power and resources to restore order to the troubled island. In addition, on 4 November 1360, Elizabeth de Burgh&#x27;s grandmother, Elizabeth de Clare, died, after which her share of the de Clare estates in England and Wales, as well as lands in the County of Ulster that belonged to her as a widow&#x27;s share, came into the possession of Lionel by right of his wife. On 15 March 1361 the English king announced his intention to send his son to rule the possessions on the island, and on 1 July he appointed Lionel Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

In the middle of the 14th century, English possessions in Ireland had to be constantly defended. Although Edward III formally claimed power over the entire island, in essence the local clans were almost independent. English dominance in the vast lands beyond the Bann and Shannon rivers was exercised irregularly and with great difficulty. Even the heartland of the English possessions, which included the lands around Dublin, was at times threatened by a number of Gaelic clans such as the O&#x27;Brien, O&#x27;Toole and Mac Murhi. As a result, in English-controlled lands, royal power was only effective if it met with the tacit support of the local aristocracy, particularly the Earls of Desmond, Ormonde, Louth and Kildare. They, like other representatives of the local colonial aristocracy, sharply criticized Edward III&#x27;s disdainful attitude towards power in these domains. It was alleged that in 1346 Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond, even sent envoys to Pope Clement VI asking him to take Ireland under his jurisdiction, appointing the Earl himself as vicar there. Although representatives of the local nobility demanded the regular intervention of the English king in the affairs of the Irish honors, &quot;Englishmen born in Ireland&quot; (as the local Anglo-Norman barons were often called) had completely different political views than &quot;Englishmen born in England&quot; (this was the name given to royal governors and other officials sent by the English government to Ireland). And such views became a serious problem for the Duke of Clarence.

Edward III believed that &quot;our Irish dominions are reduced to such complete desolation, ruin and misery, that they may be completely lost unless relief is immediately given to our subjects.&quot; At Easter a large meeting of the English landowners in Ireland was held, and they were ordered to provide the prince with soldiers and accompany him to defend their estates. Lionel was given the task of restoring the devastated position of the English colony on the island by demonstrating the military power of the English crown. He landed in Dublin in September 1361, accompanied by his wife and many large landowners. They were accompanied by a military detachment consisting of about 50 knights, 300 men-at-arms and 540 horse archers. In addition, the Duke was allocated sufficient financial resources to hire an additional army in Ireland itself. The original plan to recruit 800 foot archers in Wales appears to have failed.

Apparently, Lionel began to fulfill the duties of Lord Lieutenant of the English possessions in Ireland quite diligently. Almost immediately after landing, he launched a raid on Wicklow, where a Gaelic army had gathered and was threatening the English settlements around Dublin. In the city itself, which Lionel used as his personal headquarters, he had a castle renovated. At the same time, part of the government was transferred to Carlow, which made it possible to increase the efficiency of the military administration of the Irish honors. During the invasion of the O&#x27;Byrnes, Lionel lost a hundred mercenaries and was soon glad to rely on the help of the Irish lords.

To strengthen his son&#x27;s position, Edward III in 1362 repeated the orders of the Anglo-Irish nobility that he had given the year before. In addition, at a meeting of Parliament on 13 November 1362, the king created for his son a new title, Duke of Clarence. The name of the title came from the city, castle and honor of Clare, which he owned as his wife&#x27;s dowry. As a result, Lionel became the first Irish peer. At the same time, while in Ireland, he could not manage his wife’s estates in England, so his salary was increased. The size of the army also doubled.

Early in 1362, Lionel arrived in Drogheda and later that year led a military campaign in Meath. On 22 April 1364 James Butler, 2nd Earl of Ormonde was appointed as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, while the Duke of Clarence returned to England to consult his father and the royal council. On 24 September, Lionel was again appointed Lord Lieutenant and returned to Ireland in December, when he campaigned from Cork through Trim to Drogheda. He continued to try to gain real control over the estates of his wife, who died in 1363. Although his father did his best to provide his son with supplies, Lionel only managed to gain control of a small part of the east coast of Ulster. His constant attempts to rule Ireland through the English led to serious conflict between the &quot;English by birth&quot; and the &quot;English by blood&quot;, but Edward III attempted to reconcile the two in order to unite both factions to wage war against the native Irish.

In 1365, Lionel again traveled briefly to England, leaving Thomas de la Dale in charge of Ireland. On his return, he convened a parliament in Kilkenny in February 1366. It adopted the Statutes of Kilkenny, which became Lionel&#x27;s most important legacy for the Irish government. It was aimed at preventing the process of cultural and political &quot;degeneration&quot; among Irish-born Englishmen. In particular, the king&#x27;s subjects were prohibited from using the Irish language, marrying Irish women, and observing Irish laws. In addition, the distinction between &quot;English by birth&quot; and &quot;English by blood&quot; was eliminated as far as possible. Although there was little new among the rules introduced, their codification in 1366 led to the fact that the provisions of the statutes were in force in Ireland until the beginning of the 17th century.

On 7 November 1366, Edward III replaced his son (tired of this thankless job) as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland with Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond, after which Lionel left the island, vowing —according to the author of the &quot;Eulogium historiarum&quot;— never to return there. His contribution to the English management of the Irish honors is assessed ambiguously. On the one hand, the Duke of Clarence, during the period of administration of the English colony, made the first attempt to force landowners to contribute to the protection of royal possessions. Lionel also managed to achieve some military successes, capturing Art Mor Mac Murdach, the Gaelic leader who caused the greatest trouble for the English; he died in English captivity. On the other hand, the rule of the Duke of Clarence demonstrated that the Irish honors was no longer self-sustaining, since English power in the colony could only be maintained with military and financial assistance from the royal government. When the interests and resolve of the crown weakened, the allocated resources quickly disappeared. Moreover, the political rhetoric of the Irish parliaments of that period does not suggest that the local aristocracy sensed any noticeable changes in the regime of the English kings; the Statutes of Kilkenny above all demonstrated the conflict between the official policy of the English government and the realities of Anglo-Irish political culture.

===Second marriage and death===
After Lionel left Ireland, Edward III appears to have outlined a new role for him in his dynastic strategy. Elizabeth de Burgh, first wife of the Duke of Clarence, died in Dublin in 1363. Her body was transported to England at the expense of the crown and buried in the de Burgh family vault at Clare Priory in Suffolk. On 30 July 1366, Edward III sent a diplomatic mission to Italy, the purpose of which was to discuss the possibility of the marriage of Violante Visconti, daughter of Galeazzo II Visconti, Lord of Milan, with either Lionel or his younger brother Edmund of Langley. Quite quickly, the Duke of Clarence became the preferred candidate for marriage. The initiator of Violante&#x27;s marriage project was her uncle, Bernabò Visconti, who was ready to pay dearly for a prestigious alliance with the Plantagenets. Moreover, according to historian Mark Ormrod, the marriage complemented the anti-papal stance pursued by the English crown in the 1360s. In his opinion, only this can explain what advantages the English king planned to receive from an alliance with Milan, since Edward III&#x27;s dynastic strategy was largely aimed at the British Isles and France.

The marriage contract was signed at the Palace of Westminster in May 1367. In February 1368, the Duke of Clarence, having married his 13-year-old daughter Philippa to the 16-year-old Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March, sailed for Italy. He was accompanied by a retinue of 457 people, who took with them at least 1,280 horses. The wedding ceremony itself took place on 28 May or 5 June in front of Cathedral of Santa Maria Maggiore (where later the Milan Cathedral was built). There is evidence that the elderly poet Petrarch took part in the wedding dinner during the luxurious celebrations that followed the wedding ceremony, which was distinguished by great pomp, sitting among the greatest guests at the first table. In the next 5 months there were continuous celebrations, feasts and tournaments.

Violante&#x27;s dowry was the enormous amount of 2 million golden florins, together with the fiefdoms of Alba, Mondovì, Cuneo, Cherasco, and Demonte. English chroniclers, reporting the incredible success of Edward III&#x27;s marriage policy, believed that Galeazzo II Visconti transferred half of his lands to his son-in-law. However, the marriage turned out to be short and fruitless: already at the beginning of October 1368, Lionel fell ill with an unknown illness and died on 17 October in the city of Alba in Piedmont. Suspicions soon arose that he was poisoned by his father-in-law, although this was never proven. The 19th century historian Thomas Frederick Tout points out that Galeazzo II had no motive to kill his son-in-law, whose death led to the collapse of his ambitions.

Lionel was initially buried in Pavia, but in his will written at Alba, dated 3 October 1368 and confirmed at Lambeth on 8 June 1369, he expressed a desire to be buried in Clare Priory. As a result, his body was later transported to England and buried next to his first wife.

===Legacy===
Unlike his brothers Edward the Black Prince, John of Gaunt and Thomas of Woodstock, Lionel did not play a particularly significant role in English political life. He rarely came to the attention of contemporary chroniclers. Mark Ormrod believes that perhaps Lionel, like his younger brother, Edmund of Langley, was not drawn to the world of high politics. However, it is possible that the fact that his career took place mainly outside England played a role —first in Ireland, then in Italy. His early death shortly before his 30th birthday deprived his English contemporaries of any real knowledge about the personality of the prince and his merits.

Lionel&#x27;s only child, Philippa, 5th Countess of Ulster, married Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March in 1368. They had four children, Lady Elizabeth Mortimer (1371–1417), Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March (1374–1398), Lady Philippa Mortimer (1375–1400) and Edmund Mortimer (1376–1409). Their granddaughter and eventual heiress, Anne Mortimer, married Richard of Conisburgh (younger brother of Edward, 2nd Duke of York) and was the mother of Richard, 3rd Duke of York. Even though Richard of York was a descendant in the male line of Edward III from Edmund of Langley, Lionel&#x27;s younger brother, the House of York based its claim to the English throne on descent through the female line from Lionel. In doing so, the Yorkists were able to present a senior claim to the English throne over the House of Lancaster, the descendants of another younger brother, John of Gaunt. (Edward III&#x27;s first-born son, Edward the Black Prince, had no legitimate descendants past his two sons Edward of Angoulême and King Richard II.) Lionel was the ancestor of Kings Edward IV, Edward V, Richard III and all later English, and subsequently British, monarchs except for Henry VII, whose wife Elizabeth of York was Lionel&#x27;s descendant.

Thanks to Lionel&#x27;s dynastic connection with the House of York, the English chronicler John Hardyng not only came up with an idealized description of the duke&#x27;s appearance, reporting that the prince was a man of great strength and beauty and had a tall stature —reportedly as nearly —, but also suggested that marriage to a member of the House of Visconti could eventually make him King of Italy and even Holy Roman Emperor.

==Arms==

Lionel&#x27;s arms were at some point those of the kingdom, differenced by a label argent of five points, with each point bearing a cross gules, thus presenting the flag of England&#x27;s Saint George&#x27;s cross on each point. There are also suggestions, such as the above image, that at some point he bore a differentiating label argent of three points, each bearing a canton gules.

<text>Hahnodon (&quot;Hahn&#x27;s tooth&quot;) is an extinct genus of mammaliaforms from the Early Cretaceous Ksar Metlili Formation in Morocco. Although originally considered to be a relatively early member of the extinct clade Multituberculata, recent studies indicate that it instead is a haramiyid.

==Fossils and distribution==
&quot;Hahnodon taqueti&quot; is based on a single lower molar found in Lower Cretaceous strata in Morocco.

==Classification==
Denise Sigogneau-Russell (1991) classified &quot;Hahnodon&quot; as a member of Multituberculata, but others later considered it to be related to members of Haramiyida. The description of &quot;Cifelliodon&quot; from North America confirmed that &quot;Hahnodon&quot; — and by extension, Hahnodontidae — belong to Haramiyida.

<text>Galeazzo II Visconti ( – 4 August 1378) was a member of the Visconti dynasty and a ruler of Milan, Italy. His most notable military campaigns were against Pope Gregory XI, around 1367. These battles fought between the papacy and the Visconti family ultimately ended in a peace treaty. Politically active, he expanded the power of his family, where the Visconti first became hereditary rulers of Milan starting in 1349. He is remembered in conjunction with his patronage of intellectuals and writers, from his sponsorship of Petrarch to the founding of the University of Pavia in 1361. Galeazzo II Visconti, and his brother Bernabò, are credited with the institution of the Quaresima Torture Protocol, a vicious means of torture.

==Visconti family==

The founder of the Visconti house is a conflicted claim, though widespread credit goes to Galeazzo&#x27;s ancestor, Ottone Visconti. Other notable figures in the Visconti family include Matteo I (1294–1302), Luchino I (1339–1349) and Bernabò (1354–1385). Prior to his rule over Milan, Galeazzo II was briefly exiled by his uncle, Luchino. During his exile he stayed in Savoy before eventually being invited to return to Milan and share rule over the city with his relatives, Bernabò and Matteo II Visconti. Galeazzo&#x27;s fame is outstripped by that of his son Gian Galeazzo; under Gian Galeazzo, the Visconti&#x27;s status was elevated from mere rulers to dukes of Milan.

Galeazzo II became co-ruler of Milan with his brothers Bernabò and Matteo II through a statute forged by the Milanese General Council. During his time as signore, Galeazzo II was focused on increasing the prestige and influence of the Visconti. He forged ties with Holy Roman emperor Charles IV, who granted him and his two brothers, the shared title of imperial vicar. Although Visconti military activities in North Italy allowed Galeazzo II to set up his base of operations in Pavia, it also drew him into conflict with the Papacy. His death on August 4, 1378, allowed his son Gian Galeazzo Visconti to expand the influence of the family as signore.

Galeazzo II Visconti&#x27;s most notable military campaigns were against Pope Gregory XI, beginning roughly around 1367. A series of battles were fought between the papacy and members of the Visconti family, including Bernarbò and Galeazzo Visconti that ultimately ended in a peace treaty. However, this agreement would be revoked when Bernarbò&#x27;s alliance with Florence, who had also held a longstanding struggle against the papacy, pulled the Visconti family back into battle during the War of Eight Saints in 1375. Another accomplishment of Galeazzo&#x27;s was to claim Pavia in 1359, which helped him fund military expeditions. Pavia later became a principal residence of the Visconti family.

Despite his accomplishments, Galeazzo II Visconti&#x27;s legacy has largely been coloured by a select few aspects of his life. He is largely remembered through the successes of his son, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, who was able to wrest sole control of Milan from his uncle Bernabò Visconti after Galeazzo&#x27;s death. Yet, there is obvious continuity between the power gained by Galeazzo II, and the power maintained, and even expanded upon by Gian Galeazzo, which can be attributed in part to the situation Galeazzo II left his son in.

On top of his political legacy, Galeazzo II is often remembered in conjunction with his patronage of intellectuals and writers, from his sponsorship of Petrarch to the founding of the University of Pavia. Finally, Galeazzo II is associated with a sinister legacy of brutal torture. This comes from his and his brother&#x27;s introduction of the Querasima torture protocol at the beginning of their dual reign in Milan.

==Family history and events==

Galeazzo II Visconti was the son of Stefano Visconti and Valentina Doria. The House of Visconti held family ties to Pisa, Sardinia and Milan. Originally, the founding of the Milanese Visconti line was a particularly contested issue. Galeazzo&#x27;s ancestors, Azzone and Ottone Visconti both held legitimate claims to be considered the founder of their house. However, it was under Ottone that the power of the Visconti house expanded before becoming the dynastic power they were later infamous for. Previously, the Visconti family had only enjoyed limited privileges within the city. As a result of his efforts, Ottone was recognized as the official founder of the Visconti house over Azzone.

As the archbishop of Milan from 1277 to 1294, Ottone wrested control over Milan from its previous rulers before skillfully manoeuvring his nephew Matteo I Visconti into a position of power. Matteo il Magno (roughly translated to mean ‘the Great’) ruled from 1294 to 1302 and then again from 1311 to 1322, preceding Galeazzo&#x27;s rule. Matteo notably achieved control over Pavia, Vercelli, Novara and Como. Though he was temporarily ousted from power by a rebellion, Matteo later received the position of imperial vicar general during his second period of rule. Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV then eventually appointed Matteo as Lord of Milan, thirty years after he first obtained a position in the secular government. In this way, Matteo aided in establishing an enduring lordship over Milan; this moment in time significantly contributed to the hereditary quality of Visconti power. Yet regardless of his achievements, Matteo later died a condemned heretic.

Galeazzo I succeeded Matteo I from 1322 to 1327 and preceded Galeazzo II&#x27;s rule in 1354 by 27 years. Before Galeazzo II became the ruler of Milan he was preceded by: Azzone (1329–1339), Luchino I (1339–1349), and Giovanni (1339–1354). Prior to his rule, Galeazzo was a fairly self-possessed individual. He had proven himself to be a capable diplomat and a lover of the arts. In particular, he was one of Petrarch&#x27;s many patrons. Galeazzo also expressed a love for travelling: in 1343, he embarked on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. He briefly resided in Savoy for several years, where his uncle Luchino had exiled him in 1345. Following his exile and Luchino&#x27;s death, Galeazzo returned to Milan in 1349 at the behest of his remaining uncle, Giovanni Visconti. His uncle also made him governor of Bologna. The following year, Galeazzo commissioned the Visconti Castle, otherwise known as Castello Visconteo located in Pavia. The castle became the main Pavian residence of the Visconti family. During the same year, another significant event occurred in his life on September 28. Perhaps partially reflective of his fondness for Savoy as formed during his years in exile, Galeazzo went on to marry Bianca of Savoy. She was the daughter of Aimone, Count of Savoy and the sister of Amadeo of Savoy. The marriage between the two consequently further cemented the alliance between Savoy and Milan. Together, the couple had two known children.

Almost immediately after getting married, the two had their first and most well-known child, a son by the name of Gian Galeazzo in 1351 who was married off to Isabelle, the daughter of King John of France. Their only other known child was a daughter named Violante. She was born in 1354, the same year Galeazzo assumed shared rule over Milan with his two brothers, Matteo II and Bernabò. He married his daughter off to Lionel of Antwerp, son of Edward III of England, and gave a dowry of 200,000 gold florins.

Matteo was assassinated early on in their rule in 1355. Upon Matteo&#x27;s death, Galeazzo obtained the western part of Lombardy, while Bernabò received the eastern one. In 1362 Galeazzo&#x27;s own health worsened and he moved his court to Pavia, which he had reconquered two years earlier, and where he died in 1378. Though Galeazzo died of natural causes, the same cannot be said for his last remaining brother. Bernabò received a fate similar to Matteo&#x27;s and was assassinated in 1385. Galeazzo&#x27;s son, Gian Galeazzo succeeded his father and uncle&#x27;s rule and went on to achieve fame greater than that of his sibling and father. Beginning his twenty-five-year rule in 1378, Gian Galeazzo eventually became the first official duke of Milan in 1395.

==Political affairs==

In his political life, Galeazzo II Visconti worked to expand the power of his family. The Visconti first became the hereditary rulers of Milan on May 31, 1349, when the General Council of Milan created a statute that the office of dominus generalis would be inherited by the legitimate male descendants of Matteo Visconti, who was the grandfather of Galeazzo II Visconti. One of Matteo Visconti&#x27;s sons, Luchino Visconti, wanted his son Luchino Novello to succeed him as signore of Milan, but this proposal was rejected by Galeazzo II, Matteo II and Bernabò Visconti, who were the sons of Stefano Visconti. After the death of Giovanni Visconti, who was the brother of Galeazzo, Luchino and Stefano Visconti, the General Council of Milan created another statute which proclaimed that Galeazzo II, Matteo II and Bernabò Visconti were to govern Milan as co-rulers because they were the only male adult descendants of their grandfather Matteo Visconti. Other territories under Visconti jurisdiction were to be divided among them as well. Matteo II Visconti died five months after he and his two brothers obtained the title of imperial vicar from the Holy Roman Emperor and although the exact cause of his death was unknown, he left his brothers Galeazzo II and Bernabò as the two remaining co-rulers of Milan.

During the reign of the three brothers, they wanted to increase their privileges and governing powers, so they decided to re-establish good relations with Holy Roman Empire so they could acquire the status of imperial vicars. On May 8, 1355, a diploma of a new vicariate for the three brothers was forged after Emperor Charles IV accepted a payment of 150000 florins from them. According to Jane Black, the imperial vicariate granted more privileges to the three brothers compared to the privileges that their predecessors had received. Most of the privileges the three brothers received from the vicariate were related to judicial processes such as the right to raise imperial taxes. The diploma also granted the Visconti brothers full control over communal laws and customs in their territory. The title of imperial vicar was also hereditary, meaning that the future lords of Milan would be granted the same rights that were granted to the Visconti brothers by Charles IV. Although Galeazzo II and Bernabò continued to refer to themselves as dominus generalis in their official documents, the two brothers eventually referred to themselves as imperial vicars as well to demonstrate their abundance of power to their subjects.

Prior to Galeazzo II Visconti&#x27;s ascension to power, Milan was ruled by Giovanni Visconti, who brought Galeazzo II and Bernabò back from exile. Giovanni&#x27;s military activities drew the ire of the Papacy during the late 1340s, which led to the Papacy writing a letter of complaint to Galeazzo II for the Visconti family&#x27;s incursions in Faenza. Galeazzo II encountered more conflicts with the Papacy during his rule as signore due to his own policy of expanding Visconti influence with his brother Bernabò in North Italy. When the Visconti tried to re-establish their influence in Bologna, a conflict between the Visconti family and the Papacy occurred and this led to the excommunication of Bernabò for heresy. Furthermore, persuaded by the Papacy, Charles IV revoked the vicariate that he granted to the Visconti family in 1361, although he returned the title to them four years later on the condition that they remained loyal and obedient to the Holy Roman Empire and its emperor. Another war broke out in 1372 when Galeazzo II tried to retake the city of Asti, which was opposed by the Count of Savoy. Visconti military activity in the 1370s led to another conflict with the Papacy when Pope Gregory XI condemned both Bernabò and Galeazzo II Visconti as heretics as well as revoking their title as imperial vicar by the Holy Roman Emperor once more in 1372.

In the year 1359, the Galeazzo II Visconti conquered the city of Pavia, which became his base of operations. Those who were exiled from Pavia prior to the Visconti conquest were allowed to return and they were granted political amnesty. Although the two brothers had agreed on sharing authority in Milan, Galeazzo&#x27;s absence from the city allowed his brother Bernabò to possess complete authority over the city. In 1361, Galeazzo II was also able to officially establish a university in Pavia due to a charter that was granted to him by Emperor Charles. Galeazzo II had also married off his son Gian Galeazzo to Isabella of Valois, who was the daughter of the King of France. Galeazzo II also helped his own son acquire political power through a marriage with the French princess Isabella of Valois, which granted his son the title Count of Vertus. On August 4, 1379, Galeazzo II Visconti died, leaving Bernabò as the last of the three co-ruling brothers of Milan. Bernabò would live until 1385 when he was thrown in jail due to a conspiracy hatched by Galeazzo II Visconti&#x27;s son, Gian Galeazzo Visconti. Gian Galeazzo succeeded his father and became the signore of all the lands that were controlled by his father.

==Military campaigns and territorial claims==
After his death in 1367, Cardinal Albonoz left Italy particularly susceptible to control by mercenaries. This would give rise to merchant families within Italian city-states, like the Visconti family who came to dominate Milan and the rest of northern Italy by the fifteenth century. Galeazzo II Visconti, alone, played an important role in centralizing power under the Visconti name through various military campaigns in the fourteenth century. These military operations allowed him to come into control of densely populated areas and to, therefore, amass a significant amount of power that would be passed down to his son Gian Galeazzo Visconti. Gian Galeazzo&#x27;s inheritance helped him come closest in uniting all of Italy under a central rule, therefore marking the important contribution that Galeazzo II made to the Visconti family legacy.

During the fourteenth century, the pope and emperor had little influence over Italian political affairs. Nobility did not ensure power. Therefore, Italian city-states were left to choose their leader whose responsibility was to defend their city from external enemies and to wage war on rival cities in hopes of gaining more territory. Members of powerful merchant families, such as Galeazzo II, would often be selected for these positions and would seize neighbouring cities in order to extend their rule; affluence and their family name would gain them recognition and help them to become elected as city-state leader. They would then be awarded designations such as ‘vicarite for life’ in order to legitimize their authority over civilians. Galeazzo II was granted this title as was his brother, Bernabò Visconti, once they gained territory in northern Italy.

The Visconti family&#x27;s seizing of territory, in particular, was seen as a major threat to the Papacy. Members of the merchant family often took spiritual authority into their own hands and regulated temporal affairs throughout their land. As this served to further centralize the Visconti power and drew authority away from the papacy, battles between the two factions occurred frequently. Both groups would form alliances with local and international powers in order to suppress their rival&#x27;s army and to prevent their opponent&#x27;s accumulation of power. Galeazzo II was drawn into warfare with Pope Gregory XI when serving an alliance with his brother, Bernabò V; the papacy became his biggest military opponent during his reign of northern Italian city-states. The rivalry between Bernabò and Pope Gregory XI had been carried down from Pope Urban V, who sought to expel the brothers and to revoke their territorial possessions. Galeazzo stood to lose Angevin cities in Piedmont after pope Gregory attempted to suppress his army by forming alliances with local and international powers such as Genoa, Amedeo of Savoy, the Marquis of Monferrato, Niccolo D’Este, Albert, Duke of Austria, Gerald, the elector of Nuremberg and Charles, the Holy Roman Empire. By doing so, Gregory XI looked to gain territory regionally and to deprive the Visconti brothers of international mercenary support. The battle between the papacy and the Visconti brothers continued until Gregory signed a peace treaty with the brothers in the spring of 1378.

Galeazzo&#x27;s distinction and authority over different city-states was crucial in helping fund military campaigns against the papacy and in helping to perpetuate his rule over north Italy. The financing of military expeditions was dependent on the taxation of Galeazzo&#x27;s city-states, some of which included Milan and Pavia, which he claimed in 1359 and made the primary residence of the Visconti family. However, multiple wars, heavy taxation and refusal to align with the papacy generated disapproval amongst Galeazzo&#x27;s subjects. Inconsistent and costly governance caused resistance against Galeazzo II&#x27;s rule.

It has been argued that Galeazzo II&#x27;s reign was tyrannical. The use of violent tactics, assistance from exiled opponents, expansionist ideals which challenged the papacy at the expense of subjects, and seizing power over regions without permission of the rightful overload, empire or papacy were traits found within Galeazzo&#x27;s rule. An example of his alleged tyranny was when Galeazzo II unrightfully seized the city-state, Pavia, on 13 November 1359. In order to weaken the Visconti influence, emperor Charles IV gave vicariate of Pavia to Giovanni Palaeologus II. After a rebellion led by the Augustinian friar Jacopo Bussolari broke out, calling for the city&#x27;s independence, Galeazzo recognized Pavia&#x27;s vulnerability and seized the city-state for himself. Though the citizens resisted his domination, they eventually gave in to Galeazzo&#x27;s control. Throughout his rule, Galeazzo was also accused of heresy, seeking to kill the pope, and fighting to claim lordship of all of Italy, which support the allegations of tyrannical rule.

Galeazzo&#x27;s brother Bernabò Visconti, whom he fought alongside when challenging the papacy, has also been considered a tyrant. Bernabò was particularly brutal towards the church and was listed as an enemy as a result. Together, the brothers fought against Pope Urban V and Pope Gregory XI and were both excommunicated by the papacy in 1373. Military figures such as John Hawkwood and Amadeo of Savoy were hired to attack the Visconti brothers and their city-states, Pavia and Piacenza. However, Amadeo of Savoy helped to end the long-standing battle between the papacy and the Visconti brothers after recognizing the increasingly oppressive nature of the papacy, which hoped to destroy the Milanese family at all costs, and which did not recognize their legitimate territorial dominions. Galeazzo II&#x27;s marriage to Bianca of Savoy re-formed an alliance with the House of Savoy and Gregory XI was compelled to sign a peace treaty with Galeazzo II and Bernabò in the spring of 1375. Peace between Pope Gregory XI and the Visconti family was transient in that soon after their agreement, Bernabò&#x27;s alliance with Florence, who had a longstanding struggle with the papacy, called for their support in the War of Eight Saints, waged against Gregory XI. Galeazzo II fought against the papacy alongside his brother until his death in 1378.

==Legacy==
Along with his many accomplishments in life, Galeazzo II Visconti left behind a tangible and important legacy after his death in 1378. He was most well known for having left behind: continued Visconti rule under Gian Galeazzo Visconti, his son; his prolific patronage of intellectuals and their associated institutions; and finally, the Quaresima torture protocol, for which he has become infamous.

The first, and most commendable legacy of Galeazzo II is his commitment to both the sponsorship and patronage of scholars and intellectual institutions. Galeazzo II Visconti is known to have established the University of Pavia in 1361, upon moving his court to that city in the face of growing rivalry with his brother, Bernabò Visconti. Galeazzo II&#x27;s founding of this university came with the help of Emperor Charles IV of the Holy Roman Empire, with the granting of the university&#x27;s charter. The University of Pavia, carefully fostered by Galeazzo II, and in turn, by his son, Gian Galeazzo, would develop into a leader amongst the Northern Italian scholarly institutions, and would directly precipitate the widespread circulation of legal and medical texts throughout Pavia. Figures such as Lorenzo Valla would later be associated with the university. One step beyond establishing the University of Pavia, Galeazzo II Visconti personally entertained scholarly figures at his court, and offered patronage to them while they remained there. Literary greats like Geoffrey Chaucer ventured from England to Milan whilst it was under the control of the Visconti to study the vast libraries of the Visconti family, which contained works by figures like: Virgil, Seneca, Ovid, Macrobius, Dante, and Petrarch. There is also evidence of Petrarch being a guest of Galeazzo II&#x27;s court, where he wrote for a number of years before his time in Padua. This is known through the extensive volumes of writing personally belonging to Petrarch which were brought from Padua to the Visconti Libraries for his stint under the Visconti.

Galeazzo II&#x27;s rule would serve to set up Gian Galeazzo&#x27;s rule of Pavia. It is immediately evident just how influential the father had been on his son. It is thought that Galeazzo II and his brother, Bernabò Visconti, came to rule after a successful plot against their third brother, Matteo II. Very much in the same vein, Gian Galeazzo was able to mastermind a coup d&#x27;état against Bernabò, his uncle. This bloody legacy of homicide, at first taking the form of fratricide, and then avunculicide, is a large part of the Visconti legacy forged by Galeazzo II. Yet another legacy of Galeazzo II Visconti with his son is the importance placed on education. Gian Galeazzo, upon ascending to the throne at Pavia, remained content to study, retreating from the mess of Italian politics in Northern Italy, and focussing on his Humanist studies at the University of Pavia; the same university which his father had set up when he moved his seat of power there. The final Visconti legacy passed from father to son is that of embarking upon massive building projects. For Galeazzo II, this was the massive palace he constructed at Pavia, which was completed for him in 1363. For his son Gian Galeazzo, this tendency to build as a means of impressing the populace continued. Gian Galeazzo Visconti commissioned the construction of the Certosa of Pavia and provided help and counsel in the construction of the Duomo in Milan when he became Signore of all Milan, following the overthrow of Bernabò Visconti.

Galeazzo II is famously known for instituting the Quaresima Torture Protocol. Rather than one method of torture, this marathon of depravity lasted for forty days with the express intention of resulting in the death of the individual, who, by undergoing this regimen, had already been branded a traitor by the state, and marked for execution. The Quaresima protocol involves several torture mechanisms employed on the victim for an entire day. This is followed by a reprieve of one day&#x27;s time, to allow the victim to recuperate enough to endure yet another day of suffering. The prescribed tortures included: the Rack, the Wheel, Flaying, Eye-gouging, the cutting off of facial features and limbs, as well as the Strappado; a form of torture where the subject&#x27;s hands were bound behind his back, and then hoisted off the ground and repeatedly dropped with the intention of dislodging the shoulder joints, resulting in immense pain. Galeazzo II Visconti, along with his brother Bernabò, is credited with the institution of this particularly vicious means of torture. It is thought that this torture protocol was proclaimed in an edict upon the ascent to the rulership of Milan by both Galeazzo II and Bernabò, likely as a means of intimidating the populace in order to cement their new-found rule.

<doc id="203153" wikidata="Q352489" url="?curid=203153" title="Aulus Plautius">
<text>Aulus Plautius was a Roman politician and general of the mid-1st century. He began the Roman conquest of Britain in 43, and became the first governor of the new province, serving from 43 to 46.

==Career==
Little is known of Aulus Plautius&#x27;s early career. It was previously believed that he was involved in the suppression of a slave revolt in Apulia, which possibly happened in 24, alongside Marcus Aelius Celer. However, the &quot;A·PLAVTIO&quot; of the inscription is now identified as Aulus&#x27; father of the same name, Aulus Plautius. The younger Plautius was suffect consul for the second half of 29, with Lucius Nonius Asprenas as his colleague. Subsequently, he held a provincial governorship, probably of Pannonia, in the early years of Claudius&#x27;s reign; another inscription shows he oversaw the building of a road between Trieste and Rijeka at that time. Anthony Birley suspects Plautius also played a role in suppressing the coup by Lucius Arruntius Camillus Scribonianus in 42.

Claudius appointed Plautius to lead his invasion of Britannia in 43. The &quot;casus belli&quot; was to restore Verica, king of the Atrebates and an ally of Rome, to the throne; he had been deposed by his eastern neighbours, the Catuvellauni. Birley argues that Plautius was selected not only out of gratitude for his loyalty the previous year, but for his established familial connections to Claudius and the Imperial family.

The invasion force consisted of four legions: IX &quot;Hispana&quot;, then in Pannonia; II &quot;Augusta&quot;; XIV &quot;Gemina&quot;; and XX &quot;Valeria Victrix&quot;, plus about 20,000 auxiliary troops, including Thracians and Batavians. Legio II &quot;Augusta&quot; was commanded by the future emperor Vespasian. Three other men of appropriate rank to command legions are known to have been involved in the invasion: Vespasian&#x27;s brother, Titus Flavius Sabinus, and Gnaeus Hosidius Geta appear in Dio Cassius&#x27;s account of the invasion; Gnaeus Sentius Saturninus is mentioned by Eutropius, although as a former consul he may have been too senior, and perhaps accompanied Claudius later.

On the beaches of northern Gaul Plautius faced a mutiny by his troops, who were reluctant to cross the Ocean and fight beyond the limits of the known world. They were persuaded after Claudius&#x27;s freedman and secretary Narcissus addressed them. Seeing a former slave in place of their commander, they cried &quot;Io Saturnalia!&quot; (Saturnalia being a Roman festival in which social roles were reversed for the day) and the mutiny was over.

The invasion force is generally believed to have landed at Richborough in Kent, although elements may have landed elsewhere (see Site of the Claudian invasion of Britain). The Britons, led by Togodumnus and Caratacus of the Catuvellauni, were reluctant to fight a pitched battle, relying instead on guerrilla tactics. However, Plautius defeated first Caratacus on the River Medway, then Togodumnus on the River Thames. Togodumnus died shortly afterwards, although Caratacus survived and continued to be a thorn in the invaders&#x27; side.

Having reached the Thames River, Plautius halted and sent for Claudius, who arrived with elephants and heavy artillery and completed the march on the Catuvellaunian capital, Camulodunum (Colchester). Claudius claimed in a triumphal inscription that he accepted the surrender of 11 British kings at Camulodunum. A Roman province was established from the conquered territory and Plautius was appointed its governor.
Beginning in the year following the successful conquest, the four legions that comprised the provincial garrison proceeded to extend the boundaries of the new province: Legio IX pushed north along the course of what became Ermine Street to construct a camp at what later became Lincoln; Legio XIV advanced into the Midlands along the course of Watling Street, then turned north to set up its base at what later became Leicester; Legio II, under the command of Vespasian, marched through the south reducing over 20 hill forts, conquering the Isle of Wight, and subduing two powerful tribes, to eventually set up its own base most likely at Exeter; the fourth major unit, Legio XX, Plautius likely kept at Camulodunum with some auxiliaries as a reserve force. Some years would pass before the provincial seat would be moved to Londinium, which came into existence later in Plautius&#x27; tenure.

In 47, Plautius was replaced by Publius Ostorius Scapula. On his return to Rome and civil life, Plautius was granted an ovation, during which the emperor himself walked by his side to and from the Capitol.

== Family ==
Aulus Plautius was the son of Aulus Plautius, who was suffect consul in 1 BCE, and possibly Vitellia. Quintus Plautius, consul in 36, was his younger brother. His sister Plautia has been identified as the wife of Publius Petronius, consul in 19; the marriage is attested in an inscription. The daughter of Plautia and Publius Petronius, Petronia, married Aulus Vitellius, later emperor during the Year of Four Emperors.

Aulus Plautius married Pomponia Graecina, whom Birley has identified as the daughter of Gaius Pomponius Graecinus, suffect consul in 16. After the execution of her kinswoman Julia Drusi Caesaris by Claudius and Messalina, Pomponia remained in mourning for forty years in open and unpunished defiance of the emperor. In 57 she was charged with a &quot;foreign superstition&quot;, interpreted by some to mean conversion to Christianity. According to Roman law, she was tried by her husband before her kinsmen, and was acquitted. There are no attested children of this marriage; though it has been suggested that a later Aulus Plautius, alleged to be the lover of Agrippina the Younger, may have been their son. However, some modern historians, such as Birley, have suggested that, despite the shared name, this Aulus Plautius is the son of Aulus Plautius&#x27; brother, Quintus Plautius.

Aulus Plautius was the uncle whose &quot;distinguished service&quot; saved his nephew Plautius Lateranus, (another son of Quintus Plautius) from execution in 48 after his affair with Messalina was discovered. Lateranus was removed from his senatorial position and exiled instead. Lateranus was later executed for his involvement in the Pisonian conspiracy against Nero in 65, from which it is concluded that his uncle Aulus Plautius was by that time deceased.

==Portrayals in fiction==
Plautius is a character in Henryk Sienkiewicz&#x27;s novel &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, and in Simon Scarrow&#x27;s novel &quot;The Eagle&#x27;s Conquest&quot;.

In the film &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1951), based on Sienkiewicz&#x27;s novel, Plautius (played by Felix Aylmer) and his wife Pomponia are (ahistorically) Christians.

Plautius is played by David Morrissey in the streaming TV series &quot;Britannia&quot; (2018), which portrays a fantasy version of the Roman conquest, where he serves as the series&#x27; primary antagonist.

<doc id="203156" wikidata="Q752678" url="?curid=203156" title="Isabelline shrike">
<text>The isabelline shrike or Daurian shrike (Lanius isabellinus) is a member of the shrike family (Laniidae). It was previously considered conspecific with the red-backed shrike and red-tailed shrike. It is found in an extensive area between the Caspian Sea and north and central China southeast to the Qaidam Basin. Overwinters in Africa and Arabia. 

==Etymology==
The genus name, &quot;Lanius&quot;, is derived from the Latin word for &quot;butcher&quot;, and some shrikes are also known as &quot;butcher birds&quot; because of their feeding habits. The common name is from the specific &quot;isabellinus&quot;, Neo-Latin for &quot;greyish-yellow&quot; probably named for Isabella I of Castile, said to have promised not to change her undergarments until Spain was freed from the Moors. The common English name &quot;shrike&quot; is from Old English &quot;scríc&quot;, &quot;shriek&quot;, referring to the shrill call.


==Habits==
This migratory medium-sized passerine eats large insects, small birds, rodents and lizards. Like other shrikes it hunts from prominent perches, and impales corpses on thorns or barbed wire as a larder. It breeds in open cultivated country, preferably with thorn bushes.

==Description==
The plumage is isabelline, the sandy colour which gives rise to its name. It has a red tail. Young birds can be distinguished from young red-backed shrikes by the much sparser vermiculations on the underparts.

<text>Dark Days is the third studio album by the American nu metal band Coal Chamber. It was released on May 7, 2002.

==Background and content==
Coal Chamber began recording &quot;Dark Days&quot; with producer Ross Hogarth at Rumbo Recorders on May 29, 2001. The band finished recording bass and drum tracks by mid-June 2001, after which guitars and vocals were recorded. The album was mostly completed on September 18, 2001, with Dez Farara going into the studio to re-record his vocals on September 21, 2001. Bassist Rayna Foss-Rose left the band after this album was recorded; she was replaced by Nadja Peulen, who had already previously replaced her for Coal Chamber&#x27;s tours in 1999 during Rayna&#x27;s pregnancy. This was the last studio album from Coal Chamber before they disbanded due to personal differences.

&quot;Dark Days&quot; is often regarded as the band&#x27;s most aggressive and heaviest album; while past Coal Chamber albums had softer songs scattered throughout them, &quot;Dark Days&quot; stays mostly aggressive all the way through. &quot;Dark Days&quot; mostly combines the styles from the band&#x27;s debut album with their second album &quot;Chamber Music&quot;, mixing the nu metal elements with the gothic metal elements from Chamber Music. &quot;Dark Days&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics but was more popular with fans.

On their last show, guitarist Meegs Rascón accidentally hit vocalist Dez Fafara on the head with his guitar, with Dez walking off stage only to reappear claiming that this was to be Coal Chamber&#x27;s last show. Dez then released &quot;Giving the Devil His Due&quot; which was a collection of unreleased tracks, remixes, and demos by Coal Chamber. Afterward, he went on to start the band DevilDriver.

&quot;Fiend&quot; would be the album&#x27;s only single. Its music video found airplay on &quot;Uranium&quot;, which also featured an interview with the band and the song &quot;Glow&quot; was also most notably featured on the soundtrack of &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;.

The song &quot;Something Told Me&quot; was featured on the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; end credits as the second song.

The album debuted and peaked at number 34 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling more than 31,000 copies in its first week.
