<text>Ian Hamilton Finlay (28 October 1925 – 27 March 2006) was a Scottish poet, writer, artist and gardener.

==Life==

Finlay was born in Nassau, Bahamas, to James Hamilton Finlay and his wife, Annie Pettigrew, both of Scots descent.

He was educated at Dollar Academy in Clackmannanshire and later at Glasgow School of Art. At the age of 13, with the outbreak of the Second World War, he was evacuated to family in the countryside (firstly to Gartmore and then to Kirkudbright). In 1942, he joined the British Army. Finlay was married twice and had two children, Alec and Ailie. Throughout his life, he suffered severely from agoraphobia. He died in Edinburgh in 2006. He is buried alone in Abercorn Churchyard in West Lothian, Scotland. The grave lies in the extreme south-east corner of the churchyard. The gravestone refers to his parents and sister.

==Poetry==

At the end of the war, Finlay worked as a shepherd, before beginning to write short stories and poems, while living on Rousay, in Orkney. He published his first book, &quot;The Sea Bed and Other Stories&quot;, in 1958, with some of his plays broadcast on the BBC, and some stories featured in &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot;.

His first collection of poetry, &quot;The Dancers Inherit the Party&quot;, was published in 1960 by Migrant Press with a second edition published in 1962. The third edition, published by Fulcrum Press (London) in 1969, included a number of new poems and was inaccurately described by the publisher as a first edition, which led to a complex legal dispute. &quot;Dancers&quot; was included in its entirety in a &quot;New Directions&quot; annual a few years later.

In 1963, Finlay published &quot;Rapel&quot;, his first collection of concrete poetry (poetry in which the layout and typography of the words contributes to its overall effect), and it was as a concrete poet that he first gained wide renown. Much of this work was issued through his own Wild Hawthorn Press, in his magazine &quot;Poor. Old. Tired. Horse.&quot;

Finlay became notable as a poet, when reducing the monostich form to one word with his concrete poems in the 1960s. Repetition, imitation and tradition lay at the heart of Hamilton&#x27;s poetry, and exploring &quot;the juxtaposition of apparently opposite ideas&quot;.

==Art==

Later, Finlay began to compose poems to be inscribed into stone, incorporating these sculptures into the natural environment.
This kind of &#x27;poem-object&#x27; features in the garden Little Sparta that he and Sue Finlay created together in the Pentland Hills near Edinburgh, although Finlay was always explicit that while &quot;the original brief suggests sculpture being added to the garden, but I had them revise this to the understanding that the work would be the garden itself.&quot; The five-acre garden also includes more conventional sculptures and two garden temples.

In December 2004, in a poll conducted by &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot;, a panel of fifty artists, gallery directors and arts professionals voted Little Sparta to be the most important work of Scottish art. Second and third were the Glasgow School of Art by Charles Rennie Mackintosh and &quot;The Skating Minister&quot; by Henry Raeburn. Sir Roy Strong has said of Little Sparta that it is &quot;the only really original garden made in this country since 1945&quot;.

The Little Sparta Trust plans to preserve Little Sparta for the nation by raising enough to pay for an ongoing maintenance fund. Richard Ingleby, Ian Kennedy, Magnus Linklater, and Ann Uppington are trustees. Former trustees include Ian Appleton, Stephen Bann, Stephen Blackmore, Patrick Eyres, John Leighton, Duncan Macmillan, Victoria Miro, Paul Nesbitt and Jessie Sheeler. 

Finlay&#x27;s work is notable for a number of recurring themes: a penchant for classical writers (especially Virgil); a concern with fishing and the sea; an interest in the French Revolution; and a continual revisiting of World War II and the &quot;memento mori&quot; Latin phrase &quot;Et in Arcadia ego&quot;. His 1973 screenprint of a tank camouflaged in a leaf pattern, &quot;Arcadia&quot;, referring to the Utopian Arcadia of poetry and art (another recurring theme), is described by the Tate as drawing &quot;an ironic parallel between this idea of a natural paradise and the camouflage patterns on a tank&quot;. In the 1982 exhibition &quot;The Third Reich Revisited&quot;, Nazi iconography featured on architectural drawings by Ian Appleton, with captions by Finlay which could be read as a sardonic critique of Scotland&#x27;s arts establishment.

Finlay&#x27;s use of Nazi imagery led to an accusation of neo-Nazi sympathies and antisemitism. Finlay sued a Paris magazine which had made such accusations, and was awarded nominal damages of one franc. The stress of this situation brought about the separation between Finlay and his wife Sue.

Finlay also came into conflict with the Strathclyde Regional Council over his liability for rates on a byre in his garden, which the council insisted was being used as commercial premises. Finlay insisted that it was a garden temple.

One of the few gardens outside Scotland to permanently display his work is the &quot;Improvement Garden&quot; in Stockwood Discovery Centre, Luton, created in collaboration with Sue Finlay, Gary Hincks and Nicholas Sloan.

Finlay was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1985. He was awarded honorary doctorates from Aberdeen University in 1987, Heriot-Watt University in 1993 and the University of Glasgow in 2001, and an honorary and/or visiting professorship from the University of Dundee in 1999. The French Communist Party presented him with a bust of Saint-Just in 1991. He received the Scottish Horticultural Medal from the Royal Caledonian Horticultural Society in 2002, and the Scottish Arts Council Creative Scotland Award in 2003. Finlay was appointed a CBE in the Queen&#x27;s 2002 New Year Honours.

Finlay&#x27;s work has been seen as austere, but also at times witty, or even darkly whimsical.

He is represented by the Wild Hawthorn Press, the Archive of Ian Hamilton Finlay, which works closely with the Ingleby Gallery (Edinburgh) and the Victoria Miro Gallery (London) in the U.K.

==Collaborators==
Finlay&#x27;s designs were most often built by others. Finlay respected the expertise of sandblasters, engravers and printers he worked with, having approximately one hundred collaborators including Patrick Caulfield, Richard Demarco, Malcolm Fraser, Christopher Hall, Margot Sandeman. He also worked with a host of lettering artists including Michael Harvey and Nicholas Sloan.

<text>The Rideau River (, ) is a river in Eastern Ontario, Canada. The river flows north from Upper Rideau Lake and empties into the Ottawa River at the Rideau Falls in Ottawa, Ontario. Its length is . 

As explained in a writing by Samuel de Champlain in 1613, the river was given the name &quot;Rideau&quot; () because of the appearance of the Rideau Falls. The Anishinàbemowin name for the river is .

The Rideau Canal, which allows travel from Ottawa to the city of Kingston, Ontario on Lake Ontario, was formed by joining the Rideau River with the Cataraqui River. The river diverges from the Canal at Hog&#x27;s Back Falls in Ottawa.

In early spring, to reduce flooding on the lower section of the river, workers from the city of Ottawa use ice blasting to clear the ice which covers the river from Billings Bridge to Rideau Falls by cutting &quot;keys&quot; through the ice and using explosives to break off large sheets of ice. This practice has been going on for more than 100 years.

The regulatory authority charged with protecting the Rideau River and its tributaries is the Rideau Valley Conservation Authority.

== History ==
Samuel de Champlain, who was the first European to have seen the river, named it due to the resemblance between Rideau Falls and a curtain.

In earlier times, the river was used as a transportation route between the Ottawa and Saint Lawrence River. The fertility of the lands along the banks of Rideau river attracted loyalist settlers looking for good farmlands, which led to growth of settlements in the surrounding regions. After the War of 1812, a waterway, designed by John By, was built through Rideau River connecting Kingston to Ottawa.

<text>In mathematics, the spectrum of a matrix is the set of its eigenvalues. More generally, if formula_1 is a linear operator on any finite-dimensional vector space, its spectrum is the set of scalars formula_2 such that formula_3 is not invertible. The determinant of the matrix equals the product of its eigenvalues. Similarly, the trace of the matrix equals the sum of its eigenvalues.
From this point of view, we can define the pseudo-determinant for a singular matrix to be the product of its nonzero eigenvalues (the density of multivariate normal distribution will need this quantity).

In many applications, such as PageRank, one is interested in the dominant eigenvalue, i.e. that which is largest in absolute value. In other applications, the smallest eigenvalue is important, but in general, the whole spectrum provides valuable information about a matrix.

== Definition ==

Let &quot;V&quot; be a finite-dimensional vector space over some field &quot;K&quot; and suppose &quot;T&quot; : &quot;V&quot; → &quot;V&quot; is a linear map. The &quot;spectrum&quot; of &quot;T&quot;, denoted σ&quot;T&quot;, is the multiset of roots of the characteristic polynomial of &quot;T&quot;. Thus the elements of the spectrum are precisely the eigenvalues of &quot;T&quot;, and the multiplicity of an eigenvalue &quot;λ&quot; in the spectrum equals the dimension of the generalized eigenspace of &quot;T&quot; for &quot;λ&quot; (also called the algebraic multiplicity of &quot;λ&quot;).

Now, fix a basis &quot;B&quot; of &quot;V&quot; over &quot;K&quot; and suppose &quot;M&quot; ∈ Mat&quot;K&quot;&amp;hairsp;(&quot;V&quot;) is a matrix. Define the linear map &quot;T&quot; : &quot;V&quot; → &quot;V&quot; pointwise by &quot;Tx&quot; = &quot;Mx&quot;, where on the right-hand side &quot;x&quot; is interpreted as a column vector and &quot;M&quot; acts on &quot;x&quot; by matrix multiplication. We now say that &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;V&quot; is an eigenvector of &quot;M&quot; if &quot;x&quot; is an eigenvector of &quot;T&quot;. Similarly, λ ∈ &quot;K&quot; is an eigenvalue of &quot;M&quot; if it is an eigenvalue of &quot;T&quot;, and with the same multiplicity, and the spectrum of &quot;M&quot;, written σ&quot;M&quot;, is the multiset of all such eigenvalues.

== Related notions ==
The eigendecomposition (or spectral decomposition) of a diagonalizable matrix is a decomposition of a diagonalizable matrix into a specific canonical form whereby the matrix is represented in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The spectral radius of a square matrix is the largest absolute value of its eigenvalues. In spectral theory, the spectral radius of a bounded linear operator is the supremum of the absolute values of the elements in the spectrum of that operator.

<text>In mathematics, particularly in functional analysis, the spectrum of a bounded linear operator (or, more generally, an unbounded linear operator) is a generalisation of the set of eigenvalues of a matrix. Specifically, a complex number formula_1 is said to be in the spectrum of a bounded linear operator formula_2 if formula_3

* either has &quot;no&quot; set-theoretic inverse;
* or the set-theoretic inverse is either unbounded or defined on a non-dense subset.

Here, formula_4 is the identity operator.

By the closed graph theorem, formula_1 is in the spectrum if and only if the bounded operator formula_6 is non-bijective on formula_7.

The study of spectra and related properties is known as &quot;spectral theory&quot;, which has numerous applications, most notably the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics.

The spectrum of an operator on a finite-dimensional vector space is precisely the set of eigenvalues. However an operator on an infinite-dimensional space may have additional elements in its spectrum, and may have no eigenvalues. For example, consider the right shift operator &quot;R&quot; on the Hilbert space ℓ2,
:formula_8
This has no eigenvalues, since if &quot;Rx&quot;=&quot;λx&quot; then by expanding this expression we see that &quot;x&quot;1=0, &quot;x&quot;2=0, etc. On the other hand, 0 is in the spectrum because although the operator &quot;R&quot; − 0 (i.e. &quot;R&quot; itself) is invertible, the inverse is defined on a set which is not dense in ℓ2. In fact &quot;every&quot; bounded linear operator on a complex Banach space must have a non-empty spectrum.

The notion of spectrum extends to unbounded (i.e. not necessarily bounded) operators. A complex number &quot;λ&quot; is said to be in the spectrum of an unbounded operator formula_9 defined on domain formula_10 if there is no bounded inverse formula_11 defined on the whole of formula_12 If &quot;T&quot; is closed (which includes the case when &quot;T&quot; is bounded), boundedness of formula_13 follows automatically from its existence.

The space of bounded linear operators &quot;B&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) on a Banach space &quot;X&quot; is an example of a unital Banach algebra. Since the definition of the spectrum does not mention any properties of &quot;B&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) except those that any such algebra has, the notion of a spectrum may be generalised to this context by using the same definition verbatim.

==Spectrum of a bounded operator==

===Definition===
Let formula_2 be a bounded linear operator acting on a Banach space formula_15 over the complex scalar field formula_16, and formula_4 be the identity operator on formula_15. The spectrum of formula_2 is the set of all formula_20 for which the operator formula_3 does not have an inverse that is a bounded linear operator.

Since formula_3 is a linear operator, the inverse is linear if it exists; and, by the bounded inverse theorem, it is bounded. Therefore, the spectrum consists precisely of those scalars formula_1 for which formula_3 is not bijective.

The spectrum of a given operator formula_2 is often denoted formula_26, and its complement, the resolvent set, is denoted formula_27. (formula_28 is sometimes used to denote the spectral radius of formula_2)

===Relation to eigenvalues===

If formula_1 is an eigenvalue of formula_2, then the operator formula_3 is not one-to-one, and therefore its inverse formula_13 is not defined. However, the converse statement is not true: the operator formula_34 may not have an inverse, even if formula_1 is not an eigenvalue. Thus the spectrum of an operator always contains all its eigenvalues, but is not limited to them.

For example, consider the Hilbert space formula_36, that consists of all bi-infinite sequences of real numbers
:formula_37
that have a finite sum of squares formula_38. The bilateral shift operator formula_2 simply displaces every element of the sequence by one position; namely if formula_40 then formula_41 for every integer formula_42. The eigenvalue equation formula_43 has no nonzero solution in this space, since it implies that all the values formula_44 have the same absolute value (if formula_45) or are a geometric progression (if formula_46); either way, the sum of their squares would not be finite. However, the operator formula_3 is not invertible if formula_48. For example, the sequence formula_49 such that formula_50 is in formula_36; but there is no sequence formula_52 in formula_36 such that formula_54 (that is, formula_55 for all formula_42).

=== Basic properties ===

The spectrum of a bounded operator &quot;T&quot; is always a closed, bounded subset of the complex plane.

If the spectrum were empty, then the &quot;resolvent function&quot;

:formula_57

would be defined everywhere on the complex plane and bounded. But it can be shown that the resolvent function &quot;R&quot; is holomorphic on its domain. By the vector-valued version of Liouville&#x27;s theorem, this function is constant, thus everywhere zero as it is zero at infinity. This would be a contradiction.

The boundedness of the spectrum follows from the Neumann series expansion in &quot;λ&quot;; the spectrum &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is bounded by ||&quot;T&quot;||. A similar result shows the closedness of the spectrum.

The bound ||&quot;T&quot;|| on the spectrum can be refined somewhat. The &quot;spectral radius&quot;, &quot;r&quot;(&quot;T&quot;), of &quot;T&quot; is the radius of the smallest circle in the complex plane which is centered at the origin and contains the spectrum &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) inside of it, i.e.

:formula_58, formula_59, with domain formula_60 has a discrete set of eigenvalues (the discrete spectrum formula_61, which in this case coincides with the point spectrum formula_62 since there are no eigenvalues embedded into the continuous spectrum) that can be computed by the Rydberg formula. Their corresponding eigenfunctions are called eigenstates, or the bound states. The result of the ionization process is described by the continuous part of the spectrum (the energy of the collision/ionization is not &quot;quantized&quot;), represented by formula_63 (it also coincides with the essential spectrum, formula_64).
==Spectrum of the adjoint operator==

Let &quot;X&quot; be a Banach space and formula_9 a closed linear operator with dense domain formula_66.
If &quot;X*&quot; is the dual space of &quot;X&quot;, and formula_67 is the hermitian adjoint of &quot;T&quot;, then

:formula_68

(T) = \overline{\sigma_{\mathrm{p}}(T^*)}&lt;/math&gt;. 

In particular, formula_69.}}

We also get formula_70 by the following argument: &quot;X&quot; embeds isometrically into &quot;X**&quot;. 
Therefore, for every non-zero element in the kernel of formula_3 there exists a non-zero element in &quot;X**&quot; which vanishes on formula_72. 
Thus formula_73 can not be dense.

Furthermore, if &quot;X&quot; is reflexive, we have formula_74.

==Spectra of particular classes of operators==

===Compact operators===

If &quot;T&quot; is a compact operator, or, more generally, an inessential operator, then it can be shown that the spectrum is countable, that zero is the only possible accumulation point, and that any nonzero &quot;λ&quot; in the spectrum is an eigenvalue.

===Quasinilpotent operators===

A bounded operator formula_75 is quasinilpotent if formula_76 as formula_77 (in other words, if the spectral radius of &quot;A&quot; equals zero). Such operators could equivalently be characterized by the condition

:formula_78

An example of such an operator is formula_79, formula_80 for formula_81.

===Self-adjoint operators===

If &quot;X&quot; is a Hilbert space and &quot;T&quot; is a self-adjoint operator (or, more generally, a normal operator), then a remarkable result known as the spectral theorem gives an analogue of the diagonalisation theorem for normal finite-dimensional operators (Hermitian matrices, for example).

For self-adjoint operators, one can use spectral measures to define a decomposition of the spectrum into absolutely continuous, pure point, and singular parts.

== Spectrum of a real operator ==

The definitions of the resolvent and spectrum can be extended to any continuous linear operator formula_2 acting on a Banach space formula_15 over the real field formula_84 (instead of the complex field formula_16) via its complexification formula_86. In this case we define the resolvent set formula_28 as the set of all formula_88 such that formula_89 is invertible as an operator acting on the complexified space formula_90; then we define formula_91.

=== Real spectrum ===

The &quot;real spectrum&quot; of a continuous linear operator formula_2 acting on a real Banach space formula_15, denoted formula_94, is defined as the set of all formula_95 for which formula_3 fails to be invertible in the real algebra of bounded linear operators acting on formula_15. In this case we have formula_98. Note that the real spectrum may or may not coincide with the complex spectrum. In particular, the real spectrum could be empty.

== Spectrum of a unital Banach algebra ==

Let &quot;B&quot; be a complex Banach algebra containing a unit &quot;e&quot;. Then we define the spectrum &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) (or more explicitly &quot;σ&quot;&quot;B&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) of an element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;B&quot; to be the set of those complex numbers &quot;λ&quot; for which &quot;λe&quot; − &quot;x&quot; is not invertible in &quot;B&quot;. This extends the definition for bounded linear operators &quot;B&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) on a Banach space &quot;X&quot;, since &quot;B&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is a unital Banach algebra.

<text>Operation Compass (also ) was the first large British military operation of the Western Desert Campaign (1940–1943) during the Second World War. British metropolitan, Imperial and Commonwealth forces attacked the Italian and Libyan forces of the 10th Army (Marshal Rodolfo Graziani) in western Egypt and Cyrenaica, the eastern province of Libya, from December 1940 to February 1941.

The Western Desert Force (WDF) (Lieutenant-General Richard O&#x27;Connor) with about advanced from Mersa Matruh in Egypt on a five-day raid against the Italian positions of the 10th Army, which had about in fortified posts around Sidi Barrani in Egypt and in Cyrenaica to the west. The WDF swiftly defeated the Italians in their fortified posts, at Sidi Barrani, forced the rest of the 10th Army out of Egypt and captured the ports along the Cyrenaican coast in Libya. The 10th Army was cut off as it retreated towards Tripolitania at the Battle of Beda Fomm, the remnants being pursued to El Agheila on the Gulf of Sirte.

The British took over and Libyan prisoners, hundreds of tanks, more than a thousand guns and many aircraft. The WDF suffered casualties of killed and wounded, about of the infantry. The WDF was unable to continue beyond El Agheila, due to worn out vehicles and the diversion in March 1941 of the best-equipped units to conduct Operation Lustre for the Battle of Greece. The Italians rushed reinforcements to Libya to defend Tripoli, assisted by the and the .
==Background==

===10th Army===
When war was declared, the 5th Army (General Italo Gariboldi) was in Tripolitania the western Libyan province and the 10th Army (General Mario Berti) was in Cyrenaica to the east. Once the French in Tunisia no longer posed a threat to Tripolitania, units of the 5th Army were used to reinforce the 10th Army. When the Governor-General of Libya, Italo Balbo, was killed by friendly fire, Marshal Rodolfo Graziani took his place. Graziani expressed doubts about the ability of the large non-mechanised Italian force to defeat the British, who, though fewer in numbers, were motorised. After being reinforced from the 5th Army, the 10th Army controlled the equivalent of four corps with and tanks and . The XX Corps comprised the 60th Infantry Division &quot;Sabratha&quot; and the XXI Corps was composed of the 1st CC.NN. Division &quot;23 Marzo&quot;, the 2nd CC.NN. Division &quot;28 Ottobre&quot; and the 63rd Infantry Division &quot;Cirene&quot;. XXII Corps had the 61st Infantry Division &quot;Sirte&quot; and XXIII Corps had the 4th CC.NN. Division &quot;3 Gennaio&quot; and the 64th Infantry Division &quot;Catanzaro&quot;.

The new Libyan Divisions Group () had the part-motorised and lightly armoured Maletti Group (General Pietro Maletti), the 1st Libyan Division (Major-General Luigi Sibille) and the 2nd Libyan Division (Major-General Armando Pescatori). The Maletti Group had been formed at Derna on 8 July 1940 comprising seven Libyan motorised infantry battalions, a company of Fiat M11/39 tanks, a company of L3/33 tankettes, motorised artillery and supply units, as the main motorised unit of the 10th Army. On 29 August, as more tanks arrived from Italy, the (Libyan Tank Command [Colonel Valentini]) was formed with three groups: 1st Tank Group (Colonel Aresca) with the I Tank Battalion &quot;M&quot; and the XXI, LXI, and LXII Tank battalion &quot;L&quot;, 2nd Tank Group (Colonel Antonio Trivioli), with the II Tank Battalion &quot;M&quot;, less one company and the IX, XX, and LXI Tank Battalion &quot;L&quot;s and Maletti Group with one company from the LX Tank Battalion &quot;L&quot;, one company from the II Tank Battalion &quot;M&quot;, and three Libyan infantry battalions. became part of the (Royal Corps of Libyan Colonial Troops), with the 1st Libyan Division and the 2nd Libyan Division.

===Western Desert Force===
Middle East Command (General Archibald Wavell) had about some outside Egypt, and . The RAF had composed of two squadrons of Hurricanes, one of Gloster Gladiators, three of Bristol Blenheims, three of Vickers Wellingtons and one of Bristol Bombays, about and The Western Desert Force (WDF) was commanded by Lieutenant-General Richard O&#x27;Connor with the 4th Indian Infantry Division (Major-General Noel Beresford-Peirse) and the 7th Armoured Division (Major-General Sir Michael O&#x27;Moore Creagh). From 14 December, troops of the 6th Australian Infantry Division (Major-General Iven Giffard Mackay), replaced the 4th Indian Division, which was sent to East Africa, less one brigade. The British had some fast Cruiser Mk I, Cruiser Mk II and Cruiser Mk III tanks with Ordnance QF 2-pounder guns, which were superior to Fiat M11/39 tanks. The British also had a battalion of Matilda II infantry tanks that while slow, were also equipped with the 2-pounder; the armour of the Matildas could not be penetrated by Italian anti-tank guns or field guns.

===Border skirmishes===

Italy declared war on Britain and France on 10 June 1940. During the next few months there were raids and skirmishes between Italian forces in Libya and British and Commonwealth forces in Egypt. On 12 June 1940, the Mediterranean Fleet bombarded Tobruk. The force included the cruisers and and exchanged fire with the Italian cruiser . Royal Air Force Blenheim bombers from 45, 55 and 211 squadrons, hit with one bomb. On 19 June, the British submarine fired two torpedoes at but missed. The gunners on then supported the local land-based anti-aircraft units and claimed 47 British aircraft shot down or damaged. The naval gunners also shot down a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 aircraft and killed Italo Balbo, the Governor-General of Libya and Commander-in-chief of Italian forces in North Africa.

==Prelude==

=== E===

On 13 September 1940, the Italian 10th Army advanced into Egypt in E. As the Italians advanced, the small British force at Sollum withdrew to the main defensive position east of Mersa Matruh. The Italian advance was harassed by the 3rd Coldstream Guards, attached artillery and other units. After recapturing Fort Capuzzo, the Italians advanced approximately in three days and on 16 September, the advance stopped at Maktila, beyond Sidi Barrani. The Italians dug in and awaited reinforcements and supplies along the , an extension of the () being built from the frontier. Five fortified camps were built around Sidi Barrani from Maktila, east along the coast, south to Tummar East, Tummar West and Nibeiwa; another camp was built at Sofafi on the escarpment to the south-west.

===British plan===

Following the Italian advance, Wavell ordered the commander of British Troops Egypt, Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, to plan a limited operation to push the Italians back. Operation Compass, for administrative reasons, was originally planned as a five-day raid but consideration was given to continuing the operation to exploit success. On 28 November, Wavell wrote to Wilson that,

The 7th Support Group was to observe the Italian camps on the escarpment around Sofafi, to prevent the garrisons from interfering, while the rest of the division and 4th Indian Division passed through the Sofafi–Nibeiwa gap. An Indian brigade and Infantry tanks of 7th Royal Tank Regiment (7th RTR) would attack Nibeiwa from the west, as the 7th Armoured Division protected their northern flank. Once Nibeiwa was captured, a second Indian brigade and the 7th RTR would attack the Tummars. Selby Force (3rd Battalion Coldstream Guards plus some artillery) from the Matruh garrison was to contain the enemy camp at Maktila on the coast and the Royal Navy would bombard Maktila and Sidi Barrani. Preparations were kept secret and only a few officers knew during the training exercise held from 25 to 26 November, that the objectives marked out near Matruh were replicas of Nibeiwa and Tummar; the troops were also told that a second exercise was to follow and did not know that the operation was real until 7 December, as they arrived at their jumping-off points.

Late on 8 December, an Italian reconnaissance aircrew reported that attack on Maktila and Nibeiwa was imminent but Maletti was not informed. On 9 December, the 1st Libyan Division was at Maktila and the 2nd Libyan Division was at Tummar. The Maletti Group was at Nibiewa and the 4th CC.NN. Division &quot;3 Gennaio&quot; and the headquarters of the Libyan Corps were at Sidi Barrani. The 63rd Infantry Division &quot;Cirene&quot; and the headquarters of XXI Corps were at Sofafi and the 64th Infantry Division &quot;Catanzaro&quot; was at Buq Buq. The HQ of XXIII Corps and the 2nd CC.NN. Division &quot;28 Ottobre&quot;, were in Sollum and Halfaya Pass respectively and the 62nd Infantry Division &quot;Marmarica&quot; was at Sidi Omar, south of Sollum. Berti was on sick leave and Gariboldi, the 1st CC.NN. Division &quot;23 Marzo&quot; and the 10th Army Headquarters were far back at Bardia. (By the time Berti arrived in Libya, so had the British.) Operation Compass ( / Battle of the Marmarica) began on the night of The WDF, with the 7th Armoured Division, 4th Indian Division and the 16th Infantry Brigade advanced to their start line. The RAF made attacks on Italian airfields and destroyed or damaged on the ground. Selby Force (Brigadier A. R. Selby) with (the maximum for whom transport could be found), moved up from Matruh, set up a brigade of dummy tanks in the desert and reached a position south-east of Maktila by dawn on 9 December. Maktila had been bombarded by the monitor and the gunboat ; Sidi Barrani had been bombarded by the gunboat .

==Battle of the Camps==

===Nibeiwa===

At on 9 December, a detachment of artillery commenced diversionary fire from the east on the fortified camp at Nibeiwa for an hour, which was held by the Maletti Group and at the divisional artillery began a preliminary bombardment. The 11th Indian Infantry Brigade, with 7th RTR under command, attacked Nibeiwa from the north-west, which reconnaissance had established as the weakest sector. By Nibeiwa had been captured; Maletti had been killed in the fighting along with were wounded; and Libyan soldiers were taken prisoner. Large quantities of supplies were captured for British casualties of 

===The Tummars===

The attack on Tummar West began at after the 7th RTR had refuelled and artillery had bombarded the defences for an hour. Another approach from the north-west was made and tanks broke through the perimeter, followed twenty minutes later by the infantry. The defenders held out for longer than the Nibeiwa garrison but by Tummar West was overrun except for the north-eastern corner. The tanks moved on to Tummar East, the greater part of which was captured by nightfall. The 4th Armoured Brigade had advanced to Azziziya, where the garrison of surrendered and light patrols of the 7th Hussars pushed forward to cut the road from Sidi Barrani to Buq Buq, while armoured cars of the 11th Hussars ranged further west. The tanks of 7th Armoured Brigade were held in reserve ready to intercept an Italian counter-attack. The 2nd Libyan Division suffered and killed, and wounded, with the survivors being taken prisoner.

===Maktila===

Unaware of the situation at the Tummars, Selby sent units to cut the western exits from Maktila but the 1st Libyan Division filtered through and escaped. Selby Force followed up the retreat as the 1st Libyan Division moved the from Maktila to Sidi Barrani and drove part of the column into sand dunes north of the coast road. Cruiser tanks of the 6th Royal Tank Regiment (6th RTR) arrived in a sandstorm and overran the Italians in the dunes at about then joined Selby Force to continue the pursuit. The Italian defenders were caught at Sidi Barrani, in a pocket backing on to the sea. When the British attacked again at dawn on 11 December, mass surrenders began everywhere, except at Point 90 where troops of the 2nd Libyan Division held out for a short time, after which surrendered.

===Sidi Barrani, Buq Buq and Sofafi===

On 10 December, the 16th Infantry Brigade was brought forward from 4th Indian Division reserve and with part of the 11th Indian Brigade under command, advanced in lorries to attack Sidi Barrani. While moving across exposed ground, some casualties were incurred but with support from artillery and the 7th RTR, it was in position barring the south and south western exits to Sidi Barrani by The British attacked at supported by the divisional artillery and the town fell by nightfall; the remains of the two Libyan Divisions and the 4th CC.NN. Division &quot;3 Gennaio&quot; were trapped between the 16th Infantry Brigade and Selby Force. On 11 December, Selby Force and some tanks attacked and overran the 1st Libyan Division and by the evening, the 4th CC.NN Division &quot;3 Gennaio&quot; had also surrendered. On 11 December, the 7th Armoured Brigade was ordered out of reserve to relieve the 4th Armoured Brigade in the Buq Buq area, mop up and capture large numbers of men and guns. A patrol from the 7th Support Group entered Rabia and found it empty; the 63rd Infantry Division &quot;Cirene&quot; had withdrawn from Rabia and Sofafi overnight. An order to the 4th Armoured Brigade to cut them off west of Sofafi arrived too late and the Italians were able to retire along the escarpment and join Italian forces at Halfaya. Italian casualties were killed, wounded and 

===Exploitation===
Over the next few days the 4th Armoured Brigade, on top of the escarpment and the 7th Armoured Brigade on the coast, attempted a pursuit but supply problems and the large number of prisoners (twenty times the number planned for) impeded the advance. Italian forces crowded along the coast road and retreating from Sidi Barrani and Buq Buq, were bombarded by &quot;Terror&quot; and the two gunboats, which fired on the Sollum area all day and most of the night of 11 December. Late on 12 December, the only Italian positions left in Egypt were the approaches to Sollum and the area of Sidi Omar.

The Italians had lost and Libyan casualties, most taken prisoner, and against casualties. The WDF paused to reorganise and then moved quickly west along the , through Halfaya Pass and re-captured Fort Capuzzo in Libya. On 7 December, Wellington bombers from Malta and Blenheim bombers from Egypt carried out raids on the Italian air bases at Castel Benito, Benina and El Adem, the attack on Castel Benito being particularly successful, with hits on five hangars and strafing runs which hit many Italian aircraft; the attacks continued until the end of the year.

==Pursuit==

===Sollum, Halfaya and Fort Capuzzo===


Exploitation continued by the two armoured brigades and the 7th Support Group, with the infantry of 16th Infantry Brigade (which had been detached from the 4th Indian Division) following up. By 15 December, Sollum and the Halfaya Pass had been captured and the British by-passed Italian garrisons further south in the desert. Fort Capuzzo, inland at the end of the frontier wire, was captured by 7th Armoured Division in December 1940, as it advanced westwards to Bardia. The 7th Armoured Division concentrated south-west of Bardia, waiting for the arrival of 6th Australian Division. By this time the WDF had taken and captured and while suffering casualties of and eight missing.

===Bardia===
The 6th Australian Division (Major General Iven Mackay) attacked the Italian XXIII Corps (Lieutenant-General [] Annibale Bergonzoli) at Bardia from 3 to 5 January 1941, assisted by air support, naval gunfire and artillery. The 16th Australian Infantry Brigade attacked at dawn from the west, where the defences were known to be weak. Sappers blew gaps in the barbed wire with Bangalore torpedoes, then filled in and broke down the sides of the anti-tank ditch with picks and shovels. The Australian infantry and 23 Matilda II tanks of the 7th RTR, overran the Italian defences and took The 17th Australian Infantry Brigade exploited the breach made in the perimeter and pressed south, as far as a secondary line of defences known as the Switch Line. On the second day, the 16th Australian Infantry Brigade captured Bardia, cutting the fortress in two. Thousands of prisoners were taken and the remnants of the Italian garrison held only the northern and southernmost parts of the fortress. On the third day, the 19th Australian Infantry Brigade advanced south from Bardia, supported by artillery and the remaining six Matilda tanks. The 17th Australian Infantry Brigade attacked and the two brigades reduced the southern sector of the fortress. The Italian garrisons in the north surrendered to the 16th Australian Infantry Brigade and the 7th Support Group outside the fortress; about were taken, along with and medium tanks and hundreds of motor vehicles. Italian casualties also included and wounded.

===Capture of Tobruk===

On 6 January XIII corps surrounded Tobruk, defended by XXII Corps (Enrico Mannella). After blockading the fort for a fortnight, on the night of 20/21 January, British ships led by &quot;Terror&quot; (Captain Hector Waller), bombarded Tobruk. Further out, destroyers set a trap for &quot;San Giorgio&quot; in case it tried to break out but the ship was kept in the port. On the morning of 21 January between and the British artillery bombarded the town. At the 2/3rd Australian Battalion attacked, quickly created a breach in the Italian defences and by the evening had captured half of Tobruk, On 22 January the naval command surrendered and by Generale the garrison commander had also surrendered after Mannella had been captured earlier in the day.

=== Derna–Mechili ===


The area east of the Jebel Akhdar mountains was garrisoned by XX Corps (Lieutenant-General Annibale Bergonzoli) with the 60th Infantry Division &quot;Sabratha&quot; and the Babini Group, which had The tank force included M.13/40 tanks, which needed ten days to be made battle-worthy but had been rushed forward anyway. The &quot;Sabratha&quot; Division held a line from Derna, along Wadi Derna to Mechili, with the Babini Group at Mechili, Giovanni Berta and Chaulan, guarding the flank and rear of the infantry. On 23 January, the 10th Army commander, General Giuseppe Tellera ordered a counter-attack against the British, to avoid an envelopment of XX Corps from the south. Next day, the Babini Group, with ten to fifteen of the new M.13/40s, attacked the 7th Hussars as they headed west to cut the Derna–Mechili track north of Mechili. The British swiftly retired, calling for help from the 2nd RTR, which complacently ignored the signals. The British lost several tanks and knocked out two M.13s, until eventually, the 2nd RTR mobilised, caught the Italian tanks sky-lined on a ridge and knocked out seven M.13s, for the loss of a cruiser and six light tanks.

To the north, the 2/11th Australian Battalion engaged the &quot;Sabratha&quot; Division and &quot;Bersaglieri&quot; companies of the Babini Group at Derna airfield, making slow progress against determined resistance. The 19th Australian Brigade began to arrive in the morning and Italian bombers and fighters attacked the Australians. The Italians swept the flat ground with field artillery and machine-guns, stopping the Australian advance short of the objective. On 26 January, the 2/4th Australian Battalion cut the Derna–Mechili road and a company crossed Wadi Derna during the night against bold Italian counter-attacks. The Italians disengaged on the night of before the garrison was trapped and rearguards of the Babini Group cratered roads, planted mines and booby-traps and managed to conduct several skilful ambushes, which slowed the British pursuit. Derna was occupied unopposed on 29 January and the Australians began a pursuit along the , closing on Giovanni Berta during 31 January.

===Battle of Beda Fomm===


In late January, the British learned that the Italians were retreating along the () from Benghazi. The 7th Armoured Division was dispatched to intercept the remnants of the 10th Army by moving through the desert, south of the Jebel Akhdar (Green Mountain) via Msus and Antelat, as the 6th Australian Division pursued the Italians along the coast road, north of the jebel. The terrain slowed the British tanks and Combe Force (Lieutenant-Colonel John Combe), a flying column of wheeled vehicles, was sent ahead across the chord of the jebel. Late on 5 February, Combe Force arrived at the south of Benghazi and set up road blocks near Sidi Saleh, about north of Ajedabia and south-west of Antelat; the leading elements of the 10th Army arrived thirty minutes later. Next day, the Italians attacked to break through the roadblock and continued to attack into 7 February. With British reinforcements arriving and the Australians pressing down the road from Benghazi, the remnants of the 10th Army surrendered. From Benghazi to Agedabia, the British took captured and 

==Desert operations==
===Giarabub, Kufra and Uweinat===
Italian garrisons held Giarabub south of Sollum, Kufra Oasis, Jalo at the west end of the Great Sand Sea and Murzuk, south of Tripoli. The oasis of Giarabub was attacked in January 1941 and captured in March by the 6th Australian Cavalry Regiment and an Australian infantry battalion. Further south, on the far side of the Sand Sea, the oasis of Kufra was attacked by Free French from French Equatorial Africa, in concert with Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) patrols. Kufra fell after the Capture of Kufra in March 1941. Further west, on the border with Chad, the Italian base at Murzuk was raided in January, when a patrol of the new Long Range Patrol Unit and a local sheikh travelled to rendezvous near Kayugi with a small Free French detachment. The force attacked Murzuk and destroyed three aircraft and a hangar; the French commander was killed, most of the Italians surrendered and several prisoners were taken. The raiders then shot up three forts and departed.
At Jebel Uweinat, a massif inland, at the junctions of Egypt, Libya and Sudan, were landing grounds with an Italian garrison. The base was the closest Italian outpost to Italian East Africa () and an Italian raid from Uweinat on Wadi Halfa in Sudan was possible. Destruction of the dockyards and railway workshops and the sinking of vessels on the Nile could cut the communications between Khartoum and Cairo. British patrols visited Faya and rendezvoused with another French detachment with General Philippe Leclerc for an attack on Kufra. The British were strafed by aircraft and ambushed by armoured cars of an Italian Auto-Saharan Company (), which destroyed several lorries. Leclerc decided that an attack on Kufra was not possible and the remaining British returned to Cairo, after a journey of . Kufra was captured by the French on 1 March and became the new LRDG base in April.
==Aftermath==
===Analysis===

The success of the 7th Armoured Division encouraged a belief in the Royal Tank Regiment that manoeuvre could win battles; the engagement with the Babini Group on 24 January, led to a conclusion that armoured divisions needed more artillery. No integration of tanks with infantry or the use of anti-tank guns offensively was considered necessary. The lack of cover in the desert encouraged dispersion to avoid air attack but this reduced firepower at the decisive point. Due to the lack of supplies and the shortage of transport, conservation during lulls also encouraged the use of &quot;jock columns&quot; (a small mobile force formed of a motorised infantry company, a field-gun battery and several armoured cars). The success of such columns against the Italians led to exaggerated expectations, which were confounded when German aircraft and better-equipped and -armed troops arrived in Libya. The 7th Armoured Division concluded that the defensive mentality of the Italians had justified the British taking of exceptional risks, which would be unjustified against German troops.

===Casualties===
The WDF suffered casualties of and The RAF lost comprising six Hurricane and five Gladiator fighters, three Wellington bombers, a Vickers Valentia bomber/transport and eleven Blenheim light bombers. A far larger number of aircraft became non-operational due to damage, which could not be repaired quickly for lack of spare parts, a problem made worse by the increased use of explosive bullets by the Italians. (On 14 December, a raid on Bardia by nine Blenheims cost one aircraft shot down and seven damaged by explosive bullets.) The Italian 10th Army lost at least killed, about taken prisoner and losses of and 

===Subsequent operations===

A week after the Italian surrender at Beda Fomm, the Defence Committee in London ordered Cyrenaica to be held with the minimum of forces and the surplus sent to Greece. In XIII Corps (formerly the WDF) the 6th Australian Division was fully equipped and had few losses to replace. The 7th Armoured Division had been operating for eight months, wearing out its mechanical equipment and was withdrawn to refit. Two regiments of the 2nd Armoured Division were also worn out, leaving the division with only four tank regiments. The 6th Australian Division went to Greece in March, with a brigade group of the 2nd Armoured Division containing the best equipment. The remainder of the division and the new 9th Australian Division, minus two of its three brigades and most of its transport, sent to Greece, had two under-equipped brigades of the 7th Australian Division attached. The division took over in Cyrenaica, on the assumption that the Italians could not begin a counter-offensive until May, even with German reinforcements.

The 3rd Armoured Brigade of the 2nd Armoured Division was left in Cyrenaica comprising an under-strength light tank regiment, a second regiment using captured Italian tanks and from mid-March a cruiser tank regiment, also equipped with worn-out tanks. The 2nd Support Group had only one motor battalion, a field artillery regiment, one anti-tank battery and a machine-gun company; most of the divisional transport had been sent to Greece. A few thousand men of the 10th Army escaped the disaster in Cyrenaica but the 5th Army in Tripolitania had four divisions. The Sirte, Tmed Hassan and Buerat strongholds were reinforced from Italy, which brought the Italian armies up to about German reinforcements were sent to Libya to form a blocking detachment () under Directive 22 (11 January), these being the first units of the ( Erwin Rommel). On 25 March 1941, Graziani was replaced by Gariboldi.

<doc id="206147" wikidata="Q324571" url="?curid=206147" title="John Walker (painter)">
<text>John Walker (born 1939) is an English painter and printmaker. He has been called &quot;one of the standout abstract painters of the last 50 years.&quot;

==Education and early work==

Walker studied in Birmingham at the Moseley School of Art, and later the Birmingham School of Art and Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris. Some of his early work was inspired by abstract expressionism and post-painterly abstraction, and often combined apparently three-dimensional shapes with &quot;flatter&quot; elements. These pieces are usually rendered in acrylic paint.

==Career== 
In the early 1970s, Walker made a series of large &quot;Blackboard Pieces&quot; using chalk first exhibited at the opening of Ikon Gallery, in Birmingham Shopping Centre, Birmingham in 1972 and the &quot;Juggernaut&quot; works which also use dry pigment. From the late 1970s, his work marked allusions to earlier painters, such as Francisco Goya, Édouard Manet and Henri Matisse, either through the quoting of a pictorial motif, or the use of a particular technique . Also during this time, he began to use oil paint more in his work . His paintings of the 1970s are also notable for what has come to be termed canvas collage – the application of glued-on, separately painted patches of canvas to the main canvas (see the external link below for an example and image) .

After spending some time in Australia, Walker got a position at the Victoria College of the Arts in Melbourne. He produced the &quot;Oceania&quot; series around this time which incorporates elements of native Oceanic art.

Walker taught painting and was the head of the graduate painting program at Boston University.

Walker won the 1976 John Moores Painting Prize and was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1985.

==Exhibitions and collections==

In September 2010, Walker and five other British artists including Howard Hodgkin, John Hoyland, Ian Stephenson, Patrick Caulfield and R.B. Kitaj were included in an exhibition entitled &quot;The Independent Eye: Contemporary British Art From the Collection of Samuel and Gabrielle Lurie,&quot; at the Yale Center for British Art.

<text>The greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis), or simply the bilby, is a long-eared, rabbit-like mammal native to Australia. It lives in burrows and is active at night, feeding on insects, fruit, or fungi. The bilby is a marsupial and carries its young in a pouch. Threats include habitat loss, disease, and introduced predators such as foxes. Formerly widespread, bilbies are now restricted to arid parts of northwestern and central Australia.

It is commonly called &quot;bilby&quot; after the lesser bilby (&quot;Macrotis leucura&quot;) became extinct in the 1950s. Other names include dalgyte, pinkie, or rabbit-eared bandicoot.

== Etymology and other names==
The term &quot;bilby&quot; is a loan word from the Yuwaalaraay Aboriginal language of northern New South Wales, meaning long-nosed rat. In Western Australia it is also known as &quot;dalgyte&quot; by the Noongar people from their word &quot;djalkat&quot;, and as &quot;ninu&quot; by the remote Kiwirrkurra people. The Wiradjuri of New South Wales also call it &quot;bilby&quot;. Other names include pinkie and rabbit-eared bandicoot. It is called &quot;mankarr&quot; by the Manjilijarra people of Western Australia.

== Taxonomy ==
=== Nomenclature ===
A scientific description of the greater bilby was first published in 1837 by a Mr J. Reid. Reid based his description on a specimen that he erroneously stated to have come from Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania), where the species has not occurred in historical times. As all bandicoot species were then placed in a broadly circumscribed &quot;Perameles&quot;, Reid placed the bilby there too. However, noting how different it was from other members of the genus, he added that &quot;should more of the same form be discovered, the above characters would constitute a subgenus to which the name of &quot;Macrotis&quot; might be applied&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;lagotis&quot; was chosen &quot;from its resemblance to the Rabbit&quot;.

The following year, Richard Owen read a paper before the Zoological Society of London, in which he proposed to erect a new genus for this species, named &quot;Thylacomys&quot;. This name was widely adopted and remained in use for many years. Thus it was that when B. Arthur Bensley erected a subfamily to hold the genus in 1903, he named it Thylacomyinae. This name remains valid, and has since been promoted to family rank as Thylacomyidae, but &quot;Thylacomys&quot; itself is no longer considered valid, as Reid&#x27;s original paper is held to have established the generic name &quot;Macrotis&quot;. Thus the currently accepted scientific name for the species is &quot;Macrotis lagotis&quot;.

=== Classification ===
The placement of bilbies within the Peramelemorphia has changed in recent years. Vaughan (1978) and Groves and Flannery (1990) both placed this family within the family Peramelidae. Kirsch et al. (1997) found them to be distinct from the species in Peroryctidae (which is now a subfamily in Peramelidae). McKenna and Bell (1997) also placed it in Peramelidae, but as the sister of &quot;Chaeropus&quot; in the subfamily Chaeropodinae.

== Description ==
Greater bilbies have the characteristics of long bandicoot muzzle and very long ears. They are about in length. Compared to bandicoots, they have a longer tail, bigger ears, and softer, silky fur. The size of their ears allows them to have better hearing as well. At , the male is about the same size as a rabbit; although male animals in good condition have been known to grow up to in captivity. The female is smaller, and weighs around . Bilbies have an excellent sense of smell and sharp hearing. Their fur is blue-grey with patches of tan and is very soft. The tail is black and white with a distinct crest.

Unlike bandicoots, they are excellent burrowers and can build extensive tunnel systems with their strong forelimbs and well-developed claws. A bilby typically makes several burrows within its home range, up to about a dozen; and moves between them, using them for shelter both from predators and the heat of the day. The female bilby&#x27;s pouch faces backward, which prevents her pouch from getting filled with dirt while she is digging.

== Ecology ==
=== Habitat ===
Once widespread in arid, semi-arid and relatively fertile areas covering 70 per cent of mainland Australia, by 1995 the bilby was restricted to arid regions and classed as a threatened species. Before the extreme contraction of its range to remote northern desert areas, the species was well known around Adelaide, especially in the city parklands, and it was also recorded as living around Perth.

It makes its home in a burrow that spirals down, making it hard for its predators to get in.

The bilby prefers arid habitats because of the spinifex grass and the acacia shrubs.

=== Diet ===
Greater bilbies are nocturnal omnivores that do not need to drink water, as they get all the moisture they need from their food, which includes insects and their larvae, seeds, spiders, termites, bulbs, fruit, fungi, and very small animals. Most food is found by digging or scratching in the soil, and using their very long tongues.

They smell out witchetty grubs in roots of wattles and lancewood, and bite open the roots to get the grubs.

==Behaviour==
Greater bilbies are generally solitary marsupials; however, there are some cases in which they travel in pairs. These pairs usually consist of two females, and these females are the sole caregivers of their offspring. Mating occurs between pairs of similar dominance, with females rebuffing lower-ranked males. Much of the plant diet of the bilby is facilitated by fires that occasionally run through Australian regions and facilitate the regrowth of plants that the bilby prefers. They are also a highly motile species when it comes to foraging, with females travelling on average 1.5  km between burrows and male travelling up to 5  km. The difference in male and female motility is most likely due to the fact that males are often in search of mates and need to only care for themselves, while females are responsible for their offspring and must work to support them. Communication remains difficult between bilbies due to poor eyesight, but since these marsupials usually live alone or in very small groups, this obstacle is not incredibly formidable. Any communication that does occur is mostly olfactory between males or auditory. The scent markings implemented by male bilbies primarily function as a mode of communication between members of the same sex, since female bilbies rarely take heed of such signals and males are never aggressive towards their female counterparts.

=== Life cycle ===
In captivity, bilbies typically live for at least six years with some specimens reaching ten years of age. However, wild caught bilbies tend to be less than 12 months old. Females become reproductively active at six months of age and can breed all year round if conditions are favourable.

Greater bilbies have a very short gestation period of about 12–14 days, one of the shortest among mammals. The young are only long and very underdeveloped when they are born. They must crawl to the mother&#x27;s pouch and latch onto one of her eight teats. They leave the pouch after 70–75 days and remain in the natal burrow for two to three weeks before becoming independent. Litters usually consist of one to three joeys and females can have up to four litters per year in favourable conditions.

== Aboriginal names ==
The Warumungu people of the Tennant Creek area call this animal, &quot;warrikirti&quot;, and hunted it by digging up its burrows, or using &quot;goanna dogs&quot; (small dogs) to go down the burrows. The bilbies would then be caught by boomerang.

== Conservation ==
===Status===
Greater bilbies are a vulnerable species as classified by IUCN, their existence threatened by habitat loss and change as well as the competition with other animals. The main threats are cited as &quot;Livestock farming &amp; ranching&quot; and &quot;Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases&quot;. However, the biggest threat to the bilby is believed to be predation by introduced predators, such as red foxes, with changing fire regimes and pastoralism being landscape-scale variables that also impact bilby distribution and population. There is a national recovery plan for saving these animals: this program includes breeding in captivity, monitoring populations, and re-establishing bilbies where they once lived.

The species is also listed as vulnerable under the Commonwealth &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot;, with a species recovery plan published in 2007. Under state and territory legislation, it is extinct in New South Wales, endangered in Queensland, and vulnerable in the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia.

Save the Bilby Fund CEO Kevin Bradley estimated in December 2021 that the animal had been pushed back to around 10% of their former range, which covered 70% of Australia.

===Conservation programs and efforts===
The bilby has been popularised as a native alternative to the Easter Bunny by selling chocolate Easter Bilbies. Haigh&#x27;s Chocolates in Adelaide made 950,000 chocolate bilbies between 1993 and Easter 2020, with proceeds donated to the Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia, which does environmental work to protect the indigenous biodiversity of Australia. A National Bilby Day is held in Australia on the second Sunday in September to raise funds for conservation projects.

Reintroduction efforts have been successful in South Australia, with 16 bilbies released onto Thistle Island in 1997, and 9 released into the Arid Recovery Reserve near Roxby Downs in 2000. The Arid Recovery population&#x27;s gene pool has been expanded by two additional releases in 2010 and 2020, the latter from the thriving population on Thistle Island. From 2001 to 2003, 19 bilbies were introduced into the Venus Bay Conservation Park at Venus Bay on the Eyre Peninsula. Bilbies have been bred at Monarto Zoo and (since 2009) at Cleland Wildlife Park.

Bilbies were also introduced into the Currawinya National Park in Queensland, with six bilbies released into the feral-free sanctuary in early February 2006. In July 2012 it was reported that the population at Currawinya has been affected by feral cats that had gained access into the protected area after the wire netting had rusted after flooding. The high-salinity flood water had pooled around sections of the fencing, and once parts of it had rusted the cats had entered the reserve through the holes. Surveys found no bilbies in April nor July, when the cats were discovered. As of July 2015 there were 75 bilbies ready to be released into the enclosure, but with at least six cats remaining after around 30 were culled, release was being held back.

The Charleville Bilby Experience at Charleville, Queensland, run by the Save the Bilby Fund, has a breeding program, with the first set of twins born in December 2021. Babies born here are sometimes transferred to Currawinya.

Successful reintroductions have also occurred onto Peron Peninsula in Western Australia as a part of Western Shield. Successful reintroductions have also occurred on other conservation lands, including islands and the Australian Wildlife Conservancy&#x27;s Scotia and Yookamurra Sanctuaries. There is a highly successful bilby breeding program at Kanyana Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre, near Perth.

The knowledge of the Martu people of the Western Desert has been incorporated into models that predict bilby distributions.

<text>Uparaja is a noble title reserved for the viceroy in India and the Buddhist dynasties in Burma, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand, as well as some of their minor tributary kingdoms. It is ultimately from Sanskrit उपराज &quot;upa-rāja&quot; equivalent to and respectively in Latin.

== India ==
The viceroy in the Indian Magadha Empire was titled Uparaja (lit. vice king).

==Burma==
The Great Deputy King, in full Maha Uparaja Anaukrapa Ainshe Min, incorrectly interpreted as Crown Prince by Europeans, and addressed as His Royal Highness, was the single highest rank among the Min-nyi Min-tha, i.e. princes of the royal blood. It is shortened to Ainshe Min (, ).

However, the position was not reserved for the highest birth rank (if there is one, &quot;Shwe Kodaw-gyi Awratha&quot;, i.e. eldest son of the sovereign, by his chief Queen), nor did it carry a plausible promise of succession, which was usually only settled in an ultimate power struggle.

==Cambodia==
The word Ouparach () is derived from both Sanskrit and Pali languages, literally means &quot;Vice King&quot;, who obtains the position following the crowned king. The full term of Ouparach in order to provide the proper honor is Samdach Preah Ouparach () or Samdach Preah Moha Ouparach (). According to tradition of Kingdom of Cambodia, Samdach Preah Moha Ouparach positions as the supreme official controlling other high and low officials.

== Siam (Thailand) ==

Uparat (; ), in full Phra Maha Upparat (), as pronounced in historical Siam, translates to viceroy. Front Palace (; ), however, was the more usual designation, often referred to in English as Second King or Vice King.

The office was discontinued in 1876 by Rama V, following the Front Palace Crisis of 1874, in favour of the office of Crown Prince of Siam (; ). Note that those serving vice a king constitute a different office, that of regent or regency council.

<doc id="206156" wikidata="Q7797704" url="?curid=206156" title="Three Princes of the Kingdom of Laos">
<text>The Three Princes was a name given to Princes Boun Oum, Souvanna Phouma and Souphanouvong who represented respectively the royalist, neutralist and communist factions in the Kingdom of Laos in the post-WWII period, especially during Laotian Civil War. The trio were named by King Sisavang Vatthana to form a coalition government following the independence of Laos.

==Background and Representatives==

The Three Princes represented three different political factions during the Laotian Civil War (1959–75), which was fought between the communist Pathet Lao (including many North Vietnamese of Lao ancestry) and the Royal Lao Government. Both sides received heavy external support in what became one of many proxy wars of the Cold War. It is known as the Secret War among the CIA Special Activities Division and Hmong veterans of the conflict.

===Prince Boun Oum Na Champasak===
Prince Boun Oum (also Prince Boun Oum Na Champassak) was the son of King Ratsadanay, and hereditary prince of Champassak, who served as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos from 1948–1950 and again in 1960–1962. The right-wing Prince, cousin to the other two princes, overthrew the Phouma Government in 1960 which was supported by Lao leaders Phoui Sananikone and General Phoumi Nosavan, and the Hmong leader General Vang Pao.

===Prince Souvanna Phouma===
Prince Souvanna Phouma was the leader of the neutralist faction and Prime Minister of Laos several times (1951–1954, 1956–1958, 1960, and 1962–1975). The Prince was supported by Kong Le and the Royal Lao Government.

===Prince Souphanouvong===
Prince Souphanouvong, unlike his half-brothers, was born to a commoner without royal lineage, Mom Kham Ouane. He was the figurehead president of Laos from December 1975 to August 1991. A staunch communist and the leader of the Pathet Lao, he was supported by Kaysone Phomvihane (later Prime Minister and President of the LPDR) and the North Vietnamese. By 1972, the Pathet Lao found it unacceptable to form a coalition with rightist members, mostly military generals and the rich and powerful Na Champassak and Sananikone families.

<text>The French Union () was a political entity created by the French Fourth Republic to replace the old French colonial empire system, colloquially known as the &quot;French Empire&quot; (). It was &quot;de jure&quot; the end of the &quot;indigenous&quot; () status of French subjects in colonial areas. It was dissolved in 1958, after the downfall of the Fourth Republic.

==Composition==

The French Union had five components:
# Metropolitan France, which included the French mainland, Corsica, and the four departments of French Algeria.
# &#x27;Old&#x27; colonies, notably those of the French West Indies in the Caribbean, that became overseas departments in 1946: Guadeloupe, Guiana, Martinique, and Réunion.
# &#x27;New&#x27; colonies, renamed overseas territories: Chad, Comoros, Congo, Dahomey, French India, French Polynesia, French Somaliland, Gabon, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mauritania, New Caledonia, Niger, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Senegal, French Sudan, Ubangi-Shari, and Upper Volta.
# Associated states: Members of French Indochina: State of Vietnam, Kingdom of Laos, and Kingdom of Cambodia.
# United Nations Trust Territories, such as French Cameroons and French Togoland, but not the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, which was &quot;De Facto&quot; dissolved in April of 1946. These Trust Territories are the successors of the League of Nations mandates.

==History==
The French Union was established by the French constitution of 27 October 1946 (Fourth Republic). Under it, it was said that there were no French colonies, but that metropolitan France, the overseas departments, and the overseas territories combined to create a single French Union, or just one France.

The goal of this union was &quot;assimilation of the overseas territories into a greater France, inhabited by French citizens, and blessed by French culture&quot;. Whereas the British colonial system had local colonial governments which would eventually evolve into separate national governments, France wanted to create a single government under a single French state.

This French Union had a President, a High Council, and an Assembly. The President was the President of the Republic. The Assembly of the Union had membership from the Council of the Republic, from the National Assembly and from regional assemblies of the overseas territories and departments but ultimately had no power. The High Council ultimately met only three times, first in 1951. The Assembly was the only actually functioning institution that could manage legislation within the overseas territories.

In reality, the colonial areas had representation but all power remained in the French Parliament and thus was centralized. The colonies had local assemblies but these had only limited local power. Instead, various natives of the overseas territories in metropolitan France grew into a group of elites, known as .

On 31 January 1956, in response to the Algerian War, the system changed, abandoning assimilation in favour of autonomy, allowing territories to develop their own local government and eventually gain their independence. This adjustment would not succeed, however, and in 1958 the French Union was replaced by the French Community by Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Fifth Republic wherein France was now a federation of states with their own self-government.

== Contemporary views on the French Union ==
The limited democratic reforms and increased investment in the French colonies brought about by the formation of the French Union did receive some support from African leaders at the time. For instance, Félix Houphouet-Boigny, at the time a member of the French National Assembly, was very supportive of France&#x27;s investment in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire through the Central Fund for France Overseas, which disbursed over 600Bn Francs to French colonies. He was also supportive of the greater democratic freedoms that were granted to Africans within the Union, such as new elected territorial assemblies.

Leopold Senghor was similarly supportive of the French Union, and after visiting Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in 1952, believed that cooperation between France and its colony was mutually beneficial and that such French assistance should be &quot;extended...to all the territories of the Federation&quot;.

Yet more support for the French Union came from French Togoland, now Togo, where in June 1955 the locally elected Territorial Assembly voted unanimously on a motion to remain within France&#x27;s sphere of influence.

On the other hand, there did exist popular resistance to the French Union. According to Louisa Rice, the increase in the number of African students being educated in France following the Union&#x27;s formation resulted in a realisation among them of the contradiction between the colonial narrative of equality and reality, thus heightening resistance to its supposedly egalitarian institutions. A concrete example of this resistance occurred on Bastille Day 1952, when a group of West African students returning home by ship were excluded from celebrations due to them travelling in third class. The students argued that they were discriminated against because of their race, yet the ship&#x27;s captain viewed these allegations with surprise, thinking that their exclusion was merely due to the ship&#x27;s &quot;interior order which had nothing to do with racist theories&quot;. This example is a microcosm of differing contemporary opinions of the French Union. On the one hand there is a view that all citizens of the Union, be they French or African, are equal and are treated as such. On the other, that it was institutionally exclusionary towards Africans, and that despite ostensible changes, the French Union was merely a continuation of colonialism under a new guise.

Furthermore, there was a view among French officials that the French Union constituted an important part of a wider European economic and political project, that is, the European Economic Community (EEC). Indeed, according to Peo Hansen and Stefan Jonsson, at the genesis of the EEC, the integration of Africa into the economic bloc was an important strategic goal for its architects and supporters.

One of these supporters, French Foreign Minister Christian Pineau, said in 1957 that the continued development of Africa by Europe would turn the continent into &quot;an essential factor in world politics&quot;, and the alleviation of poverty would help to ward off communist influence. Here we can see that the French Union was viewed by the French government as a useful tool to both consolidate European economic integration and fight the Cold War.

The model of the EEC was also used by African leaders to justify their countries&#x27; continued membership of the French Union. For instance, Houphouet-Boigny wrote in 1957 that by &quot;relinquish[ing] a part of their sovereignty&quot;, European countries would bring about &quot;a more fully elaborated form of civilization which is more advantageous for their peoples&quot; that goes beyond backward nationalism. Senghor echoes this view, arguing that &quot;it would be pointless to cultivate particularism in Africa&quot;, and that instead there should be a goal to remove borders entirely, forming a large economic/political bloc. Here we can see a view that greater integration into economic and political blocs, such as the French Union and the EEC, was viewed by both French officials and some African leaders as progressive, forward thinking, and within their interests to do so.

==Withdrawals from the French Union==
* Cambodia withdrew on 25 September 1955.
* South Vietnam withdrew on 9 December 1955.
* Laos withdrew on 11 May 1957 by amending its constitution.

== Youth Council ==

The Youth Council of the French Union (, abbreviated CJUF) was a coordinating body of youth organizations in the French Union. CJUF was founded in 1950. The organization had its headquarters in Paris and held annual congresses.

== Aftermath of the French Union and the French Community ==
In 1958, the French Fourth Republic was replaced by a new Fifth Republic, characterised by a stronger presidential system, led by President Charles De Gaulle. A constitutional referendum was held on 28 September 1958 to replace the French Union, as part of a wider referendum across the French Union (including the Metropole) on whether to adopt the new French Constitution; if accepted, colonies would become part of the new French Community; if rejected, the territory would be granted independence.

All major political parties in each respective country, except two in Guinea and Niger, supported a yes vote in the 1958 constitutional referendum, seeking a looser form of autonomy rather than the system of close relations dominated by French influence.

The referendum proposal was overwhelmingly approved by upward of 90% of the population in most but not all of the territories. Even in Niger, where the main organised political force opposed the replacing of the French Union with the French Community, the new constitution was supported by a clear majority. However, in Guinea, where the leading political activists preferred immediate and complete independence, the results showed that more than 95% of voters voted against the constitution, with a turnout of 85.5%.

In response to the result in Guinea, French officials destroyed furniture, lightbulbs and windows. Any crockery, medical equipment or documents that could not be carried were also destroyed and over 3,000 French civil servants and army health officials left the country. This only reinforced anti colonial sentiment inside of Guinea, and Ahmed Sékou Touré would continue to urge other African nations to declare independence.

The former west and central African colonies after the passage of the referendum formed a short-lived organisation in 1959 called the Union of Central African Republics, replacing the bloc of French Equatorial Africa that existed as a subsection of the French Union and became part of the new French Community.

Within metropolitan France, most political parties supported the proposed changes to the constitution, most significantly those of ascendant Charles De Gaulle as well as the majority of the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO, or Socialist Party). Notable opposing forces were the French Communist Party as well as a smaller section of socialists that included the future President of France, François Mitterrand. Opposition to the changes were split between those who wanted complete independence for the African former colonies, mainly those on the French left and then those who opposed any change to the existing system of the French union at all, mostly positioned on the right.

De Gaulle successfully argued that his position on creating a French Community as opposed to the continuance of the French Union, as a sensible and moderate compromise. However, the new French Community did not last long, with most African states leaving the organisation by 1962, preferring complete independence.  The French Constitution was changed to remove any mention of the French Community in the 1990s. The Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie is based on promotion of the French language, and includes states and parts of states which were not part of the French Union in 1946 or 1958, or in some cases never French colonies or protectorates.

<text>Chiang Rai (, ; , ) is the northernmost major city in Thailand, with a population of about 200,000 people. It is located in Mueang Chiang Rai District, Chiang Rai Province. Chiang Rai was established as a capital city in the reign of King Mangrai, in 1262 CE.

==History==

The city was founded by King Mangrai in 1262 and became the capital of the Mangrai Dynasty. The word &#x27;Chiang&#x27; means &#x27;city&#x27; in Thai, so Chiang Rai would mean &#x27;the City of (Mang) Rai&#x27;. Subsequently, Chiang Rai was conquered by Burma and remained under Burmese rule for several hundred years. It was not until 1786 that Chiang Rai became a Siam vassal. Siam (later Thailand) annexed the Kingdom of Chiang Mai in 1893 as a Monthon, which Chiang Rai joined later in 1910. It&#x27;s not before 1933 that Chiang Rai became a full province of Thailand.

In 1432, during the reign of King Sam Fang Kaen of the Mangrai Dynasty (1402–1441), the Phra Kaeo, or Emerald Buddha, the most revered Buddha statue, was discovered in Chiang Rai when an earthquake split the chedi at Wat Phra Kaeo of Chiang Rai city. The jade figure was then seen concealed within. Another telling of the story has the &quot;Emerald Buddha&quot; hastily covered in mud just before marauders entered to pillage. Many years later, the clunky-looking mud Buddha was found to actually house a magnificent jade statue, perhaps by way of the earthquake mentioned above—which caused a piece of the clay to break off—revealing the jade beneath.

In 1992, the city pillar was moved from Wat Klang Wiang to Wat Phra That Doi Chom Thong, where it is known as Sadue Mueang (), the &quot;navel&quot; or &quot;omphalos&quot; of the city.

==Geography==
Chiang Rai lies on the flat alluvial plain of the Kok River, a tributary of the Mekong, between the Daen Lao Range in the north and the Phi Pan Nam Range in the south. The Kok River runs along Chiang Rai&#x27;s north side, flowing eastwards out of Burma at Tha Ton(ท่าตอม) town, bending north-eastwards and joining the Mekong River about north-east of the city. The Lao River, a tributary of the Kok, flows south of Chiang Rai.

There are four bridges spanning the Kok River within the town&#x27;s boundaries, each running south–north. Most of the terrain surrounding Chiang Rai town is either flat or has moderate hills. The exception is outward in the west and north-west directions, where limestone hills are evident, some of which have vertical exposed cliffs. That is also the direction where most of the region&#x27;s hill tribe people have their villages, further afield.

The city is north of Bangkok, about north-east of Chiang Mai, south of Mae Sai and the Burmese border; south-west of the town of Chiang Saen on the Mekong River across from Laos; and north of Phayao town. The Golden Triangle, the tripoint of the Thailand, Laos and Myanmar borders, is north-east of the city.

==Climate==
Chiang Rai has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;). Winters are fairly dry and warm. Temperatures rise until April, which is hot with the average daily maximum at . The monsoon season runs from late April through October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm.
Snow has been first recorded in 1955.

==Demographics==
According to the Thai National Statistical Office, as of September 2010, Chiang Rai municipal district had a population of 199,699. With the spread of the city extending into neighboring districts, the metropolitan area is considered somewhat larger by local residents. Chiang Rai city is the capital city and business center of the Chiang Rai Province, home to 1.1 million residents.

A significant share—12.5 percent—of the population are of hill tribes descent. &quot;Hill tribes&quot; is a collective term for the minority ethnic groups in north Thailand such as the Karen, Akha, Lisu, Miao, and Hmong.

==Government==
Chiang Rai City is the capital of Chiang Rai Province.

The city hall houses the provincial offices. The thesaban houses the municipal offices .

==Transportation==
Route 1 runs from Bangkok through Chiang Rai to Mae Sai on the Burma border. Chiang Rai is 839 kilometers from Bangkok, about 14 hours by car or by bus. According to official bus schedules, the bus ride to Chiang Rai from Chiang Mai takes approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes, All of these times should take into account the rainy season which lasts from about June to late October, this can severely inhibit travel with road sections often completely flooded and even washed out.

Several flights are available to and from Bangkok daily. Chiang Rai International Airport flight time is about 1 hour and 30 minutes. There are several major operators including Thai Airways, Air Asia, Nok Air.

There is scheduled boat service between Chiang Rai and Thaton in Chiang Mai Province daily. This journey will last about 3–4 hours and is a pleasant alternative to the bus ride through the mountains.

There are currently no rail services to Chiang Rai as the railway line from Bangkok ends at Chiang Mai. Nonetheless, new 323 kilometer-long branch line, from Den Chai to the Lao border at Chiang Khong and passing through Chiang Rai, is under construction and is expected to open in 2028.

<text>The Most Sacred Heart of Jesus () is one of the most widely practised and well-known Catholic devotions, wherein the heart of Jesus Christ is viewed as a symbol of &quot;God&#x27;s boundless and passionate love for mankind&quot;. This devotion to Christ is predominantly used in the Catholic Church, followed by high church Anglicans, and some Western Rite Orthodox. In the Latin Church, the liturgical Solemnity of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus is celebrated on the third Friday after Pentecost. The 12 promises of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus are also popular.

The devotion is especially concerned with what the church deems to be the long-suffering love and compassion of the heart of Christ towards humanity. The popularization of this devotion in its modern form is derived from a Roman Catholic nun from France, Margaret Mary Alacoque, who said she learned the devotion from Jesus during a series of apparitions to her between 1673 and 1675, and later, in the 19th century, from the mystical revelations of another Catholic nun in Portugal, Mary of the Divine Heart, a religious sister of the congregation of the Good Shepherd, who requested in the name of Christ that Pope Leo XIII consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Predecessors to the modern devotion arose unmistakably in the Middle Ages in various facets of Catholic mysticism, particularly with Gertrude the Great.

==Description==
The Sacred Heart is often depicted in Christian art as a flaming heart shining with divine light, pierced by the lance-wound, encircled by the crown of thorns, surmounted by a cross, and bleeding. Sometimes, the image is shown shining within the bosom of Christ with his wounded hands pointing at the heart. The wounds and crown of thorns allude to the manner of Christ&#x27;s passion, while the flames represent a furnace of ardent love.

==History of the devotion==
===Early devotion===
Historically, the devotion to the Sacred Heart is an outgrowth of devotion to what is believed to be Christ&#x27;s sacred humanity. During the first ten centuries of Christianity, there is nothing to indicate that any worship was rendered to the wounded Heart of Jesus. The revival of religious life and the zealous activity of Bernard of Clairvaux and Francis of Assisi in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, together with the enthusiasm of the Crusaders returning from the Holy Land, gave a rise to devotion to the Passion of Jesus Christ and particularly to practices in honour of the Sacred Wounds.

Devotion to the Sacred Heart developed out of the devotion to the Holy Wounds, in particular to the Sacred Wound in the side of Jesus. The first indications of devotion to the Sacred Heart are found in the eleventh and twelfth centuries in the fervent atmosphere of the Benedictine or Cistercian monasteries. It is impossible to say with certainty what were its first texts or who were its first devotees.

Bernard of Clairvaux ( 1153) said that the piercing of Christ&#x27;s side revealed his goodness and the charity of his heart for humanity. The earliest known hymn to the Sacred Heart, , is believed to have been written by the Norbertine Herman Joseph (d. 1241) of Cologne, Germany. The hymn begins: &quot;I hail Thee kingly Heart most high.&quot;

From the 13th to the 16th centuries, the devotion was propagated but it did not seem to have been embellished. It was everywhere practised by individuals and by different religious congregations, such as the Franciscans, Dominicans, and Carthusians. Among the Franciscans the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus has its champions in Bonaventure (d. 1274) in his (&quot;Mystic Vine&quot;) and John de la Verna. Bonaventure wrote: &quot;Who is there who would not love this wounded heart? Who would not love in return Him, who loves so much?&quot; It was, nevertheless, a private, individual devotion of the mystical order. Nothing of a general movement had been inaugurated, except for similarities found in the devotion to the Five Holy Wounds by the Franciscans, in which the wound in Jesus&#x27;s heart figured most prominently.

Bonaventure&#x27;s (a part from which is the reading for the Divine Office on the Solemnity of the Sacred Heart) refers to the heart as the fountain from which God&#x27;s love poured into one&#x27;s life:

====Lutgarde====
According to Thomas Merton, Lutgarde (d. 1246), a Cistercian mystic of Aywieres, Belgium, was one of the great precursors of the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. A contemporary of Francis of Assisi, she &quot;entered upon the mystical life with a vision of the pierced Heart of the Saviour, and had concluded her mystical espousals with the Incarnate Word by an exchange of hearts with Him.&quot; Sources say that Christ came in a visitation to Lutgarde, offering her whatever gift of grace she should desire; she asked for a better grasp of Latin, that she might better understand the word of God and sing God&#x27;s praise. Christ granted her request and Lutgarde&#x27;s mind was flooded with the riches of psalms, antiphons, readings, and responsories. However, a painful emptiness persisted. She returned to Christ, asking to return his gift, and wondering if she might, just possibly, exchange it for another. &quot;And for what would you exchange it?&quot; Christ asked. &quot;Lord, I would exchange it for your Heart.&quot; Christ then reached into Lutgarde and, removing her heart, replaced it with his own, at the same time hiding her heart within his breast.

====Mechtilde====
Mechtilde of Helfta (d. 1298) became an ardent devotee and promoter of Jesus&#x27; heart after it was the subject of many of her visions. The idea of hearing the heartbeat of God was very important to medieval saints who nurtured devotion to the Sacred Heart. Mechtilde reported that Jesus appeared to her in a vision and commanded her to love him ardently, and to honor his sacred heart in the Blessed Sacrament as much as possible. He gave her his heart as a pledge of his love, as a place of refuge during her life and as her consolation at the hour of her death. From this time Mechtilde had an extraordinary devotion for the Sacred Heart, and said that if she had to write down all the favors and all the blessings which she had received by means of this devotion, a large book would not contain them.

====Gertrude====

Gertrude the Great was an early devotee of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Book 2 of the &quot;Herald of Divine Love&quot; () vividly describes Gertrude&#x27;s visions, which show a considerable elaboration on the hitherto ill-defined veneration of Christ&#x27;s heart. Bernard articulated this in his commentary on the &quot;Song of Songs&quot;. The women of Helfta – Gertrude foremost, who surely knew Bernard&#x27;s commentary, and to a somewhat lesser extent the two Mechthildes – experienced this devotion centrally in their mystical visions.

In the 16th century, the devotion passed from the domain of mysticism into that of Christian asceticism. It was established as a devotion with prayers already formulated and special exercises, found in the writings of Lanspergius (d. 1539) of the Carthusians of Cologne, the Benedictine Louis de Blois (d. 1566) Abbot of Liessies in Hainaut, John of Avila (d. 1569), and Francis de Sales (d. 1622).

The historical record from that time shows an early bringing to light of the devotion. Ascetic writers spoke of it, especially those of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). The image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was everywhere in evidence, largely due to the Franciscan devotion to the Five Wounds and to the Jesuits placing the image on the title-page of their books and on the walls of their churches.

The first to establish the theological basis for the devotion was Polish Jesuit Kasper Drużbicki (1590–1662) in his book (&quot;The goal of hearts – Heart of Jesus&quot;). Not much later John Eudes wrote an office, and promoted a feast for it. John Eudes is regarded as &quot;tireless apostle of the devotion of the Sacred Hearts&quot;, entitling him as &#x27;Father&#x27;, doctor and apostle of the liturgical cult of the hearts of Jesus and Mary.

Little by little, the devotion to the Sacred Hearts became distinct, and on 31 August 1670 the first feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was celebrated in the Grand Seminary of Rennes. Coutances followed suit on October 20, a day with which the Eudist feast was from then on to be connected. The feast soon spread to other dioceses, and the devotion was likewise adopted in various religious communities. It gradually came into contact with the devotion begun by Margaret Mary Alacoque at Paray-le-Monial, and the two merged.

===Margaret Mary Alacoque===
The most significant source for the devotion to the Sacred Heart in the form it is known today was Margaret Mary Alacoque (1647–1690), a nun of the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary, who claimed to have received Sacred Heart revelations from Jesus Christ between 1673 and 1675 in the Burgundian French village of Paray-le-Monial.

The first apparition took place on 27 December 1673, the day of the feast of Saint John the Evangelist, during which Jesus allowed Margaret Mary to rest her head upon his heart, telling her that he wanted to make his love known to all mankind and that he had chosen her to spread the devotion to his Sacred Heart. Right after this, she had a vision of his heart with a crown of thorns, surrounded by flames and above which a cross was planted. This representation will become the popular image of the Sacred Heart which Margaret Mary used to propagate the devotion.

Between 1674 and 1675, other apparitions followed in which Jesus Christ revealed to Alacoque different forms of devotion to the Sacred Heart. The First Fridays Devotion, which is the reception of Holy Communion on nine first Fridays of each month, was revealed to her through a &quot;Great Promise&quot; of final penance granted to those who practice this act of reparation. Margaret Mary also said that she was instructed to spend an hour every Thursday night, from eleven to midnight, to pray and meditate on Jesus&#x27; agony in the Garden of Gethsemane. Her prayers intended to ask mercy for sinners as well as to make reparation for the abandonment Jesus felt from his apostles in the garden. This practice is now known as the &quot;Holy Hour&quot; and is also frequently performed during an hour of Eucharistic adoration.

During the octave of Corpus Christi in 1675, probably on June 16, the vision known as the &quot;great revelation&quot; reportedly took place, where Jesus said: &quot;Behold the heart which has so loved men that it has spared nothing, even to exhausting and consuming itself, in order to testify its love; and in return, I receive from the greater part only ingratitude, by their irreverence and sacrilege, and by the coldness and contempt they have for me in this sacrament of love.&quot; He then asked Margaret Mary for a feast of reparation of the Friday after the octave of Corpus Christi, bidding her consult her confessor Claude de la Colombière, then superior of the small Jesuit house at Paray-le-Monial. This request was transmitted and the feast of the Sacred Heart was progressively instituted throughout the Church. The feast later became a solemnity in the liturgical calendar, a feast of the highest rank, celebrated eight days after the Feast of Corpus Christi just as Jesus requested. On 21 June 1675, following that apparition, Claude consecrated himself to the Sacred Heart, making him the first person to be consecrated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus after Margaret Mary, and began spreading the devotion.

De la Colombière directed her to write an account of the apparitions, which he discreetly circulated in France and England. After his death on 15 February 1682, his journal of spiritual retreats was found to contain a copy in his handwriting of the account that he had requested of Margaret Mary, together with a few reflections on the usefulness of the devotion. This journal, including the account – an &quot;offering&quot; to the Sacred Heart in which the devotion was explained – was published at Lyon in 1684. The little book was widely read, especially at Paray-le-Monial. Margaret Mary reported feeling &quot;dreadful confusion&quot; over the book&#x27;s contents, but resolved to make the best of it, approving of the book for the spreading of her cherished devotion. Along with the Visitandines, priests, religious, and laymen espoused the devotion, particularly the Capuchins. The reported apparitions served as a catalyst for the promotion of the devotion to the Sacred Heart. In 1691 Jesuit priest John Croiset wrote a book called , and Joseph de Gallifet promoted the devotion. The mission of propagating the new devotion was especially confided to the religious of the Visitation and to the priests of the Society of Jesus.

====Promises Given to Margaret Mary Alacoque====
Alacoque said that in her apparitions Jesus promised specific blessings to those who practice devotion to his Sacred Heart. The last promise, also called the &quot;Great Promise&quot;, is a promise of final penance granted to those who practice the First Fridays Devotion.

# I will give them all the graces necessary for their state of life.
# I will give peace in their families.
# I will console them in all their troubles.
# I will be their refuge in life and especially in death.
# I will abundantly bless all their undertakings.
# Sinners shall find in my Heart the source and infinite ocean of mercy.
# Tepid souls shall become fervent.
# Fervent souls shall rise speedily to great perfection.
# I will bless those places wherein the image of My Sacred Heart shall be exposed and venerated.
# I will give to priests the power to touch the most hardened hearts.
# Persons who propagate this devotion shall have their names eternally written in my Heart.
# In the excess of the mercy of my Heart, I promise you that my all powerful love will grant to all those who will receive Communion on the first Friday, for nine consecutive months, the grace of final repentance: they will not die in my displeasure, nor without receiving the sacraments; and my Heart will be their secure refuge in that last hour.

===Mary of the Divine Heart===

Another source for the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus was Mary of the Divine Heart (1863–1899), a religious sister from the Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd, who reported to have received several interior locutions and visions of Jesus Christ. The first interior locution Mary of the Divine Heart reported was during her youth spent with the family in the , near Münster, Germany, and the last vision and private revelation was reported during her presence as mother superior in the Convent of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd in Porto, Portugal.

Based on the messages she said she received in her revelations of Christ, on 10 June 1898 her confessor at the Good Shepherd monastery wrote to Pope Leo XIII stating that Mary of the Divine Heart had received a message from Christ, requesting the pope to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart. The pope initially attached no credence to it and took no action. However, on 6 January 1899 she sent another letter asking that in addition to the consecration, the first Fridays of the month be observed in honor of the Sacred Heart.

Mary of the Divine Heart died in her monastery in Portugal when the church was singing the first vespers of the Sacred Heart of Jesus on 8 June 1899. The following day, in Annum sacrum, Pope Leo XIII consecrated the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.

====Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus====

Mary of the Divine Heart said that in her mystical experiences Jesus Christ inspired her to build a shrine dedicated to his Sacred Heart. According to the writings of Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Jesus said: &quot;I will make it a place of graces. I will distribute copiously graces to all who live in this house [the convent], those who live here now, those who will live here after, and even to their relatives.&quot;

She did not live to see this come to fruition. The imposing Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (also referred as Church of the Good Shepherd or Sanctuary of the Sacred Heart of Jesus) was built between 14 July 1957 and 21 April 1966, in the civil parish of Ermesinde in north Portugal, and consecrated to the Heart of Christ in fulfillment of the vow made by the nun. She is buried in the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Ermesinde.

==Papal approval==
In 1353, Pope Innocent VI instituted a Mass honoring the mystery of the Sacred Heart.

In 1693 the Holy See imparted indulgences to the Confraternities of the Sacred Heart, and in 1697 granted the feast to the Visitandines with the Mass of the Five Wounds, but refused a feast common to all, with special Mass and Office. The devotion spread, particularly in religious communities. The Marseille plague in 1720 furnished perhaps the first occasion for a solemn consecration and public worship outside of religious communities. Other cities of southern Europe followed the example of Marseille.

After Pope Leo XIII received correspondence from Mary of the Divine Heart asking him to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he commissioned a group of theologians to examine the petition on the basis of revelation and sacred tradition. The outcome of this investigation was positive, and in 1899 he decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on 11 June 1899. The encyclical letter also encouraged the entire Roman Catholic episcopate to promote the First Friday Devotions, established June as the Month of the Sacred Heart, and included the Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart. The idea of this act, which Leo XIII called &quot;the great act&quot; of his pontificate.

Pope Pius X decreed that the consecration of the human race performed by Leo XIII be renewed each year. Pius X also granted a Pontifical decree for the imposition of a golden crown to the lowly foot of a statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in the Nevers Cathedral on 9 July 1908 (via the Archbishop of Nevers and Besancon, Francois Leon Gauthey, both signed and notarized by the Sacred Congregation of Rites).

Pope Pius XI affirmed the church&#x27;s position with respect to Margaret Mary Alacoque&#x27;s visions of Jesus Christ by stating that Jesus had &quot;manifested Himself&quot; to Alacoque and had &quot;promised her that all those who rendered this honor to his Heart would be endowed with an abundance of heavenly graces&quot;. His encyclical letter &quot;Miserentissimus Redemptor&quot; (1928) reaffirmed the importance of consecration and reparation to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.

By inserting the &quot;Great Promise&quot; of the First Fridays Devotion into the Bull of Canonization of Margaret Mary Alacoque on 13 May 1920, Pope Benedict XV encouraged the practice of this act of reparation of the first nine fridays in honor of the Sacred Heart.

Pope Pius XII, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Pius IX&#x27;s institution of the feast, instructed the entire Latin Church at length on the devotion to the Sacred Heart in his encyclical letter &quot;Haurietis aquas&quot; of 15 May 1956. On 15 May 2006, the 50th anniversary of that encyclical, Pope Benedict XVI sent a letter to Peter Hans Kolvenbach, the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, reaffirming the importance of the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. On 24 October 2024, Pope Francis published his fourth encyclical, the 28,000-word &quot;Dilexit nos&quot; (&quot;He loved us&quot;), which reflects on the philosophical and theological meaning of &quot;the heart&quot; and addresses the importance of the devotion to the Sacred Heart in a contemporary context.

==Worship and devotion==

Worship of the Sacred Heart mainly consists of several devotions, practices, consecrations, hymns, the salutation of the Sacred Heart, and the Litany of the Sacred Heart. It is common in Roman Catholic services.

Since , groups, congregations, and countries have consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart.

By a law voted on 24 July 1873, the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Montmartre known as &quot;National Vow&quot;, is declared of public utility by the National Assembly of 1871. On 16 June 1875, the Archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Guibert layed the first stone of the basilica, honoring after two hundred years the fourth request of Jesus reported by Margaret Mary Alacoque from 16 June 1675.

On 25 March 1874, by petition of president Gabriel García Moreno and archbishop José Ignacio Checa y Barba, Ecuador was the first country in the world to be consecrated to the Sacred Heart by legislative decree. Since then, more than twenty countries have followed and consecrated themselves either by decree or at the initiative of their respective national Church, some of which renewed their consecration a few times. On 22 June 1902, Colombia was consecrated by decree with the agreement of president José Manuel Marroquín. On 30 May 1919, Spain was officially consecrated to the Sacred Heart by King Alfonso XIII.

In the Catholic tradition, the Sacred Heart has been closely associated with Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ. In his encyclical &quot;Miserentissimus Redemptor&quot;, Pope Pius XI stated: &quot;The spirit of expiation or reparation has always had the first and foremost place in the worship given to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus.&quot; The &quot;Golden Arrow Prayer&quot; directly refers to the Sacred Heart.

===Feast day===

The Feast of the Sacred Heart is a solemnity in the liturgical calendar of the Latin Church. It is celebrated on the third Friday after Pentecost, which was up until the changes in the General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII referred to as the Friday after the octave of Corpus Christi. It is the last feast day of the year that is dependent on the date of Easter. The acts of consecration, reparation, and devotion were introduced when the feast of the Sacred Heart was declared. Some Anglican Franciscans keep the feast under the name &quot;(The) Divine Compassion of Christ&quot;.

===Month of the Sacred Heart===

The month of June is traditionally devoted in a special way to the veneration of the Sacred Heart. Masses, novenas, and the recitation of devotional prayers in honor of the Sacred Heart are traditionally observed.

===Act of Consecration to the Sacred Heart===
A personal prayer of consecration to the Sacred Heart was written by Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque, allegedly under the inspiration of Jesus, which she wrote to the priest John Croiset, recommending that he include it in the book he was to publish about her revelations &quot;It comes from Him, and He would not agree to its omission.&quot;

On 25 May 1899, Pope Leo XIII wrote an Act of Consecration of the Human Race to the Sacred Heart in his encyclical letter Annum sacrum, with the influence of Mary of the Divine Heart and in response to demands received over 25 years.

On 19 May 1908, a particular family consecration prayer known as the Act of Consecration of the Family to the Sacred Heart was approved and granted with an indulgence by Pope Pius X.

=== First Fridays Devotion ===
The First Fridays Devotion is a devotion to offer reparations for sins to the Eucharist and in honor of the Sacred Heart, which had its origin in the apparitions of Christ reported by Margaret Mary Alacoque. This devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus was fully approved by the Catholic Church and a &quot;Great Promise&quot; of final penance was made to those who practice the First Fridays Devotion. The devotion consists of several practices that are performed on the first Fridays of nine consecutive months. On these days, a person is to attend Mass and receive the Eucharist. If the need arises, in order to receive communion in a state of grace, a person should also make use of the sacrament of penance before attending Mass.

=== Holy Hour ===
Alacoque stated that she received a vision of Jesus in which she was instructed to spend an hour every Thursday night as a reparation and to pray and meditate on his agony in the Garden of Gethsemane. This practice later became widespread among Roman Catholics and became the devotion of the Holy Hour, a devotional tradition of spending an hour in prayers or in Eucharistic adoration in the presence of the Eucharist.

===Enthronement of the Sacred Heart of Jesus===
The act of enthroning the Sacred Heart entails placing an image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in a place of honor in the home after a time of prayerful preparation. Many families will also place an image of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in tandem with the Sacred Heart image.

The practice of the home enthronement of the Sacred Heart was started by R. Mateo Crawley-Boevey, a priest of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, in 1907, having visited the apparition chapel in Paray-le-Monial.

Enthronement of the Sacred Heart is promoted by the National Enthronement Center in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, the Sacred Heart Apostolate of Knoxville, Tennessee, Sacred Heart Columbus in Columbus, Ohio, and the Sacred Heart Enthronement Network, a 501(c)(3) located in Columbus, Ohio. It is also endorsed by the World Apostolate of Fátima.

===Scapular of the Sacred Heart===

The Scapular of the Sacred Heart and the Scapular of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary are devotional articles worn by some Catholics.

An early form of the Scapular of the Sacred Heart were cloth &quot;badges&quot; bearing an image of the Heart of Jesus. made and distributed by Margaret Mary Alacoque. Following the claims by Estelle Faguette that the Virgin Mary had appeared to her at Pellevoisin in 1876 and requested a scapular of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a scapular of the proposed design was approved by the Congregation of Rites in 1900. It bears the representation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus on one side and that of the Virgin Mary under the title of Mother of Mercy on the other side.

=== Prayers ===
The Litany of the Sacred Heart of Jesus is common in Roman Catholic services and occasionally is found in Anglican services.

There is also a Morning offering to the Sacred Heart.

===Alliance with the Immaculate Heart===

The &quot;Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary&quot; is a phrase coined by Pope John Paul II during his Angelus Address of September 15, 1985 when he mentioned that devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, &quot;...though distinct, they are interrelated...&quot; symposia were held on the concept during the 1980s and 1990s.

It was not until the seventeenth century when devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary was popularized by John Eudes. Although Eudes always associated the two Hearts, he began his devotional teachings with the Heart of Mary, and then extended it to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries both devotions grew, particularly through the popularity of the Miraculous Medal, depicting the Heart of Jesus thorn-crowned and the Heart of Mary pierced with a sword. The devotions and associated prayers grew into the twentieth century through the reported messages of Our Lady of Fátima saying that the Heart of Jesus wishes to be honored together with the Heart of Mary. In the 1956 encyclical &quot;Haurietis aquas&quot;, Pope Pius XII encouraged both devotions.

== Sacred Heart imagery ==
The Sacred Heart crowned with thorns is depicted on the reverse side of the Miraculous Medal,

The Carillon-Sacré-Coeur flag has been adopted by the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste in Québec.

Religious imagery depicting the Sacred Heart is frequently featured in homes. Ireland was consecrated to the Sacred Heart on Passion Sunday 1873 by the bishops of Ireland, which led to the Sacred Heart lamp becoming a common devotional object in Irish homes. Sometimes the image is part of a set, along with the Immaculate Heart of Mary. However, the Sacred Congregation of Rites stated in 1879 that images of the hearts of Jesus or Mary were not appropriate for being placed on the altar for Mass, although are appropriate for &quot;private devotion&quot;.

==Institutions and religious congregations==
&quot;Sacred Heart&quot; is a name used for many Catholic institutions, including schools, colleges, and hospitals in many countries. It is also the name of many Catholic parishes, and religious congregations.

Peter Coudrin of France founded the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary on 24 December 1800. A religious order of the Latin Church, the order carried out missionary work in Hawaii. Clelia Merloni from Forlì (Italy) founded the Congregation of the Apostles of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Viareggio, Italy, on 30 May 1894. There are numerous other religious orders named after or inspired by the Sacred Heart: Pope Francis acknowledges that it would be &quot;an endless undertaking&quot; to list them all.

== Gallery ==
==In Eastern Catholicism==
Devotion to the Sacred Heart may be found in some Eastern Catholic Churches, particularly the Ukrainian. Others see it as an example of liturgical Latinisation. Many Eastern churches observe a comparable feast of &quot;Jesus, Lover of Mankind&quot;, celebrated on July 17.

<doc id="206164" wikidata="Q186528" url="?curid=206164" title="USS South Dakota (BB-57)">
<text>USS &quot;South Dakota&quot; (BB-57) was the lead vessel of the four fast battleships built for the United States Navy in the 1930s. The first American battleships designed after the Washington treaty system began to break down in the mid-1930s, the &quot;South Dakota&quot;s were able to take advantage of a treaty clause that allowed them to increase the main battery to guns. However, congressional refusal to authorize larger battleships kept their displacement close to the Washington limit of . A requirement to be armored against the same caliber of guns as they carried, combined with the displacement restriction, resulted in cramped ships. Overcrowding was exacerbated by wartime modifications that considerably strengthened their anti-aircraft batteries and significantly increased their crews.

&quot;South Dakota&quot; saw extensive action during World War II; immediately upon entering service in mid-1942, she was sent to the south Pacific to reinforce Allied forces waging the Guadalcanal campaign. The ship was damaged in an accidental grounding on an uncharted reef, but after completing repairs she returned to the front, taking part in the Battle of Santa Cruz in October and the Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in November. During the latter action, electrical failures hampered the ability of the ship to engage Japanese warships and she became the target of numerous Japanese vessels, sustaining over two-dozen hits that significantly damaged her superstructure but did not seriously threaten her buoyancy. &quot;South Dakota&quot; returned to the United States for repairs that lasted into 1943, after which she was briefly deployed to strengthen the British Home Fleet, tasked with protecting convoys to the Soviet Union.

In mid-1943, the ship was transferred back to the Pacific, where she primarily operated with the fast carrier task force, contributing her heavy anti-aircraft armament to its defense. In this capacity, she took part in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign in late 1943 and early 1944, the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign in mid-1944, and the Philippines campaign later that year. In 1945, she participated in the Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa and bombarded Japan three times. Following the end of the war in August 1945, she took part in the initial occupation of the country before returning to the United States in September. She later moved to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, where she was laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet until 1962, when she was sold for scrap.

==Design==

The &quot;South Dakota&quot; was ordered in the context of global naval rearmament during the breakdown of the Washington treaty system that had controlled battleship construction during the 1920s and early 1930s. Under the Washington and London treaties, so-called treaty battleships were limited to a standard displacement of and a main battery of guns. In 1936, following Japan&#x27;s decision to abandon the treaty system, the United States Navy decided to invoke the &quot;escalator clause&quot; in the treaty that allowed displacements to rise to and armament to increase to guns. Congressional objections to increasing the size of the new ships forced the design staff to keep displacement as close to 35,000 LT as possible while incorporating the larger guns and armor sufficient to defeat guns of the same caliber. The ship cost $52.8-million (equivalent to $ million today), making it one of the most expensive American naval ships at the time.

&quot;South Dakota&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full combat load. The ship was powered by four-shaft General Electric steam turbines and eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers rated at , generating a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . She carried three Vought OS2U Kingfisher floatplanes for aerial reconnaissance, which were launched by a pair of aircraft catapults on her fantail. Her peace time crew numbered 1,793 officers and enlisted men but during the war the crew swelled to 2,500.
The ship was armed with a main battery of nine 16-inch /45 caliber Mark 6 guns in three triple gun turrets on the centerline, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward, with the third aft. The secondary battery consisted of sixteen /38 caliber dual purpose guns mounted in twin turrets clustered amidships, four turrets on either side. This was two fewer turrets than her sisters, a reduction in weight and magazine space to accommodate the extra personnel and equipment for her use as a flagship. To compensate for the reduction in medium anti-aircraft firepower, she received light anti-aircraft guns. As designed, the ship was equipped with an anti-aircraft battery of twenty /75 caliber guns and twelve .50-caliber M2 Browning machine guns in single mounts, but she was completed with a battery of seven quadruple Bofors guns, seven quadruple 1.1 in guns, thirty-four Oerlikon autocannon in single mounts, and eight of the .50-cal. guns.

The main armored belt was thick, while the main armored deck was up to thick. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces, and they were mounted atop barbettes that were thick. The conning tower had 16 in thick sides.

===Modifications===
&quot;South Dakota&quot; received a series of modifications through her wartime career, consisting primarily of additions to her anti-aircraft battery and various types of radar sets. The first addition was the installation of SC air search radar, ordered in 1941, that was fitted in the fore mast. It was later replaced with an SK type set. At the same time, an SG surface search radar was installed on the forward superstructure; a second SG set was added to the main mast after experiences during the Guadalcanal campaign in 1942. During fitting out in 1942, she received a Mark 3 fire control radar, mounted on her conning tower to assist in the direction of her main battery guns and Mark 4 radars for the secondary battery guns. The Mark 3 was quickly replaced with more modern Mark 8 fire control radar, and Mark 4 radars for the secondary battery guns. She later received Mark 12/22 sets in place of the Mark 4s. &quot;South Dakota&quot; also received a TDY jammer. In 1945, her traditional spotting scopes were replaced with Mark 27 microwave radar sets, and she received an SR air search radar and an SK-2 air search dish.

The ship&#x27;s light anti-aircraft battery was gradually expanded. In November 1942, eight more .50-cal machine guns were installed and during repairs in late 1942 and early 1943, two of her 1.1 in quadruple mounts were replaced with 40 mm quadruple mounts. By February 1943, all of her 1.1 in guns were removed and thirteen more 40 mm quadruple mounts were added. By this time, her 20 mm battery had been increased to 80 barrels, all in individual mounts. By the end of the war, eight of these had been removed.

== Service history ==

The keel for &quot;South Dakota&quot; was laid down on 5 July 1939, at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey. She was launched on 7 June 1941 and was commissioned into the fleet on 20 March 1942. She was then towed across the river to the Philadelphia Navy Yard and began fitting out; Captain Thomas Leigh Gatch was her first commanding officer. This work was completed by 14 May, and over the next two days she did machinery tests in the Delaware River, followed by more fitting out work that lasted until 3 June. Two days later, she began her shakedown cruise, escorted by four destroyers owing to the threat of German U-boats operating off the east coast of the United States. Over the following two days, she tested her engines at various speeds and test fired her guns to check for structural problems. Training in the area continued until 17 July and the next day, she departed for Hampton Roads, Virginia with four destroyers as escort. From there, she cruised back north to meet the battleship off the coast of Maine before anchoring at Casco Bay on 21 July. There, she engaged in further firing practice before steaming to Philadelphia and being declared ready for active duty on 26 July.

===First Pacific deployment===
As the fighting between American and Japanese forces in the Guadalcanal Campaign intensified, particularly after the Allied defeat at the Battle of Savo Island, Admiral Ernest King, the Chief of Naval Operations, ordered &quot;South Dakota&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;, the light cruiser , and six destroyers to deploy to the south Pacific to reinforce the American fleet there. Rear Admiral (RADM) Willis Lee took command of the ships, designated Battleship Division (BatDiv) 6 on 14 August, hoisting his flag aboard &quot;South Dakota&quot;. The next day, she got underway escorted by three destroyers, but her progress was delayed by an engine breakdown that necessitated repairs that were completed the following morning. After steaming south through the Caribbean, Lee detached the escorting destroyers, passed through the Panama Canal, and picked up three other destroyers on the Pacific side of the canal.

Later in August, while still en route to the Guadalcanal area, &quot;South Dakota&quot; rendezvoused with &quot;Juneau&quot;, the ships proceeding together to Nukuʻalofa, Tongatapu which they reached on 4 September. After refueling there, they left the port on 6 September, but &quot;South Dakota&quot; was badly damaged when she struck an uncharted reef in the Lahai Passage. Divers from the repair ship inspected the hull and discovered a length of plating had been damaged. Workers from &quot;Vestal&quot; patched the hull, allowing her to depart for Pearl Harbor on 12 September, where permanent repairs were effected. She joined the aircraft carrier , which had been torpedoed by a Japanese submarine south of Guadalcanal, and her escorts for the voyage. Repairs lasted from 23 to 28 September, and the work also included removing the 1.1-inch guns, adding four 40 mm quad mounts and twenty-two 20 mm guns.

After loading ammunition and supplies, &quot;South Dakota&quot; was pronounced ready for sea on 12 October. She conducted anti-aircraft training through the following day before returning to Pearl Harbor on 14 October. She departed for the south Pacific later that day in company with Task Force 16 (TF), which included the aircraft carrier , with nine escorting destroyers. Vice Admiral William F. Halsey, the South Pacific Area commander, ordered TF 16 to sweep for Japanese naval forces north of the Santa Cruz Islands before turning south-west toward the Solomon Islands to block the Japanese path to Guadalcanal. For the operation, TF 16 was reinforced by TF 17—centered on the carrier —which were combined to form TF 61 under the command of RADM Thomas C. Kinkaid. The force was supported by Lee with TF 64, which comprised &quot;Washington&quot;, two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and six destroyers.

====Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands====

Japanese and American reconnaissance aircraft discovered each other&#x27;s fleets on 25 October, and &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s crew prepared for a night surface action that night, though the anticipated Japanese attack did not materialize. Japanese reconnaissance aircraft that had spotted Lee&#x27;s force east of Rennell Island had drawn the Japanese fleet in his direction, away from TF 61. The next morning, aircraft from &quot;Enterprise&quot; located the Japanese aircraft carriers minutes before a Japanese seaplane located TF 61; both sides immediately launched air strikes, leading to the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. The first Japanese wave struck &quot;Hornet&quot;″s group, inflicting serious damage on the carrier and forcing her to withdraw, though &quot;South Dakota&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; were left unmolested. &quot;Hornet&quot;″s withdrawal allowed the Japanese carriers to concentrate their attacks on &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s group.

A second strike later that morning, shortly after 10:00 targeted the &quot;Enterprise&quot; group, and &quot;South Dakota&quot; provided heavy anti-aircraft fire to drive off the attackers; the ships shot down seven Japanese aircraft and fighters claimed another three. A third wave hit the task force an hour later, and at 11:48, a group of Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers attacked &quot;South Dakota&quot;. She evaded the torpedoes and shot down one of the attackers. A fourth strike arrived over the fleet half an hour later, and several Aichi D3A dive bombers attacked &quot;South Dakota&quot;. Most of the bombs fell harmlessly in the sea, but one scored a hit on her forward main battery turret roof, though it exploded without penetrating. Gatch, who was out on the bridge wing to spot the bombers so he could try to maneuver the vessel away, was wounded by a bomb splinter and the concussion from the blast threw him into the wall and knocked him unconscious. Two men were killed and over fifty were wounded by fragments from the bomb. Splinters from the bomb damaged the center and left gun of the number two turret. The gun crew was eventually informed by the Bureau of Ordnance that the gouges were deep enough that the barrels should not be fired.

A miscommunication while transferring steering control to the executive officer&#x27;s (XO) station caused &quot;South Dakota&quot; to haul out of formation, briefly headed toward &quot;Enterprise&quot; before the XO corrected the mistake. The two fleets then disengaged as night approached. &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s gunners claimed to have shot down 26 Japanese aircraft, but only 13 had actually been shot down by all of the ships of TF 16 combined. The ship suffered two fatalities and around sixty wounded between the bomb hit and strafing runs from Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters. The effectiveness of &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s anti-aircraft fire was exaggerated in the press after the battle; the 5-inch, 1.1-inch, and 40 mm guns had difficulty tracking targets through the low clouds. The 20 mm guns, with their shorter effective range, were not hampered by the reduced visibility and accounted for two-thirds of the aircraft &quot;South Dakota&quot; shot down, according to the ship&#x27;s after action report.

Though the Japanese carriers survived the battle and &quot;Hornet&quot; eventually had to be scuttled, the Japanese had lost 99 aircraft, nearly half of the carriers&#x27; complement, devastating Japanese naval aviation, which relied on a small number of highly trained veterans that could not be easily replaced. While attempting to avoid a submarine contact on the return trip to Nouméa, &quot;South Dakota&quot; collided with the destroyer on 30 October. Both &quot;South Dakota&quot; and &quot;Mahan&quot; suffered significant damage, with &quot;Mahan&quot;″s bow deflected to port and crumpled back to Frame 14. Both warships continued to Nouméa, where &quot;Vestal&quot; repaired &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s collision and battle damage.

The repair team flooded some of &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s internal compartments to induce a list to expose the damaged hull plating; the work lasted from 1 to 6 November, and Gatch had returned to duty the previous day. By this time, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was the only active carrier in the Pacific, and so Halsey ordered &quot;Washington&quot; to join &quot;South Dakota&quot; as part of the escort force to protect the valuable carrier. TF 16 now consisted of &quot;South Dakota&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;, the heavy cruiser , and nine destroyers. The ships sortied on 11 November to return to the fighting off Guadalcanal. The cruiser and two more destroyers joined them the following day. On 13 November, after learning that a major Japanese attack was approaching, Halsey detached &quot;South Dakota&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;, and four of the destroyers as Task Group 16.3, again under Lee&#x27;s command. &quot;Enterprise&quot;, her forward elevator damaged from the action at Santa Cruz, was kept to the south as a reserve. The ships of TG 16.3 were to block an anticipated Japanese bombardment group in the waters off Guadalcanal.

====Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal====

As Lee&#x27;s task group approached Guadalcanal, his Japanese counterpart Admiral Nobutake Kondō steamed to meet him with his main bombardment force, consisting of the fast battleship , the heavy cruisers and , and a destroyer screen. While en route, TG 16.3 was re-designated as TF 64 on 14 November; the ships passed to the south of Guadalcanal and then rounded the western end of the island to block Kondō&#x27;s expected route. Japanese aircraft reported sighting Lee&#x27;s formation, but identification of the ships ranged from a group of cruisers and destroyers to aircraft carriers, causing confusion among the Japanese commanders. That evening, American reconnaissance aircraft spotted Japanese warships off Savo Island, prompting Lee to order his ships to general quarters. The four destroyers were arrayed ahead of the two battleships. The American task force, having been thrown together a day before, had not operated together as a unit, and both of the battleships had very limited experience shooting their main battery, particularly at night.

At around 23:00 on 14 November, the leading Japanese destroyers in a screening force commanded by RADM Shintarō Hashimoto sent ahead of Kondō&#x27;s main force spotted Lee&#x27;s ships and turned about to warn Kondō. At about the same time, &quot;Washington&quot;″s search radar picked up one of Hashimoto&#x27;s cruisers and a destroyer. The ships&#x27; fire control radars then began tracking the Japanese vessels and Lee ordered both of his battleships to open fire when ready. &quot;Washington&quot; fired first at 23:17 at a range of , followed quickly by &quot;South Dakota&quot;, though she was limited to four of her six forward guns owing to the damage to two of the barrels sustained at Santa Cruz. The ships used their radars to determine the range but their optical directors to aim the guns. &quot;South Dakota&quot; initially targeted the destroyer ; &quot;South Dakota&quot; missed, but &quot;Shikinami&quot; immediately turned to open the range. &quot;South Dakota&quot; then shifted fire to the destroyers and ; her spotters claimed &quot;South Dakota&quot; had hit both and set them on fire, but she scored no hits during this period. The former approached &quot;Washington&quot; too closely, however, and was quickly reduced to a flaming wreck, which was scuttled later.

Shortly thereafter, at about 23:30, an error in the electrical switchboard room knocked out power aboard &quot;South Dakota&quot;, disabling her radar systems and leaving the ship all but blind to the Japanese vessels approaching the force. By this time, Hashimoto&#x27;s ships had inflicted serious damage on the American destroyer screen; two of the destroyers were torpedoed (one of which, , survived until the following morning) and a third was destroyed by gunfire. This compounded &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s problems, as she had to keep clear of the burning wrecks. By being forced to turn in front of the burning destroyers, the fires backlit &quot;South Dakota&quot; and highlighted her presence to the Japanese ships. At 23:40, she engaged Hashimoto&#x27;s ships with her rear turret, which accidentally set her Kingfishers on fire, but a second salvo knocked two of the three burning aircraft overboard and blew out the fire on the third. Power was restored and she fired five salvos from her main battery at a range of , but the shock of firing the guns caused further electrical failures, disabling her gunnery and search radars for five minutes shortly before midnight. Upon reactivating her search radar, &quot;South Dakota&quot; picked up numerous Japanese vessels directly ahead. These were Kondō&#x27;s ships, and they immediately launched a volley of torpedoes at &quot;South Dakota&quot;, though they all missed.

Having inadvertently closed to within of Kondō&#x27;s force, &quot;South Dakota&quot; bore the brunt of Japanese attacks during this phase of the battle. Japanese destroyers illuminated the ship and the rest of Kondō&#x27;s vessels concentrated their fire on &quot;South Dakota&quot;. She received 27 hits during this phase, including a 14-inch shell from &quot;Kirishima&quot; that hit the rear turret and failed to penetrate the armor, though it damaged the training gear. Most of the hits came from the medium-caliber guns of the cruisers and destroyers, though they were largely confined to the superstructure, where they did not threaten the ship&#x27;s survival. They nevertheless inflicted significant damage, destroying radar sets, disabling radio systems, and knocking out other systems, leaving the ship in Lee&#x27;s words &quot;deaf, dumb, blind, and impotent.&quot;

Focused on &quot;South Dakota&quot;, the Japanese left &quot;Washington&quot; unengaged, allowing her to attack &quot;Kirishima&quot; without any disruption. &quot;South Dakota&quot; fired two or three salvos at the next Japanese ship in the line before shifting fire to target &quot;Kirishima&quot; as well, firing five salvos in total before checking her fire as her gun directing equipment had been disabled; her secondary battery nevertheless kept up a heavy fire. &quot;Washington&quot; quickly inflicted fatal damage on &quot;Kirishima&quot;, destroying two of her four main battery turrets, holing her below the waterline, and starting numerous fires. Shortly after midnight, Kondō turned his ships to bring them back into torpedo range, leaving the stricken &quot;Kirishima&quot; to steam out of control. At 00:05, the Japanese ceased firing at &quot;South Dakota&quot; and she increased speed to and checked her fire at 00:08. Since her radios had been disabled by gunfire, Gatch could not communicate with Lee, so he turned south and disengaged. A hit below the waterline caused minor flooding and a list of 0.75 degrees, though that was quickly corrected. Fires that shell hits had started were suppressed by 01:55. At around 02:00, &quot;South Dakota&quot; restored radio contact with &quot;Washington&quot; and Gatch informed Lee of his ship&#x27;s condition. Lee ordered Gatch to withdraw at high speed. &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s crew had suffered heavy casualties, with 40 killed and 180 wounded. Among the injured was 12-year-old Calvin Graham, who had lied about his age to enlist; he was the youngest American to fight in the war. By 09:00, &quot;South Dakota&quot; had formed back up with &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;Benham&quot;, and the destroyer to withdraw from the area. &quot;South Dakota&quot; received the Navy Unit Commendation for her role in the battle.

===Repairs and Atlantic deployment===
&quot;Washington&quot; joined &quot;South Dakota&quot;, and the two battleships withdrew to Nouméa, which they reached on 17 November. There, the repair ship repaired some of &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s damage, the work lasting until 25 November. During that period, she received replacements for her destroyed Kingfishers. On 25 November, she got underway, headed to Nukuʻalofa escorted by a pair of destroyers. After refueling there on 27 November, she proceeded with the destroyers until the 29th, when she detached them to return to the fleet. &quot;South Dakota&quot; steamed northeast to the Panama Canal, which she reached on 11 December. She refueled on the Pacific side of the canal, passed through the locks, and steamed north to New York. Once she was in the Atlantic, she picked up an escort of two destroyers.

After arriving in New York on 18 December, &quot;South Dakota&quot; went into dry-dock at the Brooklyn Navy Yard for permanent repairs and a refit. The ship was heralded in the press and credited with the victory off Guadalcanal instead of &quot;Washington&quot;, despite her poor performance in the action. For security purposes, she was referred to as &quot;Battleship X&quot;. Captain Lynde D. McCormick relieved Gatch on 1 February 1943, and the ship went to sea on 25 February to begin sea trials. In March, she began operations in the north Atlantic with the carrier . The British Home Fleet deployed battleships to the Mediterranean to support the Allied invasion of Sicily, and &quot;South Dakota&quot; was in turn sent to reinforce the Home Fleet. Her primary responsibility during this period was protecting the Arctic supply convoys being sent to the Soviet Union through the Arctic Ocean; a powerful German squadron consisting of the battleships and and several heavy cruisers threatened these convoys.

The American contribution to the convoy escort was designated TF 61, commanded by RADM Olaf M. Hustvedt, and consisted of &quot;South Dakota&quot;, her sister , and five destroyers. The ships arrived in Scapa Flow on 19 May and joined the battleships and , with which they frequently operated over the next three months. The ships protected convoys going back and forth between Britain and the Soviet Union, and in July, they conducted a demonstration to distract German attention during the Sicily invasion, though the Germans took no notice of the ships. At the end of the month, &quot;South Dakota&quot; was recalled to Norfolk with five destroyers as escort; they arrived there on 1 August. After her arrival, RADM Edward Hanson, the commander of BatDiv 9, came aboard &quot;South Dakota&quot;, making her his flagship.

===Second tour in the Pacific===
==== The Gilbert and Marshall Islands ====
&quot;South Dakota&quot; departed Norfolk on 21 August and reached Efate in the south Pacific on 14 September. From there, she steamed to Fiji on 7 November, where she joined the rest of BatDiv 9, which had been assigned to the support force for TG 50.1, designated the Carrier Interceptor Group. The American fleet embarked on a campaign to conquer the Gilbert and Marshall Islands, beginning with Operation Galvanic, the seizure of Tarawa later in November. On 19 November, the carriers launched raids on Tarawa and nearby islands in advance of the amphibious assault. &quot;South Dakota&quot; once again came under the command of Lee in December, who commanded TG 50.4, which also included the battleships &quot;Alabama&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;, , and two carriers. The ships were sent to attack Nauru early in the month, and on 6 December they were reinforced by the battleships and , now being re-designated TG 50.8. The ships arrived off Nauru two days later and bombarded it with gunfire from the battleships and strikes from the carriers&#x27; aircraft. The Americans achieved little of significance, as the Japanese forces on the island were light and had few aircraft to be targeted. The ships returned to Efate and began preparations for the next major offensive, including loading ammunition and other supplies. She loaded ammunition from the transport on 5 January 1944 and went to sea in company with &quot;Indiana&quot; and three destroyers for gunnery training on 16 January.

The next operation in which &quot;South Dakota&quot; participated was the invasion of the Marshalls, code-named Operation Flintlock; &quot;South Dakota&quot; was now part of TG 37.2, Third Fleet, which included &quot;Indiana&quot;, &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, &quot;North Carolina&quot;, and &quot;Washington&quot;, escorted by six destroyers. They departed Efate on 18 January, bound for Funafuti. Heavy seas injured several men aboard &quot;South Dakota&quot; and swept one man overboard, who was not recovered. The ships met the carriers and on the way, and on arriving in Funafuti two days later, the group was re-numbered as TF 58.8, as Fifth Fleet had taken command of the fast carrier task force. The ships refueled and departed on 23 January, and on the morning of 25 January, &quot;South Dakota&quot;, &quot;North Carolina&quot;, and &quot;Alabama&quot; were detached to form TG 58.2.2. The fleet continued on to its objective over the next several days, the voyage marked by false submarine sightings and radar contacts. The ships reached Roi-Namur on 29 January, and the carriers launched major air strikes on the islands in preparation for the coming assault. &quot;South Dakota&quot; remained with the carriers to protect them from Japanese aircraft that did not materialize. On 30 January, &quot;South Dakota&quot; and the rest of TG 58.2.2 were sent to shell the islands, part of the preparatory bombardment before the ground forces went ashore the following day.

====Central Pacific raids====
&quot;South Dakota&quot; steamed to Majuro to replenish fuel and ammunition on 4 February before departing on 12 February to support Operation Hailstone, a raid on the major Japanese naval base in the central Pacific at Truk. The American strikes sank a number of Japanese warships and logistics vessels in the harbor before continuing on to raid Japanese air bases in the Mariana Islands on 20 February. &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s 5-inch gunners engaged Japanese aircraft at long range late on 21 February and into the early hours of 22 February. Heavy anti-aircraft fire from the fleet kept the Japanese aircraft from closing to attack effectively, and &quot;South Dakota&quot; claimed several aircraft shot down. The American carriers attacked airfields on Saipan, Guam, and Tinian over the next two days, and on 23 February the fleet came under heavy Japanese air strikes. A wave of Mitsubishi G4M land-based bombers struck the fleet and &quot;South Dakota&quot; shot down at least two of them, one of which had attempted to bomb the ship.

&quot;South Dakota&quot;, &quot;Alabama&quot;, and a screen of destroyers were detached from the carrier raiding force to return to TG 58.2; they arrived back in Majuro on 26 February where they refueled and conducted shooting practice over the next month. Fifth Fleet got underway on 22 March for Operation Desecrate One, a series of carrier raids on islands in the western Carolines, including Palau, Yap, Woleai, and Ulithi. The raids were intended to secure the seaward flank for the landing at Hollandia in New Guinea. For the operation, &quot;South Dakota&quot; was assigned to TG 58.9, which included four other fast battleships, two carriers, three heavy cruisers, and thirteen destroyers; the ships were tasked with screening the main carrier task force to guard against a possible attack by heavy surface elements of the Japanese Combined Fleet, though they encountered no naval opposition.

On 27 March, three carriers and other warships from TG 36.1 joined TG 58.2, which was re-designated 58.3. Late that evening, &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s air search radar picked up Japanese aircraft approaching; in the ensuing battle, &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s gunners could not identify any targets in the darkness and so she did not engage the Japanese aircraft. For their part, the Japanese inflicted no damage on the fleet. The main carrier force began their raids on 30 March, which continued into 1 April. Another Japanese air strike hit the fleet late on the 30th, and this time &quot;South Dakota&quot; engaged two waves of attackers but did not shoot any down. The carriers inflicted significant losses to Japanese forces in the region at little cost before further operations were interrupted by bad weather that prevented aircraft from being launched. By 6 April, the fleet had returned to Majuro to prepare for the next operation.

Operation Desecrate Two followed the next week; this series of raids targeted Japanese positions along the coast of New Guinea to support the landing at Aitape. While underway on 19 April, &quot;South Dakota&quot; picked up a Japanese aircraft that was shadowing the fleet and a fighter from the combat air patrol (CAP) was sent to shoot it down. The carriers began their strikes two days later and inflicted serious losses, sinking a number of Japanese vessels in the area and destroying around 130 aircraft in the air or on the ground. Another series of raids followed the next day to support the ground forces fighting ashore. While the fleet withdrew back to Majuro, the carriers hit Truk again on 29 and 30 April, further battering the island. On 1 May, Lee took the fast battleships, including &quot;South Dakota&quot;, and created TG 58.7, tasked with bombarding the island of Pohnpei. The ships arrived off the island that afternoon and opened fire, quickly suppressing the Japanese anti-aircraft guns that attempted to engage them. &quot;South Dakota&quot;, &quot;Indiana&quot;, and &quot;North Carolina&quot; briefly disengaged to avoid a reported submarine in the area, but after it failed to attack, they returned to their firing positions. There were few targets for the battleships, but the operation provided the crews with experience operating in the bombardment role together. The ships returned to Majuro on 4 May. &quot;South Dakota&quot; conducted more shooting practice at sea on 15–16 May.

==== The Mariana and Palau Islands ====

TF 58 sortied on 6 June to begin Operation Forager, the invasion of the Mariana Islands. &quot;South Dakota&quot; operated as part of TG 58.7, again under Lee&#x27;s command. The unit now included six other battleships, four heavy cruisers, and thirteen destroyers. They were again tasked primarily with escorting the fast carrier strike force, providing protection against surface forces and their ample anti-aircraft batteries to defend against hostile aircraft. The carriers began their raids on 11 June and continued for several days. Japanese aircraft launched the first of several counter-attacks later that night and &quot;South Dakota&quot; used her air search radar to help vector fighters from the CAP to intercept them. As the Japanese made their approach, &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s 5-inch guns opened fire. On 13 June, &quot;South Dakota&quot; and the other battleships were sent to shell Saipan and Tinian in advance of the arrival of the old battleships of the bombardment group the following day. Japanese artillery attempted to engage them but &quot;South Dakota&quot; and the other battleships easily outranged them. &quot;South Dakota&quot; bombarded the area around Tanapag Harbor for some six hours, hitting two transports in the port and starting several fires in the town. The shelling was generally ineffective, however, as the battleships were not sufficiently experienced with shore bombardment, and Japanese defenses were largely undamaged.

On 14 June, &quot;South Dakota&quot; refueled some of the escorting destroyers and employed her Kingfishers to rescue downed pilots from the carriers. The next day, the marines went ashore on Saipan, a breach of Japan&#x27;s inner defensive perimeter that triggered the Japanese fleet to launch a major counter-thrust with the 1st Mobile Fleet, the main carrier strike force. While the Japanese were approaching, local counter-attacks from land-based aircraft struck the fleet. The first of these hit on the evening of 15 June, with &quot;South Dakota&quot; shooting down one of the attackers. The ship refueled the next day, and on 17 June the carriers and escorting battleships left the Saipan area to meet the 1st Mobile Fleet after patrolling submarines had reported its approach through the Philippine Sea. On 18 June, Lee and Admiral Marc Mitscher, the commander of the fast carrier task force, discussed strategies for the coming battle, and Lee decided to deploy his battleships with the carriers to screen them during the anticipated Japanese attack, rather than pursue the Japanese fleet in a night action, as Mitscher suggested.

=====Battle of the Philippine Sea=====

Lee kept his ships steaming in a circle that was in diameter to cover a wide area as the Japanese scouts approached the fleet early on 19 June. &quot;South Dakota&quot; and the other battleships tracked these aircraft on their air search radars. By 10:04, &quot;South Dakota&quot; picked up the first wave of strike aircraft inbound and ordered her crew to general quarters. In the ensuing Battle of the Philippine Sea, the CAP fighters engaged the incoming aircraft at 10:43, but Japanese planes broke through and continued on to the fleet. One of these, a Yokosuka D4Y dive-bomber, hit &quot;South Dakota&quot; with a bomb at 10:49, blasting an hole in the deck, disabling a 40 mm mount, and killing twenty-four and wounding another twenty-seven men. Gun crews claimed to have shot the bomber down, but observers aboard &quot;Alabama&quot; stated that the plane evaded the fire and escaped.

At 11:50, a second wave of about twenty aircraft punched their way through the CAP. Two Nakajima B6N torpedo bombers attempted to launch their torpedoes at &quot;South Dakota&quot;, but heavy fire from her and &quot;Alabama&quot; forced them to break off their runs. Other aircraft targeted &quot;South Dakota&quot; at around 11:55, but she again emerged unscathed. Third and fourth waves hit the fleet later in the day, but &quot;South Dakota&quot; was not attacked during these actions. That evening, the men killed in the bomb hit were buried at sea; one of the wounded men succumbed to his injuries the next morning and he was buried as well. The battle continued throughout 20 June, but &quot;South Dakota&quot; did not see further action. The American strike aircraft had had to fly at extreme range to attack the retreating Japanese fleet, and so many were forced to ditch their aircraft after running out of fuel; &quot;South Dakota&quot; spent the next morning searching for downed aircrews. During this period, another man who had been wounded by the bomb hit died.

&quot;South Dakota&quot; turned to the east on 22 June; with the 1st Mobile Fleet having been badly mauled by Mitscher&#x27;s carrier strike, the invasion fleet off the Marianas was no longer under significant threat and the battleships of TG 58.7 could withdraw from the area. &quot;South Dakota&quot; was transferred to TG 58.2 and sent to Eniwetok on 23 June, arriving there four days later. From there, she got underway for Puget Sound by way of Pearl Harbor; while in Pearl Harbor on 2 July, she embarked a group of 248 wounded, 279 sailors, and 90 marines to carry them to the mainland. She reached Puget Sound on 10 July and disembarked her passengers and her own wounded crewmen the next day. She was then dry-docked for repairs that evening. The work was completed by 6 August and after being re-floated, she loaded ammunition on 19 August. Sea trials began two days later. She was then assigned to Task Unit (TU) 12.5.1 in company with a pair of destroyers on 25 August, departing for Pearl Harbor, which she reached on the last day of the month.

The ship took part in a series of gunnery exercises off Hawaii from 6 to 8 September, including anti-aircraft shooting and defending against simulated torpedo boat attacks. She replenished fuel and ammunition in Pearl Harbor on 9 September and departed two days later for further maneuvers. During these exercises, she experienced difficulties with her engines; divers inspected the screws and discovered that several of the blades on three of her four propellers were bent or chipped. Instead of participating in the scheduled exercises, she had to return to dry dock in Pearl Harbor for repairs that lasted until 16 September. She resumed training operations that day before getting underway to re-join the fleet on 18 September. TU 12.5.1 initially headed to Seeadler Harbor in Manus Island off New Guinea, but while en route they were redirected to Ulithi, which had recently been seized to serve as the fleet&#x27;s advance base. They reached their destination on 30 September, by which time Third Fleet had taken operational control of the fast carrier task force.

====Okinawa and Formosa raids====

On 3 October, the fleet at Ulithi was forced to go to sea to avoid being caught in harbor by a typhoon that struck that night. After returning to the anchorage the next morning, the stores ship accidentally collided with &quot;South Dakota&quot;, striking her port side and inflicting only superficial damage. On 5 October, Hanson came back aboard the ship and she resumed her role as the flagship of BatDiv 9. The next day, TF 38, to which BatDiv 9 had been assigned, sortied to embark on the next major operation, a series of carrier raids on Japanese positions in the western Pacific. The fast carrier task force, still under Mitscher&#x27;s command, steamed north to launch strikes on the Okinawa Islands; they arrived early on the morning of 10 October and began the raid, which sank twenty-nine Japanese vessels in the area. Early the next morning, the battleship picked up a radar contact at long range and &quot;South Dakota&quot; confirmed the contact; it turned out to be a G4M bomber shadowing the task force that was shot down by one of the CAP fighters.

After leaving the Okinawa area, Mitscher turned to make a feint toward the Philippines late in the day before turning west toward Formosa, which he attacked in a major raid beginning on 12 October. The aircraft inflicted significant damage to Japanese installations around the island, bombing airfields, factories, and other military facilities and sinking eighteen ships and damaging six more. A G4M dropped chaff to interfere with the fleet&#x27;s search radars, but the measure was only partially effective and the bomber was shot down. CAP intercepted three waves of bombers, but they were able to approach the fleet much closer before being detected, possibly as a result of the chaff. &quot;South Dakota&quot; opened fire with her 5-inch guns at 19:03 as the first wave arrived before the target turned away. The second wave reached the fleet about twenty minutes later and &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s gunners engaged it as well. The Japanese air strikes convinced Mitscher to disengage to the east before returning the next morning for another attack. While the Americans were withdrawing, Japanese aircraft repeatedly attacked the ships, though &quot;South Dakota&quot; initially held her fire since no aircraft approached close enough for her to engage them. At 22:31, she reported shooting down one aircraft, and she kept another group of aircraft at bay with long-range 5-inch fire closer to midnight.

The carriers returned to their strike positions on 13 October, but Japanese aircraft counter-attacked almost immediately, though this first wave was broken up by CAP fighters. Several waves of G4M bombers struck the fleet, torpedoing the cruiser . &quot;South Dakota&quot; maneuvered at high speed to avoid their torpedoes while engaging the bombers. The American carriers launched another round of strikes the next day to cover the withdrawal of &quot;Canberra&quot; and her escorts. Later that afternoon, lookouts on &quot;South Dakota&quot; spotted a wave of seven B6N torpedo bombers approaching the fleet; she opened fire on the two closest aircraft, shooting one of them down. Five more were destroyed by fire from other ships in the area. The fast carrier task force then withdrew to support the invasion of the Philippines.

====Philippines campaign====
=====Battle of Leyte Gulf=====
The landing on Leyte on 17 October triggered the Japanese high command to initiate Operation &quot;Shō-Gō&quot; 1, a complicated counter-thrust that involved four separate fleets converging on the Allied invasion fleet to destroy it. The 1st Mobile Fleet, now labeled the Northern Force, had been significantly reduced in strength by three years of combat and was intended to serve only as a distraction to lure the American fast carrier task force away from the invasion fleet. Meanwhile, Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s Center Force would pass through the San Bernardino Strait and attack the invasion fleet. The Americans detected Kurita&#x27;s approach, however, and the carriers launched a major attack on his fleet while it passed through the Sibuyan Sea. After losing the powerful battleship in the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea on 24 October, Kurita temporarily reversed course. This convinced Halsey, now the commander of Third Fleet, to send the fast carrier task force to destroy the 1st Mobile Fleet, which had by then been detected.

Later that evening, Commodore Arleigh Burke, Mitscher&#x27;s Chief of Staff, suggested that Mitscher detach &quot;South Dakota&quot; and &quot;Massachusetts&quot; (along with a pair of light cruisers and a destroyer screen) to send them ahead of the carriers to fight a night action with the Northern Force. Mitscher agreed, and at 17:12 ordered RADM Forrest Sherman to put the plan into action. Halsey intervened before Sherman could send the ships north and overruled Mitscher, ordering them to keep the battleships with the main fleet. As Halsey sent Mitscher north to pursue the Japanese carriers, he established TF  34, consisting of &quot;South Dakota&quot; and five other fast battleships, seven cruisers, and eighteen destroyers, commanded by now Vice Admiral Lee. TF 34 was arrayed ahead of the carriers, serving as their screen.

On the morning of 25 October, Mitscher began his first attack on the Northern Force, initiating the Battle off Cape Engaño; over the course of six strikes on the Japanese fleet, the Americans sank all four carriers and damaged two old battleships that had been converted into hybrid carriers. Unknown to Halsey and Mitscher, Kurita had resumed his approach through the San Bernardino Strait late on 24 October and passed into Leyte Gulf the next morning. While Mitscher was occupied with the decoy Northern Force, Kurita moved in to attack the invasion fleet; in the Battle off Samar, he was held off by a group of escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts, TU 77.4.3, known as Taffy 3. Frantic calls for help later that morning led Halsey to detach Lee&#x27;s battleships to head south and intervene. However, Halsey waited more than an hour after receiving orders from Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet, to detach TF 34; still steaming north during this interval, the delay added two hours to the battleships&#x27; voyage south. A need to refuel destroyers further slowed TF 34&#x27;s progress south.

Heavy resistance from Taffy 3 threw Kurita&#x27;s battleships and cruisers into disarray and led him to break off the attack before &quot;South Dakota&quot; and the rest of TF 34 could arrive. Halsey detached the battleships &quot;Iowa&quot; and as TG 34.5 to pursue Kurita through the San Bernardino Strait while Lee took the rest of his ships further southwest to try to cut off his escape, but both groups arrived too late. The historian H. P. Wilmott speculated that had Halsey detached TF 34 promptly and not delayed the battleships by refueling the destroyers, the ships could have easily arrived in the strait ahead of Center Force and, owing to the marked superiority of their radar-directed main guns, destroyed Kurita&#x27;s ships. &quot;South Dakota&quot; refueled at sea on 26 October before in turn refueling a pair of destroyers two days later. She refueled another two destroyers on 30 October, though the process was temporarily interrupted by the appearance of a G4M. On 1 November, &quot;South Dakota&quot; was transferred to BatDiv 6, though Hanson remained aboard the ship until her replacement, the new battleship , arrived later that month. &quot;South Dakota&quot; withdrew to Ulithi the following day.

=====Later operations=====
Immediately on arrival in Ulithi on 2 November, &quot;South Dakota&quot; sortied as part of TG 38.1, tasked with supporting ground forces ashore on Leyte that had encountered heavy Japanese resistance. On 4 November, &quot;South Dakota&quot; was transferred to TG 38.3 to support a group of four carriers launching strikes on Luzon the next day. The group came under air attack on the afternoon of 5 November; errant rounds from other ships accidentally killed a man and wounded seven more aboard &quot;South Dakota&quot; during the action. Another wave of aircraft approached the following morning, prompting the fleet to assume a defensive formation. The Japanese planes did not attack, however, and the fleet returned to its cruising formation. &quot;South Dakota&quot; spent the next several days refueling destroyers and replenishing her own fuel bunkers. The carriers launched another series of raids on 13 and 14 November before withdrawing to Ulithi, arriving on 17 November.

The next day Hanson transferred to &quot;Wisconsin&quot; and Lee, who was by now the Commander Battleships, Pacific Fleet, came aboard the ship, making her his flagship. &quot;South Dakota&quot; and the rest of TG 38.3 sortied on 22 November. The unit by this time consisted of two fleet and two light carriers, &quot;South Dakota&quot; and the two s, three cruisers, and two destroyer squadrons. Most of the ships conducted gunnery training while the carriers conducted strikes independently against targets in the Philippines over the next three days. &quot;South Dakota&quot; spent the rest of the month taking part in anti-aircraft training and refueling destroyers. She arrived back in Ulithi on 2 December, where the crew made repairs and loaded ammunition and stores for future operations.

On 11 December, TG 38.3 departed Ulithi to join the rest of TF 38 for an assault on the island of Mindoro; the purpose of the operation was to seize a large airfield that could be used to support the invasion of Luzon. The carriers began a series of strikes on airfields on Luzon on 14 December to destroy or otherwise prevent Japanese aircraft there from interfering with the landing on Mindoro. The American raids continued over the next several days and significantly degraded the remaining strength of Japanese air forces in the Philippines. Late in the day on 17 December, Typhoon Cobra swept through the area, battering the fleet, sinking three destroyers, and inflicting serious damage to several other vessels, though &quot;South Dakota&quot; emerged relatively unscathed. The damage inflicted on the fleet delayed further support of ground troops for two days and the continuing bad weather led Halsey to break off operations; the ships arrived back in Ulithi on 24 December.

TF 38 refueled over the next several days and embarked on another raid on Formosa on 3–4 January 1945, but bad weather hampered flight operations and Halsey broke off the operation, having achieved little. The ships returned to the Philippines and made repeated strikes on Lingayen over the course of 6 and 7 January in preparation for the next landing, particularly targeting the airfields being used by the kamikaze suicide aircraft. The ships then entered the South China Sea on 10 January and refueled before conducting a further series of strikes against various targets in the region, including Formosa on 21 January and the Ryuku Islands the following day.

====Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa====
By early February, Fifth Fleet had resumed control of the fast carrier task force and &quot;South Dakota&quot; was transferred to TG 58.3, along with &quot;New Jersey&quot;, the large cruiser , and several other warships. The fleet carriers conducted a series of air strikes on Japan, targeting the Tokyo area on 17 February, but bad weather made it difficult for the aircraft to operate. The ships of TG 58.3 were then sent to reinforce the invasion fleet during the Battle of Iwo Jima from 19 to 22 February. The carriers made repeated strikes as the marines went ashore on the first day of the landing. The ships of TF 58 were then recalled for another series of raids on Japan, targeting Tokyo on 25 February; planned attacks on Kobe and Nagoya were cancelled due to poor weather.

The fleet then returned to Ulithi to replenish ammunition and fuel before embarking on another raid of Japan in mid-March. The carriers struck Kyushu on 18 March while the battleships continue their air defense role. Four days later, having inflicted serious damage on airfields and several warships in Kure, the task force withdrew to refuel. The following day, air strikes to prepare Okinawa for assault began, interrupted by the need to disengage and refuel on 28–29 March. The initiation of major attacks on the island, a clear indicator of an impending amphibious assault, led the Japanese to begin a serious, concentrated kamikaze campaign against the fleet, damaging numerous vessels but not seriously impeding the Allies&#x27; progress. Over the coming weeks, the task groups of TF 58 rotated through the waters off Okinawa, two groups at a time, to allow the other groups to replenish fuel and ammunition and repair battle damage. Throughout the maelstrom off Okinawa, &quot;South Dakota&quot; emerged without having been hit by any of the kamikazes.

On 19 April, &quot;South Dakota&quot; was detached from the carriers to join a shore bombardment group sent to support a major offensive by XXIV Army Corps against Japanese defensive positions in southern Okinawa, though they made little progress. The ships of TF 58 then departed for a raid on the Sakishima Islands before withdrawing to Leyte. After replenishing there, the task groups resumed their rotations off Okinawa for the next week. On 6 May, &quot;South Dakota&quot; was replenishing ammunition from the ammunition ship when a tank of propellant for the guns exploded. The blast detonated four more tanks and caused a serious fire, forcing the crew to flood the magazine for turret number 2 to avoid a catastrophic explosion. Three men were killed by the explosion and eight more were seriously wounded and later died; another twenty-four were less-seriously injured in the accident.

&quot;South Dakota&quot; was detached from TG 58.4 for repairs at Ulithi on 13 May in company with a pair of escorting destroyers, arriving there the next day. She entered the auxiliary floating drydock to be inspected. The ship&#x27;s propellers, shafts, and strut bearings all had worn badly and suffered from pitting. These were repaired and she was refloated on 27 May; during this period, Third Fleet resumed command of the fast carrier task force, reverting all subordinate unit designations to the 30-series. Two days later, &quot;South Dakota&quot; went to sea to begin anti-submarine training with a pair of destroyers. Further combat practice, including main-battery and anti-aircraft gunnery practice and night combat training, continued over the next several days, during which time the ship crossed the Philippine Sea to Leyte Gulf. A reorganization of TF 38 saw &quot;South Dakota&quot; reassigned to TG 38.1 on 16 June, the same day she became the flagship of RADM John F. Shafroth Jr. The ship took part in more anti-aircraft training from 23 to 24 June.

====Bombardments of Japan====
With Okinawa in Allied hands, preparations were beginning for Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu. TF 38 sortied from Leyte on 1 July to begin a series of strikes on targets in Japan to deplete Japanese forces in the Home Islands. While en route, &quot;South Dakota&quot; kept several destroyers fueled before the fleet arrived off the coast of Japan on 10 July. The carriers began their raids that day, though the Japanese had anticipated the attacks and had dispersed and camouflaged their aircraft, holding them back for the eventual landing instead of losing them prematurely. As a result, the carrier aircraft found few Japanese planes to destroy over the next several days. On 14 July, &quot;South Dakota&quot; was assigned to TU 38.8.1 with &quot;Indiana&quot;, &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, two heavy cruisers, and nine destroyers. The battleships were then sent to bombard the town of Kamaishi to destroy the Kamaishi Steel Works, but the mountainous terrain made targeting the facility difficult. This was the first time that Japan came under bombardment by capital ships during the war. Despite their difficulty in observing the effects of their shooting, in the course of six passes, the battleships inflicted what was later estimated to have been a two-and-a-half-month interruption in coke production and a one-month disruption of pig iron manufacture.

The battleships then returned to their positions with TF 38 and covered them during air strikes on Honshu and Hokkaido on 15 July. Further reinforced by the British Pacific Fleet, the Allied fleet struck targets around Tokyo on 17 July, sinking or damaging several warships in the area. Over the course of 20 through 22 July, &quot;South Dakota&quot; replenished fuel, ammunition, and other supplies at sea. Additional carrier strikes were made from 24 to 28 July, inflicting further losses to the remnants of the Japanese fleet; the battleships , , and were all sunk at their moorings, along with a number of cruisers, destroyers, and other warships. TU 38.8.1 was re-formed on 29 July to bombard Hamamatsu; this time, &quot;South Dakota&quot;, &quot;Indiana&quot;, and &quot;Massachusetts&quot; were reinforced by the British TU 37.1.2, centered on the battleship , and they were covered by CAP fighters from the carrier . The battleships opened fire shortly before midnight on 29 July and continued firing into the early hours of the 30th.

The ships withdrew shortly after ceasing fire with &quot;South Dakota&quot; in the lead of the formation. The task unit was again dissolved later that morning and &quot;South Dakota&quot; returned to TG 38.1, which thereafter resumed launching air strikes on the Tokyo and Nagoya areas. Another typhoon threatened the fleet, but Halsey steered the ships out of its way on 31 July and 1 August. &quot;South Dakota&quot; refueled on 3 August and the carriers launched simulated strikes on the fleet for anti-aircraft training two days later. &quot;South Dakota&quot; again replenished her fuel bunkers on 7 August before re-forming TU 34.8.1 for a third bombardment mission on 9 August. This time, the unit consisted of &quot;South Dakota&quot;, six Allied cruisers and ten Allied destroyers. &quot;South Dakota&quot; shelled Kamaishi that afternoon for a period of about an hour and a half before disengaging. As the ships withdrew, a single Japanese plane attacked them but evaded all fire from the ships and escaped. &quot;South Dakota&quot; returned to TG 38.1 and supported the carriers during further strikes on airfields later that day and on the 10th. Shafroth transferred to &quot;Alabama&quot; on 12 August and &quot;South Dakota&quot; was reassigned to TG 38.3 the next morning.

====End of the war====
TF 38 carriers had already launched aircraft on the morning of 15 August when Halsey received word that the Japanese had agreed to surrender unconditionally. The aircraft were recalled and &quot;South Dakota&quot; received the order to cease offensive operations at 06:58. Problems communicating their surrender to all subordinate units led to some Japanese aircraft launching attacks on the fleet later that day, but they were all shot down by CAP aircraft. &quot;South Dakota&quot; spent the next several days refueling and replenishing ammunition before steaming to Sagami Wan on 27 August as part of the initial occupation of Japan. Two days later, she moved to Tokyo Bay; that afternoon, Halsey and Nimitz came aboard the ship. Halsey left later in the day, but Nimitz remained until he left for the battleship , where the formal surrender ceremony took place on 2 September. Nimitz returned later that day before departing for Guam on 3 September and &quot;South Dakota&quot; came alongside &quot;Missouri&quot; to transfer Halsey and his staff to the ship. &quot;South Dakota&quot; thereafter served as Halsey&#x27;s flagship while he directed the initial stages of the occupation.

Halsey remained aboard until 20 September when he left to return to Pearl Harbor. &quot;South Dakota&quot; got underway that afternoon in company with numerous other warships for the voyage back to the United States. &quot;South Dakota&quot; stopped in Buckner Bay in Okinawa on 23 September and then resumed her journey across the Pacific the next morning with some 600 sailors, soldiers, and marines aboard. The ships passed Hawaii and thereafter dispersed to different ports; &quot;South Dakota&quot; entered San Francisco on 27 October, with Halsey once again aboard for Navy Day celebrations. Governor Earl Warren boarded the ship for the ceremonies. Two days later, she steamed down to San Pedro, California.

=== Post-war ===
On 3 January 1946, &quot;South Dakota&quot; got underway for the Atlantic; she steamed south and transited the Panama Canal a final time and steamed north to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, arriving there on 20 January. She then underwent an overhaul in preparation for deactivation. A month later on 21 February, RADM Thomas R. Cooley hoisted his flag aboard the ship, making her the flagship of the Fourth Fleet, a reserve unit. Cooley&#x27;s tenure aboard the ship was brief and he was replaced by Vice Admiral Charles H. McMorris just five days later. On 3 July, McMorris transferred his flag to the heavy cruiser and the Navy dissolved the Fourth Fleet on 1 January 1947. &quot;South Dakota&quot; was decommissioned on 31 January and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

Plans were drawn up during the period she was in reserve to modernize &quot;South Dakota&quot; and the other ships of her class should they be needed for future active service. In March 1954, a program to equip the four ships with secondary batteries consisting of ten twin guns were proposed, but the plan came to nothing. Another plan to convert the ship into a guided missile battleship arose in 1956–1957, but the cost of the conversion proved to be prohibitive. She would have had all three main battery turrets removed and replaced with a twin RIM-8 Talos missile launcher forward, two RIM-24 Tartar launchers aft, anti-submarine weapons, and equipment to handle helicopters. The cost of the project amounted to $120 million.

The ship remained in the Navy&#x27;s inventory for another fifteen years before being stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1962. &quot;South Dakota&quot; was sold to the Lipsett Division of Luria Brothers and Co. to be broken up for scrap on 25 October. Tugboats towed her from Philadelphia in November to Kearny, New Jersey to be dismantled. Some parts of the ship were retained through the efforts of the Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce, and they were installed in a memorial to the ship in the city on 7 September 1969. The memorial consists of a low concrete wall built in the outline of the ship in full scale, and artifacts from the ship, including an anchor, a simulated gun turret, and a 16-inch gun are displayed in the outline. A museum was erected in the center of the outline, and it displays other artifacts, including her bell, sailors&#x27; uniforms, a scale model of &quot;South Dakota&quot;, and various other displays. Additional artifacts from the ship are preserved at the National Museum of the United States Navy, including one of &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s screws and a section of armor plate. Both items are on display in Willard Park.

<doc id="206165" wikidata="Q4303510" url="?curid=206165" title="Leslie Morshead">
<text>Lieutenant General Sir Leslie James Morshead, (18 September 1889 – 26 September 1959) was an Australian soldier, teacher, businessman, and farmer, whose military career spanned both world wars. During the Second World War, he led the Australian and British troops at the Siege of Tobruk (1941) and at the Second Battle of El Alamein, achieving decisive victories over Erwin Rommel&#x27;s &quot;Afrika Korps&quot;. His soldiers nicknamed him &quot;Ming the Merciless&quot;, later simply &quot;Ming&quot;, after the villain in the Flash Gordon comics.

When the First World War broke out in August 1914, Morshead resigned his teaching position and his commission in the Cadet Corps to travel to Sydney and enlist as a private in the 2nd Infantry Battalion of the First Australian Imperial Force. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in September. He landed at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, and his battalion made the farthest advance of any Australian unit that day. Invalided to Australia, he became commander of the 33rd Infantry Battalion, which he led on the Western Front at Messines, Passchendaele, Villers-Bretonneux, and Amiens.

Between the wars Morshead made a successful business career with the Orient Steam Navigation Company, and remained active in the part-time Militia, commanding battalions and brigades. In 1939, he was appointed to command the 18th Infantry Brigade of the 6th Division in the Second Australian Imperial Force. In 1941, he became commander of the 9th Division, which he led in the Siege of Tobruk and the Second Battle of El Alamein. He returned to Australia in 1943, where he was appointed to command II Corps, which he led during the New Guinea campaign. In 1945, he commanded I Corps in the Borneo campaign.

== Early life ==
Morshead was born on 18 September 1889 in Ballarat, Victoria, the sixth of seven children of William Morshead, a gold miner who had emigrated from Cornwall via Canada, and his wife Mary Eliza Morshead, formerly Rennison, the Australian-born daughter of a fellow Cornish immigrant. William died when Morshead was six years old. He was educated at Mount Pleasant High School, where he was appointed a junior teacher in 1906.

In 1909, he became a student at the Melbourne Teachers Training College to obtain formal teaching qualifications. After his graduation in December 1910, he was awarded a scholarship to complete an education diploma at the University of Melbourne, but decided to defer for a year in order to teach at schools in country Victoria. He became a schoolteacher, teaching first at Tragowell in the Swan Hill district, and then at Fine View State School in the Horsham district. In 1911 he entered Trinity College at the University of Melbourne. After failing an exam in deductive logic, he decided to quit the state school system, and in 1912 took up a position at The Armidale School in the New England district of New South Wales. In 1914 he moved to the prestigious Melbourne Grammar School.

Morshead had been commissioned as a lieutenant in the Australian Army Cadets in 1908. At Armidale, he was appointed commander of the school cadet unit, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Militia on 10 February 1913. He was promoted to captain in September. At Melbourne Grammar he commanded a company in that school&#x27;s much larger cadet unit. While at Melbourne Grammar, he met Myrtle Catherine Woodside, the daughter of a Happy Valley, Victoria, grazier, and the sister of one of Morshead&#x27;s pupils.

== First World War ==

=== Gallipoli ===
Morshead&#x27;s teaching career was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. He resigned both his teaching position and his commission in the Cadet Corps and travelled up to Sydney to enlist as a private in the 2nd Infantry Battalion of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) because it was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George Braund, whom Morshead knew well from his time teaching in Armidale. Morshead&#x27;s time in the ranks was brief, as he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the AIF on 19 September. He embarked for Egypt on the transport &quot;Suffolk&quot; on 18 October 1914. While his battalion was in training there, he was promoted to captain on 8 January 1915.
The 2nd Infantry Battalion landed at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915. Morshead&#x27;s platoon transferred from the transport &quot;Derfflinger&quot; to the destroyer , which took it to within of the shore. They then transferred to wooden boats which were towed to the shore, arriving at around 09:30. The battalion made the farthest advance of any Australian unit that day, reaching the slopes of Baby 700, but was driven back by a Turkish counter-attack in the afternoon. It beat off further counter-attacks over the next three days. Morshead assumed command of C Company on 28 April. The battalion defeated major Turkish attacks on its position on 18 May and 8 June.

Promoted to major on 8 June, Morshead distinguished himself in the Battle of Lone Pine on 6 August. So intense was the fighting that of the 22 officers in the battalion, Morshead was the only one who did not become a casualty. However, on 16 September, like many others, he succumbed to dysentery and paratyphoid fever. He was evacuated to the 3rd General Hospital on Lemnos, and then to England on the hospital ship &quot;Aquitania&quot;, where he was admitted to the 3rd London General Hospital in Wandsworth, England. For his services in the Gallipoli campaign, he was mentioned in despatches.

=== Western Front ===
Morshead returned to Australia on 22 January 1916 where he was treated at the 4th General Hospital at Randwick, New South Wales. After he recovered, he was posted to the 33rd Infantry Battalion, which was being raised in Armidale as part of the 3rd Division. He became its commander on 16 April, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel three days later. He embarked for England again with his battalion on 4 May 1916.

The 33rd Infantry Battalion trained at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain in England until November 1916, when it embarked at Southampton for France. On 7 December it relieved a British battalion in the quiet &quot;nursery&quot; sector of the Western Front around Armentières. Morshead was mentioned in despatches, and awarded the Distinguished Service Order. His citation, written by his division commander, Major General John Monash, read:

Official historian Charles Bean described Morshead as:

Morshead subsequently led the 33rd Infantry Battalion through the Battle of Messines in June 1917, and the disastrous Battle of Passchendaele in October, where the 3rd Division suffered heavy losses. In March 1918, the 3rd Division was sent to the Somme sector to help halt the German Spring Offensive. The 9th Infantry Brigade, of which the 33rd Infantry Battalion was a part, was detached from the 3rd Division and sent to Villers-Bretonneux. On 30 March, the 9th Infantry Brigade&#x27;s commander, Brigadier General Charles Rosenthal, ordered Morshead to restore the front around Aubercourt. With the aid of the British 12th Lancers, the battalion was able to restore the line, although it was unable to advance as far as Rosenthal hoped. The 33rd Infantry Battalion was then relieved, and withdrawn to Villers-Bretonneux to rest. However, on 4 April, Morshead was astonished to find that the line had again been broken and Villers-Bretonneux threatened. In the First Battle of Villers-Bretonneux, the battalion participated in halting the advance, and prevented the Germans from capturing the town. On 18 April, the 33rd Infantry Battalion was still in the town when it was heavily shelled with poison gas. Many men, including Morshead, became mustard gas casualties. He did not return to his unit until June.

Morshead again led the 33rd Infantry Battalion in the Battle of Amiens. For the fighting in August 1918, he was awarded the French Légion d&#x27;honneur in the grade of Chevalier. His citation, written by his new division commander, Major General John Gellibrand, read:

For his service on the Western Front, Morshead was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in December 1919, and was mentioned in despatches three more times.

== Between the wars ==
Morshead returned to Australia in November 1919 and his AIF appointment was terminated in March 1920. He considered applying for a regular army commission, but found that these were reserved for graduates of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. He tried farming, accepting a soldier settlement block of near Quilpie, Queensland, but this venture was a failure, and he returned to Melbourne, where he married Myrtle at Scots Church, on 17 November 1921. They had a daughter, Elizabeth in 1923.

After working in odd jobs he joined the Orient Line in Sydney on 24 October 1924. He was appointed passenger manager of the Sydney office in 1926. Many Orient Line appointments followed. He became publicity manager in January 1927, acting manager of the Melbourne office in May 1928, passenger and publicity superintendent, and then temporary business manager of the Brisbane office in April 1931. He returned to Sydney, and then moved to the Melbourne office, where he became temporary office manager, a position which became permanent in December 1933; in 1937 he went back to the Sydney office.

All this time, he remained active in the part-time Militia, commanding the 19th Infantry Battalion from 1921 to 1925. He became commander of the 36th Infantry Battalion on 1 August 1926. He was promoted to colonel in 1933, and was appointed to command the 14th Infantry Brigade on 1 January 1933. When he moved to Melbourne in 1934, he transferred to command of the 15th Infantry Brigade, then part of the 3rd Division under Major General Sir Thomas Blamey. On returning to Sydney in 1937 he assumed command of the 5th Infantry Brigade. During a visit to England in 1937 as part of his duties with the Orient Line, he had occasion to observe the British Army on manoeuvres in East Anglia, and was impressed by the pace of modern mechanised forces. He also realised that the Australian Army was lagging a long way behind in both human and technical resources. He was promoted to brigadier in 1938. Known for his right-wing views even before the war, he was also a member of the clandestine far-right wing paramilitary organisation the New Guard.

== Second World War ==

=== Britain ===
On 6 October 1939, Morshead was selected by Blamey to command the 18th Infantry Brigade in the new 6th Division. This brigade was composed of four battalions from the smaller states, and would have been a natural assignment for a regular officer had Prime Minister Robert Menzies not restricted commands to senior posts to Militia officers, few of whom had much experience of the Army outside their home states. Morshead met with Blamey on 13 October to select officers for the new brigade. Like the other brigadiers, he was given a regular officer as brigade major, in this case Major Ragnar Garrett.
Morshead formally enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 10 October 1939 and was given the AIF serial number NX8. He was given the rank of colonel and made temporary brigadier three days later. A delay in preparing 18th Infantry Brigade&#x27;s camp in the Hunter Region meant that it was not concentrated there until December. In the meantime its battalions trained in their home states. After the 16th Infantry Brigade departed for Palestine in January 1940, the 18th Infantry Brigade moved into its vacated accommodation at Ingleburn, New South Wales. As a consequence, its training proceeded more slowly than that of the 16th and 17th Infantry Brigades.

The 18th Infantry Brigade finally embarked from Sydney on the &quot;Mauretania&quot; on 5 May 1940 but en route was diverted to the United Kingdom owing to the dangerous military situation there following the Battle of France. It moved into camps on Salisbury Plain, where the 3rd Division had trained back in 1916. The Australian force there under Major General Henry Wynter was poorly equipped but the 18th Infantry Brigade was nonetheless given an important role in the defence of Southern England. In September 1940, Wynter was informed that his force would become the nucleus of a new 9th Division, which he was appointed to command. Morshead and his 18th Infantry Brigade embarked for the Middle East on 15 November, reaching Alexandria on 31 December. Morshead was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 1 January 1941. Before his other two brigades could arrive from England and Australia, Wynter became seriously ill. Blamey decided to send him home and appointed Morshead to command the 9th Division on 29 January 1941.

According to Official historian Barton Maughan:
=== Tobruk ===
In February 1941, the 9th Division was completely reorganised, with its 18th and 25th Infantry Brigades transferred to the 7th Division. In return, it received the 20th and 24th Infantry Brigades, the latter short one battalion which was on garrison duty in Darwin. The 9th Division, less its partly trained and equipped artillery, was ordered to move to the Tobruk–Derna area where it would relieve the 6th Division, so that formation could participate in the Battle of Greece. The half-trained and half-equipped 9th Division was pitched into the thick of the action almost immediately, steadying the retreat of Commonwealth forces from the newly arrived German &quot;Afrika Korps&quot;, under General Erwin Rommel, and occupying the vital port of Tobruk. Morshead was given command of the Tobruk garrison which, as the retreat (known to the Australians as the &quot;Benghazi handicap&quot;) continued, became surrounded, hundreds of miles behind enemy lines. Lieutenant General John Lavarack determined that Tobruk could be held and ordered Morshead to defend it. He also ordered the 18th Infantry Brigade to reinforce the garrison, bringing it up to four brigades, with British artillery and tank units brought up to provide support.
General Sir Archibald Wavell instructed Morshead to hold the fortress for two months while the rest of Wavell&#x27;s forces reorganised and mounted a relief mission. With the 9th Division, 18th Infantry Brigade and supporting forces from various Allied nations, Morshead&#x27;s force decisively defeated Rommel&#x27;s powerful initial assaults, and retained possession of the fortress. His strategy for the defence of Tobruk is still mentioned in officer training colleges around the world as an example of how to arrange and conduct in-depth defences against a superior armoured force. An important part of Morshead&#x27;s tactics was conducting offensive operations when these were possible. His attitude was summed up in a reported remark, made when his attention was drawn to a British propaganda article entitled &quot;Tobruk can take it!&quot; Morshead commented: &quot;we&#x27;re not here to take it, we&#x27;re here to give it.&quot;

Aggressive use of snipers, artillery and counter-attacks achieved surprise at crucial junctures, and kept Rommel&#x27;s forces off balance. The Axis troops learned to fear the aggressive patrolling of the Australian infantry who dominated no-man&#x27;s-land and made constant raids on enemy forward positions for intelligence, to take prisoners, to disrupt attack preparations and minelaying operations, even to steal supplies that were not available in Tobruk. The troops were backed up by well-sited artillery and mobile reserves. The 9th Division held Tobruk not for eight weeks, but for eight months, during which time three separate relief campaigns by the main Allied force in Egypt failed. Axis propagandists described Morshead as &quot;Ali Baba Morshead and his 20,000 thieves&quot;, and branded the defenders of the port as the &quot;Rats of Tobruk&quot;, a sobriquet that they seized on and wore as a badge of pride. Morshead&#x27;s men referred to him humorously as &quot;Ming the Merciless&quot;, and later simply as &quot;Ming&quot;, after the villain in Flash Gordon comics.

By July 1941, Morshead had become convinced that his troops were becoming tired. Their health was deteriorating and, in spite of his efforts, their morale and discipline were slipping. He informed Generals Blamey and Auchinleck that they should be relieved. Auchinleck arranged for the 18th Infantry Brigade to be relieved by the Polish Carpathian Brigade so that it could rejoin the 7th Division in August but baulked at relieving the 9th Division. At this point, political considerations came into play. The newly installed government of Prime Minister John Curtin in Australia, on Blamey&#x27;s advice, took up the matter with Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who protested that the relief would cause a postponement of Operation Crusader. As it turned out, the operation had to be postponed anyway. In October 1941, Morshead and most of the 9th Division was replaced by the British 6th Division. This account is contradicted, in terms of the commander&#x27;s views, in the documentary &quot;Narrow Escapes of World War II&quot; (2012) &quot;Morshead Holds Tobruk&quot; with a statement that Morshead objected to the withdrawal. This information is recorded here merely to advise that a contrary account exists in the only documentary account. The documentary also adds important information on this stage of the siege. A description, with footage, is given of the extraordinary replacement operation which was undertaken entirely by sea over many nights, and was completed without the Axis becoming aware of it; according to the documentary. The 9th Division moved to Syria to serve as an occupation force, as well as resting, re-equipping and training reinforcements.

The Battle of Tobruk marked a rare defeat for German armoured forces at this stage of the war. For his part in the battle, Morshead was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 6 January 1942. He was also awarded the Virtuti Militari by the Polish government in Exile and was decorated by Generał broni Władysław Sikorski on 21 November 1941.

=== El Alamein ===

The outbreak of war with Japan in December 1941, and the imminent threat of invasion saw the 6th and 7th Divisions transferred to the Far East in early 1942. In March, Morshead was given command of all Australian forces in the Mediterranean theatre, and was promoted to lieutenant general, while still remaining commander of the 9th Division.

Morshead was one of only a few Allied divisional commanders with a distinct record of success at this stage of the war and had been acting commander of the British XXX Corps, a formation largely composed of Commonwealth troops, on two occasions. He had hopes that he might be given command of a corps, as Harry Chauvel had been in the Great War. Many war correspondents, including Gavin Long, thought that Morshead would be an excellent choice, but disagreements with Auchinleck had led to the latter labelling Morshead &quot;a difficult subordinate&quot;, who, while an excellent division commander, was not up to the demands of commanding a corps. Moreover, while Chauvel had been an Australian, he had been a regular officer, while Morshead was not. The new commander of the British Eighth Army, Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery felt that a reservist could not &quot;possess the requisite training and experience&quot; to command a corps. Morshead was passed over in favour of Oliver Leese, a British regular officer, who was junior to him and had never commanded a division in action.

At the Second Battle of El Alamein, the 9th Division was given responsibility for clearing a corridor through the German and Italian forces in the North and threatening to cut off those between the coastal road and the sea. In the initial assault the division hacked its way through the enemy defences but failed to clear the minefields. As the British attack faltered, the main effort switched to the 9th Division, which punched a massive dent into the German and Italian position over the next five days at great cost, &quot;crumbling&quot; the Afrika Korps in the process, and ultimately forcing Rommel to retreat. &quot;I am quite certain&quot;, Leese informed Morshead, &quot;that this breakout was made possible by Homeric fighting over your divisional sector.&quot; During the El Alamein Campaign, the 9th Division suffered 22% of the British Eighth Army&#x27;s casualties; 1,177 Australians were killed, while 3,629 were wounded, 795 were captured and 193 were missing. Morshead received yet another mention in despatches in June 1942, and in November 1942 he was also created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.

=== New Guinea Campaign ===

After El Alamein, Morshead and the 9th Division were recalled to the South West Pacific Area (SWPA). Morshead arrived in Fremantle on 19 February 1943 where he was welcomed home by Lieutenant General Gordon Bennett, who had been his divisional commander in Sydney between the wars. Morshead then flew to Melbourne where he was met by Lady Morshead, Sir Winston Dugan and Sir Thomas Blamey, who informed Morshead that he would take over command of a corps. In March 1943, Morshead became commander of II Corps, handing over command of the 9th Division to Major General George Wootten. The association between Morshead and the 9th Division was not entirely broken however, as it formed part of his corps, along with the 6th and 7th Divisions, all three of which were undergoing jungle warfare training on the Atherton Tableland for upcoming battles in New Guinea. It was Blamey&#x27;s intention that Morshead would spend some time learning the art of jungle warfare before his II Corps replaced Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring&#x27;s I Corps in New Guinea. Morshead&#x27;s chief of staff at II Corps was Brigadier Henry Wells, who had been his chief of staff at El Alamein.

In late September 1943, Morshead was summoned to New Guinea to relieve Herring by Lieutenant General Sir Iven Mackay, the commander of New Guinea Force, which he did on 7 October 1943. Morshead found a difficult situation. The Japanese not only held the high ground overlooking the Australian beachhead at Finschhafen, they were rapidly reinforcing their position and were about to mount a major counter-attack. Morshead demanded and got critical reinforcements, including Matilda tanks of the 1st Tank Battalion. The Japanese counter-attack was crushed. Morshead relieved Brigadier Bernard Evans of command of the 24th Infantry Brigade, replacing him with Brigadier Selwyn Porter, who had commanded a brigade in the Kokoda Track campaign. Unlike most reliefs of senior officers in SWPA this relief, while controversial at the time, has attracted little attention since.

Adjusting to jungle warfare was a challenge for both Morshead and his men. Gavin Long recalled that 

On 7 November 1943, Morshead became acting commander of New Guinea Force and Second Army on Mackay&#x27;s departure to become the Australian High Commissioner to India. This became permanent on 20 January 1944. Major General Frank Berryman became commander of II Corps. Because of some sensitivities concerning the relative seniority of Berryman and Major General George Alan Vasey, Blamey placed Vasey&#x27;s 7th Division directly under Morshead&#x27;s command. Vasey soon chafed under Morshead&#x27;s command, feeling that &quot;he has too many favourites both individually and collectively&quot;, with men who had served at El Alamein receiving preferential treatment. Morshead was in overall charge of the forces in New Guinea in the battles of Sattelberg, Jivevaneng, Sio and Shaggy Ridge. His perseverance was rewarded with the capture of Madang in April 1944.

=== Borneo campaign ===

Morshead handed over command of New Guinea Force to Lieutenant General Stanley Savige on 6 May 1944, and returned to Australia, where he remained the commander of the Second Army. Despite the fact that Morshead had been in command in an active area, some critics of the government picked up on the public announcement in November that Morshead would command Second Army, and charged that he had been &quot;shelved&quot;. On the contrary, Blamey had recommended to Curtin that Morshead should succeed him as commander-in-chief in the event that he became incapacitated. However, dealing with the politicians held little appeal for Morshead, and while he was pleased at the recognition, hoped that this would not occur.

In the event, this was not the end of Morshead&#x27;s wartime service, just a respite. In July 1944, Morshead was appointed as commander of I Corps on the Atherton Tableland. Although nominally a lesser command, it would be the spearhead of the Australian Army in subsequent operations. The staff was that of Morshead&#x27;s former II Corps, as the I and II Corps headquarters had exchanged names. In February 1945, Morshead received word that his objective would be Borneo. General Douglas MacArthur placed I Corps under his direct command for the operation. Morshead had to make a series of landings at Tarakan, North Borneo and Balikpapan on the east and north west coasts of the island. These were carried out with great efficiency, achieving their objectives with low casualties.

The British government proposed that British Lieutenant General Sir Charles Keightley be given command of a Commonwealth Corps for Operation Coronet, the proposed invasion of Honshu, the main island of Japan, but the Australian government had no intention of concurring with the appointment of an officer with no experience fighting the Japanese, and counter-proposed Morshead for the command. The war ended before the issue was resolved.

== Postwar life ==
After the war Morshead returned to civilian life, becoming the Orient Steam Navigation Company&#x27;s Australian general manager on 31 December 1947. He continued to receive honours for his military service, including a further mention in despatches in 1947 and the American Medal of Freedom with Silver Palm. He was president of the Bank of New South Wales, the chairman of David Jones, and director of several companies. From 1950 Morshead headed &#x27;The Association&#x27;, a secret organization similar to the New Guard movement with which he had been involved in the mid-1920s, and which was prepared to oppose communist attempts at subversion. It was quietly disbanded in 1952.

In later life, Morshead turned down various offers of military and diplomatic posts, as well as the governorship of Queensland. He did serve as president of the Boy Scouts Association of New South Wales and the Big Brother Movement, a British youth emigration support scheme, and was a trustee of the Gowrie scholarship trust fund, which provided assistance to the descendants of Second World War veterans. In 1957 he was appointed chairman of a committee which reviewed the group of departments concerned with defence. The Menzies government accepted the committee&#x27;s recommendation that Supply and Defence Production be amalgamated, but dropped the key proposal that the Department of Defence absorb the Departments of Army, Navy and Air. This reform was finally carried out by the Whitlam government in 1975.

Morshead died of cancer on 26 September 1959 at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Sydney. He was given a military funeral at which former soldiers of the 9th Division paid their respects, after which his body was cremated. He was survived by his wife and daughter. 
==Legacy==

Morshead was commemorated in several ways. Morshead Drive, which runs past the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in Canberra is named after him. In the Canberra suburb of Lyneham is the Morshead War Veterans Home, with high-dependency care and associated self-care two-bedroom houses. His portrait by Ivor Hele is held by the Australian War Memorial, as are his wartime papers.
A memorial fountain to Morshead stands opposite the State Library of New South Wales, at the entrance to Sydney&#x27;s Royal Botanic Gardens, designed by Robert Woodward, who also designed the El Alamein Fountain in Kings Cross.&#x27;

<text>The Phra Bang (, ; , , &quot;Royal Buddha Image in the Dispelling Fear mudra&quot;) is a statue of Buddha in the city of Luang Prabang, Laos; it is the namesake of that city. The statue stands at s, with palms facing forward, cast using &quot;thong&quot;, an alloy of bronze, gold, and silver. According to local lore, it was cast in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) sometime between the 1st and 9th century. However, the features of the image suggest a much later Khmer origin.

==Background==
The Phra Bang arrived in Lan Xang during the reign of Fa Ngum from Angkor and was used to spread Theravada Buddhism in the new kingdom. In 1359, the Khmer king gave the Phra Bang to his son-in-law, the first Lang Xang monarch Fa Ngum (1353–1373), to provide Buddhist legitimacy both to Fa Ngum&#x27;s rule and by extension to the sovereignty of Laos. The former Lao capital of Luang Prabang, where it was kept, is named after the image.

The Phra Bang has long been seen by devout Buddhists as a symbol of the right to rule Laos, as only a commendable and virtuous government deserves to be caretaker of such a sacred image. In 1705, it was taken to Vientiane. In 1778, the Siamese (now Thai) invaded Vientiane and captured the Phra Bang, taking it with them to Bangkok. There, political upheaval and misfortune were attributed to the statue, and in 1782, it was returned to the Lao people. Again in 1828, the Siamese captured the Phra Bang but once more returned it in 1867, after a similar period of political upheaval.

In 2013, the Phra Bang was moved from the Lao National Museum national museum in Vientiane to the Haw Pha Bang, on the Royal Palace grounds. Each year, on the third day of &quot;Pi Mai&quot;, or Lao New Year, the statue is taken in procession to Wat Mai. There, it is exhibited at a shrine, where the Buddha image is ritually bathed by devout laypeople during new year festivities.

<text>The Jack Russell Terrier is a British breed of small terrier. It is principally white-bodied and smooth-, rough- or broken-coated, and can be any colour.

It derives from dogs bred and used for fox-hunting in North Devon in the early nineteenth century by a country parson, Jack Russell – for whom the breed is named – and has similar origins to the modern Fox Terrier. Though closely similar, it is a distinct and different breed from the Parson Russell Terrier.

Jack Russells are an energetic breed that rely on a high level of exercise and stimulation. It has gone through several changes over the years, corresponding to different use and breed standards set by kennel clubs. Recognition by kennel clubs for the Jack Russell breed has been opposed by the breed&#x27;s parent societies – which resulted in the breeding and recognition of the &quot;Parson Russell&quot; terrier. Jack Russells have appeared many times in film, television, and print – with several historical dogs of note.

== History ==

=== Sporting parson ===
The small white fox-working terriers we know today were first bred by the Reverend John &quot;Jack&quot; Russell, a parson and hunting enthusiast born in 1795, and they can trace their origin to the now extinct English white terrier. Difficulty in differentiating the dog from the creature it was pursuing brought about the need for a mostly white dog, and so in 1819 during his last year of university at Exeter College, Oxford, he purchased a small white and tan terrier female named Trump from a local milkman in the nearby small hamlet of Elsfield or Marston. Trump epitomised his ideal Fox Terrier, which, at the time, was a term used for any terrier which was used to bolt foxes out of their burrows. Her colouring was described as &quot;...white, with just a patch of dark tan over each eye and ear; whilst a similar dot, not larger than a penny piece, marks the root of the tail.&quot; Davies, a friend of Russell&#x27;s, wrote: &quot;Trump was such an animal as Russell had only seen in his dreams&quot;. She was the basis for a breeding program to develop a terrier with high stamina for the hunt as well as the courage and formation to chase out foxes that had gone to ground. By the 1850s, these dogs were recognised as a distinct breed.

An important attribute in this dog was a tempered aggressiveness that would provide the necessary drive to pursue and bolt the fox, without resulting in physical harm to the quarry and effectively ending the chase, which was considered unsporting. Russell was said to have prided himself that his terriers never tasted blood. This line of terriers developed by John Russell was well respected for those qualities, and his dogs were often taken on by hunt enthusiasts. It is unlikely, however, that any dogs alive today can be proved to be descendants from Trump, as Russell was forced to sell all his dogs on more than one occasion because of financial difficulty, and had only four aged (and non-breeding) terriers left when he died in 1883.

The Fox terrier and Jack Russell terrier type dogs of today are all descended from dogs of that period. However, documented pedigrees earlier than 1862 have not been found. Several records remain of documented breeding by John Russell between the 1860s and 1880s. The Fox Terrier Club was formed in 1875 with Russell as one of the founder members; its breed standard was aspiration, and not a description of how the breed appeared then. By the start of the 20th century, the Fox Terrier had altered more towards the modern breed, but in some parts of the country the old style of John Russell&#x27;s terriers remained, and it is from those dogs that the modern Jack Russell type has descended.

Many breeds can claim heritage to the early Fox Terrier of this period, including the Brazilian Terrier, Japanese Terrier, Miniature Fox Terrier, Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz, Rat Terrier, and Tenterfield Terrier.

=== After John Russell ===
Following Russell&#x27;s death, the only people who made serious efforts to continue those strains were two men, one in Chislehurst with the surname of East, and another in Cornwall named Archer. East, at one point, had several couples, all of which were descended from one of Russell&#x27;s dogs. The type aimed for were not as big as the show Fox Terrier and were usually less than .

Arthur Blake Heinemann created the first breed standard and, in 1894, he founded the Devon and Somerset Badger Club, the aims of which were to promote badger digging rather than fox hunting, and the breeding of terriers suitable for this purpose. Terriers were acquired from Nicholas Snow of Oare, and they were likely descended from Russell&#x27;s original dogs, as Russell would probably have hunted at some point with Snow&#x27;s hunting club and is likely to have provided at least some of their original terriers. By the turn of the 20th century, Russell&#x27;s name had become associated with this breed of dog.

The club was later renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club. Badger digging required a different type of dog than fox hunting, and it is likely that Bull Terrier stock was introduced to strengthen the breed, which may have caused the creation of a shorter legged variety of Jack Russell terrier that started to appear around this period. At the same time that a split was appearing between show and working Fox terriers, a further split was occurring between two different types of white terrier, both carrying Jack Russell&#x27;s name. Heinemann was invited to judge classes for working terriers at Crufts with an aim to bring working terriers back into the show ring and influence those that disregard working qualities in dogs. These classes were continued for several years by various judges, but Charles Cruft dropped the attempt as the classes were never heavily competed. Following Heinemann&#x27;s death in 1930, the kennel and leadership of the club passed to Annie Harris, but the club itself folded shortly before World War II.

=== Post-World War II ===
Following World War II, the requirement for hunting dogs drastically declined, and with it the numbers of Jack Russell terriers. The dogs were increasingly used as family and companion dogs.

The Jack Russell Terrier Club of America (JRTCA) was formed in 1976 by Ailsa Crawford, one of the first Jack Russell terrier breeders in the United States. Size ranges for dogs were kept broad, with the ability of working dogs awarded higher than those in conformation shows. An open registry was maintained, with restricted line breeding. Registration for the club is made at adulthood for Jack Russells, rather than at birth, to ensure the breed&#x27;s qualities remain, given the open registry.

Several breed clubs appeared in the United Kingdom during the 1970s to promote the breed, including the Jack Russell Club of Great Britain (JRTCGB) and the South East Jack Russell Terrier Club (SEJRTC). The JRTCGB promoted the range of sizes that remain in its standards today, whereas the SEJRTC set a minimum height for dogs at . While the JRTCGB sought to ensure that the breed&#x27;s working ability remained through non-recognition with other breed registries, the SEJRTC activity sought recognition with the UK Kennel club. In 1983, the Parson Jack Russell Club of Great Britain (PJRTCGB) was resurrected to seek Kennel Club recognition for the breed. Although the application was initially rejected, a new standard was created for the PJRTCGB based on the standard of the SEJRTC, and under that standard the breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1990 as the Parson Jack Russell terrier. Jack was dropped from the official name in 1999, and the recognised name of the breed became the Parson Russell Terrier.

In the late 1990s, the American Kennel Club explored the possibility of recognising the Jack Russell Terrier. This move was opposed by the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America as they did not want the breed to lose its essential working characteristics. The Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association formed and petitioned the AKC; the breed&#x27;s admission was granted in 2001. Under the AKC-recognised standard, the size of the breed was narrowed from the previous club&#x27;s standard, and the name of the AKC-recognised Jack Russell Terrier was changed to Parson Russell Terrier, with the Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association renamed to the Parson Russell Terrier Association of America.

The Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) and the New Zealand Kennel Club (NZCK) are some of national kennel associations that register both the Jack Russell terrier and the Parson Russell terrier; however, the size requirements for the Jack Russell terrier under both those standards would classify a dog as a Russell terrier in the United States. In 2009, there were 1073 Jack Russells registered with the ANKC, compared to 18 for the Parson Russell terrier. Other modern breeds are often mistaken for modern Jack Russell terriers, including their cousin the Parson Russell terrier, the Tenterfield terrier, and the Rat Terrier. Several other modern breeds exist that descended from the early Fox Terrier breed, including the Brazilian Terrier, Japanese Terrier, Miniature Fox Terrier, Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz, Rat Terrier, and Tenterfield Terrier.

== Description ==

Due to their working nature, Jack Russell terriers remain much as they were some 200 years ago. They are sturdy, tough, and tenacious, measuring at the withers, and weigh . The body length must be in proportion to the height, and the dog should present a compact, balanced image. Predominantly white in colouration (more than 51%) with black and/or brown and/or tan markings, they exhibit either a smooth, rough or a combination of both which is known as a broken coat. A broken-coated dog may have longer hair on the tail or face than that which is seen on a smooth-coated dog.

The head should be of moderate width at the ears, narrowing to the eyes, and slightly flat between the ears. There should be a defined but not overpronounced stop at the end of the muzzle where it meets the head, and a black nose. The jaw should be powerful and well boned with a scissor bite and straight teeth. The eyes are almond shaped and dark coloured and should be full of life and intelligence. Small V-shaped ears of moderate thickness are carried forward on the head. When the dog is alert, the tip of the V should not extend past the outer corner of the eyes. The tail is set high and in the past was docked to approximately in order to provide a sufficient hand-hold for gripping the terrier.

The Jack Russell should always appear balanced and alert. The red fox is the traditional quarry of the Jack Russell terrier, so the working Jack Russell must be small enough to pursue it. Red foxes vary in size, but across the world, they average from in weight and have an average chest size of at the widest part.

=== Differences from related breeds ===
The Jack Russell terrier and Parson Russell Terrier breeds are similar, sharing a common origin, but have several marked differences – the most notable being the range of acceptable heights. Other differences in the Parson Russell can include a longer head and larger chest as well as overall a larger body size. The height of a Parson Russell at the withers according to the breed standard is which places it within the range of the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America&#x27;s standard size for a Jack Russell of . However, the Parson Russell is a conformation show standard whereas the Jack Russell standard is a more general working standard.

The Russell Terrier, which is also sometimes called the English Jack Russell terrier or the Short Jack Russell terrier is a generally smaller related breed. Both the breed standards of the American Russell Terrier Club and the English Jack Russell Terrier Club Alliance states that at the withers it should be an ideal height of . Although sometimes called the English or Irish Jack Russell terrier, this is not the recognised height of Jack Russells in the United Kingdom. According to the Jack Russell Club of Great Britain&#x27;s breed standard, it is the same size as the standard for Jack Russells in the United States, . Compared to the Parson Russell Terrier, the Russell Terrier should always be longer than tall at the withers, whereas the Parson Russell&#x27;s points should be of equal distance. The Fédération Cynologique Internationale standard for the Jack Russell terrier has this smaller size listed as a requirement. Terrierman Eddie Chapman, who has hunted in Devon for more than 30 years, the same area that John Russell himself hunted, notes that, &quot;I can state categorically that if given the choice, ninety-nine percent of hunt terrier men would buy an under worker, if it was available, over a one.&quot;

== Temperament ==
Jack Russells are first and foremost a working terrier. Originally bred to bolt foxes from their dens during hunts, they are used on numerous ground-dwelling quarry such as groundhog, badger, otter, and red and grey fox. The working Jack Russell terrier is required to locate quarry in the earth, and then either bolt it or hold it in place until they are dug to. To accomplish this, the dog will not bark but will expect attention to the quarry continuously. Because the preservation of this working ability is of highest importance to most registered JRTCA/JRTCGB breeders, Jack Russells tend to be extremely intelligent, athletic, fearless, and vocal dogs. It is not uncommon for these dogs to become moody or destructive if not properly stimulated and exercised, as they have a tendency to bore easily and will often create their own fun when left alone to entertain themselves, leading to the semi-affectionate nickname among suburban pet dogs of &quot;Jack Russell Terrorist&quot;.

Their high energy and drive make these dogs ideally suited to a number of different dog sports such as flyball or agility. Obedience classes are also recommended to potential owners, as Jack Russells can be stubborn at times and aggressive towards other animals and humans if not properly socialized. Despite their small size, these dogs are not recommended for the condominium or apartment dweller unless the owner is ready to take on the daunting task of providing the dog with the necessary amount of exercise and stimulation. They have a tremendous amount of energy for their size.

== Health ==

Due to their use in hunting, in the US the Jack Russell is prone to contracting skunk toxic shock syndrome.

A 2022 study of life expectancy of dogs in the UK using veterinary data found the Jack Russel Terrier to have an average life expectancy of 12 years and 9 months, this was higher than any other breed in the study including crossbreeds. A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.3 years compared to 12 years for crossbreeds and 12.7 years for purebreds overall. A 2024 Italian study found a life expectancy of 8 years for the breed compared to 10 years overall.

===Dermatological===
Black hair follicular dysplasia is a rare type of follicular dysplasia where only the black hairs of a bicolour or tricolour dog will be affected. Jack Russell Terriers are known to be a breed that may acquire the condition although it is seen in several breeds and in mongrels.

A type of ichthyosis that can be distinguished both clinically and histopathologically has been identified in separate Jack Russell Terrier families. This ichthyosis is also more severe than other forms. A mutation in the TGM1 gene has been found to be the cause.

=== Eye disorders ===
Primary lens luxation is an inherited condition that often occurs in Jack Russell Terriers as well as other breeds. A study identified a mutation in the ADAMTS17 gene as being responsible for the condition.

=== Haematology ===
Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a genetic disorder that is related to a defective antibody response. An autosomal recessive form of SCID has been reported in the Jack Russell Terrier. The condition usually results in death from an infection during the first few months. The allele responsible for the condition is found in less than 1.1% of Jack Russell Terriers and a DNA test exists for the condition.

=== Musculoskeletal ===
Patellar luxation, also known as luxating patella, is a hereditary disorder affecting the knees. It is where the kneecap slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place as if nothing has happened. Dogs can have a problem with both rear knees, and complications can include arthritis or torn knee ligaments. Severe cases can require surgery. Some are prone to dislocation of the kneecaps, inherited eye diseases, deafness and Legg Perthes—a disease of the hip joints of small dog breeds. Prone to mast cell tumors. Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, also called Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head, is where the ball section of the femur in the hip joint deteriorates following interruption of the blood flow and is the same condition as in humans. In dogs, this causes lameness of the hind-legs, the thigh muscles to atrophy and pain in the joint. It usually occurs between 6–12 months of age and has been documented in a variety of other terrier breeds including the Border terrier, Lakeland terrier, and Wheaten terrier.

===Neurological===
An inherited form of ataxia has been recognised within the Jack Russell Terrier for more than 50 years. Myokymia and seizures are often seen alongside the condition. A 2014 study identified the KCNJ10 gene as being responsible for the spinocerebellar ataxia accompanied by myokymia and/or seizures in the breed. This condition also affects the closely related Parson Russell Terrier and Russell Terrier.

A UK study found the Jack Russell Terrier to be predisposed to steroid-responsive meningitis-arteritis. The breed was 6.91 times more likely to contract the disease than other breeds.

== Well-known Jack Russell terriers ==
Nipper was a dog born in 1884 who was thought to be a dog of the Jack Russell terrier type. He was the inspiration for the painting &quot;Dog looking at and listening to a Phonograph&quot;, later renamed &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot;. The painting was used by a variety of music related companies including The Gramophone Company, EMI, the Victor Talking Machine Company, and RCA. Today it remains in use incorporated into the logo for the entertainment retailer, HMV.

A Jack Russell named Bothie made history in 1982 as part of the Transglobe Expedition. Owned by explorers Ranulph and Ginny Fiennes, he became the first dog to travel to both the North and South Poles. This feat is unlikely to be repeated, as all dogs have been banned from Antarctica by the Antarctic Treaty nations since 1994, due to fears that they could transmit diseases to the native seal population. Ranulph Fiennes and Charles Burton actually made the trip to the north pole by powered sledges before signalling to the base camp that they had arrived. To celebrate their achievement, a plane was sent out to take the two men champagne, along with Bothie.

On 29 April 2007, a Jack Russell named George saved five children at a carnival in New Zealand from an attack by two pit bulls. He was reported to have charged at them and held them at bay long enough for the children to get away, but he was killed by the pit bulls. He was posthumously awarded the PDSA Gold Medal in 2009, the animal equivalent of the George Cross. A statue has been erected in Manaia, New Zealand, in his memory. A former US Marine also donated to George&#x27;s owner a Purple Heart award he had received for service in Vietnam.

In 2019, Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds took a Jack Russell cross from an animal rescue charity in Wales. The dog&#x27;s name is Dilyn and he became a famous dog at a polling station in the general election.

During the ongoing 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, a 2-year old Jack Russell named Patron has been working with the State Emergency Service of Ukraine to sniff out Russian explosives. As of April 20, 2022, the Ukrainian Government announced that he had located nearly 90 explosives.

=== On screen and in literature ===

In the UK, one of the more recognisable canine stars was restaurateur and chef Rick Stein&#x27;s irrepressible terrier Chalky, who frequently upstaged his owner on his various cookery series. Chalky had his own line of merchandise, including plushes, tea towels, art prints, art paw prints and two real ales – &quot;Chalky&#x27;s Bite&quot; and &quot;Chalky&#x27;s Bark&quot;, which won gold in the Quality Drink Awards 2009. Chalky was given a BBC obituary when he died in 2007.

Moose and his son Enzo played the role of Eddie on the long-running American TV sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;. Eddie belonged to lead character Frasier&#x27;s father Martin Crane, and constantly &quot;stole the show&quot; with his deadpan antics, receiving more fan mail than any other &quot;Frasier&quot; character. Moose and Enzo also starred as Skip in the 2000 film &quot;My Dog Skip&quot;.

Soccer was a Jack Russell who became the star of the American TV series &quot;Wishbone&quot;, which aired from 1995 to 2001. In the 2009 movie &quot;Hotel for Dogs&quot;, Friday, one of the main characters, is a Jack Russell, played by the dog actor Cosmo. Cosmo went on to appear in the films &quot;Paul Blart: Mall Cop&quot; and &quot;Beginners&quot;.

Uggie (2002–2015) was an animal actor, appearing in commercials starting in 2005 and in the films &quot;Water for Elephants&quot; and &quot;The Artist&quot;, both in 2011. In the same year, based on interest following &quot;The Artist&quot;, the &quot;Consider Uggie&quot; campaign was launched, which attempted to gain the dog a nomination for an Academy Award. In 2012, Uggie was named Nintendo&#x27;s first-ever spokesdog.

Sykes (est. 2001–2019) was a dog actor from Clifton, Oxfordshire, England. He was best known in the UK for his appearance as &quot;Harvey&quot; in Thinkbox&#x27;s three television commercials, and, under his real name in five seasons of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;. He also appeared in several Hollywood blockbusters, as well as in a UK TV movie, several series and miniseries. He retired in 2016 after a long career on the big and small screen. Sykes was also a champion agility competitor.

A clever Jack Russel Terrier, named Jack, played a central role in the 1980s TV adventure series &quot;Tales of the Gold Monkey&quot;.

K.K. Slider is a Jack Russell who is a main character in the &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; video game series developed by Nintendo. K.K. is a musician who performs to the townsfolk. He has appeared in every &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; game to date since the original &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; game in 2001 to &quot;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&quot; in 2020.

Max, the main protagonist in Illumination&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Life of Pets&quot; franchise is a Jack Russell Terrier living with his adopted brother Duke, a large Newfoundland mix, and owners Katie, Chuck, and Liam.

<text>Francis Bacon (28 October 1909 – 28 April 1992) was an Irish-born British figurative painter known for his raw, unsettling imagery. Focusing on the human form, his subjects included crucifixions, portraits of popes, self-portraits, and portraits of close friends, with abstracted figures sometimes isolated in geometrical structures.

He said that he saw images &quot;in series&quot;, and his work, which numbers in the region of 590 extant paintings along with many others he destroyed, typically focused on a single subject for sustained periods, often in triptych or diptych formats. His output can be broadly described as sequences or variations on single motifs; including the 1930s Picasso-influenced bio-morphs and Furies, the 1940s male heads isolated in rooms or geometric structures, the 1950s &quot;screaming popes,&quot; the mid-to-late 1950s animals and lone figures, the early 1960s crucifixions, the mid-to-late 1960s portraits of friends, the 1970s self-portraits, and the cooler, more technical 1980s paintings.

Bacon did not begin to paint until his late twenties, having drifted in the late 1920s and early 1930s as an interior decorator, and gambler. He said that his artistic career was delayed because he spent too long looking for subject matter that could sustain his interest. His breakthrough came with the 1944 triptych &quot;Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion&quot;, which sealed his reputation as a uniquely bleak chronicler of the human condition. From the mid-1960s, he mainly produced portraits of friends and drinking companions, either as single, diptych or triptych panels. Following the suicide of his lover George Dyer in 1971 (memorialised in his &quot;Black Triptychs&quot;, and a number of posthumous portraits), his art became more sombre, inward-looking and preoccupied with the passage of time and death. The climax of his later period is marked by the masterpieces &quot;Study for Self-Portrait&quot; (1982) and &quot;Study for a Self-Portrait—Triptych, 1985–86&quot;.

Despite his existentialist and bleak outlook, Bacon was charismatic, articulate and well-read. A &quot;bon vivant&quot;, he spent his middle age eating, drinking and gambling in London&#x27;s Soho with like-minded friends including Lucian Freud (although they fell out in the mid-1970s, for reasons neither ever explained), John Deakin, Muriel Belcher, Henrietta Moraes, Daniel Farson, Tom Baker and Jeffrey Bernard. After Dyer&#x27;s suicide, he largely distanced himself from this circle, and while still socially active and his passion for gambling and drinking continued, he settled into a platonic and somewhat fatherly relationship with his eventual heir, John Edwards.

Since his death, Bacon&#x27;s reputation has grown steadily, and his work is among the most acclaimed, expensive and sought-after on the art market. In the late 1990s, a number of major works, previously assumed destroyed, including early 1950s pope paintings and 1960s portraits, re-emerged to set record prices at auction.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Francis Bacon was born on 28 October 1909 in 63 Lower Baggot Street in Dublin. At that time, all of Ireland was still part of the United Kingdom. His father, Army Captain Anthony Edward &quot;Eddy&quot; Mortimer Bacon, was born in Adelaide, South Australia, to an English father and an Australian mother. Eddy was a veteran of the Second Boer War, a racehorse trainer, and the grandson of Major-General Anthony Bacon, who claimed descent from Sir Nicholas Bacon, elder half-brother of Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount St Albans, who is better known as &quot;Sir Francis Bacon&quot;, the Elizabethan statesman, philosopher, and essayist. Bacon&#x27;s mother, Christina Winifred &quot;Winnie&quot; Firth, was heiress to a Sheffield steel business and coal mine. He had an older brother, Harley, two younger sisters, Ianthe and Winifred, and a younger brother, Edward.

Bacon was raised by the family nanny, Jessie Lightfoot, from Cornwall, known as &quot;Nanny Lightfoot&quot;, a maternal figure who remained close to him until her death. During the early 1940s, he rented the ground floor of 7 Cromwell Place, South Kensington, John Everett Millais&#x27;s old studio. Lightfoot helped him install an illicit roulette wheel there, organised by Bacon and his friends. It is believed by art critics that Bacon&#x27;s interest in a working-class perspective developed due to his relationship with Nanny Lightfoot.

The family moved between Ireland and England several times, leading to a sense of displacement which remained with Bacon throughout his life. They lived in Cannycourt House in County Kildare from 1911, later moving to Westbourne Terrace in London, close to where Bacon&#x27;s father worked at the Territorial Force Records Office. They returned to Ireland after the First World War. Bacon lived with his maternal grandmother and step-grandfather, Winifred and Kerry Supple, at Farmleigh, Abbeyleix, County Laois, although the rest of the family again moved to Straffan Lodge near Naas, County Kildare.

Bacon was a shy child and enjoyed dressing up. This, and his effeminate manner, angered his father. A story emerged in 1992 of his father having had Bacon horsewhipped by their grooms. He was often ill as a child, suffering from asthma and an allergy to horses. His poor health meant his formal education was sporadic; he received lessons at home from a private tutor, and from 1924 to 1926 attended Dean Close, a boarding school in Cheltenham. At a fancy-dress party at the family home, Bacon dressed as a flapper with an Eton crop, beaded dress, lipstick, high heels, and a long cigarette holder. Later that year, Bacon was thrown out of Straffan Lodge following an incident in which his father found him admiring himself in front of a large mirror wearing his mother&#x27;s underwear.

===London, Berlin and Paris===
Bacon spent the latter half of 1926 in London, on an allowance of £3 a week from his mother&#x27;s trust fund, reading Friedrich Nietzsche. He found that by avoiding rent and engaging in petty theft, he could survive. To supplement his income, he briefly tried his hand at domestic service, but although he enjoyed cooking, he became bored and resigned. He was sacked from a telephone-answering position at a shop selling women&#x27;s clothes in Poland Street in Soho after writing a poison pen letter to the owner.

Bacon found himself drifting through London&#x27;s homosexual underworld, aware that he was able to attract a certain type of rich man, something he was quick to take advantage of, having developed a taste for good food and wine. One was a relative of Winnie Harcourt-Smith, another breeder of racehorses, who was renowned for his manliness. Bacon claimed his father had asked this &quot;uncle&quot; to take him &#x27;in-hand&#x27; and &#x27;make a man of him&#x27;. Bacon had a difficult relationship with his father, once admitting to being sexually attracted to him. He moved to Berlin in 1927, where he saw Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; and Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;, both later to be influences on his work. He spent two months in Berlin, though Harcourt-Smith left after one: &quot;He soon got tired of me, of course, and went off with a woman ... I didn&#x27;t really know what to do, so I hung on for a while.&quot;

Bacon, then 17, spent the next year and a half in Paris. He met Yvonne Bocquentin, pianist and connoisseur, at the opening of an exhibition. Aware of his own need to learn French, Bacon lived for three months with Madame Bocquentin and her family at their house near Chantilly, Oise. He travelled into Paris to visit the city&#x27;s art galleries. At the Château de Chantilly (Musée Condé) he saw Nicolas Poussin&#x27;s &quot;Massacre of the Innocents&quot;, a painting which he often referred to in his later work.

Bacon moved back to London in the winter of 1928/29 to work as an interior designer. He took a studio at 17 Queensberry Mews West, South Kensington, sharing the upper floor with Eric Allden – his first collector – and his childhood nanny, Jessie Lightfoot. In 1929, he met Eric Hall, his patron and lover in an often torturous and abusive relationship. Bacon left the Queensberry Mews West studio in 1931 and had no settled space for some years. He probably shared a studio with Roy De Maistre circa 1931/32 in Chelsea.

===Furniture and rugs===

The 1933 &quot;Crucifixion&quot; was his first painting to attract public attention, and was in part based on Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;The Three Dancers&quot; of 1925. It was not well received; disillusioned, he abandoned painting for nearly a decade and suppressed his earlier works. He visited Paris in 1935 where he bought a secondhand book on anatomical diseases of the mouth containing high-quality hand-coloured plates of both open mouths and oral interiors, which haunted and obsessed him for the remainder of his life. These and the scene with the nurse screaming on the Odessa steps from the &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; later became recurrent parts of Bacon&#x27;s iconography, with the angularity of Eisenstein&#x27;s images often combined with the thick red palette of his recently purchased medical tome.

In the winter of 1935–36, Roland Penrose and Herbert Read, making a first selection for the &quot;International Surrealist Exhibition&quot;, visited his studio at 71 Royal Hospital Road, Chelsea saw &quot;three or four large canvases including one with a grandfather clock&quot;, but found his work &quot;insufficiently surreal to be included in the show&quot;. Bacon claimed Penrose told him &quot;Mr. Bacon, don&#x27;t you realise a lot has happened in painting since the Impressionists?&quot; In 1936 or 1937 Bacon moved from 71 Royal Hospital Road to the top floor of 1 Glebe Place, Chelsea, which Eric Hall had rented..

In January 1937, at Thomas Agnew and Sons, 43 Old Bond Street, London, Bacon exhibited in a group show, &quot;Young British Painters&quot;, which included Graham Sutherland and Roy De Maistre. Eric Hall organised the show. He showed four works: &quot;Figures in a Garden&quot; (1936); &quot;Abstraction&quot;, &quot;Abstraction from the Human Form&quot; (known from magazine photographs) and &quot;Seated Figure&quot; (also lost). These paintings prefigure &quot;Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion&quot; (1944) in alternatively representing a tripod structure (&quot;Abstraction&quot;), bared teeth (&quot;Abstraction from the Human Form&quot;), and both being biomorphic in form.

On 1 June 1940, Bacon&#x27;s father died. Bacon was named sole Trustee/Executor of his father&#x27;s will, which requested the funeral be as &quot;private and simple as possible&quot;. Unfit for active wartime service, Bacon volunteered for civil defence and worked full-time in the Air Raid Precautions (ARP) rescue service; the fine dust of bombed London worsened his asthma and he was discharged. At the height of the Blitz, Eric Hall rented a cottage for Bacon and himself at Bedales Lodge in Steep, near Petersfield, Hampshire. &quot;Figure Getting Out of a Car&quot; (ca. 1939/1940) was painted here but is known only from an early 1946 photograph taken by Peter Rose Pulham. The photograph was taken shortly before the canvas was painted over by Bacon and retitled &quot;Landscape with Car&quot;. An ancestor to the biomorphic form of the central panel of &quot;Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion&quot; (1944), the composition was suggested by a photograph of Hitler getting out of a car at one of the Nuremberg rallies. Bacon claims to have &quot;copied the car and not much else&quot;.

Bacon and Hall in 1943 took the ground floor of 7 Cromwell Place, South Kensington, formerly the house and studio of John Everett Millais. High-vaulted and north-lit, its roof was recently bombed – Bacon was able to adapt a large old billiard room at the back as his studio. Lightfoot, lacking an alternative location, slept on the kitchen table. They held illicit roulette parties, organised by Bacon with the assistance of Hall.

===Early success===
By 1944 Bacon had gained confidence and moved toward developing his unique signature style. His &quot;Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion&quot; had summarised themes explored in his earlier paintings, including his examination of Picasso&#x27;s biomorphs, his interpretations of the Crucifixion, and the Greek Furies. It is generally considered his first mature piece; he regarded his works before the triptych as irrelevant. The painting caused a sensation when exhibited in 1945 and established him as a foremost post-war painter. Remarking on the cultural significance of &quot;Three Studies&quot;, John Russell observed in 1971 that &quot;there was painting in England before the Three Studies, and painting after them, and no one ... can confuse the two.&quot;

&quot;Painting (1946)&quot; was shown in several group shows including in the British section of &quot;Exposition internationale d&#x27;art moderne&quot; (18 November – 28 December 1946) at the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne, for which Bacon travelled to Paris. Within a fortnight of the sale of &quot;Painting (1946)&quot; to the Hanover Gallery Bacon used the proceeds to decamp from London to Monte Carlo. After staying at a succession of hotels and flats, including the Hôtel de Ré, Bacon settled in a large villa, La Frontalière, in the hills above the town. Hall and Lightfoot would come to stay. Bacon spent much of the next few years in Monte Carlo apart from short visits to London. From Monte Carlo, Bacon wrote to Sutherland and Erica Brausen. His letters to Brausen show he painted there, but no paintings are known to survive. Bacon said he became &quot;obsessed&quot; with the Casino de Monte Carlo, where he would &quot;spend whole days&quot;. Falling in debt from gambling, he was unable to afford a new canvas. This compelled him to paint on the raw, unprimed side of his previous work, a practice he kept throughout his life.

In 1948, &quot;Painting (1946)&quot; sold to Alfred Barr for the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York for £240. Bacon wrote to Sutherland asking that he apply fixative to the patches of pastel on &quot;Painting (1946)&quot; before it was shipped to New York. (The work is now too fragile to be moved from MoMA for exhibition elsewhere.) At least one visit to Paris in 1946 brought Bacon into contact with French postwar painting and Left Bank ideas such as Existentialism. He had, by this time, embarked on his lifelong friendship with Isabel Rawsthorne, a painter closely involved with Giacometti and the Left Bank set. They shared many interests, including ethnography and classical literature.

===Late 1940s===
In 1947, Sutherland introduced Bacon to Brausen, who represented Bacon for twelve years. Despite this, Bacon did not mount a one-man show in Brausen&#x27;s Hanover Gallery until 1949. Bacon returned to London and Cromwell Place late in 1948.

The following year Bacon exhibited his &quot;Heads&quot; series, most notable for &quot;Head VI&quot;, Bacon&#x27;s first surviving engagement with Velázquez&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Pope Innocent X&quot; (three &#x27;popes&#x27; were painted in Monte Carlo in 1946 but were destroyed). He kept an extensive inventory of images for source material, but preferred not to confront the major works in person; he viewed &quot;Portrait of Innocent X&quot; only once, much later in his life.

===1950s===
Bacon&#x27;s main haunt was The Colony Room, a private drinking club at 41 Dean Street in Soho, known as &quot;Muriel&#x27;s&quot; after Muriel Belcher, its proprietor. Belcher had run the Music-box club in Leicester Square during the war, and secured a 3 – 11 pm drinking licence for the Colony Room bar as a private-members club. Bacon was an early member, joining the day after its opening in 1948. He was &#x27;adopted&#x27; by Belcher as a &#x27;daughter&#x27;, and allowed free drinks and £10 a week to bring in friends and rich patrons. In 1948 he met John Minton, a regular at Muriel&#x27;s, as were the painters Lucian Freud, Frank Auerbach, Patrick Swift and the &quot;Vogue&quot; photographer John Deakin.

In 1950, Bacon met the art critic David Sylvester, then best known for his writing on Henry Moore and Alberto Giacometti. Sylvester had admired and written about Bacon since 1948. Bacon&#x27;s artistic inclinations in the 1950s moved towards his abstracted figures which were typically isolated in geometrical cage-like spaces, and set against flat, nondescript backgrounds. Bacon said that he saw images &quot;in series&quot;, and his work typically focused more on a single subject for sustained periods, often in triptych or diptych formats. Although his decisions might have been driven by the fact that in the 1950s he tended to produce group works for specific showings, usually leaving things until the last minute, there is a significant development in his aesthetic choices during this period which influenced his preference for the represented content in his paintings.
On 30 April 1951, Jessie Lightfoot, his childhood nanny, died at Cromwell Place; Bacon was gambling in Nice when he learned of her death. She had been his closest companion, joining him in London on his return from Paris, and lived with him and Eric Alden at Queensberry Mews West, and later with Eric Hall near Petersfield, in Monte Carlo and at Cromwell Place. Stricken, Bacon sold the 7 Cromwell Place apartment.

In 1952, Bacon met Peter Lacy a pianist and former RAF pilot from a similar social background to himself. Lacy was a violent alcoholic who was disliked by Bacon&#x27;s contemporaries but was also described as the love of Bacon&#x27;s life. The pair engaged in an off and on relationship which had a significant S&amp;M aspect where Bacon would deliberately provoke acts of violence from Lacy. In the mid-1950s Lacy moved to Tangier, Morocco and Bacon also began to spend some of his time there.

In 1958 he aligned with the Marlborough Fine Art gallery, who remained as his sole dealer until 1992. In return for a 10-year contract, Marlborough advanced him money against current and future paintings, with the price of each determined by its size. A painting measuring 20 inches by 24 inches was valued at £165 ($462), while one of 65 inches by 78 inches was valued at £420 ($1,176); these were sizes Bacon favoured. According to the contract, the painter would try to supply the gallery with £3,500 ($9,800) worth of pictures each year.

===1960s and 1970s===
In 1962, Bacon&#x27;s lover Peter Lacy died from the effects of alcoholism the day before Bacon opened a retrospective exhibition in the Tate. Bacon met George Dyer in 1963 at a pub, although a much-repeated myth claims they met when Dyer burgled Bacon&#x27;s flat. Dyer was about 30 years old, from London&#x27;s East End. He came from a family steeped in crime and had till then spent his life drifting between theft and prison. Bacon&#x27;s earlier relationships had been with older and tumultuous men. His previous lover, Peter Lacy, had a reputation for tearing up Bacon&#x27;s paintings, beating him in drunken rages, and at times leaving him on streets half-conscious. Bacon was now the dominating personality, attracted to Dyer&#x27;s vulnerability and trusting nature. Dyer was impressed by Bacon&#x27;s self-confidence and success, and Bacon acted as a protector and father figure to the insecure younger man.

Dyer was, like Bacon, a borderline alcoholic and similarly took obsessive care with his appearance. Pale-faced and a chain-smoker, Dyer typically confronted his daily hangovers by drinking again. His compact and athletic build belied a docile and inwardly tortured personality, although the art critic Michael Peppiatt describes him as having the air of a man who could &quot;land a decisive punch&quot;. Their behaviours eventually overwhelmed their affair, and by 1970 Bacon was merely providing Dyer with enough money to stay more or less permanently drunk.

As Bacon&#x27;s work moved from the extreme subject matter of his early paintings to portraits of friends in the mid-1960s, Dyer became a dominating presence. Bacon&#x27;s paintings emphasise Dyer&#x27;s physicality, yet are uncharacteristically tender. More than any other of Bacon&#x27;s close friends, Dyer came to feel inseparable from his portraits. The paintings gave him stature, a &quot;raison d&#x27;etre&quot;, and offered meaning to what Bacon described as Dyer&#x27;s &quot;brief interlude between life and death&quot;. Many critics have described Dyer&#x27;s portraits as favourites, including Michel Leiris and Lawrence Gowing. Yet as Dyer&#x27;s novelty diminished within Bacon&#x27;s circle of sophisticated intellectuals, Dyer became increasingly bitter and ill at ease. Although Dyer welcomed the attention the paintings brought him, he did not pretend to understand or even like them. &quot;All that money an&#x27; I fink they&#x27;re reely &#x27;orrible,&quot; he observed with choked pride.

Dyer abandoned crime but descended into alcoholism. Bacon&#x27;s money attracted hangers-on for benders around London&#x27;s Soho. Withdrawn and reserved when sober, Dyer was highly animated and aggressive when drunk, and often attempted to &quot;pull a Bacon&quot; by buying large rounds and paying for expensive dinners for his wide circle. Dyer&#x27;s erratic behaviour inevitably wore thin with his cronies, with Bacon, and with Bacon&#x27;s friends. Most of Bacon&#x27;s art world associates regarded Dyer as a nuisance – an intrusion into the world of high culture to which &quot;their&quot; Bacon belonged. Dyer reacted by becoming increasingly needy and dependent. By 1971, he was drinking alone and only in occasional contact with his former lover.

In October 1971, Dyer joined Bacon in Paris for the opening of Bacon&#x27;s retrospective at the &quot;Grand Palais&quot;. While Bacon&#x27;s career was at a peak, he was described at the time as Britain&#x27;s &quot;greatest living painter&quot;, Dyer knew that his own importance to Bacon was in decline. To gain attention, he planted cannabis in his flat and phoned the police, and attempted suicide on a number of occasions. In Paris, Bacon and Dyer initially shared a hotel room, but Bacon left. When he returned on the morning of 24 October, with Danziger-Miles and Valerie Beston, they discovered Dyer&#x27;s body. They persuaded the hotel manager not to announce the death for two days.

Bacon spent the following day surrounded by people eager to meet him. In mid-evening of the following day, he was &quot;informed&quot; that Dyer had taken an overdose of barbiturates and was dead. Bacon continued with the retrospective and displayed powers of self-control &quot;to which few of us could aspire&quot;, according to Russell. Bacon was deeply affected by the loss of Dyer and had recently lost four other friends and his nanny. From this point, death haunted his life and work. Though outwardly stoic at the time, he was inwardly broken. He did not express his feelings to critics but later admitted to friends that &quot;daemons, disaster and loss&quot; now stalked him as if his own version of the Eumenides (Greek for The Furies). Bacon spent the remainder of his stay in Paris attending to promotional activities and funeral arrangements. He returned to London later that week to comfort Dyer&#x27;s family.

During the funeral, many of Dyer&#x27;s friends, including hardened East-End criminals, broke down in tears. As the coffin was lowered into the grave one friend was overcome and screamed &quot;you bloody fool!&quot; Bacon remained stoic during the proceedings, but in the following months suffered an emotional and physical breakdown. Deeply affected, over the following two years he painted a number of single canvas portraits of Dyer, and the three highly regarded &quot;Black Triptychs&quot;, each of which details moments immediately before and after Dyer&#x27;s suicide.

===Death===
While on holiday, Bacon was admitted to the private Clinica Ruber, Madrid in 1992. His chronic asthma, which had plagued him all his life, had developed into a more severe respiratory condition and he could not talk or breathe very well.

He died of a heart attack on 28 April 1992, aged 82. He bequeathed his estate (then valued at £11 million) to his heir and sole legatee John Edwards; in 1998, at Edwards&#x27; request, Brian Clarke, a friend of Bacon and Edwards, was installed as sole executor of the estate by the High Court, following the Court&#x27;s severing of all ties between Bacon&#x27;s former gallery, Marlborough Fine Art, and his estate. In 1998 the director of the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin secured Edwards&#x27; and Clarke&#x27;s donation of the contents of Bacon&#x27;s studio at 7 Reece Mews, South Kensington. The contents of his studio were surveyed, moved, and reconstructed in the gallery.

==Themes==

===The Crucifixion===
The imagery of the crucifixion weighs heavily in the work of Francis Bacon. Critic John Russell wrote that the crucifixion in Bacon&#x27;s work is a &quot;generic name for an environment in which bodily harm is done to one or more persons and one or more other persons gather to watch&quot;. Bacon admitted that he saw the scene as &quot;a magnificent armature on which you can hang all types of feeling and sensation&quot;. He believed the imagery of the crucifixion allowed him to examine &quot;certain areas of human behaviour&quot; in a unique way, as the armature of the theme had been accumulated by so many old masters.

Though he came to painting relatively late in life – he did not begin to paint seriously until his late 30s – crucifixion scenes can be found in his earliest works. In 1933, his patron Eric Hall commissioned a series of three paintings based on the subject. The early paintings were influenced by such old masters as Matthias Grünewald, Diego Velázquez and Rembrandt, but also by Picasso&#x27;s late 1920s/early 1930s biomorphs and the early work of the Surrealists.

===Popes===
Bacon&#x27;s series of Popes, largely quoting Velázquez&#x27;s famous &quot;Portrait of Innocent X&quot; (1650, Galeria Doria Pamphili, Rome), are striking images which further develop motifs already found in his earlier works, like the &quot;Study for Three Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion&quot;, such as the screaming open mouth. The figures of the popes, pictorially isolated by partly curved parallel lines indicating psychological forces and symbolising inner energy like the strength of feeling, are alienated from their original representation and, stripped of their representation of power to allegories of suffering humanity.

===Reclining figures===
Many of Bacon&#x27;s paintings are &quot;inhabited&quot; by reclining figures. Single, or, as in triptychs, repeated with variations, they can be commented by symbolic indexes (like circular arrows as signs for rotation), turning painted images into blueprints for moving images of the type of contemporary GIFs. The composition of especially the nude figures is influenced by the sculptural work of Michelangelo. The multi-phasing of his rendition of the figures, which often is also applied to the sitters in the portraits, is also a reference to Eadweard Muybridge&#x27;s chronophotography.

===The screaming mouth===
The inspiration for the recurring motif of screaming mouths in many Bacons of the late 1940s and early 1950s was drawn from a number of sources, including medical textbooks. Kathleen Clark&#x27;s 1939 book of X-Ray photographs was a major source. He also used the works of Matthias Grünewald and photographic stills of the nurse in the Odessa Steps scene in Eisenstein&#x27;s 1925 silent film &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;. Bacon saw the film in 1935 and viewed it frequently thereafter. He kept in his studio a photographic still of the scene, showing a close-up of the nurse&#x27;s head screaming in panic and terror and with broken pince-nez spectacles hanging from her blood-stained face. He referred to the image throughout his career, using it as a source of inspiration.

Bacon described the screaming mouth as a catalyst for his work and incorporated its shape when painting the chimera. His use of the motif can be seen in one of his first surviving works, &quot;Abstraction from the Human Form&quot;. By the early 1950s it became an obsessive concern, to the point, according to art critic and Bacon biographer Michael Peppiatt, &quot;it would be no exaggeration to say that, if one could really explain the origins and implications of this scream, one would be far closer to understanding the whole art of Francis Bacon.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Auction value===
The Popes and large triptychs, in their time, commanded the highest prices at auction. By 1989 Bacon was the most expensive living artist after one of his triptychs sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for over US$6 million. In 2007, actress Sophia Loren consigned &quot;Study for Portrait II&quot; (1956) from the estate of her late husband Carlo Ponti at Christie&#x27;s. It was auctioned for the then record price of £14.2 million ($27.5 million).

In 2008, the &quot;Triptych, 1976&quot; sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for €55.465 million ($86.28 million), then a record for a work by Bacon and the highest price paid for a postwar work of art at auction at the time. In 2013, &quot;Three Studies of Lucian Freud&quot; sold at Christie&#x27;s New York for $142.4 million, surpassing both &quot;Triptych&quot; and &quot;1976&quot; in auctioned value, the record for the highest auction price of a work of art at that time, surpassing the fourth version of Edvard Munch&#x27;s &quot;Scream&quot;. Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Salvator Mundi&quot;&quot; later sold for a higher price.

===Estate assignment===
In 1999, England&#x27;s High Court ruled that Marlborough Fine Art, Bacon&#x27;s former gallery, had to be replaced by a new, independent representative for the administration of the estate. The estate then engaged as representation the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in New York and Faggionato Fine Arts in Europe. That same year, the estate sued Marlborough UK and Marlborough International, Vaduz, charging them with wrongfully exploiting Bacon in a relationship that was &quot;manifestly disadvantageous&quot; to him until his death in 1992, and to his estate. The suit alleged Marlborough in London grossly underpaid Bacon for his works and resold them through its Liechtenstein branch at much higher prices, contending that Marlborough never supplied a complete accounting of Bacon&#x27;s works, and failed to account for up to 33 of his paintings. The litigation was settled out of court in early 2002, following Edwards&#x27; diagnosis of lung cancer, with both sides paying their own costs. During the legal process, an undisclosed number of Bacon&#x27;s paintings were recovered from Marlborough, and &quot;vast quantities of correspondence and documents relating to Bacon&#x27;s life were handed over by the gallery&quot;. In 2003, the estate was handed to a four-person trust based in Jersey.

===Studio relocation===

In August 1998, Bacon&#x27;s sole heir John Edwards and the artist Brian Clarke, sole executor of Bacon&#x27;s estate, donated the contents of Bacon&#x27;s studio to the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin. The studio at 7 Reece Mews had remained largely untouched since Bacon&#x27;s death in 1992. A team of archaeologists, art historians, conservators and curators oversaw the relocation to Dublin. The locations of over 7,000 items were mapped, survey and elevation drawings made, the items packed and catalogued, and the studio was rebuilt, including the original doors, floor, walls and ceiling.

In 2001 the relocated studio was opened to the public, with a fully comprehensive database. Every item in the studio has a database entry. Each entry consists of an image and a factual account of an object. The database has entries on approximately 570 books and catalogues, 1,500 photographs, 100 slashed canvases, 1,300 leaves torn from books, 2,000 artist&#x27;s materials and 70 drawings. Other categories include Bacon&#x27;s correspondence, magazines, newspapers and vinyl records.

===&quot;Catalogue raisonné&quot;===
The first, but even then incomplete &quot;catalogue raisonné&quot; was compiled in 1964 by the Tate gallery curator Ronald Alley, . In 2016, a five-volume &quot;Francis Bacon: Catalogue Raisonné&quot;, documenting 584 paintings, was compiled and published by Martin Harrison and others.

<text>The Via della Vittoria was a military road between Bardia in Italian Libya and Sidi Barrani in western Egypt.

== Characteristics ==

The &quot;Via della Vittoria&quot; (Victory Road), was built by Italian engineers during World War II, between September and December 1940. The road went from Sidi Barrani, Egypt, to the border of Italian Libya and connected to the Via Balbia. It was wide and asphalted.

It was officially called &quot;Via della Vittoria nell&#x27;Africa Settentrionale Italiana&quot; in order to distinguish it from another &quot;Via della Vittoria&quot; built in 1939 in Ethiopia/Africa Orientale Italiana.

== History ==

The Italian Army invaded Egypt in summer 1940 and penetrated until Sidi Barrani. The need of communication in order to supply the Army forced the construction of this new road.

In fall 1940 Italian Marshal Rodolfo Graziani ordered his Army in western Egypt to complete this new coastal road extending the Via Balbia inside Egypt, even in order to create an infrastructure for a planned Italian invasion of the Nile Delta in January/February 1941.

In December 1940 the new road was used by the British forces during Operation Compass. In the next two years the road was damaged by the continuous changes in the front between Axis forces under Erwin Rommel and the Allies.

<text>The New York World-Telegram, later known as the New York World-Telegram and The Sun, was a New York City newspaper from 1931 to 1966.

==History==
Founded by James Gordon Bennett Sr. as &quot;The Evening Telegram&quot; in 1867, the newspaper began as the evening edition of &quot;The New York Herald&quot;, which itself published its first issue in 1835. Following Bennett&#x27;s death, newspaper and magazine owner Frank A. Munsey purchased &quot;The Telegram&quot; in June 1920. Munsey&#x27;s associate Thomas W. Dewart, the late publisher and president of the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, owned the paper for two years after Munsey died in 1925 before selling it to the E. W. Scripps Company for an undisclosed sum in 1927. At the time of the sale, the paper was known as &quot;The New York Telegram&quot;, and it had a circulation of 200,000.

The newspaper became the &quot;World-Telegram&quot; in 1931, following the sale of the &quot;New York World&quot; by the heirs of Joseph Pulitzer to Scripps Howard. More than 2,000 employees of the morning, evening and Sunday editions of the &quot;World&quot; lost their jobs in the merger, although some star writers, including Heywood Broun and Westbrook Pegler, were kept on the new paper.

The &quot;World-Telegram&quot; enjoyed a reputation as a liberal paper for some years after the merger, based on memories of the Pulitzer-owned &quot;World&quot;. However, under Scripps Howard the paper moved steadily to the right, eventually becoming a conservative bastion described by the press critic A.J. Liebling as &quot;Republican, anti-labor, and suspicious of anything European.&quot; He also called the paper &quot;the organ of New York&#x27;s displaced persons (displaced from the interior of North America)&quot;.

In 1940, the paper carried a series of articles entitled &quot;The Rape of China,&quot; which used Walter Judd&#x27;s experiences with Japanese soldiers as the basis of support for a campaign to boycott Japanese goods. Publisher Roy Howard, an expert of sorts after travelling to Manchuria and Japan in the early 1930s, gave extensive coverage of Japanese atrocities in China. The paper&#x27;s headline of December 8, 1941, read &quot;1500 Dead in Hawaii&quot; in its coverage of Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor.

===&quot;New York World-Telegram and The Sun&quot;===
In 1950, the paper was renamed the &quot;New York World-Telegram and The Sun&quot; after the Dewart family sold Scripps the remnants of another afternoon paper, the &quot;New York Sun&quot;. Liebling once described &quot;The Sun&quot; on the combined publication&#x27;s nameplate as resembling the tail feathers of a canary on the chin of a cat.

Beginning in July 1956, the paper became a center of attention when its reporters Gene Gleason and Fred J. Cook launched an investigative series on New York City Parks Commissioner Robert Moses. Gleason and Cook focused on possible corruption in how Moses was implementing &quot;Title I: Slum Clearance &amp; Community Development &amp; Redevelopment&quot; of the U.S. Housing Act of 1949. The information they revealed in the &quot;World-Telegram and Sun&quot; was a vital resource for Robert Caro&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Moses entitled &quot;The Power Broker&quot; (1974).

===&quot;New York World Journal Tribune&quot;===
Early in 1966, a proposal to create New York&#x27;s first joint operating agreement (JOA) led to the merger of the &quot;World-Telegram and The Sun&quot; with Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Journal American&quot;. The intention was to produce a joint afternoon edition, with a separate morning paper to be produced by the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;. The last edition of the &quot;World-Telegram and The Sun&quot; was published on April 23, 1966. But when strikes prevented the JOA from taking effect, the papers instead united in August 1966 to become the short-lived &quot;New York World Journal Tribune&quot;, which lasted only until May 5, 1967. Its closure left New York City with three daily newspapers: &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;New York Post&quot;, and &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.

The archives of the paper are not available online, but they can be accessed at the Library of Congress, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and at several research facilities in the state of New York.

<text>Brigadier Eric Edward &quot;Chink&quot; Dorman-Smith (24 July 1895 – 11 May 1969), who later changed his name to Eric Edward Dorman O&#x27;Gowan, was an Irish officer whose career in the British Army began in the First World War and closed at the end of the Second World War. In the 1950s, Dorman-Smith (then Dorman O’Gowan) became an officer in the Irish Republican Army (IRA).

In the 1920s, during the interwar period, he was one of the military thinkers in various countries, like Heinz Guderian in Germany and Charles de Gaulle in France, who realised that technology and motorisation were changing the way that wars and battles were fought. Influenced by J. F. C. Fuller, Archibald Wavell, B. H. Liddell Hart, and many others, Dorman-Smith tried to change the culture of the British Army and held a number of teaching and training roles in various parts of the British Empire. Although he made several contributions in advisory roles during the campaigns in the Western Desert from 1940 to 1941, it was not until May 1942 that he went on active service again. His service in the Second World War is shrouded in controversy and ended when he was fired from his command in August 1944.

==Early life==
Dorman-Smith was born to a mixed-religion couple in Bellamont Forest, Cootehill, County Cavan, Ireland. He was received into the Catholic Church four days after his birth as a result of his Catholic mother&#x27;s pleading. His younger brothers, Victor and Reggie, were baptised Protestant (though all three boys are listed as Catholic in the 1901 Census). His best friend as a child in Cootehill was John Charles McQuaid, the local doctor&#x27;s son, who was later appointed Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin.

At the age of 12, he was sent to St Anthony&#x27;s, a Catholic school in Eastbourne, Sussex. His Cavan accent and buck teeth made him stand out and, in the effort to modify his accent, he developed a stutter. While there, his parents moved to Maidenhead, Berkshire in England and, after a year, he was moved to Lambrook, which was a school attended by his younger brothers, whereupon his stutter vanished. In 1910, he went to Uppingham School, Rutland, where he befriended Brian Horrocks, a future general. During his school days he showed that he had strong principles: in particular there were episodes of casual anti-semitism towards friends of his which he reportedly took steps to address.

Dorman-Smith&#x27;s father insisted he take the entrance exam for the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in December 1912 and he scored 6969/12600, being placed 69th in the order of merit, thus obtaining one of the 172 available places. Horrocks also succeeded, ranked 171. After two terms, he passed out in exemplary fashion, leaving Horrocks to complete a third term, achieving 515/600 in military history and 2031/2800 in general military subjects. His overall score was 7976/10,500, placing him 10th. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the 1st Battalion of the Northumberland Fusiliers (later the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) on 25 February 1914, just six months before the outbreak of the First World War. Dorman-Smith gained his nickname &quot;Chink&quot; on his first night in the officers&#x27; mess when his fellow subaltern, Richard Vachell, noted his resemblance to the chinkara antelope mascot that the regiment had had to leave behind when they moved back to England from India.

==First World War==
&quot;Chink&quot;, along with the rest of his battalion, then serving as part of the 9th Brigade of the 3rd Division, was sent to France on 13 August 1914, nine days after Britain entered the First World War. He was among the first troops of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to arrive. The battalion, and Dorman-Smith himself, were involved in the Battle of Mons, where he was wounded in the retreat. Later that year he was involved in the battles of Messines, Armentières and Ypres and, after being promoted on 15 November to the temporary rank of lieutenant, received another wound on 9 December. He was promoted to substantive lieutenant on 2 January 1915.

In May 1915 the battalion was involved in fighting at Railway Wood, near Ypres, during the Second Battle of Ypres. Although he had received a shrapnel wound and four lesser injuries from rifle bullets, he organised, under heavy fire, a withdrawal of the survivors of his battalion, for which he was awarded one of the first batch of the Military Cross (MC). Promoted to temporary captain on 26 June 1915, he was mentioned in dispatches on 1 January 1916 and his rank of captain was made permanent on 26 August 1916. After a difficult period of convalescence, he was sent to teach trench warfare to new recruits and in January 1917 he was posted to the Northern School of Instruction. He returned to active service in July 1917 and was temporarily promoted to the acting rank of major on 16 October; he was subsequently made second-in-command (2IC) of the 10th (Service) Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers, a Kitchener&#x27;s Army battalion, then serving on the Western Front as part of the 68th Brigade of the 23rd Division.

In November 1917, Dorman-Smith was posted as a captain to the Italian Piave Front on attachment to the 68th Brigade School, and from 4 April until 6 July 1918 he served as adjutant to the 12th (Service) Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, another Kitchener&#x27;s Army unit, serving in the same 68th Brigade of the 23rd Division. He was mentioned in dispatches a second time on 30 May 1918 and was again promoted to the temporary rank of major on 7 July 1918. He served as 2IC to the battalion and finished the war in Genoa, recovering from an attack of gastroenteritis, with a bar added to his MC. Upon his discharge from hospital he was appointed Commandant of the British Troops and sent to Milan. In Milan on 3 November 1918, he met Ernest Hemingway, who had been wounded at the Italian front and decorated with the Italian Silver Medal of Bravery while serving with the Red Cross. He was posted to the Military Landing Staff at Taranto before returning to England as adjutant to the Northumberland Fusiliers. He was mentioned in dispatches a third time on 9 January 1919.

In June 1921, the regiment was posted to his native Ireland as part of the effort to repress the rebellion. His battalion was part of the Curragh 5th Division and from its headquarters in Carlow, its role was to patrol the county of Kilkenny. He discovered that his childhood nurse had married the local IRA brigadier and on one occasion, helped her bury a cache of hand grenades on the grounds of Bellamont Forest prior to a raid by the Black and Tans but otherwise remained politically neutral.

==Between the wars==
His period of duty in Ireland ended in February 1922 and he moved to the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), still as adjutant of his regiment. He witnessed the breakdown of transport and communications after the French sent troops into the Ruhr basin in January 1923 to enforce war reparations.

In 1924, he left his regiment to become an instructor at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he became acquainted with Richard O&#x27;Connor; the duo went on a walking tour of the Austro-Italian Alps at the end of 1924. In 1927, Dorman-Smith sat the entrance examination for the Staff College, Camberley. In the Strategy paper the examiner, J. F. C. Fuller, awarded him 1,000 marks out of a possible 1,000. The advantage of gaining the p.s.c. (passed Staff College) was that the two-year course provided a network of 180 highly trained officers for help afterwards. By arriving with such a splash, it is probable that Dorman-Smith became regarded with suspicion by people who would one day be his peers and superior officers. Many of Dorman-Smith&#x27;s fellow students there included the future general officers of the Second World War, including Philip Christison, Evelyn Barker, Oliver Leese, Eric Hayes, John Hawkesworth, Ronald Penney, John Whiteley, Robert Bridgeman, 2nd Viscount Bridgeman, Eric Nares, Charles Norman, Stanley Kirby, Wilfrid Lloyd, Reginald Savory and Clement West.
On 28 December 1928 he passed out Grade A in the top four and publicly burned his lecture notes, including those from Bernard Montgomery, one of the instructors. They had already clashed on numerous occasions and &quot;Chink&quot; had also failed to attend his class on &quot;The Registering of Personality&quot;, which he regarded as unnecessary for the formulation of successful tactics. He then became the first infantryman to hold the post of instructor of tactics at Chatham, the Royal Engineers&#x27; equivalent of the Staff College. In 1929 he was commissioned to write a textbook on military tactics, which became an official army handbook, &quot;Infantry Section Leaders&#x27; Training&quot;, within two years.

Promoted to the brevet rank of major on 1 January 1931, in July he was appointed brigade major to the 6th Experimental Brigade at Blackdown, under Archibald Wavell, who, along with Richard O&#x27;Connor and Claude Auchinleck, were the most significant influences on his career and his most prominent supporters. Wavell aimed to increase the mobility of the army and led exercises to this aim, in which Dorman-Smith assisted. He encouraged Dorman-Smith to ignore the standard manuals and devise new tactical approaches. Promoted to substantive major on 23 November 1933, in 1934, on the recommendation of O&#x27;Connor, he was appointed to the War Office at the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel, which he was promoted to on 1 July 1934. He allied himself with Liddell Hart in a crusade against the use of horses in the army. He devised an estimate of British casualties over the first year of a big war into three categories; 25 percent caused by enemy action, 25 percent by indifferent generalship and accidents of war, 50 percent by the Treasury.

It was at that time Dorman-Smith began to clash with Alan Brooke, whom he viewed as the epitome of a traditional Royal Horse Artillery officer, with little interest in the requirements of modern mechanised warfare. On a return to the Staff College, Camberley in 1936, he had to deliver lectures on tactics which he considered already outdated. He spent his leisure time devising with Philip Christison, one of his fellow students at the Staff College almost a decade before and then a fellow instructor, more up-to-date theories of supply, staff duties and tactical handling, only to be reprimanded by Major-General Lord Gort, the Commandant of the Staff College.

After sixteen months, rather than the customary three years, Dorman-Smith was promoted to substantive lieutenant colonel on 26 April 1937 and was appointed Commanding Officer (CO) of the 1st Battalion of his regiment, now retitled the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, then serving in Egypt. His farewell speech to the Staff College on the success of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Abyssinian campaign was not well received, probably because of its emphasis on the more mechanised approach of the Italian Army compared with the British Army. In Egypt, Dorman-Smith clashed with his new command about his disregard for polo training and he was far from impressed by their military ability. He tried, without success, to break down barriers between British and Egyptian companies, probably another campaign that would be held against this unconventional officer.

Late in 1937, he went to Mersa Matruh to re-design the fortifications. His assessment of the terrain was to colour his estimate of Neil Ritchie&#x27;s generalship when facing Erwin Rommel&#x27;s assault in mid-1942, and he seems to have realised that El Alamein was going to be the decisive battleground in Egypt. In March 1938, he was offered the post of Director of Military Training for India, a major-general&#x27;s appointment, and he left Egypt in May. He was promoted to brevet colonel and to the temporary rank of brigadier on 10 May and his permanent rank was advanced to colonel on 1 July (with seniority backdated to 10 May 1937). The later Regimental History thanks Dorman-Smith for his modernising efforts in helping the battalion to survive the desert campaign, although it appears that they were glad to see the back of him.

In India, he soon got to know the Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s loyal aide, &quot;Bunny&quot; Careless, who developed an antipathy that might have re-surfaced when Dorman-Smith was his brigade commander in Italy in 1944. The occupant of the office next door to Dorman-Smith was the Deputy Chief, General Staff, Claude Auchinleck. They became close companions and went on hill-walks before breakfast each day. They developed a plan to transform the Indian Army but the outbreak of the Second World War put paid to it. In January 1940, Auchinleck was appointed to command IV Corps in England. In August of that year, Wavell asked Dorman-Smith to take over command of the Staff College, Haifa in Palestine, taking over the position from Brigadier Alexander Galloway.

==Second World War==
===The Middle East and North Africa===
In October 1940, over a year after the outbreak of the Second World War, Wavell, the C-in-C of Middle East Command, asked Dorman-Smith to look into the feasibility of taking the offensive against the Italian forces who had invaded Egypt from Libya. On delivery of his report, he was sent as an adviser to Major-General Richard O&#x27;Connor and the Western Desert Force (WDF).

Dorman-Smith is credited by historian Correlli Barnett with planning Operation Compass and with the discovery of a gap in the Italian lines south of Sidi Barrani. He was then sent back to Haifa while the WDF carried out his daring plan with great success. In January 1941, Wavell again asked him to report to O&#x27;Connor and assess the progress of the campaign in order to distil what could be learned from its success. He stayed with the army until, in early February, the Italian 10th Army surrendered near Benghazi. O&#x27;Connor sent him back to Cairo to ask Wavell&#x27;s permission to advance on Tripoli but in the meantime Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, had instructed Wavell to send troops to the aid of Greece, ending Operation Compass. &quot;Chink&quot; returned to Haifa on 13 February 1941.

In April 1941, he was temporarily appointed Brigadier General Staff (BGS) and watched from a distance while Erwin Rommel won back all the territory that O&#x27;Connor had gained and the Allied forces were pushed out of the Balkans and Greece. He conveyed several messages to Major-General Bernard Freyberg who was preparing the defence of Crete. His temporary appointment ended at the end of May and he again returned to the Staff College, Haifa. When the news arrived that Wavell was going to be replaced by Auchinleck as C-in-C in the Middle East in July, Dorman-Smith probably thought that he stood a chance of getting a permanent role closer to the action but no job offer was made. By December, he had decided to resign from the army. Despite this, Dorman-Smith accepted an offer from Auchinleck, to be appointed British Army liaison officer for Persia and Iraq – even though he realised it was a largely meaningless sinecure. In February 1942, Auchinleck sent him to assess the condition of the Eighth Army, commanded by Lieutenant-General Neil Ritchie. Dorman-Smith&#x27;s conclusion, following wide consultations, was that Ritchie was an excellent staff officer, but unsuited to his post and should be replaced. Auchinleck took no action upon this. After a few more unproductive months – during which time Dorman-Smith offered his resignation, which was rejected by Auchinleck – he worked on a proposal for a Higher Command School with Field Marshal Jan Smuts. He was offered on 8 May a choice of major-general positions, an unspecified role under Wavell in India or Deputy Chief of the General Staff in Cairo. &quot;Chink&quot; accepted the latter and was promoted to acting major-general on 16 June.

Until 6 August 1942, when he was sacked, Dorman-Smith, a full colonel but holding the acting rank of major-general, served as chief of staff to Auchinleck, the C-in-C Middle East. Auchinleck took over command of the Eighth Army on 25 June after the failure of Ritchie to provide effective resistance to the Axis forces and took Dorman-Smith along to act as his staff officer. Dorman-Smith&#x27;s novel use of intelligence derived from Ultra decrypts led them to formulate tactics based on systematic attacks on the weak points of the German forces, notably the Italian formations, which proved successful in slowing down and finally disrupting the German advance. The stream of bad news from this war zone in the weeks prior to Auchinleck&#x27;s assumption of personal command, had led to a crisis of confidence in Whitehall. Churchill and Alan Brooke, now the Chief of the General Staff, the professional head of the British Army, visited Cairo in August 1942 to take stock of the situation. They were not impressed by Auchinleck&#x27;s poor grasp of public relations work and decided that a change of command was required.

The key moment of the entire desert war saw Dorman-Smith and Auchinleck finally stop the Axis assault in a few days of desperate fighting in the First Battle of El Alamein in and around Ruweisat Ridge in early July, with their direct and centralized control of the ragged Eighth Army. General Montgomery used the Auchinleck and Dorman-Smith concepts to conduct and win the defensive battle at the Battle of Alam el Halfa a few weeks later.

Brooke had spoken to his former protégé Ritchie and various other senior officers whom he knew from his days with the horse artillery and came to the conclusion that Dorman-Smith was a poor advisor to Auchinleck,

Major St J. Oswald, a G2 Staff Officer at Eighth Army HQ who eventually rose to the rank of major-general, said of Dorman-Smith, &quot;He really was as near being a lunatic as you can get&quot;. In a August 1942 diary entry, Ian Jacob wrote- &#x27;Everyone regards Dornan-Smith as a menace of the first order&#x27;. For his services in the Middle East Dorman-Smith was twice mentioned in dispatches, on 30 December 1941, and on 24 June 1943.

===Service in Britain and Italy===
Dorman-Smith never held any important military positions after this date. He reverted to the rank of brigadier on 11 September 1942 and was soon appointed to command the 160th Infantry Brigade. The brigade formed part of the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division, a first line Territorial Army (TA) formation, commanded by Major-General Robert Ross. The division was serving in Kent, preparing and training for the invasion of Normandy. Another unfortunate meeting took place on 20 November, when Churchill paid a visit to the 53rd Division and invited &quot;Chink&quot; to the official lunch party. The latter found himself in an argument with the Prime Minister and gave him a patronising lecture on military tactics. Six months later, in May 1943, Exercise Spartan was held. While his brigade performed well, there was no official recognition. To compound his misfortune, on 11 November 1943, Dorman-Smith learned that the new commander of XII Corps (under whose control the 53rd Division was then serving) was Lieutenant-General Neil Ritchie, who he had been critical of in North Africa. Believing that it would be too embarrassing to serve directly under Ritchie, Dorman-Smith wrote to Major-General Ross with the request that he be moved to a new post. As a result, on 21 November he was ordered to vacate his command and stay on leave of absence until further notice, although Ross made it clear to Dorman-Smith that this was in no way a reflection on his efficiency.

Remaining virtually unemployed for the next few months, in late April 1944, Dorman-Smith learned that he was to be given command of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, part of the 1st Infantry Division then fighting on the Italian Front in the Anzio beachhead. By now, however, his reputation was such that all the senior British commanders in Italy wished to turn him down, but were overruled by Brooke who made it clear to Dorman-Smith that this was his &quot;sink or swim&quot; moment. However, Major General Ronald Penney, his new divisional commander, who had been a fellow student at the Staff College in the late 1920s, was not at all happy with his new brigade commander, greeting him with the words &quot;I didn&#x27;t want you before and I don&#x27;t want you now&quot;. There was some history behind this. At the Staff College the two men had clashed, Dorman-Smith frequently deriding him while Penney then believed that &quot;Chink&quot; would be a staff officer and one who should not command troops in battle and refused to change his opinion. Furthermore, Dorman-Smith&#x27;s predecessor, Brigadier J. G. James, had been hugely popular in his brigade, causing some resentment among the three battalion commanders.

When Dorman-Smith arrived in the Anzio beachhead, the fighting was reminiscent of the fighting on the Western Front almost 30 years before, with static warfare replacing the mobility that had existed in the Western Desert. Soon after his arrival, the Allied forces launched a breakout attempt. Dorman-Smith&#x27;s brigade spearheaded the 1st Division&#x27;s advance up the western flank of Italy, along the way becoming engaged in numerous small-scale fights while trying to reach the River Tiber. During most of this period, Penney was away and was eventually replaced in late July by Major General Charles Loewen, a stranger to &quot;Chink&quot; but one who managed to earn his respect. Despite this, Dorman-Smith himself was relieved of command. His relief was the result of an allegation that his battalion commanders had complained about his leadership. Penney had reported this to the Eighth Army, who in turn declared Dorman-Smith &quot;unfit for brigade command&quot;. The circumstances behind his demotion are controversial. He was in command of three battalions. James Hackett wrote in 1984 that Dorman-Smith was summoned by the divisional commander to give his opinion of his superior officer, a procedure that annoyed and offended him. Neither of the other two officers left accounts of the episode, however. The only evidence rests on the report of the divisional commander, which is tainted by inaccuracies in that at least one of the three officers did not lay a complaint. Lavinia Greacen&#x27;s biography of Dorman-Smith includes a summary of the differences between the three accounts of this episode made by Penney on various occasions. Nevertheless, he was relieved on 13 August and returned to the United Kingdom, retiring from the army, after almost 30 years&#x27; service, on 14 December, and was granted the honorary rank of brigadier.

Of Dorman-Smith Richard Mead states the following:

==Life in Ireland==
Four years after he was forcibly retired from the British Army, he changed his name from Dorman-Smith to Dorman O&#x27;Gowan, having long been aware that his father was descended from the O&#x27;Gowans, who had once been a ruling family in Ulster. In 1945 he had contested the safe Tory seat of Wirral, Cheshire for the Liberal Party. He won 14,302 votes and retained his deposit, coming third, with Selwyn Lloyd easily retaining the seat for the Conservatives with 51% of the votes of those who cast ballots. &quot;Chink&quot; retired to Dublin. Eve joined him in November 1945, gave birth to Christopher on 10 May 1946 and to Rionagh in December 1947. He began to study in the library at University College, Dublin, after his application to read for a degree was rejected.

Throughout his military career, Dorman-Smith had retained contacts with Ireland. He did not inherit Bellamont Forest until his father died in March 1948 and his parents had long ceased to reside there, leading to the estate becoming run-down by the time he took it over but he had paid regular visits during the 20s and 30s. The estate was from the border and at times it became a place of interest to the Republicans. During one of Dorman-Smith&#x27;s stays, Éamon de Valera who seems to have been interested in learning of &quot;Chink&#x27;s&quot; views on the state of the Irish army, made an informal and unannounced visit. During his time at the Staff College, Camberley in 1927 to 1928, two Irish Army officers paid an official visit – after rebukes from the United Kingdom for visiting Fort Leavenworth in the United States - and Bernard Montgomery, the senior lecturer, ordered a boycott so the welcoming party consisted only of the Commandant and Dorman-Smith.

In 1950, he joined Clann na Poblachta, a new party led by Seán MacBride, who had been an Irish Republican Army officer in Carlow during Dorman O&#x27;Gowan&#x27;s posting there. His ties and allegiance to the UK were fading fast. In May 1951 he stood for election to the Dáil as an independent candidate in Cavan, since Clann were already supporting another candidate. He polled just 495 votes – the lowest of the eight candidates. He later became an advisor to the IRA Executive during the 1950s Border Campaign.

His first contact with the IRA seems to have been in the aftermath of their raid on the Gough Barracks in Armagh on 12 June 1954. Chief of Staff Tony Magan visited him for discussions at Bellamont Forest. In July 1954, he spoke at a reunification rally in Manchester, making it clear that he was distancing himself from the policies of the UK. He grew frustrated at not being made part of the decision-making process of the IRA and, when a raid on Omagh went wrong, he began to realise that the IRA did not meet his ideals of efficiency.

During 1955–56, his estate was used as a training-ground by the IRA on two weekends a year, but he was excluded from playing a role despite his eagerness to assist. He does not appear to have kept these contacts secret. Daphne du Maurier, wife of his former Sandhurst adjutant Frederick &quot;Boy&quot; Browning, wrote a story about this side of his life, &quot;A Border-Line Case&quot;.

The British establishment appears to have dismissed him as a harmless crank. On 15 December 1956, after the failure of Operation Harvest and the introduction of the Special Powers Act, Seán Cronin visited to convey the message that his usefulness to the IRA was over.

==Characteristics and reputation==
Dorman-Smith was an unorthodox commander and has attracted contrasting opinions. To some, such as B. H. Liddell Hart, he was &quot;the outstanding soldier of his generation&quot;. To others, such as Field Marshals Michael Carver and Alanbrooke, he was a &quot;sinister influence&quot; and the major cause of Auchinleck&#x27;s dismissal. Montgomery called him &quot;a menace&quot; but despite his antipathy, the Battle of Alam el Halfa was fought on a plan very close to that conceived by Dorman-Smith for Auchinleck. Montgomery made skilful use of the defensive system which he had been instrumental in planning and laying out. Carver, however, points out that Montgomery did make a decisive alteration to this plan by bringing up troops that were to have been held in reserve in the Nile Delta to form a continuous line of defence. The effect of this was to reduce the need for mobility for which the British Army in terms of organisation, training and communications was not highly skilled − despite the efforts of people such as Dorman-Smith to reform it.

The key characteristic of Dorman-Smith&#x27;s career is that he was not politically astute and made a number of enemies in the 1920s and 1930s who worked against him, including Penney, Montgomery and most significantly in view of his fall from grace, Brooke, &quot;I had been worried for some time by Auchinleck&#x27;s handling of armoured formations, mainly due to his listening to the advice of &#x27;Chink&#x27; Dorman-Smith.&quot; Montgomery finally initiated battle at El Alamein at a date one month later than had previously been envisaged in the Auchinleck-Dorman-Smith plan, which was mainly responsible for their dismissals.

He sued Churchill, forcing him to amend &quot;The Hinge of Fate&quot;, part of his history of the Second World War, so that an implied slur on the fighting mettle of Auchinleck was removed. Less acrimoniously, Montgomery was forced to tone down his criticisms of his predecessors in the Eighth Army, when he published his memoirs in August 1958. When Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander brought out his memoirs in 1961, &quot;Chink&quot; was preparing his case but his legal team advised him to withdraw.

==Cultural contacts==
Dorman-Smith’s next meeting with Hemingway after the latter&#x27;s departure from Genoa in 1919, was in Paris in 1922, where &quot;Chink&quot; was spending his vacation with his parents. Hemingway was living there with his wife Hadley and working as a freelance journalist. He invited Dorman-Smith to accompany them to Montreux. They spent their days fishing and climbing mountains and Hemingway alluded to this holiday in &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot;. They decided to show Hadley around Milan and crossed the St Bernard Pass on foot – an adventure commemorated by Hemingway in &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;.

They met up over Christmas 1922, again in Montreux and spent the visit luging and skiing. In early 1923, Hemingway visited Dorman-Smith in Cologne on behalf of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; newspaper. During the following summer, he visited them in Paris where Hemingway introduced him to the intelligentsia, including John Dos Passos, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, Ford Madox Ford and Ezra Pound. Hemingway&#x27;s first book, &quot;in our time&quot;, was dedicated to Dorman-Smith and includes some anecdotes from &quot;Chink&#x27;s&quot; memories of the Mons campaign. In March 1924, he paid another visit to Paris and became godfather to Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s eldest son John.

That summer, in company with Dos Passos, Donald Ogden Stewart and Robert McAlmon, they visited the San Fermin festival in Pamplona in July and participated in the bull-running. Proof of the high esteem in which Hemingway held Dorman-Smith is contained in his 1924 poem, &quot;To Chink Whose Trade is Soldiering&quot;. However, after their next meeting in April 1926, when Dorman-Smith was accompanying an army rugby team to Paris, they gradually drifted apart because of the stresses of Dorman-Smith&#x27;s military career and the changes in Hemingway&#x27;s life. They did not meet again until Dorman-Smith was touring the US in April 1950.

==Personal life==
Dorman-Smith did not marry young and conducted a series of affairs until on 29 December 1927, he married Estelle Irene ()- the first wife of Thomas Reedham Berney; their union was childless. During his period in Haifa in 1940, he met Eve Nott (first wife of Brigadier Donald Harley Nott 1908–1996, who was captured at Tobruk), with whom he began an affair. They wed on 17 May 1949 at Westminster Register Office. He had a son and a daughter, Christopher and Rionagh and seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Dorman-Smith&#x27;s youngest brother, Reginald, was Governor of Burma at the time of the Japanese invasion during the Second World War. His other brother Victor, was a Royal Navy Captain.

==Death==
Dorman-Smith died from stomach cancer on 11 May 1969 at Lisdarne hospital, Cavan, at the age of 73.

<text>The Infantry Tank Mark II, better known as the Matilda, is a British infantry tank of the Second World War.

The design began as the A12 specification in 1936, as a gun-armed counterpart to the first British infantry tank, the machine gun armed, two-man A11 Infantry Tank Mark I. The Mark I was also known as Matilda, and the larger A12 was initially known as the Matilda II or Matilda senior. The Mark I was abandoned in 1940, and from then on the A12 was almost always known simply as &quot;the Matilda&quot;.

With its heavy armour, the Matilda II was an excellent infantry support tank but with somewhat limited speed and armament. It was the only British tank to serve from the start of the war to its end, although it is particularly associated with the North Africa Campaign. Only two were available for service by the outbreak of World War II in 1939. It was replaced in front-line service by the lighter and less costly Infantry Tank Mk III Valentine beginning in late 1941.

==Development history==
The split between the infantry tank and cruisers had its origins in the First World War division between the first British heavy tanks and the faster Whippet Medium Mark A and its successors the Medium Mark B and Medium Mark C. During the interbellum, British tank experiments generally followed these basic classifications, which were made part of the overall doctrine with the work of Major-General Percy Hobart and the influence of Captain B.H. Liddell Hart.

In 1934, Hobart, the then &quot;Inspector, Royal Tank Corps&quot;, postulated in a paper two alternatives for a tank to support the infantry. One was a very small, heavily armoured, machine gun-armed model that would be fielded in large numbers to overwhelm the enemy defences. The other was a larger vehicle with a cannon as well as machine guns and heavier armour proof against enemy field artillery. Vickers designed a tank to a General Staff specification based on the first option as the A11 Matilda. Within the limitations of military finances, the Master-General of the Ordnance, Hugh Elles, went for the smaller machine gun tank and the larger cannon-armed version did not proceed. This requirement was passed to Vickers-Armstrongs which had a prototype (A11E1) but with armour proof against current anti-tanks guns ready by September 1936.

The first suggestion for a larger Infantry Tank was made in 1936, with specification A12. The design was produced by the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, and Vulcan Foundry was selected as the manufacturer. A12 used a number of design elements of the A7, a medium tank that was built in limited numbers in the early 1930s whose mechanical layout was used for many following designs. With its greatly increased armour, a lack of power was seen as a problem. The solution was to use two AEC straight-six water-cooled diesel engines, used in London buses, providing up to 87 hp each. These were linked along a common shaft. Suspension was to use the &quot;Japanese Type&quot; bell crank suspension used on the A7.

Vulcan received a contract for two wooden mock-ups and two mild-steel prototypes in November 1936. The first mock-up was delivered in April 1937 and the A12E1 prototype in April 1938. The prototypes proved excellent in a test, resulting in only a few changes to improve the gearbox, suspension and cooling. When war was recognised as imminent, production of the Matilda II was ordered and that of the Matilda I curtailed. The first order was placed shortly after trials were completed, with 140 ordered from Vulcan in June 1938.

==Design==
The Matilda Senior weighed around , more than twice as much as its predecessor, and was armed with an Ordnance QF 2-pounder (40 mm) tank gun in a three-man turret. The turret traversed by hydraulic motor or by hand through 360 degrees; the gun could be elevated through an arc from −15 to +20 degrees. One of the most serious weaknesses of the Matilda II was the lack of a high-explosive round for its main gun. A high-explosive shell was designed for the 2-pounder but was rarely issued, as the shell explosive charge was so small. The main weapon against unarmoured targets was its machine gun.

The Matilda II had a conventional layout, with the driver&#x27;s compartment located at the front of the tank&#x27;s hull, the fighting compartment with the turret in the centre and the engine and transmission housed in the rear. The driver&#x27;s position was normally accessed by a single hatch in the roof of the hull, and protected by a rotating armoured cover which could be held locked in either fully open or closed positions; emergency egress was made possible by a large escape hatch under the driver&#x27;s seating position. The driver also had a direct vision viewing port with manually operated armoured shield and a single Mk IV periscope to use when buttoned up. 

Like many other British infantry tanks, it was heavily armoured. The front glacis was up to thick; the nose plates top and bottom were thinner but angled. The sides of the hull were and the rear armour, protecting the engine to sides and rear, was .

The cast, cylindrical three-man turret was seated on ball-bearing ring mount and its armour was all round. The turret was laid out such that the gunner and commander were seated in a laddered arrangement on the left side of the gun, and the loader on the right. The commander was given a rotating cupola with a two-piece hatch and a single panoramic Mk IV periscope installed in the forward-facing hatch door. The same device was also mounted in a fixed position in the turret roof, forward of the commander&#x27;s cupola, and giving the gunner some situational awareness and target finding capabilities. The loader used a single, rectangular hatch in the turret&#x27;s roof on the right side. The turret was equipped with a basket around which much of the ammunition stowage was contained. The turret had a power traverse system used under normal conditions, and a manually-operated mechanical emergency assist.

The turret roof, hull roof and engine deck were . The armour varied in strength from IT.80 to IT.100

The armour of the Matilda was the heaviest of its era. Contemporary German Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks had hull armour, while the T-34 had (angled at 60 degrees). Matilda&#x27;s side and rear armour was relatively heavy even at the end of the war when tanks like the M4 Sherman carried about 40 mm, and late models of the Panther carried 50 mm. The shape of the nose armour was based on Christie&#x27;s designs and came to a narrow point with storage lockers added on either side. The heavy armour of the Matilda&#x27;s cast turret became legendary; for a time in 1940–1941, the Matilda earned the nickname &quot;Queen of the Desert&quot;.

While the Matilda possessed a degree of protection that was unmatched in the North African theatre, the sheer weight of the armour on the vehicle contributed to a very low average speed of about on desert terrain and on roads. At the time, this was not thought to be a problem, since British infantry tank doctrine valued heavy armour and trench-crossing ability over speed and cross-country mobility (which was considered to be characteristic of cruiser tanks such as the Crusader). The slow speed of the Matilda was further exacerbated by a troublesome suspension and a comparatively weak power unit, which was created from two AEC 6-cylinder bus engines linked to a single shaft. This arrangement was complicated and time-consuming to maintain, as it required mechanics to work on each engine separately and subjected automotive components to uneven wear-and-tear. It did provide some mechanical redundancy, since failure in one engine would not prevent the Matilda from using the other. The combined power of the engines went through a six-speed Wilson epicyclic gearbox, operated by compressed air.

The tank&#x27;s suspension system was that which had been developed by Vickers for their Medium C prototype in the mid-1920s The tank was carried by five double wheels bogies on each side. Four of the bogies were on bellcranks in pairs, with a common horizontal coil spring. The fifth bogie at the rear was sprung against a hull bracket. Between the first bogie and the idler wheel, was a larger diameter vertically sprung &quot;jockey wheel&quot;. The first Matildas had return rollers; these were replaced in later models by track skids, which were far easier to manufacture and to service in the field.

The turret carried the main armament, with the machine gun to the right in a rotating internal mantlet. Traverse was by a hydraulic system. As the gun was balanced for ease of movement by the gunner, much of the breech end was behind the trunnions. Two smoke grenade launchers were carried on the right side of the turret. The grenade launcher mechanisms were cut down Lee–Enfield rifles, each loaded with a smoke grenade. Its camouflage scheme was designed by Major Denys Pavitt of the Camouflage Development and Training Centre based on the dazzle patterns of First World War ships. The design incorporated block colours, visually breaking the tank in half.

==Production history==

The first Matilda was produced in 1937, but only two were in service when war broke out in September 1939. Following the initial order from Vulcan Foundry, a second order was placed shortly after with Ruston &amp; Hornsby. Some 2,987 tanks were produced by the Vulcan Foundry, John Fowler &amp; Co. of Leeds, Ruston &amp; Hornsby, and later by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at Horwich Works; Harland and Wolff, and the North British Locomotive Company Glasgow. The last were delivered in August 1943.

Peak production was 1,330 in 1942, the most common model being the Mark IV.

The Matilda was difficult to manufacture. For example, the pointed nose was a single casting that, upon initial release from the mould, was thicker than required in some areas. To avoid a needless addition to the tank&#x27;s weight, the thick areas were ground away. This process required highly skilled workers and additional time. The complex suspension and multi-piece hull side coverings also added time to manufacturing.

==Combat history==
===Battle of France 1940===
The Matilda was first used in combat by the 7th Royal Tank Regiment in France in 1940. Only 23 of the unit&#x27;s tanks were Matilda IIs; the rest of the British infantry tanks in France were the smaller machine-gun armed A11 Matilda. Its 2-pounder gun was comparable to other tank guns in the 37 to 45 mm range. Due to the thickness of its armour, it was largely, but not completely, impervious to the guns of the German tanks and anti-tank guns in France. The Germans found the 88 mm anti-aircraft guns were the only effective counter-measure. In the counter-attack at Arras of 21 May 1940, 18 British Matilda IIs (and Matilda Is) were able to briefly disrupt German progress, but, being unsupported, they sustained heavy losses (30 tanks lost) after breaking through to the rear area of 7th Panzer Division. A gun line of artillery and later 88mm flak guns, personally organised by the divisional commander General Erwin Rommel was needed to repel the attack. All vehicles surviving the battles around Dunkirk were abandoned when the British Expeditionary Force evacuated.

===North Africa 1940 to 1942===
Up to early 1942, in the war in North Africa, the Matilda proved highly effective against Italian and German tanks, although vulnerable to the larger calibre and medium calibre anti-tank guns.

In late 1940, during Operation Compass, Matildas of the British 7th Armoured Division wreaked havoc among the Italian forces in Egypt. The Italians were equipped with L3 tankettes and M11/39 medium tanks, neither of which had any chance against the Matildas. Italian gunners were to discover that the Matildas were impervious to a wide assortment of artillery. Matildas continued to confound the Italians as the British pushed them out of Egypt and entered Libya to take Bardia and Tobruk. Even as late as November 1941, German infantry combat reports show the impotence of ill-equipped infantry against the Matilda.

Ultimately, in the rapid manoeuvre warfare often practised in the open desert of North Africa, the Matilda&#x27;s low speed and unreliable steering mechanism became major problems. Another snag was the lack of a high-explosive shell (the appropriate shell existed but was not issued). When the German &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; arrived in North Africa, the 88 mm anti-aircraft gun was again pressed into service against the Matilda, causing heavy losses during Operation Battleaxe, when sixty-four Matildas were lost. The arrival of the more powerful 5 cm Pak 38 and 7.5 cm Pak 40 anti-tank guns also provided a means for the German infantry to engage Matilda tanks at combat ranges. Nevertheless, during Operation Crusader Matilda tanks of 1st and 32nd Army Tank Brigades were instrumental in the break-out from Tobruk and the capture of the Axis fortress of Bardia. The operation was decided by the infantry tanks, after the failure of the cruiser tanks of the 7th Armoured Division to overcome the Axis tank forces in the open desert.

As the German army received new tanks with more powerful guns, as well as more powerful anti-tank guns and ammunition, the Matilda proved less and less effective. Firing tests conducted by the &quot;Afrika korps&quot; showed that the Matilda had become vulnerable to a number of German weapons at ordinary combat ranges. Due to the small size of the turret and the need to balance the gun in it, up-gunning the Matilda, without developing a larger turret, was impractical. There was at least one instance of the turret from the A24/A27 cruiser tank series being fitted to a Matilda, complete with 6-pounder gun. As the size of the Matilda&#x27;s turret ring was 54 inches (1.37 m) vs. the 57 inches of the A27, it was possible that a larger turret ring had been superimposed on the hull. The Churchill Mark III also had a 54-inch turret ring but was armed with a 6-pounder and that might have offered an alternative route. It was also somewhat expensive to produce. Vickers proposed an alternative, the Valentine tank, which had the same gun and a similar level of armour protection but on a faster and cheaper chassis derived from that of their &quot;heavy cruiser&quot; Cruiser Mk II. With the arrival of the Valentine in autumn 1941, the Matilda was phased out by the British Army through attrition, with lost vehicles no longer being replaced. By the time of the Second Battle of El Alamein (October 1942), few Matildas were in service, with many having been lost during Operation Crusader and then the Gazala battles in early summer of 1942. Around twenty-five took part in the battle as mine-clearing Matilda Scorpion mine flail tanks.

===Minor campaigns===
In early 1941, a small number of Matildas were used during the East Africa Campaign at the Battle of Keren. However, the mountainous terrain of East Africa did not allow the tanks of B Squadron 4th Royal Tank Regiment to be as effective as the tanks of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment had been in Egypt and Libya.

A few Matildas of the 7th RTR were present during the Battle of Crete and all of them were lost.

===Australian use in the Pacific theatre===

A total of 409 Matilda IIs were supplied by Britain to the Australian army between 1942 and 1944, and a further 33 close-support Matildas were transferred from New Zealand to the Australian army in 1944, as New Zealand made the decision to use only close-support Valentine tanks in the Pacific theatre, to minimise supply problems. The Australian 4th Armoured Brigade used them against Japanese forces in the South West Pacific Area, first in the Huon Peninsula campaign in October 1943. Matilda II tanks remained in action until the last day of the war in the Wewak, Bougainville and Borneo campaigns, which made the Matilda the only British tank to remain in service throughout the war.

The tanks were often employed in dense jungle with limited visibility, and could be subject to point-blank fire from hidden Japanese heavy artillery pieces. The Matilda&#x27;s heavy armour (enhanced by the crews with spare track links) proved to be reasonably effective protection against this. In this fighting, the close-support version of the Matilda, armed with an Ordnance QF 3-inch howitzer, was preferred by the Australians as it was more effective against Japanese bunkers. Local modifications to the tanks included improving the waterproofing, and adding an outside infantry telephone so supporting troops could more easily communicate with the tank crew. Guards were fitted to the suspension to stop it from being tangled with jungle undergrowth, and metal panels fitted to make it harder for Japanese soldiers to attach adhesive demolition charges to the hull.

The Matilda Frog, an Australian-modified version of the tank that replaced the gun with a flamethrower saw some successful use against the Japanese on Borneo. Another Australian version, the Matilda Hedgehog, which could fire seven mortar shells, was successfully tested but was developed too late to see combat service.

Matilda IIs remained in service with the Australian Citizen Military Forces until about 1955.

===Soviet use===
The Red Army received 918 of the 1,084 Matildas sent to the USSR. The Soviet Matildas saw action as early as the Battle of Moscow and became fairly common during 1942. Unsurprisingly, the tank was found to be too slow and unreliable. Crews often complained that snow and dirt were accumulating behind the &quot;skirt&quot; panels, clogging the suspension. The heavy armour on the Matilda was comparable to that of the Red Army&#x27;s KV-1 heavy tanks, but the Matilda had nowhere near the firepower of the KV. Most Soviet Matildas were expended during 1942 but a few served on as late as 1944. The Soviets modified the tanks with the addition of sections of steel welded to the tracks to give better grip.

===Captured use===

Following Operation Battleaxe a dozen Matildas left behind the Axis lines were repaired and put into service by the Germans. Several vehicles were transported to Kummersdorf where they were evaluated, including trials by live fire. The German designation was &quot;Infanterie Panzerkampfwagen Mk.II 748(e)&quot; translating roughly as &quot;Infantry Tank Mk.II Number 748 (English)&quot;. The Matildas were well-regarded by their German users although their use in battle caused confusion to both sides, despite extra-prominent German markings. Czech historian writes that the Romanians had also captured some Soviet Matildas, but no other source mentions this, so it may be a confusion.

===Egyptian use===
Egypt used Matildas against Israel during 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

==Variants==

===Major variants===
* Infantry Tank Mark II (Matilda II) 
: First production model armed with a Vickers machine gun.
* Infantry Tank Mark II.A. (Matilda II Mk II) 
: Vickers machine gun replaced by Besa machine gun. The &quot;A&quot; denoted a change in armament.
* Infantry Tank Mark II.A.* (Matilda II Mk III) 
:New Leyland diesel engine used in place of AEC engines.
* Infantry Tank Mark II (Matilda II Mk IV) 
: With improved engines, rigid mounting and no turret lamp
* Matilda II Mk IV Close Support (CS)
:Variant with QF 3 inch (76 mm) howitzer, firing high explosive or smoke shells. In British service these were generally used by HQ units (usually a single command vehicle), whereas entire Australian squadrons often appear to have used them – frequently in a direct fire role, against Japanese strong points.
* Infantry Tank Mark II (Matilda II Mk V) 
:Improved gear box. Westinghouse air servo used.

===Other variants, field modifications and prototypes===
;UK
* Baron I, II, III, IIIA
:Experimental Matilda chassis with mine flail – never used operationally.
* Matilda Scorpion I / II
:Matilda chassis with a mine flail. Used in North Africa, during and after the battle of El Alamein.
* Matilda II CDL/Matilda V CDL Canal Defence Light
:The normal turret was replaced by a cylindrical one containing a searchlight (projected through a vertical slit) and a BESA machine gun. The searchlight was intended to disorientate and confuse enemy at night.
* (Prototype) Matilda with A27 turret
:Matilda II with modified chassis and Ordnance QF 6 pounder in an A27 turret. One produced, no documentation other than photographs of it remain.
* (Prototype) Matilda II &quot;Black Prince&quot;
:Radio-controlled prototype produced in 1941 using A12E2 with Wilson transmission. Planned uses included use as a mobile target, for drawing fire and so reveal hidden anti-tank guns, or for demolition missions. Planned order for 60 cancelled as it would require conversion of Rackham clutch transmission to the Wilson type. Used a QF 6-pdr Mk. V A gun.

;USSR
* Field modification of Matilda Mark III with 76mm ZiS-5 (redesignated as F-96) gun
:One Matilda Mk.III supplied to the USSR was refitted with the 76.2mm ZiS-5 gun as used on the KV-1. This modification was found to be unsuccessful due to the space taken up by the breech of the ZiS-5 in the Matilda&#x27;s turret, no production was started.

;Australia
* Matilda Frog (25)
:A flamethrower tank, this was fitted with a flame projector in place of the main gun, disguised with a tube to make the Frog resemble a normal, gun-tank. To avoid the complication of engineering a rotating, high-pressure joint, the flamethrower&#x27;s fuel was in an tank inside the turret along with the tank of high-pressure air, which propelled the fuel. This left space for only a single crewman who operated the flamethrower. Several other flame-fuel tanks, totalling were fitted in the hull and used to replenish the turret tank. The flame projector had a range of and fired about with each shot. A problem with the system was that it required a thirty-second interval between shots to build up pressure. The Frog tanks saw action on Borneo and were considered very effective.
* Murray and Murray FT
:Flamethrower tank. Similar to the Frog but with a larger turret fuel tank - . It used cordite instead of compressed air as a flame-fuel propellant. The type never saw action.
* Matilda Tank-Dozer
:This variant featured a hydraulic operated bulldozer on the front of the Matilda II tank. 18 were converted in 1945, with the goal of clearing Japanese roadblocks, filling shell craters, or clearing paths through the rough jungle terrain. When used in combat, the variant lacked success, for they were difficult to steer and the nose often dug into the ground, immobilizing the tank. Of the 18 Matildas equipped with dozers, most were converted back into ordinary Matildas by the end of the war.

* (6)
:Officially known as the &quot;Matilda Projector, Hedgehog, No. 1 Mark I&quot;, this fitted a Hedgehog 7-chambered spigot mortar in an armoured box on the rear hull of several Australian Matilda tanks. The projector was elevated by hydraulics adapted from the Logan traversing mechanism used in M3 Medium tank turrets. The mortars were fired electrically either individually or as a salvo of six (from the 12 o&#x27;clock position; the fifth tube could not be fired unless the turret was traversed to move the radio antenna out of the bomb&#x27;s flightpath. Each bomb weighed and contained of high explosive. The range was up to . Aiming was accomplished by pointing the entire tank; the mounting had no independent traverse, so accuracy was not spectacular, but adequate for the task. Trials at Southport, Queensland, in May 1945 were pronounced a complete success, and the Projector would have been impressive against enemy bunkers, but the war ended before it was used operationally.

==Surviving tanks==
Around 70 Matilda IIs survive in various degrees of preservation. Around 30 are in Australia, with the Bandiana Museum and the Australian armour and artillery museum having one each, others displayed as public monuments or in private ownership, and a notable collection at the Royal Australian Armoured Corps Memorial and Army Tank Museum, at Puckapunyal, Australia; it has five Matilda IIs on display, including a Matilda Frog flame tank, a Matilda Hedgehog and a Matilda Bulldozer.

Tanks in running condition are owned by The Tank Museum Bovington in the United Kingdom, the American Heritage Museum in the United States, and several private owners in Australia. The Tank Museum completely restored a Matilda II tank from 2015 to 2018, with updates provided through YouTube. While a gearbox fault prevented it running at the 2018 Tankfest (its first advertised running event since 2013), the issue was corrected and the tank has run at several events since. The Tank Museum at Bovington also displays the only surviving Matilda Canal Defence Light, currently housed in the Vehicle Conservation Centre. The WW2 Tank Stories display has a Matilda in desert Caunter camouflage scheme In the UK, the Imperial War Museum also has a Matilda - listed as a Mk V - with additional turret ring armour on display at their IWM North site. The Royal NSW Lancers Museum in Parramatta in Sydney has a MKII &quot;ACE&quot; fitted with a 3 in. howitzer in place of the 2 pounder.

Other examples are displayed at the Kubinka Tank Museum in Russia, the Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History in Belgium, the Yad La-Shiryon museum in Latrun Israel, the Musée des Blindés in France, and the Cavalry Tank Museum at Ahmednagar in India.

<text>In computer programming, CAR (codice_1) and CDR (codice_2) ( or ) are primitive operations on cons cells (or &quot;non-atomic S-expressions&quot;) introduced in the Lisp programming language. A cons cell is composed of two pointers; the &quot;car&quot; operation extracts the first pointer, and the &quot;cdr&quot; operation extracts the second.

Thus, the expression codice_3 evaluates to codice_4, and codice_5 evaluates to codice_6.

When cons cells are used to implement singly linked lists (rather than trees and other more complicated structures), the &quot;car&quot; operation returns the &quot;first&quot; element of the list, while &quot;cdr&quot; returns the &quot;rest&quot; of the list. For this reason, the operations are sometimes given the names &quot;first&quot; and &quot;rest&quot; or &quot;head&quot; and &quot;tail&quot;.

== Etymology ==

Lisp was originally implemented on the IBM 704 computer, in the late 1950s.

The popular explanation that &quot;CAR&quot; and &quot;CDR&quot; stand for &quot;Contents of the Address Register&quot; and &quot;Contents of the Decrement Register&quot; does not quite match the IBM 704 architecture; the IBM 704 does not have a programmer-accessible address register and the three address modification registers are called &quot;index registers&quot; by IBM.

The 704 and its successors have a 36-bit word length and a 15-bit address space. These computers had two instruction formats, one of which, the Type A, had a short, 3-bit, operation code prefix and two 15-bit fields separated by a 3-bit tag. The first 15-bit field was the operand address and the second held a decrement or count. The tag specified one of three index registers. Indexing was a subtractive process on the 704, hence the value to be loaded into an index register was called a &quot;decrement&quot;. The 704 hardware had special instructions for accessing the address and decrement fields in a word. As a result it was efficient to use those two fields to store within a single word the two pointers needed for a list.

Thus, &quot;CAR&quot; is &quot;Contents of the Address &quot;part&quot; of the Register&quot;. The term &quot;register&quot; in this context refers to &quot;memory location&quot;.

Precursors to Lisp included functions:
*codice_1 (&quot;contents of the address part of register number&quot;),
*codice_2 (&quot;contents of the decrement part of register number&quot;),
*codice_9 (&quot;contents of the prefix part of register number&quot;), and
*codice_10 (&quot;contents of the tag part of register number&quot;),
each of which took a machine address as an argument, loaded the corresponding word from memory, and extracted the appropriate bits.

===704 macros===
The 704 assembler macro for codice_1 was:

LXD JLOC 4 # C( Decrement of JLOC ) → C( C ) # Loads the Decrement of location JLOC into Index Register C
CLA 0,4 # C( 0 - C( C ) ) → C( AC ) # The AC register receives the start address of the list
PAX 0,4 # C( Address of AC ) → C( C ) # Loads the Address of AC into Index Register C
PXD 0,4 # C( C ) → C( Decrement of AC ) # Clears AC and loads Index Register C into the Decrement of AC 

The 704 assembler macro for codice_2 was:

LXD JLOC 4 # C( Decrement of JLOC ) → C( C ) # Loads the Decrement of location JLOC into Index Register C
CLA 0,4 # C( 0 - C( C ) ) → C( AC ) # The AC register receives the start address of the list
PDX 0,4 # C( Decrement of AC ) → C( C ) # Loads the Decrement of AC into Index Register C
PXD 0,4 # C( C ) → C( Decrement of AC ) # Clears AC and loads Index Register C into the Decrement of AC 

A machine word could be reassembled by &quot;cons&quot;, which took four arguments (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;p&quot;,&quot;t&quot;).

The prefix and tag parts were dropped in the early stages of Lisp&#x27;s design, leaving CAR, CDR, and a two-argument CONS.

===Compositions===
Compositions of codice_1 and codice_2 can be given short and more or less pronounceable names of the same form. In Lisp, codice_15 is the equivalent of codice_16; its value is codice_17. Similarly, codice_18 (pronounced ) is the same as codice_19; its value is codice_20. Most Lisps, for example Common Lisp and Scheme, systematically define all variations of two to four compositions of codice_1 and codice_2.

==Other computer languages==
Many languages (particularly functional languages and languages influenced by the functional paradigm) use a singly linked list as a basic data structure, and provide primitives or functions similar to codice_1 and codice_2. These are named variously codice_25 and codice_26, codice_27 and codice_28, etc. In Lisp, however, the cons cell is not used only to build linked lists but also to build pair and nested pair structures, i.e. the codice_2 of a cons cell need not be a list. In this case, most other languages provide different primitives as they typically distinguish pair structures from list structures either typefully or semantically. Particularly in typed languages, lists, pairs, and trees will all have different accessor functions with different type signatures: in Haskell, for example, codice_1 and codice_2 become codice_32 and codice_33 when dealing with a pair type. Exact analogues of codice_1 and codice_2 are thus rare in other languages. Clojure uses codice_25 instead of codice_1 and codice_38 or codice_26 instead of codice_2. Logo, on the other hand, uses codice_25 instead of codice_1 and codice_43 instead of codice_2.

<text>is a 1998 platform game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Dreamcast. It was the first main &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; game to feature 3D gameplay. It follows Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower, Knuckles the Echidna, Amy Rose, Big the Cat, and E-102 Gamma in their quests to collect the Chaos Emeralds and stop Doctor Robotnik from unleashing Chaos, an ancient evil. Controlling one of the six characters—each with their own abilities—players complete levels to progress the story. &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; retains many elements from prior &quot;Sonic&quot; games, such as power-ups and the ring-based health system. Players can play minigames such as racing and interact with Chao, a virtual pet.

Sonic Team began developing &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; in 1997, after the cancellation of the Sega Saturn game &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot;. Led by director Takashi Iizuka and producer Yuji Naka, the team strove to reinvent &quot;Sonic&quot; for the 3D era of video games. &quot;Adventure&quot; features a stronger emphasis on storytelling and role-playing elements in contrast to previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games, while Yuji Uekawa redesigned the series&#x27;s characters for their transition to 3D. Sonic Team attempted to demonstrate the technical prowess of the Dreamcast with realistic graphics and drew inspiration from locations in Peru and Guatemala. The soundtrack was primarily composed by Jun Senoue, who preferred rock music over the electropop of previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games.

Following its reveal at the Tokyo International Forum in August 1998, &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; was highly anticipated and was released in Japan in December 1998, North America in September 1999, and Europe in October 1999. It received critical acclaim and became the Dreamcast&#x27;s bestseller, with 2.5 million copies sold by August 2006. Reviewers considered &quot;Adventure&quot; a major technical advancement and praised the visuals and gameplay. Though critics noted glitches and camera problems, and reactions to the audio were mixed, they considered &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; an exceptional game; some speculated that it could help re-establish Sega as the dominant console manufacturer after the unsuccessful Saturn.

Journalists have retrospectively ranked &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; among the best &quot;Sonic&quot; games, and it is recognized as an important release in both the series and the platform genre. Many characters and concepts introduced in &quot;Adventure&quot; recur in later &quot;Sonic&quot; games. &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; was released in 2001. &quot;Adventure&quot; was ported to the GameCube and Windows in 2003 with modernized graphical choices, more challenges and additional content, while a high-definition version was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2010 and for Windows in 2011. Reviews for these releases were less positive; critics felt the game had not aged well and ran at an inconsistent frame rate.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; is a 3D platform game with action and role-playing elements. Players control one of six anthropomorphic protagonists as they venture to defeat Doctor Robotnik and his robot army, who seeks the seven Chaos Emeralds and the entity Chaos. Six player characters are unlocked as the game progresses, each with their own story and attributes. Sonic the Hedgehog performs a spin dash, homing attack, and light-speed dash; Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower flies, swims, and attacks robots using his tails; Knuckles the Echidna glides, climbs walls, and punches; Amy Rose can defeat enemies using her hammer; Big the Cat is slow and carries a fishing rod he can cast; and E-102 Gamma can shoot laser beams.

At the start of the game, the player is placed in one of three Adventure Fields, open-ended hub worlds inhabited by advice-giving NPCs. The player is guided and instructed by the voice of Tikal the Echidna. Through exploration, the player discovers entrances to levels called Action Stages, some of which must be opened using keys hidden in the Adventure Field. Once the player accesses an Action Stage, they are tasked with a specific objective, which is different for each character. Sonic must reach the level&#x27;s end similarly to prior &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; games; Tails must reach the end before Sonic; Knuckles must find three hidden shards of the Master Emerald; Amy must solve puzzles and avoid being caught by a robot; Big must fish for his pet frog; and Gamma must fight his way through stages using projectiles as a defense.

Some levels include minigames separate from the main story. These feature different styles of gameplay, among them rail shooting, racing, pinball, and sandboarding. Some minigames can only be accessed with particular characters. Fulfilling certain objectives allows the player to obtain bonus items. Unlocked minigames and stages the player has completed can be accessed from a Trial Mode on the title screen.

As with previous &quot;Sonic&quot; installments, players can collect golden rings, which can grant them protection from a single enemy or hazard as well as an extra life if 100 are collected. Also scattered throughout the levels are canisters containing power-ups, such as speed shoes, additional rings, temporary invincibility, and protective shields, and 1-ups. In several stages, the player engages Robotnik or Chaos in a boss fight and must deplete the boss&#x27;s health meter to proceed. Point markers act as checkpoints where the character can respawn after losing a life. 

Players may also discover Chao Gardens, hidden, protective environments inhabited by Chao, a virtual pet. Players can hatch, name, and interact with multiple Chao, and they can raise the status of their Chao by giving them small animals, which can be collected by defeating enemies within the Action Stages. The Dreamcast&#x27;s handheld Visual Memory Unit (VMU) allows the player to download the minigame &quot;Chao Adventure&quot;, in which their Chao walks through a course to evolve and improve its skills. Evolving one&#x27;s Chao improves its performance in competitions called Chao Races. Eggs that can produce special types of Chao are hidden throughout the Adventure Fields. Players can earn emblems by playing through Action Stages, searching through the Adventure Fields, or winning Chao Races. Each Action Stage has three emblems that can be earned by replaying the stages and fulfilling objectives, such as beating the level within a time limit.

== Plot ==
The mad scientist Doctor Robotnik seeks a new way to defeat his nemesis, Sonic, and conquer the world. He learns about Chaos, a creature that, thousands of years ago, helped to protect the Chao and the all-powerful Master Emerald, which balances the power of the seven Chaos Emeralds. When a tribe of echidnas sought to steal the power of the Emeralds, breaking the harmony they had with the Chao, Chaos retaliated by using the Emeralds&#x27; power to transform into a monstrous beast, Perfect Chaos, and wipe them out. Tikal, a young echidna who befriended Chaos, imprisoned it in the Master Emerald along with herself. Robotnik shatters the Master Emerald to release Chaos and tests its natural form on the city of Station Square.

After police fail to defeat Chaos, Sonic and Tails work to stop Robotnik from empowering it with the Chaos Emeralds. Knuckles, the only remaining echidna, sets out to find the shards of the Master Emerald. Robotnik activates a new series of robots, including E-102 Gamma, and orders them to find Froggy, a frog who ate a Chaos Emerald; Froggy&#x27;s owner, Big, seeks him as well. Back in Station Square, Sonic&#x27;s friend Amy protects a Flicky being pursued for its Chaos Emerald. When she and the Flicky are captured, Amy convinces Gamma not to work for Robotnik. Gamma helps her escape before seeking out and destroying the other robots in his series, sacrificing himself in the process. Tails foils Robotnik&#x27;s contingency plan to destroy Station Square via a missile strike.

Although Sonic disrupts Robotnik&#x27;s plans, Chaos absorbs the Chaos Emeralds and transforms into Perfect Chaos. It rebels against Robotnik and destroys Station Square. Through flashbacks from Tikal, who was also released from the Master Emerald, Sonic realizes that Chaos has been in constant torment and sorrow, and that imprisoning it again will not stop it. He uses the Chaos Emeralds to transform into Super Sonic and defeats Perfect Chaos. Chaos calms down when it sees the Chao living peacefully in Station Square, and Tikal takes it somewhere safe to live in peace. Sonic pursues a fleeing Robotnik.

==Development==
===Background===

During the early 1990s, Sega was one of the most successful video game companies due to the rise of its Genesis console. Genesis sales were driven by the popularity of Sega&#x27;s flagship franchise of 2D platform games, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. During this time, series co-creator Yuji Naka worked with Sega Technical Institute (STI) in the United States to develop &quot;Sonic&quot; games. After the completion of &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; in 1994, Naka returned to Japan to work with Sonic Team. STI began developing &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot; for the Sega Saturn&quot;,&quot; planned as the first &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; game to feature full 3D gameplay. &quot;X-treme&quot; suffered a series of setbacks and was canceled in 1996. The cancellation is an important factor in the Saturn&#x27;s commercial failure, leaving it with no original &quot;Sonic&quot; platform game. Meanwhile, Naka and Sonic Team developed original Saturn games, such as &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; (1996).

Naka wanted a 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; game, but felt that only Sonic Team should undertake the endeavor; his refusal to let STI use the &quot;Nights&quot; game engine was instrumental in &quot;X-treme&quot; cancellation. Due to the lack of &quot;Sonic&quot; games on the Saturn, according to &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, Sonic became part of the &quot;background&quot; by mid-1997, so &quot;it was astonishing to see that, just six years after his debut, Sonic was already retro.&quot; &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; designer Takashi Iizuka felt that &quot;Sonic&quot; fans had been let down because Sonic Team was not focusing on the series. Additionally, Kazuyuki Hoshino, who would serve as art director on &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, said he thought during the Saturn era Sonic had become outdated.

===Conception===
In August 1996, shortly after the completion of &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot;, Iizuka proposed &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; as a role-playing-style &quot;Sonic&quot; game with a greater emphasis on storytelling. Sonic Team started to work on it in April 1997 on the Saturn with a 20-strong team. Sonic Team created the first prototype using the &quot;Nights&quot; engine, but the Saturn&#x27;s limited capabilities made development difficult. Sega president Hayao Nakayama informed Naka of the Saturn&#x27;s successor, the Dreamcast, and he believed the new console would allow Sonic Team to create the ultimate &quot;Sonic&quot; game. When the team learned the Dreamcast was nearing completion, they moved development to take advantage of its greater quantity of RAM, stronger CPU, and the VMU. Not wanting to waste their completed work, they placed it as a bonus in the compilation game &quot;Sonic Jam&quot;, the final &quot;Sonic&quot; game for the Saturn. Development on the Dreamcast began in July 1997.

Iizuka served as director on &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, while Naka produced. One of the largest video games created at the time, the team had grown to 60 after 10 months, and over 100 developers worked on the game in total. Sonic Team undertook development in conjunction with the Dreamcast, aiming to release the game in December 1998, even if it meant making improvements after release. Developing &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; at the same time as the system, which was not completed until two months before the game&#x27;s release, gave Iizuka influence over the console&#x27;s development; for example, he was able to request more RAM for the console specifically for &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;. According to former Sega of America producer Mark Subotnick, Naka canceled &quot;Geist Force&quot;, an on-rails shooter that was planned as a Dreamcast launch game, so he could use its proprietary software for &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;.

=== Characters and art ===
Sonic Team felt challenged by the new hardware to recreate Sonic and his world in a new way. They began development using the character designs from the Genesis games, but quickly discovered the characters&#x27; bodies were too short and their heads too big, making them difficult to see. Retro game characters, such as Pac-Man, were also being reborn in a more &quot;urban&quot; fashion around the same time, something that made Sonic Team jealous and feel the original character designs were dated. As such, Yuji Uekawa redesigned each character to suit the transition to 3D and to give them &quot;new, edgy, more Western&quot; design. Looking to the animation of Walt Disney and &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; for inspiration, he made Sonic more mature, taller and slimmer, and gave him longer quills. He darkened his blue color and gave him green irises to contrast with the rest of his color scheme, as well as reference Green Hill Zone. Uekawa tried to make Sonic look like a comic book character and compared the style to graffiti. After redesigning Sonic, he made the other characters fit this new art style. Hoshino noted that the characters&#x27; longer limbs made it easier to recreate their 2D poses in 3D.

&quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; features two new playable characters, Big and Gamma. Sonic Team had already implemented an in-game fishing rod with no context or use, leading to the creation of Big. Big was designed to be giant and relaxed so the player would not expect something more intense. Gamma and his playstyle were created in response to fans who wanted elements of a shoot &#x27;em up in &quot;Sonic&quot; and because of Iizuka&#x27;s desire to include &quot;some type of satisfying gameplay that couldn&#x27;t be done with Sonic&quot;. Neither Big nor Gamma were intended to play a large role, thus both of their campaigns were short. Iizuka also wanted to create a villain who would have been impossible to make on older hardware. He settled on something liquid and transparent and created Chaos. Iizuka presented the concept to Naka, who was impressed. Chaos was originally intended to have realistic blue scales in his final form, but this was abandoned because of the technological constraints of the Dreamcast.

While some &quot;Sonic&quot; games, such as 1993&#x27;s &quot;Sonic CD&quot;, contained limited voice work, &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; was the first &quot;Sonic&quot; game to feature extensive voice acting. The decision was made early in development as the game was more story-focused than previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games. Sonic Team&#x27;s staff had differing opinions about how Sonic should sound. Iizuka recalled that the only element they agreed on was to avoid using an anime voice actor, favoring a film actor with an &quot;over-the-top&quot; voice. Sonic Team cast Jun&#x27;ichi Kanemaru as Sonic. In an interview celebrating his 30th anniversary as a voice actor, Kanemaru said one reason he was cast was because of his ability to speak English. After Sonic Team USA was formed, they hired American actors to translate the Japanese script. The English-language voice cast consists of Ryan Drummond as Sonic, Corey Bringas as Tails, Michael McGaharn as Knuckles, Jennifer Douillard as Amy, Jon St. John as Big and E-102 Gamma, and Deem Bristow as Robotnik. Iizuka used &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; to introduce Robotnik&#x27;s Japanese name, &quot;Dr. Eggman&quot;, to western audiences; he accomplished this by having Sonic insult Robotnik when they meet for the first time in-game. Similarly, he avoided referring to Tails as &quot;Miles&quot;, which he was commonly called in Japan.

Because &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; was a Dreamcast launch game, the team strove to demonstrate the console&#x27;s capabilities with realistic graphics. To achieve a more realistic feel for the environments, the core members of Sonic Team visited temples, jungles, and ancient ruins in Mesoamerican landscapes, including Cancún, Guatemala, and Peru. While Sonic Team members had to draw artwork by hand for games in the past, for &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; they were able to use photographs taken during their visits as textures. The greatest influences were the Tikal ruin in Guatemala and Machu Picchu in Peru. The character Tikal was inspired by Peru and took her name from the Guatemalan ruins. The 3D visuals were created using a Voodoo2 graphics chip.

=== Design ===
The levels were designed to feature gameplay similar to the original Genesis games and to take at least five minutes to complete. One of the biggest challenges the &quot;Adventure&quot; designers faced was transitioning &quot;Sonic&quot; 2D style to 3D. In the Genesis &quot;Sonic&quot; games, the player simply had to go right to reach the end of a level, but in &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; they could move in every direction. The designers created models for the stages before testing it as the player character, resulting in trial and error. This made Iizuka realize the importance of the game&#x27;s camera. Some levels, such as the Lost World, were rebuilt dozens of times. Sonic Team split levels into parts to save memory. One particular difficulty was defeating enemies; in the 2D games, enemies were beaten simply by jumping on them, but this was harder to achieve in a 3D game. Therefore, Sonic was given the ability to target enemies in mid-air.

Iizuka said the cinematic sequences were conceived to take advantage of the environments, &quot;giving the player an element of discovery in addition to the platforming&quot;. The team also wanted to add elements unexpected in a platform game; for example, the level in which Tails sandboards was inspired by a group of sandboarders in Ica, Peru. Some levels reference past Sega games, such as Ice Cap (1994&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;) and the Tornado levels (1995&#x27;s &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot;). When seeing the completed level designs, Iizuka and Naka decided to repurpose them for other player characters. Iizuka said they felt it would be &quot;a waste if Sonic just quickly ran through the levels that we spent so much time creating&quot;. The first characters besides Sonic added to the game were Tails and Knuckles; Tails&#x27;s stages turned portions of Sonic&#x27;s levels into races, while Knuckles&#x27;s treasure-hunting missions were designed as a contrast to the others&#x27; straightforward ones. &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; was the first time Amy was playable in a &quot;Sonic&quot; platformer, and Iizuka aimed to use her to add tension, such as hiding from pursuers, that Sonic&#x27;s gameplay could not offer.

Because &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; had a stronger emphasis on storytelling than previous games in the series, the team implemented hub worlds to &quot;draw the players deeper into the world.&quot; The hub worlds&#x27; emphasis on exploring to find new areas and power-ups was inspired by &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. When seeing the completed level designs, Iizuka and Naka decided to repurpose them for other player characters. According to Iizuka, the team tried to include as much content as possible. One addition was the Chao-raising system, which Iizuka conceived to take advantage of the VMU. Sonic Team had used a similar virtual pet system, the &quot;A-Life&quot;, in &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot;; Iizuka used the A-Life as a base, while improving it with the VMU and the option to improve its skills. Iizuka hoped it would be made into a character players could touch and raise. It was also designed to appeal to casual gamers not familiar with games like &quot;Sonic&quot;, and to add replay value. The design took considerable time to finalize and had to be made as simple as possible because the virtual pet&#x27;s look changes form as it evolves.

===Music===

&quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;″s score was primarily composed by Jun Senoue, with additional music by Fumie Kumatani, Kenichi Tokoi, and Masaru Setsumaru. &quot;Adventure&quot; was Senoue&#x27;s first project as sound director and its scope meant he had many more responsibilities, including schedule management, compared to his previous games. Despite this, Senoue said he did not feel much pressure, as he was a &quot;Sonic&quot; fan and had contributed to previous games&#x27; soundtracks.

In contrast to previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games, which featured electropop soundtracks, the &quot;Adventure&quot; sound team preferred &quot;hot, funky, and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot; music. Iizuka noted that Sonic Team&#x27;s primary goal with &quot;Adventure&quot; was &quot;to evoke the essence of Sonic by going from 2D to 3D&quot;, and felt the music needed to exceed fan expectations due to previous &quot;Sonic&quot; soundtracks&#x27; popularity. He stated a new style was adopted because the Dreamcast&#x27;s sound was a significant advance from that of the Genesis; Senoue added he felt more comfortable composing rock music and wanted to create music everyone could enjoy. Despite the different styles, Senoue did retain some music from the Genesis &quot;Sonic&quot; games: the music for the Windy Valley and Twinkle Park levels were rearranged from &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; (1996), while the level clear jingle was taken from &quot;Sonic 3&quot;. He chose to reuse his &quot;3D Blast&quot; tracks because he felt they were strong enough to be more widely heard, as they were only used for the Genesis version (which was not released in Japan).

Senoue composed several songs with English lyrics to highlight the various characters&#x27; personalities, and collaborated with Tokoi and Kumatani to polish them. The main theme, &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;, was performed by Hardline&#x27;s Johnny Gioeli; other songs were performed by Gioeli, Marlon Saunders, Dred Foxx, Ted Poley, Nikki Gregoroff, and Tony Harnell. &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; marked Senoue&#x27;s first collaboration with Gioeli; the two later formed the band Crush 40 (originally known as Sons of Angels), and continue to make music together. Iizuka was inspired to use &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; as the final boss music by films, which he noted often use main themes during dramatic events. Iizuka also felt that the songs helped define Knuckles and Amy&#x27;s personalities, as they had not received much character development in &quot;Sonic&quot; games until &quot;Adventure&quot;.

A two-disc soundtrack, &quot;Sonic Adventure &quot;Digi-LOG Conversation&quot; Original Sound Track&quot;, was released in Japan in January 1999. In May 2011, the soundtrack was rereleased to commemorate the &quot;Sonic&quot; franchise&#x27;s 20th anniversary. A two-volume digital soundtrack was also released on iTunes and Spotify in September 2014 and January 2017, respectively. Brave Wave Productions released a vinyl LP version of the soundtrack including interviews with Senoue and Iizuka in 2018.

==Release==
&quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; was kept a secret during production, though screenshots were leaked in mid-1998 and plans for a 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; game had long been rumored. It was unveiled by Naka and the rest of Sonic Team on August 22, 1998, at the Tokyo International Forum. The team showed off several dynamic elements, such as a chase sequence from the first level and Tails&#x27;s sandboarding sequence. The presentation ended with a live performance of &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; alongside a RealVideo clip montage. Naka described the debut as intense, having &quot;[given his] all&quot; to make it fit for release.

On December 23, 1998, &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; was released in Japan. The Japanese version shipped with many glitches; according to Iizuka, this was because the game was produced on a tight schedule, so Sonic Team did not have time to fix them. Several members of Sonic Team flew to Sega of America to establish Sonic Team USA and patch and translate the game. Prior to the launch of the Dreamcast in the United States, Sega made an exclusive deal with Hollywood Video to allow customers to rent the Dreamcast console along with a non-retail version of the game, &quot;Sonic Adventure: Limited Edition&quot;. The promotion began on July 15, 1999, and took place at 1,055 Hollywood Video stores across the country.

The localized version was released in North America on September 9, 1999, as a launch game, and in Europe on October 14, 1999. It includes Japanese and English-language audio and Japanese, English, Spanish, French and German subtitles. Online features—including Chao daycare and downloadable content (DLC) such as minigames and new level assets—were also added. The American release of Studio Pierrot&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1996) original video animation coincided with the Western release of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, while DIC Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Sonic Underground&quot; (1999) was commissioned to help promote the game. The localized version was released in Japan as &quot;Sonic Adventure International&quot;.

Before release, Sega projected to sell a million copies of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;. &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; is the bestselling Dreamcast game; by August 4, 2006, it had sold 2.5 million copies, including 440,000 in Japan and 1.27 million in the US. In Europe, it sold 86,000 copies during its first five days on sale. In the UK, it was the top-selling Dreamcast launch game. After the North American release, there were complaints of a number of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; discs failing to load. Sega of America determined that this was a software problem due to errors at one manufacturing facility and tracked the faulty software. Most copies were unaffected, and customers with defective copies could trade for working ones at retailers.

==Reception==
As the first fully 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; platform game, &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; was highly anticipated. It received critical acclaim, and &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; (&quot;CVG&quot;) called it one of the greatest video games of all time. &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award in the &quot;Favorite Sega Dreamcast Game&quot; category, and it was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Console Platform Game&quot; award, which went to &quot;Rayman 2: The Great Escape&quot; (1999). The game was a finalist for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Visual Engineering&quot; during the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, which went to &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;.

The visuals and presentation attracted acclaim. &quot;Arcade&quot; described it as a &quot;quantum leap forward&quot; in aesthetics and visual detail in video games, and &quot;Hyper&quot; estimated it exceeded graphics of high-end personal computers. &quot;IGN&quot; called it the most graphically impressive platform game released up to that date, praising its cinematic sequences and describing it as &quot;engrossing, demanding, and utterly awe-inspiring&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; agreed and said only &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;″s graphical quality surpassed that of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; felt the graphical features showed off the Dreamcast&#x27;s potential to the fullest and that the game was &quot;perfect&quot; as a showcase for the system.

The audio received mixed responses. &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;Game Revolution&quot; called the full-motion video (FMV) cutscenes and voice acting well-produced and fitting, though &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted poor lip-synching. &quot;IGN&quot; thought the cutscenes were repetitive and described the voice acting as &quot;a complete joke&quot; and &quot;downright awful&quot;, particularly Tails&#x27;s voice, and later naming it among the most annoying to feature in a video game. &quot;AllGame&quot; was conflicted; they appreciated Tails&#x27;s portrayal but found Sonic&#x27;s and Knuckles&#x27;s voices unfitting. &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;AllGame&quot; praised the rock-style music, but &quot;Game Revolution&quot; described the score as &quot;absolutely horrible&quot;.

The gameplay was generally praised. &quot;GameSpot&quot; admired the straightforward, linear approach to the 3D platform genre and particularly praised it for keeping the basic gameplay of the original Genesis games. &quot;IGN&quot; said the game would keep players busy even after completion, noting its internet connectivity and other extras. However, &quot;Game Revolution&quot; said apart from being quicker, it did not advance the platform genre&#x27;s design. Retrospectively, &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot; called its environments vast and twisted, stating it &quot;brilliantly&quot; captured traditional &quot;Sonic&quot; elements. The Chao minigame was noted as a major departure from the gameplay of the series. &quot;GameSpot&quot; wrote that &quot;while really just a diversion&quot;, the Chao were an interesting, fun addition, singling out their internet functions as a highlight. &quot;AllGame&quot; said the Chao helped increase the replay value, although it was &quot;strange&quot;, required patience, and did not provide bonuses in the main game. &quot;Game Revolution&quot; called the Chao &quot;a neat addition&quot; and praised its use of the VMU.

Some critics compared &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; to &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;—Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;groundbreaking&quot; 1996 game that propelled the Nintendo 64 and the 3D platform genre. &quot;Edge&quot; said &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; was a worthy rival to &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, but &quot;AllGame&quot; wrote that &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; was not as ambitious and that those looking for exploration would be disappointed with its linear gameplay. They compared it to the similarly linear &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; but felt &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; was more confined. Still, they praised the gameplay as varied and said its replay value was strong. The journalists Rusel DeMaria and Johnny L. Wilson retrospectively wrote &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; was not as strong as &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;failed to catch on with players in nearly the way that [&quot;Mario&quot;] had done&quot;, though it had fascinating features, such as &quot;the use of the Tamagotchi-like memory card to incubate eggs for little pet creatures&quot; and &quot;some good action segments&quot;.

The camera system and glitches were criticized by many reviewers. &quot;IGN&quot; called the camera &quot;incredibly&quot; frustrating and inconsistent, and &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted it caused problems with collision detection. &quot;Edge&quot; complained the camera sometimes goes behind walls. Authors from &quot;GamesRadar&quot; retrospectively wrote that &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; was &quot;horrendously buggy&quot;, singling out falling through floors and getting stuck, but also said the sheer amount of content made up for this.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; thought &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; redefined the possibilities of the platform genre, and according to &quot;CVG&quot;, &quot;many things you thought were impossible to see and experience in computer games are now here&quot;. According to &quot;Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Expert gamers may beat the game in only a day or two but, even then, the ride is worth the price of admission.&quot; &quot;AllGame&quot; wrote that the game was an impressive showing of the Dreamcast&#x27;s potential and that it was among the best of the series. &quot;Edge&quot; said its criticisms such as scenery pop-up and instances of poor collision detection are &quot;minor flaws in an otherwise very fine piece of work&quot;. &quot;Arcade&quot; and &quot;CVG&quot; speculated the game could save the Dreamcast, which had not sold well by the end of 1998. &quot;CVG&quot; also thought it could re-establish Sega as the dominant console manufacturer after the relatively unsuccessful Saturn.

==Rereleases==
=== &quot;Sonic Adventure DX&quot; ===
In 2001, Sega announced it would transition from a first-party to a third-party software publisher, in response to the international failures of the Saturn and Dreamcast. Wanting to reach new players by creating an enhanced version of one of its older games, in June 2003 Sega released &quot;Sonic Adventure DX: Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, a port of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; for the GameCube and Windows. While mostly identical to the original release, &quot;Sonic Adventure DX&quot; features updated graphics, including updated textures and more detailed character models, aims for a frame rate of 60 instead of 30, and sports a redesigned Chao-raising system that uses connectivity with the Game Boy Advance (GBA). It includes 60 new missions and the option to unlock emulations of all 12 &quot;Sonic&quot; games released for the Game Gear. Additionally, Metal Sonic can be unlocked as a playable character if all 130 emblems are collected. These features were added to appeal to players of the original game.

&quot;Sonic Adventure DX&quot; received mixed reviews. &quot;GameSpot&quot; was disappointed the rerelease did not address the problems of the original version, iterating the graphics were only marginally different, and dissatisfied with its collision detection. &quot;GameSpot&quot; offered some praise for the extra features, such as the missions, but concluded players were better off playing the Dreamcast version. &quot;IGN&quot; agreed, calling it &quot;a sloppy port of a game that has long been undeserving of its high praise.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; noted its frequent frame rate drops and described its camera one of the worst in a video game. &quot;IGN&quot; said the connectivity to the GBA &quot;Sonic&quot; games added depth but concluded this was not enough to compensate for the port&#x27;s problems. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; was more positive, praising the Game Gear games for retaining their multiplayer support and finding Sonic and Tails&#x27; gameplay enjoyable.

=== HD version ===
In September 2010, Sega rereleased &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; as a downloadable game for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, followed by a Windows release in March 2011 via Steam. This version is based on &quot;Sonic Adventure DX&quot; and supports high-definition visuals at a 4:3 aspect ratio. &quot;Sonic Adventure DX&quot;&#x27;s additional content was removed, but the mission mode and Metal Sonic can be reimplemented by purchasing additional DLC. The game was also included in the &quot;Dreamcast Collection&quot; compilation in 2011 and is backwards-compatible with the Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.

Reviews of the 2010 rerelease were generally unfavorable, with criticism directed at the perceived lack of effort put into the port. &quot;IGN&quot; called it &quot;so fundamentally flawed that it borders on unplayable&quot;, observing that the sections that worked best required the least input from the player. &quot;IGN&quot; criticized the lack of widescreen support but offered minor praise for its steady frame rate. &quot;1UP.com&quot; lambasted the port for what they called its slapdash quality, criticizing its display, controls, and dated design, and saying that it &quot;feels like it wasn&#x27;t even tuned for the Xbox 360 controller and its analog sticks.&quot; &quot;Destructoid&quot; was less harsh, writing that fans of the franchise would be able to enjoy the game but warning casual players that &quot;all you&#x27;ll find is a relic that was once considered greatness.&quot;

In 2024, the game was released on Steam in Japan, having never been made available in the region previously through the platform. The release was teased in December 2023. 

==Legacy==

With most contemporary 3D platform games focusing on exploration and collecting items, &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; stood out with its linear gameplay. According to &quot;GamesRadar&quot;, as one of the first sixth-generation console games, it changed the industry &quot;forever&quot;. &quot;Joystiq&quot; wrote that both &quot;Adventure&quot; and the original &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; had innovated—in 3D and 2D games, respectively—through effective linear level design and by feeling &quot;good to play&quot;. In 2009, &quot;GamePro&quot; listed &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; as the seventh-best platform game of all time, saying that it had not aged well in certain aspects but that its core gameplay remained among the best of the &quot;Sonic&quot; series. Several journalists ranked the game among the series&#x27;s best, but &quot;Kotaku&quot; argued the addition of voice acting and greater focus on plot changed Sonic into &quot;a flat, lifeless husk of a character, who spits out slogans and generally has only one personality mode, the radical attitude dude, the sad recycled image of vague &#x27;90s cultural concept&quot;.

===Influences===
Many of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;″s designs and concepts were reused in later &quot;Sonic&quot; games. The direction, basic gameplay, and Uekawa&#x27;s modernized character designs became series staples. The first level in the 2006 &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; reboot heavily references &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;″s Emerald Coast stage. To celebrate the &quot;Sonic&quot; series&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2011, Sega released &quot;Sonic Generations&quot;, which reused aspects from past games in the franchise. The PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows versions contain reimagined versions of the Speed Highway level and the Perfect Chaos boss fight, and the Nintendo 3DS version contains a remake of Emerald Coast.

Several characters that first appeared in &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; appeared in later games. As well as appearing in &quot;Sonic Generations&quot;, Chaos is an antagonist in the 2017 entry &quot;Sonic Forces&quot;; it and Gamma are playable characters in the 2004 fighting game &quot;Sonic Battle&quot;; and a recreation of its boss fight appears in &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games&quot;. The Chao creatures also feature predominantly in later games. One of the characters introduced in &quot;Adventure&quot;, Big the Cat, became infamous for his negative reception. &quot;Game Informer&quot; considered his gameplay painful and boring, while &quot;Destructoid&quot; decried his portrayal as a &quot;mentally handicapped imbecile&quot; and his voice actor&#x27;s incoherent performance. Big is widely considered by video game journalists the worst character in the &quot;Sonic&quot; franchise, and was named one of the worst game characters in a poll conducted by &quot;1UP.com&quot;.

On October 4, 1999, Sega announced that a sequel to &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; was in development. &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; made its debut at E3 2000 and was released in June 2001. The sequel was designed to be more action-oriented than the slower-paced, story-centric &quot;Adventure&quot; and to give all the characters equal playtime. Like its predecessor, &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; received positive reviews. A concept for &quot;Sonic Adventure 3&quot; was reworked into the 2008 game &quot;Sonic Unleashed&quot;. In 2017, Iizuka stated there were no plans for a third &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; game, saying it would not advance the series&#x27;s design. He did not rule out the idea, saying &quot;If we can get the gameplay to evolve and get to a place where &quot;Adventure 3&quot; makes sense, then you might see an &quot;Adventure 3&quot; come out&quot;. In December 2018, Iizuka expressed interest in remaking &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;.

===Adaptations===
The plot of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; was adapted in the second season of the 2003 &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; anime series &quot;Sonic X&quot;. American licensing corporation 4Kids Entertainment hired a new voice cast for the English-language dub but the Japanese cast from the games reprised their roles in the original version of the show. Archie Comics also adapted the game in its &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic book series. The comic offered an explanation for the altered character designs and established that Station Square was hidden beneath Sonic&#x27;s planet, Mobius.

<doc id="206201" wikidata="Q2896091" url="?curid=206201" title="Hot-tube ignitor">
<text>A hot-tube ignitor was an early device that fit onto the cylinder head of an internal-combustion engine, used to ignite the compressed fuel/air mixture by means of a flame heating part of the tube red-hot. A hot-tube ignitor consisted of a metal or porcelain tube, closed at one end and attached to the cylinder head at the other and an adjustable burner that could be moved to position its flame at any point along the length of the tube.

==Operation==
The hot tube usually enters the combustion chamber at the valve block, to the side of the main cylinder bore in a side-valve, and after an ignition event remains full of a small residue of spent gasses as the piston pushes the majority of such out of the exhaust valve. On the induction stroke, fresh charge cannot ignite arbitrarily as the hot part of the tube is shielded by these spent gasses. On the compression stroke, fresh (unburned) fuel/air mixture is compressed in the main cylinder, which also raises the pressure in the tube and means that the spent gasses therein are forced towards its end. When compression reaches a point that the fresh fuel reaches the red-hot area of the tube, ignition occurs. On early designs, ignition timing was adjusted by adjusting the position of the red-hot spot on the tube - the burner is moved towards the far end to retard ignition, and towards the base to advance. Most later styles used a fixed burner and varied tube lengths to change ignition timing.

==Disadvantages==
Hot-tube ignitors had many problems, most caused by the sudden pressure changes in the tube because of the operation of the engine and the high temperature of the tube. It was extremely difficult to find materials that were both durable enough for these conditions and inexpensive. 

Also important was never setting the burner flame where it would heat the tube white hot, which would rapidly damage the tube and could cause it to burst explosively. This mistake was made often.

The tubes used were typically 6 to 12 inches long, which tended to make them impractical for use on anything but large engines (e.g., stationary motors in factories). Tubes rarely lasted longer than a year before needing replacement, especially when the engines were fueled with high sulfur gases like unpurified producer gas or natural gas.

<text>Commentary is a monthly American magazine on religion, Judaism, Israel and politics, as well as social and cultural issues. Founded by the American Jewish Committee in 1945 under Elliot E. Cohen, editor from 1945 to 1959, &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine developed into the leading post-World War II journal of Jewish affairs. The periodical strove to construct a new American Jewish identity while processing the events of the Holocaust, the formation of the State of Israel, and the Cold War. Norman Podhoretz edited the magazine from 1960 to 1995. 

Besides its coverage of cultural issues, &quot;Commentary&quot; provided a voice for the anti-Stalinist left. As Podhoretz shifted from his original ideological beliefs as a liberal Democrat to neoconservatism in the 1970s and 1980s, he moved the magazine with him to the right and toward the Republican Party.

==History==

===Founding===
&quot;Commentary&quot; was the successor to the &quot;Contemporary Jewish Record&quot;, which was published by the American Jewish Committee (AJC) and ran from 1938 to 1945, when its editor, AJC executive secretary Morris Waldman, retired. 

===20th century===
In 1944, with the &quot;Record&quot;″s editor retiring, the AJC consulted with New York City intellectuals including Daniel Bell and Lionel Trilling, who recommended that AJC hire Elliot Cohen, who had been the editor of a Jewish cultural magazine and was then a fundraiser, to start a new journal. Cohen designed &quot;Commentary&quot; to reconnect assimilated Jews and Jewish intellectuals with the broader, more traditional, and very liberal Jewish community. 

At the same time, the magazine was designed to bring ideas of the young Jewish New York intellectuals to a wider audience. It demonstrated that Jewish intellectuals, and by extension all American Jews, had turned away from their past political radicalism to embrace mainstream U.S. culture and values. Cohen stated his grand design in the first issue:

Although many or even most of the editors and writers had been socialists, Trotskyites, or Stalinists in the past, that was no longer tolerated. &quot;Commentary&quot; articles were anti-Communist and also anti-McCarthyite; it identified and attacked any perceived weakness among liberals on Cold War issues, backing President Harry Truman&#x27;s policies such as the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, and NATO. The &quot;soft-on-Communism&quot; position of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and Henry A. Wallace came under steady attack. Liberals who hated Joseph McCarthy were annoyed when Irving Kristol wrote at the height of the controversy that &quot;there is one thing that the American people know about Senator McCarthy: he, like them, is unequivocally anti-Communist. About the spokesmen for American liberalism, they feel they know no such thing.&quot;

In the late 1950s, the magazine quality sagged, as Cohen suffered from mental illness and committed suicide.

A protégé of Lionel Trilling, Norman Podhoretz took over in 1960, running the magazine with an iron hand until his retirement in 1995.

Podhoretz said, &quot;Commentary&quot; was founded to lead the Jewish intellectuals &quot;out of the desert of alienation...and into the promised land of democratic, pluralistic, and prosperous America&quot;. Cohen brought on board strong editors who themselves wrote important essays, including Irving Kristol; art critic Clement Greenberg; film and cultural critic Robert Warshow; and sociologist Nathan Glazer. &quot;Commentary&quot; published Hannah Arendt, Daniel Bell, Sidney Hook, and Irving Howe.

The emergence of the New Left, which was bitterly hostile to Johnson, to capitalism and to universities, angered Podhoretz for what he perceived as its shallowness and hostility to Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Articles attacked the New Left on questions ranging from crime, the nature of art, drugs, poverty, to the new egalitarianism; &quot;Commentary&quot; said that the New Left was a dangerous anti-American, anti-liberal, and anti-Semitic force. Daniel Patrick Moynihan used &quot;Commentary&quot; to attack the Watts riots and liberals who defended it as a just revolution.

===21st century===
In 2007, the magazine ended its affiliation with AJC when Commentary, Inc., an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit enterprise, took over as publisher.

In 2011, the journal donated its archives from 1945 to 1995 to the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. These included letters and essay revisions.

==Popular culture==
===Films===
&quot;Commentary&quot; has been referred to in three Woody Allen films:

*In 1971, in &quot;Bananas&quot;, as an old lady is threatened on a subway car, Allen hides his face by holding up an issue of &quot;Commentary&quot; in an image now featured at the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn Heights. 

*In 1977, in &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, Allen, as character Alvy Singer, makes a pun by saying that he heard that &quot;Dissent&quot; and &quot;Commentary&quot; had merged to form &quot;Dysentery.&quot; 

*In 1989, in &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;, an issue of &quot;Commentary&quot; lies on a character&#x27;s bedside table.

===Television===
Between 1989 and 1992, in the ABC sitcom &quot;Anything but Love&quot;, stand-up comedian Richard Lewis was often shown holding or reading a copy of &quot;Commentary&quot;.

==Reception and influence==
American-Israeli journalist Benjamin Balint and former editor at &quot;Commentary&quot; described the magazine as the &quot;contentious magazine that transformed the Jewish left into the neoconservative right&quot;. Historian and literary critic Richard Pells said that &quot;no other journal of the past half century has been so consistently influential, or so central to the major debates that have transformed the political and intellectual life of the United States.&quot;

<doc id="206206" wikidata="Q374794" url="?curid=206206" title="Region Gotland">
<text>Region Gotland, legally Gotlands kommun (&quot;&quot;), is a municipality with regional responsibilities that covers the entire island of Gotland in Sweden. The city of Visby is the municipality&#x27;s seat. Gotland Municipality is the 39th most populous municipality in Sweden.

The flag of the municipality is a red ram on a white background.

== History ==
On 31 December 1951 there were 93 local government units on the island of Gotland, among them one city (Visby), one market town (Slite), one county council and a lot of rural municipalities, many of them with fewer than 100 inhabitants.

Twenty years later the situation was totally different.

The first of the two nationwide local government reforms in Sweden during the 20th century was implemented on 1 January 1952. From that date on, the rural municipalities on the island were regrouped into twelve new enlarged municipalities, which together with Visby, Slite and the Gotland County Council formed the new administrative pattern.

After ten years it was clear that this reform had not been radical enough and the work began preparing for the next one.

On 1 January 1971 the second and last local government reform was implemented in Sweden. All administrative and judicial differences between rural and urban areas were abolished. Only one type of municipality (&quot;kommun&quot;) existed from that date on. In the case of Gotland all the former entities were united into one single unit. As there was only one municipality in the county, also the County Council was abolished and merged into the new unitary municipality.

As the municipality is the only one in Sweden with both local &quot;and&quot; regional functions, normally provided separately by the Municipalities and Regional councils respectively, Gotland has a special status as a municipality and has officially been named Region Gotland as of 2011.

== Localities ==
There are 16 urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Gotland Municipality.

In the table the localities are listed according to the size of the population. The municipal seat is in bold characters.

==Demographics==
This is a demographic table based on Gotland Municipality&#x27;s electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT&#x27;s election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.

In total there were 60,941 residents, including 48,274 Swedish citizens of voting age. 59.2 % voted for the left coalition and 39.3 % for the right coalition. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.

== Politics ==

===Riksdag===
These are the results of the elections to the Riksdag held in Gotland since 1973. The results only include parties that have won representation in the Riksdag assembly at least once during this timeframe. The results of the Sweden Democrats were not listed at a municipal level by the SCB between 1988 and 1998 due to the party&#x27;s small size at the time. The respective coalitions are based on which prime minister the party backed at the back end of each governance period.

=== Local ===
Election results:
== Region ==
When Gotland was made into a single municipality in the 1970s, the county council was abolished and its responsibilities transferred to the municipality, making it a unitary authority. During a trial period some of the authority normally held by the Gotland County Administrative Board, an agency of the national government, has also been devolved to the Gotland Municipality, as well as to two mainland councils. The municipality of Gotland is therefore in this respect also a region. It has responsibility for the public healthcare system and public transport.

== Events organised by the municipality ==
The municipality coordinates the annual Almedalen Week (&quot;Almedalsveckan&quot;), an important meetingplace for everyone involved in Swedish politics. During the week, representatives from the political parties in the Riksdag take turns to hold speeches in the Almedalen park in Visby.

<doc id="206208" wikidata="Q726673" url="?curid=206208" title="Swedish-speaking population of Finland">
<text>The Swedish-speaking population of Finland (whose members are called by many names—see below; ; ) is a linguistic minority in Finland. They maintain a strong identity and are seen either as a separate cultural, ethnic or linguistic group or, occasionally, a distinct nationality. They speak Finland Swedish, which encompasses both a standard language and distinct dialects that are mutually intelligible with the dialects spoken in Sweden and, to a lesser extent, other Scandinavian languages.

According to Statistics Finland, Swedish is the mother tongue of about 260,000 people in mainland Finland and of about 26,000 people in Åland, a self-governing archipelago off the west coast of Finland, where Swedish is the sole official language. Swedish-speakers comprise 5.2% of the total Finnish population or about 4.9% without Åland. The proportion has been steadily diminishing since the early 19th century, when Swedish was the mother tongue of approximately 15% of the population and considered a prestige language.

According to a 2007 statistical analysis made by Fjalar Finnäs, the population of the minority group is stable, and may even be increasing slightly in total numbers since more parents from bilingual families tend to register their children as Swedish speakers. It is estimated that 70% of bilingual families—that is, ones with one parent Finnish-speaking and the other Swedish-speaking—register their children as Swedish-speaking.

==Terminology==
The Swedish term (literally &#x27;Finland&#x27;s-Swede&#x27; or &#x27;a Swede-of-Finland&#x27;), which is used by the group itself, does not have an established English translation. The Society of Swedish Authors in Finland and the main political institutions for the Swedish-speaking minority, such as the Swedish People&#x27;s Party and Swedish Assembly of Finland, use the expression &quot;Swedish-speaking population of Finland&quot;, but Swedish-speaking NGOs often use the term &quot;Finland-Swedes&quot;.

The Research Institute for the Languages of Finland proposes &quot;Swedish-speaking Finns&quot;, &quot;Swedish Finns&quot;, or &quot;Finland-Swedes&quot;, the first of which is the sole form used on the institute&#x27;s website. Some debators insist for the use of the more traditional English-language form, &quot;Finland-Swedes&quot;, as they view the labelling of them as &quot;Swedish-speaking Finns&quot; as a way of depriving them their ethnic affiliation, reducing it to merely a matter of language and de-emphasising the &quot;Swedish part&quot; of Finland-Swedish identity, i.e. their relations to Sweden.

Among Finnish Americans the term &quot;Swede-Finn&quot; became dominant before the independence of Finland in 1917, and the term has remained common to the present, despite later immigrants tending to use different terms such as &quot;Finland-Swede&quot;. The expressions &quot;Swedish-speaking Finns&quot;, &quot;Swedes of Finland&quot;, &quot;Finland Swedes&quot;, &quot;Finnish Swedes&quot;, and &quot;Swedish Finns&quot; are all used in academic literature.

==History==
===Medieval Swedish colonisation===
The first Swedish arrivals in Finland have often been linked to the putative First Swedish Crusade (ca. 1150) which, if it took place, served to expand Christianity and annex Finnish territories to the kingdom of Sweden. Simultaneously the growth of population in Sweden, together with lack of land, resulted in Swedish settlements in Southern and Western coastal areas of Finland. The Second Swedish Crusade against the Tavastians in the 13th century extended the Swedish settlements to Nyland (Uusimaa). During the 14th century, the population expansion from Sweden proper increasingly took the form of organised mass migration: the new settlers came in large numbers in large ships from various parts of Sweden&#x27;s Eastern coast, from Småland to Hälsingland. Their departure from Sweden proper to Finland was encouraged and organized by the Swedish authorities. The coast of Ostrobothnia received large-scale Swedish settlements during the 13th and 15th centuries, in parallel with events that resulted in Swedish expansion to Norrland and Estonia&#x27;s coastal area.

===Debate about the origin of the Swedish-speaking population in Finland===
The origin of the Swedish-speaking population in the territory that today constitutes Finland was a subject of fierce debate in the early 20th century as a part of Finland&#x27;s language strife. Some Finland-Swede scholars, such as , and Tor Karsten, used place names in trying to prove that the Swedish settlement in Finland dates back to prehistoric times. Their views were opposed mainly by in the 1920s.

In 1966, the historian Hämäläinen (as referenced by McRae 1993) addressed the strong correlation between the scholar&#x27;s mother-tongue and the views on the Scandinavian settlement history of Finland.
&quot;Whereas Finnish-speaking scholars tended to deny or minimize the presence of Swedish-speakers before the historically documented Swedish expeditions starting from the 12th century, Swedish-speaking scholars have found archeological and philological evidence for a continuous and Swedish or Germanic presence in Finland from pre-historic times.&quot;

Since the late 20th century, several Swedish-speaking philologists, archaeologists and historians from Finland have criticized the theories of Germanic/Scandinavian continuity in Finland. Current research has established that the Swedish-speaking population and Swedish place names in Finland date to the Swedish colonisation of Nyland and Ostrobothnia coastal regions of Finland in the 12th and 13th centuries.

===Nationalism and language strife===
The proportion of Swedish-speakers in Finland has declined since the 18th century, when almost 20% of the population spoke Swedish (these 18th-century statistics excluded Karelia and Kexholm County, which were ceded to Russia in 1743, and the northern parts of present-day Finland were counted as part of the land of Norrland within Sweden). When the Russian Empire set up the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland in 1809 and Karelia was reunited with Finland in 1812, the share of Swedish speakers was 15% of the population.

During the 19th century a national awakening occurred in Finland. The Russian central administration in Saint Petersburg supported it for practical reasons, as a security measure to weaken Swedish influence in Finland. The national cultural trend was reinforced by the general wave of nationalism in Europe in the mid-19th century. As a result, under the influence of the German idea of one national language, a strong movement arose that promoted the use of the Finnish language in education, research and administration. Many influential Swedish-speaking families learned Finnish, fennicized their names and switched to using Finnish as their everyday language. This linguistic change had many similarities with the linguistic and cultural revival of 19th-century Lithuania, where many former Polish speakers expressed their affiliation with the Lithuanian nation by adopting Lithuanian as their spoken language. As the educated class in Finland was almost entirely Swedish-speaking, the first generation of the Finnish nationalists and Fennomans came predominantly from a Swedish-speaking background.

The language issue was not primarily an issue of ethnicity, but an ideological and philosophical issue as to what language policy would best preserve Finland as a nation. This explains why so many academically educated Swedish speakers changed to Finnish, motivated by ideology. Both parties had the same patriotic objectives, but their methods were completely the opposite. The language strife would continue up until World War II.

The majority of the population—both Swedish- and Finnish-speakers—were farmers, fishermen and other workers. The farmers lived mainly in unilingual areas, while the other workers lived in bilingual areas such as Helsinki. This co-existence gave birth to Helsinki slang—a Finnish slang with novel slang-words of Finnish, local and common Swedish and Russian origin. Helsinki was primarily Swedish-speaking until the late-19th century, see: Fennicization of Helsinki.

Apart from the Swedish/Finnish interactions within the Grand Duchy of Finland, some Swedish-speaking Finns - such as the Governor of Russian Alaska Arvid Adolf Etholén (in office 1840 to 1845) and the future Finnish Marshal and President Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim (1867-1951) - made careers within the wider Russian-speaking tsarist system.

===The Swedish nationality and quest for territorial recognition===
The Finnish-speaking parties, under the lead of Senator E. N. Setälä who played a major role in the drafting the language act (1922) and the language paragraphs (1919) in the Finnish constitution, interpreted the language provisions so that they are not supposed to suggest the existence of two nationalities. According to this view Finland has two national languages but only one nationality. This view was never shared in the Swedish-speaking political circles and paved the way for a linguistic conflict. Contrary to the Finnish-speaking view the leaders of the Swedish nationality movement (Axel Lille and others) maintained that the Swedish population of Finland constituted a nationality of its own and the provisions of the constitution act were seen to support the view. The Finnish-speaking political circles denoted the cultural rights of Finland-Swedes as minority rights. The Finland-Swedish political view emphasized the equality of the Swedish nationality next to the Finnish-speaking nationality and the fact the national languages of Finland were the languages of the respective nationalities of the country, not the languages of the state itself. The concept of minority, although de facto the case for Swedish speakers, was perceived as being against the spirit of the constitution. However, gradually after the Second World War, the concept of minority has been increasingly applied to Swedish speakers, even within the Finland-Swedish political discourse.

The Swedish nationality movement was effectively mobilized during the aftermath of Finnish independence and the civil war that shortly followed. The Swedish assembly of Finland was founded to protect the linguistic integrity of Swedish-speakers and seek fixed territorial guarantees for the Swedish language for those parts of the country where Swedish speakers made up the local majority. The Finnish-speaking parties and leadership studiously avoided self-government for Swedish speakers in the Finnish mainland. Of the broader wishes of the Swedish-speaking political movement only cultural concessions—most notably administrative autonomy for Swedish schools and a Swedish diocese—were realized, which nevertheless were sufficient to prevent more thorough conflict between the ethno-linguistic groups.

===Developments since the late 19th century===
The urbanization and industrialization that began in the late 19th century increased the interaction between people speaking different languages with each other, especially in the bigger towns. Helsinki ( in Swedish and predominantly used until the late 19th century), named after medieval settlers from the Swedish province of Hälsingland, still mainly Swedish-speaking in the beginning of the 19th century, attracted Finnish-speaking workers, civil servants and university students from other parts of Finland, as did other Swedish-speaking areas. As a result, the originally unilingual Swedish-speaking coastal regions in the province of Nyland were cut into two parts. There was a smaller migration in the opposite direction, and a few Swedish-speaking &quot;islands&quot; emerged in towns like Tampere, Oulu and Kotka.

According to official statistics, Swedish speakers made up 12.9% of the total population of Finland of 2.6 million in 1900. By 1950 their proportion had fallen to 8.6% of a total of 4 million people, and by 1990 they formed 5.9% of the country&#x27;s 5 million people. This sharp decline has since levelled off to more modest annual declines.

An important contribution to the decline of Swedish speakers in Finland during the second half of the 20th century was that many Swedish speakers emigrated to Sweden. An estimated 30–50% of all Finnish citizens who moved to Sweden were Swedish-speaking Finns. Reliable statistics are not available, as the Swedish authorities, as opposed to their Finnish counterpart, do not register languages. Another reason is that the natural increase of the Finnish-speakers has been somewhat faster than that of the Swedish-speakers until recent times, when the trend has reversed.

During most of the 20th century, marriages across language borders tended to result in children becoming Finnish speakers, and knowledge of Swedish declined. During the last decades the trend has been reversed: many bilingual families chose to register their children as Swedish speakers and put their children in Swedish schools. One motive is the language skills needed during their professional lives. Population statistics do not recognize bilingualism.

==Historical relationship of the Swedish- and Finnish-speaking populations==
The Finnish substrate toponyms (place names) within today&#x27;s Swedish-speaking areas have been interpreted as indicative of earlier Finnish settlements in the area. A toponymical analysis from e.g. the Turunmaa archipelago—today largely Swedish-speaking—suggests the existence of a large population of native Finnish speakers up until the early modern age. Whether the Finnish settlements prior to the arrival of the Swedes have been permanent or seasonal is debated. According to another toponymic study, some Finnish villages and farms on the south-western coast and the archipelago became Swedish-speaking by assimilation.

According to another view (e.g. Tarkiainen 2008) the two major areas of Swedish language speakers (Nyland and Ostrobothnia) were largely uninhabited at the time of the arrival of Swedes.

According to an interpretation based on the results of recent (2008) genome-wide SNP scans and on church records from the early modern period, Swedish-speaking peasantry has been overwhelmingly endogamous. Historian Tarkiainen (2008) presents that from the late Middle Ages onwards until relatively recent times, Swedish-speaking peasants tended to select their marriage partners from the same parish, often from the same village as themselves. This tends to be the rule among traditional peasant communities everywhere. As tightly knit peasant communities tend to assimilate potential newcomers very quickly, this has meant that most marriages within the Swedish-speaking peasantry during this period were contracted with members of the same language group. During the time of early immigration by Swedes to the coastal regions (approximately between 1150 and 1350), the situation was different and according to a study from the 1970s (as referenced by Tarkiainen, 2008) the intermarriage rate between local Finns and Swedish newcomers was considerable. According to Tarkiainen, in the areas of initial Swedish immigration, the local Finns were assimilated into the Swedish-speaking population.

===Culture, literature and folklore===
Finland-Swedish folklore along the coast has been traditionally maritime-influenced. The folklore themes are typical in the Nordic context. Stories and tales involving the evil water-spirit are central. The origins of some of the tales have been German and French from which they have been adapted to the Nordic milieu. (Finland)-Swedish folklore has also had a significant impact on the folklore of Finnish speakers.

Finland-Swedish literature has a rich legacy. Under the lead of Edith Södergran, who also captivated audiences in the English-speaking world, Gunnar Björling and Elmer Diktonius, the Finland-Swedish modernists of the early 20th century had a significant impact on the whole of Scandinavian modernism.

Tove Jansson is perhaps the most renowned example of Finland-Swedish prose. Her &quot;Moomin&quot; books have fascinated children and adults throughout the world.

On 6 November, Finnish Swedish Heritage Day, a general flag flying day, is celebrated in Finland; the day celebrates the Swedish-speaking population of Finland, their culture, and the bilinguality of Finland.

==Genetics==
In a 2008 study a joint analysis was performed for the first time on Swedish and Finnish autosomal genotypes. Swedish-speakers from Ostrobothnia (reference population of the study representing 40% of all Swedish-speakers in Finland) did not differ significantly from the neighbouring, adjacent Finnish-speaking populations but formed a genetic cluster with the Swedes According to a 2008 Y-DNA study, a Swedish-speaking reference group from Larsmo, Ostrobothnia, differed significantly from the Finnish-speaking sub-populations in the country in terms of Y-STR variation. This study however was comparing one small Swedish-speaking municipality of 4652 inhabitants to Finnish-speaking provinces and only tells about the origin of two different Y-DNA haplotypes.

==Identity==

According to a sociological study published in 1981, the Swedish-speaking Finns meet the four major criteria for a separate ethnic group: self-identification of ethnicity, language, social structure, and ancestry. However, not all Swedish-speaking Finns are willing to self-identify as representatives of a distinct ethnicity. The major political organisation representing the Swedish-speakers in Finland, the Swedish People&#x27;s Party, has defined the Swedish-speaking Finns as a people who express Finnish identity in the Swedish language. The issue is debated: an opposite view is still that the Swedish-speaking Finns are a sub-group of the ethnic Swedes, or &quot;East Swedes&quot;.

Despite these varying viewpoints, the Swedish-speaking population in Finland in general have their own identity distinct from that of the majority, and they wish to be recognized as such. In speaking Swedish, Swedish-speaking Finns predominantly use the Swedish word (approximately translatable as &quot;Finlanders&quot;) when referring to all Finnish nationals. The purpose is to use a term that includes both themselves and Finnish-speaking Finns because the Swedish word , in Finland-Swedish usage, implies a Finnish-speaking Finn. In Sweden, this distinction between and is not widely understood and often not made.

In literature regarding to international law and minority rights, a view that the Swedish-speakers in Finland not only constitute an ethnic minority but a distinct nationality has also been presented.

Marriages between Swedish- and Finnish-speakers are nowadays very common. According to a study commissioned by the Swedish Assembly of Finland in 2005, 48.5% of all families with children where at least one of the parents was Swedish-speaking were bilingual in the sense of one parent being Swedish- and the other Finnish-speaking (only families living in those municipalities where Swedish was at least a co-official language were included in this study). 67.7% of the children from these bilingual families were registered as Swedish-speaking. The proportion of those who attended schools where Swedish was the language of instruction was even higher. The Finnish authorities classify a person as a Swedish- or Finnish-speaker based only upon that person&#x27;s (or parent&#x27;s) own choice, which can be changed at any time. It is only possible to be registered either as Swedish- or Finnish-speaking, not both as in Canada, for example. It is significantly more common nowadays than it used to be for children from bilingual families to be registered as Swedish-speaking.

==Historical predominance of the Swedish language among the gentry==

Areas of modern-day Finland were integrated into the Swedish realm in the 13th century, at a time when that realm was still in the process of being formed. At the time of the Late Middle Ages, Latin was still the language of instruction from the secondary school upwards and in use among the educated class and priests. As Finland was part of Sweden proper for 550 years, Swedish was the language of the nobility, administration and education. Hence the two highest estates of the realm, i.e. nobles and priests, had Swedish as their language. In the two minor estates, burghers and peasants, Swedish also held sway, but in a more varying degree depending on regional differences.

Most noble families of the medieval period arrived directly from Sweden. A significant minority of the nobility had foreign origins (predominantly German), but their descendants normally adopted Swedish as their first language.

The clergy in the earlier part the formation of the Lutheran Church (in its High Church form) was constituted most often of the wealthier strata of the peasantry with the closely linked medieval Finnish nobility and the rising burgher class in the expanding cities. The Church required fluency in Finnish from clergymen serving in predominantly or totally Finnish-speaking parishes (most of the country); consequently clerical families tended to maintain a high degree of functional bilingualism. Clerical families in the whole seem to have been more fluent in Finnish than the burghers as whole. In the Middle Ages, commerce in the Swedish realm, including Finland, was dominated by German merchants who immigrated in large numbers to the cities and towns of Sweden and Finland. As a result, the wealthier burghers in Sweden (and in cities as Turku (Åbo) and Vyborg (Viborg)) during the late Middle Ages tended to be of German origin. In the 19th century, a new wave of immigration came from German-speaking countries predominantly connected to commercial activities, which has formed a notable part of the grand bourgeoisie in Finland to this day.

After the Finnish war, Sweden lost Finland to Russia. During the period of Russian sovereignty (1809–1917) the Finnish language was promoted by the Russian authorities as a way to sever the cultural and emotional ties with Sweden and to counter the threat of a reunion with Sweden. Consequently, the Finnish language began to replace Swedish in the administrative and cultural sphere during the later part of the 19th century.

The rise of the Finnish language to an increasingly prevalent position in society was, at the outset, mainly a construct of eager promoters of the Finnish language from the higher strata of society, mainly with Swedish-speaking family backgrounds. A later development, especially at the beginning of the 20th century, was the adoption or translation or modification of Swedish surnames into Finnish (fennicization). This was generally done throughout the entire society. In upper-class families it was predominantly in cadet branches of families that the name translations took place.

Opposition to the Swedish language was partly based around historical prejudices and conflicts that had sprung up during the 19th century. The intensified language strife and the aspiration to raise the Finnish language and Finnic culture from peasant status to the position of a national language and a national culture gave rise to negative portrayals of Swedish speakers as foreign oppressors of the peaceful Finnish-speaking peasant.

Even though the proportional distribution of Swedish-speakers among different social strata closely reflects that of the general population, there is still a lingering conception of Swedish as a language of the historical upper class culture of Finland. This is reinforced by the fact that Swedish-speakers are statistically overrepresented among &quot;old money&quot; families as well as within the Finnish nobility consisting of about 6000 persons, of which about two thirds are Swedish-speakers. Still the majority of the Swedish-speaking Finns have traditionally been farmers and fishermen from the Finnish coastal municipalities and archipelago.

==Bilingualism==
Finland is a bilingual country according to its constitution. This means that members of the Swedish language minority have the right to communicate with the state authorities in their mother tongue.

On the municipal level, this right is legally restricted to municipalities with a certain minimum of speakers of the minority language. All Finnish communities and towns are classified as either monolingual or bilingual. When the proportion of the minority language increases to 8% (or 3000), then the municipality is defined as bilingual, and when it falls below 6%, the municipality becomes monolingual. In bilingual municipalities, all civil servants must have satisfactory language skill in either Finnish or Swedish (in addition to native-level skill in the other language). Both languages can be used in all communications with the civil servants in such a town. Public signs (such as street and traffic signs, as illustrated) are in both languages in bilingual towns and municipalities with the name in the majority language being on the top.

The Swedish-speaking areas in Finnish Mainland do not have fixed territorial protection, unlike the languages of several national minorities in Central Europe such as German in Belgium and North Italy. This has caused a heated debate among Swedish-speaking Finns. The current language act of Finland has been criticized as inadequate instrument to protect the linguistic rights of Swedish-speaking Finns in practice. The criticism was partly legitimized by the report (2008) conducted by Finnish government which showed severe problems in the practical implementation of the language act. The recent administrative reforms in Finland have caused harsh criticism in the Swedish-speaking media and created fear over the survival of Swedish as an administrative language in Finland. A special status in the form partial self-determination and fixed protection for Swedish language in Swedish-speaking municipalities have been proposed in Finland&#x27;s Swedish-speaking media.

Following an educational reform in the 1970s, both Swedish and Finnish became compulsory school subjects. The school subjects are not called &quot;Finnish&quot; or &quot;Swedish&quot;; the primary language in which lessons are taught depends upon the pupil&#x27;s mother tongue. This language of instruction is officially and in general practice called the &quot;mother tongue&quot; (&#x27; in Finnish, &#x27; in Swedish). The secondary language, as a school subject, is called the &quot;other domestic language&quot; (&#x27; in Finnish, &#x27; in Swedish). Lessons in the &quot;other domestic language&quot; usually start in the third, fifth or seventh form of comprehensive school and are a part of the curriculum in all secondary education. In polytechnics and universities, all students are required to pass an examination in the &quot;other domestic language&quot; on a level that enables them to be employed as civil servants in bilingual offices and communities. The actual linguistic abilities of those who have passed the various examinations however vary considerably.

Being a small minority usually leads to functional bilingualism. Swedish-speaking Finns are more fluent in Finnish than Finnish-speakers are in Swedish due to the practical matter of living in a predominantly Finnish-speaking country. In big cities with a significant Swedish-speaking population such as Helsinki and Turku, most of them are fluent in both Swedish and Finnish. Although in some municipalities Swedish is the only official language, Finnish is the dominant language in most towns and at most employers in Finland. In areas with a Finnish-speaking majority, Finnish is most often used when interacting with strangers and known Finnish speakers. However, 50% of all Swedish speakers live in areas in which Swedish is the majority language and in which they can use Swedish in all or most contexts (see demographics below).

==Demographics==
Of the Swedish-speaking population of Finland,

* 44% live in officially bilingual towns and municipalities where Finnish dominates,
* 41% live in officially bilingual towns and municipalities where Swedish dominates,
* 9% live in Åland, of whose population about 90% was Swedish-speaking in 2010,
* 6% live in officially monolingual Finnish-speaking towns and municipalities.

==Swedish-speaking immigrants==
There is a small community of Swedish-speaking immigrants in Finland. Many of them come from Sweden, or have resided there (about 8,500 Swedish citizens live in Finland and around 30,000 residents in Finland were born in Sweden), while others have opted for Swedish because it is the main language in the city in which they live, or because their partners are Swedish-speaking. About one quarter of immigrants in the Helsinki area would choose to integrate in Swedish if they had the option. According to a report by Finland&#x27;s Swedish think tank, Magma, there is a widespread perception among immigrants that they are more easily integrated in the Swedish-speaking community than in the majority society. However, some immigrants also question whether they ever will be fully accepted as Finland Swedes. Swedish-speaking immigrants also have their own association, Ifisk, and in the capital region there is a publicly financed project named &quot;Delaktig&quot; aimed at facilitating integration of immigrants who know or wish to learn Swedish. Most if not all immigrants also wish to be fluent in Finnish due to the fact that it is the dominant language in Finnish society.

==Diaspora==
Swedish speakers have migrated to many parts of the world. One study has shown they are more likely to emigrate than the rest of the Finnish population. It is estimated that between the early 1870s and late 1920s, approximately 70,000 Swedish-speaking Finns emigrated to North America. In Minnesota, a number settled on the Iron Range, in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, and in the northeastern part of the state including Duluth and along the North Shore of Lake Superior. Larsmont, Minnesota, a town named after Larsmo, Finland, was founded by Swedish-speaking Finns in the early 1900s.

For a number of reasons, including geographical and linguistic reasons, Sweden has traditionally been the number one destination for Swedish-speaking emigrants. In one study covering the period 2000–2015, over half of the 26,000 Swedish-speaking Finns who had moved abroad moved to Sweden. There are about 200,000 Swedish-speaking Finns living in Sweden (), according to Finnish broadcaster Yle. Due to noticeable differences between Finland Swedish and Swedish as spoken in Sweden, Swedish-speaking Finns have been mistaken for non-native speakers and have been required to take language courses. Groups, particularly (Fris), an interest group, have campaigned for decades in Sweden for recognition as an official national minority group, in addition to the five existing recognized groups: Sámi, Jews, Romani, Sweden Finns, and Tornedalians. The issue has been debated in the Swedish Parliament (Riksdag) several times, with the 2017 attempt failing due to the ethnic group not being established in the country prior to 1900.

The Swedish-Finn Historical Society is a Washington state, USA-based association which aims to preserve the ethnic group&#x27;s emigration history.

From 1990 to 2021, a total of 50,034 Swedish-speaking Finns have emigrated abroad. 76.5% moved to other Nordic countries. The most popular destinations were;
# 32,867 (65.7%)
# 3,437 (6.9%)

<doc id="206209" wikidata="Q3518399" url="?curid=206209" title="Arun Shourie">
<text>Arun Shourie (; born 2 November 1941) is an Indian economist, journalist, author and politician. He has worked as an economist with the World Bank, a consultant to the Planning Commission of India, editor of the &quot;Indian Express&quot; and &quot;The Times of India&quot; and a Minister of Communications and Information Technology in the Vajpayee Ministry (1998–2004). He was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1982 and the Padma Bhushan in 1990. He was awarded the prestigious International Editor of the Year Award in 1982, given by &quot;World Press Review&quot;, New York. 

Popularly perceived as one of the main Hindu nationalist intellectuals during the 90s and early 2000s, for instance writing controversial works on Islam and Christianity apart from attacks on left-wing ideologues, he considers himself skeptical of religions, especially the concept of the organised religion.

== Early life and education ==
Arun Shourie was born in Jalandhar, British India, on 2 November 1941. He is the son of Hari Dev Shourie (1911–2005), who was a well-known consumer activist in India. He was an IAS officer and served as an officer in many departments including Deputy Commissioner of Rohtak. The Government of India awarded Hari Dev Shourie the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Vibhushan, the third and the second highest civilian awards. Hari Dev Shourie was also named on People of the Year by the Limca Book of Records. 

Shourie did his schooling at Modern School, Barakhamba, and received a bachelor&#x27;s in Economics(H) from St. Stephen&#x27;s College, Delhi. He then obtained his doctorate in economics from Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University in 1966.

== Personal life ==
Shourie is married to Anita, and they have a son. His sister is the journalist Nalini Singh. Arun Shourie speaks about his personal life and reviews his life events as case diaries. &quot;My writing is like the case diary of an advocate which is aimed at winning a case&quot; and his opinions on journalism.

He is skeptical of religions, especially the concept of organised religion. He shared his life experiences in the 2011-book &quot;Does He Know a Mother&#x27;s Heart: How Suffering Refutes Religion&quot;. In his 2020-book &quot;Preparing for Death&quot;, he wrote about dealing with mortality, and added that others can approach this eventuality by looking at the examples of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Gautama Buddha, Ramana Maharshi, Mahatma Gandhi and Vinoba Bhave.

== Career ==

=== Economist ===
Shortly after receiving PhD in economics from Syracuse University Shourie joined the World Bank as an economist in 1967 where he worked for more than 10 years. Simultaneously, between 1972 and 1974, he was a consultant to the Indian Planning Commission and it was around this time that he began writing articles as a journalist, criticising economic policy.

=== Journalism ===
In 1975, during The Emergency imposed by then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, Shourie began writing for the &quot;Indian Express&quot; in opposition to what he saw as an attack on civil liberties. The newspaper, owned by Ramnath Goenka, was a focal point for the government&#x27;s efforts at censorship. He became a fellow of the Indian Council of Social Science Research in 1976. In January 1979, Goenka appointed Shourie as executive editor of the newspaper, giving him a &quot;carte blanche&quot; to do with it as he saw fit. He developed a reputation as an intelligent, fearless writer and editor who campaigned for freedom of the press, exposed corruption and defended civil liberties.

Influenced by Gandhian ideals, Shourie has been called a &quot;veteran journalist&quot;. Shourie was a winner of the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1982, in the Journalism, Literature and Creative Communication Arts category as &quot;a concerned citizen employing his pen as an effective adversary of corruption, inequality and injustice.&quot; In 2000, he was named as one of the International Press Institute&#x27;s &quot;World Press Freedom Heroes&quot;. He has also been named International Editor of the Year Award and was awarded The Freedom to Publish Award.

=== Politics ===
Arun Shourie was nominated from the state of Uttar Pradesh as a BJP representative for two successive tenures in the Rajya Sabha, thus being a Member of Parliament for 1998–2004 and 2004–2010. He held the office of Minister of Disinvestment, Communication and Information Technology in the government of India under Vajpayee&#x27;s prime ministership. As Disinvestment Minister, he led the sale of Maruti, VSNL, Hindustan Zinc among others.

Shourie was among many who objected to The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986, which the government headed by Rajiv Gandhi proposed to alleviate communal violence and retain Muslim votes. Claimed by the government to be a reinforcement of India&#x27;s constitutional secularism, it was widely criticised by both Muslims and Hindus. The liberals among them, says Ainslie Embree, saw it as &quot;a capitulation to the forces of Islamic obscurantism, a return ... to the thirteenth century&quot;; the Hindu revivalist critics thought it was &quot;weakening Indian unity&quot;. Shourie wrote articles that tried to show that the treatment of women as required by the Quran would in fact offer them protection, although the application of Islamic law in practice was oppressing them. He was in turn criticised for what was perceived as a thinly-veiled attack on Islam itself, with Rafiq Zakaria, the Muslim scholar, saying that Shourie&#x27;s concern for reform of Islam was in fact demonstrative of Hindu contempt that used the plight of Muslim women as an example of the backwardness of the community. Vir Sanghvi termed it &quot;Hindu chauvinism with a liberal face&quot;.

After the defeat of the BJP in 2009 general elections, Shourie asked for introspection and accountability within the party. He deplored factionalism within the party and those who brief journalists to aid their own agenda.

Shourie has been described by Christophe Jaffrelot, a political scientist, as &quot;a writer sympathetic to militant Hindu themes&quot; and has publicly voiced support for the aims of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a nationalist Hindutva organisation. This has caused unease among some of those who admire his journalism. He has said that, although he sees danger from perceived Muslim violence such as the Godhra train burning incident of 2002, people have tended to redefine the &quot;Hindutva&quot; term. He says that prominent members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), of which he is a member and which has ties to the RSS — specifically, L. K. Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee — have shown their opposition to sectarian hatred and in their attempts to make the BJP inclusive have tried to marginalise those on both the Muslim and Hindu extremes who promote such hatred. As a political scientist, he views that present electoral system does not concern competency and integrity. He emphasised his views in a cultural conference called Tomorrow&#x27;s India Global Summit and added that the pressure to bring about change in the present electoral system should come from the society.

Shourie has opposed reservation, a system of official legal discrimination in India similar to &quot;affirmative action&quot; in the United States. In 2017, he said &quot;Panditji (Jawaharlal Nehru) had rightly said that in that way (reservation) lies not only folly but disaster.&quot;

=== Writer ===
Arun Shourie has written numerous books. According to one review, the traits of his writings are: 

=== Criticism ===
With the exception of Mahatma Gandhi, he has little time for any religious thinker and, says Nussbaum, his books &quot;nowhere ... seek to provide balance; nowhere is there a sense of complexity. All have the same mocking, superior tone.&quot;

Historian D.N. Jha criticized Shourie&#x27;s book &quot;Eminent Historians&quot;, which concerned the NCERT textbook controversies, on the grounds that it contains &quot;slander&quot; and &quot;has nothing to do with history.&quot;

== IIT Kanpur ==
In 2000, Shourie pledged the entire amount (Rs. 12 crore) of discretionary spending available to him under Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) to setting up of Bio-Sciences &amp; Bio-engineering Department at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. In 2005, he again pledged Rs. 11 crore for developing a separate building for Environmental Sciences and Environmental Engineering at the institute.

<doc id="206210" wikidata="Q1006531" url="?curid=206210" title="Discrete Hartley transform">
<text>A discrete Hartley transform (DHT) is a Fourier-related transform of discrete, periodic data similar to the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), with analogous applications in signal processing and related fields. Its main distinction from the DFT is that it transforms real inputs to real outputs, with no intrinsic involvement of complex numbers. Just as the DFT is the discrete analogue of the continuous Fourier transform (FT), the DHT is the discrete analogue of the continuous Hartley transform (HT), introduced by Ralph V. L. Hartley in 1942.

Because there are fast algorithms for the DHT analogous to the fast Fourier transform (FFT), the DHT was originally proposed by Ronald N. Bracewell in 1983 as a more efficient computational tool in the common case where the data are purely real. It was subsequently argued, however, that specialized FFT algorithms for real inputs or outputs can ordinarily be found with slightly fewer operations than any corresponding algorithm for the DHT.

== Definition ==
Formally, the discrete Hartley transform is a linear, invertible function &quot;H&quot;: R&quot;n&quot; → R&quot;n&quot; (where R denotes the set of real numbers). The &quot;N&quot; real numbers &quot;x&quot;0, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;N&quot;−1 are transformed into the &quot;N&quot; real numbers &quot;H&quot;0, ..., &quot;H&quot;&quot;N&quot;−1 according to the formula

:formula_1

The combination formula_2 formula_3 is sometimes denoted , and should not be confused with , or which appears in the DFT definition (where &quot;i&quot; is the imaginary unit).

As with the DFT, the overall scale factor in front of the transform and the sign of the sine term are a matter of convention. Although these conventions occasionally vary between authors, they do not affect the essential properties of the transform.

== Properties ==
The transform can be interpreted as the multiplication of the vector (&quot;x&quot;0, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;N&quot;−1) by an &quot;N&quot;-by-&quot;N&quot; matrix; therefore, the discrete Hartley transform is a linear operator. The matrix is invertible; the inverse transformation, which allows one to recover the &quot;xn&quot; from the &quot;Hk&quot;, is simply the DHT of &quot;Hk&quot; multiplied by 1/&quot;N&quot;. That is, the DHT is its own inverse (involutory), up to an overall scale factor.

The DHT can be used to compute the DFT, and vice versa. For real inputs &quot;xn&quot;, the DFT output &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot; has a real part (&quot;H&quot;&quot;k&quot; + &quot;H&quot;&quot;N−k&quot;)/2 and an imaginary part (&quot;H&quot;&quot;N−k&quot; − &quot;Hk&quot;)/2. Conversely, the DHT is equivalent to computing the DFT of &quot;xn&quot; multiplied by 1 + &quot;i&quot;, then taking the real part of the result.

As with the DFT, a cyclic convolution z = x∗y of two vectors x = (&quot;xn&quot;) and y = (&quot;yn&quot;) to produce a vector z = (&quot;zn&quot;), all of length &quot;N&quot;, becomes a simple operation after the DHT. In particular, suppose that the vectors X, Y, and Z denote the DHT of x, y, and z respectively. Then the elements of Z are given by:

:formula_4

where we take all of the vectors to be periodic in &quot;N&quot; (&quot;XN&quot; = &quot;X&quot;0, et cetera). Thus, just as the DFT transforms a convolution into a pointwise multiplication of complex numbers (&quot;pairs&quot; of real and imaginary parts), the DHT transforms a convolution into a simple combination of &quot;pairs&quot; of real frequency components. The inverse DHT then yields the desired vector z. In this way, a fast algorithm for the DHT (see below) yields a fast algorithm for convolution. (This is slightly more expensive than the corresponding procedure for the DFT, not including the costs of the transforms below, because the pairwise operation above requires 8 real-arithmetic operations compared to the 6 of a complex multiplication. This count doesn&#x27;t include the division by 2, which can be absorbed e.g. into the 1/&quot;N&quot; normalization of the inverse DHT.)

== Fast algorithms ==
Just as for the DFT, evaluating the DHT definition directly would require O(&quot;N&quot;2) arithmetical operations (see Big O notation). There are fast algorithms similar to the FFT, however, that compute the same result in only O(&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;) operations. Nearly every FFT algorithm, from Cooley–Tukey to prime-factor to Winograd (1985) to Bruun&#x27;s (1993), has a direct analogue for the discrete Hartley transform. (However, a few of the more exotic FFT algorithms, such as the QFT, have not yet been investigated in the context of the DHT.)

In particular, the DHT analogue of the Cooley–Tukey algorithm is commonly known as the fast Hartley transform (FHT) algorithm, and was first described by Bracewell in 1984. This FHT algorithm, at least when applied to power-of-two sizes &quot;N&quot;, is the subject of the United States patent number 4,646,256, issued in 1987 to Stanford University. Stanford placed this patent in the public domain in 1994 (Bracewell, 1995).

As mentioned above, DHT algorithms are typically slightly less efficient (in terms of the number of floating-point operations) than the corresponding DFT algorithm (FFT) specialized for real inputs (or outputs). This was first argued by Sorensen et al. (1987) and Duhamel &amp; Vetterli (1987). The latter authors obtained what appears to be the lowest published operation count for the DHT of power-of-two sizes, employing a split-radix algorithm (similar to the split-radix FFT) that breaks a DHT of length &quot;N&quot; into a DHT of length &quot;N&quot;/2 and two real-input DFTs (&quot;not&quot; DHTs) of length &quot;N&quot;/4. In this way, they argued that a DHT of power-of-two length can be computed with, at best, 2 more additions than the corresponding number of arithmetic operations for the real-input DFT.

On present-day computers, performance is determined more by cache and CPU pipeline considerations than by strict operation counts, and a slight difference in arithmetic cost is unlikely to be significant. Since FHT and real-input FFT algorithms have similar computational structures, neither appears to have a substantial &quot;a priori&quot; speed advantage ( and Šević, 1994). As a practical matter, highly optimized real-input FFT libraries are available from many sources (e.g. from CPU vendors such as Intel), whereas highly optimized DHT libraries are less common.

On the other hand, the redundant computations in FFTs due to real inputs are more difficult to eliminate for large prime &quot;N&quot;, despite the existence of O(&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;) complex-data algorithms for such cases, because the redundancies are hidden behind intricate permutations and/or phase rotations in those algorithms. In contrast, a standard prime-size FFT algorithm, Rader&#x27;s algorithm, can be directly applied to the DHT of real data for roughly a factor of two less computation than that of the equivalent complex FFT (Frigo and Johnson, 2005). On the other hand, a non-DHT-based adaptation of Rader&#x27;s algorithm for real-input DFTs is also possible (Chu &amp; Burrus, 1982).

== Multi-Dimensional Discrete Hartley Transform (MD-DHT) ==
The rD-DHT (MD-DHT with &quot;r&quot; dimensions) is given by

formula_5

with formula_6 and where formula_7

Similar to the 1-D case, as a real and symmetric transform, the MD-DHT is simpler than the MD-DFT. For one, the inverse DHT is identical to the forward transform, with the addition of a scaling factor;

and second, since the kernel is real, it avoids the computational complexity of complex numbers. Additionally, the DFT is directly obtainable from the DHT by a simple additive operation (Bracewell, 1983).

The MD-DHT is widely used in areas like image and optical signal processing. Specific applications include computer vision, high-definition television, and teleconferencing, areas that process or analyze motion images (Zeng, 2000).

=== Fast algorithms for the MD-DHT ===
As computing speed keeps increasing, bigger multidimensional problems become computationally feasible, requiring the need for fast multidimensional algorithms. Three such algorithms follow.

In pursuit of separability for efficiency, we consider the following transform (Bracewell, 1983),

formula_8

It was shown in Bortfeld (1995), that the two can be related by a few additions. For example, in 3-D,

formula_9

For formula_10, row-column algorithms can then be implemented. This technique is commonly used due to the simplicity of such R-C algorithms, but they are not optimized for general M-D spaces.

Other fast algorithms have been developed, such as radix-2, radix-4, and split radix. For example, Boussakta (2000) developed the 3-D vector radix,

formula_11

formula_12

formula_13

formula_14

It was also presented in Boussakta (2000) that this 3D-vector radix algorithm takes formula_15 multiplications and formula_16 additions compared to formula_17 multiplications and formula_18 additions from the row-column approach. The drawback is that the implementation of these radix-type of algorithms is hard to generalize for signals of arbitrary dimensions.

Number theoretic transforms have also been used for solving the MD-DHT, since they perform extremely fast convolutions. In Boussakta (1988), it was shown how to decompose the MD-DHT transform into a form consisting of convolutions:

For the 2-D case (the 3-D case is also covered in the stated reference),

formula_19 formula_20 , formula_21

can be decomposed into 1-D and 2-D circular convolutions as follows,

formula_22

where

formula_23 formula_24

formula_25 formula_26

formula_27

formula_28

formula_29

Developing formula_30 further,

formula_31

formula_32

At this point we present the Fermat number transform (FNT). The tth Fermat number is given by formula_33, with formula_34. The well known Fermat numbers are for formula_35 (formula_36 is prime for formula_37), (Boussakta, 1988). The Fermat number transform is given by

formula_38

with formula_39. formula_40 and formula_41 are roots of unity of order formula_42 and formula_43 respectively formula_44.

Going back to the decomposition, the last term for formula_45 will be denoted as formula_46, then

formula_47

formula_48

formula_29

If formula_50 and formula_51 are primitive roots of formula_42 and formula_43 (which are guaranteed to exist if formula_43 and formula_42 are prime) then formula_50 and formula_51 map formula_58 to formula_59 So, mapping formula_60 and formula_61 to formula_62 and formula_63, one gets the following,

formula_64

formula_65

formula_66.

Which is now a circular convolution. With formula_67, formula_68, and formula_69, one has

formula_70

formula_71

where formula_72 denotes term by term multiplication. It was also stated in (Boussakta, 1988) that this algorithm reduces the number of multiplications by a factor of 8–20 over other DHT algorithms at a cost of a slight increase in the number of shift and add operations, which are assumed to be simpler than multiplications. The drawback of this algorithm is the constraint that each dimension of the transform has a primitive root.

<text>Lawrence Henry Summers (born November 30, 1954) is an American economist who served as the 71st United States Secretary of the Treasury from 1999 to 2001 and as director of the National Economic Council from 2009 to 2010. He also served as president of Harvard University from 2001 to 2006, where he is the Charles W. Eliot University Professor and director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at Harvard Kennedy School. In November 2023, Summers joined the board of directors of artificial general intelligence company OpenAI.

Summers became a professor of economics at Harvard University in 1983. He left Harvard in 1991, working as the Chief Economist of the World Bank from 1991 to 1993. In 1993, Summers was appointed Under Secretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton&#x27;s administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury. While working for the Clinton administration, Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also influential in the Harvard Institute for International Development and American-advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states, and in the deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.

Following the end of Clinton&#x27;s term, Summers served as the 27th president of Harvard University from 2001 to 2006. Summers resigned as Harvard&#x27;s president in the wake of a no-confidence vote by Harvard faculty, which resulted in large part from Summers&#x27;s conflict with Cornel West, financial conflict of interest questions regarding his relationship with Andrei Shleifer, and a 2005 speech in which he offered three reasons for the under-representation of women in science and engineering, including the possibility that there exists a &quot;different availability of aptitude at the high end&quot;, in addition to patterns of discrimination and socialization.

After his departure from Harvard, Summers worked as a managing partner at the hedge fund D. E. Shaw &amp; Co. Summers rejoined public service during the Obama administration, serving as the Director of the White House United States National Economic Council for President Barack Obama from January 2009 until November 2010, where he emerged as a key economic decision-maker in the Obama administration&#x27;s response to the Great Recession.

Summers was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on November 30, 1954, into a Jewish family. He was the son of two economists, Robert Summers (who changed the family surname from Samuelson) and Anita Summers (of Romanian-Jewish ancestry), who were both professors at the University of Pennsylvania. He is also the nephew of two Nobel laureates in economics: Paul Samuelson (brother of Robert Summers) and Kenneth Arrow (brother of Anita Arrow Summers). He spent most of his childhood in Penn Valley, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia, where he attended Harriton High School.

At age 16, he entered Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he originally intended to study physics but soon switched to economics, graduating in 1975. He was also an active member of the MIT debating team and qualified for participation in the annual National Debate Tournament three times. He attended Harvard University as a graduate student, receiving his Ph.D. in 1982. In 1983, at age 28, Summers became one of the youngest tenured professors in Harvard&#x27;s history. He was a visiting academic at the London School of Economics in 1987.

==Career==

===Academic economist===

As a researcher, Summers has made important contributions in many areas of economics, primarily public finance, labor economics, financial economics, and macroeconomics. Summers has also worked in international economics, economic demography, economic history and development economics. He received the John Bates Clark Medal in 1993 from the American Economic Association. In 1987, he was the first social scientist to win the Alan T. Waterman Award from the National Science Foundation. Summers is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Some of his popular courses today, as Charles W. Eliot University Professor at Harvard University, include American Economic Policy and The Political Economy of Globalization.

===Public official===
Summers was on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Reagan in 1982–1983. He also served as an economic adviser to the Dukakis Presidential campaign in 1988.

===Chief Economist at the World Bank===
Summers left Harvard in 1991 and served as Vice President of Development Economics and Chief Economist for the World Bank until 1993.

According to the World Bank&#x27;s Data &amp; Research office (March 2017), Summers returned to Washington, D.C., in 1991 as the World Bank&#x27;s Vice President of Development Economics and Chief Economist. As such, Summers played a &quot;key role&quot; in designing strategies to aid developing countries, worked on the bank&#x27;s loan committee, guided the bank&#x27;s research and statistics operations, and guided external training programs.

The World Bank&#x27;s official site also reports that Summer&#x27;s research included an &quot;influential&quot; report that demonstrated a very high return from investments in educating girls in developing nations.

According to &quot;The Economist,&quot; Summers was &quot;often at the centre of heated debates&quot; about economic policy, to an extent exceptional for the history of the World Bank in recent decades.

====&quot;Dirty industries&quot; controversy====

In December 1991, while at the World Bank, Summers signed a memo that was leaked to the press. Lant Pritchett has claimed authorship of the private memo, which both he and Summers say was intended as sarcasm. The memo stated that &quot;the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that. ... I&#x27;ve always thought that under-populated countries in Africa are vastly underpolluted.&quot; According to Pritchett, the memo, as leaked, was doctored to remove context and intended irony, and was &quot;a deliberate fraud and forgery to discredit Larry and the World Bank.&quot;

===Service in the Clinton Administration===

In 1993, Summers was appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs and later in the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury.

Much of Summers&#x27;s tenure at the Treasury Department was focused on international economic issues. He was deeply involved in the Clinton administration&#x27;s effort to bail out Mexico and Russia when those nations had currency crises.
Summers set up a project through which the Harvard Institute for International Development provided advice to the Russian government between 1992 and 1997. Later there was a scandal when it emerged that some of the Harvard project members had invested in Russia and were therefore not impartial advisors.
Summers encouraged then-Russian leader Boris Yeltsin to use the same &quot;three-&#x27;ations&#x27;&quot; of policy he advocated in the Clinton Administration – &quot;privatization, stabilization, and liberalization.&quot;

Summers pressured the Korean government to raise its interest rates and balance its budget in the midst of a recession, policies criticized by Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz. According to the book &quot;The Chastening&quot;, by Paul Blustein, during this crisis, Summers, along with Paul Wolfowitz, pushed for regime change in Indonesia.

Summers was a leading voice within the Clinton Administration arguing against American leadership in greenhouse gas reductions and against US participation in the Kyoto Protocol, according to internal documents made public in 2009.

As Treasury Secretary, Summers led the Clinton Administration&#x27;s opposition to tax cuts proposed by the Republican Congress in 1999.

During the California energy crisis of 2000, then-Treasury Secretary Summers teamed with Alan Greenspan and Enron executive Kenneth Lay to lecture California Governor Gray Davis on the causes of the crisis, explaining that the problem was excessive government regulation. Under the advice of Kenneth Lay, Summers urged Davis to relax California&#x27;s environmental standards in order to reassure the markets.

Summers hailed the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act in 1999, which lifted more than six decades of restrictions against banks offering commercial banking, insurance, and investment services (by repealing key provisions in the 1933 Glass–Steagall Act): &quot;Today Congress voted to update the rules that have governed financial services since the Great Depression and replace them with a system for the 21st century,&quot; Summers said. &quot;This historic legislation will better enable American companies to compete in the new economy.&quot; Many critics, including President Barack Obama, have suggested the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis was caused by the partial repeal of the 1933 Glass–Steagall Act. Indeed, as a member of President Clinton&#x27;s Working Group on Financial Markets, Summers, along with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Arthur Levitt, Fed Chairman Greenspan, and Secretary Rubin, torpedoed an effort to regulate the derivatives that many blame for bringing the financial market down in Fall 2008.

====Views on financial regulation====
On May 7, 1998, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a Concept Release soliciting input from regulators, academics, and practitioners to determine &quot;how best to maintain adequate regulatory safeguards without impairing the ability of the OTC (over-the-counter) derivatives market to grow and the ability of U.S. entities to remain competitive in the global financial marketplace.&quot; On July 30, 1998, then-Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Summers testified before the U.S. Congress that &quot;the parties to these kinds of contract are largely sophisticated financial institutions that would appear to be eminently capable of protecting themselves from fraud and counterparty insolvencies.&quot; At the time Summers stated that &quot;to date there has been no clear evidence of a need for additional regulation of the institutional OTC derivatives market, and we would submit that proponents of such regulation must bear the burden of demonstrating that need.&quot;
In 1999 Summers endorsed the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act which removed the separation between investment and commercial banks, saying &quot;With this bill, the American financial system takes a major step forward towards the 21st Century.&quot;

When George Stephanopoulos asked Summers about the financial crisis in an ABC interview on March 15, 2009, Summers replied that &quot;there are a lot of terrible things that have happened in the last eighteen months, but what&#x27;s happened at A.I.G. ... the way it was not regulated, the way no one was watching ... is outrageous.&quot;

In February 2009, Summers quoted John Maynard Keynes, saying &quot;When circumstances change, I change my opinion&quot;, reflecting both on the failures of Wall Street deregulation and his new leadership role in the government bailout. On April 18, 2010, in an interview on ABC&#x27;s &quot;This Week&quot; program, Clinton said Summers was wrong in the advice he gave him not to regulate derivatives.

===President of Harvard===
In 2001, when George W. Bush became President, Summers left the Treasury Department and returned to Harvard as its 27th president, serving from July 2001 until June 2006. He was Harvard&#x27;s first Jewish president, though his predecessor Neil Rudenstine&#x27;s father was Jewish.

A number of Summers&#x27;s decisions at Harvard have attracted public controversy, either at the time or since his resignation.

====Cornel West affair====
In an October 2001 meeting, Summers criticized African American Studies department head Cornel West for allegedly missing three weeks of classes to work on the Bill Bradley presidential campaign and complained that West was contributing to grade inflation. Summers also claimed that West&#x27;s &quot;rap&quot; album was an &quot;embarrassment&quot; to the university. West pushed back strongly against the accusations. &quot;The hip-hop scared him. It&#x27;s a stereotypical reaction&quot;, he said later. West, who later called Summers both &quot;uninformed&quot; and &quot;an unprincipled power player&quot; in describing this encounter in his book &quot;Democracy Matters&quot; (2004), subsequently returned to Princeton University, where he had taught prior to Harvard University.

====Differences between the sexes====
In January 2005, at a Conference on Diversifying the Science &amp; Engineering Workforce sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Summers sparked controversy with his discussion of why women may have been underrepresented &quot;in tenured positions in science and engineering at top universities and research institutions&quot;. The conference was designed to be off-the-record so that participants could speak candidly without fear of public misunderstanding or disclosure later.

Summers had prefaced his talk, saying he was adopting an &quot;entirely positive, rather than normative approach&quot; and that his remarks were intended to be an &quot;attempt at provocation&quot;.

Summers then began by identifying three hypotheses for the higher proportion of men in high-end science and engineering positions:

# The high-powered job hypothesis
# Different availability of aptitude at the high end
# Different socialization and patterns of discrimination in a search

The second hypothesis, the generally greater variability among men (compared to women) in tests of cognitive abilities, leading to proportionally more males than females at both the lower and upper tails of the test score distributions, caused the most controversy. In his discussion of this hypothesis, Summers said that &quot;even small differences in the standard deviation [between genders] will translate into very large differences in the available pool substantially out [from the mean]&quot;. Summers referenced research that implied differences between the standard deviations of males and females in the top 5% of twelfth graders under various tests. He then went on to argue that, if this research were to be accepted, then &quot;whatever the set of attributes ... that are precisely defined to correlate with being an aeronautical engineer at MIT or being a chemist at Berkeley ... are probably different in their standard deviations as well&quot;.

Summers then concluded his discussion of the three hypotheses by saying:

So my best guess, to provoke you, of what&#x27;s behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon, by far, is the general clash between people&#x27;s legitimate family desires and employers&#x27; current desire for high power and high intensity, that in the special case of science and engineering, there are issues of intrinsic aptitude, and particularly of the variability of aptitude, and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination. I would like nothing better than to be proved wrong, because I would like nothing better than for these problems to be addressable simply by everybody understanding what they are, and working very hard to address them.

Summers then went on to discuss approaches to remedying the shortage of women in high-end science and engineering positions.

This lunch-time talk drew accusations of sexism and careless scholarship, and an intense negative response followed, both nationally and at Harvard. Summers apologized repeatedly. Nevertheless, the controversy is speculated to have contributed to his resigning his position as president of Harvard University the following year, as well as costing Summers the job of Treasury Secretary in Obama&#x27;s administration.

Summers&#x27;s protégée Sheryl Sandberg has defended him, saying that &quot;Larry has been a true advocate for women throughout his career&quot; at the World Bank and Treasury. Referring to the lunch talk, Sandberg said, &quot;What few seem to note is that it is remarkable that he was giving the speech in the first place – that he cared enough about women&#x27;s careers and their trajectory in the fields of math and science to proactively analyze the issues and talk about what was going wrong&quot;.

In 2016, remarking upon political correctness in institutions of higher education, Summers said:

There is a great deal of absurd political correctness. Now, I&#x27;m somebody who believes very strongly in diversity, who resists racism in all of its many incarnations, who thinks that there is a great deal that&#x27;s unjust in American society that needs to be combated, but it seems to be that there is a kind of creeping totalitarianism in terms of what kind of ideas are acceptable and are debatable on college campuses.

====Summers&#x27; opposition and support at Harvard====
On March 15, 2005, members of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which instructs graduate students in Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and undergraduates in Harvard College, passed 218–185 a motion of &quot;lack of confidence&quot; in the leadership of Summers, with 18 abstentions. A second motion that offered a milder censure of the president passed 253 to 137, also with 18 abstentions.

The members of the Harvard Corporation, the University&#x27;s highest governing body, are in charge of the selection of the president and issued statements strongly supporting Summers.

FAS faculty were not unanimous in their comments against Summers. Psychologist Steven Pinker defended the legitimacy of Summers&#x27;s January lecture. When asked if Summers&#x27;s talk was &quot;within the pale of legitimate academic discourse,&quot; Pinker responded &quot;Good grief, shouldn&#x27;t everything be within the pale of legitimate academic discourse, as long as it is presented with some degree of rigor? That&#x27;s the difference between a university and a madrassa. There is certainly enough evidence for the hypothesis to be taken seriously.&quot;

Summers had stronger support among Harvard College students than among the college faculty. One poll by &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; indicated that students opposed his resignation by a three-to-one margin, with 57% of responding students opposing his resignation and 19% supporting it.

In July 2005, a board member of Harvard Corporation, Conrad K. Harper, resigned saying he was angered both by the university president&#x27;s comments about women and by Summers being given a salary increase. The resignation letter to the president said, &quot;I could not and cannot support a raise in your salary, ... I believe that Harvard&#x27;s best interests require your resignation.&quot;

====Support of economist Andrei Shleifer====
Harvard and Andrei Shleifer, a close friend and protégé of Summers, controversially paid $28.5 million to settle a lawsuit by the U.S. government over the conflict of interest Shleifer had while advising Russia&#x27;s privatization program. The US government had sued Shleifer under the False Claims Act, as he bought Russian stocks while designing the country&#x27;s privatization. In 2004, a federal judge ruled that while Harvard had violated the contract, Shleifer and his associate alone were liable for treble damages.

In June 2005, Harvard and Shleifer announced that they had reached a tentative settlement with the US government. In August, Harvard, Shleifer, and the Department of Justice reached an agreement under which the university paid $26.5 million to settle the five-year-old lawsuit. Shleifer was also responsible for paying $2 million worth of damages.

Because Harvard paid almost all of the damages and allowed Shleifer to retain his faculty position, the settlement provoked allegations of favoritism by Summers. His continued support for Shleifer strengthened Summers&#x27;s unpopularity with other professors, as reported in &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;:

==== In Russia ====

An 18,000-word article &quot;How Harvard Lost Russia&quot; in &quot;Institutional Investor&quot; by David McClintick detailed Shleifer&#x27;s alleged efforts to use his inside knowledge of and sway over the Russian economy in order to make lucrative personal investments, all while leading a Harvard group, advising the Russian government, that was under contract with the U.S. The article suggests that Summers shielded his fellow economist from disciplinary action by the university, and it noted that Summers had forewarned Shleifer and his wife Nancy Zimmerman about the conflict-of-interest regulations back in 1996. Summers&#x27;s friendship with Shleifer was well known by the corporation when it selected him to succeed Rudenstine and Summers recused himself from all proceedings with Shleifer, whose case was actually handled by an independent committee led by former Harvard president Derek Bok.

====Connection to Jeffrey Epstein====

An article in &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; in 2003, during Summers&#x27;s tenure as president, detailed a reportedly &quot;special connection&quot; between Summers and Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein pledged to donate at least $25 million to Harvard during Summers&#x27;s tenure to endow Harvard&#x27;s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, and Epstein was given an office at Harvard for his personal use. Epstein otherwise had no formal connection to Harvard. Summers&#x27;s ties to Epstein reportedly began &quot;a number of years...before Summers became Harvard&#x27;s president and even before he was the Secretary of the Treasury.&quot; Flight records introduced as evidence in the 2021 trial of Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell show that Summers flew on Jeffrey Epstein&#x27;s private plane on at least four occasions, including once in 1998 when Summers was United States Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and at least three times while Harvard president. A charity funded by Epstein also donated to the production of a PBS show hosted by Summers&#x27;s wife and Harvard professor Elisa New.

====Winklevoss twins and Facebook====
In February 2004, the Winklevoss twins requested a meeting with Summers in order to ask him to intervene on their behalf in an ongoing dispute they had with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. The Winklevosses believed that Zuckerberg had stolen their idea for a social networking website and launched Facebook on his own, after they had asked him to be a part of their project, then called HarvardConnection. Summers believed that the matter was outside the university&#x27;s jurisdiction and advised the twins to take their complaint to the courts.

====Resignation as Harvard President====
On February 21, 2006, Summers announced his intention to step down at the end of the school year effective June 30, 2006. Harvard agreed to provide Summers on his resignation with a one-year paid sabbatical leave, subsidized a $1 million outstanding loan from the university for his personal residence, and provided other payments. Former University President Derek Bok acted as Interim President while the University conducted a search for a replacement which ended with the naming of Drew Gilpin Faust on February 11, 2007.

===Post-Harvard presidency career===

After a one-year sabbatical, Summers subsequently accepted Harvard University&#x27;s invitation to serve as the Charles W. Eliot University Professor, one of 20 select University-wide professorships, with offices in the Kennedy School of Government and the Harvard Business School. In 2006 he was also a member of the Panel of Eminent Persons which reviewed the work of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. He is a member in the Group of Thirty. He also currently serves on the Berggruen Institute&#x27;s 21st Century Council and was part of a 2015 Berggruen-organized meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping.

===Business interests===
On October 19, 2006, Summers was hired as a part-time managing director of the New York-based hedge fund D. E. Shaw &amp; Co. for which he received $5 million in salary and other compensation over a 16-month period. At the same time Summers earned $2.7 million in speaking fees from major financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers. Upon being nominated Treasury Secretary by President Clinton in 1999, Summers listed assets of about $900,000 and debts, including a mortgage, of $500,000. By the time he returned in 2009 to serve in the Obama administration, he reported a net worth between $17 million and $39 million. He is a former member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group. In 2013, Summers became an early angel investor in India&#x27;s first car rental company, Zoomcar, which was started by his former Harvard Teaching Fellow.

===National Economic Council===
Upon the inauguration of Barack Obama as president in January 2009, Summers was appointed to the post of director of the National Economic Council. In this position Summers emerged as a key economic decision-maker in the Obama administration, where he attracted both praise and criticism. There had been friction between Summers and former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, as Volcker accused Summers of delaying the effort to organize a panel of outside economic advisers, and Summers had cut Volcker out of White House meetings and had not shown interest in collaborating on policy solutions to the economic crisis. On the other hand, Obama himself was reportedly thrilled with the work Summers did in his first few weeks on the job. And Peter Orszag, another top economic advisor, called Summers &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most brilliant economists.&quot; According to Henry Kissinger Larry Summers should &quot;be given a White House post in which he was charged with shooting down or fixing bad ideas.&quot;

In January 2009, as the Obama Administration tried to pass an economic stimulus spending bill, Representative Peter DeFazio (D-OR.) criticized Summers, saying that he thought that President Barack Obama is &quot;ill-advised by Larry Summers. Larry Summers hates infrastructure.&quot; DeFazio, along with liberal economists including Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, had argued that more of the stimulus should be spent on infrastructure, while Summers had supported tax cuts. In late 2008, Summers and economic advisors for then-President-elect Obama presented a memo with options for an economic stimulus package ranging from $550 billion to $900 billion. According to &quot;The New Republic&quot;, economic advisor Christina Romer initially recommended a $1.8-trillion package, which proposal Summers quickly rejected, believing any stimulus approaching $1 trillion would not pass through Congress. Romer revised her recommendation to $1.2 trillion, which Summers agreed to include in the memo, but Summers struck the figure at the last minute.

According to &quot;the Wall Street Journal&quot;, Summers called Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) asking him to remove caps on executive pay at firms that have received stimulus money, including Citigroup.

On April 3, 2009, Summers came under renewed criticism after it was disclosed that he was paid millions of dollars the previous year by companies which he now had influence over as a public servant. He earned $5 million from the hedge fund D. E. Shaw and collected $2.7 million in speaking fees from Wall Street companies that received government bailout money.

===Post-NEC career===

Since leaving the NEC in December 2010, Summers has worked as an advisor to hedge fund D. E. Shaw &amp; Co, Citigroup and the NASDAQ OMX Group while resuming his role as a tenured Harvard professor. In June 2011 Summers joined the board of directors of Square, a company developing an electronic payment service, and became a special adviser at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. He joined the board of person-to-person lending company Lending Club in December 2012. In July 2015 Summers joined the Board of Directors of Premise Data, a San Francisco-based data and analytics technology company that sources data from a global network of on-the-ground contributors.

In April 2016, he was one of eight former Treasury secretaries who called on the United Kingdom to remain a member of the European Union ahead of the June 2016 Referendum.

Summers referred to the United Kingdom&#x27;s Brexit vote on June 23, 2016, in favor of leaving the European Union as the &quot;worst self-inflicted policy wound that a country has done since the Second World War&quot;. However, Summers cautioned that the result was a &quot;wake up call for elites everywhere&quot; and called for &quot;responsible nationalism&quot; in response to simmering public sentiment.

In June 2016, Summers also wrote, &quot;I believe the risks to the US and global economies of Mr Trump&#x27;s election as president are far greater [than passage of Brexit]. If he is elected, I would expect a protracted recession to begin within 18 months. The damage would be felt far beyond the United States.&quot;

=== 2020 presidential election ===
A coalition of progressive groups called on Joe Biden&#x27;s 2020 presidential campaign no longer to use Summers as an advisor, after reports surfaced that Summers was advising the campaign on economic policy. Progressive groups like the Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats petitioned the campaign to disavow Summers, saying, &quot;Summers&#x27;s legacy is advocating for policies that contributed to the skyrocketing inequality and climate crisis we&#x27;re living with today.&quot; Following the outcry, Summers stated he would not be joining a future Biden administration, in the event that Biden defeated Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.

===Candidacy for chairmanship of the Federal Reserve and governorship of the Bank of Israel===
In 2013, Summers emerged as one of two leading candidates, along with Janet Yellen, to succeed Ben Bernanke as chair of the Federal Reserve. The possibility of his nomination created a great deal of controversy with some senators of both parties declaring opposition. On September 15, Summers withdrew his name from consideration for the position, writing: &quot;I have reluctantly concluded that any possible confirmation process for me would be acrimonious and would not serve the interest of the Federal Reserve, the Administration or, ultimately, the interests of the nation&#x27;s ongoing economic recovery.&quot;

During the 2013, Summers had been reported as preferred candidate by the Cabinet of Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to succeed Stanley Fischer as governor of the Bank of Israel. Netanyahu personally asked him to take the post, an offer he turned down.

===Criticism of the Biden Administration, 2021===
Summers emerged as an early opponent of President Joe Biden&#x27;s economic policy, calling the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 &quot;the least responsible macroeconomic policy we&#x27;ve had in the last 40 years&quot; and arguing that it risked economic recession and market destabilization.

===Hamas-led attack on Israel===
In October 2023, following the Hamas-led attack on Israel, several Harvard undergraduate student groups signed a letter condemning the Israeli state, and holding the &quot;Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence&quot;. This letter from Harvard University student groups blaming Israel drew a backlash from several prominent alumni and from Larry Summers, who said that he was &quot;sickened&quot; by it. Summers, though agreeing with Bill Ackman on the need to look at employees&#x27; political views, called Ackman&#x27;s request to release the names of all the students involved in signing the letter &quot;the stuff of Joe McCarthy&quot;. Summers has repeatedly criticized the Harvard administration for its failure to curb what he sees as rising antisemitism at the university since the Hamas attack.

==Personal life==
Summers was diagnosed with Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma around 1983, underwent treatment and has remained cancer-free.
Summers has three children (older twin daughters Ruth and Pamela and son Harry) with his first wife, Victoria Joanne (Perry).
In December 2005, Summers married English professor Elisa New, who has three daughters (Yael, Orli and Maya) from a previous marriage. He lives in Brookline, Massachusetts.

==In popular culture==
The 2010 film &quot;The Social Network&quot;, which deals with the founding of the social networking site Facebook, shows Summers (played by Douglas Urbanski), in his then-capacity as President of Harvard, meeting with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to discuss their accusations against Mark Zuckerberg.

In the 2010 documentary &quot;Inside Job&quot;, Summers is presented as one of the key figures behind the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Charles Ferguson points out the economist&#x27;s role in what he characterizes as the deregulation of many domains of the financial sector.

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;E My Sports&quot; (S30 E17), first broadcast March 17, 2019, the character Principal Seymour Skinner looks at a $100 bill and remarks &quot;$100 bill, autographed by Lawrence Summers. Such a carefree signature, before the great recession.&quot;

<text>The Black and Tan Coonhound is a breed of hunting dog. Developed in the United States from crosses between the Bloodhound and the Black and Tan Virginia Foxhound, this scent hound runs its game entirely by scent and is used primarily for raccoon hunting.

== Description ==
According to the FCI breed standard Black and Tan Coonhound males should be in height with females slightly smaller at although it does not specify a weight range. The United Kennel Club does however include guideline weights of males with females ranging from . The height proportions quoted by the UKC differ from the FCI and allow males to be and females . The coat is short, dense and glossy.

The eyes are hazel to brown, the ears are long, wide, and thin, are set low and far back on the dog&#x27;s head, and hang well down the neck. The black and tan markings are similar to the Doberman&#x27;s and the Rottweiler&#x27;s. The Black and Tan Coonhound&#x27;s bark is loud and baying; it has been described as a deep howl. The breed standard includes muscular legs that are long in proportion to body length. The tail is set slightly below the natural line of the back. If the dog is alert or excited it carries its tail at a right angle.

=== Temperament ===
The Black and Tan Coonhound makes a suitable pet: it is mellow, amiable, calm, and unobtrusive indoors; outdoors, its strong hunting instinct takes over and it can be difficult to turn it from tracking after it starts trailing. As befitting a dog with its heritage, it is strong, independent, and stubborn. The Black and Tan Coonhound is gentle and tolerant with children, but it may be too independent to satisfy a playful child. It is reserved with strangers and in their presence may bay and howl. The Black and Tan Coonhound can run for miles although it is usually content with a moderate jog or long walk, with an occasional excursion into the field. It can wander if it catches a scent, so a safe area is mandatory.

=== Use ===
The courage of the Coonhound also makes it proficient on the hunt for deer, bear, wolf, cougar and other big game although many US states have restricted the hunting of antlered animals with dogs.
However, the primary purpose of the Black and Tan Coonhound is as a raccoon hunting dog. The general impression is that of power, agility and alertness, as well as the ability to cover ground swiftly with powerful rhythmic strides. Each hound has its own distinctive voice which is often recognizable to its owners from a great distance.

=== General care ===
Its coat needs only occasional brushing. Most Coonhounds drool to some extent, and the face may need regular wiping. The ears should also be checked regularly to ensure against ear infections.

=== Health ===
Black and Tan Coonhounds are generally healthy, although there is some risk of hip dysplasia, ear cancer and other ear infections, and eye problems. Litter size is generally eight puppies. Expected longevity is 10–12 years.

== History ==
The Black and Tan Coonhound is descended from the Talbot Hound, found in medieval England after the 11th century. Its ancestry is then traced through the Bloodhound and the Foxhound to the Black and Tan Virginia Foxhound.

In 1945, the Black and Tan Coonhound became the first of the six breeds of coonhounds to be recognized by the American Kennel Club, in the Hound Group. The other breeds, which were not recognized until the 2010s, are the Redbone Coonhound, Plott Hound, Bluetick Coonhound, the American English Coonhound, and the Treeing Walker Coonhound.

<text>Jennifer Lynn Knapp (born April 12, 1974) is an American-Australian folk rock and contemporary Christian music singer-songwriter, author, and LGBTQ advocate. She is best known for her first single &quot;Undo Me&quot; from her Gold-certified debut studio album, &quot;Kansas&quot; (1998), and the song &quot;A Little More&quot; from her Grammy Award-nominated album, &quot;Lay It Down&quot; (2000). &quot;The Way I Am&quot; (2001) was also nominated for a Grammy. In total, the three albums have sold approximately 1 million copies. 

After a seven-year hiatus, Knapp returned to music and announced that she was in a relationship with a woman, sparking controversy among her Christian fans and becoming one of the first and most well-known Christian music artists to come out as gay. On May 11, 2010, she released &quot;Letting Go&quot; which debuted at No. 73 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Knapp&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Facing the Music&quot;, was published in 2014. Since then, she has become an advocate for LGBTQ Christians and continued to perform and create music. Her most recent album is &quot;Kansas 25&quot; (2024), a re-recording of her debut album&quot;.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Knapp was born in Chanute, Kansas, on April 12, 1974, with her twin sister Lori. Knapp has called her childhood &quot;difficult&quot; and &quot;abusive&quot; due in part to her parents&#x27; acrimonious divorce and her father&#x27;s remarriage.

As a teenager, she was a classical trumpet player. In 1992, Knapp attended Pittsburg State University on a music scholarship. Initially, she identified as an atheist; but, after making Christian friends, she converted to Christianity.

With the encouragement of her new friends, Knapp began writing her own Christian music and performing locally as much as possible. Years later, she spoke about the role that her college years played in kickstarting her career: &quot;I just kept saying ‘yes’ to people who asked me to play [...] and people just kept asking me to play.&quot; Knapp began selling her two independent albums at shows. Her second album, &quot;Wishing Well&quot;, attracted the attention of Christian producer TobyMac, who signed her to Gotee Records. She left school to go on tour before finishing her degree.

==Musical career==

=== 1998-2002: Contemporary Christian Music Career ===
&quot;Kansas&quot; (1998), Knapp&#x27;s critically acclaimed studio debut, eventually sold over 500,000 copies, becoming Gold-certified by the RIAA. Knapp won 1999 Dove Awards for New Artist of the Year and Rock Song of the Year for &quot;Undo Me&quot;. She also contributed vocals to Audio Adrenaline&#x27;s cover of &quot;It Is Well with My Soul&quot;, and an early studio version of “A Little More” from &quot;Lay It Down&quot; was featured on Sparrow Records&#x27; &quot;Listen Louder&quot; (1999). Knapp toured the US, singing primarily in churches but also performing at festivals. At the 1999 Lilith Fair, she joined the Indigo Girls and Sarah McLachlan on stage to sing “Closer To Fine”, a performance she has referred to as her favorite concert experience.

In addition to writing and performing music, Knapp co-founded an artist management company, Alabaster Arts, with business partner Steve Thomas. She was motivated by a desire to mentor Christian musicians as well as to ensure she would have a job after her music career. Alabaster&#x27;s clients included Relient K, The O.C. Supertones, and Katy Hudson (later known as Katy Perry). 

Unlike her previous solo acoustic album, &quot;Lay It Down&quot; (2000) featured multiple backing musicians. That year she headlined a national &quot;Christian heavyweight&quot; tour with Third Day, who observed that Knapp helped attract a larger and broader audience for their concerts. In several interviews, Knapp spoke about the possibility of expanding outside of the Christian music market, saying &quot;I want to reach as many people as possible&quot;. The album reached #1 on the Christian music charts and #77 on the Billboard 200 and garnered a nomination for Best Rock Gospel Album in the 2000 Grammy Awards. Additionally, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called her &quot;a rising star in Christian music&quot;.

Knapp headlined a nationwide tour for the first time in 2001. The Back 40 Tour featured Bebo Norman and Justin McRoberts. Recordings from the tour were later released as &quot;Jennifer Knapp Live&quot; (2006). Around this time, her songs were featured on several episodes of the television drama &quot;Felicity&quot;.

Knapp&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Way I Am&quot; (2001)&quot;,&quot; was inspired by the crucifixion and Jesus Christ&#x27;s incarnation. The album was recorded while Knapp was on tour and featured the London Symphony Orchestra on the song &quot;By and By&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; called the album &quot;a project that easily ranks among the best Christian albums released in recent memory&quot;, while Crosswalk.com argued that the album was too much of a departure from Knapp&#x27;s earlier style. &quot;The Way I Am&quot; reached #10 on the Christian music charts and #130 on the Billboard 200; it was nominated for a 2002 Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album but lost to Third Day. In 2002, Knapp toured with Jars of Clay and Shaun Groves on The Eleventh Hour Tour. 

Together, Knapp&#x27;s first three studio albums have sold more than 1 million copies. 
===2002-2008: Hiatus===
Over the course of her Christian music career, Knapp grew increasingly disillusioned with the conservative views of the industry, particularly its emphasis on purity culture and evangelism and its scrutiny of her faith and behavior. She faced burnout due to her hectic schedule that included touring 250 days a year and recording two albums in two years. Additionally, she realized she was interested in pursuing a relationship with her road manager, Karen. She later stated: &quot;I had some difficult decisions to make and what that meant for my life and deciding to invest in a same-sex relationship&quot;. 

By mid-2001, Knapp had resolved to complete the next year&#x27;s contractual obligations and then take a break from her music career. In her memoir, Knapp describes this decision leading to conflict with her business partner at Alabaster Arts; after a legal battle, she lost her shares and was required to pay a percentage of her income to the company. On September 10, 2002, Knapp played the last concert of her Christian music career in Abilene, Texas, and subsequently went on hiatus, eventually moving to Australia. 

While Knapp was on hiatus, her record label continued to release albums of previously recorded music. &quot;The Collection&quot; was released in 2003. The first disc consists of 15 previously released songs that had been selected based on votes from fans, while the second disc contains demos and contributions to other artists&#x27; albums and compilations. Three years later, Gotee Records issued the album &quot;Jennifer Knapp Live,&quot; which features live recordings from four shows in The Back 40 Tour. Her lead guitarist at the time, Mark Lee Townsend, had originally recorded the tracks as a tour memento but lost the tapes. After he rediscovered them, they were compiled into Knapp&#x27;s first live album with no additional retouching in studio. In February 2008, Gotee Records re-issued a 10th anniversary edition of &quot;Kansas&quot; with re-mastered and additional tracks, including &quot;Jesus Loves Me (Wishing Well version)&quot; and other tracks from her 2006 live album.
===2009-2010: Return to Music and Coming Out===
In August 2009, Knapp&#x27;s website was updated with a new design, new management, and a concert date. Her management confirmed to Patrol Magazine that she was working on new material. Her first concert after hiatus was on September 24 with Phillip LaRue at the Hotel Cafe in Los Angeles, California. In February 2010, Knapp announced that her new album, &quot;Letting Go,&quot; would be released on May 11 and supported by a spring 2010 tour with Derek Webb and summer appearances on the revived Lilith Fair tour. 

In interviews with &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, Reuters, and &quot;The Advocate&quot; that were simultaneously published on April 13, 2010, Knapp announced that she is gay and has been in a relationship with a woman since 2002. Additionally, she said that &quot;Letting Go&quot; would not be a Christian album and predicted that her coming out would alienate many of her Christian fans. A few weeks later, the controversy surrounding her coming out was featured on an episode of Larry King Live, where Knapp appeared with Pastor Bob Botsford and Ted Haggard. Knapp defended her identity as a gay Christian to Botsford. When Botsford confronted Knapp for her &quot;sin&quot; of homosexuality, Knapp responded by asking why they weren&#x27;t discussing his sin instead. 

&quot;Letting Go&quot; reached positions on multiple charts, including #3 on US Folk Albums and #73 on Billboard 200. Reviewers called the album: &quot;Jennifer Knapp on steroids&quot;, &quot;new batch of gorgeous, self-revelatory songwriting&quot;, and &quot;a country/pop/indie journey through Knapp’s recent life&quot;. Others mentioned &quot;an engaging, wounded swagger and a radio-ready sheen&quot; and &quot;astonishing straightforwardness and spirituality&quot;. 

=== 2011-Present ===
In 2011, Knapp performed at the first annual Wild Goose Festival, a music and arts festival designed for a liberal Christian audience. Other performers and speakers included Derek Webb, Sarah Masen, and Brian McLaren. Since then, Knapp has performed regularly at the festival. The following summer, Knapp collaborated with Margaret Becker on &quot;The Hymns of Christmas&quot;. It was recorded on a budget with “one mic and one computer&quot; and released later that year. They toured the US together in a van, performing 14 acoustic shows in support of the album release.

In early 2014, Knapp began recording a new album in Nashville with producer Jacob Lawson. The album, &quot;Set Me Free,&quot; was released on October 14, 2014, on Righteous Babe Records. Like &quot;Letting Go&quot; (2010), the album was not marketed to the Christian music industry. In an interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot;, Knapp stated that she felt &quot;freer&quot; as a songwriter on this album compared to her earlier Christian music albums. Her next album was &quot;Love Comes Back Around&quot; (2017)&quot;,&quot; which &quot;Curve&quot; called: &quot;love songs for grown-ups who have come a few miles&quot;. Knapp referred to the album as &quot;my deepest look at love yet&quot; and said that the musical style was less folk rock than she had originally expected. 

As Knapp had predicted, her sexual orientation reduced her music&#x27;s popularity among her Christian fanbase. However, by 2012, she was regularly appearing in front of Christian audiences again, as part of Inside Out Faith, her project of performing music and speaking about her faith and LGBTQ issues. In 2022, Knapp estimated that her fanbase was a mixture of longtime fans of her Christian music and newer fans of her non-Christian music and LGBTQ advocacy work.

To commemorate the 25th anniversary of &quot;Kansas&quot;, Knapp re-recorded the album, releasing &quot;Kansas 25&quot; in May 2024. The album was funded via a Kickstarter campaign.

== Music Style ==
Knapp&#x27;s music has frequently been referred to as rock, especially folk rock. She has been compared to Melissa Etheridge, Jewel, Sheryl Crow, and Natalie Merchant.

From the beginning of her career, Knapp has had a reputation for authenticity and honesty, a quality which distinguished her early music from other CCM and which has also been observed in her later music. Her early music included spiritual themes, especially of sin and redemption, while her later music was less overtly religious.

==Personal life==
Due in part to a difficult childhood, Knapp struggled with alcohol use issues as a young adult. After making Christian friends in college, she converted to Christianity and became celibate for 10 years. 

In her memoir, Knapp describes becoming close friends with and eventually falling in love with her road manager, Karen, while she was a Christian music star. She also describes struggling to reconcile her religious beliefs with her sexual orientation. Karen assisted her in navigating her break from the music industry and dissuaded her from discarding her guitars and music awards. During Knapp&#x27;s hiatus, they travelled together and began dating, eventually moving to Karen&#x27;s birth country, Australia, where Knapp became a citizen.

After announcing her return to music, Knapp publicly came out as gay in 2010. Knapp&#x27;s identity as a gay Christian has been controversial in the Christian community and has reduced her music&#x27;s popularity in the Christian market. However, Knapp has also stated that the reactions to her coming out have been unexpectedly positive and that she has received significant support. 

In 2018, Knapp completed a Master of Theological Studies at Vanderbilt University Divinity School. 

Knapp lives in Nashville and is married. 

== LGBTQ Advocacy and Writing ==
Knapp is one of the first and one of the most well-known Christian music artists to come out as gay. When Knapp first came out in 2010, she stated: &quot;I&#x27;m in no way capable of leading a charge for some kind of activist movement&quot; and &quot;I’m not at all interested in personally being the one who is advocating.&quot; However, by 2014, she was called a &quot;Christian LGBT advocate&quot; for people trying to reconcile their religious beliefs with their sexual orientation. In an interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot;, she stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t have any particular wisdom other than the experience that I&#x27;ve got ... but telling our stories is one of the most important and powerful things we can do.&quot; To that end, Knapp launched Inside Out Faith, through which she speaks at churches and universities about her experiences as a gay Christian.

Knapp&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Facing the Music: My Story&quot;, was published by Howard Books / Simon &amp; Schuster on October 7, 2014. The book discusses her career and her experiences as a Christian and a lesbian. Howard Books, an evangelical publisher, released it during a time of increased discussions around LGBTQ people within evangelical Christianity. Howard&#x27;s VP and Publisher, Jonathan Merkh, stated that he hoped the book would help readers &quot;understand where someone may be coming from as they open up about their sexuality and their faith.&quot; 

In 2015, Knapp gave a University of Nevada TEDx Talk about being a Christian lesbian. In 2019, &quot;The Tennessean&quot; published an opinion column by Knapp and Inside Out Faith co-chair Nancy VanReece critiquing the Contemporary Christian Music industry for excluding &quot;faith rebels&quot; who &quot;are queer, cuss, drink and have sex&quot;. She has also contributed articles on LGBTQ topics to HuffPost.

<doc id="206215" wikidata="Q1282900" url="?curid=206215" title="Horizontal integration">
<text>Horizontal integration is the process of a company increasing production of goods or services at the same level of the value chain, in the same industry. A company may do this via internal expansion or through mergers and acquisitions.

The process can lead to monopoly if a company captures the vast majority of the market for that product or service. Benefits of horizontal integration include: increasing economies of scale, expanding an existing market, and improving product differentiation. 

Horizontal integration contrasts with vertical integration, where companies integrate multiple stages of production of a small number of production units.

==Horizontal alliance==

Horizontal integration is related to horizontal alliance (also known as horizontal cooperation). However, in the case of a horizontal alliance, the partnering companies set up a contract, but remain independent. For example, Raue &amp; Wieland (2015) describe the example of legally independent logistics service providers who cooperate. Such an alliance relates to competition.

== Aspects ==
Benefits of horizontal integration to both the firm and society may include economies of scale and economies of scope. For the firm, horizontal integration may provide a strengthened presence in the reference market. This means that with the merger, two firms would then be able to produce more revenue than one firm alone. It may also allow the horizontally integrated firm to engage in monopoly pricing, which is disadvantageous to society as a whole and which may cause regulators to ban or constrain horizontal integration. Strategies around horizontal mergers often relate to revenue production, reducing market entrants or expanding into new markets. The three forms of horizontal integration are mergers, acquisitions and internal expansion. 

Mergers:

Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) refer to the consolidation of companies or assets through various financial transactions, such as mergers, acquisitions, and consolidations. M&amp;A activities can be an effective way for companies to expand their operations, diversify their product or service offerings, and increase their market share. These activities can also lead to cost savings, increased efficiencies, and access to new technologies or markets.

Mergers involve the combination of two or more companies to form a new entity. This can occur through a stock-for-stock transaction, where shareholders of both companies receive shares in the new entity based on a predetermined exchange ratio. Alternatively, a cash merger can occur, where one company purchases another using cash or other financial instruments.

Acquisitions:

Acquisitions, on the other hand, involve the purchase of one company by another. This can occur through a friendly acquisition, where the target company agrees to the acquisition and its shareholders receive compensation for their shares. Alternatively, a hostile takeover can occur, where the acquiring company purchases a controlling stake in the target company without its approval.

Consolidations refer to the combination of two or more companies to form a single entity without the creation of a new entity. This can occur through the merger of equals, where two companies of equal size and strength combine forces, or through the acquisition of a smaller company by a larger one.

M&amp;A activities can have a significant impact on various stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and suppliers. Shareholders can benefit from increased stock prices and dividends, while employees may face job losses or changes to their employment terms. Customers and suppliers may also be affected by changes to product or service offerings and supplier relationships.

Regulatory bodies play an important role in overseeing M&amp;A activities to ensure they do not violate antitrust laws and do not harm competition in the marketplace. The approval of mergers and acquisitions may also require approval from government agencies or industry regulators.

Overall, mergers and acquisitions can be an effective strategy for companies to achieve growth and gain a competitive advantage. However, careful consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks, as well as regulatory compliance, is essential to ensure a successful outcome for all stakeholders involved.

Internal Expansion:

In addition to mergers and acquisitions, companies can also pursue internal expansion through horizontal integration. This involves expanding their operations and product or service offerings within their existing industry by acquiring or developing new capabilities.

Horizontal integration can take various forms, including expanding through new product development, expanding geographically, or acquiring competitors or suppliers. This strategy can enable companies to increase their market share and achieve economies of scale by leveraging existing resources and capabilities.

Internal expansion through horizontal integration can also involve the integration of different business functions, such as production, marketing, and sales, to streamline operations and increase efficiency. This can result in cost savings and improved profitability.

However, there are potential drawbacks to internal expansion through horizontal integration. It can be costly and time-consuming to develop new capabilities or expand into new markets, and there is a risk that these efforts may not be successful. Additionally, companies may face increased competition and regulatory scrutiny as they expand their operations.

Overall, internal expansion through horizontal integration can be a viable strategy for companies looking to achieve growth and gain a competitive advantage. However, it requires careful planning, execution, and management to ensure success and mitigate potential risks. Companies should also consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of this strategy compared to other growth strategies, such as mergers and acquisitions.

== Media terms ==
Media critics, such as Robert W. McChesney, have noted that the current trend within the entertainment industry has been toward the increased concentration of media ownership into the hands of a smaller number of transmedia and transnational conglomerates. Media is seen to amass in center where wealthy individuals have the ability to purchase such ventures (e.g., Rupert Murdoch).

That emerged are new strategies for content development and distribution designed to increase the &quot;synergy&quot; between the different divisions of the same company. Studios seek content that can move fluidly across media channels.

== Examples ==
An example of horizontal integration in the food industry was the Heinz and Kraft Foods merger. On 25 March 2015, Heinz and Kraft merged into one company, with the deal valued at $46 billion. Both produce processed food for the consumer market.

On 9 December 2013, Sysco agreed to acquire US Foods but on 24 June 2015, the federal judge ruled against the deal saying that such merger would control 75% of the U.S. foodservice industry and that will stifle competition. It would have been horizontal integration, as both distribute food to restaurants, healthcare, and educational facilities.

On 16 November 2015, Marriott International announced that it would acquire Starwood for $13.6 billion, creating the world&#x27;s largest hotel chain. The acquisition was finalized on 23 September 2016.

The AB-Inbev acquisition of SAB Miller for $107 Billion, which completed in 2016, is one of the biggest deals of all time.

On 1 November 2017, Centurylink bought Level 3 Communications for $34 billion, and incorporated Level 3 as part of Centurylink.

On 14 December 2017, The Walt Disney Company announced that they were to acquire 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion in stock, which included the famed 20th Century Fox film studio, FX Networks, and a 30% stake in Hulu. Both companies produced and distributed films and television series, as well as each owning a 30% stake in Hulu. Due to Disney&#x27;s ownership of ABC, the acquisition did not include the Fox Broadcasting Company, as the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s rules prohibited a single company from owning multiple of the four major broadcast networks; the Fox Broadcasting Company was instead planned to be spun-off into a new company tentatively named &quot;New Fox&quot;. The acquisition closed on March 20, 2019, for an increased cash-and-stock offer of $71.3 billion; the assets that were not acquired by Disney, including the Fox Broadcasting Company, were spun-off into Fox Corporation.

<doc id="206216" wikidata="Q19338" url="?curid=206216" title="Pelecaniformes">
<text>The Pelecaniformes are an order of medium-sized and large waterbirds found worldwide. As traditionally—but erroneously—defined, they encompass all birds that have feet with all four toes webbed. Hence, they were formerly also known by such names as totipalmates or steganopodes. Most have a bare throat patch (gular patch), and the nostrils have evolved into dysfunctional slits, forcing them to breathe through their mouths. They also have a pectinate nail on their longest toe. This is shaped like a comb and is used to brush out and separate their feathers. They feed on fish, squid, or similar marine life. Nesting is colonial, but individual birds are monogamous. The young are altricial, hatching from the egg helpless and naked in most. They lack a brood patch.

The pelicans, shoebill and hamerkop form a clade within the order (suborder Pelecani). The relationships between Pelecani, herons (Ardeidae) and ibises and spoonbills (Threskiornithidae) are unclear. The Fregatidae (frigatebirds), Sulidae (gannets and boobies), Phalacrocoracidae (cormorants and shags), Anhingidae (darters), and Phaethontidae (tropicbirds) were traditionally placed in the Pelecaniformes, but molecular and morphological studies indicate they are not such close relatives. They have been placed in their own orders, Suliformes and Phaethontiformes, respectively.

==Systematics and evolution==
Classically, bird relationships were based solely on morphological characteristics. The Pelecaniformes were traditionally, but erroneously, defined as birds that have feet with all four toes webbed (totipalmate), as opposed to all other birds with webbed feet where only three of four were webbed. Hence, they were formerly also known by such names as totipalmates or steganopodes. The group included frigatebirds, gannets, cormorants, anhingas, and tropicbirds.

Sibley and Ahlquist&#x27;s landmark DNA-DNA hybridisation studies (see Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy) led to them placing the families traditionally contained within the Pelecaniformes together with the grebes, cormorants, ibises and spoonbills, New World vultures, storks, penguins, albatrosses, petrels, and loons together as a subgroup within a greatly expanded order Ciconiiformes, a radical move which by now has been all but rejected: their &quot;Ciconiiformes&quot; merely assembled all early advanced land- and seabirds for which their research technique delivered insufficient phylogenetic resolution.

Morphological study has suggested pelicans are sister to a gannet-cormorant clade, yet genetic analysis groups them with the hamerkop and shoebill, though the exact relationship between the three is unclear. Mounting evidence pointed to the shoebill as a close relative of pelicans. This also included microscopic analysis of eggshell structure by Konstantin Mikhailov in 1995, who found that the shells of pelecaniform eggs (including those of the shoebill but not the tropicbirds) were covered in a thick microglobular material. Reviewing genetic evidence to date, Cracraft and colleagues surmised that pelicans were sister to the shoebill with the hamerkop as the next earlier offshoot. Ericson and colleagues sampled five nuclear genes in a 2006 study spanning the breadth of bird lineages, and came up with pelicans, shoebill and hamerkop in a clade. Hackett and colleagues sampled 32 kilobases of nuclear DNA and recovered shoebill and hamerkop as sister taxa, pelicans sister to them, and herons and ibises as sister groups to each other, with the heron and ibis group a sister to the pelican/shoebill/hamerkop clade.

The current International Ornithological Committee classification has pelicans grouped with the shoebill (Balaenicipitidae), hamerkop (Scopidae), ibises and spoonbills (Threskiornithidae), and herons, egrets and bitterns (Ardeidae). The IOC considers Threskiornithidae and Ardeidae to from a clade, citing Hackett et al. 2008 (). 

Another hypothesis is that Threskiornithidae is sister to the rest of Pelecaniformes, and Ardeidae and Pelecani form a clade. 

Recent research strongly suggests that the similarities between the Pelecaniformes as traditionally defined are the result of convergent evolution rather than common descent, and that the group is polyphyletic. All families in the traditional Pelecaniformes except the Phalacrocoracidae have only a few handfuls of species at most, but many were more numerous in the Early Neogene. Fossil genera and species are discussed in the respective family or genus accounts; one little-known prehistoric Pelecaniforms, however, cannot be classified accurately enough to assign them to a family. This is &quot;&quot;Sula&quot; ronzoni&quot; from Early Oligocene rocks at Ronzon, France, which was initially believed to be a sea-duck and possibly is an ancestral Pelecaniform.

The pelecaniform lineages appear to have originated around the end of the Cretaceous. Monophyletic or not, they appear to belong to a close-knit group of &quot;higher waterbirds&quot; which also includes groups such as penguins and Procellariiformes. Quite a lot of fossil bones from around the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary cannot be firmly placed with any of these orders and rather combine traits of several of them. This is, of course, only to be expected, if the theory that most if not all of these &quot;higher waterbird&quot; lineages originated around that time is correct. Of those apparently basal taxa, the following show some similarities to the traditional Pelecaniformes:

* &quot;Lonchodytes&quot; (Lance Creek Late Cretaceous of Wyoming, US)
* &quot;Torotix&quot; (Late Cretaceous)
* &quot;Tytthostonyx&quot; (Late Cretaceous/Early Palaeocene)
* &quot;Cladornis&quot; (Deseado Early Oligocene of Patagonia, Argentina)
* &quot;Liptornis&quot;—a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;

The proposed Elopterygidae—supposedly a family of Cretaceous Pelecaniformes—are neither monophyletic nor does &quot;Elopteryx&quot; appear to be a modern bird.

<text>SMART-1 was a European Space Agency satellite that orbited the Moon. It was launched on 27 September 2003 at 23:14 UTC from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. &quot;SMART-1&quot; stands for Small Missions for Advanced Research in Technology-1. On 3 September 2006 (05:42 UTC), SMART-1 was deliberately crashed into the Moon&#x27;s surface, ending its mission.

==Spacecraft design==
SMART-1 was about one meter across (3.3 ft), and lightweight in comparison to other probes. Its launch mass was 367 kg or 809 pounds, of which 287 kg (633 lb) was non-propellant.

It was propelled by a solar-powered Hall-effect thruster (Snecma PPS-1350-G) using 82 kg of xenon gas contained in a 50 litres tank at a pressure of 150 bar at launch. The ion engine thruster used an electrostatic field to ionize the xenon and accelerate the ions achieving a specific impulse of 16.1 kN·s/kg (1,640 seconds), more than three times the maximum for chemical rockets. One kg of propellant (1/350 to 1/300 of the total mass of the spacecraft) produced a delta-v of about 45 m/s. The electric propulsion subsystem weighted 29 kg with a peak power consumption of 1,200 watts. SMART-1 was the first in the program of ESA&#x27;s Small Missions for Advanced Research and Technology.

The solar arrays made capable of 1850 W at the beginning of the mission, were able to provide the maximum set of 1,190 W to the thruster, giving a nominal thrust of 68 mN, hence an acceleration of 0.2 mm/s2 or 0.7 m/s per hour (i.e., just under 0.00002 &quot;g&quot; of acceleration). As with all ion-engine powered craft, orbital maneuvers were not carried out in short bursts but very gradually. The particular trajectory taken by SMART-1 to the Moon required thrusting for about one third to one half of every orbit. When spiraling away from the Earth thrusting was done on the perigee part of the orbit. At the end of the mission, the thruster had demonstrated the following capability:

* Thruster operating time: 5000 h
* Xenon throughput: 82 kg
* Total Impulse: 1.2 MN-s
* Total ΔV: 3.9 km/s

As part of the European Space Agency&#x27;s strategy to build very inexpensive and relatively small spaceships, the total cost of SMART-1 was a relatively small 110 million euros (about 170 million U.S. dollars). SMART-1 was designed and developed by the Swedish Space Corporation on behalf of ESA. Assembly of the spacecraft was carried out by Saab Space in Linköping. Tests of the spacecraft were directed by Swedish Space Corporation and executed by Saab Space. The project manager at ESA was Giuseppe Racca until the spacecraft achieved the moon operational orbit. He was then replaced by Gerhard Schwehm for the Science phase. The project manager at the Swedish Space Corporation was Peter Rathsman. The Principal Project Scientist was Bernard Foing. The Ground Segment Manager during the preparation phase was Mike McKay and the Spacecraft Operations manager was Octavio Camino.

==Instruments==

===AMIE===
The Advanced Moon micro-Imager Experiment was a miniature colour camera for lunar imaging. The CCD camera with three filters of 750, 900 and 950 nm was able to take images with an average pixel resolution of 80 m (about 260 ft). The camera weighed 2.1 kg (about 4.5 lb) and had a power consumption of 9 watts.

===D-CIXS===
The Demonstration of a Compact X-ray Spectrometer was an X-ray telescope for the identification of chemical elements on the lunar surface. It detected the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) of crystal compounds created through the interaction of the electron shell with the solar wind particles to measure the abundance of the three main components: magnesium, silicon and aluminium. The detection of iron, calcium and titanium depended on the solar activity. The detection range for X-rays was 0.5 to 10 keV. The spectrometer and XSM (described below) together weighed 5.2 kg and had a power consumption of 18 watts.

===XSM===
The X-ray solar monitor studied the solar variability to complement D-CIXS measurements.

===SIR===
The Smart-1 Infrared Spectrometer was an infrared spectrometer for the identification of mineral spectra of olivine and pyroxene. It detected wavelengths from 0.93 to 2.4 μm with 256 channels. The package weighed 2.3 kg and had a power consumption of 4.1 watts.

===EPDP===
The Electric Propulsion Diagnostic Package was to acquire data on the new propulsion system on SMART-1. The package weighed 0.8 kg and had a power consumption of 1.8 watts.

===SPEDE===
The Spacecraft Potential, Electron and Dust Experiment. The experiment weighed 0.8 kg and had a power consumption of 1.8 watts. Its function was to measure the properties and density of the plasma around the spacecraft, either as a Langmuir probe or as an electric field probe. SPEDE observed the emission of the spacecraft&#x27;s ion engine and the &quot;wake&quot; the Moon leaves to the solar wind. Unlike most other instruments that have to be shut down to prevent damage, SPEDE could keep measuring inside radiation belts and in solar storms, such as the Halloween 2003 solar storms. It was built by Finnish Meteorological Institute and its name was intentionally chosen so that its acronym is the same as the nickname of Spede Pasanen, a famous Finnish movie actor, movie producer, and inventor. The algorithms developed for SPEDE were later used in the ESA lander Philae.

===KATE===
Ka band TT&amp;C (telemetry, tracking and control) Experiment. The experiment weighed 6.2 kg and had a power consumption of 26 watts. The Ka-band transponder was designed as precursor for BepiColombo to perform radio science investigations and to monitor the dynamical performance of the electric propulsion system.

==Flight==

SMART-1 was launched 27 September 2003 together with Insat 3E and eBird 1, by an Ariane 5 rocket from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. After 42 minutes it was released into a geostationary transfer orbit of 7,035 × 42,223 km. From there it used its Solar Electric Primary Propulsion (SEPP) to gradually spiral out during thirteen months.

The orbit can be seen up to 26 October 2004 at spaceref.com, when the orbit was 179,718 × 305,214 km. On that date, after the 289th engine pulse, the SEPP had accumulated a total on-time of nearly 3,648 hours out of a total flight time of 8,000 hours, hence a little less than half of its total mission. It consumed about 58.8 kg of xenon and produced a delta-v of 2,737 m/s (46.5 m/s per kg xenon, 0.75 m/s per hour on-time). It was powered on again on 15 November for a planned burn of 4.5 days to enter fully into lunar orbit. It took until February 2005 using the electric thruster to decelerate into the final orbit 300–3,000 km above the Moon&#x27;s surface. The end of mission performance demonstrated by the propulsion system is stated above.
After its last perigee on 2 November, on 11 November 2004 it passed through the Earth-Moon L1 Lagrangian Point and into the area dominated by the Moon&#x27;s gravitational influence, and at 1748 UT on 15 November passed the first periselene of its lunar orbit. The osculating orbit on that date was 6,704 × 53,208 km, with an orbital period of 129 hours, although the actual orbit was accomplished in only 89 hours. This illustrates the significant impact that the engine burns have on the orbit and marks the meaning of the osculating orbit, which is the orbit that would be travelled by the spacecraft if at that instant all perturbations, including thrust, would cease.
ESA announced on 15 February 2005 an extension of the mission of &quot;SMART-1&quot; by one year until August 2006. This date was later shifted to 3 September 2006 to enable further scientific observations from Earth.

===Lunar impact===

SMART-1 impacted the Moon&#x27;s surface, as planned, on 3 September 2006 at 05:42:22 UTC, ending its mission. Moving at approximately 2,000 m/s (4,500 mph), SMART-1 created an impact visible with ground telescopes from Earth. It is hoped that not only will this provide some data simulating a meteor impact, but also that it might expose materials in the ground, like water ice, to spectroscopic analysis.

ESA originally estimated that impact occurred at . In 2017, the impact site was identified from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter data at . At the time of impact, the Moon was visible in North and South America, and places in the Pacific Ocean, but not Europe, Africa, or western Asia.

This project has generated data and know-how that will be used for other missions, such as the ESA&#x27;s BepiColombo mission to Mercury.

== Smart-1 Ground Segment and Operations ==

Smart-1 operations were conducted from the ESA European Space Operations Center ESOC in Darmstadt Germany led by the Spacecraft Operations Manager Octavio Camino.

The ground segment of Smart-1 was a good example of infrastructure reuse at ESA: Flight Dynamics infrastructure and Data distribution System (DDS) from Rosetta, Mars Express and Venus Express. The generic mission control system software SCOS 2000, and a set of generic interface elements use at ESA for the operations of their missions.

The use of CCSDS TLM and TC standards permitted a cost effective tailoring of seven different terminals of the ESA Tracking network (ESTRACK) plus Weilheim in Germany (DLR).

The components that were developed specifically for Smart-1 were: the simulator; a mix of hardware and software derived from the Electrical Ground Support Equipment EGSE equipment, the Mission Planning System and the Automation System developed from MOIS (this last based on a prototype implemented for Envisat) and a suite of engineering tools called MUST. This last permitted the Smart-1 engineers to do anomaly investigation through internet, pioneering at ESA monitoring of spacecraft TLM using mobile phones and PDAs and receiving spacecraft alarms via SMS.
The Mission Control Team was composed of seven engineers in the Flight Control Team (FCT), a variable group between 2–5 Flight Dynamics engineers and 1–2 Data Systems engineers. Unlike most ESA missions, there were no Spacecraft Controllers (SPACONs), and all operations and mission-planning activities were done by the FCT. This concept originated overtime and night shifts during the first months of the mission but worked well during the cruise and the Moon phases.
The major concern during the first three months of the mission was to leave the radiation belts as soon as possible in order to minimize the degradation of the solar arrays and the star tracker CCDs.

The first and most critical problem came after the first revolution when a failure in the onboard Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) algorithm triggered an autonomous switch to the redundant computer in every orbit causing several reboots, finding the spacecraft in SAFE mode after every pericenter passage. The analysis of the spacecraft telemetry pointed directly to a radiation-triggered problem with the EDAC interrupt routine.

Other anomalies during this period were a combination of environmental problems: high radiation doses, especially in the star trackers and onboard software anomalies: the Reed Solomon encoding became corrupt after switching data rates and had to be disabled. It was overcome by procedures and changes on ground operations approach.
The star trackers were also subject of frequent hiccups during the earth escape and caused some of the Electric Propulsion (EP) interruptions. They were all resolved with several software patches.

The EP showed sensitivity to radiation inducing shutdowns. This phenomenon identified as the Opto-coupler Single Event Transient (OSET), initially seen in LEOP during the first firing using cathode B, was characterized by a rapid drop in Anode Current triggering the alarm &#x27;Flame Out&#x27; bit causing the shutdown of the EP. The problem was identified to be radiation induced Opto-coupler sensitivity. The recovery of such events was to restart the thruster. This was manually done during several months until an On Board Software Patch (OBSW) was developed to detect it and initiate an autonomous thruster restart. Its impact was limited to the orbit prediction calculation used for the Ground Stations to track the spacecraft and the subsequent orbit corrections.

The different kind of anomalies and the frequent interruptions in the thrust of the Electric Propulsion led to an increase of the ground stations support and overtime of the flight operations team who had to react quickly. Their recovery was sometimes time consuming, especially when the spacecraft was found in SAFE mode. Overall, they impeded to run the operations as originally planned having one 8 hours pass every 4 days.

The mission negotiated the use the ESTRACK network spare capacity. This concept permitted about eight times additional network coverage at no extra cost but originated unexpected overheads and conflicts. It ultimately permitted additional contacts with the spacecraft during the early stage of the mission and an important increase of science during the Moon phase. This phase required a major reconfiguration of the on-board stores and its operation. This change designed by the flight control team at ESOC and implemented by the Swedish Space Corporation in a short time required to re-write part of the Flight Control Procedures FOP for the operations at the Moon.

The Operations during the Moon phase become highly automated: the flight dynamics pointing was &quot;menu driven&quot; allowing more than 98% of commanding being generated by the Mission Planning System MPS. The extension of the MPS system with the so called MOIS Executor, became the Smart-1 automation system. It permitted to operate 70% of the passes unmanned towards the end of the mission and allowed the validation of the first operational &quot;spacecraft automation system&quot; at ESA.

The mission achieved all its objectives: getting out of the radiation belts influence 3 months after launch, spiraling out during 11 months and being captured by the Moon using resonances, the commissioning and operations of all instruments during the cruise phase and the optimization of the navigation and operational procedures required for Electric Propulsion operation. The efficient operations of the Electric Propulsion at the Moon allowed the reduction of the orbital radius benefiting the scientific operations and extending this mission by one extra year.

A detailed chronology of the operations events is provided in ref.

<text>Brigadier general or brigade general is a military rank used in many countries. The rank is usually above a colonel, and below a major general or divisional general. When appointed to a field command, a brigadier general is typically in command of a brigade consisting of around 4,000 troops (two regiments or four battalions).

==Variants==
===Brigadier general===
Brigadier general (Brig. Gen.) is a military rank used in many countries. The rank originates from the Old European System. It is the lowest ranking general officer in some countries, usually sitting between the ranks of colonel and major general. When appointed to a field command, a brigadier general is typically in command of a brigade consisting of around 4,000 troops (four battalions).

In some countries, this rank is given the name of &quot;brigadier&quot;, which is usually equivalent to &quot;brigadier general&quot; in the armies of nations that use the rank.

The rank can be traced back to the militaries of Europe where a &quot;brigadier general&quot;, or simply a &quot;brigadier&quot;, would command a brigade in the field.

In the first quarter of the 20th century, British and Commonwealth armies used the rank of brigadier general as a temporary appointment, or as an honorary appointment on retirement; in the 1920s this practice changed to the use of brigadier, which was not classed as a general officer.

===Brigade general===
Brigade general is the rank of a brigade commander in countries where the French Revolutionary System&#x27;s general officer rank designation is used.

The rank name () was first used in the French revolutionary armies.

It used both brigadier general and major general because it is used for the designated rank of the general officers that the country stipulates as brigade commanders&#x27; class by law.

==By country==
===Argentina===
The rank of brigadier general (with some local variations) is used in the Argentine Air Force. Unlike other armed forces of the World, the rank of &quot;brigadier general&quot; is actually the &quot;highest&quot; rank in the Air Force. This is due to the use of the rank of &quot;brigadier&quot; and its derivatives to designate all general officers in the Air Force: brigadier (lowest general officer); brigadier-major (middle); and brigadier-general (highest). The rank of brigadier general is reserved for the Chief General Staff of the Air Force, as well as the Chief of the Joint General Staff if he should be an Air Force officer.

The Argentine Army does not use the rank of brigadier-general, instead using brigade general () which in turn is the lowest general officer before Divisional General () and Lieutenant General ().

===Australia===

In the Australian Imperial Force during World War I, the rank of brigadier general was always temporary and held only while the officer was posted to a particular task, typically the command of a brigade. (Until 1915, Australian brigades were commanded by colonels.) When posted elsewhere, the rank would be relinquished and the former rank resumed. This policy prevented an accumulation of high-ranking general officers brought about by the relatively high turnover of brigade commanders. &quot;Brigadier general&quot; was also used as an honorary rank on retirement.

The rank insignia was like that of the current major general, but without the star/pip. Brigadier generals wore the same gorget patches (a line of gold oak leaf embroidery down the centre), cap badge (crossed sword and baton within a laurel wreath, surmounted by a crown in gold embroidery) and cap visor (two rows of gold oakleaf embroidery) as other generals.

As in the United Kingdom, the rank was later replaced by colonel commandant in 1922 and brigadier in 1928. However, those holding the rank of brigadier general continued to do so throughout the inter-war period, until the last of them retired or was promoted during the Second World War. A brigadier general was a general officer, but brigadiers were not generals, which is shown by the rank insignia being like that of a colonel, but with an extra (third) star/pip, and a brigadier wore the same gorget patches (scarlet cloth with a line of crimson gimp), cap badge (the Royal Crest in gold embroidery), and cap visor (one row of gold oakleaf embroidery) as a colonel.

===Bangladesh===

Prior to 2001, the Bangladesh Army rank was known as &quot;brigadier&quot;, in conformity with the rank structure of the Commonwealth Nations. In 2001, the Bangladesh Army rechristened the rank to brigadier general. It is the lowest flag officer order and classify as a &quot;one-star rank&quot;. Brigadier general is equivalent to commodore of the Bangladesh Navy and air commodore of the Bangladesh Air Force.

===Belgium===
The Belgian Army uses the rank of (French) and (Dutch, &#x27;brigade general&#x27;). However, in this small military there are no permanent promotions to this rank, and it is only awarded as a temporary promotion to a full colonel who assumes a post requiring the rank, notably in an international context (e.g. as military attaché in a major embassy).

===Brazil===

 (Brigade general) is the lowest rank amongst general officers of the Brazilian Army; i.e. like in most British Commonwealth countries, the lowest general officer rank is a two-star rank, and a &quot;General de Brigada&quot; wears a two-star insignia. Hence, it is equivalent to the major general rank of many countries. In the Brazilian Air Force, all of the senior ranks include &#x27;Brigadeiro&#x27;; the two-star rank is &quot;Brigadeiro&quot; (Brigadier), the three-star rank is &quot;Major-Brigadeiro&quot; (Major-Brigadier), and the four-star rank is &quot;Tenente-Brigadeiro-do-Ar&quot; (Lieutenant-Air-Brigadier).

===Canada===
In the Canadian Forces, the rank of brigadier-general (BGen) ( or in French) is a rank for members who wear army or air force uniform, equal to a commodore for those in navy uniform. A brigadier-general is the lowest rank of general officer. A brigadier-general is senior to a colonel or naval captain, and junior to a major-general or rear-admiral.

The rank title &quot;brigadier-general&quot; is still used notwithstanding that brigades in the army are now commanded by colonels. Until the late 1990s brigades were commanded by brigadier-generals. In the air force context, brigadier-generals used to command air force groups until these bodies were abolished in the late 1990s.

The rank insignia for a brigadier-general on air force uniforms is a single wide braid on the cuff, as well as a single silver maple leaf beneath crossed sabre and baton, all surmounted by St. Edward&#x27;s Crown, worn on the shoulder straps of the service dress jacket, and on slip-ons on other uniforms. The rank insignia on army uniforms is a gold maple leaf beneath crossed sword and baton, all surmounted by St. Edward&#x27;s Crown, on the shoulder straps. On the visor of the service cap are two rows of gold oak leaves; the air force wedge cap features silver braid on the edges of the ear flaps. The cap insignia for a general officer is a modified version of the Canadian Forces insignia. Army brigadier-generals wear gorget patches on the collar of the service uniform tunic.

Brigadier-generals are initially addressed verbally as &quot;General&quot; and name; thereafter by subordinates as &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot; in English or &quot;&quot; in French. They are normally entitled to staff cars.

Until unification in 1968 of the Royal Canadian Air Force, Canadian Army, and the Royal Canadian Navy, rank structure and insignia followed the British pattern. This system of rank insignia was reinstated in 2013, but general officers reverted to the 1968 system in 2016. In army usage, the term &quot;brigadier&quot; was used to denote what is now known as a brigadier-general while the air force used the rank of air commodore.

===Chile===
In the Chilean Army, is a one-star rank and is the immediately superior two-star rank. While the Chilean Air Force uses for its one-star rank, two-star Air Force officers hold the rank of literally &#x27;air brigade general&#x27;.

===Colombia===
The rank of brigadier general was established in 1953 by decree 1325 on the 21st of May. With this decree, the ranks of lieutenant general and general were replaced by brigadier general and lieutenant general establishing brigadier as the first grade for generals. In the 60s these ranks were reformed once again creating a third rank, brigadier general, Major general, and general in the &quot;Fuerzas Militares&quot;, and the National Police.

===France===

France uses the rank of &quot;brigade general&quot; (). The rank contrasts with the French sub-officer rank of . As with all French general officers, a French brigade general is titled &quot;general&quot; without any implication that he is an army general; for instance General Charles de Gaulle never rose higher than brigade general.

Until 1793, the rank of (&quot;brigadier of the armies&quot;) existed in the French Army, which could be described as a senior colonel or junior brigade commander. The normal brigade command rank was (literally &quot;camp marshal&quot;). When rank insignia were introduced, wore one star and a wore two stars. During the French Revolution, the revolutionaries&#x27; drive to rationalise the state led to a change in the system of ranks. The rank of was abolished and the normal brigade command rank, , was replaced by brigade general. The rank of brigade general inherited the two stars of the rank of , explaining the absence since 1793 of a French rank with only one star. For this reason, in France, the rank corresponding to brigade general was changed to brigadier general after NATO was established on April 4, 1949, and before that, it corresponded to major general.

Nowadays, a French generally commands a brigade. The rank can also be awarded in an honorary fashion to retiring colonels. The insignia are two stars, worn on the shoulder or at the sleeve of the uniform, depending on the order of dress. Two different kepis are issued: the service kepi sports the two stars, while the formal kepi features a large band of oak leaves (the kepi of a division general has two smaller such bands).

Charles de Gaulle held the rank of brigade general. He was given a temporary promotion to this rank in May 1940 as commander of the 4th Armoured Division (). However his initial authority as head of the Free French really came from being the only cabinet member (Under-Secretary of State for National Defence and War) outside occupied France, not from his military rank. As a reminder of his war position, he refused any further promotion.

===Ireland===
The country is divided into two areas for administrative and operational reasons, and in each area there is an infantry brigade. The two brigade group structure envisages distinct operational areas of responsibility for each of the brigades and is supported in its responsibilities by the Naval Service and Air Corps. Each of the brigade formations and the Air Corps is commanded by a brigadier general, while the Naval Service is commanded by a commodore.

===Italy===
In the Italian Armed Forces the rank has different denominations. In the Army, the rank for combat arms officers is whilst for the logistics and technical corps is called . In 1926, the and were merged and renamed with their current rank designation.The rank is also present in the other armed forces, police corps and other services of Italy, with different denominations, and it is associated with the lowest level within the government top management.

===Mexico===

Within the Mexican Armed Forces, there exists two grades of brigadier general. The lowest general officer is , with the second lowest being . The general officer rank higher than the two brigadier generals is Divisional general.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, Brigadier General (Philippine Army Philippine Air Force and Philippine Marines)/ Commodore (Philippine Navy and Philippine Coast Guard)/ Chief Superintendent (Bureau of Fire Protection and Bureau of Jail Management and Penology) / Police Brigadier General &quot;(Chief Superintendent before)&quot; (Philippine National Police) / Gial De Brigada &quot;(1890–1902)&quot; (Philippine Revolutionary Army) is the lowest rank of generals but already eligible in the promotion to become &quot;Chief of Staff&quot; of the Armed Forces of the Philippines or &quot;PNP Chief&quot; of the Philippine National Police surpassing the Major General and Lieutenant General ranks.

===Poland===
 (literally, &quot;general of a brigade&quot;, abbreviated &quot;gen. bryg.&quot;) is the lowest-ranking general in the Polish Land Forces and Air Force.

===Portugal===
In the Portuguese Army and Air Force, &quot;brigadeiro-general&quot; is a temporary general rank for the colonels that have to exercise a special command. It is the equivalent of the commodore rank in the Portuguese Navy.

The rank was reintroduced in 1999. Before that, simply as &quot;brigadeiro&quot;, it existed from 1707 to 1864 and again from 1929 to 1947, not being considered a general rank. From 1947 to 1999, &quot;brigadeiro&quot; become the two-star general rank in the Portuguese Army. As two-star rank, it was substituted by the rank of major-general in 1999.

===Spain===

===Turkey===
In the Turkish Army and the Turkish Air Force, the equivalent rank is (the Turkish Navy equivalent is ). The name is derived from , the Turkish word for a brigade. Both and - as military terms may owe their origins to the older Turkish word , meaning horsetail, which was used as a symbol of authority and rank in Ottoman and pre-Ottoman times.

===United Kingdom===

Brigadier-general was formerly a rank or appointment in the British Army and Royal Marines, and briefly in the Royal Air Force. The appointment was abolished in the Army and the Marines in 1921; the equivalent rank today is Brigadier.
