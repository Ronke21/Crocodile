<text>Shema Yisrael (Shema Israel or Sh&#x27;ma Yisrael; , “Hear, O Israel”) is a Jewish prayer (known as the Shema) that serves as a centerpiece of the morning and evening Jewish prayer services. Its first verse encapsulates the monotheistic essence of Judaism: &quot;Hear, O Israel: YHWH our God, YHWH is one&quot; (), found in .

The first part can be translated as either &quot;The our God&quot; or &quot;The is our God&quot;, and the second part as either &quot;the is one&quot; or as &quot;the one &quot; (in the sense of &quot;the alone&quot;), since Hebrew does not normally use a copula in the present tense, so translators must decide by inference whether one is appropriate in English. The word used for &quot;the &quot; is the tetragrammaton YHWH.

Observant Jews consider the &quot;Shema&quot; to be the most important part of the prayer service in Judaism, and its twice-daily recitation as a &quot;mitzvah&quot; (religious commandment). Also, it is traditional for Jews to say the &quot;Shema&quot; as their last words, and for parents to teach their children to say it before they go to sleep at night.

The term &quot;Shema&quot; is used by extension to refer to the whole part of the daily prayers that commences with &quot;Shema Yisrael&quot; and comprises Deuteronomy , , and Numbers . These sections of the Torah are read in the weekly Torah portions &quot;Va&#x27;etchanan&quot;, &quot;Eikev&quot;, and &quot;Shlach&quot;, respectively.

==History==
The recitation of the &quot;Shema&quot; in the liturgy consists of three portions: , , and Numbers . The three portions are mentioned in the Mishnah (Berachot 2:2). The three portions relate to central issues of Jewish belief. In the Mishnah (Berakhot 2:5) the reciting of the &quot;shema&quot; was linked with re-affirming a personal relationship with God&#x27;s rule. Literally, reciting the &quot;shema&quot; was stated as &quot;receiving the kingdom of heaven.&quot; [&quot;Heaven&quot; is a metaphor for God. The best texts of the Mishnah, Kaufmann and Parma, do not have the addition &quot;yoke&quot; that is found in later printed Mishnahs: &quot;receive the {yoke of the} kingdom of Heaven.&quot; The original statement appears to have been &quot;to receive the kingdom of Heaven&quot;.]

Additionally, the Talmud points out that subtle references to the Ten Commandments can be found in the three portions. As the Ten Commandments were removed from daily prayer in the Mishnaic period (70–200 CE), the &quot;Shema&quot; is seen as an opportunity to commemorate the Ten Commandments.

There are two larger-print letters in the first sentence (&#x27;ayin and daleth ) which, when combined, spell &quot;&quot;. In Hebrew this means &quot;witness&quot;. The idea thus conveyed is that through the recitation or proclamation of the &quot;Shema&quot; one is a living witness testifying to the truth of its message. Modern Kabbalistic schools, namely that of the Ari, teach that when one recites the last letter of the word &quot;eḥad&quot; (), meaning &quot;one&quot;, he is to intend that he is ready to &quot;die into God&quot;.

==Content==

===&quot;Shema Yisrael&quot;===

The first, pivotal words of the &quot;Shema&quot; are:

Rabbinic Judaism teaches that the Tetragrammaton (י-ה-ו-ה), YHWH, is the ineffable and actual name of God, and as such is not read aloud in the &quot;Shema&quot; but is traditionally replaced with אדני, Adonai (&quot;&quot;). For that reason, the &quot;Shema&quot; is recited aloud as &quot;Sh&#x27;ma Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Eḥad&quot; (&quot;Hear, O Israel: the is our God, the is One.&quot;)

The literal word meanings are roughly as follows:
: &quot;Sh&#x27;ma&quot;: literally means &quot;listen&quot;, &quot;heed&quot;, or &quot;hear and do&quot; (according to the Targum, &quot;accept&quot;)
: &quot;Yisrael&quot;: Israel, in the sense of the people or congregation of Israel
: &quot;Adonai&quot;: often translated as &quot;&quot;, it is read in place of the YHWH written in the Hebrew text; Samaritans say Shema, which is Aramaic for &quot;the [Divine] Name&quot; and is the exact equivalent of the Hebrew &quot;ha-Shem&quot;, which Rabbinic Jews substitute for Adonai in a non-liturgical context such as everyday speech.
: &quot;Eloheinu&quot;: the 1st person plural possessive of &quot;Elohim&quot;, meaning &quot;our God&quot;.
: &quot;Echad&quot;: the unified and cardinal number &quot;One&quot; 

This first verse of the &quot;Shema&quot; relates to the kingship of God. The first verse, &quot;Hear, O Israel: the our God is One &quot;, has always been regarded as the confession of belief in the One God. Due to the ambiguity of the possible ways to translate the Hebrew passage, there are several possible renderings:
: &quot;Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God! The Lord is One!&quot;, and
: &quot;Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God – The Lord alone.&quot;

Many commentaries have been written about the subtle differences between the translations. There is an emphasis on the oneness of God and on the sole worship of God by Israel. There are other translations, though most retain one or the other emphases.

===&quot;Baruch Shem&quot;===

The second line is a rabbinic addition and is recited silently during congregational worship (except on Yom Kippur, when it is recited aloud). In Reform Judaism, it is recited aloud, but in a quieter voice than the rest of the prayer. It was originally a liturgical response in use in the Temple when the name of God was pronounced and took the form of &quot;Baruch shem k’vod l’olam&quot;, &quot;Blessed be his glorious name forever&quot; (Psalm 72:19). However, in time the words &quot;malchuto&quot; (&quot;His kingdom&quot;) and &quot;va’ed&quot; (&quot;for ever and ever&quot;) were added. &quot;Malchuto&quot; was introduced by the rabbis during Roman rule as a counter to the claim of divine honors by Roman emperors. &quot;Va’ed&quot; was introduced at the time of the Second Temple to contrast the view of the &quot;minim&quot; (heretics) that there is no life after death.

===&quot;V&#x27;ahavta&quot;===
The following verses are commonly referred to as the V&#x27;ahavta, reflecting the first word of the verse immediately following the &quot;Shema&quot;, or in Classical Hebrew &quot;V&#x27;ahav&#x27;ta&quot;, meaning &quot;and you shall love...&quot;. These words contain the command to love God with all one&#x27;s heart, soul, and might (). The Talmud emphasizes that you will, at some point, whether you choose to or not, and therefore uses &quot;shall&quot; – future tense – love God.

Then verse 7 goes on to remind the community to remember all the commandments and to &quot;teach them diligently to your children and speak of them when you sit down and when you walk, when you lie down and when you rise&quot;, to recite the words of God when retiring or rising; to bind those words &quot;on thy arm and thy head&quot; (classically Jewish oral tradition interprets as &quot;tefillin&quot;), and to &quot;inscribe them on the door-posts of your house and on your gates&quot; (referring to &quot;mezuzah&quot;).

===&quot;V&#x27;haya im shamoa&quot;===
The passage following the &quot;Shema&quot; and &quot;V&#x27;ahavta&quot; relates to the issue of reward and punishment. It contains the promise of reward for serving God with all one&#x27;s heart, soul, and might (Deut 11:13) and for the fulfillment of the laws. It also contains punishment for transgression, largely relating to harvest resources and being expelled from the land of Israel. It also contains a repetition of the contents of the first portion - but this time spoken to the second person plural, whereas the first portion is directed to the individual, this time it is directed to the whole community.

===&quot;Vayomer&quot;===
The third portion relates to the issue of redemption. Specifically, it contains the law concerning the tzitzit (Numbers 15:37-41) as a reminder that all laws of God are obeyed, as a warning against following evil inclinations and in remembrance of the exodus from Egypt. For the prophets and rabbis, the exodus from Egypt is paradigmatic of Jewish faith that God redeems from all forms of foreign domination. It can be found in the portion Shlach-Lecha in the Book of Numbers.

===Summary===
In summary, the content flows from the assertion of the oneness of God&#x27;s kingship. Thus, in the first portion, there is a command to love God with all one&#x27;s heart, soul, and might, and to remember and teach these very important words to the children throughout the day. Obeying these commands, says the second portion, will lead to rewards, and disobeying them will lead to punishment. The Shema reminds the Jewish people to be true to their covenant as failing to do so will lead to their expulsion from their land. To ensure fulfillment of these key commands, God also commands in the third portion a practical reminder, wearing the &quot;tzitzit&quot;, &quot;that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.&quot;

The second line quoted, &quot;Blessed be the Name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever&quot;, was originally a congregational response to the declaration of the Oneness of God; it is therefore often printed in small font and recited in an undertone, as recognition that it is not, itself, a part of the cited biblical verses. The third section of the &quot;Shema&quot; ends with Numbers 15:41, but traditional Jews end the recitation of the &quot;Shema&quot; by reciting the first word of the following blessing, &quot;Emet&quot;, or &quot;Truth&quot; without interruption.

==Jewish women and the Shema==

In Orthodox Judaism, women are not required to daily recite the &quot;Shema&quot; (as a command from the Torah), as with other time-bound requirements which might impinge on their traditional familial obligations, although they are obligated to pray at least once daily without a specific liturgy requirement.

Conservative Judaism generally regards Jewish women as being obligated to recite the &quot;Shema&quot; at the same times as men.

Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism do not regard gender-related traditional Jewish ritual requirements as necessary in modern circumstances, including obligations for men, but not women, to pray specific prayers at specific times. Instead, both genders may fulfill all requirements.

==Accompanying blessings==
The blessings preceding and following the &quot;Shema&quot; are traditionally credited to the members of the Great Assembly. They were first instituted in the liturgy of the Temple in Jerusalem.

According to the Talmud, the reading of the &quot;Shema&quot; morning and evening fulfills the commandment &quot;You shall meditate therein day and night&quot;. As soon as a child begins to speak, his father is directed to teach him the verse &quot;Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob&quot;, and teach him to read the &quot;Shema&quot;. The reciting of the first verse of the &quot;Shema&quot; is called &quot;the acceptance of the yoke of the kingship of God&quot; (&quot;kabalat ol malchut shamayim&quot;). Judah ha-Nasi, who spent all day involved with his studies and teaching, said just the first verse of the &quot;Shema&quot; in the morning &quot;as he passed his hands over his eyes&quot;, which appears to be the origin of the custom to cover the eyes with the right hand while reciting the first verse.

The first verse of the &quot;Shema&quot; is recited aloud, simultaneously by the hazzan and the congregation, which responds with the rabbinically instituted &quot;Baruch Shem&quot; (&quot;Blessed be the Name&quot;) in silence before continuing the rest of &quot;Shema&quot;. Only on Yom Kippur is this response said aloud. The remainder of the &quot;Shema&quot; is read in silence. Many Sephardim recite the whole of the &quot;Shema&quot; aloud, except the &quot;Baruch Shem&quot;, as well as the verse &quot;And God will be angry at you&quot; which many recite silently. Reform Jews also recite the whole of the first paragraph of the &quot;Shema&quot; aloud.

===Blessings===
During &quot;Shacharit&quot;, two blessings are recited before the &quot;Shema&quot; and one after the &quot;Shema&quot;. There is a question in Jewish law as to whether these blessings are &quot;on&quot; the &quot;Shema&quot;, or &quot;surrounding&quot; the &quot;Shema&quot;. The conclusion that has been drawn is that they are &quot;surrounding&quot; the &quot;Shema&quot;, because the structure is similar to that of blessings of the Torah, and there is doubt as to whether such blessings would actually &quot;enhance&quot; the &quot;Shema&quot;. The two blessings that are recited before the &quot;Shema&quot; are Yotzer ohr and Ahava Rabbah/Ahavat Olam. The blessing after is known as Emet Vayatziv.

During &quot;Maariv&quot;, there are two blessings before the &quot;Shema&quot; and two after. The two before are HaMaariv Aravim and Ahavat Olam. The two after are Emet V&#x27;Emunah and Hashkiveinu. Some communities add Baruch Hashem L&#x27;Olam on weekdays.

Overall, the three blessings in the morning and four in the evening which accompany the &quot;Shema&quot; sum to seven, in accordance with the verse in Psalms: &quot;I praise You seven times each day for Your just rules.&quot;

==Bedtime &quot;Shema&quot;==
Before going to sleep, the first paragraph of the &quot;Shema&quot; is recited. This is not only a commandment directly given in the Bible (in Deuteronomy 6:6–7), but is also alluded to from verses such as &quot;Commune with your own heart upon your bed&quot; (Psalms 4:5).

Some also have the custom to read all three paragraphs, along with a whole list of sections from Psalms, Vidui, and other prayers. Altogether this is known as the &quot;K&#x27;riat Shema she-al ha-mitah&quot; or Krias Shema Al Hamita (Hebrew: קריאת שמע על המטה, Bedtime Shema). According to Arizal, reading this prayer with great concentration is also effective in cleansing one from sin. This is discussed in the Tanya.

According to Rashi one fulfils his biblical obligation of the saying Shema in this prayer and not when he recites the Shema in the Maariv prayer, being that it was costumary to pray the Maariv prayer while still day (before the time of the obligation).

=== Source of the prayer ===
It says in the Talmud:
&quot;Even though one has recited the Shema prayer in the Synagogue, it is obligatory to recite it on his bed&quot;

Additionally it says:
&quot;One that goes to sleep on his bed says &#x27;Shema Yisrael&#x27; until &#x27;Vehaya Im Shamoa&#x27; and then says the blessing of &#x27;Hamapil&#x27;

=== Additions to the prayer ===
In the Babylonian Talmud the custom of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is brought that he used to add Psalm 91 and Psalm 3 (omitting the first verse) which are help against the demons.

As the generation unfolded additional Psalms, verses and prayers were added. Customs in this matter vary. Even though it is not obligatory to add Psalms it is generally expected to do so. 

The Rishonim argue whether one is to say the portion of &quot;Vehaya Im Shamoa&quot; and those who say one should also recite the third portion of Shema.

According to various customs, which are founded on the Arizal, the prayer also includes the confession prayer in order to confess and clean the sins of the past day. There are some customs which include Psalm 91, 51, and, 121. Additionally there are those that add the prayer of Ana b&#x27;Koach and Psalm 67.

Another common addition is &quot;In the name of the LORD God of Israel, at my right be Michael, and at my left be Gabriel, and before me Uriel, and behind me Raphael, and on my head the Presence of the LORD&quot;. Although close variants are known from the geonic period, a version of the prayer very similar to the one recited today appears in Machzor Vitry, before finding its way into the &quot;Zohar&quot; and modern prayerbooks.

==Other instances==
The exhortation by the Kohen in calling Israel to arms against an enemy (which does not apply when the Temple in Jerusalem is not standing) also includes &quot;Shema Yisrael&quot;.

According to the Talmud, Rabbi Akiva patiently endured while his flesh was being torn with iron combs, and died reciting the &quot;Shema&quot;. He pronounced the last word of the sentence, &quot;Eḥad&quot; (&quot;one&quot;) with his last breath. Since then, it has been traditional for Jews to say the &quot;Shema&quot; as their last words. In 2006 Roi Klein, a major in the Israel Defense Forces, said the &quot;Shema&quot; before jumping on a live grenade and dying to save his fellow soldiers.

=== Other religious literature ===
Reformulations of the &quot;Shema&quot; appear in later Jewish Scripture, Second Temple literature, and New Testament texts. In these texts, sometimes new features are added to the &quot;Shema&quot; (e.g. 2 Kings 19:19; Zech. 14:9), in others, it is abbreviated to “God is One” (Philo, Spec. 1.30), “one God” (Josephus, C. Ap. 2.193), or “God alone” (2 Maccabees 7:37). The following is a selection of significant occurrences.

In later Jewish scripture:
* : &quot;And now, O Lord our God, please deliver us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are the Lord God alone.&quot; 
* : &quot;And the Lord shall become King over all the earth; on that day shall the Lord be one, and His name one.&quot;
* : &quot;Have we not all one father? Has not one God created us? Why should we betray, each one his brother, to profane the covenant of our forefathers?&quot;

In Second Temple literature:
* &quot;Letter of Aristeas&quot; 132: &quot;But first of all he taught that God is one, and that his power is made manifest in all things, and that every place is filled with his sovereignty, and that nothing done by men on earth secretly escapes his notice, but that all that anyone does and all that is to be is manifest to him.&quot;
* 2 Maccabees 7:37-38: &quot;I, like my brothers, give up body and life for the laws of our fathers, appealing to God to show mercy soon to our nation and by afflictions and plagues to make you confess that he alone is God, and through me and my brothers to bring to an end the wrath of the Almighty which has justly fallen on our whole nation.&quot;
* Philo, &quot;On Special Laws&quot; 1.30: &quot;This lesson he continually repeats, sometimes saying that God is one and the Framer and Maker of all things, sometimes that He is Lord of created beings, because stability and fixity and lordship are by nature vested in Him alone.&quot;
* Josephus, &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; 4.199: &quot;And let there be neither an altar nor a temple in any other city; for God is but one, and the nation of the Hebrews is but one.&quot;
* Josephus, &quot;Against Apion&quot; 2.193: &quot;There ought also to be but one temple for one God; for likeness is the constant foundation of agreement. This temple ought to be common to all men, because he is the common God of all men.&quot;

In the New Testament:
* Mark 12:28-29 (NASB): One of the scribes came and heard them arguing, and recognizing that He had answered them well, asked Him, &quot;What commandment is the foremost of all?&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;The foremost is, &#x27;Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God is one Lord.&#x27;&quot;
* Romans 3:29-30 (NASB): &quot;Or is God the God of Jews only? Is He not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, since indeed God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith is one.&quot;
* James 2:19 (NASB): &quot;You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder.&quot;

=== Music and film ===
* Arnold Schoenberg used it as part of the story to his narrative orchestral work &quot;A Survivor from Warsaw&quot; (1947).
* In &quot;Parade&quot;, a musical based on true events, the main character Leo Frank, wrongly accused of the murder of a child worker at the pencil factory he manages, recites the &quot;Shema Yisrael&quot; as a vigilante gang kidnap and hang him in the final scenes of the work.
* Pop versions have been published by Mordechai ben David and Sarit Hadad.
* In &quot;Pi&quot;, Max Cohen and Lenny Meyer can be seen reciting the first three verses of the &quot;Shema&quot;.
* In &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot;, Anthony Quinn, as the fictional Pope Kiril, explores the back streets of Rome disguised as a simple priest, and recites the &quot;Shema&quot; at the bedside of a dying Roman Jew.
* Reggae singer Matisyahu recites the &quot;Shema&quot; in his songs &quot;Got No water&quot; and &quot;Tel Aviv&#x27;n&quot;.
* Yaakov Shwekey, in his &quot;Shema Yisrael&quot;, used the story of Rabbi Eliezer Silver&#x27;s saving Jewish children hidden in Christian monasteries following the Holocaust by reciting the first line of the &quot;Shema&quot;.
* Singer Justin Bieber says the &quot;Shema&quot; before each public performance with his manager Scooter Braun, who is Jewish.
* Italian parody band Nanowar of Steel paraphrased it as &quot;Shema Yggdrasil&quot; in their 2019 single &quot;Valhallelujah.&quot;

=== Television ===
In episode 9 of season 3 of the television series &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;, the character Frank Frink recites the &quot;Shema&quot; just before he is executed.

In the &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; episode &quot;Kaddish for Uncle Manny&quot;, Joel Fleischman doubts the sincerity of a burly itinerant lumberjack who arrives in response to Maurice Minnifield&#x27;s offer of free food and lodging to participate in a minyan; he asks the man to recite the &quot;Shema&quot;, which he does. In the episode &quot;The Body in Question&quot;, Joel Fleischman recites the first verse of the &quot;Shema&quot; while sick in bed after falling asleep in a freezer, where he had a dream he spoke with the prophet Elijah at his great-grandfather&#x27;s Passover Seder in Poland.

In episode 4 of season 2 of the television series &quot;Shtisel&quot; (2015), Rebetzen Erblich asks her friend Bube Malka to recite the &quot;Shema&quot; with her as she is preparing to die.

In episode 6 of season 1 of the television series &quot;The Sandman&quot;, Death comes for an old Jewish man, Harry who recites the &quot;Shema&quot; before dying.

In episode 10 of season 5 of the television series &quot;Snowfall&quot;, Avi Drexler sings the &quot;Shema&quot; after he has been shot in the stomach by a KGB officer, likely intended as his last words.

==Divine unity of the &quot;Shema&quot; in Hasidic philosophy==
The second section of the Tanya brings the mystical panentheism of the founder of Hasidic Judaism, the Baal Shem Tov, into philosophical explanation. It outlines the Hasidic interpretation of God&#x27;s Unity in the first two lines of the &quot;Shema&quot;, based upon their interpretation in Kabbalah. The emphasis on Divine Omnipresence and immanence lies behind Hasidic joy and &quot;devekut&quot;, and its stress on transforming the material into spiritual worship. In this internalisation of Kabbalistic ideas, the Hasidic follower seeks to reveal the Unity and hidden holiness in all activities of life.

Medieval, rationalist Jewish philosophers (exponents of &quot;Hakirah&quot;–rational &quot;investigation&quot; from first principles in support of Judaism), such as Maimonides, describe Biblical monotheism to mean that there is only one God, and his essence is a unique, simple, infinite Unity. Jewish mysticism provides a philosophic paradox, by dividing God&#x27;s Unity into God&#x27;s essence and emanation.

In Kabbalah and especially Hasidism, God&#x27;s Unity means that there is nothing independent of his essence. The new doctrine in Lurianic Kabbalah of God&#x27;s &quot;tzimtzum&quot; (&quot;withdrawal&quot;) received different interpretations after Isaac Luria, from the literal to the metaphorical. To Hasidism and Schneur Zalman, it is unthinkable for the &quot;withdrawal&quot; of God that &quot;makes possible&quot; Creation, to be taken literally. The paradox of &quot;Tzimtzum&quot; only relates to the Ohr Ein Sof (&quot;Infinite Light&quot;), not the Ein Sof (Divine essence) itself. God&#x27;s infinity is revealed in both complementary infinitude (infinite light) and finitude (finite light). The &quot;withdrawal&quot; was only a concealment of the Infinite Light into the essence of God, to allow the latent potentially finite light to emerge after the God limiting &quot;tzimtzum&quot;. God himself remains unaffected (&quot;For I, the Lord, I have not changed&quot; Malachi 3:6). His essence was One, alone, before Creation, and still One, alone, after Creation, without any change. As the &quot;tzimtzum&quot; only limits God to a concealment, therefore God&#x27;s Unity remains Omnipresent. In the Baal Shem Tov&#x27;s interpretation, Divine providence affects every detail of Creation. The &quot;movement of a leaf in the wind&quot; is part of the unfolding Divine presence, and is a necessary part of the complete &quot;Tikkun&quot; (Rectification in Kabbalah). This awareness of the loving Divine purpose and significance of each individual and his free will, awakens mystical love and awe of God.

Schneur Zalman explains that God&#x27;s divided Unity has two levels, an unlimited level and a limited one, that are both paradoxically true. The main text of medieval Kabbalah, the Zohar, describes the first verse of the &quot;Shema&quot; (&quot;Hear O Israel, the Lord is God, the Lord is One&quot;) as the &quot;Upper level Unity&quot;, and the second line (&quot;Blessed be the Name of the Glory of His Kingdom forever&quot;) as the limited &quot;Lower level Unity&quot;. Schneur Zalman gives the Chabad explanation of this. In his Kabbalah philosophy, all Creation is dependent on the limited, immanent, potentially finite, &quot;Light that Fills all Worlds&quot;, that each Creation receives continually. All is &quot;bittul&quot;–nullified to the light, even though in our realm this complete dependence is hidden. From this perspective, of God knowing the Creation on its own terms, Creation exists, but the true essence of anything is only the Divine spark that continuously recreates it from nothing. God is One, as nothing has any independent existence without this continual flow of Divine Will to Create. This is the pantheistic Lower Level Unity.

In relation to God&#x27;s essence, Creation affects no change or withdrawal. All Creation takes place &quot;within&quot; God. &quot;There is nothing but God&quot;. The ability to create can only come from the infinite Divine essence, represented by the Tetragrammaton name of God. However, &quot;It is not the essence of the Divine, to create Worlds and sustain them&quot;, as this ability is only external to the Infinite essence &quot;outside&quot; God. Creation only derives from God&#x27;s revelatory anthropomorphic &quot;speech&quot; (as in Genesis 1), and even this is unlike the external speech of Man, as it too remains &quot;within&quot; God. From this upper perspective of God knowing himself on his own terms, the created existence of Creation does not exist, as it is as nothing in relation to Zalman&#x27;s philosophically constructed concept of God&#x27;s essence. This monistic acosmism is the &quot;Upper Level Unity&quot;, as from this perspective, only God exists.

==In Islam==

The words used in the &quot;Shema&quot; prayer are similar to the words of verse 1 of Sura 112 (Al-Tawhid or Monotheism) in the Quran: , &quot;qul huwa llāhu ʾaḥad&quot; (&quot;Say, He is God the One&quot;). The word , &quot;aḥad&quot;, in Arabic is a cognate of the word , &quot;eḥad&quot;, in Hebrew.

==In Christianity==

The &quot;Shema&quot; is one of the Old Testament sentences quoted in the New Testament. The Gospel of mentions that Jesus of Nazareth considered the opening exhortation of the &quot;Shema&quot; to be the first of his two greatest commandments and linked with a second (based on Leviticus 19:18b): &quot;The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment. And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot; In the &quot;Shema&quot; is also linked with Leviticus 19:18. The verses Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18b both begin with &quot;ve&#x27;ahavta&quot;, &quot;and you shall love&quot;. In Luke&#x27;s Gospel, it appears that this connection between the two verses was already part of cultural discussion or practice.

Theologians Carl Friedrich Keil and Franz Delitzsch noted that &quot;the heart is mentioned first (in Deuteronomy 6:5), as the seat of the emotions generally and of love in particular; then follows the soul (&quot;nephesh&quot;) as the centre of personality in man, to depict the love as pervading the entire self-consciousness; and to this is added, &quot;with all the strength&quot;, i.e. of body and soul.

The &quot;Shema&quot; has also been incorporated into Christian liturgy, and is discussed in terms of the Trinity. In the Latin Catholic Liturgy of the Hours, the &quot;Shema&quot; is read during the Night Prayer or &quot;Compline&quot; every Saturday, thereby concluding the day&#x27;s prayers. The Anglican Book of Common Prayer in use in Canada since 1962 has included the &quot;Shema&quot; in its Summary of the Law. Since 2012, when the Anglican Use version of the BCP, the Book of Divine Worship, was adapted for use in Canada, it has been recited by Roman Catholics as well. It has been incorporated into Divine Worship: The Missal, transposed as the &quot;Summary of the Law&quot; in Mt 22:37-40 and is recited either by the Priest or the Deacon.

The Anglican (and Orthodox Celtic) Church officially utilizes the &quot;Shema&quot; in the Daily Services. Namely with the decalogue.

<doc id="211075" wikidata="Q351710" url="?curid=211075" title="Kalevi Sorsa">
<text>Taisto Kalevi Sorsa (21December 193016January 2004) was a Finnish politician who served as Prime Minister of Finland three times: 1972–1975, 1977–1979 and 1982–1987. At the time of his death he still held the record for most days of incumbency as Finnish prime minister. He was also a long-time leader of the Social Democratic Party of Finland.

== Early years ==
Taisto Kalevi Sorsa was born on 21 December 1930 in Keuruu. Sorsa&#x27;s surname literally means &quot;anatid&quot; in Finnish.

Sorsa attended school in Jyväskylä and Lappeenranta. At the age of 18, Sorsa&#x27;s involvement with the SDP started in Lappeenranta. Prior to his political career, Sorsa worked in Paris for UNESCO from 1959 to 1965 and served as Secretary-General of the Finnish UNESCO board from 1965 to 1969. In the late 1960s, he also served as an official in the Ministry of Education.

In 1969, he was brought in from relative obscurity by Rafael Paasio, a former Prime Minister of Finland, to assume the influential post of party secretary, despite not having much experience of national politics.

A 2008 book by historian Jukka Seppinen claimed that Sorsa was at this date already receiving support from Soviet backers in the KGB. However, other historians have disputed this, and while there was a list in a pro-Soviet newspaper of the candidates who should not be chosen as the party secretary, such as the right-wing social democrat Pekka J. Korvenheimo, there is no proof that the Soviets would have at this point particularly supported Sorsa.

==Prime Minister and Foreign Minister (1972–1989)==

===Sorsa and domestic politics===
Sorsa was a leading political figure during the presidencies of Kekkonen and Koivisto. He served as the chairman of the Social Democratic Party from 1975 to 1987 and was Prime Minister of Finland in four centre-left coalitions for a total of ten years (1972–1975, 1977–1979, 1982–1983, 1983–1987). He remains Finland&#x27;s longest-serving prime minister.

After his premiership he served as the Speaker of the Finnish Parliament from 1989 to 1991. During his career he also served twice as Deputy Prime Minister, from 1975 to 1976 and from 1987 to 1989. From 1987 to 1996, Sorsa served on the governing board of the Bank of Finland. He was also known for his participation as the convener in the economic policy seminar at Hotel Korpilampi in Lahnus, Espoo, in September 1977.

Sorsa is regarded as one of Finland&#x27;s most influential prime ministers, making major contributions to schools and health care, and increasing social security for families with children and pensioners. His governments strengthened the welfare state in Finland, by enacting many reforms—child care laws, longer maternity leave, the annual vacation benefit act, as well as the public health act.

In domestic politics, Sorsa had a particularly difficult relationship with Paavo Väyrynen, the strong-willed head of the Center Party. Another notable conflict was his rivalry with young rising politician Paavo Lipponen.

In June 1984, Sorsa gave a speech on &quot;infocracy&quot; (i.e. the power of the mass media) at the Social Democratic party convention. Infocracy challenges parliamentary democracy, is unintelligent and avoids discussing social problems, he said: it takes more interest in individual politicians than political issues and is never critical of its own actions.

===Sorsa and foreign affairs===

Three times Kalevi Sorsa served as Minister for Foreign Affairs (Finland): in 1972; in 1975–1976; and from 1987 to 1989.

Sorsa supported the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe after its creation in 1975, as well as projects to bridge the gap between the world&#x27;s richest and poorest countries. In the 1970s, despite opposition from far-left parties, he championed a hard-won, free-trade agreement with the European Economic Community (EEC), which boosted ties between Finland and the countries of Western Europe.

Sorsa was also active in the international social democratic movement, and in the mid-1970s was elected vice-president of the Socialist International.

In the late 1970s and in the 1980s the Socialist International had extensive contacts and discussion with the two leading powers of the Cold War period, the United States and the Soviet Union, on issues concerning East–West relations, arms control and Afghanistan. The Socialist International supported détente and disarmament agreements, such as SALT II, START and INF. They had several meetings and discussion in Washington, D.C., with President Jimmy Carter and Vice-President George Bush and with CPSU Secretaries General Leonid Brezhnev and Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow. Sorsa led the Socialist International&#x27;s delegations to these discussions.

==Later years (1989–2004)==

In 1993, Sorsa sought to become the Social Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential candidate, but in the primary elections, which were exceptionally and controversially open to all Finns regardless of their party membership, he lost to his challenger Martti Ahtisaari, the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations from 1977 to 1981, who later also won the main presidential elections and went on to become the Finnish President. Although the social democratic primaries of 1993 have generally been seen as a disaster, as there was nobody to register the voters and people who were not even members of the party could vote multiple times at different voting posts, there was little criticism of the primary election arrangements after Ahtisaari had won. However, it is also likely that he would have won regardless of the way that the primaries were held. Ahtisaari was supported by a small but significant group of Finnish politicians who had long been hostile to Kalevi: Erkki Tuomioja, Lasse Lehtinen and Matti Ahde.

===Later years===
Kalevi Sorsa continued to participate in discussions of social policy until the end of his life, his last column being published posthumously.

He died of cancer on 16 January 2004 at his home in Helsinki at the age of 73. He was survived by his wife; the couple had no children.

The Kalevi Sorsa Foundation is a social democratic think tank, established in 2005 and named in his honour.

<doc id="211077" wikidata="Q596596" url="?curid=211077" title="Daikatana">
<text>Daikatana is a first-person shooter game developed by Ion Storm. It was published by Eidos Interactive for Windows and Kemco for Nintendo 64. Players control a swordsmaster who travels through various time periods using the eponymous Daikatana, a powerful sword tied to the fate of the world.

&quot;Daikatana&quot; was directed by Ion Storm co-founder John Romero, a co-developer of the influential first-person shooters &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; (1992), &quot;Doom&quot; (1993), and &quot;Quake&quot; (1996). Announced in 1997 as Romero&#x27;s first game after leaving id Software, it underwent a troubled development that saw a change in its engine, release date delays, and the departure of several staff members. The protracted development, combined with promotion that focused on Romero&#x27;s involvement over the game itself, resulted in negative publicity for &quot;Daikatana&quot; prior to its release.

Released in May 2000, &quot;Daikatana&quot; received generally negative reviews for its outdated graphics, gameplay, repetitive sound effects, and poor artificial intelligence. It also sold only 40,351 copies, becoming one of the biggest major commercial failures of the video game industry. Due to the negative response, a separate version for the Game Boy Color did not receive a North American release; it was released in Europe and Japan to a more positive reception.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Daikatana&quot; is composed of 24 levels (18 in the console versions) divided into four episodes, with a varying number of levels per episode. Each episode represents a different location and time period: Japan in 2455 AD, ancient Greece in 1200 BC, the Dark Ages in Norway in 560 AD, and near-future San Francisco in 2030 AD.

One element that &quot;Daikatana&quot; stressed was the important role of Hiro Miyamoto&#x27;s two sidekicks, Mikiko Ebihara (Bread) and Superfly Johnson. The death of either sidekick resulted in failing the level, and their assistance was required to complete certain puzzles. Due to poor AI implementation, the sidekicks, who were one of the game&#x27;s selling points, became a focus of criticism.

==Plot==
In feudal Japan, two rival clans, Ebihara and Mishima, are at war. Mishima goes to swordmaster Usagi Miyamoto to craft a weapon to end the conflict: the Daikatana. However, Usagi realizes Mishima&#x27;s dark desires and gives the Daikatana to Ebihara; Inshiro Ebihara throws the sword into a volcano at the end of the war.

In 2455 AD, swordmaster Hiro Miyamoto is visited by a man named Dr. Toshiro Ebihara, a descendant of Inshiro who is suffering from a plague and about to die. Toshiro tells Hiro that Kage Mishima, the ruler of the planet, took over the world by stealing the Daikatana and using it to alter history. In 2030, he stole the cure to a viral plague and uses the cure to control the world&#x27;s population. Mikiko Ebihara (Toshiro&#x27;s daughter) has been captured while trying to steal back the Daikatana, and Hiro must rescue her and fix history.

Hiro storms Mishima&#x27;s headquarters where he rescues Mikiko as well as Superfly Johnson (Mishima&#x27;s head of security) who rebelled when he grew sick of Mishima&#x27;s brutal totalitarian practices. Mikiko and Superfly join Hiro in his quest and steal the Daikatana. Mishima encounters the trio as they steal the sword, wielding a second Daikatana. Mishima sends the trio back in time to Ancient Greece. Hiro and Mikiko defeat Medusa, recharging the Daikatana as it absorbs Medusa&#x27;s power. The three time jump once more, only to encounter Mishima again and be sent through time to the Dark Ages, stranded as the Daikatana has run out of energy.

The group finds a sorcerer named Musilde who offers to recharge the Daikatana if Hiro, Superfly, and Mikiko can save his village from the black plague. To do this, the group must defeat the necromancer Nharre, reassemble a holy sword called the Purifier, and use it to restore King Gharroth&#x27;s sanity so that he may use the sword to end the plague. When King Gharroth recharges the Daikatana, Hiro and his allies time jump again to the year 2030. San Francisco has fallen to gangs and martial law has been declared by the military and Mishima.

The trio fights their way through a naval base where the Mishima is working on weapons. The ghost of Usagi enters Hiro&#x27;s body and gives him full control over the Daikatana. With Usagi&#x27;s knowledge and sword skills, Hiro slays Mishima. One of the Daikatana disappears, as its timeline no longer exists.

Mikiko steals the remaining Daikatana and kills Superfly, revealing that the feudal Ebihara clan was just as evil as the Mishima clan. She announces her intentions to use the Daikatana to restore the honor of her ancient clan and take over the world. Hiro defeats and kills Mikiko, then uses the Daikatana to fix history once and for all. The altered timeline concludes: the Daikatana is never found in 2455, the viral plague is cured in 2030, the Mishima clan never takes over the world, and Hiro exiles himself to a forgotten corner of the space-time continuum, safeguarding the Daikatana to ensure that it never falls into evil hands.

==Development==

&quot;Daikatana&quot; was created by John Romero, an influential developer whose résumé included founding titles in the first-person shooter genre (&quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Quake&quot;) when he worked at id Software. The game was developed by Ion Storm, a company founded by Romero, Tom Hall, Bob Wright, Mike Wilson, Todd Porter, and Jerry O&#x27;Flaherty. Wilson, the CEO, was removed in November 1997, after using $30,000 in company funds to buy a BMW. Wright was removed by Porter and O&#x27;Flaherty in May 1998. Over 50 Ion Storm employees left after Wright&#x27;s removal. Porter and O&#x27;Flaherty were fired in 1999, with rumors being that Romero was angry at Porter&#x27;s interference in &quot;Daikatana&quot;.

The aim was for the company to create games that catered to their creative tastes without excessive publisher interference, which had constrained both Romero and Hall too much in the past. &quot;Daikatana&quot; was part of an initial three-game contract made between Ion Storm and expanding publisher Eidos Interactive; and the third title to be conceived at Ion Storm after &quot;Anachronox&quot; and what would become &quot;&quot;. Ion Storm received a $13 million advance from Eidos. The game had a rumored budget of $30 million.

Two main influences for &quot;Daikatana&quot; were &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;, of which Romero was a fan. He implemented the sidekick feature from the former and the mighty sword from the latter. For the sidekicks, Romero wanted Mikiko and Superfly to do everything the player does in the game. Using 2001&#x27;s &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon&quot; as another reference, he wanted the sidekicks to do more than what the AI squads can do like jumping, running, fighting and solving puzzles (the AI squads are locked to the ground and cannot jump). Romero later regretted this decision as he found out that programming this feature was very difficult because the sidekicks ended up being buggy and unresponsive.

In 1997, Romero compared &quot;Quake&quot; seven weapons and ten monsters across the game with 150 polygons to &quot;Daikatana&quot; thirty-five weapons and sixteen monsters per episode with 500 polygons. John Carmack stated that a game of that size could not be completed by its December release date. Romero&#x27;s design document for the game was 400 pages long. Kee Kimbrell, the co-creator of DWANGO, was the lead programmer.

The core concept was to do something different with shooter mechanics several times within the same game. Romero created the basic storyline, and named its protagonist Hiro Miyamoto in honour of Japanese game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. The title is written in Japanese kanji, translating roughly to &quot;big sword&quot;. The name comes from an item in a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign played by the original members of id Software, which Romero co-founded. During this early period, the team consisted of fifteen people. The music was composed by a team which included Will Loconto. Christian Divine created the character Superfly Johnson, originally named Super Williams in honor of &quot;Super Fly&quot; and Jim Kelly&#x27;s character from &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;. He was originally of French descent with &quot;his name taken from the few cultural documents left in the apocalyptic future&quot; and his &quot;character arc would be finding out his real identity at the end&quot;.

The game was built using the original Quake engine and had a planned release date of December 1997. Romero saw the &quot;Quake II&quot; demo at E3 1997 and decided to switch to the Quake II engine, but did not receive it until February 1998. A version of &quot;Daikatana&quot; on the &quot;Quake&quot; engine was shown at that year&#x27;s E3 alongside &quot;Tomb Raider II&quot; &quot;to a muted reception&quot; according to &quot;Edge&quot;. It was listed at 50% completed by August 1997. This change resulted in many delays when finalizing the engine. The problems with programming the new engine contributed to the game being delayed from its projected 1998 release date. Romero stated prior to release that he would have chosen the &quot;Quake II&quot; engine to develop the game from the start if given the chance. Romero later ascribed some problems triggered in using the technology as being due to the rivalry manufactured by the company&#x27;s marketing between them and id Software. Due to the delays, development of the game ran parallel to &quot;Anachronox&quot;, &quot;Dominion: Storm Over Gift 3&quot;, and eventually &quot;Deus Ex&quot;. Both &quot;Quake II&quot; and &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; came out before &quot;Daikatana&quot;.

Something that further impacted production was the departure of around twenty staff members from the team, who either left Ion Storm or transferred to the Austin studio. In 1998, lead artist Bryan Pritchard left the company and was replaced by Eric Smith. According to Divine, the growing negative press surrounding the company had a further detrimental effect on development. Some of the backlash eventually led to his own departure for Ion Storm&#x27;s Austin studio to work on &quot;Deus Ex&quot;. Almost the entire team working on &quot;Daikatana&quot; left to join Gathering of Developers by 1999. The most notorious incident was the public resignation of nine core team members at once, something Romero understood given the low team morale but felt as a betrayal of trust. The departures led to the hiring of Stevie Case as level designer and Chris Perna to polish and add to character models. 17 people, one-fifth of Ion Storm&#x27;s employees, left in early 1999, and Corrinne Yu, director of technology, left for 3D Realms. Only two staff members remained on the game for the entirety of its production.

Problems reached the point that Eidos publishing director John Kavanagh was sent down to sort out problems surrounding its production. In a later interview, Romero admitted there were many faults with the game at release, blaming the development culture and management clashes at Ion Storm, in addition to staff departures causing much of the work to be scrapped and begun over again. Divine attributed the problems to a combination of overly carefree atmosphere, and corporate struggles about company ownership interfering with game production. In a 1999 interview, Romero attributed the slowing of development during that period to the staff departures, but said that most of the level design and the entire score had been completed before that. &quot;Wired&quot; listed the game 5th on the list of vaporware for 1999. A sequel, using the Unreal Engine 1, was considered.

==Promotion and release==

&quot;Daikatana&quot; was revealed in 1997, forming part of the opening publicity for Ion Storm. In subsequent years, the press material focused almost entirely on pushing the company name and its lead developers, something later regretted by several of its staff. This was particularly true of Romero. This consequently drew Romero away from production, leading to further difficulties. Public, journalistic and commercial confidence in the project was weakened by the repeated delays to its release date. The situation was worsened when the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; printed a story about the internal struggles of the Austin office, which cited both undercover interviews and leaked emails. The article prompted widespread publicity surrounding the staff departures and the company&#x27;s financial status. Romero responded by calling the claims of the article &quot;both biased and inaccurate&quot;. Later, Romero felt that their marketing&#x27;s attempts to push the game only made Ion Storm and its core members come off as egotistical.

&quot;Daikatana&quot; was advertised with a 1997 print advert with the phrase &quot;John Romero&#x27;s about to make you his bitch&quot;, which became notorious. According to Mike Wilson, the advert was created by the same artist who designed the game&#x27;s box art, under order of their chosen advertising agency. Both Wilson and Romero thought it was funny and approved it. Romero had second thoughts soon after but was persuaded by Wilson to let it pass. Speaking ten years later, Romero said he went along with it as he had a reputation for similar crass phrases. He said that the reactions to the poster tarnished the game&#x27;s image long before release and continued to affect his public image and career. In a 2008 blog post, Romero attributed the marketing tactic to Wilson, prompting a hostile exchange of public messages between the two. Romero told &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; that Sasha Shor, designed the game&#x27;s packaging and the ad.

&quot;Daikatana&quot; was demoed at the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo. The demo ran at a very low 12 frames per second, which further damaged the game&#x27;s public image. Staff member Jake Hughes remembered that Romero wanted changes made which crippled the demo tech and caused the issues, while Romero states that he had already departed for E3 and the upper management insisted on the changes when he was gone. On April 21, 2000, &quot;Daikatana&quot; was completed and reached gold status. A tie-in comic book was drawn by Marc Silvestri and released by Top Cow for Prima Games&#x27; &quot;Daikatana: Prima&#x27;s Official Strategy Guide&quot;. The Nintendo 64 version was first released as a Blockbuster rental exclusive by Kemco in August 2000. It was later released for retail on November 26, 2000.

&quot;Daikatana&quot; received a 44 megabyte patch and its final patch, version 1.2, was released on September 29, 2000. Following the release of &quot;Daikatana&quot; and &quot;Anachronox&quot;, Ion Storm Austin decided to close the Dallas branch office in July 2001. In the absence of any further official support after this closure, Romero gave the source code to community members, allowing them to develop additional platform ports (most notably Linux, macOS and other Unix-like systems) and bug fixes.

==Reception==
===Sales===
Ion Storm&#x27;s 1996 business plan projected that &quot;Daikatana&quot; would sell around 175,000 copies. Before &quot;Daikatana&quot;″s release, reports indicated that Ion Storm forecast sales of 2.5 million units, a number that GameDaily called necessary for the game &quot;to become profitable&quot;. According to American market research company PC Data, a week after its release, the game ranked number ten on their charts from the week of May 28 to June 3. The computer version of &quot;Daikatana&quot; sold 8,190 copies in the United States by July 21, which drew revenues of $271,982. Mark Asher of CNET Gamecenter called this performance &quot;a disaster&quot;. According to PC Data, the game&#x27;s domestic sales reached 40,351 units through September 2000.

===Reviews===
Jeff Lundrigan reviewed the PC version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that &quot;This isn&#x27;t the worst game you&#x27;ll ever play, but there&#x27;s precious little fun either. Two years out of its time, &quot;Daikatana&quot; is notable mostly for its mediocrity.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a &quot;D&quot;, calling the game a &quot;disaster&quot; on the scale of the box-office bomb &quot;Waterworld&quot;. &quot;PC Zone&quot; review criticized the first episode as the worst part of the game and that &quot;Romero&#x27;s reputation is based on the fact that he is the daddy of game design. &quot;Daikatana&quot; must be his illegitimate child&quot;. The second level in Greece was praised by Robert Coffey in &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; as the game&#x27;s best level.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; named it the worst game of 2000. It was listed as the worst game of the year by &quot;Maximum PC&quot; technical editor Will Smith and associate editor Geoff Visgilio.

The Nintendo 64 version received &quot;unfavorable&quot; reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; gave the Nintendo 64 version a score of 5.6 out of 10 stating that &quot;Doom&quot; on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was superior. David Toole&#x27;s review in &quot;GameSpot&quot; criticized the low amount of enemies in this version and the simplistic music, but praised the smooth in-game framerate despite the cutscene framerate being low.

===Retrospective analysis===
Since its release, the game has been called one of the worst video games of all time. GameTrailers ranked the game as the second-biggest gaming disappointment of the 2000s, citing the game&#x27;s terrible AI, pushed-back release dates, controversial magazine ad, and internal drama as &quot;the embodiment of game&#x27;s industry hubris.&quot;

The game critic Ben &quot;Yahtzee&quot; Croshaw, on a retrospective episode of Zero Punctuation, also citing the development delays and the magazine ad, named &quot;Daikatana&quot; &quot;one of the most notorious disappointments in the entire history of first-person shooters&quot;, comparing the game to &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot;.

In 2010, Romero said that despite its shaky development and being considered one of the worst games of all time, &quot;Daikatana&quot; was &quot;more fun to make than &quot;Quake&quot;&quot; due to the lack of creative interference.

====Unofficial patch====

Daikatana v1.3 (also referred to as the &quot;1.3 patch&quot;) is an unofficial patch project started by modder and IT professional Frank Sapone and other modders.

Upon request, Romero sent the complete source code for version 1.2 of the game to Sapone. However, the hard drive that was sent corrupted. After shelving it for five years, Sapone successfully compiled the source code. After this, Sapone enlisted the help of other modders to help work on the patch. Reportedly, by playing multiplayer matches of the game, it has helped Sapone find bugs and test the code&#x27;s stability. In 2014, the first version of the patch was released. It is currently under active development.

The project aims to fix various issues the game was criticized for and make general improvements: 
* Bug fixes
* Faster loading times with an option to disable the sound effect 
* Graphical fidelity
* Improved AI for the sidekick characters (including the options to make them invincible on the easy difficulty, increased health on other modes, or to play without them)
* Fixed online multiplayer utilizing the QTracker service
* Support for widescreen (including 4K and 5K resolutions) 
* HD textures
* Glowmaps
* Ability to play the game on macOS (including systems with Apple silicon chipsets), Linux, and FreeBSD

Jack Pooley of &quot;WhatCulture&quot; called it a &quot;tectonic improvement&quot; over the vanilla game. Matteo Lupetti of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; said, &quot;Thanks to these modders, &quot;Daikatana&quot; is a totally playable game now.&quot; Speaking about the modders behind the project, Schnapple of &quot;Shacknews&quot; said, &quot;they&#x27;ve delivered a version of the game that&#x27;s improved the original considerably.&quot; Rashko Temelkovski of &quot;GloriousGaming.com&quot; said, &quot;thanks to these people, &quot;Daikatana&quot; is actually much better than you might remember it.&quot; John Walker of &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot; said, &quot;while boosting it ... via the improbable existence of still-maintained &quot;Daikatana&quot; 1.3 fan project, nothing can fix what a leaden lump of clumsy unfun [&quot;Daikatana&quot;] truly is.&quot;

Romero has praised and endorsed the project on his Twitter account.

==Game Boy Color version==

The Game Boy Color version of &quot;Daikatana&quot; was released in Europe and Japan; publisher Kemco decided against the North American release due to the poor reputation of the &quot;Daikatana&quot; brand. The Japanese version was also only made available as a download for the Nintendo Power peripheral. This version&#x27;s gameplay differs greatly from the N64 and PC versions: at Romero&#x27;s request, the title was adapted to the platform as a top-down dungeon crawler, in the style of early &quot;Zelda&quot; games such as the NES original and &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;. In 2004, Romero released the ROM images for the Game Boy Color game on his website, for use with emulators. Frank Provo for GameSpot gave the game a seven out of ten.

<text>Clifford Smith, Jr. (born March 2, 1971), better known by his stage name Method Man, is an American rapper, record producer, and actor. He is a member of the East Coast hip hop collective Wu-Tang Clan, and is half of the hip hop duo Method Man &amp; Redman. He took his stage name from the 1979 film &quot;Method Man&quot;. In 1996, Method Man won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You/You&#x27;re All I Need to Get By&quot;, featuring R&amp;B singer Mary J. Blige, with whom he later starred in &quot;Power Book II: Ghost&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;Power&quot;.

Method Man has appeared in films such as &quot;187&quot; (1997), &quot;Belly&quot; (1998), &quot;How High&quot; (2001), &quot;Garden State&quot; (2004), &quot;The Wackness&quot; (2008), &quot;Venom&quot; (2005), &quot;Red Tails&quot; (2012), &quot;Keanu&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Cobbler&quot; (2014). He and frequent collaborator rapper Redman co-starred on the short-lived Fox television sitcom &quot;Method &amp; Red&quot;. He has also had recurring roles in three HBO series, as Tug Daniels in &quot;Oz&quot;, Melvin &quot;Cheese&quot; Wagstaff in &quot;The Wire&quot;, and Rodney in &quot;The Deuce&quot;. Method Man also appeared in the TBS comedy series &quot;The Last O.G.&quot;.

==Early life==
Born on March 2, 1971 in Hempstead, Long Island, Smith divided his childhood between his father&#x27;s Long Island residence and his mother&#x27;s home in the Park Hill section of Clifton, Staten Island, locally known as Killa Hill. Growing up in Hempstead, Smith began playing lacrosse at a young age and continues to be a passionate supporter of the sport. He attended New Dorp High School, where he became friends with Remedy. He has two sisters.

==Music career==
===1992–1996: &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot; and &quot;Tical&quot;===
As Wu-Tang Clan ascended to hip hop stardom, Method Man was always one of the most visible members of the collective. He was one of only two members (along with GZA) to get a solo song on the group&#x27;s debut album &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot; and he was the first to release a solo album under the Clan&#x27;s unusual contract which allowed its members to release albums under any record label. Method Man chose to sign with rap label Def Jam Recordings, although Elektra Records A&amp;R man Dante Ross initially wanted to sign him around the same time Ross signed fellow group member Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard. Method Man&#x27;s solo debut, &quot;Tical&quot; (1994), was critically acclaimed and well received, entering the American charts at #4 and eventually selling in excess of one million copies. That album featured the hit single &quot;All I Need&quot;, later remixed featuring Mary J. Blige, which won a Grammy (&quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You/You&#x27;re All I Need&quot;). During this time Method Man also became close friends with fellow New York City-based rapper The Notorious B.I.G., and was the only guest rapper featured on his debut album &quot;Ready to Die,&quot; on the song &quot;The What&quot;. He was also featured on Spice 1&#x27;s album &quot;AmeriKKKa&#x27;s Nightmare&quot; on the track &quot;Hard 2 Kill&quot;. In 1995, he was also featured on &quot;Got the Flava&quot; off Showbiz and A.G.&#x27;s album &quot;Goodfellas&quot;. He also appeared on the Batman Forever soundtrack: his track, The Riddler, produced by RZA included a video with clips from the film. In 1996, Method Man appeared on Tupac Shakur&#x27;s album &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;, on the song &quot;Got My Mind Made Up&quot; alongside his rhyme partner Redman, Tha Dogg Pound and Inspectah Deck, whose verse did not make the released album version, although his nickname &quot;Rebel INS&quot; can be heard as the song fades. He was also featured on Redman&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Muddy Waters&quot; on the track &quot;Do What Ya Feel&quot;.

===1997–1998: &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot; and &quot;Tical 2000: Judgment Day&quot;===
On June 3, 1997, the Wu-Tang Clan released their Grammy-nominated multiplatinum double CD &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot;, the long-awaited follow up to &quot;36 Chambers&quot;. The album has sold over 6 million copies to date worldwide.

In 1996, the movie Space Jam was released. Method Man, alongside LL Cool J, Busta Rhymes, B-Real and Coolio released a song from the Space Jam Soundtrack called, &quot;Hit &#x27;Em High&quot;. Method Man would go on to feature on LL Cool J&#x27;s, &quot;4 ,3, 2, 1&quot; the following year.

His second solo album was &quot;Tical 2000: Judgement Day&quot;, released in 1998, which was heavily influenced by the apocalypse theories surrounding the forthcoming end of the millennium, and featured myriad guest appearances from his fellow Wu-Tang MCs. Other guest appearances include Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes, D&#x27;Angelo, Chris Rock, Mobb Deep, Redman, and brief cameos from Russell Simmons, Bishop Don &quot;Magic&quot; Juan, Janet Jackson, and Donald Trump. Fueled by the party track &quot;Judgment Day&quot; and the D&#x27;Angelo collaboration &quot;Break Ups 2 Make Ups&quot;, the album sold better than his debut, earning Platinum certifications in both the U.S. and Canada. Reviews for the album were mixed and its long runtime and abundance of intermittent comedy skits were widely criticized. Producers on this album included True Master, 4th Disciple and the RZA.

In 1997, the Scottish rock band Texas, found some success with their single, &quot;Say What You Want&quot;. In 1998, the band collaborated with Method Man and RZA on a remix of the song titled &quot;Say What You Want (All Day, Every Day)&quot;, with RZA producing. It was later included in the Greatest Hits album released by Texas.

===1999–2001: &quot;Blackout!&quot; (with Redman) and WWF Aggression===
Method Man was part of the very successful Hard Knock Life Tour with Jay-Z, Redman, Ja Rule, and DMX. During this tour, Method Man &amp; Redman recorded &quot;Blackout!&quot;, a light-hearted, bass-heavy, profanity-laced, party record with an EPMD-evoking emphasis on funky beats and the mischievous wit and cool flows and good rhythm of the two MCs. The album reached platinum status quickly, both in the U.S. and Canada, fueled by &quot;Da Rockwilder&quot;, &quot;Cereal Killa&quot;, &quot;1, 2, 1, 2&quot;, &quot;Tear It Off&quot; and &quot;Y.O.U.&quot; This album also featured three previously released tracks on which the two collaborated.

Their success would lead the duo on to star in movies and TV shows, become product spokespersons and household names, but also associated them with marijuana use in the media. The most immediate results of their success were their co-starring roles in the major motion picture film &quot;How High&quot;, their endorsement deal for &quot;Right Guard&quot;, Redman&#x27;s starring role in &quot;Seed of Chucky&quot; and a short-lived sitcom on Fox Television entitled &quot;Method &amp; Red&quot;.

In 1999, Method Man featured on Limp Bizkit&#x27;s song &quot;N 2 Gether Now&quot; from their album &quot;Significant Other&quot;.

In 2000, Method Man performed Know Your Role which was included on the album titled, WWF Aggression. The song is focused on the popularity of professional wrestler at the time Dwayne Johnson whose wrestling name was &#x27;The Rock&#x27; and the main line in the song is The Rock&#x27;s most famous caption &quot;Do you smell what The Rock is cookin&#x27;?&quot;.

===2001–2004: &quot;The W&quot;, &quot;Iron Flag&quot;, and &quot;Tical 0: The Prequel&quot;===
The Wu-Tang Clan released &quot;The W&quot; on November 21, 2000, and Iron Flag on December 18, 2001. &quot;The W&quot; received both critical and commercial success for the group, while &quot;Iron Flag&quot; did receive some but not to the same extent as its predecessor. The efforts earned two more platinum plaques for the Wu-Tang Clan.

In 2003, Method Man criticized Oli &quot;Power&quot; Grant and Mitchell &quot;Divine&quot; Diggs, the managers of the Wu-Tang Clan business. &quot;Number 1 on my shit list right now is Divine from Wu-Tang management. He took something major from me that he had no intention of giving back.&quot;

Aside from the financial issues, Method Man was unhappy with the decision to bring Wu-Tang into the fashion world for a brief period of time with Wu-Wear, despite the brand being a major money-maker for the group. &quot;When Wu-Wear started making shoes and sneakers and pants, it was shoddy material. I never rocked that shit.&quot;

In 2004, Method Man released his third solo album &quot;Tical 0: The Prequel&quot;, which featured the hit party single &quot;What&#x27;s Happenin&#x27;&quot; with Busta Rhymes and included guest appearances of pop-rap stars like Missy Elliott and P. Diddy. The album sold well and was certified gold record by the RIAA but did not see the platinum success of his previous solo releases.

P. Diddy was one of the executive producers for the album, although Meth later voiced his displeasure with the final product. &quot;On the third LP, it was suggested (by Def Jam) to bring in Harve Pierre and P. Diddy. Who am I to argue? Puff knows how to sell some records. But that wasn&#x27;t the direction to go in, and I know that.&quot;

===2006–2007: &quot;4:21... The Day After&quot;===

Method Man&#x27;s fourth album, entitled &quot;4:21: The Day After&quot; was released in August 2006 with a star lineup of producers featuring Havoc, Erick Sermon, Scott Storch, Allah Mathematics, Mr. Porter, and fellow Wu-Tang Clan member, RZA. This time around, a more focused Method Man went back to his hip hop roots and both hip hop fans and the media took notice. He did an interview on the ItsHipHop.Tv. Despite this being one of Meth&#x27;s strongest solo efforts to date, the album failed to do well commercially due to it having no single or video, which Method Man has held discontent towards his own label for. However, he toured strongly all over the world to promote the album, and appeared onstage with fellow Wu-Tang member Inspectah Deck, as well as New York up and comers Saigon, and Gat Murdah. Meth cited various reasons for the problems between him and his label, Def Jam. While he puts most of the blame on personal agendas in the Def Jam offices, Meth did take some blame, himself, for giving in to his record label.

In early May 2007, Method Man&#x27;s camp leaked the street single &quot;New York New York&quot; which became a popular track on the internet.

===2007–2010: &quot;Blackout! 2&quot;===
On March 27, 2007, Redman confirmed on BET&#x27;s &quot;Rap City: Tha Bassment&quot; that a sequel to &quot;How High&quot; was then being written .

In an April 10, 2007, Onion A.V. Club interview, Redman hinted that there would be a second collaborative album with Method Man, with work beginning in midsummer or early September.

In early 2008, a remake of the Smooth da Hustler and Trigger tha Gambler classic &quot;Broken Language&quot; was released to the internet by the duo entitled &quot;Broken Language 2008&quot;, fueling rumors of an upcoming &quot;Blackout!&quot; sequel. This rumor was further fueled by the duo while performing in Gainesville, Florida, at the University of Florida. &quot;Blackout! 2&quot; was scheduled for a December 9, 2008, release but was pushed back to the second quarter of 2009, with a new release date of May 19, 2009. Bun B confirmed that he guested on &quot;Blackout! 2&quot;. In April 2009, a single was released entitled &quot;City Lights&quot;, produced by Nasty Kutt. Erick Sermon, Rockwilder and Pete Rock also confirmed their presence on Blackout! 2.

The duo finished their &quot;Still High&quot; tour with Termanology, The Alchemist, and Evidence of Dilated Peoples.

===2011–present: &quot;The Meth Lab&quot; and &quot;Crystal Meth&quot;===

&quot;Crystal Meth&quot; was to be Method Man&#x27;s fifth and final studio album. The album has no confirmed release date. The &quot;Crystal Meth&quot; album was first announced before Method Man began working on his and Redman&#x27;s second album together, &quot;Blackout! 2&quot;, at which time it was tentatively titled &quot;The Crystal Method&quot;. In the liner notes of that album, it was given a scheduled release date of 2009. The album, however, was further postponed until it was later mentioned in an MTV interview that it would be released in early 2010. At a concert on December 23, 2010, Method Man told the crowd to look for his album in March 2011. However, the album was postponed again.

In an April 2011 interview with &quot;The Come Up Show&quot;, following a performance in Canada, Method Man replied to a question regarding his &quot;weed-loving&quot; image: &quot;When you get older and you&#x27;ve got kids and your kids are going to school and you know [their] teachers...and they see how active you are and concerned [you are] with your kids&#x27; education or well being, it&#x27;s hard to sit there and be taken seriously if people are always talking about he&#x27;s always high...which is totally not the case&quot;, he said. &quot;When I first came out, I was young, we were doing our thing, we smoked a lot...and we didn&#x27;t care if the world knew. Now, I have to use more discretion because of my kids. This is not for me; everything I do is for them now, so I use a bit more discretion and I don&#x27;t put weed as a forefront any more.&quot;

On October 5, 2011, a new single from Method Man, entitled &quot;World Gone Sour (The Lost Kids)&quot;, was released on iTunes. In July 2012, he confirmed that the album would come out in 2013 &amp; would be produced by RZA, although he has also stated that RZA would not produce the whole album, but instead be one of a few producers which would also include Erick Sermon, Rockwilder, and some then-younger producers such as Diggilo. He also expressed a desire to work with Odd Future frontman Tyler, the Creator. Throughout 2013, Method Man worked on material for &quot;Crystal Meth&quot; and on the Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;. He also toured with Redman throughout the year. On January 1, 2014, Method Man announced that a mixtape titled &quot;The Meth Lab&quot; would be released in March 2014 and that &quot;Crystal Meth&quot; would be released in August 2014 on Tommy Boy Entertainment. However, Method Man released &quot;The Meth Lab&quot; as a mixtape album through Tommy Boy on August 21, 2015. In 2019 Method Man featured on the record &#x27;Winnebago&#x27; with South London rapper Blue Meth. The music video was directed by Nick Donnelly.

&quot;Crystal Meth&quot; was supposedly going to be released in August 2016 but still hasn&#x27;t been released as of 2025.

<text>Jason S Hunter (born July 6, 1970), better known by his stage name Inspectah Deck, is an American rapper and hip hop producer. He is a member of the groups Wu-Tang Clan and Czarface.

He has acquired critical praise for his intricate lyricism, and for his verses on many of the group&#x27;s most revered songs. He has grown to become a producer in his own right, taking up tracks for fellow Wu rappers and his own projects.

==Early life==
Hunter was born July 6, 1970 in Bronx and grew up in Staten Island, New York. Hunter routinely mentions the Park Hill Projects in Clifton, Staten Island, where he grew up and went to school with Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, and Remedy. Hunter&#x27;s father died when he was six years old.

== Career ==
Hunter developed a laid-back and quiet personality which he carried into his stage persona, as a low-key counterbalance to the antics of Method Man, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard, and RZA, referenced by Method Man at the end of the track &quot;Can it Be All So Simple?&quot; on Wu-Tang&#x27;s debut album &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot;:

Despite this inconspicuous persona, Inspectah Deck maintained a relatively high profile, as he was the second most featured member on the album, and provided highly acclaimed verses for the singles &quot;C.R.E.A.M.,&quot; &quot;Protect Ya Neck,&quot; &quot;Wu-Tang Clan Ain&#x27;t Nuthing ta Fuck Wit,&quot; and &quot;Da Mystery of Chessboxin&#x27;.&quot; In the years following, Hunter would appear on several Wu members&#x27; solo projects, including Method Man&#x27;s &quot;Tical&quot; (1994), Raekwon&#x27;s &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx…&quot; (1995), GZA&#x27;s &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; (1995), and Ghostface Killah&#x27;s &quot;Ironman&quot; (1996). On Wu-Tang&#x27;s second group album, &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot; (1997), Deck produced the track &quot;Visionz&quot; and contributed a solo track, &quot;The City&quot;, as well as writing one of the most critically acclaimed verses in hip-hop on the group&#x27;s hit single &quot;Triumph&quot;. He would also provide production for some of his Wu cohorts, including &quot;Elements&quot; and &quot;Spazzola&quot; for Method Man&#x27;s &quot;Tical 2000: Judgement Day&quot; (1998), &quot;Kiss of a Black Widow&quot; for RZA&#x27;s &quot;RZA as Bobby Digital in Stereo&quot; (1998), and the title track for GZA&#x27;s &quot;Beneath the Surface&quot; (1999).

=== Solo career ===
Inspectah Deck was originally supposed to be featured on the track &quot;Got My Mind Made Up&quot; by 2Pac for his album All Eyez on Me along with Lady of Rage, however both artists were cut out at Shakur&#x27;s request. The song went on to feature Tha Dogg Pound, Redman, and Deck&#x27;s fellow Wu-Tang Clan member Method Man. Despite his verse being cut out, he can still be heard at the end of the song saying &quot;INS the rebel&quot; before it fades out. His debut album &quot;Uncontrolled Substance&quot; was initially set for a 1995 release on Loud Records, on which he signed for $650,000. But after Loud was acquired by Sony, it was delayed and set to release in late 1997, however, this experienced several additional delays due to a flood in producer RZA&#x27;s basement studio, which destroyed over one hundred beats, including all of the instrumentals made for the album. In September 1999, &quot;Uncontrolled Substance&quot; was released, and featured more of Deck&#x27;s own production, and appearances from several lesser known affiliates. The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics, but failed to garner the reception attained by earlier Wu-Tang solo projects. Shortly after this release, Deck returned to the Wu-Tang fold for the group albums &quot;The W&quot; (2000), and &quot;Iron Flag&quot; (2001).

In 2003, Inspectah Deck released his second studio album, &quot;The Movement&quot;, which he would later state did not live up to his expectations, and in 2006, he released &quot;The Resident Patient&quot;, intended as a prequel to The Movement. In 2007, the rapper reconvened with the Wu-Tang Clan to record the group album &quot;8 Diagrams&quot;. Along with Raekwon, and Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck
partook in the controversy, sparked when several group members disparaged RZA&#x27;s tight artistic control of the album, championing Ghost&#x27;s album &quot;The Big Doe Rehab&quot;. In regards to these disagreements, Deck stated in an interview:

Around this time he announced two new projects: an album called &quot;Czarface&quot; as a new collaboration called Czarface with Boston&#x27;s 7L &amp; Esoteric featuring the legendary DJ Premier and his up-coming solo album &quot;The Rebellion&quot;, confirming production from RZA and the Wu-Elements; it is now set to come after &quot;The Resident Patient II&quot;, and will reportedly be his final album as a solo artist.

On March 23, 2010, Inspectah Deck released his fourth solo album &quot;Manifesto&quot;, which features guest-appearances from Raekwon, Cormega, Termanology, Planet Asia, Cappadonna, Kurupt, and M.O.P.&#x27;s Billy Danze. In 2008, a mixtape entitled &quot;The Resident Patient II&quot; was leaked on to the internet; this features some original material, as well as freestyles over other artists&#x27; songs. Inspectah Deck stated in an interview that &quot;The Manifesto&quot; was meant to be the originally announced full-length sequel, &quot;Resident Patient II&quot;.

Since early 2010, Inspectah Deck has begun work on &quot;Czarface&quot; and &quot;The Rebellion&quot;, and has expressed his interest in working with several Wu-Tang members, as well as Snoop Dogg, E-40, Nas and Jadakiss on the album. He had mentioned in an interview with Conspiracy Radio that he will only retire from solo albums if the fans don&#x27;t show support for &quot;The Manifesto&quot; and &quot;The Rebellion&quot;. He has also mentioned his plans to release an instrumental album of his own production, entitled &quot;The Bodyrock Volume 1&quot;, which is inspired by the instrumental albums released by Alchemist, Ayatollah, and Pete Rock. On February 11, 2013, in an interview with HipHopDX, Inspectah Deck stated that he also has an upcoming album with producer Agallah in the works, and later confirmed during that year that he had renamed his &quot;The Rebellion&quot; album to &quot;Rebellion 2013&quot;. He recently confirmed via Twitter that he has again changed the name of his final album to &quot;Uncontrolled Substance II&quot;, a sequel to his debut album; that will be produced primarily by RZA along with The Wu-Elements.

After working with The Wu-Tang Clan on their sixth studio album &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;, he reunited with 7L &amp; Esoteric for another Czarface album titled &quot;Every Hero Needs a Villain&quot;, which was released in June 2015, and again in 2016 for the third Czarface album, &quot;A Fistful of Peril&quot;, after Marvel Entertainment reached out to them to record a track for their &quot;Black Panther&quot; web-series.

<doc id="211096" wikidata="Q1501828" url="?curid=211096" title="Mannerheim Cross">
<text>The Mannerheim Cross (, ), officially Mannerheim Cross of the Cross of Liberty (, ) is the most distinguished Finnish military honour. A total of 191 people received the cross between 22 July 1941 and 7 May 1945, with six of the recipients receiving a cross twice. Available in two classes, the 1st class medal has only been awarded twice, with both recipients also having received the medal in the 2nd class. Although still active &quot;de jure&quot;, no crosses have been awarded since 1945. Tuomas Gerdt, the last living Knight of the Mannerheim Cross, died on 1 November 2020.

==Description==
The honour, proposed by and named after Field Marshal Gustaf Mannerheim, was introduced after the Winter War on 16 December 1940. Associated with the Order of the Cross of Liberty, the decoration was awarded to soldiers for exceptional bravery, for the achievement of crucially important objectives by combat, or for especially successfully conducted operations. Unlike other awards associated with the Order of the Cross of Liberty, the awarding of either class of the Mannerheim Cross was not influenced by the military rank of the recipient.

The cross is awarded as either Mannerheim Cross of Liberty 1st Class or as Mannerheim Cross of Liberty 2nd Class. No special requirements differing from 2nd class were laid out for The Mannerheim Cross 1st Class. Within the order of precedence of Finnish awards, the Mannerheim Cross 1st Class ranks 5th and the Mannerheim Cross 2nd Class ranks 9th. A recipient of the cross is called &quot;Knight of the Mannerheim Cross&quot;.

Like the crosses of the Order of the Cross of Liberty, the design of the Mannerheim Cross displays the Old Scandinavian Fylfot, albeit in different colors and with added decorative elements. The 1st class cross is worn as a necklet, while the 2nd class cross is worn on the chest.

The award was associated with a monetary prize in 1943. Originally planned to be a lifetime pension, the prize was eventually set at 50,000 Finnish marks, approximately equivalent to a lieutenant&#x27;s annual salary.

==Knights of the Mannerheim Cross==
The Mannerheim Cross 2nd Class has been awarded to 191 persons. The first cross was awarded to Colonel Ruben Lagus on 22 July 1941. The first private to be awarded the cross was Vilho Rättö, who was awarded his cross on 3 August 1941 for destroying four enemy tanks with a sightless anti-tank gun taken from the enemy, by aiming the gun through its bore. The last cross was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel on 7 May 1945.

A total of four persons have been awarded the Mannerheim Cross 2nd Class twice. Both General Major Aaro Pajari and Colonel Martti Aho received their second crosses on 16 October 1944. They were followed by &quot;Lentomestari&quot; Ilmari Juutilainen and Captain Hans Wind, who both received their second awards on 26 June 1944. These double-awardees were given a small clasp, consisting of two crossed marshal&#x27;s batons, to be worn above the cross.

The first recipient of the Mannerheim Cross 1st Class was its namesake, Field Marshal C. G. E. Mannerheim, who accepted it together with a Mannerheim Cross 2nd Class from President of the Republic Risto Ryti on 7 October 1941 after all the previous awardees had requested him to accept the award. The only other recipient of the Mannerheim Cross 1st Class is General of Infantry Erik Heinrichs, who received it on 31 December 1944, following an earlier Mannerheim Cross 2nd Class on 5 February 1942.

The awardees of the Mannerheim Cross were predominately young, with 72 % of the awardees being 35 years of age or younger. Only 7 of the recipients were 51 or older, with the oldest recipient being Mannerheim himself. The crosses were awarded primarily to personnel from the army, with 159 recipients in the infantry. Five crosses were awarded to navy personnel, and a further 19 to air force personnel. Crosses were rarely awarded posthumously, with only six citations noting that the award was posthumous.

Starting from the presidency of Martti Ahtisaari, all surviving recipients of the Mannerheim Cross were invited annually on 6 December to Finland&#x27;s Independence Day Reception. By tradition they were the first guests to enter and greet the president.

Tuomas Gerdt, the last living Knight of the Mannerheim Cross, died on 1 November 2020.

==Foundation of the Knights of the Mannerheim Cross==

The first gathering of the Knights for the funeral of Mannerheim on 4 February 1951, where eight knights acted as pallbearers, resulted in a founding of the Foundation of the Knights of the Mannerheim Cross. The founding documents were signed on 5 March 1954, with the Ministry of Justice assenting to the founding and accepting the rules of the foundation on 8 March 1954.

The purpose of the foundation, as laid out in its rules, is to support activities intended to keep up the nationalistic spirit of sacrifice and the national defensive will, while also supporting the Knights of the Mannerheim Cross and their relatives.

<text>Sarah Louise &quot;Sadie&quot; Delany (September 19, 1889 – January 25, 1999) was an American educator and civil rights pioneer. She was the subject, along with her younger sister Bessie, of the oral history biography, &quot;Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters&#x27; First 100 Years&quot;, by journalist Amy Hill Hearth. Sadie was the first African American to teach domestic science at the high-school level in the New York public schools. With the publication of the book about the sisters, she became famous at the age of 103.

==Biography==
Sarah Louise Delany was born on September 19, 1889, in Lynch&#x27;s Station, Virginia. She was the second eldest of ten children born to the Rev. Henry Beard Delany (1858–1928), the first black person elected Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States, and Nanny Logan Delany (1861–1956), an educator. Rev. Delany was born into slavery in St. Mary&#x27;s, Georgia. Nanny Logan Delany was born in a community then known as Yak, Virginia, seven miles from Danville.

Delany was born in Lynch Station at the home of her mother&#x27;s sister, Eliza Logan. She was raised on the campus of St. Augustine&#x27;s School (now University) in Raleigh, North Carolina, where her father was the vice principal and her mother a teacher and administrator. Delany was a 1910 graduate of the school. In 1916, she moved to New York City, where she attended Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, then transferred to Columbia University where she earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education in 1920 and a master&#x27;s of education in 1925. She was a New York City schoolteacher until her retirement in 1960. She was the first black person permitted to teach domestic science on the high school level in New York City.

Delany died at the age of 109 in Mount Vernon, New York, where she resided in the final decades of her life. She is interred at Mount Hope Cemetery in Raleigh, North Carolina.

==The Delany Sisters==

In 1991, Delany and her sister Bessie were interviewed by journalist Amy Hearth, who wrote a feature story about them for &quot;The New York Times&quot; (&quot;Two &#x27;Maiden Ladies&#x27; With Century-Old Stories to Tell&quot;). A New York book publisher read Hearth&#x27;s newspaper story and asked her to write a full-length book on the sisters. Hearth and the sisters worked closely for two years to create the book, an oral history called &quot;Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters&#x27; First 100 Years&quot;, which dealt with the trials and tribulations the sisters had faced during their century of life. The book was on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller lists for 105 weeks. It spawned a Broadway play in 1995 and a television film in 1999. Both the play and film adaptations were produced by Judith R. James and Dr. Camille O. Cosby.

In 1994, the sisters and Hearth published &quot;The Delany Sisters&#x27; Book of Everyday Wisdom,&quot; a follow-up to &quot;Having Our Say.&quot; After Bessie&#x27;s death in 1995 at age 104, Sadie Delany and Hearth created a third book, &quot;On My Own At 107: Reflections on Life Without Bessie.&quot;

Her siblings were:
* Lemuel Thackara Delany (1887–1956)
* Annie Elizabeth (&quot;Bessie&quot;) Delany (1891–1995)
* Julia Emery Delany (1893–1974)
* Henry Delany, Jr. (1895–1991)
* Lucius Delany (1897–1969)
* William Manross Delany (1899–1955)
* Hubert Thomas Delany (1901–1990)
* Laura Edith Delany (1903–1993)
* Samuel Ray Delany (1906–1965)

Delany was the aunt of science fiction writer Samuel R. Delany Jr., the son of her youngest brother.

<text>Heinrich Schenker (19 June 1868 – 14 January 1935) was an Austrian music theorist whose writings have had a profound influence on subsequent musical analysis. His approach, now termed Schenkerian analysis, was most fully explained in a three-volume series, &quot;Neue musikalische Theorien und Phantasien&quot; (&quot;New Musical Theories and Phantasies&quot;), which included &quot;Harmony&quot; (1906), &quot;Counterpoint&quot; (1910; 1922), and &quot;Free Composition&quot; (1935).

Born in Wiśniowczyk, Austrian Galicia, he studied law at University of Vienna and music at what is now the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna where his teachers included Franz Krenn, Ernst Ludwig, Anton Bruckner, and Johann Nepomuk Fuchs. Despite his law degree, he focused primarily on a musical career following graduation, finding minimal success as a composer, conductor, and accompanist. After 1900 Schenker increasingly directed his efforts toward music theory, developing a systemic approach to analyze the underlying melodic and harmonic material of tonal music. His theories proposed the presence of fundamental structures (&quot;Ursatz&quot;) occurring in the background (&quot;Hintergrund&quot;) of compositions, which he illustrated with a variety of new specialized terms and notational methods.

Schenker&#x27;s views on race have come under scrutiny and criticism in the 21st century.

== Early years and education ==
Heinrich Schenker was born in Wiśniowczyk, Austrian Galicia in 1868 to Johann Schenker and his wife, Julia (&quot;née&quot; Mosler), both Jews. Schenker&#x27;s father was a doctor who had been allowed to settle in Wiśniowczyk, a village of only 1,759 inhabitants, according to the 1869 census. There is very little information about Schenker&#x27;s parents. Moriz Violin, Schenker&#x27;s life-long friend recalled Schenker describing &quot;the seriousness of the father and the hot temper of the mother&quot;.

Schenker was the fifth of six children: Markus (allegedly died 1880 in Lemberg); Rebeka (allegedly died 1889 in Gradiska); Wilhelm, a doctor; Schifre; and Moriz (Moses), born 31 August 1874. There is little documentation concerning Schenker&#x27;s childhood years. Schenker himself said nothing about his secondary-school education. His musical instincts must have been discovered at an early age, for he went to Lemberg (present-day Lviv, Ukraine) and studied with Carl Mikuli and then continued his studies in Berezhany.

Schenker received a scholarship to move to Vienna, where his family followed. Documents at the University of Vienna show him on the roster at the beginning of the 1884/85 season, where he pursued a law degree. In addition to his studies at the University of Vienna, he was enrolled at the Konservatorium of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde (today, the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna) from 1887 through 1890. His entrance examination results indicate that he initially studied composition with Franz Krenn and piano with Ernst Ludwig. Schenker and his father asked that he be exempted from the first year&#x27;s fees. Other documents indicate that in his first year, Schenker majored in harmony under Anton Bruckner. Schenker&#x27;s father died in 1887, leaving the family destitute.

Carl Flesch, also in attendance at the Konservatorium, left a description of Schenker as a student &quot;who seemed half-starved, and who towered far above the rest of us ... It was Heinrich Schenker, who later came to enjoy high esteem for his original musical theories and his all-embracing practical and theoretical musicality.&quot;

Schenker&#x27;s negative feelings toward Bruckner are revealed in a quote in his &quot;Harmony&quot; (1906, written nearly twenty years after instruction), in which he stated that &quot;If the teacher is unable to explain his own propositions ..., the student ... may be content not to understand the proffered doctrine ... The teacher closes his classes in harmony; he closes his classes in counterpoint, finishes them off in his own way; but not even the first step toward art has been taken.&quot; A footnote adds &quot;My teacher, a composer of high renown [Bruckner, obviously], used to say on such occasions: &quot;Segn&#x27;s, mein&#x27; Herrn, dass ist die Regl, i schreib&#x27; natirli not a so&quot;.&quot; In &quot;Counterpoint&quot;, vol. I, Schenker quotes examples from Bruckner&#x27;s works as examples of badly constructed lines. Schenker had better memories of Ernst Ludwig. Ludwig accepted Schenker on the basis of his initial scholarship. Upon seeing some of Schenker&#x27;s musical compositions, Ludwig recommended them to the pianist Julius Epstein. Ludwig sent students to study with Schenker, who remembered him fondly and thought he would have appreciated his &quot;Harmonielehre&quot; and &quot;Kontrapunkt&quot;.

In the 1888–89 season, Schenker studied counterpoint under Bruckner and continued piano study under Ludwig, always receiving the highest grades. The following season, Schenker joined the composition class of Johann Nepomuk Fuchs. He graduated on 20 November 1889 and was charged only half the fee for the school year (the fee paid by Ludwig Bösendorfer).

== Composer and performer ==
After graduating the University of Vienna with a law degree, Schenker devoted himself entirely to music. His first major opportunity came with Maximilian Harden, editor of &quot;Die Zukunft&quot; [The Future] who published his earliest writings. Publications in other periodicals followed. Surviving letters in Schenker&#x27;s archive suggest that during his schooling Schenker had no income and survived purely by gifts from supporters. He continued this practice after graduating. Schenker dedicated his Inventions op. 5 to Irene Graedener (maiden name Mayerhofer). On her death (9 August 1923), he recalled in his diary that it was at her house that he was able to find himself and realize his future calling. At this point in his career, Schenker saw himself primarily as a composer and tried to ingratiate himself as a means of promoting his compositions. Several letters attest to his meetings with Eduard Hanslick.

By 1900, Schenker was actively trying to promote his musical compositions as evidenced by correspondence with Ignaz Brüll, Karl Goldmark, Eugen d&#x27;Albert and Ferruccio Busoni. The dedications of his published compositions are another clue to the identities of those who were sympathetic and possibly gave money to enable Schenker&#x27;s works to be published, although there were probably more compositions than those conserved in the Oswald Jonas Memorial Collection at the University of California at Riverside. His Op. 1 carries a dedication to Julius Epstein, Op. 2 is dedicated to Ferruccio Busoni, Op. 4 is dedicated to Eugen d&#x27;Albert. D&#x27;Albert had promised to play some of Schenker&#x27;s works, and Busoni was particularly enthusiastic about the Fantasy, Op. 2. With letters from d&#x27;Albert, Brüll, Busoni, and Detlev von Liliencron, Schenker felt confident in promoting his compositions. Correspondence indicates that Schenker was in contact with Max Kalbeck, as the latter was trying to make introductions for him. Similar patronage is evidenced by the dedication on the &quot;Syrian Dances&quot; (without opus number), dedicated to Baron Alphonse de Rothschild. At Busoni&#x27;s insistence, the dances were orchestrated by Arnold Schoenberg and played on 5 June 1903, the ensemble led by Busoni.

The publication of Schenker&#x27;s &quot;Vorüber&quot; Op. 7, no. 3, in a collection sponsored by the Wiener Singakademie attests to a friendship between composer and the organization&#x27;s conductor, Carl Lafite.

In the final decade of the 19th century, Schenker was also active on the concert stage. He did not give solo recitals but participated as an accompanist or participant in chamber music, occasionally programming his own works. Programs exist showing that Schenker accompanied French horn virtuoso Louis Savart in Schenker&#x27;s &quot;Serenade für Waldhorn&quot; on 5 November 1893 (at the Salle der Börse) and 5 March 1894 (at the Bösendorfersaal). Schenker also was the accompanist for Lieder singer Johan Messchaert on a tour organized by the Ludwig Grünfeld Bureau whose stops included Klagenfurt (8 January), Graz (11 January), Trieste (13 January), Brünn (15 January), Lemberg (17 January), Vienna (19 January), Budapest (21 January), Linz (24 January), Vienna again (26 January), Ústí nad Labem (30 January) and again Budapest (3 February). This tour enabled Schenker to play his own pieces, namely the Fantasia op. 2 and the Allegretto grazioso from Op. 4, no. 2. Existing correspondence shows that Messchaert was highly appreciative. Schenker also accompanied the bass singer Eduard Gärtner on occasion, and Gärtner programmed Schenker&#x27;s song &quot;Meeresstille&quot; Op. 6, no. 3 and Blumengruß on a concert at the Bösendorfersaal on 19 January 1895. On a Gärtner recital 26 January 1900, Schenker and Moriz Violin gave the premiere of the &quot;Syrian Dances&quot;. On 1 December 1900, Gärtner, accompanied by Alexander von Zemlinsky, sang Schenker&#x27;s &quot;Wiegenlied&quot;, Op. 3 no. 2 and on 13 March 1902 Gärtner sang &quot;Ausklang&quot;, Op. 3, no. 4, and on 26 January 1905 at the Bösendorfersaal), Gärtner sang Op. 6, nos. 1 and 2.

In 1897, Schenker went on a tour to file performance reports from various places. He was disappointed in much of the new music he heard and documented it in the reviews he wrote.

== Theorist ==
Having failed to gain recognition as a composer, conductor, and accompanist, by 1900 he shifted his focus increasingly on problems of musical editing and music theory, though years later he still felt proud of his compositions. According to Federhofer, compositional activity for Schenker was not a means to an end in itself but a pedagogical one, a path to understanding the desires of a composer. Over time, Schenker saw how traditional understanding of music was disappearing and felt it necessary to revise music and theory lessons and remove later editorial additions from musical texts. Already in his 1895 article &quot;Der Geist der musikalischen Technik&quot; he spoke of the adulteration of contemporary music editions of classical composers and advocated the use of Urtext editions.

Already with his first publication, &quot;A Contribution to the Study of Ornamentation&quot;, Schenker understood his theoretical work to be a long-range pursuit. When he tried to get his &quot;Harmony&quot; (the first part of his &quot;New Musical Theory and Fantasies&quot;) published by Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, it was rejected, the publisher citing Hugo Riemann&#x27;s work to have covered all that was necessary. Max Kalbeck reported on his unsuccessful attempt to get the work published by N. Simrock. Though impressed by certain passages, the eventual publisher, Cotta, initially rejected Schenker&#x27;s manuscript but changed its mind after intervention from D&#x27;Albert. Cotta finally published &quot;Harmony&quot; anonymously with money from Alphonse de Rothschild to whom Schenker had given lessons.

The publisher Universal Edition&#x27;s proximity (they were in Vienna, where Schenker was living, while Cotta was in Stuttgart) made Schenker break with Cotta. Universal Edition was to remain Schenker&#x27;s main publisher. Schenker hoped his monograph on Beethoven&#x27;s 9th Symphony (published in 1912) would have a revelatory effect, but believed that the book&#x27;s reception would be clouded by musicians&#x27; faulty understanding, due to poor theoretical instruction. As he kept working on his &quot;New Musical Theory and Fantasies&quot;, the work kept growing.

Between 1913 and 1921, Schenker brought out an explanatory edition of four of the last five Beethoven sonatas. While examining the autograph to Beethoven&#x27;s Sonata, op. 109 (at that time belonging to the Wittgenstein family), Schenker mentioned in a letter to his friend Theodor von Frimmel how his Urtext work was inspired by Ernst Rudorff and Joseph Joachim. In 1912, Schenker wrote excitedly to Emil Hertzka, the head of Universal Edition, of the &quot;sensational new changes&quot; he would incorporate into his new edition of Beethoven&#x27;s Op. 109, having examined the autograph, a revised copy by Beethoven, the original edition and other later editions. Federhofer credits Schenker with initiating the modern Urtext movement of examining multiple authentic sources to arrive at a reading.

Even though &quot;Der Tonwille&quot; originally came out under the imprint &quot;Tonwille-Flutterverlag&quot; (actually published jointly by Albert J. Gutmann of Vienna and Friedrich Hofmeister of Leipzig), Universal Edition soon purchased Gutmann but still issued &quot;Der Tonwille&quot; under its original imprint. Schenker&#x27;s works presented a political challenge to Universal Edition: although they were developing their reputation as a promoter of contemporary music, it could be politically embarrassing for one of their authors (Schenker) to rally against their primary clientele.

Beginning with the publication of &quot;Der Tonwille&quot; in 1921, a Latin motto appears on all of Schenker published works: &quot;Semper idem sed non eodem modo&quot; (&quot;always the same, but not always in the same way&quot;). William Pastille proposed that this is based on a line in Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot;, Book 8, chapter 3: &quot;nam tu semper idem, quia ea quae non-semper nec eodem modo sunt eodem modo semper nosti omnia&quot; (&quot;For you [are] always the same thing, because you know in the same way all those things that are not the same nor in the same way&quot;). Based on conversation with an unnamed Latin scholar, William Helmcke added that it could also be based on a passage from Irenaeus&#x27;s &quot;Adversus Haereses&quot; (&quot;Against Heresies&quot;): &quot;sine initio et sine fine, vere et semper idem et eodem modo se habens solus est Deus&quot; (&quot;Without beginning and without end, only God continues truly and always the same and in the same way&quot;).

Emil Hertzka, the head of Universal Edition from 1907 until his death in 1932, had a fraught relationship with Schenker. When Schenker was planning a diatribe against Paul Bekker whose monograph on Beethoven was very popular at the time, Hertzka refused to consider publishing it, noting that Bekker and he were close friends. Various passages in issues of &quot;Der Tonwille&quot; had to be removed because Hertzka felt they were too politically and socially sensitive. Schenker recalled a standoff with Hertzka, where Hertzka, took a &quot;pacifist attitude towards international relations, cosmopolitan, democratic beliefs, working toward compromises&quot;. Over time, Schenker&#x27;s attitude toward Hertzka and Universal Edition increased from disagreement to hostility, charging the firm with not doing enough to promote his work and accused them of not paying him the proper amount.

He had already admired his student Hans Weisse for leaving Vienna for Munich and also noted positively on his other students&#x27; desire to move to Germany. In 1931, Hans Weisse left for New York City, where he and subsequently fellow protégé Felix Salzer established Schenkerian analysis as a core curriculum and practice at the Mannes School of Music. Wilhelm Furtwängler called upon Karl Straube to see whether Schenker might be able to teach in Munich. But Schenker never left Vienna and was unable to obtain a position elsewhere, in part due to the nature of his uncompromising views.

Schenker&#x27;s personal life was taken up with his marriage to Jeanette Kornfeld (born Schiff). He knew her from at least 1907 but could only marry after her first husband agreed to divorce. Schenker married Jeanette on 10 November 1919. He dedicated &quot;Free Composition&quot;, his last work, to her. They had no children.

Schenker could also count on the patronage of a group of supporters. Alphonse de Rothschild was mentioned above. In addition, there were Sophie Deutsch, Angi Elias, Wilhelm Furtwängler, an industrialist named Khuner, and Anthony van Hoboken. Deutsch, Elias and Hoboken were in his immediate circle of students. Deutsch, who died in a sanatarium in 1917, left an inheritance that enabled Schenker to publish the second volume of his counterpoint book (1922) and named him to a society of destitute artists. Other funding came from Robert Brünauer, one of Schenker&#x27;s students and the owner of a chocolate manufacturing firm (Brünauer had introduced the artist Victor Hammer to Schenker). Not only was Hoboken instrumental in setting up the Photogrammarchivs von Meisterhandschriften in the Austrian National Library, but he was responsible for paying for the publication of volume 2 of &quot;Das Meisterwerk&quot; and &quot;Free Composition&quot;.

Furtwängler consulted with Schenker as if a student. In a letter to Alphonse de Rothschild, Schenker wrote that Furtwängler&#x27;s interest was first aroused by Schenker&#x27;s monograph on Beethoven&#x27;s 9th Symphony, and that since then

In all the years he has never failed to visit me, spend hours with me and all sorts of to learn from me. He describes himself as one of my students, and that fills me with no little pride.

In 1908, Schenker had hoped for an appointment at the Akademie für Musik und darstellende Kunst (today the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna). However, the conflict between his beliefs and the need to compromise to work within an academic system ultimately thwarted the opportunity. Even as late as 1932–33, Furtwängler tried to intercede with Ludwig Karpath to obtain a position for Schenker, without success. Despite the lack of success, Schenker was gratified by Furtwängler&#x27;s words.

Schenker never taught in a school but most often taught in his house at the piano. His fees were not inexpensive, but he demonstrated a fierce loyalty to his students. Though he could be unsparing in his criticism, the goal of his teaching was on the acquisition of a comprehensive musical education intertwined with the art of performance, as they were dependent on each other. Understanding the artwork was the object and purpose of his teaching, where theory and practice were an inseparable unity.

== Declining health and death ==

In his later years Schenker complained of fatigue. He and Jeanette would spend summers usually in the Tyrolean mountains, most often in the town Galtür. In his correspondence with Victor Hammer, Schenker revealed that he was very near-sighted which hindered him from obtaining a better understanding of painting. Additionally he suffered from goiter and obesity, reasons for which he was granted a permanent exemption from military service. Already in 1914, he had been diagnosed with diabetes which necessitated frequent visits to the doctor and an enforced diet (which Schenker did not always keep).

Even towards the end of life, Schenker worked steadily. He corrected proofs for &quot;Free Composition&quot; from 16 to 23 December 1934. He commented negatively on a radio broadcast of 30 December 1934, but then heard Johann Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; in a live broadcast from the Vienna State Opera and declared it a &quot;most brilliant performance&quot;. On a medical examination of 4 January 1935, he received an unfavorable report, noting symptoms including the swelling of his feet and extreme thirst. He was taken to a sanatorium for an insulin therapy.

Jeanette recorded Schenker&#x27;s final moments in his diary:
From within a slight stupor I heard him say &quot;... From...&quot; &quot;From what?&quot; I say, &quot;we&#x27;ll still be with one another&quot; – and I make a sudden gesture, because I did not understand. He continued: &quot;from... from the St. Matthew Passion something occurred to me...&quot; These were the last words of my beloved. 
Schenker died on 14 January 1935, age 66 at 2 AM, the cause of death listed as diabetes and arteriosclerosis. He was buried on 17 January at the Wiener Zentralfriedhof, Gate 4, Group 3, Series 4, number 8. The inscription on his grave reads: &quot;Hier ruht, der die Seele der Musik vernommen, ihre Gesetze im Sinne der Großen verkündet wie Keiner vor ihm&quot; (Here lies he who examined and revealed the laws concerning the soul of music like none other before him).

Jeanette Schenker stayed in Vienna after the Anschluss. Persecuted for being Jewish, she was rescued twice from the Nazis before being arrested and transported on 29 June 1942. She died in Theresienstadt on 8 January 1945.

==Schenker&#x27;s views on race==
Schenker&#x27;s views on race generated controversy within music theory circles since his own lifetime and drew renewed scrutiny after a 2020 publication by American music theorist Philip Ewell. Ewell wrote that Schenker believed Black people were incapable of self-governance, and that he opposed racial intermarriage on grounds of &quot;mongrelization&quot;. Ewell further considered that Schenker&#x27;s views on these issues were &quot;whitewashed&quot; by academic music theorists of the late twentieth century. Others, however, among them professor of music theory Timothy L. Jackson, answered that these interpretations are based on mistranslations, misinterpretations and omissions, and that Schenker was in fact a critic of racist theories, viewing them as pseudoscientific.

Ewell&#x27;s publication has also been criticized by linguist and instructor of music history at Columbia University John McWhorter, who in &quot;Substack&quot; said that while &quot;[Schenker] was a genius – and also an open racist who wrote extensively of his sentiments thereabout in uncompromising language.&quot; but argued, &quot;If Ewell&#x27;s claim is that music is racist when involving hierarchical relationships between elements, then we must ask where that puts a great deal of music created by non-white people. Perhaps more important, the question is: just what do these hierarchical relationships in music structure have to do with human suffering?&quot;

<doc id="211103" wikidata="Q203184" url="?curid=211103" title="First lady">
<text>First Lady or First Gentleman is an unofficial title usually used for the spouse, and occasionally used for the offspring or other relative, of a non-monarchical head of state or chief executive. The term is also used to describe a person seen to be at the top of her profession or art.

The title has also been used for the spouse of a head of government who is not also head of state. It has also been used to refer to the spouses of the leaders of administrative divisions within a country. The title is often used for the wives of Christian pastors in denominations where married clergy are the norm.

==History==
It has been noted that the earliest use of the term &quot;first lady&quot; is in reference to person of a high ranking or outstanding person in their field, and that the term, as used to describe the spouse of the president of the United States, saw its first documented use in 1838 in reference to Martha Washington, who was never referred to as such during George Washington&#x27;s time as president.

The first person to have been referred to as &quot;first lady&quot; on a regular basis during their time in the position was Harriet Lane, who was actually James Buchanan&#x27;s niece, as Buchanan was a lifelong bachelor.

==Variations==

The male equivalent of the title in countries where the head of state&#x27;s spouse has been a man, such as the Philippines or Malta, is first gentleman. In 2020, Doug Emhoff, spouse of Vice President Kamala Harris, became the first male spouse of a U.S. vice president. &quot;First gentleman&quot; is used in the United States for the male spouse of a mayor or governor.

First spouse and first partner, both rare variations of the title, can be used in either case where the spouse of a political leader is of any gender. This term is used to promote gender equality and gender neutrality.

In the United States, collectively, the president of the United States and his spouse are known as the &quot;first couple&quot; and, if they have children, they are usually referred to as the &quot;first family&quot;.

==Use in non-English speaking countries==

French-speaking countries have used the term &quot;première dame&quot; for first ladies, regardless of where the first lady is from. At least one article, published in 2017, used the term &quot;premier monsieur&quot; for first gentleman. For that particular article, it was used to discuss the possibility of Louis Aliot becoming first gentleman, should his domestic partner, Marine Le Pen, win that year&#x27;s presidential election. Emmanuel Macron defeated Le Pen in that year&#x27;s election.

Portuguese-speaking countries have used the term &quot;primeira-dama&quot; or &quot;Primeira Dama&quot; for first ladies. The term is used regardless of where the person is from. The term &quot;primeiro-cavalheiro&quot; is used for first gentlemen.

In Spanish-speaking countries, the term &quot;primera dama&quot; is used for first ladies, regardless of the country the person is from. The term &quot;primer caballero&quot; has been used for first gentlemen.

Sinophone countries have used the term 第一夫人 (&quot;dìyī fūrén&quot;) as a term for first ladies, also without regards as to where the first lady is from.

=====Soviet Union=====
It has been noted that Soviet leaders generally preferred to keep their wives and families out of the spotlight, resulting in &quot;invisible first ladies&quot;.

====Ukraine====

====Armenia====
The wife of the president of Armenia has been referred to as &quot;Հայաստանի Առաջին տիկին&quot; (&quot;Hayastani Arrajin tikin&quot;). The term &quot;first lady&quot; has also been used. The spouse of the current president, however, is only referred to as &quot;հանրապետության նախագահի տիկին&quot; (&quot;hanrapetut&#x27;yan nakhagahi tikin&quot;), or &quot;wife of the president of Armenia&quot;.

====India====

First Lady of India or First Gentleman of India is the title given to the host of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, usually the spouse of the president of India.

==== Vietnam ====
Currently, the spouse of the President of Vietnam is called &quot;phu nhân chủ tịch nước&quot; (lit: wife of the state president). The term &quot;đệ nhất phu nhân&quot; (lit: first lady) is also unofficially used by the press and on social media.

==Non-spousal uses==
In some situations, the title is bestowed upon a non-spouse.

The pair subsequently married in 2021.

Not all non-married partners of Colorado governors are called first lady or first gentleman, as Robin Pringle was referred to by &quot;The Denver Post&quot; as John Hickenlooper&#x27;s girlfriend prior to their marriage.

====Puerto Rico====
After taking office as Puerto Rico&#x27;s first female governor, Governor Sila María Calderón appointed her two daughters, Sila María González Calderón and María Elena González Calderón, to serve as first ladies.

==Non-political uses==
It has become commonplace in the United States for the title of &quot;first lady&quot; to be bestowed on women, as a term of endearment, who have proven themselves to be of exceptional talent or unique notoriety in non-political areas. The phrase is often, but not always, used when the person in question is either the wife or &quot;female equivalent&quot; of a well-known man (or men) in a similar field. For example, the term has been applied in the entertainment field to denote the &quot;first lady of television&quot; (Lucille Ball), the &quot;first lady of song&quot; (Ella Fitzgerald), the &quot;first lady of country music&quot; (Tammy Wynette, although Loretta Lynn was also known by the title), the &quot;first lady of &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot; (actor/producer Majel Barrett), the &quot;first lady of American soul&quot; (Aretha Franklin), the &quot;first lady of the Grand Ole Opry&quot; (Loretta Lynn), &quot;the first lady of American cinema&quot; (Lillian Gish), the &quot;first lady of the American stage&quot; (Helen Hayes), and &quot;the first lady of (American) football&quot; (Norma Hunt).

The term has also been used to refer to wives of college and university presidents in some cases.

The term &quot;first lady&quot; is also used to denote a woman who occupies the foremost social position within a particular locality, in this sense being particularly popular in Africa, where the pre-eminent female noble in some chieftaincy hierarchies, such as those of the Yoruba people, is often referred to by the title.

In recent years, the term has also been used to refer to the wife of the pastor of a church, especially in predominantly black churches.

<text>Axel Erik Heinrichs (21 July 1890 – 16 November 1965) was a Finnish military general. He was Finland&#x27;s Chief of the General Staff during the Interim Peace and Continuation War (1940–1941 and 1942–1944) and Chief of Defence for a short time after the war (1945).

==Biography==
Heinrichs went to the Swedish co-educational school Nya svenska samskolan. He was one of the Finnish Jaeger troops trained in the volunteer Royal Prussian 27th Jäger Battalion between 1915 and 1918. During the Finnish Civil War he served as a battalion commander in the battles of Tampere and Viipuri. He commanded the III Corps in the Winter War, and from 19 February 1940 the Army of the Isthmus. He was made Chief of the General Staff in June 1940 and promoted to General of Infantry in 1941.

During the Continuation War he commanded the Army of Karelia until January 1942, after which he was again appointed the Chief of the General Staff. After the war he served as the Army&#x27;s commander-in-chief but was forced to resign because of the Weapons Cache Case. In 1944 Heinrichs became the second person to receive the Mannerheim Cross, First Class. He was also a recipient of the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross.

Heinrichs was one of the military experts of the delegation sent by president Paasikivi to Moscow for the Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance in 1948.

Heinrichs was also a praised author of which his book on Gustaf Mannerheim is considered his best. He was made an honorary doctor at University of Helsinki.

<text>Bragi Ólafsson (born 11 August 1962 in Reykjavík, Iceland) is an Icelandic musician and a writer.

Internationally he is best known for his work as a bassist in The Sugarcubes, the avant-garde pop band from Iceland that brought fame to Björk, who went on to solo success with her unique brand of diverse musical genres.

The Sugarcubes, who favoured strange, offbeat melodies, came together in 1986, but the Sugarcubes&#x27; members had played together in different combinations in various Icelandic groups before. Bragi and Einar Örn Benediktsson (trumpet / vocals) had released records on Einar&#x27;s own label, Gramm. In 1986 Bragi also launched his writing career, publishing his first book, a poetry volume called &quot;Dragsúgur&quot; (Draught).

In 1992 The Sugarcubes disbanded as Björk began her solo career. Bragi, meanwhile, has continued to work on Bad Taste Ltd., the company formed by the Sugarcubes to publish poetry and sign other bands but is no longer a practising musician.

He enjoys considerable success as a novelist, playwright and poet in Iceland, having twice been nominated to the Icelandic Literature Prize.

<text>Thomas Jefferson University is a private research university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Established in its earliest form in 1824, the university officially combined with Philadelphia University in 2017. The university is named for U.S. Founding Father
and president Thomas Jefferson. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

To signify its heritage, the university sometimes carries the nomenclature &quot;Jefferson (Philadelphia University + Thomas Jefferson University)&quot; in its branding.

==History==
===Philadelphia University===
Philadelphia University was originally known as Philadelphia Textile School when it was founded in 1884, and then Philadelphia Textile Institute for 20 years (1942–1961), Philadelphia College of Textiles &amp; Science for 38 years (1962–1999), and Philadelphia University for 18 years (1999–2017), its final name before merger with Thomas Jefferson University. At the 1876 Centennial Exposition, local textile manufacturers noticed that Philadelphia&#x27;s textile industry was falling behind its rivals&#x27; capacity, technology, and ability. In 1880, they formed the Philadelphia Association of Manufacturers of Textile Fabrics, with Theodore C. Search as its president, to fight for higher tariffs on imported textiles and to educate local textile leaders. Search joined the board of directors of the Philadelphia Museum and School of Industrial Art (now the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the University of the Arts), thinking it the perfect partner for his plans for a school, and began fundraising in 1882.

In early 1884, Search himself taught the first classes of the Philadelphia Textile School to five students at 1336 Spring Garden Street. The school was officially opened on November 5, 1884. The school moved to 1303-1307 Buttonwood Street in 1891, then moved again in 1893.

Enrollment had been growing steadily and the school was turning away &quot;bright young fellows&quot; for lack of space. The school acquired the former Philadelphia Institute of the Deaf and Dumb on the corner of Broad and Spruce Streets, which allowed rapid expansion of academic offerings and capacity of students.

In 1942, the school was granted the right to award baccalaureate degrees and changed its name to the Philadelphia Textile Institute (PTI). In 1949, having decided to break its ties with the museum, PTI moved to its present site in the East Falls section of Philadelphia.

In 1961, the school changed its name again, to Philadelphia College of Textiles &amp; Science, but was still known as Philadelphia Textile for short. The university&#x27;s student population doubled between 1954 and 1964, and doubled again by 1978, with programs in the arts, sciences, and business administration being introduced. The college purchased an adjoining property in 1972, doubling the size of its campus. In 1976, it offered its first graduate degree, the Master of Business Administration. The purchase of additional properties in East Falls in 1980 and 1988 nearly doubled the campus again, adding classrooms, research laboratories, student residences, and athletic facilities. In 1992, the Paul J. Gutman Library opened.

During the 1990s, the college began to offer undergraduate majors in a wider range of fields, resulting in the college being granted university status by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1999. The board of trustees voted to change the college&#x27;s name to Philadelphia University, on July 13, 1999. The school preferred the longer abbreviation of &quot;PhilaU&quot;, rather than the simple two-letter abbreviation of &quot;PU&quot;, due to the latter&#x27;s oft-mocked connection with other &quot;PU&quot;-abbreviated schools as an onomatopoetic term for body odor.

===Thomas Jefferson University===

Thomas Jefferson University began as a medical school. During the early 19th century, several attempts to create a second medical school in Philadelphia had been stymied, largely by University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine alumni. In an attempt to circumvent that opposition, a group of Philadelphia physicians led by George McClellan sent an 1824 letter to the trustees of Jefferson College (now Washington &amp; Jefferson College) in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, asking them to establish a medical department in Philadelphia. The trustees agreed, establishing the Medical Department of Jefferson College in Philadelphia in 1825. In response to a second request, the Pennsylvania General Assembly granted an expansion of Jefferson College&#x27;s charter in 1826, endorsing the creation of the new department and allowing it to grant medical degrees. An additional 10 Jefferson College trustees, including Joel Barlow Sutherland, were appointed to supervise the new facility from Philadelphia, owing to the difficulty of managing a medical department on the other side of the state. Two years later, this second board was granted authority to manage the Medical Department, while the Jefferson College trustees maintained veto power for major decisions.

The first class was graduated in 1826, receiving their degrees only after the disposition of a lawsuit seeking to close the school. The first classes were held in the Tivoli Theater on Prune Street in Philadelphia, which had the first medical clinic attached to a medical school. Owing to the teaching philosophy of Dr. McClellan, classes focused on clinical practice. In 1828, the Medical Department moved to the Ely Building, which allowed for a large lecture space and the &quot;Pit,&quot; a 700-seat amphitheater to allow students to view surgeries. This building had an attached hospital, the second such medical school/hospital arrangement in the nation, servicing 441 inpatients and 4,659 outpatients in its first year of operation. The relationship with Jefferson College survived until 1838, when the Medical Department received a separate charter, allowing it to operate separately as the Jefferson Medical College. At this time, all instructors, including McClellan, were vacated from the school and the trustees hired all new individuals to teach. This has been considered the time at which the school came to be considered a &quot;legitimate&quot; medical school.

In 1841, Jefferson Medical College hired what would be dubbed &quot;The Faculty of &#x27;41&quot;, an influential collection of professors including Charles Delucena Meigs and Mütter Museum founder Thomas Dent Mütter. This collection of professors would institute numerous changes to Jefferson—including providing patient beds over a shop at 10th and Sansom Streets in 1844—and the staff would remain unchanged for 15 years. The graduating class of 1849 included a son of college founder Joel Barlow Sutherland, Charles Sutherland, who went on to serve as Surgeon General of the United States Army.
In 1882, a &quot;Philadelphia Press&quot; newspaper story sparked a sensational trial after a journalist caught body snatchers stealing corpses and providing them to Jefferson Medical College for use as cadavers by medical students. Four grave robbers were arrested and sentenced to Moyamensing Prison for stealing bodies and selling them to Jefferson Medical College at the rate of $8 a body. After the arrests, it was determined that the body snatching had been going on for nine years and several hundred corpses had been sold to Jefferson Medical College.

The renowned surgeon and Jefferson Medical College anatomy professor, William S. Forbes, was arrested for his role in the grave robbery but was acquitted Forbes helped write the 1867 Pennsylvania Law named the &quot;Anatomy Act&quot; which called for hospitals, prisons and mental health wards to provide the bodies of those that had no family or funds for burial to medical schools for anatomical research.

Due in part to the Lebanon Cemetery grave robbery scandal, the Pennsylvania Anatomy Act of 1883 was passed which provided for legal means by which medical colleges could obtain cadavers without having to buy them from grave robbers.

A 125-bed hospital, one of the first in the nation affiliated with a medical school, opened in 1877, and a school for nurses began in 1891. The Medical College became Thomas Jefferson University on July 1, 1969. As an academic health care center, Jefferson is currently involved in education, medical research, and patient care. Jefferson Medical College is the 9th oldest American medical school that is in existence today.

In January 2007, the university sold Thomas Eakins&#x27; painting &quot;The Gross Clinic&quot;, which depicts a surgery that took place at the school, for $68 million, to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, in association with the Philadelphia Museum of Art. A reproduction hangs in its place at Jefferson University.

On June 17, 2014, Sidney Kimmel Foundation donated $110 million to Jefferson Medical College, prompting the announcement that Jefferson Medical College would be renamed Sidney Kimmel Medical College. It was the largest donation received in its history.

===Merger===
In May 2017, Thomas Jefferson University and Philadelphia University announced that they would merge under the name Thomas Jefferson University.

=== Affiliations ===
Latrobe Hospital, as well as other hospitals, are affiliated with the Jefferson Medical College.

==Academics==


Jefferson offers 160+ undergraduate and graduate programs, including the Sidney Kimmel Medical College and former Philadelphia University&#x27;s flagship colleges:

*College of Architecture and the Built Environment
*Kanbar College of Design, Engineering and Commerce
*School of Continuing and Professional Studies

==Campus==
There are two campuses and a research center.

===East Falls===

The university&#x27;s East Falls wooded campus is located about eight miles northwest of Center City, Philadelphia, accessible by two of SEPTA&#x27;s Regional Rail lines. The campus consists of 52 buildings, including classrooms, laboratories, studios, the Paul J. Gutman Library, student resident facilities, an exhibition gallery, and some major additions early in the 21st Century, the Kanbar Campus Center for students, faculty and staff; the Gallagher Athletic, Recreation and Convocation Center; the SEED Center (certified LEED Gold Center for Sustainability, Energy Efficiency and Design), and the innovative DEC Center. A subsidiary campus is located in Bucks County.

===Center City===
The university&#x27;s Center City Philadelphia campus, medical offices, and hospital (called Jefferson Health) are headquartered at 130 South Ninth Street and surrounding city blocks.

===Manayunk Research Center===
In addition to its major properties, Jefferson runs the Philadelphia University Research Center, which is housed in a restored textile mill (originally opened in 1864) in the Manayunk section of Philadelphia, just south of the main campus. The research center contains both the Engineering and Design Institute and the Laboratory for Engineered Human Protection.

==Athletics==
Jefferson&#x27;s athletic teams are called the Rams. The college is a member of the NCAA Division II ranks, primarily competing as a member of the Central Atlantic Collegiate Conference (CACC) since the 2005–06 academic year; while its women&#x27;s golf and women&#x27;s rowing teams compete as Independents. The Rams previously competed in the East Coast Conference (originally known as the New York Collegiate Athletic Conference until 2006) from 1991–92 to 2004–05.

Jefferson sponsors 17 varsity intercollegiate teams: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

The merged school chose to retain PhilaU&#x27;s nickname and the athletic program follows the overall institution in using the branding of &quot;Jefferson&quot; when describing the university as a whole.

<text>Giessen (Landkreis Giessen in German) () is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the middle of Hessen, Germany. Neighboring districts are Marburg-Biedenkopf, Vogelsbergkreis, Wetteraukreis, and Lahn-Dill.

==History==
In 1821 the Grand Duchy of Hesse created districts (called &quot;Landratsbezirke&quot;) in the reorganisation of its internal administration. In the area of today&#x27;s district the districts of Giessen and Grünberg were created. 1822 another district called Hungen was created. In 1832 these entities were replaced with bigger structures, now called &quot;Kreis&quot;. There were still two districts, Giessen und Grünberg. 1837 several municipalities moved from Grünberg to Giessen, and Grünberg in exchange acquired some municipalities from Hungen, which became a district again in 1841.

After the revolutionary uprisings of 1848, the districts were dissolved and replaced with a &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; Giessen, but just four years later, the districts were recreated. After the war of 1866, the north-western part of the district became part of Prussia. In 1874, the district grew in size again.

In 1938, the city of Giessen was excluded from the district, and with the dissolution of the district Schotten, several municipalities joined the district.

After two minor changes in 1967 and 1971, in 1977, the district was merged with the districts Wetzlar and Dillkreis to form the new Lahn-Dill-Kreis. In 1979, it was split again, and the district Giessen was recreated. The city Giessen—temporarily merged with Wetzlar to the city &quot;Lahn&quot;—was included into the district.

==Geography==
The main river of the district is the Lahn, which crosses the district from north to south.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows a wooden triangle in the top, depicting the traditional house style. In the bottom there is the symbol of the Saint Antonius order, which founded a monastery in Grünberg in 1242, and also supported the foundation of the university on Giessen in 1607.

<text>InMe are an English alternative rock/metal band originally formed in Brentwood, Essex in 1996. They have released seven studio albums, two EPs, one bootleg album, one best-of compilation, one live album, one live EP and an acoustic album. A DVD of the band&#x27;s &quot;Overgrown Eden&quot; show at the Highbury Garage in November 2010 was released via PledgeMusic as a part of the band&#x27;s campaign for their fifth album &quot;The Pride&quot;. The band has had eight singles appear on the UK Top 100 Singles Chart. The band are open about the fact that they all have day jobs, and ask fans to support them financially.

==History==

===Formation (1996–2000)===
The group originally formed as Drowned in 1996 when many of the band were just 14 years old. The members of the band at that time were Dave McPherson as guitarist / vocalist, Joe Morgan as bassist / backing vocalist and Simon Taylor as drummer. They played several local venues, getting their first interviews and airplay on Brentwood-based radio station, Phoenix FM. They recorded many unreleased tracks such as &quot;acid drop&quot; and &quot;apricot&quot; The band scored their break when a scout from MFN caught the end of one of their sets, whilst attending a gig to see another band called -ism. They signed with MFN in 2001, and changed their name to InMe to avoid confusion with Drowned, an American Christian rock band of the same name.

===Overgrown Eden (2001–2003)===
&quot;Overgrown Eden&quot; was released through Music for Nations in January 2003, after numerous delays. It reached No. 15 in the UK Albums Chart, and No. 1 in the UK Rock Albums Chart.

Four singles were released from &quot;Overgrown Eden&quot;. These were &quot;Underdose&quot;, &quot;Firefly&quot;, &quot;Crushed Like Fruit&quot; and &quot;Neptune&quot;, the first three of these being issued before the album. &quot;Underdose&quot; was released in July 2002 and entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 66. This was followed by &quot;Firefly&quot; in September which peaked at No. 43. &quot;Crushed Like Fruit&quot; appeared in January 2003, charting at No. 25. &quot;Neptune&quot; was the last single released from the album in April 2003, charting at No. 46, and was accompanied with a video featuring fans at a live gig.

Music for Nations went out of business during 2004, when they were absorbed into a parent company. During this time the rights for &quot;Overgrown Eden&quot; were lost, and because of this, the album was eventually re-released in June 2006 when those rights were re-obtained. InMe played &quot;Overgrown Eden&quot; in its entirety in two separate dates in November 2010 as a part of a greatest hits tour to support their &quot;best-of&quot; album &quot;Phoenix: The Best Of InMe&quot;. The London show was recorded and was initially intended to be released through Sony BMG as a part of a re-release of Overgrown Eden. The DVD was eventually released through Graphite Records in 2012 along with the band&#x27;s 5th Album &quot;The Pride&quot;.

===White Butterfly (2004–2005)===
Their second album, &quot;White Butterfly&quot;, was released on 20 June 2005. It was released in two forms in the UK, a standard edition with thirteen tracks, and a limited edition with two bonus tracks &quot;Every Whisper Aches&quot; and &quot;Angels with Snipers&quot;. The first single from &quot;White Butterfly&quot; was &quot;Faster The Chase&quot; in 2004, when the band were still with MFN. Before the release of the album, there was a leak where several tracks, due to be released for the first time on the album were downloaded. The first in-store single to be released on the new label was &quot;7 Weeks&quot; which reached No. 36 in the UK chart, whilst the second single, &quot;So You Know&quot;, peaked at No. 33. The release of &quot;White Butterfly&quot; was sandwiched between a tour of the UK. &quot;White Butterfly&quot; was produced by Josh Abraham and Colin Richardson.

The band released a double A-side download single &quot;White Butterfly&quot; / &quot;Safe In a Room&quot; on 19 December 2005, with a five-track live EP.

&quot;White Butterfly&quot; was played in its entirety at two of InMe&#x27;s shows on their greatest hits tour in November 2010.

===Caught: White Butterfly and Daydream Anonymous (2005–2007)===

A live album, titled &quot;Caught: White Butterfly&quot; was recorded at the London Astoria in December 2005, and released in August 2006.

In 2006, Joe Morgan left the band following the end of the tour cycle for White Butterfly and went to study at university, being replaced by Dave&#x27;s younger brother Greg McPherson.

In September 2007, InMe released their third album &quot;Daydream Anonymous&quot;. It charted in the UK at No. 71, making it the lowest charting InMe album to date. &quot;Daydream Anonymous&quot; featured thirteen tracks. &quot;I Won&#x27;t Let Go&quot; was released as the only single. &quot;Daydream Anonymous&quot; was played in its entirety on two nights of InMe&#x27;s greatest hits tour in December.

It was released on 14 September through Graphite Records, and peaked at No. 68 in the UK chart. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Single of the Weak&quot;, was released on 17 August.

&quot;Herald Moth&quot; was InMe&#x27;s first album as a four piece band, following the addition of Ben Konstantinovic in 2008. The band toured extensively through Europe from early 2009 to 2010, and saw Konstantinovic leaving in October 2009, to be replaced by Gazz Marlow in February the following year.

<text>Nicolas Ruwet (31 December 1932 – 15 November 2001) was a Belgian linguist, literary critic and musical analyst. He was involved with the development of generative grammar.

==Biography==
Ruwet was born in Saive in Belgium and studied philology in Liège. Later he studied with Claude Lévi-Strauss and later still with Noam Chomsky and Roman Jakobson, both influences, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He studied music privately.

Ruwet is best known for his work as a linguist and critic, but he was also a significant figure in musical analysis. He attempted to make his analyses completely objective by not making any &quot;a priori&quot; assumptions about how the music worked, instead breaking the piece down into small parts and seeing how those parts related to each other, thus discovering the syntax of the piece without reference to any external sources or norms. His work in this field constitutes a kind of musical semiology and his analytical methods were later named paradigmatic analysis.

Some of his musical analyses were published along with other works in &quot;Langage, musique, poésie&quot; [&quot;Speech, music, poetry&quot;] (1972).

Ruwet died in Paris.

<text>Derek Robert Nimmo (19 September 1930 – 24 February 1999) was an English character actor, producer and author. He is best remembered for his comedic upper class &quot;silly ass&quot; and clerical roles including Revd Mervyn Noote in the BBC1 sitcom &quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot; (1966–71).

==Career==
Nimmo was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, the son of an insurance salesman, and grew up in Mossley Hill in an environment he described as &quot;old merchants&#x27; houses, comfy English suburbia&quot;. He was educated at Booker Avenue Infants and Junior School as well as Quarry Bank High School for Boys, then a grammar school under headmaster R. F. Bailey, who brought with him, from his previous position as assistant headmaster at leading independent school Shrewsbury School, &quot;the finest traditions of public schools&quot;. He then followed his father into the insurance business, and after National Service in Cyprus, became a salesman for a paint company. He began his stage career at the Hippodrome Theatre in Bolton, Lancashire. It was during this time that he made a cameo appearance in the Beatles&#x27; film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (in which he appeared as &quot;Leslie Jackson&quot;, a magician with doves).

He appeared in a number of British films and television series, as aristocrats, including starring roles in the television comedy series &quot;The World of Wooster&quot; (as &quot;Bingo Little&quot;), and in the comedy film &quot;One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing&quot; (as &quot;Lord Southmere&quot;), as well as appearing in the James Bond spoof film &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.

Nimmo made his name as the Reverend Mervyn Noote in the British sitcom &quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot; (1966). At the time it was considered rather controversial because the main characters were senior churchmen (the Bishop, his chaplain Noote and the Archdeacon) who got into various scrapes as a result of their general incompetence. By the time the series finished, Nimmo was identified with the stereotype of a traditional British clergyman and he went on to play a bungling monk in another BBC clerical sitcom, &quot;Oh, Brother!&quot;, and a Roman Catholic priest in its sequel series, &quot;Oh, Father!&quot; In 1969, Nimmo received an award for his performances in both sitcoms, when the Royal Television Society awarded him a silver medal. Another sitcom in which he appeared in a starring role as a clergyman, many years later, was &quot;Hell&#x27;s Bells&quot; (by now promoted to a dean) which ran for one series in 1986. He also appeared as the Reverend Jonathan Green in a television production of &quot;Cluedo&quot;. He became so well known for his clerical parody that, in the 1975 &quot;The Goodies&quot; episode &quot;Wacky Wales&quot;, a &quot;team of Derek Nimmos&quot; played in a spoof &quot;Ecclesiastical Rugby Sevens&quot; competition. 

In 1966, he appeared in the second series of &quot;The Bed-Sit Girl&quot;. Nimmo appeared on stage in many West End plays and starred in the musical &quot;Charlie Girl&quot;, which contained a scene specially written to allow him to perform his party trick of wiggling his toes. He also became a regular panellist on the popular BBC radio show &quot;Just a Minute&quot;, and had a chat show on BBC Television, &quot;If It&#x27;s Saturday, It Must Be Nimmo&quot;, from 24 October to 19 December 1970, though it was felt that he seemed less at ease as a chat show host. Having been away from television for some time, he made an appearance in the Australian television series &quot;Neighbours&quot; in 1990, playing Lord Ledgerwood alongside Madge and Harold Bishop.

As a theatrical impresario, he took his own touring production (Intercontinental Entertainment) to 30 countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, Oman and the UAE, and so provided himself with material for many stories on &quot;Just a Minute&quot;.

In the 1970s, Nimmo sang the jingle &quot;P…p…pick up a Penguin&quot; in a series of television advertisements for McVitie&#x27;s Penguin biscuits, echoing a stammer he had used for his character in &quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot;. In 1996, Nimmo voiced Mr Smiley in one episode of &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;.

==Personal life==

He married Patricia Brown in 1955; they had three children: Timothy (b. 1956); Piers (b. 1967); and Amanda (b. 1959), who was the first wife of Nicholas Howard, son of politician George Howard, Baron Howard of Henderskelfe.

Nimmo&#x27;s hobbies included gardening, photography (particularly nature photography), birdwatching and collecting walnut furniture, porcelain and paintings. He was also a wine expert and wrote several books on the subject as well as a number of books on the theatre. Another interest was after dinner speaking, for which he was always in demand.

He received many awards, including the 1990 Benedictine After Dinner Speaker of the Year. He was made a Freeman of the City of London, and the University of Leicester recognised his contribution to entertainment with an honorary master&#x27;s degree in 1996. Nimmo was an Anglican.

== Death ==
On 2 December 1998, Nimmo attended a National Treasures celebrity lunch in the boardroom of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper along with Sir Peter O&#x27;Sullevan, Joan Collins, Dame Beryl Bainbridge, Dickie Davies and Sue MacGregor amongst others. He had recently returned from a Middle East tour of &quot;Run For Your Wife&quot; and was in sparkling form during the lunch. After lunch he asked to be driven to the Garrick Club for further refreshment, and then returned to his Kensington (Lexham Gardens) home. He and his wife later went out to dinner. On their return, Nimmo was checking an external alarm when he lost his footing and fell down a stone staircase into the basement. He suffered head injuries and was taken to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital where he remained in a coma until the end of December. While still recovering in hospital, Nimmo contracted pneumonia and died on 24 February 1999.

He is buried in the churchyard at Easton Maudit, Northamptonshire.

<text>All Gas and Gaiters is a British television ecclesiastical sitcom which aired on BBC1 from 1966 to 1971. It was written by Pauline Devaney and Edwin Apps, a husband-and-wife team who used the pseudonym of John Wraith when writing the pilot. &quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot; was also broadcast on BBC Radio from 1971 to 1972.

==Cast==
*William MervynThe Rt Revd Dr Cuthbert Hever, DD, Bishop of St Ogg&#x27;s
*Robertson HareThe Ven Henry Blunt, the archdeacon
*Derek NimmoThe Revd Mervyn Noote, the Bishop&#x27;s chaplain
*John BarronThe Very Revd Lionel Pugh-Critchley, Dean of St Ogg&#x27;s (pilot, series 1, 4 and 5)
*Ernest ClarkThe Very Revd Lionel Pugh-Critchley, Dean of St Ogg&#x27;s (series 2 and 3, 1968 special, )
*Ruth KettlewellMrs Grace Pugh-Critchley, the Dean&#x27;s wife (series 1-3, 1968 special)
*Joan SandersonMrs Grace Pugh-Critchley, the Dean&#x27;s wife (series 4-5)

==Setting==
&quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot;, predominantly farcical in nature, is set in the close of the fictional St Ogg&#x27;s Cathedral and concerns intrigues and rivalries among the clergy in the Church of England. The bishop is easygoing; his friend the archdeacon is elderly, tippling, and still appreciative of attractive women; and the bishop&#x27;s chaplain is naïve and accident-prone. Their wish to live a quiet bachelor life was continually threatened by the overbearing dean, who tried to bring by-the-book rule to the cathedral, and the dean&#x27;s strident wife.

The title is a pun, deriving from a comic expression (&quot;all is gas and gaiters&quot;, meaning &quot;all is well&quot;) uttered by an eccentric old gentleman clad in small-clothes and grey worsted stockings in Charles Dickens&#x27; 1839 novel &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;, and later used by such writers as P. G. Wodehouse, Agatha Christie, and Powell and Pressburger (spoken in the film &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot;). The phrase &quot;all gas and gaiters&quot; has had different meanings. Sometimes it has been used to mean &quot;a satisfactory state of affairs&quot; and sometimes it has had the meaning of &quot;nonsense&quot;. The relevance of this phrase to Anglican clergy is that gaiters (worn over shoes) were part of the traditional dress of bishops and archdeacons.

The series initially aroused some controversy because of its portrayal of senior clergy as bungling incompetents, although some clergy enjoyed it. In the opening credits, St Albans Cathedral was shown as the fictional St Ogg&#x27;s (but with the Crooked Spire of Church of St Mary and All Saints, Chesterfield added to the central tower). The background to the opening credits was actually the headmaster&#x27;s garden of St Albans School. The name &quot;St Ogg&#x27;s&quot; may have been taken from a fictional village in George Eliot&#x27;s novel &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot;.

The series proved to be the first of a number of comedies starring Derek Nimmo in similar bumbling clerical roles – &quot;Oh, Brother!&quot;, &quot;Oh, Father!&quot; and &quot;Hell&#x27;s Bells&quot; – but is regarded as the best, partly because of a strong supporting cast (particularly the experienced &quot;farceur&quot; Robertson Hare as the archdeacon) and partly because it included some elements of gentle satire.

== Episodes ==
The pilot and first two series were videotaped in black-and-white. The third series was videotaped in colour, but was originally broadcast in monochrome. The fourth and fifth series were made and shown in colour.

===Comedy Playhouse Pilot===
The pilot episode was chosen to be the opening episode of the fifth series of &quot;Comedy Playhouse,&quot; the BBC&#x27;s long-running comedy strand that showcased one-off potential sitcom pilots. The pilot episode received favourable reviews from the press and gained more viewers than all the episodes in the preceding series of the show. The BBC quickly commissioned Devaney and Apps to write six more episodes, which were taped in the studio later that year. Previously thought missing from the archives, the pilot was recovered in 2001 and received its first public screening at the BFI&#x27;s annual Missing Believed Wiped event at the National Film Theatre on 20 October 2001.

===Series 1 (1967)===
Initially only one episode The Bishop Gets the Sack was thought to have survived from this series. However in 2001, two episodes were returned to the BBC archive following their Treasure Hunt campaign; when the series&#x27; creators Pauline Devaney and Edwin Apps returned film copies of the following episodes The Bishop Rides Again and The Bishop Sees a Ghost, since they personally requested copies of two episodes from BBC at the time, when they were trying to sell the series to the US. 

===Series 2 (1967)===
The role of The Dean was recast in this series with &quot;Ernest Clark&quot;, who would go on to play the character for the next two series. Due to the BBC&#x27;s wiping policy at the time, no episodes featuring Clark are known to have survived.

===Short Insert: Christmas Night With The Stars (1968)===
&quot;Christmas Night with the Stars&quot; was a programme screened annually on Christmas night, when the top stars of the BBC appeared in short versions of their programmes, typically five to ten minutes long. &quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot; appeared in a cross-over sketch with the sitcom &quot;Oh, Brother!&quot; where Nimmo also played Father Dominic. In this sketch, Nimmo plays both roles as Noote and Dominic respectively. This sketch no longer exists in the BBC&#x27;s film and videotape archives.

===Series 3 (1969)===
From this series onwards, the show was taped in colour, although originally transmitted in black and white, as BBC1 was still transmitting in monochrome at the time. Colour transmissions began later that year, commencing on 15 November 1969.

===Series 4 (1970)===
The first series to be transmitted in colour, even though it had been produced in colour since Series 3. There were cast changes to the principal roles in this series, &quot;John Barron&quot; reprised his role as The Dean and the role of his wife Mrs Grace Pugh-Critichley was recast with &quot;Joan Sanderson&quot;, who would go on to play the character for the remainder of the series&#x27; run. 

===Series 5 (1971)===
The final series, was also the only series with all the episodes to exist in their entirety, although the master copies of the original 2&quot; colour VT&#x27;s for the first two episodes of this series are currently missing and only 16mm black and white film recordings are known to have survived.&quot;&quot;

==Radio==
A radio version of &quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot; was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 from 5 January 1971 to 4 December 1972 for 33 episodes. The radio show used the same cast as the television series with the exception of Derek Nimmo, who left after the first series and was succeeded by Jonathan Cecil. Although seven radio episodes were thought to have been wiped, these were later found and all are available through radio enthusiasts. Some episodes were rebroadcast on BBC 7 in October and November 2006, and again a year later and in early 2009. They continued to be broadcast on the station, now renamed BBC Radio 4 Extra, in August 2011 and again in early 2017 and 2022.

===Radio Episodes===

===Series 1 (1971)===
===Series 2 (1972)===
== Archive Status ==
Only 11 episodes still exist in the archive, the others were wiped as was the standard policy of the BBC in this era. Film recordings exist for the pilot and two episodes from series 1, and two of the colour episodes from series 5 are preserved as black and white 16mm film recordings only. Only six colour episodes are preserved in their original colour videotape format.

Eight scripts of the lost episodes were published in 2015: &quot;Only Three Can Play&quot;, &quot;The Dean Goes Primitive&quot;, &quot;The Bishop Goes To Town&quot;, &quot;The Bishop Learns the Facts&quot;, &quot;The Bishop is Hospitable&quot;, &quot;The Bishop Takes a Holiday&quot;, &quot;The Affair at Cookham Lock&quot; and &quot;The Bishop Gives a Shove&quot;.

== Home Media ==
All 11 surviving episodes were originally released on VHS and DVD by DD Home Entertainment on 3 November 2003, originally accompanied by a detailed behind-the-scenes booklet, written by Andy Priestner in consultation with the show&#x27;s writers, Edwin Apps and Pauline Devaney, but later released without. Simply Media later gained the rights to the distribution of the series, and it re-released on 24 August 2009.

==Influence and legacy==
In April 2016, the radio drama based on the story behind the making of the series, &quot;All Mouth and Trousers&quot; by Mark Burgess, was aired by BBC Radio 4. The production featured John Sessions as Frank Muir, Nicholas Boulton as Stuart Allen, Gareth Williams as William Mervyn, Trevor Littledale as Robertson Hare, Zeb Soanes as Derek Nimmo and David Collings as John Barron.

<doc id="211128" wikidata="Q1324581" url="?curid=211128" title="Wilfred Burchett">
<text>Wilfred Graham Burchett (16 September 1911 – 27 September 1983) was an Australian journalist known for being the first western journalist to report from Hiroshima after the dropping of the atomic bomb, and for his reporting from &quot;the other side&quot; during the Korean and Vietnam Wars.

Burchett began his journalism at the start of World War II, during which he reported from China, Burma and Japan and covered the war in the Pacific. After the war he reported on the trials in Hungary, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and on Cambodia under Pol Pot. During the Korean war he investigated and supported claims by the North Korean government that the US had used germ warfare. He was the first western journalist to interview Yuri Gagarin after Gagarin&#x27;s historic first flight into outer space. He played a role in prompting the first significant Western relief for Cambodia after its liberation by Vietnam in 1979.

He was a politically engaged anti-imperialist who always placed himself amongst the people and events about whom he was reporting. His reporting antagonised both the American and Australian governments and he was effectively exiled from Australia for almost 20 years before the incoming Whitlam government granted him a new passport.

==Early life==
Burchett was born in Clifton Hill, Melbourne in 1911 to George Harold and Mary Jane Eveline Burchett (née Davey). His father was a builder, a farmer, and a Methodist lay preacher with radical convictions who &quot;imbued [Burchett] with a progressive approach to British India, the Soviet Union and republican China&quot;. He spent his youth in the south Gippsland town of Poowong and then Ballarat, where Wilfred attended the Agricultural High School. Poverty forced him to drop out of school at fifteen and work at various odd jobs, including as a vacuum cleaner salesman and an agricultural labourer. In his free time he studied foreign languages, mainly French and Russian.

In 1937 Burchett left Australia for London by ship. There he found work in a Jewish travel agency Palestine &amp; Orient Lloyd Ltd which resettled Jews from Nazi Germany in British Palestine and the United States. It was in this job that he met Erna Lewy, née Hammer, a Jewish refugee from Germany, and they married in 1938 in Hampstead. He visited Germany in 1938 before returning to Australia with his wife in 1939. After his return to Australia he wrote letters to newspapers warning against the danger of German and Japanese militarism. After the declaration of war by England, he became sought after as &quot;one of the last Australians to leave Germany before the war&quot;.

==Career as a journalist, 1940–1978==

===Second World War===
Burchett began his career in journalism in 1940 when he obtained accreditation with the Australian Associated Press to report on the revolt against the Vichy French in the South Pacific colony of New Caledonia. He recounted his experiences in his book &quot;Pacific Treasure Island: New Caledonia&quot;. Historian Beverly Smith said that &quot;Pacific Treasure Island&quot; describes Burchett&#x27;s view of &quot;the way in which Australian culture and mores, as they emerged from the pioneers&#x27; experience, could develop in harmony with those of the liberated peoples in neighbouring Asia&quot;.

Burchett next travelled to the then Chinese capital, Chongqing, becoming a correspondent for the London &quot;Daily Express&quot; and also writing for the Sydney &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;. He was wounded while reporting on Britain&#x27;s campaign in Burma. He also covered the American advance in the Pacific under General Douglas MacArthur.

===Hiroshima===
Burchett was in Okinawa when he heard on the radio that &quot;the world’s first A-bomb had been dropped on a place called Hiroshima&quot;. He was the first Western journalist to visit Hiroshima after the atom bomb was dropped, arriving alone by train from Tokyo on 2 September, the day of the formal surrender of Japan, after a thirty-hour train trip in breach of MacArthur&#x27;s orders. He was unarmed, and carrying rations for seven meals, a black umbrella and a Baby Hermes typewriter. During his reporting, he ran into a press junket organized by Tex McCrary for promoting the United States Army Air Force and later referred to the group as &quot;housetrained reporters&quot; participating in a &quot;cover-up&quot;. His Morse code dispatch was printed on the front page of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper in London on 5 September 1945. Entitled &quot;The Atomic Plague&quot;, and with the subtitle &quot;I Write This as a Warning to the World&quot;, it began:

On this &quot;scoop of the century&quot;, which had a worldwide impact, Burchett&#x27;s byline was incorrectly given as &quot;by Peter Burchett&quot;.

MacArthur had imposed restrictions on journalists&#x27; access to bombed cities, and had censored reports of the destruction caused by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Civilian casualties were downplayed and the deadly lingering effects of radiation were dismissed. The New York Times published a front-page story with the headline &#x27;No radioactivity in Hiroshima ruin&#x27;. Military censors suppressed a 25,000 word story about the bombing of Nagasaki submitted by George Weller of the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;.

Burchett&#x27;s report was the first in the Western media to mention the effects of radiation and nuclear fallout and was, therefore, a major embarrassment for the US military. In response, US officials accused Burchett of being under the sway of Japanese propaganda. Burchett lost his press accreditation and he was ordered to leave Japan, although this order was later withdrawn. In addition, his camera, containing photos of Hiroshima, was confiscated while he was documenting persistent illness at a Tokyo hospital. The film was sent to Washington and classified secret before being released in 1968. US military encouraged the journalist William L. Laurence of &quot;The New York Times&quot; to write articles dismissing the reports of radiation sickness as part of Japanese efforts to undermine American morale. Laurence, who was also being paid by the US War Department, wrote the articles the US military wanted even though he was aware of the effects of radiation after observing the first atomic bomb test on 16 July 1945, and its effect on local residents and livestock.

Burchett wrote about his experiences in his book, &quot;Shadows of Hiroshima&quot;.

===Eastern Europe===
After three years in Greece and Berlin working for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, Burchett began reporting on Eastern Europe for &quot;The Times&quot;. He covered some of the post-war political trials in Hungary, including that of Cardinal Mindszenty in 1949, and of the communist László Rajk, who was convicted and executed the same year. Burchett described Rajk as a &quot;Titoist spy&quot; and a &quot;tool of American and British intelligence&quot;. Burchett praised the post-war Stalinist purges in Bulgaria: the &quot;Bulgarian conspirators were the left arm of the Hungarian reactionary right arm&quot;.

In his autobiography, Burchett later admitted that he began to have doubts about the trials when one of the Bulgarians repudiated his signed confession. Hungarian Tibor Méray accused Burchett of dishonesty regarding the trials and the subsequent Hungarian Revolution of 1956 which he opposed.

===Korean War, 1950–1953===
Burchett returned to Australia in 1950 and campaigned against Robert Menzies’ bill to ban the Communist Party. In 1951, Burchett travelled to the People&#x27;s Republic of China as a foreign correspondent for the French communist newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;. After six months in China he wrote &quot;China&#x27;s Feet Unbound&quot;, which supported the new Chinese government of Mao Zedong. In July 1951, he and British journalist Alan Winnington made their way to North Korea to cover the Panmunjom Peace Talks. While in Korea he reported from the Northern side for the French communist newspaper &quot;Ce soir&quot; and the American radical publication &quot;National Guardian&quot;.

Burchett investigated and confirmed claims by the North Korean government that the US had used Germ warfare in the Korean War. During his investigation, he observed &quot;clusters of flies and fleas on the snow-covered hillsides&quot;, which the North Korean military said were infected with bubonic plague. In his 1953 book about the Korean war, &quot;This Monstrous War&quot;, he wrote:
The US military&#x27;s Far Eastern Command (FEC) wanted to silence Burchett by &quot;exfiltrating&quot; him from North Korea but its request to the Australian government for permission, which included a $100,000 inducement (over $1,000,000 in 2022 dollars), was turned down. Instead, the FEC established a smear campaign against Burchett with the backing of the Australian government. Australian journalist Denis Warner suggested Burchett had concocted the claim that the USA was engaging in germ warfare and pointed out the similarity of the allegations to a science fiction story by Jack London, a favourite author of Burchett&#x27;s. However, Burchett&#x27;s former colleague and veteran anti-communist, Tibor Méray, confirmed Burchett&#x27;s insect observation in his critical memoir &quot;On Burchett&quot;. Burchett&#x27;s finding was later supported by a 2010 report by al-Jazeera.

Burchett visited several POW camps in North Korea, comparing one to a &quot;luxury resort&quot;, a &quot;holiday resort in Switzerland&quot;, which angered POWs who had been held under conditions that violated the Geneva Conventions. Historian Gavan McCormack wrote that Burchett regretted this analogy, but said that the factual basis of the description was confirmed by POW Walker Mahurin. Similarly, Tibor Méray reports a &quot;Peace Fighter Camp&quot; which had no fences.

On 21 December 1951, Burchett achieved a major scoop by interviewing the most senior United Nations POW, US General William F. Dean and organising for photographs of Dean to be taken. The US had claimed that Dean had been killed by the North Koreans and had intended using his death as leverage in negotiations with the North Koreans. It was consequently angry that Burchett reported he was alive. In his autobiography Dean entitled a chapter &quot;My Friend Wilfred Burchett&quot; and wrote &quot;I like Burchett and am grateful to him&quot;. He expressed thanks for Burchett&#x27;s &quot;special kindness&quot; in improving his conditions, communicating with his family, and giving him an &quot;accurate&quot; briefing on the state of the war.

In his study of war correspondents, &quot;The First Casualty&quot;, Phillip Knightley wrote that &quot;in Korea, the truth was that Burchett and Winnington were a better source of news than the UN information officers, and if the allied reporters did not see them they risked being beaten on stories&quot;.

===Moscow===
In 1956, Burchett arrived in Moscow as a correspondent for the &quot;National Guardian&quot; newspaper, while also writing for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, and, from 1960, for the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. According to Robert Manne, Burchett received a monthly allowance from the Soviet authorities. For the next six years he reported on Soviet advances in science and the rebuilding of the post-war Soviet economy. In one dispatch Burchett wrote: 

In 1961, Burchett was the first western journalist to interview Yuri Gagarin after his historic space flight. Describing Gagarin, Burchett wrote that &quot;the first impression was of his good-natured personality; big smile -- a grin, really -- light step and an air of sunny friendliness ... His hands are incredibly hard; his eyes an almost luminous blue&quot;.

===China===
In his 1946 book, &quot;Democracy with a Tommy Gun&quot;, Burchett wrote about his view of the coming crisis in Western imperialism in Asia. In particular he said that &quot;the British Raj in India and the Kuomintang dictatorship (in China) represent decaying systems of government&quot; and &quot;immediately the war ended, subject people in the East began to rise&quot; to take their &quot;freedom and independence&quot;.

Burchett eventually sided with China in the Sino-Soviet split. In 1963, he wrote to his father George that the Chinese were &quot;one hundred per cent right&quot;, but asked George to keep his views confidential.

In 1973, Burchett published &quot;China: The Quality of Life&quot;, with co-author Rewi Alley. In Robert Manne&#x27;s view this was &quot;a book of unconditional praise for Maoist China following the Great Leap Forward and the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution&quot;.

In a 1983 interview, Burchett said he grew disillusioned with China over its position in Angola in which it was supporting the &quot;same side as the CIA&quot;.

===Vietnam===
In 1962, Burchett began writing on the war in Vietnam, from the North Vietnamese side. Beginning in November 1963, Burchett spent six months in southern Vietnam with Viet Cong guerrillas, staying in their fortified hamlets and travelling underground in their network of narrow tunnels. When US President Kennedy increased funding for the war in Vietnam, Burchett wrote: &quot;No peasants anywhere in the world had so many dollars per capita lavished on their extermination&quot;. He described Ho Chi Minh as &quot;the greatest man I’ve ever met, with all the modesty and simplicity that goes with human greatness&quot;. He once described Saigon as &quot;a seething cauldron in which hissed and bubbled a witches&#x27; brew of rival French and American imperialisms spiced with feudal warlordism and fascist despotism&quot; and decried the government of South Vietnam under Ngô Đình Diệm as &quot;an Asian neo-fascism no less dangerous for world peace than...European fascism&quot; was during the 1930s. 

During his time in Vietnam he had access to the North Vietnamese leadership and the South&#x27;s Viet Cong. He tried to help the British and US governments in obtaining the release of captured American airmen. In 1967, he had a significant interview with the North Vietnamese foreign minister, Nguyen Duy Trinh in which Nguyen provided the first indication that the North Vietnamese government was interested in peace talks. He played a role in trying to organise informal talks during the 1968 peace talks in Paris.

Bertrand Russell wrote that &quot;If any one man is responsible for alerting Western opinion to the struggle of the people of Vietnam, it is Wilfred Burchett&quot;.

Burchett published numerous books about Vietnam and the war.

===Cambodia===
In 1975 and 1976, Burchett sent a number of dispatches from Cambodia praising the new government of Pol Pot. In a 14 October 1976 article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; (UK), he wrote that &quot;Cambodia has become a worker-peasant-soldier state&quot;, and, because its new constitution &quot;guarantees that everyone has the right to work and a fair standard of living&quot;, it was, Burchett believed, &quot;one of the most democratic and revolutionary constitutions in existence anywhere&quot;. At the time, he believed his friend, former prince Norodom Sihanouk, was part of the leadership group.

As relations between Cambodia and Vietnam deteriorated, and after Burchett visited refugee camps in 1978, he condemned the Khmer Rouge and they subsequently placed him on a death list.

Burchett visited Phnom Penh in May 1979 and wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; about the desperate situation there. The Phnom Penh government drew up a list of required emergency relief which Burchett took to London, where he read it out at an all-party meeting in the House of Commons. He said that the governments in both Vietnam and Cambodia had assured him that relief would be welcome and that &quot;a great many human beings are starving and need your help&quot;. The UK government did nothing in response to Burchett&#x27;s request since the newly elected government of Margaret Thatcher had joined the US boycott of Vietnam and suspended all food aid to both Vietnam and Cambodia. However, Jim Howard, a technical officer for Oxfam was at the meeting and was moved to arrange for the first significant Western relief to Cambodia.

==Writing style==
Greg Lockhart analysed Burchett&#x27;s writing in an article in &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper. Lockhart thought the &quot;involved narrator&quot; present in Burchett&#x27;s writing was similar to that of Henry Lawson. He said Burchett&#x27;s style fitted with the &quot;politically engaged, social realist reportage -- the I narratives -- that swept progressive journalism in Europe and Asia in the &#x27;20s and &#x27;30s: George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot; (1933), for instance&quot;. Lockhart said that Burchett&#x27;s method of writing quickly and outside the structures of Western journalism was both a strength and a weakness of his work. Sinologist Michael Godley said that the &quot;camera verite&quot; method, which was in vogue in Beijing in 1951 when Burchett was there, may have influenced his style.

==Australian Government actions==
===Exile from Australia 1955–1972===
In 1955, Burchett&#x27;s British passport went missing, believed stolen, and the Australian Government refused to issue a replacement and asked the British to do the same. He again requested an Australian passport in 1960 and 1965 but was denied both times. A further request in July 1968 was rejected by prime minister John Gorton. For many years Burchett held a Vietnamese &quot;laissez-passer&quot; which grew so large due to the additional pages that needed to be added each time he travelled, that Burchett said he needed an attache case to carry it. While Burchett was attending a conference in Cuba, Fidel Castro learned about his passport problem, and issued him with a Cuban passport. Matters came to a head in 1969 when Burchett was refused entry into Australia to attend his father&#x27;s funeral. The following year his brother Clive died, and Burchett flew to Brisbane in a privately chartered light plane as the Gorton government had threatened commercial airlines with steep penalties for flying Burchett into the country. He was allowed entry, triggering a media sensation. In 1972, an Australian passport was finally issued to Burchett by the incoming Whitlam government which said there was no evidence to justify its continued denial. Writing in &quot;The Australian&quot;, Greg Lockhart described the previous governments&#x27; actions as &quot;a remarkable breach of the human rights of an Australian citizen&quot; in which it &quot;simply exiled him for 17 years&quot;.

===Government attempts to prosecute Burchett===
Conservative Australian governments between 1949 and 1970 tried to construct a case to prosecute Burchett but were unable to do so.

After Burchett reported from North Korea about the use of germ warfare by the Americans, the Australian government looked at charging him with treason. It sent ASIO agents to Japan and Korea to collect evidence but in early 1954, conceded it could not prosecute him.

The last attempt was in 1970, when attorney-general Tom Hughes admitted to prime minister John Gorton, that the government had no evidence against him. Hughes said that a prosecution for treason under the Crimes Act &quot;cannot be mounted unless the war is a proclaimed war and there is a proclaimed enemy&quot;, and the Australian government had not declared war in Korea and Vietnam.

===Australian Broadcasting Corporation===
Around 1967, ABC journalist Tony Ferguson filmed an interview with Burchett in Phnom Penh. According to filmmaker David Bradbury, Ferguson said that the general manager of the ABC, Talbot Duckmanton, ordered its destruction. Bradbury&#x27;s own 1981 documentary film on Burchett, &quot;Public Enemy Number One&quot; was never shown in full on Australian television because the ABC refused to buy it.

===ASIO===
The Australian national security department, which became ASIO in 1949, opened a file on the whole Burchett family in the 1940s. Australian security was concerned by Burchett&#x27;s father&#x27;s interest in helping Jewish refugees in Melbourne, and his views on the Soviet Union and republican China. A document on Burchett&#x27;s own file dated February 1944 noted: Other documents on Burchett&#x27;s file show ASIO was concerned by his scathing criticism of American imperialism.

==Yuri Krotkov and Jack Kane==
Burchett first met Yuri Krotkov in Berlin after the second world war and they met again when Burchett moved to Moscow in 1957. Krotkov defected to Britain in the early 1960s. He had been a low-ranking KGB agent who the British passed on to the Americans. In November 1969, Krotkov testified before the US Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security that Burchett had been his agent when he worked as a KGB controller. Others he named as agents and contacts included, implausibly, Jean-Paul Sartre and John Kenneth Galbraith. He claimed that Burchett had proposed a &quot;special relationship&quot; with the Soviets at their first meeting in Berlin in 1947. Krotkov also said that Burchett had worked as an agent for both Vietnam and China and was a secret member of the Communist Party of Australia.

In September 1971, Democratic Labour Party leader Vince Gair accused Burchett, in the Senate, of being a KGB operative and tabled Krotkov&#x27;s testimony. In November 1971, the DLP published details of Gair&#x27;s speech in its pamphlet, &quot;Focus&quot;. In February 1973 Burchett filed a one-million-dollar libel suit against DLP senator Jack Kane, who was &quot;Focus&quot;″s publisher. In preparing his case, Kane received support from The Herald and Weekly Times, Philip Jones and Robert Menzies. Australia&#x27;s military chiefs-of-staff appeared as witnesses for Kane. ASIO provided the names of Australian POWs whom Burchett had met in Korea and Kane put thirty of these on the stand. The former prisoners testified that Burchett had used threatening and insulting language against them and in some cases had been involved in their interrogations. North Vietnamese defectors, Bui Cong Tuong and To Ming Trung, also testified at the trial, claiming that Burchett was so highly regarded in Hanoi he was known as &quot;Comrade Soldier&quot;, a title he shared only with Lenin and Ho Chi Minh.

The jury found Burchett had been defamed, but considered the &quot;Focus&quot; article a fair report of the 1971 Senate speech by Gair and therefore protected by parliamentary privilege. Costs were awarded against Burchett. Burchett appealed and lost. In their 1976 judgement, the appeal court judges found that Kane&#x27;s article was not a fair report of the Senate speech. The jury&#x27;s verdict, however, they concluded, arose out of the failure of Burchett&#x27;s lawyer to argue his client&#x27;s case and was not an error of the court. It was also impractical to recall the international witnesses for a retrial.

Historian Gavan McCormack has said in Burchett&#x27;s defence that his only dealings with Australian POWs were &quot;trivial incidents&quot; in which he &quot;helped&quot; them. With regard to other POWs, McCormack stated that their allegations were at variance with earlier statements which either explicitly cleared Burchett or blamed someone else.

For his part, Tibor Méray alleged that Burchett was an undercover party member but not a KGB agent.

==Bukovsky archive==
During his return visits to Moscow in the early 1990s, veteran dissident Vladimir Bukovsky was given access by the Russian government to classified documents from the archives of the CPSU Central Committee. Bukovsky secretly photocopied thousands of pages and in 1999 these were posted online. Among the documents were a memorandum dated 17 July 1957 and a decision dated 25 October 1957 concerning Burchett.

The July memorandum was written by the chairman of the KGB and addressed to the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. It mentioned that Burchett had agreed to work in Moscow on &quot;condition&quot; that he receive &quot;a monetary subsidy, and also the opportunity of unpublicised collaboration in the Soviet press&quot;. The memorandum also contained a description of Burchett&#x27;s background and a request for him to be paid &quot;a one-time subsidy in the sum of 20,000 roubles and the establishment for him of a monthly subsidy in the sum of 4;000 roubles&quot;. On 25 October, the Central Committee accepted the KGB&#x27;s request but reduced the monthly payment to 3;000 roubles.

In 2013 Robert Manne used these documents to update &quot;Agent of Influence: Reassessing Wilfred Burchett&quot;, his 2008 article in which he examined Burchett&#x27;s relationship with a number of communist governments in Europe and Asia. Manne concluded in 2013 that &quot;Every detail in the KGB memorandum is consistent with the Washington testimony of Yuri Krotkov&quot;. Manne wrote that Krotkov &quot;was not a liar and a perjurer, but a truth-teller&quot;. Conversely, Tom Heenan, from the National Centre for Australian Studies, was not convinced by the evidence Manne quoted and wrote that, if the KGB had given money to Burchett, it had been shortchanged, since Burchett had moved away from Soviet Communism and towards the Chinese by the 1960s.

==Death and legacy==
Burchett moved to Bulgaria in 1982 and died of cancer in Sofia the following year, aged 72.

A documentary film entitled &quot;Public Enemy Number One&quot; by David Bradbury was released in 1981. The film showed how Burchett was criticised in Australia for his coverage of &quot;the other side&quot; in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, and posed the questions: &quot;Can a democracy tolerate opinions it considers subversive to its national interest? How far can freedom of the press be extended in wartime?&quot;

In 1997, journalist Denis Warner wrote: &quot;he will be remembered by many as one of the more remarkable agents of influence of the times, but by his Australian and other admirers as a folk hero&quot;.

Nick Shimmin, co-editor of the book &quot;Rebel Journalism: The Writings of Wilfred Burchett&quot; said &quot;When he saw injustice and hardship, he criticised those he believed responsible for it&quot;.

In 2011 Vietnam celebrated Burchett&#x27;s 100th birthday with an exhibition in the Ho Chi Minh Museum in Hanoi.

==Personal life==
Burchett met and married his first wife Erna Lewy, a German Jewish refugee, in London and they married in 1938. They had one son together. They divorced in 1948, and Burchett married Vesselina (Vessa) Ossikovska, a Bulgarian communist, in December 1949 in Sofia. They had a daughter and two sons. His children were denied Australian citizenship at the request of Robert Menzies in 1955. His son George was born in Hanoi, and grew up in Moscow and France. He lived in Hanoi and edited some of his father&#x27;s writings and produced a documentary.

Burchett was the uncle of chef and cookbook writer Stephanie Alexander.

<text>The Canon de 75 Montagne modèle 1928 (75 mm M mle.28) was a French mountain gun, used by France, Poland and Nazi Germany during World War II.

== History ==
It is a derivative of the Canon de 75 M(montagne) modele 1919 Schneider, upgraded based on feedback from the Rif War. According to Peter Chamberlain, the design of the mle 1928 &quot;owed little to that of the mle 1919&quot; while the French Army manuals insisted on it being &quot;slightly modified&quot; (). The mle 1928 featured a simpler shield.

The mle 1928 fired the same ammunitions than the Canon de 75 modèle 1897 and the mle. 1919. It could be carried on seven mules or towed by three mules.

The guns were also sold to Poland. After 1940, these weapons were used by the Germans as 7.5 cm GebK 283(f). The French used this weapon to equip the artillery batteries of the 4th Moroccan Mountain Division during 1944 and 1945. Some were later sent to alpine units but the gun was considered obsolete by that date.

<text>The Quadrantids (QUA) are a meteor shower that peaks in early January and whose radiant lies in the constellation Boötes. The zenithal hourly rate (ZHR) of this shower can be as high as that of two other reliably rich meteor showers, the Perseids in August and the Geminids in December, yet Quadrantid meteors are not seen as often as those of the two other showers because the time frame of the peak is exceedingly narrow, sometimes lasting only hours. Moreover, the meteors are quite faint, with mean apparent magnitudes between 3.0 and 6.0.

==Observations and associations==
The meteor rates exceed one-half of their highest value for only about eight hours (compared to two days for the August Perseids), which means that the stream of particles that produces this shower is narrow, and apparently deriving within the last 500 years from some orbiting body. The parent body of the Quadrantids was tentatively identified in 2003 by Peter Jenniskens as the minor planet , which in turn may be related to the comet C/1490 Y1 that was observed by Chinese, Japanese and Korean astronomers some 500 years ago.
The radiant point of this shower is at the northern edge of the constellation Boötes, not far from the Big Dipper. It lies between the end of the handle of the Big Dipper and the quadrilateral of stars marking the head of the constellation Draco. This meteor shower is best seen in the northern hemisphere, but it can be seen partly to 50 degrees south latitude.

The name comes from Quadrans Muralis, a former constellation created in 1795 by the French astronomer Jérôme Lalande that included portions of Boötes and Draco. In early January 1825, Antonio Brucalassi in Italy reported that “the atmosphere was traversed by a multitude of the luminous bodies known by the name of falling stars.” They appeared to radiate from Quadrans Muralis. In 1839, Adolphe Quetelet of Brussels Observatory in Belgium and Edward C. Herrick in Connecticut independently made the suggestion that the Quadrantids are an annual shower.

In 1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) devised a list of 88 modern constellations. The list was agreed upon by the IAU at its inaugural general assembly held in Rome in May 1922. It did not include a constellation Quadrans Muralis. The IAU officially adopted this list in 1930, but this meteor shower still retains the name Quadrantids, for the original and now-obsolete constellation.

<doc id="211136" wikidata="Q380752" url="?curid=211136" title="Udon Thani province">
<text>Udon Thani province (Thai/, , ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) which lies in upper northeastern Thailand, also called Isan. It is bordered by the provinces of Nong Khai to the north, Sakon Nakhon to the east, Kalasin province to the southeast, Khon Kaen to the south, and Loei and Nong Bua Lamphu to the west. It occupies an area of . The total forest area is or 10.2 percent of provincial area. The provincial capital is Udon Thani, the major city in the province.

==Toponymy==
Udon Thani is said to mean &#x27;northern city&#x27;. &quot;Udon&quot; is derived from &quot;utara&quot; in Sanskrit, meaning &#x27;northern direction&#x27;, as Udon Thani is northeast of Bangkok. &quot;Thani&quot; means &#x27;city&#x27;.

==History==
Udon Thani first came to historical notice in the Rattanakosin era, when Anuwong of Vientiane staged a rebellion against Thai rule and marched his army to Nakhon Ratchasima in 1826. He captured the city by a ruse, but the garrison he left to hold it unexpectedly met with fierce resistance from the disarmed local forces led by Lady Mo, the wife of Nakhon Ratchasima&#x27;s governor. Anuwong advanced as far as Saraburi, but was forced to retreat. The Thai army pursued him, and the rival forces met in battle at Nong Bua Lamphu, a small city near today&#x27;s Udon Thani. After two days of fierce fighting, Anuwong&#x27;s army was defeated and fled back to Laos.
Once known as Ban Mak-kaeng, Udon Thani was originally settled as a military base established by Prince Prachaksinlapakhom to suppress an uprising in the northeastern city of Lao Puan. Ban Mak-kaeng grew slowly from a small rural town to become what is now the city of Udon Thani. He founded Udon Thani town in 1893, established the civil administration and served important official duties for the region.

The province is best known for the prehistoric archaeological site at Ban Chiang and its Bronze Age relics, in a hamlet about east of Udon Thani. Udon Thani is one of the more bustling markets for agricultural goods in the relatively dry northeast of Thailand.

Udon Thani received its biggest economic boost in the 1960s when the United States built the Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base as a joint-force military base during the Vietnam War. The Mel Gibson film &quot;Air America&quot; depicts Udon and includes scenes of Udon&#x27;s air base. Udon Thani was also the largest base in the region for the CIA&#x27;s anti-communism campaign in Thailand and Laos. The United States turned the base over to the Royal Thai Air Force in 1976, but its presence left three residual effects on Udon. First, a large number of locals had been paid comparatively well and had learned basic conversational English. This made them more marketable to the outside world, and a significant number went to work in Middle East oilfields. Second, the base created long-standing ties with the United States, including a US consulate in Udon (closed in 1995), and a US Veterans of Foreign Wars post. But most importantly, the base and the consulate made the city into a regional hub for the northeast, and this continues today.

In recent years Udon received international attention because of the discovery of large potash deposits. Some anticipate the region would become a major exporter of the mineral. However, granting the necessary approvals has been substantially delayed due to public opposition to mining. Many villagers living near the proposed mine site fear that the mining company&#x27;s environmental impact assessment (EIA) did not adequately address the problems of salinization of the groundwater and soil, as well as probability of land subsidence. Either of these would seriously threaten the economic stability of local communities that depend on rice farming for income. An existing potash mine, Udon North mine has attracted local opposition.

===Black site===

The province has been named as the locale of a US CIA &quot;black site&quot; used to interrogate suspected terrorists by the United States. Suspected locations include Ramasun Station, dominated by a large wullenweber array, also known as the 7th Radio Research Field Station, in Tambon Non Sung of Mueang Udon Thani District; the 13th Artillery Battalion encampment (Camp Yutthasilpprasit) 13 km distant from Ramasun; Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base; and a Voice of America (VOA) broadcasting station in Ban Dung District.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows the tutelary Vaiśravaṇa, also known locally as Thao Wessuwan. This is in line with the name of the province, which means &quot;northern city&quot;, and on the account, Vaiśravaṇa is the one of Four Heavenly Kings of the northern direction.

The provincial tree is the &quot;Shorea obtusa&quot;, and the provincial flower is the &quot;Butea monosperma&quot;.

The provincial aquatic life is the small edible carp &quot;Labiobarbus siamensis&quot;.

==Geography==
===National parks===
There are two national parks, along with five other national parks, make up region 10 (Udon Thani) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Na Yung–Nam Som National Park, 
* Phu Hin Chom That–Phu Phra Bat National Park, 

== Administrative divisions ==

===Provincial government===

The province is divided into twenty districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;). Another five are now in Nong Bua Lamphu province. The districts are further subdivided into 155 sub-districts (&quot;tambon&quot;) and 1682 villages (&quot;muban&quot;):
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Udon Thani Provincial Administrative Organization – PAO (&quot;&quot;) and 71 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. The capital Udon Thani has city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) status. Further Ban Dung, Nam Kham-Nong Sung and Nong Samrong have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status and 67 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;).

<doc id="211143" wikidata="Q941621" url="?curid=211143" title="List of Christian denominations">
<text>A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organization and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church, convention, communion, assembly, house, union, network, or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one denomination and another are primarily defined by authority and doctrine. Issues regarding the nature of Jesus, Trinitarianism, salvation, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, conciliarity, papal supremacy and papal primacy among others may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations, often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties—can be known as &quot;branches of Christianity&quot; or &quot;denominational families&quot; (e.g. Eastern or Western Christianity and their sub-branches). These &quot;denominational families&quot; are often imprecisely also called denominations.

Christian denominations since the 20th century have often involved themselves in ecumenism. Ecumenism refers to efforts among Christian bodies to develop better understandings and closer relationships. It also refers to efforts toward visible unity in the Christian Church, though the terms of visible unity vary for each denomination of Christianity, as certain groups teach they are the one true church, or that they were divinely instituted for the propagation of a certain doctrine. The largest ecumenical organization in Christianity is the World Council of Churches.

The following is not a complete list, but aims to provide a comprehensible overview of the diversity among denominations of Christianity, ecumenical organizations, and Christian ideologies not necessarily represented by specific denominations. Only those Christian denominations, ideologies and organizations with Wikipedia articles will be listed in order to ensure that all entries on this list are notable and verifiable. The denominations and ecumenical organizations listed are generally ordered from ancient to contemporary Christianity.

==Terminology and qualification==

Christianity can be taxonomically divided into six main groups: the Church of the East, Oriental Orthodoxy, Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, and Restorationism. Within these six main traditions are various Christian denominations (for example, the Coptic Orthodox Church is an Oriental Orthodox denomination). Protestantism includes many groups which do not share any ecclesiastical governance and have widely diverging beliefs and practices. Major Protestant branches include Adventism, Anabaptism, Anglicanism, Baptists, Lutheranism, Methodism, Moravianism, Quakerism, Pentecostalism, Plymouth Brethren, Reformed Christianity, and Waldensianism. Reformed Christianity itself includes the Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, Evangelical Anglican, Congregationalist, and Reformed Baptist traditions. Anabaptist Christianity itself includes the Amish, Apostolic, Bruderhof, Hutterite, Mennonite, River Brethren, and Schwarzenau Brethren traditions.

Within the Restorationist branch of Christianity, denominations include the Irvingians, Swedenborgians, Christadelphians, Latter Day Saints, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, La Luz del Mundo, and Iglesia ni Cristo. Among those listed, some bodies included do not consider themselves denominations, though for the purpose of academic study of religion, they are categorized as a denomination, that is, &quot;an organized body of Christians.&quot; For example, the Catholic Church considers itself the one true church and the Holy See as pre-denominational. The Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Oriental Orthodox Churches, also considers themselves to be the original Christian church along with the Roman Catholic Church. The Lutheran churches have viewed themselves as the &quot;main trunk of the historical Christian Tree&quot; founded by Christ and the Apostles, holding that during the Reformation, the Church of Rome fell away. Certain denominational traditions teach that they were divinely instituted to propagate a certain doctrine or spiritual experience, for example the raising up of Methodism by God to propagate entire sanctification (the &quot;second blessing&quot;), or the launch of Pentecostalism to bestow a baptism with the Holy Spirit evidenced by speaking in tongues on humanity. To express further the complexity involved, the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches were historically one and the same, as evidenced by the fact that they are the only two modern churches in existence to accept all of the first seven ecumenical councils, until differences arose, such as papal authority and dominance, the rise of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the continuance of emperors in the Eastern Roman Empire, and the final and permanent split that occurred during the Crusades with the siege of Constantinople. This also illustrates that denominations can arise not only from religious or theological issues, but political and generational divisions as well.

Other churches that are viewed by non-adherents as denominational are highly decentralized and do not have any formal denominational structure, authority, or record-keeping beyond the local congregation; several groups within the Restoration Movement and congregational churches fall into this category.

Some Christian bodies are large (e.g. Catholics, Orthodox, Pentecostals and nondenominationals, Anglicans or Baptists), while others are just a few small churches, and in most cases the relative size is not evident in this list except for the denominational group or movement as a whole (e.g. Church of the East, Oriental Orthodox Churches, or Lutheranism). The largest denomination is the Catholic Church with more than 1.3 billion members. The smallest of these groups may have only a few dozen adherents or an unspecified number of participants in independent churches as described below. As such, specific numbers and a certain size may not define a group as a denomination. However, as a general rule, the larger a group becomes, the more acceptance and legitimacy it gains.

Modern movements such as Christian fundamentalism, Radical Pietism, Evangelicalism, the Holiness movement and Charismatic Christianity sometimes cross denominational lines, or in some cases create new denominations out of two or more continuing groups (as is the case for many united and uniting churches, for example; e.g. the United Church of Christ). Such subtleties and complexities are not clearly depicted here.

Between denominations, theologians, and comparative religionists there are considerable disagreements about which groups can be properly called Christian or a Christian denomination as disagreements arise primarily from doctrinal differences between each other. As an example, this list contains groups also known as &quot;rites&quot; which many, such as the Roman Catholic Church, would say are not denominations as they are in full papal communion, and thus part of the Catholic Church. For the purpose of simplicity, this list is intended to reflect the self-understanding of each denomination. Explanations of different opinions concerning their status as Christian denominations can be found at their respective articles.

There is no official recognition in most parts of the world for religious bodies, and there is no official clearinghouse which could determine the status or respectability of religious bodies. Often there is considerable disagreement between various groups about whether others should be labeled with pejorative terms such as &quot;cult&quot;, or about whether this or that group enjoys some measure of respectability. Such considerations often vary from place to place, or culture to culture, where one denomination may enjoy majority status in one region, but be widely regarded as a &quot;dangerous cult&quot; in another part of the world. Inclusion on this list does not indicate any judgment about the size, importance, or character of a group or its members.

==Early Christian==

Early Christianity is often divided into three different branches that differ in theology and traditions, which all appeared in the 1st century AD/CE. They include Jewish Christianity, Pauline Christianity and Gnostic Christianity. All modern Christian denominations are said to have descended from the Jewish and Pauline Christianities, with Gnostic Christianity dying, or being hunted out of existence after the early Christian era and being largely forgotten until discoveries made in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries. There are also other theories on the origin of Christianity.

== Church of the East ==

The Church of the East split from the Roman-recognized state church of Rome during the Sasanian Period. It is also called the Nestorian Church or the Church of Persia. Declaring itself separate from the state church in 424–427, liturgically, it adhered to the East Syriac Rite. Theologically, it adopted the dyophysite doctrine of Nestorianism, which emphasizes the separateness of the divine and human natures of Jesus, and addresses Mary as Christotokos instead of Theotokos; the Church of the East also largely practiced aniconism. Adhered to by groups such as the Keraites and Naimans (see Christianity among the Mongols), the Church of the East had a prominent presence in Inner Asia between the 11th and 14th centuries, but by the 15th century was largely confined to the Eastern Aramaic-speaking Assyrian communities of northern Mesopotamia, in and around the rough triangle formed by Mosul and Lakes Van and Urmia—the same general region where the Church of the East had first emerged between the 1st and 3rd centuries.

Its patriarchal lines divided in a tumultuous period from the 16th-19th century, finally consolidated into the Eastern Catholic Chaldean Church (in full communion with the Pope of Rome), and the Assyrian Church of the East. Other minor, modern related splinter groups include the Ancient Church of the East (split 1968 due to rejecting some changes made by Patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai) and the Chaldean Syrian Church. In 1995 the Chaldean Syrian Church reunified with the Assyrian Church of the East as an archbishopric. The Chaldean Syrian Church is headquartered in Thrissur, India. Together, the Assyrian, Ancient, Chaldean Syrian and Chaldean Catholic Church comprised over 1.6 million in 2018.

=== Assyrian (Syriac) Christian ===

Assyrian Christianity comprises those Eastern churches who kept the traditional Nestorian christology and ecclesiology of the historical Church of the East after the original church reunited with the Catholic Church in Rome, forming the Chaldean Catholic Church in 1552. Assyrian Christianity forms part of the Syriac Christian tradition. The Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East together had over 0.6 million members .

== Oriental Orthodox ==
The Oriental Orthodox Churches are the Christian churches adhering to Miaphysite christology and theology, with a combined global membership of 62 million . These churches reject the Council of Chalcedon in 451 and those after it. They departed from the state church of the Roman Empire after the Chalcedonian Council. Other denominations, such as the Eastern Orthodox Church and bodies in Old and True Orthodoxy, often label the Oriental Orthodox Churches as &quot;Monophysite&quot;. As the Oriental Orthodox do not adhere to the teachings of Eutyches, they themselves reject this label, preferring the term &quot;Miaphysite&quot;.

Historically, the Oriental Orthodox Churches considered themselves collectively to be the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church that Jesus founded. Some Christian denominations have recently considered the body of Oriental Orthodoxy to be a part of the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church—a view which is gaining increasing acceptance in the wake of ecumenical dialogues between groups such as Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman and Eastern Catholicism, and Protestant Christianity.

All canonical or mainstream Oriental Orthodox Churches are part of the World Council of Churches, though only five form the Standing Conference of Oriental Orthodox Churches. Throughout Oriental Orthodoxy, non-mainstream or non-canonical churches have passed in and out of recognition with the mainstream churches (e.g., British Orthodox Church).

==Eastern Orthodox==

Eastern Orthodoxy is one of the main Chalcedonian Christian branches, alongside Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. Each Eastern Orthodox church considers itself part of the one true church, and pre-denominational. Though they consider themselves pre-denominational, being the original Church of Christ before 1054, some scholars suggest the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic churches began after the East–West Schism.

=== Canonical Eastern Orthodox ===
The Eastern Orthodox Church, officially the Orthodox Catholic Church, claims continuity (based upon apostolic succession) with the early Church as part of the state church of Rome. The Eastern Orthodox Church had about 230 million members , making it the second largest single denomination behind the Catholic Church. Some of them have a disputed administrative status (i.e. their autonomy or autocephaly is not recognized universally). Eastern Orthodox churches by and large remain in communion with one another, although this has broken at times throughout its history. Two examples of impaired communion between the Orthodox churches include the Moscow–Constantinople schisms of 1996 and 2018. There are also independent churches subscribing to the Eastern Orthodox traditions.

=== Independent Eastern Orthodox ===
These Eastern Orthodox churches are not in communion with the mainstream or canonical Eastern Orthodox Church. Some of these denominations consider themselves as part of True Orthodoxy or the Old Believers. True Orthodoxy, or Genuine Orthodoxy, separated from the mainstream church over issues of ecumenism and calendar reform since the 1920s; and the Russian Old Believers refused to accept the liturgical and ritual changes made by Patriarch Nikon of Moscow between 1652 and 1666. Several Old Believer denominations have reunified with the Russian Orthodox Church and subsequent wider Eastern Orthodox communion.

==Catholic==

The Catholic Church, or Roman Catholic Church, is composed of 24 autonomous &quot;sui iuris&quot; particular churches: the Latin Church and the 23 Eastern Catholic Churches. It considers itself the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church that Christ founded, and which Saint Peter initiated along with the missionary work of Saint Paul and others. As such, the Catholic Church does not consider itself a denomination, but rather considers itself pre-denominational, the original Church of Christ. Continuity is claimed based upon apostolic succession with the early Church. The Catholic population exceeds 1.3 billion , making up the majority of Western Christianity. Stemming from the one Roman Catholic institution, there exists several Independent Catholic churches which have expanded the Catholic denominational family, becoming Old and Old Roman Catholicism, and Liberal Catholics.

===Latin (Roman) Catholic===

The Latin Church is the largest and most widely known of the 24 &quot;sui iuris&quot; churches that together make up the Catholic Church. It is headed by the Bishop of Rome—the Pope—with headquarters in Vatican City, enclaved within Rome, Italy. , the Latin Church comprised 1.255 billion members.

===Eastern (Oriental) Catholic===

All of the following are particular churches of the Catholic Church. They are all in communion with the Pope as Bishop of Rome and acknowledge his claim of universal jurisdiction and authority. They have some minor distinct theological emphases and expressions (for instance, in the case of those that are of Greek/Byzantine tradition, concerning some non-doctrinal aspects of the Latin view of Purgatory and clerical celibacy). The Eastern Catholic Churches and the Latin Church (which are united in the worldwide Catholic Church) share the same doctrine and sacraments, and thus the same faith. The total membership of the churches accounted for approximately 18 million members .

=== Independent Catholic ===
Independent Catholics consists of those denominations embodying catholicity, and have initially separated from the Latin Church in 1724 through the consecrations of bishops for the present-day Old Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht without papal approval. Largely distinguished by their rejection of papal infallibility and supremacy, most Independent Catholic churches are unrecognized by the Vatican, although their sacraments have been recognized as valid but illicit.

==Protestant==

Protestantism is a movement within Christianity which owes its name to the 1529 Protestation at Speyer, but originated in 1517 when Martin Luther began his dispute with the Roman Catholic Church. This period of time, known as the Reformation, began a series of events resulting over the next 500 years in several newly denominated churches (listed below). Some denominations were started by intentionally dividing themselves from the Roman Catholic Church, such as in the case of the English Reformation while others, such as with Luther&#x27;s followers, were excommunicated after attempting reform. New denominations and organizations formed through further divisions within Protestant churches since the Reformation began. A denomination labeled &quot;Protestant&quot; subscribes to the fundamental Protestant principles—though not always—that is scripture alone, justification by faith alone, and the universal priesthood of believers.

The majority of contemporary Protestants are members of Adventism, Anglicanism, the Baptist churches, Calvinism (Reformed Protestantism), Lutheranism, Methodism and Pentecostalism. Nondenominational, Evangelical, charismatic, neo-charismatic, independent, Convergence, and other churches are on the rise, and constitute a significant part of Protestant Christianity.

This list gives only an overview, and certainly does not mention all of the Protestant denominations. The exact number of Protestant denominations, including the members of the denominations, is difficult to calculate and depends on definition. A group that fits the generally accepted definition of &quot;Protestant&quot; might not officially use the term. Therefore, it should be taken with caution. The most accepted figure among various authors and scholars includes around 900 million to a little over 1 billion Protestant Christians.

===Proto-Protestant===

Proto-Protestantism refers to movements similar to the Protestant Reformation, but before 1517, when Martin Luther (1483–1546) is reputed to have nailed the &quot;Ninety-Five-Theses&quot; to the church door. Major early Reformers were Peter Waldo (c. 1140–c. 1205), John Wycliffe (1320s–1384), and Jan Hus (c. 1369–1415). It is not completely correct to call these groups Protestant due to the fact that some of them had nothing to do with the 1529 protestation at Speyer which coined the term Protestant. In particular, the Utraquists were eventually accommodated as a separate Catholic rite by the papacy after a military attempt to end their movement failed. On the other hand, the surviving Waldensians ended up joining Reformed Protestantism, so it is not completely inaccurate to refer to their movement as Protestant; the Waldensian Evangelical Church is a well known existing body in that tradition. The Hussites are presently represented in the Moravian Church, Unity of the Brethren and the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.

===Lutheran===

Lutherans are a major branch of Protestantism, identifying with the theology of Martin Luther, a German friar, ecclesiastical reformer, and theologian. Lutheranism initially began as an attempt to reform the Catholic Church before the excommunication of its members. Lutherans are divided among High Church, Confessional, Pietist and Liberal churchmanships, though these can overlap, e.g. the Communion of Nordic Lutheran Dioceses is High Church and Confessional. The whole of Lutheranism had about 70-90 million members in 2018. The largest non-United Lutheran denomination was the Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus, an Eastern Protestant Christian group.

===Radical Pietist===

Those who separated from established Lutheran churches to form their own denominations are known as Radical Pietists (as opposed to Pietistic Lutherans, who remain in the Lutheran churches (such as the Church of the Lutheran Brethren) and combine its emphasis on Biblical doctrine with the importance of individual piety and living a holy Christian life. Although the Radical Pietists broke with Lutheranism, its influence on Anglicanism, in particular John Wesley, led to the spawning of the Methodist movement.

===Reformed===
Calvinism, also known as the Reformed tradition or Reformed Protestantism is a movement which broke from the Catholic Church in the 16th century. Reformed Christianity is represented in the Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, and Congregationalist traditions, along with Reformed Anglican and Reformed Baptist denominations (the latter two are listed under the Anglican and Baptist sections of this article, respectively). Calvinism follows the theological traditions set down by John Calvin, John Knox and other Reformation-era theologians. Calvinists differ from Lutherans on the nature of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, theories of worship, and the use of God&#x27;s law for believers, among other things. There are from 60 to 80 million Christians identifying as Reformed or Calvinist according to statistics gathered in 2018.

===Anglican===
Anglicanism or Episcopalianism has referred to itself as the &quot;via media&quot; between Lutheranism and Reformed Christianity, as well as between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. The majority of Anglicans consider themselves part of the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church within the Anglican Communion. Anglicans or Episcopalians also self-identify as both Catholic and Reformed. Although the use of the term &quot;Protestant&quot; to refer to Anglicans was once common, it is controversial today, with some rejecting the label and others accepting it. Anglicans numbered over 85 million in 2018.

There are numerous churches following the Anglican tradition that are not in full communion with the Anglican Communion. Some churches split due to changes in the Book of Common Prayer and the ordination of women, forming Anglo-Catholic, Anglican Papal or Evangelical Anglican communities. A select few of these churches are recognized by certain individual provinces of the Anglican Communion.

===Anabaptist===
The Anabaptists trace their origins to the Radical Reformation. Alternative to other early Protestants, Anabaptists were seen as an early offshoot of Protestantism, although the view has been challenged by some Anabaptists. There were approximately 2.1 million Anabaptists as of 2015. Anabaptists are categorized into Old Order Anabaptism (such as the Old Brethren German Baptist), Conservative Anabaptism (such as the Pilgrim Mennonite Conference, Beachy Amish and Dunkard Brethren Church), and mainline/assimilated Anabaptism.

===Baptist===

Baptists emerged in 1609 under the teachings of John Smyth, and along with Methodism, grew in size and influence after they sailed to the New World (the remaining Puritans who traveled to the New World were Congregationalists). Some Baptists fit strongly with the Reformed tradition theologically but not denominationally. Some Baptists also adopt presbyterian and episcopal forms of governance. In 2018, there were about 75-105 million Baptists.

===Methodist===

The Methodist movement emerged out the work of Anglican priest John Wesley, who taught a personal conversion to Christ (the New Birth) and holiness of heart. Calling it &quot;the grand depositum&quot; of the Methodist faith, Wesley specifically taught that the propagation of the doctrine of entire sanctification was the reason that God raised up the Methodists in the world. While some Methodists retained the episcopacy (such as the Free Methodist Church, Global Methodist Church and United Methodist Church), others, such as the Congregational Methodist Church have a congregational polity. Methodists were among the first Christians to accept women&#x27;s ordination since the Montanists. Some 60-80 million Christians are Methodists and members of the World Methodist Council. The holiness movement emerged within Methodism in the 19th-century. , churches of the movement had an estimated 12 million adherents. As Methodist denominations have historically preached two works of grace taught by John Wesley, (1) New Birth and (2) entire sanctification, and many denominations aligned with the holiness movement use Methodist in their name, it is difficult to draw a line between Holiness Methodist denominations and those not aligned with the holiness movement. For example, the Free Methodist Church and the Church of the Nazarene are widely regarded as being aligned with the holiness movement and are core members of the World Methodist Council, along with denominations with mixed churchmanship, such as the United Methodist Church.

====Albright Brethren====
The Albright Brethren were organized under the leadership of Jacob Albright, who converted to Methodism and preached to German-speaking people. Although the majority of the Albright Brethren merged with the United Brethren, two extant bodies continue today:
*Evangelical Church (ECNA)
*Evangelical Association

===Evening Light===
Churches of the Evening Light Reformation in 1880 emerged under the direction of Daniel Sidney Warner, and while they emerged under the influence of the holiness movement, they adhere to a position of antidenominationalism. Classified as &quot;Holiness Restorationists&quot;, the Church of God (Anderson, Indiana) was the original work founded by Warner and its conservative holiness offshoot is the Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma). While the Church of God (Restoration) is listed here, it is distinguished from the two aforementioned bodies by unique doctrines that have taken it in a direction of its own. 

* Church of God (Anderson, Indiana)

===Keswickian===

The Higher Life movement emerged in the United Kingdom and emphasized the importance of sanctification, &quot;the deeper and higher life&quot;. It became popularized through the Keswick Conventions; W.E. Boardman&#x27;s Keswickian theology had an influence on A.B. Simpson, who established the Christian and Missionary Alliance.
*Alliance World Fellowship

===Quaker===
Quakers, or Friends, originated under the work of George Fox, who taught personal conversion to Christ, along with the doctrine of Christian perfection. The Friends have historically held that Christians are guided by the inward light to &quot;make the witness of God&quot; known to everyone.

===Pentecostal and Charismatic===


Pentecostalism and Charismatic Christianity began in the 1900s. The two movements emphasize direct personal experience of God through baptism with the Holy Spirit. They represent some of the largest growing movements in Protestant Christianity. Pentecostalism is divided between its original branch, Holiness Pentecostalism (which teaches three works of grace) and Finished Work Pentecostalism (which views sanctification only in a progressive manner). Oneness Pentecostalism, which rejects the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, split from Finished Work Pentecostalism and is covered in its own section in this article. The charismatic movement was established within historic denominational traditions due to influence from Pentecostalism, e.g. the Catholic Charismatic Renewal in Roman Catholicism. According to the Pew Research Center, Pentecostals and Charismatics numbered some 280 million people in 2011.

===== P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay =====

P&#x27;ent&#x27;ay, simply known as Ethiopian-Eritrean Evangelicalism, are a group of indigenous Protestant Eastern Baptist, Lutheran, Pentecostal, and Mennonite denominations in full communion with each other and believe that Ethiopian and Eritrean Evangelicalism are the reformation of the current Orthodox Tewahedo churches as well as the restoration of it to original Ethiopian Christianity. They uphold that in order for a person to be saved one has to accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior for the forgiveness of sins; and to receive Christ one must be &quot;born again&quot; (). Its members make up a significant portion of the 2 million Eastern Protestant tradition.

Most Latter Day Saint denominations are derived from the Church of Christ established by Joseph Smith in 1830. The largest worldwide denomination of this movement, and the one publicly recognized as Mormonism, is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Some sects, known as the &quot;Prairie Saints&quot;, broke away because they did not recognize Brigham Young as the head of the church, and did not follow him West in the mid-1800s. Other sects broke away over the abandonment of practicing plural marriage after the 1890 Manifesto. Other denominations are defined by either a belief in Joseph Smith as a prophet or acceptance of the Book of Mormon as scripture. The Latter Day Saints comprise over 17 million members collectively.

<doc id="211154" wikidata="Q239844" url="?curid=211154" title="Nakhon Sawan province">
<text>Nakhon Sawan (, , ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;). It lies in lower northern Thailand, neighbouring the provinces of Kamphaeng Phet, Phichit, Phetchabun, Lopburi, Sing Buri, Chai Nat, Uthai Thani, and Tak (clockwise from north).

==Toponymy==
The word &quot;nakhon&quot; originates from the Sanskrit word &quot;nagara&quot; meaning &#x27;city&#x27;, and the word &quot;sawan&quot; from Sanskrit &quot;svarga&quot; meaning &#x27;heaven&#x27;. Hence the name of the province literally means &#x27;city of heaven&#x27; or &#x27;heavenly city&#x27;.

==History==
Nakhon Sawan province was a city since Dvaravati era. While part of the Sukhothai Kingdom, it was called &quot;Mueang&quot; Phra Bang, the southern frontier city of Sukhothai. Later within the Ayutthaya kingdom it was an important trade center because of its location at the two major rivers from the north. It also was the common meeting point of Burmese troops before moving to attack Ayutthaya. In the reign of King Taksin the Great, Phra Bang became a Siamese military base to prevent further Burmese attacks.

When King Mongkut signed the Bowring Treaty with Britain the glorious time of Nakhon Sawan began, as it became the main rice and teak trading centre. However the opening of the northern railway in 1922, the economic crisis before 1932 revolution, and finally the opening of Dejativongse bridge and Phahonyothin highway in 1950 each decreased the importance of water transportation and thus made Nakhon Sawan less important.

When in 1895 King Chulalongkorn established the monthon as part of the &quot;Thesaphiban&quot; administrative reform, Nakhon Sawan became capital city of Monthon Nakhon Sawan.

The 4th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Area Army is based in Nakhon Sawan. It is responsible for defending the northwestern border with Burma, from Mae Hong Son in the north to Kanchanaburi in the south.

==Geography==
The Ping and Nan rivers merge near the city of Nakhon Sawan to form the Chao Phraya River. Mae Wong National Park, on the border with Khamphaeng Phet province, was created in 1987 to preserve the woodlands of Mae Wong-Mae Poen. The forested area covers or 9.7 percent of provincial area.

Bueng Boraphet is the largest freshwater wetland in Thailand, in total covering 212 km2. The swamp is directly east of the town Nakhon Sawan and extends into the districts of Tha Tako and Chum Saeng. During the winter months many waterfowl migrate there. Parts of the swamp, covering 106 km2, are protected as a non-hunting area.

There is one national park, along with two other national parks, make up region 12 (Nakhon Sawan) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.

<text>Mississippi State University for Agriculture and Applied Science, commonly known as Mississippi State University (MSU), is a public land-grant research university in Mississippi State, Mississippi, United States. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity&quot; and has a total research and development budget of $239.4 million, the largest in Mississippi.

The university was chartered as Mississippi Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College on February 28, 1878, and admitted its first students in 1880. Organized into 12 colleges and schools, the university offers over 180 baccalaureate, graduate, and professional degree programs, and is home to Mississippi&#x27;s only accredited programs in architecture and veterinary medicine. Mississippi State participates in the National Sea Grant College Program and National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program. The university&#x27;s main campus in Starkville is supplemented by auxiliary campuses in Meridian, Gautier, and Biloxi.

Mississippi State&#x27;s intercollegiate sports teams, the Mississippi State Bulldogs, compete in NCAA Division I athletics as members of the Southeastern Conference&#x27;s western division. Mississippi State was a founding member of the SEC in 1932. In their more-than 120-year history, the Bulldogs have won 21 individual national championships, 30 regular season conference championships, and 1 national championship title. The school is noted for a pervasive baseball fan culture, with Dudy Noble Field holding 22 of the top 25 all-time NCAA attendance records and the school&#x27;s Left Field Lounge being described as an epicenter of college baseball.

==History==
The university began as The Agricultural and Mechanical College of the State of Mississippi (or Mississippi A&amp;M), one of the national land-grant colleges established after Congress passed the Morrill Act in 1862. It was created by the Mississippi Legislature on February 28, 1878, to fulfill the mission of offering training in &quot;agriculture, horticulture and the mechanical arts ... without excluding other scientific and classical studies, including military tactics.&quot; The university received its first students in the fall of 1880 in the presidency of General Stephen D. Lee.

In 1887 Congress passed the Hatch Act, which provided for the establishment of the Agricultural Experiment Station in 1888. The Cooperative Extension Service was established in 1914 by the Smith-Lever Act. The university has since had its mission expanded and redefined by the Legislature. In 1932, the Legislature renamed the university as Mississippi State College.

In 1958 the Legislature renamed the university Mississippi State University in recognition of its academic development and addition of graduate programs. The Graduate School had been organized (1936), doctoral degree programs had begun (1951), the School of Forest Resources had been established (1954), and the College of Arts and Sciences had replaced the General Science School (1956).

The university was desegregated in July 1965, when Richard E. Holmes, a graduate of Henderson High School in Starkville, became the first African-American student to enroll. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed by Congress the year before, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was being debated, and the United States Supreme Court had ruled in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional.

The School of Architecture admitted its first students in 1973, the College of Veterinary Medicine admitted its first class in 1977. The MSU Vet school (commonly referred to as the CVM) is the largest veterinary school under one roof in the nation. The School of Accountancy was established in 1979.

The University Honors Program was founded in 1968 to provide more rigorous course curricula for academically talented students and support guest lecture series, forums, and distinguished external scholarships. The program has been vastly expanded and has a separate college. This was made possible by funding by Bobby Shackouls, an MSU alumnus and retired CEO, who donated US$10 million to found the Judy and Bobby Shackouls Honors College in April 2006.

MSU also started a joint Ph.D. program in engineering with San Jose State University in California, allowing an increase in research for both universities, as well as enhancing the stature of both engineering colleges.

In March 2009, Mississippi State announced the conclusion of the university&#x27;s seven-year capital campaign, with more than $462 million received in private gifts and pledges.

On March 24, 2012, a 21-year-old student at the university named John Sanderson was shot twice in the torso and killed inside the Evans Hall Dormitory on campus by a small caliber handgun. Three men, Mason Perry Jones, Trent DeUndra Crump, and Duntae Harvey, were captured in connection with the slaying. Mason Perry Jones later pled guilty to murder and was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole.

==Campuses==
The main campus is mostly in the Mississippi State census-designated place, with a small part in Starkville.

Mississippi State&#x27;s campus is centered on the main quadrangle, called the &quot;Drill Field&quot; due to its heavy use by the Corps of Cadets prior to the end of World War II. The Drill Field is defined at its north and south ends by the mirror-image buildings, &quot;Lee Hall&quot; and &quot;Swalm Hall&quot;. Old Main was the original dormitory, west of Lee Hall; it burned in a tragic fire, and was replaced by the Colvard Student Union. The largest building fronting the Drill Field is Mitchell Memorial Library.

From the Drill Field, the campus radiates in all directions. The College of Engineering can be found mostly to the east side of the Drill Field; to the north are the Arts and Sciences, including Computer Science, and the College of Architecture, Art, and Design. Humanities are found to the south, while Agriculture dominates the west section. To the west and northwest are also found the athletic facilities, including Scott Field and the Humphrey Coliseum, or &quot;The Hump&quot;.

Beyond the main campus (and the series of commuter parking lots ringing the main campus) are the North and South Farms. While still used for their original purpose of agricultural research, the Farms are also host to newer facilities, such as the astronomical observatory and Veterinary College (South Farm) and the High Performance Computing Collaboratory (North Farm). At the far west of campus, one finds first the fraternity and sorority houses, and beyond them the Cotton District and downtown Starkville, Mississippi. The university is also home to the Thad Cochran Research, Technology and Economic Development Park, which host many of the university&#x27;s research centers, such as the Center for Advanced Vehicular Systems (CAVS) and the nationally recognized Social Science Research Center.

The Williams Building, which houses the MSU Police Department and the Faculty Senate, was designed by architect Emmett J. Hull.

Mississippi State University operates an off-campus, degree-granting center in Meridian, Mississippi that offers undergraduate and graduate programs. In cooperation with the U.S. Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station, the College of Engineering offers the Master of Science degree to students in Vicksburg, Mississippi.

===Mitchell Memorial Library===

The Mitchell Memorial Library is in the heart of the campus, on the eastern side of the Drill Field. The library has a collection of 2,124,341 volumes and 70,331 journals.

Mississippi State is one of the few universities to house presidential papers. In May 2012, on the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Ulysses S. Grant Association, Mississippi State University was selected as the permanent location for Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Presidential Library. President Grant&#x27;s artifacts are to remain permanently at the Mitchell Memorial Library on the MSU campus. These include Grant&#x27;s letters and photographs during his presidency, from 1869 to 1877. The MSU library catalogued and cross-referenced 15,000 linear feet of material. Grant&#x27;s letters have been edited and published in 32 volumes by the Ulysses S. Grant Association and the Southern Illinois University Press.

The library is also home to the Congressional and Political Research Center, which is on the first floor. This center, established in November 1999, houses the collections of US Senator John C. Stennis and Congressman G. V. Montgomery, nicknamed &quot;Sonny&quot;. Their careers spanned a total of 72 years of service as Congressional leaders. The center also provides research materials and information on individual US Senators and Representatives, the US Congress, and politics at all levels of government.

Among the library&#x27;s premier collections is that of internationally known author John Grisham, an MSU alumnus who donated his papers to the university in 1989. Grisham&#x27;s collection, now consisting of over 42 cubic feet, has also attracted national attention to the library. Materials from the Grisham papers are on display in Mitchell Memorial Library&#x27;s John Grisham Room (3rd floor), which opened in May 1998. The libraries also receive his published works, including foreign-language translations.

In 2000, the Charles H. Templeton Collection, which includes over 200 nineteenth- and twentieth-century music instruments, 22,000 pieces of sheet music, and 13,000 records, was transferred to the Libraries. According to author and musicologist David A. Jasen, the Templeton Collection contains the most complete collection of Victor Talking Machines from their debut in 1897 to 1930. This collection was valued at over $495,000 in 1989. Items from the collection are on display at the Templeton Music Museum on the 4th floor of Mitchell Memorial Library. In 2001, a digitization project was established to digitize and provide access to the entire sheet music collection. The project has digitized, archived, and cataloged over 6,000 pieces of music.

The library hosts the Charles Templeton Ragtime Jazz Festival, an annual event including lectures and live performance of historic and contemporary ragtime. The festival debuted in March 2007, the first of its kind in Mississippi. The multi-day event features seminars, tours of the Templeton Music Museum, and concerts by ragtime and jazz musicians.

===The Junction===

Formerly the poorly-conceived convergence of five often-congested roadways and, earlier, a rail line, this student-inspired concept got its name from the term &quot;Malfunction Junction&quot;, the informal name of the crossroads prior to the vacation and rerouting of some of the roadways. This resulted in improved traffic flow and ample new green space for leisure activities and events, including football tailgating.
Anchored by Davis Wade Stadium, Barnes &amp; Noble Bookstore and the University Welcome Center, the Junction is the focal point of a pedestrian-friendly central campus and a significant gathering place for students, alumni and visitors. It is linked by paved walkways and green space to the university&#x27;s other manicured &quot;lawn&quot;, the historic Drill Field.

==Academics==
U.S. News &amp; World Report National Rankings
Mississippi State University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award baccalaureate, master&#x27;s, specialist, and doctoral degrees. The university has the following colleges and schools:
As of fall 2021, Mississippi State&#x27;s enrollment was 23,086. The university has 160 buildings, and the grounds comprise about 4,200 acres (17 km2), including farms, pastures, and woodlands of the Experiment Station. The university also owns an additional 80,000 acres (320 km2) across the state.

==Student life==
MSU has over 300 student organizations. Prominent groups include the Student Association, Famous Maroon Band, MSU Road Runners, Alumni Delegates, Maroon VIP, Lambda Sigma, Orientation Leaders, 18 fraternities and 11 sororities, the Residence Hall Association, the Black Student Alliance, the Mississippi State University College Democrats and Republicans, Music Maker Productions, the Baptist Student Union, the Engineering Student Council, Arnold Air Society, the Stennis-Montgomery Association and ChallengeX. The University Recreation department oversees the intramural sports program. There are many international student organizations active on campus, including the Nepalese Student Association and ISA, which organize various programs to educate students about their culture and traditions. The national literary magazine &quot;Jabberwock Review&quot; is also based at MSU.

===Student media===
Mississippi State&#x27;s local radio station is WMSV.

Prior to WMSV, Mississippi State had a student-run radio station, WMSB, which went off the air permanently at the end of the spring semester of 1986. WMSB was a low-power FM station with studios on the top floor of Lee Hall. WMSB was begun in the fall semester of 1971 in a freshman dorm room on the third floor of Critz Hall, utilizing an FM stereo transmitter that was designed and built as a high school science fair project by one of the station&#x27;s founders. The station&#x27;s original call letters were RHOM. Later, funding was solicited from the Student Association. Funding was approved, the low-power RCA FM transmitter was ordered and the call letters WMSB were issued by the FCC. The station was moved to studios on the top floor of Lee Hall that were formerly occupied by a student-run AM station.

The student newspaper is &quot;The Reflector&quot;, published twice per week on Tuesday and Friday. The publication was named the #1 college newspaper in the South in 2007 by the Southeast Journalism Conference. In recent years, &quot;The Reflector&quot; has remained in the top 10 college newspapers in the South.

===Music scene===
Mississippi State is home to WMSV, the campus radio station.

During the spring semester the Old Main Music Festival takes place, it is also free to the public, and is held on the Mississippi State Campus.

The city of Starkville and the Mississippi State campus have been a tour stop for many artists, including a visit in 1965 by Johnny Cash. After Cash&#x27;s performance he was arrested, which led him to write the song &quot;Starkville City Jail&quot;.

===Lecture series===
Every semester Mississippi State has several distinguished speakers; these have included best selling authors Greg Mortenson and Mississippi State alumnus John Grisham, former United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Academy Award-nominated Spike Lee, television science show hosts Jeff Lieberman and Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson. Nobel laureates including Sir Harry Kroto (1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry), J. M. G. Le Clézio (2008 Nobel Prize in Literature) and Joseph Stiglitz (2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences) have also appeared.

===Greek life===
Mississippi State&#x27;s Greek system comprises 20 fraternities (IFC and NPHC) and 14 sororities (Panhellenic and NPHC). In 2019, 24% of undergraduate men and 18% of undergraduate women were active in MSU&#x27;s Greek system.

==Athletics==

<text>Udon Thani (, ) is a city in Isan (Northeast Thailand), the capital of Udon Thani Province and the sixth largest city in Thailand. The city municipality (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot; / city proper) had a population of 130,531 people as of 2019, while Udon Thani&#x27;s urban area, Mueang Udon Thani, has a population of approximately 400,000. 
Udon Thani is one of four major cities in Isan, the others being Nakhon Ratchasima, Ubon Ratchathani, and Khon Kaen. Together they are known as the &quot;big four of Isan&quot;.

==Location==
Udon is approximately 560 km from Bangkok. It is a major official and commercial center in northern Isan, Thailand, and the gateway to Laos, northern Vietnam, and southern China.

==History==

The city&#x27;s economy was boosted by the proximity to Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base during the Vietnam War and retains reminders of that time in the form of bars, coffee shops, and hotels. &quot;Udon sort of became like Pattaya when the GIs arrived,&quot; said a local architect. &quot;Restaurants serving Western cuisine, hotels and nightclubs sprouted up everywhere to meet their needs. It was an extremely busy city back then.&quot;

The BBC has reported that Udon Thani&#x27;s Royal Air Force Base was the site of a CIA black site, known to insiders as &quot;Detention Site Green&quot;, used to interrogate Abu Zubaydah, Saudi-born Palestinian, believed to be one of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s top lieutenants. In December 2014 the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) published an executive summary of a secret 6,000-page report on CIA techniques. The report alleges that at least eight Thai senior officials knew of the secret site. The site was closed in December 2002.

Earlier reports alleged that a Voice of America relay station in a rural area of Udon Thani Province, Ban Dung District, was the CIA black site.

==Administration==

Udon Thani town municipality (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) with an area of was established on 15 March 1936. On 27 May 1953, the area covered by the municipality was increased to . As a result of the town&#x27;s continuing growth, the total area of the municipality was enlarged for the second time to . on 31 December 1993. On 25 September 1995 Udon Thani was upgraded to city municipality (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;), and is divided into 21 sub-districts (tambons), which are further subdivided into 248 villages (mubans). (&quot;chumchon&quot;), 130,531 people in 60,659 households.

==Transport==

Udon Thani International Airport, close to the city centre (within the ring road), serves a number of domestic airports: Chiang Mai International Airport, U-Tapao International Airport (Pattaya), and Phuket, with approximately 24 daily flights to Bangkok (Don Mueang International and Suvarnabhumi Airport). During the 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic flights were reduced to 10-14 daily to Bangkok airports only.

Udon Thani railway station in the city centre receives four trains daily from Bangkok railway station (Hua Lamphong) including overnight sleepers.

==Economy==
===Mining===
Asia Pacific Potash Corporation (APPC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Italian-Thai Development PLC, owns the concession to the Udon North and Udon South potash mines and plans to develop them. Potash deposits in northeast Thailand are believed to contain the world&#x27;s third-largest—after Canada and Russia—unexploited potash reserves. Potash is one of the main components of agricultural fertilizer.

<text>A radio galaxy is a galaxy with giant regions of radio emission extending well beyond its visible structure. These energetic radio lobes are powered by jets from its active galactic nucleus. They have luminosities up to 1039 W at radio wavelengths between 10 MHz and 100 GHz. The radio emission is due to the synchrotron process. The observed structure in radio emission is determined by the interaction between twin jets and the external medium, modified by the effects of relativistic beaming. The host galaxies are almost exclusively large elliptical galaxies. &quot;Radio-loud&quot; active galaxies can be detected at large distances, making them valuable tools for observational cosmology. Recently, much work has been done on the effects of these objects on the intergalactic medium, particularly in galaxy groups and clusters.

The term &quot;radio galaxy&quot; is often used to refer to the entire jet system, rather than solely to its host galaxy. Some scientists consider the term &quot;black hole jet system&quot; more accurate and less confusing. Radio galaxies that reach the size of around 0.7 megaparsecs or more, are commonly called &quot;giant radio galaxies&quot;.

== Emission processes ==

The radio emission from radio-loud active galaxies is synchrotron emission, as inferred from its very smooth, broad-band nature and strong polarization. This implies that the radio-emitting plasma contains, at least, electrons with relativistic speeds (Lorentz factors of ~104) and magnetic fields. Since the plasma must be neutral, it must also contain either protons or positrons. There is no way of determining the particle content directly from observations of synchrotron radiation. Moreover, there is no way to determine the energy densities in particles and magnetic fields from observation: the same synchrotron emissivity may be a result of a few electrons and a strong field, or a weak field and many electrons, or something in between. It is possible to determine a minimum energy condition which is the minimum energy density that a region with a given emissivity can have, but for many years there was no particular reason to believe that the true energies were anywhere near the minimum energies.

A sister process to the synchrotron radiation is the inverse-Compton process, in which the relativistic electrons interact with ambient photons and Thomson scatter them to high energies. Inverse-Compton emission from radio-loud sources turns out to be particularly important in X-rays, and, because it depends only on the density of electrons, a detection of inverse-Compton scattering allows a somewhat model-dependent estimate of the energy densities in the particles and magnetic fields. This has been used to argue that many powerful sources are actually quite near the minimum-energy condition.

Synchrotron radiation is not confined to radio wavelengths: if the radio source can accelerate particles to high enough energies, features that are detected in the radio wavelengths may also be seen in the infrared, optical, ultraviolet or even X-ray. In the latter case the responsible electrons must have energies in excess of 1 TeV in typical magnetic field strengths. Again, polarization and continuum spectrum are used to distinguish the synchrotron radiation from other emission processes. Jets and hotspots are the usual sources of high-frequency synchrotron emission. It is hard to distinguish observationally between the synchrotron and inverse-Compton radiation, making them a subject of ongoing research.

Processes, collectively known as particle acceleration, produce populations of relativistic and non-thermal particles that give rise to synchrotron and inverse-Compton radiation. Fermi acceleration is one plausible particle acceleration process in radio-loud active galaxies.

== Radio structures ==
Radio galaxies, and to a lesser extent, radio-loud quasars display a wide range of structures in radio maps. The most common large-scale structures are called &quot;lobes&quot;: these are double, often fairly symmetrical, roughly ellipsoidal structures placed on either side of the active nucleus. A significant minority of low-luminosity sources exhibit structures usually known as &quot;plumes&quot; which are much more elongated. Some radio galaxies show one or two long narrow features known as &quot;jets&quot; (the most famous example being the giant galaxy M87 in the Virgo cluster) coming directly from the nucleus and going to the lobes. Since the 1970s, the most widely accepted model has been that the lobes or plumes are powered by &quot;beams&quot; of high-energy particles and magnetic field coming from close to the active nucleus. The jets are believed to be the visible manifestations of the beams, and often the term &quot;jet&quot; is used to refer both to the observable feature and to the underlying flow.
In 1974, radio sources were divided by Bernard Fanaroff and Julia Riley into two classes, now known as Fanaroff and Riley Class I (FRI) and Class II (FRII). The distinction was originally made based on the morphology of the large-scale radio emission (the type was determined by the distance between the brightest points in the radio emission): FRI sources were brightest towards the centre, while FRII sources were brightest at the edges. Fanaroff and Riley observed that there was a reasonably sharp divide in luminosity between the two classes: FRIs were low-luminosity, FRIIs were high luminosity. With more detailed radio observations, the morphology turns out to reflect the method of energy transport in the radio source. FRI objects typically have bright jets in the centre, while FRIIs have faint jets but bright &quot;hotspots&quot; at the ends of the lobes. FRIIs appear to be able to transport energy efficiently to the ends of the lobes, while FRI beams are inefficient in the sense that they radiate a significant amount of their energy away as they travel.

In more detail, the FRI/FRII division depends on host-galaxy environment in the sense that the FRI/FRII transition appears at higher luminosity in more massive galaxies. FRI jets are known to be decelerating in the regions in which their radio emission is brightest, and so it seems that the FRI/FRII transition reflects whether a jet/beam can propagate through the host galaxy without being decelerated to sub-relativistic speeds by interaction with the intergalactic medium. From analysis of relativistic beaming effects, the jets of FRII sources are known to remain relativistic (with speeds of at least 0.5c) out to the ends of the lobes. The hotspots that are usually seen in FRII sources are interpreted as being the visible manifestations of shocks formed when the supersonic jet abruptly terminates at the end of the source, and their spectral energy distributions are consistent with this picture. Often multiple hotspots are seen, reflecting either continued outflow after the shock or movement of the jet termination point: the overall hotspot region is sometimes called the hotspot complex.

Names are given to several particular types of radio source based on their radio structure:
* &quot;Classical double&quot; refers to an FRII source with clear hotspots.
* &quot;Wide-angle tail&quot; normally refers to a source intermediate between standard FRI and FRII structure, with efficient jets and sometimes hotspots, but with plumes rather than lobes, found at or near the centres of clusters.
* &quot;Narrow-angle tail&quot; or &quot;Head-tail source&quot; describes an FRI that appears to be bent by ram pressure as it moves through a cluster.
* &quot;Fat doubles&quot; are sources with diffuse lobes but neither jets nor hotspots. Some such sources may be &quot;relics&quot; whose energy supply has been permanently or temporarily turned off.

== Life cycles and dynamics ==

The largest radio galaxies have lobes or plumes extending to megaparsec scales (more in the case of giant radio galaxies like 3C236), implying a timescale for growth of the order of tens to hundreds of millions of years. This means that, except in the case of very small, very young sources, we cannot observe radio source dynamics directly, and so must resort to theory and inferences from large numbers of objects. Clearly, radio sources must start small and grow larger. In the case of sources with lobes, the dynamics are fairly simple: the jets feed the lobes, the pressure of the lobes increases and the lobes expand. How fast they expand depends on the density and pressure of the external medium. The highest-pressure phase of the external medium, and thus the most important phase from the point of view of the dynamics, is the X-ray emitting diffuse hot gas. For a long time, it was assumed that powerful sources would expand supersonically, pushing a shock through the external medium. However, X-ray observations show that the internal lobe pressures of powerful FRII sources are often close to the external thermal pressures and not much higher than the external pressures, as would be required for supersonic expansion. The only unambiguously supersonically expanding system known consists of the inner lobes of the low-power radio galaxy Centaurus A which are probably a result of a comparatively recent outburst of the active nucleus.

== Host galaxies and environments ==

These radio sources are almost always found hosted by elliptical galaxies. , Some nearby Seyfert galaxies show weak, small radio jets, but they are neither luminous enough, in radio bands, to be classified as radio-loud nor they are 10-100 times larger than the host spiral galaxies to be comparable to standard radio galaxies. Some observations about the host galaxies of radio-loud quasars and blazars suggest that they are also hosted by elliptical galaxies. There are several possible reasons for this very strong preference for ellipticals. One is that ellipticals generally contain the most massive black holes, and so are capable of powering the most luminous active galaxies (see Eddington luminosity). Another is that ellipticals generally inhabit richer environments, providing a large-scale intergalactic medium to confine the radio source. It may also be that the larger amounts of cold gas in spiral galaxies in some way disrupts or stifles a forming jet. To date there is no compelling single explanation for the observations.

However, since the discovery of the exotic radio galaxy Speca in the year 2011 the number of large-scale radio galaxies hosted in disk/spiral galaxies have been steadily growing. The first such odd-ball radio galaxy was discovered over a decade ago, in 1998 namely J0313-192 in the Abell 428 cluster of galaxies. Possibly due to availability of new sensitive radio and optical all sky surveys the number of such &quot;Speca-like objects&quot; or Spiral-DRAGNs have increased to up to three dozens. Speca-like such radio galaxies can launch not only giant mega-parsec scale lobes but also be episodic in their nature hosting two pairs of relativistic magnetised plasma lobes. The host spiral galaxies can also be extremely massive spirals and mostly are red in optical colour compared to typical spiral galaxies. It has been speculated that such galaxies may be more common in early Universe when there were less number of ellipticals than spirals. 

== Unified models ==

The different types of radio-loud active galaxies are linked by unified models. The key observation that led to the adoption of unified models for powerful radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars was that all quasars appear to be beamed towards us, showing superluminal motion in the cores and bright jets on the side of the source nearest to us (the &quot;Laing-Garrington effect&quot;:). If this is the case, there must be a population of objects not beamed towards us, and, since we know the lobes are not affected by beaming, they would appear as radio galaxies, provided that the quasar nucleus is obscured when the source is seen side-on. It is now accepted that at least some powerful radio galaxies have &#x27;hidden&#x27; quasars, though it is not clear whether all such radio galaxies would be quasars if viewed from the right angle. In a similar way, low-power radio galaxies are a plausible parent population for BL Lac objects.

== Uses of radio galaxies ==

=== Distant sources ===

Radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars have been widely used, particularly in the 80s and 90s, to find distant galaxies: by selecting based on radio spectrum and then observing the host galaxy it was possible to find objects at high redshift at modest cost in telescope time. The problem with this method is that hosts of active galaxies may not be typical of galaxies at their redshift. Similarly, radio galaxies have in the past been used to find distant X-ray emitting clusters, but unbiased selection methods are now preferred. The most distant radio galaxy currently known is TGSS J1530+1049, at a redshift of 5.72.

=== Standard rulers ===

Some work has been done attempting to use radio galaxies as standard rulers to determine cosmological parameters. This method is fraught with difficulty because a radio galaxy&#x27;s size depends on both its age and its environment. When a model of the radio source is used, though, methods based on radio galaxies can give good agreement with other cosmological observations.

=== Effects on environment ===

Whether or not a radio source is expanding supersonically, it must do work against the external medium in expanding, and so it puts energy into heating and lifting the external plasma. The minimum energy stored in the lobes of a powerful radio source might be 1053 J. The lower limit on the work done on the external medium by such a source is several times this. A good deal of the current interest in radio sources focuses on the effect they must have at the centres of clusters at the present day. Equally interesting is their likely effect on structure formation over cosmological time: it is thought that they may provide a feedback mechanism to slow the formation of the most massive objects.

== Terminology ==

Widely used terminology is awkward now that it is generally accepted that quasars and radio galaxies are the same objects (see above). The acronym &quot;DRAGN&quot; (for &#x27;Double Radiosource Associated with Galactic Nucleus&#x27;) was coined by Patrick Leahy in 1993 and is in use. &quot;Extragalactic radio source&quot; is common but can lead to confusion, since many other extragalactic objects are detected in radio surveys, notably starburst galaxies. &quot;Radio-loud active galaxy&quot; is unambiguous, and so is often used in this article.

<doc id="211170" wikidata="Q454169" url="?curid=211170" title="Frank Aiken">
<text>Francis Thomas Aiken (13 February 1898 – 18 May 1983) was an Irish revolutionary and politician. He was chief of staff of the Anti-Treaty IRA at the end of the Irish Civil War. Aiken later served as Tánaiste from 1965 to 1969 and Minister for External Affairs from 1951 to 1954 and 1957 to 1969. He was also Minister for Finance from 1945 to 1948, Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures 1939 to 1945, and Minister for Defence from 1932 to 1939.

He was a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Louth constituency from 1923 to 1973, making him the second longest-serving member of Dáil Éireann and the longest-serving cabinet minister. Originally a member of Sinn Féin, he was later a founding member of Fianna Fáil.

==Early life==
===Early years===
Frank Aiken was born on 13 February 1898 at Carrickbracken, Camlough, County Armagh, Ireland, the seventh and youngest child of James Aiken, a builder from County Tyrone, and Mary McGeeney of Corromannon, Beleek, County Armagh. James Aiken built Catholic churches in South Armagh. Aiken was a nationalist, a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and a county councillor, who refused an offer to stand as a member of parliament. James was Chairman of the Local Board of the Poor Guardians. In 1900, on her visit to Ireland, he told Queen Victoria that he would not welcome her &quot;until Ireland has become free&quot;.

Frank Aiken was educated at the Camlough National School and in Newry by Irish Christian Brothers at Abbey Christian Brothers Grammar School, although he had only a &#x27;vague&#x27; recollection of school.

==Revolutionary period==
===Irish Volunteers and IRA===
He was elected a lieutenant in 1914 when he joined the Camlough Company of Irish Volunteers and the Gaelic League. But the northern nationalists split so they took no part in the Easter Rising. He became secretary of the local branch in 1917 and joined Sinn Féin. His sister Nano Aiken organised &quot;Cumann na mBan&quot; in Newry, setting up a local branch at Camlough. While working at the Co-Operative Flax-Scutching Society, Aiken committed to speaking Irish, which he learned at the Donegal &quot;Gaeltacht&quot; and Omeath Irish College. His sister, Nano, married Phelim Magennis a Newry stockbroker, and was the last female republican prisoner to be released in Northern Ireland at the end of the Civil War. Magennis, himself was active during these years.

He first met Éamon de Valera at the East Clare election in June 1917, riding despatches for Austin Stack. During a rowdy by-election at Bessbrook in February 1918, Aiken was elected a captain of Volunteers, stewarding electioneering. As secretary and chairman of the South Armagh district executive (comhairle ceanntair) it was his job to be chief fund-raiser for the Dublin Executive, responsible for the Dáil loan masterminded by Michael Collins.

In 1917, making an outward display of defiance, Aiken raised the republican Irish tricolour, opposite Camlough Barracks in Armagh, a move designed as deliberate provocation.

In March 1918 he was arrested by the RIC for illegal drilling — an act of open defiance that provoked a sentence of imprisonment for one month. On release that summer he joined the secretive Irish Republican Brotherhood fighting Hibernianism in the area. By 1919 Aiken&#x27;s clandestine activities mainly consisted of arms raids on dumps of the Ulster Volunteers who had imported weapons to resist Home Rule in 1913–14. As well as UVF dumps, Aiken and the Newry Brigade also raided prominent local unionist barracks at Dromilly, Ballyedmond Castle and Loughall Manor. Although they failed to capture many weapons the raids gave experience to newly recruited Volunteers. Aiken was also responsible for setting up GAA Club, Gaelic League branch, a Cumann na mBan Camogie League. Within a few years he was Chairman of Sinn Féin in Armagh, and was also elected to Armagh County Council. During the First Dáil Election he headed a team from South Armagh who went to Carlingford to assist the Sinn Fein candidacy of J.J. Kelly in Louth where they were attacked by members of the local Ancient Order of Hibernians.

===War of Independence===
Operating from the south Armagh/north Louth area, Aiken&#x27;s unit was one of the most effective IRA in Ulster during the Irish War of Independence. This success is attributed primarily to Aiken&#x27;s leadership and training methods.

In May 1920, he led 200 IRA men in an assault on the RIC barracks in Newtownhamilton, attacking the building and then burning it with paraffin spayed from a potato sprayer; however, the garrison did not surrender. Aiken himself led a squad which blasted a hole in the wall of the barracks with gelignite and entered through it, exchanging shots with the policemen inside.

At a sports event in Cullyhanna in June 1920, Aiken led a group of three men that demanded that three RIC men hand over their weapons. Shooting broke out and one man on each side was killed.

In July, he was almost killed at Banbridge. While riding a motorcycle to Lurgan he was chased by an angry mob.

In December 1920, he led another assault, this time abortive, on the RIC station in his home village of Camlough. In reprisal, the newly formed Ulster Special Constabulary burned Aiken&#x27;s home and those of ten of his relatives in the Camlough area. They also arrested and killed two local republicans. From this point onward, the conflict in the area took on an increasingly bitter and sectarian quality. Aiken tried on a number of occasions to ambush USC patrols from the ruins of his family home.

In April 1921, Aiken&#x27;s men mounted an operation in Creggan, County Armagh to ambush the police and Special Constabulary. One Special constable was killed in the ensuing firefight. Some accounts have reported that Aiken took the Protestant Church congregation in the village hostage to lure the Specials out onto the road. However, Mathew Lewis states that both Catholic and Protestant churchgoers were held in a pub to prevent their getting caught in the crossfire. Nevertheless, sectarian bitterness deepened in the area. The following month, the Special Constabulary started shooting Catholic civilians in revenge for IRA attacks.

In June 1921, Aiken organised his most successful attack yet on the British military, when his men derailed a British troop train heading from Belfast to Dublin, killing the train guard, three cavalry soldiers and 63 horses. Shortly afterwards, the Specials took four Catholics from their homes in Bessbrook and Altnaveigh, shooting them dead.

After an IRA reorganisation in April 1921, Aiken was put in command of the Fourth Northern Division of the IRA. The cycle of violence in south-east Ulster area continued the following year, despite a formal truce with the British from 11 July 1921 (see The Troubles in Ulster (1920–1922)). Michael Collins organised a clandestine guerrilla offensive (Northern Offensive) against the newly created Northern Ireland State. In May 1922, for reasons that have never been properly determined, Aiken and his Fourth Northern Division never took part in the operation, although it was planned that they would.

He was quickly promoted through the ranks, rising to commandant of Newry Brigade and eventually commander of 4th Northern Division from spring 1921. The IRA units he would eventually command extended from County Louth, southern and western County Down, and from March 1921 the whole of County Armagh. Aiken was named by (the IRA Chief of Staff) Eoin O&#x27;Duffy as head of the newly formed IRA Ulster Council Command which was tasked with coordination of attacks and preventing the new northern government from functioning effectively.

Nonetheless, the local IRA&#x27;s inaction at this time did not end the bloodshed in South Armagh. Aiken has been accused by unionists of ethnic cleansing of Protestants from parts of South Armagh, Newry and other areas of the north. In particular, Aiken&#x27;s critics cite the killing of six Protestant civilians, on an incident called the Altnaveigh Massacre, on 17 June 1922. The attack was in reprisal for the Special Constabulary&#x27;s killing of two nationalists near Camlough on 13 June and a sexual assault on Una McGuill, the wife of one of Aiken&#x27;s friends, James McGuill. As well as the six civilians, two Special Constables were killed in an ambush, and two weeks later a unionist politician, William Frazer, was abducted, killed and his body secretly buried. It was not found until 1924. Aiken himself led an ambush against some of those who partook in the assault on McGuill&#x27;s public house on the night of the Altnaveigh ambush. However, it appears that the Specials were alerted to their arrival and this attack did not end in success as the patrol escaped unharmed. At the same time the attack on Altnaveigh and Lisdrumniska was carried out. Robert Lynch, in published research, has documented the deaths of several single Catholic youths whose bodies were dumped on roads approaching these areas on the weeks prior to this assault killings that were attributed to B-Specials who operated from the area.

===Civil War===
After the IRA split over the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922, Aiken ultimately became aligned with the anti-Treaty side in spite of personal efforts to prevent division and civil war and by remaining neutral at first. After fighting broke out between pro- and anti-Treaty units in Dublin on 28 June 1922, he wrote to Richard Mulcahy on 6 July 1922 calling for a truce, the election of a new reunited IRA army council and the removal of the Oath of Allegiance from the Free State constitution. Mulcahy was evasive, however, and said he &#x27;could not see a way to advise the government&#x27; to agree with Aiken&#x27;s proposals. Subsequently, Aiken travelled to Limerick meet with anti-Treaty IRA leader Liam Lynch, and urged him to consider a truce in return for the removal of references to the British monarch from the constitution. At this time Limerick was occupied by three Armies, Pro-Treaty, Anti-Treaty and British Troops. Aiken was attempting throughout to avoid Civil War from breaking out and urging that all military remain together to push north to re-take the Six-Counties of Northern Ireland , territory which made up his homeland and counties of his own Army Division. Aiken later felt that without the sterling work done in support of the Treaty by Eoin O&#x27;Duffy, aided by Mulcahy and Eoin MacNeill, civil war would have been avoided. 

Despite his neutrality and pleas for a negotiated end to the Civil War, Aiken was arrested by pro-Treaty troops on 16 July 1922, under Dan Hogan, on the orders of Mulcahy and Collins, and imprisoned at Dundalk Gaol along with about 200 to 300 of his men. After just ten days imprisonment, he was freed in a mass escape of 100 men from Dundalk prison on 28 July. Then, on 14 August, he led a surprise attack of between 300 and 400 anti-treaty IRA men on Dundalk. They blew holes in the army barracks there and rapidly took control of the town at a cost of just two of his men killed. The operation freed 240 republican prisoners seizing 400 rifles. While in possession of the town, Aiken publicly called for an end to the Civil War. However, knowing he could not hope to retain Dundalk militarily he retreated north of the town. In Man of No Property Todd Andrews who accompanied him on the assault stated that: &quot;Had it been carried out against a British garrison under arms it would have been the most successful amphibious assault carried out ever by an IRA Commander.&quot; While celebrated in the Anti-Treaty IRA publications it was clear Aiken was not interested in an offensive campaign just taking back what had been his before. For the remainder of the conflict he remained at large with his unit, carrying out no major attacks on Free State forces. Aiken was to remain unenthusiastic about the internecine struggle.

His son Frank Jr. recalls &quot;I did ask him about the Civil War a little bit, but he wouldn&#x27;t answer. He&#x27;d give me an answer like terrible things happen in wars and worse in civil wars.&quot;

===Chief of Staff===
Aiken was with IRA leader Liam Lynch&#x27;s patrol when they were ambushed at Knockmealdown on 10 April 1923. Lynch was shot and killed. Aiken rescued crucial IRA papers, &quot;saved and brought through at any cost&quot;. He succeeded Lynch as IRA Chief of Staff on 20 April. Always ambivalent about the war against the Free State, Aiken soon issued a letter ordering a suspension of offensive operations from 30 April.Department of the Chief of Staff, General Headquarters, Dublin, April 27th, 1923.

Special Army Orders. To OCs, Commanders and Independent Brigades.

Suspension of Offensive

1. I order to give effect to the decision of the government and Army Council embodied in attached Proclamation of this date. You will arrange the suspension of all offensive operations in your area as from now, Monday April 30th.

2. You will ensure that while remaining on the offensive all units take adequate measures to protect themselves and their munitions.

Chief of Staff.

Aiken had remained close to Éamon de Valera, who had long wanted to end the Civil War, and together the two came up with a compromise that would save the anti-Treaty side from a formal surrender. Instead of giving up their weapons, their fighters would receive a further order to &#x27;dump arms&#x27; and simply return home as honourable republicans. Aiken wrote: &quot;We took up arms to free our country and we&#x27;ll keep them until we see an honourable way of reaching our objective without arms&quot;.

The ceasefire and dump-arms order, issued on 24 May 1923, effectively ended the Irish Civil War, though the Free State government did not issue a general amnesty until the following year. Aiken remained IRA Chief of Staff until 12 November 1925. That summer the IRA sent a delegation led by Pa Murray to the Soviet Union for a personal meeting with Joseph Stalin, in the hope of gaining Soviet finance and weaponry assistance. A secret pact was agreed whereby the IRA would spy on the United States and the United Kingdom, and pass information to Red Army military intelligence in New York City and London in return for £500 a month. The pact was originally approved by Aiken, who left his position as chief of staff soon after. He was succeeded by Andrew Cooney and Moss Twomey, who kept up the secret espionage relationship.

==Founder of Fianna Fáil==
Aiken was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Sinn Féin candidate for Louth in 1923. Aiken was at the April 1925 Commemoration ceremony at Dundalk, but by March 1926—when de Valera founded a new party, Fianna Fáil—he was in America. In June 1927 he was re-elected for Louth for Fianna Fáil, continuing to be re-elected for that party at every election until his retirement from politics in 1973. In May 1926 he bought Dun Gaoithe, a dairy farm, at Sandyford, County Dublin. Aiken was an innovator, an amateur inventor who took out patents throughout his life for a turf stove, a beehive, an air shelter, an electric cooker and a spring heel for a shoe among others and also powered the family home in Sandyford through use of a wind turbine.

He entered the first Fianna Fáil government in 1932 as Minister for Defence.

===Clash with the Governor General===

On de Valera&#x27;s urging, Vice-President of the Executive Council Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly and Aiken publicly snubbed the Governor-General of the Irish Free State, James McNeill, by staging a public walkout at a function in the French legation in Dublin. When McNeill took offence at de Valera&#x27;s response and, against government advice, published his correspondence, de Valera advised King George V to dismiss the Governor General. The King arranged a special deal between both men, whereby McNeill would retire from his post a few weeks earlier than planned, with the resignation coinciding with the dates de Valera had suggested for the dismissal. While agreeing that the situation was &quot;regrettable&quot; de Valera, instead of chastising the ministers, suggested that the Governor-General inform the Executive Council of his social engagements to enable ministers to avoid ones he was attending. MacNeill was a brother of Eoin MacNeill and this was a campaign to encourage him to resign as Governor-General which he did. Having done so, de Valera appointed appointed Domhnall Ua Buachalla, a Fianna Fáil founding member, to the office.

===Minister for Defence===
Aiken had in March 1932 been trying to reach a new &quot;rapprochement&quot;, and &quot;reconciled the Army to the new regime&quot;. On 9 March he visited republican prisoners, including George Gilmour, in Arbour Hill prison; they were released the next day. This was the same day he had been appointed as Minister for Defence.

Aiken was given a vice-presidency, &#x27;Agriculture&#x27;, by James Ryan at the Ottawa Conference. He advised on the usage of cutting peat bogs in County Meath and visited the Curragh Camp in County Kildare to accelerate land distribution to poor tenantry. Land was released in the &#x27;Midlands&#x27; for development. C.S. Andrews credits Aiken for the Turf Development Board in his second autobiography, &quot;Man of No Property&quot;. The Turf Development Board would later become Bord na Móna. According to Andrews, Lemass said to him &quot;I want you to head this organisation to get Aiken off my back&quot;. Aiken remained interested in the development of Ireland&#x27;s natural resources throughout his political life.

Aiken was not involved in the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement negotiations which took place on 25 April 1938. According to some sources this was because of his associations with the IRA, while other sources suggest that he was tactically left at home by de Valera – as Aiken was perceived in the UK as a vexed Anglophobe who the Irish would have to convince of their support for the agreement in Dublin.

===The Emergency===
At the outbreak of Second World War, a period known in Ireland as The Emergency, Aiken was appointed as Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures by de Valera with Oscar Traynor assuming the role of Minister for Defence, in de Valera&#x27;s first major cabinet reshuffle as the country was put on a wartime footing to defend Irish neutrality.

He gained notoriety in Dublin media circles for overseeing censorship: his clashes with R. M. Smyllie, editor of &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, ensured this censorious attitude was resented by many. Aiken not only corrected war coverage by &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, whose editorial line was largely pro-British, but also banned pro-allied war films and even forbade the reporting of parliamentarians&#x27; speeches that went against the government line of strict neutrality. Aiken justified these measures, citing the &#x27;terrible and all prevailing force of modern warfare&#x27; and the importance therein of morale and propaganda. However, it was the former government minister, Joseph Connolly, and fellow Ulster founder member of Fianna Fáil, who was appointed to the office of censor.

Aiken remained opposed to a British role and partition in Ireland, and was therefore a strong supporter of de Valera&#x27;s policy of Irish neutrality that denied Britain use of Irish ports during the Battle of the Atlantic. Aiken considered that Ireland had to stand ready to resist invasion by both Germany and Britain, and the Irish Army was expanded under Aiken&#x27;s ministry. It increased to a strength of 41,000 regulars and 180,000 in auxiliary units – the Local Defence Force and Local Security Force – by 1941, although these formations were relatively poorly equipped.

Aiken wanted to incorporate the IRA into the Army and offered the former an amnesty in the spring of 1940, which the underground organisation turned down. Nevertheless, during wartime as the IRA cooperated with German intelligence and pressed for a German landing in Northern Ireland, the government, with Aiken&#x27;s approval, interned several hundred of its members and executed six for the shooting of Irish police officers. Even so, Aiken remained somewhat sympathetic to them in private and visited their prisoners in Arbour Hill prison in Dublin. However, he did not appeal for clemency for those condemned to death.

Thinking that Britain would lose the war in 1940, he refused to back senior British civil servant Malcolm MacDonald&#x27;s plan for the unification of Ireland in return for the Irish state joining the British effort. In diplomatic negotiations Aiken told him that a united Ireland, if it was conceded, would still stay neutral to safeguard its security and that further talks were &#x27;a sheer waste of time&#x27;. Furthermore, the Irish people &#x27;would not support their government taking them into the war without some actual provocation from Germany&#x27;. When asked on American radio about the offer of unity in return for entering the war, he replied, &#x27;most certainly not. We want union and sovereignty, not union and slavery&#x27;.

In March 1941, Aiken was sent to America to secure US supplies, both military and economic, that DeValera claimed Britain was withholding owing to Irish neutrality. Aiken had a bad-tempered meeting with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Washington DC. Roosevelt urged Aiken and Ireland to join the war on the allied side asking if it was true that he had said that &#x27;Ireland had nothing to fear from a German victory&#x27;. Aiken denied saying this but cited the British &#x27;supply squeeze&#x27; as an act of aggression and asked the US to help. Roosevelt agreed to send supplies, but only if Britain consented. At the close Aiken asked the President to &#x27;support us in our stand against aggression&#x27;. &#x27;German aggression, yes&#x27; Roosevelt replied, to which Aiken retorted &#x27;British aggression too&#x27;. This infuriated Roosevelt, who shouted &#x27;nonsense&#x27; and &#x27;pulled the tablecloth [from under his lunch] sending cutlery flying around the room&#x27;. Ultimately, Aiken was not able to secure a promise of American arms, but was able to get a shipment of grain, two merchant ships and coal. Roosevelt also gave &#x27;his personal guarantee&#x27; that Britain would not invade Ireland.

===Minister for External Affairs===

Aiken was Minister for Finance for three years following the war and was involved in economic post–war development in the industrial, agricultural, educational and other spheres. However, it was during his two periods as Minister for External Affairs—1951 to 1954, and 1957 to 1969—that Aiken fulfilled his enormous political potential. As Foreign Minister he adopted where possible an independent stance for Ireland at the United Nations and other international forums such as the Council of Europe. Despite a great deal of opposition, both at home and abroad, he stubbornly asserted the right of smaller UN member countries to discuss the representation of communist China at the General Assembly. Unable to bring the issue of the partition of Ireland to the UN, because of Britain&#x27;s veto on the Security Council and unwillingness of other Western nations to interfere in what they saw as British affairs at that time (the US taking a more ambiguous position), Aiken ensured that Ireland vigorously defended the rights of small nations such as Tibet and Hungary, nations whose problems he felt Ireland could identify with and had a moral obligation to help.

Aiken also supported the right of countries such as Algeria to self-determination and spoke out against apartheid in South Africa. Under Ireland&#x27;s policy of promoting the primacy of international law and reducing global tension at the height of the Cold War, Aiken promoted the idea of &quot;areas of law&quot;, which he believed would free the most tense regions around the world from the threat of nuclear war.

The &#x27;Aiken Plan&#x27; was introduced at the United Nations in an effort to combine disarmament and peace in the Middle East, Ireland a country being on good terms with both Israel and many Arab countries. In the UN the Irish delegation sat between Iraq and Israel forming a kind of physical &#x27;buffer&#x27;: in Aiken&#x27;s time (who as a minister spent a lot of time with the UN delegation) both the Italians (who on their turn sat in the vicinity of the Iraqi delegation), the Irish and the Israelis claimed to be the one and only UN delegation of New York, a city inhabited by many Irish, Jewish and Italians. Aiken was also a champion of nuclear non-proliferation, for which he received the honour of being the first minister to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1968 at Moscow. Aiken&#x27;s impact as Minister for External Affairs was such that he is sometimes referred to as the father of Irish foreign policy. His performance was praised in particular by a later Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fine Gael&#x27;s Garret FitzGerald.

==Later years==
Aiken retired from Ministerial office and as Tánaiste in 1969. During the Arms Crisis it is said that the Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, turned to Aiken for advice on a number of issues. Aiken retired from politics in 1973 due to the fact that Charles Haughey, whose style of politics Aiken strongly disliked, was allowed to run as a Fianna Fáil candidate in the 1973 general election. Initially he planned to announce the reason for his decision, but under pressure finally agreed to announce that he was retiring on medical advice.

===Refusal of candidacy for the presidency of Ireland===
After his retirement, the outgoing President of Ireland Éamon de Valera, sought to convince Aiken—one of his closest friends—to run for Fianna Fáil in the 1973 presidential election. However, Aiken refused all requests to run and the party finally selected Erskine H. Childers to be its candidate. Childers won the election.

==Family==

In 1934 Aiken married Maud Davin, the director of the Dublin Municipal School of Music. The couple had three children. The couple first met in County Wicklow in the house of Aiken&#x27;s friend, James Ryan, who helped encourage the relationship.

==Death==

Frank Aiken died on 18 May 1983 in Dublin from natural causes at the age of 85. He was buried in his native Camlough, County Armagh, Northern Ireland.

===Honours and memorials===
Aiken received many decorations and honours, including honorary doctorates from the National University of Ireland and University College Dublin. He received the Grand Cross of St. Olav, the highest honour Norway can give to a foreigner, during a state visit to Norway in 1964. He was also a lifelong supporter of the Irish language. His son, also named Frank, ran unsuccessfully in the 1987 and 1989 general elections for the Progressive Democrats.

His wife died in a road accident in 1978. Having been denied the right, through an exclusion order, to attend his family home the former IRA Commander&#x27;s dying wish was respected by local Fianna Fáil organisation, the Dundalk &amp; District Old IRA and by the 27 Infantry Battalion of the barracks that now bears his name who followed his funeral cortege through Dundalk to the border out of respect to their fallen comrade. His former ministerial colleague, Seán MacEntee, gave the graveside oration.

Aiken Barracks in Dundalk, County Louth, now the headquarters of the 27 Infantry Battalion is named in his honour.

<doc id="211177" wikidata="Q3480938" url="?curid=211177" title="Lodestone">
<text>Lodestones are naturally magnetized pieces of the mineral magnetite. They are naturally occurring magnets, which can attract iron. The property of magnetism was first discovered in antiquity through lodestones. Pieces of lodestone, suspended so they could turn, were the first magnetic compasses, and their importance to early navigation is indicated by the name &quot;lodestone&quot;, which in Middle English means &quot;course stone&quot; or &quot;leading stone&quot;, 
from the now-obsolete meaning of &quot;lode&quot; as &quot;journey, way&quot;.

Lodestone is one of only a very few minerals that is found naturally magnetized. Magnetite is black or brownish-black, with a metallic luster, a Mohs hardness of 5.5–6.5 and a black streak.

==Origin==
The process by which lodestone is created has long been an open question in geology. Only a small amount of the magnetite on the Earth is found magnetized as lodestone. Ordinary magnetite is attracted to a magnetic field as iron and steel are, but does not tend to become magnetized itself; it has too low a magnetic coercivity. (resistance to magnetization or demagnetization) Microscopic examination of lodestones has found them to be made of magnetite (Fe3O4) with inclusions of maghemite (cubic Fe2O3), often with impurity metal ions of titanium, aluminium, and manganese. This inhomogeneous crystalline structure gives this variety of magnetite sufficient coercivity to remain magnetized and thus be a permanent magnet.

The other question is how lodestones get magnetized. The Earth&#x27;s magnetic field at 0.5 gauss is too weak to magnetize a lodestone by itself. The leading theory is that lodestones are magnetized by the strong magnetic fields surrounding lightning bolts. This is supported by the observation that they are mostly found near the surface of the Earth, rather than buried at great depth.

==History==
One of the earliest known references to lodestone&#x27;s magnetic properties was made by 6th century BC Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus, whom the ancient Greeks credited with discovering lodestone&#x27;s attraction to iron and other lodestones. The name &quot;magnet&quot; may come from lodestones found in Magnesia, Anatolia. The ancient Indian medical text &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot; describes using magnetic properties of the lodestone to remove arrows embedded in a person&#x27;s body.
The earliest Chinese literary reference to magnetism occurs in the 4th-century BC &quot;Book of the Devil Valley Master&quot; (&quot;Guiguzi&quot;).
In the chronicle &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;, from the 2nd century BC, it is explicitly stated that &quot;the lodestone makes iron come or it attracts it.&quot; The earliest mention of a needle&#x27;s attraction appears in a work composed between 20 and 100 AD, the &quot;Lunheng&quot; (&quot;Balanced Inquiries&quot;): &quot;A lodestone attracts a needle.&quot; In the 2nd century BC, Chinese geomancers were experimenting with the magnetic properties of lodestone to make a &quot;south-pointing spoon&quot; for divination. When it is placed on a smooth bronze plate, the spoon would invariably rotate to a north–south axis. While this has been shown to work, archaeologists have yet to discover an actual spoon made of magnetite in a Han tomb.

Based on his discovery of an Olmec artifact (a shaped and grooved magnetic bar) in North America, astronomer John Carlson suggests that lodestone may have been used by the Olmec more than a thousand years prior to the Chinese discovery. Carlson speculates that the Olmecs, for astrological or geomantic purposes, used similar artifacts as a directional device, or to orient their temples, the dwellings of the living, or the interments of the dead. Detailed analysis of the Olmec artifact revealed that the &quot;bar&quot; was composed of hematite with titanium lamellae of Fe2–xTixO3 that accounted for the anomalous remanent magnetism of the artifact.

&quot;A century of research has pushed back the first mention of the magnetic compass in Europe to Alexander Neckam about +1190, followed soon afterwards by Guyot de Provins in +1205 and Jacques de Vitry in +1269. All other European claims have been excluded by detailed study...&quot;

Lodestones have frequently been displayed as valuable or prestigious objects. The Ashmolean Museum in Oxford contains a lodestone adorned with a gilt coronet that was donated by Mary Cavendish in 1756, possibly to secure her husband&#x27;s appointment as Chancellor of Oxford University. Isaac Newton&#x27;s signet ring reportedly contained a lodestone which was capable of lifting more than 200 times its own weight. And in 17th century London, the Royal Society displayed a spherical lodestone (a &quot;terrella&quot; or &#x27;little Earth&#x27;), which was used to illustrate the Earth&#x27;s magnetic fields and the function of mariners&#x27; compasses. One contemporary writer, the satirist Ned Ward, noted how the &quot;terrella&quot; &quot;made a paper of Steel Filings prick up themselves one upon the back of another, that they stood pointing like the Bristles of a &quot;Hedge-Hog&quot;; and gave such Life and Merriment to a Parcel of Needles, that they danc&#x27;d [...] as if the devil were in them.&quot;

<text>In archaeology, a tell (from , &quot;&quot;, &#x27;mound&#x27; or &#x27;small hill&#x27;) is an artificial topographical feature, a mound consisting of the accumulated and stratified debris of a succession of consecutive settlements at the same site, the refuse of generations of people who built and inhabited them and natural sediment.

Tells are most commonly associated with the ancient Near East but are also found elsewhere, such as in Southern and parts of Central Europe, from Greece and Bulgaria to Hungary and Spain, and in North Africa. Within the Near East they are concentrated in less arid regions, including Upper Mesopotamia, the Southern Levant, Anatolia and Iran, which had more continuous settlement. Eurasian tells date to the Neolithic, the Chalcolithic and the Bronze and Iron Ages. In the Southern Levant the time of the tells ended with the conquest by Alexander the Great, which ushered in the Hellenistic period with its own, different settlement-building patterns. Many tells across the Near East continue to be occupied and used today.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;tell&quot; is first attested in English in an 1840 report in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Geographical Society&quot;. It is derived from the Arabic () meaning &quot;mound&quot; or &quot;hillock&quot;. Variant spellings include &quot;tall&quot;, &quot;tel&quot;, &quot;til&quot; and &quot;tal&quot;.

The Arabic word has many cognates in other Semitic languages, such as Akkadian , Ugaritic and Hebrew (). The Akkadian form is similar to Sumerian , which can also refer to a pile of any material, such as grain, but it is not known whether the similarity reflects a borrowing from that language or if the Sumerian term itself was a loanword from an earlier Semitic substrate language. If Akkadian is related to another word in that language, , meaning &quot;woman&#x27;s breast&quot;, there exists a similar term in the South Semitic classical Ethiopian language of Geʽez, namely , &quot;breast&quot;. Hebrew first appears in the biblical book of Deuteronomy (c. 700–500 BCE), describing a heap or small mound and appearing in the books of Joshua and Jeremiah with the same meaning.

===Equivalents===
There are lexically unrelated equivalents for this geophysical concept of a town-mound in other Southwest Asian languages, including in Egyptian Arabic, or (Turkish/), or (Turkish) and &quot;chogha&quot; (, from Turkish and derivatives etc.).

===In toponyms===
Equivalent words for town-mound often appear in place names, and the word &quot;tell&quot; itself is one of the most common prefixes for Palestinian toponyms. The Arabic word &quot;khirbet&quot;, also spelled &quot;khirbat&quot; (), meaning &quot;ruin&quot;, also occurs in the names of many archaeological tells, such as Khirbet et-Tell (roughly meaning &quot;heap of ruins&quot;).

==Formation==

A tell can form only if natural and man-made material accumulates faster than it is removed by erosion and human-caused truncation, which explains the limited geographical area they occur in.

Tells are formed from a variety of remains, including organic and cultural refuse, collapsed mudbricks and other building materials, water-laid sediments, residues of biogenic and geochemical processes and aeolian sediment. A classic tell looks like a low, truncated cone with sloping sides and a flat, mesa-like top. They can be more than high.

== Occurrence ==
===Southwest Asia===
It is thought that the earliest examples of tells are in the Jordan Valley, such as at the 10-meter-high mound, dating back to the proto-Neolithic period, at Jericho in the West Bank. More than 5,000 tells have been detected in the area of ancient Israel and Jordan. Of these, Paul Lapp calculated in the 1960s that 98% had yet to be touched by archaeologists.

In Syria, tells are abundant in the Upper Mesopotamia region, scattered along the Euphrates, including Tell al-&#x27;Abr, Tell Bazi, Tell Kabir, Tell Mresh, Tell Saghir and Tell Banat. The last is thought to be the site of the oldest war memorial (known as the White Monument), dating from the 3rd millennium BCE.

===Europe===
Tells can be found in Europe in countries such as Spain, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, and Greece.

Northeastern Bulgaria has a rich archaeological heritage of eneolithic (4900–3800 BCE) tells from the 5th millennium BCE.

In Neolithic Greece there is a contrast between the northern Thessalian plain, where rainfall was sufficient to permit densely populated settlements based on dry-farming, and the more dispersed sites in southern Greece, such as the Peloponesus, where early villages sprang up around the smaller arable tracts close to springs, lakes, and marshes. Two models account for the tell structures of this part of southern Europe, one developed by Paul Halstead and the other by John Chapman. Chapman envisaged the tell as witness to a nucleated communal society, whereas Halstead emphasized the idea that they arose as individual household structures. Thessalian tells often reflect small hamlets with a population of around 40–80.

The Toumbas of Macedonia and the Magoulas of Thessaly are the local names for tell sites in these regions of Greece.

<doc id="211184" wikidata="Q334775" url="?curid=211184" title="Muhammad Zaidan">
<text>Muhammad Zaidan aka Muhammad Abbas (10 December 1948 – 8 March 2004), sometimes known as Abu Abbas ( &quot;Abū ʿAbbās;&quot; ), was (with Tal&#x27;at Ya&#x27;qoub) a founder of the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF) Organization.

==Political background==
Zaidan was born in 1948 in Safed, Palestine, though other sources state that he was born in a Syrian refugee camp.

He studied at the Damascus University where he joined the radical, pro-Syrian Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC) under Ahmed Jibril in 1968. In 1977, major disagreements arose between the PFLP-GC, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and other Palestinian factions based in Lebanon. Zaidan, who opposed Syrian involvement in the Lebanese war, left the PFLP-GC and created the PLF with Talaat Yaacoub, which eventually split into three separate factions (and then later re-merged). Zaidan&#x27;s faction of the PLF, which was the largest of the three, moved its headquarters to Tunisia.

==PLF leader==
Since its inception in 1977, the Abbas-led PLF was a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization and received support from both the PLO and Yasser Arafat&#x27;s Fatah movement. Unlike the PFLP-GC, the PLF has supported peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Zaidan was elected to the Executive Committee of the PLO in 1984 and represented the Palestinian National Council (PNC) in 1989 during peace negotiations with Israel. Although Zaidan was wanted by Israel for his involvement in guerrilla attacks against Israel (including attacks against civilians) throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, Israel allowed him to travel freely in the Gaza Strip throughout the 1990s because he supported the peace negotiations. One notable attack by the PLF under Zaidan&#x27;s leadership resulted in the deaths of Danny Haran (age 28) and his two daughters, Einat (4) and Yael (2) in April 1979 in their Nahariya, Israel home by Samir Kuntar.

==&quot;Achille Lauro&quot; hijacking==
Throughout the 1980s, the PLF launched attacks on both civilian and military targets in the north of Israel, across the Lebanese border. In 1985 he masterminded the hijacking of the Italian cruise ship &quot;Achille Lauro&quot;. During the hijacking, 69-year-old American Jewish passenger Leon Klinghoffer, who used a wheelchair, was shot dead and thrown overboard. The four hijackers, fearful of United States military intervention, surrendered to Egypt in return for safe passage out of Egypt, based on the pretext that they had done no harm to any of the passengers. Four F-14 aircraft from the U.S. 6th Fleet intercepted the plane carrying the hijackers to Tunisia and escorted it to Sigonella, a NATO base in Italy. There they discovered that Zaidan and PLO political officer Hassan were also on the plane. Insider deals within the Italian government made them both flown from Sigonella to Rome. From there, Zaidan and Hassan boarded a Yugoslav civilian airliner bound for Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Despite American requests for the extradition of Zaidan from Yugoslavia, he was not extradited because of Yugoslav relations with the PLO. He then flew to Aden, South Yemen and from there to Baghdad, where Saddam Hussein sheltered him from extradition to Italy. He remained in Iraq and commanded the PLF (reunited in 1989) until the American invasion of Iraq in 2003.

Italy sentenced Zaidan &quot;in absentia&quot; to five terms of life imprisonment for his role in the &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; hijacking. He was also wanted in the US for crimes including terrorism, piracy and murder. In 1996, he apologized for the &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; hijacking and the murder of Leon Klinghoffer and advocated peace talks between Palestinians and Israel; the apology was rejected by the US government and Klinghoffer&#x27;s family.

==Death in custody==
Subsequent to the US invasion of Iraq on 20 March 2003, Zaidan was captured by American Special Forces on 14 April 2003 while he was attempting to flee from Baghdad to Syria. Italy subsequently requested his extradition. The Pentagon reported on 9 March 2004 that Zaidan had died the previous day, of natural causes, while in U.S. custody. The PLF accused the Americans of assassinating their leader. The U.S. authorities agreed to give Abbas&#x27; body to the Palestine Red Crescent Society for burial in Ramallah on the West Bank. However, his burial there was blocked by the Israeli authorities, and he was buried in the Martyrs&#x27; Cemetery in Damascus instead.

The first Jebtsundamba, Zanabazar (1635–1723), was identified as the reincarnation of the scholar Taranatha of the Jonang school of Tibetan Buddhism. Zanabazar was the son of the Tüsheet Khan Gombodorj, ruler of central Khalkha Mongolia, and himself became the spiritual head of the Khalkha Mongols.

On May 29, the Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu paid homage to the Kangxi Emperor in 1691 at Dolonnor.

Like Zanabazar, the 2nd Jebtsundamba Khutughtu was a member of Mongolia&#x27;s highest nobility and direct descendant of Genghis Khan. After Chingünjav&#x27;s rebellion and the demise of the second Jebtsundamba Khutugtu, the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty decreed in 1758 that all future reincarnations were to be found from among the population of Tibet.

When the region of Outer Mongolia declared independence from the Qing dynasty in 1911, the eighth Jebtsundamba (1869–1924) was elevated to theocratic ruler, called Bogd Khan and established the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia. He was the head of state until his death in 1924. The communist government of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic, which replaced the theocracy in 1924, declared that there were to be no further reincarnations.

A reincarnation was in fact found almost at once in north Mongolia, and some high lamas of the dead Khutughtu&#x27;s suite went to interview the child&#x27;s mother, Tsendjav, and to instruct her in the details of the life of the former incarnation, so that she could familiarize the child-candidate with the tests which he would have to undergo. Faced with the possibility of a new Khutughtu who was born within Mongolia and was not even a foreigner from Tibet, the Central Committee of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party decided in July 1925 to turn the matter over to the elderly 13th Dalai Lama in Lhasa. The Dalai Lama&#x27;s decision would nonetheless be subject to new Mongolian legislation for the separation of church and state. In February 1929, the installation of any further Khutughtus was forbidden.

A 9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu was installed by the 14th Dalai Lama as the head of a reinvigorated Jonang lineage. He was born Jampal Namdol Chökyi Gyaltsen in 1932 and he died in early 2012. Despite the Chinese government&#x27;s claim to have inherited the authority and ultimate decision right for the choice of successor of all high lamas in Mongolia and Tibet, the 9th Jebstundamba will be reincarnated within the independent Mongolia and the selection will be confirmed by the Dalai Lama. This puts China in a dilemma of endangering their foreign affairs with Mongolia for the choice of the next Lama or to forfeit this right that they claim to have control of religious affairs, ultimately giving up their authority over the choice of the next Dalai Lama and putting their current choice of the Panchen Lama in question.

<doc id="211191" wikidata="Q2751330" url="?curid=211191" title="Venous thrombosis">
<text>Venous thrombosis is the blockage of a vein caused by a thrombus (blood clot). A common form of venous thrombosis is deep vein thrombosis (DVT), when a blood clot forms in the deep veins. If a thrombus breaks off (embolizes) and flows to the lungs to lodge there, it becomes a pulmonary embolism (PE), a blood clot in the lungs. The conditions of DVT only, DVT with PE, and PE only, are all captured by the term venous thromboembolism (VTE).

The initial treatment for VTE is typically either low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin, or increasingly with direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC). Those initially treated with heparins can be switched to other anticoagulants (warfarin, DOACs), although pregnant women and some people with cancer receive ongoing heparin treatment. Superficial venous thrombosis or phlebitis affects the superficial veins of the upper or lower extremity and only require anticoagulation in specific situations, and may be treated with anti-inflammatory pain relief only.

There are other less common forms of venous thrombosis, some of which can also lead to pulmonary embolism. Venous thromboembolism and superficial vein thrombosis account for about 90% of venous thrombosis. Other rarer forms include retinal vein thrombosis, mesenteric vein thrombosis (affecting veins draining blood from the gastrointestinal organs), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis, and ovarian vein thrombosis.
==Classification==
===Common forms===
Superficial venous thromboses cause discomfort but generally not serious consequences, as do the deep vein thromboses (DVTs) that form in the deep veins of the legs or in the pelvic veins. Nevertheless, they can progress to the deep veins through the perforator veins or, they can be responsible for a lung embolism mainly if the head of the clot is poorly attached to the vein wall and is situated near the sapheno-femoral junction.

When a blood clot breaks loose and travels in the blood, this is called a thromboembolism. The abbreviation DVT/PE refers to a VTE where a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has moved to the lungs (PE or pulmonary embolism).

Since the veins return blood to the heart, if a piece of a blood clot formed in a vein breaks off it can be transported to the right side of the heart, and from there into the lungs. A piece of thrombus that is transported in this way is an &quot;embolus&quot;: the process of forming a thrombus that becomes embolic is called a &quot;thromboembolism&quot;. An embolism that lodges in the lungs is a &quot;pulmonary embolism&quot; (PE). A pulmonary embolism is a very serious condition that can be fatal depending on the dimensions of the embolus.

===Rare forms===
While venous thrombosis of the legs is the most common form, venous thrombosis may occur in other veins. These may have particular specific risk factors:
* Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, cavernous sinus thrombosis and jugular vein thrombosis: thrombosis of the veins of the brain and head
* Central retinal vein occlusion and branch retinal vein occlusion: despite the name these conditions have much more in common with arterial thrombosis and are not treated with anticoagulants
* Paget–Schroetter disease: thrombosis of the veins of the arms (axillary and subclavian veins)
* Budd-Chiari syndrome (thrombosis of the hepatic vein)
* Thrombosis of the hepatic portal system, also known as splanchnic venous thrombosis:
** Thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein, which may cause mesenteric ischemia (insufficient blood flow to the intestine)
** Portal vein thrombosis
** Thrombosis of the splenic vein
* Renal vein thrombosis (thrombosis of the veins of the kidneys)
* Ovarian vein thrombosis

===Parodoxical embolism===
Systemic embolism of venous origin can occur in patients with an atrial or ventricular septal defect, or an arteriovenous connection in the lung, through which an embolus may pass into the arterial system. Such an event is termed a paradoxical embolism. When this affects the blood vessels of the brain it can cause stroke.

==Causes==
Venous thrombi are caused mainly by a combination of venous stasis and hypercoagulability—but to a lesser extent endothelial damage and activation. The three factors of stasis, hypercoagulability, and alterations in the blood vessel wall represent Virchow&#x27;s triad, and changes to the vessel wall are the least understood. Various risk factors increase the likelihood of any one individual developing a thrombosis:

===Risk factors===

====Acquired====

* Older age
* Major surgery, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery
* Cancers, most particularly pancreatic, but not cancers of the lip, oral cavity, and pharynx
* Immobilization, as in orthopedic casts, the sitting position, and travel, particularly by air
* Pregnancy and the postpartum period
* Antiphospholipid syndrome (such as lupus anticoagulant)
* Trauma and minor leg injury
* Previous VTE
* Oral contraceptives
* Hormonal replacement therapy, esp. oral
* Central venous catheters
* Inflammatory diseases/some autoimmune diseases
* Nephrotic syndrome
* Obesity
* Infection
* HIV
* Myeloproliferative neoplasms including essential thrombocytosis and polycythemia vera
* Chemotherapy
* Heart failure
====Inherited====

* Antithrombin deficiency
* Protein C deficiency
* Protein S deficiency (type I)
* Factor V Leiden
* Prothrombin G20210A
* Dysfibrinogenemia
* Non O-blood type
====Mixed====

* Low free protein S
* Activated protein C resistance
* High factor VIII levels
* Hyperhomocysteinemia
* High fibrinogen levels
* High factor IX levels
* High factor XI levels
The overall absolute risk of venous thrombosis per 100,000 woman years in current use of combined oral contraceptives is approximately 60, compared to 30 in non-users. The risk of thromboembolism varies with different types of birth control pills; Compared with combined oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel (LNG), and with the same dose of estrogen and duration of use, the rate ratio of deep vein thrombosis for combined oral contraceptives with norethisterone is 0.98, with norgestimate 1.19, with desogestrel (DSG) 1.82, with gestodene 1.86, with drospirenone (DRSP) 1.64, and with cyproterone acetate 1.88. Venous thromboembolism occurs in 100–200 per 100,000 pregnant women every year.

Regarding family history, age has substantial effect modification. For people with two or more affected siblings, the highest incidence rate is found among those ≥70 years of age (390 per 100,000 in men and 370 per 100,000 in women), whereas the highest incidence ratios compared to those without affected siblings occurred at much younger ages (ratio of 4.3 among men 20 to 29 years of age and 5.5 among women 10 to 19 years of age).

==Pathophysiology==

In contrast to the understanding for how arterial thromboses occur, as with heart attacks, venous thrombosis formation is not well understood. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required for thrombosis formation, as it initiates coagulation, but the majority of venous thrombi form without any injured epithelium.

Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of venous thrombi, and the thrombi appear to attach to the blood vessel wall endothelium, normally a non-thrombogenic surface, with fibrin. Platelets in venous thrombi attach to downstream fibrin, while in arterial thrombi, they compose the core. As a whole, platelets constitute less of venous thrombi when compared to arterial ones. The process is thought to be initiated by tissue factor-affected thrombin production, which leads to fibrin deposition.

The valves of veins are a recognized site of VT initiation. Due to the blood flow pattern, the base of the valve sinus is particularly deprived of oxygen (hypoxic). Stasis exacerbates hypoxia, and this state is linked to the activation of white blood cells (leukocytes) and the endothelium. Specifically, the two pathways of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and early growth response 1 (EGR-1) are activated by hypoxia, and they contribute to monocyte and endothelial activation. Hypoxia also causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production that can activate HIF-1, EGR-1, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which regulates HIF-1 transcription.

HIF-1 and EGR-1 pathways lead to monocyte association with endothelial proteins, such as P-selectin, prompting monocytes to release tissue factor-filled microvesicles, which presumably initiate fibrin deposition (via thrombin) after binding the endothelial surface.
==Diagnosis==
==Prevention==

Numerous medications have been shown to reduce the risk of a person having a VTE, however careful decision making is required in order to decide if a person&#x27;s risk of having a VTE outweighs the risks associated with most thromboprophylaxis treatment approaches (medications to prevent venous thrombosis). It is recommended that people should be assessed at their hospital discharge for persistent high-risk of venous thrombosis and that people who adopt a heart-healthy lifestyle might lower their risk of venous thrombosis. Clinical policy from the American College of Physicians states a lack of support for any performance measures that incentivize physicians to apply universal prophylaxis without regard to the risks.

=== Surgery ===
Evidence supports the use of heparin in people following surgery who have a high risk of thrombosis to reduce the risk of DVTs; however, the effect on PEs or overall mortality is not known. In hospitalized non-surgical patients, mortality does not appear to change. It does not appear, however, to decrease the rate of symptomatic DVTs. Using both heparin and compression stockings appears better than either one alone in reducing the rate of DVT.

=== Non-surgical medical conditions ===
In hospitalized people who have had a stroke and not had surgery, mechanical measures (compression stockings) resulted in skin damage and no clinical improvement. Data on the effectiveness of compression stockings among hospitalized non-surgical patients without stroke is scarce.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) gave three strong recommendations with moderate quality evidence on VTE prevention in non-surgical patients:
* that hospitalized patients be assessed for their risk of thromboembolism and bleeding before prophylaxis (prevention);
* that heparin or a related drug is used if potential benefits are thought to outweigh potential harms;
* and that graduated compression stockings not be used.
In adults who have had their lower leg casted, braced, or otherwise immobilized for more than a week, LMWH may decrease the risk and severity of deep vein thrombosis, but does not have any effect on the incidence of pulmonary embolism.

=== Prior VTE ===
Following the completion of warfarin in those with prior VTE, the use of long-term aspirin has been shown to be beneficial.

=== Cancer ===
People who have cancer have a higher risk of VTE and may respond differently to anticoagulant preventative treatments and prevention measures. The American Society of Hematology strongly suggests that people undergoing chemotherapy for cancer who are at low risk of a VTE avoid medications to prevent thrombosis (thromboprophylaxis). For people undergoing chemotherapy for cancer that do not require a hospital stay (those undergoing ambulatory care), there is low certainty evidence to suggest that treatment with direct factor Xa inhibitors may help prevent symptomatic VTEs, however this treatment approach may also lead to an increase in the risk of a major bleed compared to a placebo medication. There is stronger evidence to suggest that LMWH helps prevent symptomatic VTE, however this treatment approach also comes with a higher risk of a major bleed compared to a placebo medication or no treatments to prevent VTE.

For people who are having surgery for cancer, it is recommended that they receive anticoagulation therapy (preferably LMWH) in order to prevent a VTE. LMWH is recommended for at least 7–10 days following cancer surgery, and for one month following surgery for people who have a high risk of VTEs.

Specifically for patients with various types of lymphoma, there is a risk assessment model, ThroLy, to help providers determine how likely a thromboembolic event is to occur.

==Treatment==

American evidence-based clinical guidelines were published in 2016 for the treatment of VTE. In the UK, guidelines by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) were published in 2012, updated in 2020. These guidelines do not cover rare forms of thrombosis, for which an individualized approach is often needed. Central and branch retinal vein occlusion does not benefit from anticoagulation in the way that other venous thromboses do.

===Anticoagulation===
If diagnostic testing cannot be performed swiftly, many are commenced on empirical treatment. Traditionally this was heparin, but several of the DOACs are licensed for treatment without initial heparin use.

If heparin is used for initial treatment of VTE, fixed doses with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) may be more effective than adjusted doses of unfractionated heparin (UFH) in reducing blood clots. No differences in mortality, prevention of major bleeding, or preventing VTEs from recurring were observed between LMWH and UFH. No differences have been detected in the route of administration of UFH (subcutaneous or intravenous). LMWH is usually administered by a subcutaneous injection, and a person&#x27;s blood clotting factors do not have to be monitored as closely as with UFH.

Once the diagnosis is confirmed, a decision needs to be made about the nature of the ongoing treatment and its duration. USA recommendations for those without cancer include anticoagulation (medication that prevents further blood clots from forming) with the DOACs dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban rather than warfarin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).

For those with cancer, LMWH is recommended, although DOACs appear safe in the majority of situations. For long-term treatment in people with cancer, LMWH is probably more effective at reducing VTEs when compared to vitamin K antagonists. People with cancer have a higher risk of experiencing reoccurring VTE episodes (&quot;recurrent VTE&quot;), even while taking preventative anticoagulation medication. These people should be given therapeutic doses of LMWH medication, either by switching from another anticoagulant or by taking a higher dose of LMWH.

In pregnancy, warfarin and DOACs are not considered suitable and LMWH is recommended.

For those with a small pulmonary embolism and few risk factors, no anticoagulation is needed. Anticoagulation is, however, recommended in those who do have risk factors.

=== Thrombolysis ===
Thrombolysis is the administration of medication (a recombinant enzyme) that activates plasmin, the body&#x27;s main enzyme that breaks down blood clots. This carries a risk of bleeding and is therefore reserved for those who have a form of thrombosis that may cause major complications. In pulmonary embolism, this applies in situations where heart function is compromised due to lack of blood flow through the lungs (&quot;massive&quot; or &quot;high risk&quot; pulmonary embolism), leading to low blood pressure. Deep vein thrombosis may require thrombolysis if there is a significant risk of post-thrombotic syndrome. Thrombolysis may be administered by intravenous catheter directly into the clot (&quot;catheter-directed thrombolysis&quot;); this requires a lower dose of the medication and may carry a lower bleeding risk but evidence for its benefit is limited.

===Inferior vena cava filters===
Inferior vena cava filters (IVCFs) are not recommended in those who are on anticoagulants. IVCFs may be used in clinical situations where a person has a high risk of experiencing a pulmonary embolism, but cannot be on anticoagulants due to a high risk of bleeding, or they have active bleeding. Retrievable IVCFs are recommended if IVCFs must be used, and a plan should be created to remove the filter when it is no longer needed.

===Superficial venous thrombosis===
While topical treatments for superficial venous thrombosis are widely used, the evidence is strongest for the heparin-like drug fondaparinux (a factor Xa inhibitor), which reduces extension and recurrence of superficial venous thrombosis as well as progression to symptomatic embolism.

==Prognosis==
After an episode of unprovoked VTE, the risk of further episodes after completing treatment remains elevated, although this risk diminishes over time. Over ten years, 41% of men and 29% of women can expect to experience a further episode. For each episode, the risk of death is 4%.

<doc id="211193" wikidata="Q1257" url="?curid=211193" title="Boutros Boutros-Ghali">
<text>Boutros Boutros-Ghali (; ; 14 November 1922 – 16 February 2016) was an Egyptian politician and diplomat who served as the sixth Secretary-General of the United Nations from 1992 to 1996. Prior to his appointment as secretary-general, Boutros-Ghali was the acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of Egypt between 1977 and 1979. He oversaw the United Nations over a period coinciding with several world crises, including the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Rwandan genocide.

Born to a Coptic Christian family in Cairo, Boutros-Ghali was an academic by training and taught international law and international relations at Cairo University from 1949 to 1979. His political career began during the presidency of Anwar Sadat, who appointed him acting foreign minister in 1977. In that capacity, he helped negotiate the Camp David Accords and the Egypt–Israel peace treaty between Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin. He was acting foreign minister until early 1991, when he served as deputy foreign minister for a few months.

Boutros-Ghali was elected secretary-general by the United Nations General Assembly in 1991 and began his term in 1992, succeeding Javier Pérez de Cuéllar. His tenure was marked by controversy and crises, which included the Somali Civil War, the Rwandan Civil War, the continuing Angolan Civil War and the Yugoslav Wars. He received criticism over UN inaction in Angola and during the genocide in Rwanda, and the perceived ineffectiveness of the UN peacekeeping operation in Bosnia led to a NATO intervention. In 1996, Boutros-Ghali ran unopposed for a second term as secretary-general, but the United States, long dissatisfied with his leadership, denied his bid by exercising its Security Council veto.

After leaving the UN, Boutros-Ghali served as the first Secretary-General of La Francophonie from 1997 to 2002. He then became chairman of the South Centre, an intergovernmental think tank for developing countries. He died in 2016, in Cairo at the age of 93.

== Early life and education ==
Boutros Boutros-Ghali was born in Cairo, Egypt, on 14 November 1922 into a Coptic Orthodox Christian family. His father Yusuf Butros Ghali was the son of Boutros Ghali &quot;Bey&quot; then &quot;Pasha&quot; (also his namesake), who was Prime Minister of Egypt from 1908 until he was assassinated in 1910. His mother, Safela Mikhail Sharubim, was daughter of Mikhail Sharubim (1861–1920), a prominent public servant and historian. The young boy was brought up by a Slovenian nanny, one of the so-called &quot;&quot;; he was closer to Milena, &quot;his invaluable friend and confidant&quot;, than to his own mother.

Boutros-Ghali graduated from Cairo University in 1946. He received a PhD in international law from the Faculty of Law of Paris (University of Paris) and diploma in international relations from Sciences Po in 1949. During 1949–1979, he was appointed Professor of International Law and International Relations at Cairo University. He became President of the Centre of Political and Strategic Studies in 1975 and President of the African Society of Political Studies in 1980. He was a Fulbright Research Scholar at Columbia University from 1954 to 1955, Director of the Centre of Research at The Hague Academy of International Law from 1963 to 1964, and Visiting Professor at the Faculty of Law of Paris from 1967 to 1968. In 1986, he received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Law at Uppsala University, Sweden. He was also the Honorary Rector of the Graduate Institute of Peace Studies, a branch of Kyunghee University Seoul.

== Political career ==

Boutros-Ghali&#x27;s political career developed during the presidency of Anwar Sadat. He was a member of the Central Committee of the Arab Socialist Union from 1974 to 1977. He served as Egypt&#x27;s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs from 1977 until early 1991. He then became Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs for several months before moving to the UN. As Minister of State, he played a part in the peace agreements between President Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin.

According to investigative journalist Linda Melvern, Boutros-Ghali approved a secret $26 million arms sale to the government of Rwanda in 1990, when he was foreign minister, the weapons stockpiled by the Hutu regime as part of the fairly public, long-term preparations for the subsequent genocide. He was serving as UN secretary-general when the killings occurred four years later.

== United Nations Secretary-General ==

=== 1991 selection ===
Boutros-Ghali ran for Secretary-General of the United Nations in the 1991 selection. The top post in the UN was opening up as Javier Pérez de Cuéllar of Peru reached the end of his second term, and Africa was next in the rotation. Boutros-Ghali tied Bernard Chidzero of Zimbabwe in the first two rounds of polling, edged ahead by one vote in round 3, and fell behind by one vote in round 4. After several countries withdrew their support for Chidzero, fed by fears that the United States was trying to eliminate both of the leading candidates, Boutros-Ghali won a clear victory in round 5.

=== Tenure (1992–1996) ===

Boutros-Ghali&#x27;s term in office remains controversial. In 1992, he submitted &quot;An Agenda for Peace&quot;, a suggestion for how the UN could respond to violent conflict. He set three goals: for the UN to be more active in promoting democracy, for the UN to conduct preventative diplomacy to avert crises, and to expand the UN&#x27;s role as peacekeeper. Although the goals were consistent with those of US president George H. W. Bush, he nevertheless repeatedly clashed with the United States, especially with his efforts to enlist the support of the US, to involve UN more deeply in the civil wars in Somalia (1992) and in Rwanda (1994). The United States refused to send peace enforcement units under UN leadership. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called on Boutros-Ghali to resign for failing to take any firm action to help resolve the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Boutros-Ghali was criticised for the UN&#x27;s failure to act during the 1994 Rwandan genocide, during which over a half million people were killed. Boutros-Ghali also appeared unable to muster support in the UN for intervention in the continuing Angolan Civil War. One of the hardest tasks during his term was dealing with the crisis of the Yugoslav Wars after the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia. The UN peacekeeping force was ineffective in Bosnia and Herzegovina, leading to the intervention by NATO in December 1995. His reputation became entangled in the larger controversies over the effectiveness of the UN and the role of the United States in the UN.

The US journalist Mark Bowden argues that he was responsible for an escalation of the Somalia crisis by undertaking a personal vendetta against Mohamed Farrah Aidid and his Habar Gidir clan, favouring their rivals, the Darod, the clan of the former dictator Siad Barre. In Bowden&#x27;s opinion, it was believed that he demanded the 12 July 1993 US helicopter attack on a meeting of Habar Gidir clan leaders, who were meeting to discuss a peace initiative put forward by the leader of the UN Mission in Mogadishu, retired US Admiral Jonathan Howe. Bowden further suggests that most of the clan elders were eager to arrange peace and rein in the subversive activities of their clan leader Aidid. Still, after this attack on a peaceful meeting, the clan was resolved to fight the Americans and the UN, leading to the Battle of Mogadishu on 3–4 October 1993.

=== Second term vetoed ===
Boutros-Ghali ran unopposed for the customary second term in 1996, despite efforts by the United States to unseat him. US ambassador Madeleine Albright asked Boutros-Ghali to resign and offered to establish a foundation for him to run, an offer that other Western diplomats called &quot;ludicrous&quot;. American diplomatic pressure also had no effect, as other members of the Security Council remained unwavering in their support for Boutros-Ghali. He won 14 of the 15 votes in the Security Council, but the sole opposing vote was a US veto. After four deadlocked meetings of the Security Council, France offered a compromise in which Boutros-Ghali would be appointed to a short term of two years, but the United States rejected the French offer. Finally, Boutros-Ghali suspended his candidacy, becoming the second Secretary-General ever to be denied re-election by a veto, with Kurt Waldheim being the first.

== Later life ==
From 1997 to 2002, Boutros-Ghali was Secretary-General of La Francophonie, an organisation of French-speaking nations. From 2002 to 2005, he served as the chairman of the board of the South Centre, an intergovernmental research organisation of developing countries. Boutros-Ghali played a &quot;significant role&quot; in creating Egypt&#x27;s National Council for Human Rights and served as its president until 2012.

Boutros-Ghali supported the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly and was one of the initial signatories of the Campaign&#x27;s appeal in 2007. In a message to the Campaign, he stressed the necessity to establish democratic participation of citizens at the global level. From 2009 to 2015, he also participated as a jury member for the Conflict Prevention Prize, awarded every year by the Fondation Chirac.

== Death ==
Boutros-Ghali died aged 93 in a Cairo hospital after being admitted for a broken pelvis or leg on 16 February 2016. A military funeral was held for him with prayers led by Pope Tawadros II of Alexandria. He is buried at Petrine Church in Abbassia, Cairo.

== Personal life ==
Boutros-Ghali&#x27;s wife, Leia Maria Nadler (1924–2024), was raised in an Egyptian Jewish family in Alexandria and converted to Catholicism as a young woman.

He received honorary degrees from Sciences Po, Russian Academy of Sciences, Catholic University of Leuven, , Université de Moncton, Carleton University, Université du Québec à Chicoutimi, Charles III University of Madrid, University of Bucharest, Baku State University, Yerevan State University, University of Haifa, University of Vienna, University of Melbourne, Seoul National University, Waseda University, University of Bordeaux, and Uppsala University.

<doc id="211203" wikidata="Q521576" url="?curid=211203" title="Pump Up the Valuum">
<text>Pump Up the Valuum is the eighth studio album by the American punk rock band NOFX. It was released on June 13, 2000, on Epitaph Records, their last through the company.

== Production ==
The album&#x27;s title deliberately misspells the trademark &quot;Valium&quot; to avoid a lawsuit, similar to the one The Melvins faced for their album &quot;Lysol&quot;. This is explained in the &quot;45 Or 46 Songs...&quot; album booklet.

The initial song, &quot;And Now for Something Completely Similar,&quot; is a parody of the famous saying &quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot; from Monty Python skits. As a prank, the intro sounds very similar to &quot;Linoleum&quot; from the band&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Punk in Drublic&quot;, right down to El Hefe warming up his voice before the song begins, while the solo bass part echoes Shadows of Defeat from Good Riddance. Both similarities are addressed in the song&#x27;s lyrics.

The song &quot;Dinosaurs Will Die&quot; features a part of the intro skit from The F.U.&#x27;s song &quot;Civil Defense&quot; off the album &#x27;Kill For Christ&#x27;. The words which are spoken during this intro (&quot;This is not a test of the emergency broadcast system&quot;) also appear in the Bad Religion song &quot;Los Angeles Is Burning&quot;, on their 2004 album &quot;The Empire Strikes First&quot;.

The band recorded eight more songs that were left off the final version of the album. According to Fat Mike, &quot;...the title track &#x27;Pump Up the Valuum&#x27; got cut from the album. That&#x27;s weird. We gave it to Epitaph for Punk O Rama 5.&quot; Three other songs were mentioned in the Pump Up the Valuum booklet, which appeared elsewhere: &quot;Medio-core&quot; (later in The War on Errorism, 2003); &quot;Insulted By Germans&quot; (later in 7&quot; of the Month #1, 2005, and Wolves In Wolves&#x27; Clothing, 2006); and &quot;One Way Ticket to Fuckneckville&quot; (later in Aggropop Now 2003, The War on Errorism, and 7&quot; of the Month #7, 2005). Other outtakes include &quot;Pods and Gods&quot;, &quot;Lower&quot;, &quot;Bath of Least Resistance&quot;, &quot;San Francisco Fat&quot;, and &quot;Pump Up the Valium&quot;.

== Release ==
On November 19, 1999, it was reported that NOFX&#x27;s next album would be titled &quot;Pump Up the Valuum&quot;. On March 23, 2000, the album was announced for release in June. &quot;Take Two Placebos and Call Me Lame&quot; was posted on Epitaph&#x27;s website for free download on April 16, 2000. &quot;Bottles to the Ground&quot; was sent to radio in May 2000. In May and June 2001, the band went on a tour of North-western US, and the western Canada. The band embarked on a brief US tour in October and November 2001, with support from Frenzal Rhomb and the Mad Caddies. In February 2002, the band toured across Australia with Frenzal Rhomb. The band played 10 shows in the US with Rancid in April 2002.

== Critical reception ==

In 2005, &quot;Pump Up the Valuum&quot; was ranked number 331 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. The album was included at number 17 on &quot;Rock Sound&quot;″s &quot;The 51 Most Essential Pop Punk Albums of All Time&quot; list.

<text>Kieren John Perkins (born 14 August 1973) is an Australian former freestyle swimmer. He specialised in the 1500-metre freestyle and won successive Olympic gold medals in this event in the 1990s. He won his first at the 1992 Olympics which he won in world record time and then at the 1996 Olympics when he defended his title. In total he won four Olympic medals.

==Early life==
Perkins was born in Brisbane, Queensland. He attended Indooroopilly State Primary School and graduated from Brisbane Boys&#x27; College in the inner city suburb of Toowong.
He began swimming regularly at age eight as part of his rehabilitation from a serious leg injury incurred after running through a plate glass window.
At age 13 his potential became obvious, and with coach John Carew guiding him he won his first medal at the Australian Championships in Melbourne in 1989.

==Early international career (1990–1992)==
===1990 Commonwealth Games===
Perkins&#x27;s first major international meet was the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand.
Perkins won the silver medal in the 1500-metre freestyle behind fellow Queenslander Glen Housman. Both Housman (14:55.25) and Perkins (14:58.08) broke 15 minutes which was the first time Perkins had recorded a sub-fifteen-minute 1500 metres.

===1991 World Championships===
There was much expectation around Perkins at the 1991 World Aquatics Championships in Perth in the 1500 m freestyle, but he was beaten in the final by just 0.22 seconds by German Jörg Hoffmann who set a new world-record time. Perkins swam 14:50.58, which was also far under the previous world record.

===1992 Olympic Games===
Perkins was favourite for the men&#x27;s 1500-metre freestyle at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. The fastest qualifier for the final, Perkins broke his own world record by 5 seconds to 14:43.48. This was the only gold medal won by an Australian swimmer at these Games.

Earlier in the meet, Perkins finished second in the 400 m final. Russian Yevgeny Sadovyi representing the Unified Team won the race in a world record time. Perkins also broke the world record as he finished 0.16 behind.

Perkins was the Australian flag bearer at the closing ceremony.

==Peak international career (1993–1996)==
===1994 Commonwealth Games===
At the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, Perkins won four gold medals in the 200 m, 400 m, 1500 m and 4 x 200 m freestyle relay all in world record time.

===1994 World Championships===
Two weeks after the Commonwealth Games, Perkins competed in the 1994 World Aquatics Championships in Rome. He won two gold medals in the 400 m and 1500 m, the 400 m in World Record time. His 400 m and 1500 m world records made that year stood until 1999 and 2001 respectively, broken by fellow Australians Ian Thorpe and Grant Hackett. His performances in that year earned him the Male World Swimmer of the Year award from &quot;Swimming World&quot; magazine.
He later described the Olympic Pool in Rome as his favourite pool.

===1996 Olympic Games===
At the time of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Perkins was out of form and long-time Australian rival Daniel Kowalski was regarded as the favourite. In fact his form was so poor that he almost failed to make the Australian team. Perkins qualified for the 1500-metre freestyle final by a mere 0.24 seconds to be the slowest of the top 8 qualifiers, and it was later revealed that before the race he felt unwell and considered not swimming. From lane eight, Perkins dominated the race being the only swimmer to go under 15 minutes (14:56.40), again relegating Kowalski, who had to fight all the way and just held off Graeme Smith. Perkins became just the third swimmer to win consecutive gold medals in this event. He became the only Australian since Dawn Fraser to defend an individual Olympic championship successfully in Olympics held outside Australia.

==Era of Dominance Over (1998–2000)==
===1998 Commonwealth Games===
Perkins carried the flag at the opening ceremony for the 1998 Commonwealth Games held in Kuala Lumpur. In the 1500 m freestyle, he won bronze behind 18 year old heir apparent Grant Hackett and Ryk Neethling.

===2000 Olympic Games===
Perkins was in Monte Carlo in 1993 the night Sydney won the right to host the games and managed to qualify for his 3rd Olympic Games. Despite being just 27, he was now the elder statesman of the team. It was a reverse of four years earlier where Perkins was the fastest qualifier heading into the final, but Grant Hackett won gold with Perkins winning silver. Perkins joined Frank Beaurepaire as one of two swimmers to win three medals in this event.

==Legacy==
With the nickname of Super Fish, Perkins retired from swimming in 2000, at age 27, having amassed 23 medals at international competitions. 
He set 11 world records, holding the 1500 m freestyle record for nine years, the 800 m for ten years and the 400 m freestyle for five years.
He is the first person in history to hold the Olympic, World, Commonwealth and Pan Pacific titles simultaneously.

He broke over 40 Australian records during a career spanning from 1989 to 2000.

Perkins won two of the 16 gold medals Australia won at the 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games. He was one of 6 Australians to win gold medals at both of these Games. Perkins won 2 of the 3 swimming gold Australia won during this time. There was a mythology in Australia with the 1500 m freestyle that Perkins revived and brought into modern times. Australian swimmers won Olympic gold in the 1500 m from 1956 to 1964 but nothing for 28 years until Perkins broke the drought. In fact, Australia has won the event more times than any other nation.

==Honours==
In the Australia Day Honours of 1992, Perkins was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM).

==Awards==
Perkins was named 1992 Young Australian of the Year.
Also named an Australian Living Treasure, he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2002. In 2009 Perkins was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame. Also in 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Kieren Perkins was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for his role as a &quot;sports legend&quot;.
Perkins was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Queensland.

==Post-swimming career==
Since his retirement, he claims to have not even recreationally swum due to a bad back. Professionally, he has occasionally worked in the broadcast media. He joined National Australia Bank in 2009. Perkins was part of the team that conducted a review of the Australian swimming team at the 2012 Olympics. 
In November 2020, Perkins was appointed as President of Swimming Australia.
He was a director of the Starlight Foundation.

On 17 December 2021, Perkins was named the new CEO of the Australian Sports Commission and the Australian Institute of Sport. Perkins is an outspoken critic of the so-called &quot;Enhanced Games&quot;, an Olympic-style sports competition that would permit doping, saying in March 2024 at a SportNXT conference in Melbourne: &quot;Someone will die if we allow that sort of environment to continue to foster and flourish.&quot;

==Personal life==
Perkins married in 1997 and has three children with ex-wife Symantha. In June 2012, Perkins announced that he and Symantha had separated. In October 2014, Perkins married Karen Davis in Positano, Italy.

<doc id="211220" wikidata="Q8028053" url="?curid=211220" title="With This Ring (TV series)">
<text>With This Ring (originally known as Happily Ever After) was a prime time panel show aired by the DuMont Television Network on Sundays from January 21, 1951, to March 11, 1951.

The show featured engaged couples who had recently applied for a marriage license. They were given scenarios about marriage and marital problems sent in by viewers, and would discuss how they would handle each situation. The show was initially hosted by Bill Slater, but the show quickly changed hosts to Martin Gabel, then left the air.

This show is not related in any way to a 15-minute syndicated program of the same name that aired weekly (usually on Sundays) on local stations throughout the U.S. for about 25 years beginning in the early 1970s. The latter program was a Roman Catholic-produced show concerning the church&#x27;s doctrinal and moral positions on marriage and family life, and was produced at WJBK-TV in Detroit.

<doc id="211221" wikidata="Q7775377" url="?curid=211221" title="The Wizard of Odds">
<text>The Wizard of Odds is an American television game show hosted by Alex Trebek that aired on NBC from July 17,1973, to June 28, 1974, in which people from the studio audience vied in a number of rounds, primarily games revolving around statistical questions. John Harlan announced the pilot; Los Angeles radio personality Sam Riddle was the show&#x27;s first announcer; towards the end of the run, Charlie O&#x27;Donnell replaced him. The title was a parody of the classic 1939 movie &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and was the first American game show Trebek hosted.

==Broadcast history==
Relatively short-lived, &quot;The Wizard of Odds&quot; replaced &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; with Joe Garagiola at 11:00 a.m. Eastern (10:00 Central). The show did not perform well against CBS&#x27; &quot;Gambit&quot; (later replaced by &quot;Now You See It&quot; with Jack Narz) and NBC dropped it after less than a year.

&quot;Wizard&quot; was Trebek&#x27;s first American game show, after starting his broadcast career in his native Canada. He later hosted four more NBC games, &quot;High Rollers&quot; (which replaced &quot;Wizard&quot;), from 1974 to 1976 and again as &quot;The New High Rollers&quot; from 1978 to 1980, &quot;Battlestars&quot; from 1981 to 1982 and again as &quot;The New Battlestars&quot; in 1983 &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; from 1987 to 1991. Finally, his fourth one was a brief revival of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; in 1991. Beginning in 1984, he hosted the syndicated TV hit game &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; until his death in 2020.

===Episode status===
It is believed that the series was wiped, per network policy of the era, with NBC continuing this policy until 1979. The May 20, 1974 episode with special guest actor Don DeFore exists in the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive. An audio recording of the finale also exists.

One surviving episode, labeled as airing on March 19, 1974, was uploaded to YouTube on October 12, 2022.

==Rules of the game==
Contestants were selected from the studio audience and answered questions based on statistical information, all for cash and prizes.

&quot;The Wizard&quot; (Trebek) began the show by choosing three contestants and asking them questions based on the law of averages, with cash and prizes awarded accordingly for correct answers; an example of a question was &quot;What are the odds a man will recover his lost wallet if there is more than $20 inside it?&quot;

The next three players were given a series of phrases and told to pick the one that did not match. The person with the most correct answers was given the chance to pick one of five prizes, located behind windows that were either &quot;open&quot; or &quot;locked&quot;. This person could continue to play or stop at any time, keeping the prizes; however, selecting a window that was locked lost all prizes accumulated up to that point.

Every contestant selected had his or her name added to the &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Wheel of Fortune.&quot;

===Wizard&#x27;s Wheel of Fortune===
At the end of the show, Trebek spun the wheel and the person it landed on was eligible for bonus gifts. A list of averages was then brought out, with a number above it. The contestant had to pick a group of items whose average added up to exactly the target number. If the contestant was correct, he or she won the bonus gifts, including a brand new car.

==Theme==
The theme song was composed and sung by Alan Thicke, also from Canada, who was also one of the show&#x27;s producers.

==Lawsuit==
Nearly a week after the show debuted, Leo Guild (who has created numerous radio and television shows, books, and newspaper columns) filed a $2 million lawsuit against NBC for stealing his &quot;Wizard&quot; title, which had been used as a newspaper column during the late 1940s.

<text>Woman to Woman (1983) is an American nationally-syndicated female-oriented television talk show that was hosted by Pat Mitchell from &quot;Hour Magazine&quot;. &quot;Woman to Woman&quot; featured one topic each day. It was recorded in front of an all-female audience.

A unique feature of the show&#x27;s syndication was the fact that it was available to stations in both an hour- and half-hour-long format.

Critic John J. O&#x27;Connor called the series &quot;certainly a step in the right direction for daytime commercial television&quot;, and said, &quot;Much of this is, by now, hardly earth-shattering in terms of being new, but it is being handled with intelligence.&quot; In 1984 it won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show.

<text>In computing, the Windows Sockets API (WSA), later shortened to Winsock, is an application programming interface (API) that defines how Windows network application software should access network services, especially TCP/IP. It defines a standard interface between a Windows TCP/IP client application (such as an FTP client or a web browser) and the underlying TCP/IP protocol stack. The nomenclature is based on the Berkeley sockets API used in BSD for communications between programs.

==Background==
Early Microsoft operating systems, both MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows, offered limited networking capability, chiefly based on NetBIOS. In particular, Microsoft did not offer support for the TCP/IP protocol stack at that time. A number of university groups and commercial vendors, including the PC/IP group at MIT, FTP Software, Sun Microsystems, Ungermann-Bass, and Excelan, introduced TCP/IP products for MS-DOS, often as part of a hardware/software bundle. When Windows 2.0 was released, these vendors were joined by others such as Distinct and NetManage in offering TCP/IP for Windows.

The drawback faced by all of these vendors was that each of them used their own API (Application Programming Interface). Without a single standard programming model, it was difficult to persuade independent software developers to create networking applications which would work with any vendor&#x27;s underlying TCP/IP implementation. Add to this the fact that end users were wary of getting locked into a single vendor and it became clear that some standardization was needed.

The Windows Sockets project had its origins in a Birds of a Feather session held at Interop &#x27;91 in San Jose on October 10, 1991. It is based on socket specifications created by NetManage and which it put into public domain at this meeting. At the time the NetManage socket was the only 100% DLL-based, multi-threaded product for Windows 3.0 available. The first edition of the specification was authored by Martin Hall, Mark Towfiq of Microdyne (later Sun Microsystems), Geoff Arnold of Sun Microsystems, and Henry Sanders and J Allard of Microsoft, with assistance from many others. There was some discussion about how best to address the copyright, intellectual property, and potential anti-trust issues, and consideration was given to working through the IETF or establishing a non-profit foundation. In the end, it was decided that the specification would simply be copyrighted by the five authors as (unaffiliated) individuals.

All the participating developers resisted the shortening of the name to simple Winsock for a long time, since there was much confusion among users between the API and the DLL library file (winsock.dll) which only exposed the common WSA interfaces to applications above it. Users would commonly believe that only making sure the DLL file was present on a system would provide full TCP/IP protocol support.

==Technology==
The Windows Sockets API specification defines two interfaces: the API used by application developers, and the SPI, which provides a means for network software developers to add new protocol modules to the system. Each interface represents a contract. The API guarantees that a conforming application will function correctly with a conforming protocol implementation from any network software vendor. The SPI contract guarantees that a conforming protocol module may be added to Windows and will thereby be usable by an API-compliant application. Although these contracts were important when Windows Sockets was first released, since network environments required multi-protocol support (see above) they are now of only academic interest. Included in the Windows Sockets API version 2.0 are functions to use IPX/SPX, although the protocol was all but obsolete already at the time WSA 2.0 shipped. Microsoft has shipped the TCP/IP protocol stack with all recent versions of Windows, and there are no significant independent alternatives. Nor has there been significant interest in implementing protocols other than TCP/IP.

Windows Sockets code and design are based on BSD sockets, but provides additional functionality to allow the API to comply with the regular Windows programming model. The Windows Sockets API covered almost all the features of the BSD sockets API, but there were some unavoidable obstacles which mostly arose out of fundamental differences between Windows and Unix (though Windows Sockets differed less from BSD sockets than the latter did from STREAMS). All function calls in the API begin with the moniker , e.g. for sending data on a connected socket.

However it was a design goal of Windows Sockets that it should be relatively easy for developers to port socket-based applications from Unix to Windows. It was not considered sufficient to create an API which was only useful for newly written Windows programs. For this reason, Windows Sockets included a number of elements which were designed to facilitate porting. For example, Unix applications were able to use the same variable to record both networking errors and errors detected within standard C library functions. Since this was not possible in Windows, Windows Sockets introduced a dedicated function, , to retrieve error information. Such mechanisms were helpful, but application porting remained extremely complex. Many original TCP/IP applications had been implemented by using system features specific to Unix, such as pseudo terminals and the fork system call, and reproducing such functionality in Windows was problematic. Within a relatively short time, porting gave way to the development of dedicated Windows applications.

== Specifications ==
* Version 1.0 (June 1992) defined the basic operation of Winsock. It was kept very close to the existing interface of Berkeley sockets to simplify porting of existing applications. A few Windows-specific extensions were added, mainly for asynchronous operations with message-based notifications.
: Although the document didn&#x27;t limit support to TCP/IP, TCP and UDP were the only protocols explicitly mentioned. Most vendors only delivered TCP/IP support, although Winsock from DEC included DECNet support as well.

* Version 1.1 (January 1993) made many minor corrections and clarifications of the specification. The most significant change was the inclusion of the function.
* Winsock 2 was a backwards-compatible extension of Winsock 1.1. It added support for protocol-independent name resolution, asynchronous operations with event-based notifications and completion routines, layered protocol implementations, multicasting, and quality of service. It also formalized support for multiple protocols, including IPX/SPX and DECnet. The new specification allowed sockets to be optionally shared between processes, incoming connection requests to be conditionally accepted, and certain operations to be performed on socket groups rather than individual sockets. Although the new specification differed substantially from Winsock 1, it provided source- and binary-level compatibility with the Winsock 1.1 API. One of the lesser known additions was the Service Provider Interface (SPI) API and Layered Service Providers.
* Versions 2.0.x (May 1994 onwards) had internal draft status, and were not announced as public standards.
* Version 2.1.0 (January 1996) was the first public release of the Winsock 2 specification.
* Version 2.2.0 (May 1996) included many minor corrections, clarifications, and usage recommendations. It was also the first version to remove support for 16-bit Windows applications.
* Version 2.2.1 (May 1997) and Version 2.2.2 (August 1997) introduced minor functionality enhancements. Mechanisms were added for querying and receiving notification of changes in network and system configuration.
* The IPv6 Technical Preview for Windows 2000 (December 2000) saw the first implementation of (March 1999, later obsoleted by ), a protocol-independent API for name resolution, which would become part of Winsock in Windows XP.

== Updates in Windows 8 ==
Windows 8 includes the &quot;RIO&quot; (Registered IO) extensions for Winsock. 
These extensions are designed to reduce the overhead of the user to kernel mode transition for the network data path and the notification path, but use the rest of the regular Windows TCP and UDP stack (and uses existing network cards). The setup path (for example, the &quot;connect&quot; function) is unchanged from the regular Winsock path.

== Implementations ==

=== Microsoft implementations ===
* Microsoft did not supply an implementation of Winsock 1.0.
* Version 1.1 of Winsock was supplied in an add-on package (called Wolverine) for Windows for Workgroups (code named Snowball). It was an integral component of Windows 95 and Windows NT from versions 3.5 and onwards (the initial commercially available version of Windows NT, version 3.1, included only a proprietary and quite incomplete implementation of TCP/IP based on the AT&amp;T UNIX System V &quot;STREAMS&quot; API ).
* Version 2.1 of Winsock was supplied in an add-on package for Windows 95. It was an integral component of Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0, and all subsequent Windows releases. (Microsoft did not supply implementations of Winsock 2 for Windows 3.x or Windows NT 3.x.)
* Recent versions of Winsock 2.x have been delivered with new Windows releases or as part of service packs.
* Winsock 2 is extensible by a mechanism known as a Layered Service Provider (LSP). Winsock LSPs are available for a wide range of useful purposes, including Internet parental controls, web content filtering, QoS etc. The layering order of all providers is kept in the Winsock Catalog. In previous versions of Windows, removing a buggy LSP could result in corruption of the Winsock catalog in the registry, potentially resulting in a loss of &quot;all network connectivity&quot;. Winsock in Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 and all later Windows operating systems has the ability to self-heal after a user uninstalls such an LSP.

===Other implementations===
*Among the other vendors offering Winsock-compliant TCP/IP and UDP/IP stacks were (alphabetically) 3Com, Beame &amp; Whiteside, DEC, Distinct, Frontier, FTP Software, IBM, Microdyne, NetManage, Novell, Sun Microsystems and Trumpet Software International.
*Trumpet Winsock by Peter Tattam was one of the few Winsock 1.0 implementations that could be installed under Windows 3.0, which had no built-in support for Winsock. Trumpet was also the most popular shareware implementation of Winsock for Windows 3.x. Trumpet Winsock 5.0 is available for Windows 95/98 and Windows NT and includes a Winsock 1.1 compliant IPv6 stack for these operating systems.
*The Wine project contains a source and binary compatible reimplementation of Winsock on top of the BSD sockets API.
