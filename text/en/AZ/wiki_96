<text>Populism is a range of political stances that emphasize the idea of the common &#x27;people&#x27; and often position this group in opposition to a perceived &#x27;elite&#x27;. It is frequently associated with anti-establishment and anti-political sentiment. The term developed in the late 19th century and has been applied to various politicians, parties and movements since that time, often as a pejorative. Within political science and other social sciences, several different definitions of populism have been employed, with some scholars proposing that the term be rejected altogether.

A common framework for interpreting populism is known as the ideational approach: this defines populism as an ideology that presents &quot;the people&quot; as a morally good force and contrasts them against &quot;the elite&quot;, who are portrayed as corrupt and self-serving. Populists differ in how &quot;the people&quot; are defined, but it can be based along class, ethnic, or national lines. Populists typically present &quot;the elite&quot; as comprising the political, economic, cultural, and media establishment, depicted as a homogeneous entity and accused of placing their own interests, and often the interests of other groups—such as large corporations, foreign countries, or the ruling political party—above the interests of &quot;the people&quot;. According to the ideational approach, populism is often combined with other ideologies, such as nationalism, liberalism, socialism, capitalism or consumerism. Thus, populists can be found at different locations along the left–right political spectrum, and there exist both left-wing populism and right-wing populism.

Other scholars of the social sciences have defined the term &quot;populism&quot; differently. According to the popular agency definition used by some historians of United States history, &quot;populism&quot; refers to popular engagement of the population in political decision-making. An approach associated with the political scientist Ernesto Laclau presents populism as an emancipatory social force through which marginalised groups challenge dominant power structures. Some economists have used the term in reference to governments which engage in substantial public spending financed by foreign loans, resulting in hyperinflation and emergency measures. In popular discourse—where the term has often been used pejoratively—it has sometimes been used synonymously with demagogy, to describe politicians who present overly simplistic answers to complex questions in a highly emotional manner, or with political opportunism, to characterise politicians who exploit problems and seek to please voters without rational consideration as to the best course of action. Some scholars have linked populist policies to adverse economic outcomes, as &quot;economic disintegration, decreasing macroeconomic stability, and the erosion of institutions typically go hand in hand with populist rule.&quot;

==Etymology and terminology==

The word &quot;populism&quot; has been contested, mistranslated and used in reference to a diverse variety of movements and beliefs. The political scientist Will Brett characterised it as &quot;a classic example of a stretched concept, pulled out of shape by overuse and misuse&quot;, while the political scientist Paul Taggart has said of populism that it is &quot;one of the most widely used but poorly understood political concepts of our time&quot;.

In 1858, an English translator for Alphonse de Lamartine used the term as an antonym for &quot;aristocratic&quot;.

In the Russian Empire in the 1860s and 1870s, a left-leaning agrarian group referred to itself as the &quot;narodniki&quot;, which has often been translated into English as &quot;populists&quot;. But the first major use of the term in English was by members of the left-leaning agrarian People&#x27;s Party and its predecessors, which were active in the United States from around 1889 to 1909. The Russian and American movements differed in various respects.

In the 1920s, the term entered the French language, where it was used to describe a group of writers expressing sympathy for ordinary people.

As the term has rarely been used as a political self-designation since the first decade of the 1900s, its meaning has broadened. As noted by the political scientist Margaret Canovan, &quot;there has been no self-conscious international populist movement which might have attempted to control or limit the term&#x27;s reference, and as a result those who have used it have been able to attach it a wide variety of meanings.&quot; In this it differs from other political terms, like &quot;socialism&quot; or &quot;conservatism&quot;, which have been widely used as self-designations by individuals who have then presented their own, internal definitions of the word. Instead it shares similarities with terms such as &quot;far left&quot;, &quot;far right&quot;, or &quot;extremist&quot;, which are often used in political discourse but rarely as self-designations.

In news media, the term &quot;populism&quot; has often been conflated with other concepts like demagoguery, and generally presented as something to be &quot;feared and discredited&quot;. It has often been applied to movements that are considered to be outside the political mainstream or a threat to democracy. The political scientists Yves Mény and Yves Surel noted that &quot;populism&quot; had become &quot;a catchword, particularly in the media, to designate the newborn political or social movements which challenge the entrenched values, rules and institutions of democratic orthodoxy.&quot; Typically, the term is used against others, often in a pejorative sense to discredit opponents.

Some of those who have repeatedly been referred to as &quot;populists&quot; in a pejorative sense have subsequently embraced the term while seeking to shed it of negative connotations. The French far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen for instance was often accused of populism and eventually responded by stating that &quot;Populism precisely is taking into account the people&#x27;s opinion. Have people the right, in a democracy, to hold an opinion? If that is the case, then yes, I am a populist.&quot; Similarly, on being founded in 2003, the centre-left Lithuanian Labour Party declared: &quot;we are and will be called populists.&quot;

Following 2016, the year which saw the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States and the United Kingdom&#x27;s vote to leave the European Union—both events linked to populism—the word &quot;populism&quot; became one of the most widely used terms by international political commentators. In 2017, the &quot;Cambridge Dictionary&quot; declared it the Word of the Year.

===Use in academia===

Until the 1950s, use of the term &quot;populism&quot; remained restricted largely to historians studying the People&#x27;s Party, but in 1954 the US sociologist Edward Shils published an article proposing &quot;populism&quot; as a term to describe anti-elite trends in US society more broadly. Following on from Shils&#x27; article, during the 1960s the term &quot;populism&quot; became increasingly popular among sociologists and other academics in the social sciences. In 1967 a Conference on Populism was held at the London School of Economics, the participants of which failed to agree on a clear, single definition. As a result of this scholarly interest, an academic field known as &quot;populism studies&quot; emerged. Interest in the subject grew rapidly: between 1950 and 1960 about 160 publications on populism appeared, while between 1990 and 2000 that number was over 1500. From 2000 to 2015, about 95 papers and books including the term &quot;populism&quot; were catalogued each year by Web of Science. In 2016, it grew to 266; in 2017, it was 488, and in 2018, it was 615. Taggart argued that this academic interest was not consistent but appeared in &quot;bursts&quot; of research that reflected the political conditions of the time.

Canovan noted that &quot;if the notion of &quot;populism&quot; did not exist, no social scientist would deliberately invent it; the term is far too ambiguous for that&quot;. From examining how the term &quot;populism&quot; had been used, she proposed that seven different types of populism could be discerned. Three of these were forms of &quot;agrarian populism&quot;; these included farmers&#x27; radicalism, peasant movements, and intellectual agrarian socialism. The other four were forms of &quot;political populism&quot;, representing populist dictatorship, populist democracy, reactionary populism, and politicians&#x27; populism. She noted that these were &quot;analytical constructs&quot; and that &quot;real-life examples may well overlap several categories&quot;, adding that no single political movement fitted into all seven categories. In this way, Canovan conceived of populism as a family of related concepts rather than as a single concept in itself.

The confusion surrounding the term has led some scholars to suggest that it should be abandoned by scholarship. In contrast to this view, the political scientists Cas Mudde and Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser stated that &quot;while the frustration is understandable, the term &quot;populism&quot; is too central to debates about politics from Europe to the Americas to simply do away with.&quot; Similarly, Canovan noted that the term &quot;does have comparatively clear and definite meanings in a number of specialist areas&quot; and that it &quot;provides a pointer, however shaky, to an interesting and largely unexplored area of political and social experience&quot;.

The political scientists Daniele Albertazzi and Duncan McDonnell thought that &quot;if carefully defined, the term &#x27;populism&#x27; can be used profitably to help us understand and explain a wide array of political actors&quot;. The political scientist Ben Stanley noted that &quot;although the meaning of the term has proven controversial in the literature, the persistence with which it has recurred suggests the existence at least of an ineliminable core: that is, that it refers to a distinct pattern of ideas.&quot; Political scientist David Art argues that the concept of populism brings together disparate phenomena in an unhelpful manner, and ultimately obscures and legitimizes figures who are more comprehensively defined as nativists and authoritarians.

Although academic definitions of &quot;populism&quot; have differed, most of them have focused on the idea that it should reference some form of relationship between &quot;the people&quot; and &quot;the elite&quot;, and that it entailed taking an anti-establishment stance. Beyond that, different scholars have emphasised different features that they wish to use to define populism. These differences have occurred both within specific scholarly disciplines and among different disciplines, varying for instance among scholars focusing on different regions and different historical periods.

Author Thomas Frank has criticized the common use of the term Populism to refer to far-right nativism and racism, noting that the original People&#x27;s Party was relatively liberal on the rights of women and minorities by the standards of the time.

The V-Party Dataset assesses populism as anti-elitism and people-centrism.

==Ideational definition==

A common approach to defining populism is known as the ideational approach. This emphasises the notion that populism should be defined according to specific ideas which underlie it, as opposed to certain economic policies or leadership styles which populist politicians may display. In this definition, the term &quot;populism&quot; is applied to political groups and individuals who make appeals to &quot;the people&quot; and then contrast this group against &quot;the elite&quot;.

Adopting this approach, Albertazzi and McDonnell define populism as an ideology that &quot;pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of elites and dangerous &#x27;others&#x27; who are together depicted as depriving (or attempting to deprive) the sovereign people of their rights, values, prosperity, identity, and voice&quot;. Similarly, the political scientist Carlos de la Torre defined populism as &quot;a Manichean discourse that divides politics and society as the struggle between two irreconcilable and antagonistic camps: the people and the oligarchy or the power block.&quot;

In this understanding, note Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, &quot;populism always involves a critique of the establishment and an adulation of the common people&quot;, and according to Ben Stanley, populism itself is a product of &quot;an antagonistic relationship&quot; between &quot;the people&quot; and &quot;the elite&quot;, and is &quot;latent wherever the possibility occurs for the emergence of such a dichotomy&quot;. The political scientist Manuel Anselmi proposed that populism be defined as featuring a &quot;homogeneous community-people&quot; which &quot;perceives itself as the absolute holder of popular sovereignty&quot; and &quot;expresses an anti-establishment attitude.&quot; This understanding conceives of populism as a discourse, ideology, or worldview. These definitions were initially employed largely in Western Europe, although later became increasingly popular in Eastern Europe and the Americas.

According to this approach, populism is viewed as a &quot;thin ideology&quot; or &quot;thin-centred ideology&quot; which on its own is seen as too insubstantial to provide a blueprint for societal change. It thus differs from the &quot;thick-centred&quot; or &quot;full&quot; ideologies such as fascism, liberalism, and socialism, which provide more far-reaching ideas about social transformation. As a thin-centred ideology, populism is therefore attached to a thick-ideology by populist politicians. Thus, populism can be found merged with forms of nationalism, liberalism, socialism, federalism, or conservatism. According to Stanley, &quot;the thinness of populism ensures that in practice it is a complementary ideology: it does not so much overlap with as diffuse itself throughout full ideologies.&quot;

Populism is, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, &quot;a kind of mental map through which individuals analyse and comprehend political reality&quot;.
Mudde noted that populism is &quot;moralistic rather than programmatic&quot;. It encourages a binary world-view in which everyone is divided into &quot;friends and foes&quot;, with the latter being regarded not just as people who have &quot;different priorities and values&quot; but as being fundamentally &quot;evil&quot;. In emphasising one&#x27;s purity against the corruption and immorality of &quot;the elite&quot;, from which &quot;the people&quot; must remain pure and untouched, populism prevents compromise between different groups.

The incredible rise in research and discussion about populism, both academic and social, stems largely from efforts by ideational scholars to place centre stage the significance of appeals to the &quot;people&quot; beyond ideological differences, and to conceptualise populism as a &quot;discursive&quot; phenomenon. Nevertheless, the ideational school&#x27;s approach to populism is problematic for the amount of substantive assumptions it imposes on how populism actually works as a discursive phenomenon, such as the idea that it is of a moral register, that vindications always refer to a homogeneous/pure people, or that it takes shape socially as an ideology. These assumptions can be counter-productive to the study of populism which has arguably become excessively conceptually deductive. Still, this does not mean we cannot come to a more minimal, formal definition of what populism is that can consensually group scholars and open up research to a broader scope, as indicated by Stavrakakis and De Cleen in defining populism as a type of discourse &quot;characterized by a people/elite distinction and the claim to speak in the name of &#x27;the people&#x27;&quot;.

===Right and left-wing===

As a result of the various different ideologies with which populism can be paired, the forms that populism can take vary widely. Populism itself cannot be positioned on the left–right political spectrum, and both right and left-wing populisms exist. Populist movements can also mix divisions between left and right, for instance by combining xenophobic attitudes commonly associated with the far-right with redistributive economic policies closer to those of the left.

The ideologies with which populism can be paired can be contradictory, resulting in different forms of populism that can oppose each other. For instance, in Latin America during the 1990s, populism was often associated with politicians like Peru&#x27;s Alberto Fujimori who promoted neoliberal economics, while in the 2000s it was instead associated with those like Venezuela&#x27;s Hugo Chávez who promoted socialist programs. As well as populists of the left and right, populist figures like Italy&#x27;s Beppe Grillo have been characterised as centrist and liberal, while groups like Turkey&#x27;s Justice and Development Party have been described as combining populism with Islamism, and India&#x27;s Bharatiya Janata Party has been seen as mixing populism with Hindu nationalism. Although populists of different ideological traditions can oppose each other, they can also form coalitions, as was seen in the Greek coalition government which brought together the left-wing populist Syriza and the right-wing populist Independent Greeks in 2015.

Adherents of the ideational definition have also drawn a distinction between left and right-wing populists. The latter are presented as juxtaposing &quot;the people&quot; against both &quot;the elite&quot; and an additional group who are also regarded as being separate from &quot;the people&quot; and whom &quot;the elite&quot; is seen to favour, such as immigrants, homosexuals, travellers, or communists.
Populist leaders thus &quot;come in many different shades and sizes&quot; but, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, share one common element: &quot;a carefully crafted image of the &quot;vox populi&quot;&quot;. Stanley expressed the view that although there are &quot;certain family resemblances&quot; that can be seen between populist groups and individuals, there was &quot;no coherent tradition&quot; unifying all of them.
While many left-wing parties in the early 20th century presented themselves as the vanguard of the proletariat, by the early 21st century left-wing populists were presenting themselves as the &quot;voice of the people&quot; more widely. On the political right, populism is often combined with nationalism, with &quot;the people&quot; and &quot;the nation&quot; becoming fairly interchangeable categories in their discourse, or combined with religion where &quot;the people&quot; are identified based on religion.
Some political scientists have also argued that populism can be divided into left-wing inclusionary and right-wing exclusionary forms, though some argue against a dichotomy between inclusionary and exclusionary forms, such as right-wing populists welcoming culturally proximate migrants with transnational solidarity.

===&quot;The people&quot;===

For populists, &quot;the people&quot; are presented as being homogeneous, and also virtuous. In simplifying the complexities of reality, the concept of &quot;the people&quot; is vague and flexible, with this plasticity benefitting populists who are thus able to &quot;expand or contract&quot; the concept &quot;to suit the chosen criteria of inclusion or exclusion&quot; at any given time. In employing the concept of &quot;the people&quot;, populists can encourage a sense of shared identity among different groups within a society and facilitate their mobilisation toward a common cause. One of the ways that populists employ the understanding of &quot;the people&quot; is in the idea that &quot;the people are sovereign&quot;, that in a democratic state governmental decisions should rest with the population and that if they are ignored then they might mobilise or revolt. This is the sense of &quot;the people&quot; employed in the late 19th century United States by the People&#x27;s Party and which has also been used by later populist movements in that country.

A second way in which &quot;the people&quot; is conceived by populists combines a socioeconomic or class based category with one that refers to certain cultural traditions and popular values. The concept seeks to vindicate the dignity of a social group who regard themselves as being oppressed by a dominant &quot;elite&quot; who are accused of treating &quot;the people&#x27;s&quot; values, judgements, and tastes with suspicion or contempt. A third use of &quot;the people&quot; by populists employs it as a synonym for &quot;the nation&quot;, whether that national community be conceived in either ethnic or civic terms. In such a framework, all individuals regarded as being &quot;native&quot; to a particular state, either by birth or by ethnicity, could be considered part of &quot;the people&quot;.

Populism typically entails &quot;celebrating them the people&quot;, in Stanley&#x27;s words.
The political scientist Paul Taggart proposed the term &quot;the heartland&quot; to better reflect what populists often mean in their rhetoric. According to Taggart, &quot;the heartland&quot; was the place &quot;in which, in the populist imagination, a virtuous and unified population resides&quot;. Who this &quot;heartland&quot; is can vary between populists, even within the same country. For instance, in Britain, the centre-right Conservative Party conceived of &quot;Middle England&quot; as its heartland, while the far-right British National Party conceived of the &quot;native British people&quot; as its heartland. Mudde noted that for populists, &quot;the people&quot; &quot;are neither real nor all-inclusive, but are in fact a mythical and constructed sub-set of the whole population&quot;. They are an imagined community, much like the imagined communities embraced and promoted by nationalists.

Populism often entails presenting &quot;the people&quot; as the underdog. Populists typically seek to reveal to &quot;the people&quot; how they are oppressed. In doing so, they do not seek to change &quot;the people&quot;, but rather seek to preserve the latter&#x27;s &quot;way of life&quot; as it presently exists, regarding it as a source of good. For populists, the way of life of &quot;the people&quot; is presented as being rooted in history and tradition and regarded as being conducive to public good. Although populist leaders often present themselves as representatives of &quot;the people&quot;, they often come from elite strata in society; examples like Berlusconi, Fortuyn, and Haider were all well-connected to their country&#x27;s political and economic elites.

Populism can also be subdivided into &quot;inclusionary&quot; and &quot;exclusionary&quot; forms, which differ in their conceptions of who &quot;the people&quot; are. Inclusionary populism tends to define &quot;the people&quot; more broadly, accepting and advocating for minority and marginalised groups, while exclusionary populism defines &quot;the people&quot; in a much stricter sense, generally being focused on a particular sociocultural group and antagonistic against minority groups. However, this is not exactly a pure dichotomy—exclusive populists can still give voice to those who feel marginalised by the political status quo and include minorities if it is advantageous, while inclusive populists can vary significantly in how inclusive they actually are. In addition, all populisms are implicitly exclusionary, since they define &quot;the people&quot; against &quot;the elite&quot;, thus some scholars argue that the difference between populisms is not whether a particular populism excludes but whom it excludes from its conception of &quot;the people&quot;.

===&quot;The elite&quot;===

Anti-elitism is widely considered the central characteristic feature of populism, although Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argued that anti-elitism alone was not evidence of populism. Rather, according to Stanley, in populist discourse the &quot;fundamental distinguishing feature&quot; of &quot;the elite&quot; is that it is in an &quot;adversarial relationship&quot; with &quot;the people&quot;. In defining &quot;the elite&quot;, populists often condemn not only the political establishment, but also the economic elite, cultural elite, academic elite, and the media elite, which they present as one homogeneous, corrupt group. In early 21st century India, the populist Bharatiya Janata Party for instance accused the dominant Indian National Congress party, the Communist Party of India, NGOs, academia, and the English-language media of all being part of &quot;the elite&quot;.

When operating in liberal democracies, populists often condemn dominant political parties as part of &quot;the elite&quot; but at the same time do not reject the party political system altogether, instead either calling for or claiming to be a new kind of party different from the others. Although condemning almost all those in positions of power within a given society, populists often exclude both themselves and those sympathetic to their cause even when they too are in positions of power. For instance, the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), a right-wing populist group, regularly condemned &quot;the media&quot; in Austria for defending &quot;the elite&quot;, but excluded from that the &quot;Kronen Zeitung&quot;, a widely read tabloid that supported the FPÖ and its leader Jörg Haider.

When populists take governmental power, they are faced with a challenge in that they now represent a new elite. In such cases—like Chávez in Venezuela and Vladimír Mečiar in Slovakia—populists retain their anti-establishment rhetoric by making changes to their concept of &quot;the elite&quot; to suit their new circumstances, alleging that real power is not held by the government but other powerful forces who continue to undermine the populist government and the will of &quot;the people&quot; itself. In these instances, populist governments often conceptualise &quot;the elite&quot; as those holding economic power. In Venezuela, for example, Chávez blamed the economic elite for frustrating his reforms, while in Greece, the left-wing populist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras accused &quot;the lobbyists and oligarchs of Greece&quot; of undermining his administration. In populist instances like these, the claims made have some basis in reality, as business interests seek to undermine leftist-oriented economic reform.

Although left-wing populists who combine populist ideas with forms of socialism most commonly present &quot;the elite&quot; in economic terms, the same strategy is also employed by some right-wing populists. In the United States during the late 2000s, the Tea Party movement—which presented itself as a defender of the capitalist free market—argued that big business, and its allies in Congress, seeks to undermine the free market and kill competition by stifling small business. Among some 21st century right-wing populists, &quot;the elite&quot; are presented as being left-wing radicals committed to political correctness. The Dutch right-wing populist leader Pim Fortuyn referred to this as the &quot;Church of the Left&quot;.

In some instances, particularly in Latin America and Africa, &quot;the elites&quot; are conceived not just in economic but also in ethnic terms, representing what political scientists have termed ethnopopulism. In Bolivia, for example, the left-wing populist leader Evo Morales juxtaposed the mestizo and indigenous &quot;people&quot; against an overwhelmingly European &quot;elite&quot;, declaring that &quot;We Indians [i.e. indigenous people] are Latin America&#x27;s moral reserve&quot;. In the Bolivian case, this was not accompanied by a racially exclusionary approach, but with an attempt to build a pan-ethnic coalition which included European Bolivians against the largely European Bolivian elite. In South Africa, the populist Julius Malema has presented black South Africans as the &quot;people&quot; whom he claims to represent, calling for the expropriation of land owned by the white minority without compensation. In areas like Europe where nation-states are more ethnically homogeneous, this ethnopopulist approach is rare given that the &quot;people&quot; and &quot;elite&quot; are typically of the same ethnicity.

For some populist leaders and movements, the term &quot;the elite&quot; also refers to an academic or intellectual establishment and, as such, entails scholars, intellectuals, experts, or organized science as a whole. Such leaders and movements may criticise scientific knowledge as abstract, useless, and ideologically biased, and instead demand common sense, experiential knowledge, and practical solutions to be &quot;true knowledge&quot;.

In various instances, populists claim that &quot;the elite&quot; is working against the interests of the country. In the European Union (EU), for instance, various populist groups allege that their national political elites put the interests of the EU itself over those of their own nation-states. Similarly, in Latin America populists often charge political elites with championing the interests of the United States over those of their own countries.

Another common tactic among populists, particularly in Europe, is the accusation that &quot;the elites&quot; place the interests of immigrants above those of the native population. The Zambian populist Michael Sata for instance adopted a xenophobic stance during his campaigns by focusing his criticism on the country&#x27;s Asian minority, decrying Chinese and Indian ownership of businesses and mines. In India, the right-wing populist leader Narendra Modi rallied supporters against Muslim Bangladeshi migrants, promising to deport them. In instances where populists are also antisemitic (such as Jobbik in Hungary and Attack in Bulgaria) the elites are accused of favouring Israeli and wider Jewish interests above those of the national group. Antisemitic populists often accuse &quot;the elite&quot; of being made up of many Jews as well. When populists emphasise ethnicity as part of their discourse, &quot;the elite&quot; can sometimes be presented as &quot;ethnic traitors&quot;.

===General will===

A third component of the ideational approach to populism is the idea of the general will, or &quot;volonté générale&quot;. An example of this populist understanding of the general will can be seen in Chávez&#x27;s 2007 inaugural address, when he stated that &quot;All individuals are subject to error and seduction, but not the people, which possesses to an eminent degree of consciousness of its own good and the measure of its independence. Because of that its judgement is pure, its will is strong, and none can corrupt or even threaten it.&quot; For populists, the general will of &quot;the people&quot; is something that should take precedence over the preferences of &quot;the elite&quot;.

As noted by Stanley, the populist idea of the general will is connected to ideas of majoritarianism and authenticity. Highlighting how populists appeal to the ideals of &quot;authenticity and ordinariness&quot;, he noted that what was most important to populists was &quot;to appeal to the of an authentic people&quot; and to cultivate the idea that they are the &quot;genuine&quot; representatives of &quot;the people&quot;. In doing so they often emphasise their physical proximity to &quot;the people&quot; and their distance from &quot;the elites&quot;.
Sheri Berman notes that while populists often engage in democratic rhetoric, they frequently ignore or devalue norms of liberal democracy such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, legitimate opposition, separation of powers and constraints on presidential power.

In emphasising the general will, many populists share the critique of representative democratic government previously espoused by the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. This approach regards representative governance as an aristocratic and elitist system in which a country&#x27;s citizens are regarded as passive entities. Rather than choosing laws for themselves, these citizens are only mobilised for elections in which their only option is to select their representatives rather than taking a more direct role in legislation and governance. Populists often favour the use of direct democratic measures such as referendums and plebiscites. For this reason, Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that &quot;it can be argued that an elective affinity exists between populism and direct democracy&quot;, although Stanley cautioned that &quot;support for direct democracy is not an essential attribute of populism.&quot; Populist notions of the &quot;general will&quot; and its links with populist leaders are usually based on the idea of &quot;common sense&quot;.

===Versus elitism and pluralism===

Stanley noted that rather than being restricted purely to populists, appeals to &quot;the people&quot; had become &quot;an unavoidable aspect of modern political practice&quot;, with elections and referendums predicated on the notion that &quot;the people&quot; decide the outcome. Thus, a critique of the ideational definition of populism is that it becomes too broad and can potentially apply to all political actors and movements. Responding to this critique, Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argued that the ideational definition did allow for a &quot;non-populism&quot; in the form of both elitism and pluralism.

Elitists share the populist binary division but reverse the associations. Whereas populists regard the elites as bad and the common people as good, elitists view &quot;the people&quot; as being vulgar, immoral, and dangerous and &quot;the elites&quot; as being morally, culturally, and intellectually superior. Elitists want politics to be largely or entirely an elite affair; some—such as Spain&#x27;s Francisco Franco and Chile&#x27;s Augusto Pinochet—reject democracy altogether, while others—like Spain&#x27;s José Ortega y Gasset and Austria&#x27;s Joseph Schumpeter—support a limited model of democracy.

Pluralism differs from both elitism and populism by rejecting any dualist framework, instead viewing society as a broad array of overlapping social groups, each with their own ideas and interests. Pluralists argue that political power should not be held by any single group—whether defined by their gender, ethnicity, economic status, or political party membership—and should instead be distributed. Pluralists encourage governance through compromise and consensus in order to reflect the interests of as many of these groups as possible. Unlike populists, pluralists do not believe that such a thing as a &quot;general will&quot; exists. Some politicians do not seek to demonise a social elite; for many conservatives for example, the social elite are regarded as the bulwark of the traditional social order, while for some liberals, the social elite are perceived as an enlightened legislative and administrative cadre.

==Other definitions==

The popular agency definition to populism uses the term in reference to a democratic way of life that is built on the popular engagement of the population in political activity. In this understanding, populism is usually perceived as a positive factor in the mobilisation of the populace to develop a communitarian form of democracy. This approach to the term is common among historians in the United States and those who have studied the late 19th century People&#x27;s Party.

The Laclauan definition of populism, so called after the Argentinian political theorist Ernesto Laclau who developed it, uses the term in reference to what proponents regard as an emancipatory force that is the essence of politics. In this concept of populism, it is believed to mobilise excluded sectors of society against dominant elites and changing the status quo. Laclau&#x27;s initial emphasis was on class antagonisms arising between different classes, although he later altered his perspective to claim that populist discourses could arise from any part of the socio-institutional structure. For Laclau, socialism was &quot;the highest form of populism&quot;. His understandings of the topic derived in large part from his focus on politics in Latin America. This definition is popular among critics of liberal democracy and is widely used in critical studies and in studies of West European and Latin American politics. Harry C. Boyte for example defined populism as &quot;a politics of civic agency&quot; which &quot;develops the power of &#x27;the people&#x27; to shape their destiny&quot;, as examples citing both the Russian narodniks and the South African Black Consciousness Movement. Highlighting parallels between Laclau’s concept of populism and E.P. Thompson’s notion of &#x27;moral economy,&#x27; Norbert Götz and Emilia Palonen identify the affective dimension, parochialism, and disregard for third parties as key shared features of both frameworks.

The socioeconomic definition of populism applies the term to what it regards as an irresponsible form of economic policy by which a government engages in a period of massive public spending financed by foreign loans, after which the country falls into hyperinflation and harsh economic adjustments are then imposed. This use of the term was used by economists like Rudiger Dornbusch and Jeffrey Sachs and was particularly popular among scholars of Latin America during the 1980s and 1990s. Since that time, this definition continued to be used by some economists and journalists, particularly in the US, but was uncommon among other social sciences. This definition relies on focusing on socialist and other left-wing forms of populism; it does not apply to other groups commonly understood as populist which adopted right-wing stances on economic issues.

An additional framework has been described as the &quot;political-strategic&quot; approach. This applies the term &quot;populism&quot; to a political strategy in which a charismatic leader seeks to govern based on direct and unmediated connection with their followers. Kurt Weyland defined this conception of &quot;populism&quot; as &quot;a political strategy through which a personalist leader seeks or exercises government power based on direct, unmediated, uninstitutionalized support from large numbers of mostly unorganized followers&quot;. This is a definition of the term that is popular among scholars of non-Western societies. By focusing on leadership, this concept of &quot;populism&quot; does not allow for the existence of populist parties or populist social movements; under this definition, for instance, the US People&#x27;s Party which first invented the term &quot;populism&quot; could not be considered populist. Mudde suggested that although the idea of a leader having direct access to &quot;the people&quot; was a common element among populists, it is best regarded as a feature which facilitates rather than defines populism.

In popular discourse, &quot;populism&quot; is sometimes used in a negative sense in reference to politics which involves promoting extremely simple solutions to complex problems in a highly emotional manner. Mudde suggested that this definition &quot;seems to have instinctive value&quot; but was difficult to employ empirically because almost all political groups engage in sloganeering and because it can be difficult to differentiate an argument made emotionally from one made rationally. Mudde thought that this phenomenon was better termed &quot;demagogy&quot; rather than &quot;populism&quot;. Another use of the term in popular discourse is to describe opportunistic policies designed to quickly please voters rather than deciding a more rational course of action. Examples of this would include a governing political party lowering taxes before an election or promising to provide things to the electorate which the state cannot afford to pay for. Mudde suggested that this phenomenon is better described as &quot;opportunism&quot; rather than &quot;populism&quot;.

Another way of defining populism is by defining it as a political style. Benjamin Moffitt states that political style can be defined as &quot;the repertoires of embodied, symbolically mediated performance made to audiences that are used to create and navigate the fields of power that comprise the political, stretching from the domain of government through to everyday life&quot;. This definition acknowledges that populism includes both rhetorical aspects such as gestures and body language, spoken language, argumentation while also acknowledging that populism includes aesthetic aspects such as fashion, self-presentation, images, and designs. This definition also acknowledges that political performances are constructed. Moffitt argues that an ideational approach doesn&#x27;t include the emphasis of performative elements while political style does. In addition, populism cannot be considered an ideology because it doesn&#x27;t consist of specific ideas or ideals related to economic or political theory and policy. Populism as a political style is only concerned with the way that political ideas are presented and performed. According to Moffitt, this is why populism can appear across a number of different ideological spectrums on the left and right. Populism has no political ideology; it is only a political style.

Moffitt notes that populism as a political style has certain features which define it. The first of these features is &quot;the people&quot; versus &quot;the elite&quot;. Moffitt acknowledges that the &quot;dichotomic division of society between &#x27;the people&#x27; and &#x27;the elite&#x27;&quot; is one of the most popular definitions of populism but is only one of the features of populism as a political style. The second feature of populism as a political style is the use of &quot;bad manners&quot;, consisting of, &quot;slang, swearing, political incorrectness, and being over demonstrative and &#x27;colorful&#x27;, as opposed to the &#x27;high&#x27; behaviors of rigidness, rationality, composure and use of technocratic language&quot;. The third feature of populism as a political style is crisis, breakdown, or threat. This is the exigence that populists use. Moffitt writes that, &quot;Crises are often related to the breakdown between citizens and their representatives, but can also be related to immigration, economic difficulties, perceived injustice, military threat, social change or other issues.&quot; This performance relates to a distrust of deliberation, negotiation, consultations, reviews, reports, and the complicated nature of designing policy solutions.

There are multiple implications for populism being understood as a political style. The first implication that Moffitt points out is that populism as a political style allows people to understand why populism doesn’t adhere to the common left/right ideological spectrum. Populism is not a political ideology; it is just a way to present ideas through both rhetorical and aesthetic aspects. In addition, populism as a political style means that populism no longer has to be conceptualized as a binary category but can instead be conceptualized as a gradational concept. This means that populist actors can, depending on the time, be more or less populist. However, this means that there has to be an opposite political style to populism. Moffitt notes that the opposing political style to populism is a technocratic political style. In contrast with appeal to &quot;the people&quot; vs. &quot;the elite&quot;, &quot;bad manners&quot;, and the exigence of a crisis, breakdown threat, the technocratic political style emphasizes appeal to expertise, &quot;good manners&quot;, and stability and progress. This distinction between these two political styles allows political actors to be plotted on a scale rather than being seen as populist or not. It also allows for the scale to be adjusted in relation to different political elections in different years due to the fact that populists might not always utilize the populist political style to the same extent as they did in years prior.

== Demand-side factors ==
One area of debate in explaining populism is whether its main cause is based in the needs of citizens (demand-side explanations) or in the failures of governments (supply-side explanations). In focusing on the changing grievances or demands of citizens, demand-side explanations can be seen as bottom-up explanations, while supply-side explanations, in focusing on political actors and institutions, can be seen as top-down explanations. Various demand-side factors have been claimed to make it more likely that individuals will support populist ideas. Economists and political economists often emphasize the importance of economic concerns while political scientists and sociologists often emphasize sociocultural concerns in their analysis of demand-side factors.

=== Economic grievance ===
The economic grievance thesis argues that economic factors, such as deindustrialisation, economic liberalisation, and deregulation, are causing the formation of a &#x27;left-behind&#x27; precariat with low job security, high inequality, and wage stagnation, who then support populism. Some theories only focus on the effect of economic crises, or inequality. Another objection for economic reasons is due to the globalization that is taking place in the world today. In addition to criticism of the widening inequality caused by the elite, the widening inequality among the general public caused by the influx of immigrants and other factors due to globalization is also a target of populist criticism.

The evidence of increasing economic disparity and volatility of family incomes is clear, particularly in the United States, as shown by the work of Thomas Piketty and others. Commentators such as Martin Wolf emphasize the importance of economics. They warn that such trends increase resentment and make people susceptible to populist rhetoric. Evidence for this is mixed. At the macro level, political scientists report that xenophobia, anti-immigrant ideas, and resentment towards out-groups tend to be higher during difficult economic times. Economic crises have been associated with gains by far-right political parties. However, there is little evidence at the micro- or individual level to link individual economic grievances and populist support. Populist politicians tend to put pressure on central bank independence.

=== Modernisation ===
The modernisation losers theory argues that certain aspects of transition to modernity have caused demand for populism. Some arguments rely on the belief that anomie has followed industrialisation and resulted in &quot;dissolution, fragmentation and differentiation&quot;, weakening the traditional ties of civil society, and increasing individualization. Populism offers a broad identity which gives sovereignty to the previously marginalized masses as &quot;the people&quot;. However, empirical studies suggest that supporters of radical right-wing populism occur across the social spectrum, and are not more likely to appear in groups defined as &quot;modernisation losers&quot;.

=== Cultural backlash ===
Other theories argue that grievances have a primarily sociocultural rather than an economic basis. For example, the cultural backlash thesis argues that right-wing populism is reaction to the rise of postmaterialism in many developed countries, including the spread of feminism, multiculturalism, and environmentalism. According to this view, the spread of ideas and values through a society challenges accepted norms until society reaches a &#x27;tipping point&#x27;, which causes a reaction, in this case support for right-wing populism. Some theories limit this argument to being a reaction to just the increase of ethnic diversity from immigration. Such theories are particularly popular with sociologists and with political scientists studying industrial world and American politics.

The empiric studies testing this theory have produced highly contradicting results.
At the micro- or individual level, there are strong connections between individual positions on sociocultural issues (such as immigration policy and &quot;racial animus&quot;) and right-wing populist voting. However, at the macro level, studies have not shown clear relationships between measures of populist sentiment in countries and actual right-wing party support.

However, there is strong evidence from political scientists and political psychologists documenting the influence of group-based identity threats on voters. Those who identify as part of a group and perceive it as being under threat are likely to support political actors who promise to protect the status and identity of their group. While such research often focuses on white identity, results apply broadly to other social groups that perceive themselves to be under threat.

=== Recent democratization ===
The length of time since a country has been democratized has also been linked to its potential for populist success. This is claimed to be because younger democracies have less established political parties and weaker liberal democratic norms. For example, populist success in Eastern Europe has been linked to the legacy of communism. However, this explanation suffers from the lack of success of populism in most post-communist countries.

== Supply-side factors ==
Supply-side explanations focus on political actors and institutions and the ways in which governments may fail to respond to the changing conditions that affect citizens. Economic, social, and other structural trends are seen as being modified by institutions as they determine political outcomes. In this view, citizens turn to populism when governments do not respond effectively to the challenges they and their citizens face. Research supports the idea that populism is more likely to thrive when mainstream parties on the center-left and center-right do not address important contemporary issues and do not offer clear alternatives to voters. Coalitions that blur distinctions on positions are also likely to increase populism.

In &quot;Political Order in Changing Societies&quot; (1968), Samuel P. Huntington argues that rapid change (social or economic) in a society will increase the demands of its citizens. Unless political institutions are responsive and effective, they are unlikely to respond to and satisfy such demands. If political systems are weak or have become unresponsive over time, then dissatisfaction, political disorder and even violence become more likely. Political institutions that do not respond to social and economic changes are likely to fail. Responsive political systems can adapt to more severe challenges than unresponsive ones. Huntington&#x27;s ideas grew out of work on Third World countries, but are also applicable to advanced industrial countries.

In a supply-side view of American politics, populism can be seen as a symptom of institutional decay. It can be suggested that political factors such as gerrymandering, the Electoral College, special-interest lobbying and dark money, are distorting political and economic debate, and decreasing the ability of the government to respond to the concerns of large numbers of citizens. This in turn generates dissatisfaction, which may increase the likelihood that citizens will support populism. Scholars studying the European Union have suggested that European integration may have had the undesired effect of decreasing the system&#x27;s responsiveness to voters, as law and policy-making increasingly became the responsibility of the European Union. This too may have increased support for populism. Institutions such as the European Central Bank may also distance decision-making from electoral power. It has been argued that political parties themselves have become disconnected from society, and unable to respond to citizen&#x27;s concerns.
== Voluntarism ==
Another underlying debate in discussions of populism is the comparison of structural and voluntarist approaches. Voluntarist or agency-based explanations focus on the behaviors of politicians and parties, including populists themselves.

An important area of research is the examination of how parties develop, and how responses to new parties shape them. Successful politicians and parties shape the formation of agendas, identifying and increasing the salience of issues which they believe will benefit them.

Established parties may adopt various strategies when a new party appears: dismissive, adversarial, or accommodative. A dismissive strategy such as ignoring a party and its issue(s) can only be effective if the issue involved is unimportant or short-lived. Otherwise, dismissing an issue leaves ownership of the issue with the new party and allows them to attract any voters who see the issue as important. In an adversarial response, a mainstream party directly engages over an issue, emphasizing their opposition to the new party&#x27;s position. This increases the issue&#x27;s visibility, makes it a focus of ongoing political debate, and can reinforce the new party&#x27;s ownership of it.

An adversarial response can be to the benefit of a mainstream party if most voters, or at least the mainstream party&#x27;s voters, disagree with the new party&#x27;s position and are unlikely to ally with it as a result.
An accommodative strategy is to move the mainstream party closer to the position advocated by the new party, in hopes of retaining voters who care about the issue. This works best if adopted early, before a new party is heavily identified with an issue. If an issue is important, long-lived and of strong interest to its supporters, a mainstream party can benefit from quickly shifting its position to one closer to the new party.

Similarly, a populist party with neo-fascist or antidemocratic roots may be able to increase its support by moderating its views to a milder form of its original position (e.g. from neofascist to xenophobic.) Right-wing populists are more effective in mobilizing voters around issues when mainstream parties ignore the issue or offer alternatives that are not aligned with voter opinions. They are also more likely to benefit from emphasizing social and cultural issues such as immigration and race, appealing to voters who are positioned economically towards the left-wing but hold socially conservative views.

==Mobilisation==

There are three forms of political mobilisation which populists have adopted: that of the populist leader, the populist political party, and the populist social movement. The reasons why voters are attracted to populists differ, but common catalysts for the rise of populists include dramatic economic decline or a systematic corruption scandal that damages established political parties. For instance, the Great Recession of 2007 and its impact on the economies of southern Europe was a catalyst for the rise of Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain, while the &quot;Mani pulite&quot; corruption scandal of the early 1990s played a significant part in the rise of the Italian populist Silvio Berlusconi.

Another catalyst for the growth of populism is a widespread perception among voters that the political system is unresponsive to them. This can arise when elected governments introduce policies that are unpopular with their voters but which are implemented because they are considered to be &quot;responsible&quot; or imposed by supranational organisations. In Latin America, for example, many countries passed unpopular economic reforms under pressure from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank while in Europe, many countries in the European Union were pushed to implement unpopular economic austerity measures by the union&#x27;s authorities. Decentralisation of political power is a very useful tool for populists to use to their benefit, this is because it allows them to speak more directly to the people of whom they seek to gain attention and votes.

===Leaders===

Populism is often associated with charismatic and dominant leaders, and the populist leader is, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, &quot;the quintessential form of populist mobilization&quot;. These individuals campaign and attract support on the basis of their own personal appeal. Their supporters then develop a perceived personal connection with the leader. For these leaders, populist rhetoric allows them to claim that they have a direct relationship with &quot;the people&quot;, and in many cases they claim to be a personification of &quot;the people&quot; themselves, presenting themselves as the &quot;vox populi&quot; or &quot;voice of the people&quot;. Hugo Chávez for instance stated: &quot;I demand absolute loyalty to me. I am not an individual, I am the people.&quot; Populist leaders can also present themselves as the saviour of the people because of their perceived unique talents and vision, and in doing so can claim to be making personal sacrifices for the good of the people. Because loyalty to the populist leader is thus seen as representing loyalty to the people, those who oppose the leader can be branded &quot;enemies of the people&quot;.

The overwhelming majority of populist leaders have been men, although there have been various females occupying this role. Most of these female populist leaders gained positions of seniority through their connections to previously dominant men; Eva Perón was the wife of Juan Perón, Marine Le Pen the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, Keiko Fujimori the daughter of Alberto Fujimori, and Yingluck Shinawatra the sister of Thaksin Shinawatra.

====Rhetorical styles====

Canovan noted that populists often used &quot;colourful and undiplomatic language&quot; to distinguish themselves from the governing elite. In Africa, several populist leaders have distinguished themselves by speaking in indigenous languages rather than either French or English. Populist leaders often present themselves as people of action rather than people of words, talking of the need for &quot;bold action&quot; and &quot;common sense solutions&quot; to issues which they call &quot;crises&quot;. Male populist leaders often express themselves using simple and sometimes vulgar language in an attempt to present themselves as &quot;the common man&quot; or &quot;one of the boys&quot; to add to their populist appeal.

An example of this is Umberto Bossi, the leader of the right-wing populist Italian Lega Nord, who at rallies would state &quot;the League has a hard-on&quot; while putting his middle-finger up as a sign of disrespect to the government in Rome. Another recurring feature of male populist leaders is the emphasis that they place on their own virility. An example of this is the Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who bragged about his bunga bunga sex parties and his ability to seduce young women. Among female populist leaders, it is more common for them to emphasise their role as a wife and mother. The US right-wing populist Sarah Palin for instance referred to herself as a &quot;hockey mom&quot; and a &quot;mama grizzly&quot;, while Australian right-wing populist Pauline Hanson stated that &quot;I care so passionately about this country, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m its mother. Australia is my home and the Australian people are my children.&quot;

Populist leaders typically portray themselves as outsiders who are separate from the &quot;elite&quot;. Female populist leaders sometimes reference their gender as setting them apart from the dominant &quot;old boys&#x27; club&quot;, while in Latin America a number of populists, such as Evo Morales and Alberto Fujimori, emphasised their non-white ethnic background to set them apart from the white-dominated elite. Other populists have used clothing to set them apart. In South Africa, the populist Julius Malema and members of his Economic Freedom Fighters attended parliament dressed as miners and workers to distinguish themselves from the other politicians wearing suits. In instances where wealthy business figures promote populist sentiments, such as Ross Perot, Thaksin Shinawatra, or Berlusconi, it can be difficult to present themselves as being outside the elite, however this is achieved by portraying themselves as being apart from the political, if not the economic elite, and portraying themselves as reluctant politicians.
Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser noted that &quot;in reality, most populist leaders are very much part of the national elite&quot;, typically being highly educated, upper-middle class, middle-aged males from the majority ethnicity.

Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that &quot;true outsiders&quot; to the political system are rare, although cited instances like Venezuela&#x27;s Chávez and Peru&#x27;s Fujimori. More common is that they are &quot;insider-outsiders&quot;, strongly connected to the inner circles of government but not having ever been part of it. The Dutch right-wing populist Geert Wilders had for example been a prominent back-bench MP for many years before launching his populist Party for Freedom, while in South Africa, Malema had been leader of the governing African National Congress (ANC) youth league until he was expelled, at which he launched his own populist movement. Only a few populist leaders are &quot;insiders&quot;, individuals who have held leading roles in government prior to portraying themselves as populists. One example is Thaksin Shinawatra, who was twice deputy prime minister of Thailand before launching his own populist political party; another is Rafael Correa, who served as the Ecuadorean finance minister before launching a left-wing populist challenge.

Populist leaders are sometimes also characterised as strongmen or—in Latin American countries—as caudillos. In a number of cases, such as Argentina&#x27;s Perón or Venezuela&#x27;s Chávez, these leaders have military backgrounds which contribute to their strongman image.
Other populist leaders have also evoked the strongman image without having a military background; these include Italy&#x27;s Berlusconi, Slovakia&#x27;s Mečiar, and Thailand&#x27;s Thaksin Shinawatra.
Populism and strongmen are not intrinsically connected, however; as stressed by Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, &quot;only a minority of strongmen are populists and only a minority of populists is a strongman&quot;. Rather than being populists, many strongmen—such as Spain&#x27;s Francisco Franco—were elitists who led authoritarian administrations.

In most cases, these populist leaders built a political organisation around themselves, typically a political party, although in many instances these remain dominated by the leader. These individuals often give a populist movement its political identity, as is seen with movements like Fortuynism in the Netherlands, Peronism in Argentina, Berlusconism in Italy and Chavismo in Venezuela. Populist mobilisation is not however always linked to a charismatic leadership. Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that populist personalist leadership was more common in countries with a presidential system rather than a parliamentary one because these allow for the election of a single individual to the role of head of government without the need for an accompanying party. Examples where a populist leader has been elected to the presidency without an accompanying political party have included Peron in Argentina, Fujimori in Peru, and Correa in Ecuador.

==== Media ====

A subset of populism which deals with the use of media by politicians is called &quot;media populism&quot;.

Populist leaders often use the media in order to mobilize their support. In Latin America, there is a long tradition of using mass media as a way for charismatic leaders to directly communicate with the poorly educated masses, first by radio and then by television. The former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez had a weekly show called &quot;Aló Presidente&quot;, which according to historian Enrique Krauze gave some Venezuelans &quot;at least the appearance of contact with power, through his verbal and visual presence, which may be welcomed by people who have spent most of their lives being ignored.&quot;

The media has also been argued to have helped populists in countries of other regions by giving exposure to the most controversial politicians for commercial reasons. Donald Trump was claimed to have received $5 billion worth of free coverage during his 2016 campaign. Tabloids are often stereotyped as presenting a platform for populist politics due to their tendency toward melodrama, infotainment, and conflict, and thus provide support for populist parties. Examples of this have been the support given by &quot;Kronen Zeitung&quot; to the Austrian Freedom Party and the Berlusconi-owned presses&#x27; support for Italy&#x27;s National Alliance in the mid-1990s. Based on his analysis of Dutch and British media, Tjitske Akkerman however argued that tabloids were no more prone to populism than the quality press.

In the 21st century, populists have increasingly used social media to bypass the mainstream media and directly approach their target audiences. In earlier periods, before radio, thought &quot;mass media&quot; newspapers tended to operate more like social media than modern newspapers, publishing local gossip and with little fact-checking; the expansion of newspapers to rural areas of the United States in the early twentieth century increased support for populist parties and positions. It has been claimed that while traditional media, acting as so-called &#x27;gatekeepers&#x27;, filter the messages that they broadcast through journalistic norms, social media permits a &#x27;direct linkage&#x27; from political actors to potential audiences. It has been claimed that the use of Twitter helped Donald Trump win the US presidency, while the same has been claimed regarding the use of YouTube by the Jair Bolsonaro 2018 presidential campaign.

==== Electoral systems ====
Political systems with low political efficacy or high wasted votes can contribute to populism. Populist leaders have been claimed to be more successful in presidential systems. This is because such systems give advantage to charismatic populist leaders, especially when institutionalized parties are weak. This is especially the case in two-round systems, because outsiders who might not win most votes in the first round of voting might be able to do so when faced against a mainstream candidate in the second round. This has been claimed to be evident in the 1990 Peruvian general election won by Alberto Fujimori, who lost on the first round. Furthermore, Juan José Linz has argued that the direct relationship between the president and the electorate fosters a populist perception of the president as representing the whole people and their opponents as resisting the popular will.

===Political parties===
Another form of mobilisation is through populist political parties. Populists are not generally opposed to political representation, but merely want their own representatives, those of &quot;the people&quot;, in power. In various cases, non-populist political parties have transitioned into populist ones; the elitist Socialist Unity Party of Germany, a Marxist–Leninist group which governed East Germany, later transitioned after German re-unification into a populist party, The Left. In other instances, such as the Austrian FPÖ and Swiss SVP, a non-populist party can have a populist faction which later takes control of the whole party.

In some examples where a political party has been dominated by a single charismatic leader, the latter&#x27;s death has served to unite and strengthen the party, as with Argentina&#x27;s Justicialist Party after Juan Perón&#x27;s death in 1974, or the United Socialist Party of Venezuela after Chávez&#x27;s death in 2013. In other cases, a populist party has seen one strong centralising leader replace another, as when Marine Le Pen replaced her father Jean-Marie as the leader of the National Front in 2011, or when Heinz-Christian Strache took over from Haider as chair of the Freedom Party of Austria in 2005.

Many populist parties achieve an electoral breakthrough but then fail to gain electoral persistence, with their success fading away at subsequent elections. In various cases, they are able to secure regional strongholds of support but with little support elsewhere in the country; the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ) for instance gained national representation in the Austrian parliament solely because of its strong support in Carinthia. Similarly, the Belgian Vlaams Belang party has its stronghold in Antwerp, while the Swiss People&#x27;s Party has its stronghold in Zürich.

===Social movements===

An additional form is that of the populist social movement. Populist social movements are comparatively rare, as most social movements focus on a more restricted social identity or issue rather than identifying with &quot;the people&quot; more broadly. However, after the Great Recession of 2007 a number of populist social movements emerged, expressing public frustrations with national and international economic systems. These included the Occupy movement, which originated in the US and used the slogan &quot;We are the 99%&quot;, and the Spanish Indignados movement, which employed the motto: &quot;real democracy now—we are not goods in the hands of politicians and bankers&quot;.

Few populist social movements survive for more than a few years, with most examples, like the Occupy movement, petering out after their initial growth. In some cases, the social movement fades away as a strong leader emerges from within it and moves into electoral politics. An example of this can be seen with the India Against Corruption social movement, from which emerged Arvind Kejriwal, who founded the Aam Aadmi Party (&quot;Common Man Party&quot;). Another is the Spanish Indignados movement which appeared in 2011 before spawning the Podemos party led by Pablo Iglesias Turrión. These populist social movements can exert a broader societal impact which results in populist politicians emerging to prominence; the Tea Party and Occupy movements that appeared in the US during the late 2000s and early 2010s have been seen as an influence on the rise of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders as prominent figures in the mid-2010s.

Some populist leaders have sought to broaden their support by creating supporter groups within the country. Chavez, for instance, ordered the formation of Bolivarian Circles, Communal Councils, Urban Land Committees, and Technical Water Roundtables across Venezuela. These could improve political participation among poorer sectors of Venezuelan society, although also served as networks through which the state transferred resources to those neighbourhoods which produced high rates of support for Chavez government.

==Other themes==
===Democracy===

Populism is a flexible term as it can be seen to exist in both democracies as well as authoritarian regimes. There have been intense debates about the relationship between populism and democracy. Some regard populism as being an intrinsic danger to democracy; others regard it as the only &quot;true&quot; form of democracy. Populists often present themselves as &quot;true democrats&quot;. It could be argued that populism is democratic as it allows voters to remove governments they do not approve via the ballot box because voting is an essential value for a state to be considered a democracy. Albertazzi and McDonnell stated that populism and democracy were &quot;inextricably linked&quot;, the political scientist Manuel Anselmi described populism as being &quot;deeply connected with democracy&quot;, and March suggested that populism represented a &quot;critique of democracy, not an alternative to it&quot;. Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser write that &quot;In a world that is dominated by democracy and liberalism, populism has essentially become an illiberal democratic response to undemocratic liberalism.&quot; Adamidis argues that the effect of populism on democracy can be measured by reference to its impact on the democratic legal systems and, in particular, to the changes it effects on their rule of recognition.

Populism can serve as a democratic corrective by contributing to the mobilisation of social groups who feel excluded from political decision making. It can also raise awareness among the socio-political elites of popular concerns in society, even if it makes the former uncomfortable. When some populists have taken power—most notably, Chávez in Venezuela—they have enhanced the use of direct democracy through the regular application of referendums. For this reason, some democratic politicians have argued that they need to become more populist: René Cuperus of the Dutch Labour Party for instance called for social democracy to become &quot;more &#x27;populist&#x27; in a leftist way&quot; in order to engage with voters who felt left behind by cultural and technological change.

Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argued that &quot;populism is essentially democratic, but at odds with democracy,&quot; since populism is based on putting into effect &quot;the will of the people&quot;. It is therefore majoritarian in nature, and opposed to the safeguarding of minority rights, which is a defining feature of liberal democracy. Populism also undermines the tenets of liberal democracy by rejecting notions of pluralism and the idea that anything, including constitutional limits, should constrain the &quot;general will&quot; of &quot;the people&quot;. In this, populist governance can lead to what the liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill described as the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;.

Populists tend to view democratic institutions as alienating, and in practice, populists operating in liberal democracies have often criticised the independent institutions designed to protect the fundamental rights of minorities, particularly the judiciary and the media. Berlusconi for instance criticised the Italian judiciary for defending the rights of communists. In countries like Hungary, Ecuador, and Venezuela, populist governments have curtailed the independent media. Minorities have often suffered as a result. In Europe in particular, ethnic minorities have had their rights undermined by populism, while in Latin America it is political opposition groups who have been undermined by populist governments.

In several instances—such as Orbán in Hungary—the populist leader has set the country on a path of de-democratisation by changing the constitution to centralise increasing levels of power in the head of government. A December 2018 study of 46 populist leaders argued that populists, regardless of their position on the political spectrum, were more likely to damage democratic institutions, erode checks and balances on the executive branch, cause democratic backsliding and attack individual rights than non-populists.
In contrast, an analysis of the V-Party Dataset demonstrates moderate levels of populism are not necessarily antidemocratic, only high levels of populism are related to higher autocratization.

Even when not elected into office, populist parties can have an impact in shaping the national political agenda; in Western Europe, parties like the French National Front and Danish People&#x27;s Party did not generally get more than 10 or 20% of the national vote, but mainstream parties shifted their own policies to meet the populist challenge.

===Mainstream responses===
Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that to deflate the appeal of populism, those government figures found guilty of corruption need to be seen to face adequate punishment. They also argued that stronger rule of law and the elimination of systemic corruption were also important facets in preventing populist growth. They believed that mainstream politicians wishing to reduce the populist challenge should be more open about the restrictions of their power, noting that those who backed populist movements were often frustrated with the dishonesty of established politicians who &quot;claim full agency when things go well and almost full lack of agency when things go wrong&quot;. They also suggested that the appeal of populism could be reduced by wider civic education in the values of liberal democracy and the relevance of pluralism.

What Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser believed was ineffective was a full-frontal attack on the populists which presented &quot;them&quot; as &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;foolish&quot;, for this strategy plays into the binary division that populists themselves employ. In their view, &quot;the best way to deal with populism is to engage—as difficult as it is—in an open dialogue with populist actors and supporters&quot; in order to &quot;better understand the claims and grievances of the populist elites and masses and to develop liberal democratic responses to them&quot;.

Mainstream politicians have sometimes sought to co-operate or build alliances with populists. In the United States, for example, various Republican Party figures aligned themselves with the Tea Party movement, while in countries such as Finland and Austria populist parties have taken part in governing coalitions. In other instances, mainstream politicians have adopted elements of a populist political style while competing against populist opponents. Various mainstream centrist figures, such as Hillary Clinton and Tony Blair, have argued that governments needed to restrict migration to hinder the appeal of right-wing populists utilising anti-immigrant sentiment in elections.

A more common approach has been for mainstream parties to openly attack the populists and construct a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; to prevent them from gaining political office. Once populists are in political office in liberal democracies, the judiciary can play a key role in blocking some of their more illiberal policies, as has been the case in Slovakia and Poland. The mainstream media can play an important role in blocking populist growth; in a country like Germany, the mainstream media is for instant resolutely anti-populist, opposing populist groups whether left or right.
Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser noted that there was an &quot;odd love-hate relationship between populist media and politicians, sharing a discourse but not a struggle&quot;.

In certain countries, certain mainstream media outlets have supported populist groups; in Austria, the &quot;Kronen Zeitung&quot; played a prominent role in endorsing Haider, in the United Kingdom the &quot;Daily Express&quot; supported the UK Independence Party, while in the United States, Fox News gave much positive coverage and encouragement to the Tea Party movement. In some cases, when the populists have taken power, their political rivals have sought to violently overthrow them; this was seen in the 2002 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état attempt, when mainstream groups worked with sectors of the military to unseat Hugo Chávez&#x27;s government.

Another discursive strategy of mainstream parties dealing with populist actors is demonization. However, Schwörer and Fernández-García found that this practice is less common in Western Europe as usually assumed and that the center-right even refuses to harshly attack the populist radical right. In a similar vein, mainstream parties use the term &quot;populism&quot; to delegitimize populist actors due to its negative connotation among the public but also use the term to attack non-populist competitors.

===Authoritarianism===
Scholars have argued that populist elements have sometimes appeared in authoritarian movements. Some, but not all, populists are authoritarian, with many (especially right-wing populists) emphasizing &quot;the importance of protecting traditional lifestyles against perceived threats from &#x27;outsiders&#x27;, even at the expense of civil liberties and minority rights.&quot; In states with a weak legacy of rule of law, populists are most likely to succeed at dismantling institutional constraints on their rule.
The historian Roger Eatwell noted that &quot;major ideological differences ... lie at the core&quot; of fascism and populism, the former being anti-democratic and latter being rooted in democracy, &quot;albeit not liberal democracy&quot;. However, he says that fascist politicians have &quot;borrowed aspects of populist discourse and style&quot;. Some fascists have for instance used the terms &quot;people&quot; and &quot;nation&quot; synonymously. The historian Peter Fritzsche argued that populist movements active in Weimar Germany helped to facilitate the environment in which the fascist Nazi Party could rise to power, and that the Nazis utilised, &quot;at least rhetorically&quot;, the &quot;populist ideal of the people&#x27;s community&quot;. The scholar Luke March argued that the populist Narodnik movement of late 19th-century Russia influenced the radical rejection on the constitutional limits of the state found in Marxism–Leninism. Although the Marxist–Leninist movement often used populist rhetoric—in the 1960s, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union called itself the &quot;party of the Soviet people&quot;—in practice its emphasis on an elite vanguard is anti-populist in basis.

In recent history, a 2018 analysis by political scientists Yascha Mounk and Jordan Kyle links populism to democratic backsliding, showing that since 1990, five out of 13 elected right-wing populist governments and five out of 15 elected left-wing populist governments brought about significant democratic backsliding. From the left, the pink tide spreading over Latin America was &quot;prone to populism and authoritarianism&quot;. Correa in Ecuador and Hugo Chávez in Venezuela and his regional allies used populism to achieve their dominance and later established authoritarian regimes when they were empowered. Such actions, Weyland argues, proves that populism is a strategy for winning and exerting state power and stands in tension with democracy and the values of pluralism, open debate, and fair competition.

In 2019, Pippa Norris and Ronald Inglehart classified over 50 European political parties as &quot;authoritarian-populist&quot; as well as world leaders like Donald Trump, Silvio Berlusconi, Viktor Orbán, Hugo Chávez, Nicolás Maduro, Jair Bolsonaro, Narendra Modi, and Rodrigo Duterte. They described the combination of authoritarian values disguised in populist rhetoric as perhaps the most dangerous threat to liberal democracy. They also argue that authoritarian-populism provides a more powerful analytical lens than conventional labels like right-wing populism.

==History==
Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argue that populism is a modern phenomenon. However, attempts have been made to identify manifestations of populism in the democracy of classical Athens. Eatwell noted that although the actual term &quot;populism&quot; parallels that of the &quot;Populares&quot; who were active in the Roman Republic, these and other pre-modern groups &quot;did not develop a truly populist ideology.&quot; The origins of populism are often traced to the late nineteenth century, when movements calling themselves &quot;populist&quot; arose in both the United States and the Russian Empire. Populism has often been linked to the spread of democracy, both as an idea and as a framework for governance.

Conversely, the historian Barry S. Strauss argued that populism could also be seen in the ancient world, citing the examples of the fifth-century B.C. Athens and Populares, a political faction active in the Roman Republic from the second century BCE. The historian Rachel Foxley argued that the Levellers of 17th-century England could also be labelled &quot;populists&quot;, meaning that they believed &quot;equal natural rights ... must shape political life&quot; while the historian Peter Blickle linked populism to the Protestant Reformation.

=== Europe ===

====19th and 20th centuries====

In the Russian Empire during the late 19th century, the &quot;narodnichestvo&quot; movement emerged, championing the cause of the empire&#x27;s peasantry against the governing elites. The movement was unable to secure its objectives; however, it inspired other agrarian movements across eastern Europe in the early 20th century. Although the Russian movement was primarily a movement of the middle class and intellectuals &quot;going to the people&quot;, in some respects their agrarian populism was similar to that of the US People&#x27;s Party, with both presenting small farmers (the peasantry in Europe) as the foundation of society and main source of societal morality. According to Eatwell, the narodniks &quot;are often seen as the first populist movement&quot;.

In German-speaking Europe, the völkisch movement has often been characterised as populist, with its exultation of the German people and its anti-elitist attacks on capitalism and Jews. In France, the Boulangist movement also utilised populist rhetoric and themes. In the early 20th century, adherents of both Marxism and fascism flirted with populism, but both movements remained ultimately elitist, emphasising the idea of a small elite who should guide and govern society. Among Marxists, the emphasis on class struggle and the idea that the working classes are affected by false consciousness are also antithetical to populist ideas.

After 1945 populism was largely absent from Europe, in part due to the domination of Marxism–Leninism in Eastern Europe and a desire to emphasise moderation among many West European political parties. However, over the coming decades, a number of right-wing populist parties emerged throughout the continent. These were largely isolated and mostly reflected a conservative agricultural backlash against the centralisation and politicisation of the agricultural sector then occurring. These included Guglielmo Giannini&#x27;s Common Man&#x27;s Front in 1940s Italy, Pierre Poujade&#x27;s Union for the Defense of Tradesmen and Artisans in late 1950s France, Hendrik Koekoek&#x27;s Farmers&#x27; Party of the 1960s Netherlands, and Mogens Glistrup&#x27;s Progress Party of 1970s Denmark. Between the late 1960s and the early 1980s there also came a concerted populist critique of society from Europe&#x27;s New Left, including from the new social movements and from the early Green parties. However it was only in the late 1990s, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, that populism became &quot;a relevant political force in Europe&quot;, one which could have a significant impact on mainstream politics.

Following the fall of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc of the early 1990s, there was a rise in populism across much of Central and Eastern Europe. In the first multiparty elections in many of these countries, various parties portrayed themselves as representatives of &quot;the people&quot; against the &quot;elite&quot;, representing the old governing Marxist–Leninist parties. The Czech Civic Forum party for instance campaigned on the slogan &quot;Parties are for party members, Civic Forum is for everybody&quot;. Many populists in this region claimed that a &quot;real&quot; revolution had not occurred during the transition from Marxist–Leninist to liberal democratic governance in the early 1990s and that it was they who were campaigning for such a change.

The collapse of Marxism–Leninism as a central force in socialist politics also led to a broader growth of left-wing populism across Europe, reflected in groups like the Dutch Socialist Party, Scottish Socialist Party, and German&#x27;s The Left party. Since the late 1980s, populist experiences emerged in Spain around the figures of José María Ruiz Mateos, Jesús Gil and Mario Conde, businessmen who entered politics chiefly to defend their personal economic interests, but by the turn of the millennium their proposals had proved to meet a limited support at the ballots at the national level.

====21st century====

At the turn of the 21st century, populist rhetoric and movements became increasingly apparent in Western Europe. Populist rhetoric was often used by opposition parties. For example, in the 2001 electoral campaign, the Conservative Party leader William Hague accused Tony Blair&#x27;s governing Labour Party government of representing &quot;the condescending liberal elite&quot;. Hague repeatedly referring to it as &quot;metropolitan&quot;, implying that it was out of touch with &quot;the people&quot;, who in Conservative discourse are represented by &quot;Middle England&quot;. Blair&#x27;s government also employed populist rhetoric; in outlining legislation to curtail fox hunting on animal welfare grounds, it presented itself as championing the desires of the majority against the upper-classes who engaged in the sport. Blair&#x27;s rhetoric has been characterised as the adoption of a populist style rather than the expression of an underlying populist ideology.

By the 21st century, European populism was again associated largely with the political right. The term came to be used in reference both to radical right groups like Jörg Haider&#x27;s FPÖ in Austria and Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s FN in France, as well as to non-radical right-wing groups like Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s or Pim Fortuyn&#x27;s LPF in the Netherlands. The populist radical right combined populism with authoritarianism and nativism.

Conversely, the Great Recession also resulted in the emergence of left-wing populist groups in parts of Europe, most notably the Syriza party which gained political office in Greece and the Podemos party in Spain, displaying similarities with the US-based Occupy movement. Like Europe&#x27;s right-wing populists, these groups also expressed Eurosceptic sentiment towards the European Union, albeit largely from a socialist and anti-austerity perspective rather than the nationalist perspective adopted by their right-wing counterparts. Populists have entered government in many countries across Europe, both in coalitions with other parties as well by themselves, Austria and Poland are examples of these respectively.

The UK Labour Party under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn has been called populist, with the slogan &quot;for the many not the few&quot; having been used.

After the 2016 UK referendum on membership of the European Union, in which British citizens voted to leave, some have claimed the &quot;Brexit&quot; as a victory for populism, encouraging a flurry of calls for referendums among other EU countries by populist political parties.

=== North America ===

In North America, populism has often been characterised by regional mobilisation and loose organisation. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, populist sentiments became widespread, particularly in the western provinces of Canada, and in the southwest and Great Plains regions of the United States. In this instance, populism was combined with agrarianism and often known as &quot;prairie populism&quot;. For these groups, &quot;the people&quot; were yeomen—small, independent farmers—while the &quot;elite&quot; were the bankers and politicians of the northeast. In some cases, populist activists called for alliances with labor (the first national platform of the National People&#x27;s Party in 1892 calling for protecting the rights of &quot;urban workmen&quot;. In the state of Georgia in the early 1890s, Thomas E. Watson led a major effort to unite poor white farmers, and included some African-American farmers.

The People&#x27;s Party of the late 19th century United States is considered to be &quot;one of the defining populist movements&quot;; its members were often referred to as the Populists at the time. Its radical platform included calling for the nationalisation of railways, the banning of strikebreakers, and the introduction of referendums. The party gained representation in several state legislatures during the 1890s, but was not powerful enough to mount a successful presidential challenge. In the 1896 presidential election, the People&#x27;s Party supported the Democratic Party candidate William Jennings Bryan; after his defeat, the People&#x27;s Party&#x27;s support plunged.

Other early populist political parties in the United States included the Greenback Party, the Progressive Party of 1924 led by Robert M. La Follette, Sr., and the Share Our Wealth movement of Huey P. Long in 1933–1935. In Canada, populist groups adhering to a social credit ideology had various successes at local and regional elections from the 1930s to the 1960s, although the main Social Credit Party of Canada never became a dominant national force.

By the mid-20th century, US populism had moved from a largely progressive to a largely reactionary stance, being closely intertwined with the anti-communist politics of the period. In this period, the historian Richard Hofstadter and sociologist Daniel Bell compared the anti-elitism of the 1890s Populists with that of Joseph McCarthy. Although not all academics accepted the comparison between the left-wing, anti-big business Populists and the right-wing, anti-communist McCarthyites, the term &quot;populist&quot; nonetheless came to be applied to both left-wing and right-wing groups that blamed elites for the problems facing the country.

Some mainstream politicians in the Republican Party recognised the utility of such a tactic and adopted it; Republican President Richard Nixon for instance popularised the term &quot;silent majority&quot; when appealing to voters. Right-wing populist rhetoric was also at the base of two of the most successful third-party presidential campaigns in the late 20th century, that of George C. Wallace in 1968 and Ross Perot in 1992. These politicians presented a consistent message that a &quot;liberal elite&quot; was threatening &quot;our way of life&quot; and using the welfare state to placate the poor and thus maintain their own power.

Former Oklahoma Senator Fred R. Harris, first elected in 1964, ran unsuccessfully for the US presidency in 1972 and 1976. Harris&#x27; New Populism embraced egalitarian themes.

In the first decade of the 21st century, two populist movements appeared in the US, both in response to the Great Recession: the Occupy movement and the Tea Party movement. The populist approach of the Occupy movement was broader, with its &quot;people&quot; being what it called &quot;the 99%&quot;, while the &quot;elite&quot; it challenged was presented as both the economic and political elites. The Tea Party&#x27;s populism was Producerism, while &quot;the elite&quot; it presented was more party partisan than that of Occupy, being defined largely—although not exclusively—as the Democratic administration of President Barack Obama.

The 2016 presidential election saw a wave of populist sentiment in the campaigns of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, with both candidates running on anti-establishment platforms in the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively. Both campaigns criticised free trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership but differed significantly on other issues, such as immigration. Other studies have noted an emergence of populist rhetoric and a decline in the value of prior experience in U.S. intra-party contests such as congressional primaries. Nativism and hostility toward immigrants (especially Muslims, Hispanics and Asians) were common features.

=== Latin America ===
Populism has been dominant in Latin American politics since the 1930s and 1940s, being far more prevalent there than in Europe. Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser noted that the region has the world&#x27;s &quot;most enduring and prevalent populist tradition&quot;. They suggested that this was the case because it was a region with a long tradition of democratic governance and free elections, but with high rates of socio-economic inequality, generating widespread resentments that politicians can articulate through populism. March instead thought that it was the important role of &quot;catch-all parties and prominent personalities&quot; in Latin American politics which had made populism more common.

The first wave of Latin American populism began at the start of the Great Depression in 1929 and last until the end of the 1960s. In various countries, politicians took power while emphasising &quot;the people&quot;: these included Getúlio Vargas in Brazil, Juan Perón in Argentina, and José María Velasco Ibarra in Ecuador. These relied on the &quot;Americanismo&quot; ideology, presenting a common identity across Latin America and denouncing any interference from imperialist powers. The second wave took place in the early 1990s; de la Torre called it &quot;neoliberal populism&quot;.

In the late 1980s, many Latin American states were experiencing economic crisis and several populist figures were elected by blaming the elites for this situation. Examples include Carlos Menem in Argentina, Fernando Collor de Mello in Brazil, and Alberto Fujimori in Peru. Once in power, these individuals pursued neoliberal economic strategies recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Unlike the first wave, the second did not include an emphasis on Americanismo or anti-imperialism.

The third wave began in the final years of the 1990s and continued into the 21st century. It overlapped in part with the pink tide of left-wing resurgence in Latin America. Like the first wave, the third made heavy use of Americanismo and anti-imperialism, although this time these themes presented alongside an explicitly socialist programme that opposed the free market. Prominent examples included Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Cristina de Kirchner in Argentina, Evo Morales in Bolivia, Rafael Correa in Ecuador, and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. These socialist populist governments have presented themselves as giving sovereignty &quot;back to the people&quot;, in particular through the formation of constituent assemblies that would draw up new constitutions, which could then be ratified via referendums. In this way they claimed to be correcting the problems of social and economic injustice that liberal democracy had failed to deal with, replacing it with superior forms of democracy.

=== Oceania ===

During the 1990s, there was a growth in populism in both Australia and New Zealand.

In New Zealand, Robert Muldoon, the 31st Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1975 to 1984, had been cited as a populist. Populism has become a pervasive trend in New Zealand politics since the introduction of the mixed-member proportional voting system in 1996. The New Zealand Labour Party&#x27;s populist appeals in its 1999 election campaign and advertising helped to propel the party to victory in that election. New Zealand First has presented a more lasting populist platform; long-time party leader Winston Peters has been characterised by some as a populist who uses anti-establishment rhetoric, though in a uniquely New Zealand style.

===Sub-Saharan Africa===

In much of Africa, populism has been a rare phenomenon. The political scientist Danielle Resnick argued that populism first became apparent in Africa during the 1980s, when a series of coups brought military leaders to power in various countries. In Ghana, for example, Jerry Rawlings took control, professing that he would involve &quot;the people&quot; in &quot;the decision-making process&quot;, something he claimed had previously been denied to them. A similar process took place in neighbouring Burkina Faso under the military leader Thomas Sankara, who professed to &quot;take power out of the hands of our national
bourgeoisie and their imperialist allies and put it in the hands of the people&quot;. Such military leaders claimed to represent &quot;the voice of the people&quot;, utilised an anti-establishment discourse, and established participatory organisations through which to maintain links with the broader population.

In the 21st century, with the establishment of multi-party democratic systems in much of Sub-Saharan Africa, new populist politicians have appeared. These have included Kenya&#x27;s Raila Odinga, Senegal&#x27;s Abdoulaye Wade, South Africa&#x27;s Julius Malema, and Zambia&#x27;s Michael Sata. These populists have arisen in democratic rather than authoritarian states, and have arisen amid dissatisfaction with democratisation, socio-economic grievances, and frustration at the inability of opposition groups to oust incumbent parties.

===Asia and the Arab world===

In North Africa, populism was associated with the approaches of several political leaders active in the 20th century, most notably Egypt&#x27;s Gamal Abdel Nasser and Libya&#x27;s Muammar Gaddafi. However, populist approaches only became more popular in the Middle East during the early 21st century, by which point it became integral to much of the region&#x27;s politics. Here, it became an increasingly common element of mainstream politics in established representative democracies, associated with longstanding leaders like Israel&#x27;s Benjamin Netanyahu. Although the Arab Spring was not a populist movement itself, populist rhetoric was present among protesters.

In southeast Asia, populist politicians emerged in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In the region, various populist governments took power but were removed soon after: these include the administrations of Joseph Estrada in the Philippines, Roh Moo-hyun in South Korea, Chen Shui-bian in Taiwan, and Thaksin Shinawatra in Thailand.
In India, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which rose to increasing power in the early 21st century adopted a right-wing populist position. Unlike many other successful populist groups, the BJP was not wholly reliant on the personality of its leader, but survived as a powerful electoral vehicle under several leaders.

===Late 20th- and early 21st-century growth===
Sheri Berman reviews various explanations of populism including &quot;demand- and supply-side explanations of populism, economic grievance–based and sociocultural grievance–based explanations of populism, and structure- and agency-based explanations of populism&quot;. There is now a wide-ranging and interdisciplinary literature in this area.

In the early 1990s, there was an increasing awareness of populism in established liberal democracies, sometimes referred to as the &quot;New Populism&quot;. The UK&#x27;s referendum on European Union membership and the election of Donald Trump, both in 2016, generated a substantial rise in interest in the concept from both academics and the public. By 2016, &quot;populism&quot; was regularly used by political commentators.

A 2017 review of votes for populistic parties in all developed countries discovered them spiking in 2015 and reaching highest levels since WWII.

Mudde argued that by the early 1990s, populism had become a regular feature in Western democracies. He attributed this to changing perceptions of government that had spread in this period, which in turn he traced to the changing role of the media to focus increasingly on sensationalism and scandals. Since the late 1960s, the emergence of television had allowed for the increasing proliferation of the Western media, with media outlets becoming increasingly independent of political parties. As private media companies have had to compete against each other, they have placed an increasing focus on scandals and other sensationalist elements of politics, in doing so promoting anti-governmental sentiments among their readership and cultivating an environment prime for populists.

At the same time, politicians increasingly faced television interviews, exposing their flaws. News media had also taken to interviewing fewer accredited experts, and instead favouring interviewing individuals found on the street as to their views about current events. At the same time, mass media was giving less attention to the &quot;high culture&quot; of elites and more to other sectors of society, as reflected in reality television shows such as &quot;Big Brother&quot;.

Mudde argued that another reason for the growth of Western populism in this period was the improved education of the populace; since the 1960s, citizens have expected more from their politicians and felt increasingly competent to judge their actions. This in turn has led to an increasingly sceptical attitude toward mainstream politicians and governing groups. In Mudde&#x27;s words, &quot;More and more citizens think they have a good understanding of what politicians do, and think they can do it better.&quot;

Another factor is that in the post-Cold War period, liberal democracies no longer had the one-party states of the Eastern Bloc against which to favourably compare themselves; citizens were therefore increasingly able to compare the realities of the liberal democratic system with theoretical models of democracy, and find the former wanting. There is also the impact of globalisation, which is seen as having seriously limited the powers of national elites. Such factors undermine citizens&#x27; belief in the competency of governing elite, opening up space for charismatic leadership to become increasingly popular; although charismatic leadership is not the same as populist leadership, populists have been the main winners of this shift towards charismatic leadership.
Peter Wilkins has argued that &quot;The end of history and the post-Cold War extension and deepening of capitalism are central to understanding the rise of contemporary populist movements.&quot;

Pippa Norris and Ronald Inglehart connect economic and sociocultural theories of the causes of support for the growing populist movements in Western societies. The first theory they examine is the economic insecurity perspective which focuses on the consequences created by a transforming contemporary workforce and society in post-industrial economies. Norris suggests that events such as globalisation, China&#x27;s membership of the World Trade Organisation and cheaper imports have left the unsecured members of society (low-waged unskilled workers, single parents, the long term unemployed and the poorer white populations) seeking populist leaders such as Donald Trump and Nigel Farage.

The other theory is the cultural backlash thesis, in which Norris and Inglehart suggest that the rise of populism is a reaction from previously dominant sectors of the population, the white, uneducated, elderly men of today, who feel threatened and marginalised by the progressive values of modern society. These groups in particular have a growing resentment towards their traditional values being scolded as politically incorrect and are much more likely to become supportive of anti-establishment, xenophobic political parties.
Norris and Inglehart have analyzed data from the World Values Survey. On this basis, they argue that while the proximate cause of right-wing populist voting may be identified in sociocultural grievances, such grievances are increasingly being driven by economic insecurity and the erosion of traditional values.

Using Brexit and Trump&#x27;s election as examples, Michael Sandel in his 2020 book &quot;The Tyranny of Merit&quot; argues that populism came out of disenchantment with &#x27;meritocratic&#x27; elites ruling over disenchanted working people. He states the popular backlash against meritocracy predicted by Michael Dunlop Young in &quot;The Rise of the Meritocracy&quot; to occur in the 2030s in fact arrived a few decades early. Sandel suggests political systems that reject meritocracy and champion the dignity of labour as the solution to this problem.

<text>A radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG, RITEG), sometimes referred to as a radioisotope power system (RPS), is a type of nuclear battery that uses an array of thermocouples to convert the heat released by the decay of a suitable radioactive material into electricity by the Seebeck effect. This type of generator has no moving parts and is ideal for deployment in remote and harsh environments for extended periods with no risk of parts wearing out or malfunctioning.

RTGs are usually the most desirable power source for unmaintained situations that need a few hundred watts (or less) of power for durations too long for fuel cells, batteries, or generators to provide economically, and in places where solar cells are not practical. RTGs have been used as power sources in satellites, space probes, and uncrewed remote facilities such as a series of lighthouses built by the Soviet Union inside the Arctic Circle. However, the Western Bloc did not use RTGs in this way due to worries about their risk to humans in a radiological accident.

Safe use of RTGs requires containment of the radioisotopes long after the productive life of the unit. The expense of RTGs tends to limit their use to niche applications in rare or special situations.

== History ==
The RTG was invented in 1954 by Mound Laboratories scientists Kenneth (Ken) C. Jordan (1921–2008) and John Birden (1918–2011). They were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2013. Jordan and Birden worked on an Army Signal Corps contract (R-65-8- 998 11-SC-03-91) beginning on 1 January 1957, to conduct research on radioactive materials and thermocouples suitable for the direct conversion of heat to electrical energy using polonium-210 as the heat source. RTGs were developed in the US during the late 1950s by Mound Laboratories in Miamisburg, Ohio, under contract with the United States Atomic Energy Commission. The project was led by Dr. Bertram C. Blanke.

The first RTG launched into space by the United States was SNAP 3B in 1961 powered by 96 grams of plutonium-238 metal, aboard the Navy Transit 4A spacecraft. One of the first terrestrial uses of RTGs was in 1966 by the US Navy at uninhabited Fairway Rock in Alaska. RTGs were used at that site until 1995.

A common RTG application is spacecraft power supply. Several generations of RTG design have been used for probes that traveled far from the Sun, rendering solar panels impractical. As such, they have been used for &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;11&quot;; &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;; &quot;Galileo&quot;; &quot;Ulysses&quot;; &quot;Cassini&quot;; &quot;New Horizons&quot;; and are planned for the &quot;Dragonfly&quot; mission to Titan. RTGs were also used instead of solar panels to power the two Viking landers, and for the scientific experiments left on the Moon by the crews of Apollo 12 through 17 (SNAP 27s). Because the Apollo 13 Moon landing was aborted, its RTG rests in the South Pacific Ocean, in the vicinity of the Tonga Trench. The &quot;Curiosity&quot; and &quot;Perseverance&quot; Mars rover designs selected RTGs to allow greater flexibility in landing sites and longer lifespan than the solar-powered option, as used in prior generations of rovers. RTGs were also used for the Nimbus, Transit and LES satellites. By comparison, only a few space vehicles have been launched using full-fledged nuclear reactors: the Soviet RORSAT series and the American SNAP-10A.

In addition to spacecraft, the Soviet Union built 1,007 RTGs to power uncrewed lighthouses and navigation beacons on the Soviet Arctic coast by the late 1980s. Many different types of RTGs (including Beta-M type) were built in the Soviet Union for a wide variety of purposes. The lighthouses were not maintained for many years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Some of the RTG units disappeared during this time—either by looting or by the natural forces of ice/storm/sea. In 1996, a project was begun by Russian and international supporters to decommission the RTGs in the lighthouses, and by 2021, all RTGs had been removed.

As of 1992, the United States Air Force also used RTGs to power remotely-located Arctic equipment, and the US government has used hundreds of such units to power remote stations globally. Sensing stations for Top-ROCC and SEEK IGLOO radar systems, predominantly located in Alaska, use RTGs. The units use strontium-90, and a larger number of such units have been deployed both on the ground and on the ocean floor than have been used on spacecraft, with public regulatory documents suggesting that the US had deployed at least 100–150 during the 1970s and 1980s.

In the past, small &quot;plutonium cells&quot; (very small 238Pu-powered RTGs) were used in implanted heart pacemakers to ensure a very long &quot;battery life&quot;. , about ninety were still in use. By the end of 2007, the number was reported to be down to just nine. The Mound Laboratory Cardiac Pacemaker program began on 1 June 1966, in conjunction with NUMEC. When it was recognized that the heat source would not remain intact during cremation, the program was cancelled in 1972 because there was no way to completely ensure that the units would not be cremated with their users&#x27; bodies.

== Design ==

The design of an RTG is simple by the standards of nuclear technology: the main component is a sturdy container of a radioactive material (the fuel). Thermocouples are placed in the walls of the container, with the outer end of each thermocouple connected to a heat sink. Radioactive decay of the fuel produces heat. It is the temperature difference between the fuel and the heat sink that allows the thermocouples to generate electricity.

A thermocouple is a thermoelectric device that can convert thermal energy directly into electrical energy using the Seebeck effect. It is made of two kinds of metal or semiconductor material. If they are connected to each other in a closed loop and the two junctions are at different temperatures, an electric current will flow in the loop. Typically a large number of thermocouples are connected in series to generate a higher voltage.

RTGs and fission reactors use very different nuclear reactions. Nuclear power reactors (including the miniaturized ones used in space) perform controlled nuclear fission in a chain reaction. The rate of the reaction can be controlled with neutron absorbing control rods, so power can be varied with demand or shut off (almost) entirely for maintenance. However, care is needed to avoid uncontrolled operation at dangerously high power levels, or even explosion or nuclear meltdown. Chain reactions do not occur in RTGs. Heat is produced through spontaneous radioactive decay at a non-adjustable and steadily decreasing rate that depends only on the amount of fuel isotope and its half-life. In an RTG, heat generation cannot be varied with demand or shut off when not needed and it is not possible to save more energy for later by reducing the power consumption. Therefore, auxiliary power supplies (such as rechargeable batteries) may be needed to meet peak demand, and adequate cooling must be provided at all times including the pre-launch and early flight phases of a space mission. While spectacular failures like a nuclear meltdown or explosion are impossible with an RTG, there is still a risk of radioactive contamination if the rocket explodes, the device reenters the atmosphere and disintegrates, terrestrial RTGs are damaged by storms or seasonal ice, or are vandalized.

== Developments ==

Due to the shortage of plutonium-238, a new kind of RTG assisted by subcritical reactions has been proposed. In this kind of RTG, the alpha decay from the radioisotope is also used in alpha-neutron reactions with a suitable element such as beryllium. This way a long-lived neutron source is produced. Because the system is working with a criticality close to but less than 1, i.e. Keff &lt; 1, a subcritical multiplication is achieved which increases the neutron background and produces energy from fission reactions. Although the number of fissions produced in the RTG is very small (making their gamma radiation negligible), because each fission reaction releases over 30 times more energy than each alpha decay (200 MeV compared to 6 MeV), up to a 10% energy gain is attainable, which translates into a reduction of the 238Pu needed per mission. The idea was proposed to NASA in 2012 for the yearly NASA NSPIRE competition, which translated to Idaho National Laboratory at the Center for Space Nuclear Research (CSNR) in 2013 for studies of feasibility. However the essentials are unmodified.

RTG have been proposed for use on realistic interstellar precursor missions and interstellar probes. An example of this is the Innovative Interstellar Explorer (2003–current) proposal from NASA.
An RTG using 241Americium was proposed for this type of mission in 2002. This could support mission extensions up to 1000 years on the interstellar probe, because the power output would decline more slowly over the long term than plutonium. Other isotopes for RTG were also examined in the study, looking at traits such as watt/gram, half-life, and decay products. An interstellar probe proposal from 1999 suggested using three advanced radioisotope power sources (ARPS). The RTG electricity can be used for powering scientific instruments and communication to Earth on the probes. One mission proposed using the electricity to power ion engines, calling this method radioisotope electric propulsion (REP).

A power enhancement for radioisotope heat sources based on a self-induced electrostatic field has been proposed. According to the authors, enhancements of 5-10% could be attainable using beta sources.

== Models ==
A typical RTG is powered by radioactive decay and features electricity from thermoelectric conversion, but for the sake of knowledge, some systems with some variations on that concept are included here.

=== Space ===

Known spacecraft/nuclear power systems and their fate. Systems face a variety of fates, for example, Apollo&#x27;s SNAP-27 were left on the Moon. Some other spacecraft also have small radioisotope heaters, for example each of the Mars Exploration Rovers have a 1 watt radioisotope heater. Spacecraft use different amounts of material, for example MSL &quot;Curiosity&quot; has 4.8 kg of plutonium-238 dioxide.

** not really an RTG, the BES-5 Buk (БЭС-5) reactor was a fast reactor which used thermocouples based on semiconductors to convert heat directly into electricity

*** not really an RTG, the SNAP-10A used enriched uranium fuel, zirconium hydride as a moderator, liquid sodium potassium alloy coolant, and was activated or deactivated with beryllium reflectors Reactor heat fed a thermoelectric conversion system for electrical production.

**** not really an RTG, the ASRG uses a Stirling power device that runs on radioisotope (see Stirling radioisotope generator)

=== Terrestrial ===
== Fuels ==

The radioactive material used in RTGs must have several characteristics:

# Its half-life must be long enough so that it will release energy at a relatively constant rate for a reasonable amount of time. The amount of energy released per time (power) of a given quantity is inversely proportional to half-life. An isotope with twice the half-life and the same energy per decay will release power at half the rate per mole. Typical half-lives for radioisotopes used in RTGs are therefore several decades, although isotopes with shorter half-lives could be used for specialized applications.
# For spaceflight use, the fuel must produce a large amount of power per mass and volume (density). Density and weight are not as important for terrestrial use, unless there are size restrictions. The decay energy can be calculated if the energy of radioactive radiation or the mass loss before and after radioactive decay is known. Energy release per decay is proportional to power production per mole. 
# Radiation must be of a type easily absorbed and transformed into thermal radiation, preferably alpha radiation. Beta radiation can emit considerable gamma/X-ray radiation through bremsstrahlung secondary radiation production and therefore requires heavy shielding. Isotopes must not produce significant amounts of gamma, neutron radiation or penetrating radiation in general through other decay modes or decay chain products.

The first two criteria limit the number of possible fuels to fewer than thirty atomic isotopes within the entire table of nuclides.

Plutonium-238, curium-244, strontium-90, and most recently americium-241 are the most often cited candidate isotopes, but 43 more isotopes out of approximately 1,300 were considered at the beginning in the 1950s.

The table below does not necessarily give power densities for the pure material but for a chemically inert form. For actinides this is of little concern as their oxides are usually inert enough (and can be transformed into ceramics further increasing their stability), but for alkali metals and alkaline earth metals like caesium or strontium respectively, relatively complex (and heavy) chemical compounds have to be used. For example, strontium is commonly used as strontium titanate in RTGs, which increases molar mass by about a factor of 2. Furthermore, depending on the source, isotopic purity may not be obtainable. Plutonium extracted from spent nuclear fuel has a low share of Pu-238, so plutonium-238 for use in RTGs is usually purpose-made by neutron irradiation of neptunium-237, further raising costs. Caesium in fission products is almost equal parts Cs-135 and Cs-137, plus significant amounts of stable Cs-133 and, in &quot;young&quot; spent fuel, short lived Cs-134. If isotope separation, a costly and time-consuming process, is to be avoided, this has to be factored in, too. While historically RTGs have been rather small, there is in theory nothing preventing RTGs from reaching into the Megawattthermal range of power. However, for such applications actinides are less suitable than lighter radioisotopes as the critical mass is orders of magnitude below the mass needed to produce such amounts of power. As Sr-90, Cs-137 and other lighter radionuclides &quot;cannot&quot; maintain a nuclear chain reaction under any circumstances, RTGs of arbitrary size and power could be assembled from them if enough material can be produced. In general, however, potential applications for such large-scale RTGs are more the domain of small modular reactors, microreactors or non-nuclear power sources.

=== 238Pu ===

Plutonium-238 has a half-life of 87.7 years, reasonable power density of 0.57 watts per gram, and exceptionally low gamma and neutron radiation levels. 238Pu has the lowest shielding requirements. Only three candidate isotopes meet the last criterion (not all are listed above) and need less than 25 mm of lead shielding to block the radiation. 238Pu (the best of these three) needs less than 2.5 mm, and in many cases, no shielding is needed in a 238Pu RTG, as the casing itself is adequate.
238Pu has become the most widely used fuel for RTGs, in the form of plutonium(IV) oxide (PuO2).
However, plutonium(IV) oxide containing a natural abundance of oxygen emits neutrons at the rate of roughly  n/sec/g of plutonium-238. This emission rate is relatively high compared to the neutron emission rate of plutonium-238 metal. The metal containing no light element impurities emits roughly  n/sec/g of plutonium-238. These neutrons are produced by the spontaneous fission of plutonium-238.

The difference in the emission rates of the metal and the oxide is due mainly to the alpha, neutron reaction with the oxygen-18 and oxygen-17 present in the oxide. The normal amount of oxygen-18 present in the natural form is 0.204% while that of oxygen-17 is 0.037%. The reduction of the oxygen-17 and oxygen-18 present in the plutonium dioxide will result in a much lower neutron emission rate for the oxide; this can be accomplished by a gas phase 16O2 exchange method. Regular production batches of 238PuO2 particles precipitated as a hydroxide were used to show that large production batches could be effectively 16O2-exchanged on a routine basis. High-fired 238PuO2 microspheres were successfully 16O2-exchanged showing that an exchange will take place regardless of the previous heat treatment history of the 238PuO2. This lowering of the neutron emission rate of PuO2 containing normal oxygen by a factor of five was discovered during the cardiac pacemaker research at Mound Laboratory in 1966, due in part to the Mound Laboratory&#x27;s experience with production of stable isotopes beginning in 1960. For production of the large heat sources the shielding required would have been prohibitive without this process.

Unlike the other three isotopes discussed in this section, 238Pu must be specifically synthesized and is not abundant as a nuclear waste product. At present only Russia has maintained high-volume production, while in the US, no more than were produced in total between 2013 and 2018. The US agencies involved desire to begin the production of the material at a rate of per year. If this plan is funded, the goal would be to set up automation and scale-up processes in order to produce an average of per year by 2025.

=== 90Sr ===

Strontium-90 has been used by the Soviet Union in terrestrial RTGs. 90Sr decays by β− decay into 90Y, which quickly decays again via β emission. It has a lower decay energy than 238Pu, but its shorter half life of 28.8 years and lower atomic weight yield a power density for pure metal of 0.95 watts per gram. As is a very reactive alkaline earth metal and a so-called &quot;bone seeker&quot; that accumulates in bone-tissue due to its chemical similarity to calcium (once in the bones it can significantly damage the bone marrow, a rapidly dividing tissue), it is usually not employed in pure form in RTGs. The most common form is the perovskite strontium titanate (SrTiO3) which is chemically nigh-inert and has a high melting point. While its Mohs hardness of 5.5 has made it ill-suited as a diamond simulant, it is of sufficient hardness to withstand some forms of accidental release from its shielding without too fine dispersal of dust. The downside to using SrTiO3 instead of the native metal is it reduces power density, as the TiO3 part of the material does not produce any decay heat. 90Sr has a high fission product yield in the fission of both and and is thus available in large quantities at a relatively low price if extracted from spent nuclear fuel. Starting from the oxide or the native metal, one pathway to obtaining SrTiO3 is to let it transform to strontium hydroxide in aqueous solution, which absorbs carbon dioxide from air to become less soluble strontium carbonate. Reaction of strontium carbonate with titanium dioxide at high temperature produces the desired strontium titanate plus carbon dioxide. If desired, the strontium titanate product can then be formed into a ceramic-like aggregate via sintering.

=== 210Po ===

Some prototype RTGs, first built in 1958 by the US Atomic Energy Commission, have used polonium-210. This isotope provides phenomenal power density (pure 210Po emits 140 W/g) because of its high decay rate, but has limited use because of its very short half-life of 138 days. A half-gram sample of 210Po reaches temperatures of over . As 210Po is a pure alpha-emitter and does not emit significant gamma or X-ray radiation, the shielding requirements are as low as those for 238Pu. While the short half-life also reduces the time during which accidental release to the environment is a concern, polonium-210 is extremely radiotoxic if ingested and can cause significant harm even in chemically inert forms, which pass through the digestive tract as a &quot;foreign object&quot;. A common route of production (whether accidental or deliberate) is neutron irradiation of , the only naturally occurring isotope of bismuth. It is this accidental production that is cited as an argument against the use of lead-bismuth eutectic as a coolant in liquid metal reactors. However, if a sufficient demand for polonium-210 exists, its extraction could be worthwhile similar to how tritium is economically recovered from the heavy water moderator in CANDUs.

=== 241Am ===

Americium-241 is a candidate isotope with much greater availability than 238Pu. Although 241Am has a half-life of 432 years, which is about five times longer than that of 238Pu and could hypothetically power a device for centuries, missions with more than 10 years were not the subject of the research until 2019. The power density of 241Am is only one-fourth that of 238Pu, and 241Am produces more penetrating radiation through decay chain products than 238Pu and needs more shielding. Its shielding requirements in a RTG are the third lowest: only 238Pu and 210Po require less. With a current global shortage of 238Pu, 241Am is being studied as RTG fuel by ESA and in 2019, UK&#x27;s National Nuclear Laboratory announced the generation of usable electricity. An advantage over 238Pu is that it is produced as nuclear waste and is nearly isotopically pure. Prototype designs of 241Am RTGs expect 2–2.2 We/kg for 5–50 We RTGs design but practical testing shows that only 1.3–1.9 We can be achieved.
Americium-241 is currently used in small quantities in household smoke detectors and thus its handling and properties are well-established. However, it decays to neptunium-237, the most chemically mobile among the actinides.

=== 250Cm ===

Curium-250 is the isotope with the lowest atomic number that primarily decays by spontaneous fission, a process that releases many times more energy than alpha decay. Compared to plutonium-238, curium-250 provides about a quarter of the power density, but 95 times the half-life (~8300 years vs. ~87 years). As it is a neutron emitter (weaker than californium-252 but not entirely negligible) some applications require a further shielding against neutron radiation. As lead, which is an excellent shielding material against gamma rays and beta ray induced Bremsstrahlung, is not a good neutron shield (instead reflecting most of them), a different shielding material would have to be added in applications where neutrons are a concern.

== Life span ==
Most RTGs use Pu238, which decays with a half-life of 87.7 years. RTGs using this material will therefore diminish in power output by a factor of 1 – (1/2)1/87.7, which is 0.787%, per year.

One example is the MHW-RTG used by the Voyager probes. In the year 2000, 23 years after production, the radioactive material inside the RTG had decreased in power by 16.6%, i.e. providing 83.4% of its initial output; starting with a capacity of 470 W, after this length of time it would have a capacity of only 392 W. A related loss of power in the Voyager RTGs is the degrading properties of the bi-metallic thermocouples used to convert thermal energy into electrical energy; the RTGs were working at about 67% of their total original capacity instead of the expected 83.4%. By the beginning of 2001, the power generated by the Voyager RTGs had dropped to 315 W for &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and to 319 W for &quot;Voyager 2&quot;. By 2022, these numbers had dropped to around 220 W.

NASA has developed a multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG) in which the thermocouples would be made of skutterudite, a cobalt arsenide (CoAs3), which can function with a smaller temperature difference than the current tellurium-based designs. This would mean that an otherwise similar RTG would generate 25% more power at the beginning of a mission and at least 50% more after seventeen years. NASA hopes to use the design on the next New Frontiers mission.

== Safety ==
=== Theft ===

Radioactive materials contained in RTGs are dangerous and can even be used for malicious purposes. They are not useful for a genuine nuclear weapon, but still can serve in a &quot;dirty bomb&quot;. The Soviet Union constructed many uncrewed lighthouses and navigation beacons powered by RTGs using strontium-90 (90Sr). They are very reliable and provide a steady source of power. Most have no protection, not even fences or warning signs, and the locations of some of these facilities are no longer known due to poor record keeping. In one instance, the radioactive compartments were opened by a thief. In another case, three woodsmen in Tsalenjikha Region, Georgia found two ceramic RTG orphan sources that had been stripped of their shielding; two of the woodsmen were later hospitalized with severe radiation burns after carrying the sources on their backs. The units were eventually recovered and isolated. There are approximately 1,000 such RTGs in Russia, all of which have long since exceeded their designed operational lives of ten years. Most of these RTGs likely no longer function, and may need to be dismantled. Some of their metal casings have been stripped by metal hunters, despite the risk of radioactive contamination. Transforming the radioactive material into an inert form reduces the danger of theft by people unaware of the radiation hazard (such as happened in the Goiânia accident in an abandoned Cs-137 source where the caesium was present in easily water-soluble caesium chloride form). However, a sufficiently chemically skilled malicious actor could extract a volatile species from inert material and/or achieve a similar effect of dispersion by physically grinding the inert matrix into a fine dust.

=== Radioactive contamination ===

RTGs pose a risk of radioactive contamination: if the container holding the fuel leaks, the radioactive material may contaminate the environment.

For spacecraft, the main concern is that if an accident were to occur during launch or a subsequent passage of a spacecraft close to Earth, harmful material could be released into the atmosphere; therefore their use in spacecraft and elsewhere has attracted controversy.

However, this event is not considered likely with current RTG cask designs. For instance, the environmental impact study for the Cassini–Huygens probe launched in 1997 estimated the probability of contamination accidents at various stages in the mission. The probability of an accident occurring which caused radioactive release from one or more of its three RTGs (or from its 129 radioisotope heater units) during the first 3.5 minutes following launch was estimated at 1 in 1,400; the chances of a release later in the ascent into orbit were 1 in 476; after that the likelihood of an accidental release fell off sharply to less than 1 in a million. If an accident which had the potential to cause contamination occurred during the launch phases (such as the spacecraft failing to reach orbit), the probability of contamination actually being caused by the RTGs was estimated at 1 in 10. The launch was successful and &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; reached Saturn.

To minimize the risk of the radioactive material being released, the fuel is stored in individual modular units with their own heat shielding. They are surrounded by a layer of iridium metal and encased in high-strength graphite blocks. These two materials are corrosion- and heat-resistant. Surrounding the graphite blocks is an aeroshell, designed to protect the entire assembly against the heat of reentering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The plutonium fuel is also stored in a ceramic form that is heat-resistant, minimising the risk of vaporization and aerosolization. The ceramic is also highly insoluble.

The plutonium-238 used in these RTGs has a half-life of 87.74 years, in contrast to the 24,110 year half-life of plutonium-239 used in nuclear weapons and reactors. A consequence of the shorter half-life is that plutonium-238 is about 275 times more radioactive than plutonium-239 (i.e. /g compared to /g). For instance, 3.6 kg of plutonium-238 undergoes the same number of radioactive decays per second as 1 tonne of plutonium-239. Since the morbidity of the two isotopes in terms of absorbed radioactivity is almost exactly the same, plutonium-238 is around 275 times more toxic by weight than plutonium-239.

The alpha radiation emitted by either isotope will not penetrate the skin, but it can irradiate internal organs if plutonium is inhaled or ingested. Particularly at risk is the skeleton, the surface of which is likely to absorb the isotope, and the liver, where the isotope will collect and become concentrated.

A case of RTG-related irradiation is the Lia radiological accident in Georgia, December 2001. Strontium-90 RTG cores were dumped behind, unlabelled and improperly dismantled, near the Soviet-built Enguri Dam. Three villagers from the nearby village of Lia were unknowingly exposed to it and injured; one of them died in May 2004 from the injuries sustained. The International Atomic Energy Agency led recovery operations and organized medical care. Two remaining RTG cores are yet to be found as of 2022.

=== Accidents ===
There have been several known accidents involving RTG-powered spacecraft:

# A launch failure on 21 April 1964 in which the U.S. Transit-5BN-3 navigation satellite failed to achieve orbit and burned up on re-entry north of Madagascar. The plutonium metal fuel in its SNAP-9a RTG was ejected into the atmosphere over the Southern Hemisphere where it burned up, and traces of plutonium-238 were detected in the area a few months later. This incident resulted in the NASA Safety Committee requiring intact reentry in future RTG launches, which in turn impacted the design of RTGs in the pipeline. 
# The Nimbus B-1 weather satellite, whose launch vehicle was deliberately destroyed shortly after launch on 21 May 1968 because of erratic trajectory. Launched from the Vandenberg Air Force Base, its SNAP-19 RTG containing relatively inert plutonium dioxide was recovered intact from the seabed in the Santa Barbara Channel five months later and no environmental contamination was detected.
# In 1969 the launch of the first Lunokhod lunar rover mission failed, spreading polonium-210 over a large area of Russia.
# The failure of the Apollo 13 mission in April 1970 meant that the Lunar Module reentered the atmosphere carrying an RTG and burned up over Fiji. It carried a SNAP-27 RTG containing of plutonium dioxide in a graphite cask on the lander leg which survived reentry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere intact, as it was designed to do, the trajectory being arranged so that it would plunge into 6–9 kilometers of water in the Tonga trench in the Pacific Ocean. The absence of plutonium-238 contamination in atmospheric and seawater sampling confirmed the assumption that the cask is intact on the seabed. The cask is expected to contain the fuel for at least 10 half-lives (870 years). The US Department of Energy has conducted seawater tests and determined that the graphite casing, which was designed to withstand reentry, is stable and no release of plutonium should occur. Subsequent investigations have found no increase in the natural background radiation in the area. The Apollo 13 accident represents an extreme scenario because of the high re-entry velocities of the craft returning from cis-lunar space (the region between Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and the Moon). This accident has served to validate the design of later-generation RTGs as highly safe.
# Mars 96 was launched by Russia in 1996, but failed to leave Earth orbit, and re-entered the atmosphere a few hours later. The two RTGs onboard carried in total 200 g of plutonium and are assumed to have survived reentry as they were designed to do. They are thought to now lie somewhere in a northeast–southwest running oval 320 km long by 80 km wide which is centred 32 km east of Iquique, Chile.

One RTG, the SNAP-19C, was lost near the top of Nanda Devi mountain in India in 1965 when it was stored in a rock formation near the top of the mountain in the face of a snowstorm before it could be installed to power a CIA remote automated station collecting telemetry from the Chinese rocket testing facility. The seven capsules were carried down the mountain onto a glacier by an avalanche and never recovered. It is most likely that they melted through the glacier and were pulverized, whereupon the 238Pu–Zr alloy fuel oxidized soil particles that are moving in a plume under the glacier.

Many Beta-M RTGs produced by the Soviet Union to power lighthouses and beacons have become orphaned sources of radiation. Its design allowed for the use of normal industrial bolts instead of intrinsically safe or safety interlocked bolts (most likely to reduce cost), and did not require the use of intrinsically safe opening mechanisms or made any use of tamper resistant shielding systems. Several of these units have also been illegally dismantled for scrap metal, or been exposed to storm conditions, freezing and water penetration, common issues in those abandoned in the harsh Russian arctic. some have even fallen into the ocean, or have defective shielding due to poor design or physical damage. The US Department of Defense cooperative threat reduction program has expressed concern that material from the Beta-M RTGs can be used by terrorists to construct a dirty bomb. However, the Strontium titanate perovskite used is resistant to all likely forms of environmental degradation and cannot melt or dissolve in water. Bioaccumulation is unlikely as SrTiO3 passes through the digestive tract of humans or other animals unchanged, but the animal or human who ingested it would still receive a significant radiation dose to the sensitive intestinal lining during passage. Mechanical degradation of &quot;pebbles&quot; or larger objects into fine dust is more likely and could disperse the material over a wider area, however this would also reduce the risk of any single exposure event resulting in a high dose.

<doc id="211494" wikidata="Q352971" url="?curid=211494" title="W. C. Fields">
<text>William Claude Dukenfield (January 29, 1880 – December 25, 1946), better known as W. C. Fields, was an American actor, comedian, juggler and writer.

Fields&#x27;s career in show business began in vaudeville, where he attained international success as a silent juggler. He began to incorporate comedy into his act and was a featured comedian in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; for several years. He became a star in the Broadway musical comedy &quot;Poppy&quot; (1923), in which he played a colorful small-time con man. His subsequent stage and film roles were often similar scoundrels or henpecked everyman characters.

Among his trademarks were his raspy drawl and grandiloquent vocabulary. His film and radio persona was generally identified with Fields himself. It was maintained by the publicity departments at Fields&#x27;s studios (Paramount and Universal) and was further reinforced by Robert Lewis Taylor&#x27;s 1949 biography &quot;W. C. Fields, His Follies and Fortunes&quot;. Beginning in 1973, with the publication of Fields&#x27;s letters, photos and personal notes in grandson Ronald Fields&#x27;s book &quot;W. C. Fields by Himself&quot;, it was shown that Fields was married (and subsequently estranged from his wife), financially supported their son and loved his grandchildren.

==Early years==
Fields was born William Claude Dukenfield in Darby, Pennsylvania, the oldest child of a working-class family. His father, James Lydon Dukenfield (1841–1913), was from an English family that emigrated from Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, in 1854. James Dukenfield served in Company M of the 72nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment in the American Civil War and was wounded in 1863. Fields&#x27;s mother, Kate Spangler Felton (1854–1925), was a Protestant of British ancestry. The 1876 &quot;Philadelphia City Directory &quot; lists James Dukenfield as a clerk. After marrying, he worked as an independent produce merchant and a part-time hotel-keeper.

Claude Dukenfield (as he was known) had a volatile relationship with his short-tempered father. He ran away from home repeatedly, beginning at the age of nine, often to stay with his grandmother or an uncle. His education was sporadic and did not progress beyond grade school. At age twelve he worked with his father, selling produce from a wagon, until the two had a fight that resulted in Fields running away once again. In 1893, he worked briefly at the Strawbridge and Clothier department store, and in an oyster house.

Fields later embellished stories of his childhood, depicting himself as a runaway who lived by his wits on the streets of Philadelphia from an early age, but his home life is believed to have been reasonably happy. He had already discovered in himself a facility for juggling, and a performance he witnessed at a local theater inspired him to dedicate substantial time to perfecting his juggling. At age 17, he was living with his family and performing a juggling act at church and theater shows.

In 1904 Fields&#x27;s father visited him for two months in England while he was performing there in music halls. Fields enabled his father to retire, purchased him a summer home, and encouraged his parents and siblings to learn to read and write so they could communicate with him by letter.

==Entry into vaudeville==
Inspired by the success of the &quot;Original Tramp Juggler&quot;, James Edward Harrigan, Fields adopted a similar costume of scruffy beard and shabby tuxedo and entered vaudeville as a genteel &quot;tramp juggler&quot; in 1898, using the name W. C. Fields. His family supported his ambitions for the stage and saw him off on the train for his first stage tour. To conceal a stutter, Fields did not speak onstage. In 1900, seeking to distinguish himself from the many &quot;tramp&quot; acts in vaudeville, he changed his costume and makeup and began touring as &quot;The Eccentric Juggler&quot;. He manipulated cigar boxes, hats, and other objects in his act, parts of which are reproduced in some of his films, notably in the 1934 comedy &quot;The Old Fashioned Way&quot;.

By the early 1900s, while touring, he was regularly called the world&#x27;s greatest juggler. He became a headliner in North America and Europe and toured Australia and South Africa in 1903. When Fields played for English-speaking audiences, he found he could get more laughs by adding muttered patter and sarcastic asides to his routines. According to W. Buchanan-Taylor, a performer who saw Fields&#x27;s performance in an English music hall, Fields would &quot;reprimand a particular ball which had not come to his hand accurately&quot; and &quot;mutter weird and unintelligible expletives to his cigar when it missed his mouth&quot;.

==Broadway==

In 1905 Fields made his Broadway debut in a musical comedy, &quot;The Ham Tree&quot;. His role in the show required him to deliver lines of dialogue, which he had never before done onstage. He later said, &quot;I wanted to become a real comedian, and there I was, ticketed and pigeonholed as merely a comedy juggler.&quot; In 1913 he performed on a bill with Sarah Bernhardt (who regarded Fields as &quot;an artiste [who] could not fail to please the best class of audience&quot;), first at the New York Palace and then in England in a royal performance for George V and Queen Mary. He continued touring in vaudeville until 1915.

Beginning in 1915, he appeared on Broadway in Florenz Ziegfeld&#x27;s &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; revue, delighting audiences with a wild billiards skit complete with bizarrely shaped cues and a custom-built table used for a number of hilarious gags and surprising trick shots. His pool game is reproduced in part in some of his films, notably in &quot;Six of a Kind&quot; in 1934. The act was a success, and Fields starred in the &quot;Follies&quot; from 1916 to 1922, not as a juggler but as a comedian in ensemble sketches. In addition to many editions of the &quot;Follies&quot;, Fields starred in the 1923 Broadway musical comedy &quot;Poppy&quot;, wherein he perfected his persona as a colorful small-time con man. In 1928, he appeared in &quot;The Earl Carroll Vanities&quot;.

His stage costume from 1915 onward featured a top hat, cut-away coat and collar, and a cane. The costume had a remarkable similarity to that of the comic strip character Ally Sloper, who may have been the inspiration for Fields&#x27;s costume, according to Roger Sabin. The Sloper character may in turn have been inspired by Dickens&#x27;s Mr Micawber, whom Fields later played on film.

==Fields versus &quot;Nibblers&quot;==
In the early years of his career, Fields became highly protective of his intellectual properties that formed his acts and defined his on-screen persona. In vaudeville, burlesque, and in the rapidly expanding motion picture industry, many of his fellow performers and comedy writers often copied or &quot;borrowed&quot; sketches or portions of routines developed and presented by others. As his popularity with audiences continued to rise after 1915, following his initial work in films, other entertainers started to adopt and integrate parts of his successful acts into their own performances. In 1918, he began to combat this by registering his sketches and other comedy material with the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.

Nevertheless, the practice continued and became so frequent by 1919 that he felt &quot;compelled&quot; to place a prominent warning that year in the June 13 issue of &quot;Variety&quot;, the most widely read trade paper at the time. Addressed to &quot;Nibblers&quot; and &quot;indiscreet burlesque and picture players&quot;, his notice occupies nearly half a page in the paper. In it, he cautions fellow performers that all of his &quot;acts (and businesses therein) are protected by United States and International copyright&quot;, stressing that he and his attorneys in New York and Chicago will &quot;vigorously prosecute all offenders in the future&quot;. The concluding attribution, &quot;W. C. Fields&quot;, is printed in such large letters that it dominates the two-page spread in the publication.

Fields continued personally and with legal counsel to protect his comedy material during the final decades of his career, especially with regard to that material&#x27;s reuse in his films. For example, he copyrighted his original stage sketch &quot;An Episode at the Dentist&#x27;s&quot; three times: in January 1919 and twice again in 1928, in July and August. Later, 13 years after its first copyright registration, that same sketch continued to serve Fields as a framework for developing his already noted short &quot;The Dentist&quot;. He also copyrighted his 1928 sketch &quot;Stolen Bonds&quot;, which in 1933 was translated into scenes for his two-reel &quot;black comedy&quot; &quot;The Fatal Glass of Beer&quot;. Other examples of Fields&#x27;s stage-to-film use of his copyrighted material is the previously discussed 1918 &quot;Follies&quot; sketch &quot;An Episode on the Links&quot; and its recycling in both his 1930 short &quot;The Golf Specialist&quot; and in his feature &quot;You&#x27;re Telling Me!&quot; in 1934. &quot;The Sleeping Porch&quot; sketch that reappears as an extended segment in &quot;It&#x27;s a Gift&quot; was copyrighted as well by Fields in 1928. A few more of his copyrighted creations include &quot;An Episode of Lawn Tennis&quot; (1918), &quot;The Mountain Sweep Steaks&quot; (1919), &quot;The Pullman Sleeper&quot; (1921), &quot;Ten Thousand People Killed&quot; (1925), and &quot;The Midget Car&quot; (1930).

The total number of sketches created by Fields over the years, both copyrighted and uncopyrighted, remains undetermined, but may exceed 100. Between 1918 and 1930, he applied for and received 20 copyrights covering 16 of his most important sketches, which Fields biographer Simon Louvish has described as the &quot;bedrock&quot; upon which he built his stage career and then prolonged that success through his films.

==Personal life==

Fields married a fellow vaudevillian, chorus girl Harriet &quot;Hattie&quot; Hughes (1879–1963), on April 8, 1900. She became part of Fields&#x27;s stage act, appearing as his assistant, whom he would blame entertainingly when he missed a trick. Hattie was educated and she tutored Fields in reading and writing during their travels. Under her influence, he became an enthusiastic reader and traveled with a trunk of books, including grammar texts, translations of Homer and Ovid, and works by authors ranging from Shakespeare to Dickens to Twain and P. G. Wodehouse.

The couple had a son, William Claude Fields Jr. (1904–1971) and although Fields was an atheist—who, according to James Curtis, &quot;regarded all religions with the suspicion of a seasoned con man&quot;—he yielded to Hattie&#x27;s wish to have their son baptized.

By 1907, he and Hattie had separated; she had been pressing him to stop touring and settle into a respectable trade, but he was unwilling to give up show business. They never divorced. Until his death in 1946, Fields kept in regular contact with Hattie, mostly through letters, and voluntarily sent her a weekly stipend. Their correspondence would at times be tense. Fields accused Hattie of turning their son against him and of demanding more money from him than he could afford.

While performing in New York City at the New Amsterdam Theater in 1916, Fields met Bessie Poole, an established Ziegfeld Follies performer whose beauty and quick wit attracted him, and they began a relationship. With her, he had another son, William Rexford Fields Morris (1917–2014). Neither Fields nor Poole wanted to abandon touring to raise the child, who was placed in foster care with a childless couple of Bessie&#x27;s acquaintance. Fields&#x27;s relationship with Poole lasted until 1926. In 1927, he made a negotiated payment to her of $20,000 upon her signing an affidavit declaring that &quot;W. C. Fields is NOT the father of my child&quot;. Poole died of complications of alcoholism in October 1928, and Fields contributed to their son&#x27;s support until he was 19 years of age.

In 1933, Fields met Carlotta Monti (1907–1993) and the two began a sporadic relationship that lasted until his death. Monti had small roles in two of Fields&#x27;s films and in 1971 published a memoir, &quot;W. C. Fields and Me,&quot; which was adapted into a motion picture, released by Universal Pictures in 1976. Fields was listed in the 1940 census as single and living at 2015 DeMille Drive. (Cecil B. DeMille lived at 2000, the only other address on the street.)

==Persona==
Fields&#x27;s screen character often expressed a fondness for alcohol, a prominent component of the Fields legend. During his early career as a juggler, Fields never drank at all because he wanted to remain sober while performing. Eventually, the loneliness of constant travel prompted him to keep liquor in his dressing room as an inducement for fellow performers to socialize with him on the road. Only after he became a &quot;Follies&quot; star and abandoned juggling did Fields begin drinking regularly. His role in Paramount Pictures&#x27; &quot;International House&quot; (1933), as an aviator with an unquenchable taste for beer, did much to establish Fields&#x27;s popular reputation as a prodigious drinker. Studio publicists promoted this image, as did Fields himself in press interviews.

Fields kept this as part of his act, often working boozy remarks into his pictures. In &quot;Never Give a Sucker an Even Break&quot; (1941) he tells his niece, played by Gloria Jean: &quot;I was in love with a beautiful blonde once, dear. She drove me to drink. That&#x27;s the one thing I am indebted to her for.&quot; In &quot;My Little Chickadee&quot; (1940), his character said &quot;Once, on a trek through Afghanistan, we lost our corkscrew... and were compelled to live on food and water for several days.&quot;

On movie sets, Fields shot most of his scenes in varying states of inebriation. During the filming of &quot;Tales of Manhattan&quot; (1942), he kept a vacuum flask with him at all times and frequently availed himself of its contents. Phil Silvers, who had a minor supporting role in the scene featuring Fields, described in his memoir what happened next:

In a testimonial dinner for Fields in 1939, the humorist Leo Rosten remarked of the comedian that &quot;any man who hates dogs and babies can&#x27;t be all bad&quot;. The line—which &quot;Bartlett&#x27;s Familiar Quotations&quot; later erroneously attributed to Fields himself—was widely quoted, and reinforced the popular perception that Fields hated children and dogs. In reality, Fields was somewhat indifferent to dogs, but occasionally owned one. He was fond of entertaining the children of friends who visited him, and doted on his first grandchild, Bill Fields III, born in 1943. He sent encouraging replies to all of the letters he received from boys who, inspired by his performance in &quot;The Old Fashioned Way&quot; (1934), expressed an interest in juggling.

==Films==
===Silent era and first talkies===
In 1915, Fields starred in two short comedies, &quot;Pool Sharks&quot; and &quot;His Lordship&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, filmed at the French Gaumont Company&#x27;s American studio in Flushing, New York. His stage commitments prevented him from doing more movie work until 1924, when he played a supporting role in &quot;Janice Meredith&quot;, a Revolutionary War romance starring Marion Davies. He reprised his &quot;Poppy&quot; role in a silent-film adaptation, retitled &quot;Sally of the Sawdust&quot; (1925), directed by D. W. Griffith for Paramount Pictures. On the basis of his work in that film and Griffith&#x27;s subsequent production &quot;That Royle Girl&quot;, Paramount offered Fields a contract to star in his own series of feature-length comedies. His next starring role was in &quot;It&#x27;s the Old Army Game&quot; (1926), which featured his friend Louise Brooks, who later starred in G. W. Pabst&#x27;s &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; (1929) in Germany. Fields&#x27;s 1926 film, which included a silent version of the porch sequence that would later be expanded in the sound film &quot;It&#x27;s a Gift&quot; (1934), had only middling success at the box office. The following three films Fields made at Astoria, however—&quot;So&#x27;s Your Old Man&quot; (1926, remade as &quot;You&#x27;re Telling Me!&quot; in 1934), &quot;The Potters&quot; (1927), and &quot;Running Wild&quot; (1927—were successes on an increasing scale and gained Fields a growing following as a silent comedian. &quot;Running Wild&quot; was the most successful of these, with a final cost of $179,000 and bringing in domestic rentals of $328,000 and another $92,000 from overseas. Rivalry between Paramount studio executives B. P. Schulberg on the West Coast and William Le Baron on the East Coast led to the closure of the New York studio and the centralization of Paramount production in Hollywood. &quot;Running Wild&quot; was the last silent film Paramount made at Astoria. When the filming was completed on April 28, the remaining handful of personnel left on the lot were let go with two weeks&#x27; severance pay, and the studio went idle. Fields went immediately to Hollywood, where Schulberg teamed him with Chester Conklin for two features and loaned him and Conklin out for an Al Christie-produced remake of &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Punctured Romance&quot; for Paramount release. All of these were commercial failures and are now lost; when producer Charles R. Rogers bought the rights to the &quot;Tillie&quot; property in 1932, he inherited the negative of the Fields version and the film went out of circulation permanently.

Fields wore a scruffy clip-on mustache in all of his silent films. According to film historian William K. Everson, he perversely insisted on wearing the conspicuously fake-looking mustache because he knew it was disliked by audiences. Fields wore it in his first sound film, &quot;The Golf Specialist&quot; (1930)—a two-reeler that faithfully reproduces a sketch he had introduced in 1918 in the &quot;Follies&quot;—but gave up wearing a mustache after his first sound feature film, &quot;Her Majesty, Love&quot; (1931), his only Warner Bros. production and the only time he wore a more realistic mustache for a role.

===Success in feature films===
In the sound era, Fields appeared in 13 feature films for Paramount Pictures, beginning with &quot;Million Dollar Legs&quot; (1932). That same year, he also was featured in a sequence in the anthology film &quot;If I Had a Million&quot;. In 1932 and 1933, Fields made four short subjects, distributed through Paramount, for comedy pioneer Mack Sennett. These shorts, adapted with few alterations from Fields&#x27;s stage routines and written entirely by himself, were described by Simon Louvish as &quot;the &#x27;essence&#x27; of Fields&quot;. The first of them, &quot;The Dentist&quot;, is unusual in that Fields portrays an entirely unsympathetic character: he cheats at golf, assaults his caddy, and treats his patients with unbridled callousness. William K. Everson says that the cruelty of this comedy made it &quot;hardly less funny&quot; but that &quot;Fields must have known that &quot;The Dentist&quot; presented a serious flaw for a comedy image that was intended to endure&quot;, and Fields showed a somewhat warmer persona in his subsequent Sennett shorts. Nevertheless, the popular success of his next release, &quot;International House&quot;, established him as a major star. A shaky outtake from the production, allegedly the only film record of that year&#x27;s Long Beach earthquake, was later revealed to have been faked as a publicity stunt for the movie.

Fields&#x27;s 1934 classic &quot;It&#x27;s a Gift&quot; includes another one of his earlier stage sketches, one in which he endeavors to escape his nagging family by sleeping on the back porch, where he is bedeviled by noisy neighbors and salesmen. That film, like &quot;You&#x27;re Telling Me!&quot; and &quot;Man on the Flying Trapeze&quot; both also released in 1934, ended happily with a windfall profit that restored his standing in his screen families.

Beginning in 1933, a tongue-in-cheek revival of the 1844 temperance play &quot;The Drunkard&quot;—urging audience members to hiss the villain and cheer the hero—became a popular attraction in Los Angeles. Fields became a fan of the show and attended it frequently. He was so taken with it that he decided to make a film of it, starring himself. What emerged was &quot;The Old Fashioned Way&quot; (1934), starring Fields as the impresario of a small-time repertory troupe. Fields not only played the villain in the &quot;Drunkard&quot; sequence, but reprised his old juggling specialty for the camera under the direction of comedy specialist William Beaudine.

Fields, an avid reader, had hoped to appear in a film adaptation of one of Charles Dickens&#x27;s works. In 1935, Fields achieved this ambition when he was cast as Mr. Micawber in the David O. Selznick production of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

==Illness==
Beginning in 1935, the strain of his busy film schedule and a succession of personal tragedies took a toll on Fields&#x27;s health. He fell ill with influenza and back trouble requiring round-the-clock nursing in late June 1935, and then was emotionally shattered by the sudden deaths of two of his closest friends, Will Rogers on August 15 and Sam Hardy on October 16. The combination of these events provoked a complete breakdown for Fields that laid him up for nine months. He was gingerly approached the next year to recreate his signature stage role in &quot;Poppy&quot; for Paramount Pictures; he accepted but was very weak throughout the production and a double was often used in long shots. After filming was complete, he relapsed when he learned another close friend and screen partner, Tammany Young, had died in his sleep on April 26 at age 49. Losing three friends in less than a year sent Fields into a deep depression. He stopped eating, his back pain flared up, and his chronic lung congestion trouble returned with a vengeance, eventually turning into pneumonia. He would be in hospitals and sanitariums for various treatments until the summer of 1937.

In September 1937, Fields returned to Hollywood to appear in Paramount&#x27;s variety show &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1938&quot;. Fields alone received star billing, with featured billing for Martha Raye, Dorothy Lamour, Bob Hope, Kirsten Flagstad, Tito Guizar, and the Shep Fields orchestra. Fields loathed working on the film and particularly detested the director, Mitchell Leisen, who felt the same way about Fields and thought him unfunny and difficult. (&quot;He was the most obstinate, ornery son of a bitch I ever tried to work with&quot; was Leisen&#x27;s opinion.) The arguments between Fields and Leisen were so constant and intense during the five-month shoot that when the production concluded on November 15, 1937, Leisen suffered a heart attack. Fields tried to inject his own material into the scenes already written, but when Paramount issued an ultimatum to perform according to the shooting script, Fields refused and Paramount fired him. Fields&#x27;s farewell film for Paramount received critical acclaim and earned an Oscar for best original song (&quot;Thanks for the Memory&quot;), but exhibitors and audiences were disappointed. &quot;One of the poorest shows we have ever received from Paramount. Not one customer was satisfied.&quot; (C.M. Anderson, Tolley, North Dakota); &quot;Named wrong. Should be &#x27;Miscast.&#x27;&quot; (Charles L. Fisk, Butler, Missouri). Fields remained bitter about the outcome: &quot;When the picture is finished and my stuff proves to be the outstanding feature of the picture, what happens? I am given my congé and the director and the supervisor and the producer who are responsible for this $1,300,000 flop go calmly on their way, working for the studio making another picture. The &quot;star&quot; has flopped.&quot;

Now physically unable to work in films, Fields was off the screen for more than a year. During his absence, he recorded a brief speech for a radio broadcast. His familiar snide drawl registered so well with listeners that he quickly became a popular guest on network radio shows. Although his radio work was not as demanding as motion-picture production, Fields insisted on his established movie-star salary of $5,000 per week. He joined ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and Bergen&#x27;s dummy Charlie McCarthy on &quot;The Chase and Sanborn Hour&quot; for weekly insult-comedy routines.

Fields would mock Charlie about his being made of wood:

:Fields: Tell me, Charles, is it true your father was a gateleg table?

:McCarthy: If it is, your father was under it!

When Fields referred to McCarthy as a &quot;woodpecker&#x27;s pinup boy&quot; or a &quot;termite&#x27;s flophouse,&quot; Charlie would fire back at Fields about his drinking:

:McCarthy: Is it true, Mr. Fields, that when you stood on the corner of Hollywood and Vine, 43 cars waited for your nose to change to green?

Another exchange:

:Bergen: Why, Bill, I thought you didn&#x27;t like children.

:Fields: Oh, not at all, Edgar, I love children. I can remember when, with my own little unsteady legs, I toddled from room to room.

:McCarthy: When was that, last night?

During his recovery from illness, Fields reconciled with his estranged wife and established a close relationship with his son after Claude&#x27;s marriage in 1938.

==Return to films==
Fields&#x27;s renewed popularity from his radio broadcasts with Bergen and McCarthy earned him a contract with Universal Pictures in 1939, brokered by promoter-producer Lester Cowan. The first feature for Universal, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Cheat an Honest Man&quot;, carried on the Fields–McCarthy rivalry. It was originally announced as an Bergen-McCarthy starring vehicle, with Fields&#x27;s name in much smaller type as a guest star. Fields dominated the action and stole the film, winning star billing in the process.

In 1940 he co-starred with Mae West in &quot;My Little Chickadee&quot;, and then starred in &quot;The Bank Dick&quot; in which he has the following exchange with Shemp Howard, who plays a bartender:

:Fields: Was I in here last night, and did I spend a $20 bill? (equal to him spending $ today)

:Shemp: Yeah.

:Fields: Oh boy, what a load that is off my mind. I thought I&#x27;d &quot;lost&quot; it!

Fields fought with studio producers, directors, and writers over the content of his films. He was determined to make a movie his way, with his own script and staging, and his choice of supporting players. Universal finally gave him the chance, and the resulting film, &quot;Never Give a Sucker an Even Break&quot; (1941), was an absurd satire of Hollywood moviemaking. Fields appeared as himself, characterized as &quot;The Great Man.&quot; Advance publicity named the film &quot;The Great Man&quot; before Universal adopted the final title. Fields personally recruited Universal&#x27;s then-popular singing star Gloria Jean and his old cronies Leon Errol and Franklin Pangborn as his co-stars. Director Eddie Cline filmed the rambling script as Fields conceived it, culminating in an incoherent string of blackout sketches. In an attempt to add structure to the film, Universal recut and reshot parts of the feature without Fields&#x27;s participation. Both the film and Fields were released quietly in late 1941. &quot;Sucker&quot; was Fields&#x27;s last starring film.

==Final years==
Fields fraternized at his home with actors, directors and writers who shared his fondness for good company and good liquor. John Barrymore, Gene Fowler, and Gregory La Cava were among his close friends. On March 15, 1941, while Fields was out of town, Christopher Quinn, the two-year-old son of his neighbors, actor Anthony Quinn and his wife Katherine DeMille, drowned in a lily pond on Fields&#x27;s property. Grief-stricken over the tragedy, he had the pond filled in.

Fields had a substantial library in his home. Although a staunch atheist—or perhaps because of it—he studied theology and collected books on the subject. According to a popular story (possibly apocryphal, according to biographer James Curtis), actor Thomas Mitchell caught Fields reading a Bible. Mitchell asked what he was doing, and Fields replied, &quot;Looking for loopholes.&quot;

In a 1994 episode of the &quot;Biography&quot; television series, Fields&#x27;s 1941 co-star Gloria Jean recalled her conversations with Fields at his home. She described him as kind and gentle in personal interactions, and believed he yearned for the family environment he never experienced as a child.

During the 1940 presidential campaign, Fields authored a book, &quot;Fields for President&quot;, with humorous essays in the form of a campaign speech. Dodd, Mead and Company published it in 1940, with illustrations by Otto Soglow. In 1971, when Fields was seen as an anti-establishment figure, Dodd, Mead issued a reprint, illustrated with photographs of the author.

Fields&#x27;s film career slowed considerably in the 1940s. His illnesses confined him to brief guest film appearances. An extended sequence in 20th Century-Fox&#x27;s &quot;Tales of Manhattan&quot; (1942) was cut from the original release of the film and later reinstated for some home video releases. The scene featured a temperance meeting with society people at the home of a wealthy society matron, Margaret Dumont, in which Fields discovers that the punch has been spiked, resulting in drunken guests and a very happy Fields.

He enacted his billiard table routine for the final time for &quot;Follow the Boys&quot;, an all-star entertainment revue for the Armed Forces. (Despite the charitable nature of the movie, Fields was paid $15,000 for this appearance; he was never able to perform in person for the armed services.) In &quot;Song of the Open Road&quot; (1944), Fields juggled for a few moments and then remarked, &quot;This used to be my racket.&quot; His last film, the musical revue &quot;Sensations of 1945&quot;, was released in late 1944. By then his vision and memory had deteriorated so much that he had to read his lines from large-print blackboards.

In 1944, Fields continued to make radio guest appearances, where script memorizations were unnecessary. A notable guest slot was with Frank Sinatra on Sinatra&#x27;s CBS radio program on February 9, 1944.

Fields&#x27;s last radio appearance was on March 24, 1946, on the Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy Show on NBC. Just before his death that year, Fields recorded a spoken-word album, including his &quot;Temperance Lecture&quot; and &quot;The Day I Drank a Glass of Water&quot;, at Les Paul&#x27;s studio, where Paul had installed a new multi-track recorder. Listening to one of Paul&#x27;s experimental multi-track recordings, Fields remarked, &quot;The music you&#x27;re making sounds like an octopus. Like a guy with a million hands. I&#x27;ve never heard anything like it.&quot; Paul was amused, and named his new machine OCT, short for octopus.

The session was arranged by one of Fields&#x27;s radio writers, Bill Morrow. Fields, reading his scripts from large-print cue cards and with his delivery noticeably slower than usual, still succeeded in doing funny and flavorful monologues about &quot;demon rum.&quot; It was his last performance.

==Death==
Fields spent the last 22 months of his life at the Las Encinas Sanatorium in Pasadena, California. In 1946, on Christmas Day—the holiday he said he despised—he had a massive gastric hemorrhage and died, aged 66. Carlotta Monti wrote that in his final moments, she used a garden hose to spray water onto the roof over his bedroom to simulate his favorite sound, falling rain. According to a 2004 documentary, he winked and smiled at a nurse, put a finger to his lips, and died. This poignant depiction is uncorroborated and &quot;unlikely&quot;, according to biographer James Curtis. Fields&#x27;s funeral took place on January 2, 1947, in Glendale, California.

His cremation, as directed in his will, was delayed pending resolution of an objection filed by Hattie and Claude Fields on religious grounds. After a delay of more than two years, Fields&#x27;s remains were cremated on June 2, 1949, and his ashes interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale. 

Hattie and Claude Fields also contested a clause leaving a portion of his estate to establish a &quot;W. C. Fields College for Orphan White Boys and Girls, where no religion of any sort is to be preached&quot;; a judge disallowed this bequest in December 1949. Fields&#x27;s loyal secretary and executor Magda Michael, intent on carrying out her employer&#x27;s wishes, fought for the bequest, which was reinstated in December 1950 in the form of a $25,000 donation to &quot;some college in Los Angeles County&quot; to benefit orphans. 

The legal battles waged on, with Hattie Fields ultimately being awarded the bulk of the estate, with payments also made to Carlotta Monti, Fields&#x27;s siblings Walter and Adele, and Fields&#x27;s son by Bessie Poole. Magda Michael resigned as trustee in 1956, when the residue was nearly exhausted, and the estate of W. C. Fields was finally closed on January 16, 1963, 16 years after his death.

===Gravestone===

It has been claimed that Fields&#x27;s grave marker is inscribed, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be in Philadelphia&quot;. The legend originated from a mock epitaph written by Fields for a 1925 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article: &quot;Here Lies / W. C. Fields / I Would Rather Be Living in Philadelphia&quot;. In reality, his interment marker bears only his stage name and the years of his birth and death.

==Comic persona and style==
Fields often played a &quot;bumbling hero&quot;. In 1937, in an article in &quot;Motion Picture&quot; magazine, he analyzed the characters he played:

In features such as &quot;It&#x27;s a Gift&quot; and &quot;Man on the Flying Trapeze&quot;, he is reported to have written or improvised more or less all of his own dialogue and material, leaving story structure to other writers. He frequently incorporated his stage sketches into his films—e.g., the &quot;Back Porch&quot; scene he wrote for the &quot;Follies&quot; of 1925 was filmed in &quot;It&#x27;s the Old Army Game&quot; (1926) and &quot;It&#x27;s a Gift&quot; (1934); the golf sketch he performed in the lost film &quot;His Lordship&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; (1915) was re-used in the &quot;Follies&quot; of 1918, and in the films &quot;So&#x27;s Your Old Man&quot; (1926), &quot;The Golf Specialist&quot; (1930), &quot;The Dentist&quot; (1932), and &quot;You&#x27;re Telling Me&quot; (1934).

Fields&#x27;s most familiar characteristics included a distinctive drawl, which was not his normal speaking voice. His manner of muttering deprecatory asides was copied from his mother, who in Fields&#x27;s childhood often mumbled sly comments about neighbors who passed by. He delighted in provoking the censors with double entendres and the near-profanities &quot;Godfrey Daniels&quot; and &quot;mother of pearl&quot;. A favorite bit of &quot;business&quot;, repeated in many of his films, involved his hat going astray—either caught on the end of his cane, or simply facing the wrong way—as he attempts to put it onto his head.

In several of his films, he played hustlers, carnival barkers, and card sharps, spinning yarns and distracting his marks. In others, he cast himself as a victim: a bumbling everyman husband and father whose family does not appreciate him.

Fields often reproduced elements of his own family life in his films. By the time he entered motion pictures, his relationship with his estranged wife had become acrimonious, and he believed she had turned their son Claude—whom he seldom saw—against him. James Curtis says of &quot;Man on the Flying Trapeze&quot; that the &quot;disapproving mother-in-law, Mrs. Neselrode, was clearly patterned after his wife, Hattie, and the unemployable mama&#x27;s boy played by [Grady] Sutton was deliberately named Claude. Fields hadn&#x27;t laid eyes on his family in nearly twenty years, and yet the painful memories lingered.&quot;

===Unusual names===
Although lacking formal education, Fields was well read and a lifelong admirer of author Charles Dickens, whose characters&#x27; unusual names inspired Fields to collect odd names he encountered in his travels, to be used for his characters. Some examples are:
* &quot;The Great McGonigle&quot; (&quot;The Old-Fashioned Way&quot;);
* &quot;Ambrose Wolfinger&quot; [pointing toward &quot;Wolf-whistling&quot;] (&quot;Man on the Flying Trapeze&quot;);
* &quot;Larson E. [read &quot;Larceny&quot;] Whipsnade&quot;, the surname taken from a dog track Fields had seen outside London (&quot;You Can&#x27;t Cheat an Honest Man&quot;),
* &quot;Egbert Sousé&quot; [pronounced &#x27;soo-ZAY&#x27;, but pointing toward &quot;souse&quot;, a synonym for a drunk] (&quot;The Bank Dick&quot;, 1940).

Fields often contributed to the scripts of his films under unusual pseudonyms. They include the seemingly prosaic &quot;Charles Bogle&quot;, credited in four of his films in the 1930s; &quot;Otis Criblecoblis&quot;, which contains an embedded homophone for &quot;scribble&quot;; and &quot;Mahatma Kane Jeeves&quot;, a play on Mahatma and a phrase an aristocrat might use when about to leave the house: &quot;My hat, my cane, Jeeves&quot;.

===Supporting players===
Fields had a small cadre of supporting players that he employed in several films:

* Elise Cavanna, whose onscreen interplay with Fields was compared (by William K. Everson) to that between Groucho Marx and his friend Margaret Dumont
* Jan Duggan, an old-maid character (actually only a year younger than Fields). It was of her character that Fields said in &quot;The Old Fashioned Way&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s all dressed up like a well-kept grave.&quot;
* Kathleen Howard, as a nagging wife or antagonist
* Baby LeRoy, as a preschool child fond of playing pranks on Fields&#x27;s characters
* Franklin Pangborn, a fussy, ubiquitous character comedian who played in several Fields films, most memorably as J. Pinkerton Snoopington in &quot;The Bank Dick&quot;
* Alison Skipworth, as his wife (although 16 years his senior), usually in a supportive role rather than the stereotypical nag
* Grady Sutton, typically a country bumpkin type, as a foil or an antagonist to Fields&#x27;s character
* Bill Wolfe, as a gaunt-looking character, usually a Fields foil
* Tammany Young, as a dim-witted, unintentionally harmful assistant, who appeared in seven Fields films until his sudden death from heart failure in 1936

==Unrealized film projects==
W. C. Fields was (with Ed Wynn) one of the two original choices for the title role in the 1939 version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Fields was enthusiastic about the role, but ultimately withdrew his name from consideration so he could devote his time to writing &quot;You Can&#x27;t Cheat an Honest Man&quot;. Aljean Harmetz, author of &quot;The Making of The Wizard of Oz&quot;, also said that the studio would not meet his price.

Fields figured in an Orson Welles project. Welles&#x27;s bosses at RKO Radio Pictures, after losing money on &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, urged Welles to choose as his next film a subject with more commercial appeal. Welles considered an adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; which would have starred Fields, but the project was shelved, partly because of contract difficulties, and Welles went on to adapt &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;.

During the early planning for his film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, director Frank Capra considered Fields for the role of Uncle Billy, which eventually went to Thomas Mitchell.

==Influence and legacy==
A best-selling biography of Fields published three years after his death, &quot;W. C. Fields, His Follies and Fortunes&quot; by Robert Lewis Taylor, was instrumental in popularizing the idea that Fields&#x27;s real-life character matched his screen persona. In 1973, the comedian&#x27;s grandson, Ronald J. Fields, published the first book to challenge this idea significantly, &quot;W. C. Fields by Himself, His Intended Autobiography&quot;, a compilation of material from private scrapbooks and letters found in the home of Hattie Fields after her death in 1963.

According to Woody Allen (in a &quot;New York Times&quot; interview from January 30, 2000), Fields is one of six &quot;genuine comic geniuses&quot; he recognized as such in movie history, along with Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Groucho and Harpo Marx, and Peter Sellers.

The Surrealists loved Fields&#x27;s absurdism and anarchistic pranks. Max Ernst painted a &quot;Project for a Monument to W. C. Fields&quot; (1957), and René Magritte made an &quot;Homage to Mack Sennett&quot; (1934).

The &quot;Firesign Theatre&quot; titled the second track of their 1968 album &quot;Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him&quot; &quot;W. C. Fields Forever&quot;, as a pun referring to the Beatles song &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;.

An LP of voice tracks from his movies was released by Decca in 1969. It reached #13 in Canada.

The United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp on the comedian&#x27;s 100th birthday, in January 1980.

===Caricatures and imitations===
* The character Horatio K. Boomer in the &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; radio show had a persona and delivery very much like the characters portrayed by Fields.
* Cartoonist Al Hirschfeld portrayed Fields in caricature many times, including the book cover illustrations for &quot;Drat!&quot;, &quot;A Flask of Fields&quot;, and &quot;Godfrey Daniels!&quot; – all edited by Richard J. Anobile.
*The Amazing Mumford’s voice on Sesame Street is equivalent to Fields’s.
* Fields is among the many celebrities caricatured in the 1936 Merrie Melodies short &quot;The Coo-Coo Nut Grove&quot;.
* Fields is seen sitting on the spectators&#x27; bench in the Disney cartoon &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Polo Team&quot; (1936).
* He appears as W. C. Fieldmouse in the Merrie Melodies short &quot;The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos&quot; (1937).
* In the 1938 Silly Symphonies cartoon &quot;Mother Goose Goes Hollywood&quot; Fields is caricatured as Humpty Dumpty, in reference to his role in the live-action film &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1933).
* One episode of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; featured a tramp who gets old clothes belonging to Fred from his wife Wilma, then when Fred attempts to take back a coat, is trounced with the tramp&#x27;s cane. The tramp has Fields&#x27;s voice and persona.
* A 1960s Canadian cartoon series for kids &quot;Tales of the Wizard of Oz&quot; featured a Wizard with a voice imitation of Fields, a nod to the real-life choice of Fields to play the Wizard in the 1939 film classic opposite Judy Garland.
* The Firesign Theatre used Philip Proctor&#x27;s voice impersonation of Fields for two characters on their albums &quot;Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him&quot; and &quot;How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You&#x27;re Not Anywhere at All&quot;.
* &quot;The Wizard of Id&quot; comic strip contains a shady lawyer character, a Fields caricature named &quot;Larsen E. Pettifogger&quot;.
* Paul Frees adapted a Fields comic routine for the animated TV special &quot;The Mad, Mad, Mad Comedians&quot; in 1970.
* In 1971 Frito-Lay replaced the &quot;Frito Bandito&quot; TV ad campaign with one featuring W. C. Fritos, a round, top-hat wearing character modeled on the movie persona of Fields. Also, circa 1970 Sunkist Growers produced a series of animated TV ads featuring the &quot;Sunkist Monster&quot;, whose voice was an impression of Fields performed by Paul Frees.
* A caricature of Fields appears in the &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; comic book album &quot;Western Circus&quot; and again in the animated feature &quot;Lucky Luke: The Ballad of the Daltons&quot;.
* The TV show &quot;Gigglesnort Hotel&quot; featured a puppet character named &quot;W. C. Cornfield&quot; who resembled Fields in appearance and voice.
* Impressionist Rich Little often imitated Fields on his TV series &quot;The Kopycats&quot;, and he used a Fields characterization for the Ebenezer Scrooge character in his HBO special &quot;Rich Little&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1978), a one-man presentation of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.
* In the second series of the TV drama &quot;Gangsters&quot; a character named the White Devil is introduced, who styles himself W.D. Fields, affecting the vocal mannerisms and appearance of Fields to confuse and confound his enemies. Played by series writer Philip Martin, he himself is credited in the final episode as &quot;Larson E. Whipsnade&quot; after Fields&#x27;s character in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Cheat an Honest Man&quot;.
* Comedian Mark Proksch impersonates Fields in a number of On Cinema episodes, beginning with the series&#x27; Second Annual Oscar Special and continuing through a majority of the seasons.

===In popular culture===

* Fields is one of the figures that appears in the crowd scene on the cover of The Beatles&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.
* There is a poster of Fields on the wall of Sam&#x27;s bedroom on the TV show &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;.
* Derek Newark portrayed Fields in the 1983 Channel 4 television special &quot;Hollywood Hits Chiswick&quot;, in which Fields visits the site of his performance at the Chiswick Empire.
* Actor Bob Leeman portrayed Fields in the 1991 movie &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;.
* Fields appears in &quot;The Keystone Constables&quot; (December 8, 2014), episode 9 of season 8, a vaudeville-themed episode of the Canadian television period drama Murdoch Mysteries. Fields is played by Canadian actor Andrew Chapman.

<text>The Battle of Omdurman was fought during the Anglo-Egyptian conquest of Sudan between a British–Egyptian expeditionary force commanded by British Commander-in-Chief (sirdar) major general Horatio Herbert Kitchener and a Sudanese army of the Mahdist State, led by Abdallahi ibn Muhammad (the Khalifa), the successor to the self-proclaimed Mahdi, Muhammad Ahmad. The battle took place on 2 September 1898, at Kerreri, north of Omdurman.

Following the establishment of the Mahdist State in Sudan, and the subsequent threat to the regional status quo and to British-occupied Egypt, the British government decided to send an expeditionary force with the task of overthrowing the Khalifa. The commander of the force, Sir Herbert Kitchener, was also seeking revenge for the death of General Gordon, who had been killed when a Mahdist army captured Khartoum thirteen years earlier. On the morning of 2 September, some 35,000–50,000 Sudanese tribesmen under Abdullah attacked the British lines in a disastrous series of charges; later that morning the 21st Lancers charged and defeated another force that appeared on the British right flank. Among those present was 23-year-old soldier and reporter Winston Churchill as well as a young Captain Douglas Haig.

The victory of the British–Egyptian force was a demonstration of the superiority of a highly disciplined army equipped with modern rifles, machine guns, and artillery over a force twice its size armed with older weapons, and marked the success of British efforts to reconquer Sudan. Following the Battle of Umm Diwaykarat a year later, the remaining Mahdist forces were defeated and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was established.

==Background==
On 13 September 1882, the British established their control over Egypt following the Battle of Tel el Kebir. In 1883 Muhammad Ahmad ibn as-Sayyid Abd Allah who called himself the Mahdi appeared in Sudan followed by thousands of Islamic warriors known to the Europeans as Dervishes and to the Mahdists as the Ansār. At El Obeid on 3 November 1883, an Egyptian force under General William Hicks, sent by the Egyptian government to put down the uprising, was defeated by the Mahdi&#x27;s army during the Battle of Shaykan. Another force, this time sent by the British government, and led by Major General Charles Gordon proceeded to Khartoum where it was besieged by the Mahdists. On 26 January 1885, the Dervishes overcame Gordon&#x27;s troops and massacred the entire garrison. After the Mahdi died in 1885, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad known as Khalifa &#x27;Abdullahi&#x27; became the new ruler. The Mahdist state, the Mahdia, built on slavery and holy war, enforced a strict Islamic code imposing a reign of terror over the regions of Sudan.

In 1896 to protect British interests, in particular the Suez Canal, and to suppress the slave trade, the British government decided to reconquer Sudan. An Anglo-Egyptian army under British Commander-in-Chief of Egyptian Army Major General Herbert Kitchener marched south from Egypt. Kitchener captured Dongola on 21 September 1896, and Abu Hamed on 7 August 1897. At the Battle of the Atbara River on 7 April 1898, he defeated Mahdist forces led by Osman Dinga and Khalifa Abdullah, opening a line of march up the Nile. On 1 September 1898 Kitchener, supported by a powerful flotilla of gunboats, arrived to face the main Mahdist army at Omdurman, near Khartoum.

== Battle ==
The battle took place at Kerreri, north of Omdurman. Kitchener commanded a force of 8,000 British regulars and a mixed force of 17,000 Sudanese and Egyptian troops. He arrayed his force in an arc around the village of Egeiga, close to the bank of the Nile, where a twelve gunboat flotilla waited in support, facing a wide, flat plain with hills rising to the left and right. The British and Egyptian cavalry were placed on either flank.

Abdullah&#x27;s followers numbered around 50,000, including some 3,000 cavalry. They were split into five groups—a force of 8,000 under Osman Azrak was arrayed directly opposite the British, in a shallow arc along a mile (1.6 km) of a low ridge leading onto the plain, and the other Mahdist forces were initially concealed from Kitchener&#x27;s force. Abdullah al-Taashi and 17,000 men were concealed behind Surkab Hill (in older sources often distorted to &quot;Surgham&quot; Hill) to the west and rear of Osman Azrak&#x27;s force, with 20,000 more positioned to the north-west, close to the front behind the Kerreri hills, commanded by Ali wad Hilu and Osman Sheikh ed-Din. A final force of around 8,000 was gathered on the slope on the right flank of Azrak&#x27;s force.

The battle began in the early morning, at around 6:00 a.m. After the clashes of the previous day, the 8,000 men under Osman Azrak advanced straight at the waiting British, quickly followed by about 8,000 of those waiting to the northwest, a mixed force of rifle and spear-men. The 52 quick firing guns of the British artillery opened fire at around , inflicting severe casualties on the Mahdist forces before they even came within range of the Maxim guns and volley fire. The frontal attack ended quickly, with around 4,000 Mahdist forces casualties; none of the attackers got closer than 50 m to the British trenches. A flanking move from the Ansar right was also checked, and there were bloody clashes on the opposite flank that scattered the Mahdist forces there.

While the Anglo–Egyptian infantry were able to make use of their superior firepower from behind a zariba barricade without suffering significant casualties, the cavalry and camel corps deployed to the centre-north of the main force found themselves under threat from the Mahdist Green Standard force of about 15,000 warriors. Lieutenant Colonel Robert Broadwood, the commander of the Anglo-Egyptian mounted troops, used his cavalry to draw off part of the advancing Ansar attackers under Osman Digna, but the slower-moving camel troops, attempting to regain the protection of the zariba, found themselves being closely pursued by Green Standard horsemen. This marked a crucial stage of the battle, but Kitchener was able to deploy two gunboats to a position on the river where their cannon and Nordenfelt guns broke up the Mahdist force before it could destroy Broadwood&#x27;s detachment and possibly penetrate the flank of the Anglo-Egyptian infantry.

Kitchener was anxious to occupy Omdurman before the remaining Mahdist forces could withdraw there. He advanced his army on the city, arranging them in separate columns for the attack. The British light cavalry regiment, the 21st Lancers, was sent ahead to clear the plain to Omdurman. They had a tough time of it. In what has been described as the last operational cavalry charge by British troops, and the largest since the Crimean War, the 400-strong regiment attacked what they thought were only a few hundred dervishes, but in fact there were 2,500 infantry hidden behind them in a depression. After a fierce clash, the Lancers drove them back (resulting in three Victoria Crosses being awarded to Lancers who helped rescue wounded comrades). One of the participants of this fight was Lieutenant Winston Churchill, commanding a troop of twenty-five lancers. On a larger scale, the British advance allowed the Khalifa to re-organize his forces. He still had over 30,000 men in the field and directed his main reserve to attack from the west while ordering the forces to the northwest to attack simultaneously over the Kerreri Hills.

Kitchener&#x27;s force wheeled left in echelon to advance up Surkab ridge and then southwards. To protect the rear, a brigade of 3,000 mainly Sudanese, commanded by Hector MacDonald, was reinforced with Maxims and artillery and followed the main force at around . Curiously, the supplies and wounded around Egeiga were left almost unprotected.

MacDonald was alerted to the presence of around 15,000 enemy troops moving towards him from the west, out from behind Surkab. He wheeled his force and lined them up to face the enemy charge. The Mahdist infantry attacked in two prongs. Lewis&#x27;s Egyptian Brigade managed to hold its own, but MacDonald was forced to repeatedly re-order his battalions. The brigade maintained a punishing fire. Kitchener, now aware of the problem, &quot;began to throw his brigades about as if they were companies&quot;. MacDonald&#x27;s brigade was soon reinforced with flank support and more Maxim guns and the Mahdist forces were forced back; they finally broke and fled, or died where they stood. The Mahdist forces to the north had regrouped too late and entered the clash only after the force in the central valley had been routed. They pressed Macdonald&#x27;s Sudanese brigades hard, but Wauchope&#x27;s brigade with the Lincolnshire Regiment was quickly brought up and with sustained section volleys repulsed the advance. A final desperate cavalry charge of around 500 Mahdist horsemen was utterly destroyed. The march on Omdurman was resumed at about 11:30.

==Aftermath==
Around 12,000 of the Mahdists were killed, 13,000 wounded and 5,000 taken prisoner. Kitchener&#x27;s force lost 47 men killed and 382 wounded, the majority from MacDonald&#x27;s command. One eyewitness described the appalling scene:

The battle was the first time that the Mark IV hollow point bullet, made in the arsenal in Dum Dum, was used in a major battle. It was an expanding bullet, and the units that used it considered them to be highly effective.

Controversy over the killing of the wounded after the battle, began soon afterwards. The debate was ignited by a highly critical article published by Ernest Bennett (present at the battle as a journalist) in the &quot;Contemporary Review&quot;, which evoked a fierce riposte and defence of Kitchener by Bennet Burleigh (another journalist also present at the battle). Winston Churchill privately agreed with Bennett that Kitchener was too brutal in his killing of the wounded. This opinion was reflected in his own account of the battle when it was first published in 1899. However, mindful of the effect that patriotic public opinion could have on his political career, Churchill significantly moderated criticism of Kitchener in his book&#x27;s second edition in 1902. The Khalifa, Abdullah al-Taashi, escaped and survived until 1899, when he was killed in the Battle of Umm Diwaykarat. Several days after the battle, Kitchener was sent to Fashoda, due to the developing Fashoda Incident. Kitchener was ennobled as a baron, Kitchener of Khartoum, for his victory.

Churchill published his account of the battle in 1899 as &quot;The River War: An Account of the Reconquest of the Soudan&quot;. Present as a war correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot; was Colonel Frank Rhodes, brother of Cecil, who was shot and severely wounded in the right arm. For his services during that battle he was restored to the army active list.

The Battle of Omdurman has also lent its name to many streets in British and Commonwealth cities, for example &#x27;Omdurman Road&#x27; in Southampton and &#x27;Omdurman Street&#x27; in Freshwater, Sydney, Australia.

==Cultural depictions==
===Contemporary responses===

The subject of the battle made its appearance in several oil paintings later exhibited in Britain. In particular, the charge of the 21st Lancers held special appeal and several artists portrayed the scene including Stanley Berkeley, Robert Alexander Hillingford, Richard Caton Woodville, William Barnes Wollen, Gilbert S. Wright, Edward Mathew Hale, Capt. Adrian Jones, Major John C. Mathews, and Allan Stewart. The pictorial press covered the campaign extensively and employed several artists to record the events.

Although some among the press corps accompanying the army had film cameras, no footage was shot of the actual fighting. What was passed off as films of the battle, or preparations for it, were in fact spliced footage of barracks training or troop movements far from the front. Such films maintained their popularity for months in Britain and were succeeded by short features such as the fictional &quot;How Tommy Won the Victoria Cross: an Incident of the Soudan War&quot; (1899) in which English soldiers survive a &#x27;dervish&#x27; ambush.

The victory, and especially the cavalry charge of the 21st Lancers, was soon celebrated by songs on the popular stage, including &quot;What Will They Say in England? A Story of the Gallant 21st&quot; by Orlando Powell (1867–1915) and Léonard Gautier&#x27;s &quot;The Heroic Charge of the 21st Lancers at the Battle of Omdurman&quot;, published complete with piano score (London: E. Donajowski, 1898). William McGonagall was also among those inspired to doggerel patriotism in a hastily produced broadside, &quot;The battle of Omdurman: a new poem: composed September 1898&quot;, soon to be joined by the equally spontaneous verse of Henry Surtees, one of the uniformed participants, in his &quot;The March to Khartoum and Fall of Omdurman&quot; (1899). In the following year there appeared a more polished performance in Annie Moore&#x27;s poetry collection, &quot;Omdurman and other verses&quot;.

In Sudan itself, the Khalifa had poets among his entourage, not all of whom were killed in the fighting, but much of their work was either destroyed by the British during systematic searches after the battle, or even by the poets themselves in fear of reprisal. Nevertheless, as part of the oral tradition there survived a lamentation by Wad Sa’d, who was an eye-witness of the defeat.

===Later fiction===
It was not long before a fictional account of the British military expedition appeared in G.A. Henty&#x27;s series of adventure stories for boys. It was titled &quot;With Kitchener in the Soudan&quot; (1903) and included a description of the battle in chapter 14. It was also depicted in the climax of the 1939 film &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; and later as a short episode in the 1972 film &quot;Young Winston&quot;, where Churchill takes part in the charge of the 21st Lancers. About that period too, Lance Corporal Jones mentions his own participation in the battle during the comedy series &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;.

The battle was later made an incident in a few 21st century novels. &quot;The Triumph of the Sun&quot; (2005) by Wilbur Smith concentrates mainly on the siege of Khartoum and the fate of the defeated, but carries the story through to Kitchener&#x27;s campaign. The 2008 novel &quot;After Omdurman&quot; by John Ferry is also partly set during the 1898 re-conquest of Sudan, with the book&#x27;s lead character, Evelyn Winters, playing a peripheral role in the fighting. The main focus of Jake Arnott&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Paintbrush&quot; (2009) is the life of Hector MacDonald but also includes the battle and Kitchener&#x27;s railway-building drive through Sudan.

<text>The Palestinian Liberation Front (, PLF), also known as the Palestine Liberation Front - Abu Abbas Faction or Palestine Liberation Front, is a minor left-wing Palestinian political faction. It carried out the Achille Lauro hijacking in 1985. Since 1997, the PLF has been a designated terrorist organization by the United States and by Canada since 2003. The PLF has also been banned in Japan.

In 1996, the party took part in the 1996 Palestinian general election, winning 0.11% of the vote. The party also ran in the 2006 Palestinian legislative election under the name ‘Martyr Abu Abbas’, and received 0.30% of the vote.

==History==
===Origins===
The PLF was founded by Ahmad Jibril in 1959 and enjoyed strong support from Syria. In 1967, the PLF joined forces with two other groups, the ‘Heroes of the Return’, linked to the Arab nationalist movement (abtal al-awda) and the group ‘’‘The Youth of the Years’‘’ to form the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in November 1967. In this context, the PLF was described as a ‘’Syrian puppet‘’. The PFLP was said to have emerged from an Egyptian-sponsored programme designed to weaken other Arab governments and thereby strengthen the reputation of Egyptian President Nasser.

The PFLP was led by former Arab-nationalist movement leader George Habash, but in April 1968 Ahmad Jibril split from this group to form the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC), which returned to the strongly pro-Syrian position of the earlier PLF.

Ultimately, this led to the re-emergence of the PLF after the organisation had broken up when Jibril&#x27;s PFLP-GC followed Syria into the fight against the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) during the Lebanese Civil War. Open fighting broke out between the rival factions, and relations only stabilised after mediation by Yasser Arafat. On 24 April 1977, the new PLF was formed under the leadership of Muhammad Zaidan, aka Abu Abbas, and Tal&#x27;at Ya&#x27;akub. Sporadic fighting between the PFLP-GC and the PLF continued, and a bomb attack on the PLF headquarters in August 1977 killed about 200 people.

In November 1977, the Greek Catholic Archbishop of Jerusalem, Hilarion Capucci, was released from Israeli custody after three years. He was imprisoned for three years for arms smuggling for the Fatah. He also made propaganda for the PLF. The Vatican worked for his pardon.

===Split 1982===
In 1982, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon led to the organisation&#x27;s split into three factions. One of the main points of contention was the relationship with the PLO and Fatah, with some members critically supporting Arafat, while others participated in the rebellion against him. All three factions claimed to represent the original organisation and retained the name PLF.
* The group led by Tal&#x27;at Ya&#x27;akub, the PLF&#x27;s secretary-general, remained neutral in the fighting between the various organisations and regrouped in Lebanon. Ya&#x27;akub died of a heart attack in November 1988 and his group disintegrated.
* A smaller group under PLF Central Committee member Abd al-Fatah Ghanim was more aggressively pro-Syrian and took control of the movement in Damascus. It supported Abu Musa&#x27;s Fatah-backed insurgency and cooperated with it in attacking the PLO. The group later based its administration in Libya and ultimately merged with the Ya&#x27;akub faction.
* The pro-Iraq faction under Abu Abbas, who had been deputy secretary-general, had the largest following, estimated at around 400 activists. The group had its headquarters in Tunisia, but after the hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro in 1985, Abu Abbas was expelled by the Tunisian authorities and the group moved to Baghdad.

While each faction retained the original name and claimed to be the parent organisation, Abbas&#x27; group was responsible for the most high-profile terrorist attacks and it is only his faction that has been designated as terrorist.

===Developments after the split===
In 1991, security circles suspected that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein supported both Fatah - Revolutionary Council and the PLF. Both groups were considered ‘highly dangerous’. Intelligence agencies assumed that their leaders had been in Baghdad since the outbreak of the Iraq war, although they were said to have been at odds with Hussein for years. According to the German domestic intelligence service, both combat units were represented in Germany by about twelve members. At the time, Saddam Hussein was considered to have the ability to influence violent Palestinians. In addition to Abu Nidal and the PLF, the 1st of May organisation is also said to have operated from Baghdad; the city was considered ‘the secret PLO headquarters’. In mid-January 1991, Arafat is said to have stayed there, although he had had a feud with Abu Nidal for a long time. This discord among the PLO leadership was seen as a ‘vacuum at the top of the PLO’. Iraq had also provided refuge for ten years to one of the perpetrators of the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993, Sheikh Ahmed Jassin. Baghdad has repeatedly allowed terrorists to go underground.

In 1993, the following people were among Yasser Arafat&#x27;s most important opponents in the PLO:
* Georges Habash, PFLP Palestine Liberation Front, based in Damascus, approx. 2000 fighters;
* Naif Hawatmeh, DFLP Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, based in Damascus, approx. 1500 fighters;
* Ahmed Jibril, PFLP-GC Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, based in Damascus, approx. 300 fighters;
* Abu Abbas, PLF Palestinian Liberation Front, based in Baghdad, approx. 500 fighters.

Nevertheless, the leaders of the PLF still worked with the PLO, with Abu Abbas sitting on the PLO&#x27;s Executive Committee as the PLF&#x27;s representative. After the PLO signed the Oslo Agreement in 1994, which the PLF rejected, Abu Abbas turned away from terrorism and argued for the right of Israel to exist. The movement continued to maintain offices in the Palestinian territories, Lebanon and Iraq, but its activities have since diminished. In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the PLF enjoys less popular support, with its main following drawn from the Lebanese refugee camps, where it reportedly sides with Fatah against various Syrian-backed groups.

===Developments since 2000===
In November 2001, 15 members of a PLF cell were arrested by Israeli authorities. Some of these prisoners had received terrorist training in Iraq. The cell had planned attacks in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion Airport. In addition, it had already been involved in other terrorist activities, including the kidnapping and murder of the Israeli teenager Yuri Gushstein.

During the US-led Iraq War, Abu Abbas was captured by US special forces in April 2003 after intelligence tips in a suburb of the Iraqi capital Baghdad. He may have tried to escape to Syria. Some of his associates had also been arrested in Baghdad. The US State Department had previously indicated that the Iraqi regime had supported the PLF. The Palestinian government demanded the release of Abu Abbas. The reason for this demand was that his arrest violated the 1995 Middle East Agreement. This stipulates that acts committed before the 1993 Oslo Peace Agreement may not lead to prosecution.

According to reports, Abu Abbas died in US captivity on 9 March 2004. Initial reports indicated a natural cause of death. Various Palestinian groups and his widow, however, spoke of murder. Abu Abbas was allegedly the mastermind behind the Achille Lauro kidnapping. The Palestinian Liberation Front participated in the Palestinian Authority elections under the name ‘Martyr Abu Abbas’, but did not win a seat.

===Developments since 2010===
Since 2014, the armed conflicts between the Palestinian Liberation Front, Fatah, Hamas, the Abu Nidal Organization, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Arab Liberation Front have intensified as rival organisations. They engage in skirmishes for political influence in the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. This split in the Palestinian representation of interests has worsened the already precarious situation for the civilian population. Their lives are characterised by unemployment and the radicalisation of young people.

Since 2016, the Palestinian Liberation Front has not claimed any attacks. It continues to maintain military presence in refugee camps in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza.

==Terrorist activities==
The Palestinian Liberation Front has carried out several attacks that have included the killing of civilians. The EU and the United States, among others, have designated the PLF as a terrorist organisation.

=== Attack on Nahariya ===
During the night of 22 April 1979, four members of the PLF went ashore from Lebanon in a rubber dinghy and forcibly entered an apartment building. They took hostages there. The 17-year-old PLF fighter Samir Kuntar is said to have killed two of his hostages on the beach when Israeli security forces approached. Two policemen died, and two of the attackers were also killed. Kuntar was imprisoned in Israel. Hezbollah repeatedly called for his release. In 2004, a prisoner exchange organised by the German Federal Intelligence Service took place. In the process, 430 Palestinians and 16 members of Hezbollah were released. Samir Kuntar was taken off the list of those released at the last moment. In December 2015, he was killed in an air strike.

=== &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; hijacking ===

One notorious incident was the hijacking of the Italian cruise ship MS &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; on 7 October 1985. The hijackers&#x27; original aim was to use the ship to slip into Israel. However, crew members discovered them cleaning weapons, and the group then seized control of the ship, murdering an elderly wheelchair-dependent Jewish New Yorker, Leon Klinghoffer.

US fighter planes later forced down the Egyptian aircraft in which Abu Abbas was escaping following a negotiated end of the hijacking, and forced it to land at a USAF base on Sigonella, Sicily. The Italians let Abbas go, but subsequently sentenced him to five life sentences &quot;in absentia.&quot; Abbas was expelled from Tunisia and established his headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq.

The United States could have brought its own charges against Abbas, although a criminal complaint filed against him in 1986 was dropped a short time later without an indictment.

=== 1990 beach raid ===
In May 1990, the PLF launched an attack on Israel&#x27;s Nizanim beach, near Tel Aviv, urged on by Iraq to torpedo the moves towards a negotiated solution between the PLO and Israel. The attackers had intended to kill tourists and Israeli civilians, but this was prevented. However, the action was significant, in that the failure of Yasser Arafat to condemn this attack led to the United States backing out of the American–Palestinian dialogue that had begun in 1988. Despite Arafat&#x27;s official silence on the issue, the PLF suffered heavy internal criticism within the PLO, and Abu Abbas had to step down from his seat on the executive committee.

=== Netanya Market bombing ===

In May 2002, a man got out of a taxi in the market square of Netanya – according to eyewitness reports, he was wearing an Israeli army uniform – and detonated an explosive device filled with nails. The Abu Dhabi television station reported that the radical Palestinian Liberation Front had claimed responsibility for the attack. According to the Israeli daily newspaper ‘Ha&#x27;aretz’, the radical Islamic group Hamas has also claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing.

=== Explosion at the Karni border crossing ===
In January 2005, an explosive device weighing around 130 kilograms was detonated near an Israeli military base in the Gaza Strip, at the Karni crossing on the border with Israel. Grenades were then fired at the border post, and a skirmish broke out. Five people lost their lives. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, Hamas and the Palestinian Liberation Front claimed responsibility for the attack. They said the attack was a ‘continuation of the resistance’. Abu Abbas had renounced terrorism as early as 1994.

==Ideology==
The Palestinian Liberation Front is considered a radical left-wing organization. Its goal is the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. The PLF is described as nationalist and secular, and aligned with Ba&#x27;athism and Arab socialism. It is part of the Political Bureau of United Action of the Revolutionary Palestinian Forces, which groups revolutionary Palestinian groups together, and also includes the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Fatah, and the Arab Liberation Front.

<doc id="211505" wikidata="Q107216" url="?curid=211505" title="Sepal">
<text>A sepal () is a part of the flower of angiosperms (flowering plants). Usually green, sepals typically function as protection for the flower in bud, and often as support for the petals when in bloom.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;sepalum&quot; was coined by Noël Martin Joseph de Necker in 1790, and derived .

Collectively, the sepals are called the &quot;calyx&quot; (plural: calyces), the outermost whorl of parts that form a flower. The word &quot;calyx&quot; was adopted from the Latin , not to be confused with &#x27;cup, goblet&#x27;. The Latin &quot;calyx&quot; is derived from Greek &#x27;bud, calyx, husk, wrapping&#x27; ( Sanskrit &#x27;bud&#x27;), while is derived from Greek &#x27;cup, goblet&#x27;; both words have been used interchangeably in botanical Latin.

==Description==

The term &quot;tepal&quot; is usually applied when the parts of the perianth are difficult to distinguish, e.g. the petals and sepals share the same color or the petals are absent and the sepals are colorful. When the undifferentiated tepals resemble petals, they are referred to as &quot;petaloid&quot;, as in petaloid monocots, orders of monocots with brightly colored tepals. Since they include Liliales, an alternative name is lilioid monocots. Examples of plants in which the term tepal is appropriate include genera such as &quot;Aloe&quot; and &quot;Tulipa&quot;. In contrast, genera such as &quot;Rosa&quot; and &quot;Phaseolus&quot; have well-distinguished sepals and petals. 

The number of sepals in a flower is its merosity. Flower merosity is indicative of a plant&#x27;s classification. The merosity of a eudicot flower is typically four or five. The merosity of a monocot or palaeodicot flower is three, or a multiple of three.

The development and form of the sepals vary considerably among flowering plants. They may be free (polysepalous) or fused together (gamosepalous). Often, the sepals are much reduced, appearing somewhat awn-like, or as scales, teeth, or ridges. Most often such structures protrude until the fruit is mature and falls off.

Examples of flowers with much-reduced perianths are found among the grasses.

In some flowers, the sepals are fused towards the base, forming a &quot;calyx tube&quot; (as in the family Lythraceae, and Fabaceae). In other flowers (e.g., Rosaceae, Myrtaceae), a hypanthium includes the bases of sepals, petals, and the attachment points of the stamens.

Mechanical cues may be responsible for sepal growth and there is a strong evidence suggesting that microtubules are present and determine the tensile strength and direction of growth at a molecular level.

==Morphology==
Morphologically, both sepals and petals are modified leaves. The calyx (the sepals) and the corolla (the petals) are the outer sterile whorls of the flower, which together form the &quot;perianth&quot;. In some plants, such as &quot;Aristolochia&quot;, the calyx is the primary whorl, forming a flower up to wide, with one sepal growing to a length of Aristolochia grandiflora, the largest of all calyces.

==Function==
Similarly to ordinary leaves, sepals are capable of performing photosynthesis. However, photosynthesis in sepals occurs at a slower rate than in ordinary leaves due to sepals having a lower stomatal density which limits the spaces for gas exchange.

After flowering, most plants have no more use for the calyx which withers or becomes vestigial, although in a few plants such as Lodoicea and eggplant (&quot;Solanum melongena&quot;) the calyx grows along with the fruit, possibly to protect the attachment point. Some plants retain a thorny calyx, either dried or live, as protection for the fruit or seeds. Examples include species of &quot;Acaena&quot;, some of the Solanaceae (for example the Tomatillo, &quot;Physalis philadelphica&quot;), and the water caltrop, &quot;Trapa natans&quot;. In some species, the calyx not only persists after flowering but instead of withering, begins to grow until it forms a bladder-like enclosure around the fruit. This is an effective protection against some kinds of birds and insects, for example in &quot;Hibiscus trionum&quot; and the Cape gooseberry. In other species, the calyx grows into an accessory fruit.

<doc id="211509" wikidata="Q3487983" url="?curid=211509" title="USS Vincennes (CA-44)">
<text>USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; (CL/CA-44) was a United States Navy , sunk at the Battle of Savo Island in 1942. She was the second ship to bear the name.

She was laid down on 2 January 1934 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Company&#x27;s Fore River plant, launched on 21 May 1936, sponsored by Miss Harriet Virginia Kimmell (daughter of Joseph Kimmell, mayor of Vincennes, Indiana), and commissioned on 24 February 1937, Captain Burton H. Green in command.

The &quot;New Orleans&quot;-class cruisers were the last U.S. cruisers built to the specifications and standards of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Such ships, with a limit of 10,000 tons standard displacement and 8-inch caliber main guns may be referred to as &quot;treaty cruisers.&quot; Originally classified a light cruiser when she was authorized, because of her thin armor, &quot;Vincennes&quot; was reclassified a heavy cruiser, because of her 8-inch guns. The term &quot;heavy cruiser&quot; was not defined until the London Naval Treaty in 1930. This ship and were a slightly improved version of the &quot;New Orleans&quot;-class design.

== Inter-war period ==
The new cruiser departed from Boston on 19 April 1937 for her shakedown cruise which took her to Stockholm, Sweden; Helsinki, Finland; Le Havre, France; and Portsmouth, England.

Early in January 1938, &quot;Vincennes&quot; was assigned to Cruiser Division 7 (CruDiv 7), Scouting Force, and steamed through the Panama Canal to San Diego, California. In March, the ship participated in Fleet Problem XIX in the Hawaiian area before returning to San Pedro, California, for operations off the west coast for the remainder of the year.

Following an overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard which lasted through April 1939, the cruiser returned east, transited the Panama Canal on 6 June, in company with , , and and anchored in Hampton Roads on the 13th. For the next two months, she operated out of Norfolk in the vicinity of the Chesapeake lightship and the southern drill grounds. On 1 September 1939, the day on which Adolf Hitler&#x27;s legions marched into Poland and commenced hostilities in Europe, &quot;Vincennes&quot; lay at anchor off Tompkinsville, New York. She then began conducting Neutrality Patrols off the east coast, ranging into the Caribbean Sea and the Yucatán Channel, and continued these duties through the spring of 1940.

Late in May, as German troops were smashing Allied defenses in France, &quot;Vincennes&quot; received orders to immediately transit to the Azores and then, receive further direction. However, the cryptologic code machine failed once &quot;Vincennes&quot; arrived at Ponta Delgada. Unable to receive follow-on orders, the &quot;Vincennes&quot; remained in port from 4–6 June 1940 until the code machine was repaired by an enlisted sailor, Lewis Lee Edwards, using an emory board file to remove corrosion from the code machine&#x27;s electrical contacts. For his actions, Edwards was offered a naval officer&#x27;s commission.

With her communications reestablished, the &quot;Vincennes&quot; received urgent orders to proceed to French Morocco to receive a shipment of gold from the French Currency Gold Reserves for transport to the United States preventing it from being captured by Nazi Germany a few days later. While at anchor at Casablanca, the ship received word of Italy&#x27;s declaration of war upon France, the &quot;stab in the back&quot; condemned by President Franklin Roosevelt soon thereafter. &quot;Vincennes&quot;″ commanding officer — Captain John R. Beardall (later to become Naval Aide to the President) — noted subsequently in his official report of the cruise that &quot;it was apparent that the French bitterly resented this [the declaration of war] and despised Italy for her actions.&quot; After departing North African waters on 10 June, the cruiser returned to the United States to offload her precious metallic cargo and return to the drudgery of Neutrality Patrols.

Overhauling at Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, into the first week of January 1941, &quot;Vincennes&quot; departed Hampton Roads on 7 January, in company with , , and , bound for Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Operating once again in the Caribbean, the heavy cruiser fired battle practice and gunnery exercises in company with &quot;Wichita&quot; through 18 January, when the two cruisers proceeded for Portland Bight, Jamaica. Conducting Neutrality Patrols from this port, &quot;Vincennes&quot; patrolled in company with other ships safeguarding neutral waters and America&#x27;s recently acquired Caribbean bases.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; joined other Fleet units for landing exercises at Culebra, Puerto Rico, on 4 February 1941 and sent her boats to assist in unloading and troop debarkation drills. She assisted transports and in landing men and material before taking station with Fire Support Group II. The cruiser then fired simulated gunfire support operations with her main and secondary batteries in exercises which foreshadowed her future combat role in the South Pacific.

For the remainder of February, the ship continued her landing support operations with Transport Divisions 2 and 7 (TransDivs 2 and 7), anchoring on occasion at Mayagüez or Guayanilla, Puerto Rico. Conducting operations out of Puerto Rican waters, &quot;Vincennes&quot; called at Pernambuco, Brazil, on 17 March and got underway for Cape Town, South Africa, on the 20th. Arriving to a warm welcome nine days later, the ship took on a large shipment of gold bullion to pay for arms purchased in the United States by the United Kingdom and then headed home on the 30th. &quot;En route&quot; to New York, she conducted exercises. After a brief post-voyage period of repairs, the heavy cruiser sailed for the Virginia Capes, where she rendezvoused with and , proceeded on to Bermuda, and dropped anchor in Grassy Bay on 30 April. She patrolled in the Caribbean and off the Atlantic coast of the United States through June.

After continuing her duties with the Neutrality Patrol into the autumn as American naval forces in the North Atlantic found themselves engaged in a &quot;de facto&quot; war with Germany, &quot;Vincennes&quot; undertook another mission to South African waters. She left the east coast late in November with Convoy WS-12, American transports carrying British troops. On 7 December 1941, the cruiser fought its way through heavy seas. Walls of water mercilessly pounded the ships of the convoy, and waves battered &quot;Vincennes&quot;, smashing a motor whaleboat to pieces and ripping a SOC Seagull floatplane from its &quot;moorings&quot; on the storm-lashed well-deck amidships. The plane was battered against the catapult silos and into the hangar doors before it was swept over the ship&#x27;s side. By that evening, however, the ship learned that she was not only at war with the elements but with Japan as well. Japanese naval air forces had struck Pearl Harbor and plunged the United States into war.

== World War II ==
After having safely convoyed her charges to Cape Town, where she arrived on 9 December, &quot;Vincennes&quot; departed South African waters on the 16th, bound, via Trinidad, for Hampton Roads. Following her arrival at Norfolk on 4 January 1942, she shifted to New York four days later to be outfitted for war. Late in the month, she joined as the carrier conducted her shakedown training off the east coast of the United States.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; sailed from New York on 4 March, bound for the Pacific. She transited the Panama Canal on 11 March, and proceeded to San Francisco.

=== Doolittle Raid ===
The heavy cruiser, now a part of TF 18, built around &quot;Hornet&quot;, departed San Francisco on 2 April. The carrier bore a strange deck cargo: 16 Army B-25 Mitchell medium bombers slated to strike at Japan&#x27;s heart. TF 18 rendezvoused with TF 16, built around , and with the combined might of the two task forces, struck out westward across the Pacific, headed toward Japanese home waters.

On the morning of 18 April, when the American warships were still some from the planned launch point, an unexpected hitch developed. Japanese trawlers sighted and reported the task force. Vice Admiral William Halsey decided to fly off the bombers immediately. Accordingly, all 16 of the heavily loaded Mitchells, laden with bombs and extra fuel, rose from &quot;Hornet&quot;″s spray-slicked flight deck and climbed unsteadily into the leaden gray skies. Although the raid inflicted only minimal materiel damage upon the Japanese homeland, it nevertheless packed a powerful morale building &quot;punch&quot;. When queried as to the base from whence the bombers had come, President Roosevelt said &quot;from Shangri-La&quot;.

The combined &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; task force retired eastward and made Pearl Harbor on 25 April. Departing again five days later, the ships, still screened by &quot;Vincennes&quot;, bent on speed toward the Coral Sea. However, they were too late to take part in the Battle of the Coral Sea.

=== Battle of Midway ===
&quot;Vincennes&quot;&#x27; task force returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 May but got underway again on the 29th, bound for waters off Midway Island, which, according to American intelligence reports, a Japanese invasion force was approaching. By 4 June, the heavy cruiser had joined TF16 and was steaming north of Midway.

After American air attacks had crippled three of the four Japanese carriers the &quot;Vincennes&quot;, together with the cruiser &quot;Pensacola&quot; and destroyers &quot;Benham&quot; and &quot;Balch&quot;, was sent over to TF17 to reinforce the carrier Yorktown after it had suffered damage in a dive bombing attack.

At 1640, a group of Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bombers from approached from the north. TF 17&#x27;s radar soon picked them up out, and launched planes to intercept as her screen deployed to bring an optimum concentration of anti-aircraft fire to bear upon the approaching enemy. Three minutes after the first plane was spotted, Grumman F4F Wildcats from the carrier hit a &quot;Kate&quot;. The Japanese torpedo plane spiraled from the sky trailing a long streamer of smoke before crashing into the sea.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; opened fire at 1644 with her /25 cal, 20 mm, and anti-aircraft batteries. Increasing her speed to and slowly turning to starboard, &quot;Vincennes&quot; kept her port guns trained on the enemy. While combing torpedo tracks, &quot;Vincennes&quot; hit a &quot;Kate&quot; and it went into the sea off her port bow.

The sharp, bitter action ended as quickly as it had begun. The Japanese had been driven off, but at a high cost for the Americans. &quot;Yorktown&quot;, mortally hit and listing to port, slowed to a halt. &quot;Vincennes&quot; followed &quot;Astoria&quot; around the carrier, screening from further air attacks. However, on 6 June, slipped through a screen of six destroyers and torpedoed &quot;Yorktown&quot; and , sinking the latter. The carrier went down early on the 7th.

Returning to Pearl Harbor, &quot;Vincennes&quot; entered the navy yard for repairs and alterations which lasted until early July. She then conducted tactical exercises off the island of Hawaii with other ships of TF 11 before departing Hawaiian waters on 14 July to rendezvous with TFs 16, 18, and 62.

=== Guadalcanal Campaign ===
Screening for transport squadron &quot;X-ray&quot;, slated to participate in the Guadalcanal landings, &quot;Vincennes&quot;, in company with and &quot;Quincy&quot;, joined TF 62 on 26 July. On the 27th, the cruiser conducted approach exercises for landing practice and simulated bombardment drills off Koro Island in the Fiji group. As flagship for Task Group 62.3 (TG 62.3), &quot;Vincennes&quot; remained on station in the covering force in the transport area before undertaking further approach and landing exercise support drills.

Following replenishing, the heavy cruiser formed up with the American armada making its way to the Solomon Islands. &quot;Vincennes&quot;, screening transport division &quot;Yoke&quot;, arrived off Guadalcanal on 7 August. At daybreak, beneath overcast skies, the ship catapulted her scout planes and then unlimbered her main and secondary batteries to commence shore bombardment. While the thunder of the supporting ships&#x27; gunfire reverberated across the waters, Marines disembarked from their landing craft and stormed ashore to meet initially light resistance on the island.

Shortly after 1320, Japanese planes launched a counterstrike. To sunward of the transports, &quot;Vincennes&quot; found herself in a favorable position to combat the attack and tracked the opposing planes, being among the first ships to open fire on the attackers. Forced to jettison their deadly loads prematurely, the Japanese retired without doing any damage, but not before &quot;Vincennes&quot; had bagged two of them. After sunset, &quot;Vincennes&quot;, &quot;Quincy&quot;, and &quot;Astoria&quot;, in company with and , retired to conduct screening patrols.

Returning to her covering duties at daylight, &quot;Vincennes&quot; arrived at transport area &quot;X-ray&quot;, off Guadalcanal by daybreak. Two minutes before noon, Japanese bombers, intent on avenging their losses of the day before and disrupting the American landing, swooped down from Rabaul. 27 Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; bombers swept in, in a low-level torpedo attack and ran a gauntlet of gunfire from the transports and their escorting cruisers and destroyers. from the transports, &quot;Vincennes&quot;, as in the previous day&#x27;s action, was again in favorable firing position and opened up with every gun in her battery, from to 20 mm, that could bear on the attackers.

During the ensuing melee, the cruiser used her guns effectively, helping to down at least seven &quot;Bettys&quot; which flew at an altitude of only . The shell splashes from the main battery caused Japanese pilots to fly into walls of water or forced them to drastically alter their approaches. &quot;Vincennes&quot; dodged one torpedo which passed beneath her stern and evaded a bomb which fell off her port quarter. &quot;Jarvis&quot;, adjacent to the cruiser, took one torpedo hit which ultimately proved fatal to the ship.

Later, during the afternoon hours, aerial reconnaissance reported a Japanese surface force coming down from the base at Rabaul. These flights noted what was thought to be three Japanese cruisers, three destroyers and two gunboats or seaplane tenders steaming south. While &quot;Jarvis&quot; limped away from Lunga Point, &quot;Vincennes&quot; and her sisters &quot;Quincy&quot; and &quot;Astoria&quot; steamed, as the northern escort force, to a position off Savo Island to screen the vulnerable transports which were still unloading off the invasion beaches. Captain Frederick Lois Riefkohl of &quot;Vincennes&quot; assumed that the enemy ships reportedly en route from Rabaul were going to launch and support another air attack early the following morning. He accordingly issued orders to be especially vigilant during the midwatch and fully expected an air attack at daybreak.

=== Loss at the Battle of Savo Island ===
At about midnight on 8 August, Riefkohl retired to his sea cabin, adjacent to the pilothouse, after having been on the bridge continuously since 0445 that morning. Turning in at 0050 on 9 August, he left his ship in the hands of the executive officer, Commander W. E. A. Mullan.

Nearly an hour later, at about 0145, lookouts spotted flares and star shells to the southward, accompanied by the low rumble of gunfire. The sound of the general quarters alarm soon rang throughout the ship and stirred her to action. &quot;Vincennes&quot;&#x27; lookouts were seeing the elimination of the southern escort group, based around and . Unbeknownst to the men manning the ships to the northward, a powerful enemy force was heading in their direction. Six cruisers and one destroyer under the command of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa had turned north and were steaming directly towards &quot;Vincennes&quot; and her two sisters.

The first Japanese cruiser searchlight beams illuminated &quot;Vincennes&quot; shortly after 0155, and the American cruiser opened fire with her main battery at the troublesome lights. Within a minute, however, Japanese shells bracketed the ship and &quot;Vincennes&quot; shuddered under the impact of Japanese eight-inch armor-piercing shells. The bridge, carpenter shop, &quot;battle II,&quot; and radio antenna trunks all were hit by the first salvo.

Altering course to port, Riefkohl, who had come to the bridge at the alarm, rang down for increased speed. With the ship and internal communications disrupted, it is doubtful that the order was received. Still moving at , the heavy cruiser reeled under the impact of another group of direct hits.

Some of the shells in this group set fire to the volatile aircraft in &quot;Vincennes&quot;″ hangar space, and the resultant flames became uncontrollable. A direct hit knocked the aft antiaircraft director overboard. At 0200, &quot;Vincennes&quot; heeled to starboard in an attempt to evade enemy gunfire, only to be hit by Japanese torpedoes. One or two &quot;Long Lance&quot; torpedoes ripped into the ship&#x27;s number 4 fireroom and put it out of action. In moments the report came &quot;Both engine rooms are black and dead.&quot;

Having lost power and all steering control five minutes later, &quot;Vincennes&quot; was dead in the water within minutes. The glare of burning fires attracted additional incoming shells which quickly put the ship&#x27;s own guns out of action. &quot;Vincennes&quot; shuddered to a halt. Hit at least 85 times by and shells, the ship gradually began to list.

At 0210, the Japanese retired, leaving Savo Island and the burning hulks of three American cruisers in their wakes. As &quot;Vincennes&quot;″ list increased to port, Riefkohl issued the order to abandon ship at 0230. Serviceable life jackets and rafts were broken out, and the crew began abandoning ship. At 0240, the captain went down to the main deck and jumped into the waters of what would come to be known as Ironbottom Sound. 322 crewmen were killed in action.

Riefkohl subsequently wrote: &quot;The magnificent &quot;Vincennes&quot;, which we were all so proud of, and which I had the honor to command since 23 April 1941, rolled over and then sank at about 0250, 9 August 1942, about 2½ miles east of Savo Island … Solomons Group, in some 500 fathoms [910 m] of water.&quot;

==Rediscovery==
The wreck of USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; was discovered in early 2015 during a sonar mapping project of Iron Bottom Sound led by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.

<text>In the United States, a national monument is a protected area that can be created from any land owned or controlled by the federal government by proclamation of the president of the United States or an act of Congress. National monuments protect a wide variety of natural and historic resources, including sites of geologic, marine, archaeological, and cultural importance. The Antiquities Act of 1906 gives presidents the power to proclaim national monuments by executive action. In contrast, national parks in the U.S. must be created by Congressional legislation. Some national monuments were first created by presidential action and later designated as national parks by congressional approval.

The 138 national monuments are managed by several federal agencies: the National Park Service, United States Forest Service, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (in the case of marine national monuments). Historically, some national monuments were managed by the War Department.

President Theodore Roosevelt used the Antiquities Act to declare Devils Tower in Wyoming as the first U.S. national monument.

==History==

The Antiquities Act authorized permits for legitimate archaeological investigations and penalties for taking or destroying antiquities without permission. Additionally, it authorized the president to proclaim &quot;historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest&quot; on federal lands as national monuments, &quot;the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.&quot;

Presidents have used the Antiquities Act&#x27;s proclamation authority not only to create new national monuments but to enlarge existing ones. For example, Franklin D. Roosevelt significantly enlarged Dinosaur National Monument in 1938. Lyndon B. Johnson added Ellis Island to Statue of Liberty National Monument in 1965, and Jimmy Carter made major additions to Glacier Bay and Katmai National Monuments in 1978.

===Early 20th century origin===
The Antiquities Act of 1906 resulted from concerns about protecting mostly prehistoric Native American ruins and artifacts (collectively termed &quot;antiquities&quot;) on federal lands in the American West.

The reference in the act to &quot;objects of ... scientific interest&quot; enabled President Theodore Roosevelt to make a natural geological feature, Devils Tower in Wyoming, the first national monument three months later. Among the next three monuments he proclaimed in 1906 was Petrified Forest in Arizona, another natural feature. In 1908, Roosevelt used the act to proclaim more than of the Grand Canyon as a national monument.

In response to Roosevelt&#x27;s declaration of the Grand Canyon monument, a putative mining claimant sued in federal court, claiming that Roosevelt had overstepped the Antiquities Act authority by protecting an entire canyon. In 1920, the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the Grand Canyon was indeed &quot;an object of historic or scientific interest&quot; and could be protected by proclamation, setting a precedent for the use of the Antiquities Act to preserve large areas. Federal courts have since rejected every challenge to the president&#x27;s use of Antiquities Act preservation authority, ruling that the law gives the president exclusive discretion over the determination of the size and nature of the objects protected.

===Mid-20th century ===
In 1918, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed Katmai National Monument in Alaska, comprising more than . Katmai was later enlarged to nearly by subsequent Antiquities Act proclamations and for many years was the largest national park system unit.

Petrified Forest, Grand Canyon, and Great Sand Dunes, among several other national parks, were also originally proclaimed as national monuments and later designated national parks by Congress.

Substantial opposition did not materialize until 1943, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed Jackson Hole National Monument in Wyoming. He did this to accept a donation of lands acquired by John D. Rockefeller Jr., for addition to Grand Teton National Park after Congress had declined to authorize this park expansion. Roosevelt&#x27;s proclamation unleashed a storm of criticism about use of the Antiquities Act to circumvent Congress. A bill abolishing Jackson Hole National Monument passed Congress but was vetoed by Roosevelt, and Congressional and court challenges to the proclamation authority were mounted. In 1950, Congress finally incorporated most of the monument into Grand Teton National Park, but the act doing so barred further use of the proclamation authority in Wyoming except for areas of 5,000 acres or less.

===Late 20th century and early 21st century===
The most substantial use of the proclamation authority came in 1978, when President Jimmy Carter proclaimed 17 new national monuments in Alaska after Congress had adjourned without passing a major Alaska lands bill. Congress passed a revised version of the bill in 1980 incorporating most of these national monuments into national parks and preserves, but the act also curtailed further use of the proclamation authority in Alaska.

Carter&#x27;s 1978 proclamations included Misty Fjords and Admiralty Island National Monuments in the U.S. Forest Service and Becharof and Yukon Flats National Monuments in the Fish and Wildlife Service, the first to be created outside of the National Park Service. The latter two became national wildlife refuges in 1980.

The proclamation authority was not used again anywhere until 1996, when President Bill Clinton proclaimed the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument in Utah, after many years of unsuccessful advocacy by conservationists to protect parts of the area. This was the first national monument managed by the Bureau of Land Management. This action was unpopular in Utah, and bills were introduced to further restrict the president&#x27;s authority, none of which have been enacted. Most of the 16 national monuments created by President Clinton are managed not by the National Park Service, but by the Bureau of Land Management as part of the National Landscape Conservation System.

President George W. Bush created four marine national monuments in the Pacific Ocean, the largest in the system: Papahānaumokuākea, Pacific Islands Heritag, Mariana Trench, and the Rose Atoll Marine National Monuments. They are managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration overseeing the fisheries. President Barack Obama significantly expanded two of them and added a fifth in the Atlantic Ocean, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument.

On June 24, 2016, Obama designated the Stonewall Inn and surrounding areas in Greenwich Village, New York as the Stonewall National Monument, the first national monument commemorating the movement for LGBT rights in the United States. Obama&#x27;s establishments included several others recognizing civil rights history, including the César E. Chávez, Belmont–Paul Women&#x27;s Equality, Freedom Riders, and Birmingham Civil Rights National Monuments.

In December 2017, President Donald Trump substantially reduced the sizes of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monuments, removing protections on about 2.8 million acres of land where mining could resume. Three lawsuits challenged the legality of this action in federal court, and in October 2021, President Joe Biden reversed the changes. The restoration of the monuments has been challenged in court in an attempt to attack the Antiquities Act.

President Biden&#x27;s proclamations establishing and expanding monuments often incorporated consultation with Native American tribes for management and planning.

In 2025, Trump&#x27;s interior secretary Doug Burgum ordered a review of all withdrawn public lands including national monuments for their exploitation for drilling and mining.

<text>Vulpecula is a faint constellation in the northern sky. Its name is Latin for &quot;little fox&quot;, although it is commonly known simply as the fox. It was identified in the seventeenth century, and is located in the middle of the Summer Triangle (an asterism consisting of the bright stars Deneb, Vega, and Altair).

==Features==
===Stars===

There are no stars brighter than 4th magnitude in this constellation. The brightest star in Vulpecula is Alpha Vulpeculae, a magnitude 4.44m red giant at an approximate distance of 291 light-years. The star is an optical binary (separation of 413.7&quot;) that can be split using binoculars. The star also carries the traditional name Anser, which refers to the goose the little fox holds in its jaws.

23 Vulpeculae is the second brightest star in the constellation.

In 1967, the first pulsar, PSR B1919+21, was discovered in Vulpecula by Jocelyn Bell, supervised by Antony Hewish, in Cambridge. While they were searching for scintillation of radio signals of quasars, they observed pulses which repeated with a period of 1.3373 seconds. Terrestrial origin of the signal was ruled out because the time it took the object to reappear was a sidereal day instead of a solar day. This anomaly was finally identified as the signal of a rapidly rotating neutron star. Fifteen years after the first pulsar was discovered, the first millisecond pulsar, PSR B1937+21, was also discovered in Vulpecula, only a few degrees in the sky away from PSR B1919+21.

Vulpecula is also home to HD 189733 b, one of the closest extrasolar planets studied by the now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope. On 11 July 2007, a team led by Giovanna Tinetti published the results of their observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope concluding there is solid evidence for significant amounts of water vapor in the planet&#x27;s atmosphere. Although HD 189733b with atmospheric temperatures rising above 1,000 °C is far from being habitable, this finding increases the likelihood that water, an essential component of life, would be found on a more Earth-like planet in the future.

Also located in Vulpecula is soft gamma repeater SGR 1935+2154. In 2020 it emitted a fast radio burst, the first one to be observed in the Milky Way.

===Deep-sky objects===

The Dumbbell Nebula (M27), is a large, bright planetary nebula which was discovered by the French astronomer Charles Messier in 1764 as the very first object of its kind. It can be seen with good binoculars in a dark sky location, appearing as a dimly glowing disk approximately 8 arcminutes in diameter. The nebula is approximately 9,800 years old. A telescope reveals its double-lobed shape, similar to that of an hourglass. Brocchi&#x27;s Cluster (Collinder 399) is an asterism formerly thought to be an open cluster. It is also called &quot;the Coathanger&quot; because of its distinctive star pattern when viewed with binoculars or a low power telescope.

NGC 7052 is an elliptical galaxy in Vulpecula at a distance of 214 million light-years from Earth. It has a central dusty disk with a diameter of 3700 light-years; there is a supermassive black hole with a mass of 300 million solar masses in its nucleus. Astronomers surmise that the disk is the remnant of a smaller galaxy that merged with NGC 7052. Jets can be seen emanating from the galaxy, and it has very strong radio emissions. This means that it is also classified as a radio galaxy.

The eastern part of Vulpecula is occupied by the Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall. It is a galaxy filament, with the length of 3,000 megaparsecs, making it the largest known structure in the universe.

=== Stellar association ===
Vulpecula contains an OB-association of young stars, called the Vulpecula OB-association or Vul OB1. The association contains nearly 100 OB-stars and over 800 young stellar objects. It lies in the galactic plane, at a distance of about 2300 parsec. It contains the emission-line nebulae Sh-86, Sh-87 and Sh-88. Vul OB1 has a length of about 100 parsec and is sculpting many pillar-like structures in this region.

==History==

In the late 17th century, the astronomer Johannes Hevelius created Vulpecula. It was originally known as Vulpecula cum ansere (&quot;the little fox with the goose&quot;) or Vulpecula et Anser (&quot;the little fox and the goose&quot;), and was illustrated with a goose in the jaws of a fox. Hevelius did not regard the fox and the goose to be two separate constellations, but later the stars were divided into a separate Anser and Vulpecula. Today, they have been merged again under the name of the fox, but the goose is remembered by the name of the star α Vulpeculae: Anser.

<text>Warren Edward Buffett ( ; born August 30, 1930) is an American investor and philanthropist who currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. As a result of his investment success, Buffett is one of the best-known investors in the world. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, as of 17 February 2025, Buffett&#x27;s estimated net worth stood at US$149.6 billion, making him the seventh richest individual in the world.

Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska. The son of US congressman and businessman Howard Buffett, he developed an interest in business and investing during his youth. He entered the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1947 before graduating from the University of Nebraska at 20. He went on to graduate from Columbia Business School, where he molded his investment philosophy around the concept of value investing pioneered by Benjamin Graham. He attended New York Institute of Finance to focus on his economics background and soon pursued a business career.

He later began various business ventures and investment partnerships, including one with Graham. He created Buffett Partnership Ltd. in 1956 and his investment firm eventually acquired a textile manufacturing firm, Berkshire Hathaway, assuming its name to create a diversified holding company. Buffett emerged as the company&#x27;s chairman and majority shareholder in 1970. In 1978, fellow investor and long-time business associate Charlie Munger joined Buffett as vice-chairman.

Since 1970, Buffett has presided as the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway, one of America&#x27;s foremost holding companies and world&#x27;s leading corporate conglomerates. He has been referred to as the &quot;Oracle&quot; or &quot;Sage&quot; of Omaha by global media as a result of having accumulated a massive fortune derived from his business and investment success. He is noted for his adherence to the principles of value investing, and his frugality despite his wealth. Buffett has pledged to give away 99 percent of his fortune to philanthropic causes, primarily via the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. He founded the Giving Pledge in 2010 with Bill Gates, whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their fortunes.

==Early life and education==
Warren Edward Buffett was born on August 30, 1930, in Omaha, Nebraska, as the second of three children and the only son of Leila (née Stahl) and Congressman Howard Buffett. He began his education at Rose Hill Elementary School. In 1942, his father was elected to the first of four terms in the United States Congress, and after moving with his family to Washington, D.C., Warren finished elementary school, attended Alice Deal Junior High School and graduated from what was then Woodrow Wilson High School in 1947, where his senior yearbook picture reads: &quot;likes math; a future stockbroker&quot;. After finishing high school and finding success with his side entrepreneurial and investment ventures, Buffett wanted to skip college to go directly into business but was overruled by his father.

Buffett showcased an interest in business and investing at a young age. He was inspired by a book he borrowed from the Omaha public library at age seven, &quot;One Thousand Ways to Make $1000&quot;. Much of Buffett&#x27;s early childhood years were enlivened with entrepreneurial ventures. In one of his first business ventures, Buffett sold chewing gum, Coca-Cola, and weekly magazines door to door. He worked in his grandfather&#x27;s grocery store. While still in high school, he made money delivering newspapers, selling golf balls and stamps, and detailing cars, among other means. On his first income tax return in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction for the use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route. In 1945, as a high school sophomore, Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used pinball machine, which they placed in the local barber shop. Within months, they owned several machines in three different barber shops across Omaha. They later sold the business to a war veteran for $1,200.
Buffett&#x27;s interest in the stock market and investing dated back to his schoolboy days spent in the customers&#x27; lounge of a regional stock brokerage near his father&#x27;s own brokerage office. His father took interest in cultivating and educating the young Warren&#x27;s curiosity surrounding the subject of business and investing, even at one point taking him to visit the New York Stock Exchange when he was 10. At 11, he bought three shares of Cities Service Preferred for himself, and three for his sister Doris Buffett (who also became a philanthropist). At 15, Warren made more than $175 monthly delivering &quot;Washington Post&quot; newspapers. In high school, he invested in a business owned by his father and bought a 40-acre farm worked by a tenant farmer. He bought the land when he was 14 years old with $1,200 of his savings. By the time he finished college, Buffett had amassed $9,800 in savings (about $ today).

In 1947, Buffett matriculated at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He would have preferred to focus on his business ventures, but enrolled due to pressure from his father. Warren studied there for two years and joined the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. He then transferred to the University of Nebraska where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in business administration in 1951. After being rejected by Harvard Business School in the spring of 1950, Buffett enrolled at Columbia Business School of Columbia University upon learning that Benjamin Graham taught there. He earned a Master of Science in economics from Columbia in 1951. After graduating, Buffett attended the New York Institute of Finance.

==Business career==
===Early business career===
Buffett worked from 1951 to 1954 at his father&#x27;s firm, Buffett-Falk &amp; Co., as an investment salesman; from 1954 to 1956 at Graham-Newman Corp. as a securities analyst; from 1956 to 1969 at several investment partnerships as the general partner; and from 1970 as chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

In 1951, Buffett discovered that Graham was on the board of GEICO insurance. Taking a train to Washington, D.C., on a Saturday, he knocked on the door of GEICO&#x27;s headquarters until a janitor admitted him. There he met Lorimer Davidson, GEICO&#x27;s vice president, and the two discussed the insurance business for hours, and Buffett made his first purchase of GEICO stock. Davidson would eventually become Buffett&#x27;s lifelong friend and a lasting influence, and would later recall that he found Buffett to be an &quot;extraordinary man&quot; after only fifteen minutes. Buffett wanted to work on Wall Street but both his father and Ben Graham urged him not to. He offered to work for Graham for free, but Graham refused.

Buffett returned to Omaha and worked as a stockbroker while taking a Dale Carnegie public speaking course. Using what he learned, he felt confident enough to teach an &quot;Investment Principles&quot; night class at the University of Nebraska-Omaha. The average age of his students was more than twice his own. During this time he also purchased a Sinclair gas station as a side investment but it was unsuccessful.

In 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham&#x27;s partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year (about $ today). There he worked closely with Walter Schloss. Graham was adamant that stock picks should provide a wide margin of safety after weighing the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. In 1956, Benjamin Graham retired and closed his partnership. At this time Buffett, who had amassed personal savings over $174,000 (about $ million today), decided to return to Omaha, where he would quickly start a series of investment partnerships.

In 1957, Buffett operated three investment partnerships. By 1959, the total had grown to six partnerships. That summer, Buffett was introduced to his future partner Charlie Munger during a business luncheon at The Omaha Club. In 1961, Buffett revealed that 35% of the partnership&#x27;s assets were invested in the Sanborn Map Company. He explained that Sanborn stock sold for only $45 per share in 1958, but the company&#x27;s investment portfolio was worth $65 per share. This meant that Sanborn&#x27;s map business was being valued at &quot;minus $20&quot;. Buffett eventually purchased 23% of the company&#x27;s outstanding shares as an activist investor, obtaining a seat for himself on the board of directors, and allied with other dissatisfied shareholders to control 44% of the shares. To avoid a proxy fight, the board offered to repurchase shares at fair value, paying with a portion of its investment portfolio. 77% of the outstanding shares were turned in. Buffett had reaped a 50 percent return on investment in just two years.

===Assuming Berkshire===
In 1962, Buffett became a millionaire with the success of his partnerships, which by then had grown to 11 entities and held in excess of $7,178,500, of which over $1,025,000 belonged to Buffett. At the start of the year, he merged the various partnerships into the single entity Buffett Partnership, Ltd., which would be his primary investment vehicle for the remainder of the decade. Buffett invested in and eventually took control of a textile manufacturing company, Berkshire Hathaway. He began buying shares in Berkshire from Seabury Stanton, the owner, whom he later fired. Buffett&#x27;s partnerships began purchasing shares at $7.60 per share. In 1965, when Buffett&#x27;s partnerships began purchasing Berkshire aggressively, they paid $14.86 per share while the company had working capital of $19 per share. This did not include the value of fixed assets (factory and equipment). Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway at a board meeting and named a new president, Ken Chace, to run the company. In 1966, Buffett closed the partnership to new money. He later claimed that the textile business had been his worst trade. He then moved the business into the insurance sector, and, in 1985, the last of the mills that had been the core business of Berkshire Hathaway was sold.

In a second letter, Buffett announced his first investment in a private business — Hochschild, Kohn and Co, a privately owned Baltimore department store. In 1967, Berkshire paid out its first and only dividend of 10 cents. In 1969, Buffett liquidated the partnership and transferred their assets to his partners including shares of Berkshire Hathaway. He lived solely on his salary of $50,000 per year and his outside investment income.

In 1973, Berkshire began to acquire stock in the Washington Post Company. Buffett became close friends with Katharine Graham, who controlled the company and its flagship newspaper and joined its board. In 1974, the SEC opened a formal investigation into Buffett and Berkshire&#x27;s acquisition of Wesco Financial, due to possible conflict of interest. No charges were brought. In 1977, Berkshire indirectly purchased the &quot;Buffalo Evening News&quot; for $32.5 million. Antitrust charges started, instigated by its rival, the &quot;Buffalo Courier-Express&quot;. Both papers lost money until the &quot;Courier-Express&quot; folded in 1982.

In 1979, Berkshire began to acquire stock in ABC. Capital Cities announced a $3.5 billion purchase of ABC on March 18, 1985, surprising the media industry, as ABC was four times bigger than Capital Cities at the time. Buffett helped finance the deal in return for a 25% stake in the combined company. The newly merged company, known as Capital Cities/ABC (or CapCities/ABC), was forced to sell some stations due to Federal Communications Commission ownership rules. The two companies also owned several radio stations in the same markets.

In 1987, Berkshire Hathaway purchased a 12% stake in Salomon Inc., making it the largest shareholder and Buffett a director. In 1990, a scandal involving John Gutfreund (former CEO of Salomon Brothers) surfaced. A rogue trader, Paul Mozer, was submitting bids in excess of what was allowed by Treasury rules. When this was brought to Gutfreund&#x27;s attention, he did not immediately suspend the rogue trader. Gutfreund left the company in August 1991. Buffett became chairman of Salomon until the crisis passed. In 1988, Buffett began buying The Coca-Cola Company stock, eventually purchasing up to 7% of the company for $1.02 billion. It would turn out to be one of Berkshire&#x27;s most lucrative investments and one which it still holds.

===As a billionaire===
In 1998 Buffett acquired General Re (Gen Re) as a subsidiary in a deal that presented difficulties — according to the &quot;Rational Walk&quot; investment website, &quot;underwriting standards proved to be inadequate&quot;, while a &quot;problematic derivatives book&quot; was resolved after numerous years and a significant loss. Gen Re later provided reinsurance after Buffett became involved with Maurice R. Greenberg at AIG in 2002.

During a 2005 investigation of an accounting fraud case involving AIG, Gen Re executives became implicated. On March 15, 2005, the AIG board forced Greenberg to resign from his post as chairman and CEO after New York state regulators claimed that AIG had engaged in questionable transactions and improper accounting. On February 9, 2006, AIG agreed to pay a $1.6 billion fine. In 2010, the U.S. government agreed to a $92 million settlement with Gen Re, allowing the Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary to avoid prosecution in the AIG case. Gen Re also made a commitment to implement &quot;corporate governance concessions&quot;, which required Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s chief financial officer to attend General Re&#x27;s audit committee meetings and mandated the appointment of an independent director.

In 2002, Buffett entered in $11 billion worth of forward contracts to deliver U.S. dollars against other currencies. By April 2006, his total gain on these contracts was over $2 billion. Buffett announced in June 2006 that he would gradually give away 85% of his Berkshire holdings to five foundations in annual gifts of stock, starting in July 2006—the largest contribution going to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2007, in a letter to shareholders, Buffett announced that he was looking for a younger successor, or perhaps successors, to run his investment business.

===2007–08 financial crisis===
Buffett ran into criticism during the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007 and 2008, part of the Great Recession starting in 2007, that he had allocated capital too early resulting in suboptimal deals. &quot;Buy American. I am.&quot; he wrote for an opinion piece published in the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2008. Buffett called the downturn in the financial sector that started in 2007 &quot;poetic justice&quot;. Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway suffered a 77% drop in earnings during Q3 2008 and several of his later deals suffered large mark-to-market losses.

On September 23, 2008, Berkshire Hathaway acquired 10 percent of perpetual preferred stock of Goldman Sachs. Some of Buffett&#x27;s put options (European exercise at expiry only) that he wrote (sold) were running at around $6.73 billion mark-to-market losses as of late 2008. The scale of the potential loss prompted the SEC to demand that Berkshire produce, &quot;a more robust disclosure&quot; of factors used to value the contracts. Buffett also helped Dow Chemical pay for its $18.8 billion takeover of Rohm &amp; Haas. He thus became the single largest shareholder in the enlarged group with his Berkshire Hathaway, which provided $3 billion, underlining his instrumental role during the crisis in debt and equity markets.

In 2008, Buffett became the richest person in the world, garnering a total net worth estimated at $62 billion by Forbes and at $58 billion by Yahoo, dethroning Bill Gates, who had been number one on the Forbes list for 13 consecutive years. In 2009, Gates regained the top position on the Forbes list, with Buffett shifted to second place. Both of the men&#x27;s values dropped, to $40 billion and $37 billion respectively—according to Forbes, Buffett lost $25 billion over a 12-month period during 2008/2009.

In October 2008, the media reported that Buffett had agreed to buy General Electric (GE) preferred stock. The operation included special incentives: he received an option to buy three billion shares of GE stock, at $22.25, over the five years following the agreement, and Buffett also received a 10% dividend (callable within three years). In February 2009, Buffett sold some Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Johnson &amp; Johnson shares from his personal portfolio. In addition to suggestions of mistiming, the wisdom in keeping some of Berkshire&#x27;s major holdings, including The Coca-Cola Company, which in 1998 peaked at $86, raised questions. Buffett discussed the difficulties of knowing when to sell in the company&#x27;s 2004 annual report:

That may seem easy to do when one looks through an always-clean, rear-view mirror. Unfortunately, however, it&#x27;s the windshield through which investors must peer, and that glass is invariably fogged.

In March 2009, Buffett said in a cable television interview that the economy had &quot;fallen off a cliff ... Not only has the economy slowed down a lot, but people have really changed their habits like I haven&#x27;t seen&quot;. Additionally, Buffett feared that inflation levels that occurred in the 1970s—which led to years of painful stagflation—might re-emerge.

===A capitalized Berkshire===
In 2009, Buffett invested $2.6 billion as a part of Swiss Re&#x27;s campaign to raise equity capital. Berkshire Hathaway already owned a 3% stake, with rights to own more than 20%. Also in 2009, Buffett acquired Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. for $34 billion in cash and stock. Alice Schroeder, author of &quot;Snowball&quot;, said that a key reason for the purchase was to diversify Berkshire Hathaway from the financial industry. Measured by market capitalization in the Financial Times Global 500, Berkshire Hathaway was the eighteenth largest corporation in the world as of June 2009.

In 2009, Buffett divested his failed investment in ConocoPhillips, saying to his Berkshire investors,

I bought a large amount of ConocoPhillips stock when oil and gas prices were near their peak. I in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred in the last half of the year. I still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current $40–$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong. Even if prices should rise, moreover, the terrible timing of my purchase has cost Berkshire several billion dollars.

The merger with the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) closed upon BNSF shareholder approval during Q1 of 2010. This deal was valued at approximately $44 billion (with $10 billion of outstanding BNSF debt) and represented an increase of the previously existing stake of 22%.
In June 2010, Buffett defended the credit-rating agencies for their role in the US financial crisis, claiming:

Very, very few people could appreciate the bubble. That&#x27;s the nature of bubbles—they&#x27;re mass delusions.

On March 18, 2011, Goldman Sachs was given Federal Reserve approval to buy back Berkshire&#x27;s preferred stock in Goldman. Buffett had been reluctant to give up the stock, which averaged $1.4 million in dividends per day, saying:

I&#x27;m going to be the Osama bin Laden of capitalism. I&#x27;m on my way to an unknown destination in Asia where I&#x27;m going to look for a cave. If the U.S. Armed forces can&#x27;t find Osama bin Laden in 10 years, let Goldman Sachs try to find me.

In November 2011, it was announced that over the course of the previous eight months, Buffett had bought 64 million shares of International Business Machine Corp (IBM) stock, worth around $11 billion. This unanticipated investment raised his stake in the company to around 5.5 percent—the largest stake in IBM alongside that of State Street Global Advisors. Buffett had said on numerous prior occasions that he would not invest in technology because he did not fully understand it, so the move came as a surprise to many investors and observers. During the interview, in which he revealed the investment to the public, Buffett stated that he was impressed by the company&#x27;s ability to retain corporate clients and said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know of any large company that really has been as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM&quot;.

In May 2012, Buffett&#x27;s acquisition of Media General, consisting of 63 newspapers in the south-eastern U.S., was announced. The company was the second news print purchase made by Buffett in one year. Interim publisher James W. Hopson announced on July 18, 2013, that the &quot;Press of Atlantic City&quot; would be sold to Buffett&#x27;s BH Media Group by ABARTA, a private holding company based in Pittsburgh, U.S. At the Berkshire shareholders meeting in May 2013, Buffett explained that he did not expect to &quot;move the needle&quot; at Berkshire with newspaper acquisitions, but he anticipates an annual return of 10 percent. The &quot;Press of Atlantic City&quot; became Berkshire&#x27;s 30th daily newspaper, following other purchases such as Virginia, U.S.&#x27; &quot;Roanoke Times&quot; and &quot;The Tulsa World&quot; in Oklahoma, U.S.

During a presentation to Georgetown University students in Washington, D.C., in late September 2013, Buffett compared the U.S. Federal Reserve to a hedge fund and stated that the bank is generating &quot;$80 billion or $90 billion a year probably&quot; in revenue for the U.S. government. Buffett also advocated further on the issue of wealth equality in society:

We have learned to turn out lots of goods and services, but we haven&#x27;t learned as well how to have everybody share in the bounty. The obligation of a society as prosperous as ours is to figure out how nobody gets left too far behind.

After the difficulties of the economic crisis, Buffett managed to bring its company back to its pre-recession standards: in Q2 2014, Berkshire Hathaway made $6.4 billion in net profit, the most it had ever made in a three-month period. On August 14, 2014, the price of Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s shares hit $200,000 a share for the first time, capitalizing the company at $328 billion. While Buffett had given away much of his stock to charities by this time, he still held 321,000 shares worth $64.2 billion. On August 20, 2014, Berkshire Hathaway was fined $896,000 for failing to report as required the December 9, 2013 purchase of shares in USG Corporation.

A 2023 ProPublica article based on a leak of confidential IRS data alleged that Buffett had made equity trades in his personal portfolio involving companies that Berkshire Hathaway bought or sold during the same quarter or the quarter before, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. On three dates between 2009 and 2012, Buffett sold shares of Johnson and Johnson, Walmart, and Wells Fargo, with the sales totaling $80 million in value. Although Buffett has not commented, Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s Vice Chairman Charlie Munger dismissed the allegations, saying &quot;I don’t think there’s the slightest chance that Warren Buffett is doing something that is deeply evil to make money for himself.&quot;

==Investment philosophy==
Buffett&#x27;s writings include his annual reports and various articles. Buffett is recognized by communicators as a great story-teller, as evidenced by his annual letters to shareholders. He has warned about the pernicious effects of inflation:

In his article, &quot;The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville&quot;, Buffett rebutted the academic efficient-market hypothesis, that beating the S&amp;P 500 was &quot;pure chance&quot;, by highlighting the results achieved by a number of students of the Graham and Dodd value investing school of thought. In addition to himself, Buffett named Walter J. Schloss, Tom Knapp, Ed Anderson (Tweedy, Browne LLC), William J. Ruane (Sequoia Fund), Charlie Munger (Buffett&#x27;s partner at Berkshire), Rick Guerin (Pacific Partners Ltd.), and Stan Perlmeter (Perlmeter Investments). In his November 1999 &quot;Fortune&quot; article, he warned of investors&#x27; unrealistic expectations:

===Index funds vis-à-vis active management===

Buffett has been a supporter of index funds for people who are either not interested in managing their own money or do not have the time. Buffett is skeptical that active management can outperform the market in the long run, and has advised both individual and institutional investors to move their money to low-cost index funds that track broad, diversified stock market indices. Buffett said in one of his letters to shareholders that &quot;when trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients&quot;. In 2007, Buffett made a bet with numerous managers that a simple S&amp;P 500 index fund will outperform hedge funds that charge exorbitant fees. By 2017, the index fund was outperforming every hedge fund that made the bet against Buffett.

=== Using investment banks ===
Buffet has a long-standing aversion to using the services of investment banks via Berkshire Hathaway. This dynamic was also reported in Barron&#x27;s, Insider, and Seeking Alpha, among others.

==Personal life==
In 1949, Buffett developed a crush on a young woman whose boyfriend had a ukulele. In an attempt to compete, he bought one of the instruments and has been playing it ever since. Though the attempt to capture her attention was unsuccessful, his music interest became a key part of his becoming a part of Susan Thompson&#x27;s life, and led to their marriage. Buffett often plays the instrument at stockholder meetings and other opportunities. His love of the instrument led to the commissioning of two custom Dairy Queen ukuleles by Dave Talsma, one of which was auctioned for charity.

In 1952, Buffett married Susan at Dundee Presbyterian Church. The following year, they had their first child, Susan Alice. She was followed by Howard (b. 1954) and Peter (b. 1958). The couple began living separately in 1977, although they remained married until Susan&#x27;s death in July 2004. Their only daughter Susan lives in Omaha, is a national board member of Girls, Inc., and does charitable work through the Susan A. Buffett Foundation.

In 2006, on his 76th birthday, Buffett married his longtime companion, Astrid Menks, who was then 60 years old—she had lived with him since his wife&#x27;s departure to San Francisco in 1977. Susan had arranged for the two to meet before she left Omaha to pursue her singing career. All three were close and Christmas cards to friends were signed &quot;Warren, Susie and Astrid&quot;. Susan briefly discussed this relationship in an interview on the &quot;Charlie Rose Show&quot; shortly before her death, in a rare glimpse into Buffett&#x27;s personal life.

Buffett disowned his son Peter&#x27;s adopted daughter, Nicole, in 2006 after she participated in the Jamie Johnson documentary &quot;The One Percent&quot; about the growing economic inequality between the wealthy and the average citizen in the United States. Although his first wife referred to Nicole as one of her &quot;adored grandchildren&quot;, Buffett wrote Nicole a letter stating, &quot;I have not emotionally or legally adopted you as a grandchild, nor have the rest of my family adopted you as a niece or a cousin&quot;. By 2022, Buffett and she had reconciled.
His 2006 annual salary was about $100,000, which is small compared to senior executive remuneration in comparable companies. In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $175,000, which included a base salary of just $100,000. In 1958, Buffett purchased a five-bedroom stucco house in Omaha, where he still lives, for . He also owned a vacation home in Laguna Beach, California, which he purchased for $150,000 in 1971. He sold it for $7.5 million in 2018. In 1989, after spending nearly $6.7 million of Berkshire&#x27;s funds on a private jet, Buffett named it &quot;The Indefensible&quot;, later renamed &quot;The Indispensable&quot;. This act was at odds with his past condemnation of extravagant spending by other CEOs. Buffett sold the jet prior to mid-1999, and has since usually flown with Berkshire&#x27;s flight services businesses.

Buffett is an avid bridge player, which he plays with Gates and champion player Sharon Osberg; he is said to spend 12 hours a week playing the game. In 2006, he sponsored a bridge match for the Buffett Cup. Modeled on the Ryder Cup in golf—held immediately before it in the same city—the teams are chosen by invitation, with a female team and five male teams provided by each country.

He is a dedicated, lifelong follower of Nebraska football, and attends as many games as his schedule permits. He supported the hire of Bo Pelini, following the 2007 season, stating, &quot;It was getting kind of desperate around here&quot;. He watched the 2009 game against Oklahoma from the Nebraska sideline, after being named an honorary assistant coach. Buffett was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2009. Buffett worked with Christopher Webber on an animated series called &quot;Secret Millionaires Club&quot; with chief Andy Heyward of DiC Entertainment. The series features Buffett and Munger and teaches children healthy financial habits.

Buffett was raised as a Presbyterian, but has since described himself as agnostic. In December 2006, it was reported that Buffett did not carry a mobile phone, did not have a computer at his desk, and drove his own automobile, a Cadillac DTS. In contrast to that, at the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s shareholder meeting, he stated he uses Google as his preferred search engine. In 2013 he had an old Nokia flip phone and had sent one email in his entire life. In February 2020, Buffett revealed in a CNBC interview that he had traded in his flip phone for an iPhone 11. Buffett reads five newspapers every day, beginning with the &quot;Omaha World Herald&quot;, which his company acquired in 2011.

Buffett&#x27;s speeches are known for mixing business discussions with humor. Each year, Buffett presides over Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s annual shareholder meeting in the Qwest Center in Omaha, Nebraska, an event drawing over 20,000 visitors from both the United States and abroad, giving it the nickname &quot;Woodstock of Capitalism&quot;. Berkshire&#x27;s annual reports and letters to shareholders, prepared by Buffett, frequently receive coverage by the financial media. Buffett&#x27;s writings are known for containing quotations from sources as varied as the Bible and Mae West, as well as advice in a folksy, Midwestern style and numerous jokes.

In April 2017, Buffett (an avid Coca-Cola drinker and shareholder in the company) agreed to have his likeness placed on Cherry Coke products in China. Buffett was not compensated for this advertisement. Buffett is very distantly related to the 44th president of the United States, Barack Obama. Buffett was a longtime friend of singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett until Jimmy&#x27;s death in September 2023, and they would often refer to one another as &quot;Uncle Warren&quot; and &quot;Cousin Jimmy&quot;. The two took a DNA test which revealed no relation.

===Health===
Buffett is a teetotaler. On April 11, 2012, Buffett was diagnosed with stage I prostate cancer during a routine test. He announced he would begin two months of daily radiation treatment from mid-July. In a letter to shareholders, Buffett said he felt &quot;great—as if I were in my normal excellent health—and my energy level is 100 percent&quot;. On September 15, 2012, Buffett announced that he had completed the full 44-day radiation treatment cycle, saying &quot;it&#x27;s a great day for me&quot; and &quot;I am so glad to say that&#x27;s over&quot;.

==Wealth and philanthropy==
 In 2008, Buffett was ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; as the richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of approximately $62 billion. In 2009, after donating billions of dollars to charity, he was ranked as the second richest man in the United States with a net worth of $37 billion with only Bill Gates ranked higher than Buffett. His net worth had risen to $58.5 billion as of September 2013.

In 1999, Buffett was named the Top Money Manager of the Twentieth Century in a survey by the Carson Group, ahead of Peter Lynch and John Templeton. In 2007, he was listed among &quot;Time&quot; 100 Most Influential People in the world. In 2011, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Buffett, along with Bill Gates, was named the most influential global thinker in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;&#x27;s 2010 report.

Buffett has written several times of his belief that, in a market economy, the rich earn outsized rewards for their talents. His children will not inherit a significant proportion of his wealth. He once commented, &quot;I want to give my kids just enough so that they would feel that they could do anything, but not so much that they would feel like doing nothing&quot;.

Buffett had long stated his intention to give away his fortune to charity, and in June 2006, he announced a new plan to give 83% of it to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). He pledged about the equivalent of 10 million Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (worth approximately $30.7 billion as of June 23, 2006), making it the largest charitable donation in history, and Buffett one of the leaders of philanthrocapitalism. The foundation will receive 5% of the total each July, beginning in 2006. The pledge is conditional upon three requirements:
*Bill or Melinda Gates must be alive and active in BMGF
*BMGF must continue to qualify as a charity
*Each year BMGF must give away an amount equal to the prior year&#x27;s Berkshire gift plus the additional 5% of net assets as required of all US foundations

Buffett joined the Gates Foundation&#x27;s board, but did not plan to be actively involved in the foundation&#x27;s investments. Buffett announced his resignation as a trustee of the Gates Foundation on June 23, 2021. This represented a significant shift from Buffett&#x27;s previous statements, to the effect that most of his fortune would pass to his Buffett Foundation. The bulk of the estate of his wife, valued at $2.6 billion, went there when she died in 2004. He also pledged $50 million to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, in Washington, where he began serving as an adviser in 2002.

In 2006, he auctioned his 2001 Lincoln Town Car on eBay to raise money for Girls, Inc. In 2007, he auctioned a luncheon with himself that raised a final bid of $650,100 for the Glide Foundation. Later auctions raised $2.1 million, $1.7 million and $3.5 million. The winners traditionally dine with Buffett at New York&#x27;s Smith and Wollensky steak house. The restaurant donates at least $10,000 to Glide each year to host the meal.

In 2009, Ralph Nader wrote the book &quot;Only the Super Rich Can Save Us&quot;, a novel about &quot;a movement of billionaires led by Warren Buffett and featuring, among others, Ted Turner, George Soros and Barry Diller, who use their fortunes to clean up America&quot;. On C-SPAN BookTV, Nader said Buffett invited him to breakfast after the book came out and was &quot;quite intrigued by the book&quot;. He also told Nader of his plan to get &quot;billionaires all over the world to donate 50% of their estate to charity or good works&quot;. On December 9, 2010, Buffett, Bill Gates, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg signed a promise they called the &quot;Gates-Buffett Giving Pledge&quot;, in which they promise to donate to charity at least half of their wealth, and invite other wealthy people to follow suit. In 2018, after making almost $3.4 billion donations, Buffett was ranked 3rd in the &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; List of Billionaires 2018.

Buffett continues to help fund and support his family&#x27;s individual foundations which include Susan Buffett&#x27;s &quot;Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation&quot;, Susan Alice Buffett&#x27;s &quot;Sherwood Foundation&quot;, Howard Graham Buffett&#x27;s &quot;Howard G. Buffett Foundation&quot;, and Peter Buffett&#x27;s &quot;NoVo Foundation&quot;. Warren Buffett was also supportive of his sister Doris Buffett&#x27;s &quot;Letters Foundation&quot; and &quot;Learning By Giving Foundation&quot;.

In November 2022, Buffett made a donation of $750 million in Berkshire Hathaway shares to four charitable foundations run by his children. 1.5 million Class B shares of his conglomerate to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named after his first wife. He also transferred 300,000 Class B shares each to three funds managed by his children: the Sherwood Foundation, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation and the NoVo Foundation. , Buffett has given over $50 billion to charitable causes.

==Political and public policy views==

In addition to political contributions over the years, Buffett endorsed and made campaign contributions to Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign. On July 2, 2008, Buffett attended a $28,500 per plate fundraiser for Obama&#x27;s campaign in Chicago. Buffett intimated that John McCain&#x27;s views on social justice were so far from his own that McCain would need a &quot;lobotomy&quot; for Buffett to change his endorsement. During the second 2008 U.S. presidential debate, McCain and Obama, after being asked first by presidential debate mediator Tom Brokaw, both mentioned Buffett as a possible future Secretary of the Treasury. Later, in the third and final presidential debate, Obama mentioned Buffett as a potential economic advisor. Buffett was also a financial advisor to Republican candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger during the 2003 California gubernatorial election.

On December 16, 2015, Buffett endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for president. On August 1, 2016, Buffett challenged Donald Trump to release his tax returns. On October 10, 2016, after a reference to him in the second presidential debate, Buffett released his own tax return. He said he had paid $1.85 million in federal income taxes in 2015 on an adjusted gross income of $11.6 million, meaning he had an effective federal income tax rate of around 16 percent. Buffett also said he had made more than $2.8 billion worth of donations last year. In response to Trump saying he was unable to release his tax information due to being under audit, Buffett said, &quot;I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited. I have no problem in releasing my tax information while under audit. Neither would Mr. Trump—at least he would have no legal problem.&quot; Buffett has said he would judge President Donald Trump by his results on national safety, economic growth and economic participation when deciding if he would vote for him in the 2020 presidential election.

===Health care===
Buffett described the health care reform under President Barack Obama as insufficient to deal with the costs of health care in the US, though he supports its aim of expanding health insurance coverage. Buffett compared health care costs to a tapeworm, saying that they compromise US economic competitiveness by increasing manufacturing costs. Buffett said in 2010 that it was not sustainable for the U.S. to devote 17% of its GDP to healthcare expenditure, noting that many other nations spent a much smaller proportion of their GDP on health expenditures, with better healthcare outcomes. Buffett said, &quot;If you want the very best, I mean if you want to spend a million dollars to prolong your life 3 months in a coma or something then the US is probably the best&quot;, but he also said that other countries spend much less and receive much more in health care value (visits, hospital beds, doctors and nurses per capita).

Buffett faults the incentives in the United States medical industry, that payers reimburse doctors for procedures (fee-for-service) leading to unnecessary care (overutilization), instead of paying for results. He cited Atul Gawande&#x27;s 2009 article in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; as a useful consideration of US health care, with its documentation of unwarranted variation in Medicare expenditures between McAllen, Texas and El Paso, Texas. Buffett raised the problem of lobbying by the medical industry, saying that they are very focused on maintaining their income.

===Curbing population growth===
Buffett has expressed concerns about unchecked population growth. In 2009, he met with several other billionaires to discuss healthcare, education and slowing population growth. Called &quot;The Good Club&quot; by an insider, the billionaires had given away $45 billion to philanthropic causes and included Oprah Winfrey, Michael Bloomberg and David Rockefeller, Jr. The meeting has drawn criticism from some right-wing blogs, with some believing the group to be a part of a secret sterilization society. Buffett is a long-time supporter of family planning. The Buffett Foundation has given over $1.5 billion to abortion research to include $427 million to Planned Parenthood.

===Taxes===
Buffett stated that he only paid 19% of his income for 2006 ($48.1 million) in total federal taxes (due to their source as dividends and capital gains) while his employees paid 33% of theirs, despite making much less money. Regarding how little he pays in taxes compared to his employees, he said, &quot;How can this be fair? How can this be right? There&#x27;s class warfare, all right, but it&#x27;s my class, the rich class, that&#x27;s making war, and we&#x27;re winning.&quot; After Donald Trump accused him of taking &quot;massive deductions&quot;, Buffett countered, &quot;I have copies of all 72 of my returns and none uses a carryforward.&quot;

Buffett favors the inheritance tax, saying that repealing it would be like &quot;choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the 2000 Olympics&quot;. In 2007, Buffett testified before the Senate and urged them to preserve the estate tax so as to avoid a plutocracy. Some critics argued that Buffett (through Berkshire Hathaway) has a personal interest in the continuation of the estate tax, since Berkshire Hathaway benefited from the estate tax in past business dealings and had developed and marketed insurance policies to protect policy holders against future estate tax payments. Buffett believes government should not be in the business of gambling, or legalizing casinos, calling it a tax on ignorance.

===Dollar and gold===
The trade deficit induced Buffett to enter the foreign currency market for the first time in 2002. He substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett remained bearish on the dollar, stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues. Buffett has been critical of gold as an investment, with his critique being based primarily on its non-productive nature. In a 1998 address at Harvard, Buffett said:

It gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.

In 1977, about stocks, gold, farmland and inflation, he stated:

Stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation—at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices.

===China===
Buffett invested in PetroChina Company Limited and in a rare move, posted a commentary on Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s website stating why he would not divest over its connection with the Sudanese civil war that caused Harvard to divest. He sold this stake soon afterwards, sparing him the billions of dollars he would have lost had he held on to the company in the midst of the steep drop in oil prices beginning in the summer of 2008. In October 2008, Buffett invested $230 million for 10% of battery maker BYD Company (), which runs a subsidiary of electric automobile manufacturer BYD Auto. In less than one year, the investment reaped over 500% return.

===Tobacco===
During the RJR Nabisco, Inc., hostile takeover fight in 1987, Buffett was quoted as telling John Gutfreund:

Speaking at Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&#x27;s 1994 annual meeting, Buffett said investments in tobacco are:

===Coal===
In 2007, Buffett&#x27;s PacifiCorp, a subsidiary of his MidAmerican Energy Company, canceled six proposed coal-fired power plants. These included Utah&#x27;s Intermountain Power Project Unit 3, Jim Bridger Unit 5, and four proposed plants previously included in PacifiCorp&#x27;s Integrated Resource Plan. The cancellations came in the wake of pressure from regulators and citizen groups.

===Renewable energy===
Native American tribes and salmon fishermen sought to win support from Buffett for a proposal to remove four hydroelectric dams from the Klamath River owned by PacifiCorp which is a Berkshire Hathaway company. David Sokol responded on Buffett&#x27;s behalf, stating that the FERC would decide the question.

===Expensing of stock options===
He has been a strong proponent of stock option expensing on corporate income statements. At the 2004 annual meeting, he lambasted a bill before the United States Congress that would consider only some company-issued stock options compensation as an expense, likening the bill to one that was almost passed by the Indiana House of Representatives to change the value of Pi from 3.14159 to 3.2 through legislative fiat.

When a company gives something of value to its employees in return for their services, it is clearly a compensation expense. And if expenses don&#x27;t belong in the earnings statement, where in the world do they belong?

===High technology===
In May 2012, Buffett said he had avoided buying stock in high-technology companies such as Facebook and Google due to them being complex and difficult to understand on top of their concomitant complications from being hard to confidently estimate their future value. He also stated that initial public offering&#x27;s (IPO) of new stock issues are almost always bad investments. Buffett has advised investors to look for companies that will have good value in ten years.

===Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies===
In an interview with CNBC in January 2018, Buffett said the recent craze over Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies won&#x27;t end well, adding that &quot;when it happens or how or anything else, I don&#x27;t know;&quot; and later that year calling it, &quot;rat poison squared.&quot; But he also said he would not take a short position on bitcoin futures.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
In a June 2021 interview with CNBC, Buffet said that the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic inequality and bemoaned that most people are unaware that &quot;hundreds of thousands or millions&quot; of small businesses have been negatively impacted. He also stated that the markets and the economy will likely be unpredictable well into the post-pandemic recovery period, even with the Biden administration and the United States Federal Reserve having a plan in place. He said the unpredictability and the effects of COVID-19 are far from over.

==Film and television==
Aside from countless television appearances on various news programs (Adam Smith&#x27;s Money World in 1985 reportedly being the first), Buffett has appeared in numerous films and TV programs, both documentary, and fiction. Some film and television cameos he has made include &quot;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps&quot; (2010), &quot;The Office&quot; (U.S.), &quot;All My Children,&quot; and &quot;Entourage&quot; (2015). He has been a guest 10 times on &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;, and was the subject of the HBO documentary feature &quot;Becoming Warren Buffett&quot; (2017) and the BBC production &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Money Maker&quot; (2009).

==Bibliography==
===Books about Buffett===
In October 2008, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported at least 47 books were in print with Buffett&#x27;s name in the title. The article quoted the CEO of Borders Books, George Jones, as saying that the only other living persons named in as many book titles were U.S. presidents, world political figures and the Dalai Lama. Buffett said that his own personal favorite is a collection of his essays called &quot;The Essays of Warren Buffett&quot;, which he described as &quot;a coherent rearrangement of ideas from my annual report letters&quot;.

<text>Kamal Fouad Jumblatt (; 6 December 1917 – 16 March 1977) was a Lebanese politician who founded the Progressive Socialist Party. He led the National Movement during the Lebanese Civil War. He was a major ally of the Palestine Liberation Organization until his assassination in 1977. He authored more than 40 books centred on various political, philosophical, literary, religious, medical, social, and economic topics. In September 1972, Kamal Jumblatt received the International Lenin Peace Prize. He is the father of the Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt and the son-in-law of the Arab writer and politician Shakib Arslan.

==Early life and education==

Kamal Jumblatt was born on 6 December 1917 in Moukhtara. He was born into the Jumblatt family, a prestigious Druze family originally from present-day Syria, whose members were traditional leaders of the Lebanese Druze community. His father Fouad Joumblatt, the powerful Druze chieftain and director of the Chouf District, was murdered in an ambush on 6 August 1921. Kamal was just four years old when his father was killed. After his father’s death, his mother Nazira played a significant political role in the Druze community during the following two decades.

In 1926, Kamal Jumblatt joined the Lazarus Fathers Institute in Aintoura, where he completed his elementary studies in 1928. He achieved his high school diploma, having studied French, Arabic, science and literature, in 1936, and a philosophy diploma in 1937.

Jumblatt then pursued higher studies in France, where he attended the Faculty of Arts at the Sorbonne University and obtained a degree in psychology and civil education, and another one in sociology. He returned to Lebanon in 1939, after the outbreak of World War II and continued his studies at Saint Joseph University where he obtained a law degree in 1945.

==Early political career==
Kamal Jumblatt practised law in Lebanon from 1941 to 1942 and was designated the Official State Lawyer for the Lebanese Government. In 1943, at the young age of twenty-six years and following the unexpected death of Hikmat Joumblatt, he became the leader of the Jumblatt clan, bringing him into the Lebanese political scene. Despite his influential political role, throughout his career, he was in a rivalry over the political leadership over the Lebanese Druze with Majid Arslan. Arslan was often preferred to represent the Druze faction and the longest serving Minister in Lebanese politics and served 22 terms as the Lebanese Defense Minister. In September 1943 Kamal Jumblatt was elected to the National Assembly for the first time, as a deputy of Mount Lebanon. He joined the National Bloc led by Émile Eddé, thus opposing the rule of the Constitutional Bloc, headed by the then-President, Bechara El Khoury. On 8 November 1943, however, he signed the constitutional amendment (which abolished the articles referring to the Mandate) demanded by the Constitutional Bloc. On 14 December 1946, he was appointed minister for the first time, for the portfolio of economy, in Riad Al Solh&#x27;s cabinet. His term was from 14 December 1946 to 7 June 1947, and he replaced Saadi Al Munla. Sleiman Nawfal replaced Jumblatt as economy minister.

In 1947, in spite of his own election for the second time as deputy, he thought of resigning from the government. He began to believe that change through the Lebanese political system was impossible.

Kamal Jumblatt officially founded the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) on 1 May 1949. The PSP was a socialist party espousing secularism and officially opposed to the sectarian character of Lebanese politics. In practice, it has been led and largely supported since its foundation by various segments of Lebanese society, especially members of the Druze community, and the Jumblatt clan in particular. In 1949, Jumblatt firmly opposed the execution of political leader Antoun Saadeh and held the government responsible for his assassination. In the name of the PSP, Jumblatt called the first convention of the Arab Socialist Parties, which was held in Beirut in May 1951. Prior to the 1952 elections, Jumblatt declared the formation of the opposition salvation front electoral list in a rally on 18 March 1951 in the village of Barouk, Mount Lebanon. Clashes between Jumblatt&#x27;s supporters and Lebanese security forces led to the death of four, three of them were PSP supporters. After this incident, he gave his famous speech: &quot;Today, our party was baptized with blood&quot;. In the same year, he was re-elected for the third time as Deputy of Mount Lebanon.

Jumblatt regularly published articles in &quot;Al Anbaa&quot;, which was founded by him in 1951. His writings frequently contained criticisms against President Bechara El Khoury. In 1952, he represented Lebanon at the Cultural Freedom Conference held in Switzerland. In August 1952, he organized a National Conference at Deir El Kamar, in the name of the National Socialist Front, calling for the resignation of the President. Due mainly to these pressures, the President resigned the same year.

==The 1958 revolt==

In 1952, after the resignation of Bechara El Khoury Jumblatt&#x27;s bloc nominated Camille Chamoun for the presidency. Chamoun was elected president in September 1952.
In 1953, Jumblatt was re-elected Deputy for the fourth time. He founded the Popular Socialist Front in the same year and led the opposition against the new president, Camille Chamoun. During his presidency, the pro-Western President Chamoun tied Lebanon to the policies of the United States and the United Kingdom, who were at that time involved in the creation of the Baghdad Pact, comprising Hashemite Iraq, Turkey and Pakistan. This was seen by pan-Arabists as an imperialist coalition, and it was strongly opposed by the influential Nasserist movement. Jumblatt supported Egypt against an attack by Israel, France, and the United Kingdom in the Suez War of 1956, while Chamoun and parts of the Maronite Christian elite in Lebanon tacitly supported the invasion. The sectarian tensions of Lebanon greatly increased in this period, and both sides began to brace for violent conflict.

In 1957, Jumblatt failed for the first time in the parliamentary elections, complaining of electoral gerrymandering and election fraud by the authorities. A year later, he was the main leader of a major political uprising against Camille Chamoun&#x27;s Maronite-dominated government, which soon escalated into street fights and guerilla attacks. While the revolt reflected a number of political and sectarian conflicts, it had a pan-Arabist ideology and was heavily supported through Syria by the newly formed United Arab Republic. The uprising ended after the United States intervened on the side of the Chamoun government and sent the U.S. Marine Corps to occupy Beirut. A political settlement followed by which Jumblatt&#x27;s candidate Fuad Chehab was appointed new President of the Republic.

==Uniting the opposition==
Jumblatt chaired the Afro-Asian People&#x27;s Conference in 1960 and founded the same year, the National Struggle Front (NSF) (جبهة النضال الوطني), a movement which gathered a large number of nationalist deputies. That same year, he was reelected Deputy for the fifth time and the NSF won 11 seats within the Lebanese Parliament. From 1960 to 1961 he was Minister for the second time, for the National Education portfolio and then in 1961, he was appointed Minister of Public Work and Planning. From 1961 to 1964 he served as Interior Minister.

On 8 May 1964, he won at the parliamentary elections for the sixth time. In 1965, he began joining Arab nationalist and progressivist politicians into a Nationalist Personalities Front. In 1966, he was appointed Minister of Public Work and Minister of PTT. He also represented Lebanon at the Congress of Afro-Asian Solidarity and presided over the parliamentary and popular delegation to the People’s Republic of China in 1966.

He supported the Palestinians in their struggle against Israel for ideological reasons, but also to garner support from the Palestinian fedayeen based in Lebanon&#x27;s refugee camps. The presence in Lebanon of large numbers of Palestinian refugees was resented by most Christians, but Jumblatt strived to build a hard core of opposition around the Arab nationalist slogans of the Palestinian movement. Demanding a new Lebanese order based on secularism, socialism, Arabism and abolition of the sectarian system, Jumblatt began gathering disenchanted Sunnis, Shi&#x27;a and leftist Christians into an embryonic national opposition movement.

==Build-up to civil war==
On 9 May 1968, Jumblatt was reelected Deputy for the seventh time. In 1970, he was once again appointed Minister of the Interior, a reward for his last-minute switch of allegiance in the presidential election that year, which resulted in Suleiman Franjieh&#x27;s victory by one vote over Elias Sarkis. His support of Franjieh, whose presidency 1970-1976 is regarded as egregiously corrupt, from a sometime supporter of the Chebab reforms, was crucial. As Interior Minister, he legalized the Communist Party (LCP) and the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP). In 1972, Jumblatt was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize by the Soviet Union. The same year, he was reelected Deputy for the eighth time. The following year, he was unanimously elected Secretary General of the Arab Front, a movement supportive of the Palestinian revolution.

The 1970s in Lebanon were characterized by rapidly building tension between the Christian-dominated government and Muslim and leftist opposition forces, demanding better representation in the government apparatus and a stronger Lebanese commitment to the Arab world. The conflict took place more or less along the same sectarian and political lines as the 1958 rebellion.

Both the opposition and their mainly Christian opponents organized armed militias, and the risk of armed conflict increased steadily. Jumblatt had organized his own PSP into an armed force and made it the backbone of the Lebanese National Movement (LNM), a coalition of 12 left-wing parties and movements. He also headed this coalition. The LNM demanded the abolition of the sectarian quota system that permeated Lebanese politics, which discriminated against Muslims. The LNM was further joined by Palestinian radicals of the Rejectionist Front, and maintained good relations with the officially non-committal Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The Palestinian presence in the ranks of the opposition was a new development compared to the 1958 conflict.

==The Lebanese Civil War==
In April 1975, a series of tit-for-tat killings culminating in a Phalangist massacre of Palestinian civilians, prompted full-blown fighting in Beirut. In August 1975, Jumblatt declared a program for reform of the Lebanese political system, and the LNM openly challenged the government&#x27;s legitimacy. In October 1975, a new round of fighting broke out, and quickly spread throughout the country: the Lebanese Civil War had begun.

During the period between 1975 and 1976, Jumblatt acted as the main leader of the Lebanese opposition in the war, and with the aid of the PLO the LNM rapidly gained control over nearly 80% of Lebanon. They were on the verge of military decisiveness and putting the civil war to an end. Jumblatt paid a visit to Hafez al-Assad in March 1976, during which it was made clear that the Syrian position was very contrary to the one of the LNM. This prompted an end of the political relationship between the two political leaders. The Syrian intervened militarily on 1 June 1976, since the Syrian government claimed to fear a collapse of the Christian-dominated order and a subsequent Israeli invasion in order to aid the Christians and control the country, thus furthering Israel&#x27;s influence in the region. However, this claim proved to be wrong for Israelis invaded Southern Lebanon in 1978 under the pretext of defending its northern borders from any possible Syrian aggression. Some 40,000 Syrian soldiers invaded Lebanon in 1976 and quickly smashed the LNM&#x27;s favourable position; a truce was declared and the fighting subsided. During a pan-Arabic conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in the same year, an agreement was signed which included the presence of a Syrian military peacekeeping force under the auspices of the Arab League.

Jumblatt&#x27;s son Walid Jumblatt was kidnapped by Christian militants during the civil war and released after the intervention of former president Camille Chamoun. Kamal Jumblatt was the target of an assassination attempt during the same period. Although he survived, his sister Linda was killed by a group of armed men who burst into their apartment in 1976.

==Personal life==
Born in the Druze faith, Kamal Jumblatt adopted Christian teachings at his alma mater, the Lazarus Fathers Institute in Aintoura. He would regularly attend mass with his fellow students, and was found reciting Catholic prayers several years later over his cousin Hikmat Joumblatt&#x27;s deathbed.

Many of his acquaintances said that he understood the theology of Catholic teaching more than some priests

He was also very interested in Hinduism, in the early 1950s he visited India many times, where he met the Indian ambassador to Lebanon

On 1 May 1948, Jumblatt married May Arslan, daughter of Prince Shakib Arslan (the Arslans being the other prominent Lebanese Druze family), in Geneva. Their only son, Walid Jumblatt, was born on 7 August 1949.

Kamal Jumblatt lectured extensively and wrote more than 1200 editorials in both Arabic and French. He is described as a socialist idealist under the influence of the European left movement. He published his mémoires under the title &quot;I Speak for Lebanon&quot;.

==Death==

On 16 March 1977, Kamal Jumblatt was gunned down in his car near the village of Baakline in the Chouf mountains by unidentified gunmen. His bodyguard and driver also died in the attack.

Prime suspects include the Ba&#x27;ath Party. In June 2005, former secretary general of the Lebanese Communist Party George Hawi claimed in an interview with Al Jazeera, that Rifaat al-Assad, brother of Hafez al-Assad and uncle of Syria&#x27;s President Bashar al-Assad, had been behind the killing of Jumblatt.

His son Walid Jumblatt immediately succeeded him as the main Druze leader of Lebanon and as head of the PSP. He was elected leader of the PSP on 1 May 1977. In 2015, Walid Jumblatt accused two Syrian officers, Ibrahim al-Hiwaija and Mohammed al-Khauli, as being responsible for killing his father.

== Legacy ==
On the centennial anniversary of the birth of Kamal Jumblatt, the Leadership of the Progressive Socialist Party launched the &quot; Kamal Jumblatt Centennial&quot;. During the celebration of this anniversary, a small bust of Kamal Jumblatt with a certificate signed by the PSP chief Walid Jumblatt with a yellow pin badge of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army has been awarded to more than 22,000 PSP supporters, PLA supporters, National Movement supporters, and veterans, all over Lebanon.

<text>Cernaysia is an extinct genus of mammal from the Paleocene of France and the United States. It existed in the age immediately following the extinction of the last dinosaurs. This animal was a member of the extinct order Multituberculata within the suborder Cimolodonta and family Neoplagiaulacidae.

The genus &quot;Cernaysia&quot; (&quot;from Cernay&quot;) was named by Vianey-Liaud M. in 1986 based on two species. It has also been known as &quot;Carnaysia&quot;.

Fossil remains of the species &quot;Cernaysia davidi&quot; (Vianey-Liaud M. 1986) were found in Puercan (Lower Paleocene) strata of the San Juan Basin of New Mexico, (United States). Remains of the species &quot;Cernaysia manueli&quot; (Vianey-Liaud M. 1986) were found in Upper Paleocene strata from Cernay, France.

<text>Nighthawks are nocturnal birds of the subfamily Chordeilinae, within the nightjar family, Caprimulgidae, which is a grouping of 92 species of medium-sized birds with long wings and short bills specialized for eating insects. The nighthawk&#x27;s subfamily consists of four genera: &quot;Chordeiles&quot;; Swainson, 1832, &quot;Lurocalis;&quot; Cassin, 1851, &quot;Podager;&quot; Wagler, 1832, and &quot;Nyctiprogne;&quot; Bonaparte, 1857, which are all native to the western hemisphere.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Species in the family Caprimulgidae exhibit similarities in plumage appearance, a fact that some attribute to convergent evolution, which occurs when species that do not share an evolutionary history develop similar adaptations, while others attribute it to parallelism which is the process by which similar adaptations arise in members of closely related species or populations. Because of this, taxonomists in the past experienced difficulty in categorizing members of this group, however new advancements in molecular phylogeny have allowed for more conclusive classification. Thanks to these techniques, it is now understood that there are nine genera in the family, not 16 as previously accepted, and that there are two main subfamilies: Caprimulginae (nightjars) and Chordeilinae which is the subfamily that nighthawks belong to. Because of this taxonomic complexity, a lot of information regarding nightjars is conflated with information regarding nighthawks. Nighthawks are similar in most respects to the nightjars, but have shorter bills and plumage that is less soft. Nighthawks are less strictly nocturnal than many nightjars and may be seen hunting when there is still light in the sky.

=== Types of Nighthawks ===
The subfamily Chordeilinae contains four genera and ten species. Under the genus &quot;Chordeiles&quot; exists the greatest number of diversity in species in the subfamily with the lesser nighthawk (&quot;Chordeiles acutipennis&quot;), the Antillean nighthawk (&quot;Chordeiles gundlachii&quot;), the common nighthawk (&quot;Chordeiles minor&quot;), the nacunda nighthawk (&quot;Chordeiles nacunda&quot;), the least nighthawk (&quot;Chordeiles pusillus&quot;), and the sand-colored nighthawk (&quot;Chordeiles rupestris&quot;) comprising the category. The genus &quot;Lurocalis&quot; contains the chestnut-banded nighthawk (&quot;Lurocalis nattereri&quot;), the Rufous-bellied nighthawk (&quot;Lurocalis rufiventris&quot;), and the short-tailed nighthawk (&quot;Lurocalis semitorquatus&quot;). There is only one species in the monotypic genus &quot;Nyctiprogne&quot;  which is the band-tailed nighthawk (&quot;Nyctiprogne leucopyga&quot;), a small bird differentiated from other nighthawks by its long tail and dark appearance.

== Discovery ==
While limited information is known regarding the discovery of nighthawks, it is believed that the term &quot;nighthawk&quot;, first recorded in the King James Bible of 1611, was originally a local name in England for the European nightjar. Its use in the Americas to refer to members of the genus &quot;Chordeiles&quot; and related genera was first recorded in 1778 when John Cassin, a renowned ornithologist responsible for the establishment of the Delaware County Institute of Science, established the classification. Fossil records indicate that specimens later identified to be the common nighthawks (&quot;Chordeiles minor&quot;) excavated in the Southwestern US could be traced back as far as 400,000 years (during the Pleistocene era) meaning that the subfamily has been an entrenched component of new world ecology for a significant duration of time.

== Appearance ==
Nighthawks are medium-sized birds averaging 9 inches (22–24 cm) from bill to tail with a wingspan of about 21-22 inches (53–57 cm), short legs, and very short, wide bills that are moderately hooked at the tip. The least nighthawk (&quot;Chordeiles pusillus&quot;), at 6.3 inches (15–19 cm) and 23 grams (0.81 oz), is the smallest of all Caprimulgiformes, while the Nacunda nighthawk (&quot;Chordeiles nacunda&quot;) is one of the largest nightjars in the world measuring at 11-13 inches (28–33 cm). Nighthawks have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is cryptically coloured to resemble bark or leaves, aiding in protection from their primary predators; foxes and racoons. To promote concealment during the day, some species perch facing lengthwise along a branch, rather than across it as birds usually do.

== Behavior ==
Nighthawks are generally solitary but form flocks for the purpose of migration and for elaborate mating displays. These displays begin with the males diving from high in the air to produce the booming noises also associated with defense. This process is followed by tail-shaking, the exposing of a white patch located on the throat of the male, and vocalizations similar to croaks. Although it is unclear whether nighthawks mate for life, they are monogamous for the duration of mating season in which they develop a barren nest on the ground or another flat surface, such as an urban roof, where the female lays two patterned eggs directly onto bare ground. These eggs incubate for 18 to 20 days between May and August and they emerge semi-precocial, meaning they have their eyes open and a layer of down. Males will defend the nesting area, demonstrating indiscriminate aggression with displays involving diving and the production of a booming noise using their wings which deters predators and others of the same species. This unselective hostility can result in a decline in the average proportion of breeding individuals in a population in densely occupied territories, even below that of the carrying capacity established by available resources. This means that prey availability is not commonly cited as a concern for the conservation of nighthawks, but rather that habitat loss can be damaging to population stability. Nighthawks are mostly active in the late evening and early morning or at night and feed on moths and other large flying insects by holding their beak open in flight. There exists a mistaken belief that members of the Caprimulgidae family suck milk from goats (the Latin for goatsucker is &quot;Caprimulgus&quot;), however this claim is as of yet unsubstantiated. Heard most often at dusk, nighthawks have been known to perform a loud, nasal call which has been described as sounding like the noise &quot;pee-yah&quot;.

== Diet ==
Nighthawks are visually reliant predators that feed on flying insects such as beetles (Coleoptera), sawflies, bees, ants, and wasps (Hymenoptera), flies (Diptera), caddisflies (Trichoptera), butterflies, and moths (Lepidoptera) by opening their wide mouths to allow for the entrance of the insects as they are traveling. Areas of high precipitation, cool temperature, or high elevation are therefore unfavorable to nighthawks because flying insects are less mobile in such conditions. Nighthawks are most often observed hunting during crepuscular periods, or during twilight, which necessitates good eyesight with insects shorter than 5mm eliciting no reaction from experimental nighthawks. This consideration could pose a long-term risk to nighthawk population stability as climate change is increasing vulnerability in larger insects due to extreme weather events and higher temperatures, thus restricting prey availability for nighthawks which cannot see the, in some circumstances, 20% smaller prey organisms.

== Habitat ==
During the day, nighthawks roost in forested areas which provide them with cover from both predators and temperature fluctuations, although they may also occasionally be observed in grasslands and early successional habitats rich in foraging opportunities. Nighthawks breed in more open habitats like beaches or clearings to allow for the males to perform their mating rituals.
== Range ==
In October 2018, the University of Alberta published research on the common nighthawk revealing that it travels every year during migration between the rainforests and savannas of Brazil and its breeding grounds in northern Alberta. Further research has determined that, in addition to this annual migration between general regions, nighthawks demonstrate a high breeding site fidelity, thus meaning they are especially susceptible to destabilization as a result of natural disasters such as forest fires, floods or droughts, as well as anthropogenic interventions such as development. Nighthawks have been observed migrating at all hours of the day in flocks of, at times, hundreds of birds which winter in both rural and urban regions of South America. Nighthawk migration is considered one of the longest routes traveled for any North American bird.

<text>USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; was a 703-ton Boston-class sloop of war in the United States Navy from 1826 to 1865. During her service, &quot;Vincennes&quot; patrolled the Pacific, explored the Antarctic, and blockaded the Confederate Gulf coast in the Civil War. Named for the Revolutionary War Battle of Vincennes, she was the first U.S. warship to circumnavigate the globe.

==Service history==
&quot;Vincennes&quot;—the first American ship to be so named—was one of ten sloops of war whose construction was authorized by Congress on 3 March 1825. She was laid down at New York in 1825, launched on 27 April 1826, and commissioned on 27 August 1826, with Master Commandant William Compton Bolton in command.

The ship set sail for the first time on 3 September 1826, from New York bound for the Pacific by way of Cape Horn. She cruised extensively in that ocean, visiting the Hawaiian Islands in 1829 and made her way to Macau by 1830, under Commander William B. Finch. Her return voyage was made by way of China, the Philippines, the Indian Ocean, and the Cape of Good Hope. Ship chaplain Charles Samuel Stewart published a book about the voyage. After nearly four years, &quot;Vincennes&quot; arrived back in New York on 8 June 1830, becoming the first U.S. Navy ship to circumnavigate the Earth. Two days later the ship was decommissioned.

Following repairs and recommissioned, &quot;Vincennes&quot; then operated in the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico as part of the West Indies Squadron in 1831–32. After a long bout of yellow fever, she was decommissioned again for a time in 1833 before sailing once more. She departed for a second Pacific deployment in 1833, becoming the first American warship to call at Guam. She again sailed around the globe to return to the U.S. East Coast in June 1836.

===Supporting the Wilkes Expedition===

Decommissioned once again in 1836, while she underwent remodeling, she was refitted with a light spar deck and declared the flagship of the South Sea Surveying and Exploring Expedition to the Antarctic region. Commanded by Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, the expedition sailed from Hampton Roads in August 1838, and made surveys along the South American coast before making a brief survey of Antarctica in early 1839. Entering into the South Pacific in August and September 1839, her cartographers drafted charts of that area that are still used today.

Following survey operations and other scientific work along the west coast of South America and in the South Pacific during the rest of the year, in late 1839 &quot;Vincennes&quot; arrived at Sydney, Australia, her base for a pioneering cruise to Antarctica. She unintentionally exposed the lack of defences and security at Sydney Harbour when she slipped unnoticed into Sydney Harbour on 30 November 1839 under the cover of darkness. Between mid-January and mid-February 1840, she operated along the icy coast of the southernmost continent. The coast along which the ship sailed is today known as Wilkes Land, a name given on maps as early as 1841.

The remainder of her deployment included visits to the islands of the South Pacific, Hawaii, the Columbia River area, Puget Sound, California, Wake Island, the Philippines and South Africa. This third voyage around the world ended at New York in June 1842.

===1842–1847 operations===
&quot;Vincennes&quot; was next assigned to the Home Squadron and placed under the command of Commander Franklin Buchanan, a distinguished officer destined to become the first Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy. She sailed to the West Indies and cruised off the Mexican coast until the summer of 1844. Though this duty proved relatively uneventful, &quot;Vincennes&quot; did rescue two grounded English brigs off the coast of Texas and received the thanks of the British government for this service. Buchanan was also ordered to prevent any attempted invasion by Mexico of the new Republic of Texas. This eventuality never materialized; and &quot;Vincennes&quot; returned to Hampton Roads on 15 August to enter dry dock.

On 4 June 1845, &quot;Vincennes&quot; sailed for the Far East under command of Captain Hiram Paulding. She was accompanied by the ship-of-the-line , under the command of Captain Thomas Wyman; and the two vessels formed a little squadron under the command of Commodore James Biddle, who carried a letter from Secretary of State John C. Calhoun to Caleb Cushing, American commissioner in China, authorizing Cushing to make the first official contact with the Japanese Government.

The squadron sailed for Macau by way of Rio de Janeiro and the Cape of Good Hope. Commodore Biddle arrived safely in Macau only to find that Cushing had already left for home and that his successor, Alexander H. Everett, was too ill to make the trip. Therefore, Biddle determined to conduct the negotiations himself.

Accordingly, &quot;Vincennes&quot; and &quot;Columbus&quot; sailed for Japan on 7 July 1846 and anchored off Uraga on 19 July. The Japanese surrounded the vessels and allowed no one to land. Otherwise the visitors were treated with courtesy. However, Commodore Biddle&#x27;s attempts to force the opening of feudal Japan to multinational trade were politely rebuffed, and the vessels weighed anchor on 29 July. &quot;Columbus&quot; returned to the United States by way of Cape Horn, but &quot;Vincennes&quot; remained on the China Station for another year before returning to New York on 1 April 1847. Here, she was decommissioned on the 9th, dry-docked, and laid up.

===1849–1860 operations===
&quot;Vincennes&quot; remained in ordinary until 1849. Recommissioned on 12 November 1849, she sailed from New York exactly one month later, bound for Cape Horn and the west coast of South America. On 2 July 1850, while lying off Guayaquil, Ecuador, she harbored the Ecuadoran revolutionary General Elizalde for three days during one of that country&#x27;s frequent civil disturbances. Sailing on to San Francisco, California, the vessel lost 36 members of her crew to the gold fever sweeping California at the time. Turning south, &quot;Vincennes&quot; cruised off South America until late 1851, closely monitoring the activities of revolutionaries ashore.

She made a courtesy call to the Hawaiian Islands at the end of the year and proceeded thence to Puget Sound where she arrived on 2 February 1852. She anchored briefly there and returned via San Francisco and the Horn to New York where she arrived on 21 September and was decommissioned on the 24th.

Following repairs and a period in ordinary, &quot;Vincennes&quot; was recommissioned on 21 March 1853 and sailed into Norfolk, Virginia on 13 May to join her second exploratory expedition, serving as flagship to Commander Cadwalader Ringgold&#x27;s survey of the China Sea, the North Pacific, and the Bering Strait. Comdr. Ringgold was a veteran of the Wilkes expedition. The squadron stood out of Norfolk on 11 June 1853, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and charted numerous islands and shoals in the Indian Ocean before arriving in China in March 1854. Here Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry relieved Ringgold for medical reasons and gave command of the expedition to Lt. John Rodgers.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; sailed on to survey the Bonin and Ladrone Islands and returned to Hong Kong in February 1855. The expedition sailed again in March and surveyed the islands between the Ryūkyū chain and Japan, and then the Kurils. &quot;Vincennes&quot; left the squadron at Petropavlovsk, Russia, and entered the Bering Strait, sailing through to the northwest towards Wrangel Island. Ice barriers prevented the vessel from reaching this destination, but she came closer than any other previous ship. &quot;Vincennes&quot; returned to San Francisco in early October and later sailed for the Horn and New York, where she arrived on 13 July 1856 to complete yet another circumnavigation of the globe.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; operated with the African Squadron in 1857–1860.

===American Civil War service===

After the outbreak of the American Civil War in April 1861, &quot;Vincennes&quot; was recommissioned on 29 June and assigned to duty in the Gulf Blockading Squadron. She arrived off Fort Pickens, Florida, on 3 September, and was ordered to assist in the occupation of Head of Passes, Mississippi River, and remain there on blockade duty. Though the Federal warships did successfully deploy, on 12 October 1861 the Confederate metal-sheathed ram and armed steamers and drove the Union blockaders from Head of Passes in the Battle of the Head of Passes, forcing the Screw sloop-of-war and &quot;Vincennes&quot; aground. &quot;Vincennes&quot; was ordered abandoned and destroyed to prevent her capture, and her engineer set a slow match to the vessel&#x27;s magazine while her men took refuge on other ships. However, her engineer cut the burning fuse and threw it overboard before the magazine could explode and, after the Confederate vessels withdrew early in the afternoon, &quot;Vincennes&quot; was refloated.

After the Confederate attack, the Union sloop-of-war continued on blockade duty off the Passes of the Mississippi, capturing the blockade-running British bark &quot;Empress&quot;, aground at North East Pass with a large cargo of coffee on 27 November. On 4 March 1862, she was ordered to proceed to Pensacola, Florida, to relieve and spent the next six months shuttling between Pensacola and Mobile, Alabama, performing routine patrol and reconnaissance duty. On 4 October, she was ordered to assume command of the blockade off Ship Island, Mississippi, and to guard the pass out of Mississippi Sound. While so deployed, boat crews from the vessel and captured the barge &quot;H. McGuin&quot; in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, on 18 July 1863. &quot;Vincennes&quot; also reported the capture of two boats laden with food on 24 December.

===End-of-war service and decommissioning===
&quot;Vincennes&quot; remained off Ship Island for the remainder of the war and was laid up in ordinary at the Boston Navy Yard on 28 August 1865. She was decommissioned in August 1865 and sold at public auction at Boston on 5 October 1867 for approximately $5,000.00.

<text>USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; (CG-49) was a guided missile cruiser outfitted with the Aegis combat system that was in service with the United States Navy from July 1985 to June 2005. She was one of 27 ships of the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; class constructed for the United States Navy and one of five equipped with the Mark 26 Guided Missile Launching System.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; was commissioned in 1985. She saw service in the Pacific before being dispatched to the Persian Gulf in 1988 in support of Operation Earnest Will during the Iran–Iraq War, which was led by Saddam Hussein and backed by the U.S. On July 3, 1988, during the Iran–Iraq War, &quot;Vincennes&quot; shot down Iran Air Flight 655, a civilian passenger plane with 290 people on board, all of whom were killed. The incident followed a catalog of errors.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; was decommissioned in 2005 after attempts to retrofit the cruiser with the Mark 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) failed. She was initially laid up in a reserve fleet at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Naval Base Kitsap in Bremerton, Washington. In 2010 the vessel was towed to Texas for scrapping, which was completed in 2011.

==History==

===1980s===
&quot;Vincennes&quot; was launched on 14 April 1984 and sponsored by Marilyn Quayle, wife of Indiana Senator Dan Quayle. &quot;Vincennes&quot; was named for the Battle of Vincennes during the American Revolutionary War; the previous &quot;Vincennes&quot; heavy cruiser and &quot;Vincennes&quot; light cruiser were named for the city of Vincennes, Indiana. The cruiser was commissioned at Pascagoula on 6 July 1985, with Captain George N. Gee in command. The ship normally carried guided missiles, rapid-fire cannons, and two Seahawk LAMPS helicopters for anti-submarine and anti-ship warfare, personnel transfers, and other purposes.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; was the first of the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers to enter the Pacific Fleet. Upon commissioning in 1985, &quot;Vincennes&quot; helped test the SM-2 Block II surface-to-air missile. In May 1986, &quot;Vincennes&quot; participated in the multinational exercise RIMPAC 86, coordinating the anti-aircraft warfare efforts of two aircraft carriers and more than 40 ships from five nations. &quot;Vincennes&quot; was deployed in August 1986 to the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans. The ship served as anti-air warfare commander with the and battle groups, operated with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and the Royal Australian Navy, and steamed more than in waters from the Bering Sea to the Indian Ocean.

===Iran–Iraq War===
During the Iran–Iraq War, the United States took active measures in the Persian Gulf to protect shipping, mainly oil tankers, that were being threatened by both countries.

===Operation Earnest Will===
On 14 April 1988, the guided missile frigate hit a mine in the Persian Gulf during Operation Earnest Will. Six days later, &quot;Vincennes&quot; was redeployed from Fleet Exercise 88–2, sent back to San Diego, California, and told to prepare for a six-month deployment. The reason for the haste: Navy leaders decided that an Aegis ship was needed to protect the exit of the damaged &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; through the Strait of Hormuz. One month later, the cruiser entered the Persian Gulf, and in early July, stood guard in the Strait as the damaged frigate was borne out on the heavy-lift ship &quot;Mighty Servant 2&quot;. The ship made 14 Hormuz transits during its Earnest Will operations.

===Iran Air Flight 655===
On 3 July 1988, &quot;Vincennes&quot;, under the command of Captain Will Rogers III, was on patrol when it was reported that Iranian Revolutionary Guard gunboats had attacked a Pakistani merchant vessel. &quot;Vincennes&quot; deployed one of her helicopters to investigate. Shortly thereafter, Rogers ordered his ship to move off station to the north. The destroyer flotilla commander ordered &quot;Vincennes&quot; to return to her original station. &quot;Vincennes&quot;″s helicopter had followed the Revolutionary Guard gunboats into Iranian waters, and while maintaining contact with the boats, came under gunfire from the Iranians.

The helicopter crew reported that they had come under fire. With that report, Rogers turned his ship around and, with the frigate , moved to intercept the gunboats. In doing so, &quot;Vincennes&quot; crossed into Iranian waters herself. As the U.S. ships approached, the Iranian gunboats maneuvered in what Rogers claimed was a threatening fashion. Rogers requested permission to fire. Command, not knowing that &quot;Vincennes&quot; had crossed into Iranian waters, granted permission. &quot;Vincennes&quot; and &quot;Elmer Montgomery&quot; commenced fire upon the gunboats at 9:43 a.m., scoring several hits on the gunboats, sinking two and damaging another.

While &quot;Vincennes&quot; was firing on the Iranian gunboats, confusion reigned aboard the ship—the tracking of aircraft in the area had become muddled between &quot;Vincennes&quot; and other U.S. ships. Crucially, &quot;Vincennes&quot; misidentified an Iran Air Airbus A300 civilian airliner, Iran Air Flight 655 (IR655), as an attacking F-14 Tomcat fighter aircraft. IR655 was climbing at the time, and her IFF transponder was on the Mode III civilian code rather than on the purely military Mode II, as recorded by &quot;Vincennes&quot;″s own shipboard Aegis Combat System.

After issuing multiple radio challenges and receiving no response from the aircraft, &quot;Vincennes&quot;&#x27;s crew commenced the process to engage it. The naval officer responsible for authorizing a missile launch, the watch&#x27;s Anti-Air Warfare Coordinator (AAWC), pushed wrong buttons no fewer than five times in response to a system message to select a weapon. In the meantime, the officer in charge of firing missiles, the watch&#x27;s Missile System Supervisor (MSS), pushed &quot;REQUEST RADIATION ASSIGN&quot; no fewer than 22 times, all without effect due to the AAWC not completing the appropriate process at his console. The AAWC finally selected the correct input at his console, allowing the MSS to again push &quot;REQUEST RADIATION ASSIGN&quot; and continue the process.

At 10:24 a.m, &quot;Vincennes&quot; fired two SM-2MR surface-to-air missiles, shooting down the Iranian civilian airliner over Iranian airspace in the Strait of Hormuz. All 290 passengers and crew on board were killed. The victims included 66 children and a family of 16 who were on their way to a wedding in Dubai.

The Iranian government has maintained that &quot;Vincennes&quot; knowingly shot down the civilian aircraft. IR655 flew every day out of Bandar Abbas—a civil and military airport—on a scheduled passenger flight to Dubai using established air lanes. The Italian navy and another U.S. warship, the frigate , confirmed that the plane was climbing—not diving to attack—at the time of the missile strike. The U.S. radio warnings were only broadcast on &quot;guard&quot; (121.5 MHz) and not air traffic control frequencies. The &quot;Vincennes&quot; crew also misidentified the altitude and position of the plane; the Airbus crew, if monitoring guard, could have interpreted the warnings as intended for another aircraft. Captain David Carlson of &quot;Sides&quot; later said that the airliner&#x27;s destruction &quot;marked the horrifying climax to Rogers&#x27; aggressiveness&quot;.

===1990s===
In February 1990, &quot;Vincennes&quot; was deployed on a third six-month tour of the western Pacific and Indian oceans with SH-60 helicopters from HSL-45 Detachment 13. The ship coordinated all battle group air events and served as the command-and-control flagship during Harpoon-Ex-90. In July 1990, &quot;Vincennes&quot; returned home after steaming nearly .

In August 1991, &quot;Vincennes&quot; departed for a fourth western Pacific deployment. Steaming with the aircraft carrier , &quot;Vincennes&quot; performed duties as the anti-air warfare commander for Battle Group Delta until detaching to participate as the United States representative in MERCUBEX 91, a joint United States and Republic of Singapore Navy exercise. Over the next three months, &quot;Vincennes&quot; participated in the bilateral exercise Valiant Blitz with the South Korean Navy, the bilateral exercise Annualex 03G with the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force, and ASWEX 92-1K with the South Korean Navy before reaching Hong Kong to act as the U.S. representative for the Navy Days ceremonies. &quot;Vincennes&quot; returned from deployment on 21 December 1991.

In June 1994, &quot;Vincennes&quot; departed on a fifth western Pacific deployment with the Battle Group. &quot;Vincennes&quot; performed duties as anti-air warfare commander for the battle group. During deployment, &quot;Vincennes&quot; conducted the anti-submarine exercise PASSEX 94–2 with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force; the bilateral exercise MERCUB 94–2, a joint U.S. and Singaporean Navy exercise of the Malaysian peninsula; the bilateral exercise Keen Edge with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force; and Tandem Thrust, a larger-scale joint exercise which &quot;Vincennes&quot; participated as the area air defense coordinator for the entire joint operating area. &quot;Vincennes&quot; returned from this deployment on 22 December 1994.

In August 1997, &quot;Vincennes&quot; changed homeport from San Diego to Yokosuka, Japan with SH-60B helicopters from HSL-49 Detachment 8G embarked. She then steamed to the South Pacific and took part in Exercise Valiant Usher 98–1 with the amphibious ready group and the Royal Australian Navy destroyer . The combined exercise took place near Townsend Island, Australia.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; also took part in the U.S. Seventh Fleet&#x27;s Fleet Battle Experiment Delta (FBE-D) from 24 October 1998 to 2 November 1998, in conjunction with the exercise Foal Eagle, a regularly scheduled exercise that simulates the military defense of South Korea. Sponsored by the Navy Warfare Development Command, FBE-D was the fourth in a series of experiments that tested new combat systems and procedures at sea.

===2000s===

On 12 August 2000, &quot;Vincennes&quot; completed Sharem 134, a bilateral exercise with several Japanese ships and other U.S. participants. The exercise included a week of undersea warfare training and data collection in the South China Sea. The ship tested her submarine detection, sonar range testing, and use of sonobuoys, and she developed new submarine prosecution procedures. The final Sharem events included a &quot;free play&quot;, which allowed the cruiser to detect and prosecute other submarines, combining many of the tactics and systems tested during Sharem.

In mid-November 2000, the cruiser fired missile batteries at remote-controlled aerial drones provided by Fleet Activities Okinawa during MISSILEX 01–1.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; took part in a 23 August 2001 to 27 August 2001 military training exercise called Multi-Sail, which was designed to provide U.S. and Japanese forces interoperability training in multiple warfare areas.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; departed from Yokosuka on 17 September 2001 to conduct operations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The ship returned on 18 December 2001 after more than three months at sea.

In March 2003, &quot;Vincennes&quot; was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 15.

==Decommissioning==
While there had been several proposals through the 1990s to retrofit the Mark 41 VLS into &quot;Vincennes&quot; and her four sister ships to extend their service life, none were funded, and all five ships were instead decommissioned; &quot;Vincennes&quot; herself was decommissioned and later stricken on 29 June 2005 at San Diego, California. She was mothballed at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Naval Base Kitsap, in Bremerton, Washington. In 2008, &quot;Vincennes&quot; was slated for scrapping within the next five years along with her sister ships and .

On 9 July 2010, a contract to scrap &quot;Vincennes&quot; was issued to International Shipbreaking, Brownsville, Texas. On 21 November 2010, &quot;Vincennes&quot; arrived via the Panama Canal to International Shipbreaking in Brownsville, Texas, and she was completely scrapped by 23 November 2011.

==Awards and decorations==
&quot;Vincennes&quot; has been awarded the Combat Action Ribbon (3 July 1988),
*Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation (16 January 2 February 1987)
*Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; three times (1990, 1993, 2001)

<doc id="211544" wikidata="Q256983" url="?curid=211544" title="Anne de Mortimer">
<text>Anne de Mortimer (27 December 1388 – 22 September 1411) was a medieval English noblewoman who became an ancestor to the royal House of York, one of the parties in the fifteenth-century dynastic Wars of the Roses. It was her line of descent which gave the Yorkist dynasty its claim to the throne. Anne was the mother of Richard, Duke of York, and thus grandmother of kings Edward IV and Richard III, and great-grandmother of Edward V.

==Early life==
Born 27 December 1388, Anne de Mortimer was the eldest of the four children of Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March (1374–1398), and Eleanor Holland (1370–1405). She had two brothers, Edmund, 5th Earl of March (1391–1425), and Roger (1393–1413?), as well as a sister, Eleanor.

Her father was a grandson of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, second surviving son of King Edward III of England, an ancestry which made Mortimer a potential heir to the throne during the reign of the childless King Richard II. Upon Roger Mortimer&#x27;s death in 1398, this claim passed to his son and heir, Anne&#x27;s brother Edmund, Earl of March. In 1399, Richard II was deposed by Henry IV, of the House of Lancaster, making Edmund Mortimer a dynastic threat to the new king, who in turn placed both Edmund and his brother Roger under royal custody.

Anne and her sister Eleanor remained in the care of their mother, Countess Eleanor, who, not long after her first husband&#x27;s death, married Lord Edward Charleton of Powys. Following their mother&#x27;s death in 1405, the sisters fared less well than their brothers and were described as &quot;destitute&quot;, needing £100 per annum for themselves and their servants.

==Marriage and issue==

Around early 1408 (probably after 8 January), Anne married Richard of Conisburgh (1385–1415), the second son of Edmund, Duke of York (fourth son of King Edward III). The marriage was undertaken secretly and probably with haste, without the knowledge of her nearest relatives, and was validated on 23 May 1408 by papal dispensation.

Anne de Mortimer and Richard of Conisburgh had two sons and a daughter:

* Isabel of York (1409 – 2 October 1484), who in 1412, at three years of age, was betrothed to Sir Thomas Grey, son and heir of Sir Thomas Grey of Heaton (1384–1415), by whom she had one son. Isabel married, secondly, before 25 April 1426 (the marriage being later validated by papal dispensation), Henry Bourchier, 1st Earl of Essex, by whom she had issue.
* Henry of York
* Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York (22 September 1411 – 30 December 1460), Yorkist claimant to the English throne, and father of kings Edward IV and Richard III, grandfather of Edward V.

==Death==
Anne de Mortimer died soon after the birth of her son Richard on 22 September 1411. She was buried at Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, once the site of Kings Langley Palace, which housed the tombs of her husband&#x27;s parents Edmund of Langley and Isabella of Castile. After the dissolution of the monasteries, all three were reburied at the All Saints&#x27; Church, Kings Langley.

<text>Betacoronavirus pandemicum (also known as Severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus, abbreviated as SARSr-CoV or SARS-CoV) is a species of virus consisting of many known strains. Two strains of the virus have caused outbreaks of severe respiratory diseases in humans: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1), the cause of the 2002–2004 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the pandemic of COVID-19. There are hundreds of other strains of SARSr-CoV, which are only known to infect non-human mammal species: bats are a major reservoir of many strains of SARSr-CoV; several strains have been identified in Himalayan palm civets, which were likely ancestors of SARS-CoV-1.

These enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses enter host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The SARSr-CoV species is a member of the genus &quot;Betacoronavirus&quot; and the only species of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (SARS Betacoronavirus).

The SARS-related coronavirus was one of several viruses identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016 as a likely cause of a future epidemic in a new plan developed after the Ebola epidemic for urgent research and development before and during an epidemic towards diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines. This prediction came to pass with the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Classification ==
SARS-related coronavirus is a member of the genus &quot;Betacoronavirus&quot; (group 2) and monotypic of the subgenus &quot;Sarbecovirus&quot; (subgroup B). Sarbecoviruses, unlike embecoviruses or alphacoronaviruses, have only one papain-like proteinase (PLpro) instead of two in the open reading frame ORF1ab. SARSr-CoV was determined to be an early split-off from the betacoronaviruses based on a set of conserved domains that it shares with the group.

Bats serve as the main host reservoir species for the SARS-related coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. The virus has coevolved in the bat host reservoir over a long period of time. Only recently have strains of SARS-related coronavirus been observed to have evolved into having been able to make the cross-species jump from bats to humans, as in the case of the strains SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Both of these strains descended from a single ancestor but made the cross-species jump into humans separately. SARS-CoV-2 is not a direct descendant of SARS-CoV-1.

== Genome ==

The SARS-related coronavirus is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Its genome is about 30 kb, which is one of the largest among RNA viruses. The virus has 14 open reading frames which overlap in some cases. The genome has the usual 5′ methylated cap and a 3′ polyadenylated tail. There are 265 nucleotides in the 5&#x27;UTR and 342 nucleotides in the 3&#x27;UTR.

The 5&#x27; methylated cap and 3&#x27; polyadenylated tail allows the positive-sense RNA genome to be directly translated by the host cell&#x27;s ribosome on viral entry. SARSr-CoV is similar to other coronaviruses in that its genome expression starts with translation by the host cell&#x27;s ribosomes of its initial two large overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b, both of which produce polyproteins.
The functions of several of the viral proteins are known. ORFs 1a and 1b encode the replicase/transcriptase polyprotein, and later ORFs 2, 4, 5, and 9a encode, respectively, the four major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). The later ORFs also encode for eight unique proteins (orf3a to orf9b), known as the accessory proteins, many with no known homologues. The different functions of the accessory proteins are not well understood.

SARS coronaviruses have been genetically engineered in several laboratories.

==Phylogenetics==

Phylogenetic analysis showed that the evolutionary branch composed of Bat coronavirus BtKY72 and BM48-31 was the base group of SARS–related CoVs evolutionary tree, which separated from other SARS–related CoVs earlier than SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.

== Morphology ==

The morphology of the SARS-related coronavirus is characteristic of the coronavirus family as a whole. The viruses are large pleomorphic spherical particles with bulbous surface projections that form a corona around the particles in electron micrographs. The size of the virus particles is in the 80–90 nm range. The envelope of the virus in electron micrographs appears as a distinct pair of electron dense shells.

The viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer where the membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S) proteins are anchored. The spike proteins provide the virus with its bulbous surface projections, known as peplomers. The spike protein&#x27;s interaction with its complement host cell receptor is central in determining the tissue tropism, infectivity, and species range of the virus.

Inside the envelope, there is the nucleocapsid, which is formed from multiple copies of the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are bound to the positive-sense single-stranded (~30 kb) RNA genome in a continuous beads-on-a-string type conformation. The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host.

== Life cycle ==
SARS-related coronavirus follows the replication strategy typical of all coronaviruses.

=== Attachment and entry ===
The attachment of the SARS-related coronavirus to the host cell is mediated by the spike protein and its receptor. The spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) recognizes and attaches to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Following attachment, the virus can enter the host cell by two different paths. The path the virus takes depends on the host protease available to cleave and activate the receptor-attached spike protein.

The attachment of sarbecoviruses to ACE2 has been shown to be an evolutionarily conserved feature, present in many species of the taxon.

The first path the SARS coronavirus can take to enter the host cell is by endocytosis and uptake of the virus in an endosome. The receptor-attached spike protein is then activated by the host&#x27;s pH-dependent cysteine protease cathepsin L. Activation of the receptor-attached spike protein causes a conformational change, and the subsequent fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal wall.

Alternatively, the virus can enter the host cell directly by proteolytic cleavage of the receptor-attached spike protein by the host&#x27;s TMPRSS2 or TMPRSS11D serine proteases at the cell surface. In the SARS coronavirus, the activation of the C-terminal part of the spike protein triggers the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane by inducing conformational changes which are not fully understood.

=== Genome translation ===

After fusion the nucleocapsid passes into the cytoplasm, where the viral genome is released. The genome acts as a messenger RNA, and the cell&#x27;s ribosome translates two-thirds of the genome, which corresponds to the open reading frame ORF1a and ORF1b, into two large overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab.

The larger polyprotein pp1ab is a result of a -1 ribosomal frameshift caused by a slippery sequence (UUUAAAC) and a downstream RNA pseudoknot at the end of open reading frame ORF1a. The ribosomal frameshift allows for the continuous translation of ORF1a followed by ORF1b.

The polyproteins contain their own proteases, PLpro and 3CLpro, which cleave the polyproteins at different specific sites. The cleavage of polyprotein pp1ab yields 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16). Product proteins include various replication proteins such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), RNA helicase, and exoribonuclease (ExoN).

The two SARS-CoV-2 proteases (PLpro and 3CLpro) also interfere with the immune system response to the viral infection by cleaving three immune system proteins. PLpro cleaves IRF3 and 3CLpro cleaves both NLRP12 and TAB1. &quot;Direct cleavage of IRF3 by NSP3 could explain the blunted Type-I IFN response seen during SARS-CoV-2 infections while NSP5 mediated cleavage of NLRP12 and TAB1 point to a molecular mechanism for enhanced production of IL-6 and inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients.&quot;

=== Replication and transcription ===
A number of the nonstructural replication proteins coalesce to form a multi-protein replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC). The main replicase-transcriptase protein is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). It is directly involved in the replication and transcription of RNA from an RNA strand. The other nonstructural proteins in the complex assist in the replication and transcription process.

The protein nsp14 is a 3&#x27;-5&#x27; exoribonuclease which provides extra fidelity to the replication process. The exoribonuclease provides a proofreading function to the complex which the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lacks. Similarly, proteins nsp7 and nsp8 form a hexadecameric sliding clamp as part of the complex which greatly increases the processivity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The coronaviruses require the increased fidelity and processivity during RNA synthesis because of the relatively large genome size in comparison to other RNA viruses.

One of the main functions of the replicase-transcriptase complex is to transcribe the viral genome. RdRp directly mediates the synthesis of negative-sense subgenomic RNA molecules from the positive-sense genomic RNA. This is followed by the transcription of these negative-sense subgenomic RNA molecules to their corresponding positive-sense mRNAs.

The other important function of the replicase-transcriptase complex is to replicate the viral genome. RdRp directly mediates the synthesis of negative-sense genomic RNA from the positive-sense genomic RNA. This is followed by the replication of positive-sense genomic RNA from the negative-sense genomic RNA.

The replicated positive-sense genomic RNA becomes the genome of the progeny viruses. The various smaller mRNAs are transcripts from the last third of the virus genome which follows the reading frames ORF1a and ORF1b. These mRNAs are translated into the four structural proteins (S, E, M, and N) that will become part of the progeny virus particles and also eight other accessory proteins (orf3 to orf9b) which assist the virus.

===Recombination===
When two SARS-CoV genomes are present in a host cell, they may interact with each other to form recombinant genomes that can be transmitted to progeny viruses. Recombination likely occurs during genome replication when the RNA polymerase switches from one template to another (copy choice recombination). Human SARS-CoV appears to have had a complex history of recombination between ancestral coronaviruses that were hosted in several different animal groups.

=== Assembly and release ===
RNA translation occurs inside the endoplasmic reticulum. The viral structural proteins S, E and M move along the secretory pathway into the Golgi intermediate compartment. There, the M proteins direct most protein-protein interactions required for assembly of viruses following its binding to the nucleocapsid. Progeny viruses are released from the host cell by exocytosis through secretory vesicles.

<text>Krauseia is an extinct genus of small mammal from the Paleocene of North America. It was a member of the extinct order Multituberculata and is within the suborder of Cimolodonta, family Neoplagiaulacidae. The genus was nemed by Vianey-Liaud M. in 1986, and has also partly been known under the name &quot;Parectypodus&quot;.

The species &quot;Krauseia clemensi&quot; was named by Sloan R.E. in 1981, and is also known as &quot;Parectypodus clemensi&quot;. Fossil remains of members of this species have been found in the Torrejonian (Paleocene)-age strata of the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and Wyoming. An approximate weight comparison for &quot;P. clemensi&quot; is the weight of one standard mouse, around 25 g.

<text>3DNow! is a deprecated extension to the x86 instruction set developed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). It adds single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions to the base x86 instruction set, enabling it to perform vector processing of floating-point vector operations using vector registers. This improvement enhances the performance of many graphics-intensive applications. The first microprocessor to implement 3DNow! was the AMD K6-2, introduced in 1998. In appropriate applications, this enhancement raised the speed by about 2–4 times.

However, the instruction set never gained much popularity, and AMD announced in August 2010 that support for 3DNow! would be dropped in future AMD processors, except for two instructions, codice_1 and codice_2. These two instructions are also available in Bay-Trail Intel processors.

==History==
3DNow! was developed at a time when 3D graphics were becoming mainstream in PC multimedia and games. Realtime display of 3D graphics depended heavily on the host CPU&#x27;s floating-point unit (FPU) to perform floating-point calculations, a task in which AMD&#x27;s K6 processor was easily outperformed by its competitor, the Intel Pentium II.

As an enhancement to the MMX instruction set, the 3DNow! instruction-set augmented the MMX SIMD registers to support common arithmetic operations (add/subtract/multiply) on single-precision (32-bit) floating-point data. Software written to use AMD&#x27;s 3DNow! instead of the slower x87 FPU could execute up to four times faster, depending on the instruction mix.

==Versions==

===3DNow!===
The first implementation of 3DNow! technology contains 21 new instructions that support SIMD floating-point operations. The 3DNow! data format is packed, single-precision, floating-point. The 3DNow! instruction set also includes operations for SIMD integer operations, data prefetch, and faster MMX-to-floating-point switching. Later, Intel would add similar (but incompatible) instructions to the Pentium III, known as SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions).

3DNow! floating-point instructions are the following:

* codice_3 Packed 32-bit integer to floating-point conversion
* codice_4 Packed floating-point to 32-bit integer conversion
* codice_5 Packed floating-point comparison, greater or equal
* codice_6 Packed floating-point comparison, greater
* codice_7 Packed floating-point comparison, equal
* codice_8 Packed floating-point accumulate
* codice_9 Packed floating-point addition
* codice_10 Packed floating-point subtraction
* codice_11 Packed floating-point reverse subtraction
* codice_12 Packed floating-point minimum
* codice_13 Packed floating-point maximum
* codice_14 Packed floating-point multiplication
* codice_15 Packed floating-point reciprocal approximation
* codice_16 Packed floating-point reciprocal square root approximation
* codice_17 Packed floating-point reciprocal, first iteration step
* codice_18 Packed floating-point reciprocal square root, first iteration step
* codice_19 Packed floating-point reciprocal/reciprocal square root, second iteration step
3DNow! integer instructions are the following:
* codice_20 Packed 8-bit unsigned integer averaging
* codice_21 Packed 16-bit integer multiply with rounding

3DNow! performance-enhancement instructions are the following:
* codice_22 Faster entry/exit of the MMX or floating-point state
* codice_23 Prefetch at least a 32-byte line into L1 data cache (this is the only non-deprecated instruction)

===3DNow! extensions===
There is little or no evidence that the second version of 3DNow! was ever officially given its own trade name. This has led to some confusion in documentation that refers to this new instruction set. The most common terms are &quot;Extended 3DNow!&quot;, &quot;Enhanced 3DNow!&quot; and &quot;3DNow!+&quot;. The phrase &quot;Enhanced 3DNow!&quot; can be found in a few locations on the AMD website but the capitalization of &quot;Enhanced&quot; appears to be either purely grammatical or used for emphasis on processors that may or may not have these extensions (the most notable of which references a benchmark page for the K6-III-P that does not have these extensions).

This extension to the 3DNow! instruction set was introduced with the first-generation Athlon processors. The Athlon added five new 3DNow! instructions and 19 new MMX instructions. Later, the K6-2+ and K6-III+ (both targeted at the mobile market) included the five new 3DNow! instructions, leaving out the 19 new MMX instructions. The new 3DNow! instructions were added to boost DSP. The new MMX instructions were added to boost streaming media.

The 19 new MMX instructions are a subset of Intel&#x27;s SSE instruction set. In AMD technical manuals, AMD segregates these instructions apart from the 3DNow! extensions. In AMD customer product literature, however, this segregation is less clear where the benefits of all 24 new instructions are credited to enhanced 3DNow! technology. This has led programmers to come up with their own name for the 19 new MMX instructions. The most common appears to be &quot;Integer SSE&quot; (&quot;ISSE&quot;). &quot;SSEMMX&quot; and &quot;MMX2&quot; are also found in video filter documentation from the public domain sector. ISSE could also refer to Internet SSE, an early name for SSE.

3DNow! extension DSP instructions are the following:
* codice_24 Packed floating-point to integer word conversion with sign extend
* codice_25 Packed integer word to floating-point conversion
* codice_26 Packed floating-point negative accumulate
* codice_27 Packed floating-point mixed positive-negative accumulate
* codice_28 Packed swap doubleword

MMX extension instructions (Integer SSE) are the following:

* codice_29 Streaming (cache bypass) store using byte mask
* codice_30 Streaming (cache bypass) store
* codice_31 Packed average of unsigned byte
* codice_32 Packed average of unsigned word
* codice_33 Packed maximum signed word
* codice_34 Packed maximum unsigned byte
* codice_35 Packed minimum signed word
* codice_36 Packed minimum unsigned byte
* codice_37 Packed multiply high unsigned word
* codice_38 Packed sum of absolute byte differences
* codice_39 Packed shuffle word
* codice_40 Extract word into integer register
* codice_41 Insert word from integer register
* codice_42 Move byte mask to integer register
* codice_43 Prefetch using the NTA reference
* codice_44 Prefetch using the T0 reference
* codice_45 Prefetch using the T1 reference
* codice_46 Prefetch using the T2 reference
* codice_47 Store fence
===3DNow! Professional===
&quot;3DNow! Professional&quot; is a trade name used to indicate processors that combine 3DNow! technology with a complete SSE instructions set (such as SSE, SSE2 or SSE3). The Athlon XP was the first processor to carry the 3DNow! Professional trade name, and was the first product in the Athlon family to support the complete SSE instruction set (for the total of: 21 original 3DNow! instructions; five 3DNow! extension DSP instructions; 19 MMX extension instructions; and 52 additional SSE instructions for complete SSE compatibility).

===3DNow! and the Geode GX/LX===
The Geode GX and Geode LX added two new 3DNow! instructions which is absent in all other processors.

3DNow! &quot;professional&quot; instructions unique to the Geode GX/LX are the following:
* codice_48 Reciprocal square root approximation for a pair of 32-bit floats
* codice_49 Reciprocal approximation for a pair of 32-bit floats

==Advantages and disadvantages==
One advantage of 3DNow! is that it is possible to add or multiply the two numbers that are stored in the same register. With SSE, each number can only be combined with a number in the same position in another register. This capability, known as &quot;horizontal&quot; in Intel terminology, was the major addition to the SSE3 instruction set.

A disadvantage with 3DNow! is that 3DNow! instructions and MMX instructions share the same register-file, whereas SSE adds 8 new independent registers (codice_50–codice_51).

Because MMX/3DNow! registers are shared by the standard x87 FPU, 3DNow! instructions and x87 instructions cannot be executed simultaneously. However, because it is aliased to the x87 FPU, the 3DNow! and MMX register states can be saved and restored by the traditional x87 codice_52 and codice_53 instructions. This arrangement allowed operating systems to support 3DNow! with no explicit modifications, whereas SSE registers required explicit operating system support to properly save and restore the new XMM registers (via the added codice_54 and codice_55 instructions.)

The FX* instructions from SSE provide a functional superset of the older x87 save and restore instructions. They can save not only SSE register states but also the x87 register states (hence are applicable also for MMX and 3DNow! operations where supported).

On AMD Athlon XP and K8-based cores (i.e. Athlon 64), assembly programmers have noted that it is possible to combine 3DNow! and SSE instructions to reduce register pressure, but in practice it is difficult to improve performance due to the instructions executing on shared functional units.

==Processors supporting 3DNow!==
* All AMD processors after K6-2 (based on K6), Athlon, Athlon 64 and Phenom architecture families.
** Not supported in Bulldozer, Bobcat and Zen architecture processors and their derivates.
** The last AMD APU processor supporting 3DNow! is the A8-3870K, which is based on the Llano architecture. It is also the only APU with 3DNow! instructions, as the Bobcat and up exclude support for it.
* National Semiconductor Geode GX2, later AMD Geode.
* VIA C3 (also known as Cyrix III) &quot;Samuel&quot;, &quot;Samuel 2&quot;, &quot;Ezra&quot;, and &quot;Eden ESP&quot; cores.
* IDT WinChip 2, 3

<doc id="211553" wikidata="Q614065" url="?curid=211553" title="Radio (LL Cool J album)">
<text>Radio is the debut studio album by American rapper LL Cool J. It was released on November 18, 1985, by Def Jam Recordings and Columbia Records. It was also Def Jam&#x27;s first full-length album release.

The album was recorded at Chung King House of Metal in New York City with producer Rick Rubin, who provided a sparse, minimal production style. The album also features a sound punctuated by DJ scratching, often brief samples, and emphasis of the downbeat. LL Cool J&#x27;s aggressive b-boy lyrics explored themes of inner city culture, teenage promiscuity, and braggadocio raps.

A significant sales success for a hip hop record at the time, &quot;Radio&quot; became a &quot;Billboard&quot; chart hit and sold over 500,000 copies within its first five months of release. By 1989, it had been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales surpassing one million copies in the United States. Initial reception of the album was generally positive, with praise given to LL Cool J&#x27;s lyricism and Rubin&#x27;s production. It has since been recognized by critics as LL Cool J&#x27;s best album.

&quot;Radio&quot; belonged to a pivotal moment in hip hop&#x27;s culture and history, reflecting the new school and ghettoblaster subculture in the United States during the mid-1980s. The album&#x27;s success contributed to the displacement of the old school with the new school form and to the genre&#x27;s mainstream success during this period. It was also a career breakthrough for LL Cool J and Rick Rubin. &quot;Radio&quot; has been recognized by music journalists as one of the first artistically cohesive and commercially successful hip hop albums.

== Background ==
In March 1984, when NYU student Rick Rubin and promoter-manager Russell Simmons founded the then-independent Def Jam label, 16 year–old St. Albans, Queens native James Todd Smith was creating demo tapes in his grandparents&#x27; home. His grandfather, a jazz saxophonist, purchased him $2,000 worth of stereo equipment, including two turntables, an audio mixer and an amplifier. Smith later discussed his childhood background and rapping, stating that &quot;By the time I got that equipment, I was already a rapper. In this neighborhood, the kids grow up in rap. It&#x27;s like speaking Spanish if you grow up in an all-Spanish house. I got into it when I was about 9, and since then all I wanted was to make a record and hear it on the radio.&quot; By using the mixing table he had received from his grandfather, Smith produced and mixed his own demos and sent them to various record companies throughout New York City, including Simmons&#x27; and Rubin&#x27;s own Def Jam Recordings.

Under his new stage name, LL Cool J (an acronym for &quot;Ladies Love Cool James&quot;), Smith was signed by Def Jam, which led to the release of his first official record, the 12-inch single &quot;I Need a Beat&quot; (1984). The single was a hard-hitting, streetwise b-boy song with spare beats and ballistic rhymes. Smith later discussed his search for a label, stating &quot;I sent my demo to many different companies, but it was Def Jam where I found my home.&quot; That same year, Smith made his professional debut concert performance at Manhattan Center High School. In a later interview, LL Cool J recalled the experience, stating &quot;They pushed the lunch room tables together and me and my DJ, Cut Creator, started playing. ... As soon as it was over there were girls screaming and asking for autographs. Right then and there I said, &#x27;This is what I want to do&#x27;.&quot; LL&#x27;s debut single sold over 100,000 copies and helped establish both Def Jam as a label and Smith as a rapper. The commercial success of &quot;I Need a Beat&quot;—along with the Beastie Boys&#x27; &quot;Rock Hard&quot; (1984)—helped Def Jam to a distribution deal with Columbia Records the following year.

LL dropped out of Andrew Jackson High School in Queens to record his first studio album, also the first LP to be issued by Def Jam. Recording sessions for the album took place at Chung King Studios in Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown under Rubin&#x27;s direction. &quot;There were no expectations,&quot; the producer recalled. &quot;Everything was done through trial and error. As long as it sounded good, it didn&#x27;t matter how technically wrong it might be.&quot;

Notable among the personnel was LL&#x27;s DJ Jay Philpot, better known as Cut Creator. A Queens native and former trombonist, Philpot met LL at a block party, and they began performing together. The audio mastering was handled by engineer Herb Powers at 130 West 42nd Street in the Frankford Wayne Mastering Labs and the album was set for release as &quot;Radio&quot; in November 1985, containing a dedication in the liner notes to LL&#x27;s mother and grandparents. 

The album&#x27;s release had been anticipated by many rap fans following LL&#x27;s appearance in the hip hop movie &quot;Krush Groove&quot;, which was based on the beginnings of the Def Jam label and featured the single &quot;I Can&#x27;t Live Without My Radio&quot; from &quot;Radio&quot;.

== Music and lyrics ==
The album&#x27;s production, handled entirely by Rick Rubin with a remix by DJ Jazzy Jay, has been noted by critics and music writers for Rubin&#x27;s minimalist style and stripped-down aggressiveness. Steve Huey of AllMusic described the production for &quot;Radio&quot; as &quot;bare-bones&quot; and &quot;skeletal&quot;, while calling the instrumentation &quot;basically just a cranked-up beatbox.&quot; The sound of &quot;Radio&quot; is mostly punctuated by DJ scratching and features occasional brief samples, which emphasize a downbeat. In summing up the musical style of &quot;Radio&quot;, Huey stated &quot;The result is rap at its most skeletal, with a hard-hitting, street-level aggression that perfectly matches LL&#x27;s cocksure teenage energy.&quot;
The lyrical themes regarding the culture and the way of life of inner city youth that surface in &quot;Radio&quot;, including the growing and popular b-boy attitude (&quot;I Can&#x27;t Live Without My Radio&quot;, &quot;Rock the Bells&quot;) and teenage promiscuity (&quot;Dear Yvette&quot;), along with LL&#x27;s &quot;teenage energy&quot;, as described by writer Nelson George, helped appeal to a younger music audience and were essential in the album&#x27;s commercial success. LL Cool J&#x27;s lyricism on &quot;Radio&quot; is highlighted by clever disses, playful boasts and braggadocio raps. Columnist Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described LL Cool J as &quot;a brawny young giant with the animal magnetism and amiable self-assurance of the young Muhammad Ali.&quot; &quot;I Want You&quot; and &quot;I Can Give You More&quot; have been recognized by listeners of hip hop as the first hip-hop ballads, and have been cited likewise by several music writers and critics.

Author of the 1985 book &quot;Fresh: Hip Hop Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, writer Nelson George further elaborated on the appeal of &quot;Radio&quot; to listeners at the time, describing LL Cool J as a &quot;minimalist homeboy who knows his beats&quot;, and stating &quot;You can call it rap, hip hop or street, but it really is a way of hearing music—and partying hard—that expresses the experiences and attitudes of a great many inner city kids. L.L. Cool J is one of the best young talkologists around, because he speaks directly to and about his generation over large beats that recall Run-D.M.C., Trouble Funk, James Brown, and funky little bits of AC/DC and Yes ... This teenage music is built around beats, but not just any old beats. It is all about a beat with style, with personality, and L.L. Cool J has plenty of both.&quot;

== Release and reception ==

Released November 18, 1985, on Def Jam Recordings in the United States, &quot;Radio&quot; earned a significant amount of commercial success and sales for a hip hop record at the time. It sold over 500,000 copies in its first five months, eventually selling over 1 million copies by 1988, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. &quot;Radio&quot; peaked at number 6 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and at number 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. It entered the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart on December 28, 1985, and remained there for forty-seven weeks, while also entering the Pop Albums chart on January 11, 1986. &quot;Radio&quot; remained on the chart for thirty-eight weeks. By 1989, the album had earned platinum status from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), after earning a gold certification in the United States on April 14, 1986, with sales exceeding one million copies.

&quot;Radio&quot; received positive reviews from both &quot;street and dance music&quot; aficionados and mainstream music critics, including Robert Christgau from &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, who described it in a January 1986 article as &quot;the most engaging and original rap album of the year&quot;. LL Cool J&#x27;s aggressive rapping and Rick Rubin&#x27;s stripped-down production were praised by critics who also agreed that LL&#x27;s lyrics set a new standard for MC&#x27;s at the time. The songs&#x27; lyrics were favored by critics who described LL&#x27;s songwriting as clever and fun. Connie Johnson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that he is an integral artist of hip hop&#x27;s &quot;second generation&quot; because of his &quot;razor-sharp wit&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Debby Bull was impressed by his songwriting and how its originality lies in the ballads, even though &quot;it&#x27;s the sassier, dance-worthy songs that make this record such an irresistible party.&quot; The critical success of the album would later result in its comparison to other LL Cool J albums, which were not as critically successful as &quot;Radio&quot;. In his review for the &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, Ira Robbins called the album a &quot;primary classic of hip-hop&#x27;s original commercial surge&quot; and went on to write:

Since its initial reception, &quot;Radio&quot; has been viewed by fans and critics as LL Cool J&#x27;s greatest work, as well as one of hip hop&#x27;s best albums. In retrospect, some critics and music writers have given more praise to producer Rick Rubin&#x27;s contributions to &quot;Radio&quot;, as well as note the importance of his production on the album. Yahoo! Music&#x27;s Frank Meyer said that the album was &quot;one of the earliest records, along with &quot;Run-DMC&quot;, to combine the vocal approach of rap with the musical arrangements and riffing of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. &#x27;I Can&#x27;t Live Without My Radio&#x27; is a hip-hop classic and this album set the standard for East Coast rap for a long time.&quot;

&quot;Radio&quot; was later ranked at number 2 on &quot;ego trip&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Hip Hop&#x27;s Greatest Albums (1979–1985)&quot; list, number 69 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;100 Best Albums of the 80s&quot;, and number 71 on &quot;Blender&quot; &quot;100 Greatest American Albums of All Time&quot; list. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 478 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time; it was ranked number 470 in a revised list in 2012. The magazine also included &quot;Radio&quot; in their 1997 issue&#x27;s list of &quot;The Essential 200 Rock Records&quot;. In 1998, the album was selected as one of &quot;The Source&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Best Rap Albums&quot;.

== Legacy and influence ==
With the breakthrough success of his hit single &quot;I Need a Beat&quot; and the &quot;Radio&quot; LP, LL Cool J became one of the first hip-hop acts to achieve mainstream success along with Kurtis Blow and Run-DMC. Gigs at larger venues were offered to LL as he would join the 1986–&#x27;87 &quot;Raising Hell&quot; tour, opening for Run-DMC and Beastie Boys. Another milestone of LL&#x27;s popularity was his appearance on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; as the first hip hop act on the show.

The album&#x27;s success also helped in contributing to Rick Rubin&#x27;s credibility and repertoire as a record producer. &quot;Radio&quot;, along with &quot;Raising Hell&quot; (1986) and &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; (1986), would form a trilogy of New York City-based, Rubin-helmed albums that helped to diversify hip-hop. Rubin&#x27;s production credit on the back cover reads &quot;REDUCED BY RICK RUBIN&quot;, referring to his minimalist production style, which gave the album its stripped-down and gritty sound. This style would serve as one of Rubin&#x27;s production trademarks and would have a great impact on future hip-hop productions. Rubin&#x27;s early hip hop production work, before his exit from Def Jam to Los Angeles, helped solidify his legacy as a hip hop pioneer and establish his reputation in the music industry.

&quot;Radio&quot;″s release coincided with the growing new school scene and subculture, which also marked the beginning of hip-hop&#x27;s &quot;golden age&quot; and the replacement of old school hip hop. This period of hip hop was marked by the end of the disco rap stylings of old school, which had flourished prior to the mid-80s, and the rise of a new style featuring &quot;ghetto blasters&quot;. &quot;Radio&quot; served as one of the earliest records, along with Run-D.M.C.&#x27;s debut album, to combine the vocal approach of hip hop and rapping with the musical arrangements and riffing sound of rock music, pioneering the rap rock hybrid sound.

The emerging new school scene was initially characterized by drum machine-led minimalism, often tinged with elements of rock, as well as boasts about rapping delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In image as in song, the artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude. These elements contrasted sharply with the 1970s P-Funk and disco-influenced outfits, live bands, synthesizers and party rhymes of acts prevalent in 1984, rendering them old school. In contrast to the lengthy, jam-like form predominant throughout early hip hop (&quot;King Tim III&quot;, &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot;, &quot;The Breaks&quot;), new school artists tended to compose shorter songs that would be more accessible and had potential for radio play, and conceive more cohesive LPs than their old school counterparts; the style typified by LL Cool J&#x27;s &quot;Radio&quot;. A leading example of the new school sound is the song &quot;I Can&#x27;t Live Without My Radio&quot;, a loud, defiant declaration of public loyalty to his boom box, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;quintessential rap in its directness, immediacy and assertion of self&quot;. It was featured in the film &quot;Krush Groove&quot; (1985), which was based on the rise of Def Jam and new school acts such as Run-D.M.C. and the Fat Boys.

The energy and hardcore delivery and musical style of rapping featured on &quot;Radio&quot;, as well as other new school recordings by artists such as Run-D.M.C., Schooly D, T La Rock and Steady B, proved to be influential to hip hop acts of the &quot;golden age&quot; such as Boogie Down Productions and Public Enemy. The decline of the old school form of hip hop also led to the closing of Sugar Hill Records, one of the labels that helped contribute to early hip-hop and that, coincidentally, rejected LL&#x27;s demo tape. As the album served as an example of an expansion of hip hop music&#x27;s artistic possibilities, its commercial success and distinct sound soon led to an increase in multi-racial audiences and listeners, adding to the legacy of the album and hip hop as well.

<text>Fred Fisher (born Alfred Breitenbach; September 30, 1875 – January 14, 1942) was a German-born American songwriter and Tin Pan Alley music publisher.

==Biography==
Fisher was born in Cologne, Germany. His parents were Max and Theodora Breitenbach. After visiting the United States in 1892, he immigrated in 1900, where he adopted the name Fred Fischer. He founded the Fred Fischer Music Publishing Company in 1907. During World War I he changed his surname to Fisher to make it seem less Germanic.

In 1914, Fred Fisher married Ana Fisher (&quot;&quot; Davidovitch, later anglicized as Davis; born 1896). Their children – Daniel (&quot;Danny&quot;; 1920–2001), Marvin (1916–1993), and Doris (1915–2003) – also wrote songs professionally. Fisher died by suicide in Manhattan, New York, and was interred at Maimonides Cemetery in Brooklyn.

In 1970, Fred Fisher was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Ripley&#x27;s &quot;Believe It or Not&quot; column credited him with writing more Irish songs than anyone else.

<text>Alfred Bryan (September 15, 1871 – April 1, 1958) was a Canadian lyricist.

Bryan was born in Brantford, Ontario. He worked as an arranger in New York and wrote lyrics for many Broadway shows in the late 1910s and early 1920s; often collaborating with composer Jean Schwartz. In the 1920s he moved to Hollywood to write lyrics for screen musicals.

Bryan worked with several composers during his career. Among his collaborators were Henriette Blanke-Belcher, Fred Fischer, Al Sherman, Larry Stock and Joe McCarthy. Perhaps his most successful song was &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier&quot; (1915), with music by Al Piantadosi. The song sold 650,000 copies during the first three months and became one of 1915&#x27;s top-selling songs in the United States. Although Bryan himself was not a committed pacifist, he described the American public&#x27;s anti-war sentiments in his lyrics.

He died in Gladstone, New Jersey, aged 86.

<doc id="211556" wikidata="Q1443434" url="?curid=211556" title="Instructions per cycle">
<text>In computer architecture, instructions per cycle (IPC), commonly called instructions per clock, is one aspect of a processor&#x27;s performance: the average number of instructions executed for each clock cycle. It is the multiplicative inverse of cycles per instruction.

== Explanation ==
While early generations of CPUs carried out all the steps to execute an instruction sequentially, modern CPUs can do many things in parallel. As it is impossible to just keep doubling the speed of the clock, instruction pipelining and superscalar processor design have evolved so CPUs can use a variety of execution units in parallel - looking ahead through the incoming instructions in order to optimise them. This leads to the &quot;instructions per cycle completed&quot; being much higher than 1 and is responsible for much of the speed improvements in subsequent CPU generations.

=== Calculation of IPC ===
The calculation of IPC is done through running a set piece of code, calculating the number of machine-level instructions required to complete it, then using high-performance timers to calculate the number of clock cycles required to complete it on the actual hardware. The final result comes from dividing the number of instructions by the number of CPU clock cycles.

The number of instructions per second and floating point operations per second for a processor can be derived by multiplying the number of instructions per cycle with the clock rate (cycles per second given in Hertz) of the processor in question. The number of instructions per second is an approximate indicator of the likely performance of the processor.

The number of instructions executed per clock is not a constant for a given processor; it depends on how the particular software being run interacts with the processor, and indeed the entire machine, particularly the memory hierarchy. However, certain processor features tend to lead to designs that have higher-than-average IPC values; the presence of multiple arithmetic logic units (an ALU is a processor subsystem that can perform elementary arithmetic and logical operations), and short pipelines. When comparing different instruction sets, a simpler instruction set may lead to a higher IPC figure than an implementation of a more complex instruction set using the same chip technology; however, the more complex instruction set may be able to achieve more useful work with fewer instructions. As such comparing IPC figures between different instruction sets (for example x86 vs ARM) is usually meaningless.

== Computer speed ==
The useful work that can be done with any computer depends on many factors besides the processor speed. These factors include the instruction set architecture, the processor&#x27;s microarchitecture, and the computer system organization (such as the design of the disk storage system and the capabilities and performance of other attached devices), the efficiency of the operating system, and the high-level design of application software.

For computer users and purchasers, application benchmarks, rather than instructions per cycle, are typically a much more useful indication of system performance. However, IPC does provide an example of why clock speed is not the only factor relevant to computer performance.

<doc id="211557" wikidata="Q753494" url="?curid=211557" title="Doggystyle">
<text>Doggystyle is the debut studio album by American rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg. It was released on November 23, 1993, by Death Row and Interscope Records. The album was recorded and produced following Snoop Doggy Dogg&#x27;s appearances on Dr. Dre&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;The Chronic&quot; (1992), to which Snoop contributed significantly. The West Coast style in hip-hop that he developed from Dre&#x27;s first album continued on &quot;Doggystyle&quot;. Critics have praised Snoop Dogg for the lyrical &quot;realism&quot; that he delivers on the album and for his distinctive vocal flow.

Despite some mixed criticism of the album initially upon its release, &quot;Doggystyle&quot; earned recognition from many music critics as one of the most significant albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the most important hip-hop albums ever released. Much like &quot;The Chronic&quot;, the distinctive sounds of &quot;Doggystyle&quot; helped introduce the hip-hop subgenre of G-funk to a mainstream audience, bringing forward West Coast hip-hop as a dominant force in the early-mid 1990s.

&quot;Doggystyle&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 806,858 copies in its first week alone in the United States, which was the record for a debuting artist and the fastest-selling hip-hop album ever at the time. &quot;Doggystyle&quot; was included on &quot;The Source&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Best Rap Albums, as well as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of Essential Recordings of the &#x27;90s. About.com placed the album in No. 17 of the greatest hip hop/rap albums of all time. The album was certified 4× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). By November 2015, the album had sold 7 million copies in the United States, and over 11 million copies worldwide.

== Conception ==
=== Background ===
In 1992, Snoop Dogg came to attention of the music industry through his vocal contributions on Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;The Chronic&quot;. That album is considered to have &quot;transformed the entire sound of West Coast rap&quot; by its development of what later became known as the &quot;G-funk&quot; sound. &quot;The Chronic&quot; expanded gangsta rap with profanity, anti-authoritarian lyrics and multi-layered samples taken from 1970&#x27;s P-Funk records. Snoop Doggy Dogg contributed vocals to Dre&#x27;s solo single, &quot;Deep Cover&quot;, which led to a high degree of anticipation among hip hop for the release of his own solo album.

&quot;Doggystyle&quot; and &quot;The Chronic&quot; are associated with each other mainly because each prominently featured Snoop Dogg and because both contain G-funk style production from Dr. Dre. The two releases are linked by the high number of vocal contributions from Death Row Records artists, including Tha Dogg Pound, RBX, The Lady of Rage, while both contain a high density of misogyny and profanity in their lyrics. In addition, the two albums are each viewed by critics as early &quot;G-funk classics&quot;, and have been described as &quot;joined at the hip&quot;. &#x27;Doggystyle&#x27; also marked the debut of Death Row vocalist, Nanci Fletcher—the daughter of jazz legend Sam Fletcher.

Gangsta rap has been criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang violence and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing &quot;Doggystyle&quot; in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album&#x27;s realism, and the extent to which it is based on his personal experience. He said, &quot;I can&#x27;t rap about something I don&#x27;t know. You&#x27;ll never hear me rapping about no bachelor&#x27;s degree. It&#x27;s only what I know and that&#x27;s that street life. It&#x27;s all everyday life, reality.&quot; Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. &quot;For little kids growing up in the ghettos,&quot; he said, &quot;it&#x27;s easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I&#x27;ve seen what that was like, and I don&#x27;t glorify it, but I don&#x27;t preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves.&quot; He further explained the &quot;dream&quot; that he would pursue after making the album: &quot;I&#x27;m going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I&#x27;ll be on a mission for peace. I know I have a lot of power. I know if I say, &#x27;Don&#x27;t kill&#x27;, niggas won&#x27;t kill&quot;.

=== Recording ===

&quot;Doggystyle&quot; was recorded in early 1993 at Death Row Studios. It was produced in a style similar to &quot;The Chronic&quot;; some critics called it a &quot;carbon copy&quot;. Snoop Doggy Dogg collaborated with two music groups, 213 and Tha Dogg Pound. Daz Dillinger, of the latter group, accused Dr. Dre of taking sole recognition for producing the album and alleged that Warren G and himself contributed substantially to the production of the project. Death Row Records co-founder Marion &quot;Suge&quot; Knight stated in 2013 that, &quot;Daz pretty much did the whole album&quot;, and that credit was signed over to Dr. Dre for a fee. Snoop Doggy Dogg said Dr. Dre was capable of making beats without the help of collaborators and addressed the issues with Warren G and Daz, stating &quot;They made beats, Dre produced that record&quot;. He discussed the track &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Fun (If the Homies Can&#x27;t Have None)&quot;, mentioning that Daz and Warren G brought Dr. Dre the beat but &quot;Dre took that muthafucka to the next level!&quot; Bruce Williams, closely affiliated with Dr. Dre, discussed the recording process during Dre&#x27;s time at Death Row Records, stating:

Williams said the album was never finished and because of the demand for the record, the distributors insisted the album be completed, otherwise they would cancel the album&#x27;s orders. This resulted in Dr. Dre mixing the album and inserting the skits within 48 hours, which enabled the album to be released. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Jonathan Gold described how Dr. Dre produced a beat from scratch to complete instrumental: &quot;Dre may find something he likes from an old drum break, loop it and gradually replace each part with a better tom-tom sound, a kick-drum sound he adores, until the beat bears the same relationship to the original that the Incredible Hulk does to Bill Bixby&quot;. Gold also described how the track progressed with other musicians adding to the song, stating &quot;A bass player wanders in, unpacks his instrument and pops a funky two-note bass line over the beat, then leaves to watch CNN, though his two notes keep looping into infinity. A smiling guy in a striped jersey plays a nasty one-fingered melody on an old Minimoog synthesizer that&#x27;s been obsolete since 1982, and Dre scratches in a sort of surfadelic munching noise, and then from his well-stocked Akai MPC60 samples comes a shriek, a spare piano chord, an ejaculation from the first Beastie&#x27;s record—&#x27;Let me clear my throat&#x27;—and the many-layered groove is happening, bumping, breathing, almost loud enough to see.&quot;

While recording &quot;Doggystyle&quot; with Dr. Dre in August 1993, Snoop Dogg was arrested in connection with the death of Phillip Woldermarian, a member of a rival gang who was shot and killed in a gang fight. According to the charges, the rapper&#x27;s bodyguard shot Woldermarian as Snoop Dogg drove the vehicle; the rapper claimed it was self-defense, alleging the victim was stalking him. He spent most of 1995 preparing the case which went to trial in late 1995. He was cleared of all charges in February 1996 when he began working on his second album, &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot;.

=== Title significance and artwork ===
The album&#x27;s title alludes to the doggy style sex position and is a reference to the musician&#x27;s name. The artwork was done by the late artist Darryl &quot;Joe Cool&quot; Daniel, Snoop Dogg&#x27;s cousin, who died in July 2024. The artwork represents the themes covered in the album and the style of implementation of those ideas. Some critics believe the artwork portrays a woman merely as a hole to be filled by the man, which they believe adheres to the narcissistic and sexist lyrical themes Snoop Dogg covers. In this interpretation, the cover art and lyrics convey what they refer to as the self-indulgent &quot;gangsta&quot; lifestyle, drugs, cars, sex, and money. The artwork uses several quotes from the 1982 George Clinton single &quot;Atomic Dog&quot;. The quotes come from the dogs at the top of the brick wall on the album cover, which say, &quot;Why must I feel like dat?&quot;, &quot;Why must I chase da cat?&quot; and &quot;Nuttin&#x27; but da dogg in me&quot;.

== Music ==
=== Production ===
Dre&#x27;s handling of the production was praised by critics. AllMusic writer Stephen Erlewine stated: &quot;Dre realized that it wasn&#x27;t time to push the limits of G-funk, and instead decided to deepen it musically, creating easy-rolling productions that have more layers than they appear&quot;. He added that the beats were &quot;laid-back funky, continuing to resonate after many listens&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Touré noted &quot;&quot;The Chronic&quot;″s slow, heavy beats were a sonic representation of angry depression as accurate as Cobain&#x27;s feedback blasts; &quot;Doggystyle&quot; is leaner, with its high-tempo Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield-derived tracks&quot;. He went on to say that &quot;Most of Dre&#x27;s hooks and nearly all his beats refuse to linger, as if the songs themselves are nervous, fearful of exposure, restless to get offscreen.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine&#x27;s David Browne mentioned that &quot;The mix of samples and live music on Dre&#x27;s latest, &quot;The Chronic&quot;, gave it texture and depth, and he continues his knob-turning growth on &quot;Doggystyle&quot;, fluidly weaving together a gaggle of background singers and rappers, quirky samples, his trademark horror-flick keyboard lines&quot;. The Source magazine columnist wrote: &quot;Dre&#x27;s brand of G-funk may be common now, but it is still painstakingly well-produced&quot;.

In 2023, former Death Row CEO, Suge Knight, stated that Daz Dillinger had actually produced the album.

=== Lyrics ===
Snoop Doggy Dogg&#x27;s lyrics were generally praised by critics, although they caused some controversy. He was acclaimed for the realism in his rhymes and his harmonious flow. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Erlewine commended Snoop Doggy Dogg, saying: &quot;he&#x27;s one of hip-hop&#x27;s greatest vocal stylists with this record&quot; and he &quot;takes his time, playing with the flow of his words, giving his rhymes a nearly melodic eloquence. Snoop is something special, with unpredictable turns of phrase, evocative imagery, and a distinctive, addictive flow&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Christopher John Farley noted &quot;Snoop&#x27;s rapping isn&#x27;t flashy, but it is catchy&quot; and stated &quot;His relaxed vocal style is a perfect match for Dre&#x27;s bass-heavy producing. Snoop&#x27;s voice is lithe enough to snake its way around the big beats,&quot; said Farley on November 29, 1993. 

The ideas put forward through the lyrics include Snoop Doggy Dogg&#x27;s adolescent urges, as he freely talks of casual sex, smoking marijuana and gunning down rival gang members. &quot;Time&quot; magazine remarked that the notions &quot;are often unnecessarily graphic; at some points they&#x27;re downright obscene&quot; and that &quot;the album would have been stronger if such misgivings about the criminal life, as well as Snoop&#x27;s touches of introspection, had been applied to some of the cruder songs&quot;. The album also covered gun play, drug dealing and pimping. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the lyrical concepts were delivered in &quot;crudest, rudest terms&quot;.

Some critics said Snoop Doggy Dogg was &quot;obsessed with being a &#x27;G&#x27;, a gangster, a lawbreaker who smokes dope and kills with impunity&quot; and that his lyrics depict the black-on-black crime in the inner-cities. The lyrics involve many derogatory terms against women, with expressions such as &quot;bitches&quot; and &quot;hoes&quot; being used throughout, which illustrates the feeling of sexism and oppression within American society. In certain tracks Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tha Dogg Pound casually speak of group sex, illustrating the demeaning of women. Snoop Doggy Dogg&#x27;s lyrics depict drugs, alcohol, sex, and money as methods of escape from oppression, but they also show an underside of the &quot;gangsta&quot; lifestyle and the results of following this lifestyle. The lyrics&#x27; violent representations, including murder and aggressive behaviour, have also generated controversy. C. DeLores Tucker of the National Political Congress of Black Women named gangsta rap &quot;a profane and obscene glorification of murder and rape&quot;, which can be attributed to &quot;Doggystyle&quot;.

&quot;Who Am I? (What&#x27;s My Name?)&quot; was the first single released from the album, on November 11, 1993. It peaked at No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart and reached No. 1 on the Hot Rap Singles, receiving a Gold certification from the RIAA on February 8, 1994. It reached No. 20 on the UK Singles Chart in 1994 and re-entered the chart in 2004, reaching No. 100.

&quot;Gin and Juice&quot; was the second single released on January 18, 1994. Like the previous single, it was a hit on multiple charts. It reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, No. 13 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks, No. 1 on Hot Rap Singles, and No. 39 on the UK Singles Chart. The RIAA certified it Gold on April 6, 1994. The song was nominated at the 1995 Grammy Awards for Best Rap Solo Performance, but lost to Queen Latifah&#x27;s &quot;U.N.I.T.Y.&quot;. &quot;Doggy Dogg World&quot; was released as a Europe-only single on August 8, 1994. Even though the single was not officially released in the U.S., it received some radio airplay which resulted in position 19 on the Rhythmic Top 40 chart. A music video was produced for the single, which gained American video TV-play and won the 1994 MTV Video Music Award for Best Rap Video. It reached No. 32 on the UK Singles Chart.

&quot;Lodi Dodi&quot; and &quot;Murder Was the Case&quot; were not official singles, but they received radio airplay and charted in Rhythmic Top 40. An 18-minute music video was shot for the two songs, with an accompanying &quot;Murder Was the Case&quot; soundtrack. The video won the 1995 Video of the Year award at The Source Hip-Hop Music Awards. &quot;Gin and Juice&quot; was nominated at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Rap Solo Performance. A bonus track, &quot;Gz Up, Hoes Down&quot;, was included in the album&#x27;s first pressing, but not in later versions because of sample clearance issues. Snoop Doggy Dogg could not gain the rights to use the beats because the record company was not willing to pay license fees for using the samples. &quot;Gz Up, Hoes Down&quot; was later released on the Death Row compilation &quot;15 Years on Death Row&quot;.

A track titled &quot;Tha Next Episode&quot; was listed as the last track on the back cover of the first pressings, but not included in any pressing. It is considered the original material used for the 2000 Dr. Dre single &quot;The Next Episode&quot; but bears no resemblance to the later song. It was 4 minutes and 36 seconds (4:36) long. &quot;Tha Next Episode&quot; was later released on the Dr. Dre mixtape &quot;Pretox&quot; under the name &quot;Chronic Unreleased Studio Session&quot;, but only 1:10 long. &quot;Doggystyle&quot; featuring George Clinton was a 5:26 long outtake from the album sessions. It is a singing melody with vocals dominating the song and it extensively samples &quot;Oh I&quot; by Funkadelic from their album &quot;The Electric Spanking of War Babies&quot;. Jewell &amp; The Brides of Funkenstein are featured on the chorus. The song was released on &quot;Death Row: The Lost Sessions Vol. 1&quot; amongst other songs recorded by Snoop Doggy Dogg during his tenure at Death Row.

== Legacy and influence ==
=== Hip-hop music ===
&quot;Doggystyle&quot; is seen by many hip hop pundits as a &quot;classic&quot;. It is credited with defining West Coast hip hop; shifting the emphasis to more melodious, synth-driven, and funk-induced beats. About.com stated during the period the album was released, &quot;Gangsta rap never sounded so sweet.&quot; The album is credited for further establishment of the slurred &quot;lazy drawl&quot; that sacrificed lyrical complexity for clarity and rhythmic cadence on &quot;Doggystyle&quot; and &quot;The Chronic&quot;. The album is considered one of the first G-funk albums, the style of which many rappers duplicated in later years.

=== Hip-hop culture ===
It has been suggested by some writers and publications that &quot;Doggystyle&quot; has considerably affected African-American culture. Some publications have held the rap genre responsible for social problems such as sexual violence and sexism, which has been blamed on Snoop Doggy Dogg and other rappers for calling their controversial lyrics &quot;keeping it real.&quot; The problems of sexual violence and sexism are attributed to lyrics degrading women such as &quot;bitches&quot; and &quot;ho&#x27;s,&quot; which some believe have influenced black males. Snoop Doggy Dogg and other hip hop artists, including N.W.A, especially Eazy-E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube (due to their success) and 2Pac, have been held accountable for developing the gangsta rap form; a genre which articulated the rage of the urban underclass and its sense of intense oppression and defiant rebellion, which has been attained through the ability to communicate free of censorship, and has allowed hip hop culture to become a dominant style and ethos throughout the world. Mariah Carey sampled the song &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Fun (If the Homies Can&#x27;t Have None)&quot; in her 1999 album &quot;Rainbow&quot; for the remix of Heartbreaker which featured Missy Elliott and Da Brat.

The writers of &quot;Enculturation&quot;, Steven Best and Douglas Kellner, have noted that Snoop Doggy Dogg and other rappers only condemn violence when it is directed against them, otherwise &quot;they celebrate it, internalize it, and embrace it as an ethos and means of self expression,&quot; which some believe has an effect on the black-on-black crime. The release of music videos from &quot;Doggystyle&quot; and &quot;The Chronic&quot; has enabled the artists to add visual illustrations to their lyrics, which generally involve Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg driving around South Central Los Angeles in a lowrider (a vehicle with lowered suspension). This imagery of the &quot;gangsta lifestyle&quot; is thought to have influenced young black males into trying to live the same lifestyle and it is also noted by T. Denean, writer of &quot;Pimps Up, Ho&#x27;s Down: Hip Hop&#x27;s Hold on Young Black Women&quot;, that the videos highlight the representation of class, race and Black masculinity within contemporary urban America.

=== Subsequent work ===
&quot;Doggystyle&quot; is generally considered Snoop Dogg&#x27;s best album, in addition to being his highest charting and best-selling album as his later albums were certified double Platinum, Platinum or Gold although Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told was certified double Platinum making it his second best selling album and also his only other one to be certified multi Platinum. 

It differs from following albums as his later work featured production from multiple individuals, such as The Neptunes, Timbaland and Daz Dillinger, with reduced input from Dr. Dre, which shows a shift from G-funk production. Snoop Doggy Dogg&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot; (1996), did not involve Dr. Dre, as he left Death Row Records. As a result, DJ Pooh was the main beat-maker for the album. &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot; followed the methods of a G-funk record and initially sold well, but received mixed reviews and failed to produce a major hit single. In 1998, Snoop Dogg left Death Row and joined No Limit Records, changing his stage name from Snoop Doggy Dogg to Snoop Dogg. During his tenure at the label, he continued several of the themes from &quot;Doggystyle&quot; with follow-ups to earlier songs, such as &quot;Gin &amp; Juice II&quot; (1998) and &quot;Snoop Dogg (What&#x27;s My Name II)&quot; (2000).

Subsequent studio albums such as &quot;Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss&quot; (2002) and &quot;R&amp;G (Rhythm &amp; Gangsta): The Masterpiece&quot; (2004) exhibited a more mainstream, pop-oriented theme with new sounds, but remained &quot;hardcore throughout&quot; and featured &quot;plenty of street and commercial appeal&quot;. These releases included three hit singles, &quot;Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Drop It Like It&#x27;s Hot&quot; and &quot;Signs&quot;. Snoop Dogg was credited for returning to his G-funk roots in 2006, which was established with his eighth studio album, &quot;Tha Blue Carpet Treatment&quot; (2006). The album was noted for being a &quot;hard and very G-Funk record&quot;.

In March 2022, &quot;Doggystyle&quot; and other Death Row albums were removed from all streaming platforms.

In October 2022, Snoop announced a spiritual sequel of the album, &quot;Missionary&quot;, also produced by Dr. Dre. The album was released by Death Row Records and Dr. Dre&#x27;s label, Aftermath, on December 13, 2024.

On March 10, 2023, &quot;Doggystyle&quot; and many other Death Row releases were brought back to streaming services.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Doggystyle&quot; was released to widespread critical acclaim. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Touré mentioned &quot;&quot;Doggystyle&quot; is filled with verbal and vocal feats that meet its high expectations. It speeds through 55 minutes of constant talk as if on a suicide hot line&quot;. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted &quot;It is the most limber, low-rider gangsta album to date&quot; and went on to say &quot;&quot;Doggystyle&quot; is a grim, bleak-faced record. It&#x27;s set in a dead-end, no-tomorrow world of cheap thrills&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated &quot;&quot;Doggystyle&quot; and &quot;The Chronic&quot; stand proudly together as the twin pinnacles of West Coast G-funk hip-hop of the early &#x27;90s&quot; &quot;Stylus&quot; magazine presented &quot;The Chronic vs. Doggystyle&quot; article, and stated a strong point of &quot;Doggystyle&quot; compared to Dre&#x27;s album was its follow-up singles and that &quot;some of the album tracks are more famous than the singles&quot;. 

&quot;Vibe&quot; magazine expressed that &quot;Snoop is no ordinary gangsta; that&#x27;s impossible for an artist this playful. On his debut, with Dre riding shotgun anthems abound as often as gin-soaked debauchery&quot;. &quot;The Source&quot; magazine gave the album a 4/5 mic rating. It said Snoop Doggy Dogg emerged as a rapper who lived up to all the advance hype which came from his work on &quot;The Chronic&quot;, and discussed songs on the record, stating &quot;If &#x27;Murder Was The Case&#x27; is a stroke of near genius, then &#x27;Lodi Dodi&#x27; is an example of total genius.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; magazine called the lead single &quot;a pinnacle he conquered effortlessly&quot; and went on to name the record a &quot;benchmark album&quot;.

The album also received some negative criticism. Erlewine mentioned the album did not &quot;surprise or offer anything that wasn&#x27;t already on &quot;The Chronic&quot;&quot;. Christopher John Farley noted Snoop Doggy Dogg had little examination over his emotions and feelings. David Browne spoke of &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Fun&quot;, stating it was an example of how &quot;musically artful, yet lyrically repellent, this album can be&quot; and went on to say, &quot;It&#x27;s easy to be impressed one moment and appalled the next&quot;. Renowned rock critic Robert Christgau gave the album a &quot;dud&quot; rating, which signifies &quot;a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought. At the upper level it may merely be overrated, disappointing, or dull. Down below it may be contemptible.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; Danny Kelly observed: &quot;Snoop Doggy Dogg&#x27;s record is more or less a 19-track homage to/gleeful rip off of George Clinton&#x27;s &#x27;Atomic Dog&#x27; ... It&#x27;s inclined to become a touch unimaginative; a tad, let&#x27;s be honest, dull ... And the sleeve competes with The Waterboys&#x27; &quot;Dream Harder&quot; and Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;River of Dreams&quot; as the worst attached to a recent release.&quot;

Despite the initial mixed criticism, critical perception of the album later improved, as &quot;Doggystyle&quot; has earned several accolades and rankings on critics&#x27; &quot;best album&quot; lists. A review of the album&#x27;s reissue upped &quot;Q&quot; rating from three to four stars out of five. &quot;A modern classic,&quot; observed reviewer Tom Doyle. In 2020, &quot;Doggystyle&quot; placed 340 in Rolling Stone&#x27;s Top 500 Albums of All Time. The album was also placed at number 84 on Apple Music&#x27;s 100 Best Albums list in 2024.

=== Accolades ===
== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Doggystyle&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, powered by spectacular first week sales of 806,000 copies. In the second week &quot;Doggystyle&quot; remained at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 378,000 copies. In the third week the album dropped to number 2 on the chart, selling 259,000. In the fourth week the album dropped to number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 297,000 copies. In the fifth week the album remained number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 407,000 copies. In the sixth week the album returned to the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 270,000 copies, marking &quot;Doggystyle&#x27;s&quot; last week at the top of the chart to date. &quot;Doggystyle&quot; topped the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart for five weeks.
As of November 2015, the album had sold seven million copies in the United States, and over eleven million copies worldwide.

It was certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on May 31, 1994. It is Snoop Doggy Dogg&#x27;s most successful album; his following albums were certified single or double platinum. &quot;Doggystyle&quot; first appeared on music charts in 1993, peaking on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums at No. 1. It re-peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in January 1994, when it was already certified three times platinum by the RIAA. The record was mildly successful in Europe, reaching No. 18 in Sweden, No. 21 in Germany and No. 35 in Austria. It also peaked at No. 25 on the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand album chart. At the end of 1994, the album was No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End Top Albums Chart and No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart. It re-entered the charts in 2003, peaking on the Ireland Albums Top 75 at No. 70. , it had spent a total of 74 nonconsecutive weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart.

== Track listing ==
* All songs produced by Dr. Dre.
===Notes===
*&quot;Gz Up, Hoes Down&quot; was included on initial album pressings, but was subsequently omitted due to sample clearance issues. It was later included on the 2006 compilation, &quot;15 Years on Death Row&quot;, as well as 30th anniversary vinyl and CD pressings.
*2001 pressings and onwards condense the album&#x27;s interludes with the proceeding tracks; totaling 13 tracks.
*On the U.S. original release&#x27;s back cover &quot;Gz Up, Hoes Down&quot; is erroneously listed after &quot;Pump Pump&quot; instead of immediately before. 
*Original pressings in Europe features track names for all interludes - the interlude track names listed above are taken from the said European release. &quot;W Balls&quot; was the only interlude listed on the original American release. All interludes, including &quot;W Balls&quot; were later omitted from all track listings. 
*The original pressings of the album, which contains &quot;Gz Up, Hoes Down&quot;, list an outro track titled, &quot;Tha Next Episode&quot;, but does not feature on any pressings of the album. A low-quality recording of the song later leaked online sometime in the late 2000s.

===Cut tracks===
*&quot;Tha Next Episode&quot;, produced by and featuring Dr. Dre, was listed on the track listing provided to retailers before the album&#x27;s release, but does not feature on any pressings of the album. A similar instrumental (i.e., it used the same sample as its main melody) was later used for Warren G&#x27;s track &quot;Runnin&#x27; Wit No Breaks&quot; from his 1994 debut album, &quot;Regulate...G Funk Era&quot; Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre later recorded a track titled &quot;The Next Episode&quot; for Dre&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;2001&quot;, which is completely different from the original.
*&quot;Doggystyle&quot;, featuring Jewell and George Clinton, was recorded during the album sessions but remained unreleased until its inclusion on the compilation album &quot;Death Row: The Lost Sessions Vol. 1&quot;
*&quot;The Root of All Evil (Outro)&quot;, featuring Teena Marie, was recorded during the album sessions but remained unreleased until its inclusion on the compilation album &quot;Death Row: The Lost Sessions Vol. 1&quot;. The instrumental was later significantly reworked and used for the remix of &quot;California Love&quot;, by 2Pac featuring Dr. Dre.
*&quot;Every Single Day&quot;, featuring Kurupt, Jewell and Nate Dogg, was recorded during the album sessions, remaining unreleased until an alternate version was released on &quot;Tha Dogg Pound&quot; compilation album &quot;2002&quot;.

<text>DJ Hollywood (born Anthony Holloway; December 10, 1954) is an American MC and disc jockey. His rhythmic MC sets have led him to be credited as one of the first-ever rappers.

==Career==
In the 1970s, DJ Hollywood became known for DJ sets during which he addressed the audience with rhythmic call-and-response segments. In contrast to earlier MCs like Coke La Rock, who simply spoke over backing tracks, DJ Hollywood incorporated rhythm and rhyme into his sets, which has led him to be described as the progenitor of &quot;hip-hop-style rapping&quot; by figures such as Kurtis Blow and author Jonathan Abrams. Abrams identifies DJ Hollywood&#x27;s influences as Jocko Henderson, Pigmeat Markham, Gil Scott-Heron, and Rudy Ray Moore.

In 1978 and 1979, DJ Hollywood was the first DJ to bring turntables and a mixer to perform at the Apollo Theater. Before long, club owners in the South Bronx hired Hollywood to play at a club called Club 371.

Most of DJ Hollywood&#x27;s body of musical work was live, not recorded, although he did release a single &quot;Shock Shock The House&quot; in 1980 on CBS Records. Until the mid-1980s, Hollywood was one of the top DJs. He retired from the business and struggled with drug addiction. He has since returned to performing in the New York City area, appearing with Tha Veteranz which reunited him with his former partner Lovebug Starski.

DJ Hollywood is featured in the 2024 PBS series &quot;Disco: Soundtrack of a Revolution&quot;.

<text>Doris Fisher (May 2, 1915 – January 15, 2003) was an American singer and songwriter, collaborating both as lyricist and composer. She co-wrote many popular songs in the 1940s, including &quot;Whispering Grass&quot;, &quot;You Always Hurt the One You Love&quot;, &quot;Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall&quot;, &quot;That Ole Devil Called Love&quot;, and &quot;Put the Blame on Mame.&quot; Her songs were recorded by the Ink Spots, Louis Prima, Billie Holiday, Bing Crosby, the Andrews Sisters, Pearl Bailey, the Mills Brothers and Ella Fitzgerald amongst others.

==Early life==
Fisher was born in New York, the daughter of noted songwriter Fred Fisher. Her brothers Dan Fisher (&quot;Good Morning Heartache&quot;) and Marvin Fisher (&quot;When Sunny Gets Blue&quot;) also became songwriters.

==Career==
In the late 1930s, she sang regularly on radio station WOR with Eddy Duchin&#x27;s band. She also performed with other big bands including Count Basie, and led the vocal group Penny Wise and Her Wise Guys who recorded for the Vocalion label in 1938. Her first hit composition came the same year, co-writing the novelty song &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; with its performer, Slim Gaillard. Following its success, she began writing songs for Mike Todd&#x27;s &quot;Star and Garter&quot; revue on Broadway.

In 1940, she co-wrote with her father the song, &quot;Whispering Grass&quot; for The Ink Spots. Her most successful songwriting period came after she met lyricist Allan Roberts in 1944, in her father&#x27;s office at the Brill Building. Within a year of starting to work together, they co-wrote &quot;You Always Hurt the One You Love&quot;, a no.1 hit that year for the Mills Brothers and in 2017 the Mills Brothers version was inducted into The Grammy Hall of Fame; &quot;Good, Good, Good (That&#x27;s You, That&#x27;s You)&quot;, recorded by Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters; &quot;Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall&quot;, another no. 1 hit for the Ink Spots with Ella Fitzgerald; &quot;That Ole Devil Called Love&quot; recorded by Billie Holiday; &quot;Angelina (The Waitress at the Pizzeria)&quot;, a hit for Louis Prima; &quot;Tampico&quot;, a hit by Stan Kenton; and &quot;Invitation to the Blues&quot;, which she co-wrote with Roberts and Arthur Gershwin, the younger brother of George and Ira Gershwin and which was first recorded by Ella Mae Morse.

In 1945, she and Roberts were signed by Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures in Hollywood to a seven-year contract to supply songs for films. They had immediate success with the songs &quot;Amado Mio&quot; and &quot;Put the Blame on Mame&quot;, written for &quot;Gilda&quot; starring Rita Hayworth, and in all contributed to about twenty films for the company, including &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot; and &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot;. Fisher&#x27;s other hit compositions included &quot;That&#x27;s Good Enough for Me&quot; and &quot;Tired&quot;, recorded by Pearl Bailey; &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Young Forever&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot;. In a 1947 interview, Fisher said that &quot;Allan is the tear-jerker of the team, and I specialize in light stuff.&quot; Fisher&#x27;s &quot;lighthearted, sentimental&quot; compositions were so popular that at the time she was known as the &quot;Queen of the Juke Box.&quot;

== Personal life and death ==
She married real estate developer Charles Gershenson, from Detroit, Michigan in 1947 and left the music business soon afterwards, moving to Detroit, Michigan to raise their two children, Frederika and Ned Gershenson. She became a collector of antique American furniture, and an advisor on interior design. In the early 1960s she advised President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline on interior design for the White House. Fisher and Gershenson divorced in the 1960s, and she returned to Los Angeles, California, where she set up a retail business, Cookstores, selling kitchen and dining room items.

Fisher died at Century City Hospital in Los Angeles in January 2003, aged 87. Her friend, the pianist and singer Michael Feinstein, praised her tenacity and talent in what at the time was a man&#x27;s world.

<doc id="211563" wikidata="Q1560574" url="?curid=211563" title="Lovebug Starski">
<text>Kevin Smith (May 16, 1960 – February 8, 2018), best known by his stage name Lovebug Starski, was an American MC, musician, and record producer. He began his career as a record boy in 1971 as hip hop first appeared in the Bronx, and he eventually became a DJ at the Disco Fever club in 1978. He is one of two people who may have come up with the term &quot;hip-hop&quot;. Starski claimed that he coined the phrase, while trading the two words back and forth, while improvising lines with Keef Cowboy of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, at a farewell party for a friend who was headed into the Army. In an interview with Dave Hill in the newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot;, Starski explained, &quot;I picked up the mic and just started saying &#x27;a hip hop, hip hop, de hibbyhibbyhibbyhibby hop&#x27;. The people couldn&#x27;t believe it but it stuck.&quot;

==Career==
Starski recorded his first single, &quot;Positive Life&quot;, on the Tayster record label in 1981. (The British Group MARRS would sample this in 1987 with the No. 1 single &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot;.) Later, he recorded a song for the soundtrack of the 1986 film &quot;Rappin&quot;&#x27;, which was released on Atlantic Records, before recording his first album, &quot;House Rocker&quot;, on Epic/CBS Records. This featured his most successful chart single, &quot;Amityville (The House on the Hill)&quot;, a parody song named in reference to the film &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; (itself based on alleged supernatural activities surrounding the DeFeo murder case). It was a No. 12 hit on the UK Singles Chart in 1986. Lovebug Starski sank into cocaine dependency and was imprisoned for possession of illegal substances in 1987. On release in December 1991, he returned to a DJ residency at his former haunt, Disco Fever.

Lovebug Starski and World Famous Brucie B, also worked together at the Rooftop Roller rink in Harlem during the 1980s.

==Death==
Starski died of a heart attack in Las Vegas on February 8, 2018, at the age of 57, while moving speakers out of storage into his apartment. Smith had recently relocated to Las Vegas, where he was working to revive his DJ career with gigs including a weekly residency at the rooftop lounge of Indian restaurant Turmeric Flavors of India. His final appearance there was just hours before his death, according to his manager, Jeremy Crittenden. He is survived by his mother, Martha Bowes; two sisters, Kim Shaw and Karen Rivers; three daughters, Tiffany Williams, Shantel Williams and Bryanna Smith; three granddaughters and a grandson.

<doc id="211566" wikidata="Q906015" url="?curid=211566" title="Direct limit">
<text>In mathematics, a direct limit is a way to construct a (typically large) object from many (typically smaller) objects that are put together in a specific way. These objects may be groups, rings, vector spaces or in general objects from any category. The way they are put together is specified by a system of homomorphisms (group homomorphism, ring homomorphism, or in general morphisms in the category) between those smaller objects. The direct limit of the objects formula_1, where formula_2 ranges over some directed set formula_3, is denoted by formula_4. This notation suppresses the system of homomorphisms; however, the limit depends on the system of homomorphisms.

Direct limits are a special case of the concept of colimit in category theory. Direct limits are dual to inverse limits, which are a special case of limits in category theory.

==Formal definition==
We will first give the definition for algebraic structures like groups and modules, and then the general definition, which can be used in any category.

===Direct limits of algebraic objects===
In this section objects are understood to consist of underlying sets equipped with a given algebraic structure, such as groups, rings, modules (over a fixed ring), algebras (over a fixed field), etc. With this in mind, &quot;homomorphisms&quot; are understood in the corresponding setting (group homomorphisms, etc.).

Let formula_5 be a directed set. Let formula_6 be a family of objects indexed by formula_7 and formula_8 be a homomorphism for all formula_9 with the following properties:
# formula_10 is the identity on formula_11, and
# formula_12 for all formula_13.
Then the pair formula_14 is called a direct system over formula_3.

The direct limit of the direct system formula_14 is denoted by formula_17 and is defined as follows. Its underlying set is the disjoint union of the formula_1&#x27;s modulo a certain :

:formula_19

Here, if formula_20 and formula_21, then formula_22 if and only if there is some formula_23 with formula_24 and formula_25 such that formula_26.
Intuitively, two elements in the disjoint union are equivalent if and only if they &quot;eventually become equal&quot; in the direct system. An equivalent formulation that highlights the duality to the inverse limit is that an element is equivalent to all its images under the maps of the direct system, i.e. formula_27 whenever formula_9.

One obtains from this definition &quot;canonical functions&quot; formula_29 sending each element to its equivalence class. The algebraic operations on formula_30 are defined such that these maps become homomorphisms. Formally, the direct limit of the direct system formula_14 consists of the object formula_17 together with the canonical homomorphisms formula_29.

=== Direct limits in an arbitrary category ===
The direct limit can be defined in an arbitrary category formula_34 by means of a universal property. Let formula_35 be a direct system of objects and morphisms in formula_34 (as defined above). A &quot;target&quot; is a pair formula_37 where formula_38 is an object in formula_34 and formula_40 are morphisms for each formula_41 such that formula_42 whenever formula_9. A direct limit of the direct system formula_35 is a &quot;universally repelling target&quot; formula_37 in the sense that formula_37 is a target and for each target formula_47, there is a unique morphism formula_48 such that formula_49 for each &quot;i&quot;. The following diagram

will then commute for all &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;. 

The direct limit is often denoted
:formula_50
with the direct system formula_35 and the canonical morphisms formula_52 (or, more precisely, canonical injections formula_53) being understood.

Unlike for algebraic objects, not every direct system in an arbitrary category has a direct limit. If it does, however, the direct limit is unique in a strong sense: given another direct limit &quot;X&quot;′ there exists a &quot;unique&quot; isomorphism &quot;X&quot;′ → &quot;X&quot; that commutes with the canonical morphisms.

==Examples==
*A collection of subsets formula_54 of a set formula_55 can be partially ordered by inclusion. If the collection is directed, its direct limit is the union formula_56. The same is true for a directed collection of subgroups of a given group, or a directed collection of subrings of a given ring, etc.
*The weak topology of a CW complex is defined as a direct limit.
*Let formula_57 be any directed set with a greatest element formula_58. The direct limit of any corresponding direct system is isomorphic to formula_59 and the canonical morphism formula_60 is an isomorphism.
*Let &quot;K&quot; be a field. For a positive integer &quot;n&quot;, consider the general linear group GL(&quot;n;K&quot;) consisting of invertible &quot;n&quot; x &quot;n&quot; - matrices with entries from &quot;K&quot;. We have a group homomorphism GL(&quot;n;K&quot;) → GL(&quot;n&quot;+1;&quot;K&quot;) that enlarges matrices by putting a 1 in the lower right corner and zeros elsewhere in the last row and column. The direct limit of this system is the general linear group of &quot;K&quot;, written as GL(&quot;K&quot;). An element of GL(&quot;K&quot;) can be thought of as an infinite invertible matrix that differs from the infinite identity matrix in only finitely many entries. The group GL(&quot;K&quot;) is of vital importance in algebraic K-theory.
*Let &quot;p&quot; be a prime number. Consider the direct system composed of the factor groups formula_61 and the homomorphisms formula_62 induced by multiplication by formula_63. The direct limit of this system consists of all the roots of unity of order some power of formula_63, and is called the Prüfer group formula_65.
*There is a (non-obvious) injective ring homomorphism from the ring of symmetric polynomials in formula_66 variables to the ring of symmetric polynomials in formula_67 variables. Forming the direct limit of this direct system yields the ring of symmetric functions.
*Let &quot;F&quot; be a &quot;C&quot;-valued sheaf on a topological space &quot;X&quot;. Fix a point &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. The open neighborhoods of &quot;x&quot; form a directed set ordered by inclusion (&quot;U&quot; ≤ &quot;V&quot; if and only if &quot;U&quot; contains &quot;V&quot;). The corresponding direct system is (&quot;F&quot;(&quot;U&quot;), &quot;r&quot;&quot;U&quot;,&quot;V&quot;) where &quot;r&quot; is the restriction map. The direct limit of this system is called the &quot;stalk&quot; of &quot;F&quot; at &quot;x&quot;, denoted &quot;F&quot;&quot;x&quot;. For each neighborhood &quot;U&quot; of &quot;x&quot;, the canonical morphism &quot;F&quot;(&quot;U&quot;) → &quot;F&quot;&quot;x&quot; associates to a section &quot;s&quot; of &quot;F&quot; over &quot;U&quot; an element &quot;s&quot;&quot;x&quot; of the stalk &quot;F&quot;&quot;x&quot; called the &quot;germ&quot; of &quot;s&quot; at &quot;x&quot;.
*Direct limits in the category of topological spaces are given by placing the final topology on the underlying set-theoretic direct limit.
*An ind-scheme is an inductive limit of schemes.

== Properties ==
Direct limits are linked to inverse limits via

:formula_68

An important property is that taking direct limits in the category of modules is an exact functor. This means that if you start with a directed system of short exact sequences formula_69 and form direct limits, you obtain a short exact sequence formula_70.

== Related constructions and generalizations ==
We note that a direct system in a category formula_34 admits an alternative description in terms of functors. Any directed set formula_72 can be considered as a small category formula_73 whose objects are the elements formula_3 and there is a morphisms formula_75 if and only if formula_76. A direct system over formula_3 is then the same as a covariant functor formula_78. The colimit of this functor is the same as the direct limit of the original direct system.

A notion closely related to direct limits are the filtered colimits. Here we start with a covariant functor formula_79 from a filtered category formula_80 to some category formula_34 and form the colimit of this functor. One can show that a category has all directed limits if and only if it has all filtered colimits, and a functor defined on such a category commutes with all direct limits if and only if it commutes with all filtered colimits.

Given an arbitrary category formula_34, there may be direct systems in formula_34 that don&#x27;t have a direct limit in formula_34 (consider for example the category of finite sets, or the category of finitely generated abelian groups). In this case, we can always embed formula_34 into a category formula_86 in which all direct limits exist; the objects of formula_86 are called ind-objects of formula_34. 

The categorical dual of the direct limit is called the inverse limit. As above, inverse limits can be viewed as limits of certain functors and are closely related to limits over cofiltered categories.

== Terminology ==
In the literature, one finds the terms &quot;directed limit&quot;, &quot;direct inductive limit&quot;, &quot;directed colimit&quot;, &quot;direct colimit&quot; and &quot;inductive limit&quot; for the concept of direct limit defined above. The term &quot;inductive limit&quot; is ambiguous however, as some authors use it for the general concept of colimit.

<text>Thomas Charles Louis Holt (born 13 September 1961) is a British novelist. In addition to fiction published under his own name, he writes fantasy under the pseudonym K. J. Parker.

==Biography==
Holt was born in London, the son of novelist Hazel Holt, and was educated at Westminster School, Wadham College, Oxford, and The College of Law, London. He worked as a solicitor in Somerset for seven years before writing full-time.

His works include mythopoeic novels which parody or take as their theme various aspects of mythology, history, or literature and develop them in new and often humorous ways. He has also written a number of historical novels writing as Thomas Holt. Steve Nallon collaborated with Holt to write &quot;I, Margaret&quot;, a satirical autobiography of Margaret Thatcher published in 1989.

==K. J. Parker==
K. J. Parker is the pseudonym under which Holt has published fantasy fiction. Holt&#x27;s assumed identity as K. J. Parker was kept secret for 17 years, until April 2015.

While Parker&#x27;s stories take place in secondary worlds with fictional geographies and world history, some of the typical features of fantasy fiction such as explicit use of magic are not present in his novels. His short stories, on the other hand, frequently deal with magic and the problems it brings for sorcerers. The stories tend to have tragic themes with characters whose actions are unintentionally, ultimately self-destructive. Other major themes in the books are politics, technology (especially disruptive innovation), and either or both of the former as a means to power.

==Selected awards and nominations==

Finalist for the Crawford Award for his first fantasy novel, &quot;Expecting Someone Taller&quot;. 

Winner of World Fantasy Award—Novella in 2012 and 2013 for &quot;A Small Price to Pay for Birdsong&quot; and &quot;Let Maps to Other&quot;, and nominated in 2014. Nominated for the 2016 World Fantasy Award—Novel for &quot;Savages&quot;.

<doc id="211579" wikidata="Q671475" url="?curid=211579" title="Logan International Airport">
<text>General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport — also known as Boston Logan International Airport — is an international airport located mostly in East Boston and partially in Winthrop, Massachusetts. Covering , it has six runways and four passenger terminals, and employs an estimated 16,000 people. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems in which it is categorized as a large hub primary commercial service facility.

Opened in 1923 and named after General Edward Lawrence Logan, a 20th-century soldier and politician native to Boston, Logan International Airport is the largest airport in both Massachusetts and the New England region, in terms of passenger volume and cargo handling, as well as the busiest airport in the Northeastern United States outside the New York metropolitan area. The airport saw 43.5 million passengers in 2024, the most in its history. It has non-stop service to destinations throughout the United States and the world. BOS is the northeastern hub for Cape Air and is the secondary transatlantic hub for Delta Air Lines, serving several destinations in Europe. It is also an operating base for JetBlue. American Airlines and United Airlines also carry out significant operations from the airport, including daily transcontinental flights. All of the major U.S. air carriers offer flights from Boston to all or the majority of their primary and secondary hubs.

==History==
===Origins===
Logan Airport opened on September 8, 1923, and at that time it was mainly used by the Massachusetts Air National Guard and the United States Army Air Corps. At the time, it was referred to as &quot;Boston Air Port&quot; at Jeffries Point. The first scheduled commercial passenger flights to start at the new airfield were on Colonial Air Transport between Boston and New York City, starting in 1927. On January 1, 1936, the airport&#x27;s weather station became the official point for Boston&#x27;s weather observations and records by the National Weather Service.

===Early postwar development===
During the 1940s and 1950s, due to the rise in demand for air travel, the airport added of landfill in Boston Harbor, taken from the former Governors, Noddle&#x27;s and Apple Islands. During this time, the airport expanded the terminals, adding terminals B and C in 1949, which are still in use today. In 1943, the state of Massachusetts renamed the airport after Maj. Gen. Edward Lawrence Logan, a Spanish–American War officer from South Boston, a statue of whom by sculptor Joseph Coletti was unveiled and dedicated on May 20, 1956. In 1952, Logan Airport became the first in the United States with an indirect rapid transit connection, with the opening of the Airport station on the Blue Line.

Boston became a transatlantic gateway after World War II. In the late 1940s, American Overseas Airlines began operating a weekly Boston-Shannon-London service, shortly after, Pan Am began operating nonstop service to Shannon Airport in Ireland and Santa Maria Airport in the Azores, continuing to London and Lisbon, respectively. By the early 1950s, BOAC had started nonstop Stratocruiser service to Glasgow and Prestwick in Scotland, and Air France began operating a multi-stop Constellation service linking Boston to Orly Airport in Paris. BOAC thereafter began service on the new De Havilland Comet, the first commercial jetliner in the world, on direct flights to Boston from London Heathrow. In April 1957, the Official Airline Guide showed 49 weekday departures with the list as follows: American, 31 Eastern, 25 Northeast Airlines, 8 United Airlines, 7 TWA domestic, 6 National Airlines, 6 Mohawk Airlines, 2 Trans-Canada Air Lines and one Provincetown-Boston Airlines. In addition TWA had nine departures a week to or from the Atlantic, Pan Am had 18, Air France 8, BOAC 4 and Alitalia 4. Aer Lingus launched nonstop Constellation service to Shannon in 1958.

The airport was renamed General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport by an act of the state legislature on April 29, 1954, reflecting the growing international market.

===Introduction of the jumbo jet and early international expansion===
The jumbo jet era began at Logan in the summer of 1970, when Pan Am started daily Boeing 747 service to London Heathrow. Until 2020, the Boeing 747-400 was scheduled on flights to Boston by British Airways. Lufthansa operated Boeing 747s, including the latest-model Boeing 747-8, on its daily nonstop flights to Frankfurt.

Terminal E was the second-largest international arrivals facility in the United States when it opened in 1974. Between 1974 and 2015, the number of international travelers at Logan tripled. International long-haul travel has been one of the fastest growing market sectors at the airport. Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport) undertook the &quot;Logan Modernization Project&quot; from 1994 to 2006: a new parking garage, a new hotel, moving walkways, terminal expansions and improvements, and two-tiered roadways to separate arrival and departure traffic.

Massport&#x27;s relationship with nearby communities has been strained since the mid-1960s, when the agency took control of a parcel of residential land and popular fishing area near the northwest side of the airfield. This land included Frederick Law Olmsted&#x27;s Wood Island Park, a valued recreational area for a neighborhood with &quot;fewer park and recreation facilities than other neighborhood in the city.&quot; After decades of litigation, the forfeiture was undertaken to extend Runway 15R/33L, which later became Logan&#x27;s longest runway via artificial land. Outside of the park on Neptune Road, residents of the neighborhood, formerly, with its convenient park access, the &quot;most prestigious street in East Boston,&quot; were bought out of their homes and forced to relocate. Public opposition came to a head when residents laid down in the streets to block bulldozers and supply trucks from reaching the construction zone.

===International growth and runway additions===

Surrounding the year 2000 the Board of Massport placed an emphasis on Logan modernization under the conceptual term &quot;Logan 2000.” A plan was devised including an idea for a Monorail or people mover to connect all terminals (post-security) as a means of cutting down on all the buses which needed to visit each terminal to make pick-ups or drop-offs. The plan was abandoned at the time due to cost of the system. However it has been raised again.

Runway 14/32, Logan&#x27;s first major runway addition in more than forty years, opened on November 23, 2006. It was proposed in 1973, but was delayed in the courts. According to Massport records, the first aircraft to use the new airstrip was a Continental Express ERJ-145 regional jet landing on Runway 32, on the morning of December 2, 2006.

In April 2007, the FAA approved construction of a center field taxiway long-sought by Massport. The taxiway is between, and parallel to, Runways 4R/22L and 4L/22R. News of the project angered neighboring residents. In 2009, the taxiway opened ahead of schedule and under budget. To ensure the taxiway is not mistaken for a runway, &quot;TAXI&quot; is written in large yellow letters at each end.

A scene from the 2006 film &quot;The Departed&quot; was filmed at Logan, inside the connector bridge between Terminal E and the Central Parking Garage. Terminal C and several United Airlines and Northwest Airlines aircraft can be seen in the background. Parts of the Delta Air Lines 2007 &quot;Anthem&quot; commercial were filmed in Terminal A as well as the connector bridge between Terminal A and Central Parking.

In October 2009, US Airways announced it would close its Boston crew base in May 2010. The airline cited an &quot;operations realignment&quot; as the reason. Over 400 employees were transferred or terminated.

After starting service to Logan in 2004, JetBlue was a major operator at Logan Airport by 2008 and its largest carrier by 2011, with flights to cities throughout North America and the Caribbean. The airline grew to operate almost every gate in Terminal C and remains Logan&#x27;s largest carrier as of 2023.

The Airbus A380 first landed at Logan International Airport for compatibility checks on February 8, 2010. On March 26, 2017, British Airways began flying the A380 to Logan, operating the aircraft three times per week. British Airways announced in October 2018, that A380 service to Boston would expand to daily frequency during the summer 2019 season, beginning on March 31, 2019. Likewise, in January 2019, Emirates announced that it would be deploying the A380 on its daily flight between Logan and Dubai during the June–September 2019 summer season, as high peak seasonal services replacing the B777-300ER on that route. Lufthansa deployed the A380 to Boston in 2023, on its route to Munich.

By 2024, Logan airport had grown to serve over 9 million international passengers.

==Facilities==
Logan International Airport has four lettered passenger terminals, A, B, C, and E, and 107 gate positions in total. With the exception of flights from destinations with U.S. Customs and Border Protection preclearance, inbound international flights arrive at Terminal E for customs screening since the other terminals do not have customs screening facilities. All terminals are connected by pre-security shuttle buses and by the SL1 branch of the MBTA Silver Line BRT, and Terminals A, B, and E via pre-security moving walkways. Moving walkways also connect the terminals to a central parking garage designed for consolidated service between all four terminals and the garage itself. Post-security connection between Terminals B, C, and E is available.

===Terminal A===

Terminal A, which replaced a 1970s-era building once occupied by the now-defunct Eastern Air Lines (and later by its successor, Continental Airlines, until closing for demolition in 2002), opened to passengers on March 16, 2005. It was designed by Hellmuth, Obata + Kassabaum. The terminal is almost solely used by Delta Air Lines and is divided into a 11-gate main terminal and a 10-gate satellite terminal, which are connected via an underground pedestrian tunnel under the ramp. Terminal A features a Delta Sky Club on the third floor of the satellite building, and a second Sky Club at the site of the former Continental Airlines Presidents Club in the main terminal building.

The building is the first airport terminal in the United States to be LEED certified for environmentally friendly design by the U.S. Green Building Council. Among the building&#x27;s features are heat-reflecting roof and windows, low-flow faucets and waterless urinals, self-dimming lights and stormwater filtration.

The current Terminal A was developed under a special facility lease between the Massachusetts Port Authority and Delta. On September 14, 2005, Delta filed for bankruptcy and consequently had to reduce the number of gates it leased. In December 2018, Delta announced an expansion of routes to take effect in 2019, which resulted in the airline regaining all of Terminal A (other than one gate subleased to WestJet, itself a codeshare airline with Delta). As a result, Delta declared Logan to be one of their hubs.

===Terminal B===

Terminal B, designed by John Carl Warnecke &amp; Associates and Desmond &amp; Lord, Inc., first opened in 1974. Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, American, Boutique Air, Southwest, Spirit, and United currently operate out of the terminal which has 41 gates. American and United both operate lounges in the terminal (those being the Admirals Club and United Club, respectively) for their customers.

Pier B was completed for US Airways in 1974 and Pier A for American in 1975. The terminal remained largely unchanged until US Airways expanded its operations at Logan in 1979, and improvements designed by HNTB were constructed in 1980. From 1980 until 2000, numerous small projects including passenger seating area improvements, concessions expansions and passenger lounges were completed at both piers. American&#x27;s facilities were renovated in 1995 and redesigned by Gresham, Smith &amp; Partners, and US Airways&#x27; facilities were renovated in 1998 and 2000, and redesigned by URS Corporation with Turner Construction serving as the construction manager.

Until 2014, Terminal B was split into north and south buildings, with a parking garage between the two buildings. Between 2012 and April 2014, Terminal B underwent a $160 million renovation. It created a post-security connection between Terminal B North and Terminal B South. The renovation also included 24 new ticket counter spots, eight new departure lounges, new concession space, and a new baggage carousel.

===Terminal C===

Terminal C opened in 1967 and was designed by Perry, Shaw, Hepburn and Dean. It underwent renovations in 1987, 2002, and 2005. The terminal, which has 27 gates, serves Aer Lingus, Cape Air, JetBlue as their operating base, with TAP Air Portugal only having departures take place out of the terminal. The airport&#x27;s USO Lounge is located in the baggage claim area of Terminal C on the lower level. It offers most typical amenities as other markets as major as Greater Boston. Military ID is required for entry.

The former Terminal D gates (the three gates at the north end of Terminal C) were renumbered and labeled as part of Terminal C in February 2006. In the summer of 2016, following construction of a post-security connection between Terminals C and E, these three gates were renumbered again.

Construction on the Terminal B to C Connector was started in 2021, with the Connector opening in 2023, creating a continuous indoor post-security connection between Terminals B, C, and E. Once the Connector was completed, the former gates C40-42 were renamed B40 and C23-24. A new gate, B39, was also created from the added space in connecting Terminals B and C.

===Terminal E===

Terminal E, also known as the John A. Volpe International Terminal named after the former Governor of Massachusetts and U.S. Secretary of Transportation, serves as the international terminal for Logan and therefore houses the majority of its international arrivals (excluding flights from an origin that has U.S. border preclearance). Also, most non-U.S. carriers excluding Aer Lingus, Air Canada, TAP Air Portugal, and WestJet depart from Terminal E. The terminal has a total of 18 gates, including two gates used for hard stand boarding and two flexible-use gates which can each accommodate either 2 narrow-body aircraft or a single wide-body aircraft. All gates within the terminal are designated as common-use, meaning gates are assigned mostly based on an operational need, and no specific airline claims ownership of any of those gates. All ticket counters and gates in Terminal E are shared among the international carriers. Terminal E has several airline lounges including: Air France Lounge, British Airways Lounge, Delta&#x27;s Sky Club, Lufthansa&#x27;s First Lounge and Business Lounges, and Emirates&#x27; Emirates Lounge. The third level of Terminal E is used for departures, the second for passport control via U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the ground level for arrivals and customs, also via U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The Federal Inspection Station located in Terminal E is capable of processing over 2,000 passengers per hour.

The terminal was completed in 1974, and designed by Kubitz &amp; Papi, Inc. and Desmond &amp; Lord, Inc. Massport completed the &quot;Terminal E Modernization&quot; project in August 1997 which improved the passenger facilities. The International Gateway Project, designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill and DMJM Aviation, added to the terminal in 2003, and the entire project was completed in 2008. Started in 2014 and completed in late January 2017, Terminal E underwent a $100 million renovation which included a post-security connector between Terminals E and C (opened summer 2016), improved immigration and passport control kiosks, and gates capable of serving the Airbus A380.

In summer 2019, Massport began another expansion project on Terminal E, due to continued growth at the airport. The project, which was completed in August 2023, included the addition of 2 new international gates (E13 and E16) as well as two flexible-use international gates which can each accommodate either two narrow-body aircraft or a single wide-body aircraft (E14 and E15). The project includes all-new shops, restaurants and other passenger services which stretch into the North Cargo area. Additionally, a new TSA checkpoint was built and the ticketing, customs, and baggage claim areas were expanded. In total, the project cost $680 million and incorporated roughly of new space. The project, inclusive of a prismatic painted roof, was designed by AECOM and luis vidal + architects, with Boston-based Suffolk Construction Company serving as construction manager.

===Runways===

Located partly in East Boston and partly in the Town of Winthrop, on Boston Harbor, Logan International Airport covers an area of which contains six runways:

* Runway 4L/22R: 
* Runway 4R/22L: 
* Runway 9/27: 
* Runway 14/32: 
* Runway 15L/33R: 
* Runway 15R/33L: 

The runways are operated in four patterns depending on the wind direction:

* Northeast winds: Arrivals on 4L and 4R; departures from 9, 4L, and 4R
* Northwest winds: Arrivals on 33L, 32, and 27; departures from 33L and 27
* Southeast winds: Arrivals on 15L and 15R; departures from 15R, 14, and 9
* Southwest winds: Arrivals on 22L, 22R, and 27; departures from 22L and 22R

Additionally, the harbor to the south of the airport contains water Runway 14W/32W (); this runway, however, is not operated by Logan International Airport but is instead co-operated by two private seaplane bases (SPBs), Tailwind Boston SPB and Cape Air Boston Harbor SPB . Between 1968 and 1971, Taxiway Sierra was converted into STOL runway 18/36, which was for use by Eastern Air Lines&#x27;s STOL capable Breguet 941 turboprop shuttle.

Instrument landing system approaches are available for runways 4R, 15R, 22L, 27, and 33L, with runways 4R and 33L certified for CAT III operations. The other runways with ILS are certified for CAT I Instrument Landing operations. EMAS pads are located at the starting thresholds of runways 22R and 33L.

==== Runway 14/32 ====
Runway 14/32, which opened to air traffic on November 23, 2006, is unidirectional. Runway 32 is used for landings and 14 is used for takeoffs. Massport is barred by a court order from using the runway for overland landings or takeoffs, except in emergencies.

There was fierce opposition towards the construction of 14/32 among communities adjacent to the northwest side of the airport, such as Chelsea and East Boston, as authorities acknowledged these areas would likely see increased noise levels. Many Residents of Winthrop and Revere also joined in opposition, even though Massport had predicted the new traffic patterns allowed by 14/32 would actually reduce overflights and noise in those areas.

Since the opening of the new runway, there has been disagreement about when and how often it should operate. Residents have demanded a minimum of northwest winds, slightly higher than the threshold favored by Massport.

The rationale behind constructing the new runway 14/32 was that it reduces the need for improving existing Runway 15L/33R, which, at only is perhaps the shortest hard-surface runways at major airports in the United States. In 1988, Massport had proposed an extension to 15L/33R (a project which would have required additional filling-in some land along a &quot;clam bed&quot;), but was thwarted by a court injunction.

Boston&#x27;s Hyatt Harborside Hotel, which sits only a few hundred yards from the runway threshold, was built primarily to prevent Massport from ever extending the length of 14/32 or using it for takeoffs or landings over the city. Massachusetts state legislators carefully chose the location of the hotel—directly in the runway centerline—prior to its construction in 1992.

===Ground transportation===
Geographically, Logan Airport is located northeast of Back Bay, a short distance with respect to other airports similarly sized and metropolitan areas served. Located on Route 1A, the airport is accessed from I-93 through the Sumner and Callahan Tunnels, and I-90/Massachusetts Turnpike through the Ted Williams Tunnel.

Massport operates an intercity bus common carrier called Logan Express. It provides shuttle service to remote park and rides located at Back Bay, Braintree, Framingham, Danvers, and Woburn. Massport also operates the Airport Shuttle which provides free service between all terminals, the Airport station on the Blue Line, and the Rental Car Center, as well as additional service to the water transportation dock located on Harborside Drive.

Ride Shares serve the airport via the central parking garage. A handful of livery-plate operators also service the airport offering various chauffeured car, van, or limousine for-hire offerings.

The SL1 branch of the MBTA&#x27;s Silver Line bus rapid transit service connects all Logan terminals with South Station, a major transportation hub in downtown Boston that is served by MBTA Commuter Rail, Amtrak, the Red Line subway, and intercity bus. The SL3 branch of the Silver Line connects Chelsea with the Airport Station. The Airport station on the MBTA&#x27;s Blue Line subway, despite its name, is not in the airport terminal itself; free shuttle buses carry passengers between the Airport station and the terminal buildings. The Blue Line connects with the Orange Line at State, which provides service to both North Station and Back Bay, the two other major rail transportation hubs for Boston. A transfer to the Green Line, which also runs to North Station, is available at Government Center station. 

==== Rental car center ====
A $310 million rental car center opened on September 24, 2013, consolidating all rental car companies into one shared building. Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz, National, Payless, Sixt, Thrifty, and Zipcar rental car companies currently operate out of facility, which has 3,200 parking spaces across four levels.

===Other facilities===

The distinctive central control tower, nearly a dozen stories high, is a local landmark with its pair of segmented elliptical pylons and a six-story platform trussed between them.

Logan Airport has two cargo facilities: North Cargo is adjacent to Terminal E and South Cargo adjacent to Terminals A and B. North Cargo is also the location of several maintenance hangars, including those operated by American Airlines, Delta through Delta TechOps, and JetBlue.

Signature Aviation operates a FBO in the North Cargo area near runway 15R/33L. Also located on airport property is the Amelia Earhart General Aviation Terminal, which is located near runway 14/32 and next to the Massport Fire Rescue headquarters. The terminal was built in 1980, and dedicated to former Boston resident Earhart in 1984. Until 2006, American Eagle flights flew out of the terminal when all flights were consolidated in the former B22-29 gates in Pier A, the north building of Terminal B. Passengers had to take a shuttle bus from Terminal B to the Earhart Terminal. The terminal currently sits mostly unused.
Terminal C is home to the airport&#x27;s chapel, Our Lady of the Airways. Opened in 1951, it is considered the first airport chapel in the United States. The chapel was originally Catholic, but is now non-denominational.

===Public safety===
Police services are provided by the Massachusetts State Police Troop F. Fire protection is the responsibility of the Massport Fire Rescue. Even though the airport is technically within city limits, under Massachusetts state law municipal police such as the Boston Police Department do not have jurisdiction on Massport property.

A 250-foot security zone, established in 2002, surrounds the waters around the airport which are marked by 29 buoys indicating the restricted area. The area is patrolled by the Massachusetts State Police, the Boston Police Department, the Massachusetts Environmental Police, the United States Coast Guard and the Boston and Winthrop Harbormasters. Anyone who enters the zone for non-emergency purposes is subject to prosecution and is entered into a State Police database that tracks offenders.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===


===Seaplane===
Tailwind Air began operating seasonal seaplane service from Boston Harbor&#x27;s Fan Pier Marina to Manhattan on August 3, 2021, Plymouth in 2022, Provincetown on May 25, 2022, and Nantucket on May 17, 2023. Cape Air is approved but has not yet begun scheduled service.

===Cargo===

Logan Airport is a medium-sized airport in terms of cargo, handling 684,875 tons of freight in 2012, making it the 10th busiest airport in the U.S. in terms of cargo. It handles many U.S.-based cargo airlines, including DHL Aviation, FedEx Express and UPS Airlines. It also has cargo offices for many international cargo carriers, including British Airways World Cargo, Cathay Pacific Cargo, China Airlines Cargo, EVA Air Cargo, LATAM Cargo Chile, Lufthansa Cargo, Martinair Cargo, and Saudia Cargo. It has two cargo complexes: the North Cargo Terminal, located near Terminal E, and South Cargo, located near Terminal A. Given that the airport is the 10th busiest cargo facility in the country, with many companies operating at the airport, it has been recognized that future expansion of cargo from Logan is limited due to constrained physical space for expansion.

==Accidents and incidents==

===Accidents===
* On June 5, 1930, A Colonial Air Transport Ford Trimotor bound for New York went nose down after takeoff and crashed into the sea. The aircraft came to rest in of water. One passenger died out of the 13 passengers and two crew.
* On October 4, 1960, Eastern Air Lines Flight 375, a Lockheed L-188 Electra crashed into the sea while attempting to take off from Logan Airport. Sixty-two people died and ten people survived, incurring serious injuries.
* On November 15, 1961, A Vickers Viscount N6592C of Northeast Airlines collided with a Douglas DC-6 N8228H of National Airlines after landing at Logan International Airport. The DC-6 had started to take off without receiving clearance to do so.
* On March 10, 1964, a Slick Airways DC-4 crashed southwest of Logan while on final approach. All three occupants were killed. Loss of control due to accumulation of ice on the horizontal stabilizer, causing the aircraft to pitch down, was the probable cause.
* On July 31, 1973, Delta Air Lines Flight 723 crashed while on an ILS instrument approach in heavy fog. The DC-9 struck a seawall, killing all 89 occupants. Two people initially survived, but later succumbed to their injuries. It is considered the deadliest crash to occur at Logan Airport.
* On November 3, 1973, Pan Am Flight 160, a Boeing 707-321C cargo aircraft, crashed on approach to Boston-Logan. Smoke in the cockpit caused the pilots to lose control. All three crewmembers died in the accident.
*On December 17, 1973, Iberia Airlines Flight 933 from Madrid Barajas International Airport collided with the ALS system short of the runway threshold, critically damaging the front landing gear and causing it to collapse. The aircraft came to a rest short of the runway. All 168 onboard survived; however, the aircraft was written off and was the first hull loss of a DC-10.
* On January 23, 1982, World Airways Flight 30 from Newark to Boston made a non-precision instrument approach to runway 15R and touched down past the displaced threshold on an icy runway. When the crew sensed that the DC-10-30-CF could not be stopped on the remaining runway, they steered the DC-10 off the side of the runway to avoid the approach light pier, and slid into the shallow water of Boston Harbor. The nose section separated as the DC-10 came to rest past the runway end, left of the extended centerline. Two passengers were never found and are presumed to have been swept out to sea.

===Incidents===

* On October 2, 1954, a Massachusetts Air National Guard F94 Starfire experienced engine failure and crashed near Logan Airport. Its pilot, First Lieutenant James O. Conway, sacrificed his life by veering the plane into an embankment on Bayswater Street in East Boston. A memorial was placed nearby.
* On March 17, 1970, Eastern Air Lines Shuttle Flight 1320 was en route to Boston Airport when a suicidal man armed with a revolver stormed the cockpit and shot both pilots. The co-pilot managed to wrestle the gun from the hijacker and shoot him before he died. The wounded pilot managed to land the plane and the hijacker was arrested.
* On July 2, 1976, an unoccupied Eastern Airlines L-188 Electra parked at Boston Logan Airport was destroyed by a bomb planted in the landing gear compartment. No one was injured.
* On September 17, 1979, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 with the registration C-FTLU operating as Air Canada Flight 680 left Boston for Yarmouth, NS. 14 minutes after taking off from Logan, the entire tailcone section of the aircraft separated resulting in rapid decompression at an altitude of 25,000 feet (7,600 m) and leaving a large hole in the rear fuselage. A beverage cart and other items in the cabin were sucked out of the aircraft over the Atlantic Ocean, but there were no fatalities or significant injuries. The aircraft safely returned to Boston without further incident. Fatigue cracks were determined to be the cause. Four years later, this same aircraft would be destroyed by a fire on June 2, 1983, as Air Canada Flight 797.
* In the September 11 attacks, two Los Angeles-bound flights, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, originated and departed from Logan Airport. Both flights were hijacked by al-Qaeda terrorists and flown into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, ultimately leading to their destruction. American flags now fly over gates B32 and C19, the respective gates that the two planes pushed back from on this day. Under political pressure, acting Governor Jane Swift forced the CEO of Massport to resign, but it was later determined that the failure had been with the airline security checkpoint policy of allowing small knives, and not anything to do with Logan management.
* On June 9, 2005, US Airways Flight 1170 and Aer Lingus Flight 132 narrowly avoided colliding after they were cleared for takeoff nearly simultaneously on intersecting runways by two different air traffic controllers. The crew of the US Airways flight spotted the oncoming Aer Lingus jet and avoided a collision by keeping their own aircraft on the runway past their normal rotation point, allowing the Aer Lingus flight to pass over them. Both flights lifted off safely and continued to their destinations without further incident.
* On January 7, 2013, ground crew workers noticed smoke coming out from the battery compartment in a parked Japan Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner at the gate. This fire was caused by overcharged lithium-ion batteries, eventually leading to the grounding of the worldwide Boeing 787 fleet and subsequent redesign of the battery systems.
* On March 5, 2023, on United Airlines Flight 2609 from Los Angeles to Boston, a passenger attempted to open the emergency doors in flight and stabbed a flight attendant who tried to stop him. Upon the flight&#x27;s landing, the passenger was charged with interference with flight crew members and using a dangerous weapon.
* On September 17, 2024, a Cessna 402, registration &quot;N18VV&quot; operated by Cape Air destined for Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport returned to Logan Airport after takeoff due to issues reported with the landing gear. Although only one landing wheel was successfully deployed, the aircraft landed safely and no injuries were reported among the two passengers and one crew member on board.

==Alternative airports==
The two historically known alternative airports to Logan are both located outside Massachusetts. Manchester–Boston Regional Airport in Manchester, New Hampshire, is located approximately north-northwest of Logan, an average drive time of 62 minutes via I-90 and I-93. T. F. Green Airport in Warwick, Rhode Island, is located south-southwest of Logan, averaging 76 minutes from Logan via I-90, I-93, and I-95, or a 100-minute ride via the Silver Line SL1 bus to South Station and then the Providence/Stoughton Line commuter rail to T. F. Green Airport station. Massport does not operate these facilities.

Massport does operate Worcester Regional Airport in Worcester, Massachusetts, which also serves as an alternative to Logan, although not widely known as such. In late 2017, the airport finished construction on a Category IIIb Landing System that would allow for arrivals and departures in virtually all weather conditions. The increased reliability, which has been the main concern for airlines operating at the notoriously foggy airport over the years, was expected to draw additional service. The airport is located due west of Logan, primarily accessed via Interstates I-90 and I-290.

<text>Bernkastel-Wittlich (German: &quot;Landkreis Bernkastel-Wittlich&quot;) is a district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Vulkaneifel, Cochem-Zell, Rhein-Hunsrück, Birkenfeld, Trier-Saarburg and Bitburg-Prüm.

== History ==
The district was established in 1969 by merging the former districts of Bernkastel and Wittlich.

== Geography ==
The district is situated on both banks of the Moselle, which crosses the territory from southwest to northeast. The country rises to the Eifel in the north and the Hunsrück in the south. A great number of tributaries rise in the Eifel and flow into the Moselle. In the very south of the district is the Erbeskopf (818 m), the highest peak in the Hunsrück and Rhineland-Palatinate.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms displays:
* The cross symbolising the bishopric of Trier
* The crayfish from the arms of Bernkastel-Kues
* The keys from the arms of Wittlich
* The red and white pattern of the County of Sponheim, which ruled this part of the Moselle valley in medieval times

== Towns and municipalities ==

==Twin region==
At one time, the Borough of Milton Keynes was the twinned region of the district of Bernkastel-Wittlich.

<text>Dubai is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates and the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, the most populous of the country&#x27;s seven emirates. As of 2024, the city has a population of around 3.79 million, more than 90% of which are expatriates.

In the early 20th century, Dubai developed into a significant regional and international trade hub, emphasizing tourism and luxury. Dubai has been a center for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, and its economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services. Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city. However, oil production contributed less than 1 percent to the emirate&#x27;s GDP in 2018. Due to financial secrecy, low taxes, and valuable real estate, Dubai is an appealing destination for money launderers, criminals, corrupt political figures and sanctioned businesspeople to launder or hide money.

Dubai has the second-most five-star hotels in the world after London and the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, which is tall. Located in the eastern Arabian Peninsula, on the coast of the Persian Gulf, it is a major global transportation hub for passengers and cargo. In 2024, Dubai was the seventh-most-visited city in the world.

== Etymology==
Many theories have been proposed about the origin of the word &quot;Dubai&quot;. One theory suggests the word used to be the &quot;souq&quot; in Ba. An Arabic proverb says &quot;Daba Dubai&quot; (), meaning &quot;They came with a lot of money.&quot;

According to Fedel Handhal, a scholar on the UAE&#x27;s history and culture, the word Dubai may have come from the word &quot;dabba&quot; () (a past tense derivative of &quot;yadibbu&quot; (), which means &quot;to creep&quot;), referring to the slow flow of Dubai Creek inland.

The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word, but to its alternative meaning of &quot;baby locust&quot; () due to the abundance of locusts in the area before settlement.

==History==


The history of human settlement in the area now defined by the United Arab Emirates is complex and extensive. It points to extensive trading links between the civilisations of the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia, and even as far afield as the Levant. Archaeological finds in the emirate of Dubai, particularly at Al-Ashoosh, Al Sufouh, and the notably rich trove from Saruq Al Hadid show settlement through the Ubaid and Hafit periods, the Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods, and the three Iron Ages in the UAE. The area was known to the Sumerians as &quot;Magan&quot; and was a source of metallic goods, notably copper and bronze 

The area was covered with sand about 5,000 years ago as the coast retreated inland, becoming part of the city&#x27;s present coastline. Pre-Islamic ceramics have been found from the 3rd and 4th centuries. Prior to the introduction of Islam to the area, the people in this region worshiped &quot;Bajir&quot; (or &quot;Bajar&quot;). After the spread of Islam in the region, the Umayyad Caliph of the eastern Islamic world conquered south-east Arabia and drove out the Sassanians. Excavations by the Dubai Museum in the region of &quot;Al-Jumayra&quot; (Jumeirah) found several artefacts from the Umayyad period.

An early mention of Dubai in 1095 is in the &quot;Book of Geography&quot; by the Andalusian-Arab geographer Abu Abdullah al-Bakri. The Venetian pearl merchant Gasparo Balbi visited the area in 1580 and mentioned Dubai (as &quot;Dibei&quot;) for its pearling industry.

===Establishment of modern Dubai===

Dubai is thought to have been established as a fishing village in the early 18th century and was, by 1822, a town of some 700–800 members of the Bani Yas tribe and subject to the rule of Sheikh Tahnun bin Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi. In 1822, a British naval surveyor noted that Dubai was at that time populated with a thousand people living in an oval-shaped town surrounded by a mud wall, scattered with goats and camels. The main footpath out of the village led to a reedy creek while another trailed off into the desert and merged into caravan routes.

In 1833, following tribal feuding, members of the Al Bu Falasah tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi and established themselves in Dubai. The exodus from Abu Dhabi was led by Obeid bin Saeed and Maktoum bin Butti, who became joint leaders of Dubai until Ubaid died in 1836, leaving Maktoum to establish the Maktoum dynasty.

Dubai signed the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 with the British government along with other Trucial States, following the British campaign in 1819 against Ras Al Khaimah. This led to the 1853 Perpetual Maritime Truce. Dubai also – like its neighbours on the Trucial Coast – entered into an exclusivity agreement in which the United Kingdom took responsibility for the emirate&#x27;s security in 1892.

In 1841, a smallpox epidemic broke out in the Bur Dubai locality, forcing residents to relocate east to Deira. In 1896, fire broke out in Dubai, a disastrous occurrence in a town where many family homes were still constructed from &quot;barasti&quot; – palm fronds. The conflagration consumed half of Bur Dubai&#x27;s houses, while the Deira district was said to have been totally destroyed. The following year, more fires broke out. A female slave was caught in the act of starting one such blaze and was subsequently put to death.
In 1901, Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum established Dubai as a free port with no taxation on imports or exports and also gave merchants parcels of land and guarantees of protection and tolerance. These policies saw a movement of merchants not only directly from Lingeh, but also those who had settled in Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah (which had historical links with Lingeh through the Al Qawasim tribe) to Dubai. An indicator of the growing importance of the port of Dubai can be gained from the movements of the steamer of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, which from 1899 to 1901 paid five visits annually to Dubai. In 1902 the company&#x27;s vessels made 21 visits to Dubai and from 1904 on, the steamers called fortnightly – in 1906, trading 70,000 tones of cargo. The frequency of these vessels only helped to accelerate Dubai&#x27;s role as an emerging port and trading hub of preference. Lorimer notes the transfer from Lingeh &quot;bids fair to become complete and permanent&quot;, and also that the town had by 1906 supplanted Lingeh as the chief entrepôt of the Trucial States.

The &quot;great storm&quot; of 1908 struck the pearling boats of Dubai and the coastal emirates towards the end of the pearling season that year, resulting in the loss of a dozen boats and over 100 men. The disaster was a major setback for Dubai, with many families losing their breadwinners and merchants facing financial ruin. These losses came at a time when the tribes of the interior were also experiencing poverty. In a letter to the Sultan of Muscat in 1911, Butti laments, &quot;Misery and poverty are raging among them, with the result that they are struggling, looting and killing among themselves.&quot;

In 1910, in the Hyacinth incident, the town was bombarded by HMS &quot;Hyacinth&quot;, with 37 people killed.

===Pre-oil Dubai===
As well as undergoing growth and expansion in its regional trade links, Dubai was also an important regional centre for the collection, sale, and trade of pearls. The collapse of the pearling industry saw the city fall into a deep depression and many residents lived in poverty or migrated to other parts of the Persian Gulf.

In 1937 an oil exploration contract was signed which guaranteed royalty rights for Dubai and concessionary payments to Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum. However, due to World War II, oil would not be struck until 1966.

In the early days since its inception, Dubai was constantly at odds with Abu Dhabi. In 1947, a border dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi on the northern sector of their mutual border escalated into war. Arbitration by the British government resulted in a cessation of hostilities.

Despite a lack of oil, Dubai&#x27;s ruler from 1958, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, used revenue from trading activities to build infrastructure. Private companies were established to build and operate infrastructure, including electricity, telephone services, and both the ports and airport operators. An airport of sorts (a runway built on salt flats) was established in Dubai in the 1950s and, in 1959, the emirate&#x27;s first hotel, the Airlines Hotel, was constructed. This was followed by the Ambassador and Carlton Hotels in 1968.

Sheikh Rashid commissioned John Harris from British architectural construction firm Halcrow, to create the city&#x27;s first master plan in 1959. Harris imagined a Dubai that would rise from the historic centre on Dubai Creek, with an extensive road system, organised zones, and a town centre, all of which could feasibly be built with the limited financial resources at the time.

1959 saw the establishment of Dubai&#x27;s first telephone company, 51% owned by IAL (International Aeradio Ltd) and 49% by Sheikh Rashid and local businessmen and in 1961 both the electricity company and telephone company had rolled out operational networks. The water company (Sheikh Rashid was chairman and majority shareholder) constructed a pipeline from wells at Awir and a series of storage tanks and, by 1968, Dubai had a reliable supply of piped water.

On 7 April 1961, the Dubai-based MV &quot;Dara&quot;, a five thousand ton British flagged vessel that plied the route between Basra (Iraq), Kuwait, and Bombay (Mumbai, India), was caught in unusually high winds off Dubai. Early the next morning in heavy seas off Umm al-Quwain, an explosion tore out the second-class cabins and started fires. The captain gave the order to abandon ship but two lifeboats capsized and a second explosion occurred. A flotilla of small boats from Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, and Umm al-Quwain picked up survivors, but 238 of the 819 persons on board were lost in the disaster.

The construction of Dubai&#x27;s first airport was started on the northern edge of the town in 1959 and the terminal building opened for business in September 1960. The airport was initially serviced by Gulf Aviation (flying Dakotas, Herons, and Viscounts) but Iran Air commenced services to Shiraz in 1961.

In 1962 the British Political Agent noted that &quot;Many new houses and blocks of offices and flats are being built... the Ruler is determined, against advice [from the British authorities] to press on with the construction of a jet airport... More and more European and Arab firms are opening up and the future looks bright.&quot;

In 1962, with expenditure on infrastructure projects already approaching levels some thought imprudent, Sheikh Rashid approached his brother-in-law, the Ruler of Qatar, for a loan to build the first bridge crossing Dubai Creek. This crossing was finished in May 1963 and was paid for by a toll levied on the crossing from the Dubai side of the creek to the Deira side.

BOAC was originally reluctant to start regular flights between Bombay and Dubai, fearing a lack of demand for seats. However, by the time the asphalt runway of Dubai Airport was constructed in 1965, opening Dubai to both regional and long-haul traffic, several foreign airlines were competing for landing rights. In 1970, a new airport terminal building was constructed which included Dubai&#x27;s first duty-free shops.

Throughout the 1960s Dubai was the centre of a lively gold trade, with 1968 imports of gold at some £56 million. This gold was, in the vast majority, re-exported – mainly to customers who took delivery in international waters off India. The import of gold to India had been banned and so the trade was characterized as smuggling, although Dubai&#x27;s merchants were quick to point out that they were making legal deliveries of gold and that it was up to the customer where they took it.

In 1966, more gold was shipped from London to Dubai than almost anywhere else in the world (only France and Switzerland took more), at 4 million ounces. Dubai also took delivery of over $15 million worth of watches and over 5 million ounces of silver. The 1967 price of gold was $35 an ounce but its market price in India was $68 an ounce – a healthy markup. Estimates at the time put the volume of gold imports from Dubai to India at around 75% of the total market.

===Oil era===

After years of exploration following large finds in neighbouring Abu Dhabi, oil was eventually discovered in territorial waters off Dubai in 1966, albeit in far smaller quantities. The first field was named &quot;Fateh&quot; or &quot;good fortune&quot;. This led to an acceleration of Sheikh Rashid&#x27;s infrastructure development plans and a construction boom that brought a massive influx of foreign workers, mainly Asians and Middle Easterners. Between 1968 and 1975, the city&#x27;s population grew by over 300%.

As part of the infrastructure for pumping and transporting oil from the Fateh field, located offshore of the Jebel Ali area of Dubai, two 500,000-gallon storage tanks were built, known locally as &quot;Kazzans&quot;, by welding them together on the beach and then digging them out and floating them to drop onto the seabed at the Fateh field. These were constructed by the Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company, which gave the beach its local name (Chicago Beach), which was transferred to the Chicago Beach Hotel, which was demolished and replaced by the Jumeirah Beach Hotel in the late 1990s. The Kazzans were an innovative oil storage solution which meant supertankers could moor offshore even in bad weather and avoided the need to pipe oil onshore from Fateh, which is some 60 miles out to sea.

Dubai had already embarked on a period of infrastructural development and expansion. Oil revenue flowing from 1969 onwards supported a period of growth with Sheikh Rashid embarking on a policy of building infrastructure and a diversified trading economy before the emirate&#x27;s limited reserves were depleted. Oil accounted for 24% of GDP in 1990 but had fallen to 7% of GDP by 2004.

Critically, one of the first major projects Sheikh Rashid embarked upon when oil revenue started to flow was the construction of Port Rashid, a deep-water free port constructed by British company Halcrow. Originally intended to be a four-berth port, it was extended to sixteen berths as construction was ongoing. The project was an outstanding success, with shipping queuing to access the new facilities. The port was inaugurated on 5 October 1972, although its berths were each pressed into use as soon as they had been built. Port Rashid was to be further expanded in 1975 to add a further 35 berths before the larger port of Jebel Ali was constructed.

Port Rashid was the first of a swath of projects designed to create a modern trading infrastructure, including roads, bridges, schools, and hospitals.

===Reaching the UAE&#x27;s Act of Union===

Dubai and the other &quot;Trucial States&quot; had long been a British protectorate where the British government took care of foreign policy and defence, as well as arbitrating between the rulers of the Eastern Gulf, the result of a treaty signed in 1892 named the &quot;Exclusive Agreement&quot;. This was to change with Prime Minister Harold Wilson&#x27;s announcement, on 16 January 1968, that all British troops were to be withdrawn from &quot;East of Aden&quot;. The decision was to pitch the coastal emirates, together with Qatar and Bahrain, into fevered negotiations to fill the political vacuum that the British withdrawal would leave behind.

The principle of union was first agreed upon between the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, and Sheikh Rashid of Dubai on 18 February 1968 meeting in an encampment at Argoub Al Sedirah, near Al Semeih, a desert stop between the two emirates. The two agreed to work towards bringing the other emirates, including Qatar and Bahrain, into the union. Over the next two years, negotiations and meetings of the rulers followed—often stormy—as a form of union was thrashed out. The nine-state union was never to recover from the October 1969 meeting where British intervention against aggressive activities by two of the Emirates resulted in a walk-out by Bahrain and Qatar. They dropped out of talks, leaving six of the seven &quot;trucial&quot; emirates to agree on a union on 18 July 1971.

On 2 December 1971, Dubai, together with Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al-Quwain, and Fujairah joined in the Act of Union to form the United Arab Emirates. The seventh emirate, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the UAE on 10 February 1972, following Iran&#x27;s annexation of the RAK-claimed Tunbs islands.

In 1973, Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a uniform currency: the UAE dirham. In that same year, the prior monetary union with Qatar was dissolved and the UAE dirham was introduced throughout the Emirates.

===Modern Dubai===

Throughout the 1970s, Dubai experienced continued growth fueled by revenues generated from oil and trade, even as the city witnessed an influx of immigrants fleeing the Lebanese civil war. Border disputes between the emirates persisted even after the formation of the UAE; it was only in 1979 that a formal compromise was reached, putting an end to disagreements. In 1979, the establishment of the Jebel Ali port, a deep-water port accommodating larger ships, marked a significant development. Initially facing challenges, Sheikh Mohammed initiated the JAFZA (Jebel Ali Free Zone) around the port in 1985, facilitating the unrestricted import of labour and export of capital for foreign companies. Simultaneously, Dubai airport and the aviation industry continued their expansion.

The Gulf War in early 1991 had a negative financial impact on the city, with depositors and traders withdrawing money and trade. However, Dubai rebounded in a changing political climate and prospered. In the late 1990s, various foreign trading communities—initially from Kuwait, during the Gulf War, and later from Bahrain, amidst the Shia unrest—relocated their businesses to Dubai. Dubai served as a refuelling base for allied forces at the Jebel Ali Free Zone during the Gulf War and again during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Subsequent significant increases in oil prices prompted Dubai to maintain its focus on free trade and tourism.

In the early 2000s, the construction of artificial islands on the coast of Dubai, known as the Palm Islands and The World Islands, began. The Burj Khalifa was opened in Dubai in 2010, surpassing the Taipei 101 and officially becoming the tallest skyscraper in the world.

Dubai&#x27;s smart city initiatives, which include smart tourism, play a key role in advancing the city&#x27;s growth ambitions, primarily through its Smart Dubai project. In 2016, the world&#x27;s first functioning 3D-printed office building was opened in Dubai, having taken 17 days to build. Its architect, Killa Design, was the same architect that designed the Museum of the Future.

==Geography==


Dubai is situated on the Persian Gulf coast of the United Arab Emirates and is roughly at sea level ( above). The emirate of Dubai shares borders with Abu Dhabi in the south, Sharjah in the northeast, and the Sultanate of Oman in the southeast. Hatta, a minor exclave of the emirate, is surrounded on three sides by Oman and by the emirates of Ajman (in the west) and Ras Al Khaimah (in the north). The Persian Gulf borders the western coast of the emirate. Dubai is positioned at and covers an area of , which represents a significant expansion beyond its initial designation due to land reclamation from the sea.

Dubai lies directly within the Arabian Desert. However, the topography of Dubai is significantly different from that of the southern portion of the UAE in that much of Dubai&#x27;s landscape is highlighted by sandy desert patterns, while gravel deserts dominate much of the southern region of the country. The sand consists mostly of crushed shells and coral and is fine, clean, and white. East of the city, the salt-crusted coastal plains, known as &quot;sabkha&quot;, give way to a north–south running line of dunes. Farther east, the dunes grow larger and are tinged red with iron oxide.

The flat sandy desert gives way to the Western Hajar Mountains, which run alongside Dubai&#x27;s border with Oman at Hatta. The Western Hajar chain has an arid, jagged, and shattered landscape, whose mountains rise to about in some places. Dubai has no natural river bodies or oases; however, Dubai does have a natural inlet, Dubai Creek, which has been dredged to make it deep enough for large vessels to pass through. Dubai also has multiple gorges and waterholes, which dot the base of the Western Al Hajar mountains. A vast sea of dunes covers much of southern Dubai and eventually leads into the desert known as The Empty Quarter. Seismically, Dubai is in a very stable zone—the nearest seismic fault line, the Zagros Fault, is from the UAE and is unlikely to have any seismic impact on Dubai. Experts also predict that the possibility of a tsunami in the region is minimal because the Persian Gulf waters are not deep enough to trigger a tsunami.

The sandy desert surrounding the city supports wild grasses and occasional date palms. Desert hyacinths grow in the &quot;sabkha&quot; plains east of the city, while acacia and ghaf trees grow in the flat plains within the proximity of the Western Al Hajar mountains. Several Indigenous trees such as the date palm and neem as well as imported trees such as the eucalyptus grow in Dubai&#x27;s natural parks. The MacQueen&#x27;s bustard, striped hyena, caracal, desert fox, falcon, and Arabian oryx are common in Dubai&#x27;s desert. Dubai is on the migration path between Europe, Asia, and Africa, and more than 320 migratory bird species pass through the emirate in spring and autumn. The waters of Dubai are home to more than 300 species of fish, including the hammour. The typical marine life off the Dubai coast includes tropical fish, jellyfish, coral, dugong, dolphins, whales, and sharks. Various types of turtles can also be found in the area including the hawksbill turtle and green turtle, which are listed as endangered species.

===Climate===

Dubai features a tropical, hot desert climate (Köppen BWh). Summers in Dubai are extremely hot, prolonged, windy, and humid, with an average high around and overnight lows around in the hottest month, August. Most days are sunny throughout the year. Winters are mild to warm, with an average high of and overnight lows of in January, the coolest month.

Dubai summers are also known for the very high humidity level, which can make it very uncomfortable for many with exceptionally high dew points, which can exceed in summer. Heat index values can reach over at the height of summer. The highest recorded temperature in Dubai is .

Very dry, Dubai&#x27;s average annual precipitation is . However, precipitation has been increasing in the last few decades, with accumulated rain reaching per year. Record-setting flooding inundated Dubai in April 2024, demonstrating a lack of appropriate drainage to deal with the immense challenges precipitated by climate change.


==Government==
Dubai has been ruled by the Al Maktoum family since 1833; the emirate is an absolute monarchy. Dubai citizens participate in the electoral college to vote representatives to the Federal National Council of the &#x27;UAE&#x27;. The ruler, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is also the vice-president and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and a member of the Supreme Council of the Union (SCU). Dubai appoints 8 members in two-term periods to the Federal National Council (FNC) of the UAE, the supreme federal legislative body.

The Dubai Municipality (DM) was established by the then ruler of Dubai, Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, in 1954 for purposes of city planning, citizen services, and upkeep of local facilities. It has since then evolved into an autonomous subnational authority, collectively known as the Government of Dubai which is responsible for both the city of Dubai and the greater emirate. The Government of Dubai has over 58 governmental departments responsible for security, economic policy, education, transportation, immigration, and is one of only three emirates to have a separate judicial system independent from the federal judiciary of the UAE. The Ruler of Dubai is the head of government and emir (head of state) and laws, decrees, and court judgments are issued in his name, however, since 2003, executive authority of managing and overseeing Dubai Governmental agencies has been delegated to the Dubai Executive Council, led by the Crown Prince of Dubai Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum. Although no legislative assembly exists, the traditional open majlis (council) where citizens and representatives of the Ruler meet are often used for feedback on certain domestic issues.

==Law enforcement and crime==
The Dubai Police Force, founded in 1956 in the locality of Naif, has law enforcement jurisdiction over the emirate. The force is under the direct command of Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum. Dubai and Ras al Khaimah are the only emirates that do not conform to the federal judicial system of the United Arab Emirates. The emirate&#x27;s judicial courts comprise the Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Cassation. The Court of First Instance consists of the Civil Court, which hears all civil claims; the Criminal Court, which hears claims originating from police complaints; and Sharia Court, which is responsible for matters between Muslims. Non-Muslims do not appear before the Sharia Court. The Court of Cassation is the supreme court of the emirate and hears disputes on matters of law only. Alcohol sale and consumption, though legal, is regulated. Adult non-Muslims are allowed to consume alcohol in licensed venues, typically within hotels or at home with the possession of an alcohol license. Places other than hotels, clubs, and specially designated areas are typically not permitted to sell alcohol. In 2024, Dubai authorities charged an Irish woman for consuming alcohol.

As in other parts of the world, drinking and driving is illegal, with 21 being the legal drinking age in the Emirate of Dubai.

===International crime hub and criminal haven===
Dubai is a notorious global centre and sanctuary for money launderers, drug lords, corrupt political figures, and sanctioned businessmen. It has been called a &#x27;gangster&#x27;s paradise&#x27;. This includes money laundering by major crime syndicates.

This state of affairs has been enabled by a complex range of factors: the lack of extradition treaties with many countries, banking secrecy, liberal visa policies, low taxes, a large expatriate community in which shady figures are easily absorbed and welcomed, a non-transparent real estate market that readily enables money laundering, and not least, the monarchical dictatorship of the Maktoum family which facilitates it through deliberately lax legislation and policy.

Examples include Amit Gupta, who bribed Nauru politicians in an attempt to stage a coup that would give him control of that island&#x27;s mining rights and Ahmed Al Hamza, a transnational crime figure and one of Melbourne&#x27;s most powerful gangsters.

&quot;Dubai&#x27;s Role in Facilitating Corruption and Global Illicit Financial Flows&quot;, a 2020 report from the influential Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, stated: &quot;Part of what underpins Dubai&#x27;s prosperity is a steady stream of illicit proceeds borne from corruption and crime...Meanwhile, both Emirati leaders and the international community continue to turn a blind eye to the problematic behaviours, administrative loopholes, and weak enforcement practices that make Dubai a globally attractive destination for dirty money.&quot;

Dubai is an investment base for the international drug trade by Balkan criminal groups, while Belgian criminals are notably active in its real estate market on behalf of Russian oligarchs and politicians, who seek to launder their ill-gotten gains. In 2022, a data leak obtained by the U.S. Center for Advanced Defense Studies (C4ADS), exposed just some of this activity. Dubai is under observation by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which is likely to bring greater international scrutiny and pressure on its government.

Ireland&#x27;s Kinahan Cartel had been undertaking its operations from Dubai, which was becoming a haven for organized crime gangs. The cartel is run by the founder Christy Kinahan and his sons, Daniel and Christopher Kinahan. Although they are regular visitors to Dubai, their exact whereabouts remain unknown. The crime group maintains connections with powerful Emirati families and the regime. Using their Emirati partners, the Kinahan family has established multiple companies in the Emirates to trade in clothing, textiles, and food, along with management in aviation consultancies in free zones. With Dubai becoming a refuge for criminals, the Kinahan cartel held regular meetings with their criminal associates in the city. The US, UK, and Europol targeted the organized crime group and imposed sanctions on the Kinahan family and seven of their associates. On 11 October 2024, the Interpol issued a red notice against a cartel member, Sean McGovern, who was arrested by the Dubai police. The Kinahan cartel was planning an escape from the Emirates, in case of an extradition request from Ireland. The group had a detailed plan to move to Russia. On 21 October, an extradition treaty was also signed between Ireland and the UAE.

===Human rights===
Companies in Dubai have in the past been criticised for human rights violations against labourers. Some of the 250,000 foreign labourers in the city have been alleged to live in conditions described by Human Rights Watch as &quot;less than humane&quot;. The mistreatment of foreign workers was a subject of the difficult-to-make documentary, &quot;Slaves in Dubai&quot; (2009). The Dubai government has denied labour injustices and stated that the watchdogs&#x27; (Human Rights Watch) accusations were &quot;misguided&quot;. The filmmaker explained in interviews how it was necessary to go undercover to avoid discovery by the authorities, who impose high fines on reporters attempting to document human rights abuses, including the conditions of construction workers.

Towards the end of March 2006, the government announced steps to allow construction unions. UAE labour minister Ali al-Kaabi said: &quot;Labourers will be allowed to form unions.&quot; As of 2020, the federal public prosecution has clarified that &quot;it is an offense when at least three public employees collectively leave work or one of the duties to achieve an unlawful purpose. Each employee will be punished with not less than 6 months in prison and not more than a year, as the imprisonment will be for leaving the job or duties that affect the health or the security of the people or affect other public services of public benefit.&quot; Any act of spreading discord among employees will be punishable by imprisonment, and in all cases, foreigners will be deported.

Homosexual acts are illegal under UAE law. Freedom of speech in Dubai is limited, with both residents and citizens facing severe sanctions from the government for speaking out against the royal family or local laws and culture. Some of the labourers lured by the higher pay available in Dubai are victims of human trafficking or forced labour while some women are even forced into the growing sex trade in Dubai, a centre of human trafficking and prostitution.

Defamation on social media is a punishable offence in Dubai with fines of up to half a million dirhams and a jail term of up to 2 years. In January 2020, three Sri Lankan expats were fined 500,000 dirhams (US$136,000) each for posting defamatory Islamophobic Facebook posts.

A victim of domestic violence, Tori Towey faced abuse since getting married in March 2024. She lived in Dubai and was working as a flight attendant for the Emirates Airlines. When she attempted to seek help for the first time in Dubai, Towey was mocked by an Emirati police officer. The authorities charged her with attempting suicide and illegal consumption of alcohol, along with banning her from leaving Dubai. Towey was assisted by Radha Sterling, who questioned Ireland&#x27;s travel advice, claiming it is &quot;insufficient&quot; to assist visitors, particularly women, in understanding how to attend to officials in the UAE. Sterling said it is difficult to explain to foreign travellers about how they can stay safe in the Emirates.

==Demographics==

===Ethnicity and languages===

, the population is 3,331,420 – an annual increase of 177,020 people which represents a growth rate of 5.64%. The region covers . The population density is 408.18/km2 – more than eight times that of the entire country. Dubai is the second most expensive city in the region and the 20th most expensive city in the world.

, only about 15% of the emirate&#x27;s population was made up of UAE nationals, with the rest comprising expatriates, many of whom either have been in the country for generations or were born in the UAE. Approximately 85% of the expatriate population (and 71% of the emirate&#x27;s total population) was Asian, chiefly Indian (51%) and Pakistani (16%); other significant Asian groups include Bangladeshis (9%) and Filipinos (3%). A quarter of the population (local and foreign) reportedly traces their origins to Iran. In addition, 16% of the population (or 288,000 persons) living in collective labour accommodation were not identified by ethnicity or nationality, but were thought to be primarily Asian. 461,000 Westerners live in the United Arab Emirates, making up 5.1% of its total population. There are over 100,000 British expatriates in Dubai, by far the largest group of Western expatriates in the city. The median age in the emirate was about 27 years. In 2014, there were estimated to be 15.54 births and 1.99 deaths per 1,000 people. There are other Arab nationals, including GCC nationals.

Arabic is the national and official language of the United Arab Emirates. The Gulf dialect of Arabic is spoken natively by most Emiratis; some Emiratis also speak Shihhi Arabic. English is used as a second language. Other major languages spoken in Dubai due to immigration are Malayalam, Hindi, Gujarati, Urdu, Persian, Sindhi, Tamil, Punjabi, Pashto, Bengali, Balochi, Tulu, Kannada, Sinhala, Marathi, Telugu, Tagalog, and Chinese, in addition to many other languages.

===Religion===
Article 7 of the UAE&#x27;s Provisional Constitution declares Islam the official state religion of the UAE. The government subsidises almost 95% of mosques and employs all Imams; approximately 5% of mosques are entirely private, and several large mosques have large private endowments. All mosques in Dubai are managed by the Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department also known as &quot;Awqaf&quot; under the Government of Dubai and all Imams are appointed by the Government. The Constitution of the United Arab Emirates provides for freedom of religion. Expats held to be preaching religious hatred or promoting religious extremism are usually jailed and deported.
Dubai has large Christian, Hindu, Sikh, Baháʼí, Buddhist,Jain and other religious communities residing in the city, as well as a small but growing Jewish community. In 2014, more than 56% of Dubai residents were Muslims, while 25% of the Dubai residents were Christians and 16% were Hindus. While around 2% of the Dubai residents were adherent of other religions. The Churches Complex in Jebel Ali Village is an area for several churches and temples of different religious denominations, especially Christian denominations.

Non-Muslim groups can own their own houses of worship, where they can practice their religion freely, by requesting a land grant and permission to build a compound. Groups that do not have their own buildings are allowed to use the facilities of other religious organisations or worship in private homes. Non-Muslim religious groups are also permitted to advertise group functions openly and distribute various religious literature. Catholics are served pastorally by the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Arabia. British preacher Reverend Andrew Thompson claimed that the United Arab Emirates is one of the most tolerant places in the world towards Christians and that it is easier to be a Christian in the UAE than in the UK. On 5 April 2020, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced the building of one of their temples in Dubai. As part of the announcement, church President Russell M. Nelson said, &quot;The plan for a temple in Dubai comes in response to their gracious invitation, which we gratefully acknowledge.&quot;

==Economy==


One of the world&#x27;s fastest-growing economies, Dubai&#x27;s gross domestic product is projected at over US$177 billion in 2021, with a growth rate of 6.1% in 2014. Although a number of core elements of Dubai&#x27;s trading infrastructure were built on the back of the oil industry, revenues from oil and natural gas account for less than 5% of the emirate&#x27;s revenues. It is estimated that Dubai produces of oil a day and substantial quantities of gas from offshore fields. The emirate&#x27;s share in the UAE&#x27;s total gas revenues is about 2%. Dubai&#x27;s oil reserves have diminished significantly and are expected to be exhausted in 20 years. Real estate and construction (22.6%), trade (16%), &quot;entrepôt&quot; (15%), and financial services (11%) are the largest contributors to Dubai&#x27;s economy.

Dubai&#x27;s non-oil foreign trade stood at $362 billion in 2014. Of the overall trade volumes, imports had the biggest share with a value of $230 billion while exports and re-exports to the emirate stood at $31 billion and $101 billion respectively.

By 2014, China had emerged as Dubai&#x27;s largest international trading partner, with a total of $47.7 billion in trade flows, up 29% from 2013. India was second among Dubai&#x27;s key trading partners with a trade of $29.7 billion, followed by the United States at $22.62 billion. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was Dubai&#x27;s fourth trading partner globally and first in the GCC and Arab world with a total trade value of $14.2 billion. Trade with Germany in 2014 totaled $12.3 billion, Switzerland and Japan both at $11.72 billion, and UK trade totaled $10.9 billion.
Historically, Dubai and its twin across Dubai Creek, Deira (independent of Dubai City at that time), were important ports of call for Western manufacturers. Most of the new city&#x27;s banking and financial centres were headquartered in the port area. Dubai maintained its importance as a trade route through the 1970s and 1980s. Dubai has a free trade in gold and, until the 1990s, was the hub of a &quot;brisk smuggling trade&quot; of gold ingots to India, where gold import was restricted. Dubai&#x27;s Jebel Ali port, constructed in the 1970s, has the largest human-made harbour in the world and was ranked seventh globally for the volume of container traffic it supports. Dubai is also a hub for service industries such as information technology and finance, with industry-specific free zones throughout the city. Dubai Internet City, combined with Dubai Media City as part of TECOM (Dubai Technology, Electronic Commerce and Media Free Zone Authority), is one such enclave, whose members include IT firms such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., Halliburton, Google, EMC Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Microsoft, Dell, and IBM, and media organisations such as MBC, CNN, BBC, Reuters, Sky News, and AP. Various programmes, resources, and value-added services support the growth of startups in Dubai and help them connect to new business opportunities.
The Dubai Financial Market (DFM) was established in March 2000 as a secondary market for trading securities and bonds, both local and foreign. As of the fourth quarter of 2006, its trading volume stood at about 400 billion shares, worth $95 billion in total. The DFM had a market capitalisation of about $87 billion. The other Dubai-based stock exchange is NASDAQ Dubai, which is the international stock exchange in the Middle East. It enables a range of companies, including UAE and regional small and medium-sized enterprises, to trade on an exchange with an international brand name, with access by both regional and international investors.

DMCC (Dubai Multi Commodities Centre) was established in 2002. It is the world&#x27;s fastest-growing free zone and has been nominated as &quot;Global Free Zone of the Year 2016&quot; by The &quot;Financial Times&quot; Magazine.

Dubai is also known as the City of Gold because a major part of the economy is based on gold trades, with Dubai&#x27;s total gold trading volumes in H1 2011 reaching 580 tonnes, with an average price of US$1,455 per troy ounce.

A &quot;City Mayors&quot; survey ranked Dubai 44th among the world&#x27;s best financial cities in 2007, while another report by &quot;City Mayors&quot; indicated that Dubai was the world&#x27;s 27th richest city in 2012, in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). Dubai is also an international financial centre (IFC) and has been ranked 37th within the top 50 global financial cities as surveyed by the MasterCard Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index (2007), and first within the Middle East. Since it opened in September 2004, the Dubai IFC has attracted, as a regional hub, leading international firms and set up the NASDAQ Dubai which lists equity, derivatives, structured products, Islamic bonds (sukuk), and other bonds. The Dubai IFC model is an independent risk-based regulator with a legislative system consistent with English common law.

In 2012, the Global City Competitiveness Index by the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Dubai at No. 40 with a total score of 55.9. According to its 2013 research report on the future competitiveness of cities, in 2025, Dubai will have moved up to 23rd place overall in the Index. Indians, followed by Britons and Pakistanis are the top foreign investors in Dubai real estate.

Dubai has launched several major projects to support its economy and develop different sectors. These include Dubai Fashion 2020 and Dubai Design District, which is expected to become a home to leading local and international designers. The AED 4 billion first phase of the project was completed in 2015.

As of March 2024, Dubai began operating the world&#x27;s biggest waste-to-energy facility, which will power approximately 135,000 homes.

In July 2024, Dubai signed an agreement to develop a logistic hub for food, fruits, and vegetables that is planned to be the largest of its kind in the world. UAE Minister of Finance Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed was present at the signing.

In 2024, the city of Dubai ranked 12 out of 142 cities in the Smart City Index.

===Real estate and property===

In September 2019, Dubai&#x27;s ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum ordered the establishment of the Higher Committee for Real Estate Planning to study and evaluate future real estate construction projects, in order to achieve a balance between supply and demand, which is seen as a move to curb the pace of construction projects following a decline in property prices.

The government&#x27;s decision to diversify from a trade-based, oil-reliant economy to one that is service- and tourism-oriented made property more valuable, resulting in property appreciation from 2004 to 2006. A longer-term assessment of Dubai&#x27;s property market, however, showed depreciation; some properties lost as much as 64% of their value from 2001 to November 2008. The large-scale real estate development projects have led to the construction of some of the tallest skyscrapers and largest projects in the world such as the Emirates Towers, the Burj Khalifa, the Palm Islands, and the most expensive hotel, the Burj Al Arab. Dubai&#x27;s property market experienced a major downturn in 2008 and 2009 as a result of the slowing economic climate. By early 2009, the situation had worsened with the Great Recession taking a heavy toll on property values, construction, and employment. This has had a major impact on property investors in the region, some of whom were unable to release funds from investments made in property developments. , Dubai&#x27;s foreign debt was estimated at $80 billion, although this is a tiny fraction of the sovereign debt worldwide.

In Dubai, many of the property owners are residents or genuine investors. However, the 2020 Data from the Centre for Advanced Defense Studies (C4ADS) exposed that several real estate owners in the city were either facing international sanctions or were involved in criminal activities. Some others were public officials, with a minimal possibility of purchasing it with their known incomes. The report &quot;Dubai Uncovered&quot; mentioned names of 100 Russian oligarchs, public officials, and Europeans involved in money laundering. Benefiting from Dubai&#x27;s lack of proper real estate regulations, several corrupt people owned a house away from home, laundered their illicit money, and invested to store their wealth. Names of some of such questionable figures included Daniel Kinahan, Alexander Borodai, Roman Lyabikhov, Tibor Bokor, Ruslan Baisarov, Miroslav Výboh, and others.

For years, Dubai has been labeled as a major hub for laundering illicit cash, primarily through its real estate market. Due to the UAE&#x27;s lack of proper regulations and extradition treaties with many countries, fugitives found it to be a perfect hideout. The &quot;Dubai Unlocked&quot; investigation by journalists from 75 media outlets, in coordination with OCCRP and E24, revealed how Dubai&#x27;s real estate market became a haven for criminals, money launderers, drug lords, fugitives, political figures accused of corruption, and sanctioned individuals to hide their money in Dubai. The investigation was based on 2020 and 2022 data leaks, primarily from the Dubai Land Department and publicly owned utility companies. The EU Tax Observatory and Norway&#x27;s Centre for Tax Research evaluated that in 2022, foreign ownership in Dubai&#x27;s real estate market was worth approximately $160 billion. Until 2022, there was no obligation for real estate agents, brokers, and lawyers in Dubai to report large cash or cryptocurrency transactions to authorities.

Following February 2022, property prices in Dubai increased significantly, as wealthy Russians started investing in the UAE&#x27;s real estate after the Ukraine invasion. Since 2020, property prices in Dubai increased by 124%. Meanwhile, the EU Tax Observatory and Norway&#x27;s Centre for Tax Research revealed that Russians invested around $6.3 billion in Dubai&#x27;s existing and in-developed properties, since 2022. The increase in property prices pushed out the British expatriates, and forced them to look for property outside Dubai in cities like Ras Al Khaimah.

Despite the rising property prices, real estate transactions in Dubai are at an all time high, with 180,987 transactions worth AED 522.5bn taking place in 2024. This marks a 36.5% increase in the volume of transactions since 2023.

===Tourism and retail===

Tourism is an important part of the Dubai government&#x27;s strategy to maintain the flow of foreign cash into the emirate. Dubai&#x27;s lure for tourists is based mainly on shopping, but also on its possession of other ancient and modern attractions. As of 2018, Dubai is the fourth-most-visited city in the world based on the number of international visitors and the fastest growing, increasing by a 10.7% rate. The city hosted 14.9 million overnight visitors in 2016, and is expected to reach 20 million tourists by 2020. A great tourist attraction in Dubai is the Burj Khalifa, currently the tallest building in the world, although Jeddah Tower in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia is aiming to be taller.
Dubai has been called the &quot;shopping capital of the Middle East&quot;. Dubai alone has more than 70 shopping centres, including the world&#x27;s second-largest shopping centre, The Dubai Mall. As of June 2024 the Emirate real estate developer Emaar Properties, announced plans to expand the 12-million-square-foot mall, for 1.5 billion dirhams ($408 million), adding a further 240 luxury stores, along with new food outlets. Dubai is also known for the historical souk districts located on either side of its creek. Traditionally, dhows from East Asia, China, Sri Lanka, and India would discharge their cargo and the goods would be bargained over in the souks adjacent to the docks. Dubai Creek played a vital role in sustaining the life of the community in the city and was the resource that originally drove the economic boom in Dubai. , Dubai Creek has been proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Many boutiques and jeweler stores are also found in the city. Dubai is also referred to as &quot;the City of Gold&quot; as the Gold Souk in Deira houses nearly 250 gold retail shops.
Dubai Creek Park in Dubai Creek also plays a vital role in Dubai tourism as it showcases some of the most famous tourist attractions in Dubai such as the Dolphinarium, Cable Car, Camel Ride, Horse Carriage, and Exotic Birds Shows.

Dubai has a wide range of parks like Safa Park, Mushrif Park, and Hamriya Park. Each park is uniquely distinct from the others. Mushrif Park showcases different houses from around the world. A visitor can check out the architectural features of the outside as well as the inside of each house.

Some of the most popular beaches in Dubai are Umm Suqeim Beach, Al Mamzar Beach Park, JBR Open Beach, Kite Beach, Black Palace Beach, and Royal Island Beach Club. Mastercard&#x27;s Global Destination Cities Index 2019 found that tourists spend more in Dubai than in any other country. In 2018, the country topped the list for the fourth year in a row with a total spend of $30.82 billion. The average spend per day was found to be $553.

In October 2019, Dubai loosened its liquor laws for the first time, under which it allowed tourists to purchase alcohol from state-controlled stores. Previously, alcohol was accessible only to locals with special licences. The crucial policy shift came as the United Arab Emirates witnessed a severe economic crisis that led to a drop in alcohol sales by volume.

In 2021, the UAE was ranked amongst the 20 most dangerous places for LGBTQ tourists to visit. In 2022, there were cases where several LGBTQ tourists who travelled to Dubai faced issues and were deported. In March 2022, Thai transgender model Rachaya Noppakaroon visited Dubai for her performance at the Expo 2020 but was sent back because her passport stated her gender as male. In another case, a French influencer on TikTok and Snapchat, Ibrahim Godin, was sent back from Dubai because the authorities assumed his male friend travelling with him was his boyfriend. Ibrahim filed a complaint for &quot;public defamation because of sexual orientation&quot; and an investigation was opened by the Vesoul police. He said, &quot;Dubai is not all pretty, all rosy as we see on social networks.&quot;

===Expo 2020===
On 2 November 2011, four cities had their bids for Expo 2020 already lodged, with Dubai making a last-minute entry. The delegation from the Bureau International des Expositions, which visited Dubai in February 2013 to examine the Emirate&#x27;s readiness for the largest exposition, was impressed by the infrastructure and the level of national support. In May 2013, the Dubai Expo 2020 Master Plan was revealed. Dubai then won the right to host Expo 2020 on 27 November 2013.

The main site of Dubai Expo 2020 was planned to be a 438-hectare area (1,083 acres), part of the new &quot;Dubai Trade Centre Jebel Ali&quot; urban development, located midway between Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Moreover, the Expo 2020 also created various social enlistment projects and monetary boons to the city targeting the year 2020, such as initiating the world&#x27;s largest solar power project.

The Dubai Expo 2020 was scheduled to take place from 20 October 2020 until 10 April 2021 for 173 days where there would be 192 country pavilions featuring narratives from every part of the globe, have different thematic districts that would promote learning the wildlife in the forest exhibit too many other experiences.

Due to the impact of COVID-19 the organisers of Expo 2020 postponed the Expo by one year to begin in 2021 (the new dates are 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022).

Dubai has targets to build an inclusive, barrier-free, and disabled-friendly city, which opened as Expo City Dubai. The city has already brought in changes by introducing wheelchair-friendly taxis, pavements with slopes, and tactile indicators on the floor for the visually impaired at all the metro stations.

==Architecture==


Dubai has a rich collection of buildings and structures of various architectural styles. Many modern interpretations of Islamic architecture can be found here, due to a boom in construction and architectural innovation in the Arab World in general, and in Dubai in particular, supported not only by top Arab or international architectural and engineering design firms such as Al Hashemi and Aedas, but also by top firms of New York and Chicago. As a result of this boom, modern Islamic – and world – architecture has literally been taken to new levels in skyscraper building design and technology. Dubai now has more completed or topped-out skyscrapers higher than , , or than any other city. A culmination point was reached in 2010 with the completion of the Burj Khalifa (Khalifa Tower), now by far the world&#x27;s tallest building at . The Burj Khalifa&#x27;s design is derived from the patterning systems embodied in Islamic architecture, with the triple-lobed footprint of the building based on an abstracted version of the desert flower hymenocallis which is native to the Dubai region.

The completion of the Khalifa Tower, following the construction boom that began in the 1980s, accelerated in the 1990s and took on a rapid pace of construction during the decade of the 2000s, leaves Dubai with the world&#x27;s tallest skyline . At the top, Burj Khalifa, the world&#x27;s second highest observatory deck after the Shanghai Tower with an outdoor terrace, is one of Dubai&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions, with over 1.87 million visitors in 2013.

The Creek Tower had been planned in the 2010s to keep Dubai atop the list of tallest buildings. However, construction was placed on indefinite hold during the coronavirus pandemic and no date has been announced for the project to continue.

===Burj Al Arab===

The Burj Al Arab (Arabic: برج العرب, &quot;Tower of the Arabs&quot;), a luxury hotel, is frequently described as &quot;the world&#x27;s only 7-star&quot;, though its management has never made that claim but has claimed to be a &quot;five-star deluxe property.&quot; The term &quot;7-star hotel&quot; was coined by a British journalist to describe their initial experience of the hotel. A Jumeirah Group spokesperson is quoted as saying: &quot;There&#x27;s not a lot we can do to stop it. We&#x27;re not encouraging the use of the term. We&#x27;ve never used it in our advertising.&quot; The hotel opened in December 1999.

===Burj Khalifa===
Burj Khalifa, known as the Burj Dubai before its inauguration, is a high skyscraper in Dubai, and the tallest building in the world. The tower was inspired by the structure of the desert flower &quot;Hymenocallis&quot;. It was constructed by more than 30 contracting companies around the world with workers of a hundred nationalities. It is an architectural icon, named after Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The building opened on 4 January 2010.

===Palm Jumeirah===
The Palm Jumeirah is an artificial archipelago, created using land reclamation by Nakheel Properties, a company owned by the Dubai government, and designed and developed by Helman Hurley Charvat Peacock/Architects, Inc. It is one of three planned islands called the Palm Islands which extend into the Persian Gulf. The Palm Jumeirah is the smallest and the original of the three Palm Islands, and it is located in the Jumeirah coastal area of Dubai. It was built between 2001 and 2006.

===The World Islands===

The World Islands is an archipelago of small artificial islands constructed in the shape of a world map, located in the waters of the Persian Gulf, 4.0 kilometres (2.5 mi) off the coast of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The World islands are composed mainly of sand dredged from Dubai&#x27;s shallow coastal waters and are one of several artificial island developments in Dubai. The area of each island varies from 250,000 to 900,000 square feet. The islands are arranged in the shape of the world map and the archipelago covers around 9 km in width.

===Dubai Miracle Garden===

On 14 February 2013, the Dubai Miracle Garden, a flower garden, opened in Dubailand. It is the world&#x27;s largest flower garden. The garden displays more than 50 million flowers with more than 70 species of flowering plants. The garden uses retreated waste water from city&#x27;s municipality and utilises drip irrigation method for watering the plants. During the summer seasons from late May to September when the climate can get extremely hot with an average high of about , the garden stays closed.

=== Aeternitas Tower ===
In early January 2024, Dubai announced its intentions to build the Aeternitas Tower, which will become the world&#x27;s tallest residential clock tower at a height of . That is four times the height of London&#x27;s Big Ben. The tallest clock tower to date is Makkah Clock Royal Tower in Mecca. The tower&#x27;s name &quot;Aeternitas&quot; comes from the ancient Roman religion; she was the divine personification of eternity. The project is a joint venture between Dubai-based real estate developer London Gate and Swiss luxury watch manufacturer Franck Muller. The tower offers luxury apartments, including 1 to 4-bedroom units, as well as Sky Villas and Sky Mansions, with interiors inspired by Franck Muller&#x27;s designs.

===Dubai Marina===
Dubai Marina is an artificial canal city, built along a 3-kilometre (2 mi) stretch of Persian Gulf shoreline. , it had a population of 55,052. When the entire development is complete, it will accommodate more than 120,000 people in residential towers and villas. The 50 million square feet area of the Dubai Marina boasts a centrepiece that includes a 3.5-kilometer water canal which is the heart of the development and which provides dual access to the sea which makes Dubai Marina a foremost sailing destination. It is located on Interchange 5 between Jebel Ali Port and the area which hosts Dubai Internet City, Dubai Media City, and the American University in Dubai. The first phase of this project has been completed. Dubai Marina was inspired by the Concord Pacific Place development along False Creek in Vancouver, BC, Canada. There have been many instances of marine wildlife (especially whales and sharks) entering the marina because of its proximity to the open sea.

===Address Beach Resort and Address Beach Residences===
The structure is a set of two towers connected at the bottom and with a sky bridge at the top which connects the 63rd through to the 77th levels. The sky bridge houses luxury apartments on the world&#x27;s highest occupiable sky bridge floor, at 294.36 metres. Known as Jumeirah Gate, it opened in December 2020 and is situated along the beach. The towers have the world&#x27;s highest infinity pool in a building, on the roof, at a height of 293.906 metres.

==Transportation==

Transport in Dubai is controlled by the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), an agency of the government of Dubai, formed by a royal decree in 2005. The public transport network has in the past faced congestion and reliability issues which a large investment programme has addressed, including over AED 70 billion of improvements planned for completion by 2020, when the population of the city is projected to exceed 3.5 million. In 2009, according to Dubai Municipality statistics, there were an estimated 1,021,880 cars in Dubai. In January 2010, the proportion of Dubai residents who use public transport stood at 6%.

===Road===


Five main routes – E 11 (Sheikh Zayed Road), E 311 (Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road), E 44 (Dubai-Hatta Highway), E 77 (Dubai-Al Habab Road), and E 66 (Oud Metha Road, Dubai-Al Ain Road, or Tahnoun Bin Mohammad Al Nahyan Road) – run through Dubai, connecting the city to other towns and emirates. Additionally, several important intra-city routes, such as D 89 (Al Maktoum Road/Airport Road), D 85 (Baniyas Road), D 75 (Sheikh Rashid Road), D 73 (Al Dhiyafa Road now named as 2 December street), D 94 (Jumeirah Road), and D 92 (Al Khaleej/Al Wasl Road) connect the various localities in the city. The eastern and western sections of the city are connected by Al Maktoum Bridge, Al Garhoud Bridge, Al Shindagha Tunnel, Business Bay Crossing, and Floating Bridge.

The public bus transport system in Dubai is run by the RTA. The bus system services 140 routes and transported over 109 million people in 2008. By the end of 2010, there will be 2,100 buses in service across the city. In 2006, the transport authority announced the construction of 500 air-conditioned passenger bus shelters, and planned for 1,000 more across the emirates in a move to encourage the use of public buses.

All taxi services are licensed by the RTA. Dubai licensed taxis are easily identifiable by their cream bodywork colour, with varied roof colours identifying the operator. Dubai Taxi Corporation, a division of the RTA, is the largest operator and has taxis with red roofs. There are five private operators: Metro Taxis (orange roofs); Network Taxis (yellow roofs); Cars Taxis (blue roofs); Arabia Taxis (green roofs); and City Taxis (purple roof). In addition, there is a Ladies and Families taxi service (pink roofs) with female drivers, which caters exclusively to women and children. More than 3,000 taxis are operating within the emirate, making an average of 192,000 trips daily, carrying about 385,000 people. In 2009, taxi trips exceeded 70 million trips, serving around 140.45 million passengers.

===Air===

Dubai International Airport (IATA: DXB), the hub for the Emirates airline, serves the city of Dubai and other emirates in the country. The airport is the third-busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic and the world&#x27;s busiest airport by international passenger traffic. In addition to being an important passenger traffic hub, the airport is the sixth-busiest cargo airport in world, handling 2.37 million tons of cargo in 2014. Emirates is the national airline of Dubai. , it operated internationally, serving over 150 destinations in over 70 countries across six continents.

The development of Al Maktoum International Airport (IATA: DWC) was announced in 2004. The first phase of the airport, featuring one A380 capable runway, 64 remote stands, one cargo terminal with an annual capacity for 250,000 tonnes of cargo, and a passenger terminal building designed to accommodate five million passengers per year, has been opened. When completed, Dubai World Central-Al Maktoum International will be the largest airport in the world with five runways, four terminal buildings, and capacity for 160 million passengers and 12 million tons of cargo.

===Rail===


Dubai Metro consists of two lines (Red line and Green line) which run through the financial and residential areas of the city. It was opened in September 2009. UK-based international service company Serco is responsible for operating the metro. The Red Line is the major backbone, with 29 stations (4 underground, 24 elevated, and 1 at ground level) running from Rashidiya Station to UAE Xchange Station in Jebel Ali. The Green Line, running from the Etisalat Station to the Creek Station, has 20 stations (8 underground, 12 elevated). An extension to the Red Line connecting the EXPO 2020 site opened on June 1, 2021. A Blue and a Purple Line have also been planned. The Dubai Metro is the first urban train network in the Arabian Peninsula. The trains are fully automated and driverless.

A monorail line connecting the Palm Jumeirah to the mainland opened on 30 April 2009. It is the first monorail in the Middle East. An extension to connect to the Red Line of the Dubai Metro is planned.

A tramway located in Al Sufouh will run for along Al Sufouh Road from Dubai Marina to the Burj Al Arab and the Mall of the Emirates with two interchanges with Dubai Metro Red Line. The first section, a long tram line which serves 11 stations, was opened in 2014.

Dubai has announced it will complete a link of the UAE high-speed rail system which is planned to link with the whole GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council, also known as Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf), and then possibly Europe. The high-speed rail will support passengers and cargo.

===Waterways===
There are two major commercial ports in Dubai, Port Rashid and Port Jebel Ali. Port Jebel Ali is the world&#x27;s largest human-made harbour, the biggest port in the Middle East, and the 7th-busiest port in the world. One of the more traditional methods of getting across Bur Dubai to Deira is by &quot;abras&quot;, small boats that ferry passengers across the Dubai Creek, between abra stations in Bastakiya and Baniyas Road. The Marine Transport Agency has also implemented the Dubai Water Bus System. Water bus is a fully air-conditioned boat service across selected destinations across the creek. One can also avail oneself of the tourist water bus facility in Dubai. The latest addition to the water transport system is the Water Taxi. The Water-Taxis can transport a maximum of 20 passengers at a time which provides a smooth journey along Al Mamzar and Dubai Marina via Dubai Creek. It has 40 pick-up points all over Dubai.

Dubai is increasingly activating its logistics and ports to participate in trade between Europe and China or Africa in addition to oil transport. For this purpose, ports such as the Port of Jebel Ali or Mina Rashid are rapidly expanded and investments are made in their technology. The country is historically and currently part of the Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to the south via the southern tip of India to Mombasa, from there through the Red Sea via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the North Sea.

==Culture==


The UAE&#x27;s culture mainly reflects traditional Arab culture. The influence of Arab and Islamic culture on its architecture, music, attire, cuisine, and lifestyle is very prominent as well. Five times every day, Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques that are scattered around the country. Major holidays in Dubai include Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, and National Day (2 December), which marks the formation of the United Arab Emirates.

The city&#x27;s cultural imprint as a small, ethnically homogeneous pearling community was changed with the arrival of other ethnic groups and nationals—first by the Iranians in the early 1900s, and later by Indians and Pakistanis in the 1960s. In 2005, 84% of the population of metropolitan Dubai was foreign-born, about half of them from India.

From 2006 to 2022, the weekend had been Friday and Saturday, as a compromise between Friday&#x27;s holiness to Muslims and the Western weekend of Saturday and Sunday. Before 2006, the weekend was Thursday-Friday. On 1 January 2022, Dubai moved to a four-and-a-half day working week, with the weekend comprising Friday afternoon, Saturday, and Sunday.

Because of the touristic approach of many Dubaites in the entrepreneurial sector and the high standard of living, Dubai&#x27;s culture has gradually evolved towards one of luxury, opulence, and lavishness with a high regard for leisure-related extravagance. Dubai is known for its nightlife. Clubs and bars are found mostly in hotels because of liquor laws. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Dubai as &quot;the kind of city where you might run into Michael Jordan at the Buddha Bar or stumble across Naomi Campbell celebrating her birthday with a multiday bash&quot;.

Annual entertainment events such as the Dubai Shopping Festival (DSF) and Dubai Summer Surprises (DSS) attract over 4 million visitors from across the region and generate revenues over $2.7 billion. The International Festivals and Events Association (IFEA), the world&#x27;s leading events trade association, has crowned Dubai as &quot;IFEA World Festival and Event City, 2012&quot; in the cities category with a population of more than one million.

Large shopping malls in the city, such as Deira City Centre, Mirdiff City Centre, BurJuman, Mall of the Emirates, Dubai Mall (the world&#x27;s second-largest), Dubai Marina Mall, Dubai Hills Mall, Dragon Mart, Dubai Festival City Mall, and Ibn Battuta Mall as well as traditional Dubai Gold Souk, Al Souk Al Kabir (known as Meena Bazaar), and other &quot;souks&quot; attract shoppers from the region.

===Cuisine===

Arabic cuisine is very popular and is available everywhere in the city, from the small &quot;shawarma&quot; diners in Deira and Al Karama to the restaurants in Dubai&#x27;s hotels. Fast food, South Asian, and Chinese cuisines are also very popular and are widely available. The sale and consumption of pork is regulated and is legally permitted to be sold only to non-Muslims, in designated areas of supermarkets and airports. Similarly, the sale of alcoholic beverages is also regulated. A liquor permit is required to purchase alcohol; however, alcohol is available in bars and restaurants within hotels. &quot;Shisha&quot; and &quot;qahwa&quot; boutiques are also popular in Dubai. Biryani is also a popular cuisine across Dubai with it being the most popular among the Indians and Pakistanis present in Dubai.

The inaugural Dubai Food Festival was held between 21 February to 15 March 2014. According to &quot;Vision&quot; magazine, the event was aimed at enhancing and celebrating Dubai&#x27;s position as the gastronomic capital of the region. The festival was designed to showcase the variety of flavours and cuisines on offer in Dubai, featuring the cuisines of over 200 nationalities at the festival. The next food festival was held between 23 February 2017 to 11 March 2017.

===Entertainment===
Dubai Opera opened its doors on 31 August 2016 in Downtown Dubai with a performance by Plácido Domingo. The venue is a 2000-seat, multifunctional performing arts centre that can host not only theatrical shows, concerts, and operas, but also weddings, gala dinners, banquets, and conferences. Arabic movies are popular in Dubai and the UAE. Since 2004, the city has hosted the annual Dubai International Film Festival which serves as a showcase for Arab and Middle Eastern filmmaking talent. The Dubai Desert Rock Festival was also another major festival consisting of heavy metal and rock artists but is no longer held in Dubai.

One of the lesser-known sides of Dubai is the importance of its young contemporary art gallery scene. Since 2008, the leading contemporary art galleries such as Carbon 12 Dubai, Green Art, gallery Isabelle van den Eynde, and The Third Line have brought the city onto the international art map. Art Dubai, the growing and reputable art fair of the region is also a major contributor to the contemporary art scene&#x27;s development. The Theatre of Digital Art Dubai (ToDA) opened in 2020 and presents immersive digital art, including contemporary work.

===Media===

Many international news agencies such as Reuters, APTN, Bloomberg L.P., and Middle East Broadcasting centre (MBC) operate in Dubai Media City and Dubai Internet City. Additionally, several local network television channels such as Dubai One (formerly Channel 33) and Dubai TV (EDTV) provide programming in English and Arabic respectively. Dubai is also the headquarters for several print media outlets. &quot;Dar Al Khaleej&quot;, &quot;Al Bayan&quot;, and &quot;Al Ittihad&quot; are the city&#x27;s largest circulating Arabic language newspapers, while &quot;Gulf News&quot;, &quot;Khaleej Times&quot;, &quot;Khaleej Mag&quot;, and &quot;7days&quot; are the largest circulating English newspapers.

Etisalat, the government-owned telecommunications provider, held a virtual monopoly over telecommunication services in Dubai before the establishment of other, smaller telecommunications companies such as Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC—better known as Du) in 2006. Internet was introduced into the UAE (and therefore Dubai) in 1995. The network has an Internet bandwidth of 7.5 Gbit/s with a capacity of 49 STM1 links. Dubai houses two of four Domain Name System (DNS) data centres in the country (DXBNIC1, DXBNIC2). Censorship is common in Dubai and used by the government to control content that it believes violates the cultural and political sensitivities of Emirates. Homosexuality, drugs, and the theory of evolution are generally considered taboo.

Internet content is regulated in Dubai. Etisalat uses a proxy server to filter Internet content that the government deems to be inconsistent with the values of the country, such as sites that provide information on how to bypass the proxy; sites about dating, gay and lesbian networks, and pornography; and previously, sites originating from Israel. Emirates Media and Internet (a division of Etisalat) notes that , 76% of Internet users are male. About 60% of Internet users were Asian, while 25% of users were Arab. Dubai enacted an Electronic Transactions and Commerce Law in 2002 which deals with digital signatures and electronic registers. It prohibits Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from disclosing information gathered in providing services. The penal code contains official provisions that prohibit digital access to pornography; however, it does not address cyber crime or data protection. In 2019 the Italian artist Princess Bee produced &quot;Hi Dubai&quot;, the first cross media format revealing the &quot;soul of the city&quot; through the life and work experience of 25 Emirati and expat women. The series also promoted the Emirate&#x27;s lifestyle and main events to attract young people to visit and live in Dubai. &quot;Hi Dubai&quot; was on air on the national channel Dubai One TV, in prime time, after the National News during the U.A.E. National Day week; then distributed online on Dubai Post and in-flight on ICE in all Emirates Airlines flights.

===Sports===

Football and cricket are the most popular sports in Dubai. The headquarters of International Cricket Council is in Dubai. Three football teams (Al Wasl FC, Shabab Al-Ahli Dubai FC, and Al Nasr SC) represent Dubai in UAE Pro-League. Al-Wasl have the second-most championships in the UAE League, after Al Ain. Dubai also hosts both the annual Dubai Tennis Championships and The Legends Rock Dubai tennis tournaments, as well as the Dubai Desert Classic golf tournament and the DP World Tour Championship, all of which attract sports stars from around the world. The Dubai World Cup, a thoroughbred horse race, is held annually at the Meydan Racecourse. The city&#x27;s top basketball team has traditionally been Shabab Al Ahli Basket. Dubai also hosts the traditional rugby union tournament Dubai Sevens, part of the Sevens World Series Event pictures of Rugby 7 Dubai 2015. In 2009, Dubai hosted the 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens. Auto racing is also a big sport in Dubai; the Dubai Autodrome is home to many auto racing events throughout the year. Another sporting event in Dubai is the Dubai Run, which is part of the Dubai Fitness Challenge, the world&#x27;s largest free fun run and one of the main highlights of the Dubai Fitness Challenge Since 2017. It also features a state-of-the-art indoor and outdoor Kartdrome, popular among racing enthusiasts and recreational riders. The Indian Premier League cricket competition was held in UAE in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 12, Tommy Fleetwood, 7-time DP-world Tour winner was declared World Global Ambassador.

===Dress code===

The Emirati attire is typical of several countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Women usually wear the &quot;abaya&quot;, a long black robe with a hijab (the headscarf which covers the neck and part of the head-all of the hair and ears). Some women may add a niqab which covers the mouth and nose and only leaves the eyes exposed. Men wear the &quot;kandurah&quot; also referred to as &quot;dishdasha&quot; or even &quot;thawb&quot; (long white robe) and the headscarf (ghotrah). The UAE traditional ghutrah is white and is held in place by an accessory called &quot;egal&quot;, which resembles a black cord. The younger Emiratis prefer to wear red and white ghutrah and tie it around their head like a turban.

The above dress code is never compulsory and many people wear Western or other Eastern clothing without any problems, but prohibitions on wearing &quot;indecent clothing&quot; or revealing too much skin are aspects of the UAE to which Dubai&#x27;s visitors are expected to conform, and are encoded in Dubai&#x27;s criminal law. The UAE has enforced decency regulations in most public places, aside from waterparks, beaches, clubs, and bars.

==Education==
The school system in Dubai follows that of the United Arab Emirates. , there are 79 public schools run by the Ministry of Education that serve Emiratis and expatriate Arab people as well as 207 private schools. The medium of instruction in public schools is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language, while most of the private schools use English as their medium of instruction. Currently, only the Swiss International Scientific School in Dubai claims to offer parallel streams in different languages – bilingual English/French or English/German. Most private schools cater to one or more expatriate communities.
Some 36 schools offer international education using one or more of the four International Baccalaureate Programmes for students aged 3–19. Currently, 15 schools have introduced the IB Career-related Programme that can be combined with a vocational qualification such as a BTEC.

While there are more UK-curriculum-based schools in Dubai than any other, more students attend an Indian-curriculum school, which tends to be considerably larger and costs less to attend. There are 34 Indian-curriculum schools in the emirate, most of which offer the CBSE, and just a handful the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Indian syllabus. Examples of Indian-curriculum schools include IHS, DPS, and DMHS. There are a small number of Pakistani schools offering the FBISE curriculum for expatriate children in Dubai.

A total of 18 schools offer British primary education up to the age of 11. There are 64 schools that offer a variation of a UK curriculum style secondary education, either a pure GCSE and A-Level offering, or increasingly I/GCSE up to 16, and then the IB Diploma post-16. Currently, no school in the UAE offers the choice of IB or A-Level at 16, but several schools have said they will do so in the future. British style eleven-to-eighteen secondary schools offering General Certificate of Secondary Education and A-Levels include Dubai College, Dubai British School, and English Language School Pvt. Some schools, such as The American School of Dubai, also offer the curriculum of the United States.

Dubai has a very active education regulator, the KHDA, which is best known for its school ratings, but actually has a wide mandate when it comes to school improvement in the emirate. Its inspections truly matter, and there is no doubt that school quality has improved as a result of its implementation. A total of 17 schools are currently rated Outstanding (2020), and a further 40 are rated Very Good. Parents in general rate schools highly.

The top 10 largest universities by student numbers in Dubai according to the KHDA (2024) are Middlesex University Dubai, Heriot-Watt University Dubai, University of Wollongong in Dubai, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Dubai, American University in Dubai, S P Jain School of Global Management, Rochester Institute of Technology of Dubai, Amity University Dubai, University of Birmingham Dubai, and Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani Dubai. They offer courses in all major subjects with the most popular subject areas being Business, followed by Information Technology, then Engineering. Most Universities in Dubai are located in the two Educational Zones (Knowledge Village or Academic City). In 2013, Synergy University Dubai Campus opened its campus in Jumeirah Lakes Towers being a first University in Dubai to be located outside of Educational Zones (Knowledge Village or Academic City).

Only 4 Dubai Universities are present in the QS World University Rankings 2024/2025. To allow the assessment of more UAE Universities, the Ministry of Education launched The National Higher Education Institutions Classification Framework which classifies UAE Universities based on their research and teaching. Of the top 10 largest Dubai universities University of Wollongong in Dubai, American University in Dubai, and Rochester Institute of Technology of Dubai, were all classified as &quot;Very Good&quot; within The National Higher Education Institutions Classification Framework.

==Healthcare==

Healthcare in Dubai can be divided into two different sectors: public and private. Each Emirate can dictate healthcare standards according to their internal laws, although the standards and regulations rarely have extreme differences. Public hospitals in Dubai were first built in the late 1950s and continued to grow with public health initiatives. There are now 28 hospitals in Dubai, 6 public and 22 private, with 3 more major hospitals scheduled to be built by 2025.

By the end of 2012, there were also a total of 1,348 medical clinics, 97% of which were operated privately. In 2015, Dubai phased in mandatory health insurance for all inhabitants, thereby leading to increased demand for medical services.

Dubai Hospital is a public hospital in Dubai and is part of Dubai Department of Health and Medical Services. Although the decision to construct Dubai Hospital was made in 1977, it did not begin admitting patients until March 1983. The hospital consists of 14 stories, with the lower two for Accident &amp; Emergency and outpatients, and the upper ten forwards.
