<text>Taipei 101 (; stylized in all caps), formerly known as the Taipei World Financial Center, is a 508 m (1,667 ft), 101-story skyscraper in Taipei, Taiwan. It is owned by Taipei Financial Center Corporation. The building was officially classified as the world&#x27;s tallest from its opening on 31 December 2004. Upon completion, it became the world&#x27;s first skyscraper to exceed half a kilometer. It is the tallest building in Taiwan and the eleventh tallest building in the world.

The building&#x27;s high-speed elevators, manufactured by Toshiba of Japan, held the record for the fastest in the world at the time of completion.

The elevators of Taipei 101 that transport passengers from the 5th to the 89th floor in 37 seconds (attaining ) set speed records. In 2011, Taipei 101 was awarded a Platinum certificate rating under the LEED certification system for energy efficiency and environmental design, becoming the tallest and largest green building in the world. The structure regularly appears as an icon of Taipei in international media, and the Taipei 101 fireworks displays are a regular feature of New Year&#x27;s Eve broadcasts and celebrations.

Taipei 101&#x27;s postmodernist architectural style evokes traditional Asian aesthetics in a modern structure employing industrial materials. Its design incorporates a number of features that enable the structure to withstand the Pacific Ring of Fire&#x27;s earthquakes and the region&#x27;s tropical storms. The tower houses offices, restaurants, shops, and indoor and outdoor observatories. The tower is adjoined by a multilevel shopping mall that has the world&#x27;s largest ruyi symbol as an exterior feature.

== History ==

=== Planning ===

In 1997, led by developer Harace Lin, the Taipei Financial Center Corporation, a team led by several Taiwan banks and insurance companies, won the rights to lease the site for 70 years and develop a building, placing the winning bid of NT$20,688,890,000 for the Build Operate Transfer agreement with the city government.

===Construction===
Planning for Taipei 101 began in July 1997 during Chen Shui-bian&#x27;s term as Taipei mayor. Talks between merchants and city government officials initially centered on a proposal for a 66-story tower to serve as an anchor for new development in Taipei&#x27;s 101 business district. Planners were considering taking the new structure to a more ambitious height only after an expat suggested it, along with many of the other features used in the design of the building. It was not until the summer of 2000 that the city granted a license for the construction of a 101-story tower on the site. In the meantime, construction proceeded and the first tower column was erected in the summer of 2001.

A major earthquake struck Taiwan on 31 March 2002, sending a construction crane falling from the 56th floor to Xinyi Road. The crane crushed several vehicles and caused five deaths - two crane operators and three workers who were not properly harnessed. However, an inspection showed no structural damage to the building, and construction work was able to restart within a week.

Taipei 101&#x27;s roof was completed three years later on 1 July 2003. Taipei 101 was completed in 2004. The construction was a joint venture led by Kumagai Gumi, a Japanese construction company, in cooperation with Samsung C&amp;T, a South Korean construction company. Samsung C&amp;T was responsible for overseeing the construction of the main structural framework, and RESE was responsible for the construction logistics and main foundation. Ma Ying-jeou, in his first term as Taipei mayor, fastened a golden bolt to signify the achievement. The formal opening of the tower took place on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2004. President Chen Shui-bian, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng cut the ribbon. Open-air concerts featured a number of popular performers, including singers A-Mei and Stefanie Sun. Visitors rode the elevators to the Observatory for the first time. A few hours later the first fireworks show at Taipei 101 heralded the arrival of a new year. It replaced the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur as the world&#x27;s tallest building.

=== Post-construction ===
The Taipei Financial Center Corporation (TFCC) announced plans on 2 November 2009 to make Taipei 101 &quot;the world&#x27;s tallest building&quot; by summer of 2011 as measured by LEED standards. The structure was already designed to be energy-efficient, with double-pane windows blocking external heat by 50% and recycled water meeting 20–30% of the building&#x27;s needs. LEED certification would entail inspections and upgrades in wiring, water and lighting equipment at a cost of NT$60 million (US$1.8 million). Estimates showed the savings resulting from the modifications paid for the cost of making them within three years. The project was carried out under the guidance of an international team composed of Siemens Building Technologies, architect and interior designer Steven Leach Group and the LEED advisory firm EcoTech International.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.buildingtechnologies.siemens.com/bt/global/en/Pages/home.aspx&quot;&gt;LEED certified: The tallest &quot;green&quot; building in the world . Siemens Building Technologies.&lt;/ref&gt; The company applied for a platinum-degree certification with LEED in early 2011. On 28 July 2011, Taipei 101 received LEED platinum certification under &quot;Existing Buildings: Operations and Maintenance&quot;. Although the project cost NT$60 million (US$2.08 million), it is expected to save 14.4 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, or an 18% energy-saving, equivalent to NT$36 million (US$1.2 million) in energy costs each year. In 2019, it was named among the 50 most influential skyscrapers in the world by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.

On 4 January 2020, the building had a condolence message in lights for the victims of a helicopter crash, which included a number of senior government officials. On 8 February 2020, it was reported that some passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise liner, quarantined for an outbreak of COVID-19, had visited Taipei 101 on 31 January at which point none exhibited symptoms. On 1 April 2020, the shopping center said it was reducing business hours due to the coronavirus pandemic. It had started checking shopper&#x27;s temperatures in February. On 21 May the building said it would resume normal business hours in June, as the country had effectively limited the spread of COVID-19.

=== Events and celebrity appearances ===

Taipei 101 is the site of many special events. Art exhibits, as noted above, regularly take place in the Observatory. A few noteworthy dates since the tower&#x27;s opening include these below:

* On 25 December 2004, French rock and urban climber Alain Robert made an authorized climb to the top of the pinnacle in four hours.
* On 28 February 2005, former President of the United States Bill Clinton visited and signed copies of his autobiography.
* On 19 April 2005, the tower displayed the formula &quot;E=mc2&quot; in lights to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the publication of Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity. The display, the largest of 65,000 such displays in 47 countries, was part of the international celebration World Year of Physics 2005&quot;.&quot;
* On 20 November 2005, the First annual Taipei 101 Run Up featured a race up the 2,046 steps from floors 1 to 91. Proceeds were to benefit Taiwan&#x27;s Olympic teams. Run Ups have continued to be held regularly.
* On 20 October 2006, the tower displayed a pink ribbon in lights to promote breast cancer awareness. The ten-day campaign was sponsored by Taipei 101&#x27;s ownership and Estée Lauder.
* On 12 December 2007, Austrian BASE jumper Felix Baumgartner survived an unauthorized parachute jump from the 91st floor. Baumgartner was banned from re-entry into Taiwan and Taipei 101 increased security measures along with disciplining security staff for failing to intervene.
* On 6 December 2014, Japanese idol group HKT48 held a small concert on the 91st-floor observatory as the premiere of their tour in Taiwan.

===New Year&#x27;s Eve fireworks displays===
The New Year&#x27;s Eve Show in Taipei is held at the Taipei City Hall. Visitors have a view of Taipei 101 which is surrounded by fireworks at midnight. Another popular location for crowds to gather to see the fireworks display is the public square of Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall.

==Architecture and design==

===Height===
Various sources, including the building&#x27;s owners, give the height of Taipei 101 as , roof height and top floor height as and . This lower figure is derived by measuring from the top of a platform at the base. CTBUH standards, though, include the height of the platform in calculating the overall height, as it represents part of the man-made structure and is above the level of the surrounding pavement. Taipei 101 displaced the Petronas Towers as the tallest building in the world by . The record it claimed for greatest height from ground to pinnacle was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which is in height. Taipei 101&#x27;s records for roof height and highest occupied floor briefly passed to the Shanghai World Financial Center in 2008, However, this record was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates in 2009.

Taipei 101 was the world&#x27;s tallest building, at as measured to its architectural top (spire), exceeding that of the Petronas Towers, which were previously the tallest skyscraper at . The height to the top of the roof, at , and highest occupied floor, at , surpassed the previous records of the Willis Tower: and , respectively. It also surpassed the 85-story, Tuntex Sky Tower in Kaohsiung as the tallest building in Taiwan and the 51-story, Shin Kong Life Tower as the tallest building in Taipei.

Taipei 101 comprises 101 floors above ground, as well as five basement levels. The first building to break the half-kilometer mark in height, it was the world&#x27;s tallest building from 31 March 2004 to 10 March 2010 (six years) until it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in 2010. For 12 years it also had the fastest elevator, at . It also has the largest wind damper in the world, at 18 feet across. As of 2023, Taipei 101 is the eleventh-tallest building in the world, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat&#x27;s official rankings.

===Structural design===
Taipei 101 is designed to withstand typhoon winds and earthquake tremors that are common in the area in the east of Taiwan. Evergreen Consulting Engineering, the structural engineer, designed Taipei 101 to withstand gale winds of , (), as well as the strongest earthquakes in a 2,500-year cycle.

Taipei 101 was designed to be flexible as well as structurally resistant, because while flexibility prevents structural damage, resistance ensures comfort both for the occupants and for the protection of the glass, curtain walls, and other features. Most designs achieve the necessary strength by enlarging critical structural elements such as bracing. Because of the height of Taipei 101, combined with the surrounding area&#x27;s geology—the building is located just away from a major fault line Outrigger trusses, located at eight-floor intervals, connect the columns in the building&#x27;s core to those on the exterior.

These features, combined with the solidity of its foundation, made Taipei 101 one of the most stable buildings ever constructed. The foundation is reinforced by 380 piles driven into the ground, extending as far as into the bedrock. Each pile is in diameter and can bear a load of .

Motioneering designed a steel pendulum that serves as a tuned mass damper, at a cost of NT$132 million (US$4 million). Suspended from the 92nd to the 88th floor, the pendulum sways to offset movements in the building caused by strong gusts. The tuned mass damper is visible to all visitors on the 88th through 92nd floors. It can reduce up to 40% of the tower&#x27;s movements. Its ball, the largest damper ball in the world, consists of 41 circular steel plates of varying diameters, each thick, welded together to form a ball. Two additional tuned mass dampers, each weighing , are installed at the tip of the spire which help prevent damage to the structure due to strong wind loads. On 8 August 2015, strong winds from Typhoon Soudelor swayed the main damper by —the largest movement ever recorded by the damper.

The damper has become such a popular tourist attraction that the city contracted Sanrio to create a mascot: the Damper Baby. Four versions of the Damper Baby (&quot;Rich Gold&quot;, &quot;Cool Black&quot;, &quot;Smart Silver&quot; and &quot;Lucky Red&quot;) were designed and made into figurines and souvenirs sold in various Taipei 101 gift shops. Damper Baby has become a popular local icon, with its own comic book and website.

===Structural facade===
Taipei 101&#x27;s characteristic blue-green glass curtain walls are double paned and glazed, offer heat and UV protection sufficient to block external heat by 50%, and can sustain impacts of . The facade system of glass and aluminum panels installed into an inclined movement-resisting lattice contributes to overall lateral rigidity by tying back to the mega-columns with one-story high trusses at every eighth floor. This facade system is, therefore, able to withstand up to of seismic lateral displacements without damage. The facade system is also known as a Damper.

The original corners of the facade were tested at RWDI in Ontario, Canada. A simulation of a 100-year storm at RWDI revealed a vortex that formed during a 3-second wind at a height of 10 meters, or equivalent to the lateral tower sway rate causing large crosswind oscillations. A double chamfered step design was found to dramatically reduce this crosswind oscillation, resulting in the final design&#x27;s &quot;double stairstep&quot; corner facade. Architect C.Y. Lee also used extensive facade elements to represent the symbolic identity he pursued. These facade elements included the green tinted glass for the indigenous slender bamboo look, eight upper outwards inclined tiers of pagoda each with eight floors, a ruyi and a money box symbol between the two facade sections among others.

Taipei 101&#x27;s own roof and facade recycled water system meets 20–30% of the building&#x27;s water needs. In July 2011, Taipei 101 was certified &quot;the world&#x27;s tallest green building&quot; under LEED standards.

===Symbolism===

The height of 101 floors commemorates the renewal of time: the new century that arrived as the tower was built (100+1) and all the new years that follow (1 January = 1-01). It symbolizes lofty ideals by going one better on 100, a traditional number of perfection. The number also evokes the binary numeral system used in digital technology.

The main tower features a series of eight segments of eight floors each. In Chinese-speaking cultures the number eight is associated with abundance, prosperity and good fortune.

The repeated segments simultaneously recall the rhythms of an Asian pagoda (a tower linking earth and sky, also evoked in the Petronas Towers), a stalk of bamboo (an icon of learning and growth), and a stack of ancient Chinese ingots or money boxes (a symbol of abundance). Popular humor sometimes likens the building&#x27;s shape to a stack of take-out boxes as used in Western-style Chinese food; of course, the stackable shape of such boxes is likewise derived from that of ancient money boxes. The four discs mounted on each face of the building where the pedestal meets the tower represent coins. The emblem placed over entrances shows three gold coins of ancient Chinese design with central holes shaped to imply the Arabic numerals &quot;1-0-1&quot;. The structure incorporates many shapes of squares and circles to symbolize yin and yang.

Curled ruyi figures appear throughout the structure as a design motif. Though the shape of each ruyi at Taipei 101 is traditional, its rendering in industrial metal is plainly modern. The ruyi is a talisman of ancient origin associated in art with heavenly clouds. It connotes healing, protection and fulfillment. It appears in celebrations of the attainment of new career heights. The sweeping curved roof of the adjoining mall culminates in a colossal ruyi that shades pedestrians. Each ruyi ornament on the exterior of the Taipei 101 tower stands at least tall.

At night the bright yellow gleam from its pinnacle casts Taipei 101 in the role of a candle or torch upholding the ideals of liberty and welcome. From 6 to 10 p.m., the tower&#x27;s lights display one of seven colors, according to a weekly schedule.

From 26 February to 6 March 2022, the typical colors were replaced by blue and yellow in solidarity with Ukraine, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The adjoining Taipei 101 on the east side connects the landmark further with the symbolism of time. The design of the circular park doubles as the face of a giant sundial. The tower itself casts the shadow to mark afternoon hours for the building&#x27;s occupants. The park&#x27;s design is echoed in a clock that stands at its entrance. The clock runs on wind power drawn from the building&#x27;s wind shear.

Taipei 101, like many of its neighboring buildings, exemplifies the influence of &quot;feng shui&quot; philosophy. An example appears in the form of a large granite fountain at the intersection of Songlian Road and Xinyi Road near the tower&#x27;s east entrance. A ball at the fountain&#x27;s top spins toward the tower. As a work of public art the fountain offers a contrast to the tower in texture even as its design echoes the tower&#x27;s rhythms. The fountain also serves a practical function in &quot;feng shui&quot; philosophy. A &quot;T&quot; intersection near the entrance of a building represents a potential drain of positive energy, or &quot;ch&#x27;i&quot;, from the structure and its occupants. Placing flowing water at such spots is thought to help redirect the flow of &quot;ch&#x27;i&quot;.

===Interior===
Two restaurants have opened on the 85th floor: Diamond Tony&#x27;s, which offers European-style seafood and steak, and 85TD, which offers Chinese style cuisine. Occupying all of the 86th floor is Taiwanese high-class buffet restaurant . Din Tai Fung, several international dining establishments and retail outlets also operate in the adjoining mall. The multistory retail mall adjoining the tower is home to hundreds of fashionable stores, restaurants, clubs and other attractions. The mall&#x27;s interior is modern in design even as it makes use of traditional elements. The curled &quot;ruyi&quot; symbol is a recurring motif inside the mall. Many features of the interior also observe &quot;feng shui&quot; traditions.

====Floor directory====

A tenant directory is posted in the first floor&#x27;s lobby (visible from the Xinyi entrance). The number 4 is considered an unlucky number in Chinese culture, so instead the 44th floor is renamed the 43rd, and the actual 43rd floor becomes 42A. As of 1 January 2011, the highest occupied office floor (excluding the observatory and restaurants) was 75. The building appears to be at least 70% occupied at this point. The 92nd through 100th floors are officially designated as communication floors, although it is unknown if there are any radio or TV stations currently broadcasting from the top of Taipei 101. The 101st floor indoor/outdoor rooftop observatory opened to the public on 14 June 2019. The top 92-100 floors are labeled as communications floors.

=== Elevator ===

The double-deck elevators built by the Japanese Toshiba Elevator and Building Systems Corporation (TELC) set a new record in 2004 with the fastest ascending speeds in the world. At per hour, per second, or 1,010 m/min, the speed of Taipei 101&#x27;s elevators is 34.7% faster than the previous record holders of the Yokohama Landmark Tower elevator, Yokohama, Japan, which reaches speeds of per second (45 km/h, 28 mph). Taipei 101&#x27;s elevators transport visitors from the fifth floor to the 89th-floor observatory in 37 seconds. Each elevator features an aerodynamic body, full pressurization, state-of-the art emergency braking systems, and the world&#x27;s first triple-stage anti-overshooting system. The cost for each elevator is NT$80 million (US$2.4 million). In 2016, the title for the fastest elevator was taken away by the Shanghai Tower in Shanghai. Shortly after, the title for the world&#x27;s fastest elevator was passed on yet again to the Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre.

===Artworks===

Many works of art appear in and around Taipei 101. These include: German artist Rebecca Horn&#x27;s &quot;Dialog between Yin and Yang&quot; in 2002 (steel, iron), American artist Robert Indiana&#x27;s &quot;1-0&quot; in 2002 and &quot;Love&quot; in 2003 (aluminum), French artist Ariel Moscovici&#x27;s &quot;Between Earth and Sky&quot; in 2002 (rose de la claret granite), Taiwanese artist Chung Pu&#x27;s &quot;Global Circle&quot; In 2002 (black granite, white marble), British artist Jill Watson&#x27;s &quot;City Composition&quot; in 2002 (Bronze), and Taiwanese artist Kang Mu Hsiang&#x27;s &quot;Infinite Life&quot; in 2013 (aluminum). Moreover, the Indoor Observatory hosts a regular series of exhibitions. The artists represented have included Wu Ching (gold sculpture), Ping-huang Chang (traditional painting) and Po-lin Chi (aerial photography).

==Floor plan==

===Observation deck===
Taipei 101 features an indoor observation deck on the 88th and 89th floors, and two outdoor observation decks (91st floor and 101st floor), all offering 360-degree views and attract visitors from around the world. The Indoor Observatory stands above ground, offering a comfortable environment, large windows with UV protection, recorded voice tours in eight languages, and informative displays and special exhibits. Here, one may view the skyscraper&#x27;s main damper, which is the world&#x27;s largest and heaviest visible damper, and buy food, drinks and gift items. Two more flights of stairs take visitors up to the Outdoor Observatory. The Outdoor Observatories, at and above ground, is the second-highest observation deck ever provided in a skyscraper and the highest such platform in Taiwan.

The Indoor Observatory is open thirteen hours a day (9:00 am–10:00 pm) throughout the week as well as on special occasions; the Outdoor Observatory is open during the same hours as weather permits. Tickets may be purchased on site in the shopping mall (5th floor) or in advance through the Observatory&#x27;s website and allow access to the 88th through 91st floors via high-speed elevator.

In 2019, its 101 top floor opened for the first time to the public, starting 14 June with only 36 people given access each day. The 91st-floor observatory used to be the highest floor that open to the public until 14 June 2019 when it was announced by the building&#x27;s management team that the 101st floor (at 460 meters above sea level) will be opened to the general public, with a quota of 36 people per day and is subject to prior booking. Going onto the outdoor viewing platform requires safety equipment, such as a safety belt buckled to the railing.

==Awards==

On its opening date, Taipei 101 was awarded the Emporis Skyscraper Award, coming in 1st place. Taipei 101 was awarded the top award platinum rating, by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), the globally recognized green building ranking system of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), making the skyscraper the tallest energy conservation building in the world. In 2017, Taipei 101 was awarded the Asia Responsible Entrepreneurship Award (AREA). Taipei 101 was awarded the CTBUH Skyscraper Award on the Performance award category.

<text>This article lists political parties in Norway.

Norway has a multi-party system with numerous political parties, in which no party can easily gain a majority of the 169 legislative seats. Parties may cooperate to form coalition governments.

==History==

===1884–1905===
The oldest political party in Norway is the Liberal Party, which was formed in 1884. Shortly afterwards, the Conservative Party was formed in opposition. The main political cleavage at the time was the issue of parliamentarism, with Liberals in favor and Conservatives in opposition. Until 1903, Norway was, for all intents and purposes, a two-party system; the smaller Moderate Liberal Party joined the Conservatives in a &quot;de facto&quot; permanent electoral coalition from the 1891 election.

===1905–1945===
During the first years of the 20th century, major electoral shifts took place. In 1903, the leftist Labour Party gained its first five MPs, after having captured 10% of the national vote. For the 1921 elections, the former two-round, single-member district system was replaced with proportional representation, allowing for further gains for medium-sized parties such as Labour and the Farmers&#x27; Party, which had been formed the previous year. In 1927, Labour surged to first place nationally, a position it has held in every single election since then. In 1928, they formed their first government, ending the decades-long power-alteration between Liberals and Conservatives. This government, headed by Christopher Hornsrud, was short-lived, however; it lasted a mere 18 days. The Farmers&#x27; Party followed suit, sitting in government briefly from 1931 to 1933, under Peder Kolstad and Jens Hundseid. Despite the surge of previously minor parties, the Liberals and Conservatives retained significance, with Johan Ludwig Mowinckel (1933–1935) serving as the last Liberal prime minister to date. With the onset of World War II, Johan Nygaardsvold from the Labour Party served as &quot;de jure&quot; prime minister for a decade, from 1935 to 1945.

During the Nazi occupation of Norway, political opposition to the collaborationist regime of Vidkun Quisling and the Nasjonal Samling party was silenced and prosecuted; Nygaardsvold&#x27;s cabinet went into exile in London in 1940, and did not return before 1945.

===1945–2001===
From the first post-war elections in 1945 until the 1961 elections, the Labour Party held an absolute majority in parliament, with its Einar Gerhardsen serving as prime minister for, in total, 17 years and 17 days. For most of this period, Norway was generally regarded as a dominant-party system, with the divided opposition, consisting of Liberals, Conservatives, Centrists, Christian Democrats and occasionally Communists, unable to match Labour. It was first in 1963, in the aftermath of the Kings Bay Affair, that the Conservative John Lyng was able to take power with support from the other non-socialist groups. With the gradual decline of the Labour Party, opposition figures such as Per Borten (Centrist), Lars Korvald (Christian Democrat) and Kåre Willoch served as prime ministers at various points during the latter half of the 20th century. 1973 saw the advent of anti-establishment parties such as Anders Lange&#x27;s Party and the Socialist Electoral League, which would later become the right-wing Progress Party and Socialist Left, respectively. Both of these groups remained relatively isolated on the political scene for the subsequent decades; the Socialist Left did not enter government before 2005, while the Progress Party was not included in a centre-right pact before in 2013.

===2001–present day===
The parliamentary election in 2001 saw the collapse of the Labour Party&#x27;s traditionally constantly large lead over non-socialist parties; they took a mere 24% of votes – a loss of 11 points – against 21% for the Conservatives of Jan Petersen. The short-lived Cabinet Stoltenberg I, a Labour government in office since 2000, stepped down in favor of a centre-right coalition of Liberals, Conservatives and Christian Democrats, led by the latter&#x27;s Kjell Magne Bondevik. Following the 2005 election, the centre-left Red-Green Coalition won a majority in parliament, with Jens Stoltenberg returning as prime minister, and serving until 2013.

The 2013 election provided the bloc of the Conservative Erna Solberg a clear parliamentary majority, with 96 of the 169 seats in parliament. She formed a government with the Progress Party of Siv Jensen, breaking the latter&#x27;s decades-long isolation from the other centre-right parties. Four years later, the centre-right parties managed to retain the majority in parliament with 88 of the 169 seats. Solberg continued to serve as prime minister, with different combinations of government coalition partners, all four parties at some time were part of Solberg Cabinet. In the most recent election of 2021, the result swung in strong favour of the centre-left parties who gathered 100 of 169 seats in the Storting. This led to a new government with Jonas Gahr Støre as prime minister, consisting of the Labour party and the Centre party.

<text>Kimaris, also known by the alternate names Cimeies, Cimejes and Cimeries, is most widely known as the 66th demon of the first part of the &quot;Lemegeton&quot; (popularly known as the &quot;Ars Goetia&quot;).

==Description==

He is described in the &quot;Lemegeton&quot; as a godly warrior riding a black horse, and possesses the abilities of locating lost or hidden treasures, teaching trivium (grammar, logic and rhetoric) and making a man into a warrior of his own likeness. He holds the rank of marquis, and is served by 20 legions. Much the same description is found in the earlier text of Johann Weyer&#x27;s catalog of demons, &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; (published 1563). Earlier still is the &quot;Munich Handbook of Necromancy&quot; (Clm 849) which lists an entity named Tuvries with much the same characteristics, except that he has 30 legions of servitors, and can cause a person to cross seas and rivers quickly.

==Other mentions==

Kimaris, as Cimeries, is also found on Anton LaVey&#x27;s list of infernal names, although it is not known why LaVey chose Kimaris as one of the comparatively few Goetic daimons included. Aleister Crowley, in &quot;777,&quot; gives Kimaris the Hebrew spelling KYMAVR and attributes him to the four of disks and the third decan of Capricorn by night. KYMAVR may allude to &quot;Khem-our&quot; (black light), a form of Horus mentioned in H. P. Blavatsky&#x27;s &quot;Secret Doctrine&quot;. In &quot;Sepher Sephiroth&quot;, he is listed as KYTzAVR, with a gematria of 327, although KYMAVR=277.

In British Library Harley MS 6482, entitled &quot;The Rosie Crucian Secrets&quot;, Thomas Rudd lists Cimeries as the 26th spirit made use of by King Solomon. He also attributes an angel Cimeriel to one of Dee&#x27;s Enochian Ensigns of Creation, the tablet of 24 mansions. The earliest mention of Chamariel is in Rossi&#x27;s &quot;Gnostic tractate&quot;. It is probable that the earliest mention of Kimaris is also Coptic, found in the London oriental mss 6796 where the name &quot;Akathama Chamaris&quot; appears. In this text, the entity in question does not appear to be evil; rather, he is addressed as a godlike helping spirit.

==Derivation of the name==

Wade Baskin&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Satanism&quot; speculates that Cimeries is derived from Cimmerians, a warlike people mentioned in the works of several classical authors as dwelling totally in darkness.

==In popular culture==
* In the anime series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans&quot;, a prominent mobile suit is known as &quot;ASW-G-66 Gundam Kimaris&quot;.

* In the book &quot;Carl&#x27;s Doomsday Scenario&quot;, the second installment of the sci-fi/fantasy series &quot;Dungeon Crawler Carl&quot; by Matt Dinniman, the eponymous character, Carl, obtains a plush doll bearing the name and likeness of Kimaris.

* In the anime and manga series Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun, there is a student council member named Kimaris Quichelight based on the demon of the same name.

<text>In mathematics, the Liouville–Neumann series is a function series that results from applying the resolvent formalism to solve Fredholm integral equations in Fredholm theory.

==Definition==
The Liouville–Neumann series is defined as
:formula_1
which, provided that formula_2 is small enough so that the series converges, is the unique continuous solution of the Fredholm integral equation of the second kind,

If the &quot;n&quot;th iterated kernel is defined as &quot;n&quot;−1 nested integrals of &quot;n&quot; operator kernels ,
:formula_3
then
:formula_4
with
:formula_5
so &quot;K&quot;0 may be taken to be , the kernel of the identity operator.

The resolvent, also called the &quot;solution kernel&quot; for the integral operator, is then given by a generalization of the geometric series,
:formula_6
where &quot;K&quot;0 is again .

The solution of the integral equation thus becomes simply
:formula_7

Similar methods may be used to solve the Volterra integral equations.

<text>A meme pool is the sum total of all memes (transmittable units of cultural ideas, practices, symbols) present in a given human population. The term is analogous to gene pool. The meme pool is in essence the matrix of the whole of the culture of a population. Because the memes of instruction of production of material culture are included, then the entire culture, including material culture and interactions between individuals is determined by information held within the meme pool. The state of a meme pool determines what sort of memes will be reproductive, and in this way it may be thought of as the meme-logical environment. 

Examples of meme pools may include large Internet communities such as imageboards, online forums, and wikis. More tangibly, large shopping malls, schools, and other social institutions may be included in the definition of a meme pool.

The term was coined by Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene.

<text>The great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus) is a member of the grebe family of water birds. The bird is characterised by its distinctive appearance, featuring striking black, orange-brown, and white plumage, and elaborate courtship display that involves synchronised dances and displays.

==Taxonomy==
The great crested grebe was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Colymbus cristatus&quot;. It is now the type species of the genus &quot;Podiceps&quot; that was erected by the English naturalist John Latham in 1787. The type locality is Sweden. The scientific name comes from Latin: the genus name &quot;Podiceps&quot; is from , &quot;vent&quot; and , &quot;foot&quot;, and is a reference to the placement of a grebe&#x27;s legs towards the rear of its body; the specific name, &quot;cristatus&quot;, means &quot;crested&quot;.

===Subspecies===
Three subspecies are currently accepted:
== Description ==

The great crested grebe is the largest species of grebe in the Old World, though some larger species occur in the Americas. They measure long with a wingspan and weigh . It is an excellent swimmer and diver, and pursues its fish prey underwater. The adults are unmistakable in summer with head and neck decorations. In winter, this is whiter than most grebes, with white above the eye, and a pink bill. Birds resident in warmer tropical and subtropical regions (particularly in subspecies &quot;P. c. infuscatus&quot; and &quot;P. c. australis&quot;) such as Kenya and parts of Australia retain breeding plumage all or almost all of the year, with reduced or no winter plumage.

The call is a loud barking &quot;rah-rah-rah&quot;. They can also produce a clicking &quot;kek&quot; call, and deep growls.

The chicks, like most grebe chicks, have boldly striped heads, with alternating black and white stripes; they are often colloquially called &quot;humbugs&quot; from their resemblance to humbug sweets. They lose these markings as they mature during their first winter.

== Distribution ==
The great crested grebe breeds in vegetated areas of freshwater lakes. The subspecies &quot;P. c. cristatus&quot; is found across Europe and east across the Palearctic. It is resident in the milder west of its range, but migrates from the colder regions. It winters on freshwater lakes and reservoirs or the coast. The African subspecies &quot;P. c. infuscatus&quot; and the Australasian subspecies &quot;P. c. australis&quot; are mainly sedentary.

== Behaviour ==
===Breeding===
The great crested grebe has an elaborate mating display. Like all grebes, it nests on the water&#x27;s edge. The nest is built by both sexes. The clutch averages four chalky-white eggs which average in size and in weight. Incubation is by both parents and begins as soon as the first egg is laid. The eggs hatch asynchronously after 27 to 29 days. The precocial young are cared for and fed by both parents.

Young grebes are capable of swimming and diving almost at hatching. The adults teach these skills to their young by carrying them on their back and diving, leaving the chicks to float on the surface; they then re-emerge a few feet away so that the chicks may swim back onto them.

===Feeding===
The great crested grebe feeds mainly on fish, but also small crustaceans, insects, small frogs and newts.

==Relationship to humans==

This species was hunted almost to extinction in the United Kingdom in the 19th century for its head plumes, which were used to decorate ladies&#x27; hats and garments. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds was set up to help protect this species, which is again a common sight.

The great crested grebe and its behaviour was the subject of one of the landmark publications in avian ethology, Julian Huxley&#x27;s 1914 paper on &quot;The Courtship‐habits of the Great Crested Grebe (&quot;Podiceps cristatus&quot;)&quot;.

Conservation efforts have been taking place on New Zealand&#x27;s Lake Wānaka since 2013.

In November 2023, the comedian John Oliver highlighted New Zealand&#x27;s Bird of the Year campaign in a &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot; episode and declared himself the &quot;campaign manager&quot; for the bird, which is also known in New Zealand by its Māori name . The bird was announced as the winner of the competition with the alliteration &quot;Pūteketeke pandemonium prevails&quot;.

<text>The red-necked grebe (Podiceps grisegena) is a migratory aquatic bird found in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. Its wintering habitat is largely restricted to calm waters just beyond the waves around ocean coasts, although some birds may winter on large lakes. Grebes prefer shallow bodies of fresh water such as lakes, marshes or fish-ponds as breeding sites.

The red-necked grebe is a fairly drab dusky-grey bird in winter. During the breeding season, it acquires the distinctive red neck plumage, black cap and contrasting pale grey face from which its name was derived. It also has an elaborate courtship display and a variety of loud mating calls. Once paired, it builds a nest from water plants on top of floating vegetation in a shallow lake or bog.

Like all grebes, the red-necked is a good swimmer and particularly swift diver, and responds to danger by diving rather than flying. The feet are positioned far back on the body, near the tail, which makes the bird ungainly on land. It dives for fish or picks insects off vegetation; it also swallows its own feathers, possibly to protect the digestive system. The conservation status of its two subspecies, &quot;P. g. grisegena&quot;, found in Europe and western Asia, and the larger &quot;P. g. holbolii&quot; (sometimes called Holbøll&#x27;s grebe), found in North America and eastern Siberia, is evaluated as Least Concern, and the global population is stable or growing.

==Taxonomy==
The red-necked grebe was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1781 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot;. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Colymbus grisegena&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The type locality was subsequently designated as France. The red-necked grebe is now placed in the genus &quot;Podiceps&quot; that was described by the English naturalist John Latham in 1787. The genus name &quot;Podiceps&quot; comes from Latin &quot;podicis&quot;, &quot;vent&quot; or &quot;anus&quot;, and &quot;pes&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;, and is a reference to the placement of a grebe&#x27;s legs towards the rear of its body. The species name &quot;grisegena&quot; is from Latin &quot;griseus&quot; (grey) and &quot;gena&quot; (cheek) and refers to the grey cheeks of the breeding adult.

Grebes are small to medium-large water birds with lobed, rather than webbed, toes. There are several genera, of which the most widespread is &quot;Podiceps&quot; with nine species, one recently extinct. The closest relative of the red-necked grebe is the fish-eating great crested grebe of Europe and western Asia. It is possible that the red-necked grebe originally evolved in North America and later spread to Europe, where a change of diet to include more insects helped to reduce competition with its larger cousin. Fossils of the species dating to the middle Pleistocene have been found in Italy.

==Description==
The red-necked grebe is a medium-large grebe, smaller than the great crested grebe of Eurasia, and the western and Clark&#x27;s grebes of North America, but noticeably larger than other northern grebe species. In breeding plumage, it has a black cap that extends below the eye, very pale grey cheeks and throat, a rusty red neck, dark grey back and flanks, and white underparts. The eyes are dark brown and the long, pointed bill is black with a yellow base. 
The winter plumage of the red-necked grebe is duskier than that of other grebes; its dark grey cap is less defined, and merges into the grey face, and a pale crescent that curves around the rear of the face contrasts with the rest of the head. The front of the neck is whitish or light grey, the hind neck is darker grey, and the yellow of the bill is less obvious than in summer. Although the red-necked grebe is unmistakable in breeding plumage, it is less distinctive in winter and can be confused with similar species. It is larger than the Slavonian (horned) grebe, with a relatively larger bill and a grey, rather than white face. It is closer in size to the Eurasian great crested grebe, but that species is longer-necked, has a more contrasting head pattern, and always shows white above the eye.

The sexes are similar in appearance, although the male averages heavier than the female. Chicks have a striped head and breast, and older juveniles have a striped face, diffuse blackish cap, pale red neck and extensive yellow on the bill.

The red-necked grebe flies with its long neck extended and its large feet trailing behind the body, which gives it a stretched-out appearance. The relatively small wings are grey with white secondaries, and beat very rapidly. Its small wing area means that the grebe is unable to take off from land, and needs a lengthy run across water to gain the speed needed for take-off. Like all grebes, the red-necked is an expert swimmer; it uses its feet for propulsion underwater, and steers by rotating its legs, since its tail is too short for this purpose.

This is one of the most vocal grebes during the breeding season, but, like its relatives, it is mainly silent for the rest of the year. It has a loud, wailing or howling display call &quot;uooooh&quot;, given by a single bird or a pair in duet, by night or during the day, and often from cover. Long sequences of up to 60 consecutive notes may be delivered during singing encounters between rival territorial birds. A great variety of quacking, clucking, hissing, rattling and purring calls are also given, with much individual variation.

===Subspecies===
There are currently two accepted subspecies:

Holbøll&#x27;s grebe was named after the Danish explorer of Greenlandic birds Carl Peter Holbøll. As Holbøll was Danish, under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature Article 32.5.2.1, scientific names derived from his name treat the ø/ö as &#x27;o&#x27;, rather than &#x27;oe&#x27; had it been derived from a German name, thus the correct spelling of the subspecies is &quot;Podiceps grisegena holbollii&quot;, and not &quot;holboellii&quot; as formerly often cited. The east Asian birds are in some aspects intermediate, with slightly smaller bills than the American birds, although the differences are too small to merit separation as a third subspecies. The difference in size between the sexes is slightly larger for this subspecies than for &quot;P. g. grisegena&quot;.

Transatlantic vagrancy of both subspecies is known, with two records of nominate &quot;P. g. grisegena&quot; in Greenland, and 12 records of &quot;P. g. holbollii&quot; in Europe, half of them in Iceland, and the rest shared between Scotland (two), Norway, Sweden, France, and Spain.

==Distribution and habitat==
Breeding takes place in shallow freshwater lakes, bays of larger lakes, marshes, and other inland bodies of water, often less than in extent and less than deep. The red-necked grebe shows a preference for waters in forested areas or, further north, in shrub tundra, and favours sites with abundant emergent vegetation, such as reedbeds. The best breeding habitat is fish-ponds, which have an abundance of food in addition to meeting the other requirements. The American subspecies is less tied to a high aquatic plant density, and sometimes breeds on quite open lakes.

All populations are migratory and winter mainly at sea, usually in estuaries and bays, but often well offshore where fish are within diving reach near shallow banks or islands. The preferred passage and wintering habitat is water less than deep with a sand or gravel bottom, scattered rocks and patches of seaweed. During winter, birds typically feed alone and rarely aggregate into flocks, but on migration, concentrations of over 2000 individuals may occur at favoured staging sites. Migration is usually at night, but may occur during the day, especially when over water. This is particularly noticeable in autumn on the Great Lakes, when up to 18,000 birds may pass Whitefish Point on Lake Superior; these are thought to be Canadian breeders heading for the Atlantic Ocean to winter. This easterly route is longer than that to the Pacific, but avoids the Rockies.

The breeding range of the red-necked grebe overlaps with that of the Slavonian grebe, although the latter species tends to be displaced from sites suited to both. The red-necked grebe prefers an inland temperate climate, and is less successful near coasts and in subarctic and warm temperate zones. It is usually a lowland bird, breeding below , although has nested at up to in Turkey.

The nominate subspecies breeds from southern Sweden and Denmark through central and eastern Europe east to western Siberia, and winters mainly in the North and Baltic Seas, with smaller numbers in the Adriatic, Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Mediterranean and on inland lakes. &quot;P. g. holbolii&quot; breeds in North America in Alaska, western and central Canada, and the northern US east to Minnesota; in Asia it nests in eastern Siberia from Kamchatka south to Hokkaido and west to Mongolia. The Asian birds winter at sea from Japan to the East China Sea, and American breeders winter in the Pacific, mainly from southern Alaska to British Columbia (with smaller numbers south to California), and in the Atlantic from Newfoundland and Labrador to Florida. Some birds remain on the Great Lakes if they are sufficiently ice-free. This species occurs as a rare winter vagrant in Afghanistan, Pakistan and parts of northern and western India.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding and survival===

Red-necked grebes usually nest as isolated pairs with more than between neighbouring nests, although semi-colonial nesting may occur in suitable sites, where up to 20 pairs each defend a linear territory. Semi-colonial breeding is more likely to occur in prime locations, such as large floating mats of vegetation with no connection to the shoreline. Such sites, safe from most predators and large enough to provide some wind and wave protection, have grebes nesting much closer than shoreline breeders, down to . Pairs nesting in these colonies produce larger clutches of eggs, which hatch earlier in the season and result in larger broods. The territory is defended with various threat displays, including wing-spreading, hunching, and bill-thrusting; pairs breeding in colonies are more aggressive, less likely to leave the nest unguarded and show a greater tendency to move out of sight of the colony when not incubating. Breeding is often in loose association with gulls or other colonial water birds. 

The monogamous pair forms in April or May on migration or at the breeding water, and a highly vocal courtship ritual commences. The elaborate breeding performance includes head-shaking, a head-lowered &quot;cat&quot; display, parallel rushes in an upright position and mutual presentations of green weeds, and culminates in a &quot;penguin&quot; dance in which pair members raise the whole body upright, breast to breast.

Like all grebes, the red-necked grebe nests near water into which it can escape, since the position of the legs far back on the body prevents fast movement on land. It often breeds further within reed beds than other grebes. The nest is a floating platform of plant matter anchored to submerged or emergent vegetation, in water deep, and with the bulk of nest below the water line. Egg-laying mainly takes place from mid-April to May in Europe, and somewhat later, from mid-May to June, in North America. Parents may leave the nest for significant periods of time during the night, possibly to evade nocturnal predators. It is unclear whether this is for self-protection or to protect the eggs by diverting attention from the nest; the clutch does not appear to suffer from this temporary abandonment, whatever the reason.

The red-necked grebe lays four or five (range one to nine) dull white or pale blue eggs, which average in breadth, in length, and weigh about , of which 10% is shell. Parents take turns to incubate the eggs for 21–33 days until the precocial downy chicks hatch; they immediately climb onto the parent&#x27;s back, where they spend most of their time until they are 10–17 days old. The young may be fed by the parents for up to 54 days after fledging, and can fly at 50–70 days. The parents do not interfere with the feeding of their chicks when they are still being carried. Later they care for the younger chicks for longer, and are aggressive with the older offspring. This equalises the post-fledging survival of all chicks, and encourages their independence. The brood may be split, so that each parent feeds only some of the chicks. This spreads the feeding demand equally between the parents.

After breeding the adults moult their wing feathers and are temporarily flightless; migration commences once the flight feathers have regrown. The red-necked grebe is normally single-brooded, although second broods and re-nesting after a clutch has been lost may extend nesting into July or August.

Eggs may be destroyed and chicks killed by a range of predators, including the raccoon in North America and the carrion crow in Europe. Pike may take swimming chicks. On average, for each adult, 0.65 young birds are still alive by their fourth month, although the mortality rate for the adult is unknown. Red-necked grebes attempt to evade birds of prey by diving; when feeding, dives average less than 30 seconds, although escape dives are more prolonged.

===Feeding===

On the breeding grounds, the red-necked grebe feeds mainly on invertebrates including adult and larval aquatic insects, such as water beetles and dragonfly larvae, crayfish and molluscs. Fish (such as smelt) may be important locally or seasonally, especially for the American subspecies, and crustaceans can constitute up to 20% of the grebe&#x27;s diet. Birds breeding at the coast often make foraging flights to inland lakes or offshore areas to feed.

Aquatic prey is obtained by diving or by swimming on surface with the head submerged, and terrestrial insects and their larvae are picked off vegetation. A line slanting downward from the eye to the tip of the opened lower mandible may be used for sighting on prey before diving or when swimming under water. The grebe probably opens its bill and looks down the eye-line toward its target.
European breeders, which have to compete with the larger great crested grebe for fish, eat a greater proportion of invertebrates than the longer-billed American subspecies, although both races eat mainly fish in winter. Birds of the nominate subspecies from the northernmost breeding populations in Finland and Russia, beyond the range of great crested grebe, have a longer and more slender bill than those further south, reflecting a greater proportion of fish in the diet where their main competitor is absent. If food is scarce, parents may desert unhatched eggs, or allow the smallest chicks to starve, although the latter strategy appears not to be particularly efficient in protecting the older chicks.

Like other grebes, the red-necked grebe ingests large quantities of its own feathers, which remain in the bird&#x27;s stomach. Feathers are not only swallowed by adults, mainly during self-preening, but are often fed to the young, sometimes within a day of hatching. These feathers soon decompose into a felt-like, amorphous mass. The function of the feathers in the stomach is unknown, although it has been suggested that they help to protect the lower digestive tract from bones and other hard, indigestible material.

==Status==

The red-necked grebe has a large range, estimated at 1–10 million square kilometres (0.4–3.8 million square miles), and a global population of 150,000–370,000 individuals, with &quot;P. g. holbollii&quot; about twice as numerous as the nominate race. The population trend has not been quantified, but it is not believed to meet the thresholds for the population decline criterion (declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations) of the IUCN Red List. For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.

The red-necked grebe is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. Parties to the Agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies which are describes in a detailed action plan. The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation.

The red-necked grebe was hunted by humans in northern Europe in the Mesolithic and Paleolithic periods, but there is no evidence that there is any significant level of hunting at the present time. In North America, there are potential threats from pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides such as DDT which cause reduced reproductive success due to egg sterility and eggshell thinning. Breeding areas may be threatened by the modification and degradation of lakes and by human disturbance from water-based recreational activities. There is no evidence to suggest that these threats could result in a significant risk to the overall population; more than 70% of North American red-necked grebes breed in Canada, where the population is stable or increasing.

<text>The horned grebe or Slavonian grebe (Podiceps auritus) is a relatively small and threatened species of waterbird in the family Podicipedidae. There are two subspecies, &quot;P. a. auritus&quot; (Slavonian grebe), which breeds in Eurasia, and &quot;P. a. cornutus&quot; (horned grebe), which breeds in North America. The Eurasian subspecies is distributed over most of northern Europe and northern Asia, breeding from Iceland east to the Russian Far East. The North American subspecies spans most of Canada and some of the United States. A small population was cited in Greenland in 1973, but is not mapped or further mentioned by subsequent authors.

The American name &#x27;horned&#x27; refers to the orange-yellow crest feathers located above and behind the eyes, called &quot;horns&quot;. The English name, originally &#x27;Sclavonian&#x27;, is first attested by George Montagu in his 1802 &quot;Ornithological Dictionary&quot;, from &quot;Sclavonia&quot;, an old name for northern Prussia, referring to the species&#x27; main breeding area in Europe; the spelling was emended (without any reason given) to the current &#x27;Slavonian&#x27; by Hartert in 1912.

==Taxonomy==
The horned grebe was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Colymbus auritus&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Europe and America but this has been restricted to Vaasa in Finland. The horned grebe is now one of the nine species placed in the genus &quot;Podiceps&quot; that was introduced in 1787 by the English naturalist John Latham. The genus name combines the Latin &quot;podex&quot; meaning &quot;vent&quot; and &quot;pes&quot; meaning &quot;foot&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;auritus&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;-eared&quot; or &quot;long-eared&quot;, and the subspecific name &quot;cornutus&quot; means &quot;horned&quot;.

==Description==
The species can be recognised by its orange-red and black breeding plumage, its black and white non-breeding plumage, and its characteristic &quot;horns&quot;. It is long, has a wingspan wide and weighs . It has a moderately long neck, flat forehead and a rear crown of black feathers. Its beak is straight and pointed, with a white tip. 

The breeding plumage has bright erectable &quot;horns&quot;, black fan-shaped cheek feathers and an overall red-and-black colour. The neck, flanks, lores and upper-chest are chestnut brown, while the crown and back are black. The belly is a dull white. Males are slightly larger and brighter than females but are generally indistinguishable.

The non-breeding plumage is overall black and white. The neck, chest and cheeks are white, while the back and crown are a dull black-grey. The border between the crown and the cheeks extend in a straight line behind the eyes. The winter plumage does not have the &quot;horns&quot;.

Juveniles appear similar to a non-breeding adult except they are a slightly duller shade of white and their back is tinged with brown. The line separating the cheeks and crown is less distinct and their beak is paler. The chicks are fluffy, with a dull grey back, a white belly and distinct black-and-white facial and neck striping.

===Subspecies and distribution===
Two subspecies are accepted:
The subspecies are physically similar in measurements, but differ subtly in plumage, with &quot;P. a. auritus&quot; darker, having a blacker back and crown, and orange-yellow lateral crown tufts in breeding plumage; and &quot;P. a. cornuta&quot; paler, with greyer back and crown, and straw-yellow tufts.

A third subspecies &quot;P. a. arcticus&quot; has sometimes been accepted for the population in coastal Norway, Iceland, and Scotland, but is now treated as synonymous with nominate &quot;P. a. auritus&quot;.

In winter plumage, it is often confused with the black-necked grebe, which is only slightly smaller in size and has similar colouring but is differentiated by a steeper forehead, a more slender, slightly uptilted bill, duskier cheeks, and a fluffier rump.

=== Vocalisation ===
Young begin calling for begging purposes in a slightly trilled peeping noise, similar to that of a domestic chick. As they mature, their song changes to a more adult-like chittering. Their typical advertising call is loud and nasally &quot;aaarrh&quot; descending in a pitch and ending in a trill. They use other calls during copulation, alarm and breeding ceremonies that are slightly variable from the advertising call. Horned grebes are extremely vocal during breeding, territory establishment and defence. Their song is subdued during autumn migration and at wintering sites.

== Habitat ==

The species breeds primarily in boreal and subarctic regions with a frost-free period of around 90 days or less, but also in temperate zones, including prairies and parklands. They breed in small to moderately sized (0.5-10 ha) shallow freshwater ponds, marshes and shallow bays on lake edges with beds of emergent vegetation. They prefer lakes less than 2.5 m deep, with submerged vegetation, rather than bare gravel, silt or mud lakefloors, and marginal vegetation with sedgess, rushes, and bulrushes along with large areas of open water. This habitat provides a suitable site for nest material, anchorage, concealment and protection for young. It readily uses lakes surrounded by trees or forest.

During migration, they will stop along lakes, rivers and marshes. Following migration, they winter in marine environments, including off estuaries and bays or sandy beaches; in some places, for example in Norway, large numbers congregate on inland lakes.

== Behaviour ==
=== Food and feeding ===
Horned grebes dive underwater using their large feet for agile manoeuvrability to feed on aquatic arthropods, fish and crustaceans. They will also catch airborne insects on the water&#x27;s surface. Underwater they swallow or capture large prey and re-emerging at the surface to manipulate the fish headfirst. They usually feed solitarily or in small groups of up to five individuals. During the summer, aquatic and airborne arthropods are preferred, whereas winter selection favours fish and crustaceans.

The horned grebe has a unique adaptation for swallowing fish whole. They will eat their own feathers from a young age, so that their stomach has a matted plug that functions as a filter to hold fish bones until digestion.

=== Breeding ===

Horned grebes are monogamous and develop their relationship through elaborate mating routines. There are four pair bonding ceremonies; discovery ceremony, weed ceremony, head-shaking ceremony and triumph ceremony. The discovery ceremony begins with advertising displays, which include an upright posture, erect &quot;horns&quot; and sounding of their advertising call. Then, both male and female engage in bouts of penguin dance and preening. This initial pair bonding ceremony is to ensure correct species identification, sex and compatibility. The weed ceremony follows the completion of a successful discovery ceremony. The male and female will dive, retrieve weeds and rise in synchronisation. The pair will come breast-to-breast with their weeds then turn side by side to continue swimming. This weed-rush can continue multiple times until both individuals are satisfied. Finally, the head-shaking ceremony and triumph ceremony are performed for primarily established pairs. Once copulation is to take place, it always occurs on a platform nest built by the pair.

Horned grebes usually arrive at breeding grounds in pairs or solitarily to seek out a mate in the spring or early summer. A pair may nest entirely alone or in a loose colony that typically contains approximately 20 breeding pairs, each pair nesting some distance from the others. During nesting, horned grebes are known to defend their nests very aggressively. Nests are built from plant matter and are most commonly affixed to emergent vegetation otherwise built on land or in shallow open water. Depending on location the eggs are laid between April and September, with June being the most common month. The females lays a single clutch of three to eight eggs, which are coloured white, brownish or blueish green. These eggs measure on average. Both males and females share incubation time for 22 to 25 days. When the young hatch, they can swim and dive within the first few days, although they must be kept warm by their parents for up to 14 days. During this time, the juvenile chicks can often be seen riding on the backs of their swimming parents right in-between the wing and the back. Later the horned grebe will take their first flight at 55–60 days old. The species finally reaches sexual maturity at two years old.

== Conservation status ==
The total North American population is estimated at between 200,000 and 500,000 individuals and the Eurasian population at 12,900 to 18,500 mature individuals. The global population has declined by 30% over the last three decades and by 79% within North America. This is due primarily to human disturbance, forestry operations around breeding sites, fluctuating water levels, and stocking of lakes with rainbow trout that compete for aquatic insects. They are also frequently caught in nets, vulnerable to oil spills and diseases. Between 1985 and 2001, grassland and wetland drainage amounted to 5% global habitat loss. The western Canadian population is listed as being of special concern and the breeding population on Magdalen Islands is listed as endangered. Due to global declines, the International Union for Conservation of Nature uplisted the status from least concern to vulnerable in 2015, resulting in conservation and research action plans. The small population in northern Scotland is in severe decline, with only 26 pairs in 2021, a decline of 58% over the previous 26 years.

==Fossils==
A handful of fossil species, such as the Pliocene aged &quot;P. howardae&quot;, &quot;P. pisanus&quot; and &quot;P. solidus&quot;, and the Pleistocene aged &quot;P. dixi&quot; have been described to be related to or perhaps some of them might be pre-Holocene material of the horned grebe. However while &quot;P. howardae&quot; and &quot;P. dixi&quot; are regularly recognized as fossil material of the horned grebe by some authors, &quot;P. pisanus&quot; and &quot;P. solidus&quot; are argued to be valid species that are close to the ancestry of the horned grebe.

<doc id="203821" wikidata="Q185183" url="?curid=203821" title="Black-necked grebe">
<text>The black-necked grebe or eared grebe (Podiceps nigricollis) is a member of the grebe family of water birds. It was described in 1831 by Christian Ludwig Brehm. Its breeding plumage features distinctive ochre-coloured feathers which extend behind its eye and over its ear coverts. The rest of the upper parts, including the head, neck, and breast, are coloured black to blackish brown. The flanks are tawny rufous to maroon-chestnut, and the abdomen is white. In its non-breeding plumage, this bird has greyish-black upper parts, including the top of the head and a vertical stripe on the back of the neck. The flanks are also greyish-black. The rest of the body is a white or whitish colour. The juvenile has more brown in its darker areas. This species is present in parts of Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas.

The black-necked grebe uses multiple foraging techniques. Insects, which make up the majority of this bird&#x27;s diet, are caught either on the surface of the water or when they are in flight; this species occasionally practices foliage gleaning. This grebe dives to catch crustaceans, molluscs, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When moulting at saline lakes, this bird feeds mostly on brine shrimps. The black-necked grebe makes a floating cup nest on an open lake. The nest cup is covered with a disc. This nest is located both in colonies and by itself. During the breeding season, which varies depending on location, this species will lay one (sometimes two) clutch of three to four eggs. The number of eggs is sometimes larger due to conspecific brood parasitism. After a 21-day incubation period, the eggs hatch, and then the nest is deserted. After about 10 days, the parents split up the chicks between themselves. After this, the chicks become independent in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.

Although it generally avoids flight, the black-necked grebe travels as far as during migration. In addition, it becomes flightless for at least a month after completing a migration to reach an area where it can moult safely. During this moult, the grebe can double in weight. The migration to reach these areas can be dangerous, sometimes with thousands of grebe deaths. In spite of this, it is classified as a least concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is likely that this is the most numerous grebe in the world. There are potential threats to it, such as oil spills, but these are not likely to present a major risk to the overall population.

==Taxonomy==
This species was first described by Carl Ludwig Hablitz in 1783 as &quot;Colymbus caspicus&quot;, from a bird in Bandar-e Anzali. This was originally thought to be a synonym for the horned grebe, until Erwin Stresemann discovered that the description applied more to the black-necked grebe in 1948. Before this, the earliest description was thought to be by Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1831, who gave this bird its current scientific name of &quot;Podiceps nigricollis&quot; from a German bird. To resolve this, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature suppressed the name &quot;Colymbus caspicus&quot;. The genus name &quot;Dytes&quot; is sometimes used for this species and its closest relatives, a placement which was preferred by Robert Ridgway in 1881.

This bird is closely related to the South American silvery grebe and Junin grebe. The extinct Colombian grebe &quot;P. andinus&quot; is particularly closely related, and is often considered to be a subspecies of &quot;P. nigricollis&quot;; it is genetically nested within it.

===Subspecies===
There are currently three accepted subspecies.

The generic name, &quot;Podiceps&quot;, comes from two Latin words: , meaning or , and meaning . This is a reference to the attachment point of the bird&#x27;s legs at the extreme back end of its body. The specific epithet &quot;nigricollis&quot; is Latin for : means and means . The subspecies epithet &quot;californicus&quot; comes from &quot;California&quot;, while &quot;gurneyi&quot; comes from the name of British ornithologist John Henry Gurney Sr.

&quot;Black-necked grebe&quot; has been designated the official name by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). Both common names for this species refer to features visible when the bird is in its breeding plumage; in such plumage, it has an all-black neck and a spray of golden plumes on each side of its head. The name &quot;eared grebe&quot; is nearly a century older than the name &quot;black-necked grebe&quot;. The latter was first used in 1912 by Ernst Hartert, in an effort to bring the common name of the species in line with its scientific name, and/or to avoid the long history of confusion between the vernacular name &quot;eared&quot; with the scientific name of the horned grebe &quot;Podiceps auritus&quot; (&quot;auritus&quot;, Latin, &#x27;eared&#x27;). The name &quot;eared grebe&quot; is still used in North America to refer to this bird.

==Description==
The black-necked grebe usually measures between in length and has a wingspan range of in &quot;P. n. nigricollis&quot;, and in &quot;P. n. californicus&quot;. It weighs , with males being on average heavier than females. The nominate subspecies in breeding plumage has the head, neck, breast, and upper parts coloured black to blackish brown, with the exception of the ochre-coloured fan of feathers extending behind the eye over the eye-coverts and sides of the nape. The eye is a vivid bright red, with a narrow and paler yellow ring on the inner parts of the eye and an orange-yellow to pinkish-red . The thin, upturned bill, on the other hand, is black, and is connected to the eye by a blackish line starting at the . Sometimes, the foreneck can be found to be mostly tinged brown. The is blackish to drab brown in colour and has a white patch formed by the secondaries and part of the inner primaries. The flanks are coloured tawny rufous to maroon-chestnut and have the occasional blackish fleck. The and abdomen is white, with an exception to the former being the dark tertials and the mostly pale grey-brown outer primaries. The legs are a dark greenish grey. The sexes are similar.

In non-breeding plumage, the nominate has greyish-black upper parts, cap, nape, and hindneck, with the colour on the upper portion of the latter being contained in a vertical stripe. The dark colour of the cap reaches below the eye and can be seen, diffused, to the ear-coverts. Behind the ear-coverts on the sides of the neck, there are white ovals. The rest of the neck is grey to brownish-grey in colour and has white that varies in amount. The breast is white, and the abdomen is whitish. The flanks are coloured in a mix of blackish-grey with white flecks. The colour of the bill when not breeding differs from that of the breeding plumage, with the former being significantly more grey.

The juvenile black-necked grebe is similar to the non-breeding adult. There are differences, however, including the fact that the dark areas are usually more brownish in the juvenile, with less black. The are often tinged pale grey, with whitish marks behind the eye. On the sides of the head and upper neck, there is a buffy or tawny tinge. The chick is downy and has a blackish-grey head with stripes and spots that are white or pale buff-grey. The throat and foreneck are largely pale. The upper parts are mostly dark grey in colour, and the abdomen is white.

The subspecies &quot;P. n. californicus&quot; usually has a longer bill compared to the nominate, and has brown-grey inner primaries during the breeding season. When not breeding, the nominate has diffuse and pale lores less often than &quot;P. n. californicus&quot;. The African subspecies &quot;P. n. gurneyi&quot; is the smallest of the three subspecies, in addition to having a greyer head and upper parts. The adult of this subspecies also has a rufous-brown tinge on its lesser wing-coverts.

===Vocalisations===
When breeding, the black-necked grebe gives a quiet &quot;ooeek&quot; that ascends in pitch from an already high pitch. This call is also used as a territorial call, in addition to a low and fast trill, which itself is also used during courtship. Another call is a short &quot;puuii&quot; or &quot;wit&quot;. This grebe is silent when it is not the breeding season and when it is feeding or resting.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species breeds in vegetated areas of freshwater lakes across temperate Europe, Asia, eastern and southern Africa, interior southwestern Canada, and the southwest and western United States. After breeding, this bird migrates to saline lakes to moult. Then, after completing the moult and waiting for sometimes several months, it migrates to winter in places such as the south-western Palearctic and the eastern parts of both Africa and Asia. It also winters in southern Africa, another place where it breeds. In the Americas, it winters as far south as Guatemala, and occasionally further south in Central America, although larger wintering populations there are mainly restricted to islands in the Gulf of California, the Salton Sea, and Baja California. When not breeding, its habitat is primarily saline lakes, sheltered inshore seas, and coastal estuaries.

== Behaviour ==
This grebe is highly gregarious, usually forming large colonies when breeding and large flocks when not.

===Breeding===
This species builds its floating nest in the usually shallow water of open lakes. The nest itself is anchored to the lake by plants. It is built by both the male and the female and made out of plant matter. Most of it is submerged, with the bottom of the shallow cup usually being level with the water. Above the cup, there is a flat disc. This grebe nests both in colonies and by itself. When it does not nest by itself, it will often nest in mixed-species colonies made up of black-headed gulls, ducks, and various other waterbirds. The space between the nests in these colonies is often . Whether it nests in colonies or not has an effect on the dimensions of the nest. When the bird is not in a colony, the nest has an average diameter of , although this can vary, with nests ranging from about to over . This is compared to nests in colonies, which have an average diameter of about . It is suggested that rarely some pairs of this grebe will steward over multiple nests when in colonies.

Pair formation in the black-necked grebe usually starts during pauses in the migration to the breeding grounds, although it occasionally occurs before, in wintering pairs. This pair formation continues after this grebe has arrived to its breeding grounds. Courtship occurs when it arrives at the breeding lake. The displays are performed in the middle of the lake. There is no territory involved in courting; individuals use the whole area of the lake. When advertising for a mate, a black-necked grebe will approach others of its species with its body fluffed out and its neck erect. It closes its beak to perform a call, &quot;poo-eee-chk&quot;, with the last note only barely audible. Courtship generally stops at the start of nesting.

In the Northern Hemisphere, this bird breeds from April to August. In east Africa, the breeding season is at least from January to February, while in southern Africa, the breeding season is from October to April.

The black-necked grebe is socially monogamous. Conspecific or intraspecific brood parasitism (dump nesting), where the female lays eggs in the nest of others of their own species is common with on average nearly 40% of nests being subjected to dump-nesting. In terms of territory, this grebe will defend only its nest site.

This grebe lays a clutch, sometimes two, of three to four chalky greenish or bluish eggs. Nests that have been subjected to dump-nesting will have two more eggs on average, even though the number the host lays is about the same no matter if it has been subjected to dump-nesting or not. The eggs, although initially immaculate, do get stained by plant matter that the nest is built out of. The eggs measure on average and are incubated by both parents for about 21 days. The laying date of the eggs is somewhat synchronised, with birds in small colonies having the laying dates spread out by just a few days, compared to large colonies, where the laying date is spread out over more than 10 days.

After the chicks hatch, the birds will desert their nest. Even though the young can swim and dive during this time, they rarely do, instead staying on the parents&#x27; backs for four days after hatching. This behaviour is present in all grebes, and is likely to have evolved because it reduces travel costs, specifically those back to the nest to brood the chicks and give them food. After about 10 days, the parents split the chicks up, with each parent taking care of about half of the brood. After this split, the chicks are independent in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.

When disturbed while incubating, this bird usually (just under 50% of the time) partly covers its eggs with nest material when the disruption is not sudden, but a bird with an incomplete clutch usually does not attempt to cover the eggs. When the disruption is sudden, on the other hand, the black-necked grebe usually (just under 50% of the time) does not cover its eggs. In comparison, other species of grebes cover up their eggs when leaving the nest. Predation is usually not the primary cause of egg loss, with most nesting failures occurring after the chicks have hatched. A major cause of this is the chilling of the young.

===Feeding===

The black-necked grebe forages mainly by diving from the water, with dives usually lasting less than 30 seconds. These dives are usually shorter in time when in more shallow water. In between dives, this grebe rests for an average of 15 seconds. When feeding on brine shrimps at hypersaline lakes, it likely uses its large tongue to block the oral cavity. It is suggested that it then crushes prey against its palate to remove excess water. It also forages by gleaning foliage, plucking objects off of the surface of water, having its head submerged while swimming, and sometimes capturing flying insects.

This grebe eats mostly insects, of both adult and larval stages, as well as crustaceans, molluscs, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When moulting at lakes with high salinity, however, this bird feeds mostly on brine shrimps. The behaviour of black-necked grebes changes in response to the availability of brine shrimps; bodies of water with more shrimps have more grebes, and grebes spend more time foraging when the number of shrimps and the water temperature decrease.

The young are fed one at a time by the parents, with one bird carrying the young while the other feeds it. The young take food by grabbing it, with their beaks, from their parents, or by grabbing food dropped into the water. When a young bird cannot grab the food, then the adults submerge their bill into the water and shake their bill to break up the food.

===Moult and migration===
When breeding is over, some black-necked grebes moult while still on the breeding grounds, but most do so only after a moult migration. This migration is to saline lakes, especially lakes with large numbers of invertebrate prey, so that birds can fatten up while moulting before continuing on the winter migration. The moult migration is dangerous, with hundreds and sometimes thousands of birds being killed by snowstorms when traveling to places such as Mono Lake.

After the moult migration, birds moult their remiges between August and September, which makes them unable to fly. The moult is preceded by an increase in weight. During the moult, the breast muscles atrophy. When the moult is completed, birds continue to gain weight, often more than doubling their original weight. This additional fat is used to power the black-necked grebe&#x27;s overnight fall migration to its wintering grounds. The fat is most concentrated in the abdomen, second most in the thorax, and least in the chest. Migration usually starts earlier when shrimps are more abundant and when the moulting lake is at a higher than average temperature. Birds generally leave on a clear night with lower than average surface temperatures.

===Movement===

This grebe is one of the most inefficient fliers among birds. Generally, it avoids flying at all costs and reserves long-distance flight exclusively for migration. This is combined with the fact that this bird is flightless for 35–40 days during its moult. However, when migrating, it travels as much as to reach rich feeding areas that are exploited by few other species. In flight, the shape of this grebe is like a loon: straight neck, legs trailing, and wings beating often.

When diving, this bird pulls its head back and then arches it forward into the water, with the body following and a slight springing. The legs start moving only after they are underwater. When swimming on the surface of the water, the body of this grebe is relatively high, although none of the underparts are seen. The neck is held straight up in a relaxed manner, with the bill being held forward and parallel to the water. Each of the feet perform strong alternating strokes.

==Disease==
Large-scale deaths (such as 150,000 birds on the Salton Sea in 1992) from erysipelas, avian cholera, avian botulism, and West Nile virus have been recorded in the past. In 2013, at the Great Salt Lake, for example, there was an outbreak of West Nile virus which caused one of the largest recorded avian die-offs in the US. The cause of the outbreak and modes of transmission are unknown, but there has been speculation about the latter. Since West Nile virus is able to survive in brine shrimps (and, for a temporary time, water at specific temperatures), it is likely that grebes could have become infected by eating diseased shrimps and/or swimming in the contaminated water. It is also suggested that West Nile virus could be transmitted among grebes through contact with the excrement of an infected bird, possibly around bodies of water, communal nest sites, areas of cohabitating birds, etc. Avian cholera, another disease that can cause massive die-offs in this species, is transmitted by currently-unknown biotoxins and/or pathogens, as well as problems with feather waterproofing putting birds at risk.

==Status==
As of 2016, the black-necked grebe is classified as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The trend of the population is uncertain, as some populations are decreasing, whereas others are stable, have an uncertain trend, or are increasing. The justification for the current classification of this species is its very large population (estimated around 3.9–4.2 million individuals) combined with a large estimated extent of occurrence (about 155 million km2 (60 million sq mi)). This grebe is probably the most numerous grebe in the world.

Unknown biotoxins, pathogens, and the impairment of feather waterproofing can lead to hypothermia and avian cholera. Since this grebe usually winters on the coast, it is also vulnerable to oil pollution. Large-scale disease, such as avian cholera, could threaten the species. These and other factors, such as human disturbance, including collisions with power transmission lines, contribute to declining populations in certain areas. This species used to be threatened in North America by the millinery industry, which helped facilitate the hunting of the birds, and egg collectors. Although this is true, this grebe is hunted in the Gilan Province in Iran, for both commercial and recreational purposes. However, there is no evidence suggesting that these threats could result in a significant risk for the overall population.

<text>The northern harrier (Circus hudsonius), also known as the marsh hawk or ring-tailed hawk, is a bird of prey. It breeds throughout the northern parts of the northern hemisphere in Canada and the northernmost USA.

The northern harrier migrates south in winter, with breeding birds in Canada and northern Great Plains of the U.S. moving to the American south, Mexico, and Central America. In the midwestern, mountain west, and north Atlantic states of the U.S., they may be present all year. This bird inhabits prairies, open areas, and marshes.

==Taxonomy==
In 1750 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the northern harrier in the third volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The Ring-tail&#x27;d Hawk&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a bird collected near the Hudson Bay in Canada and brought to London by James Isham. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he placed the northern harrier with the falcons and eagles in the genus &quot;Falco&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Falco hudsonius&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The northern harrier is now placed in the genus &quot;Circus&quot;, introduced by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799. The genus name &quot;Circus&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;kirkos&quot;, referring to a bird of prey named for its circling flight (&quot;kirkos&quot;, &quot;circle&quot;). The specific epithet &quot;hudsonius&quot; is from &quot;Hudson Bay&quot;, the type locality. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The northern harrier was formerly considered to be conspecific with the hen harrier.

==Description==
The northern harrier is long with a wingspan. It resembles other harriers in having distinct male and female plumages. The sexes also differ in weight, with males weighing , with an average of , and females weighing , with an average of . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is and the tarsus is . It is relatively long-winged and long-tailed, having the longest wing and tail relative to its body size of any raptor occurring in North America.

The northern harrier breeds in North America, and its closest relative is the cinereous harrier (&quot;C. cinereus&quot;) of South America. The male&#x27;s plumage is darker grey than that of the hen harrier, and the female is also darker and more rufous. The adult male is sometimes nicknamed the &quot;Grey Ghost&quot;, because of his striking plumage and spectral aura.

The northern harrier is mostly silent, although males and females will both give fast &quot;kek&quot; notes that will last 1-2 seconds. When faced with predators or surrounded by smaller birds, they still emit &quot;kek&quot; notes but at a higher pitch. During the mating season, the female emits a loud scream, which causes the male to either mate or provide food.

==Behaviour==
This medium-sized raptor breeds on moorland, bogs, prairies, farmland coastal prairies, marshes, grasslands, swamps and other assorted open areas. A male will maintain a territory averaging , though male territories have ranged from .

These are one of the few raptorial birds known to practice polygyny – one male mates with several females. Up to five females have been known to mate with one male in a season. The nest is built on the ground or on a mound of dirt or vegetation. Nests are made of sticks and are lined inside with grass and leaves. Four to eight (exceptionally 2 to 10) whitish eggs are laid. The eggs measure approximately . The eggs are incubated mostly by the female for 31 to 32 days. When incubating eggs, the female sits on the nest while the male hunts and brings food to her and the chicks. The male will help feed chicks after they hatch, but does not usually watch them for a greater period of time than around 5 minutes. The male usually passes off food to the female, which she then feeds to the young, although later the female will capture food and simply drop into the nest for her nestlings to eat. The chicks fledge at around 36 days old, though breeding maturity is not reached until 2 years in females and 3 years in males.

===Hunting behavior===
This is a typical harrier, which hunts on long wings held in a shallow V in its low flight during which the bird closely hugs the contours of the land below it. Northern or hen harriers hunt primarily small mammals, as do most harriers. Preferred prey species can include voles, cotton rats and ground squirrels. Up to 95% of the diet comprises small mammals. However, birds are hunted with some regularity as well, especially by males. Preferred avian prey include passerines of open country (i.e. sparrows, larks, pipits), small shorebirds and the young of waterfowl and galliforms. Supplementing the diet occasionally are amphibians (especially frogs), reptiles and insects (especially orthopterans). The species has been observed to hunt bats if these are available. Larger prey such as rabbits and adult ducks are taken sometimes and harriers have been known to subdue these by drowning them in water. Harriers hunt by surprising prey while flying low to the ground in open areas, as they drift low over fields and moors. The harriers circle an area several times listening and looking for prey. Harriers use hearing regularly to find prey, as they have exceptionally good hearing for diurnal raptors, this being the function of their owl-like facial disc. This harrier tends to be a very vocal bird while it glides over its hunting ground.

===Mortality and competition===
Little information is available on longevity in northern harriers. The longest lived known bird is 16 years and 5 months. However, adults rarely live more than 8 years. Early mortality mainly results from predation. Predators of eggs and nestlings include raccoons, skunks, badgers, foxes, crows and ravens, dogs, and owls. Fledglings are also predated regularly, especially by great horned owls. Both parents attack potential predators with alarm calls and striking with talons. Short-eared owls are natural competitors of this species that favor the same prey and habitat, as well as having a similarly broad distribution. Occasionally, both harriers and short-eared owls will harass each other until the victim drops its prey and it can be stolen, a practice known as kleptoparasitism. Most commonly, the harriers are the aggressors pirating prey from owls.

==Status==
This species has a large range, and there is evidence of a population decline, but the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). It is therefore classified as &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Relationship with humans==
Some Native American tribes believe that seeing a hawk on your wedding day is a sign of a long, happy marriage. Unlike many raptors, hen or northern harriers have historically been favorably regarded by farmers because they eat mice that damage crops and predators of quail eggs. Harriers are sometimes called &quot;good hawks&quot; because they pose no threat to poultry as some hawks do. Heavy pesticide use in the 1970s and 1980s caused a decline in harrier populations.

<text>Exeter is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. Its population was 16,049 at the 2020 census, up from 14,306 at the 2010 census. Exeter was the county seat until 1997, when county offices were moved to neighboring Brentwood. Home to Phillips Exeter Academy, a private university-preparatory school, Exeter is situated where the Exeter River becomes the tidal Squamscott River.

The urban center of town, where 10,109 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the Exeter census-designated place.

== History ==

For thousands of years prior to European colonization, the area was inhabited by Pennacook Abenaki villagers. The location was originally known as &quot;M&#x27;Squamskook&quot;, meaning &quot;Falls at the Place of the Salmon&quot; in Abenaki language, and would later become known as &quot;Squamscott&quot;.

About 100 Pennacook would return to the Squamscott in the spring to fish, and raise corn, pumpkin, and pigeons, and had relations to other Pennacook at Concord, Sewall&#x27;s Island, and Manchester. They fished at the falls where the Exeter River becomes the tidal Squamscott, the site around which the future town of Exeter grew. The falls in Brentwood were known to have been a favorite fishing site of the native population.

=== 1638 settlement ===
On April 3, 1638, John Wheelwright, a clergyman exiled from the Puritan theocracy Massachusetts Bay Colony, purchased the land from Wehanownowit, the sagamore. Wheelwright took with him about 175 individuals to found a town he named after Exeter in Devon, England. Local government was linked with Massachusetts until New Hampshire became a separate colony in 1679, and counties were introduced in 1769.

One of the four original townships in the province, Exeter originally included Newmarket, Newfields, Brentwood, Epping, and Fremont. On July 4, 1639, 35 freemen of Exeter signed the &quot;Exeter Combination&quot;, a document written by Wheelwright to establish their own government. The settlers hunted, planted and fished, raised cattle and swine, or made shakes (shingles) and barrel staves.

Thomas Wilson established the town&#x27;s first grist mill on the eastern side of the island in the lower falls. This mill was established within the first season of settling in Exeter, and his son Humphrey assumed control of the mill in 1643, when Thomas died.

=== Gilman family ===
Some early settlers came from Hingham, Massachusetts, including the Gilman, Folsom, and Leavitt families. In 1647, Edward Gilman Jr. established the first sawmill, and by 1651, Gilman had a 50-ton sloop which he used to conduct business in lumber, staves, and masts. Gilman was lost at sea in 1653 while traveling to England to purchase equipment for his mills, but his family later became prominent as lumbermen, shipbuilders, merchants, and statesmen. The Gilman Garrison House and the American Independence Museum were both former homes of the Gilman family. The Gilman family also donated the land on which Phillips Exeter Academy stands, including the academy&#x27;s original Yard, the oldest part of campus. Members of the Gilman family have played an important role in the United States government, including Founding Father Nicholas Gilman, as well as treasurers, a governor, representatives to the General Assembly and judges to the General Court of New Hampshire.

The Gilman family began trading as far as the West Indies with ships they owned out of Portsmouth. In an 1803 voyage, the 180-ton clipper &quot;Oliver Peabody&quot;, owned by Gov. John Taylor Gilman, Oliver Peabody, Col. Gilman Leavitt, and others, was boarded by brigs belonging to the Royal Navy under command of Admiral Horatio Nelson. Enforcing a blockade against the French, Nelson offered ship Captain Stephen Gilman of Exeter a glass of wine and paid him for his cargo in Spanish dollars. The trip demonstrates how far afield the merchants of Exeter reached.

=== 1700s ===
The last Native American raid on Exeter was in August 1723, and by 1725, the tribes had left the area. In 1774, the rebellious Provincial Congress began to meet in the Exeter Town House after colonial governor John Wentworth banned it from the colonial capitol at Portsmouth. In July 1775, the Provincial Congress had the provincial records seized from royal officials in Portsmouth and brought to Exeter, as well, so Exeter became New Hampshire&#x27;s capital, an honor it held for 14 years.

Exeter had a significant African American community, with its first census in 1790 recording 81 free African Americans (in 14 households, 11 of which they owned), and two enslaved African Americans. This was the highest percentage of African Americans in any settlement in the state at 4.7%. Many African Americans, such as Jude Hall (namesake of Jude&#x27;s Pond on Drinkwater Road), earned their freedom fighting in the Revolutionary War, and many settled near the west bank of the Squamscott River after the war. Jude Hall is buried in the Winter Street cemetery.

=== 1800s ===
Reverend Thomas Paul of the African Meeting House in Boston was born in Exeter near this time, and later in 1822, abolitionist poet James Monroe Whitfield, a nephew of Jude Hall. In the late 1800s, two men had two dry-goods stores on Water Street, John Garrison Cutler and George Harris, who both had very high net worths at the time.

In 1827, the Exeter Manufacturing Company was established beside the river, using water power to produce cotton textiles. Other businesses manufactured shoes, saddles, harnesses, lumber, boxes, bricks, carriages, and bicycles. In 1836, the last schooner was launched at Exeter. In 1840, the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad entered the town.

According to former governor Hugh Gregg, the United States Republican Party was born in Exeter on October 12, 1853, at the Squamscott Hotel at a secret meeting of Amos Tuck with other abolitionists. At this meeting, Tuck proposed forming a new political party to be called Republican. Upon learning of Tuck&#x27;s meeting, in December 1853, Horace Greeley said, &quot;I think &#x27;Republican&#x27; would be the best name, it will sound both Jeffersonian and Madisonian, and for that reason will take well.&quot; Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, visited Exeter in 1860. His son, Robert Todd Lincoln, was attending Phillips Exeter Academy, the college preparatory school founded in 1781 by John Phillips. The town was also once home to the Robinson Female Seminary, established in 1867 and previously known as the Exeter Female Academy (established in 1826). Its landmark Second Empire schoolhouse, completed in 1869, burned in October 1961.

=== 1900s ===

Joanna Pellerin, president of the Rockingham Land Trust, described the Squamscott River of the 1940s: [The] Squamscott was a place to stay away from. It stank, and was filled with dyes from the mills and sewage dumped from along Water Street.In 1922, it was affected by the 1922 New England Textile Strike, shutting down the mills in the town over an attempted wage cut and hours increase.

In September 1965, Exeter was involved in UFO history when local teenager Norman Muscarello and two Exeter police officers, Eugene Bertrand and David Hunt, witnessed a bright red UFO at close range. Their sighting attracted national publicity and became the focus of a bestselling book, &quot;Incident at Exeter&quot;, by journalist John G. Fuller. The Air Force eventually admitted that it had been unable to identify the strange object, and it is still considered by many UFO buffs to be one of the most impressive UFO sightings on record.

=== Architecture ===

Exeter has a considerable number of architectural structures. Arthur Gilman designed the Old Town Hall of 1855. The Old Public Library of 1894, which now is home to the Exeter Historical Society, was designed by the Boston firm of Rotch &amp; Tilden. Ralph Adams Cram, who trained with Rotch &amp; Tilden, designed both Phillips Church, built in 1897, and Tuck High School, built in 1911. Cram&#x27;s firm of Cram &amp; Ferguson designed the entire Phillips Exeter Academy campus between 1908 and 1950. More recent is the Academy Library, built in 1971 to the design of Louis I. Kahn. Sculptor Daniel Chester French created the town&#x27;s war memorial in 1922. Architect Henry Bacon designed in 1916 the Swasey Pavilion at Exeter&#x27;s town square.

Other features of the town include the Swasey Parkway, which replaced the wharves and warehouses along the Squamscott River, and the Ioka Theatre of 1915 on Water Street. The latter was built by Edward Mayer, an Exeter judge and resident. Mayer&#x27;s opening feature was &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, by D. W. Griffith. The theatre&#x27;s curious name was proposed in a contest by a young woman with an enthusiasm for Scouting. &quot;Ioka&quot; was a Native American word meaning &quot;playground&quot;.

== Geography and wildlife ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has an area of , of which are land and is covered by water, comprising 1.80% of the town. Exeter is drained by the Exeter River, which feeds the tidal Squamscott River in the center of town. Exeter&#x27;s highest point is above sea level, on Great Hill at the town&#x27;s southwestern corner. Exeter lies fully within the Piscataqua River (Coastal) watershed.

=== Rivers ===
In 2005, the small herring-like alewife fish was present in the Exeter River, though its numbers were fewer than in previous years. Local accounts suggest that the average length of the alewife was six inches. At this point in time the Exeter River was dammed in downtown Exeter, and a fish ladder would occasionally have a visible chad, lamprey eel, or trout.

Water from the small freshwater Dearborn Brook is stored in the Exeter Reservoir to support municipal drinking water system. A 2005 plan to manage Dearborn Brook was submitted by the Rockingham Planning Commission through the Clean Water Act. Dearborn Brook is a freshwater tributary to the tidal Squamscott River.

In fall 2015, the majority of the rivers in Exeter were impaired from stormwater and snowmelt-driven runoff pollutants, including large portions of Exeter River and Squamscott River, Dudley Brook, Little River, and Piscassic River.

In 2016, the Great Dam that had separated the Exeter River and the Squamscott River was removed. The removal of the dam and the fish ladder caused the alewife population to rebound, with over 100,000 fish as compared to 1,628 in 1970 and 15,626 in 1981. Hawks and eagles have been observed hunting the fish.

=== Trees ===
A 2017 town survey found that most human-planted trees in the urban areas of Exeter are broadleaf deciduous. Some significant species include Norway maples, red maple, oak, sugar maples, hedge maples, and ash.

Exeter also maintains a list of approved trees for planting, which include 30 trees native to the area, four trees native to the Eastern U.S., and 27 non-native species. Native trees include: Red maple, Sugar maple, Freeman maple, Serviceberry or juneberry, River birch, American hornbeam, Hackberry, Common hackberry, Pagoda dogwood, Flowering dogwood, Hawthorn, American beech, Eastern red cedar, Black gum, Ironwood, White spruce (Picea alba), Pitch pine, White pine, American sycamore, Pin cherry, White oak, Swamp white oak, Scarlet oak, Bur oak, Red oak, Black willow, Sassafras, American mountain ash (Sorbus americana &#x27;dwarfcrown&#x27;), American linden, and American elm.

===Wildlife===
Exeter contains the publicly-owned 235 acre Conner Farm Wildlife Management Area. This area contains about 90 acres of open fields, as well as upland forests of red oak, white oak, hemlock, and white pine. There are also black cherry, hickory, hop hornbeam, aspen, and birch trees. Additionally, there is a small freshwater marsh, a stream, and beaver ponds. Animals include deer, turkey, and migratory waterfowl.

<text>Starship Troopers is a 1997 American science fiction action film directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Edward Neumeier, based on the 1959 novel by Robert A. Heinlein. Set in the 23rd century, the story follows teenager Johnny Rico and his comrades as they serve in the military of the United Citizen Federation, an Earth-based world government engaged in an interstellar war against an alien species known as the Arachnids. The film stars Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Jake Busey, Neil Patrick Harris, Patrick Muldoon, and Michael Ironside.

Development of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; began in 1991 as &quot;Bug Hunt at Outpost 7&quot;, written by Neumeier. After recognizing similarities between Neumeier&#x27;s script and Heinlein&#x27;s book, producer Jon Davison suggested aligning the script more closely with the novel to garner greater interest from studio executives. Despite these efforts development was slow, with studios hesitant to fund the costly project right up to the start of filming. Principal photography took place between April and October 1996 on a $100–110 million budget, of which nearly half was spent on the extensive computer-generated imagery (CGI) and practical effects required to vivify the Arachnid creatures.

Released on November 7, 1997, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; faced critical backlash, with reviewers interpreting the film as endorsing fascism and disparaging its violence and cast performances. Despite initial box office success, collections slowed down amid negative reviews and unfavorable word of mouth, culminating in a $121 million total gross against its budget, which made it the 34th-highest-grossing film of 1997. The disappointing performance of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was blamed, in part, on competition from a high number of successful or anticipated science fiction and genre films released that year, its satire and violence failing to connect with mainstream audiences, and ineffective marketing.

Since its release, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; has been critically re-evaluated and is now considered a cult classic and a prescient satire of fascism and authoritarian governance that has grown in relevance. The film launched a multimedia franchise that includes four sequels—&quot;Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation&quot; (2004), &quot;Starship Troopers 3: Marauder&quot; (2008), &quot;Starship Troopers: Invasion&quot; (2012), and &quot;Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars&quot; (2017)—as well as a , video games, comics, and a variety of merchandise.

== Plot ==

In the future, Earth is governed by the United Citizen Federation, a stratocratic regime founded generations earlier by &quot;veterans&quot; after democracy and social scientists brought civilization to the brink of ruin. Citizenship is exclusively earned through federal service, which grants rights—like voting and procreation—that are withheld from ordinary civilians. Humans, who are now capable of interstellar travel, conduct colonization missions throughout the galaxy, bringing them into conflict with a race of highly evolved insectoid creatures dubbed &quot;Arachnids&quot; or, derisively, &quot;bugs&quot;.

Against his parents&#x27; objections, teenage jock Johnny Rico enlists as a mobile infantryman to remain close to his girlfriend, spaceship pilot Carmen Ibanez. Their psychic friend Carl Jenkins joins military intelligence, while Isabelle &quot;Dizzy&quot; Flores—who is in love with Rico—deliberately transfers to his squad. Carmen ends her relationship with Rico due to their diverging career paths and her growing feelings for a fellow pilot, Zander Barcalow. During training, Rico impresses his drill sergeant, Zim, earning a promotion to squad leader. However, Rico makes a mistake during a training exercise, which leads to the death of a squad member and the resignation of another, resulting in Rico&#x27;s demotion and flogging. Disheartened, Rico quits, but re-enlists after learning that an asteroid sent by the Arachnids has destroyed Buenos Aires, killing millions, including his parents.

An invasion force is deployed to Klendathu, the Arachnids&#x27; home planet, but military intelligence underestimates the Arachnids&#x27; defensive abilities, leading to thousands of human casualties. Badly wounded, Rico is rescued by Lieutenant Jean Rasczak, his former high school teacher, but is mistakenly reported dead, devastating Carmen. Following his recovery, Rico, Dizzy, and squadmate Ace Levy join Rasczak&#x27;s elite unit, the Roughnecks. After Rico defeats a gigantic &quot;Tanker Bug&quot; on the disputed planet of Tango Urilla, he is elevated to the rank of corporal for his valor and begins a romantic relationship with Dizzy.

Responding to a distress signal on the Arachnid-controlled Planet P, the Roughnecks discover an Arachnid-ravaged outpost and are ambushed by the bugs. Carmen and Zander recover the surviving Roughnecks by dropship, but not before Dizzy is fatally impaled by an Arachnid and Rico mercy kills the mutilated Rasczak. The group returns to the fleet assembled in orbit above P, where Dizzy is eulogized.

Jenkins, now a colonel, reveals the Roughnecks were deliberately ordered into the trap, justifying it as a necessary sacrifice to confirm the existence of a &quot;Brain Bug&quot;, an intelligent Arachnid strategically directing the others. He assigns Rico command of the Roughnecks and field-promotes him to lieutenant, instructing him to return to P and capture the Brain Bug. As the battle commences, Carmen&#x27;s ship is destroyed by the Arachnids, but an escape pod carrying her and Zander crashes into an underground tunnel system. The pair are captured by the Arachnids and the Brain Bug consumes Zander&#x27;s brain, absorbing his knowledge. Rico directs his squad to complete their mission while he, Ace, and their squadmate Watkins rescue Carmen and hold the Arachnids at bay with a miniature nuclear bomb.

The Brain Bug escapes while the Arachnids attack and fatally wound Watkins, who sacrifices himself by detonating the bomb while his teammates escape. On the surface, they learn that Zim has captured the Brain Bug and the assembled troops rejoice as Jenkins psychically detects it is afraid. A propaganda broadcast details how the Brain Bug is being invasively studied to learn its secrets and ensure humanity&#x27;s victory. The ad encourages viewers to enlist and do their part in the war so they can become like Carmen, now captain of her own ship, and Rico, who enthusiastically leads his troops into another battle.

Verhoeven&#x27;s assistant, Stacy Lumbrezer, appears as a smiling woman during a psychic advertisement, and Paul Sammon, author of &quot;The Making of Starship Troopers&quot;, appears as a man feeding a cow to an Arachnid.

===Development as &quot;Bug Hunt at Outpost 7&quot;===
Since the release of &quot;RoboCop&quot; (1987), producer Jon Davison had aimed to develop another project that would reunite key members of its creative team, including writer Edward Neumeier and stop motion animator Phil Tippett. Neumeier and his co-writer Michael Miner had struggled to develop new story ideas in the intervening years and, realizing their partnership was no longer effective, Neumeier began working alone on a story treatment titled &quot;Bug Hunt at Outpost 7&quot;. His treatment was intended to be a comedic, jingoistic, and xenophobic war film pitting the heroes against insects—chosen due to his wife&#x27;s fear of them—set against the backdrop of a teenage romance story.

In December 1991, Neumeier brought his treatment to Davison at Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank, which also headquartered TriStar Pictures, with whom Davison had a pre-existing development deal. Davison realized the treatment bore similarities to the 1959 science fiction novel, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, by Robert A. Heinlein. The novel had received a strongly divided reception on its release for promoting military power and necessary violence while criticizing liberal social programs, but had remained a popular work. Neumeier and Davison considered directly adapting &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, but Davison assumed the film adaptation rights would already be taken and encouraged Neumeier to continue with his treatment, retitled &quot;Outpost 7&quot;.

By late 1992, Neumeier had completed the &quot;Outpost 7&quot; treatment, alternately known as &quot;Bug Hunt&quot;. Davison presented it to TriStar executive Chris Lee, who rejected it. Neumeier and Davison learned that the rights for &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; were available and instead pitched an adaptation of the novel using elements of &quot;Outpost 7&quot;. Lee was more receptive, and the pair also gained support from other executives, including TriStar head of production Mike Medavoy, who had supported their work on &quot;RoboCop&quot;. The rights to &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; were purchased and Neumeier began adapting &quot;Outpost 7&quot; to more closely fit Heinlein&#x27;s novel.

===Development as &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;===

Progress was slow as TriStar regularly replaced executives, including Medavoy, and high cost or risk projects, like &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, were more closely scrutinized. Davison spent much of 1993 securing several key crew including Tippett and &quot;RoboCop&quot; director Paul Verhoeven. Neumeier and Davison said Verhoeven was their only choice to direct &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; because they determined the fantastical creatures, genre, and political subtext suited his creative sensibilities. Verhoeven recruited Alan Marshall as a producer, having worked with him on &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992) and his most recent project &quot;Showgirls&quot; (1995). Despite Verhoeven&#x27;s previous successes leading into the early 1990s, he was in need of a promising project as his efforts to develop the pirate adventure &quot;Mistress of the Seas&quot; and the Arnold Schwarzenegger-starring &quot;Crusade&quot; had failed. &quot;Showgirls&quot; would go on to fail financially and earn him the worst reviews of his career.

By 1994, TriStar remained reluctant to move &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; into pre-production. Key crew members, including Davison and Verhoeven, decided to produce test footage to demonstrate their intended visual style and tone. TriStar paid $225,000 toward development of the &quot;Bug Test&quot;, a brief scene filmed at Vasquez Rocks near Los Angeles on July 21, 1994. Although still busy filming &quot;Showgirls&quot;, Verhoeven directed the sequence, which was filmed by John Hora and a 30-person crew. The sequence depicts a soldier (played by Mitch Gaylord) being pursued and killed by two Warrior Bugs, which were animated by Tippett Studio; Neumeier makes a cameo appearance as a dead soldier. The visual effects were finished by September, and the footage screened for TriStar executives in early October. Executives including Lee and Mark Canton were impressed with the visual effects and did not realize they were computer-generated imagery (CGI). They approved moving into pre-production, but other executives remained non-committal on providing any substantial funding.

In early 1995, Davison developed a detailed budget totalling $90 million, based on Neumeier&#x27;s third draft. TriStar rejected this amount, citing the financial failure of the $200 million-budgeted &quot;Waterworld&quot; (1995), which resulted in the firing of several executives at Universal Pictures. TriStar executives determined that, to move forward, the cost of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; had to be split with a business partner. Davison screened the Bug Test for potential suitors, attracting the interest of Walt Disney Studios. An agreement was reached between TriStar, its parent company Sony Pictures, and Disney to produce &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; via TriStar and Disney&#x27;s Touchstone Pictures, splitting the budget costs and box office profits evenly, in exchange for Touchstone receiving all distribution rights to the film outside the United States and Canada. Each studio was also given creative input on the film and its marketing.
===Writing===
Neumeier began adapting the &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; novel at the beginning of 1993, working from his office in Eagle Rock, Los Angeles. He was concerned about how to translate the tone of Heinlein&#x27;s work because of the controversy surrounding its release, which identified Heinlein as alternately a conservative, militarist, libertarian, and fascist. The novel espouses the benefits of military service, citizenship, and masculinity. Heinlein described the central theme as being &quot;that a man, to be truly human, must be unhesitatingly willing at all times to lay down his life for his fellow man. [This theme] is based on the twin concepts of love and duty—and how they are related to the survival of our race&quot;. Neuimeier and Davison wanted to accurately depict the novel&#x27;s viewpoint and believed that audiences would appreciate the concept of a failing democracy and stricter cultural controls.

Certain aspects of the novel were challenging for Neumeier to adapt. While he considered the first and third acts narratively strong, he felt the middle act—focusing on Rico&#x27;s boot camp experience—was an overly long piece preaching to Heinlein&#x27;s readership, which would not translate well to film. To address this, he identified key elements such as the high school opening, boot camp, battles, and the underlying philosophy and sociopolitics. To compensate for the slower second act, he expanded on certain themes, including the teenage romance, drawing from his own experiences of pursuing women who had no interest in him. The first draft was completed on July 8, 1993. It remained generally faithful to Heinlein&#x27;s novel, including a secondary alien race known as the &quot;Skinnies&quot;; the &quot;Bounce&quot;, a technology allowing infantry members to make jet-assisted superhuman jumps; and power armor, which granted the troops superhuman strength. A copy was sent to Heinlein&#x27;s wife, who was pleased with it.

Verhoeven tried, and failed, to read the novel, finding it uninteresting and too politically right-wing. He had Neumeier summarize the narrative, and found it militaristic, fascistic, and overly supportive of armed conflict, which clashed with Verhoeven&#x27;s childhood experiences in the German-occupied Netherlands during World War II. Verhoeven decided to use the basic plot to satirize and undermine the book&#x27;s themes by deconstructing the concepts of totalitarianism, fascism, and militarism, saying: &quot;All the way through I wanted the audience to be asking, &#x27;Are [the characters] crazy? His contributions to Neumeier&#x27;s second draft included developing the romantic subplot between Rico and Carmen, and combining the male character Dizzy with a Neumeier-created female character called Ronnie who was romantically interested in Rico. This, in turn, led Neumeier to develop romantic triangles between Dizzy, Rico, Carmen, and Zander.

The Skinnies were removed, because Verhoeven thought depicting an additional alien race would be confusing, while queen bugs and advanced canines called neo-dogs were considered financially unviable. Other financially motivated changes included the removal of the Bounce and the Drop, a method of inserting troops from orbit in capsules that shed consecutive layers during landing. Preliminary designs were made of the capsules, but attached to parachutes, which did not match the intended aesthetic, and adding rockets was deemed impractical, because it would have required numerous different visual effects and taken too much time to accomplish. In addition to cost, the Bounce was removed, because the troops would look like they were on pogo sticks and it made it too easy to avoid Arachnid attacks. The Arachnids were made more insect-like, as Verhoeven did not want them to wield weaponry or act like humanoids. The most controversial omission from the novel, for fans, was the power armor. Davison said that despite the importance of the armor, it was financially impossible to create hundreds of suits for the cast and extras. He and Verhoeven initially agreed to use the power armor sparingly, and integrate various different ideas such as the Bounce into them, but later determined it gave the troops too much of a combat advantage.

The FedNet sequences, the main source of information in the future, were invented for the film, representing how Neumeier believed television and computers would eventually be combined. Neumeier completed his third and final draft by early 1995. Verhoeven described the script as being about contemporary American politics, such as a lack of gun control and increasing capital punishment under Texas governor George W. Bush, which he believed could potentially lead to fascism. The characters of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, he said, were &quot;fascists who aren&#x27;t aware of their fascism&quot;. He said: &quot;If I tell the world that a right-wing, fascist way of doing things doesn&#x27;t work, no one will listen to me. So I&#x27;m going to make a perfect fascist world: everyone is beautiful, everything is shiny, everything has big guns and fancy ships but it&#x27;s only good for killing fucking Bugs!&quot;

===Pre-production===
Under the company name Big Bug Pictures, the &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; team worked in a large suite in the Astaire Building at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California. While pre-production began in earnest by September 1995, after Verhoeven concluded work on &quot;Showgirls&quot;, he had already spent several months producing over 4,000 storyboard images of the &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; script. Conscious that the Arachnids, among other CGI elements, would be added after filming, he wanted a detailed image of how each scene would be set out during filming. Storyboard artists Robin Richesson and Giacomo Ghiazzi refined Verhoeven&#x27;s storyboards, the majority of the comic book–style art being done by Ghiazzi.

Many key crew members were hired in 1996, including Verhoeven&#x27;s long-time cinematographer Jost Vacano, as well as Vic Armstrong (second unit director and stunt coordinator), Mark Goldblatt (editor), John Richardson (special effects supervisor), Basil Poledouris (music composer), and Robert Latham Brown (production manager). Tippett also hired the nearly 100 additional staff required to realize the Arachnids, including Craig Hayes (visual effects artist) and Trey Stokes (animation department head). Davison&#x27;s responsibilities focused on the special effects, while Marshall was concerned more with the filming.

Production designer Allan Cameron and location manager Bill Bowling scouted several filming locations, but rejected most as they did not consider them particularly unique. Others, such as the Valley of Fire State Park in Nevada had too many environmental restrictions which could delay filming, and obtaining the necessary permits was slow due to an extended period of U.S. government shutdowns. Bowling identified Hell&#x27;s Half Acre, located just outside Casper, Wyoming, which offered colorful buttes and pinnacles to portray the alien planets of Klendathu and Planet P, although it was rife with rattlesnakes. The location was remote, about or an hour&#x27;s drive from the production office and hotels for the cast and crew. It offered other logistical challenges as it was generally undeveloped land, requiring the production to build roads for the trucks carrying gear into the canyons for filming. Anything that could not be transported by road was lowered by helicopter. Construction of some on-location sets such as Whiskey Outpost camp began in February 1996 and took six weeks. The local government was supportive of the project, subsidizing the building of the roads and camp.

Another, more easily accessible location, Barry Barber Ranch near Kadoka, South Dakota, and the Badlands National Park, featured little vegetation and a smooth, undulating landscape, which was chosen to portray Tango Urilla. As pre-production continued, Davison remained concerned about TriStar&#x27;s ongoing executive turnover and its inconsistent commitment to funding. Verhoeven believed the repeated regime changes at the studio worked in their favor, as the project was overlooked until it was too late to cancel it.

===Casting===
Verhoeven wanted a cast who visually embodied the Aryan, blonde, blue-eyed, and beautiful image he had perceived in the Nazi propaganda films &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; (1935) and &quot;Olympia&quot; (1938) by Leni Riefenstahl. He focused on popular film actors in their late teens and early twenties, but realized that many of the contemporary stars he wanted, such as Chris O&#x27;Donnell and Christian Slater, were already in their thirties—which would make the characters seem less naive—or committed to other projects. Although television actors were still generally overlooked when casting films, the production looked at shows such as &quot;Melrose Place&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, which featured young, photogenic, but less well known actors, such as Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, and Dina Meyer.

Van Dien performed five auditions for the Rico role, and underwent eight months of training after securing it, gaining of muscle and losing from his waist. Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon also auditioned, but Verhoeven believed Van Dien closely fit the Riefenstahl aesthetic. Richards also performed five auditions to portray Carmen in November and December 1995, before finally screen testing against Van Dien. Meyer&#x27;s agent recommended auditioning for Carmen, but she wanted to portray Dizzy because she thought she could convey the character&#x27;s &quot;heart&quot; and vulnerability at being overlooked by Rico because her toughness makes her seem like just another guy.

Neil Patrick Harris was mainly known for portraying a child doctor on &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot; (1989–1993), and wanted a project that would shed that image as he moved into his adult career. He described Jenkins as almost two separate characters, Rico&#x27;s geeky and funny friend who becomes worn, pale, and troubled by his responsibilities. Making his feature film debut, Patrick Muldoon described his character Zander as ambiguous and competitive, while Verhoeven and Neumeier saw him as possessing a darker side. Jake Busey considered Ace Levy to be an integral character necessary for releasing the tension for the audience by finding the humor in macabre situations. Seth Gilliam said his character is like a Vietnam War veteran who cannot adapt to life outside war.

Clancy Brown portrays Sergeant Zim, a &quot;crusty, macho, jingoistic, ultimately admirable drill instructor&quot;. Brown based his performance on archetypical drill instructors from military films such as &quot;The D.I.&quot; (1957) and &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; (1987), as well as taking guidance from retired Marine captain Dale Dye, who said that Brown should act as if his soldiers are watching his every move. Verhoeven was a fan of Michael Ironside, having attempted to cast him in &quot;RoboCop&quot; and giving him a central role in &quot;Total Recall&quot; (1990). Ironside&#x27;s Jean Rasczak appears early in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; to set the tone, and was an original creation combining two characters from the novel: Rico&#x27;s teacher, Lieutenant Colonel Jean V. Dubois, and Lieutenant Rasczak, a heroic soldier.

Members of the principal cast, including Van Dien, Meyer, Busey, Gilliam and Curnal Aulisio, and 24 extras undertook twelve days of military training, led by Dye, from April 17, 1996, to the start of filming. Conducted in Hell&#x27;s Half Acre, the training included basic combat skills and tactics as Dye perceived they may evolve centuries in the future. Activities included a daily 3-mile (4.8 km) run, marching, and weapon handling. Those involved slept in open-air military tents, dealing with the harsh conditions, including of snow and ice following a blizzard, and windstorms. Extra Julia Rupkalvis&#x27;s experience during the training led to her becoming a key assistant to Dye while training the hundreds of extras portraying troopers. As Richards was not in the infantry cast, she did not have to participate, but chose to anyway, later remarking how she, Van Dien, and Busey bonded while huddling together for warmth during the blizzard.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on April 29, 1996, with six weeks of filming in Hell&#x27;s Half Acre. The area featured extreme weather conditions, including hot days, frigid evenings, blizzards, and wind storms that affected much of the on-site equipment, requiring replacements to be flown in on a regular basis. It was also temporarily evacuated after torrential rain mixed with bentonite in the soil, creating a slick surface. The crew returned two weeks later to find that miles of electrical cables, some equipment, and even cars had sunk into the mud. Only a few days of filming were lost, however, as a local warehouse had been converted into a soundstage. The conditions also caused respiratory and exhaustion issues among the crew, and many were treated for heat stroke after wearing heavy costumes in the heat, including Busey. Production was paused for a week while he recovered, costing $1.5 million a day. A Klendathu night battle sequence filmed there featured about 1,300 background trooper extras for each night of filming.

A steadicam was used for most filming, with occasional handheld footage for battle scenes, inspired by the 1944 Normandy landings, to make the audience feel like a part of the scene. Most effects scenes were shot early in the schedule so there was sufficient time for the effects team to complete their work. The cast struggled with scenes in which they had to interact with blank space that would later be filled with CGI creations. Cardboard cutouts, tennis balls, flags, and even Verhoeven wielding a broom were methods used to indicate where the creatures would be.

In May, during the Memorial Day holiday weekend, an oncoming driver struck a car carrying crew, resulting in the deaths of two crew members, their driver, and severely injuring television personality Rachel Campos, the girlfriend of one of the dead crew members. Counselling was offered for the remaining cast and crew, who provided donations towards Campos&#x27;s recovery. Filming moved to Barry Barber Ranch on June 14, for scenes set on Klendathu and Tango Urilla, before returning to Casper on June 26. The post Tango Urilla battle celebration was filmed at Vasquez Rocks.

On the crew&#x27;s flight to Los Angeles on June 29, an intoxicated crew member mentioned a bomb, resulting in the plane being evacuated, cargo searched, and all passengers being detained. The crew member was arrested while the remaining team waited another day for a flight, losing a rest day and a day of filming. Filming on sets began in early July, including the Buenos Aires education center classroom, biology lab, and Jenkins&#x27;s basement sets, which were built at Sony Studios. The Jump Ball scene was filmed at the Long Beach Pyramid arena. Van Dien, Meyer, and Muldoon performed many of their own stunts for the scene, apart from flips and somersaults, and encouraged each other to be physically rough. The exam results scene and the prom were both filmed at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Baldwin Park. The Federal Recruitment Center scene and following segment in which Carmen leaves by train were filmed over four days at the Los Angeles Convention Center, which Verhoeven chose because he considered its architecture to be futuristic and clean. Some scenes were also filmed at the Park Plaza Hotel.

Camp Currie boot camp scenes were filmed at Mile Square Regional Park in Fountain Valley, which Cameron favored for its abandoned World War II blimp runway onto which they installed a top coat of tarmac and paint for a parade ground. It also fit their image of a low-pollution Earth, being surrounded by flat ground and trees. The co-ed nude shower scene was filmed on a set at Sony Pictures with about fifteen cast members. The set was cleared of all but the cast, Verhoeven, and Vacano, who also undressed at the cast&#x27;s request. A separate nude scene was written for Richards, but she refused to take part, as she did not see the purpose.

Armstrong&#x27;s second unit filmed action sequences as well as the complex stunts and special effect scenes that would be time-consuming for the main unit. He delegated much of the main unit stunt work to Dickey Beer to avoid overworking himself. The fight between Rico and Zander was mainly performed by Van Dien and Muldoon while wearing padding suits. Van Dien was injured during a stunt that involved him riding on the back of a gigantic moving fiberglass &quot;Tanker Bug&quot; shell. The movement kept slamming him into the shell as he was held in place with ropes, chipping one of his teeth and bruising his ribs over the three and a half days of filming, but he refused to mention the pain and risk stalling filming. One of the more dangerous stunts came near the end of filming, involving Van Dien, Busey, and Richards running out of an Arachnid tunnel followed by a real explosion. Only one take was done and they were told that, if someone tripped, they should pick them up and keep moving.

Despite the difficult conditions and obstacles, principal photography concluded on October 16, 1996, only slightly over schedule, after six months of filming generally six days a week. Second unit filming concluded a week later on October 23, after filming various explosions and background scenery.

===Post-production===
Post-production began in late October 1996, and concluded in August 1997. &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was edited by Mark Goldblatt with co-editor Caroline Ross. Goldblatt described Verhoeven as very collaborative, allowing them to interpret his footage in their own way and to provide input during filming on how special effects may be staged. Even so, Goldblatt said Verhoeven was conservative with what he filmed and generally only captured what he wanted with no coverage footage. Some scenes were changed for the release, including trimming the scene of the Brain Bug sucking brains. A separate scene of a soldier being decapitated by an Arachnid was removed preemptively to avoid a restrictive NC-17 release rating. Another scene, of Carmen kissing Rico during the finale, was cut, because test audiences thought it was immoral after Zander&#x27;s death, and were unconvinced that Carmen could love both men simultaneously. The audiences were also unhappy with Carmen choosing her career over her relationship with Rico and wanted her to die instead of Dizzy.

Additional supplemental scenes were filmed during this period, primarily the FedNet propaganda sequences, as there was no time to complete these during principal photography. Filmed over a week in late January 1997, with many of the same crew, including Verhoeven and Vacano, mainly on location in and around Los Angeles, the FedNet sequences included survivors digging through the remains of Buenos Aires, shot on a vacant lot in downtown Los Angeles that was dressed with broken concrete and flame effects. Another scene of a psychic with a third eye was filmed in a Delta Air Lines hangar at the Los Angeles International Airport. Two rough cut screenings were held for executives on May 29 and 30, 1997, receiving a positive reaction with discussions of a sequel. &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is reported to have had a final budget of $100–$110 million.

===Visual effects===

About half of the budget for &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was dedicated to realizing the required 500 visual effect shots. Tippett Studio was mainly responsible for producing effects relating to the Arachnids while Sony Pictures Imageworks (SPI) was tasked with spaceship effects. Davison wanted to use other studios, but it was made clear to him by studio executives that the film would not receive financing without using the in-house studio. Jim Martin and SPI art director Michael Scheffe were mainly responsible for the design of the crafts, with Martin providing broad outlines which were given greater detail and a more consistent appearance by Scheffe. Using SPI would lead to production problems, with their contributions falling months behind schedule and those effects that were completed being deemed insufficient by the filmmakers, resulting in the hiring of Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) and Boss Film Studios to complete the effects work. Many miniatures were made of the ships for different scenes, some of them measuring up to long.

Designing the Arachnids was a collaborative process between Tippett, Hayes, Davison, Neumeier, and Verhoeven. The final designs included the Warrior, Tanker, Plasma, Hopper, and Brain bugs. While CGI was the main method of realizing the creatures, some practical appliances were built by Amalgamated Dynamics, including two full-scale mechanized Warrior bugs capable of lifting an adult in their jaws.

===Music===
The score for &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was composed by Basil Poledouris over six months. Poledouris intended to score the film as an action movie, but Verhoeven wanted the music to offer a realistic background for the characters&#x27; experiences. As a result, Poledouris focused on creating a sense of excitement, passion, and poignancy. Verhoeven chose Poledouris&#x27;s theme for the &quot;Rodger Young&quot; spaceship, titled &quot;Klendathu Drop&quot;, as the basis for the overall score. Poledouris developed themes for specific characters and relationships, including the one between Rico and Dizzy, whom he considered the &quot;heart&quot; of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, but did not create a theme for the Arachnids as he wanted their distinct noises to contrast with the score. The score was recorded on a Sony Studios recording stage between June and September 1997, with a full orchestra of 97 musicians using acoustic and percussion instruments. Evelyn Oz, a band including Poledouris&#x27;s daughter, Zoë, performs two songs during the prom scene: an original song, &quot;Into It&quot;, and &quot;I Have Not Been to Oxford Town&quot;, composed by David Bowie.

==Release==
===Marketing===
&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was initially scheduled for release on July 2, 1997, but was later pushed back to July 25, then September, and finally November 7. These shifts were made to allow more time to complete special effects work and increase public awareness of the film, but it was also thought that &quot;Air Force One&quot; and &quot;Men in Black&quot;, which starred popular actors, were more commercially viable options for Sony Pictures. Alan Marshall stated that no one involved in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was happy about delaying an anticipated blockbuster to after the peak theatrical season. The first trailer for &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was released on November 22, 1996, appearing before &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, with the second playing before &quot;Men in Black&quot; and &quot;Air Force One&quot; in 1997.

===Box office===

The premiere of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; took place on November 4, 1997, in Westwood, Los Angeles, with an afterparty at the Museum of Flying.

In the United States and Canada, the film was released on November 7, 1997. During its opening weekend, the film grossed approximately $22.1 million from 2,971 theaters—an average of $7,424 per theater—making it the top film of the weekend, beating out &quot;Bean&quot; ($12.7 million) and &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; ($6.5 million), both in their fourth weekend. &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave 1,000 tickets for &quot;Bean&quot; to young boys as a test, and recorded that many then snuck into the R-rated &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;.

In its second weekend, the film dropped to second place, grossing $10 million, ahead of the re-release of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; ($9.8 million) and behind the debut of &quot;The Jackal&quot; ($15.2 million). This represented a 54% decrease from the previous weekend&#x27;s box office. In its third weekend, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; fell to seventh place with a box office gross of $4.7 million, and left the top 10 highest-grossing films by its sixth weekend in mid-December. The film left most theaters by the end of the year with a total box office gross of about $54.8 million, making it the 33rd highest-grossing film of the year in the U.S. and Canada.

Outside the U.S. and Canada, the film is estimated to have grossed an additional $66.3 million, giving it a worldwide box office of $121 million, and making it the 34th highest-grossing film worldwide that year. Verhoeven said that Davison had told him it would &quot;never make its money back. He saw there was a problem with the American audience better than I had.&quot;

== Reception ==
===Critical response===
&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; received generally negative reviews and was unpopular with critics and audiences on release. Audience polls by CinemaScore found that moviegoers gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an scale.

Many reviewers did not interpret &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; as a satire and believed that its fascist themes were sincere. An editorial in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the film as pro-fascist, made, directed, and written by Nazis. Stephen Hunter said the film was &quot;spiritually&quot; and &quot;psychologically&quot; Nazi and born of a Nazi-like imagination. Hunter described it as a &quot;perversion&quot; of Erich Maria Remarque&#x27;s 1929 novel, &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, which portrays the physical and mental tolls of war, by glorifying the horrors of war. Others, such as &quot;Empire&quot;, argued that the &quot;constant fetishizing of weaponry&quot; and &quot;[Aryan] cast&quot;, combined with the militaristic imagery in &quot;RoboCop&quot; and &quot;Total Recall&quot;, made it seem as though Verhoeven admired Heinlein&#x27;s world more than he claimed. Some critics, such as Roger Ebert and Owen Gleiberman, recognized the satire, but often found that this commentary was indistinguishable from the promotion of the fascist utopia it was satirizing. &quot;Salon&quot; argued that even with good satire, it is &quot;self-defeatingly stupid&quot; to use it in a story that wants its audience to care about its characters, and that &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; fails to replace Heinlein&#x27;s themes with a worthwhile ideal. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Verhoeven had &quot;lost his touch&quot; with satire by failing to respect his audiences&#x27; intelligence and make the world of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; interesting or convincing.

Kenneth Turan and James Berardinelli considered the film among the most &quot;jaw-dropping&quot; and easily digestible films of that year, compared to several other blockbuster projects which had been disappointing. Berardinelli said that, at its best, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; replicated the thrills of &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), while emulating television teen drama &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; in its worst moments. &quot;Salon&quot;″s review described &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; as an unintelligent and &quot;discordant&quot; combination of ultraviolence, poor acting, and special effects. Ebert said that Heinlein&#x27;s novel was written for juveniles and the film would only be of interest to younger audiences. Janet Maslin and Turan found Neuemeier&#x27;s script to be unsuccessful in transitioning from the teenage love story to the carnage of war, but that &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; remained watchable as a live-action comic book. Turan, in particular, said that unlike its contemporaries, such as &quot;Independence Day&quot; and &quot;Twister&quot; (both 1996), &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; benefitted from a lack of pretence that the effects were less important than emotions or &quot;pseudo-sensitivity&quot;. Ebert concluded that, apart from the satire, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; lacked any humanity or basic entertainment value with which to establish a connection to the audience.

Turan&#x27;s and &quot;Empire&quot;″s reviews, among others, were dismissive of the central cast, describing them as &quot;no name&quot; models that offered only an all-American superficial Aryan stereotype of beauty. Gleiberman wrote that their limited acting abilities made some of their critically derided peers seem like &quot;classical thespians&quot;, which made it difficult to become invested in the core narrative. While Berardinelli concurred with this assessment, he complimented the cast for their efforts, appeal, and enthusiasm in the roles. Verhoeven later said &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; could have benefitted from casting actors for their ability instead of looks. Some critics, such as Berardinelli, said that &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; would not work with good &quot;or even competent&quot; actors. Berardinelli also praised the cast for being &quot;appealing and enthusiastic&quot;, particularly Van Dien and Meyer for retaining some human interest once the special-effects sequences become more prominent.

&quot;Salon&quot;″s review found the violence consistent with Verhoeven&#x27;s previous works, with Gleiberman describing it as offering a &quot;kinky-camp ghoulishness&quot;. Berardinelli and Maslin praised the tension, scale, and impressive visuals of the action sequences, in which Verhoeven revels in the contrast between his characters&#x27; earnestness and the violent and gory imagery. Others, such as Jonathan Rosenbaum and Ebert, wrote that the scenes grew tiresome because the alien creatures had no personality, lacking any culture or discernible language, which rendered them idelogically &quot;boring ciphers&quot; inhabiting uninteresting planets. Despite his praise, Berardinelli said audiences would quickly become desensitized to the extreme gore.

===Accolades===
At the 2nd Golden Satellite Awards in 1998, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was nominated for Best Motion Picture (Animated or Mixed Media). For the 70th Academy Awards, Tippett, Scott E. Anderson, Alec Gillis, and John Richardson were nominated for Best Visual Effects. &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was also nominated for Best Action Sequence at the MTV Movie Awards, as well as receiving a nomination for Best Dramatic Presentation from the Hugo Awards. The film was nominated for Worst Picture at the Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, losing to &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;.

== Post-release ==
===Performance analysis===
Retrospective analyses have attempted to explain the cause of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; poor performance and reception. The film generally failed to connect with both critics and audiences, who found its mixture of satire, violence, gore, and &quot;cheesy&quot; performances unappealing. Other industry experts believe it was also adversely affected by the quantity of successful science fiction and genre films already released that year, such as &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; ($618.6 million) and &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; ($263.9 million). &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was also released just before &quot;Titanic&quot; ($1.8 billion), which dominated theaters, and other anticipated films like &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, &quot;Scream 2&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;. American historian Robert Sklar suggested that audiences had grown tired of alien war films and science fiction adventure in general after the recent releases of &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;, the blockbuster &quot;Independence Day&quot; (both 1996), and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; special editions (1997).

The film&#x27;s reputation was also damaged by a report by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; accusing &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; of promoting Nazism. Verhoeven said: &quot;We were accused ... of being neo-Nazis! ... They couldn&#x27;t see that all I have done is ironically create a fascist utopia.&quot; This narrative was perpetuated in European news publications despite Verhoeven&#x27;s efforts to explain the satirical portrayal of fascism. Verhoeven believed this dissuaded audiences from seeing &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; and, alongside poor word of mouth from audiences that did attend, the U.S. box office gross dropped a then rare 50% in its second weekend. He added that audiences were not happy about Dizzy dying instead of Carmen. The film&#x27;s title was also seen as a contributing factor, leading audiences to expect a light-hearted adventure like &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). Verhoeven blamed the studio&#x27;s poor marketing of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; in the United States by labelling it as an action film, leading critics and audiences to overlook the satire. A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editorial speculated the decision was possibly deliberate because satire films did not perform as well as the action genre. Verhoeven anecdotally remarked that it was appropriately marketed as a satire in England.

===Home media===
The film score was released on compact disc (CD) by Varèse Sarabande in 1997, but was criticized for a short runtime of 30 minutes. Bootleg copies were made containing additional material using the score from the film&#x27;s DVD release. &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was released on VHS in 1998 and on DVD in 1999. The DVD features a documentary about the making of the film, actor screen tests, commentary by Verhoeven and Neumeier, and deleted scenes including an alternate ending in which Rico and Carmen officially rekindle their romance. In 2002, a two-disc Special Edition DVD was released with additional features, including commentary by Verhoeven, Neumeier, and the cast, breakdowns of the special effects, and documentaries about the making of the film, creating the Arachnids and spaceships, the visual effects, and scene breakdowns.

&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was released on Blu-ray in 2008, containing many previously released extras and the addition of FedNet mode, which places a graphic overlay to the film with pop-up facts. A limited edition two-disc CD of the score was released in 2016, containing additional tracks.

A 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray remastered version was released for the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary with previously released extras. A 25th anniversary 4K Blu-ray was released in 2022, in a limited edition steelbook case, and includes a reunion discussion between Neumeier, Van Dien, Richards, Meyer, Ironside, Brown, Busey, and Gilliam.

=== Other media===

Coinciding with its theatrical release, Sony had restructured its business to focus on translating its films, including &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, into media franchises that would extend their profitability beyond their time in theaters. &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; merchandise included miniatures, action figures, and &quot;Insect Touch&quot;, a three-issue comic book by Dark Horse Comics. Toy manufacturer Galoob developed twelve different products including action figures and vehicles. Retailers were reluctant to stock toys for an R-rated film, with both Wal-Mart and Target, which represented about 20% of all action figure sales, declining, although Toys &quot;R&quot; Us and KB Toys agreed. Sony executives called it an &quot;open secret&quot; that children were attending R-rated films. Author Paul Sammon spent six months accompanying filming for &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, through pre-production and leading up to the film&#x27;s release. His resulting work was released alongside the film as &quot;The Making of Starship Troopers&quot;. A CGI animated television series, &quot;&quot;, was released in 1999. Based on elements of the film and Heinlein&#x27;s novel, the series ran for forty episodes.

The 1976 board game &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was re-released and repackaged alongside the film as &quot;Starship Troopers: Prepare for Battle&quot;. A &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; pinball machine was also released in 1997. There have also been several game adaptations based on the film, including &quot;Starship Troopers: Terran Ascendancy&quot; (2000), &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; (2005)—which features Van Dien returning to voice Rico—and &quot;Starship Troopers: Terran Command&quot; (2022).

== Themes and analysis ==
===Politics and propaganda===

&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; explores themes including patriotism, authoritarianism, militarism, colonialism, and xenophobia. Verhoeven interpreted Heinlein&#x27;s novel as fascistic, nationalistic, totalitarian, and in favor of military rule, something antithetical to the director&#x27;s own wartime experiences, and used &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; to deconstruct and undermine these themes. Iconography inspired by the German Nazi regime and Italian National Fascist Party appear throughout &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; as symbols of the United Citizen Federation (UCF). The UCF flag, bearing an eagle, resembles the Nazi coat of arms; officer uniforms are similar to those worn by the Nazi secret police—the Gestapo—including the insignia, and the symbol on infantry uniforms references Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Blackshirts. Neumeier said the Nazi uniforms were used, in part, because the Nazi outfits looked good, but Verhoeven also wanted to use that aesthetic in &quot;an artistic way&quot;. Although some contemporary critics and audiences considered &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; to be an endorsement of fascism, Verhoeven said, &quot;whenever you see something that you think is fascist, you should know that the filmmakers agree with your opinion&quot;. Other aspects of the Nazi regime influence &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, from the architecture of Albert Speer, to propaganda films such as &quot;Olympia&quot;. The first scene of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, an advertisement for the mobile infantry, emulates scenes from &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;, including the dialogue, &quot;I&#x27;m doing my part!&quot;

Influence was also taken from writer Susan Sontag&#x27;s 1975 essay, &quot;Fascinating Fascisms&quot;, that identifies key aspects of Nazism, such as the &quot;cult of beauty&quot;, &quot;fetishism of courage&quot;, &quot;repudiation of the intellect&quot;, and serving the community at the expense of the self. Verhoeven cast attractive actors, described by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic Darren Franich as conveying the Aryan ideal of beauty, to &quot;seduce the audience into joining [&quot;Starship Troopers&quot;] society ... but then ask, &#x27;What are you really joining up for? Screenwriter Mark Rosenthal said that the dangers of exposing the audience to an attractive fascism are necessary to lead them to the possibility of progressive politics. In the novel, Rico is revealed at the end to be Filipino, a deliberate choice to make readers empathise with the character before revealing he is not white. Verhoeven made Rico white to further satirize the fascistic messaging.

Franich and &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; critic Scott Tobias wrote that the filmmakers portray the main characters as &quot;petty and stupid&quot;, but that the film&#x27;s best joke lies in Rico not being very intelligent but, in turn, becoming the ideal citizen and perfect tool for war, abandoning any personal hopes and dreams outside military life. Professor Lene Hansen challenged Verhoeven&#x27;s assertion that &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; portrays a feminist fascism in which men and women are treated entirely equally. Focusing on Dizzy, Hansen wrote that while the character is portrayed as equal to and even superior to male characters as an athlete and soldier, seemingly in service to the greater collective, but her dying words imply her actions are motivated by her feelings for Rico and her sacrifice is therefore romantic, conflicting with the film&#x27;s fascist ideals of collective responsibility and heroic masculinity. Hansen concluded that &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; ultimately reinforces classical fascist gender norms, in which men are central to the narrative and women are secondary or serve a supporting role.

The propaganda depicted on the &quot;FedNet&quot; uses extreme examples to satirize the UCF, such as children holding weapons or stamping on cockroaches while an adult looks on happily, as well as slogans such as &quot;Join the mobile infantry and save the world&quot; and &quot;Service guarantees citizenship&quot;. Writer Darren Mooney considered the FedNet to be prescient of the increasing prominence of fake news, presenting stories that those in positions of power want the populace to see, emphasizing patriotism and duty, while offering an illusion of choice and enlightenment by asking: &quot;Would you like to know more?&quot; Verhoeven said the query begs the question: &quot;Do you want this type of society? Do you want to dive even further into this system that already exists in America?&quot; The youth are indoctrinated through these slogans and propaganda, and information relating to the Arachnids is intended to provoke a xenophobic response, both convincing the protagonists that their cause is righteous and presenting the Arachnids as inferior. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; presents a society that has been convinced to trade its freedoms, rights, and identities for security.

&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is also Verhoeven&#x27;s response to events he perceived in contemporary American politics, such as limited gun restrictions and an increase of capital punishment, which he believed could eventually result in open fascism, as well as films that glorified the U.S. military and depicted a casual attitude to violence. Franich found similarities between &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; and the action film &quot;Top Gun&quot; (1986), which follows physically strong, young, and attractive United States Navy pilots combating a vague enemy. Several action films from the 1990s, such as &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996) and &quot;Air Force One&quot; (1997), offered similarly jingoistic pro-American and pro-military messages.

===Citizenship and violence===
In the militaristic society depicted in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, many rights are reserved only for citizens comprising only those who have served in the military. Voting is presented as an act of force and supreme authority, a right that must be earned instead of given. Rasczak tells his students: &quot;Violence has resolved more conflicts than anything else. The contrary opinion that violence doesn&#x27;t solve anything is merely wishful thinking at worst.&quot; The boot camp shower scene involves several characters discussing their reason for enlistment, such as being able to serve as a politician, have children, receive a scholarship, or just not having to work on a farm. Verhoeven said that the purpose of the scene—one of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; most infamous—is that since all of the characters are fascists, they have no libido and do not react to each other&#x27;s exposure, instead only discussing their careers and combat. The nudity was criticized, but Verhoeven believed it was hypocritical to focus on sexual scenes while allowing the depiction of extreme violence. The film professor Florentine Strzelczyk opined that the infantry&#x27;s sexual energy is redirected into an &quot;orgasmic&quot; violent display of fluids, guts, and gore. The author Leighton Grist wrote that citizenship being a requirement for most procreation is similar to fascist policies of eugenics.

Although humanity is mainly presented as victims of the Arachnid threat, aspects of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; reveal that humanity may have instigated the conflict by invading Arachnid worlds, and the creatures are defending themselves. The Arachnid&#x27;s asteroid that strikes Earth is used to justify a full-scale war. In her analysis, Strzelczyk identified critical commentary of the war provided by a journalist who queries if humans provoked the Arachnids and whether both species should leave the other alone. However, when the journalist is killed by an Arachnid in a bloody display, his critique is visually erased and his reconciliatory opinion invalidated.

&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; presents a cycle of war, in which Earth&#x27;s youths are emboldened by the propaganda slogans to become readily disposable infantry. These soldiers&#x27; orders are to kill anything inhuman and strategic failures are solved by using more soldiers. The writer Lloyd Farley considered the gory and explicit scenes depicting the dead as being intended to overtly display the &quot;horrors of war&quot; in a society solely dedicated to conflict. The countless soldier deaths on Planet P are quickly forgotten as troops celebrate their victory and capture of the Brain Bug, with the potential promise this will lead to the end of the war, but no actual conclusion is offered. The Brain Bug suggests the Arachnids are not significantly different to and are justified in exterminating humanity to preserve their own race. This violence is reinforced with rewards, such as Rico&#x27;s repeated promotions, but these openings often arise because his predecessor was killed. &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; culminates with the surviving protagonists not disagreeing with this system or choosing to fight against it, but becoming a part of it by appearing in recruitment propaganda to enlist the next generation of troops.

==Legacy==
=== Critical reassessment ===
In a 2013 retrospective by &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, critic Calum Marsh said that while &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; critical reputation had not improved significantly since its release, it was gradually shifting in a positive direction, with some critics and writers considering it an &quot;unsung masterpiece&quot;. Other retrospective analyses, from the early 2000s to the 2020s, described it as among the most subversive and misunderstood Hollywood studio films ever made, undermined by critics and audiences who misinterpreted the anti-fascist satire as an endorsement. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; and &quot;The Verge&quot; in 2020, described it as an obvious satire, in hindsight, that was released at the wrong time, amid an era of prosperity in the United States during the late 1990s when American audiences may not have seen, or wanted to see, the criticisms of their own society. The marketing was also blamed, which presented &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; as a typical science fiction action film, making it easy for audiences not expecting satire to misinterpret it. Other publications argued that &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was an example of Poe&#x27;s law, where views are presented to such an extreme that it becomes impossible for audiences to understand if it is parody or serious. A 2024 analysis by &quot;Vice&quot; described the modern discourse as divided between those who praise &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; satire, and those who believe that, despite the satire, the film ultimately glorifies the &quot;Aryan characters, their militarized society, and their fight against the supposedly inhuman bugs.&quot;

Opinions on the film changed alongside societal shifts, making the satire more obvious, particularly in the 2010s as its critiques of right-wing militarism, the military–industrial complex, reactionary violence, and American jingoism made it seem ahead of its time. In a 2020 retrospective for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, David Roth argued that &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; message had become more meaningful because it presents a narrative in which humanity, built on a culture of fascism and violence, &quot;gets its ass kicked&quot;, and its only solution is to inflict more violence, to little success. Roth further contrasted the culture of violence to contemporary police brutality against peaceful protests or government attempts to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic through sheer will.

&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is now considered a cult classic. Some publications have listed it among the best science fiction films ever made, and as one of the best films of the 1990s. In 2021, the British Film Institute (BFI) named it one of the ten greatest science fiction adaptations. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes offers a approval rating from the aggregated reviews of critics, with an average score of . The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A fun movie...if you can accept the excessive gore and wooden acting.&quot; The film has a score of 51 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 20 critics&#x27; reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

===Cultural influence===
&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; has continued to generate interest in the decades since its release because of elements which came to reflect future events, such as the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and the subsequent actions of the U.S. government and president George W. Bush to convince the American people to surrender certain liberties to enable the subsequent war on terror and defeat their enemies. Retrospectives in the late 2010s and early 2020s have described how a contemporary rise in fascist activity in the U.S. had made &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; seem prescient and more of a warning than satire. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; described &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; as a &quot;brilliant dissection&quot; of wars and how propaganda is used to justify young people being sent to their deaths against a dehumanized enemy. A 2020 retrospective by &quot;The Guardian&quot; suggested that, with hindsight, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; formed the final installment of Verhoeven&#x27;s unofficial science fiction action film trilogy about authoritarian governance, preceded by &quot;RoboCop&quot; (1987) and &quot;Total Recall&quot; (1990). &quot;Empire&quot; called it the true spiritual successor to &quot;RoboCop&quot;″s &quot;savage satire&quot; and &quot;gonzo violence&quot;, unlike that film&#x27;s own sequels.

Verhoeven followed &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; with the 2000 science fiction horror &quot;Hollow Man&quot;, a film that he believed lacked his own personal style as he acquiesced to studio demands. Disillusioned with the Hollywood studio system, and compounded by the failures of &quot;Showgirls&quot; and &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, Verhoeven returned to Europe to work outside of the Hollywood studio system, going on to earn acclaim for his subsequent works, such as &quot;Black Book&quot; (2006) and &quot;Elle&quot; (2016). In 2015, Van Dien remarked: &quot;There has not been a week in my life since I did [&quot;Starship Troopers&quot;] where I can go down the street without someone going &#x27;Rico! Richards has said she loved her character and how people responded to her as a strong female character.

Several filmmakers and some actors have named it as an influence or among their favorite films, including Ari Aster, Margaret Brown, Macaulay Culkin, Takashi Miike, David Lowery, Robert Rodriguez, Eli Roth, Riley Stearns, Quentin Tarantino, James Wan, and Edgar Wright. Slogans used in the film, such as &quot;I&#x27;m doing my part!&quot; and &quot;Would you like to know more?&quot;, have become part of the cultural lexicon. The film&#x27;s influence can also be seen in other media, such as the animated &quot;Futurama&quot; (&quot;War Is the H-Word&quot;, 2000), the anime &quot;Kaguya-sama: Love Is War&quot; (2019–2022), and the video game &quot;Helldivers 2&quot; (2024). The popularity of &quot;Helldivers 2&quot; led to a resurgence of interest in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;.

== Sequels and remake ==

Verhoeven had never developed a sequel to his films, but he was interested in directing a second &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; installment. The relative failure of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; derailed plans for a theatrical sequel and Verhoeven moved on to other projects. &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was followed by two low-budget, direct-to-home media sequels. The first, &quot;Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation&quot; (2004), was directed by Tippett from a script by Neumeier and followed new characters. Neumeier wrote and directed the second sequel, &quot;Starship Troopers 3: Marauder&quot; (2008), for which Van Dien reprised his role as Rico. The series narrative was continued in two CGI animated films: &quot;Starship Troopers: Invasion&quot; (2012) sees the return of Rico, Jenkins, and Ibanez (with different voice actors), while &quot;Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars&quot; (2017) was written by Neumeier and features voice acting by Van Dien and Meyer.

In the early 2010s, it was reported that the film series could be rebooted to more closely align with Heinlein&#x27;s novel; there have been no updates since 2016. Verhoeven was unhappy with the concept. In 2021, Van Dien said a television adaptation was being considered by Sony Pictures Television, although talks had stalled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="203843" wikidata="Q31874734" url="?curid=203843" title="Northern shrike">
<text>The northern shrike (Lanius borealis) is a large songbird species in the shrike family (Laniidae) native to North America and Siberia. Long considered a subspecies of the great grey shrike, it was classified as a distinct species in 2017. Six subspecies are recognised.

==Taxonomy==
The northern shrike was formally described by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1808 under its present binomial name &quot;Lanius borealis&quot;. In the 19th century, North American ornithologists considered it as a separate species from the great grey shrike, while European authorities held them to be the same species. American ornithologist Alden H. Miller investigated differences between the Siberian and Alaskan populations in 1930 and could find no consistent differences, hence he recommended combining the two into &quot;Lanius excubitor&quot;.

In North America, this and the related loggerhead shrike are commonly known as butcherbirds for their habit of impaling prey on thorns or spikes. A folk name from Michigan is winter butcherbird. The Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation people of Old Crow, Yukon call it &quot;Tzi kwut go katshi lyi&quot;. As a passerine, or song bird, it has no talons. It has the hooked beak of a raptor.

A 2010 study of mitochondrial DNA found that the northern shrike was most closely related to the Iberian grey shrike (&quot;Lanius meridionalis&quot;), the steppe grey shrike (&quot;Lanius pallidirostris&quot;), and the two formed a clade along with the Chinese grey shrike and loggerhead shrike.

===Subspecies===
East Eurasian group
* &quot;Lanius borealis sibiricus&quot; – eastern Siberia to northern Mongolia
:Browner above than &quot;excubitor&quot;, distinct but delicate banding below. Some white on primary bases only.
* &quot;Lanius borealis bianchii&quot; – Sakhalin and possibly southern Kuril Islands
:Smaller and paler than &quot;sibiricus&quot;, banding below pale and indistinct. Some white on primary bases only.
* &quot;Lanius borealis mollis&quot; – Russian Altai Mountains, north western Mongolia

:Browner than &quot;sibiricus&quot; above, banding below well-developed. Little white on primary bases.
* &quot;Lanius borealis funereus&quot; – Tian Shan and western China
:Large; quite dark and brownish, below bluish-grey with almost black banding. Little white on primary bases.

North American group
* &quot;Lanius borealis borealis&quot; – Hudson Bay region of Ontario and Quebec
:Similar to &quot;excubitor&quot;, but darker with faint barring below. John James Audubon called this subspecies the great American shrike in his book &quot;Birds of America&quot;.
* &quot;Lanius borealis invictus&quot; – northern Alberta west to northern Alaska, perhaps also Chukchi Peninsula region in extreme north east Siberia
:Larger and paler than &quot;borealis&quot;, paralleling &quot;homeyeri&quot; compared to &quot;excubitor&quot;.

==Description==
The loggerhead shrike can be distinguished from the northern shrike by its smaller size, darker grey plumage and larger black face mask that covers the eye completely. It also has a shorter bill with less prominent hook. Their calls are similar.

Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

==Distribution and habitat==
Observations of wintering habitats in Idaho suggest suitable wintering territories are in demand, as northern shrikes that died in a particular area were quickly replaced.

==Feeding==
Northern shrikes often sit on tall poles and branches surveying for food. They prey on arthropods such as spiders, beetles, bugs, and grasshoppers, and small vertebrates. Prey identified include passerine birds such as horned lark, black-capped chickadee, common starling, brewer&#x27;s sparrow, white-crowned sparrow, dark-eyed junco, pine siskin, house sparrow, small mammals such as the vagrant shrew, western harvest mouse, deer mouse, long-tailed vole, meadow vole and house mouse, and reptiles such as spiny lizards. They have been observed hunting finches and house sparrows at bird feeders. They are known to lure small birds by imitating their calls.

<text>Phillips Exeter Academy (often called Exeter or PEA) is an independent, co-educational, college-preparatory school in Exeter, New Hampshire. Established in 1781, it is America&#x27;s sixth-oldest boarding school. It educates roughly 1,100 boarding and day students in grades 9 through 12, as well as postgraduate students. 

Exeter is one of the nation&#x27;s wealthiest boarding schools, with a financial endowment of $1.6 billion as of June 2024, and houses the world&#x27;s largest high school library. The academy admits students on a need-blind basis and offers free tuition to students with family incomes under $125,000. Its list of notable alumni includes U.S. President Franklin Pierce, U.S. Senator Daniel Webster, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and three winners of the Nobel Prize.

==History==
=== Origins ===
Phillips Exeter Academy was established in 1781 by John and Elizabeth Phillips, prominent citizens of Exeter, New Hampshire. It is the nation&#x27;s sixth-oldest boarding school.

John Phillips had earned degrees from Harvard College and came to Exeter as a young man in 1741, initially as a teacher. He made his fortune as a merchant and banker, and gained influence over time as an advisor to the colonial governor, circuit court judge, elected representative, and senior militia officer in the years leading up to the Revolutionary War. In 1778, he supported his nephew, Samuel Phillips Jr., financially when the latter founded Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, about 40 miles away. As result of this original family relationship, the two schools share a friendly and historic rivalry. John Phillips stipulated in Exeter&#x27;s founding charter that it would &quot;ever be equally open to youth of requisite qualifications from every quarter.&quot;

The new academy benefited from donors besides John Phillips. Phillips had previously been married to Sarah Gilman, the wealthy widow of Phillips&#x27; cousin, Nathaniel Gilman, whose large fortune, bequeathed to Phillips, enabled him to endow the academy. The Gilman family also donated to the academy much of the land on which it stands, including the initial 1793 grant by New Hampshire Governor John Taylor Gilman of the Yard, the oldest part of campus; the academy&#x27;s first class in 1783 included seven Gilmans. In 1814, Nicholas Gilman, signer of the U.S. Constitution, left $1,000 to Exeter to teach sacred music.The academy&#x27;s first schoolhouse, the First Academy Building, was built on a site on Tan Lane in 1783, and today stands not far from its original location. The building was dedicated on February 20, 1783, the same day that the school&#x27;s first Preceptor, William Woodbridge, was chosen by John Phillips.

Exeter&#x27;s &quot;Deed of Gift,&quot; written by John Phillips at the founding of the school, states that Exeter&#x27;s mission is to instill in its students both goodness and knowledge:
=== 19th Century ===
In the early 1800s, a deep religious divide opened up between Unitarian Harvard and Calvinist Yale. As a result, Unitarian-friendly Exeter developed a closer relationship with Harvard and Calvinist-friendly Andover with Yale. Although originally, most Exeter graduates did not go on to further formal education (as with most 18th and 19th Century secondary schools), the ones that did placed at Harvard in substantial numbers. From 1846 to 1870, Exeter supplanted Boston Latin School as Harvard&#x27;s largest feeder school, supplying 16% of all Harvard students during that period. In the latter half of the 19th century, graduates of Exeter and the now-defunct Adams Academy of Quincy, Massachusetts were &quot;dominant socially&quot; on Harvard Yard.

Exeter&#x27;s first recorded minority student was Moses Uriah Hall, a young Black man, who entered the Academy in 1858, served in the Union Army during the Civil War, and was known for many years as a skilled stonemason and businessman in nearby Epping, New Hampshire. Exeter&#x27;s official records indicate that six years later, five White students from a border state, Kentucky, threatened to leave the Academy because another young Black man had enrolled as a member of their class. Exeter&#x27;s Principal at the time, Gideon Lane Soule, is said to have told them &quot;You may do as you please — your classmate will stay.&quot;

After a brief interlude in the 1880s when Exeter&#x27;s focus partially shifted from college preparation to general education and only 18% of Exeter students went on to college, Charles Everett Fish (p. 1890–95) restored academic standards by adopting a policy of expelling students who could not attain a C average. A student in the Class of 1892 recalled that &quot;[t]here was no real discipline ... the only measure of a boy&#x27;s quality was his scholarship. If that was satisfactory, little else mattered.&quot; The percentages of students going on to college recovered rapidly to 1870s levels, although the student body shrank significantly, dropping from 355 in 1890 to 123 in 1895.Fish&#x27;s successor Harlan Page Amen (p. 1895–1913) solidified Exeter&#x27;s mission as a college-preparatory school. Amen cleaned up Exeter&#x27;s social image, as the student body had acquired a reputation for unruly behavior. He doubled tuition from $75 to $150 between 1895 and 1899, and claimed in 1903 that he had expelled 400 boys in eight years. He also improved the academy&#x27;s residential facilities; by 1903 two-thirds of Exeter students were living on campus. Despite the expulsions, Exeter&#x27;s new-look mission resonated with parents, and enrollment jumped to 390 in 1903 and 572 in 1913. From 1890 to 1894, 67% of Exeter&#x27;s college-bound students went on to Harvard, Yale or Princeton. 60-odd years later, in 1953, the corresponding number was 67% for the entire academy.

From 1879 to 1881, Exeter (and several other schools) participated in the Chinese Educational Mission, hosting students from Qing China who were sent to the United States to learn about Western technology. However, all students were recalled after just 2 years due to mounting tensions between the United States and China, as well as growing concern within the Chinese government that the students were becoming Americanized.

===Harkness Gift and financial independence===
Lewis Perry was appointed principal in 1914 and ran the academy until 1946. Although his early years were marked by grave financial difficulties, including a $200,000 bill to rebuild the Academy Building (destroyed by fire five months into Perry&#x27;s administration) and the disruption of World War I, he had a &quot;talent for getting wealthy men to part with their money.&quot; A professional fundraiser, he did not teach classes; instead, he &quot;spen[t] much time away from school spreading Exeter&#x27;s fame and obtaining endowments.&quot; Exeter&#x27;s endowment increased ninefold during his tenure. In 1936, Exeter boasted an $8 million endowment for roughly 700 students, making it the richest boarding school in New England in both absolute and per capita terms.

Perry used the money to improve student quality of life, expand access for the underrepresented, and build a more cohesive and higher-achieving student body. Under Perry&#x27;s leadership, Exeter was able to provide housing for all its students for the first time. Perry also adopted a policy that scholarship students should comprise at least 20% of the student body. He imposed greater restrictions on students&#x27; after-class activities, culminating in the abolition of fraternities in 1940. Perhaps counterintuitively, these restrictions limited the number of disciplinary cases and helped students improve their academics. From 1922 to 1931, the number of students expelled or asked to leave for academic reasons declined from 136 to 40. When Perry retired, the school educated 725 boys.

Despite Perry&#x27;s reforms, Exeter retained a certain informality, which was reflected in the school&#x27;s &quot;unwritten code that there were no rules at the academy until you broke one.&quot; Expelled alumni include the journalist David Lamb and the writer and editor George Plimpton.
Perry&#x27;s largest financial windfall came on April 9, 1930, when philanthropist and oil magnate Edward Harkness wrote to Perry to propose a new way of teaching and learning, for which Harkness would donate funds to foot the bill:

The result was &quot;The Harkness Method,&quot; in which a teacher and a group of students work together, exchanging ideas and information in a seminar setting. In November 1930, Harkness gave Exeter $5.8 million (approximately $110 million in February 2024 dollars) to support this initiative. To support the more intensive teaching style, Exeter&#x27;s faculty grew from 32 teachers in 1914 to 82 in 1946. In addition, through Harkness&#x27; largesse, the academy was able to avoid cutting faculty salaries during the Great Depression, making it a rarity among boarding schools.

Since 1930, Exeter&#x27;s principal mode of instruction has been by discussion, &quot;seminar style,&quot; around an oval table known as the Harkness Table. Today, all classes are taught using this method, with no more than 12 students per class.

=== More recent history ===
William Saltonstall &#x27;24 (p. 1946-63) succeeded Perry and continued Perry&#x27;s successful fundraising record. He began his tenure by completing a $5.6 million ($72 million in February 2024 dollars) fundraising drive, ending in 1948. Later that year, J. P. Morgan partner Thomas W. Lamont &#x27;88 (the former president of the board of trustees) left Exeter another $3.5 million in his will. 

Under Saltonstall, the academy maintained strong ties to elite universities, although like nearly all boarding schools, it lost ground to public schools during this period. Exeter served as one of the testing grounds for the Advanced Placement program, and in 1957, it produced 11 of the 30 incoming Harvard students with enough AP credit to enter as sophomores. In addition, in 1963 Exeter produced 73 National Merit Scholarship finalists, the most in the nation. However, elite universities relentlessly pushed Exeter to tighten academic standards even further, as Harvard&#x27;s appetite for Exeter graduates meant that the top cut of Exeter students did not reflect the full breadth of the academy&#x27;s contingent at Harvard. (In 1955, Harvard admitted 79% of applicants from Exeter and Andover; by contrast, in 1957, 30% of recent Exeter graduates made the dean&#x27;s list at Harvard, compared to 40% for the entire freshman class.) Due to a surge of applicants from public schools, Exeter students no longer enjoyed near-automatic admission to the colleges of their choice. From 1953 to 1963, the percentage of Exeter graduates admitted to Harvard, Yale, or Princeton declined by a third, from 67% to 42%.

Faced with a decline in applicants, the academy responded by broadening its student body. In 1969, Exeter stopped requiring students to attend a weekly religious service. In 1970, it became coeducational; it later appointed its first female principal (Kendra Stearns O&#x27;Donnell) in 1987. In 1996, to reflect the academy&#x27;s coeducational status, a new gender-inclusive Latin inscription &quot;Hic Quaerite Pueri Puellaeque Virtutem et Scientiam&quot; (&quot;Here, boys and girls, seek goodness and knowledge&quot;) was added over the main entrance to the Academy Building. This new inscription augments the original one—&quot;Huc Venite, Pueri, ut Viri Sitis&quot; (&quot;Come hither boys so that ye may become men&quot;). In 1999, 55% of incoming Exeter students came from public schools.

On January 25, 2019, William K. Rawson &#x27;71 was appointed by the academy&#x27;s trustees as the 16th Principal Instructor. He is the fourth alumnus of Exeter to serve as Principal, after Gideon Lane Soule (1838–1873), Harlan Amen (1895–1913), and William Saltonstall (1946–1963). In 2021, Rawson announced that Exeter would adopt a need-blind admissions policy, following a $90 million fundraising campaign to support financial aid. In 2025, Rawson announced that he would retire at the end of the 2025-26 school year.

=== College admissions ===

In the later half of the 20th century, criteria for U.S. college and university admissions evolved to include more meritocratic considerations and an emphasis on wider demographic factors. Exeter reports that while 10 or more students attended seven of the eight Ivy League colleges (ex. Dartmouth) and MIT between the years 2022-24, 10 or more students also attended Boston College, Bowdoin, GWU, Georgetown, NYU, Northeastern, Tufts, UChicago, USC, and Wesleyan.

==Academics==

=== Courses and grading ===
Exeter uses an 11-point grading system, in which an A is worth 11 points and an E is worth 0 points. The academy&#x27;s student-teacher ratio is 6:1, and 93% of Exeter faculty have postgraduate degrees.

Students who attend Exeter for four years are required to take courses in the arts, classical or modern languages, computer science, English, health &amp; human development, history, mathematics, religion, and science. Most students receive an English diploma, but students who take the full series of Latin and Ancient Greek classes receive a Classical diploma.

Although Exeter administrators helped originate the Advanced Placement program, Exeter no longer offers AP courses, asserting that some of its courses &quot;go well beyond the AP curriculum&quot; and often reach &quot;the pace and level of college courses.&quot; Exeter was one of the first private schools to begin phasing out AP classes, starting in the early 2000s.

===Harkness teaching method===
Most classes at Exeter are taught seminar-style around Harkness Tables with no more than 10-12 students per class period. No classrooms have rows of desks or chairs, and lectures are uncommon. The completion of the Phelps Science Center in 2001 enabled all science classes, which previously had been taught in more conventional classrooms, to be conducted around the same Harkness Tables. Elements of the Harkness Method, including the Harkness Table, are now used in many independent schools around the world.

===Test scores===
The Class of 2024&#x27;s average combined SAT score was 1440 (717 reading, 723 math). Although Exeter does not offer AP courses, its students may take AP exams if they wish; the Class of 2023&#x27;s pass rate was 94%.

===Off-campus study===
During the tenure of Exeter&#x27;s tenth principal, Richard W. Day, the Washington Intern Program and the Foreign Studies Program began. Exeter offers the Washington Intern Program, where students intern in the office of a senator or congressional representative. Exeter also participates in the Milton Academy Mountain School program, which allows students to study in a small rural setting in Vershire, Vermont. The academy currently sponsors trimester-long foreign study programs in Grenoble, Tema, Tokyo, Saint Petersburg, Stratford-upon-Avon, Eleuthera, Taichung, Göttingen, Rome, Cuenca, and Callan; as well as school-year abroad programs in Beijing, Rennes, Viterbo, and Zaragoza. The academy also offers foreign language summer programs in France, Japan, Spain, and Taiwan.

==Student body==
=== Admissions ===
Exeter typically accepts 14–18% of applicants annually, including 18% in 2024. The admission rate briefly dropped to 10% during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2024, 78.5% of admitted students chose to enroll at Exeter.

Exeter has admitted students on a need-blind basis since 2021. In the 2023–2024 school year, 13% of the students were legacy students. 

=== Grade levels ===
In the 2024–2025 school year, Exeter enrolled 225 freshmen (in academy jargon, &quot;juniors&quot; or &quot;preps&quot;), 252 sophomores (&quot;lower middlers&quot; or &quot;lowers&quot;), 304 juniors (&quot;upper middlers&quot; or &quot;uppers&quot;), and 325 seniors and postgraduates (&quot;seniors&quot; and &quot;PGs&quot;), for a total enrollment of 1,106 students.

=== Diversity ===

Exeter enrolls a racially and ethnically diverse student body. In the 2024–2025 school year, 57.1% of Exeter students identified as students of color. In the 2019–2020 school year, 52% of the academy&#x27;s 314 incoming students previously attended U.S. public schools.

In September 2024, the Exeter student body included students from 44 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and 32 countries. 9.9% of students are international students, and another 6.2% are U.S. citizens residing outside the United States.

Most Exeter students (81%) live on campus. The remaining 19% are day students who commute to Exeter from nearby communities.

==Finances==
===Tuition and financial aid===
In the 2024–2025 school year, Exeter charged boarding students $67,315 and day students $52,577. 45% of Exeter students are on financial aid, which covers, on average, $56,315 for boarders and $37,770 for day students.

Exeter admits students on a need-blind basis and commits to offering financial aid that covers 100% of demonstrated financial need. Since 2008, Exeter has also guaranteed free tuition for families with incomes under a certain threshold. In 2024, Exeter raised the threshold from $75,000 to $125,000. 

===Endowment and expenses===
Exeter&#x27;s financial endowment stands at $1.6 billion as of June 30, 2024. In its Internal Revenue Service filings for the 2021-22 school year, Exeter reported total assets of $1.91 billion, net assets of $1.71 billion, investment holdings of $1.22 billion, and cash holdings of $242.6 million. Exeter also reported $124.0 million in program service expenses and $25.3 million in grants (primarily student financial aid).

==Campus facilities==

===Academic facilities===
* The Academy Building (1914) is the fourth such building, and was built after the third burned down. Designed by Exeter alumnus Ralph Adams Cram, the Academy Building houses the History, Math, Religion and Classical Languages departments, along with an archaeology/anthropology museum. In the 1920s and 1930s, Lewis Perry expanded the building to add the Assembly Hall (formerly the Chapel) and connect it to the Mayer Art Center (formerly Alumni Hall).
** Mayer Art Center (1903) houses the Art Department and the Lamont Gallery, as well as the College Counseling Office. It contains a large ceramics studio with approximately twenty wheels and three kilns on the first floor, two printmaking studios and three drawing/painting studios on the second floor, and an architectural and 3-D design studio on the third floor. The school purchased a 3-D printer in 2013.
* The Class of 1945 Library (1972) is the largest secondary-school library in the world, with a shelf capacity of 250,000 volumes. In 2007, a public vote ranked Louis Kahn&#x27;s Brutalist design #80 on the 2007 list of &quot;America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable called the building a &quot;stunning paean to books.&quot;
*Elizabeth Phillips Academy Center (EPAC) (2006), formerly the Phelps Center, serves as the academy&#x27;s student center. It houses a student commons, post office, day student lounge, academic support center, student grill, and the Forum (a 300-person auditorium). It also hosts several student organizations.

===Other facilities===

* Phillips Church was originally built as the Second Parish Church in 1897 and was purchased by the academy in 1922. The building was designed by Ralph Adams Cram. Although originally a church, the building now contains spaces for students of many faiths. It includes a Hindu shrine, a Muslim prayer room and ablutions fountain, a kosher kitchen, and a meditation room. Services that are particular to Phillips Church include Evening Prayer on Tuesday nights, Thursday Meditation, and Indaba—a religious open forum.
* Nathaniel Gilman House (1740) houses the academy&#x27;s Alumni and Alumnae Affairs and Development Office. This home, as well as the Benjamin Clark Gilman House which is also owned by the academy, were built for the Gilman family, a group of prominent Exeter donors. The Gilman House is a large colonial white clapboard home with a gambrel roof hipped at one end, a leaded fanlight over the front door and a wide panelled entry hall.
* The Davis Center, formerly a library, houses financial aid offices. It was designed by Ralph Adams Cram.

==Athletics==

Exeter offers 65 interscholastic sports teams at the varsity and junior varsity level, 27 intramural sports teams, and various fitness classes. All students are required to participate in athletics.

Basketball, water polo, wrestling, swimming, cycling, soccer, squash, cross country, crew, and ice hockey teams have won recent New England championships.

Exeter has graduated multiple elite athletes in the past few decades. For example, crew Olympians include Anne Marden &#x27;76, Rajanya Shah &#x27;92, Sabrina Kolker &#x27;98, and Andréanne Morin &#x27;02. Georgia Gould is an Olympic medalist in mountain biking, while Joy Fahrenkrog is a member of the United States Archery Team. Duncan Robinson plays for the Miami Heat in the National Basketball Association. Tom Cavanagh played in the National Hockey League. Sam Fuld played 8 years of Major League Baseball, and became the General Manager of the Philadelphia Phillies in 2020.

Exeter&#x27;s main athletic rival is Phillips Academy, better known as Andover. The two schools have been competing against each other in both baseball and football since 1878 (in those first games, Exeter defeated Andover 12–0 in baseball, while Andover won the football game, 22-0). Today, Exeter-Andover weekend is still a large tradition in both schools.

Other athletic opponents include a variety of New England private schools such as Belmont Hill School, Berwick Academy, Deerfield Academy, Northfield Mount Hermon, Brewster Academy, Choate Rosemary Hall, Groton School, The Governor&#x27;s Academy, Loomis Chaffee, Tabor Academy, Milton Academy, Avon Old Farms, Worcester Academy, Cushing Academy, and various other northeastern prep and boarding schools.

==Student life==
The academy has over 100 clubs listed. The number of functioning and reputable clubs fluctuates; several of the listed clubs on the website do not hold tables on Club Night. &quot;The Exonian&quot; is the school&#x27;s weekly newspaper. It is the oldest continuously running preparatory school newspaper in the United States, having begun publishing in 1878. Recently, &quot;The Exonian&quot; began online publication. The Exonian has been a finalist for a National Pacemaker Award several times, winning in 2007. Other long-established clubs include ESSO, which focuses on social service outreach, and the PEAN, which is the academy&#x27;s yearbook. Exeter also has the oldest surviving secondary school society, the Golden Branch (founded in 1818), a society for public speaking, inspired by PEA&#x27;s Rhetorical Society of 1807–1820. Now known as the Daniel Webster Debate Society, these groups served as America&#x27;s first secondary school organization for oratory. The Model UN club has won the &quot;Best Small Delegation&quot; award at HMUN. Exeter&#x27;s Mock Trial Association, founded by attorney and historian Walter Stahr, has since 2011 claimed seventeen individual titles, five all-around state titles, and a top-ten spot at the National High School Mock Trial Championship.

Close to 80% of students live in the dormitories, with the other 20% commuting from homes within a radius. Each residence hall has several faculty members and senior student proctors. There are check-in hours of 8:00 pm (for first- and second-year students), 9:00pm (for third years), and 10:00 pm (for seniors) during the weekdays and 11:00 pm on Saturday night.

Religious life on campus is supported by the Religious Services Department, which provides a vintage stone chapel and a full-service ministry for the spiritual needs of students. The chapel was originally built in 1895 and has been updated. It accommodates worship for &quot;twelve religious traditions including Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Quaker, Buddhist, Catholic among others&quot; as well as Secular Humanism.

Weekly attendance at the religious service of their choice was required of students until 1969, after which religion at Exeter stagnated until it was revived by a new approach &quot;as concerned with the religious dimension of all of our lives as it is with the particular religious needs of any one of us.&quot; A renovation of Phillips Church, completed in 2002, provided spaces for worship and meditation for students of diverse religious persuasions.

==Sexual misconduct==
An incident of student misconduct that occurred in the basement of Phillips Church in late 2015 brought criticism to the Academy. An in-depth investigation uncovered sexual misconduct that had occurred at Exeter since the 1970s and involved at least 11 members of the faculty and staff. The report harshly criticized the school for not supporting victims when they reported incidents and for a pattern of not including these allegations in faculty members&#x27; files. In April 2016, Exeter hired the law firm of Holland &amp; Knight LLP to investigate allegations of past misconduct by Exeter faculty and staff. A report was released in August 2018 providing an overview of the investigation and its findings.

Through this process, Holland &amp; Knight was assigned and completed 28 investigations. Of those 28 matters, 26 involved reported misconduct of a sexual nature by an Exeter faculty or staff member towards an Exeter student occurring at various points from the 1950s to the 2010s. During the course of these investigations, Holland &amp; Knight conducted approximately 294 interviews of over 170 individuals. The persons interviewed were located in various states, as well as overseas. According to the findings, the school maintained two sets of files, and would keep the more sensitive material away from Human Resources and prospective employers. Some of these faculty members would then leave Exeter but get hired at other boarding schools. In at least one case, the teacher then molested students at their next school. The allegations involve staffers who have since been fired, left the school or have died. Several have been named in the past by the school. In a 2018 letter, senior Exeter officials apologized to the school community, including victims who have come forward and those who have remained silent.

==Emblems==

===Academy seal===
Exeter has two chief symbols: a seal depicting a river, sun and beehive, incorporating the academy&#x27;s mottos; and the &quot;Lion Rampant&quot;. The seal has similarities to that used by Phillips Academy—an emblem designed by Paul Revere—and its imagery is Masonic in nature. A beehive often represented the industry and cooperation of a lodge or, in this case, the studies and united efforts of Academy students. The &quot;Lion Rampant&quot; is derived from the Phillips family&#x27;s coat of arms, and suggests that all of the academy&#x27;s alumni are part of the &quot;Exonian family&quot;.

Exeter has three mottoes on the academy seal: &quot;Non Sibi&quot; (Latin &#x27;Not for oneself&#x27;) indicating a life based on community and duty; &quot;Finis origine pendet&quot; (Latin &#x27;The end depends on the beginning&#x27;) reflecting Exeter&#x27;s emphasis on hard work as preparation for a fruitful adult life; and &quot;Χάριτι Θεοῦ&quot; (Greek &#x27;By the grace of God&#x27;) reflecting Exeter&#x27;s Calvinist origins, of which the only remnant today is the school&#x27;s requirement that most students take two courses in religion or philosophy.

===School colors and the alumnus tie===
There are several variants of school colors associated with Phillips Exeter Academy that range from crimson red and white to burgundy red and silver. Black is also a color associated with the school to a lesser extent. The official school colors are lively maroon and gray. The traditional school tie is a burgundy red tie with alternating diagonal silver stripes and silver lions rampant. The school’s athletic teams today wear the Pantone Matching System color PMS201.

==Notable alumni==

Early alumni of Exeter include US Senator Daniel Webster (1796); John Adams Dix (1809) a Secretary of the Treasury and Governor of New York; US President Franklin Pierce (1820); physician and founder of Sigma Pi Phi Henry McKee Minton (1851); Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s son and 35th Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln (1860); Ulysses S.

==Other academic programs==

===Summer school===
Each summer, Phillips Exeter hosts over 780 students from various schools for a five-week program of academic study. The summer program accommodates a diverse student body typically derived from over 40 different states and 45 foreign countries.

Exeter&#x27;s summer school is divided into two programs of study: Upper School, which offers a wide variety of classes to students currently enrolled in high school who are entering grades ten through 12 as well as serving postgraduates; and Access Exeter, a program for students entering grades eight and nine, which offers accelerated study in the arts, sciences and writing as well as serving as an introduction to the school itself. Access Exeter curriculum consists of six academic clusters; each cluster consists of three courses organized around a focused central theme. Some of Exeter&#x27;s summer school programs also give students the opportunity to experience studies outside of Exeter&#x27;s campus environment, including interactions with other top schools and students, experience with Washington D.C., and travel abroad.

===Workshops===
The academy offers a number of workshops and conferences for secondary school educators. These include the Exeter Math Institute; the Exeter Humanities Institute; the Math, Science and Technology Conference; the Exeter Astronomy Conference; and the Shakespeare Conference.

The &quot;On Beyond Exeter&quot; program offers one-week seminars for alumni. Most courses are held at the academy, but some meet in the locations central to the course&#x27;s topic.

===Historical endeavors===
In 1952, Exeter, Andover, Lawrenceville, Harvard, Princeton and Yale published the study &quot;General Education in School and College: A Committee Report&quot;. The report recommended examinations that would place students after admission to college. This program evolved into the Advanced Placement Program.

In 1965 Exeter became the second charter member (after Andover) of the School Year Abroad program. The program allows students to reside and study a foreign language abroad.

==In popular culture==
Several works are based on Exeter and portray the lives of its students. Many are written by alumni who disguise Exeter&#x27;s name, but not its character, such as John Knowles &#x27;45&#x27;s novel &quot;A Separate Peace&quot;, and John Irving &#x27;61&#x27;s &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot;.

<text>Buteo is a genus of medium to fairly large, wide-ranging raptors with a robust body and broad wings. In the Old World, members of this genus are called &quot;[[buzzard]]s&quot;, but &quot;[[hawk]]&quot; is used in the New World (Etymology: &quot;Buteo&quot; is the Latin name of the common buzzard). As both terms are ambiguous, buteo is sometimes used instead, for example, by the Peregrine Fund.

== Characteristics ==
Buteos are fairly large birds. Total length can vary from and wingspan can range from . The lightest known species is the roadside hawk, at an average of although the lesser known white-rumped and Ridgway&#x27;s hawks are similarly small in average wingspan around , and average length around in standard measurements. The largest species in length and wingspan is the upland buzzard, which averages around in length and in wingspan. The upland is rivaled in weight and outsized in foot measurements and bill size by the ferruginous hawk. In both of these largest buteos, adults typically weigh over , and in mature females, can exceed a mass of . All buteos may be noted for their broad wings and sturdy builds. They frequently soar on thermals at midday over openings and are most frequently seen while doing this. The flight style varies based on the body type and wing shape and surface size. Some long-winged species, such as rough-legged buzzards and Swainson&#x27;s hawks, have a floppy, buoyant flight style, while others, such as red-tailed hawks and rufous-tailed hawks, tend to be relatively shorter-winged, soaring more slowly and flying with more labored, deeper flaps. Most small and some medium-sized species, such as, red-shouldered hawk, often fly with an alternation of soaring and flapping, thus may be reminiscent of an &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawk in flight, but are still relatively larger-winged, shorter-tailed, and soar more extensively in open areas than &quot;Accipiter&quot; species do. Buteos inhabit a wide range of habitats across the world, but tend to prefer some access to both clearings, which provide ideal hunting grounds, and trees, which can provide nesting locations and security.

=== Diet ===
All &quot;Buteo&quot; species are to some extent opportunistic when it comes to hunting, and prey on almost any type of small animal as it becomes available to them. However, most have a strong preference for small mammals, mostly rodents. Rodents of almost every family in the world are somewhere preyed upon by &quot;Buteo&quot; species. Since many rodents are primarily nocturnal, most buteos mainly hunt rodents that may be partially active during the day, which can include squirrels and chipmunks, voles, and gerbils. More nocturnal varieties are hunted opportunistically and may be caught in the first or last few hours of light. Other smallish mammals, such as shrews, moles, pikas, bats, and weasels, tend to be minor secondary prey, although can locally be significant for individual species. Larger mammals, such as rabbits, hares, and marmots, including even adult specimens weighing as much as , may be hunted by the heaviest and strongest species, such as ferruginous, red-tailed and white-tailed hawks. Birds are taken occasionally, as well. Small to mid-sized birds, i.e. passerines, woodpeckers, waterfowl, pigeons, and gamebirds, are most often taken. However, since the adults of most smaller birds can successfully outmaneuver and evade buteos in flight, much avian prey is taken in the nestling or fledgling stages or adult birds if they are previously injured. An exception is the short-tailed hawk, which is a relatively small and agile species and is locally a small bird-hunting specialist. The Hawaiian hawk, which evolved on an isolated group of islands with no terrestrial mammals, was also initially a bird specialist, although today it preys mainly on introduced rodents. Other prey may include snakes, lizards, frogs, salamanders, fish, and even various invertebrates, especially beetles. In several &quot;Buteo&quot; species found in more tropical regions, such as the grey-lined hawk, reptiles and amphibians may come to locally dominate the diet. Swainson&#x27;s hawk, despite its somewhat large size, is something of exceptional insect-feeding specialist and may rely almost fully on crickets and dragonflies when wintering in southern South America. Carrion is eaten occasionally by most species, but is almost always secondary to live prey. The importance of carrion in the Old World &quot;buzzard&quot; species is relatively higher since these often seem slower and less active predators than their equivalents in the Americas. Most &quot;Buteo&quot; species seem to prefer to ambush prey by pouncing down to the ground directly from a perch. In a secondary approach, many spot prey from a great distance while soaring and circle down to the ground to snatch it.

=== Reproduction ===
&quot;Buteo&quot;s are typical accipitrids in most of their breeding behaviors. They all build their own nests, which are often constructed out of sticks and other materials they can carry. Nests are generally located in trees, which are generally selected based on large sizes and inaccessibility to climbing predators rather than by species. Most &quot;Buteo&quot;s breed in stable pairs, which may mate for life or at least for several years even in migratory species in which pairs part ways during winter. Generally from 2 to 4 eggs are laid by the female and are mostly incubated by her, while the male mate provides food. Once the eggs hatch, the survival of the young is dependent upon how abundant appropriate food is and the security of the nesting location from potential nest predators and other (often human-induced) disturbances. As in many raptors, the nestlings hatch at intervals of a day or two and the older, strong siblings tend to have the best chances of survival, with the younger siblings often starving or being handled aggressively (and even killed) by their older siblings. The male generally does most of the hunting and the female broods, but the male may also do some brooding while the female hunts as well. Once the fledgling stage is reached, the female takes over much of the hunting. After a stage averaging a couple of weeks, the fledglings take the adults‘ increasing indifference to feeding them or occasional hostile behavior towards them as a cue to disperse on their own. Generally, young &quot;Buteo&quot;s tend to disperse several miles away from their nesting grounds and wander for one to two years until they can court a mate and establish their own breeding range.

=== Distribution ===
The &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks include many of the most widely distributed, most common, and best-known raptors in the world. Examples include the red-tailed hawk of North America and the common buzzard of Eurasia. Most Northern Hemisphere species are at least partially migratory. In North America, species such as broad-winged hawks and Swainson&#x27;s hawks are known for their huge numbers (often called &quot;kettles&quot;) while passing over major migratory flyways in the fall. Up to tens of thousands of these &quot;Buteo&quot;s can be seen each day during the peak of their migration. Any of the prior mentioned common &quot;Buteo&quot; species may have total populations that exceed a million individuals. On the other hand, the Socotra buzzard and Galapagos hawks are considered vulnerable to extinction per the IUCN. The Ridgway&#x27;s hawk is even more direly threatened and is considered Critically Endangered. These insular forms are threatened primarily by habitat destruction, prey reductions and poisoning. The latter reason is considered the main cause of a noted decline in the population of the more abundant Swainson&#x27;s hawk, due to insecticides being used in southern South America, which the hawks ingest through crickets and then die from poisoning.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The genus &quot;Buteo&quot; was erected by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799 by tautonymy with the specific name of the common buzzard &quot;Falco buteo&quot; which had been introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.

=== Extant species in taxonomic order ===




















=== Fossil record ===
A number of fossil species have been discovered, mainly in North America. Some are placed here primarily based on considerations of biogeography, &quot;Buteo&quot; being somewhat hard to distinguish from &quot;Geranoaetus&quot; based on osteology alone:
* †&quot;Buteo dondasi&quot; (Late Pliocene of Buenos Aires, Argentina)
* †&quot;Buteo fluviaticus&quot; (Brule Middle? Oligocene of Wealt County, US) – possibly same as &quot;B. grangeri&quot;
* †&quot;Buteo grangeri&quot; (Brule Middle? Oligocene of Washabaugh County, South Dakota, US)
* †&quot;Buteo antecursor&quot; (Brule Late? Oligocene)
* †?&quot;Buteo&quot; &quot;sp.&quot; (Brule Late Oligocene of Washington County, US)
* †&quot;Buteo ales&quot; (Agate Fossil Beds Early Miocene of Sioux County, US) – formerly in &quot;Geranospiza&quot; or &quot;Geranoaetus&quot;
* †&quot;Buteo typhoius&quot; (Olcott Early ?- snake Creek Late Miocene of Sioux County, US)
* †&quot;Buteo pusillus&quot; (Middle Miocene of Grive-Saint-Alban, France)
* †&quot;Buteo&quot; &quot;sp.&quot; (Middle Miocene of Grive-Saint-Alban, France – Early Pleistocene of Bacton, England)
* †&quot;Buteo contortus&quot; (snake Creek Late Miocene of Sioux County, US) – formerly in &quot;Geranoaetus&quot;
* †&quot;Buteo spassovi&quot; (Late Miocene of Chadžidimovo, Bulgaria)
* †&quot;Buteo conterminus&quot; (snake Creek Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Sioux County, US) – formerly in &quot;Geranoaetus&quot;
* †&quot;Buteo&quot; &quot;sp.&quot; (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Lee Creek Mine, North Carolina, US)
* †&quot;Buteo sanya&quot; (Late Pleistocene of Luobidang Cave, Hainan, China)
*&quot;†Buteo chimborazoensis&quot; (Late Pleistocene of Ecuador)
*†&quot;Buteo sanfelipensis&quot; (Late Pleistocene, Cuba)
An unidentifiable accipitrid that occurred on Ibiza in the Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene may also have been a &quot;Buteo&quot;. If this is so, the bird can be expected to aid in untangling the complicated evolutionary history of the common buzzard group.

The prehistoric species &quot;&quot;Aquila&quot; danana&quot;, &quot;Buteogallus fragilis&quot; (Fragile eagle), and &quot;Spizaetus grinnelli&quot; were at one time also placed in &quot;Buteo&quot;.

<doc id="203848" wikidata="Q2477489" url="?curid=203848" title="League for Programming Freedom">
<text>League for Programming Freedom (LPF) was founded in 1989 by Richard Stallman to unite free software developers as well as developers of proprietary software to fight against software patents and the extension of the scope of copyright. Their logo is the Statue of Liberty holding a floppy disk and tape spool.

Among other initiatives, the League started the &quot;Burn all GIFs&quot; campaign in opposition to the actions of Unisys in enforcing their patent on LZW compression used by CompuServe when creating the image format.

The League produced a newsletter, &quot;Programming Freedom&quot;, in 11 issues from 1991 to 1995. These primary source materials chronicle the work of the organization.

The single event that had the most influence on the creation of the League was Apple&#x27;s lawsuits against Microsoft about supposed copyrights violations of the look and feel of the Macintosh in the development of Windows. After the lawsuit ended, the League went dormant, to be resurrected by those who were increasingly troubled by the enforcement of software patents.

In September 2009, LPF President Dean Anderson sent a notice to former members announcing the return of the LPF and reviving its membership, with plans for an election on 12 May 2010.

<doc id="203849" wikidata="Q5343311" url="?curid=203849" title="Edward Harkness">
<text>Edward Stephen Harkness (January 22, 1874 – January 29, 1940) was an American philanthropist. Given privately and through his family&#x27;s Commonwealth Fund, Harkness&#x27; gifts to private hospitals, art museums, and educational institutions in the Northeastern United States were among the largest of the early twentieth century. He was a major benefactor to Columbia University, Yale University, Harvard University, Phillips Exeter Academy, St. Paul&#x27;s School, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the University of St Andrews in Scotland. He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1934.

Harkness inherited his fortune from his father, Stephen V. Harkness, whose wealth was established by an early investment in Standard Oil, and his brother, Charles W. Harkness. In 1918, he was ranked the 6th-richest person in the United States by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s first &quot;Rich List&quot;, behind John D. Rockefeller, Henry Clay Frick, Andrew Carnegie, George Fisher Baker, and William Rockefeller.

==Biography==
Edward (&quot;Ned&quot;) Harkness was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one of four sons of Anna M. Harkness and Stephen V. Harkness, a harness-maker who invested in and was one of the five founding partners in the forerunner of Standard Oil, John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s oil company. Stephen Harkness died when Edward was fourteen, leaving his wife and his oldest son, Charles, to manage the estate. Harkness attended St. Paul&#x27;s School and Yale College, Class of 1897 and Columbia Law School. Harkness, his brother Charles, and cousin William were members of Wolf&#x27;s Head Society at Yale. While at Yale, Ned enlisted the assistance of Henry Sloane Coffin as a tutor. Ned and Henry became friends and roomed together. Henry was later the pastor of Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, a few blocks away from Harkness and his wife&#x27;s mansion in New York. Henry&#x27;s brother William Sloane Coffin Sr. was the president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1931 to 1933. Ned had already been heavily involved with the museum as a trustee and major donor.
After graduating, Edward Harkness married Mary Stillman, daughter of wealthy New York attorney Thomas E. Stillman, in 1904. Her maternal grandfather, Thomas S. Greenman, was a shipbuilder in Mystic, Connecticut and the co-founder George Greenman &amp; Co shipyard, now part of the Mystic Seaport Museum. Harkness&#x27; mother gave the couple a new Italian Renaissance mansion on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side as a wedding present. As the building&#x27;s architect, Harkness chose Yale College classmate James Gamble Rogers, who would later design many of his philanthropic building projects. The home, at 75th Street and 5th Avenue and now known as the Edward S. Harkness House, became the headquarters of Harkness&#x27; Commonwealth Fund after Mary&#x27;s death in 1950.

Harkness briefly served as a railroad director for the Southern Pacific Railroad, but within several years decided to become a full-time philanthropist. He began making gifts to the Egyptian collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1912, and that same year was appointed to the museum&#x27;s board of trustees.

Harkness&#x27; older brother Charles died in 1916 at age 55, leaving Edward more than US$80 million, $ in , much of it in Standard Oil stock. Charles had continued to invest substantially in Standard Oil as manager of the family fortune, and his brother&#x27;s estate made Harkness the third-largest stakeholder in Standard Oil.

==Philanthropy==
Harkness made charitable gifts totaling more than $129 million, the equivalent of $ in . His philanthropic peers John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie gave respectively $550 million and $350 million.

===Medical philanthropy===
Harkness encouraged and orchestrated the merger of Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University&#x27;s College of Physicians and Surgeons, creating Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC), the world&#x27;s first academic medical center.

CPMC was built in the 1920s on the site of Hilltop Park, the one-time home stadium of the New York Yankees, which Harkness purchased and donated. Despite his aversion to have anything named for himself, The Edward Harkness Eye Institute was named by relatives.

In 1997, Columbia-Presbyterian merged with the New York Hospital. New York Hospital had affiliated with Cornell University&#x27;s Weill Cornell Medical College in the 1930s, following their lead. Now known as NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital / Columbia University Medical Center, the Harkness Pavilion, named for father Stephen, is a central part of the campus.

===Arts philanthropy===

Harkness was a major benefactor of the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In addition to donations to the Decorative Arts Department, he gifted the Metropolitan Museum its initial ancient Egyptian art collection. He purchased the complete Tomb of Perneb for nthe museum and helped purchase the Carnarvon Collection of Egyptian artifacts. He also donated the Met&#x27;s unofficial mascot, a blue decorative hippo from the Egyptian Middle Kingdom&#x27;s Twelfth Dynasty that is known as &quot;William&quot;.

He was actively involved with the discovery and excavation of King Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb. The Harknesses and Albert Lythgoe visited Howard Carter at the site multiple times and Carter invited Harkness to witness the opening of King Tutankhamun&#x27;s sarcophagus on February 12, 1924.

===Educational philanthropy===
In 1917, a year after Charles&#x27; death, Anna Harkness donated $3 million to Yale University to build the Memorial Quadrangle student dormitory in Charles&#x27; memory. In 1918, Anna Harkness established the Commonwealth Fund with an initial gift of $10 million, and Ned Harkness was made its president.

Ned Harkness and his wife made many contributions to educational buildings, including St Salvator&#x27;s Hall at the University of St. Andrews; Harkness Chapel and Harkness Dormitory at Connecticut College; Butler Library at Columbia University as well as the original portions of the Columbia University Medical Center and the undergraduate dormitories at Brown University and Connecticut College—all of these were built through his philanthropy or that of his wife, Mary.

Between 1926 and 1930, Harkness made major donations to his alma mater, Yale, and Harvard to establish residential college systems at each school. Harkness admired the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge in England and proposed to Yale President James Rowland Angell that he would fund a similar system for Yale&#x27;s undergraduate college to relieve overcrowding and improve social intimacy. When the Yale Corporation failed to accept Harkness&#x27; offer by 1928, he went to Harvard with a similar offer. Harvard&#x27;s president, Abbott Lawrence Lowell, quickly accepted, and with a $10 million gift from Harkness in hand, eight houses for Harvard College were completed by 1931. Dismayed, Yale administrators appealed to Harkness to reconsider his offer. In 1930 he agreed to give Yale $11 million for nine residential colleges of its own. Harkness persuaded Yale to retain his friend James Gamble Rogers as the colleges&#x27; architect. He also made gifts that established the Yale School of Drama, the first independent drama faculty in the country, and erected its theater.

Around the same time as his Yale-Harvard philanthropy, Harkness sought to reform the pedagogical techniques of the country&#x27;s elite boarding schools. At Phillips Exeter Academy, he sought to innovate beyond rote learning by introducing the Harkness table method of instruction. Through further gifts, the method spread to St. Paul&#x27;s, The Lawrenceville School, and Kingswood-Oxford School. Harkness also made gifts to Taft School, The Hill School, and Phillips Academy.

He established the Harkness Fellowships and founded the Pilgrim Trust in the UK in 1930 with an endowment of just over two million pounds, &quot;prompted by his admiration for what Great Britain had done in the 1914–18 war and, by his ties of affection for the land from which he drew his descent.&quot; The current priorities of the trust are preservation, places of worship, and social welfare.

==Residences==

Edward and Mary Harkness had a number of homes in addition to Harkness House in New York. They spent summers at their Eolia mansion on Long Island Sound in Waterford, Connecticut, near where Mary had visited her grandparents in the summers. The home and of ornamental gardens and grounds are now maintained by the State of Connecticut as Harkness Memorial State Park. They also owned another house on Long Island in Manhasset, New York, on 186 acres, called Weekend, like their New York City mansion designed by James Gamble Rogers. They had additional houses in North Carolina and in San Diego, California, and a camp at the Ausable Club in the Adirondacks. The Harknesses used their steam yacht &quot;Steveana&quot; (named after his parents) to commute between Long Island and the city. For longer trips they used their Pullman car &quot;Pelham&quot;, named after Pelham, Massachusetts, where the Harkness family started in America.

Harkness was an avid golfer and was a member of the Jekyll Island Club in Georgia, Cypress Point Club, The Creek Club in Locust Valley, the Valley Club of Monteceito in Santa Barbara and Yeamans Hall Club outside Charleston, South Carolina, another James Gamble Rogers golf and winter community. He was also a member of the Racquet and Tennis Club in New York City.

==Burial==
Edward and Mary Harkness are buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City, which is today a National Historic Landmark. The Harkness family mausoleum is stately, designed to resemble a small medieval church, and includes a walled and locked private garden. It is not marked with the family name.

==Legacy==
In addition to the family-funded foundations, Harkness, along with another wealthy neighbor, Edward Crowninshield Hammond, was the inspiration for Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s off-stage character &quot;Harker&quot;, the &quot;Standard Oil millionaire&quot;, in &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot;, and on-stage figure &quot;T. Stedman Harder&quot; in &quot;A Moon for the Misbegotten&quot;.

On 21 April, Srichaphan broke into the top 10 for the first time in his career. This made him the first Asian male in history to break into the top 10 in the singles rankings. He also reached his career-high ranking of No. 9 on 12 May and went into the French Open as the 10th seed which remains the highest he was seeded in a Grand Slam.

At Wimbledon, after a long streak of early exits, Srichaphan went into the tournament as the 12th seed and made the fourth round where he was beaten by Andy Roddick in four sets. En route to the fourth round, he defeated 17-year-old Rafael Nadal in Nadal&#x27;s first Grand Slam who, as of 2022, is a 22-time Grand Slam champion and 14-time French Open champion. He became the first player to defeat Nadal at a Grand Slam. He also reached the fourth round in the US Open losing to Lleyton Hewitt. By the end of the year, he was ranked World No. 11 in the ATP rankings. He is however not in favor of playing doubles having won no title in this category on either Challenger or ATP level.

Srichaphan saw even more success during the US Open swing. He made the finals of the RCA Championships but lost to top seed Andy Roddick in straight sets. One month later, he defended his title at the TD Waterhouse Cup as the top seed without losing a set defeating James Blake in the final.

He finished the year with a win-loss record of 50–28 and a year-end ranking of No. 11, the highest year-end ranking of his career.

===2004: Last title of career===
Srichaphan began the year with a third consecutive final appearance at the Chennai Open where he failed to defend his title against top seed and world No. 7 Carlos Moyá who won in three sets. Two weeks later at the Australian Open, he made the fourth round defeating 19th seed and former world No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten en route. He lost in the fourth round to world No. 4 Andre Agassi in straight sets.

Srichaphan won his fifth and last title at the Nottingham Open where he went into the tournament as the top seed defeating qualifier and former world No. 7 Thomas Johansson in the final in three sets. He failed to defend his title at the TD Waterhouse Cup after he lost to Luis Horna in the semifinals in three sets.

After his third round appearance at the US Open, Srichaphan made two more semifinals. The first one came at the China Open where he lost to Mikhail Youzhny in straight sets. The second one came at his home tournament of the Thailand Open where he lost to world No. 1 Roger Federer in three sets. He was the only player in the entire tournament to win a set from Federer.

Srichaphan ended the year with a win-loss record of 44–30 and a year-end ranking of 27.

===2005: Slow loss of form and rankings===
Srichaphan began the year with a fourth consecutive final appearance at the Chennai Open where he once again lost to top seed Carlos Moyá in three sets.

2005 would prove to be a worse year for Srichaphan than his past years on the tour. Out of the seven Masters 1000 tournaments he played, he only recorded one win at the Miami Masters. His best Grand Slam result of the year was another third round appearance at the US Open where he defeated world No. 6 Nikolay Davydenko en route. Some other good results during the year included a quarterfinal at the 2005 Rotterdam Open where he defeated 2nd seed and world No. 5 Guillermo Coria en route, a semifinal at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic where he lost to top seed, world No. 5 and eventual champion Andy Roddick in straight sets and his last final at the Stockholm Open where he defeated top seed Thomas Johansson en route and lost to 6th seed James Blake in straight sets. He also failed to defend his title at the Nottingham Open after losing in the quarterfinals to 4th seed and eventual champion Richard Gasquet in three sets.

Srichaphan ended the year with a win-loss record of 34–31 and a year-end ranking of 42.

===2006: Indian Wells semifinal===
Srichaphan began the year with his finals streak ending at the Chennai Open when he lost in the quarterfinals to Kristof Vliegen in straight sets.

At the Indian Wells Masters, Srichaphan reached the semifinals where he lost against world No. 1 Roger Federer in straight sets. En route to the semifinals, he beat world No. 20 Robby Ginepri in the second round, world No. 16 Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain in the third round, world No. 4 David Nalbandian in the fourth round and world No. 25 Jarkko Nieminen of Finland in the quarterfinals. Because of his result, his ranking improved 23 spots from No. 61 to No. 38.

From late March to late August, Srichaphan endured a streak of early losses in tournaments which caused his ranking to fall. At the US Open, he defeated 24th seed José Acasuso in the first round which would become his last win in a Grand Slam.

After the US Open, Srichaphan made three more semifinals at the China Open where he defeated 2nd seed and world No. 5 Nikolay Davydenko en route and lost to 3rd seed, world No. 9 and eventual champion Marcos Baghdatis in three sets, the Thailand Open where he lost to top seed and world No. 3 Ivan Ljubičić in straight sets and the Swiss Indoors where he lost to world No. 1 Roger Federer in three sets and was once again the only player to win a set from Federer the entire tournament.

Srichaphan ended the year with a win-loss record of 30–32 and a year-end ranking of 53. It was the first time since 2001 that he had more losses than wins on his yearly record.

===2007–2010: Injuries and retirement===
Srichaphan once again began the year at the Chennai Open where he defeated qualifier Simone Bolelli in the first round in straight sets for the last match win of his career. He lost in the second round to eventual finalist Stefan Koubek in straight sets.

Srichaphan would go on to lose five matches in a row between January and March to have a win-loss record of 1–5 in 2007. These losses included a straight sets loss to qualifier Dudi Sela at the 2007 Australian Open which would be the last Grand Slam of his career and a straight sets loss to Janko Tipsarević at the Indian Wells Masters which dropped his ranking down 31 spots from No. 52 to No. 83 due to his inability to match his semifinal result of the previous year.

At the Miami Masters, Srichaphan sustained a wrist injury in his first round match against Luis Horna and was forced to retire late in the first set. The injury caused him to miss the rest of 2007 and to fall out of the ATP rankings in March 2008 due to his inactivity. He began practicing to return to the tour and returned at the 2009 Thailand Open in doubles partnering fellow Thai Danai Udomchoke but lost in the first round to Michael Kohlmann and Alexander Peya in three sets. It would be the last tournament of his career.

Srichaphan once again began practicing to make a strong return to the tour, but in June 2010, he was involved in a motorcycle accident that broke both his hands and severely injured his knee. Because of the injuries sustained in the accident, he officially retired on 4 June.

==National representation==
===Olympics===
Srichaphan made his Olympics debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia in the singles draw. There, he defeated Attila Sávolt in the first round but lost in the second round to 3rd seed Magnus Norman in straight sets. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, he was Thailand&#x27;s flag bearer at the opening ceremony. He went into the tournament as the 12th seed but lost in the first round of singles to Joachim Johansson in straight sets.

===Davis Cup===
Srichaphan made his Davis Cup debut for Thailand in April 1998 at the age of 18. During his time with the team from 1998 to 2006, he posted a win-loss record of 33–13 (31–10 in singles).

===Asian Games===
At the 1998 Asian Games Srichaphan won a gold medal in the doubles partnering his older brother, Narathorn Srichaphan. He then won a gold medal in singles at the next edition in 2002 which he won without losing a set. In addition, he was a triple gold medalist at the 1999 Southeast Asian Games winning in singles, doubles (once again partnering his brother, Narathorn) and the team event.

===Hopman Cup===
Srichaphan partnered Tamarine Tanasugarn after qualifying for the 2000 Hopman Cup. There, they surprisingly won the group stage to qualify for the finals where they lost to South Africa&#x27;s team of Amanda Coetzer and Wayne Ferreira. They returned at the next edition in 2001 but lost in the group stage.

==Playing style==
Srichaphan was known for his athleticism on court. He was known for being very quick and flexible allowing him to return balls from unlikely and uncomfortable positions. Because of this, he was regarded as one of the most entertaining players on tour. He was also known for playing a very flat and powerful playing style.

==Personal life==
Srichaphan was born on 14 June 1979, in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand. He started playing tennis at the age of 6 with his dad who quit his bank job to coach his son.

Srichaphan is noted for his politeness on the court. At each match, he performs the wai, the traditional Thai greeting, clasping his hands together and bowing to the four corners of the stadium. The gesture is seen as thanking the fans and it has become his trademark. His success in tennis led to a spike in popularity of the game in Thailand.

Srichaphan is extremely popular in Asia, especially in Thailand. &quot;The Nation&quot; newspaper named him &quot;Thai of the Year&quot; in 2002; in 2003, Srichaphan was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; and featured as one of the year&#x27;s &quot;Asian heroes&quot;.

In November 2005, Srichaphan spent a week as a Buddhist monk in a temple outside Bangkok. He adopted the Buddhist name &quot;Mahaviro&quot;, meaning &quot;great and brave&quot;, wore saffron robes and shaved his head. His then girlfriend, Odette Henriette Jacqmin was present for the ceremony.

Srichaphan married Miss Universe 2005, Natalie Glebova of Canada in his home of Bangkok, Thailand, on 29 November 2007.

In June 2010, Srichaphan officially announced his retirement from the ATP tour but will coach Thailand&#x27;s Davis Cup team.

In February 2011, Srichaphan and his wife, Natalie, announced their separation after three years of marriage stating the reason to be &quot;work commitments had kept them apart.&quot;

Srichaphan still follows Everton, a football club supported since Li Tie and Li Weifeng arrived from East Asia.

Srichaphan currently resides in Thailand where he got married once again and had a child. He also coaches young children in tennis.

<text>Khon Kaen (, ) is the capital of Khon Kaen province and the fourth-largest city in Thailand. It is one of the four major cities of Isan, Northeast Thailand, also known as the &quot;big four of Isan&quot;, the others being Udon Thani, Nakhon Ratchasima, and Ubon Ratchathani. 

The city municipality of Khon Kaen (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) acts as the governmental seat of the province, as well as the Mueang Khon Kaen district and lies northeast of Bangkok.

==Geography and demography==
Khon Kaen is on the Khorat Plateau, elevation 187 m, and is the center of the mid-northeastern provincial group of Thailand, according to the Thai government. Its coordinates are . The city municipality has a population of 114,459, while the Mueang Khon Kaen district, forming the city&#x27;s urban area, has a population of 412,758. Khon Kaen therefore ranks as the fourth-largest city in Thailand after Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Korat.

===Location===
Khon Kaen is a city in the northeastern region of Thailand. The city is bisected by Mithraphap Road, also known as the &quot;Friendship Highway&quot;, or &quot;Highway 2&quot;, the road linking Bangkok to the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge. Highway 230, a modern, multi-lane by-pass enables through-traffic to avoid the city center to the west, and connects to the airport, the new main bus station (BKS3).

===Smart City ===
The province of Khon Kaen&#x27;s 2017 population was 1.8 million with a GDP of 190 billion baht. Its Smart City development plan aims to double its GDP per person to 394,000-493,000 baht by 2029 from an average of about 192,000 baht in 2016. Khon Kaen&#x27;s plan has been incorporated into Thailand&#x27;s 12th national social and economic plan (2017–2021). The plan has been driven largely by the Khon Kaen Think Tank (KKTT), a group of involved citizens. The Smart City&#x27;s signature project is the Khon Kaen Transit System Co (KKTS), founded in 2017. Its plans for a 26 km light rail network from Samran to Tha Phra in the Mueang Khon Kaen District are complete and awaiting Thai Cabinet approval before bidding on the project can begin. The light rail system will feature 18 to 21 stations, take two years to complete, and will cost 15 billion baht. The Land Traffic Management Commission (LTMC), a national think tank for transportation policy, has already blessed the plan.

==Culture==
Thailand&#x27;s 2014 EU Film Festival included Khon Kaen, together with Chiang Mai and Bangkok, as host locations. A selection of six films were shown in the city, including the Spanish film &quot;The Pelayos&quot;, and the Polish film &quot;Walesa, Man of Hope&quot;.
==Administration==
The municipality of Khon Kaen was established on 20 August 1935, with an area of 4 square kilometers. It was later upgraded to a city municipality on 24 September 1995. The administration of the city is now responsible for an area that covers approximately 46 sq. km. and consists of 66,179 households. There are 95 communities divided into 4 zones, each with about 20-30 communities each.

==Climate==
Khon Kaen&#x27;s climate is categorized as tropical savanna (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;), with winters that are dry and very warm. Temperatures rise until April, a very hot month, with an average daily maximum of . The monsoon season runs from May until October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm.

<doc id="203859" wikidata="Q167230" url="?curid=203859" title="Wallcreeper">
<text>The wallcreeper (Tichodroma muraria) is a small passerine bird found throughout the high mountains of the Palearctic from southern Europe to central China. It is the only extant member of both the genus &quot;Tichodroma&quot; and the family Tichodromidae.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
In the past, there was some disagreement among ornithologists as to where the wallcreeper belongs in the taxonomic order. Initially, Linnaeus included it in the treecreepers as &quot;Certhia muraria&quot;, and even when given a separate genus of its own, &quot;Tichodroma&quot;, by Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger in 1811, it was long included in the treecreeper family Certhiidae. More recently, it was placed in its own monotypic family, Tichodromadidae, by Karel Voous in the influential &quot;List of Recent Holarctic Bird Species&quot;, while other authorities such as Charles Vaurie put it in a monotypic family called Tichodromadinae, as a subfamily of the nuthatch family Sittidae. In either case, it is closely related to the nuthatches; a 2016 phylogenetic study of members in the superfamily Certhioidea suggests it is a sister species to the Sittidae. At least one other species of wallcreeper is known from the fossil record, &quot;Tichodroma capeki&quot; (Late Miocene of Polgardi, Hungary).

The genus name &quot;Tichodroma&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek &quot;teikhos&quot;, meaning &quot;wall&quot;, and &quot;dromos&quot;, meaning &quot;runner&quot;. The specific name &quot;muraria&quot; is Medieval Latin for &quot;of walls&quot;, from Latin &quot;murus&quot;, &quot;wall&quot;. Alternatively, the wallcreeper is named the red-winged wall creeper.

===Subspecies===
Two subspecies are accepted:
* European wallcreeper (&quot;T. m. muraria&quot;) - : Found from southern and eastern Europe to the Caucasus and western Iran
* Asian wallcreeper (&quot;T. m. nepalensis&quot;) - : Originally described as a separate species. Found from Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and eastern Iran to eastern China

==Description==
The wallcreeper is long, with a weight of . Its is primarily blue-grey, with darker flight and tail feathers. In summer, the males have a black throat grading into the grey of the rest of the body, and females can have either a white throat or a small dark patch on the throat; in autumn and winter, both sexes have a white throat. Its most striking plumage feature, though, are its extraordinary crimson wings with white spots. Largely hidden when the wings are folded, this bright colouring covers most of the covert feathers, and the basal half of the primaries and secondaries. The tail is short, black with a narrow white fringe. Juveniles closely resemble the winter plumage. The subspecies &quot;T. m. nepalensis&quot; is slightly darker than the nominate race.

===Vocalisations===
Though largely silent, both male and female wallcreepers sing, the females generally only while defending feeding territories in the winter. The song is a high-pitched, drawn-out whistle, with notes that alternately rise and fall. During the breeding season, the male sings while perched or climbing.

==Distribution and habitat==

A bird of high mountains, the wallcreeper breeds at elevations ranging between in Europe, between in the Tien Shan, and in the Himalaya. It is largely resident across its range, but moves to lower elevations in winter, when it is found on buildings and in quarries. In France it regularly and repeatedly winters on cathedrals and viaducts in Brittany and Normandy. Birds have wintered as far afield as England and the Netherlands, where one spent two consecutive winters between 1989 and 1991 at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. The species is resident across much of the Himalayas, ranging across India, Nepal, Bhutan and parts of Tibet and also as a winter visitor in Bangladesh.

==Behaviour and ecology==

This species can be quite tame, but is often surprisingly difficult to see on mountain faces. While it may be confiding in the breeding and non-breeding seasons, and vagrant birds especially are extremely tame, they will still hide when they are aware of being watched, and will hesitate before entering the nest and even take roundabout routes towards the nest during prolonged observations.

Wallcreepers are territorial, and pairs vigorously defend their breeding territory during the summer. During the winter the wallcreeper is solitary, with males and females defending individual feeding territories. The size of these feeding territories is hard to estimate but may comprise a single large quarry or rock massif; or, alternatively, a series of smaller quarries and rock faces. Wallcreepers may travel some distances from roosting sites to feeding territories. They have also been demonstrated showing site fidelity to winter feeding territories in consecutive years.

===Breeding===

The female wallcreeper builds a cup nest of grass and moss, sheltered deep in a rock crevice, hole or cave. The nest is lined with softer materials, often including feathers or wool, and typically has two entrances. The female usually lays 4–5 eggs, though clutches as small as three have been found. The white eggs measure 21 mm long, and are marked with a small number of black or reddish-brown speckles. Once her entire clutch has been laid, the female incubates the eggs for 19–20 days, until they hatch. During incubation, she is regularly fed by her mate. Young are altricial, which means they are blind, featherless and helpless at birth. Both parents feed the nestlings for a period of 28–30 days, until the young birds fledge. Each pair raises a single brood a year.

===Feeding===
The wallcreeper is an insectivore, feeding on terrestrial invertebrates, primarily insects and spiders, gleaned from rock faces. It sometimes also chases flying insects in short sallies from a rock wall perch. Feeding birds move across a cliff face in short flights and quick hops, often with their wings partially spread.

<text>Northeast Thailand or Isan (Isan/, ; ; also written as Isaan, Isarn, Issarn, Issan, Esan, or Esarn; from Pāli &quot;isāna&quot; or Sanskrit ईशान्य &quot;īśānya&quot; &quot;northeast&quot;) consists of 20 provinces in northeastern Thailand. Isan is Thailand&#x27;s largest region, on the Khorat Plateau, bordered by the Mekong River (along the Laos–Thailand border) to the north and east, by Cambodia to the southeast and the Sankamphaeng Range south of Nakhon Ratchasima. To the west it is separated from northern and central Thailand by the Phetchabun Mountains. Isan covers , making it about half the size of Germany and roughly the size of England and Wales. The total forest area is or 15 percent of Isan&#x27;s area.

Since the beginning of the 20th century, northeastern Thailand has been generally known as &quot;Isan&quot;, while in official contexts the term &quot;phak tawan-ok-chiang-nuea&quot; (; &quot;northeastern region&quot;) may be used. The majority population of the Isan region is ethnically Lao, but distinguish themselves not only from the Lao of Laos but also from the Central Thai by calling themselves &quot;khon Isan&quot; or &quot;Thai Isan&quot; in general. But some refer to themselves as simply &quot;Lao&quot;, and academics have recently been referring to them as &quot;Lao Isan&quot; or as &quot;Thai Lao&quot;, with the main issue with self-identification as &quot;Lao&quot; being stigma associated with the Lao identity in Thai society.

The &quot;Lao Isan&quot; people are aware of their Lao ethnic origin, but Isan has been incorporated as a territory into the modern Thai state through over 100 years of administrative and bureaucratic reforms, educational policy, and government media. Despite this, since the election of Thaksin Shinawatra as prime minister in the 2001 Thai general election, the &quot;Lao Isan&quot; identity has reemerged, and the &quot;Lao Isan&quot; are now the main ethnolinguistic group involved in the pro-Thaksin &quot;Red Shirt movement&quot; of the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship. Several Thai prime ministers have come from the region.

== History ==
 
Isan has a number of important Bronze Age sites, with prehistoric art in the form of cliff paintings, artifacts and early evidence of rice cultivation. Iron and bronze tools such as those found at Ban Chiang may predate similar tools from Mesopotamia.

The region later came under the influence of the Dvaravati culture, followed by the Khmer Empire. The latter built dozens of &quot;prasats&quot; (sanctuaries) throughout Isan. The most significant are at Phimai Historical Park and Phanom Rung Historical Park. Preah Vihear Temple was also considered to be in Isan, until the International Court of Justice in 1962 ruled that it belonged to Cambodia.

After the Khmer Empire began to decline in the 13th century, Isan was dominated by the Lao kingdom of Lan Xang, which had been established by Fa Ngum. Due to a scarcity of information from the periods known as the post-Angkor period, the plateau seems to have been largely depopulated. There were few if any lines of demarcation, because until the 19th-century introduction of modern mapping, the region fell under what 20th-century scholars called the &quot;mandala system&quot;. Accordingly, in 1718 the first Lao mueang in the Chi River valley—and indeed anywhere in the interior of the Khorat Plateau—was founded at Suwannaphum District (in present-day Roi Et Province) by an official in the service of King Nokasad of the Kingdom of Champasak.

=== Thaification ===

The region was increasingly settled by both Lao and Thai emigrants. Thailand held sway from the 17th century, and carried out forced population transfers from the more populous left (east) bank of the Mekong to the right bank in the 18th and 19th centuries. This became more severe following the Lao rebellion (1826–1828), during which Anouvong, the last of the kings of Vientiane, rebelled against Siamese suzerainty, and lost a war that lasted two years. Khorat was then repopulated by forced migration of Mekong Valley Lao, with a heavy influx of voluntary Chinese migrants. In the wake of the Franco-Siamese crisis of 1893, the resulting treaty with France and the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909 made the plateau a border region between Thailand and the Laos of French Indochina. Roi Et was established early in the 20th century to further Siamese control, and to further assimilation of the population into the kingdom.
In the mid-20th century, the state-supported assimilation policy called Thaification promoted Isan&#x27;s ethnic integration into the modern conception of Thai nationality and de-emphasized the use of ethnic markers, for ethnic Laos and Khmers, as it was deemed uncivilized and to prevent ethnic discrimination among the Thai people.
This policy extended to the use of the name &quot;Isan&quot; itself: the name is derived from the Pali word , meaning &quot;northeast&quot;, in turn from the name of Iśāna (), a manifestation of Shiva as deity of the northeast. The name therefore reinforces the area&#x27;s identity as northeastern Thailand, rather than as a part of the Lao kingdom, which had recently been created by the French colonial discourse, as &quot;race was then an important ideological tool for French colonialists in the attempt to seize the &#x27;Laotian&#x27; and &#x27;Cambodian&#x27; portions of Siam.&quot;

Before the central government introduced the Thai alphabet and language in regional schools, the people of Isan wrote in the Tai Noi script, which is very similar to the one that Thai adopted. Many people speak Isan, a variety of Lao, as their first language. A significant minority in the south also speak Northern Khmer.

The Kuy people, an Austroasiatic people concentrated around the core of what was once called &quot;Chenla&quot; and known as the &quot;Khmer Boran&quot; (&quot;ancient Khmer&quot;), are a link to the region&#x27;s pre-Tai history.

==Geography==

Isan is roughly coterminous with the Khorat Plateau, which tilts gently from its northwestern corner, where it is about 213 m (700 feet) above sea level, to the southeast, where the elevation is only about 62 metres (200 feet). Except for a few hills in the northeastern corner, the region is primarily gently undulating land, most of it varying in elevation from 90 to 180 m (300–600 feet), tilting from the Phetchabun Mountains in the west down to the Mekong River. The plateau consists of two plains: the southern Khorat plain is drained by the Mun and Chi rivers, while the northern Sakon Nakhon plain is drained by the Loei and Songkhram rivers. The two plains are separated by the Phu Phan Mountains. The soil is mostly sandy, with substantial salt deposits.

The Mekong forms most of the border between Thailand and Laos to the north and east of Isan, while the south of the region borders Cambodia. The Mekong&#x27;s main Thai tributary is the Mun River, which rises in the Khao Yai National Park near Nakhon Ratchasima Province and runs east, joining the Mekong in Ubon Ratchathani Province. Isan&#x27;s other main river is the Chi, which flows through central Isan before turning south to meet the Mun in Sisaket Province. The smaller Loei and Songkhram rivers are also tributaries of the Mekong, the former flowing north through Loei Province and the latter east through Udon Thani, Sakon Nakhon, Nakhon Phanom, and Nong Khai Provinces.

The average temperature range is from to . The highest temperature recorded was in Udon Thani, the lowest at Sakhon Nakhon Agro Station.

Rainfall is unpredictable, but is concentrated in the rainy season from May to October. Average annual precipitation varies from in some areas to in the southwestern provinces of Nakhon Ratchasima, Buriram, Maha Sarakham, Khon Kaen, and Chaiyaphum. The rainy season begins with occasional short but heavy showers, eventually raining heavily for longer periods almost every day, usually in the late afternoon or at night, until it ends abruptly at the onset of the cool season.

The cool season runs from October to February and the hot season from February to May with the peak of high temperatures in April.

===National parks===
Isan has around 26 national parks. Province Khon Kaen has four national parks, of which Phu Pha Man National Park is notable for its large daily exodus of bats at dusk, making a formation about 10 kilometers (6 mi) long. Siam tulip fields are in Sai Thong National Park and Pa Hin Ngam National Park, both in Chaiyaphum Province. Phu Phan National Park in Sakon Nakhon Province includes the eight meter (26 ft) long Tang Pee Parn natural stone bridge. Among Thailand&#x27;s best-known national parks are Khao Yai National Park in Nakhon Ratchasima Province and Phu Kradueng National Park in Loei Province.

===Biodiversity===
Isan has high biodiversity and many endemic species. Both wildlife and plant species are exploited illegally. Valuable hardwood tree species, in particular Siamese Rosewood, are being extracted for sale, especially in the Chinese furniture market. These trees are so valuable that poachers, coming across the border from Cambodia, are heavily armed, and both rangers and poachers have been killed over them. In national parks such as Ta Phraya, rangers have been trained since 2015 in military-style counter-poaching measures by the elite ranger squad Hasadin.

==Economy==
Isan is home to one-third of Thailand&#x27;s population of 67 million, but contributes only ten per cent to the national GDP.

In terms of regional value-added per capita, Isan is Thailand&#x27;s poorest region. Bangkok is the richest, followed by central Thailand, southern Thailand, then northern Thailand. This ordering has been unchanged for decades. Thailand&#x27;s highly centralized fiscal system reinforces the status quo. An example of this Bangkok-centric policy is the allocation of budgets: Bangkok accounts for about 17 percent of the population and 25.8 percent of GDP, but benefits from about 72.2 percent of total expenditures. Isan accounts for about 34 percent of the population and 11.5 percent of GDP, but receives only 5.8 percent of expenditures.

Agriculture is the largest sector of the economy, generating around 22 percent of the gross regional product (compared to 8.5 percent for Thailand as a whole). Sticky rice, the staple food of the region, is the main agricultural crop (accounting for about 60 percent of cultivated land). It thrives in poorly drained paddy fields, and where fields can be flooded from nearby streams, rivers, and ponds. Often two harvests are possible each year. Farmers are increasingly diversifying into cash crops such as sugarcane and cassava, which are cultivated on a vast scale, and to a lesser extent, rubber. Silk production is an important cottage industry and contributes significantly to the economy.

Nong Khai Province, which stretches along the Mekong River, is noted for the production of pineapples, tobacco (which is dried, cured and shredded by the families before collection by cigarette manufacturers), and tomatoes, which are grown on an industrial scale, particularly in Si Chiang Mai District.

Despite its dominance of the economy, agriculture in the region is problematic. The climate is prone to drought, while the flat terrain of the plateau often floods in the rainy season. The tendency to flood renders a large proportion of the land unsuitable for cultivation. In addition, the soil is highly acidic, saline, and infertile from overuse. Since the 1970s, agriculture has been declining in importance as trade and the service sector have been increasing.

Very few farmers still use water buffalos rather than tractors. Nowadays, water buffalos are mainly kept by almost all rural families as status symbols. The main piece of agricultural equipment in use today is the &quot;rot tai na&quot; (, lit. &quot;vehicle plow field&quot;), colloquially called &quot;kwai lek&quot; (, or &quot;iron/steel buffalo&quot;), or more generally by its manufacturer&#x27;s name of &quot;Kobota&quot;, a mini-tractor composed of a small diesel engine mounted on two wheels with long wooden or metal handlebars for steering. It is usually attached to a trailer or a plow. Buffalo are now mainly used for grazing on the stubble in the rice paddy, which they in turn fertilize with their manure. The main animals raised for food are cattle, pigs, chickens, ducks, and fish.

Most of Thailand&#x27;s rural poor live in Isan. The region&#x27;s poverty is reflected in its infrastructure: eight of the ten provinces in Thailand with the fewest physicians per capita are in Isan. Sisaket Province has the fewest, with one physician per 14,661 persons in 2001, with the national average being 3,289. It also has eight of the ten provinces with the fewest hospital beds per head. Chaiyaphum Province has the fewest, with one per 1,131 in 2001 (the national average was 453). Nevertheless, as in the rest of Thailand, all districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;) have a hospital, and all sub-districts (&quot;tambon&quot;) have clinics providing primary health care. The introduction of the &quot;30 baht&quot; health card has dramatically changed the numbers of those attending hospitals for treatment, as it has meant that full health care is available to all who register for only 30 baht per visit. The few who can afford it travel to the modern private hospitals and clinics in the large cities for non-urgent specialist consultations and care.
The region lags in new technology: there was only one Internet connection per 75 households in 2002 (national average: one per 22 households) [update needed], but by 2006 every district town (amphoe) had at least one publicly accessible Internet connection, either in a local computer shop or in the district office.

Extension of landline telephones to remote areas not previously served has been largely superseded by the use of mobile phones, primarily of GSM format, which now covers the entire region with the exception of a few sparsely populated mountainous areas and large national parks. Many people, even the poorest and frequently also children, have cellular telephones, although they have no fixed-line telephone. In this sense, Isan has led advanced nations where landline service is now being superseded by cellular technology. The region also has the nation&#x27;s lowest literacy rate.

By the beginning of 2008, most amphoe had been provided with ADSL by the TOT, leaving the majority of the rural population dependent on dial-up connections for those few who have landline telephones. This results in slow service that does not adequately meet modern needs. Most rural people rely on smartphones for data services. Internet shops with high-speed connections have for many years provided service to those who cannot afford or do not have access to high-speed Internet. They are heavily patronized by primary and secondary school children who come not only to use the Internet but also to play online games, use VOIP, or just to use the computer and printers. Resident Western expatriates and foreign tourists are also frequent customers. For those outside the district towns who require a serious use of the Internet in their homes, the mobile phone or an iPstar broadband satellite connection is the only alternative, although more expensive than a DSL connection. It is far less reliable and suffers considerable downtime due to overloading, heavy cloud cover, and rain. Despite, in theory, being &quot;always on&quot;, it often lacks adequate stability for streaming and clarity of VOIP.

Many Isan people seek higher-paying work outside the region, particularly in Bangkok. Some of these people have settled permanently in the city, while some migrate to and fro. Others have emigrated in search of better wages. Rather than relocate as a family, they often leave their children in the care of relatives, friends, or neighbors.

Average wages in Isan were the lowest in the country in 2002 at 3,928 baht per month (the national average was 6,445 baht).

A Khon Kaen University study (2014) found that marriages with foreigners by Thai northeastern women boosted the gross domestic product of the northeast by 8.67 billion baht (2014: €211 million or US$270 million). According to the study, after a northeastern woman married a foreigner, she will send 9,600 baht a month on average to her family to help with its expenses. The activity also created 747,094 jobs, the study found. The 2010 census found that 90 percent of the slightly more than 27,000 foreigners living in the northeastern region were married to women from there.

===Tourism===
According to the governor of Nakhon Phanom Province, &quot;The entire Northeast [Isan] gained only 2.9 percent of [the] country&#x27;s tourism income of 2.7 trillion baht [in 2017].&quot;

==Demographics==
=== Population ===

Isan&#x27;s total population as of 2025 was 22 million,Forty percent of the population is concentrated in the provinces of Khorat, Ubon Ratchathani, Udon Thani, and Khon Kaen, known as &quot;big four of Isan&quot;. These provinces surround the four major cities of the same names. As of 2025, their populations were: Khorat 126,391; Udon Thani 130,531; Khon Kaen 114,459; and Ubon Ratchathani 122,070. As of 2025, 50 percent of the region&#x27;s population lived in municipal areas. Kalasin was the most urbanized province (with almost 100 percent in municipal areas), and Roi Et the least (2.8 percent). Thus, the population is still largely rural, but concentrated around the urban centers.

There is a substantial Khmer minority, concentrated in the southern provinces of Buriram, Surin, and Sisaket, and some Vietnamese refugees in Mukdahan and Nakhon Phanom. The Khmer-speaking minority and the Kuy people (&quot;Soui&quot;), who live in the south of Isan, speak Austroasiatic languages and follow customs more similar to those of Cambodia than to those of the Thai and Lao, who are Tai peoples.

===Languages===

The main language is Isan, the name by which the Lao language is called in Thailand for political reasons, though most people in the Isan region still call it Lao among themselves and in non-official settings, but dialect from Khon Kaen is de facto standard. The number of Isan speakers has been estimated at between 15 and 23 million, with the majority living in Isan. Written with the Thai alphabet (instead of the historically used Tai Noi script), Isan belongs to the Chiang Saeng and Lao–Phutai language groups, which along with Thai are members of the Tai languages of the Kra–Dai language family. Central Thai (Khorat Thai) is also spoken by almost everyone and is the language used in education but natively spoken by one-fourth the population of in Nakhon Ratchasima Province only. The Khorat dialect, spoken by around 10,000 people, occupies a linguistic position somewhere between Lao and standard Thai, and is an archaic Central Thai dialect with heavy Khmer and some Lao influence.

Most of the &quot;tribal&quot; Tai languages, so called because of their origins in mountainous areas of Laos or their adherence to animism, are closely related to Isan, and all but Tai Yam are generally mutually intelligible. Even in areas with a heavy linguistic minority presence, native Isan speakers of Lao descent comprised anywhere from 60 to 74 per cent of the population, although minority language speakers are also bi- or trilingual in Isan, Thai or both.

Isan is home to many speakers of Austroasiatic languages, with one and one-half million speakers of the Northern Khmer dialect and one-half million speakers of the Kuy language, both of which are found in Isan&#x27;s southernmost provinces. Khmer is widely spoken in Buriram, Surin, and Sisaket, along the Cambodian border. Several small ethnic groups speak various other Austroasiatic languages, but most are fairly small and restricted to a few villages, or, like Vietnamese, spoken by small groups in cities.

Other languages spoken in Isan, mainly by tribal minorities, are:

==Education==

Education is well-provided for by the government in terms of numbers of establishments and is supplemented in the larger cities by the private sector (mostly Catholic and international schools). Following the national pattern of education in Thailand, there are primary (elementary) schools in all larger villages and (&quot;tambon&quot;) capitals, with secondary (high) schools to grade 12 (approximately age 18) in the district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) towns.
Many other secondary schools provide education only to grade 9, while some combined schools provide education from grade 1 through grade 9. Rural schools are generally less well equipped than the schools in the large towns and cities and the standard of instruction, particularly for the English language, is much lower. Many children of poorer families leave school after grade 6 (age 12) to work on the farms. A number move to areas of dense or tourist populations to work in the service industry.

Many primary schools operate their own websites and almost all schoolchildren in Isan, at least from junior high school age, are now (2008) largely computer literate in basic programs.

In 2001, there were 43 government vocational and polytechnic colleges throughout the region, several specialised training colleges in the private sector, and large colleges of agriculture and nursing in Udon Thani Province.

Universities are found in the major cities of Khon Kaen (one of the country&#x27;s largest), Nakhon Ratchasima, Ubon Ratchathani, and the smaller provincial capital of Maha Sarakham. Some Bangkok-based universities have small campuses in Isan, and Khon Kaen University maintains a large installation on the outskirts of Nong Khai. Most provinces have a government-run Rajabhat University, formerly known as Rajabhat Institutes, which originated as teacher training colleges.

==Culture==

Isan&#x27;s culture is predominantly Lao, and has much in common with that of neighboring Laos. This affinity is shown in the region&#x27;s cuisine, dress, temple architecture, festivals, and arts.

Isan food has elements most in common with Laos and is somewhat distinct from central Thai cuisine. The most obvious difference is the consumption of sticky rice that accompanies almost every meal rather than non-sticky long-grain rice. French and Vietnamese influences found in Lao cuisine are absent in Isan. Popular Lao dishes that are also staples in Isan include &quot;tam mak hung&quot;, or in central Thai, &quot;som tam&quot; (green papaya salad), &quot;larb&quot; (meat salad), and &quot;kai yang&quot; (grilled chicken). These dishes have spread to other parts of Thailand, but normally in versions that temper the extreme heat and sourness favored in Isan for the more moderate central Thai palate. Conversely, central Thai food has become popular in Isan. The people of Isan, a mixture of Lao, Vietnamese, Khmer, Mon, Cham, and other Tai groups, famously eat a wide variety of creatures, such as lizards, frogs, and fried insects, such as grasshoppers, crickets, silkworms, and dung beetles. Originally forced by poverty to be creative in finding foods, Isan people now savor these creatures as delicacies or snacks. Food is commonly eaten by hand using sticky rice pressed into a ball with the fingers of the right hand. Soups are a frequent element of any meal, and contain vegetables, herbs, noodles, chunks of fish, balls of ground pork, or a mixture of these. They are eaten using a spoon and chopsticks at the same time.

The traditional dress of Isan is the sarong. Women&#x27;s sarongs most often have an embroidered border at the hem, while men&#x27;s are in a checkered pattern. Men also wear a &quot;pakama&quot;, a versatile length of cloth which can be used as a belt, a money and document belt, headwear for protection from the sun, a hammock, or a swimsuit.

Isan is a center for the production of Thai silk. The trade received a major boost in the postwar years, when Jim Thompson popularized Thai silk among Westerners. One of the best-known types of Isan silk is &quot;mut-mee&quot;, which is tie-dyed to produce geometric patterns on the thread.
The Buddhist temple (or &quot;wat&quot;) is the major feature of most villages. These temples are used for not only religious ceremonies but also festivals, particularly mor lam, and as assembly halls. They are mostly built in Lao-style, but with less ornamentation than the more elaborate central Thai temples or the Lao-style temples in central Laos. Lao-style Buddha images are also prevalent.

The people of Isan celebrate many traditional festivals, such as the &quot;Bun Bungfai&quot; Rocket Festival. This fertility rite, originating in pre-Buddhist times, is celebrated in a number of locations both in Isan and in Laos. Other Isan festivals are the Candle Festival, which marks the start of vassa in July in Ubon and other locations; the Silk Festival in Khon Kaen, which promotes local handicrafts; the Elephant Round-up in Surin; and the &quot;bangfai phayanak&quot; or Naga fireballs of Nong Khai.

The main indigenous music of Isan is &quot;mor lam&quot;. It exists in a number of regional variants, plus modern forms. Since the late 1970s it has acquired greater exposure outside the region thanks to the presence of migrant workers in Bangkok. Many &quot;mor lam&quot; singers also sing central Thai &quot;luk thung&quot; music, and have produced the hybrid &quot;luk thung Isan&quot; form. Another form of folk music, &quot;kantrum&quot;, is popular with the Khmer minority in the south.

&quot;Mor lam&quot; needs a special mention as its festival-type production, which is very commonplace in Isan, has not been exported to other regions. When the locals speak of &quot;mor lam&quot; (pronounced &quot;mor&#x27;ram&quot; with stress on the second syllable), one will often hear them say &quot;pai doo morram&quot; (&quot;go see mor&#x27;ram&quot;). They are referring to the most common form of evening entertainment in the region. There are &quot;mor lam&quot; festivals on Friday or Saturday evenings in most villages. Usually, the rock-festival-sized stage is constructed either in a temple compound or on a sports field. Thousands of people sit on mats on the ground and watch the entertainment. The traditional music and song is accompanied by colorful choreography, executed by a group of up to 50 female (and some &quot;katoey&quot;) dancers. The fantastic costumes are changed several times throughout the program, and the transitions are bridged by often-raunchy gags, slapstick comedy, and speeches by local dignitaries. A &quot;mor lam&quot; festival is a family affair and the area is surrounded by food and drink stalls.

Although there is no tradition of written secular literature in the Isan language, in the latter half of the 20th century the region produced several notable writers, such as Khamsing Srinawk (who writes in Thai) and Pira Sudham (who writes in English).

Isan is known for producing a large number of muay Thai boxers. Many of the boxers from Srisaket, Buriram and Surin are of ethnically Suai (Kuy), Lao, or Khmer. Isan&#x27;s most famous sportsman is tennis player Paradorn Srichaphan, whose family is from Khon Kaen.

Marriage and courtship in Isan still mainly follows strict tradition, especially in rural areas, and most young women are married by the time they are 20 years old. Many girls, in spite of the legal requirement, marry as young as 14 to escape poverty, as marriage usually involves a dowry paid by the husband to the bride&#x27;s family. A dowry will not normally be less than 40,000 baht, and according to the status of the bride and/or her family, can exceed 300,000 baht.

Despite the influence of tradition, in 2013, according to UNICEF, 191.5 births out of every 1,000 births in Isan were to adolescents aged 15–19. This is four times higher than the 2018 global average of 44 births per 1,000 according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In September 2019, the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security set a target to reduce the number of unintended teenage pregnancies countrywide to 25 births per 1,000 by 2026.

Isan women rarely have boyfriends until they meet the man they will marry, and tradition requires that the betrothal is then announced. Younger fiancées will be chaperoned, usually by a female friend, brother, or sister while in the company of their future husband. The wedding ceremony usually takes place in the bride&#x27;s home and is normally officiated by one or several monks or a respected village elder who has been a monk. Young couples are increasingly registering their marriages at the city hall, which they can do if they are over 17. The extended family system is still very much the traditional social structure in Isan, with newlywed couples often living with in-laws or building a home on the family compound or farmland.

But it is not unusual for many women to remain single until much later. Tradition demands that the youngest or only daughter continue to live at home to take care of her parents. She is free to marry only when both parents are deceased. There is also the tradition that a woman should &quot;marry up&quot; in status. If a woman is tied to an occupation in a rural area as a farm or business owner, teacher, or similar profession, finding a suitable husband who is prepared to relocate is often not easy.

Water buffalo are a regular feature, even in the suburbs, being walked to and from the fields at dawn and dusk. Although rarely used nowadays for working the land, they are considered an important status symbol. The current value (2010) of one head of buffalo is about 20,000 baht (2010: US$620).

The cultural separation from central Thailand, combined with the region&#x27;s poverty and its people&#x27;s typically dark skin, have led to considerable discrimination against the people of Isan by non-ethnic Thais of Chinese descent. Even though many Isan people now work in the cities rather than in the fields, many hold lower-status jobs such as construction workers, stall vendors, and tuk-tuk taxi drivers, and discriminatory attitudes have been known to persist among the Thai-Chinese. Nevertheless, Isan food and music have both been enthusiastically adopted and adapted to the tastes of the rest of the country.

The process of Thaification, resulting from central Thais&#x27; perceived threat of Lao cultural dominance in the Isan region, has somewhat diluted Isan culture&#x27;s distinctive character, particularly in the cities and in provinces, such as Khorat, that are closest to the central Thai heartlands and have been under Thai rule the longest.

==Religion==
As in the rest of Thailand, the population is mostly Theravāda Buddhist, although this is combined with elements of animism. Larger cities have Christian churches. Many major district towns have a small Christian church or chapel, usually Roman Catholic, and there are others in rural areas.

The world-famous Buddhist monk Ajahn Chah was born in Isan.

==Transportation==
===Communications===
Traditionally, messages between the government in Bangkok and Isan provincial outposts had been carried by &quot;pony express&quot; or by fast boat. During the reign of King Chulalongkorn (r. 1868–1910), the Ministry of Interior maintained a schedule which specified that messages between Bangkok and Nong Khai took 12 days, between Bangkok and Ubon Ratchathani, 12 days, and between Bangkok and Luang Prabang, 17 days outbound and 13 days inbound.

===Rail===
Until 1900, when the first rail line from Bangkok to Khorat was opened, the shipment of goods took at least eight or nine days to go between the two. Now goods could be transported in a day. The speed with which goods could reach Khorat from Bangkok permitted the introduction into Isan of items previously too expensive or too perishable to transport. By 1928 a section of the northeastern rail line was extended to Ubon and by 1933 another section had reached Khon Kaen. It would not extend to Nong Khai until 1955. Trading patterns between the central region and Isan were forever altered.

The State Railway of Thailand has two main lines in Isan, both connecting the region to Bangkok. One runs east from Khorat, through Surin to Ubon; the other runs north through Khon Kaen and Udon to Nong Khai. In early-2009, a rail link from Nong Khai came into operation. It crosses the Friendship road bridge into Laos territory to a terminus a few kilometres north of the land border crossing. It remains unclear whether this line will be extended the remaining 20 kilometres to Vientiane, the capital of Laos.

===Road===
According to one report in 1895, it took about three weeks to travel overland by ox cart from Nong Khai to Khorat and another eight or nine days to travel from Khorat to Bangkok. Automobile transport made its first appearance in Isan sometime in the 1920s but did not expand rapidly until after the Second World War.

There are of highway, centered on the &quot;Thanon Mitraphap&quot; (&quot;Friendship Highway&quot;) from Khorat to Nong Khai built by the United States in the 1960s at a cost of US$20 million to supply its northeastern military bases. A road bridge (the &quot;Saphan Mitraphap&quot; or Friendship Bridge) jointly built by the Australian, Lao, and Thai governments forms the border crossing over the Mekong River on the outskirts of Nong Khai to Vientiane, the capital of Laos, about away.

Most roads in Isan are paved. All major roads interconnecting the provincial capitals are in excellent condition for driving, and most are centrally divided four or six-lane highways. Many roads connecting province capitals to larger district towns are also currently (2008) being widened to four-lane highways with median strips. The paving on some very minor roads in the poorer districts may be navigable with difficulty due to large, deep potholes. Unpaved, graded roads link some of the smaller, more remote villages, but they are comfortably navigable at normal driving speeds for wheeled vehicles. Most of the stretches of paved roads through villages are lighted at night, many with powerful sodium lighting, some of which are on independently solar-powered masts. Reflective &quot;cats-eyes&quot; marking the central line of two-lane roads are a common feature. Crash barriers are installed along the sides of dangerous bends and precipitous verges. Signposting is excellent and follows international style. Since 2002 (with the exception of some poorer sub-districts), all signs are bilingual in Thai and Roman script.

The main highways have frequent, Western-style rest and refueling stations which accept payment by major credit/debit cards. In 2006, all fuel stations sell 91 and 95 octane gasoline/petrol and diesel fuel. LPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas) and NGV (natural gas for vehicles) were till recently very rare outside the cities of Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, and Udon Thani. many new LPG and NGV stations have opened. Since 2009, bio-diesel fuel has become increasingly available.

===Air===
In 1960 air service by Thai Airways to several northeastern towns was inaugurated. By 1963 there were regular flights between Bangkok and Nakhon Phanom, Ubon, Khon Kaen, and Udon.

There are airports at Khorat (at the present time no scheduled services due to its proximity to Bangkok making air service difficult to justify financially), Khon Kaen (domestic), Ubon Ratchathani (domestic), Udon Thani (international), Nakhon Phanom (domestic, scheduled services), Sakon Nakhon (domestic, scheduled services), Roi Et (domestic, scheduled services), Buriram (domestic, scheduled services) and Loei (domestic, scheduled services).

Domestic air travel between the capital and the region is well developed, and has become a viable alternative to rail, long-distance bus, and self-driving. Fares are cheap by foreign standards, and Udon and Khon Kaen which both opened brand new airport terminals in 2005 and 2006 respectively, are served by many daily flights and also have routes connecting other major destinations in Thailand with some companies operating wide-bodied aircraft. Most domestic flights to and from Bangkok operate to and from Don Muang, the original Bangkok international airport, while Thai Airways flights serve Bangkok International Airport in Suvarnabhumi.

===Bus===
Buses provide mass transport throughout the region. All provincial cities are connected to Bangkok by daily and nightly, direct, air-conditioned bus routes. All district amphoe towns operate at least one similar nightly route to and from Bangkok. All towns and villages are interconnected with frequent services of &quot;songthaew&quot; (, lit. &quot;two rows&quot;) a covered truck-style bus or covered pick-up trucks with bench seats in the cargo bed.

Taxi transport is not well developed, even in the very large cities, where &quot;samlor&quot; (, ), three-wheeled motorcycle taxis similar to the Bangkok tuk-tuk, provide the mainstay of urban transport. The large cities do have some pick-up trucks operating on regular inner-city and suburban routes. Airports are served by collective vans, which tend to be expensive for the local population, and &quot;samlors&quot; for private hire.

===Waterways===
In this region, rapids and variable flow make navigation difficult on the Mekong River, so large boat traffic is limited in connection with downriver areas. Bridges are rare because of the high cost of spanning the wide river; passenger and vehicle ferries link its two sides. The Second Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge, spanning the Mekong between the cities of Mukdahan (Thailand) and Savannakhet (Laos), was completed and officially opened for traffic on 20 December 2006. Some new bridges, not included on the 2005 maps, have been built over smaller rivers and dams. Passenger and vehicle ferries also operate across some large reservoirs.

Improved infrastructure and ease of travel restrictions between Thailand and Laos has allowed the continued movement of thousands of people every day, with people on either side crossing the river to visit relatives, shop, participate in religious festivals, conduct business or day-trip, with the Nong Khai-Vientiane Mukdahan-Savannakhét and Nakhon Phanom-Thakhèk border crossings particularly important due to the construction of bridges. Other major border crossings include Bueng Kan-Pakxan and the only non-Mekong checkpoint Chong Mek-Vangtao, although ferries cross the river in other areas. The familiarity of the language makes travel and business easy for Isan speakers, who are able to use their language freely in Laos and be understood.

==Administrative divisions==
Isan is divided into 20 provinces, grouped into three statistical subregions. Nakhon Ratchasima Province is considered by some to be in central Thailand.

Note: Populations as of 31 December 2019.

Isan returns 136 of the national parliament&#x27;s 400 constituency MPs. In the 2005 election, the Thai Rak Thai party took 126 of these seats, with six for Chart Thai and two each for the Democrat party and Mahachon Party.

<text>The second USS &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; (ACR/CA-4), also referred to as Armored Cruiser No. 4, and later renamed Pittsburgh, was a United States Navy armored cruiser, the lead ship of her class. She was originally assigned the name Nebraska but was renamed Pennsylvania on 7 March 1901.

==Construction==
She was laid down on 7 August 1901, by William Cramp &amp; Sons of Philadelphia, launched on 22 August 1903. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was sponsored by Miss Coral Quay, daughter of Senator Matthew S. Quay of Pennsylvania, and commissioned on 9 March 1905, with Captain Thomas C. McLean in command.

==Service history==

===Pre-World War I===
&quot;Pennsylvania&quot; operated on the east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean Sea until 8 September 1906, when she cleared Newport for the Asiatic Station, returning to San Francisco on 27 September 1907, for west coast duty. She visited Chile and Peru in 1910.

At 10:48, on 18 January 1911, Eugene Ely, flew a Curtiss Model D from Tanforan Racetrack in San Bruno, California, and at 11:01, landed on board &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; while she lay at anchor off Hunters Point, in San Francisco Bay. The plane made a smooth landing from astern onto a specially built platform. At 11:58, the plane took off and returned to Selfridge Field, completing the earliest demonstration of the adaptability of aircraft to shipboard operations.

In another of these early demonstrations, civilian aircraft designer and entrepreneur Glenn Curtiss taxied a hydroaeroplane alongside &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; as she lay anchored in San Diego Harbor, during the forenoon watch on 17 February 1911. The plane landed alongside the ship at 08:45 and sailors manned the cruiser&#x27;s crane to hoist the machine on board. At 09:05, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; hoisted the aircraft out and it returned to base.

While in reserve at Puget Sound, from 1 July 1911 – 30 May 1913, the cruiser trained naval militia. She was renamed Pittsburgh on 27 August 1912, to free the name Pennsylvania for a new battleship.

===World War I===
Recommissioning, &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; patrolled the west coast of Mexico, during the troubled times of insurrection that led to American involvement with the Veracruz landing in April 1914. Later she served as flagship for Admiral William B. Caperton—Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet—during South American patrols and visits during World War I. Cooperating with the British, she scouted German raiders and acted as a powerful deterrent against their penetration of the eastern Pacific.


While at Rio de Janeiro, in October and November 1918, failure to implement quarantine procedures by Captain George Bradshaw, led to the spread of the deadly strain of Spanish influenza on ship, sickening 663 sailors (80% of the crew) and killing 58 of them.

Future Rear Admiral Ellis M. Zacharias served as a line officer aboard &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; during World War I. Future Governor of American Samoa George Landenberger commanded the vessel in 1930.

===Inter-war period===
Returning to the east coast, &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; prepared for duty as flagship for Commander, US Naval Forces in the eastern Mediterranean, for which she sailed from Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 19 June 1919. Cruising the Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea, and Black Sea, she joined in the massive relief operations and other humanitarian concerns with which the Navy carried out its quasi-diplomatic functions in this troubled area. In June 1920, she sailed north to visit French and British ports and cruise the Baltic Sea on further relief assignments.

On 9 September 1920, she ran aground on rocks in the Baltic Sea off Libau. She was assisted by and ; &quot;Frederick&quot; escorted her to Sheerness Royal Dockyard, Kent, England which she reached at 10:00 o&#x27;clock in the morning of 23 September. Before 12 October she had moved up river to Chatham Dockyard where she went into dry dock. On that date a team from &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; routed a team of British officers 21–8 at baseball. The following month, with &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; still in dry dock, a court-martial absolved Captain Todd of blame for the grounding but the navigator and watch officer were held accountable. She returned to decommission at Philadelphia, on 15 October 1921.

Recommissioned on 2 October 1922, &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; returned to European and Mediterranean waters as flagship of Naval Forces Europe, arriving in Gibraltar on 19 October. On 23 October, she hoisted the flag of Vice Admiral Long when returned to the US. By 10 July 1923, &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; was in the harbor at Cherbourg, France, to disembark 3 officers and 60 enlisted men of her Marine Detachment. They were detailed to travel to the dedication of the Belleau Wood National Monument to the American Expeditionary Force. The Battle of Belleau Wood was where the US Marine Corps made a famous stand during the Allied Campaign of 1918. In 1923, when docked in Amsterdam, the crew of &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; took part in another baseball game, this time against a team of Dutch players. The details of the game are not known, but it is known that &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; team won. It would be the first of several games Dutch players would play with US Navy crews. &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; became flagship for two of the Commanders-in-Chief, US Naval Forces European Waters, Admiral Philip Andrews in 1924–1925 and Vice Admiral Roger Welles in 1925–1926.

The ship arrived at New York on 17 July 1926, to prepare for flagship duty with the Asiatic Fleet, during which time she was partially refitted, including the removal of her forward stack (making her unique to her class) and removal and plating over several 3-inch guns. She sailed on 16 October, for Yantai, arriving on 23 December. Early in January 1927, she landed sailors and Marines to protect Americans and other foreigners in Shanghai, from the turmoil and fighting of the Chinese power struggle. When Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s National Revolutionary Army won control of Shanghai, in March, &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; resumed patrol operations and exercises with the Asiatic Fleet. Closing her long career of service, she carried the Governor General of the Philippines, Dwight F. Davis, on a courtesy cruise to such ports as Saigon, Bangkok, Singapore, Belawan, Batavia (Jakarta), Surabaya, Bali, Makassar, and Sandakan, returning to Manila, on 15 April 1931. Six days later, she steamed for Suez, &quot;en route&quot; to Hampton Roads, arriving on 26 June. She was decommissioned on 10 July, and under the terms of the London Naval Treaty, sold for scrapping to Union Shipbuilding, Baltimore, Maryland on 21 December.

==Bow ornament==
&quot;Pittsburgh&quot;″s bow ornament was presented to the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where it was installed overlooking Junction Hollow at the western edge of the school&#x27;s campus. Today, the ornament is on display at Soldiers and Sailors National Military Museum and Memorial; a replica of it is still in place at the modern Carnegie Mellon University.

==Memorial bell==
 The number 3 bell at Rochester Cathedral, England, bears the inscription &quot;U.S.S. PITTSBURGH IN MEMORY OF 1920&quot;. For many years the reason for this inscription was a mystery. Then a researcher found the explanation in the &quot;Chatham News&quot; of 17 December 1920. That issue included a letter from Captain J.W. Todd, who commanded &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; in 1920. Captain Todd thanked the dean of the cathedral for various hospitality events during the two and a half months that &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; was in dry dock at Chatham. He enclosed a cheque for £52 10s to pay for the recasting of the bell, and suggested the inscription.

<text>The first USS &quot;West Virginia&quot; (ACR-5/CA-5), also referred to as &quot;Armored Cruiser No. 5&quot;, and later renamed Huntington, was a United States Navy armored cruiser.

The ship was launched on 18 April 1903 by Newport News Drydock &amp; ShipbuildingCo., Newport News, Virginia, sponsored by Miss Katherine V. White, and commissioned on 23 February 1905, Captain C. H. Arnold in command.

==Pre-World War I==
After shakedown training, &quot;West Virginia&quot; cruised with the New York Naval Militia as a unit of the Atlantic Fleet until 30 September 1906 when she sailed for duty with the Asiatic Fleet. The ship remained with the Asiatic Fleet (which was downgraded in status to that of First Squadron of the Pacific Fleet in early 1907) on training operations for two years, and after overhaul at Mare Island in 1908 joined the Pacific Fleet for similar exercises along the West Coast of the United States. In 1911–1912, she made a cruise with the Fleet to Hawaiian waters and in 1914 steamed on special duty off the west coast of Mexico for the protection of American interests. She remained off Mexico during the Veracruz crisis, and returned to Bremerton, Washington, to become a part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

&quot;West Virginia&quot; remained at Bremerton, Washington, until 20 September 1916, when she again sailed to Mexico for the protection of American lives and property and to back up U.S. diplomacy. While on this service, she was renamed Huntington on 11 November to permit the assignment of her old name to a newly authorized battleship, . After five months service off Mexico, she steamed to Mare Island for the installation of catapult devices on the quarterdeck and equipment to accommodate four seaplanes on the boat deck ways.

==World War I==

&quot;Huntington&quot; was detached from the Reserve Force and placed in full commission on 5 April 1917. She departed Mare Island on 11 May and steamed to Pensacola, Florida, via the Panama Canal. Detached from the Pacific Fleet after her arrival in Florida on 28 May, she spent the next two months at the Naval Air Station Pensacola, engaging in a series of important early experiments with balloons and seaplanes launched from the deck. The cruiser then sailed for Hampton Roads on 1 August and arrived New York five days later. There, &quot;Huntington&quot; formed with a convoy of six troopships bound for France departing on 8 September. &quot;En route&quot;, several balloon observation flights were made, and on one of these on 17 September, the balloon was forced down by a squall while being brought back on board and the observer, Lieutenant (jg) Henry W. Hoyt, was knocked out of the basket and caught underwater entangled in its rigging. Seeing the emergency, shipfitter Patrick McGunigal jumped overboard to release the crewman from the balloon basket, by then overturned and underwater. For his heroic action, McGunigal was awarded World War I&#x27;s 3rd Medal of Honor. The day after the rescue, the convoy was turned over to American destroyers in European waters; and &quot;Huntington&quot; steamed back to Hampton Roads, arriving 30 September.

After replenishing at Norfolk, &quot;Huntington&quot; sailed to New York on 5 October to have her catapult and seaplanes removed. She got underway on 27 October and arrived Halifax, Nova Scotia, two days later to embark together with on a high-level US Commission to confer with the Allies. Presidential envoy, Colonel Edward M. House; Admiral William S. Benson; General Tasker H. Bliss; and other dignitaries took passage in &quot;Huntington&quot;, arriving Davenport, England on 7 November, to be met by British officials. &quot;Huntington&quot; departed for New York, via Hampton Roads, arriving on 27 November.

Subsequently, the cruiser returned to the important duty of escorting convoys of troops and supplies to Europe, making nine such voyages to Europe and back from 19 February-13 November 1918. In addition, &quot;Huntington&quot; made three coastal convoy passages from New York to Hampton Roads. She entered Brooklyn Navy Yard on 17 November for conversion to a troop transport.

&quot;Huntington&quot; made nine trips across the Atlantic Ocean with the following ships in convoy:

==Inter-war period==
Assigned to Cruiser and Transport Force, Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Huntington&quot; next sailed for France to bring home veterans of the European fighting. She departed New York on 17 December, arrived Brest 29 December, and brought over 1,700 passengers to New York on 14 January 1919. The ship made five more voyages to France and return, bringing home nearly 12,000 troops, and terminated her last voyage at Boston on 5 July. Detached from Transport Force, she was reassigned to Cruiser Force and became flagship of Flying Squadron 1 on 8 July. &quot;Huntington&quot; decommissioned at Portsmouth Navy Yard, Kittery, Maine on 1 September 1920. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 March 1930 and sold in accordance with the London Naval Treaty on 30 August. The bell from the armored cruiser was given to West Virginia University, dedicated in 1967, and now occupies a place in Oglebay Plaza along with the mast from the USS West Virginia (BB-48).

<text>Fairuza Balk (born May 21, 1974) is an American actress, musician, and visual artist. Known for her portrayals of distinctive characters—often with a dark edge and &quot;goth-girl&quot; persona—she has appeared in numerous independent films and blockbuster features.

Following a series of television roles, Balk made her feature film debut as Dorothy Gale in &quot;Return to Oz&quot; (1985), for which she was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Starring Performance. Her career progressed with parts in films such as &quot;Valmont&quot; (1989) and &quot;Gas Food Lodging&quot; (1992), the latter earning her an Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead. After roles in &quot;Imaginary Crimes&quot; (1994) and &quot;Things to Do in Denver When You&#x27;re Dead&quot; (1995), Balk received acclaim and a cult following for her portrayal of Nancy Downs in &quot;The Craft&quot; (1996), which earned her an MTV Movie Award. Her other credits include &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; (1996), &quot;American History X&quot; (1998), &quot;The Waterboy&quot; (1998), &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2000), &quot;Personal Velocity: Three Portraits&quot; (2002), &quot;Deuces Wild&quot; (2002), &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Knocking&quot; (2005), &quot;Wild Tigers I Have Known&quot; (2006), &quot;Humboldt County&quot; (2008), and &quot;Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans&quot; (2009).

Outside of film, Balk portrayed Mildred Hubble in the 1986 television adaptation of &quot;The Worst Witch&quot;, based on the book series of the same name. She played the recurring role of Ginger on Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; in 2015, and starred as Lizzie Thomas in the Amazon Prime series &quot;Paradise City&quot; in 2021. Balk has been releasing music since 2010 under the name of her unsigned act, Armed Love Militia.

==Early life==
Balk was born on May 21, 1974, in Point Reyes, California, to Solomon Feldthouse (born David Earle Scaff; 1940–2021), a musician, and Cathryn Balk (1944–2018), a belly dancer. The name Fairuza is of Persian origin meaning &quot;turquoise&quot;. Her father gave her the name for the color of her eyes. Feldthouse was one of the founding members of the 1960s psychedelic rock group Kaleidoscope, and was also a traveling folk musician. 

Until the age of two, Balk lived in Jackson, Michigan, with her mother. They then moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where she began acting at age six. They moved to London and then to Paris for another role. They remained there for six months before returning to Vancouver.
Balk bought an occult shop in Los Angeles while filming the 1996 film &quot;The Craft&quot;.

==Career==
Balk took her first acting course around the summer of 1983, where she was taught how to look at a camera and not be shy. Her first experience was in a British Columbia tourism commercial, for which she earned $100. Her debut role was in a 1983 television film titled &quot;The Best Christmas Pageant Ever&quot;. While in London, Balk was cast by Walt Disney Productions to star as Dorothy Gale in &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, the sequel to MGM&#x27;s 1939 musical &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot; This role led to others, including that of Mildred Hubble in &quot;The Worst Witch&quot;. In 1988, at age 14, she moved to Paris to work on &quot;Valmont&quot; with Miloš Forman. She decided to take correspondence courses and went back to Hollywood, where she gained increasing notice as an actress. In 1992, she was awarded an Independent Spirit Award as best actress for her performance in the Allison Anders film &quot;Gas Food Lodging&quot;.

In 1996, she appeared in a lead role in &quot;The Craft&quot;, in which her character formed a teenage coven with characters portrayed by Neve Campbell, Rachel True and Robin Tunney. Since then, Balk has continued to find roles, primarily dark ones. In 1996, she co-starred in &quot;The Island of Dr Moreau&quot;. In 1998, she played a neo-Nazi opposite Edward Norton in &quot;American History X&quot;, and was featured in &quot;The Waterboy&quot;, alongside Adam Sandler. Since 2000, she has appeared in over a dozen films and was briefly in a band called G-13. She has also done voice work for animated films, TV shows and video games, including &quot;Justice League&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; and &quot;Lords of EverQuest&quot;. The 2007 documentary &quot;Return to Oz: The Joy That Got Away&quot; was dedicated to her.

In 2010, Armed Love Militia, Balk&#x27;s musical outlet, released the single &quot;Stormwinds&quot;. The track was written and sung by Balk. Armed Love Militia continued, with Balk collaborating on an EP with singer and songwriter Mel Sanson.

In 2011, Balk began to exhibit art in Los Angeles and New York. On August 4, 2012, she participated in the group show &#x27;MiXTAPE&#x27;, with other notable artists Mark Ryden, Camille Rose Garcia, Jessicka Addams, and Marion Peck. Artists were asked to pick a song and create art inspired by that song. Balk chose the song &quot;Nuages&quot; by Django Reinhardt and created a 16&quot;x20&quot;x12&quot; mixed-media sculpture. The eclectic mix of songs chosen were featured for digital download on iTunes.

In 2017, the emo puppet band Fragile Rock performed a song titled &quot;Fairuza Balk&quot; on their NPR Tiny Desk Concert.

<doc id="203866" wikidata="Q1833583" url="?curid=203866" title="Phoumi Nosavan">
<text>Major General Phoumi Nosavan (; ; 27 January 1920 – 3 November 1985) was a Laotian military officer who served as the military strongman of Laos during the Laotian Civil War in the 1960s.

== Early life ==
Phoumi Nosavan was born in Savannakhet, the French Protectorate of Laos, on 27 January 1920. Originally a civil servant in the French colonial administration of Laos, he joined the resistance movement against the Japanese occupiers during the last year of World War II. He was exiled in 1946 due to his opposition to the French return to colonizing Laos. In early 1949, he returned to Laos to begin a military career after the collapse of the anti-French Lao Issara government. By 1955, he was Chief of Staff of the brand-new Royal Lao Army. While in that position, he was largely responsible for appointing senior officers into command positions in the Military Regions of Laos. Following that, in 1957, he was the first Lao officer to be schooled in France at the &quot;École de Guerre&quot; (War College). While in France, he became acquainted with Central Intelligence Agency operative John F. &quot;Jack&quot; Hasey. Phoumi returned to Laos to become a founding member of the Committee for the Defence of National Interests on 17 June 1958. On 25 December 1959, he took control of the capital of Vientiane and the nation in a bloodless coup.

Drawing military power from his status as a general officer and political power from his appointment as defense minister, Phoumi would remain dominant in Laotian political life for the next six years. He would be temporarily removed from power during an August 1960 coup by Captain Kong Le, only to return with a Central Intelligence Agency backed counter-coup in December. From 1961 to 1963, he carried out military operations contrary to his American advisers&#x27; wishes, figuring the U.S. would have to support him regardless. His American backers periodically curtailed military aid to his forces to compel his compliance, even as the Royal Lao Army&#x27;s performance deteriorated. The aftermath of the Battle of Vientiane in early 1961, as well as the disastrous Battle of Luang Namtha in 1962 and the lost Battle of Lak Sao in, illustrated his shortcomings as a military commander. Phoumi&#x27;s influence was whittled away, so he attempted to retain power via coups, including one in 1964 and one in 1965. The 1964 coup being unsuccessful, he was stripped of his troop command. His final coup attempt in January 1965 was plotted with borrowed troops. When that bid to regain power failed, he fled into exile in the neighboring Kingdom of Thailand. He was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; to 20 years imprisonment. Phoumi Nosavan died in Bangkok, Thailand in November 1985.

==Colonial Service==

Phoumi Nosavan was a prominent Lao military and political figure of the Laotian Civil War. He was of Chinese-Lao heritage. He was born in Savannakhet, the French Protectorate of Laos. He was educated there and in Vientiane. He became a civil servant in the French colonial government. As World War II wound down in 1945, he joined the resistance movement opposed to the Japanese occupation of Laos. He belonged to the secretive &quot;Lao Pen Lao&quot; (Laos for the Lao). He was also in the short-lived Lao Issara (Free Laos) government until the French return in 1946 drove him into exile in the Kingdom of Thailand. As part of the &quot;Lao Issara&quot; command, he briefly ran their military operations in southern Laos in coordination with the Viet Minh.

In early 1949, he returned to Thailand before repatriating himself to Laos. In 1950, he joined the nascent Laotian National Army (&quot;Armee Nationale Laotienne&quot;) and served as a military adviser at the 1954 Geneva Conference. By 1955, he had risen to lieutenant colonel, serving as Chief of Staff of the newly constituted Royal Lao Army in the newly independent Kingdom of Laos.

==Service After Independence==

Under Colonel Phoumi, there was a massive appointment of military officers subordinate to him into command positions in the Royal Lao Army. One of the criteria for these appointments was seniority in the military. However, the urban elite families were interested in procuring these command positions; they brought influence to bear to secure appointments for their family members or adherents. As the families were regionally based, officers from the elite both saw government service as a tool for political advancement and as another way to command the allegiance of the Lao peasantry in their region.

Phoumi then attended the &quot;Ecole de Guerre&quot; (War College) from 1957 to 1958; he was the first Lao officer to do so. He took Siho Lamphouthacoul as his aide de camp. While there, Phoumi became acquainted with Central Intelligence Agency operative John F. &quot;Jack&quot; Hasey. Phoumi returned from France to command the newly created Military Region 5; he added the political post of Deputy Minister for Internal Security. When the May 1958 national election results favored the communist candidates, the rightwing Committee for the Defence of National Interests was formed with American support on 17 June 1958 to counterbalance the leftists. Phoumi was a charter member of the CDNI.

Promoted to colonel, Phoumi joined Phoui Sananikone&#x27;s government to assume the portfolio for national defense in 1959. On 4 September 1959, the Royal Lao Government appealed to the United Nations for an intervention against invasion by North Vietnamese communists. Sparked by a Washington Post article by Joseph Alsop, as well as a 5 September editorial by the paper, on 7 September, the United States pushed for a United Nations subcommittee of its Security Council be sent to Laos to investigate the charges of aggression against it. Also, on 7 September, Phoui proclaimed martial law even as his government insisted that &quot;foreign invaders&quot; had vacated Houaphanh Province. While Phoui made that announcement, Phoumi told the Associated Press (AP) that if the United Nations turned down the Lao request, the Royal Lao Government (RLG) would request help from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). As the Laotian crisis began to gather skeptical coverage in the international press, Phoumi flew to Bangkok for a four-day visit. Once there, he solicited aid from his uncle, Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat. Sarit declined help unless Phoumi had American backing. The United Nations subcommittee visited Laos from 15 to 20 September; however, it received no persuasive proof of an invasion. In any case, neither the United Nations nor SEATO aid arrived. In mid-November, Secretary-General of the United Nations Dag Hammarskjöld visited Laos. He advised the Royal Lao Government that its policy should be strictly neutral if it is expected to receive support from the United Nations.

==Phoumi Runs The Nation==

===1960 Laotian Coups===

On 16 December 1959, Phoui fired the CDNI ministers from his cabinet, including Phoumi. On 25 December, General Phoumi took charge of the government in a bloodless coup, using Captain Kong Le and his 2nd Parachute Battalion (&quot;2e Bataillon de Parachutistes&quot;) to occupy Vientiane&#x27;s infrastructure. The takeover had the approval of King Sisavang Vatthana; moreover, Phoumi was the only one chosen by his monarch for the new government. Phoumi believed he could impose an authoritarian &quot;directed democracy&quot; upon an ignorant populace for their welfare.

When the 1960 election results again favored leftists and communists, Phoumi founded the &quot;Paxa Sangkhom&quot; (People&#x27;s Society) political party on 12 May 1960 as a means of furthering his political ends. It was about this time he became friends with Thao Ma, head of the Royal Lao Air Force.

On 10 August 1960, Kong Le would oust Phoumi in his own coup. In return, Phoumi would return to power with the aid of the Central Intelligence Agency (including John Hasey) on 16 December in the Battle of Vientiane during his counter-coup. He was aided in this by Generals Kouprasith Abhay and Siho Lamphouthacoul. Phoumi reclaimed the Ministry of Defense after his counter-coup reclaimed the country, as well as becoming the deputy prime minister on 4 January 1961. He appointed his close friend Thao Ma to command the Royal Lao Air Force; he would act only on Phoumi&#x27;s commands.

As Kong Le established his Neutralist Armed Forces (&quot;Forces Armées Neutralistes&quot; – FAN) in Military Region 2 as a third party in the Laotian Civil War, Phoumi ordered a pursuit. It moved slowly northward toward the Plain of Jars. On 13 March, a FAN counter-offensive quickly wiped out all the Royal Lao Army gains. To bolster Phoumi&#x27;s forces, Operation Millpond was founded to secretively import American air power on the Royal Lao Government&#x27;s side. Phoumi also tried to co-opt the Operation Momentum guerrillas, despite his dislike and distrust of the Hmong hill tribes.

Phoumi himself remained in Vientiane to maintain his control over the nation, and to organize the Royal Lao Army battalions into regiments during March 1961; the Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) also received their first strike aircraft, in the form of four T-6 Texans. Phoumi rewarded his subordinate officers with promotions and appointments. He also promoted himself to Major general and began construction of a downtown monument in Vientiane celebrating his victory in the battle for control of the city. Meanwhile, President Dwight D. Eisenhower was so concerned that Phoumi might lose Laos to the communists that an American task force was placed on alert, and the Royal Thai Government was approached by the Americans as a source of reinforcements.

The International Control Commission established by the 1954 Geneva Conference was renewed and engineered a truce on 11 May 1961, while the details of a new Lao government could be settled. On 19 June 1961, the three feuding princes met in Zürich, with Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk mediating. On the 22nd, Prince Souphanouvong, Prince Souvanna Phouma, and Prince Boun Oum agreed in principle upon provisional rule by an interim Lao government until elections could be held. However, Phoumi stalled upon details of the coalition government, insisting upon knowing the composition of the new cabinet. He intended to stonewall it until he could foster a new government headed by King Sisavang Vatthana instead. His visit to Washington, DC after a Zürich meeting left him believing that the U.S. would back him, no matter what the circumstances. After his return to Laos, despite a ceasefire, troops under his command probed between Royal Lao Army and communist/Pathet Lao lines, retreating whenever they came up against the enemy. The communists fought them off, but did not retaliated.

Much to the despair of the American advisers attached to his forces, Phoumi preferred to promote officers known for their incompetence while demoting his competent officers as Phoumi feared able and intelligent officers might be able to overthrow him while inept and stupid officers never would. General William H. Craig of the U.S. Army wrote after visiting Laos in August-September 1961 that: &quot;He is the only driving force in Laos but to make him function successfully, we must get tough with him&quot;. Craig wanted Phoumi to change his promotion policy to start promoting able officers at the expense of his inept appointees.

In late December, Phoumi accused the United States of a &quot;defeatist policy&quot;, and of treating the Royal Lao Government &quot;like a small child&quot;. There were months of wrangling concerning his role in the proposed coalition cabinet. On 25 March 1962, Phoumi, W. Averell Harriman, and Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat met in Nong Khai, Thailand. Sarit, who was kin to Phoumi, tried to convince him to join a coalition that split control of the military and police on three ways among the Royalists, Neutralists, and the Pathet Lao. When Phoumi would not accept, he was subjected to a heated tirade by Harriman. However, as the latter was under orders to not cut U.S. aid to Laos, he had no leverage and Phoumi remained obdurate. He would not accept that the Defense and Interior ministries should be occupied by neutralists instead of rightists.

===Battle of Luang Namtha===

Elsewhere in early 1962, skirmishing between the communists and the Royal Lao Army began on the Chinese border in far northwestern Laos in Luang Namtha. Phoumi directed his troops into the ensuing Battle of Luang Namtha in the beliefs that the possession of that border town could be settled by military means, and that his American backers would be forced to support his actions. For their part, the Americans favored a diplomatic or political solution to the border incursion. They suspended U.S. foreign military aid to Laos, including the payroll for the Royal Lao Army, to sway him to their point of view. Phoumi turned to a secretive source of income by deputizing General Ouane Rattikone to trade opium to generate the needed military funding.

In any case, the battle ended with the Royal Lao Army being trounced by half its number of communists. The Royal Lao Army&#x27;s retreat took it from the Lao/Chinese border to the Mekong River. The Royal Lao Government not only lost control of Luang Namtha; it also lost a third of its maneuver battalions, including its elite paratroops. The Royal Lao Government was forced by this defeat into the Second Coalition Government. Phoumi was forced to surrender his political posts as the Defense and Interior ministries, and was reduced to sharing the deputy prime minister post with the communist Prince Souphanouvong, with either having the right to veto cabinet decisions. After the Luang Namtha defeat, U.S. President John F. Kennedy wanted Phoumi out of politics, and strictly limited to a military role. President Kennedy directed Ambassador Winthrop G. Brown to make it known to Vientiane&#x27;s politico-military elite that Phoumi no longer had the confidence of the U.S. for his political actions.

==Neutrality And More Coups==

===Neutrality===

The International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos was signed in July 1962; by its October deadline for foreign troop departure, it became apparent that at least 5,000 Vietnamese communists still remained in Laos.

In early 1963, during the lull that followed the establishment of national neutrality, Phoumi headquartered himself in Savannakhet. He ignored the International Agreement&#x27;s proviso that he should disband his less able units. Instead, he beefed up the Royal Lao Army to almost 50,000 strong. He also quietly courted the FAN, airlifting supplies to them and urging them to ally with the Royalists. Despite the American acceptance of the FAN as allies, by 18 May 1963, Ambassador Leonard Unger performed a re-examination of Royalist forces. Because of their poor combat performance, Unger thought the Royal Lao Army and FAN would serve only to warn the government of communist attacks without offering significant resistance. However, the State Department ordered Unger to watch for opportunities for the Royal Lao Army to go on the offensive. In April, Phoumi arranged for the RLAF to receive eight T-28 Trojans from the Royal Thai Air Force. With U.S. State Department consent, the RLAF was strengthened by swapping in T-28s for worn-out T-6 Harvards on a one-to-one basis so the International Agreement was not breached. Whereas the T-6s had used only rockets and .30 caliber ammunition for strafing ground targets, the T-28s were cleared to carry and drop bombs. Additional transport craft were also supplied to the RLAF.

By November 1963, the positions of the FAN on the Plain of Jars needed reinforcement. In response, Royal Lao Army garrison troops were moved from Thakhek to Military Region 2. However, despite the resultant weakening of military forces in Military Region 3, Phoumi planned an offensive there. He thought that a thrust to the border village of Lak Sao would split a North Vietnamese intrusion. Phoumi found himself at odds with his American backers, who believed that an advance that would almost reach the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam would outrun supplies while inviting Vietnamese retaliation. When Phoumi did launch the assault, the ensuing Battle of Lak Sao would indeed end with the Royal Lao Army and its Neutralist allies dispersed in disarray by enemy counterattacks. The communists took back Lak Sao and also occupied the entire Nakay Plateau by 1 February 1964.

===More Coups===
On 18 April 1964, General Siho Lamphouthicoul, who had aided Phoumi&#x27;s return to power in December 1960, sent his Directorate of National Coordination police to secure the streets of Vientiane. Phoumi sat out the short-lived coup, which was ended on 23 April by U.S. Ambassador Leonard Unger&#x27;s orders to Siho and his co-conspirator Kouprasith Abhay. Despite Phoumi&#x27;s non-participation, in the aftermath of the coup, Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma dismissed Phoumi as Defense Minister, depriving him of troops to command. However, Phoumi&#x27;s brother still headed the Lao customs service, and diverted most customs fees for personal use. Siho and Kouprasith Abhay then demanded some share of Phoumi&#x27;s illicit operations; opium, gold and liquor smuggling operations, as well as his prostitution and gambling concerns.

Despite his demotion, Phoumi had somehow retained control of a training battalion in Vientiane. On 4 August 1964, he used them to seize Vientiane. General Kouprasith promptly turned out his local troops to suppress the insurrection while Siho sat out the coup. The training battalion was disbanded, depriving Phoumi of his last troops under his command.

==Exile And Death==
On 27 January 1965, Phoumi managed to convince one of his adherents to order a transfer of troops from Military Region 2 to Vientiane to ward off a purported attack by MR 5 troops. His coup, and a simultaneous one by Bounleut Saycocie, both failed. Phoumi fled into exile in Thailand. In Laos, General Ouane Rattikone remained as the Royal Lao Army Chief of Staff. General Kouprasith Abhay held Vientiane and the surrounding Military Region 5. Junior officers were sent to head up units stationed on Phoumi&#x27;s home ground of Savannakhet. Phoumi&#x27;s birthday coup had failed because he had no troops to command.

Phoumi convinced a loyal subordinate to return to Vientiane and retrieve a cache of gold, which he used to settle into a comfortable retirement in Songkhla, Thailand. However, while still in Laos, Phoumi had shielded his friend Thao Ma from problems with competing generals. Now that he was in exile, Kouprasith Abhay, Ouane Rattikone, and Oudone Sananikone began conspiring to diminish Thao Ma&#x27;s command; this led to the latter&#x27;s 1966 coup.

Phoumi spent the 1970s in exile at Bangkok. He was sentenced by a Lao court in absentia to 20 years prison. In 1981, he allowed the Thai-backed United Front for the Liberation of the Lao People to use his name. He remained in exile, dying in Bangkok in 1985.

<text>Stung Treng (, UNGEGN: &quot;Stœ̆ng Trêng&quot; ; , , ; lit. &quot;River of Reeds&quot;) is a province of Cambodia in the northeast. It borders the provinces of Ratanakiri to the east, Mondulkiri and Kratié to the south and Kampong Thom and Preah Vihear to the west. Its northern boundary is Cambodia&#x27;s international border with Laos. The Mekong River bisects the province. The province is mostly covered by forest, but logging and fishing put high pressure on the forest and fishery reserves.

==Etymology==
Originally, Stung Treng was named &quot;Tonle Ropov (Khmer: ទន្លេរពៅ), which is now an area in Stung Treng called &quot;Tonle Ropov Area&quot; (Khmer: តំបន់ទន្លេរពៅ).

The name “Satung Teng (Khmer: សាទឹងទែង)&quot; was founded by a monk named &quot;Seang Peng (Khmer: សៀង ប៉េង) from Vientiane. The words “Satung Teng&quot; have changed to &quot;Xiang Taeng (Khmer: សៀងទែង). In Lao, the word &quot;Xiang&quot; means &quot;goddess&quot; who has resigned, while the word “Taeng” means &quot;built&quot;.

Due to advancement in the Khmer language, it was later called &quot;Stung Treng (Khmer: ស្ទឹងត្រែង)&quot; which means a river of reeds.

==History==
Stung Treng was first a part of the Khmer Empire, then the Lao kingdom of Lan Xang, and later the Lao kingdom of Champasak. After the Franco-Siamese crisis of 1893, Chiang Taeng (Stung Treng) was administered by French Lower Laos from 1893 to 1904. In 1904 French Laos traded the province to the French Protectorate of Cambodia in exchange for Champassak, leaving a small Laotian minority in Cambodia.

Owing to its border location and the forested mountains in the northeast of the province, it was a hotbed of communist insurgent activity—and a target for U.S. bombs in the 1960s and 70s. The insurgency lasted from the Vietnamese infiltration in the 1950s until the late Khmer Rouge years.

==Geography==
Stung Treng province, which covers an area of 11,092 square kilometers borders Laos to the north, Ratanakiri to the east, Preah Vihear to the west and Kratié and Kampong Thom to the south.

Extensive forests, intersecting rivers and streams characterize it. Stung Treng includes also the western chunk of the massive Virachey National Park, accessible from Siem Pang. The province also features three big rivers—the Sekong River, the Sesan River and the Mekong—with its hundreds of small islands scattered on the river stretch in Stung Treng.

Until February 2022, it was one of the few provinces where you could see the rare and endangered Irrawaddy dolphin in the wild near the Laos border, Borei O’Svay Sen Chey District and Anlong Cheuteal in Stung Treng. The population has likely vanished due to illegal fishing in the area.

==Weather==
In Stung Treng, the wet season is oppressive and overcast, the dry season is muggy and partly cloudy, and it is hot year-round. Over the course of the year, the temperature typically varies from 20 °C (67 °F) to 38 °C (100 °F) and is rarely below 16 °C (61 °F) or above 40 °C (105 °F).

===Climate===
On average, much rain (rainy season) falls in May, June, July, August, and September—the wettest season, with precipitation of 304.3 mm—and October. Stung Treng has dry periods in January, February and December—with January being the driest month. The warmest month is April with an average temperature of 35 °C (95 °F). The coldest month is January with an average temperature of 18 °C (64 °F).


==Economy==
Stung Treng&#x27;s economy is solely based on agriculture. Various plantations such as timber, rubber and cash nuts are built all over the province. 85% of the population lives in rural parts of the province and depend on agriculture for their source of income. Animal breeding, fishing and silk weaving are also important industries in the province.

The Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation found a mineralized belt of copper and zinc in the province in 2019, and plans to step up further exploration with a Japanese partner to extract the minerals. The exploration site is about 260 kilometres north of Phnom Penh.

==Administration==
The province is divided into 5 districts, 1 municipality, 34 communes, and 128 villages.

2 districts Siem Bouk and Thala Barivat in west Mekong River

<text>Photisarath (also spelled Phothisarath, Phothisarat, or Potisarat, , 1501–1547), son of King Visoun of Lanxang, is considered to be the most devout of the Lao kings. He banned spirit worship and built temples upon the sites of spirit shrines. His elephant fell and crushed him while he sought to display his prowess to the diplomatic corps. His son Setthathirath returned from Chiang Mai to succeed him to the throne of Lan Xang.

Phothisarath was ruler (1520–47) of the Lao kingdom of Lan Xang whose territorial expansion embroiled Laos in the warfare that swept mainland Southeast Asia in the latter half of the 16th century. King Chairachathirat of the Ayutthaya Kingdom invaded Vientiane with a large army in 1540, captured Muang Khouk and crossed the Mekong, but succumbed to a rout at the battle of Sala Kham, the remnants fleeing for their lives and leaving enormous casualties behind. Phothisarath himself allied himself with Burma, sent out 3 campaigns against the Ayutthaya Kingdom: the first to Phitsanulok in 1535, the second one to Vieng Prangarm in 1539, and third was sent in 1548 to Vieng Prab (now Sawangaburi) where he brought back 20,000 families to settle in the Lan Xang kingdom.

In 1548, following the ascension of King Maha Chakkraphat and queen Suriyothai to the Ayutthaya Kingdom throne, Burmese king Tabinshwehti planned an attack, starting the Burmese–Siamese War. Tabinshwehti asked Phothisarath to attack Ayutthaya from the North which eventually resulted in the famous death of Suriyothai in defense of her husband.

Phothisarath was a pious Buddhist who worked to undermine animism and Brahmanic religious practices and promote Buddhism. In 1527, Phothisarath issued a decree proscribing the worship of animism as groundless superstition, and ordering their shrines to be destroyed and their altars thrown into the river. He resided much of the time not in the capital at Luang Prabang but in Vientiane, which was located farther south and maintained better communications with the major states of the region. Phothisarath married a princess from Chiang Mai (now part of northern Thailand), and when his father-in-law Mueangketklao, the ruler of Lan Na or Chiang Mai, died in 1546 without a male issue, Phothisarath&#x27;s own son, Setthathirath, was placed on the Chiang Mai throne. When Phothisarath died the following year, after a fatal accident while hunting wild elephants, Setthathirath succeeded him and joined together the two kingdoms—which were soon embroiled in Burmese–Siamese wars that would devastate much of the region over the next half-century.

<doc id="203872" wikidata="Q36033" url="?curid=203872" title="Mitsubishi Motors">
<text>is a Japanese multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in Minato, Tokyo, Japan. In 2011, Mitsubishi Motors was the sixth-largest Japanese automaker and the 19th-largest worldwide by production. Since October 2016, Mitsubishi has been one-third (34%) owned by Nissan, and included in the Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance.

Besides being part of the Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance, it is also a part of Mitsubishi &quot;keiretsu&quot;, formerly the biggest industrial group in Japan. The company was originally formed in 1970 from the automotive division of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.

Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation, which builds commercial-grade trucks, buses, and heavy construction equipment, was formerly a part of Mitsubishi Motors, but is now owned by German automotive corporation Daimler Truck, with Mitsubishi continuing to own a small stake.

== History ==

Mitsubishi&#x27;s automotive origins date back to 1917, when the Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Co., Ltd., introduced the Mitsubishi Model A, Japan&#x27;s first series-production automobile. An entirely hand-built seven-seater sedan based on the FIAT Tipo 3, it proved expensive compared to its American and European mass-produced rivals, and was discontinued in 1921 after only 22 had been built.

In 1934, Mitsubishi Shipbuilding was merged with the Mitsubishi Aircraft Co., a company established in 1920 to manufacture aircraft engines and other parts. The unified company was known as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), and was the largest private company in Japan. MHI concentrated on manufacturing aircraft, ships, railroad cars and machinery, but in 1937 developed the PX33, a prototype sedan for military use. It was the first Japanese-built passenger car with full-time four-wheel drive, a technology the company would return to almost 50 years later in its quest for motorsport and sales success.
=== Post-World War history ===

Immediately following the end of the Second World War, the company returned to manufacturing vehicles. Fuso bus production resumed, while a small three-wheeled cargo vehicle called the Mizushima and a scooter called the Silver Pigeon were also developed. However, the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; (Japan&#x27;s family-controlled industrial conglomerates) were ordered to be dismantled by the Allied powers in 1950, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was split into three regional companies, each with an involvement in motor-vehicle development: West Japan Heavy-Industries, Central Japan Heavy-Industries, and East Japan Heavy-Industries.

East Japan Heavy-Industries began importing the Henry J, an inexpensive American sedan built by Kaiser Motors, in knockdown kit (CKD) form in 1951, and continued to bring them to Japan for the remainder of the car&#x27;s three-year production run. The same year, Central Japan Heavy-Industries concluded a similar contract with Willys (now owned by Kaiser) for CKD-assembled Jeep CJ-3Bs. This deal proved more durable, with licensed Mitsubishi Jeeps in production until 1998, 30 years after Willys had replaced the model.

By the beginning of the 1960s, Japan&#x27;s economy was gearing up; wages were rising and the idea of family motoring was taking off. Central Japan Heavy-Industries, now known as Shin Mitsubishi Heavy-Industries, had already re-established an automotive department in its headquarters in 1953. Now, it was ready to introduce the Mitsubishi 500, a mass-market sedan, to meet the new demand from consumers. It followed this in 1962 with the Minica kei car and the Colt 1000, the first of its Colt line of family cars, in 1963. In 1964, Mitsubishi introduced its largest passenger sedan, the Mitsubishi Debonair as a luxury car primarily for the Japanese market, and was used by senior Mitsubishi executives as a company car.

West Japan Heavy-Industries (now renamed Mitsubishi Shipbuilding and Engineering) and East Japan Heavy-Industries (now Mitsubishi Nihon Heavy-Industries) had also expanded their automotive departments in the 1950s, and the three were reintegrated as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in 1964. Within three years, its output was over 75,000 vehicles annually. Following the successful introduction of the first Galant in 1969 and similar growth with its commercial-vehicle division, the company decided to create a single operation to focus on the automotive industry. Mitsubishi Motors Corporation (MMC) was formed on 22 April 1970, as a wholly owned subsidiary of MHI under the leadership of Tomio Kubo, a successful engineer from the aircraft division.

The logo of three red diamonds, shared with over 40 other companies within the &quot;keiretsu&quot;, antedates Mitsubishi Motors itself by almost a century. It was chosen by Iwasaki Yatarō, the founder of Mitsubishi, as it was suggestive of the emblem of the Tosa clan who first employed him, and because his own family crest was three rhombi stacked atop each other. The name consists of two parts – &quot;mitsu&quot; meaning &quot;three&quot; and &quot;hishi&quot; (which becomes &quot;bishi&quot; under &quot;rendaku&quot;) meaning &quot;water caltrop&quot; (also called &quot;water chestnut&quot;), and hence &quot;rhombus&quot;, which is reflected in the company&#x27;s logo.

=== 1970s: Chrysler partnership ===

Part of Tomio Kubo&#x27;s expansion strategy was to increase exports by forging alliances with well-established foreign companies. Therefore, in 1971, MHI sold U.S. automotive giant Chrysler a 15% share in the new company. Thanks to this deal, Chrysler began selling the Galant in the United States as the Dodge Colt (which was the first rebadged Mitsubishi product sold by Chrysler), pushing MMC&#x27;s annual production beyond 250,000 vehicles. In 1977, the Galant was sold as the Chrysler Sigma in Australia.
By 1977, a network of &quot;Colt&quot;-branded distribution and sales dealerships had been established across Europe, as Mitsubishi sought to begin selling vehicles directly. Annual production had by now grown from 500,000 vehicles in 1973 to 965,000 in 1978, when Chrysler began selling the Galant as the Dodge Challenger and the Plymouth Sapporo. However, this expansion was beginning to cause friction; Chrysler saw their overseas markets for subcompacts as being directly encroached by their Japanese partners, while MMC felt the Americans were demanding too much say in their corporate decisions.

=== 1980s: U.S. entry ===
Mitsubishi Motors finally achieved annual production of a million cars in 1980, but by this time, its ally was not so healthy; as part of its battle to avoid bankruptcy, Chrysler was forced to sell its Australian manufacturing division to MMC that year. The new Japanese owners renamed it Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd (MMAL).

In 1982, the Mitsubishi brand was introduced to the American market for the first time. The Tredia sedan, and the Cordia and Starion coupés were initially sold through 70 dealers in 22 states, with an allocation of 30,000 vehicles among them. This quota, restricted by mutual agreement between the two countries&#x27; governments, had to be included among the 120,000 cars earmarked for Chrysler. A restricting element of Mitsubishi&#x27;s deal with Chrysler was that Chrysler had the right of first refusal of any Mitsubishi automobiles in the US market until 1990. Toward the end of the 1980s, as MMC initiated a major push to increase its U.S. presence, it aired its first national television advertising campaign and made plans to increase its network to 340 dealers.
Despite the ongoing tensions between Chrysler and Mitsubishi, they agreed to unite in a vehicle manufacturing operation in Normal, Illinois. The 50/50 venture provided a way to circumvent the voluntary import restrictions, while providing a new line of compact and subcompact cars for Chrysler. Diamond-Star Motors (DSM)—from the parent companies&#x27; logos: three diamonds (Mitsubishi) and a pentastar (Chrysler)—was incorporated in October 1985, and in April 1986, ground was broken on a 1.9-million-square-foot (177,000 m2) production facility in Normal. In 1987, the company was selling 67,000 cars a year in the U.S., but when the plant was completed in March 1988, it offered an annual capacity of 240,000 vehicles. Initially, three platform-sharing compact 2+2 coupés were released, the Mitsubishi Eclipse, Eagle Talon, and Plymouth Laser, with other models being introduced in subsequent years.

 Before receiving government approval for this project, Mitsubishi had to express contrition over &quot;defective&quot; Mitsubishi trucks imported to China in 1984 and 1985. By 1989, Mitsubishi&#x27;s worldwide production, including its overseas affiliates, had reached 1.5 million units.

Mitsubishi Motors went public in 1988, ending its status as the only one of Japan&#x27;s 11 auto manufacturers to be privately held. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries agreed to reduce its share to 25%, retaining its position as largest single stockholder. Chrysler, meanwhile, increased its holding to over 20%. The capital raised by this initial offering enabled Mitsubishi to pay off part of its debts, as well as to expand its investments throughout Southeast Asia, where it was by now operating in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand.

=== 1990s: SUV focus ===
Hirokazu Nakamura became president of Mitsubishi Motors in 1989, and steered the company in some promising directions, with the advent of the Japanese asset price bubble &quot;market correction&quot; that led to the Lost Decade as a result of the Plaza Accord agreement signed in 1985. Sales of the company&#x27;s new Pajero were bucking conventional wisdom by becoming popular even in the crowded streets of Japan.

Japanese media rumored in 1992 and 1993 that Mitsubishi Motors intended a hostile acquisition of Honda. While Mitsubishi was riding high off of profitable vehicles such as the Diamante and Pajero, Honda was caught off-guard with the SUV and truck boom, and was losing focus after the illness and later death of its founder. Honda CEO Nobuhiko Kawamoto took drastic steps, though, such as exiting Formula 1 and discontinuing unprofitable vehicles to avert a Mitsubishi takeover, which proved effective.

Although sales of SUVs and light trucks were booming in the U.S., Japan&#x27;s car manufacturers dismissed the idea that such a trend could occur in their own country. Nakamura, however, increased the budget for SUV product development, and his gamble paid off; Mitsubishi&#x27;s wide line of four-wheel drive vehicles, from the Mitsubishi Pajero Mini kei car to the Delica Space Gear passenger van, rode the wave of SUV-buying in Japan in the early to mid-1990s, and Mitsubishi saw its overall domestic share rise to 11.6% in 1995.

In 1991, Chrysler sold its equity stake in Diamond-Star Motors to its partner Mitsubishi Motors, and from then on the two companies continued to share components and manufacturing on a contractual basis only. Chrysler decreased its interest in Mitsubishi Motors to less than 3% in 1992, and announced its decision to divest itself of all its remaining shares on the open market in 1993. The two companies then terminated their close alliance, with Mitsubishi Motors no longer supplying parts for engines and transmissions for Chrysler. After this period, the company sought alliances with many other automotive manufacturers in different areas of the world, as described under &quot;other alliances&quot; below, with its most economically significant alliance being with Nissan to develop and manufacture kei cars.

=== 2000s ===
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) participated in a ¥540-billion emergency rescue of Mitsubishi Motors in January 2005, in partnership with Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group. As part of the rescue, MHI acquired ¥50 billion of Mitsubishi Motors stock, increasing its ownership stake to 15% and making the automaker an affiliate again. The emergency rescue was carried out 4 years after a product recall scandal in Japan that was triggered by accusations of Mitsubishi Motors trying to systematically hide manufacturing defects to avoid recalls, and marketing problems in the US.
After a starvation of new investment caused by lack of cashflow, the company introduced the award-winning Mitsubishi i kei car in 2006, its first new model in 29 months, while a revised Outlander has been introduced worldwide to compete in the popular XUV market niche. The next generation of its Lancer and Lancer Evolution was launched in 2007 and 2008.

Slow-selling vehicles were eliminated from the U.S. market, purchase projections for the Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance have been scaled back, and 10,000 jobs were shed to cut costs with 3,400 workers at its Australian plant and other loss-making operations still under threat. Meanwhile, in an effort to increase production at its U.S. facility, new export markets for the Eclipse and Galant were being explored in Ukraine, the Middle East, and Russia, where the company&#x27;s bestselling dealership is located. Mitsubishi Motors has also been active in OEM production of cars for Nissan, and announced a similar partnership with Groupe PSA in July 2005 to manufacture an SUV on their behalf.

Mitsubishi Motors reported its first profitable quarter in four years in the third quarter of 2006, and returned to profitability by the end of the 2006 financial year, and sustained profitability and global sales of 1,524,000 through 2007 and later.

In January 2011, the company announced its next midterm business plan to introduce eight hybrid and battery-powered models by 2015. It aimed to sell its first two plug-in hybrids by fiscal 2012.

In March 2015, Mitsubishi Motors started the construction of a new manufacturing plant in Indonesia under a joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation (40%) and a local company Krama Yudha Group (9%), with the maximum production capacity of 160,000 vehicles per year.

In July 2015, the Mitsubishi Motors announced that it plans to end production at the Diamond-Star Motors plant in Normal, Illinois, US, as the plant has been operating well below capacity for several years. Operations at the facility ended in May 2016. The plant was sold to Maynards Industries, which sold the site to American electric vehicle startup Rivian in 2017.

=== 2016–present: Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance membership ===
In May 2016, in the wake of the fuel-efficiency scandal uncovered by Nissan (discussed in &quot;Fuel economy scandal&quot;), Nissan began the acquisition of a 34% stake in Mitsubishi Motors, with the aim of making Nissan the largest and controlling shareholder of Mitsubishi and turning Mitsubishi Motors into a member of the Renault–Nissan Alliance (the &quot;Alliance&quot;). Nissan has said that they plan to share some car platforms and jointly develop future vehicles with Mitsubishi Motors. Nissan&#x27;s acquisition of the 34% controlling interest in Mitsubishi Motors was completed in October 2016, when Carlos Ghosn, the chairman of Nissan, Renault, and the Alliance, also became chairman of Mitsubishi Motors. Ghosn remained chairman of Mitsubishi until his dismissal following his arrest by the Japanese government in November 2018, when Mitsubishi Motors CEO Osamu Masuko assumed the chairmanship.

By 2023, Renault Group began supplying Mitsubishi in Continental Europe, with the Renault Clio and Renault Captur rebadge as the Colt and ASX. The firm has no plans to sell any of the models in Britain or Ireland, as the Colt Car Company&#x27;s Mitsubishi aftersales business was bought as a going concern by International Motors (a firm previously known for launching Hyundai onto the UK market in 1981).

Mitsubishi Motors plans to stop developing car platforms for the Japanese market and instead use vehicle bases made by ally Nissan Motor beginning around 2026.

== Other alliances ==

=== 1974–1984: Colt and Lonsdale ===
The Colt name appears frequently in Mitsubishi&#x27;s history since its introduction as a rear-engined 600-cc sedan in the early 1960s. Today, it most commonly refers to the Mitsubishi Colt subcompact in the company&#x27;s line-up, but is also the name of MMC&#x27;s import/distribution company in the United Kingdom, the Colt Car Company, established in 1974. For the first decade of its existence, before Far Eastern auto manufacturers had established their reputations, its cars carried the &quot;Colt&quot; badge in Britain instead of &quot;Mitsubishi&quot;.

In 1982 and 1983, Mitsubishi introduced the Australian-built Mitsubishi Sigma to the UK as the Lonsdale YD41 in an attempt to circumvent British import quotas, but the new brand was unsuccessful. It then carried Mitsubishi Sigma badges in 1983–84 before abandoning this operation entirely.

=== 1975–2003: Hyundai ===
South Korean manufacturer Hyundai, built the Hyundai Pony in 1975 using MMC&#x27;s Saturn engine and transmissions. Korea&#x27;s first car, it remained in production for 13 years. Mitsubishi held up to a 10% stake in the company, until disposing of the last of its remaining shares in March 2003.

The 1985 Hyundai Excel was sold in the United States as the Mitsubishi Precis between 1987 and 1994, whereas several other Mitsubishi models were rebadged as Hyundai, namely the Mitsubishi Chariot (as the Hyundai Santamo), the Mitsubishi Pajero (as the Hyundai Galloper) or the Mitsubishi Delica (as the Hyundai Porter) and Mitsubishi Proudia (as the Hyundai Equus).

=== 1985–1991: Samcor ===
The South African Motor Corporation (Samcor) (previously also called Sigma Corporation and MMI) was a joint venture created in 1985, which produced Ford, Mazda, and Mitsubishi vehicles for the local South African market, with the Mitsubishi Delica being rebadged as the Ford Husky minibus and the Mitsubishi Canter as the Ford Triton light truck. Samcor also made a version of the Mazda 323 for the UK market called the Sao Penza, which was a marque like Lonsdale YD41, invented to get around British import quotas.

=== 1985–2010: Proton ===
Malaysian manufacturer Proton was initially very dependent on Mitsubishi Motors, assembling their 1985 Proton Saga using mostly MMC components at a newly established facility in Shah Alam. Subsequent models like the Wira and Perdana were based on the Lancer/Colt and Galant/Eterna, respectively, before the company finally produced entirely self-developed vehicles, the Waja in 2000, and the Proton Gen-2 in 2004. At its peak, the Proton controlled 75% of its domestic market, even after Mitsubishi ended their 22-year partnership in 2005, selling their 7.9% stake for RM384 million to Khazanah Nasional Berhad. However, in October 2008, Proton renewed its technology-transfer agreements with MMC, and the Proton Inspira (the Proton Waja replacement) was again based on the Mitsubishi Lancer platform and officially launched on 10 November 2010.

=== 1991–2012: Volvo Cars ===
Mitsubishi participated in a joint venture with rival carmaker Volvo and the Dutch government at the former DAF plant in Born in 1991. The operation, branded NedCar, began producing the first-generation Mitsubishi Carisma alongside the Volvo S40/V40 in 1996. The factory later produced the latest Mitsubishi Colt and the related Smart Forfour (partner DaimlerChrysler cancelled its production in 2006). Production of European market-bound Mitsubishi Outlanders, and badge-engineered versions of this vehicle, were also manufactured in the Netherlands until 2012, when the company sold the plant to the Dutch industrial conglomerate VDL Groep. Mitsubishi Motors Europe&#x27;s headquarters and their European distribution center are still based in Born.

=== 1991–2019: Suzuki ===
In Indonesia, Mitsubishi offered the Colt T120SS light truck between 1991 and 2019 based on the Suzuki Carry. Despite the same bodywork, the fascia is unique to Mitsubishi and it is manufactured in the local Mitsubishi plant. The engine used is either Mitsubishi&#x27;s carbureted 4G17 or the bigger fuel-injected 4G15. In 2005, the alliance continued by rebadging the Suzuki APV to Mitsubishi Maven. Few styling changes were applied, and the 4G15 engine was used instead of Suzuki&#x27;s G15A engine. The Maven was discontinued in 2009 due to poor sales. The Colt T120SS was discontinued in 2019 as the base vehicle, the Suzuki Carry was updated, and Mitsubishi was not interested in continuing the alliance.

In Japan, Mitsubishi had rebadged the Suzuki Solio as the Delica D:2 and the Suzuki Every as the Minicab.

=== 1998–2016: Hindustan ===
Indian manufacturer Hindustan had a joint venture with Mitsubishi that started 1998. 
Models produced at the Tiruvallur, Tamil Nadu plant included the Mitsubishi Pajero Sport (third generation) until 2016.

=== 1999–2001: Volvo Trucks ===
Upon selling its Volvo Cars division to Ford in January 1999, Volvo Group purchased a 5% stake in Mitsubishi Motors in November of that same year, but sold its stake to shareholder DaimlerChrysler in March 2001.

=== 1999–2011: Groupe PSA ===
Mitsubishi has been allied with PSA Group since 1999, after they agreed to co-operate on the development of diesel engines using the Japanese company&#x27;s gasoline direct injection technology. They united again in 2005 to develop the Peugeot 4007 and Citroën C-Crosser sport utility vehicles (SUVs), based on the Japanese company&#x27;s Mitsubishi Outlander.

Two further ties were established between the companies in 2008, first with the establishment of a jointly owned production facility in Kaluga, which would manufacture up to 160,000 Outlander-based SUVs for the fast-growing Russian market. They were also collaborating in the research and development of electric powertrains for small urban vehicles. Japanese newspaper &quot;Nikkei&quot; claimed that PSA will sell the electric city car Mitsubishi i MIEV in Europe by 2011.

=== 2004–2010: Volkswagen ===
In Europe, Mitsubishi Motors used diesel engines supplied by German manufacturer Volkswagen for some of its mid-sized cars, such as the Lancer, Grandis, and Outlander. From 2010, they were superseded with Mitsubishi&#x27;s self-developed 4N1 diesel engines.

=== 2006–2024: Chinese joint ventures ===
As of 2006, Mitsubishi had four joint ventures with Chinese partners:
* South East (Fujian) Motor Co Ltd
* Shenyang Aerospace Mitsubishi Motors Engine Manufacturing Co Ltd
* Harbin Dongan Automotive Engine Manufacturing Co Ltd – a subsidiary of Harbin Hafei Automobile Industry Group Co Ltd
* Hunan Changfeng Motor Co Ltd – a subsidiary of Chang Feng (Group) Co Ltd

=== 2010–present: Nissan, Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi ===
In December 2010, Mitsubishi and Nissan agreed to form a joint venture (later named &quot;NMKV Co., Ltd.&quot;) to develop kei cars for the Japanese market. In 2016, Nissan uncovered evidence that Mitsubishi&#x27;s fuel-economy testing numbers were erroneous and had been erroneous since the start of the venture, affecting 625,000 cars produced by NMKV. The result of the &quot;fuel economy scandal&quot; was that Nissan acquired a controlling interest in Mitsubishi.

=== 2024–present: Nissan and Honda alliance ===
In July 2024, Mitsubishi Motors and Nissan announced a partnership with Honda for the joint development of their future electric models. On 23 December 2024, Honda officially announced an MOU had been entered to merge with Japanese car company Nissan to become the 3rd largest auto company by sales. Mitsubishi Motors, in which Nissan has 24% ownership, also agreed to join the talks of integration. In mid February 2025, Nissan, Honda, and Mitsubishi ended talks due to the talks shifting to Nissan becoming a subsidiary of Honda, which Nissan refused as it wouldn&#x27;t have allowed the potential of Nissan to be realized. Despite this, Nissan, Honda, and Mitsubishi will continue forward with the partnership formed in July 2024.

== Japan sales channels ==

Mitsubishi Motors maintained two retail sales channels that sold specific models, called &quot;Car Plaza&quot; and &quot;Galant Shop&quot;. Certain models were exclusive to either channel, while some models were available at both channels, as required by local Japanese market conditions. More recently, due to cancellation of larger sedans, the sales channels have been combined into one franchise that sells all models, including kei cars and commercial delivery vehicles.

== Historical troubles ==
=== Asian economic downturn ===
The benefits Mitsubishi Motors had seen because of its strong presence in Southeast Asia reversed themselves as a result of the economic crisis in the region, which began in 1991 with the advent of the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble, referred to in Japan as the beginning of the Lost Decade and continued to 1997. The collapse was partly the result of the Plaza Accord agreement in 1985, which sought to equalize the United States dollar with the Japanese yen and the German mark. In September of that year, the company closed its Thai factory in response to a crash in the country&#x27;s currency and plummeting consumer demand. The large truck plant, which had produced 8,700 trucks in 1996, was shut down indefinitely. In addition, Mitsubishi Motors had little support from sales in Japan, which slowed considerably throughout 1997, and were affected by that country&#x27;s own economic uncertainty into 1998. 

Other Japanese automakers, such as Toyota and Honda, bolstered their own slipping domestic sales with success in the U.S. However, with a comparatively small percentage of the American market, the turmoil in the Asian economy had a greater effect on Mitsubishi Motors, and the company&#x27;s 1997 losses were the worst in its history. In addition, it lost both its rank as the third-largest automaker in Japan to Mazda, and market share overseas. Its stock price fell precipitously, prompting the company to cancel its year-end dividend payment.

In November 1997, Mitsubishi Motors hired Katsuhiko Kawasoe to replace Takemune Kimura as company president. Kawasoe unveiled an aggressive restructuring program that aimed to cut costs by ¥350 billion in three years, reduce personnel by 1,400, and return the company to profitability by 1998. While the program had some initial success, the company&#x27;s sales were still stagnant as the Asian economy continued to sputter. In 1999, Mitsubishi Motors was forced once again to skip dividend payments. Its interest-bearing debt totalled ¥1.7 trillion.

=== Vehicle defect cover-up ===
In what was referred to as &quot;one of the largest corporate scandals in Japanese history&quot;, Mitsubishi Motors was twice forced to admit to systematically covering up defect problems in its vehicles. Four defects were first publicised in 2000, but in 2004, it confessed to 26 more going back as far as 1977, including failing brakes, fuel leaks, and malfunctioning clutches. The effect on the company was catastrophic, forcing it to recall 163,707 cars (156,433 in Japan and 7,274 overseas) for free repair. 

Further recalls by Fuso Truck and Bus brought the total number of vehicles requiring repair to almost one million. The affair led to the resignation and subsequent arrest of president Kawasoe, along with 23 other employees who were also implicated. Three of them have since been acquitted, with the judge stating that no official request from the Transport Ministry ordered them to submit a defect report.

=== 0–0–0 ===
In an effort to boost sales in the U.S. in the early 2000s, Mitsubishi Motors began offering a &quot;0–0–0&quot; finance offer—0% down, 0% interest, and $0 monthly payments (all repayments deferred for 12 months). Initially, sales leapt, but at the end of the year&#x27;s &quot;grace period&quot;, numerous credit-risky buyers defaulted, leaving the company with used vehicles for which they had received no money and which were now worth less than they cost to manufacture. The company&#x27;s American credit operation, MMCA, was eventually forced to make a US$454 million provision against its 2003 accounts as a result of these losses. As a result, sales plummeted to 243,000 in 2003, 139,000 in 2004, 124,000 in 2005, and 119,000 in 2006.

=== End of Australian production ===
In October 2005, Mitsubishi Motors Australia introduced the Mitsubishi 380 to the Australian market as the replacement for its long-running Mitsubishi Magna, and the sole vehicle being built at its Australian assembly plant at Clovelly Park. Despite an investment of A$600 million developing the car, initial sales projections proved optimistic; after only six months, Mitsubishi scaled back production from 90/day, and reduced the working week from five days to four. The Australian auto industry remained concerned as to whether this would be sufficient to restore the plant to profitability and ensure its long-term survival.

The drop in local sales could not be mitigated by exports outside of the Australian and New Zealand markets. On 5 February 2008, Mitsubishi Motors Australia announced it would be closing down its Adelaide assembly plant by the end of March. Between 700 and 1,000 direct jobs would be lost and up to 2,000 jobs would be lost in industries supporting Mitsubishi&#x27;s local manufacturing operations.

=== End of Western European production ===
With operating losses ¥22 billion ($287 million) in Europe for the fiscal year to March due to stagnant sales in a continent beset by uncertainty of a raging debt crisis, in February 2012, Mitsubishi Motors decided to end production in Western Europe by the end of 2012. On 1 October, it announced that the Dutch industrial conglomerate VDL Groep had taken over NedCar from Mitsubishi Motors, retaining all 1,500 employees.

=== End of North American production ===
In 1988, Mitsubishi Motors opened a production facility in the United States in Normal, Illinois. The facility was known as Diamond-Star Motors, and was initially a joint venture with Chrysler, but Chrysler sold its stake in the plant to Mitsubishi in 1993. After 1995, the facility was known as Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing America (MMMA). At its peak in 2000, the facility produced over 222,000 vehicles per year, but following the decline of Mitsubishi Motors in North America, the plant operated well below capacity for years.

In July 2015, Mitsubishi Motors announced that it would close the plant by November, but would continue to sell automobiles in North America. In 2014, the plant had produced just 69,000 vehicles, roughly one-quarter of its capacity. Production at the plant ended on 30 November 2015, and most of the employees were laid off. The plant continued to operate with a minimal staff to produce replacement parts until May 2016, after which it closed permanently.

===Withdrawal from UK market===
Mitsubishi Motors announced that the company would leave the UK market due to financial reasons by autumn 2021. Afterwards, Mitsubishi&#x27;s British presence will be limited to aftersales.

=== Withdrawal from Chinese market ===
Mitsubishi Motors announced its withdrawal from its joint venture GAC Mitsubishi in the Chinese market in October 2023. As part of this exit, GAC Group will take over GAC Mitsubishi&#x27;s plant in Changsha to produce GAC Aion electric vehicles.

=== Fuel economy scandal ===
In early 2016, Mitsubishi Motors partner Nissan found discrepancies between Mitsubishi information and actual fuel consumption while working in new micro (kei) cars for both companies, the eK Wagon, eK Space, Nissan Dayz, and Nissan Dayz Roox. At the time, Mitsubishi Motors manufactured micro cars for Nissan, which had never produced that class of vehicle itself. Mitsubishi Motors admitted that they had been giving incorrect information on fuel consumption from 2002 onwards, using inaccurate test methods. Later, the company said it used fuel-economy testing methods that did not comply with Japanese regulations for 25 years, much longer than previously known. 

Mitsubishi Motors management said they were unaware about the issue and that the incorrect information came from the micro car development department, NMKV. They ordered an investigation led by investigators not affiliated with the company. The resultant scandal culminated in Nissan acquiring a controlling interest in MMC in May 2016. As a consequence, Nissan agreed to invest 237.4 billion yen (US$2.2 billion) in exchange for receiving a 34% controlling ownership stake in Mitsubishi Motors.

Due to dilution of existing shares, other Mitsubishi group companies (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Corp., and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ) had their combined holdings in Mitsubishi Motors fall to about 20% from 34% previously.

MMNA stated that vehicles sold from 2013 in the United States featured accurate fuel-economy information and were thereby not affected by the scandal.

In May 2016, Mitsubishi Motors announced Tetsuro Aikawa was to resign as the president of the company in effect in June 2016. Both Mitsubishi Motors and Aikawa denied any top management involvement in the mileage scandal. The company said much of the mileage-testing work was assigned to a subsidiary and a lack of scrutiny existed of such work.

== Management ==
In 2014, Tetsuro Aikawa was appointed as the president of the company, becoming the first in more than a decade to have spent an entire career at the company. The career of Aikawa had been mainly in product development, although he was involved in manufacturing and Japan domestic sales lately. Osamu Masuko, the previous president, joined the company from Mitsubishi Corp. in 2004. MMC endured eight presidents between 1989 and 2004.

== Electric vehicles ==

Mitsubishi Motors started selling its i MiEV, the all-electric minicar with a lithium-ion battery pack tucked under its floor, to retail customers in the summer 2009, a year ahead of schedule. The automaker had initially planned to start leasing the minicar-based vehicle to businesses and municipalities in the summer 2009 and to wait until 2010 for the retail launch. It has also announced its plans to offer five other e-drive vehicles.

== Motorsport ==
Mitsubishi Motors has almost half a century of international motorsport experience, antedating even the incorporation of MMC. Beginning with street races in the early 1960s, the company found itself gravitating towards the challenge of off-road racing. It dominated endurance rallies in the 1970s, the Dakar Rally from the &#x27;80s, and the Group A and Group N classes of the World Rally Championship through the 1990s. Ralliart (later Mitsubishi Motors Motor Sports), was Mitsubishi&#x27;s racing subsidiary, although the company ceased competing formally in 2010.

=== Circuit racing ===
Mitsubishi Motors&#x27;s motorsport debut was in touring car racing in 1962, when it entered its Mitsubishi 500 Super DeLuxe in the Macau Grand Prix in an effort to promote sales of its first postwar passenger car. In an auspicious debut, the diminutive rear-engined sedan swept the top four places in the &quot;Under 750 cc&quot; category, with Kazuo Togawa taking class honours. The company returned the following year with their new Mitsubishi Colt 600 and again swept the podium with a 1–2–3 in the &quot;Under 600 cc&quot; class. In its final year of competition with touring cars in 1966, Mitsubishi scored a podium clean sweep in the &quot;750–1000 cc&quot; class of the 1964 Japanese Grand Prix with the Colt 1000, their first front-engined competition vehicle.

The company began concentrating on the Japanese GP&#x27;s emerging open-wheel &quot;formula car&quot; categories from 1966, winning the &quot;Exhibition&quot; class. They also scored class 1–2 in 1967 and 1968, and reached the podium in 1969 and 1970. They finished on a high with an overall 1–2 in the 1971 Japan GP, with the two litre DOHC F2000 driven by Kuniomi Nagamatsu.

=== Off-road racing ===

The East African Safari Rally was by far the most gruelling event on the World Rally Championship calendar in the 1970s. MMC developed the Lancer 1600 GSR specifically for the marathon race, and won at the first attempt in 1974. Their highpoint was a clean sweep of the podium places in 1976 in an event where only 20% of the starters typically reached the finish. They also achieved a 1–2–3–4 in the 1973 Southern Cross Rally, the first of four consecutive victories in this event with drivers Andrew Cowan and Kenjiro Shinozuka.
During the 1980s, Mitsubishi continued to participate in the WRC, first with the Lancer EX2000 Turbo and the Starion. It then scored its first outright Group A victories with a Galant VR-4 in the late &#x27;80s, Mitsubishi homologated the Lancer Evolution, and in the hands of Finland&#x27;s Tommi Mäkinen, winner of the drivers&#x27; title for four consecutive years (1996–1999), they won the manufacturers&#x27; championship in 1998. They have won 34 WRC events since 1973. The Lancer Evo has also dominated the FIA championship for showroom-ready cars, winning seven consecutive Group N titles with four different drivers from 1995 to 2001. Even in 2002, when it ostensibly lost the title, the class-winning manufacturer was Proton using a Lancer Evo-based Pert.

Mitsubishi Motors is also the most successful manufacturer in the history of the Dakar Rally. MMC&#x27;s maiden entry was in 1983 with their new Pajero, and only three attempts were needed to find a winning formula. Since then, they have won in 1992, 1993, 1997, 1998, and between 2001 and 2007, an unprecedented seven consecutive victories and 12th overall with nine different drivers. They also won the 2003 FIA Cross-Country Rally World Cup, along with Carlos Sousa.

== Partnership with Jackie Chan ==
Mitsubishi Motors has had a 30-year-long association with actor Jackie Chan, who has used their vehicles almost exclusively in his movies throughout his career. The Jackie Chan Cup, first held in 1984, is an annual celebrity auto race involving international motor journalists and starlets from across Asia in Mitsubishis with professional touring car drivers alongside for assistance, and was held before the Macau GP until 2004, when it moved to Shanghai. In September 2005 Ralliart, Mitsubishi&#x27;s motorsport arm, produced 50 Jackie Chan Special Edition versions of the Lancer Evo IX; Chan acts as the honorary director of Team Ralliart China.

== Locations ==

The company has vehicle manufacturing facilities in Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia, and 12 plants co-owned in partnership with others. In Brazil, it has a production agreement with a local group with no direct investment from MMC. It also has three further engine and transmission manufacturing plants, five R&amp;D centres, and 75 subsidiaries, affiliates, and partners. Its vehicles are manufactured, assembled, or sold in more than 160 countries worldwide.

<text>To help compare different &quot;orders of magnitude&quot;, the following lists describe various &quot;mass&quot; levels between 10−67 kg and 1052 kg. The least massive thing listed here is a graviton, and the most massive thing is the observable universe. Typically, an object having greater mass will also have greater weight (see mass versus weight), especially if the objects are subject to the same gravitational field strength.

==Units of mass==


The table at right is based on the kilogram (kg), the base unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI). The kilogram is the only standard unit to include an SI prefix (&quot;kilo-&quot;) as part of its name. The &quot;gram&quot; (10−3 kg) is an SI derived unit of mass. However, the &quot;names&quot; of all SI mass units are based on &quot;gram&quot;, rather than on &quot;kilogram&quot;; thus 103 kg is a &quot;megagram&quot; (106 g), not a *&quot;kilokilogram&quot;.

The &quot;tonne&quot; (t) is an SI-compatible unit of mass equal to a megagram (&quot;Mg&quot;), or 103 kg. The unit is in common use for masses above about 103 kg and is often used with SI prefixes. For example, a gigagram (&quot;Gg&quot;) or 109 g is 103 tonnes, commonly called a &quot;kilotonne&quot;.

===Other units===
Other units of mass are also in use. Historical units include the stone, the pound, the carat, and the grain.

For subatomic particles, physicists use the mass equivalent to the energy represented by an electronvolt (eV). At the atomic level, chemists use the mass of one-twelfth of a carbon-12 atom (the dalton). Astronomers use the mass of the sun ().
===The least massive things: below 10−24 kg ===

Unlike other physical quantities, mass–energy does not have an &quot;a priori&quot; expected minimal quantity, or an observed basic quantum as in the case of electric charge. Planck&#x27;s law allows for the existence of photons with arbitrarily low energies. Consequently, there can only ever be an experimental upper bound on the mass of a supposedly massless particle; in the case of the photon, this confirmed upper bound is of the order of = .

<text>The Emerald Buddha ( , or , ) is an image of the meditating Gautama Buddha seated in a meditative posture, made of a semi-precious green stone (jasper rather than emerald or jade), clothed in gold. and about tall. The image is considered the sacred palladium of Thailand. It is housed in the &quot;Temple of the Emerald Buddha&quot; (Wat Phra Kaew) on the grounds of the Grand Palace in Bangkok.

==Origin myths==

=== Sinhalese origin according to the &quot;Jinakalamali&quot; ===
The legend of the Emerald Buddha is related in number of sources such as &quot;Jinakalamali&quot;, &quot;Amarakatabuddharupanidana&quot;, and in particular &quot;Ratanabimbavamsa&quot; or &quot;The Chronicle of the Emerald Buddha&quot; written in Pali by Brahmarājaprajña in the 15th century (but the oldest extant manuscript dates only to 1788). The story is a mix of fact and fables with some variations to the story. According to the legend, the Emerald Buddha was created in 43 BCE by a sage named Nagasena in the city of Pataliputra (today&#x27;s Patna), India. Nagasena allegedly had the help of the deities, Vishnu and Indra, 500 years after Buddha attained Nibbana. He was said to have predicted:

This figure of the Buddha is assuredly going to give to religion the most brilliant importance in five lands, that is in Lankadvipa (Sri Lanka), Ramalakka, Dvaravati, Chieng Mai and Lan Chang (Laos).

=== Arrival in Cambodia according to Cambodian Royal Chronicles ===
According to Cambodian Royal Chronicles as compiled by Ros Chantrabot, the legends state that after remaining in Pataliputra for three hundred years, The Emerald Buddha was taken to Sri Lanka to save it from a civil war. The emerald Buddha then arrived in Cambodia, giving its name place known as Russey Keo. When the Thais attacked Angkor Wat in 1432 (following the ravage of the bubonic plague), the Emerald Buddha was taken to Ayutthaya, Kamphaeng Phet, Laos and finally Chiang Rai, where the ruler of the city hid it until it was found in 1434.

=== Burmese Chronicles ===
A version of the legend stated that in 457, King Anuruth(Anawrahta) of Burma sent a mission to Ceylon to ask for Buddhist scriptures and the Emerald Buddha, in order to support Buddhism in his country. These requests were granted, but the ship lost its way in a storm during the return voyage and somehow landed in Cambodia.

==History==
=== Discovery in Lan Na ===

Historical sources indicate that the statue surfaced in northern Thailand in the Lan Na kingdom in 1434. One account of its discovery tells that lightning struck a chedi in Wat Pa Yia (Bamboo Forest Monastery, later renamed Wat Phra Kaew) in Chiang Rai, revealing a Buddha covered with stucco inside. The Buddha was then placed in the abbot&#x27;s residence, who later noticed that stucco on the nose had flaked off, revealing a green interior. The abbot removed the stucco and found a Buddha figure carved from a green semi-precious stone, which became known as &quot;Phra Kaew Morakot&quot; or in English the Emerald Buddha. (&quot;Emerald&quot; refers to its &quot;green colour&quot; in Thai, not its composition.) Some art historians describe the Emerald Buddha as belonging to the Chiang Saen Style of the 15th century CE, which would mean that it is of Lan Na origin.

The legend reports that King Sam Fang Kaen of Lan Na wanted it in his capital of Chiang Mai, but the elephant carrying it insisted on three separate occasions on going instead to Lampang. This was taken as a divine sign, and the Emerald Buddha stayed in Lampang in a specially-built temple (now Wat Phra Kaeo Don Tao) for the next 32 years. In 1468, it was moved to Chiang Mai by King Tilokaraj, where it was kept in a niche in a large stupa called Chedi Luang.

=== Presence in Laos in the 16th century ===
The Emerald Buddha remained in Chiang Mai until 1552, when it was taken to Luang Prabang, then the capital of the Lao kingdom of Lan Xang. Some years earlier, the crown prince of Lan Xang, Setthathirath, had been invited to occupy the vacant throne of Lan Na as his mother was the daughter of the king of Chiang Mai who had died without an heir. However, Prince Setthathirath also became king of Lan Xang when his father, Photisarath, died. He returned home, taking the revered Buddha figure with him.

In 1564, King Setthathirath moved it to Vientiane, which he had made his new capital due to Burmese attacks and where the Buddha image was housed in Haw Phra Kaew. The Buddha image would stay in Vientiane for the next 214 years.

=== Settlement in Siam after the victory of General Chao Phraya Chakri in 1779 ===
In 1779, the Siamese General Chao Phraya Chakri invaded Laos, looted Vientiane and took the Emerald Buddha to Siam. It was installed in a shrine close to Wat Arun in Thonburi, the new capital of Siam. Chao Phra Chakri then seized the throne for himself and founded the Chakri Dynasty of the Rattanakosin Kingdom, where he would later be titled King Rama I. He shifted his capital across Chao Phraya river to its present location in Bangkok, and constructed the new Grand Palace including Wat Phra Kaew within its compound. Wat Phra Kaew was consecrated in 1785, and the Emerald Buddha was moved with great pomp to its current home in the &quot;ubosot&quot; of the Wat Phra Kaew temple complex in February/March 1785.

===Temples of the Emerald Buddha: visual journey===
==Description==

The Buddha image is made of a semi-precious green stone, described variously as jade or jasper rather than emerald, as &quot;emerald&quot; here refers to its colour rather than the stone. The image has not been analyzed to determine its exact composition or origin.

The figure is wide at the lap, and high. The Buddha is in a seated position, with the right leg resting on the left one, a style that suggest it might have been carved in the late Chiang Saen or Chiang Mai school, not much earlier than the fifteenth century CE. However, the Meditation attitude of the statue was not popular in Thailand but looks very much like some of the Buddha images of southern India and Sri Lanka, which led some to suggest an origin in India or Sri Lanka.

==Seasonal decoration==

The Emerald Buddha is adorned with three sets of gold seasonal decorations: two were made by Rama I, one for the summer and one for the rainy season, and a third made by Rama III for the winter or cool season. In 1996 to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the Bureau of the Royal Household commissioned a replica set of the seasonal decorations to be made in all the same materials. This new set was funded entirely by donations. The original set, which were made over 200 years ago, were retired and are on display at the Museum of the Emerald Buddha Temple in the Middle court of the Grand Palace.

The decorations are changed by the King of Thailand, or a senior member of the royal family in his stead, in a ceremony at the changing of the seasons – in the 1st Waning of lunar months 4, 8 and 12 (around March, August and November).

For the three seasons, there are three sets of decorations for the Emerald Buddha:
* Hot/summer season from March to August – a stepped, pointed crown (&quot;makuṭa&quot;); a breast pendant; a sash; a necklace, a number of armlets, bracelets and other items of royal attire. All items are made of enameled gold and embedded with precious and semi-precious stones.
* Rainy season from August to November – a pointed headpiece of enameled gold studded with sapphires; a gold-embossed monk&#x27;s robe draped over one shoulder (&quot;kasaya&quot;).
* Cool/winter season from November to March – a gold headpiece studded with diamonds; a jewel-fringed gold-mesh shawl draped over the rainy season attire.

The sets of gold clothing not in use at any given time are kept on display in the nearby Pavilion of Regalia, Royal Decorations, and Thai Coins on the grounds of the Grand Palace, where the public may view them.

==Ceremonies==
Early in the Bangkok period, the Emerald Buddha was occasionally taken out and paraded through the streets to relieve the city and countryside of various calamities (such as plague and cholera). This practice was discontinued during King Rama IV&#x27;s reign as it was feared that the image could be damaged during the procession and the king&#x27;s belief that; &quot;Diseases are caused by germs, not by evil spirits or the displeasure of the Buddha&quot;.

The Emerald Buddha also marks the changing of the seasons in Thailand, with the king presiding over seasonal ceremonies. In a ritual held at the temple three times a year, the decoration of the statue is changed at the start of each of the three seasons. The astrological dates for the ritual ceremonies, at the changing of the seasons, followed are in the first waning moon of the lunar calendar, months 4, 8 and 12 (around March, July, and November). Rama I initiated this ritual for the hot season and the rainy season; Rama III introduced the ritual for the winter season. The decoration which adorn the image, represent those of monks and the king, depending on the season, an indication of its symbolic role &quot;as Buddha and the King&quot;, which role is also enjoined on the king who formally dresses the Emerald Buddha himself. The costume change ritual is performed by the king who is the most elevated master of ceremonies for all Buddhist rites. During the ceremony, the king first climbs up to the pedestal, cleans the image by wiping away any dust with a wet cloth, and changes the gold headress of the Emerald Buddha. The king then worships nearby while an attendant performs the elaborate ritual of changing the rest of the decorative garments. The king also sprays holy water, which is mixed with the water rinsed from the wet cloth used to wipe the dust of the image, upon his subjects waiting outside the ordination hall. Previously this was a privilege afforded only to the princes and officials who were attending the ceremony (uposatha) inside the ubosot.

Ceremonies are also performed at the Emerald Buddha temple at other occasions such as Chakri Day (6 April 1782), a national holiday to honour the founding of the Chakri dynasty. The king and queen, an entourage of the royal family, as well as the prime minister, officials of the Ministry of Defence and other government departments, offer prayers at the temple.

<text>Traditional Lao music can be divided into classical and folk forms.

==Khene==
The Khene () is the instrument most identified with Laotian music. A national proverb says that &quot;a person living under a stilted house, eating sticky rice, listening to any music related to Lam () or Morlam, and playing the Khene is likely to be Lao or associated with Lao people.&quot;

Khenes are made from a special kind of bamboo. It looks slightly Andean in appearance with its sets of bamboo and reed pipes of various lengths, which are strapped together, and then blown into by the player. It can be played solo as in traditional Lao music or in combination with other musical instruments to accompany modern songs.

==Lao Musicians==
Vichai Sitviseth, ວິຈັຍ ສິຕວິເສສ/ วิจัย สิตวิเสส 
As 2023, Vichai Sitviseth is active as Lao Artist, Singer/Song-Writer from Chicago, Illinois USA. His music History:in 1989 Vichai had formed a live Band/Lukthung Neerankalวงดนตรี ลูกทุ่งนิรันดร์กาล as a lead Vocal/guitar in Rockford, Illinois USA. 2000-2005 he joined as a singer วงดนตรี RED ROSE/กุหลาบแดง and SEXY200/แซ็กซี2000 in Santa Rose, California USA. 2005-2009 he had toured music shows for ก วิเสส Koviseth and คำตุ่น วงสนิส Khamtoun and formed Rajasinh Band/วงดนตรี ราชาสิงห์ in Sacramento, California.

Laos been over from 13th century form 17th century there style has been In this respect, it differs markedly from the mahori orchestras of Cambodia and Siam.
Lao music today comes in a wide variety of styles and from different national origins. Outside of Laos, Lao music is mainly created in the United States, France and Canada. An increasing amount of transnational Lao (alternative) rock, pop and hip hop created a new &#x27;oeuvre&#x27; next to the traditional Lao music like morlam.

Most notable Lao hip hop artists from the US are Supasang aka Buc Supa, &#x27;gangsta rapper&#x27; Gumby AKA Pryce, Lil Yank from South Carolina, and Goof Loc from Fort Smith, Arkansas. Both rappers, Gumby and Supasang, made music videos and both rap in Lao language.

The most famous Lao artist from France is Willy Denzey, a R&amp;B singer who started his singing career in 2001 and achieved success with his hits &quot;Le mur du son&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Orphelin&quot; and &quot;Et si tu n&#x27;existais pas&quot; and his successful albums &quot;#1&quot; and

== Classical music==
The Lao classical orchestra can be divided into two categories, Sep Nyai and Sep Noi (or Mahori). The Sep Nyai is similar to Piphat, and is ceremonial and formal music and includes: two sets of gongs (khong vông), a xylophone (ranat), an oboe (pei or salai), two large kettle drums and two sets of cymbals (sing, similar to Thai ching). The Sep Noi, capable of playing popular tunes, includes two bowed string instruments, the So U and the So I, also known to the Indians. These instruments are similar to the Thai Saw u and Saw duang, respectively. They have a long neck or fingerboard and a small sound box; this sound box is made of bamboo in the So U and from a coconut in the So I. Both instruments have two strings, and the bow is slid between these two strings, which are tuned at a fifth apart and always played together. Furthermore, this mahori or sep noi ensemble (the sep nyai is strictly percussion and oboe) may include several khene. In this respect, it differs markedly from the mahori orchestras of Cambodia and Siam.

Some ethnomusicologists believe the ancient art music of the Khmer people has been best preserved in Laos—along with diverse forms of folk music related to the oldest types of Indian music—music that has largely disappeared in India itself. They claim to find in Laos a scale the ancient Hindus called the &quot;celestial scale,&quot; the Gandhara grama—which is a tempered heptatonic scale, or a division of the octave into seven equal parts.

The Royal Lao Orchestra, consisting of musicians of the former court of the king of Laos, who fled Laos following the communist takeover in 1975, now reside in Knoxville and Nashville, Tennessee, United States.

== Folk music ==
Lao folk music, known as Lam, is extemporaneous singing accompanied by the khene. It is popular both in Laos and Thailand, where there is a large ethnic Lao population. Moukdavanyh Santiphone is folk singer, who in 2015 was the most viewed Laotian musician on YouTube.

== History of Lao music in Thailand ==

Following the Siamese conquest of Laos in 1828 and the subsequent dispersion of the Lao population into Siam (Central Thailand), Lao music became fashionable there. Sir John Bowring, an envoy from Great Britain, described a meeting with the deputy king (ouparaja) of Siam in 1855 in which his host performed on the Lao khene; at a meeting two days later he entertained Bowring with Lao dancers and khene music. The Chronicles of the Fourth Reign said the deputy king enjoyed playing the khene and &quot;could perform the Lao type of dance and could skillfully perform the Lao comedy-singing. It is said that if one did not actually see his royal person, one would have thought the singer were a real Lao.&quot;

Immediately after the deputy king&#x27;s death in 1865, King Mongkut made known his fear that Lao musical culture would supplant Siamese genres and therefore banned Lao musical performances in a proclamation in which he complained that, &quot;Both men and women now play Lao khene (mo lam) throughout the kingdom...Lao khene is always played for the topknot cutting ceremony and for ordinations. We cannot give the priority to Lao entertainments. Thai have been performing Lao khene for more than ten years now and it has become very common. It is apparent that wherever there is an increase in the playing of Lao khene there is also less rain.&quot;

In recent years Lao popular music has made inroads into Thailand through the success of contemporary Lao musicians Alexandria, L.O.G. and CELLS. CELLS second Lao album &#x27;Saew&#x27; was released by Thai label GMM / Grammy in 2007 and received top 20 radio airplay in Bangkok for hit singles &#x27;Waan&#x27; and &#x27;Leuk Leuk&#x27;. Music videos for &#x27;Waan&#x27; and &#x27;Leuk Leuk&#x27; have also proved very popular on Thai music video channels and CELLS have made several well received tours of Thailand to promote the album.

<doc id="203883" wikidata="Q4288710" url="?curid=203883" title="Interstellar communication">
<text>Interstellar communication is the transmission of signals between planetary systems. Sending interstellar messages is potentially much easier than interstellar travel, being possible with technologies and equipment which are currently available. However, the distances from Earth to other potentially inhabited systems introduce prohibitive delays, assuming the limitations of the speed of light. Even an immediate reply to radio communications sent to stars tens of thousands of light-years away would take many human generations to arrive.

==Radio==
The SETI project has for the past several decades been conducting a search for signals being transmitted by extraterrestrial life located outside the Solar System, primarily in the radio frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum. Special attention has been given to the Water Hole, the frequency of one of neutral hydrogen&#x27;s absorption lines, due to the low background noise at this frequency and its symbolic association with the basis for what is likely to be the most common system of biochemistry (but see alternative biochemistry).

The regular radio pulses emitted by pulsars were briefly thought to be potential intelligent signals; the first pulsar to be discovered was originally designated &quot;LGM-1&quot;, for &quot;Little Green Men.&quot; They were quickly determined to be of natural origin, however.

Several attempts have been made to transmit signals to other stars as well. (See &quot;Realized projects&quot; at Active SETI.) One of the earliest and most famous was the 1974 radio message sent from the largest radio telescope in the world, the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. An extremely simple message was aimed at a globular cluster of stars known as M13 in the Milky Way Galaxy and at a distance of 30,000 light years from the Solar System. These efforts have been more symbolic than anything else, however. Further, a possible answer needs double the travel time, i.e. tens of years (near stars) or 60,000 years (M13).

==Other methods==

It has also been proposed that higher frequency signals, such as lasers operating at visible light frequencies, may prove to be a fruitful method of interstellar communication; at a given frequency it takes surprisingly small energy output for a laser emitter to outshine its local star from the perspective of its target.

Other more exotic methods of communication have been proposed, such as modulated neutrino or gravitational wave emissions. These would have the advantage of being essentially immune to interference by intervening matter.

Sending physical mail packets between stars may prove to be optimal for many applications. While mail packets would likely be limited to speeds far below that of electromagnetic or other light-speed signals (resulting in very high latency), the amount of information that could be encoded in only a few tons of physical matter could more than make up for it in terms of average bandwidth. The possibility of using interstellar messenger probes for interstellar communication — known as Bracewell probes — was first suggested by Ronald N. Bracewell in 1960, and the technical feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by the British Interplanetary Society&#x27;s starship study Project Daedalus in 1978. Starting in 1979, Robert Freitas advanced arguments

 for the proposition that physical space-probes provide a superior mode of interstellar communication to radio signals, then undertook telescopic searches for such probes in 1979 and 1982.

<doc id="203884" wikidata="Q1740479" url="?curid=203884" title="Khene">
<text>The khaen (; spelled &quot;Khaen&quot;, &quot;Kaen&quot;, &quot;Kehn&quot; or &quot;Ken&quot; in English; , ; , , ; , ; – &quot;Ken&quot;; Vietnamese: &quot;khèn&quot; or &quot;kheng&quot;) is a Lao mouth organ whose pipes, which are usually made of bamboo, are connected with a small, hollowed-out hardwood reservoir into which air is blown. The khaen is the national instrument of Laos. The khene music is an integral part of Lao life that promotes family and social cohesion and it was inscribed in 2017 on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity&quot;.&quot; It is used among the ethnic Lao Isan and Some tai ethnic groups such as Tai dam In north Vietnam and Lao population of the province of Stung Treng and is used in &quot;lakhon ken&quot;, a Cambodian dance drama genre that features the &quot;khaen&quot; as the main instrument In Vietnam, this instrument is used among the Tai peoples and the Muong people.

The khaen uses a free reed made of brass and/or silver. It is related to Western free-reed instruments such as the harmonium, concertina, accordion, harmonica, and bandoneon, which were developed beginning in the 18th century from the Chinese sheng, a related instrument, a specimen of which had been carried to St. Petersburg, Russia.

The khaen has five different &quot;lai&quot;, or pentatonic modes with specific drone pitches, organized into two families (&quot;thang san&quot; and &quot;thang yao&quot;). The &quot;thang san&quot; family includes &quot;lai&quot; &quot;sutsanaen&quot; (G A C D E), &quot;lai po sai&quot; (C D F G A), and &quot;lai soi&quot; (D E G A B), while the &quot;thang yao&quot; family includes &quot;lai yai&quot; (A C D E G) and &quot;lai noi&quot; (D F G A C). &quot;Lai po sai&quot; is considered to be the oldest of the modes and &quot;lai sutsanaen&quot; the &quot;Father of the Lai Khaen.&quot; Khaen can be played as a solo instrument (&quot;dio khene&quot;), as part of an ensemble (such as &quot;wong pong lang&quot; and &quot;khene wong&quot;), or as an accompaniment to a Lao or Isan solo singer (&quot;mor lam&quot;). It is often played in combination with a traditional fretted plucked lute called &quot;phin&quot;.

Composers who have written notated music for the instrument include Annea Lockwood, Christopher Adler, David Loeb, and Vera Ivanova.

==Tuning==
The khene has seven tones per octave, with intervals similar to that of the Western diatonic natural A-minor scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. A khene can be made in a particular key but cannot be tuned after the reed is set and the pipes are cut.

==Varieties==
The khene comes in several varieties:
*Khaen hok (Lao: ແຄນຫົກ Thai: แคนหก, &quot;hok&quot; meaning &quot;six&quot;) – small &quot;khaen&quot; with 12 pipes in two rows of 6; usually used by children or beginners, or sold to tourists
*Khaen jet ( Thai: แคนเจ็ด, &quot;jet&quot; meaning &quot;seven&quot;) – medium-sized khaen with 14 pipes in two rows of 7
*Khaen pet (Lao: ແຄນແປດ Thai: แคนแปด, &quot;pet&quot; meaning &quot;eight&quot;) – medium-sized &quot;khaen&quot; with 16 pipes in two rows of 8; the most commonly used variety
*Khaen gao (Lao: ແຄນເກົ້າ Thai: แคนเก้า, &quot;gao&quot; meaning &quot;nine&quot;) – &quot;khaen&quot; with 18 pipes in two rows of 9; usually very long
*Khaen sip (Lao: ແຄນສິບ Thai: แคนสิบ, &quot;sip&quot; meaning &quot;ten&quot;) – an &quot;improved&quot; version of the &quot;khaen paet&quot;; little used

==Outside Southeast Asia==

In the United States, the top master khaen artist is a blind Laotian-born player, Bounseung Synanonh. Master Synanonh started playing the khaen at age twelve and later lost his eyesight at age 15. Master Synanonh immigrated to the U.S. as a refugee in the early 1980s. In 1987, he performed for President Reagan at the White House.  He also recorded with the World Music Institute under the direction of Terry Miller, an ethnomusicologist.  In 2007, he performed at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C. In Thailand, one of the top virtuoso khaen soloists is the blind musician Sombat Simla. The instrument has also attracted a few non-Asian performers, including University of San Diego professor Christopher Adler, who also composes for the instrument; English musician Clive Bell (UK); Vancouver-based composer/performer Randy Raine-Reusch (Canada), who played khaen on Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Pump&quot; (1989), Cranberries&#x27; &quot;To the Faithful Departed&quot; (1996), and Yes&#x27;s &quot;The Ladder&quot; (1999); and Jaron Lanier (United States). Since the early 21st century, the California-born khaen player Jonny Olsen has achieved familiarity in Laos and Thailand by appearing on numerous Thai and Lao TV Shows and performing live concerts in Thailand and the U.S. Olsen is the first foreigner to win a khaen championship in Khon Kaen, Thailand in 2005. Stephen Molyneux (United States) has played the khaen on his releases &quot;The Arbitrary State&quot; (2010), &quot;The Stars Are the Light Show&quot; (2012), &quot;Wings and Circles&quot; (2016), and in select live performances. Molyneux bought a khaen in Bangkok in 2010 after developing an interest in the instrument while traveling in Laos and Thailand.

<text>The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is the fundamental governing document of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, one of the 50 individual states that make up the United States of America. It consists of a preamble, declaration of rights, description of the principles and framework of government, and articles of amendment.

Created by the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1779, the document was primarily authored by American founding father and future president John Adams. Following its approval by convention delegates, it was approved by voters on June 15, 1780, and became effective October 25 of that year. 

The Massachusetts Constitution was the last to be written among the initial thirteen U.S. states. It was unique in being structured with chapters, sections and articles, as opposed to being a list of provisions. It served as a model for the U.S. Constitution, drafted seven years later, both structurally and substantively, and also influenced later revisions of many other state constitutions.

The Massachusetts Constitution is among the oldest functioning written constitutions in continuous effect in the world, predated only by the 1777 Constitution of Vermont and by sections of the Constitution of San Marino and the Magna Carta. It was also the first constitution in history to be created by a convention called for that purpose, rather than by a legislative body. 

It has been amended 121 times as of 2022.

==History==
In the spring of 1775, Adams took the position that each state should call a special convention to write a constitution and then submit it to a popular vote. He told the Continental Congress that:

The legislative body of Massachusetts, known as the Massachusetts General Court, instead drafted its own version of a constitution and submitted it to the voters, who rejected it in 1778. That version did not provide for the separation of powers, nor did it include a statement of individual rights. The General Court then organized the election of delegates from each town to participate in a convention that would draft a constitution and submit their work to a popular vote with the understanding that its adoption would require approval by two-thirds of the voters. The constitutional convention met in Cambridge in September 1779.

The convention sat from September 1 to October 30, 1779. Its 312 members chose a committee of thirty members to prepare a new constitution and declaration of rights. That committee asked Adams to draft a declaration of rights. It appointed a subcommittee of James Bowdoin, Samuel Adams, and John Adams to draft the constitution and that trio delegated the drafting to John Adams alone. He later wrote that he constituted a &quot;sub-sub committee of one&quot;. An article on religion was referred to members of the clergy, which resulted in a form of religious establishment entirely unlike that later adopted at the federal level. Adams advocated for an end to that establishment when revisions to the constitution were considered in 1820 and his views were adopted in 1832.

Adams&#x27;s draft declaration of rights read in part: &quot;All men are born equally free and independent...&quot; Before being adopted by the constitutional convention it was revised to read: &quot;All men are born free and equal...&quot; At the insistence of Adams, the document referred to the state as a &quot;commonwealth&quot;.

Male voters 21 years or older ratified the constitution and declaration of rights at the convention on June 15, 1780, and it became effective on October 25, 1780.

==Preamble==
The preamble of the constitution provided a model that was drawn on when the United States Constitution was composed a few years later, including some phrases near the end. It reads:

==Declaration of Rights==
&quot;Part the First: A Declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts&quot; consists of thirty articles. The first states:

This article was the subject of a landmark case in 1781 before a Massachusetts court sitting in Great Barrington, &quot;Brom and Bett v. Ashley&quot;. Elizabeth Freeman (whose slave name was &quot;Bett&quot;), a black slave owned by Colonel John Ashley, sued for her freedom based on this article. The jury agreed that slavery was inconsistent with the Massachusetts Constitution and awarded Freeman £5 in damages and her freedom. A few years later, Quock Walker, a black slave, sued his master for false imprisonment; the jury found for Walker and awarded him damages of £50. His master was then subject to criminal prosecution for assault and battery against Walker and was found guilty by a jury, which imposed a fine of 40/- (£2). In this manner, slavery lost any legal protection in Massachusetts, making it a tortious act under the law, effectively abolishing it within the Commonwealth.

In 1976 by amendment Article CVI, this article was amended to change the word &quot;men&quot; to &quot;people&quot;. That amendment also added an additional sentence: &quot;Equality under the law shall not be denied or abridged because of sex, race, color, creed or national origin.&quot;

This article was also the basis for the 2003 Supreme Judicial Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&quot; required the Commonwealth to extend marriage rights to same-sex couples on an equal basis with different-sex couples.

The next several Articles within the &quot;Part the First&quot; in the original 1780 Constitution of Massachusetts called upon the people of the Commonwealth as being their &quot;right as well as the duty of all men&quot; (Article II) to a strong religious conviction and belief.

Article III continued by noting that &quot;the happiness of a people&quot; and &quot;preservation of civil government&quot; is explicitly tied to religion and morality. This article established the possibility of &quot;town religions&quot; by allowing the state legislature, though Massachusetts cannot declare or recognize a state religion, to require towns to pay for the upkeep of a Protestant church out of local tax funds, with the town to determine by majority vote the denomination it would support as its parish church.

From 1780 to 1824 these democratically selected parish churches were considered the only churches with full legal rights, as &quot;voluntary&quot; churches ran against the Federalist ideal of a commonwealth. Until 1822 all residents of a town were required to belong to the parish church. In that year they were allowed to attend a neighboring town&#x27;s church instead, and in 1824 full religious freedom was granted. However, the parishes remained beneficiaries of local taxes and were unable to expel dissident parishioners, since as residents they were members of the parish until they declared otherwise. Soon both dissident churches and the majority Congregational Church increasingly recognized that this system was contrary to the voluntary nature of religious worship. This section of the constitution was amended by bipartisan consensus in 1834 at the same time that several blue laws were repealed.

==Frame of Government==

Part II, Chapter I, Section I

The opening of the &quot;Part the Second&quot; lays down the official name of the State of Massachusetts.

The first three articles in Chapter I, Section I,of the Massachusetts Constitution establishes the three primary branches of government; an executive, a bicameral legislature, and an independent judiciary. The design of this system, unique at the time, was created to ensure the proper separation of power between the different entities. The framers of the state constitution intended by this means to prevent the abuse of power by any one branch.

===Removal – impeachment===

Massachusetts allows impeachment of government officials through the legislature. They can also disqualify convicted officials from ever holding any place within the commonwealth.

==Articles of Amendment==
There are 121 Articles of Amendment that have been added to the Massachusetts Constitution. The most recent one places a 4% marginal tax on income over $1,000,000 and was approved by a vote of 52% to 48% in 2022.

The amendment process is governed by the 48th Article of Amendment to the Constitution, which establishes an indirect initiative process that requires action by the state legislature, followed by a referendum.

For an amendment to be placed before the voters as a referendum, a state constitutional convention, a joint meeting of both houses of the legislature sitting as one body, in each of two successive two-year legislative sessions, must provide the required number of votes, which varies according to how the proposed amendment comes before the convention.

If it is a &quot;legislative amendment&quot; proposed by a legislator, the threshold is 50% of the members. If it is an &quot;initiative amendment&quot; put forward by petition, the threshold is 25% of the members. In both cases, the calculation of the votes is based on the number of seats in the constitutional convention, not the members present or seated.

The number of certified signatures required on the petitions is 3% of the total vote cast for all candidates for governor (excluding blanks) at the immediately preceding state election.

==Constitutional conventions==
The state has held four constitutional conventions of elected delegates (as opposed to those that are special sessions of the legislature):

*Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1779–1780, drew up the original document
*Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1820–1821, submitted a number of articles to a popular vote, resulting in the adoption of the first nine amendments and the rejection of a number of other proposals
*Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1853
*Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1917–1918

<text>Somdetch Brhat-Anya Fa Ladhuraniya Sri Sadhana Kanayudha Maharaja Brhat Rajadharana Sri Chudhana Negara (), better known as Fa Ngum (Laotian: ຟ້າງູ່ມ ; 1316 – 1393, born in Muang Sua, died in Nan), established the Lao kingdom of Lan Xang in 1353.

==Early life==
Phraya Fa Ngum, son of the exiled Phi Fa, grandson of Phraya Khamphong, and great-grandson of the exiled Phraya Lang, was born in 1316. He was raised by the religious scholar Maha Pasaman Chao (&quot;Phra Mahasamana&quot;). At sixteen, he married a Cambodian princess known variously as Kaeo, Yot Kaeo, or Kaeo Lot Fa.

Fa Ngoum or Fa Ngum was born in Muang Sua, a Lao principality located on the site of present-day Luang Prabang, and founded the Lan Xang Hôm Khao (better known as Lan Xang) kingdom in Laos in 1353. Fa Ngum was a grandson of Souvanna Khamphong, titled Phagna Khampong, ruler of Muang Sua and grandfather of Fa Ngum, banished Fa Ngum and his father, Chao Fa Ngiao, to the Khmer kingdom of Angkor in the 1320s due to his father&#x27;s indiscretion with one of the grandfather&#x27;s wives. Another source said that Fa Ngum was sent to exile because Fa Ngoum was miraculously born with thirty-three teeth which was an omen of threatening the well-being of his grandfather&#x27;s kingdom. Fa Ngum subsequently married a Khmer princess Princess Kèo Kèngkanya. With the support of Jayavarman IX, Fa Ngum returned to Muang Sua with a 10,000 armed men to gain control and consolidate his kingdom. Princess Kèo Kèngkanya later died from plague, while he was campaigning North against the Mongols. In 1353, Fa Ngum founded the kingdom of Lan Xang Hôm Khao—&quot;land of one million elephants and a white parasol.&quot; The elephant symbolized military power since most battles were fought using elephants, and the white parasol symbolized royalty, particularly a Buddhist monarch. Fa Ngum further legitimized his rule by enshrining the Prabang Buddha image as the spiritual protector of the kingdom in Viang Chan Viang Kham (present-day Vientiane). He made Xiang Dong Xiang Thong (later renamed Luang Prabang) his capital.

Fa Ngum is credited with introducing Khmer culture and Singhalese Buddhism to the region. His religious tutor, Maha Pasaman also brought back sacred texts and the Phra Bang.

Political turmoil ensued, and Fa Ngum&#x27;s son Oun Huan also known as Samsènethai, succeeded the throne in 1368.

==King of Lan Xang (Million Elephants)==
Fa Ngum conquered western Nghệ An as well as the valleys between Red River and Black River in Vietnam (Tonkin) and modern day Isan in Thailand. In 1352–1354, he conquered Muang Sing, Muang Houm, Chiang Hung, Chiang Saen, Chiang Mai, Pak Ou and Pak Beng. In 1353, he conquered Vientiane, Xiang Khouang and then Luang Phrabang. He fought a battle against his uncle near Xiang Dong Xiang Thong and won, becoming the undisputed master of the land, which he named Lan Xang and in keeping with his Khmer wife&#x27;s wishes, made Theravada Buddhism the state religion. In 1350, he symbolically pledged allegiance to the State of Mong Mao, however this didn&#x27;t have much of an impact on his reign.

In 1373, the royals and nobles of his own court exiled him. His son Oun Huan, often called Samsenethai, a name adopted for the 300,000 Tai people of Lan Xang; then ascended to the throne of Lan Xang, who was barely 18 when he acceded the throne. He was named after the 1376 census, which concluded that he ruled over 300,000 Tais living in Laos;
samsèn
means, literally, 300,000. He set up a new administrative system based on the existing
muang, nominating governors to each that lasted until it was abolished by the Communist government in 1975. Samsènthai&#x27;s death was followed by a period of unrest. Under King Xaiyachakkaphat-Phènphèo (1441–1478), the kingdom came under increasing threat from the Vietnamese. King Xaiyachakkaphat&#x27;s eldest son, the Prince of Xianglo, secured a holy white elephant. The emperor of Vietnam, learning of this momentous discovery, asked to be sent some of the beast&#x27;s hairs. Disliking the Vietnamese, the Prince dispatched a box of its excrement instead, whereupon the Emperor formed an improbably large 550,000 man army. The Prince&#x27;s army numbered 200,000 and 2,000 elephants. The massive Vietnamese army finally prevailed and entered and sacked Luang Prabang. But shortly thereafter they were driven out by Xaiyachakkaphat-Phènphèo&#x27;s son, King Souvanna Banlang (1478–1485). Peace was only fully restored under King Visounnarath (1500–1520).

<text>Obock (also Obok, , ) is a small port town in Djibouti. It is located on the Northern shore of the Gulf of Tadjoura, where it opens out into the Gulf of Aden. The town is home to an airstrip and has ferries to Djibouti City. The French form Obock derives from Arabic &quot;Oboh&quot;, which is a deformation of Oboki, a name given to a local wadi.

==History==
The fishing village was originally built on the plateau of Dala-h Húgub near the Dar&#x27;i Wadi, with some houses constructed of mud and stone and Daboyta. Most of the inhabitants made their living through animal husbandry, fishing, commerce and used a well for drinking water. During the Middle Ages, Obock was ruled by the Ifat Sultanate and then the Adal Sultanate. The Sultans of Raheita emerged from the Adal Sultanate. Although nominally part of the Ottoman Empire since 1554, between 1821 and 1841, Muhammad Ali, Pasha of Egypt, came to control Yemen and modern-day Eritrea, and claims on Ethiopia as far as Harar. In 1884, the commander of the patrol sloop L’Inferent, a French ship, confirmed the Egyptian presence in the area around Obock. The commander of the patrol sloop Le Vaudreuil also reported that the Egyptians were occupying the interior between Obock and Tadjoura. In actuality, however, Egypt had little authority over the interior and their period of rule on the coast was brief, lasting only a few years before the Egyptian garrison was withdrawn from the area in 1862,

===French Somaliland===

During the Scramble for Africa, growing French interest in the area took place against a backdrop of British activity in Egypt and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Between 1883 and 1887, France signed various treaties with the then ruling Somali and Afar Sultans, which allowed it to expand the protectorate to include the Gulf of Tadjoura. Obock was originally significant as the site of the first French colony in the region, established by treaty with the local Afar rulers on March 11, 1862. The French were interested in having a coaling station for steamships, which would become especially important upon the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. (Up to that time French ships had to buy coal at the British port of Aden across the gulf, an unwise dependency in case of war.) 

The site was not the subject of any occupation, just visited by the ships of the naval divisions assigned to the Indian Ocean, until the installation of trader Pierre Arnoux in 1881, followed by Paul Soleillet. Obock became a true colony in 1884 with the arrival in August of Léonce Lagarde, who established an administration and extended French possession in the Gulf of Tadjoura, forming the Territory of Obock and outbuildings, with Obock as its capital. By 1885, Obock had 800 inhabitants and a school. However, the anchorage was more exposed than the site of Djibouti on the south side of the Gulf of Tadjoura, and the colonial administration moved there in 1894. The population of Obock subsequently declined. 
 However, until the French occupation of Tadjoura in 1927, Obock remained the only place on the northern coast of the Gulf of Tadjoura with a colonial administrative office. It became the capital of the Dankali District in 1914, then an administrative position from 1927 which was subsumed into the &quot;Circle of Adaels&quot; in 1929. During World War II, Italy&#x27;s declaration of war on France and Great Britain came on 10 June 1940, with them undertaking some offensive actions beginning on 18 June. From Harrar Governorate, troops under General Guglielmo Nasi to attack French Somaliland, there was some skirmishes. When the government on 10 July learned that the armistice was not yet put into effect in French Somaliland, President Philippe Pétain a collaborationist government at Vichy sent General Gaëtan Germain as his personal representative to correct the situation. Negotiations at Dewele, Italian East Africa on the local implementation of the armistice were only finally completed on 8 August. By that time, the British offensive against the Italians had tightened the blockade of French Somaliland. Famine set in malnutrition-related diseases took many lives, 70% of them women and children and many townsfolk left for the hinterland. The locals named the blockade the carmii, a word for a type of sorghum usually reserved for cattle, but used as human food at the height of the famine. Obock became the capital of a circle responsible for resupplying the colony during the Allied blockade from 1941 to 1943. Only a few Arab dhows (boutres) managed to run the blockade to Djibouti and Obock and only two French ships from Madagascar managed to run it. The Japanese declaration of war (7 December 1941) gave the colony some respite, since the British were forced to withdraw all but two ships from the blockade for use in the Far East. The Commander-in-Chief, East Africa, William Platt, codenamed the negotiations for the surrender of French Somaliland &quot;Pentagon&quot;, because there were five sides: himself, the Vichy governor, the Free French, the British minister at Addis Ababa and the United States. Christian Raimond Dupont surrendered and Colonel Raynal&#x27;s troops crossed back into French Somaliland on 26 December 1942, completing its liberation. The official handover took place at 10:00 p.m. on 28 December. The first governor appointed under the Free French was André Bayardelle. A local battalion from French Somaliland participated in the Liberation of Paris in 1944. In 1963, Obock&#x27;s circle was created by division of that of Tadjourah region.

===Djibouti===
A third independence referendum was held in the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas on 8 May 1977. The previous referendums were held in 1958 and 1967, which rejected independence. This referendum backed independence from France. A landslide 98.8% of the electorate supported disengagement from France, officially marking Djibouti&#x27;s independence. Obock is expected to be the site of the Chinese naval base in Djibouti.

Obock has become a key stop in the route for illegal migration from Ethiopia to Saudi Arabia, being the location from where smugglers take migrants on boats to Yemen.

==Demographics==
As of the 2024 census, the population of Obock was at 20,152. The town inhabitants belong to various mainly Afro-Asiatic-speaking ethnic groups. The Afar and Issa Somali, are predominant.

==Postage stamps==
During its time as a French colony, Obock issued its own postage stamps; for more detail see Postage stamps and postal history of Obock.

==Overview==
Obock is connected to other environs by RN-14 National Highway. A ferry ride from Djibouti City to Obock takes three hours; the distance is .

==Climate and geography==
Obock has a dry climate. It is classified as hot and semi-arid (Köppen climate classification &quot;&quot;BSh&quot;&quot;). Obock is 13 m above sea level on the plateau of Gazelles (&quot;Dala-h Húgub in Afar&quot;) in desert terrain. The sky is always clear and bright throughout the year.
The submarine coastal spring waters have an interesting geothermal potential (with a deep temperature of approximatively 200 °C).

<text>Adobe Acrobat is a family of application software and web services developed by Adobe Inc. to view, create, manipulate, print and manage Portable Document Format (PDF) files.

The family comprises Acrobat Reader (formerly Reader), Acrobat (formerly Exchange) and Acrobat.com. The basic Acrobat Reader, available for several desktop and mobile platforms, is freeware; it supports viewing, printing, scaling or resizing and annotating of PDF files. Additional, &quot;Premium&quot;, services are available on paid subscription. The commercial proprietary Acrobat, available for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and mobile, can also create, edit, convert, digitally sign, encrypt, export and publish PDF files. Acrobat.com complements the family with a variety of enterprise content management and file hosting services.

== Purpose ==
The main function of Adobe Acrobat is creating, viewing, and editing PDF documents. It can import popular document and image formats and save them as PDF. It is also possible to import a scanner&#x27;s output, a website, or the contents of the Windows clipboard.

Because of the nature of the PDF, however, once a PDF document is created, its natural organization and flow cannot be meaningfully modified. In other words, Adobe Acrobat is able to modify the contents of paragraphs and images, but doing so does not repaginate the whole document to accommodate for a longer or shorter document. Acrobat can crop PDF pages, change their order, manipulate hyperlinks, digitally sign a PDF file, add comments, redact certain parts of the PDF file, and ensure its adherence to such standards as PDF/A.

==History==

Adobe Acrobat was launched in 1993 and had to compete with other products and proprietary formats that aimed to create digital documents:
* Common Ground from No Hands Software Inc.
* Envoy from WordPerfect Corporation
* Folio Views from NextPage
* Replica from Farallon Computing
* WorldView from Interleaf
* DjVu from AT&amp;T Laboratories
Adobe has renamed the Acrobat products several times, in addition to merging, splitting and discontinuing them. Initially, the offered products were called Acrobat Reader, Acrobat Exchange and Acrobat Distiller. &quot;Acrobat Exchange&quot; soon became &quot;Acrobat&quot;. Over time, &quot;Acrobat Reader&quot; became &quot;Reader&quot;. Between versions 3 and 5, Acrobat did not have several editions. In 1999, the Acrobat.com service came to being and introduced several web services whose names started with &quot;Acrobat&quot;, but eventually, &quot;Acrobat.com&quot; was downgraded from the name of the family of services, to that of one of those services.

Unlike most other Adobe products, such as members of Adobe Creative Suite family, the Acrobat products do not have icons that display two letters on a colored rectangle.

===Document Cloud===

In April 2015, Adobe introduced the &quot;Document Cloud&quot; branding (alongside its Creative Cloud) to signify its adoption of the cloud storage and the software as a service model. Programs under this branding received a &quot;DC&quot; suffix. In addition, &quot;Reader&quot; was renamed back to &quot;Acrobat Reader&quot;. Following the introduction of Document Cloud, Acrobat.com was discontinued as their features were integrated into the desktop programs and mobile apps.

The GUI had major changes with the introduction of Acrobat DC in 2015, which supports Windows 7 and later, and OS X 10.9 and later. Version numbers are now identified by the last two digits of the year of major release, and the month and year is specified; the previous version was 12, but examples of the DC (Document Cloud) Acrobat product family versions are DC June 2016, version 15.016.20045, released 2 June 2016 and DC Classic January 2016, version 15.006.30119, released 12 January 2016. From DC 2015 the Acrobat family is available in two tracks, the original track, now named Classic, and the Continuous track. Updates for the Classic track are released quarterly, and do not include new features, whereas updates for the Continuous track are issued more frequently, and implemented silently and automatically.

The last pre-DC version, Acrobat XI, was updated to 11.0.23 version (and this was the final release) on November 14, 2017, support for which had ended a month earlier on October 15, 2017. In September 2020, Adobe released a feature to make documents easier to read on phones called &quot;Liquid Mode&quot; using its Sensei AI.

=== Supported file formats ===
The table below contains some of the supported file formats that can be opened or accessed in Adobe Acrobat.
== Internationalization and localization ==

Adobe Acrobat is available in the following languages: Arabic, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish and Ukrainian. Arabic and Hebrew versions are available from WinSoft International, Adobe Systems&#x27; internationalization and localization partner.

Before Adobe Acrobat DC, separate Arabic and Hebrew versions were developed specifically for these languages, which are normally written right-to-left. These versions include special TouchUp properties to manage digits, ligatures option and paragraph direction in right-to-left Middle Eastern scripts such as Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian, as well as standard left-to-right Indian scripts such as Devanagari and Gujarati. The Web Capture feature can convert single web pages or entire web sites into PDF files, while preserving the content&#x27;s original text encoding. Acrobat can also copy Arabic and Hebrew text to the system clipboard in its original encoding; if the target application is also compatible with the text encoding, then the text will appear in the correct script.

==Security==
A comprehensive list of security bulletins for most Adobe products and related versions is published on their &quot;Security bulletins and advisories&quot; page and in other related venues. In particular, the detailed history of security updates for all versions of Adobe Acrobat has been made public.

From Version 3.02 onwards, Acrobat Reader has included support for JavaScript. This functionality allows a PDF document creator to include code which executes when the document is read. Malicious PDF files that attempt to attack security vulnerabilities can be attached to links on web pages or distributed as email attachments. While JavaScript is designed without direct access to the file system to make it &quot;safe&quot;, vulnerabilities have been reported for abuses such as distributing malicious code by Acrobat programs. Adobe applications had already become the most popular client-software targets for attackers during the last quarter of 2009. McAfee predicted that Adobe software, especially Reader and Flash, would be the primary target for software attacks in the year 2010.

===September 2006 warning===
On September 13, 2006, David Kierznowski provided sample PDF files illustrating JavaScript vulnerabilities. Since at least version 6, JavaScript can be disabled using the preferences menu and embedded URLs that are launched are intercepted by a security warning dialog box to either allow or block the website from activating.

===February 2009 warning===
On February 19, 2009, Adobe released a Security Bulletin announcing JavaScript vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Acrobat versions 9 and earlier. As a workaround for this issue, US-CERT recommended disabling JavaScript in the affected Adobe products, canceling integration with Windows shell and web browsers (while carrying out an extended version of de-integration for Internet Explorer), deactivating Adobe indexing services and avoiding all PDF files from external sources.

===February 2013 warning===
Adobe has identified critical vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Acrobat XI (11.0.01 and earlier) for Windows and Macintosh, 9.5.3 and earlier 9.x versions. These vulnerabilities could cause the application to crash and potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system. There have been reports of these vulnerabilities being exploited to trick Windows users into clicking on a malicious PDF file delivered in an email message. Adobe recommended users update their product installations.

===January 2016 warning===
Adobe has released security updates for Adobe Acrobat and Reader for Windows and Macintosh. These updates address critical vulnerabilities that could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system.

<doc id="203897" wikidata="Q355207" url="?curid=203897" title="Hyundai Group">
<text>Hyundai Group (; ) is a South Korean conglomerate founded by Chung Ju-yung. The group was founded in 1947 as a construction company. With government assistance, Chung and his family members rapidly expanded into various industries, eventually becoming South Korea&#x27;s second chaebol. Chung Ju-yung was directly in control of the company until his death in 2001.

The company spun off many of its better known businesses after the 1997 Asian financial crisis and founder Chung Ju-yung&#x27;s death, including Hyundai Motor Group, Hyundai Department Store Group, and Hyundai Heavy Industries Group. The Hyundai Group now focuses on elevators and tourism to Mount Kumgang.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Hyundai&quot; comes from the Korean word (), meaning &quot;modernity&quot;.

== History ==
In 1947, Hyundai Togun (Hyundai Engineering and Construction), the initial company of the Hyundai Group, was established by Chung Ju-yung. Hyundai Construction began operating outside of South Korea in 1965, initially entering the markets of Guam, Thailand and Vietnam. In 1950, Hyundai Togun was renamed Hyundai Construction. In 1958, Keumkang Company was established to make construction materials. In 1965, Hyundai Construction began its first overseas venture, a highway project in Thailand.

In 1967, Hyundai Motors was established. Hyundai Heavy Industries was founded in 1973, and completed the construction of its first ships in June 1974. In 1975, the group began construction on an integrated car factory and launched a new Korean vehicle. In 1973, the group&#x27;s shipyard was incorporated as Hyundai Shipbuilding and Heavy Industries and renamed Hyundai Heavy Industries in 1978. In 1976, Hyundai Corporation was established as a trading arm. The same year, Asia Merchant Marine Co. established, later renamed Hyundai Merchant Marine.In 1977, Asan Foundation was established. In 1983 Hyundai entered the semiconductor industry through the establishment of Hyundai Electronics (renamed Hynix in 2001). In 1986, Hyundai Research Institute was established.

In 1986 a Hyundai-manufactured IBM PC-XT compatible called the Blue Chip PC was sold in discount and toy stores throughout the US. It was one of the earliest PC clones marketed toward consumers instead of business. In 1988, Asian Sangsun was established, renamed Hyundai Logistics in 1992.

By the mid-1990s Hyundai comprised over 60 subsidiary companies and was active in a diverse range of activities including automobile manufacturing, construction, chemicals, electronics, financial services, heavy industry and shipbuilding. In the same period it had total annual revenues of around US$90 billion and over 200,000 employees. In December 1995, Hyundai announced a major management restructuring, affecting 404 executives.

During 1997 Asian financial crisis, Hyundai acquired Kia Motors and LG Semi-Conductor.

In 1998, Korea&#x27;s economic crisis forced the group to begin restructuring efforts, which include selling off subsidiaries and focusing on five core business areas. Nevertheless, Hyundai began South Korean tourism to North Korea&#x27;s Kumgangsan. In 1999, Hyundai Asan was established to operating Kumgang tourism, the Kaesong Industrial Complex, and other inter-Korean work. In April 1999 Hyundai announced an enormous corporate restructuring, involving a two-thirds reduction of the number of business units and a plan to break up the group into five independent business groups by 2003. In 2001, the founder Chung Ju-yung died, and the Hyundai Group conglomerate continued to be dismantled.

In 2007, Hyundai Construction Equipment India Pvt. Ltd. was established in India. In 2010, Hyundai Group was selected as a preferred bidder by creditors for the acquisition of Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction.
As of 2023, Hyundai Group &quot;includes divisions that build and export diesel and electric locomotives, freight cars, and passenger coaches for the railroad industry, and offshore drilling and extraction equipment to the oil industry.&quot; Hyundai&#x27;s &quot;[i]nternational exports range from heavy industrial equipment to consumer products, and include cement, pianos, military uniforms, and consumer electronics products. Hyundai is represented on all continents but Australia, and has a number of international subsidiaries under its control.&quot;

<doc id="203901" wikidata="Q127723" url="?curid=203901" title="Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee">
<text>The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and later, the Student National Coordinating Committee (SNCC, pronounced ) was the principal channel of student commitment in the United States to the civil rights movement during the 1960s. Emerging in 1960 from the student-led sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in Greensboro, North Carolina, and Nashville, Tennessee, the Committee sought to coordinate and assist direct-action challenges to the civic segregation and political exclusion of African Americans. From 1962, with the support of the Voter Education Project, SNCC committed to the registration and mobilization of black voters in the Deep South. Affiliates such as the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and the Lowndes County Freedom Organization in Alabama also worked to increase the pressure on federal and state government to enforce constitutional protections.

By the mid-1960s the measured nature of the gains made, and the violence with which they were resisted, were generating dissent from the group&#x27;s principles of nonviolence, of white participation in the movement, and of field-driven, as opposed to national-office, leadership and direction. By this time many of SNCC&#x27;s original organizers were working with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and others were being lost to a de-segregating Democratic Party and to federally-funded anti-poverty programs. Following an aborted merger with the Black Panther Party in 1968, SNCC effectively dissolved.

Because of the successes of its early years, SNCC is credited with breaking down barriers, both institutional and psychological, to the empowerment of African-American communities.

==1960: Emergence from the sit-in movement==
The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) was formed in April 1960 at a conference at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina, attended by 126 student delegates from 58 sit-in centers in 12 states, from 19 northern colleges, and from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR), the National Student Association (NSA), and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). Among those attending who were to emerge as strategists for the committee and its field projects were Fisk University student Diane Nash, Tennessee State student Marion Barry, and American Baptist Theological Seminary students James Bevel, John Lewis, and Bernard Lafayette, all involved in the Nashville Student Movement; their mentor at Vanderbilt University, James Lawson; Charles F. McDew, who led student protests at South Carolina State University; J. Charles Jones, Johnson C. Smith University, who organized 200 students to participate in sit-ins at whites-only department stores and service counters throughout Charlotte, North Carolina; Julian Bond from Morehouse College, Atlanta; and Stokely Carmichael from Howard University, Washington, D.C.

The invitation had been issued by Martin Luther King Jr. on behalf of the SCLC, but the conference had been conceived and organized by then SCLC director Ella Baker. Baker was a critic of what she perceived as King&#x27;s top-down leadership at the SCLC. &quot;Strong people don&#x27;t need strong leaders,&quot; she told the young activists. Speaking to the students&#x27; own experience of protest organization, it was Baker&#x27;s vision that appeared to prevail.

SNCC did not constitute itself as the youth wing of SCLC. It steered an independent course that sought to channel the students&#x27; program through the organizers out in the field rather than through its national office in Atlanta (&quot;small and rather dingy,&quot; located above a beauty parlor near the city&#x27;s five Black colleges). Under the constitution adopted, the SNCC comprised representatives from each of the affiliated &quot;local protest groups&quot;, and these groups (and not the committee and its support staff) were to be recognized as &quot;the primary expression of a protest in a given area.&quot;

Under the same general principle, that &quot;the people who do the work should make the decisions&quot;, the students committed to a &quot;participatory democracy&quot; which, avoiding office hierarchy, sought to reach decisions by consensus. Group meetings were convened in which every participant could speak for as long as they wanted and the meeting would continue until everyone who was left was in agreement with the decision. Given the physical risks involved in many activities in which SNCC was to engage this was thought particularly important: &quot;no one felt comfortable making a decision by majority rule that might cost somebody else&#x27;s life.&quot;

Initially the SNCC continued the focus on sit-ins and boycotts targeting establishments (restaurants, retail stores, theaters) and public amenities maintaining whites-only or segregated facilities. But it was to adopt a new tactic that helped galvanize the movement nationally. In February 1961, Diane Nash, Ruby Doris Smith, Charles Sherrod, and J. Charles Jones joined the Rock Hill, South Carolina sit-in protests and followed the example of the Friendship Nine in enduring an extended jail time rather than post bail. The &quot;Jail-no-Bail&quot; stand was seen as a moral refusal to accept, and to effectively subsidize, a corrupted constitution-defiant police and judicial system—while at the same time saving the movement money it did not have.

As way to &quot;dramatize that the church, the house of all people, fosters segregation more than any other institution,&quot; SNCC students also participated in &quot;kneel-ins&quot;—kneeling in prayer outside of Whites-only churches. Presbyterians churches, targeted because their &quot;ministers lacked the protection and support of a church hierarchy,&quot; were not long indifferent. In August 1960, the 172nd General Assembly of the United Presbyterian Church wrote to SNCC: &quot;Laws and customs requiring racial discrimination are, in our judgement, such serious violations of the law of God as to justify peaceful and orderly disobedience or disregard of these laws.&quot;

==1961 Freedom Rides==
Organized by the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) to dramatize the southern states&#x27; disregard of the Supreme Court rulings (&quot;Morgan v. Virginia&quot;, 1946 and &quot;Boynton v. Virginia&quot;, 1960) outlawing segregation in interstate transportation, in May 1961, the first Freedom Riders (seven black, six white, led by CORE director James Farmer) travelled together on interstate buses. In Anniston, Alabama, they were brutally attacked by mobs of Ku Klux Klansmen. Local police stood by. After they were assaulted again in Birmingham, Alabama, and under pressure from the Kennedy Administration, CORE announced it was discontinuing the action. Undeterred, Diane Nash called for new riders. Oretha Castle Haley, Jean C. Thompson, Rudy Lombard, James Bevel, Marion Barry, Angeline Butler, Stokely Carmichael, and Joan Trumpauer Mulholland joined John Lewis and Hank Thomas, the two young SNCC members of the original Ride. They traveled on to a savage beating in Montgomery, Alabama, to arrest in Jackson, Mississippi, and to confinement in the Maximum Security (Death Row) Unit of the infamous Mississippi State Penitentiary--&quot;Parchman Farm&quot;.

Recognizing SNCC&#x27;s determination, CORE and the SCLC rejected the Administration&#x27;s call for a &quot;cooling off&quot; period and joined with the students in a Freedom Riders Coordinating Committee to keep the Rides rolling through June and into September. During those months, more than 60 different Freedom Rides criss-crossed the South, most of them converging on Jackson, where every Rider was arrested, more than 300 in total. An unknown number were arrested in other Southern towns, and many were beaten including, in Monroe, North Carolina, SNCC&#x27;s Executive Secretary James Forman. It is estimated that almost 450 people, black and white in equal number, participated.

With CORE, SNCC had been making plans for a mass demonstration in Washington when Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy finally prevailed on the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to issue rules giving force to the repudiation of the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine. After the new ICC rules took effect on November 1, 1961, passengers were permitted to sit wherever they pleased on interstate buses and trains; &quot;white&quot; and &quot;colored&quot; signs were to be removed from the terminals (lunch counters, drinking fountains, toilets, and waiting rooms) serving interstate customers.

To test the ICC ruling and in the hope of mobilizing the local black community in a broader campaign, in October 1961 SNCC members Charles Sherrod and Cordell Reagon led a sit-in at the bus terminal in Albany, Georgia. By mid-December, having drawn in the NAACP and a number of other organizations, the Albany Movement had more than 500 protesters in jail. There they were joined briefly by Martin Luther King Jr. and by Ralph Abernathy. King sought advantage in the national media attention his arrest had drawn. In return for the city&#x27;s commitment to comply with the ICC ruling and to release those protesters willing to post bail, he agreed to leave town. The city reneged, however, so protests and subsequent arrests continued into 1962.

News reports across the country portrayed the Albany debacle as &quot;one of the most stunning defeats&quot; in King&#x27;s career. What they also reported was conflict with SNCC. The &quot;New York Times&quot; noted that King&#x27;s SCLC had taken steps &quot;that seemed to indicate they were assuming control&quot; of the movement in Albany, and that the student group had &quot;moved immediately to recapture its dominant position on the scene.&quot; If the differences between the organizations were not resolved, the paper predicted &quot;tragic consequences&quot;.

==1962 voter registration campaigns==
As a result of meetings brokered by the Kennedy Administration with large liberal foundations, the Voter Education Project (VEP) was formed in early 1962 to channel funds into voter drives in the eleven Southern states. Inducted by sit-in campaigns and hardened in the Freedom Rides, many student activists saw VEP as a government attempt to co-opt their movement. Lonnie C. King Jr., a student from Morehouse College in Atlanta, felt that &quot;by rechanneling its energies&quot; what the Kennedys were &quot;trying to do was kill the Movement.&quot; But others were already convinced that obtaining the right to vote was the key to unlocking political power for Black Americans. Older Black southerners had been pressing SNCC to move in this direction for some time. Mississippi NAACP leader Amzie Moore had tabled a voter registration drive at the SNCC&#x27;s second conference in October 1960.

A split over the priority to be accorded voter registration was avoided by Ella Baker&#x27;s intervention. She suggested that the organization create two distinct wings: one for direct action (which Diane Nash was to lead) and the other for voter registration. But the white violence visited in the summer of 1961 on the first registration efforts (under the direction of Bob Moses) in McComb, Mississippi, including the murder of activist Herbert Lee, persuaded many that in the Deep South voter registration was as direct a challenge to white supremacy as anything they had been doing before. &quot;If you went into Mississippi and talked about voter registration they&#x27;re going to hit you on the side of the head and that,&quot; Reggie Robinson, one of the SNCC&#x27;s first field secretaries, quipped is &quot;as direct as you can get.&quot;

In 1962, Bob Moses garnered further support for SNCC&#x27;s efforts by forging a coalition, the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO), with, among other groups, the NAACP and the National Council of Churches. With VEP and COFO funding SNCC was able to expand its voter registration efforts into the Mississippi Delta around Greenwood, Southwest Georgia around Albany, and the Alabama Black Belt around Selma. All of these projects endured police harassment and arrests; KKK violence including shootings, bombings, and assassinations; and economic sanctions against those blacks who dared to try to register.

== 1963 Washington and the Leesburg Stockade ==
===March on Washington===
Although it is an event largely remembered for King&#x27;s delivery of his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, SNCC had a significant role in the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. But it was at odds with the other sponsoring civil rights, labor, and religious organizations, all of whom were prepared to applaud the Kennedy Administration for its Civil Rights Bill (the Civil Rights Act of 1964).

In the version of his speech leaked to the press John Lewis remarked that those marching for jobs and freedom &quot;have nothing to be proud of, for hundreds and thousands of our brothers are not here—for they have no money for their transportation, for they are receiving starvation wages...or no wages at all.&quot; He went on to announce:
In good conscience, we cannot support the administration&#x27;s civil rights bill. This bill will not protect young children and old women from police dogs and fire hoses when engaging in peaceful demonstrations. This bill will not protect the citizens of Danville, Virginia who must live in constant fear in a police state. This bill will not protect the hundreds of people who have been arrested on trumped-up charges like those in Americus, Georgia, where four young men are in jail, facing a death penalty, for engaging in peaceful protest. I want to know, which side is the federal government on? The revolution is a serious one. Mr. Kennedy is trying to take the revolution out of the streets and put it in the courts. Listen Mr. Kennedy, the black masses are on the march for jobs and for freedom, and we must say to the politicians that there won&#x27;t be a &quot;cooling-off period&quot;.

Under pressure from the other groups, changes were made. &quot;We cannot support&quot; the 1963 Kennedy Civil Rights Bill was re-scripted as &quot;we support with reservations&quot;. In the view of the then SNCC executive secretary, James Forman, those who had pushed the change were selling out to the cautious liberal politics of labor-movement leadership and the Catholic and Protestant church hierarchy. &quot;If people had known they had come to Washington to aid the Kennedy administration, they would not have come in the numbers they did.&quot;

=== Sidelining of women ===
A feature of the march itself, was that men and women were directed to proceed separately and that only male speakers were scheduled to address the Lincoln Memorial rally. Together with Coretta Scott King and other the wives of civil leaders SNCC staffer and Ella Baker protégé Casey Hayden found herself walking up Independence Avenue while the media recorded the men marching down Constitution Avenue. 

Despite protesting behind the scenes with Anna Hedgeman (who was to go on to co-found the National Organization for Women), women were to be featured as singers, but not as speakers. In the event, a few women were allowed to sit on the Lincoln Memorial platform and the NAACP&#x27;s Daisy Bates, who had been instrumental in the integration of Little Rock Central High School, was permitted a brief tribute to &quot;Negro Women Fighters for Freedom&quot;. From their &quot;bitterly humiliating&quot; experience in Washington, Pauli Murray, who later coined the term &quot;Jane Crow&quot; to describe the double handicap of race and sex, concluded that black women &quot;can no longer postpone or subordinate the fight against discrimination because of sex to the civil rights struggle but must carry on both fights simultaneously.&quot;

=== Leesburg Stockade ===
The previous month, July 1963, SNCC was involved in another march that eventually made headlines. With the NAACP in Americus, Georgia, SNCC organized a protest march on a segregated movie theater that concluded with the arrest of upwards of 33 high-school girls. The &quot;Stolen Girls&quot; were imprisoned 45 days without charge in brutal conditions in the Lee County Public Works building, the Leesburg Stockade. It took SNCC photographer Danny Lyon smuggling himself into the Stockade to publicize the case nationally

==1964 Freedom Summer==
In the fall of 1963, with the assistance of 100 northern volunteers SNCC conducted the Freedom Ballot, a mock gubernatorial election in which over 80,000 black Mississippians demonstrated their willingness to exercise the constitutional right to vote that state law and violent intimidation had denied them since Reconstruction. (Only 6.7 per cent of the black voting age population of Mississippi was registered, compared to 70.2 per cent of the white voting age population). In coordination with CORE, the SNCC followed up on the ballot with the 1964 Mississippi Summer Project, also known as Freedom Summer. This brought over 700 white Northern students to the South, where they volunteered as teachers and organizers.

According to Julian Bond, their presence can be credited to freelance social activist Allard Lowenstein: white students, he had proposed, would not only &quot;provide needed manpower&quot;, &quot;their white skins might provoke interest from the news media that black skins could not produce.&quot; With the murder of two of their number, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, alongside local activist (Freedom Rider and voter educator) James Chaney, this indeed was to be the effect. Freedom Summer attracted international attention.

For SNCC the focus of summer project became the organization, through the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), of a parallel state Democratic Party primary. The MFDP would send an integrated slate of delegates to the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City and there contest the credentials of the all-white Mississippi regulars.

As part of this project SNCC&#x27;s Charlie Cobb proposed summer field schools. Encouraging youth &quot;to articulate their own desires, demands, and questions,&quot; the schools would help ensure a movement for social change in the state that would continue to be led by Mississippians. This was, he suggested, what organizing for voter registration was all about – &quot;challenging people in various ways to take control of their own lives.&quot; Over the course of Freedom Summer (and with assistance in developing the curriculum from, among others, Howard Zinn), COFO set up more than 40 Freedom Schools in African-American communities across Mississippi. More than 3,000 students attended, many of whom participated in registration efforts.

With the encouragement of SNCC field secretary Frank Smith, a meeting of cotton pickers at a Freedom School in Shaw, Mississippi, gave birth to the Mississippi Freedom Labor Union. At its peak, in the summer of 1965 the MFLU had 1,350 members and about 350 on strike.

On August 4, 1964, before the state MFDP convention, the bodies of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner were discovered buried in an earthen dam. Missing for weeks since disappearing after investigating a church burning in June 1964, they were subjects of a massive manhunt that involved the FBI and United States sailors from a nearby base. In the course of the search the corpses of several black Mississippians were uncovered whose disappearances had not previously attracted attention outside the Delta.

Notwithstanding the national outrage generated by the murders, the Johnson Administration was determined to deflect the MDFP effort. With the presidential election approaching the priority was to protect the Democrats&#x27; &quot;Solid South&quot; against inroads being made by Republican Barry Goldwater&#x27;s campaign and to minimise support for George Wallace&#x27;s third-party challenge. The MFDP nonetheless got to the National Democratic Convention in Atlantic City at the end of August.

The proceedings of the convention&#x27;s credentials committee were televised, giving a national and international audience to the testimony of SNCC field secretary Fannie Lou Hamer: to her portrayal of the brutalities of a sharecropper&#x27;s life, and of the obstruction and violence encountered by an African American in the exercise her constitutional rights. (Hamer still bore the marks of beatings meted to her, her father and other SNCC workers by police in Winona, Mississippi, just a year before). But with the all-white delegations of other southern states threatening to walk out, Johnson engineered a &quot;compromise&quot; in which the national Democratic Party offered the 68 MFDP delegates two at-large seats from where they could watch the floor proceedings but not take part. Fannie Lou Hamer led her delegates out of the convention: &quot;We didn&#x27;t come all this way for no two seats when all of us is tired.&quot;

Activists, Hayden suggests, were staggered to find the Democratic Party &quot;in the role of racist lunch counter owner&quot;: &quot;the core of SNCC&#x27;s work, voter registration, was [now] open to question.&quot; In the wake of Atlantic City, Elaine DeLott Baker recalls the desolation of project offices &quot;that had only recently been hives of activity and energy&quot; and the shutting down of Freedom Schools and community centers.

In September 1964, at a COFO conference in New York, Bob Moses had to see off two challenges to SNCC&#x27;s future role in Mississippi. First, he had to defend the SNCC&#x27;s anti-&quot;Red-baiting&quot; insistence on &quot;free association&quot;: the NAACP had threatened to pull out of COFO if SNCC continued to engage the services of the Communist Party associated National Lawyers Guild. Second, he had deflect a proposal from Lowenstein and Democratic Party operative Barney Frank that in a future summer program decision-making be removed from organizers in the field to a new office in New York City responsible directly to liberal-foundation and church funders. Dorothy Zellner (a white radical SNCC staffer) remarked that, &quot;What they [Lowenstein and Frank] want is to let the Negro into the existing society, not to change it.&quot;

==1965: Differences over &quot;structure&quot; and direction==
At the end of 1964, SNCC fielded the largest staff of any civil rights organization in the South. Yet to many the movement seemed to be at a loss.

In Mississippi Casey Hayden recalls everyone &quot;reeling from the violence&quot; (3 project workers killed; 4 people critically wounded; 80 beaten, 1,000 arrests; 35 shooting incidents, 37 churches bombed or burned; and 30 black businesses or homes burned), and also from &quot;the new racial imbalance&quot; following the summer influx of white student volunteers. The local black staff, &quot;the backbone&quot; of the projects were frustrated, even resentful, at having to deal &quot;with a lot of young white people who were intellectual and moneyed,&quot; &quot;ignorant&quot; of realities on the ground, and who, with their greater visibility, brought additional risks. But most of all SNCC activists were &quot;staggered&quot; by the debacle in Atlantic City. Being confronted by the Democratic Party &quot;in the role of racist lunch counter owner&quot; had thrown &quot;the core of SNCC&#x27;s work&quot;, voter registration, into question.

Notwithstanding passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 barring discrimination in public accommodations, employment and private education, and the equally broad Voting Rights Act of 1965, faith in the Johnson Administration and its liberal allies was ebbing, and a gulf had opened between SNCC and other civil rights organizations. In Atlantic City Fannie Lou Hamer confessed she &quot;lost hope in American society.&quot;

Questions of strategic direction were also questions of &quot;structure&quot;. What Stokely Carmichael described as &quot;not an organization but a lot of people all doing what they think needs to be done,&quot; was for Hayden the very realization of her mentor&#x27;s vision. Such was &quot;the participatory, town-hall, consensus-forming nature&quot; of the operation Ella Baker had helped set in motion that Hayden could feel herself to be &quot;at the center of the organization&quot; without having, &quot;in any public way&quot;, to be &quot;a leader&quot;.

Yet when Elaine DeLott Baker joined Hayden in Mississippi in May 1964 she found &quot;a hierarchy in place&quot;. Based &quot;on considerations of race, the amount of time spent in the struggle, dangers suffered, and finally, of gender,&quot; this was not a hierarchy office, but &quot;an unspoken understanding of who should speak up at meetings, who should propose ideas in public places, and who should remain silent.&quot; Black men were at the top, &quot;then black women, followed by white men, and at the bottom, white women.&quot; Field staff, among them &quot;women, black and white,&quot; still retained &quot;an enormous amount of operational freedom, they were indeed the ones that were keeping things moving.&quot; But from those leading the debate on new directions for the movement DeLott Baker saw &quot;little recognition of that reality,&quot; and the ground was shifting.The violence and emotional stresses of four years had eroded the focus and spirits of many veteran field staffers who appeared to central office staff as increasingly unpredictable and unreliable. Communication between core staff and field staff was poor and getting worse. To field staff, the Atlanta office was out of touch and becoming more and more irrelevant. Meanwhile, there were no central strategies. Resources were dwindling and tensions over the allocation of resources were mounting As an opportunity to take stock, to critique and reevaluate the movement, a retreat in Waveland, Mississippi, was organized for November 1964. Like Ella Baker, in criticizing King&#x27;s &quot;messianic&quot; leadership of the SCLC, Executive Secretary James Forman saw himself as championing popularly accountable, grassroots organization. Believing it &quot;would detract from, rather than intensify&quot; the focus on ordinary people&#x27;s involvement in the movement, he had not appreciated King&#x27;s appearance in Albany in December 1961. When on March 9, 1965, King, seemingly on his own authority, was able to turn the second Selma to Montgomery march back at the Edmund Pettus Bridge where two days before (&quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;) the first had been brutally charged and batoned, Forman was appalled. Yet within SNCC itself Forman increasingly was concerned by the lack of &quot;internal cohesion&quot;.

At Waveland Forman proposed that the staff (some twenty), who under the original constitution had had &quot;a voice but no vote,&quot; constitute &quot;themselves as the Coordinating Committee&quot; and elect a new Executive. It was time to recognize that SNCC no longer had a &quot;student base&quot; (with the move to voter registration, the original campus protest groups had largely evaporated) and that the staff, &quot;the people who do the most work,&quot; were the organization&#x27;s real &quot;nucleus&quot;. But the &quot;many problems and many strains within the organization&quot; caused by the &quot;freedom&quot; allowed to organizers in the field were also reason, he argued, to &quot;change and alter&quot; the structure of decision making. Given the &quot;external pressures&quot; the requirement now was for &quot;unity&quot;.

Bob Moses opposed. The role of SNCC was to stimulate social struggles, not to provide an institutionalized leadership. &quot;Leadership,&quot; Moses believed, &quot;will emerge from the movement that emerges.&quot; Leadership is there in the people. You don&#x27;t have to worry about where your leaders are, how are you going to get some leaders. ... If you go out and work with your people leadership will emerge. ... We don&#x27;t know who they are now: and we don&#x27;t need to know. 
&quot;To get us through the impasse,&quot; Casey Hayden tried to attach to Forman&#x27;s proposal various sub-committees and provisos to ensure that &quot;leadership for all our programs&quot; would continue to be driven from the field, and not from central office &quot;which makes many program areas responsible to one person rather than to all of us.&quot; For Forman this still suggested too loose, too confederal a structure for an organization whose challenge, without the manpower and publicity of white volunteers, was to mount and coordinate a Southwide Freedom Summer and &quot;build a Black Belt political party.&quot;

At her last Committee meeting in the fall of 1965, Hayden told both Forman and Chairman John Lewis that the &quot;imbalance of power within SNCC&quot; was such that, if the movement was to remain &quot;radically democratic&quot;, they would need to step down. Forman and Lewis did step down in their own time, in the spring, but with questions of structure and direction for the organization unresolved.

==1966: Black Power Movement==
===Carmichael and the Vine Street Project Statement===

In May 1966 Forman was replaced by Ruby Doris Smith-Robinson, who was determined &quot;to keep the SNCC together.&quot; But Forman recalls male leaders fighting &quot;her attempts as executive secretary to impose a sense of organizational responsibility and self-discipline,&quot; and &quot;trying to justify themselves by the fact that their critic was a woman&quot; In October 1967 Smith-Robinson died, aged just 25, &quot;of exhaustion&quot; according to one of her co-workers, &quot;destroyed by the movement.&quot;

Replacing John Lewis as chairman in May 1966 was the 24-year old Stokely Carmichael (the future Kwame Ture). When on the night of June 16, 1966, following protests at the shooting of solo freedom marcher James Meredith, Carmichael walked out of jail (his 27th arrest) and into Broad Street Park in Greenwood, Mississippi, he asked the waiting crowd &quot;What do you want?.&quot; They roared back &quot;Black Power! Black Power!&quot;

For Carmichael Black Power was a &quot;call for black people to define their own goals, to lead their own organizations.&quot;We have to organize ourselves to speak from a position of strength and stop begging people to look kindly upon us. We are going to build a movement in this country based on the color of our skins that is going to free us from our oppressors and we have to do that ourselves.
A new direction SNCC was evident in the Atlanta, Georgia, &quot;Vine City&quot; Project, SNCC&#x27;s first effort at urban organizing. Co-directed by William &quot;Bill&quot; Ware and Gwendolyn Zoharah Simmons (Robinson), it took up the challenge of the Georgia State Legislature&#x27;s refusal to seat Julian Bond because of SNCC opposition to the Vietnam War.

Ware, who had been greatly affected by his experience of newly independent Ghana, emphasized racial solidarity. Black people, he argued, needed to work &quot;without the guidance and/or direction and control of non-Blacks&quot;. Without control over their affairs, he warned, &quot;Black people will know no freedom, but only more subtle forms of slavery.&quot; A Vine Street Project position paper on Black Power, which Simmons helped write, suggested that: 
Negroes in this country have never been allowed to organize themselves because of white interference. As a result of this, the stereotype has been reinforced that Blacks cannot organize themselves. The white psychology that Blacks have to be watched, also reinforces this stereotype. Blacks, in fact, feel intimidated by the presence of whites, because of their knowledge of the power that whites have over their lives. One white person can come into a meeting of Black people and change the complexion of that meeting ... People would immediately start talking about &quot;brotherhood&quot;, &quot;love&quot;, etc.; race would not be discussed.

This was &quot;not to say that whites have not had an important role in the Movement.&quot; If people now had &quot;the right to picket, the right to give out leaflets, the right to vote, the right to demonstrate, the right to print,&quot; the Vine City paper allowed that it was &quot;mainly because of the entrance of white people into Mississippi, in the summer of &#x27;64.&quot; But their &quot;role is now over and it should be,&quot; for what would it mean &quot;if Black people, once having the right to organize, are not allowed to organize themselves? It means that Blacks&#x27; ideas about inferiority are being reinforced.&quot;

What was needed now for &quot;people to free themselves&quot; was an &quot;all-Black project&quot; and this had to &quot;exist from the beginning.&quot; Future cooperation with whites had to be a matter of &quot;coalition&quot;. But there could be &quot;no talk of &#x27;hooking up&#x27; unless Black people organize Blacks and white people organize whites.&quot; Those &quot;white people who desire change&quot; should go &quot;where the problem (of racism) is most manifest,&quot; in their own communities where power has been created &quot;for the express purpose of denying Blacks human dignity and self-determination.&quot;

Even without embracing an explicitly separatist agenda, many veteran project directors accepted the case that the presence of white organizers undermined black self-confidence. (Although overridden, on that basis Oretha Castle Haley already in 1962 had suspended whites from the CORE chapter in New Orleans). Julian Bond later reflected:
...the successes Freedom Summer achieved resulted from its embrace of a paradox — it tried to fight bigotry by appealing to people more concerned about whites, not blacks. Appealing to the nation&#x27;s racism accepted white supremacy. By acknowledging its dependence on whites to popularize the civil rights struggle in the South, SNCC contradicted its rhetorical belief in the equal worth of all races, and undermined its insistence that indigenous blacks were best prepared to lead the struggle for their deliverance from white dominance.
Yet like Forman (now urging the study of Marxism), Carmichael hesitated to accept the implication that whites should be excluded from the movement. It was in December that he led the SNCC national executive in a narrow decision (19 in favor, 18 against and 24 abstentions) to ask white co-workers and volunteers to leave. In May 1967 the Coordinating Committee formally asked its non-black staff to resign. Whites should concentrate on organizing poor white communities and leave SNCC to promote African-American self-reliance.

===Lowndes County===
Carmichael had been working with a voter registration project in Alabama that had taken what, at the time, may have seemed an equally momentous step. In the face of murderous Klan violence, organizers for the Lowndes County Freedom Organization openly carried arms. Participating in the Selma to Montgomery march, Carmichael had stopped off in the county in March 1965. Local registration efforts were being led by John Hulett who that month, with John C. Lawson, a preacher, became the first two black voters in Lowndes County in more than six decades.

Carmichael gained the confidence of local residents when, handing out voter registration material at a local school, he refused to be intimidated by local police: they were either to arrest him or leave. With SNCC workers then &quot;swarmed&quot; by young people, Carmichael took the initiative to help form the LCFO with Hulett, its first chair. The organization would not only register voters but, as a party, run candidates for office—its symbol, a rampant black panther, representing black &quot;strength and dignity&quot;.

Hulett warned the state of Alabama that it had a last chance to peacefully grant African Americans their rights: &quot;We&#x27;re out to take power legally, but if we&#x27;re stopped by the government from doing it legally, we&#x27;re going to take it the way everyone else took it, including the way the Americans took it in the American Revolution.&quot; Certain the federal government was not going to protect him and his fellow LCFO members, Hulett told a federal registrar, &quot;if one of our candidates gets touched, we&#x27;re going to take care of the murderer ourselves.&quot;

===Interracial coalition===
While other white SNCC activists in the Broad Street Park, Greenwood, crowd that affirmed Carmichael&#x27;s call for Black Power were bewildered, Peggy Terry recalls &quot;there was never any rift in my mind or my heart. I just felt Black people were doing what they should be doing. We reached a period in the civil rights movement when Black people felt they weren&#x27;t being given the respect they should have, and I agreed. White liberals ran everything.&quot; The message to white activists, &quot;organize your own&quot;, was one that Terry took home with her to uptown, &quot;Hillbilly Harlem&quot;, Chicago. This was the neighborhood in which, having taken the prompt the year before, Casey Hayden had already been working, organizing welfare mothers into a union. She was &quot;on loan&quot; from SNCC to Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). Like other new left groups, SDS did not view a self-consciously black SNCC as separatist. Rather it was seen as the vanguard of a prospective &quot;interracial movement of the poor&quot;. Accepting the Vine Street challenge, the goal was no longer integration but what Chicago Black Panther leader Fred Hampton was to project as the &quot;rainbow coalition&quot;.

In the South, as SNCC began turning them away white volunteers moved over to the New Orleans–based Southern Conference Education Fund with which Ella Baker had been working since the 1950s. There, in effort to advance a coalition agenda, they joined Bob Zellner, the SNCC&#x27;s first white field organizer and son of a former Klansman, in working with Carl and Anne Braden to organize white students and poor whites.

===Opposition to the Vietnam War===
The Meredith shooting in June 1966 had been preceded in January by the killing of Sammy Younge Jr., the first black college student to be killed as a result of his involvement in the civil rights movement, and by the acquittal of his killer. SNCC took the occasion to denounce the Vietnam War, the first statement of its kind by a major civil rights organization.

&quot;The murder of Samuel Young in Tuskegee, Alabama,&quot; SNCC proposed, &quot;is no different than the murder of peasants in Vietnam, for both Young and the Vietnamese sought, and are seeking, to secure the rights guaranteed them by law. In each case, the United States government bears a great part of the responsibility for these deaths.&quot; In the face of a government that &quot;has never guaranteed the freedom of oppressed citizens, and is not yet truly determined to end the rule of terror and oppression within its own borders,&quot; where,&quot; it asked, &quot;is the draft for the freedom fight in the United States.&quot; It could longer countenance the &quot;hypocrisy&quot; of a call upon &quot;negroes ... to stifle the liberation of Vietnam, to preserve a &#x27;democracy&#x27; which does not exist for them at home.&quot;

At an SDS-organized conference at UC Berkeley in October 1966, Carmichael challenged the white left to escalate their resistance to the military draft in a manner similar to the black movement. Some participants in the August 1965 Watts Uprising and in the ghetto rebellions that followed had already associated their actions with opposition to the Vietnam War, and SNCC had first disrupted an Atlanta draft board in August 1966. According to historians Joshua Bloom and Waldo Martin, SDS&#x27;s first Stop the Draft Week of October 1967 was &quot;inspired by Black Power [and] emboldened by the ghetto rebellions.&quot; SNCC appear to have originated the popular anti-draft slogan: &quot;Hell no! We won&#x27;t go!&quot;

==1967–1968: Northern strategy and the split with Carmichael and the Panthers==
By early 1967, SNCC was approaching bankruptcy. The call for Black Power and the departure of white activists did not go down well with the liberal foundations and churches in the North. This was at a time when SNCC organizers were themselves heading North to the &quot;ghettoes&quot; where, as the urban riots of the mid-1960s had demonstrated, victories at lunch counters and ballot boxes in the South counted for little. Julian Bond recounts projects being:...established in Washington, D.C., to fight for home rule; in Columbus, Ohio, where a community foundation was organized; in New York City&#x27;s Harlem, where SNCC workers organized early efforts at community control of public schools; in Los Angeles, where SNCC helped monitor local police and joined an effort at creating a &#x27;Freedom City&#x27; in black neighborhoods; and in Chicago, where SNCC workers began to build an independent political party and demonstrated against segregated schools.As part of this northern community-organizing strategy, SNCC seriously considered an alliance with Saul Alinsky&#x27;s mainstream-church supported Industrial Areas Foundation. But Alinsky had little patience or understanding for SNCC&#x27;s new rhetoric. On stage with Carmichael in Detroit, Alinsky was scathing when, pressed for an example of &quot;Black Power&quot;, the SNCC leader cited the IAF&#x27;s-mentored FIGHT community organization in Rochester, New York. The example was proof that Carmichael and his friends needed to stop &quot;going round yelling &#x27;Black Power!&#x27;&quot; and &quot;really go down and organize.&quot; It is simple, according to Alinsky: it&#x27;s &quot;called...community power, and if the community is black, it&#x27;s black power.&quot;

In May 1967, Carmichael relinquished the SNCC chairmanship and speaking out against U.S. policy traveled to Cuba, China, North Vietnam, and finally to Ahmed Sékou Touré&#x27;s Guinea. Returning to the United States in January 1968 he accepted an invitation to become honorary Prime Minister of the Black Panther Party for Self Defense. Inspired by John Hulet&#x27;s stand and borrowing the LCFO&#x27;s black panther moniker, the party had been formed by Bobby Seale and Huey Newton in Oakland, California, in October 1966. For Carmichael the goal was a nation-wide Black United Front.

Carmichael&#x27;s replacement, H. Rap Brown (later known as Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin) tried to hold what he now called the Student &quot;National&quot; Coordinating Committee to an alliance with the Panthers. Like Carmichael, Rap Brown had come to view nonviolence as a tactic rather than as a foundational principle. Violence, he famously quipped, was &quot;as American as cherry pie&quot;.

In June 1968 the SNCC national executive emphatically rejected the association with the Black Panthers. This was followed in July by a &quot;violent confrontation&quot; in New York City with James Forman, who had resigned as the Panther&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs and was then heading up the city&#x27;s SNCC operation. In the course of a &quot;heated discussion&quot; Panthers accompanying Carmichael and Eldridge Cleaver, the Panthers&#x27; Minister of Information, reportedly thrust a pistol was into Forman&#x27;s mouth. For Forman and SNCC this was &quot;the last straw&quot;. Carmichael was expelled (&quot;engaging in a power struggle&quot; that &quot;threatened the existence of the organization&quot;)—and &quot;Forman wound up first in hospital, and later in Puerto Rico, suffering from a nervous breakdown&quot;.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that it was the &quot;opinion of most people in the movement&quot; that the SNCC Carmichael had left was &quot;pre-Watts&quot;, while the Panthers were &quot;post-Watts&quot;. The 1965 Watts riots in Los Angeles, they believed, had marked &quot;the end of the middle-class-oriented civil right movement&quot;.

Rap Brown himself resigned as SNCC chairman after being indicted for inciting to riot in Cambridge, Maryland, in 1967. On March 9, 1970, two SNCC workers, Ralph Featherstone and William (&quot;Che&quot;) Payne, died on a road approaching Bel Air, Maryland, when a bomb on the front floorboard of their car exploded. The bomb&#x27;s origin is disputed: some say the bomb was planted in an assassination attempt, and others say Payne was intentionally carrying it to the courthouse where Brown was to be tried.

==1969–1970: Dissolution==

Ella Baker said that &quot;SNCC came North at a time when the North was in a ferment that led to various interpretations on what was needed to be done. With its own frustrations, it could not take the pace-setter role it took in the South.&quot;

These &quot;frustrations&quot; may in part have been fed by undercover agents. Like other potentially &quot;subversive&quot; groups, SNCC had become a target of the Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s general COINTELPRO directive was for agents to &quot;expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize&quot; the activities and leadership of the movements they infiltrated.

By the beginning of 1970, surveillance had everywhere effectively ceased for lack of SNCC activity—save in New York City from where the last FBI report was filed in December 1973.

Experienced organizers and staff had moved on. For many the years of &quot;hard work at irregular, subsistence-level pay, in an atmosphere of constant tension&quot; had been as much as they could bear. Some went over to the Black Panthers. Others were to follow Forman into the Black Economic Development Council (whose key demand was reparations for the nation&#x27;s history of racial exploitation). A greater loss had been to the Democrats (it was after merging with the Alabama Democratic Party in 1970 that LCFO candidates began winning public offices, Hulett becoming county Sheriff) and to Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s War on Poverty. Charlie Cobb recalls: After we got the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and Voting Rights Act in 1965, a lot of groups that we had cultivated were absorbed into the Democratic Party ... a lot more money came into the states we were working in. A lot of the people we were working with became a part of Head Start and various kinds of poverty programs. We were too young to really know how to respond effectively. How could we tell poor sharecroppers or maids making a few dollars a day to walk away from poverty program salaries or stipends?

As their numbers diminished, SNCC veteran Clayborne Carson found staff cultivating the skills for &quot;organizational infighting&quot; rather than &quot;those that had enabled SNCC to inspire thousands of people outside the group during its years of greatest influence.&quot; Attempting to gain the trust of beleaguered communities, &quot;develop indigenous leadership, and build strong local institutions,&quot; was no longer regarded as sufficiently &quot;revolutionary&quot;.

The judgement of Charles McDew, SNCC&#x27;s second chairman (1961–1963), is that the organization was not designed to last beyond its mission of winning civil rights for blacks, and that at the founding meetings most participants expected it to last no more than five years: 
First, we felt if we go more than five years without the understanding that the organization would be disbanded, we run the risk of becoming institutionalized or being more concerned with trying to perpetuate the organization and in doing so, giving up the freedom to act and to do. ... The other thing is that by the end of that time you&#x27;d either be dead or crazy …

By the time of its dissolution, many of the controversial ideas that once had defined SNCC&#x27;s radicalism had become widely accepted among African Americans:

==Women in the SNCC==
In impressing upon the young student activists the principle &quot;those who do the work, make the decisions,&quot; Ella Baker had hoped the SNCC would avoid the SCLC&#x27;s reproduction of the organization and experience of the church: women form the working body and men assume the headship. In SNCC black women did emerge as among the movement&#x27;s most dynamic and courageous organizers and thinkers.

In addition to Diane Nash, Ruby Doris Smith Robinson, Fannie Lou Hamer, Oretha Castle Haley, and others already mentioned, these women included Tuskegee student-body president, Gwen Patton; Mississippi Delta field secretary, Cynthia Washington; Sammy Younge&#x27;s teacher, Jean Wiley; head of COFO&#x27;s Mississippi operations, Muriel Tillinghast; Natchez, Mississippi, project director Dorie Ladner, and her sister Joyce who, in the violence of Mississippi (and having worked with Medgar Evers), regarded their own arrests as &quot;about the least harmful thing&quot; that could occur; Annie Pearl Avery, who when organizing in Natchez carried a gun; MDFP state-senate candidate Victoria Gray; MFDP delegate Unita Blackwell; leader of the Cambridge Movement Gloria Richardson; Bernice Reagon of the Albany Movement&#x27;s Freedom Singers; womanist theologian Prathia Hall; LCFO veteran and &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; associate producer Judy Richardson; Ruby Sales, for whom Jonathan Daniels took a fatal shot-gun blast in Hayneville, Alabama; Fay Bellamy, who ran the Selma, Alabama office; the singer Bettie Mae Fikes (&quot;the Voice of Selma&quot;); playwright Endesha Ida Mae Holland; Eleanor Holmes Norton, first chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; and sharecroppers&#x27; daughter and author (&quot;Coming of Age in Mississippi&quot;) Anne Moody.

Anne Moody recalls it was the women did the work: young black women college students and teachers were the mainstay of voter registration and of the summer Freedom Schools. Women were also the expectation when looking for local leadership. &quot;There was always a &#x27;mama&#x27;,&quot; one SNCC activist recalled,&quot;usually a militant woman in the community, outspoken, understanding and willing to catch hell.&quot;

From the outset white students, veterans of college-town sit-ins, had been active in the movement. Among them were Ella Baker&#x27;s YWCA proteges Casey Hayden and Mary King. As a Southerner (as were the other white women first drawn to SNCC), Hayden regarded the &quot;Freedom Movement Against Segregation&quot; as much hers as &quot;anyone else&#x27;s&quot;—&quot;It was my freedom.&quot; But when working full-time in the black community, she was nonetheless conscious of being &quot;a guest.&quot; (For this reason it was important to Hayden that an opportunity in 1963 to work alongside Doris Derby in starting a literacy project at Tougaloo College, Mississippi, had come to her &quot;specifically&quot; because she had the educational qualifications). Having dropped out of Duke University, Freedom Rider Joan Trumpauer Mulholland graduated from Tougaloo, the first white student to do so. The majority of white women drawn to the movement, however, would have been those from the north who responded to the call for volunteers to help register black voters in Mississippi during the summer of 1964. Among the few that might have had obvious qualifications was Susan Brownmiller, then a journalist. She had worked on a voter registration drive in East Harlem and organized with CORE.

===&quot;Sex and Caste&quot;===
Among the Position Papers circulated at Waveland conference in 1964, number 24 (&quot;name withheld by request&quot;) opened with the observation that the &quot;large committee&quot; formed to present &quot;crucial constitutional revisions&quot; to the staff &quot;was all men.&quot; After cataloguing a number of other instances in which women appear to have been sidelined, it went on to suggest that &quot;assumptions of male superiority are as widespread and deep rooted and every much as crippling to the woman as the assumptions of white supremacy are to the Negro.&quot;

This paper was not the first time women had raised questions about their roles in SNCC. In the spring of 1964, a group of black and white SNCC staffers had sat-in at James Forman&#x27;s office in Atlanta to protest at being burdened, and stymied in their contributions, by the assumption that it was they, the women, who would see to minute taking and other mundane office, and housekeeping, tasks: &quot;No More Minutes Until Freedom Comes to the Atlanta Office&quot; was Ruby Doris Smith-Robinson&#x27;s placard. Like Mary King, Judy Richardson recalls the protest as being &quot;half playful (Forman actually appearing supportive), although &quot;the other thing was, we&#x27;re not going to do this anymore.&quot; The same might be said of the Waveland paper itself. With so many women themselves &quot;insensitive&quot; to the &quot;day-to-day discriminations&quot; (who is asked to take minutes, who gets to clean Freedom House), the paper concluded that, &quot;amidst the laughter,&quot; further discussion might be the best that could be hoped for.

At the time, and in &quot;the Waveland setting,&quot; Casey Hayden, who with Mary King was soon outed as one of the authors, regarded the paper as &quot;definitely an aside&quot;. But in the course of 1965, while working on leave for the SDS organizing women in Chicago, Hayden was to reconsider. Seeking to further &quot;dialogue within the movement,&quot; Hayden circulated an extended version of the &quot;memo&quot; among 29 SNCC women veterans and, with King, had it published in the War Resisters League magazine &quot;Liberation&quot; under the title &quot;Sex and Caste&quot;. Employing the movement&#x27;s own rhetoric of race relations, the article suggested that, like African Americans, women can find themselves &quot;caught up in a common-law caste system that operates, sometimes subtly, forcing them to work around or outside hierarchical structures of power.&quot; Viewed as a bridge between civil rights and women&#x27;s liberation, &quot;Sex and Caste&quot; has since been regarded as a &quot;key text of second-wave feminism.&quot;

===Black Women&#x27;s Liberation===
The two other women subsequently identified as having direct authorship of the original position paper on women (which has sometimes been mistakenly attributed to Ruby Doris Smith-Robinson), Elaine Delott Baker and Emmie Schrader Adams, were also white. This, it has been suggested, was the reflection of a movement culture that gave Black women greater opportunity &quot;to protest directly&quot;. That white women chose an anonymous paper was testimony, in effect, to the &quot;unspoken understanding of who should speak up at meetings&quot; that Delott Baker had identified when she joined Hayden in Mississippi in 1964. But many black women were to dispute the degree and significance of male-domination within the SNCC, denying that it had excluded them from leadership roles. Joyce Ladner&#x27;s recollection of organizing Freedom Summer is of &quot;women&#x27;s full participation,&quot; and Jean Wheeler Smith&#x27;s of doing in SNCC &quot;anything I was big enough to do.&quot;

Historian Barbara Ransby dismisses, in particular, the suggestion that in its concluding Black Power period SNCC diminished the profile of women within the movement. She points out that Stokely Carmichael appointed several women to posts as project directors during his tenure as chairman, and that in the latter half of the 1960s, more women were in charge of SNCC projects than during the early years. On the other hand, Hayden, in the position paper she presented under her own name at Waveland, &quot;On Structure&quot;, had seen herself defending Ella Baker&#x27;s original participatory vision in which women&#x27;s voices are heard precisely because decision making is not dependent on formal rank position but rather on actual work and commitment, and a movement culture that she recalls as &quot;womanist, nurturing, and familial.&quot;

Frances M. Beal (who worked with SNCC&#x27;s International Affairs Commission and its National Black Antiwar Antidraft Union) is in no doubt that as the SNCC moved away from &quot;sustained community organizing toward Black Power propagandizing that was accompanied by increasing male dominance.&quot; (Beal and others objected to the James Forman&#x27;s initial enthusiasm for the Black Panther Party, judging Eldridge Cleaver&#x27;s &quot;Soul on Ice&quot;, which he brought back to the office, to be the work of a &quot;thug&quot; and a rapist). &quot;You&#x27;re talking about liberation and freedom half the night on the racial side,&quot; she recalls of her time in the SNCC, &quot;and then all of a sudden men are going to turn around and start talking about putting you in your place. So in 1968 we founded the SNCC Black Women&#x27;s Liberation Committee to take up some of these issues.&quot;

With the SNCC&#x27;s breakup, the Black Women&#x27;s Liberation Committee became first the Black Women&#x27;s Alliance and then, following an approach by revolutionary Puerto-Rican women activists, the Third World Women&#x27;s Alliance in 1970. Active for another decade, the TWWA was one of the earliest groups advocating an intersectional approach to women&#x27;s oppression—&quot;the triple oppression of race, class and gender.&quot;

Gwendolyn Delores Robinson/Zoharah Simmons, who co-authored the Vine Street Project paper on Black Power, was struck by the contrast between the SNCC and her subsequent experience of the Nation of Islam: &quot;there was really no place for a woman to exercise what I considered real leadership as it had been in SNCC.&quot; Breaking with the NOI&#x27;s strict gendered hierarchy, she went on to identify, teach and write as an &quot;Islamic feminist&quot;.

On top of seeking to increase African-American access to land through a pioneer Freedom Farm Cooperative, in 1971 Fannie Lou Hamer co-founded the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus. She emphasized the power women might have acting as a voting majority in the country regardless of race or ethnicity: &quot;A white mother is no different from a black mother. The only thing is they haven&#x27;t had as many problems. But we cry the same tears.&quot; The NWPC continues to recruit, train and support &quot;women candidates for elected and appointed offices at all levels of government&quot; who are &quot;pro-choice&quot; and who support a federal Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the U.S. Constitution.

<text>Khun Borom (, ) or Khoun Bourôm (, ) is a legendary progenitor of the Southwestern Tai-speaking peoples, 

==Mythology==
According to the myth of Khoun Borôm, a myth commonly related among Tai-speaking peoples, in ancient times people were wicked and crude. A great deity destroyed them with a flood, leaving only three worthy chiefs who were preserved in heaven to be the founders and guides for a new race of people. The deity sent the three chiefs back to the earth with a buffalo to help them till the land.

The chiefs and the buffalo arrived in the legendary land of Muang Then, located at today&#x27;s Điện Biên Phủ, Vietnam. Once the land had been prepared for rice cultivation, the buffalo died and a bitter gourd vine grew from his nostril. From the gourds on the vine, the new human race emerged. Relatively dark-skinned aboriginal peoples emerging from gourds cut open with a hot skewer and the lighter skinned Tai peoples emerging from cuts made with a chisel.

The gods then taught the Tai peoples how to build houses and cultivate rice. They were instructed in proper rituals and behavior, and grew prosperous. As their population grew, they needed aid in governing their relations and resolving disputes. Phagna Thèn, the king of the gods, sent his son, Khoun Borôm, to be the ruler of the Tai people. Khoun Borôm ruled the Tai people for 25 years, teaching them to use new tools and other arts.

After this quarter-century span, Khoun Borôm divided the kingdom among his seven sons, giving each one of them a portion of the kingdom to rule.

==Alleged association with Nanzhao==
Khoun Borôm is sometimes erroneously identified, apparently without any evidence at all, as having been Piluoge, a historical ruler of the Nanzhao (Ai Lao) Empire. It is claimed that this Khoun Borôm, ruler of Nanzhao, had nine sons, and seven of them became kings in different kingdoms in &quot;Lèmthong&quot;:

# &quot;Khoun Lo&quot; ruled Muang Sua (Xoua), (Luang Phrabang, Laos) 
# &quot;Khoun Phalan&quot; ruled Muang Sipsong Phanna, (Yunnan, China)
# &quot;Khoun Chulông&quot; ruled Muang KôtThèPhènpôm, (Muang Houaphanh to Tonkin, Vietnam) 
# &quot;Khoun Khamphông&quot; ruled Muang Yônôk Lanna (Thailand)
# &quot;Khoun In&quot; ruled Muang Sri Ayôthaya, (Thailand) 
# &quot;Khoun Kôm&quot; ruled Muang Hôngsavadi (Intharapat), (Burma) 
# &quot;Khoun Chuang&quot; ruled Muang Phuan, (Xieng Khouang, Laos).

There were 19 kings after Khoun Lo who ruled Muang Swa. The last one was Khoun Vang, who was then succeeded by:

* Lang, who became King Langthirath
* Thao Khamphong, crowned as King Souvanna Khamphong
* Chao Fifah, also known as Khamhiao, who had six sons
* Chao Fa Ngum, who founded the Lan Xang Kingdom during the 14th century.

Both King Mangrai of Chiang Mai and Uthong of Ayutthaya are said to have been descendants of Khum Borom&#x27;s younger sons.

==Interpretation==
Some interpreters of the story of Khoun Borôm believe that it describes Tai-speaking peoples arriving in Southeast Asia from China (mythically identified with heaven, from which the Tai chiefs emerge after the flood). The system of dividing and expanding a kingdom in order to provide for the sons of a ruler agrees in general with the apparent organization and succession practices of ancient Tai village groups was called &quot;mueang&quot;.

Scholar David K. Wyatt believes that the Khoun Borôm myth may provide insight into the early history of the Tai people in Southeast Asia. Versions of the Khoun Borôm myth occur as early as 698 CE in Xiang Khouang, and identify Tai-speaking kingdoms that would be formally established years later. This may indicate the early geographical spread of Tai-speaking peoples, and provides a mythological explanation for why modern Tai-speaking peoples are found in such widespread pockets.

Linguistic analysis indicates that the division of the early Tai speakers into the language groups that gave rise to modern Thai, Lao and other languages occurred sometime between the 7th and 11th centuries CE. This split proceeded along geographic lines very similar to the division given in the Khoun Borôm legend.

<doc id="203906" wikidata="Q1572774" url="?curid=203906" title="Unicode Consortium">
<text>The Unicode Consortium (legally Unicode, Inc.) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization incorporated and based in Mountain View, California, U.S. Its primary purpose is to maintain and publish the Unicode Standard which was developed with the intention of replacing existing character encoding schemes that are limited in size and scope, and are incompatible with multilingual environments. 

The consortium describes its overall purpose as: 

Unicode&#x27;s success at unifying character sets has led to its widespread adoption in the internationalization and localization of software. The standard has been implemented in many technologies, including XML, the Java programming language, Swift, and modern operating systems.

Members are usually but not limited to computer software and hardware companies with an interest in text-processing standards, including Adobe, Apple, the Bangladesh Computer Council, Emojipedia, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft, the Omani Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs, Monotype Imaging, Netflix, Salesforce, SAP SE, Tamil Virtual Academy, and the University of California, Berkeley. Technical decisions relating to the Unicode Standard are made by the Unicode Technical Committee (UTC).

== Founding ==

The project to develop a universal character encoding scheme called Unicode was initiated in 1987 by Joe Becker, Lee Collins, and Mark Davis. The Unicode Consortium was incorporated in California on January 3, 1991, with the stated aim to develop, extend, and promote the use of the Unicode Standard. Mark Davis was the president of the Unicode Consortium from when the Consortium was incorporated in 1991 until 2023, when he changed roles to CTO.

== Work ==

The Unicode Consortium cooperates with many standards development organizations, including ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2 and W3C. While Unicode is often considered equivalent to ISO/IEC 10646, and the character sets are essentially identical, the Unicode standard imposes additional restrictions on implementations that ISO/IEC 10646 does not. Apart from &quot;The Unicode Standard&quot; (TUS) and its annexes (UAX), the Unicode Consortium also maintains the CLDR, collaborated with the IETF on IDNA, and publishes related standards (UTS), reports (UTR), and utilities.

The group selects the emoji icons used by the world&#x27;s smartphones, based on submissions from individuals and organizations who present their case with evidence for why each one is needed.

=== Unicode Technical Committee ===
The Unicode Technical Committee (UTC) meets quarterly to decide whether new characters will be encoded. A quorum of half of the Consortium&#x27;s full members is required.

As of May 2024, there are nine full members: Adobe, Airbnb, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, Salesforce and Translated.

The UTC accepts documents from any organization or individual, whether they are members of the Unicode Consortium or not. The UTC holds its meetings behind closed doors. As of July 2020, the UTC rules on both emoji and script proposals at the same meeting.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic&#x27;s effect on travel, the meetings, which used to be hosted on by various companies for free, were in 2020 held online via Zoom, although the discussions remain confidential.

The UTC prefers to work by consensus, but on particularly contentious issues, votes may be necessary. After it meets, the UTC releases a public statement on each proposal it considered. Due to the volume of proposals, various subcommittees, such as the Script Ad Hoc Group and Emoji Subcommittee, exist to submit recommendations to the full UTC &quot;en banc&quot;. The UTC is under no obligation to heed these recommendations, although in practice it usually does.

== Publications ==

The Unicode Consortium maintains a History of Unicode Release and Publication Dates.

<doc id="203908" wikidata="Q1125901" url="?curid=203908" title="Congress of Racial Equality">
<text>The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) is an African-American civil rights organization in the United States that played a pivotal role for African Americans in the civil rights movement. Founded in 1942, its stated mission is &quot;to bring about equality for all people regardless of race, creed, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, religion or ethnic background.&quot; To combat discriminatory policies regarding interstate travel, CORE participated in Freedom Rides as college students boarded Greyhound Buses headed for the Deep South. As the influence of the organization grew, so did the number of chapters, eventually expanding all over the country. Despite CORE remaining an active part of the fight for change, some people have noted the lack of organization and functional leadership has led to a decline of participation in social justice.

== History ==

===Founding===

CORE was founded in Chicago, Illinois, in March 1942. The organization&#x27;s founding members included James Leonard Farmer Jr., Anna Pauline &quot;Pauli&quot; Murray, George Mills Houser, Elsie Bernice Fisher, Homer A. Jack, and James R Robinson. Of the 50 original founding members, 28 were men and 22 were women, roughly one-third of them were Black, and the other two-thirds white. Bayard Rustin, while not a founding member of the organization, was, as Farmer and Houser later noted, &quot;an uncle to CORE&quot; and provided it with significant support. The group had evolved out of the pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation, and sought to apply the principles of nonviolence as a tactic against racial segregation.

The group was inspired by Indian nationalist leader Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s support for nonviolent resistance. Indian writer and journalist Krishnalal Shridharani, who was known as a vibrant and theatrical public speaker, had been a protege of Gandhi—being jailed with him in the Salt March—and whose 1939 book &quot;War Without Violence&quot; heavily influenced the organization. During the period in which CORE was founded, Gandhi&#x27;s leadership of the independence movement in India against British colonial rule was reaching its apogee. CORE sought to apply the nonviolent anti-colonial tactics pioneered by Gandhi and his followers to successfully challenge racial segregation and racism in the United States through civil disobedience.
In accordance with CORE&#x27;s constitution and bylaws, in the early and mid-1960s, chapters were organized on a model similar to that of a democratic trade union, with monthly membership meetings, elected and usually unpaid officers, and numerous committees of volunteers. In the South, CORE&#x27;s nonviolent direct action campaigns opposed &quot;Jim Crow&quot; segregation and job discrimination, and fought for voting rights. Outside the South, CORE focused on discrimination in employment and housing, and also in de facto school segregation. &quot;Jim Crow&quot; laws are laws that enforce racial segregation and discrimination in the United States.

Some of CORE&#x27;s main leadership had strong disagreements with the Deacons for Defense and Justice over the Deacons&#x27; public threat to racist Southerners that they would use armed self-defense to protect CORE workers from racist organizations, such as the Ku Klux Klan, in Louisiana during the 1960s. Others strongly supported the organization. By the mid-1960s, Farmer tried to incorporate elements of the emerging black nationalist sentiments within CORE—sentiments that, among other things, would quickly lead to an embrace of Black Power. Farmer failed to reconcile these tensions, and he resigned in 1966, but he backed his replacement, Floyd McKissick.

By 1961 CORE had 53 chapters throughout the United States. By 1963, most of the major urban centers of the Northeast, Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, and West Coast had one or more CORE chapters, including a growing number of chapters on college campuses. In the South, CORE had active chapters and projects in Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, South Carolina, and Kentucky.

=== Irene Morgan ===
In 1944, Irene Morgan, an African American woman, was arrested for refusing to move from the front &quot;white&quot; seating section to the back &quot;colored&quot; seating section of a Greyhound interstate bus while traveling from Virginia to Maryland. After the Virginia state court upheld her conviction and arrest, Morgan&#x27;s case was brought before the Supreme Court with &quot;Morgan v. Virginia&quot; on June 3, 1946.

==== &quot;Morgan v. Virginia&quot; ====
Initially, Morgan&#x27;s legal team only included Spottswood Robinson III, but they were later joined by NAACP lawyers Thurgood Marshall and William H. Hastie. They used the Interstate Commerce Clause in the Constitution, which declared that states could not impose rules that interfered with passengers crossing state lines, as the prevailing tactic to argue her case. However, Virginia state courts did not find this argument convincing.

Contrarily, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Irene and asserted that the Virginia Legislature could not impose segregation among interstate bus travelers. This landmark ruling would go on to inspire CORE members to seek out non-violent ways to push back against segregation outside of the court system.

===Freedom Rides===
==== Journey of Reconciliation ====
On April 10, 1947, CORE sent a group of eight white men, including James Peck, their publicity officer, and eight black men, on what was to be a two-week Journey of Reconciliation through Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky, to test state’s compliance with the Supreme Court’s decisions regarding segregation within interstate travel.

The group was composed of men only, to get around certain laws of the time that restricted the mixing of males and females. These participants then underwent rigorous training aimed at equipping them with the necessary skills to react non-violently, even in the face of violent behaviors. They would act out intense role-playing exercises to simulate real-life scenarios they may encounter, in an attempt to improve their resolve in the face of violence. Throughout the two-week period, they completed twenty-six demonstrations on buses or trains. Out of these twenty-six demonstrations, six resulted in arrests. The members of this group received a great deal of publicity, and this marked the beginning of a long series of similar campaigns.

==== The First &quot;Freedom Ride&quot; ====
In the early 1960&#x27;s, James Farmer resumed his position as executive secretary of CORE, with the objective of replicating the 1947 Journey of Reconciliation, only this time under a new name - the Freedom Ride. 

On May 4, 1961, male and female participants started their journey through the deep South, testing segregated bus terminals as well. The riders were met with severe violence. In Anniston, Alabama, one of the buses was fire-bombed and passengers were beaten by a white mob. White mobs also attacked Freedom Riders in Birmingham and Montgomery. The violence garnered national attention, sparking a summer of similar rides by CORE, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and other civil rights organizations and thousands of ordinary citizens.

===Desegregating Chicago&#x27;s schools===

In the 1960s, the Chicago chapter of CORE began to challenge racial segregation in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS), addressing disparities in educational opportunities for African American students. By the late 1950s, the Chicago Board of Education&#x27;s maintenance of the neighborhood school policy resulted in a pattern of racial segregation in the CPS. Predominantly black schools were situated in predominantly black neighborhoods on the south and west sides of the city, while predominantly white schools were located in predominantly white areas in the north, northwest and southwest sides of Chicago.

Many segregated schools were very overcrowded. To ease this overcrowding, the Board instated double shifts at some of the schools which helped with the overcrowding but provided new issues. Double shifts meant that students in affected schools attended less than a full day of class. In another measure to alleviate overcrowding at some schools, the Board sanctioned the construction of mobile classroom units. Moreover, a significant proportion of students dropped out before finishing high school. Faculty was segregated, and many teachers in predominantly black schools lacked full-time teaching experience compared to teachers in white schools. In addition, the history curriculum did not mention African Americans. According to CORE, &quot;school segregation [was] a damaging bacteria, a psychological handicap, which [festered] a disease generating widespread unemployment and crime in Chicago&quot;.

Between 1960 and 1963, CORE diligently wrote letters addressing the conditions of schools to various authorities, including the Board of Education (led by Superintendent Benjamin Willis), Mayor Richard J. Daley, the Illinois House of Representatives, and the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, advocating for improvements in educational equality. In addition, CORE attended the Board&#x27;s school budget hearings, speaking against segregation and asking for the Board to implement transfer plans to desegregate the schools. In July 1963, CORE staged a week-long sit-in and protest at the Board office in downtown Chicago in response to the Board&#x27;s inaction. Finally, Board President Claire Roddewig and Willis agreed to meet with CORE to negotiate integration, but no significant changes came to the schools.

During the mid-1960s, CORE turned towards community involvement, seeking to equip Chicagoans with ways to challenge segregation. Freedom Houses, transfer petitions, community rallies and meetings served to educate Chicagoans about segregation and provide them with tools to circumnavigate the neighborhood school policy.

By 1966, the Chicago Freedom Movement, led by Martin Luther King Jr., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and Chicago&#x27;s Coordinating Council of Community Organizations (CCCO), had assumed control over civil rights demonstrations and negotiations. While CORE was a member organization of the CCCO, it increasingly lost influence over desegregation efforts. And when the Chicago Freedom Movement met with representatives of the city to negotiate in the summer of 1966, they agreed on ten fair housing reforms but did not discuss reforms to desegregate the schools. While CORE played no role in the housing summit, it had shifted towards promoting and developing Black power in Chicago. By the fall of 1966, CORE was no longer a civil rights organization, but a Black power organization. Changes in CORE&#x27;s national leadership and continued inaction on behalf of the Board to desegregate the schools pushed CORE towards separatism and away from desegregation efforts. The chapter collapsed in October 1968.

=== Desegregating Durham ===
In 1962, CORE set up a headquarters in Durham, North Carolina where upon arrival, local black women activists, including Sadie Sawyer Hughley, welcomed them into their homes. CORE worked with the local NAACP to organize pickets at Eckerd&#x27;s Drug Store and Howard Johnson&#x27;s. The goals were to increase employment opportunities for black workers and integrate local restaurants.

===March on Washington===
In 1963, the organization helped organize the famous March on Washington. On August 28, 1963, more than 250,000 people marched peacefully to the Lincoln Memorial to demand equal justice for all citizens under the law. At the end of the march Martin Luther King Jr. made his famous &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech.

===&quot;Freedom Summer&quot;===

The following year, CORE along with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) helped organize the &quot;Freedom Summer&quot; campaign—aimed principally at ending the political disenfranchisement of African Americans in the Deep South. Operating under the umbrella coalition of the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO), volunteers from the three organizations concentrated their efforts in Mississippi. In 1962 only 6.7 percent of African Americans in the state were registered to vote, the lowest percentage in the country. This involved the formation of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP). Over 80,000 people joined the party and 68 delegates attended the Democratic Party Convention in Atlantic City and challenged the attendance of the all-white Mississippi representation.

CORE, SNCC, and COFO collaborated to establish 30 Freedom Schools in towns across Mississippi. As a group, the three organizations collected volunteers that taught in the schools and the curriculum now included black history, the philosophy of the civil rights movement. During the summer of 1964 over 3,000 students attended these schools and the experiment provided a model for future educational programs such as Head Start.

Freedom Schools were often targets of white mobs. So also were the homes of local African Americans involved in the campaign. That summer 30 black homes and 37 black churches were firebombed. Over 80 volunteers were beaten by white mobs or racist police officers. Three CORE activists, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, were murdered by the Ku Klux Klan on June 21, 1964 (&quot;see&quot; Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner). These deaths created nationwide publicity for the campaign.

=== Louisiana Chapter of CORE and The Support for Armed Self-Defense ===
CORE, at its heart, is an organization dedicated to non-violent philosophies and practices. In Louisiana, efforts were being made to increase voter registration among rural communities. Though their motives were noble, there was no national attention or support gathering around the work of the Louisiana members. As such, acts of violence or harassment against them often went unreported and the victims were not supported by the public. Compounding this issue, both the national and local government felt no responsibility to protect these members or supply federal intervention. These underlying issues in Louisiana stirred up support among local CORE members for the idea of allowing armed self-defense within their ranks.

The idea of armed-self defense would be supported by CORE co-founder James Farmer after an incident in Plaquemine, Louisiana. On September 1, 1963 local police of Plaqumine threatened to lynch Farmer after a CORE demonstration in the city turned violent. As a result, he had to be smuggled out of the city accompanied by two armed men. After this event, Farmer would go on to permit armed guards to attend CORE meetings.

=== Brooklyn Chapter of CORE ===
In New York City, the Brooklyn chapter of CORE was seen as one of the most radical chapters of CORE. This chapter employed increasingly aggressive tactics with a focus on racial discrimination. Primarily, the Brooklyn chapter of CORE used community-based activism which made it one of the most influential chapters in history. In 1964, the group held a Stall-In, deliberately preventing the flow of traffic to the World Fair with the goal of drawing attention to racial discrimination, which was one of their main focuses. Brooklyn&#x27;s CORE&#x27;s aggressive tactics would cause it to be suspended from the National CORE groups.

Brooklyn&#x27;s CORE used the slogan &quot;Jim Crow Must Go&quot; to raise awareness about the unequal schooling that African American children faced at this time as well as the overall unequal treatment of African Americans. While this slogan was typically associated with the south because they had Jim Crow Laws, using it in the north allowed Brooklyn&#x27;s CORE leaders to gain public acknowledgement that the north also had racial discrimination issues, just as the south did.

=== Kentucky Chapter of CORE ===

==== Beginning of CORE in Kentucky ====
CORE made significant strides in the civil rights movement in Kentucky, establishing its first chapter in Lexington in 1959. This chapter went on to be the strongest and longest-lasting chapter in Kentucky history. With other branches established in Louisville, Frankfort, Richmond, and Covington, CORE often collaborated with the NAACP and also other organizations that were a part of the same movement. One of the most notable collaborations with the NAACP was the successful challenge against Louisville’s residential segregation ordinance in the case Buchanan v. Warley on November 5, 1917.

This victory marked a big turning point in the history of CORE, especially in the state of Kentucky.  It attracted over 1,000 new members in Kentucky and was one of the first major civil rights victories. Although this was a big moment in Kentucky history, the NAACP had initiated direct action protests in Louisville even before CORE entered the state. This offered a base for the members of the CORE chapters in Kentucky to work off of and helped make strides in the movements of CORE.

==== Movements Made in Kentucky ====
CORE provided more interracial cooperation than other organizations, especially in the Lexington chapter, which consisted of mostly teachers and clergymen from the University of Kentucky. Their inaugural sit-in on July 11, 1959, at the Varsity Village Restaurant near the University of Kentucky campus, attended by both black and white members, set a precedent for peaceful protest. Despite their nonviolent approach, resistance from store managers often resulted in violence. This led to training sessions that were in place to prepare demonstrators for physical and verbal abuse, which many of the members encountered at these early sit-ins. They used new strategies, such as the “integrated sandwich plan”, where African Americans would sit next to a white member and the white member would order them a sandwich. These acts were only available to them as they were a group that encouraged interracial cooperation. Overall, CORE&#x27;s presence and outlook on protests catalyzed momentum for civil rights advancement in Kentucky.

=== Harlem Chapter of CORE ===
At the same time in New York City, the Harlem chapter of CORE was very active in supporting African Americans in New York. The Harlem chapter joined forces with Columbia University&#x27;s Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, Mau Mau, and other Harlem residents in order to protest different causes that stemmed from institutionalized racism. One of these causes was the opposition of Columbia University&#x27;s perceived complacency in surrounding the Vietnam War. These groups also voiced their opinions that they were not in support of the university making plans for the building of a gym in Morningside Park, and brought awareness to the lack of student involvement in discipline at Columbia University. In addition to these efforts, the Harlem chapter of CORE gathered food and resources in Hamilton Hall, for the impoverished to use as needed.

===March in Cicero, Illinois===
On September 4, 1966, Robert Lucas and fellow members of CORE led activists through Cicero, Illinois, to pressure the city of Chicago&#x27;s white leaders into making solid commitments to open housing. Shortly before the march, Chicago city officials, including Mayor Richard J. Daley, negotiated a Fair Housing agreement with Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, Al Raby and others in exchange for an end of demonstrations. Robert Lucas and other members of CORE felt that the march was strategically necessary and proceeded with it anyway. The march is documented in the 1966 short documentary film &quot;Cicero March&quot;, which was added to the National Film Registry in 2013.

=== Bay Area, California Chapters of CORE ===
CORE chapters in several Bay Area cities were instrumental in organizing civil rights protests throughout the area in the 1960s. Along with other local organizations, Bay Area CORE members targeted businesses that refused to change discriminatory hiring practices. Picketers demanded that businesses including Mel&#x27;s Drive-in, Sheraton Palace, and Bank of America hire more minorities and provide opportunities for employment in higher level positions. Bay Area chapters also organized protests to show support and solidarity with civil rights organizers throughout the country.

=== Since 1966 ===

In 1966, James Farmer resigned as Director of CORE. He was replaced by Black Power advocate Floyd McKissick until 1968, when California activist Wilfred T. Ussery served a brief term as national chairman. He was replaced by Roy Innis, who was the National Chairman until his death in 2017. Innis initially led the organization to strongly support black nationalism. However, subsequent political developments within the organization led it to support conservative political positions.

The FBI&#x27;s &quot;COINTELPRO&quot; program targeted civil rights groups, including the CORE, for infiltration, discreditation and disruption. In August 1967, the FBI instructed its program &quot;COINTELPRO&quot; to &quot;neutralize&quot; what the FBI called &quot;black nationalist hate groups&quot; and other dissident groups.

A CORE delegation toured seven African countries in 1971. Innis met with several heads of state, including Kenya’s Jomo Kenyatta, Tanzania’s Julius Nyerere, Liberia’s William Tolbert and Uganda&#x27;s Idi Amin, all of whom were gifted a life membership to CORE. In 1973, Innis became the first American to attend the Organization of African Unity (OAU) as a delegate.

In 1981, to settle illegal fundraising allegations under Roy Innis, CORE paid a $35,000 fine.

CORE provides immigration services to immigrants in the preparation of petitions and applications to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. CORE also provides classes for immigrants in fields such as English and American Civics in its center in Nevada.

== Geography ==
Winning victories in northern cities in the 1940s and 1950s, CORE became active in the South with the lunch counter sit-ins of 1960. The following year CORE organized &quot;Freedom Rides,&quot; sending black and white students south to disrupt segregated interstate bus service. Drawing much of its membership from college campuses, CORE kept up civil disobedience campaigns in the North as well as the South. They also organized activities in California, where they protested housing discrimination in San Francisco and Los Angeles, held a Western Region Conference in the Sacramento area, and launched an equal employment campaign at restaurants and stores throughout the state. In 1968, Seattle&#x27;s chapter of CORE decided that, in order for it to function best in the community, it needed to be an all-black organization.

== International activities ==

CORE has an African branch based in Uganda, with Fiona Kobusingye as its director. Bringing attention to the malaria crisis is one of the organization&#x27;s main activities. It has championed the use of DDT to fight the disease, and it has partnered with a variety of conservative and libertarian think tanks in this effort. In 2007, CORE organized a 300-mile walk across Uganda to promote DDT-based interventions against malaria.

== Criticism ==
According to an interview given by James Farmer in 1993, &quot;CORE has no functioning chapters; it holds no conventions, no elections, no meetings, sets no policies, has no social programs and does no fund-raising. In my opinion, CORE is fraudulent.&quot;

CORE has been criticized by environmentalist groups for its efforts promoting DDT use against malaria in Africa. A 2005 article in &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine accused the group of selling influence, writing that, &quot;is better known among real civil rights groups for renting out its historic name to any corporation in need of a black front person. The group has taken money from the payday-lending industry, chemical giant (and original DDT manufacturer) Monsanto, and a reported $40,000 from ExxonMobil.&quot; In his book, &quot;Not A Conspiracy Theory: How Business Propaganda Hijacks Democracy&quot;, Donald Gutstein wrote that &quot;In recent years CORE used its African-American facade to work with conservative groups to attack organizations like Greenpeace and undermine environmental regulation.&quot;
