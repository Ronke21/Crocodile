<text>Stereoscopy (also called stereoscopics, or stereo imaging) is a technique for creating or enhancing the illusion of depth in an image by means of stereopsis for binocular vision. The word &quot;stereoscopy&quot; derives . Any stereoscopic image is called a stereogram. Originally, stereogram referred to a pair of stereo images which could be viewed using a stereoscope.

Most stereoscopic methods present a pair of two-dimensional images to the viewer. The left image is presented to the left eye and the right image is presented to the right eye. When viewed, the human brain perceives the images as a single 3D view, giving the viewer the perception of 3D depth. However, the 3D effect lacks proper focal depth, which gives rise to the Vergence-accommodation conflict.

Stereoscopy is distinguished from other types of 3D displays that display an image in three full dimensions, allowing the observer to increase information about the 3-dimensional objects being displayed by head and eye movements.

==Background==
Stereoscopy creates the impression of three-dimensional depth from a pair of two-dimensional images. Human vision, including the perception of depth, is a complex process, which only begins with the acquisition of visual information taken in through the eyes; much processing ensues within the brain, as it strives to make sense of the raw information. One of the functions that occur within the brain as it interprets what the eyes see is assessing the relative distances of objects from the viewer, and the depth dimension of those objects. The &quot;cues&quot; that the brain uses to gauge relative distances and depth in a perceived scene include:
* Vergence
* Accommodation
* Stereopsis
* Occlusion - The overlapping of one object by another
* Subtended visual angle of an object of known size
* Linear perspective (convergence of parallel edges)
* Vertical position (objects closer to the horizon in the scene tend to be perceived as farther away)
* Haze or contrast, saturation, and color, greater distance generally being associated with greater haze, desaturation, and a shift toward blue
* Change in size of textured pattern detail

(All but the first two of the above cues exist in traditional two-dimensional images, such as paintings, photographs, and television.)

Stereoscopy is the production of the impression of depth in a photograph, movie, or other two-dimensional image by the presentation of a slightly different image to each eye, which adds the first of these cues (stereopsis). The two images are then combined in the brain to give the perception of depth. Because all points in the image produced by stereoscopy focus at the same plane regardless of their depth in the original scene, the second cue, focus, is not duplicated and therefore the illusion of depth is incomplete. There are also mainly two effects of stereoscopy that are unnatural for human vision: (1) the mismatch between convergence and accommodation, caused by the difference between an object&#x27;s perceived position in front of or behind the display or screen and the real origin of that light; and (2) possible crosstalk between the eyes, caused by imperfect image separation in some methods of stereoscopy.

Although the term &quot;3D&quot; is ubiquitously used, the presentation of dual 2D images is distinctly different from displaying an image in three full dimensions. The most notable difference is that, in the case of &quot;3D&quot; displays, the observer&#x27;s head and eye movement do not change the information received about the 3-dimensional objects being viewed. Holographic displays and volumetric display do not have this limitation. Just as it is not possible to recreate a full 3-dimensional sound field with just two stereophonic speakers, it is an overstatement to call dual 2D images &quot;3D&quot;. The accurate term &quot;stereoscopic&quot; is more cumbersome than the common misnomer &quot;3D&quot;, which has been entrenched by many decades of unquestioned misuse. Although most stereoscopic displays do not qualify as real 3D display, all real 3D displays are also stereoscopic displays because they meet the lower criteria also.

Most 3D displays use this stereoscopic method to convey images. It was first invented by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1838,
and improved by Sir David Brewster who made the first portable 3D viewing device.


Wheatstone originally used his stereoscope (a rather bulky device) with drawings because photography was not yet available, yet his original paper seems to foresee the development of a realistic imaging method:

For the purposes of illustration I have employed only outline figures, for had either shading or colouring been introduced it might be supposed that the effect was wholly or in part due to these circumstances, whereas by leaving them out of consideration no room is left to doubt that the entire effect of relief is owing to the simultaneous perception of the two monocular projections, one on each retina. But if it be required to obtain the most faithful resemblances of real objects, shadowing and colouring may properly be employed to heighten the effects. Careful attention would enable an artist to draw and paint the two component pictures, so as to present to the mind of the observer, in the resultant perception, perfect identity with the object represented. Flowers, crystals, busts, vases, instruments of various kinds, &amp;c., might thus be represented so as not to be distinguished by sight from the real objects themselves.

Stereoscopy is used in photogrammetry and also for entertainment through the production of stereograms. Stereoscopy is useful in viewing images rendered from large multi-dimensional data sets such as are produced by experimental data. Modern industrial three-dimensional photography may use 3D scanners to detect and record three-dimensional information. The three-dimensional depth information can be reconstructed from two images using a computer by correlating the pixels in the left and right images. Solving the Correspondence problem in the field of Computer Vision aims to create meaningful depth information from two images.

===Visual requirements===
Anatomically, there are 3 levels of binocular vision required to view stereo images:
# Simultaneous perception
# Fusion (binocular &#x27;single&#x27; vision)
# Stereopsis

These functions develop in early childhood. Some people who have strabismus disrupt the development of stereopsis, however orthoptics treatment can be used to improve binocular vision. A person&#x27;s stereoacuity determines the minimum image disparity they can perceive as depth. It is believed that approximately 12% of people are unable to properly see 3D images, due to a variety of medical conditions. According to another experiment up to 30% of people have very weak stereoscopic vision preventing them from depth perception based on stereo disparity. This nullifies or greatly decreases immersion effects of stereo to them.

Stereoscopic viewing may be artificially created by the viewer&#x27;s brain, as demonstrated with the Van Hare Effect, where the brain perceives stereo images even when the paired photographs are identical. This &quot;false dimensionality&quot; results from the developed stereoacuity in the brain, allowing the viewer to fill in depth information even when few if any 3D cues are actually available in the paired images.
==Side-by-side==

Traditional stereoscopic photography consists of creating a 3D illusion starting from a pair of 2D images, a stereogram. The easiest way to enhance depth perception in the brain is to provide the eyes of the viewer with two different images, representing two perspectives of the same object, with a minor deviation equal or nearly equal to the perspectives that both eyes naturally receive in binocular vision.

To avoid eyestrain and distortion, each of the two 2D images should be presented to the viewer so that any object at infinite distance is perceived by the eye as being straight ahead, the viewer&#x27;s eyes being neither crossed nor diverging. When the picture contains no object at infinite distance, such as a horizon or a cloud, the pictures should be spaced correspondingly closer together.

The advantages of side-by-side viewers is the lack of diminution of brightness, allowing the presentation of images at very high resolution and in full spectrum color, simplicity in creation, and little or no additional image processing is required. Under some circumstances, such as when a pair of images is presented for freeviewing, no device or additional optical equipment is needed.

The principal disadvantage of side-by-side viewers is that large image displays are not practical and resolution is limited by the lesser of the display medium or human eye. This is because as the dimensions of an image are increased, either the viewing apparatus or viewer themselves must move proportionately further away from it in order to view it comfortably. Moving closer to an image in order to see more detail would only be possible with viewing equipment that adjusted to the difference. 

===Freeviewing===
Freeviewing is viewing a side-by-side image pair without using a viewing device.

Two methods are available to freeview:
* The parallel viewing method uses an image pair with the left-eye image on the left and the right-eye image on the right. The fused three-dimensional image appears larger and more distant than the two actual images, making it possible to convincingly simulate a life-size scene. The viewer attempts to look &quot;through&quot; the images with the eyes substantially parallel, as if looking at the actual scene. This can be difficult with normal vision because eye focus and binocular convergence are habitually coordinated. One approach to decoupling the two functions is to view the image pair extremely close up with completely relaxed eyes, making no attempt to focus clearly but simply achieving comfortable stereoscopic fusion of the two blurry images by the &quot;look-through&quot; approach, and only then exerting the effort to focus them more clearly, increasing the viewing distance as necessary. Regardless of the approach used or the image medium, for comfortable viewing and stereoscopic accuracy the size and spacing of the images should be such that the corresponding points of very distant objects in the scene are separated by the same distance as the viewer&#x27;s eyes, but not more; the average interocular distance is about 63 mm. Viewing much more widely separated images is possible, but because the eyes never diverge in normal use it usually requires some previous training and tends to cause eye strain.
* The cross-eyed viewing method swaps the left and right eye images so that they will be correctly seen cross-eyed, the left eye viewing the image on the right and vice versa. The fused three-dimensional image appears to be smaller and closer than the actual images, so that large objects and scenes appear miniaturized. This method is usually easier for freeviewing novices. As an aid to fusion, a fingertip can be placed just below the division between the two images, then slowly brought straight toward the viewer&#x27;s eyes, keeping the eyes directed at the fingertip; at a certain distance, a fused three-dimensional image should seem to be hovering just above the finger. Alternatively, a piece of paper with a small opening cut into it can be used in a similar manner; when correctly positioned between the image pair and the viewer&#x27;s eyes, it will seem to frame a small three-dimensional image.

Prismatic, self-masking glasses are now being used by some cross-eyed-view advocates. These reduce the degree of convergence required and allow large images to be displayed. However, any viewing aid that uses prisms, mirrors or lenses to assist fusion or focus is simply a type of stereoscope, excluded by the customary definition of freeviewing.

Stereoscopically fusing two separate images without the aid of mirrors or prisms while simultaneously keeping them in sharp focus without the aid of suitable viewing lenses inevitably requires an unnatural combination of eye vergence and accommodation. Simple freeviewing therefore cannot accurately reproduce the physiological depth cues of the real-world viewing experience. Different individuals may experience differing degrees of ease and comfort in achieving fusion and good focus, as well as differing tendencies to eye fatigue or strain.

===Autostereogram===

An autostereogram is a single-image stereogram (SIS), designed to create the visual illusion of a three-dimensional (3D) scene within the human brain from an external two-dimensional image. In order to perceive 3D shapes in these autostereograms, one must overcome the normally automatic coordination between focusing and vergence.

===Stereoscope and stereographic cards===

The stereoscope is essentially an instrument in which two photographs of the same object, taken from slightly different angles, are simultaneously presented, one to each eye. A simple stereoscope is limited in the size of the image that may be used. A more complex stereoscope uses a pair of horizontal periscope-like devices, allowing the use of larger images that can present more detailed information in a wider field of view. One can buy historical stereoscopes such as Holmes stereoscopes as antiques.

===Transparency viewers===
Some stereoscopes are designed for viewing transparent photographs on film or glass, known as &quot;transparencies&quot; or &quot;diapositives&quot; and commonly called &quot;slides&quot;. Some of the earliest stereoscope views, issued in the 1850s, were on glass. In the early 20th century, 45x107 mm and 6x13 cm glass slides were common formats for amateur stereo photography, especially in Europe. In later years, several film-based formats were in use. The best-known formats for commercially issued stereo views on film are Tru-Vue, introduced in 1931, and View-Master, introduced in 1939 and still in production. For amateur stereo slides, the Stereo Realist format, introduced in 1947, is by far the most common.

===Head-mounted displays===
The user typically wears a helmet or glasses with two small LCD or OLED displays with magnifying lenses, one for each eye. The technology can be used to show stereo films, images or games, but it can also be used to create a &quot;virtual&quot; display. Head-mounted displays may also be coupled with head-tracking devices, allowing the user to &quot;look around&quot; the virtual world by moving their head, eliminating the need for a separate controller. Performing this update quickly enough to avoid inducing nausea in the user requires a great amount of computer image processing. If six axis position sensing (direction and position) is used then wearer may move about within the limitations of the equipment used. Owing to rapid advancements in computer graphics and the continuing miniaturization of video and other equipment these devices are beginning to become available at more reasonable cost.

Head-mounted or wearable glasses may be used to view a see-through image imposed upon the real world view, creating what is called augmented reality. This is done by reflecting the video images through partially reflective mirrors. The real world view is seen through the mirrors&#x27; reflective surface. Experimental systems have been used for gaming, where virtual opponents may peek from real windows as a player moves about. This type of system is expected to have wide application in the maintenance of complex systems, as it can give a technician what is effectively &quot;x-ray vision&quot; by combining computer graphics rendering of hidden elements with the technician&#x27;s natural vision. Additionally, technical data and schematic diagrams may be delivered to this same equipment, eliminating the need to obtain and carry bulky paper documents.

Augmented stereoscopic vision is also expected to have applications in surgery, as it allows the combination of radiographic data (CAT scans and MRI imaging) with the surgeon&#x27;s vision.

===Virtual retinal displays===

A virtual retinal display (VRD), also known as a retinal scan display (RSD) or retinal projector (RP), not to be confused with a &quot;Retina Display&quot;, is a display technology that draws a raster image (like a television picture) directly onto the retina of the eye. The user sees what appears to be a conventional display floating in space in front of them. For true stereoscopy, each eye must be provided with its own discrete display. To produce a virtual display that occupies a usefully large visual angle but does not involve the use of relatively large lenses or mirrors, the light source must be very close to the eye. A contact lens incorporating one or more semiconductor light sources is the form most commonly proposed. As of 2013, the inclusion of suitable light-beam-scanning means in a contact lens is still very problematic, as is the alternative of embedding a reasonably transparent array of hundreds of thousands (or millions, for HD resolution) of accurately aligned sources of collimated light.


==3D viewers==

There are two categories of 3D viewer technology, active and passive. Active viewers have electronics which interact with a display. Passive viewers filter constant streams of binocular input to the appropriate eye.

===Active===
====Shutter systems====
A shutter system works by openly presenting the image intended for the left eye while blocking the right eye&#x27;s view, then presenting the right-eye image while blocking the left eye, and repeating this so rapidly that the interruptions do not interfere with the perceived fusion of the two images into a single 3D image. It generally uses liquid crystal shutter glasses. Each eye&#x27;s glass contains a liquid crystal layer which has the property of becoming dark when voltage is applied, being otherwise transparent. The glasses are controlled by a timing signal that allows the glasses to alternately darken over one eye, and then the other, in synchronization with the refresh rate of the screen. The main drawback of active shutters is that most 3D videos and movies were shot with simultaneous left and right views, so that it introduces a &quot;time parallax&quot; for anything side-moving: for instance, someone walking at 3.4 mph will be seen 20% too close or 25% too remote in the most current case of a 2x60 Hz projection.

===Passive===
====Polarization systems====

To present stereoscopic pictures, two images are projected superimposed onto the same screen through polarizing filters or presented on a display with polarized filters. For projection, a silver screen is used so that polarization is preserved. On most passive displays every other row of pixels is polarized for one eye or the other. This method is also known as being interlaced. The viewer wears low-cost eyeglasses which also contain a pair of opposite polarizing filters. As each filter only passes light which is similarly polarized and blocks the opposite polarized light, each eye only sees one of the images, and the effect is achieved.

====Interference filter systems====

This technique uses specific wavelengths of red, green, and blue for the right eye, and different wavelengths of red, green, and blue for the left eye. Eyeglasses which filter out the very specific wavelengths allow the wearer to see a full color 3D image. It is also known as &quot;spectral comb filtering&quot; or &quot;wavelength multiplex visualization&quot; or &quot;super-anaglyph&quot;. Dolby 3D uses this principle. The Omega 3D/Panavision 3D system has also used an improved version of this technology
In June 2012 the Omega 3D/Panavision 3D system was discontinued by DPVO Theatrical, who marketed it on behalf of Panavision, citing &quot;challenging global economic and 3D market conditions&quot;.

====Color anaglyph systems====

Anaglyph 3D is the name given to the stereoscopic 3D effect achieved by means of encoding each eye&#x27;s image using filters of different (usually chromatically opposite) colors, typically red and cyan. Red-cyan filters can be used because our vision processing systems use red and cyan comparisons, as well as blue and yellow, to determine the color and contours of objects. Anaglyph 3D images contain two differently filtered colored images, one for each eye. When viewed through the &quot;color-coded&quot; &quot;anaglyph glasses&quot;, each of the two images reaches one eye, revealing an integrated stereoscopic image. The visual cortex of the brain fuses this into perception of a three dimensional scene or composition.

====ChromaDepth system====

The ChromaDepth procedure of American Paper Optics is based on the fact that with a prism, colors are separated by varying degrees. The ChromaDepth eyeglasses contain special view foils, which consist of microscopically small prisms. This causes the image to be translated a certain amount that depends on its color. If one uses a prism foil now with one eye but not on the other eye, then the two seen pictures – depending upon color – are more or less widely separated. The brain produces the spatial impression from this difference. The advantage of this technology consists above all of the fact that one can regard ChromaDepth pictures also without eyeglasses (thus two-dimensional) problem-free (unlike with two-color anaglyph). However the colors are only limitedly selectable, since they contain the depth information of the picture. If one changes the color of an object, then its observed distance will also be changed.

====Pulfrich method====

The Pulfrich effect is based on the phenomenon of the human eye processing images more slowly when there is less light, as when looking through a dark lens. Because the Pulfrich effect depends on motion in a particular direction to instigate the illusion of depth, it is not useful as a general stereoscopic technique. For example, it cannot be used to show a stationary object apparently extending into or out of the screen; similarly, objects moving vertically will not be seen as moving in depth. Incidental movement of objects will create spurious artifacts, and these incidental effects will be seen as artificial depth not related to actual depth in the scene.

====Over/under format====
Stereoscopic viewing is achieved by placing an image pair one above one another. Special viewers are made for over/under format that tilt the right eyesight slightly up and the left eyesight slightly down. The most common one with mirrors is the View Magic. Another with prismatic glasses is the KMQ viewer. A recent usage of this technique is the openKMQ project.

==Other display methods without viewers==
===Autostereoscopy===
Autostereoscopic display technologies use optical components in the display, rather than worn by the user, to enable each eye to see a different image. Because headgear is not required, it is also called &quot;glasses-free 3D&quot;. The optics split the images directionally into the viewer&#x27;s eyes, so the display viewing geometry requires limited head positions that will achieve the stereoscopic effect. Automultiscopic displays provide multiple views of the same scene, rather than just two. Each view is visible from a different range of positions in front of the display. This allows the viewer to move left-right in front of the display and see the correct view from any position. The technology includes two broad classes of displays: those that use head-tracking to ensure that each of the viewer&#x27;s two eyes sees a different image on the screen, and those that display multiple views so that the display does not need to know where the viewers&#x27; eyes are directed. Examples of autostereoscopic displays technology include lenticular lens, parallax barrier, volumetric display, holography and light field displays.

====Holography====

Laser holography, in its original &quot;pure&quot; form of the photographic &quot;transmission hologram&quot;, is the only technology yet created which can reproduce an object or scene with such complete realism that the reproduction is visually indistinguishable from the original, given the original lighting conditions. It creates a light field identical to that which emanated from the original scene, with parallax about all axes and a very wide viewing angle. The eye differentially focuses objects at different distances and subject detail is preserved down to the microscopic level. The effect is exactly like looking through a window. Unfortunately, this &quot;pure&quot; form requires the subject to be laser-lit and completely motionless—to within a minor fraction of the wavelength of light—during the photographic exposure, and laser light must be used to properly view the results. Most people have never seen a laser-lit transmission hologram. The types of holograms commonly encountered have seriously compromised image quality so that ordinary white light can be used for viewing, and non-holographic intermediate imaging processes are almost always resorted to, as an alternative to using powerful and hazardous pulsed lasers, when living subjects are photographed.

Although the original photographic processes have proven impractical for general use, the combination of computer-generated holograms (CGH) and optoelectronic holographic displays, both under development for many years, has the potential to transform the half-century-old pipe dream of holographic 3D television into a reality; so far, however, the large amount of calculation required to generate just one detailed hologram, and the huge bandwidth required to transmit a stream of them, have confined this technology to the research laboratory.

In 2013, a Silicon Valley company, LEIA Inc, started manufacturing holographic displays well suited for mobile devices (watches, smartphones or tablets) using a multi-directional backlight and allowing a wide full-parallax angle view to see 3D content without the need of glasses.

====Volumetric displays====

Volumetric displays use some physical mechanism to display points of light within a volume. Such displays use voxels instead of pixels. Volumetric displays include multiplanar displays, which have multiple display planes stacked up, and rotating panel displays, where a rotating panel sweeps out a volume.

Other technologies have been developed to project light dots in the air above a device. An infrared laser is focused on the destination in space, generating a small bubble of plasma which emits visible light.

====Integral imaging====

Integral imaging is a technique for producing 3D displays which are both autostereoscopic and multiscopic, meaning that the 3D image is viewed without the use of special glasses and different aspects are seen when it is viewed from positions that differ either horizontally or vertically. This is achieved by using an array of microlenses (akin to a lenticular lens, but an X–Y or &quot;fly&#x27;s eye&quot; array in which each lenslet typically forms its own image of the scene without assistance from a larger objective lens) or pinholes to capture and display the scene as a 4D light field, producing stereoscopic images that exhibit realistic alterations of parallax and perspective when the viewer moves left, right, up, down, closer, or farther away.

Integral imaging may not technically be a type of autostereoscopy, as autostereoscopy still refers to the generation of two images.

=== Wiggle stereoscopy ===

Wiggle stereoscopy is an image display technique achieved by quickly alternating display of left and right sides of a stereogram. Found in animated GIF format on the web, online examples are visible in the New-York Public Library stereogram collection . The technique is also known as &quot;Piku-Piku&quot;.

==Stereo photography techniques==

For general-purpose stereo photography, where the goal is to duplicate natural human vision and give a visual impression as close as possible to actually being there, the correct baseline (distance between where the right and left images are taken) would be the same as the distance between the eyes. When images taken with such a baseline are viewed using a viewing method that duplicates the conditions under which the picture is taken, then the result would be an image much the same as that which would be seen at the site the photo was taken. This could be described as &quot;ortho stereo.&quot;

However, there are situations in which it might be desirable to use a longer or shorter baseline. The factors to consider include the viewing method to be used and the goal in taking the picture. The concept of baseline also applies to other branches of stereography, such as stereo drawings and computer generated stereo images, but it involves the point of view chosen rather than actual physical separation of cameras or lenses.

==Stereo window==
The concept of the stereo window is always important, since the window is the stereoscopic image of the external boundaries of left and right views constituting the stereoscopic image. If any object, which is cut off by lateral sides of the window, is placed in front of it, an effect results that is unnatural and is undesirable, this is called a &quot;window violation.&quot; This can best be understood by returning to the analogy of an actual physical window. Therefore, there is a contradiction between two different depth cues: some elements of the image are hidden by the window, so that the window appears closer than these elements, and the same elements of the image appear closer than the window. As such, the stereo window must always be adjusted to avoid window violations to prevent viewer discomfort from conflicting depth cues.

Some objects can be seen in front of the window, as far as they do not reach the lateral sides of the window. But these objects cannot be seen as too close, since there is always a limit of the parallax range for comfortable viewing.

If a scene is viewed through a window the entire scene would normally be behind the window (assuming parallel view, with left images being seen by the left eye and vice versa). If the scene is distant, it would be some distance behind the window; if it is nearby, it would appear to be just beyond the window. An object smaller than the window itself could even go through the window and appear partially or completely in front of it. The same applies to a part of a larger object that is smaller than the window. The goal of setting the stereo window is to duplicate this effect.

Therefore, the location of the window versus the whole of the image must be adjusted so that most of the image is seen beyond the window. In the case of viewing on a 3D TV set, it is easier to place the window in front of the image, and to let the window in the plane of the screen.

On the contrary, in the case of projection on a much larger screen, it is much better to set the window in front of the screen (it is called &quot;floating window&quot;), for instance so that it is viewed about two meters away by the viewers sit in the first row. Therefore, these people will normally see the background of the image at the infinite. Of course the viewers seated beyond will see the window more remote, but if the image is made in normal conditions, so that the first row viewers see this background at the infinite, the other viewers, seated behind, will also see this background at the infinite, since the parallax of this background is equal to the average human interocular distance.

The entire scene, including the window, can be moved backwards or forwards in depth, by horizontally sliding the left and right eye views relative to each other. Moving either or both images away from the center will bring the whole scene away from the viewer, whereas moving either or both images toward the center will move the whole scene toward the viewer. This is possible, for instance, if two projectors are used for this projection.

In stereo photography window adjustments is accomplished by shifting/cropping the images, in other forms of stereoscopy such as drawings and computer generated images the window is built into the design of the images as they are generated.

The images can be cropped creatively to create a stereo window that is not necessarily rectangular or lying on a flat plane perpendicular to the viewer&#x27;s line of sight. The edges of the stereo frame can be straight or curved and, when viewed in 3D, can flow toward or away from the viewer and through the scene. These designed stereo frames can help emphasize certain elements in the stereo image or can be an artistic component of the stereo image.

In freeview parallel method or glasses/stereoscope-assisted 3D viewing, “window violations” may refer to subjects that are cropped beyond the focal plane or screen (as if looking at part of a large object that fills a narrow window). However, most window violations refer to objects viewed in crossview (“popouts” where an object appears before the focal plane or screen; right image to left eye and vice versa), where parts of the object appear to be physically cropped; imagine a large object extruded through a small window such that its edges are literally cut off. This is a critical, traditional window violation before the window (between a viewer and the screen), and is most disorienting because parts of the popout object seem to be missing, rather than merely hidden as they would be with parallel-viewed objects beyond the window (depth).

==Uses==

While stereoscopic images have typically been used for amusement, including stereographic cards, 3D films, 3D television, stereoscopic video games, printings using anaglyph and pictures, posters and books of autostereograms, there are also other uses of this technology.

===Art===
Salvador Dalí created some impressive stereograms in his exploration in a variety of optical illusions. Other stereo artists include Zoe Beloff, Christopher Schneberger, Rebecca Hackemann, William Kentridge, and Jim Naughten. Red-and-cyan anaglyph stereoscopic images have also been painted by hand.

===Education===
In the 19th century, it was realized that stereoscopic images provided an opportunity for people to experience places and things far away, and many tour sets were produced, and books were published allowing people to learn about geography, science, history, and other subjects. Such uses continued till the mid-20th century, with the Keystone View Company producing cards into the 1960s.

===Space exploration===
The Mars Exploration Rovers, launched by NASA in 2003 to explore the surface of Mars, are equipped with unique cameras that allow researchers to view stereoscopic images of the surface of Mars.

The two cameras that make up each rover&#x27;s Pancam are situated 1.5m above the ground surface, and are separated by 30 cm, with 1 degree of toe-in. This allows the image pairs to be made into scientifically useful stereoscopic images, which can be viewed as stereograms, anaglyphs, or processed into 3D computer images.

The ability to create realistic 3D images from a pair of cameras at roughly human-height gives researchers increased insight as to the nature of the landscapes being viewed. In environments without hazy atmospheres or familiar landmarks, humans rely on stereoscopic clues to judge distance. Single camera viewpoints are therefore more difficult to interpret. Multiple camera stereoscopic systems like the Pancam address this problem with uncrewed space exploration.

===Clinical uses===
Stereogram cards and vectographs are used by optometrists, ophthalmologists, orthoptists and vision therapists in the diagnosis and treatment of binocular vision and accommodative disorders.

===Mathematical, scientific and engineering uses===

Stereopair photographs provided a way for 3-dimensional (3D) visualisations of aerial photographs; since about 2000, 3D aerial views are mainly based on digital stereo imaging technologies. One issue related to stereo images is the amount of disk space needed to save such files. Indeed, a stereo image usually requires twice as much space as a normal image. Recently, computer vision scientists tried to find techniques to attack the visual redundancy of stereopairs with the aim to define compressed version of stereopair files. Cartographers generate today stereopairs using computer programs in order to visualise topography in three dimensions. Computerised stereo visualisation applies stereo matching programs.
In biology and chemistry, complex molecular structures are often rendered in stereopairs. The same technique can also be applied to any mathematical (or scientific, or engineering) parameter that is a function of two variables, although in these cases it is more common for a three-dimensional effect to be created using a &#x27;distorted&#x27; mesh or shading (as if from a distant light source).

<text>The UNIVAC 1100/2200 series is a series of compatible 36-bit computer systems, beginning with the UNIVAC 1107 in 1962, initially made by Sperry Rand. The series continues to be supported today by Unisys Corporation as the ClearPath Dorado Series. The solid-state 1107 model number was in the same sequence as the earlier vacuum-tube computers, but the early computers were not compatible with their solid-state successors.

==Architecture==

===Data formats===
*Fixed-point, either integer or fraction
**Whole word – 36-bit (ones&#x27; complement)
**Half word – two 18-bit fields per word (unsigned or ones&#x27; complement)
**Third word – three 12-bit fields per word (ones&#x27; complement)
**Quarter word – four 9-bit fields per word (unsigned)
**Sixth word – six 6-bit fields per word (unsigned)
*Floating point
**Single precision – 36 bits: sign bit, 8-bit characteristic, 27-bit mantissa
**Double precision – 72 bits: sign bit, 11-bit characteristic, 60-bit mantissa
*Alphanumeric
**FIELDATA – UNIVAC 6-bit code variant (no lower case characters) six characters in each 36-bit word. (FIELDATA was originally a seven-bit code of which only 64 code positions (occupying six bits) were formally defined.)
**ASCII – 9 bits per character (right-most eight used for an ASCII character) four characters in each 36-bit word

===Instruction format===
Instructions are 36 bits long with the following fields:
:f (6 bits) - function designator (opcode),
:j (4 bits) - partial word designator, J-register designator, or minor function designator,
:a (4 bits) - register (A, X, or R) designator or I/O designator,
:x (4 bits) - index register (X) designator,
:h (1 bit ) - index register increment designator,
:i (1 bit) - indirect address designator,
:u (16 bits) - address or operand designator.

===Registers===
The 128 registers of the high-speed &quot;general register stack&quot; (&quot;integrated circuit registers&quot; on the UNIVAC 1108 and UNIVAC 1106 models), map to the current data space in main storage starting at memory address zero. These registers include both user and executive copies of the A, X, R, and J registers and many special function executive registers.

The table on the right shows the addresses (in octal) of the user registers.

There are 15 index registers (X1 ... X15), 16 accumulators (A0 ... A15), and 15 special function user registers (R1 .. R15). The 4 J registers and 3 &quot;staging registers&quot; are uses of some of the special function R registers.

One interesting feature is that the last four index registers (X12 ... X15) and the first four accumulators (A0 ... A3) overlap, allowing data to be interpreted either way in these registers. This also results in four &quot;unassigned&quot; accumulators (A15+1 ... A15+4) that can only be accessed by their memory address (double word instructions on A15 do operate on A15+1).

==Vacuum tube machines not mutually compatible==
Prior to the UNIVAC 1107, UNIVAC produced several vacuum-tube-based machines with model numbers from 1101 to 1105. These machines had different architectures and word sizes and were not compatible with each other or with the 1107 and its successors. They all used vacuum tubes and many used drum memory as their main memory. Some were designed by Engineering Research Associates (ERA) which was later purchased and merged with the UNIVAC company.

The UNIVAC 1101, or ERA 1101, was a computer system designed by ERA and built by the Remington Rand corporation in the 1950s. It was never sold commercially. It was developed under Navy Project 13, which is 1101 in binary. The UNIVAC 1102 or ERA 1102 was designed by Engineering Research Associates for the United States Air Force. The 36-bit UNIVAC 1103 was introduced in 1953 and an upgraded version (UNIVAC 1103A) was released in 1956. This was the first commercial computer to use core memory instead of the Williams tube. The UNIVAC 1105 was the successor to the 1103A, and was introduced in 1958.

The UNIVAC 1104 system was a 30-bit version of the 1103 built for Westinghouse Electric, in 1957, for use on the BOMARC Missile Program. However, by the time the BOMARC was deployed in the 1960s, a more modern computer (a version of the AN/USQ-20, designated the G-40) had replaced the UNIVAC 1104.

==UNIVAC 1100 compatible series==
These machines had a common architecture and word size. They all used transistorized electronics and integrated circuits. Early machines used core memory (the 1110 used plated-wire memory) until that was replaced with semiconductor memory in 1975.

===1107===
The UNIVAC 1107 was the first solid-state member of Sperry Univac&#x27;s UNIVAC 1100 series of computers, introduced in October 1962. It was also known as the Thin-Film Computer because of its use of thin-film memory for its register storage. It represented a marked change of architecture: unlike previous models, it was not a strict two-address machine: it was a single-address machine with up to 65,536 words of 36-bit core memory. The machine&#x27;s registers were stored in 128 words of thin-film memory, a faster form of magnetic storage. With six cycles of thin-film memory per 4 microsecond main memory cycle, address indexing was performed without a cycle time penalty. Only 36 systems were sold.

The core memory was available in 16,384 36-bit words in a single bank; or in increments of 16,384 words to a maximum of 65,536 words in two separately accessed banks. With a cycle time of 4 microseconds, the effective cycle time was 2 microseconds when instruction and data accesses overlapped in two banks.

The 128-word thin-film memory general register stack (16 each arithmetic, index, and repeat with a few in common) had a 300-nanosecond access time with a complete cycle time of 600 nanoseconds. Six cycles of thin-film memory per core memory cycle and fast adder circuitry permitted memory address indexing within the current instruction core memory cycle and also modification of the index value (the signed upper 18 bits were added to the lower 18 bits) in the specified index register (16 were available). The 16 input/output (I/O) channels also used thin-film memory locations for direct-to-memory I/O memory location registers. Programs could not be executed from unused thin-film memory locations.

Both UNISERVO IIA and UNISERVO III tape drives were supported, both of which could use either metallic (UNIVAC I) or mylar tape.

The FH880 drum memory unit was also supported as a spooling and file-storage media. Spinning at 1800 RPM, it stored approximately 300,000 36-bit words.

The 1107, without any peripherals, weighed about .

Univac provided a batch operating system, EXEC I. Computer Sciences Corporation was contracted to provide a powerful optimizing Fortran IV compiler, an assembler named SLEUTH with sophisticated macro capabilities, and a very flexible linking loader.
====Example costs====
The following is an example budget estimate for a UNIVAC 1107 from 1963.

===1108===

The 1108 was introduced in 1964. Integrated circuits replaced the thin-film memory that the UNIVAC 1107 used for register storage. Smaller and faster cores, compared to the 1107, were used for main memory.

In addition to faster components, two significant design improvements were incorporated: base registers and additional hardware instructions. The two 18-bit base registers (one for instruction storage and one for data storage) permitted dynamic relocation: as a program got swapped in and out of main memory, its instructions and data could be placed anywhere each time it got reloaded. To support multiprogramming, the 1108 had memory protection using two base and limit registers, with 512-word resolution. One was called the I-bank or instruction bank, and the other the D-bank or data bank. If the I-bank and D-bank of a program were put into different physical banks of memory, a 1/2 microsecond advantage accrued, called &quot;alternate bank timing.&quot; The 1108 also introduced the Processor State Register, or PSR. In addition to controlling the Base Registers, it included various control &quot;bits&quot; that enabled the various Storage Protection features, allowed selection of either the User or Exec set of A, X &amp; R registers, and enabled &quot;Guard Mode&quot; for user programs. Guard Mode prevented user programs from execution of Executive Only &quot;privileged&quot; instructions, and from accessing memory locations outside the program&#x27;s allocated memory.

Additional 1108 hardware instructions included double precision arithmetic, double-word load, store, and comparison instructions. The processor could have up to 16 input/output channels for peripherals. The 1108 CPU was, with the exception of the 128-word (200 octal) ICR (Integrated Control Register) stack, entirely implemented via discrete component logic cards, each with a 55-pin high density connector, which interfaced to a machine wire wrapped backplane. Additional hand applied twisted pair wiring was utilized to implement backplane connections with sensitive timing, connections between machine wire wrapped backplanes, and connections to the I/O channel connector panel in the lower section of the CPU Cabinet. The ICR (Integrated Control Register) stack was implemented with &quot;new&quot; integrated circuit technology, replacing the thin film registers on the 1107. The ICR consisted of 128 38-bits, with a half-word Parity Bit calculated and checked with each access. The ICR was logically the first 128 memory addresses (200 Octal), but was contained in the CPU. The core memory was contained in a one or more separate cabinet(s), and consisted of two separate 32K modules, for a total capacity of 64K 38-bit words (36-bits data and a Parity Bit for each 18-bit half-word). The basic cycle time of the core memory was 750 ns, and the supporting circuitry was implemented with the same circuit card/backplane technology as the 1108 CPU.

Just as the first UNIVAC 1108 systems were being delivered in 1965, Sperry Rand announced the UNIVAC 1108 II (also known as the UNIVAC 1108A) which had support for multiprocessing: up to three CPUs, four memory banks totaling 262,144 words, and two independent programmable input/output controllers (IOCs). With everything busy, five activities could be going on at the same moment: three programs running in the CPUs and two input/output processes in the IOCs. One more instruction was incorporated: test-and-set, to provide for synchronization between the CPUs.

Although a 1964 internal study indicated only about 43 might sell, in all, 296 processors were produced.

The 1108 II, or 1108A, was the first multiprocessor machine in the series, capable of expansion to three CPUs and two IOCs (Input/Output Control Units). To support this, it had up to 262,144 words (four cabinets) of eight-ported main memory: separate instruction and data paths for each CPU, and one path for each IOC. The memory was organized in physical banks of 65,536 words, with separate odd and even ports in each bank. The instruction set was very similar to that of the 1107, but included some additional instructions, including the &quot;Test and Set&quot; instruction for multiprocessor synchronization. Some models of the 1108 implemented the ability to divide words into four nine-bit bytes, allowing use of ASCII characters. Most 1108A configurations included one or two CPUs, each with eight or (optionally) 16 36-bit parallel I/O channels, and two or three 64K core memory cabinets. Three CPU systems, with four core memory cabinets were the exception due to cost considerations. The IOC was a separate cabinet that contained 8 or (optionally) 16 additional I/O channels to support configurations with very large Mass Storage requirements. A very limited number of IOCs were produced, with United Air Lines (UAL) being the primary customer.

The UNIVAC Array Processor, or UAP, was produced in even more limited numbers than the IOC. It was a custom-built, stand-alone math coprocessor to the 1108A system. The UAP, at its most basic level, consisted of four 1108A arithmetic units, and associated control circuitry, contained in a standalone cabinet almost identical to the 1108A CPU. The UAP was physically and logically situated between two 1108A multiprocessor systems. It was capable of directly addressing and interfacing to the four 65K core memory cabinets of two independent 1108A systems. It was capable of executing a number of array-processing instructions, the most important being fast Fourier transform (FFT). At a simplified level, one of the 1108A CPUs would move data arrays into core memory, and send the UAP an instruction packet, containing the function to be executed, and the memory address(es) of the data array(s), across a standard I/O channel. The UAP would then perform the operation, totally independent of the CPU(s), and, when the operation was complete, &quot;interrupt&quot; the originating CPU via the I/O channel. A very small number of UAPs were built, for Shell Oil Company, Digitech(Calgary) and Gulf Canada(Calgary). The UAPs installed were used for processing seismic data.

When Sperry Rand replaced the core memory with semiconductor memory, the same machine was released as the UNIVAC 1100/20. In this new naming convention, the final digit represented the number of CPUs (e.g., 1100/22 was a system with two CPUs) in the system.

===1106===
The 1107 and early 1108 machines were aimed at the engineering/scientific computing community, so much so that the 1100 Series User Group was named the UNIVAC Scientific Exchange, or USE. The operating systems were batch oriented, with FORTRAN and (to a much lesser extent) ALGOL being the most commonly used languages. As the market for commercial computing became more mature, these operating systems were no longer able to meet the growing demand for business computing, where applications were commonly written in COBOL. UNIVAC responded to this change in the market with the 1108A multiprocessor system and with the EXEC 8 operating system. Where engineering and scientific programs could often be &quot;compute bound&quot; (i.e. utilizing the entire CPU and core memory), business applications, typically written in COBOL, were almost always &quot;I/O bound&quot; (i.e. waiting for I/O operations to complete). Instrumentation of the EXEC 8 operating system showed that, in a 1108A multiprocessor configuration, the CPU(s) were often in the &quot;idle loop&quot; as much as 50% of the time (see note below). Since CPU performance was not an issue in these applications, it made commercial sense to create a lower-priced, lower-performance system to address the rapidly growing commercial business market.

The UNIVAC 1106 was introduced in December 1969 and was absolutely identical to the UNIVAC 1108, both physically and in instruction set. Like the 1108, it was multiprocessor capable, though it appears that it was never supplied with more than two CPUs, and did not support IOCs. In fact, the only difference between an 1108A CPU and an 1106 CPU was a couple of timing cards. In order to keep costs low, an 1106 CPU could be ordered with as few as four word channels. This meant that only three I/O channels were available for peripheral subsystems, as channel 15 (the highest-numbered channel) was always, in both 1106 and 1108 systems, dedicated to the operator&#x27;s console. Early versions of the UNIVAC 1106 were simply half-speed UNIVAC 1108 systems. Later Sperry Univac used a different memory system which was inherently slower and cheaper than that of the UNIVAC 1108. Sperry Univac sold a total of 338 processors in 1106 systems.

When Sperry Rand replaced the core memory with semiconductor memory, the same machine was released as the UNIVAC 1100/10.

* Note: EXEC 8 idle loop – the &quot;idle loop&quot; was entered when a CPU had no available task to execute (typically when waiting for an I/O operation to complete). A simplified description is that the CPU executed a block transfer (op code 022) of the ICR stack (the first 0200 memory addresses) back to the same addresses. Since the ICR stack was contained in the CPU, this minimized use of core memory cycles, freeing them up for active CPUs.

===1110===
The UNIVAC 1110 was the fourth member of the series, introduced in 1972.

The UNIVAC 1110 had enhanced multiprocessing support: sixteen-way memory access allowed up to six CAUs (Command Arithmetic Unit, the new name for CPU and so called because the CAU no longer had any I/O capability) and four IOAUs (Input Output Access Units, the name for separate units which performed the I/O channel programs). The 1110 CAU expanded the memory address range from the 18-bits (1108 and 1106) to 24-bits, allowing for up to 16 million words of addressable memory. The core memory used on the 1108/1106 systems was replaced with faster plated-wire memory. Each memory cabinet contained eight independent 8K plated-wire memory modules, or 64K for the entire cabinet. As with the 1108/1106, there was a maximum of four 64K cabinets per system. The 1110 also had &#x27;Extended Memory&#x27; cabinets accessible in a &#x27;daisy chain&#x27; arrangement to augment main storage. It was possible to utilize the 1108 64K core memory cabinets as Extended Storage, but in most systems utilized, the larger, less expensive 131K memory cabinets from the 1106 system. Up to eight Extended Memory cabinets were allowed, for a maximum of one million words of Extended Storage. An ESC (Extended Storage Controller) was required for each pair of memory cabinets to provide the physical connection, and address translation, from the 1110 CAUs and IOAU(s).

The minimum configuration for a 1110 system was two CAUs and one IOAU. The largest configuration, 6x4 was only used by NASA. The 1110 CAU was the first pipelined processor to be designed by UNIVAC. The CAU could have as many as four instructions in various stages of execution at any given instant. The IOAU was completely separate, both physically and logically from the CAU, and had its own access path to the various Main and Extended Memory Modules. This allowed I/O operations to be independent from the compute operations, no longer &quot;stealing&quot; memory cycles from CAU(s). The IOAU included 8 (optionally 16 or 24) 1108/1106 compatible 36-bit Word Channels, and also included the Hardware Maintenance Panel. Pictures/illustrations of a 1110 system typical showed the IOAU Maintenance Panel, as the CAU cabinet had no indicator lights. The IOAU Maintenance Panel could display the various CAU registers from one or two associated CAU(s). The 1110 CAU also introduced an extension to the instruction set of &#x27;Byte Instructions&#x27;. The major components of the 1110 system, the CAU, IOAU and Main Memory cabinets were designed using the same 55-pin high density card connectors, and machine wire wrapped backplane(s) as the 1108/1106. The discrete component logic used by the older systems was replaced by transistor–transistor logic (TTL) integrated circuits (see Note, below). The CAU was an extremely complex unit, utilizing over 1,000 cards.

When Sperry Rand replaced the plated-wire memory with semiconductor memory, the same machine was released as the UNIVAC 1100/40. In this new naming convention, the final digit represented the number of CPUs in the system. The 1100/40 utilized a new Main Memory cabinet, replacing the 8K plated-wire memory modules with 16K static RAM modules (based on 1024x1-bit static RAM chips), for a total of 131K per cabinet. This allowed expansion of the Main Memory to a maximum of 524K. As with the 1110, the 1100/40 CAU had four base and limit registers, so a program could access four 64k banks. New instructions were added to allow a program to change the contents of the banks, rather than the banks being fixed when the program was prepared

Sperry Rand sold a total of 290 processors in 1110 systems.

Note: TTL Integrated circuits used in 1110 (1100/40) CAU, IOAU and Main Memory cabinets were ceramic 14-pin DIPs, where pins 4 and 10 were +5 volts and ground respectively: state-of-the-art in 1969.

===Semiconductor memory series===

In 1975, Sperry Univac introduced a new series of machines with semiconductor memory replacing magnetic core, with a new naming convention:

An upgraded 1106 was called the UNIVAC 1100/10. In this new naming convention, the final digit represented the number of CPUs or CAUs in the system, so that, for example, a two-processor 1100/10 system was designated an 1100/12. An upgraded 1108 was called the UNIVAC 1100/20.

An upgraded 1110 was released as the UNIVAC 1100/40. The biggest change was the replacement of the Type 7015 64K Plated-Wire Memory cabinet with a new Type 7030 131K solid state (static RAM) Memory Cabinet. The allowed Main Storage to be expanded from maximum of 262K to a maximum of 524K. The Type 7030 Main Memory cabinet still contained eight separate Memory Modules, but they were now 16K (38-bit words, 36 Data and 2 Parity), instead of 8K each. The Type 7013 131K Core Memory Cabinet (originally used on the later 1106 Systems as Main Storage) was also replaced with a Solid-State Memory Cabinet, based on Intel 1103A DRAM.

The UNIVAC 1100/80 was introduced in 1979. It was intended to combine 1100 and 494 systems. As with the 1100/10, 1100/20 and 1100/40, the final digit represented the number of CAUs in the system.

The 1100/80 introduced a high-speed cache memory – the SIU or Storage Interface Unit. The SIU contained either 8K, or (optionally) 16K 36-bit words of buffer memory, and was logically and physically positioned between the CAU(s)/IOU(s) and the (larger, slower) Main Memory units. The first version of the 1100/80 system could be expanded to a maximum of two CAUs, and two IOUs. A later version was expandable to four CAUs and four IOUs. The SIU control panel of the updated 1100/80 (pictured above) was able to logically and physically partition larger Multi-Processor configurations into completely independent systems, each with its separate Operating System. The CAU was capable of executing both 36-bit 1100 series instructions, and 30-bit 490 series instructions. The CAU contained the same basic register stack, in the first 128 words of addressable memory, as previous generations of 1100 Series machines, but since these registers were implemented with the same ECL chips as the rest of the system, the registers did not require parity to be generated/checked with each write/read. The IOU, or Input/Output Unit was modular in design and could be configured with different Channel Modules to support varying I/O requirements. The Word Channel Module included four 1100 Series (parallel) Word Channels. Block Multiplexer and Byte Channel Modules allowed direct connection of high-speed disk/tape systems, and low speed printers, etc. respectively. The Control/Maintenance Panel was now on the SIU, and provided a minimum of indicator/buttons since the system incorporated a mini-computer, based on the BC/7 (business computer) as a maintenance processor. This was used to load microcode, and for diagnostic purposes. The CAU, IOU, and SIU units were implemented using emitter-coupled logic (ECL) on high density multi-layer PC boards. The ECL circuitry utilized DC voltages of +0 and -2 volts, with the CAU requiring four 50 amp -2 volt power supplies. Power was 400 Hz, to reduce large scale DC power supplies. The 400 Hz power was supplied by a motor/alternator, because even though solid state 400 Hz inverters were available, they were not considered reliable enough to meet the system uptime requirements.
An 1100/84 Multiprocessor 4x2 system, in two clusters (could be &quot;partitioned&quot; into two separate systems), including four CPU cabinets, two IOU cabinets, two SIU buffer storage units (16K words each) and 2,096K words of Main Memory (backing storage) in four cabinets, two System Maintenance Units (SMU), two Motor Alternators, a transition unit, and two System Consoles at list price was $5,414,871. in October 1980. This configuration could be rented for $127,764 per month, or leased (5 year) for $95,844 per month. Monthly maintenance was $10,235 on this configuration. It was fairly common to discount list prices for large and/or Government customers.

The UNIVAC 1100/60 was introduced in 1979. It replaced the 1108/1106-based 1100/10 and 1100/20 systems.

The 1100/60 System was available in both Single Processor 1100/61 (Model C1) and Dual Processor 1100/62 (Model H1) configurations. It was implemented using custom Sperry Univac designed Micro-Processor Integrated Circuits. Main Storage (524K to 1048K) words per CPU, optional Semiconductor Buffer Storage (up to 8K words per CPU), and the Input/Output Unit (IOU) were contained in CPU cabinet. The IOU (optionally) supported both Block and Word Channels. The system also included a System Support Processor for diagnostic testing and system console support.

An 1100/62 Model E1 (upgraded version) – Medium Performance Multiprocessor Complex – two CPUs with 2K Buffer Storage, two IOUs with one Block Mux, and one Word Channel module (four channels), 1048K words of Main Storage, two System Support Processors, two System Consoles, and a Maintenance Console listed for $889,340. in March 1980. This configuration could be rented for $21,175 per month, or leased (5 year) for $16,780 per month. Monthly maintenance was $3,000 on this configuration. As with the 1100/80 System discounting was common for large and/or Government customers.

The UNIVAC 1100/70 was introduced in 1981. The technology was an upgraded version of the 1100/60 design. It replaced the 1110-based 1100/40 systems.

The UNIVAC 1100/90 was introduced in 1982. As with the 1100/80, it was available with up to four processors, and four I/O units. It was the largest, and final, member of the 1100 Series, and was the only system to be liquid-cooled.
The Sperry Integrated Scientific Processor (ISP) is an attachment to the 1100/90.

==UNISYS ClearPath IX series==
In 1996, Unisys introduced the ClearPath IX series. The ClearPath machines are a common platform that implement either the 1100/2200 architecture (the ClearPath IX series) or the Burroughs large systems architecture (the ClearPath NX series). Everything is common except the actual CPUs, which are implemented as ASICs. In addition to the IX (1100/2200) CPUs and the NX (Burroughs large systems) CPU, the architecture had Xeon (and briefly Itanium) CPUs. Unisys&#x27; goal was to provide an orderly transition for their 1100/2200 customers to a more modern architecture.

==Deployments==

A system of traffic control (1964) designed for the Municipality of metropolitan Toronto was a network of traffic signals and traffic detectors connected to a UNIVAC 1107 to automatically analyse the movement of vehicles. 

Sweden used UNIAVAC 1106&#x27;s frontend by UNIVAC 418&#x27;s to implement a national vehicle registration database. This system ran on the 1106 Platform from 1973 to 1981. 

In March 1979 this system consisted of:
* 2 x 1106-II
* 2 x 196KW Memory
* 12 x Magnetic tape units
* 2 x Communication Processors C/SP for Police and demand terminal users
* 9 x FASTRAND-III drums (198 million characters per drum)
* 2 x Frontend UNIVAC 418-II for county council and telex terminals (347 CRT&#x27;s/400 telex)
* 2 x FH1782 drums (12.5m characters per drum)
* 9 x 8433 discs (205m characters per drive)
* 10 x 8440 discs (117m characters per drive)
* 1 x card reader
* 2 x line printers (0770 and 0758) -- 1,200 lines per minute

In 1981 it was upgraded to a UNIVAC 1100/60 platform. and would subsequently be upgraded over many years to a UNISYS XPC-L and later models.

<text>&quot;Arḍu l-Furātayni&quot; (), also known as the &quot;Land of The Two Rivers&quot;, &quot;Ardulfurataini Watan&quot; or &quot;Ardulfurataini&quot;, was the national anthem of Iraq from 1981 to 2003, during the Ba&#x27;athist regime of Saddam Hussein.

==History==


It was adopted in 1981, written by Shafiq al-Kamali (who died in 1984) with music by Walid Georges Gholmieh.

The lyrics make mention of important people in Iraqi history, such as Saladin, Harun al-Rashid, and al-Muthanna ibn Haritha, with the last verse extolling Ba&#x27;athism.

In shortened performances, the chorus was played twice, preceded by an instrumental introduction. Other abridged performances had the chorus twice, then the first verse once, concluding with the chorus performed twice. In full performances, the chorus was sung first twice, then each verse once with the chorus repeated twice in between, then the chorus sung again twice at the end.

After the ousting of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Ba&#x27;athist regime in 2003, the former national anthem of Iraq from the late 1950s and early 1960s, &quot;Mawtini&quot; (not to be confused with the current Iraqi national anthem of the same name) was reintroduced on a provisional basis. That was replaced in 2004 by the new Iraqi government with a new national anthem, also called &quot;Mawtini&quot;, which is currently in use today.

<doc id="201474" wikidata="Q216762" url="?curid=201474" title="Hatchback">
<text>A hatchback is a car body configuration with a rear door that swings upward to provide access to the main interior of the car as a cargo area rather than just to a separated trunk. Hatchbacks may feature fold-down second-row seating, where the interior can be reconfigured to prioritize passenger or cargo volume.

While early examples of the body configuration can be traced to the 1930s, the Merriam-Webster dictionary dates the term itself to 1970. The hatchback body style has been marketed worldwide on cars ranging in size from superminis to small family cars, as well as executive cars and some sports cars. They are a primary component of sport utility vehicles.

== Characteristics ==

The distinguishing feature of a hatchback is a rear door that opens upwards and is hinged at roof level (as opposed to the boot/trunk lid of a saloon/sedan, which is hinged below the rear window). Most hatchbacks use a two-box design body style, where the cargo area (trunk/boot) and passenger areas are a single volume. The rear seats can often be folded down to increase the available cargo area. Hatchbacks may have a removable rigid parcel shelf, or flexible roll-up tonneau cover to cover the cargo space behind the rear seats.

===3 door and 5 door terminology===
When describing the body style, the hatch is often counted as a door, therefore a hatchback with two passenger doors is called a &quot;three-door&quot; and a hatchback with four passenger doors is called a &quot;five-door&quot;.

===Estates vs. liftbacks vs. notchbacks===
Estates/station wagons and liftbacks have in common a two-box design configuration, a shared interior volume for passengers and cargo and a rear door (often called a tailgate in the case of an estate/wagon) that is hinged at roof level, similar to hatchbacks. Liftback cars are similar to hatchbacks from a functional perspective in having a tailgate hinged from the roof, but differ from hatchbacks from a styling perspective in having more of a sloped roofline. The term &quot;fastback&quot; may sometimes also be used by manufacturers to market liftback cars. A fastback is a broad automotive term used to describe the styling of the rear of a car in having a single slope from the roof to the rear bumper.

Some hatchbacks are notchback three box designs, bearing a resemblance to sedans/saloons from a styling perspective, but being closer to hatchbacks in functionality by having a tailgate hinged from the roof. This is featured on cars such as the 1951 Kaiser-Frazer Vagabond, Simca 1100, Mazda 6 GG1, and Opel Vectra C. As such, notchbacks are not fastbacks, as the slope of the roofline on a notchback is interrupted by its three-box design.

An estate/wagon typically differs from a liftback or hatchback by being longer (therefore more likely to have a D-pillar). Other potential differences of a station wagon include:
* steeper rake at the rear (i.e. the rear door is more vertical)
* a third row of seats
* rear suspension designed for increased load capacity or to minimize intrusion into the cargo area
* the tailgate is more likely to be a multi-part design or extend down to the bumper

===Liftback===

&quot;Liftback&quot; is a term for hatchback models in which the rear cargo door or hatch is more horizontally angled than on an average hatchback, and as a result, the hatch is lifted more upwards than backward, to open.

The term was first used by Toyota in 1973, to describe the Toyota Celica Liftback GT.


Later, Toyota needed to distinguish between two 5-door versions of the Toyota Corolla, one of which was a conventional 5-door hatchback with a nearly vertical rear hatch while the other one was a 5-door more horizontal hatch, for which the term &quot;Liftback&quot; was used.

Saab called similar body style of their cars combi coupé, starting from 1974. 

== History ==
=== History ===
The first production hatchback was made by Citroën in 1938: the (11CV) &quot;Commerciale&quot; version of their 1934–1957 Citroën Traction Avant series. The initial target market was tradesmen who needed to carry bulky objects, like butchers, bakers, vintners, and grocers. Before World War II, the tailgate had two pieces, a top section hinged from roof level and a bottom section hinged from below. When production of the Commerciale resumed after the war, the tailgate became a one-piece design that was hinged from roof level, as per the design used on most hatchbacks since.

In 1949, Kaiser-Frazer introduced the Vagabond and Traveler hatchbacks. These models were styled much like a typical 1940s sedan, fully retaining their three-box profile; however, they included a two-piece tailgate as per the first Citroën 11CV Commerciale. The Vagabond and Traveler models also had folding rear seats and a shared volume for the passengers and cargo. The design was neither fully a sedan nor a station wagon, but the folding rear seat provided for a large, long interior cargo area. These Kaiser-Frazer models have been described as &quot;America&#x27;s First Hatchback&quot;.

The British Motor Corporation (BMC) launched a &#x27;Countryman&#x27; version of the Austin A40 Farina twobox economy car in 1959. Just like its A30 and A35 Countryman predecessors, it was a very small estate car — but instead of regular, sideways opening rear doors, it had a horizontally split tailgate, having a top-hinged upper door and bottom-hinged lower door. The 1959 A40 Countryman differed from the 1958 A40 Farina saloon, in that the rear window was marginally smaller, to allow for a frame that could be lifted with roof-mounted hinges and side support struts so that the car now incorporated a horizontal-split two-piece tailgate. The lower panel was now flush with the floor and its bottom-mounted hinges were strengthened.

===Sports cars===
In 1953, Aston Martin marketed the DB2 with a top-hinged rear tailgate, manufacturing 700 examples. Its successor, the 1958 DB Mark III, also offered a folding rear seat. The 1954 AC Aceca and later Aceca-Bristol from AC Cars had a similar hatch tailgate, though only 320 were built.

In 1965, MG had Pininfarina modify the MGB roadster into a hatchback design called the MGB GT, becoming the first volume-production sports car with this type of body.

Many coupés have 3 doors, including the Jaguar E-Type and Datsun 240Z.
=== Mass market acceptance ===
In 1961, Renault introduced the Renault 4 as a moderately upscale alternative to the Citroën 2CV. The Renault 4 was the first million-selling, mass-produced, compact two-box car with a steeply raked rear side, opened by a large, one-piece, lift-gate hatch.

During its production life cycle, Renault marketed the R4 calling it a small station wagon, just like Austin&#x27;s series of small Countryman estate models from 1954 until 1968 – even after the term &quot;hatchback&quot; appeared around 1970. The company only offered one &quot;two-box&quot; body style. The Renault 4 continued in production through 1992, selling over 8 million cars.

In 1965, the R4 economy car was complemented by the D-segment Renault 16, the first volume production two-box, hatchback family car. Its rear seats were adjustable, would fold down, or could be completely removed. The Renault 16 was successful in a market segment previously exclusively populated by notchback sedans and, despite making only one body style for 15 years, consumers purchased over 1 million R16s.

=== Modern hatchbacks ===
Unlike the Renault 4, which had a semi-integrated body, mounted on a platform chassis, and a front mid-mounted and longitudinally placed engine behind the front axle, the 1967 Simca 1100, which followed in the footsteps of the 1959 BMC Mini with front-wheel drive, a more space-efficient transverse engine layout, unitary bodywork, and independent suspension (features which became key design concepts used by almost every mass-market family car since) - and it was the first hatchback with these features. The Simca 1100 also came in both three and five-door variants, and the hatchback models took a central position, traditionally taken up by saloons, in a full model line-up, completed by a station wagon, as well as panel van versions.

Also in 1967, Citroën released the Dyane, a redesigned 2CV with a large rear hatch, to compete with the Renault 4.

The Simca was closely followed by Mini&#x27;s larger stablemate, the Austin Maxi. Counting the rear hatch made it a five-door saloon. It featured a transverse-mounted SOHC engine, a five-speed transmission, and a flexible seating arrangement which gave the option of forming a double bed. Created by the same designer as BMC&#x27;s Mini, sir Alec Issigonis – accountants had determined that the car had to use the same set of doors as the Austin / Morris 1800, but would be marketed below it in the model range, so needed a shorter rear body. A curtailed rear end with a big hatch resulted. The Austin Maxi operated in the same market segment as the Renault 16, and the two competitors were closely matched in specifications and exterior dimensions, although the Maxi had significantly more interior space due to its transverse engine.

In 1974, the Volkswagen Golf was introduced, intended to replace the ubiquitous Beetle.

In 1976 British Leyland introduced the Rover 3500, a rear wheel drive executive car five-door hatchback.

===Europe===
Increasing demand for compact hatchbacks in Europe during the 1970s led to the release of models such as the Austin Ambassador, Austin Maestro, Fiat 127 and Renault 5. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, the majority of superminis and compact cars had been updated or replaced with hatchback models.

Hatchbacks were the mainstay of manufacturers&#x27; D-segment offerings in Europe in the 1990s (they were already popular in the 1980s) and until the late 2000s. It was common for manufacturers to offer the same D-segment model in three different body styles: a 4-door sedan, a 5-door hatchback, and a 5-door station wagon. Such models included the Ford Mondeo, the Mazda 626/Mazda6, the Nissan Primera, the Opel Vectra/Insignia, and the Toyota Carina/Avensis. There were also models in this market segment available only as a 5-door hatchback or a 4-door sedan, and models available only as a 5-door hatchback or a 5-door station wagon. Often the hatchback and the sedan shared the same wheelbase and the same overall length, and the full rear overhang length of a conventional sedan trunk was retained on the five-door hatchback version of the car.

The 1989-2000 Citroën XM and second-generation Skoda Superb (2008-2015) are cars that blur the line between hatchbacks and sedans. They feature an innovative &quot;Twindoor&quot; trunk lid. It can be opened like in a sedan, using the hinges located below the rear glass; or together with the rear glass, like in a hatchback, using the hinges at the roof.

Audi and BMW introduced hatchbacks in 2009, but marketed them as &quot;Sportback&quot; (Audi) or &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;/&quot;Gran Coupe&quot; (BMW).

In the 2010s hatchback versions became available on luxury cars such as the BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo, Porsche Panamera, and Audi A7 while the Skoda Octavia was always available as a hatchback. Meanwhile, three-door hatchbacks have seen a fall in popularity, compared with 5-door models. This has led to many models no longer being offered in 3-door body styles, for example, the Audi A3 and Renault Clio.
===North America===
In 1970, American Motors Corporation (AMC) released the first North American subcompact car since the 1953-1961 Nash Metropolitan, the AMC Gremlin. Although the Gremlin has the appearance of a hatchback, it is frequently called a Kammback coupe instead, with only its rear window being an upwards opening hatch, that gives access to the rear cargo space. The Gremlin was based on the AMC Hornet, but its abrupt hatchback rear end cut the car&#x27;s overall length from . AMC added a hatchback version to its larger compact-sized Hornet line for the 1973 model year. The design and fold-down rear seat more than doubled cargo space and the Hornet was claimed to be the &quot;first compact hatchback&quot; manufactured by U.S. automaker. The 1975 Pacer featured a rear door or hatchback. A longer model with a wagon-type configuration was added in 1977 with its large rear &quot;hatch&quot; as one of the car&#x27;s three doors, all having different sizes. The 1979 AMC Spirit was available in two designs, a &quot;sedan&quot; with a rear lift up window and a semi-fastback &quot;liftback&quot; version.

General Motors&#x27; first hatchback model was the Chevrolet Vega, introduced in September 1970. Over a million Vega hatchbacks were produced for the 1971–1977 model years accounting for about half of the Vega&#x27;s total production. The Vega hatchback was also rebadged and sold as the 1973–1977 Pontiac Astre, 1978 Chevrolet Monza S, 1975–1980 Buick Skyhawk, 1975–1980 Oldsmobile Starfire and 1977–1980 Pontiac Sunbird.

In 1974, the larger Chevrolet Nova became available in a hatchback body style. The Nova hatchback was also rebadged as the Chevrolet Concours, Pontiac Ventura, Pontiac Phoenix, Oldsmobile Omega, Buick Apollo, and Buick Skylark. In 1980, General Motors released its first front-wheel drive hatchback models, the Chevrolet Citation and Pontiac Phoenix.

Both AMC and GM offered a dealer accessory that turned their compact hatchback models into low-cost recreational vehicles. An example is the Mini-Camper Kit for the AMC Hornet, a low-priced canvas tent that converted an open hatchback into a camping compartment with room for sleeping. The &quot;Mini-Camper&quot; was a weatherproof covering that fitted over the roof section from the B-pillar back to the rear bumper that was easy to set up.

Ford Motor Company&#x27;s first hatchback was the Ford Pinto Runabout, introduced in 1971. The Pinto-based 1974-1978 Ford Mustang II was offered as a hatchback. The body style was continued for the redesigned Fox platform-based 1979 third generation Mustang and the Mercury Capri derivative. For 1981, Ford offered hatchback versions of its sub-compact Escort and the badge-engineered Mercury Lynx, which were now front-wheel drive. Two-seat hatchback derivatives were introduced for 1982, the Ford EXP and the Mercury LN-7.

Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s first hatchbacks (and first front-wheel drive cars) were the 1978 Dodge Omni / Plymouth Horizon models, which were based on the French Simca-Talbot Horizon. These were followed by the 3-door hatchback Dodge Omni 024 / Plymouth Horizon TC3 which were later renamed Dodge Charger and Plymouth Turismo.
===Japan===
The first Japanese hatchbacks were the 1972 Honda Civic, Nissan Sunny, and Nissan Cherry. The Civic and Cherry had front-wheel drive powertrains, which later became the common configuration for a hatchback. Along with the Honda Civic, other Japanese hatchback models included the Nissan Pulsar, Toyota Corolla, and Suzuki Swift.

Almost all Japanese Kei cars (&quot;city cars&quot;) use a hatchback body style, to maximize cargo capacity given the overall vehicle size is limited by the regulations applicable to these vehicles. Kei cars include the Mitsubishi Minica, Honda Life, Suzuki Fronte, Subaru Vivio, and Daihatsu Mira.
===USSR===
The first Soviet hatchback was the rear-wheel drive IZh 2125 Kombi, which entered production in 1973. This was followed only in the 1980s by the front-wheel drive Lada Samara in 1984, the Moskvitch 2141/Aleko in 1986, and ZAZ Tavria in 1987.
=== Brazil ===
In 2014, four of the top five selling models in Brazil were hatchbacks. However, in the 1980s and 1990s, hatchbacks were less popular than sedans, leading manufacturers to develop compact sedan models for the Brazilian market, for example, the Fiat Premio and sedan versions of the Opel Corsa and Ford Fiesta.
===India===

The vehicle is classified as a B-segment marque in the European single market, a segment referred to as a supermini in the British Isles. Prior to this, the &quot;Swift&quot; nameplate had been applied to the rebadged Suzuki Cultus in numerous export markets since 1984 and for the Japanese-market Suzuki Ignis since 2000. The Swift became its own model in 2004. Currently, the Swift is positioned between Ignis and Baleno in Suzuki&#x27;s global 

===Australia===
Holden produced the Torana Hatchback from 1976 to 1980 across the LX and UC generations. Up until recent years, buyers in Australia have preferred the station wagon body style, with the big three Australian manufacturers; Holden, Ford Australia, and Chrysler Australia all producing station wagon models of their sedan models. Australia started moving to hatchbacks partially in the mid-1990s with relatively cheap offerings from Hyundai and Honda. Australia now sells mostly hatchbacks, after the last domestic-built wagon, the Holden Commodore Sportwagon ceased production in October 2017.

The Ford Laser hatchback was produced in Australia. Nissan produced the Pulsar and Pintara hatchbacks and Mitsubishi built the Colt hatch. Toyota produced the Corolla hatchback, and more recently Holden produced the Cruze Hatchback.

<doc id="201479" wikidata="Q3273339" url="?curid=201479" title="Syngas">
<text>Syngas, or synthesis gas, is a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, in various ratios. The gas often contains some carbon dioxide and methane. It is principally used for producing ammonia or methanol. Syngas is combustible and can be used as a fuel. Historically, it has been used as a replacement for gasoline, when gasoline supply has been limited; for example, wood gas was used to power cars in Europe during WWII (in Germany alone, half a million cars were built or rebuilt to run on wood gas). 

==Production==
Syngas is produced by steam reforming or partial oxidation of natural gas or liquid hydrocarbons, or coal gasification.



Steam reforming of methane is an endothermic reaction requiring 206 kJ/mol of methane:
In principle, but rarely in practice, biomass and related hydrocarbon feedstocks could be used to generate biogas and biochar in waste-to-energy gasification facilities. The gas generated (mostly methane and carbon dioxide) is sometimes described as &quot;syngas&quot; but its composition differs from syngas. Generation of conventional syngas (mostly H2 and CO) from waste biomass has been explored.

==Composition, pathway for formation, and thermochemistry==
The chemical composition of syngas varies based on the raw materials and the processes. Syngas produced by coal gasification generally is a mixture of 30 to 60% carbon monoxide, 25 to 30% hydrogen, 5 to 15% carbon dioxide, and 0 to 5% methane. It also contains lesser amount of other gases. Syngas has less than half the energy density of natural gas.

The first reaction, between incandescent coke and steam, is strongly endothermic, producing carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (water gas in older terminology). When the coke bed has cooled to a temperature at which the endothermic reaction can no longer proceed, the steam is then replaced by a blast of air.

The second and third reactions then take place, producing an exothermic reaction—forming initially carbon dioxide and raising the temperature of the coke bed—followed by the second endothermic reaction, in which the latter is converted to carbon monoxide. The overall reaction is exothermic, forming &quot;producer gas&quot; (older terminology). Steam can then be re-injected, then air etc., to give an endless series of cycles until the coke is finally consumed. Producer gas has a much lower energy value, relative to water gas, due primarily to dilution with atmospheric nitrogen. Pure oxygen can be substituted for air to avoid the dilution effect, producing gas of much higher calorific value.
In order to produce more hydrogen from this mixture, more steam is added and the water gas shift reaction is carried out:

The hydrogen can be separated from the by pressure swing adsorption (PSA), amine scrubbing, and membrane reactors. A variety of alternative technologies have been investigated, but none are of commercial value. Some variations focus on new stoichiometries such as carbon dioxide plus methane or partial hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. Other research focuses on novel energy sources to drive the processes including electrolysis, solar energy, microwaves, and electric arcs.

Electricity generated from renewable sources is also used to process carbon dioxide and water into syngas through high-temperature electrolysis. This is an attempt to maintain carbon neutrality in the generation process. Audi, in partnership with company named Sunfire, opened a pilot plant in November 2014 to generate e-diesel using this process.

Syngas that is not methanized typically has a lower heating value of 120 BTU/scf. Untreated syngas can be run in hybrid turbines that allow for greater efficiency because of their lower operating temperatures, and extended part lifetime.

==Uses==
Syngas is used as a source of hydrogen as well as a fuel. It is also used to directly reduce iron ore to sponge iron. Chemical uses include the production of methanol which is a precursor to acetic acid and many acetates; liquid fuels and lubricants via the Fischer–Tropsch process and previously the Mobil methanol to gasoline process; ammonia via the Haber process, which converts atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia which is used as a fertilizer; and oxo alcohols via an intermediate aldehyde.

<doc id="201480" wikidata="Q214970" url="?curid=201480" title="Virtuoso">
<text>A virtuoso (from Italian &quot;virtuoso&quot;, or ; Late Latin &quot;virtuosus&quot;; Latin &quot;virtus&quot;; &#x27;virtue&#x27;, &#x27;excellence&#x27; or &#x27;skill&#x27;) is an individual who possesses outstanding talent and technical ability in a particular art or field such as fine arts, music, singing, playing a musical instrument, or composition.

==Meaning==
This word also refers to a person who has cultivated appreciation of artistic excellence, either as a connoisseur or collector. The plural of &quot;virtuoso&quot; is either &quot;virtuosi&quot; or the Anglicisation &quot;virtuosos&quot;, and the feminine forms are &quot;virtuosa&quot; and &quot;virtuose&quot;.

According to &quot;Music in the Western World&quot; by Piero Weiss and Richard Taruskin:
...&quot;A virtuoso was, originally, a highly accomplished musician, but by the nineteenth century the term had become restricted to performers, both vocal and instrumental, whose technical accomplishments were so pronounced as to dazzle the public.&quot;

The defining element of virtuosity is the performance ability of the musician in question, who is capable of displaying feats of skill well above the average performer.

Especially in music, both critics and musicians have mixed opinions on virtuosity. While the skill implied is clearly positive, musicians focused on virtuosity have been criticized for overlooking substance and emotion in favor of raw technical prowess.

More commonly applied in the context of the fine arts, the term can also refer to a &quot;master&quot; or &quot;ace&quot; who excels technically within any particular field or area of human knowledge—anyone especially or dazzlingly skilled at what they do.

==History==
The meaning of virtuoso has its roots in the Italian usage of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, signifying an honorific term reserved for a person distinguished in any intellectual or artistic field. The term evolved with time, simultaneously broadening and narrowing in scope as interpretations went in and out of fashion and debates unraveled. Originally a musician was considered a &quot;virtuoso&quot; by being an accomplished composer, theorist, or maestro, rather than a skilled performer.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the word shifted in meaning, and many musicians applied it without considering merit, sometimes to themselves. Sébastien de Brossard, in his &quot;Dictionnaire de Musique&quot; (Paris, 1703), approached the word virtuoso by its Latin root &quot;virtu&quot; emphasizing exceptional training, especially in theory. This position was also defended in Johann Gottfried Walther&#x27;s &quot;Musicalisches Lexicon&quot; (1732) favoring the theorist over the performer. Johann Mattheson&#x27;s &quot;Der brauchbare Virtuoso&quot; (1720) maintained the respect for the traditional &quot;&quot;theoretische Virtuosen&quot; (theoretical virtuoso) but also paid tribute to the &quot;virtuosi prattici&quot;&quot; (performer virtuoso).

Johann Kuhnau in his &quot;The Musical Charlatan&quot; (&quot;Der musikalische Quack-Salber&quot;, 1700) defined the &quot;true virtuoso&quot;, once again emphasizing theory (&quot;der wahre Virtuose&quot;), while describing the &quot;highly gifted musician&quot; (&quot;der glückselige Musicus&quot;) or &quot;performer virtuoso&quot; as having nothing more than practical facility.

The concept of virtuosity today is typically associated with flashy, technical performance rather than accomplishments as a composer, theorist, etc. Modern virtuosi are known for fast, exciting works and often for using their talents in spaces like international competitions. While historical virtuosi like Niccolò Paganini and Franz Liszt were performers as well as composers, a 21st-century virtuosi is primarily a performing musician.

As virtuosic playing has gained popularity over the centuries, more exciting music has ingrained itself into the culture in unique ways. Many music pedagogues emphasize technique in private teaching as a way to approach modern, virtuosic repertoire. Additionally, much of classical music that becomes popular among non-musicians tends to lean into difficult, flashy styles.

=== Early views on virtuosity in music ===
In the late 18th century, people began to use the term to describe an instrumentalist or vocalist who pursued a career as a soloist. The tension about the merit of practical virtuosity started to grow at the same time and intensified in the 19th century, only to remain an open debate since then. Franz Liszt, considered one of the greatest of all virtuosos, declared that &quot;virtuosity is not an outgrowth, but an indispensable element of music&quot; (&quot;Gesammelte Schriften&quot;, iv, 1855–9). Richard Wagner opposed the &quot;triviality and exhibitionist talents of the performer&quot; voicing his opinion strongly:&quot;The real dignity of the virtuoso rests solely on the dignity he is able to preserve for creative art; if he or she trifles and toys with this, he casts his honour away. He or she is the intermediary of the artistic idea.&quot;In the nineteenth century, the public beliefs and attitudes surrounding virtuosity in music greatly varied. Many believed that it was essential for success, while others believed it was a detriment. The celebrity status obtained by such performers was often fueled by tabloid-like rumors, mythical comparisons, and manipulative marketing tactics. On one such occasion, a London theatre critic referred to a Paganini concert as his &quot;fifth and final concert.&quot; Purposefully presenting misinformation to gain publicity for the performers became a regular occurrence.

<text>Gettysburg National Cemetery, originally called Soldiers&#x27; National Cemetery, is a United States national cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, created for Union army casualties sustained in the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. The Battle of Gettysburg was fought over three days between July 1 to 3, 1863, and proved both the Civil War&#x27;s deadliest and most significant battle. It resulted in over 50,000 casualties, the most of any battle in both the Civil War and all of American military history. But the battle also proved to be the war&#x27;s turning point, turning the Civil War decisively in the Union&#x27;s favor and leading ultimately to the nation&#x27;s preservation.

On November 19, 1863, four and a half months after the Battle of Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln, the 16th U.S. president, traveled to Gettysburg National Cemetery, where he participated in a ceremonial consecration of it and delivered the Gettysburg Address, which is now considered one of the most famous and historically significant speeches in American history. The day of Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address is observed annually at the cemetery and in Gettysburg as &quot;Remembrance Day&quot;, which includes a parade, procession, and memorial ceremonies by thousands of Civil War reenactor troops representing both Union and Confederate armies and descendant heritage organizations led by the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (SUVCW) and the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV).

The cemetery contains 3,512 interments from the Civil War, including the graves of 979 unknowns. It also has sections for veterans of subsequent wars, including the Spanish–American War (1898), World War I (1917–1918), and others, and includes graves of the veterans&#x27; spouses and children. The total number of interments exceeds 6,000.

Battlefield monuments, memorials, and markers are scattered throughout the cemetery, and its stone walls, iron fences and gates, burial and section markers, and brick sidewalk are listed as contributing structures within Gettysburg Battlefield Historic District.

The land on which the cemetery is located was part of the Gettysburg Battlefield, and the cemetery is within Gettysburg National Military Park, which is administered by the National Park Service, a U.S. government agency administered by the U.S. Department of Interior.

==Description==
The centerpiece of Gettysburg National Cemetery is Soldiers&#x27; National Monument (1869), a 60-foot-tall (18 m) granite monument designed by sculptor Randolph Rogers and architect George Keller. It is surrounded by concentric semicircles of graves, divided into 18 sections for Union states (1 each), a section for United States Regulars, and three sections for unknown soldiers.

Battlefield monuments within Gettysburg National Cemetery include those of the 1st United States Artillery Battery H, the 2nd Maine Battery, the 1st Massachusetts Battery (Cook&#x27;s Battery), the 1st Minnesota Infantry, the 1st New Hampshire Light Battery, the 5th New York Independent Light Artillery, the 136th New York Volunteer Infantry, the 1st Ohio Battery H, the 55th Ohio Infantry, the 73rd Ohio Infantry, and the 75th Pennsylvania Infantry; and markers for the 1st Ohio Battery I and the 3rd Volunteer Brigade Artillery Reserve (Huntington&#x27;s Brigade). Other monuments include the New York State Monument (1893), the Kentucky State Monument (1975), the Lincoln Address Monument (1912), the Friend to Friend Masonic Memorial (1994), the Major-General John F. Reynolds Statue (1872), and the Major-General Charles Collis Memorial (1906).

==History==
In 1863, William Saunders was selected by a committee of Union governors to design the Soldiers National Cemetery. Saunders&#x27; radial plan of &quot;simple grandeur,&quot; grouped the Union dead by states and focused on a central monument. The graves were marked with simple, unadorned, rectangular slabs of gray granite inscribed with the name, rank, company, and regiment of each soldier. Saunders noted in his description of the design that this repetition of &quot;objects in themselves simple and common place&quot; was meant to evoke a sense of &quot;solemnity&quot; which &quot;is an attribute of the sublime.&quot; Officers and enlisted men were buried alongside one another to symbolize the egalitarian nature of the Union Army, which consisted mostly of volunteer citizen soldiers.

===Reinterments===
Union remains were transferred from the Gettysburg Battlefield burial plots, local church cemeteries, field hospital burial sites, including Camp Letterman, Rock Creek-White Run Union Hospital Complex, USA General Hospital, and the &quot;Valley of Death&quot; below Little Round Top, where unburied soldiers decomposed in place. Samuel Weaver, as &quot;Superintendent of the exhuming of the bodies&quot;, personally observed the contractor&#x27;s workers opening graves, placing remains in coffins, and burying them in the cemetery, and at least one reinterment from neighboring Evergreen Cemetery.

<text>Dame Barbara Mary Quant (11 February 1930 – 13 April 2023) was a British fashion designer and icon. She became an instrumental figure in the 1960s London-based Mod and youth fashion movements, and played a prominent role in London&#x27;s Swinging Sixties culture. She was one of the designers who took credit for the miniskirt and hotpants. Ernestine Carter wrote: &quot;It is given to a fortunate few to be born at the right time, in the right place, with the right talents. In recent fashion there are three: Chanel, Dior, and Mary Quant.&quot;

==Early life==
Barbara Mary Quant was born on 11 February 1930 in Woolwich, London, the daughter of Jack Quant and Mildred Jones. Her parents, who both came from Welsh mining families, had received scholarships to a grammar school and had been awarded first-class honours degrees at Cardiff University before moving to London to work as schoolteachers. She had a younger brother, John Antony Quant (who became a dental officer in the Royal Air Force), with whom she was evacuated to Kent during the Second World War.

Quant attended Blackheath High School. For college, her desire had been to study fashion; however, her parents dissuaded her from that course of study, and she instead studied illustration and art education at Goldsmiths College for which she received a degree in 1953. In pursuit of her love for fashion, after finishing her degree, she was apprenticed to Erik Braagaard, a high-class Mayfair milliner on Brook Street next door to Claridge&#x27;s Hotel.

==Fashion career==

Quant was introduced to Archie McNair, who owned a photography business on the King&#x27;s Road, through a mutual friend. He and Alexander Plunket worked with Quant to purchase Markham House, the shopfront that would be the location of her clothing boutique, Bazaar. The two men both contributed financially to the project, and Markham House was purchased for £8,000. During the renovation, Quant worked to locate wholesale suppliers, with a salary of £5 per week. Once the shop opened, Quant initially sold clothing sourced from wholesalers in her new boutique in the King&#x27;s Road. The bolder pieces in her collection started garnering more attention from media like &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, and an American manufacturer purchased some of her dress designs. Because of this attention and her personal love for these bolder styles, she decided to take designs into her own hands. Initially working solo, she was soon employing a handful of machinists; by 1966 she was working with a total of 18 manufacturers. A self-taught designer inspired by the culture-forward &quot;Chelsea Set&quot; of artists and socialites, Quant&#x27;s designs were riskier than standard styles of the time. Quant&#x27;s designs revolutionised fashion from the utilitarian wartime standard of the late 1940s to the energy of the 1950s and 1960s&#x27; cultural shifts. She stocked her own original items in an array of colours and patterns, such as colourful tights.

Quant&#x27;s impact did not just come from her unique designs; in her boutique she created a special environment, including music, drinks, and long hours that appealed to young adults. This environment was unique for the industry, as it differentiated from the stale department stores and inaccessible high-class designer store environments that had a hold of the fashion market. Her window displays with models in quirky poses brought a lot of attention to her boutique, where people would often stop to stare at the eccentric displays. She stated that &quot;Within 10 days, we hardly had a piece of the original merchandise left.&quot;

For a while in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Quant was one of only two London-based high-class designers consistently offering youthful clothes for young people. The other was Kiki Byrne, who opened her boutique on the King&#x27;s Road in direct competition with Quant.

In 1966, Quant was named one of the &quot;fashion revolutionaries&quot; in New York by &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;, alongside Edie Sedgwick, Tiger Morse, Pierre Cardin, Paco Rabanne, Rudi Gernreich, André Courrèges, Emanuel Ungaro, Yves Saint Laurent and Baby Jane Holzer.

===Quant and the miniskirt===
The miniskirt, described as one of the defining fashions of the 1960s, is one of the garments most widely associated with Quant. While she is often cited as the inventor of the style, this claim has been challenged by others. Marit Allen, a contemporary fashion journalist and editor of the influential &quot;Young Ideas&quot; pages for UK &quot;Vogue&quot;, firmly stated that another British fashion designer, John Bates, rather than Quant or André Courrèges, was the original creator of the miniskirt. Others credit Courrèges with the invention of the style. 

However, skirts had been getting shorter since the 1950s, and had reached the knee by the early sixties, but &quot;Quant wanted them higher so they would be less restricting—they allowed women to run for a bus ... and were much, much sexier&quot;.

Quant later said: &quot;It was the girls on the King&#x27;s Road [during the &quot;Swinging London&quot; scene] who invented the miniskirt. I was making easy, youthful, simple clothes, in which you could move, in which you could run and jump and we would make them the length the customer wanted. I wore them very short and the customers would say, &#x27;Shorter, shorter.&#x27;&quot; She gave the miniskirt its name, after her favourite make of car, the Mini, and said of its wearers: &quot;They are curiously feminine, but their femininity lies in their attitude rather than in their appearance ... She enjoys being noticed, but wittily. She is lively—positive—opinionated.&quot; The fashion model Twiggy popularised the miniskirt abroad.

In addition to the miniskirt, Quant is often credited with inventing the coloured and patterned tights that tended to accompany the garment, although their creation is also attributed to the Spanish couturier Cristóbal Balenciaga, who offered harlequin-patterned tights in 1962, or to John Bates.

==Later career==
In the late 1960s, Quant offered miniskirts that were the forerunner of hotpants and became a British fashion icon. In 1967 she designed berets in twelve colours for British headwear company Kangol. Quant&#x27;s berets, featuring her daisy logo, are in her collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Through the 1970s and 1980s she concentrated on household goods and make-up rather than just her clothing lines, including the duvet, which she claimed to have invented.

In 1988, Quant designed the interior of the Mini (1000) Designer (originally dubbed the Mini Quant, the name was changed when popularity charts were set against having Quant&#x27;s name on the car). It featured black-and-white striped seats with red trimming. The seatbelts were red, and the driving and passenger seats had Quant&#x27;s signature on the upper left quadrant. The steering-wheel had Quant&#x27;s signature daisy and the bonnet badge had &quot;Mary Quant&quot; written over the signature name. The headlight housings, wheel arches, door handles and bumpers were all &quot;nimbus grey&quot;, rather than the more common chrome or black finishes. Two thousand were released in the UK on 15 June 1988, and a number were also released on to foreign markets; however, the numbers for these are hard to come by. The special edition Mini came in two body colours, jet black and diamond white.

In 2000, she resigned as director of Mary Quant Ltd, her cosmetics company, after a Japanese buy-out. There are more than 200 Mary Quant Colour shops in Japan.

==Personal life==
Quant met her future husband and business partner, Alexander Plunket Greene, grandson of the Irish singer Harry Plunket Greene, in 1953. They were married from 1957 until his death in 1990, and had a son, Orlando, born in 1970.

Quant died at home in Surrey on 13 April 2023, aged 93.

==Honours and recognition==

In 1963, Quant was the first winner of the Dress of the Year award. In the 1966 Birthday Honours she was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). She arrived at Buckingham Palace to accept the award in a cream wool jersey minidress with blue facings.
In 1990 she won the Hall of Fame Award of the British Fashion Council.
She was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to British fashion. She was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2023 New Year Honours for services to fashion.

Quant received an honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2006. In 2009, the miniskirt designed by Quant was selected by the Royal Mail for their &quot;British Design Classics&quot; commemorative postage stamp issue. In 2012, she was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his lifetime.

Quant was a fellow of the Chartered Society of Designers, and winner of the Minerva Medal, the society&#x27;s highest award.

In the 1966 Donovan song &quot;Sunny South Kensington&quot;, Quant and Jean-Paul Belmondo&#x27;s drug use/abuse is immortalised in the lyric &quot;Jean-Paul Belmondo and-a Mary Quant got stoned, to say the least&quot;.

Quant is referenced in the musical number &quot;This Is What We Want&quot; in the 2014 stage musical &quot;Made in Dagenham&quot;, based on the 2010 film of the same name.

<text>A spotting scope is a compact lightweight portable telescope optimized for detailed observation of distant objects. They are used as tripod mounted optical enhancement devices for various outdoor activities such as birdwatching, skygazing and other naturalist activities, for hunting and target shooting to verify a marksman&#x27;s shot placements, for tactical ranging and surveillance, and for any other application that requires higher magnification than ordinary binoculars (typically 20× to 60×).

The light-gathering power and resolution of a spotting scope is determined by the diameter of the objective lens, typically between . The larger the objective, the more massive and expensive the telescope.

The optical assembly has a small refracting objective lens, an internal image-erecting system, and an eyepiece that is usually removable. The image-erecting system may use relay lenses, prisms such as Porro or roof prisms, or a catadioptric system of the Schmidt or Maksutov design. Spotting scopes may have a ruggedized design, a mounting interface for attaching to a tripod, and an ergonomically designed and located control knob for focus adjustment. Some spotting scopes also have in-built reticles for stadiametric rangefinding.

Spotting scope eyepieces are usually interchangeable to adapt for different magnifications, or may have variable zoom to give a range of magnifications. Magnifications less than 20× are unusual, as are magnifications more than 60× since the latter can lead to poorer image brightness, a narrow field of view and too much image shaking, even on a tripod. The eyepiece mount layout can be &quot;straight-through&quot; (the eyepiece is on the same axis as the scope body), or &quot;angled&quot; (the eyepiece is at an angle to the scope body—usually 45 degrees).

The high magnification of spotting scopes makes them prone to image disturbance from vibrations, so they are often stabilized with tripods or (less commonly) monopods, which provide a stationary and steady platform. Tripod heads can be used to control any required movements of the scope.

<doc id="201485" wikidata="Q2822895" url="?curid=201485" title="Lithium-ion battery">
<text>A lithium-ion or Li-ion battery is a type of rechargeable battery that uses the reversible intercalation of Li+ ions into electronically conducting solids to store energy. In comparison with other commercial rechargeable batteries, Li-ion batteries are characterized by higher specific energy, higher energy density, higher energy efficiency, a longer cycle life, and a longer calendar life. Also noteworthy is a dramatic improvement in lithium-ion battery properties after their market introduction in 1991: over the following 30 years, their volumetric energy density increased threefold while their cost dropped tenfold. In late 2024 global demand passed 1 Terawatt-hour per year, while production capacity was more than twice that.

The invention and commercialization of Li-ion batteries may have had one of the greatest impacts of all technologies in human history, as recognized by the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
More specifically, Li-ion batteries enabled portable consumer electronics, laptop computers, cellular phones, and electric cars. Li-ion batteries also see significant use for grid-scale energy storage as well as military and aerospace applications.

Lithium-ion cells can be manufactured to optimize energy or power density. Handheld electronics mostly use lithium polymer batteries (with a polymer gel as an electrolyte), a lithium cobalt oxide () cathode material, and a graphite anode, which together offer high energy density. Lithium iron phosphate (), lithium manganese oxide ( spinel, or -based lithium-rich layered materials, LMR-NMC), and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide ( or NMC) may offer longer life and a higher discharge rate. NMC and its derivatives are widely used in the electrification of transport, one of the main technologies (combined with renewable energy) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles.

M. Stanley Whittingham conceived intercalation electrodes in the 1970s and created the first rechargeable lithium-ion battery, based on a titanium disulfide cathode and a lithium-aluminium anode, although it suffered from safety problems and was never commercialized. John Goodenough expanded on this work in 1980 by using lithium cobalt oxide as a cathode. The first prototype of the modern Li-ion battery, which uses a carbonaceous anode rather than lithium metal, was developed by Akira Yoshino in 1985 and commercialized by a Sony and Asahi Kasei team led by Yoshio Nishi in 1991. Whittingham, Goodenough, and Yoshino were awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their contributions to the development of lithium-ion batteries.

Lithium-ion batteries can be a fire or explosion hazard as they contain flammable electrolytes. Progress has been made in the development and manufacturing of safer lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion solid-state batteries are being developed to eliminate the flammable electrolyte. recycled batteries can create toxic waste, including from toxic metals, and are a fire risk. Both lithium and other minerals can have significant issues in mining, with lithium being water intensive in often arid regions and other minerals used in some Li-ion chemistries potentially being conflict minerals such as cobalt. Environmental issues have encouraged some researchers to improve mineral efficiency and find alternatives such as lithium iron phosphate lithium-ion chemistries or non-lithium-based battery chemistries like iron-air batteries.

There are at least 12 different chemistries of Li-ion batteries; see &quot;List of battery types.&quot;

== History ==
Research on rechargeable Li-ion batteries dates to the 1960s; one of the earliest examples is a /Li battery developed by NASA in 1965. The breakthrough that produced the earliest form of the modern Li-ion battery was made by British chemist M. Stanley Whittingham in 1974, who first used titanium disulfide () as a cathode material, which has a layered structure that can take in lithium ions without significant changes to its crystal structure. Exxon tried to commercialize this battery in the late 1970s, but found the synthesis expensive and complex, as is sensitive to moisture and releases toxic hydrogen sulfide () gas on contact with water. More prohibitively, the batteries were also prone to spontaneously catch fire due to the presence of metallic lithium in the cells. For this, and other reasons, Exxon discontinued the development of Whittingham&#x27;s lithium-titanium disulfide battery.

In 1980, working in separate groups Ned A. Godshall et al., and, shortly thereafter, Koichi Mizushima and John B. Goodenough, after testing a range of alternative materials, replaced with lithium cobalt oxide (, or LCO), which has a similar layered structure but offers a higher voltage and is much more stable in air. This material would later be used in the first commercial Li-ion battery, although it did not, on its own, resolve the persistent issue of flammability.

These early attempts to develop rechargeable Li-ion batteries used lithium metal anodes, which were ultimately abandoned due to safety concerns, as lithium metal is unstable and prone to dendrite formation, which can cause short-circuiting. The eventual solution was to use an intercalation anode, similar to that used for the cathode, which prevents the formation of lithium metal during battery charging. The first to demonstrate lithium ion reversible intercalation into graphite anodes was Jürgen Otto Besenhard in 1974. Besenhard used organic solvents such as carbonates, however these solvents decomposed rapidly providing short battery cycle life. Later, in 1980, Rachid Yazami used a solid organic electrolyte, polyethylene oxide, which was more stable.

In 1985, Akira Yoshino at Asahi Kasei Corporation discovered that petroleum coke, a less graphitized form of carbon, can reversibly intercalate Li-ions at a low potential of ~0.5 V relative to Li+ /Li without structural degradation. Its structural stability originates from its amorphous carbon regions, which serving as covalent joints to pin the layers together. Although it has a lower capacity compared to graphite (~Li0.5C6, 186 mAh g–1), it became the first commercial intercalation anode for Li-ion batteries owing to its cycling stability. In 1987, Yoshino patented what would become the first commercial lithium-ion battery using this anode. He used Goodenough&#x27;s previously reported LiCoO2 as the cathode and a carbonate ester-based electrolyte. The battery was assembled in the discharged state, which made it safer and cheaper to manufacture. In 1991, using Yoshino&#x27;s design, Sony began producing and selling the world&#x27;s first rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. The following year, a joint venture between Toshiba and Asahi Kasei Co. also released a lithium-ion battery.

Significant improvements in energy density were achieved in the 1990s by replacing Yoshino&#x27;s soft carbon anode first with hard carbon and later with graphite. In 1990, Jeff Dahn and two colleagues at Dalhousie University (Canada) reported reversible intercalation of lithium ions into graphite in the presence of ethylene carbonate solvent (which is solid at room temperature and is mixed with other solvents to make a liquid). This represented the final innovation of the era that created the basic design of the modern lithium-ion battery.
In 2010, global lithium-ion battery production capacity was 20 gigawatt-hours. By 2016, it was 28 GWh, with 16.4 GWh in China. Global production capacity was 767 GWh in 2020, with China accounting for 75%. Production in 2021 is estimated by various sources to be between 200 and 600 GWh, and predictions for 2023 range from 400 to 1,100 GWh.

In 2012, John B. Goodenough, Rachid Yazami and Akira Yoshino received the 2012 IEEE Medal for Environmental and Safety Technologies for developing the lithium-ion battery; Goodenough, Whittingham, and Yoshino were awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for the development of lithium-ion batteries&quot;. Jeff Dahn received the ECS Battery Division Technology Award (2011) and the Yeager award from the International Battery Materials Association (2016).

In April 2023, CATL announced that it would begin scaled-up production of its semi-solid condensed matter battery that produces a then record 500 Wh/kg. They use electrodes made from a gelled material, requiring fewer binding agents. This in turn shortens the manufacturing cycle. One potential application is in battery-powered airplanes. Another new development of lithium-ion batteries are flow batteries with redox-targeted solids, that use no binders or electron-conducting additives, and allow for completely independent scaling of energy and power.

== Design ==


Generally, the negative electrode of a conventional lithium-ion cell is graphite made from carbon. The positive electrode is typically a metal oxide or phosphate. The electrolyte is a lithium salt in an organic solvent. The negative electrode (which is the anode when the cell is discharging) and the positive electrode (which is the cathode when discharging) are prevented from shorting by a separator. The electrodes are connected to the powered circuit through two pieces of metal called current collectors.

The negative and positive electrodes swap their electrochemical roles (anode and cathode) when the cell is charged. Despite this, in discussions of battery design the negative electrode of a rechargeable cell is often just called &quot;the anode&quot; and the positive electrode &quot;the cathode&quot;.

In its fully lithiated state of LiC6, graphite correlates to a theoretical capacity of 1339 coulombs per gram (372 mAh/g). The positive electrode is generally one of three materials: a layered oxide (such as lithium cobalt oxide), a polyanion (such as lithium iron phosphate) or a spinel (such as lithium manganese oxide). More experimental materials include graphene-containing electrodes, although these remain far from commercially viable due to their high cost.

Lithium reacts vigorously with water to form lithium hydroxide (LiOH) and hydrogen gas. Thus, a non-aqueous electrolyte is typically used, and a sealed container rigidly excludes moisture from the battery pack. The non-aqueous electrolyte is typically a mixture of organic carbonates such as ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate containing complexes of lithium ions. Ethylene carbonate is essential for making solid electrolyte interphase on the carbon anode, but since it is solid at room temperature, a liquid solvent (such as propylene carbonate or diethyl carbonate) is added.

The electrolyte salt is almost always lithium hexafluorophosphate (), which combines good ionic conductivity with chemical and electrochemical stability. The hexafluorophosphate anion is essential for passivating the aluminium current collector used for the positive electrode. A titanium tab is ultrasonically welded to the aluminium current collector.
Other salts like lithium perchlorate (), lithium tetrafluoroborate (), and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide () are frequently used in research in tab-less coin cells, but are not usable in larger format cells, often because they are not compatible with the aluminium current collector. Copper (with a spot-welded nickel tab) is used as the current collector at the negative electrode.

Current collector design and surface treatments may take various forms: foil, mesh, foam (dealloyed), etched (wholly or selectively), and coated (with various materials) to improve electrical characteristics.

Depending on materials choices, the voltage, energy density, life, and safety of a lithium-ion cell can change dramatically. Current effort has been exploring the use of novel architectures using nanotechnology to improve performance. Areas of interest include nano-scale electrode materials and alternative electrode structures.

=== Electrochemistry ===

The reactants in the electrochemical reactions in a lithium-ion cell are the materials of the electrodes, both of which are compounds containing lithium atoms. Although many thousands of different materials have been investigated for use in lithium-ion batteries, only a very small number are commercially usable. All commercial Li-ion cells use intercalation compounds as active materials. The negative electrode is usually graphite, although silicon is often mixed in to increase the capacity. The electrolyte is usually lithium hexafluorophosphate, dissolved in a mixture of organic carbonates. A number of different materials are used for the positive electrode, such as LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides.

During cell discharge the negative electrode is the anode and the positive electrode the cathode: electrons flow from the anode to the cathode through the external circuit. An oxidation half-reaction at the anode produces positively charged lithium ions and negatively charged electrons. The oxidation half-reaction may also produce uncharged material that remains at the anode. Lithium ions move through the electrolyte; electrons move through the external circuit toward the cathode where they recombine with the cathode material in a reduction half-reaction. The electrolyte provides a conductive medium for lithium ions but does not partake in the electrochemical reaction. The reactions during discharge lower the chemical potential of the cell, so discharging transfers energy from the cell to wherever the electric current dissipates its energy, mostly in the external circuit.

During charging these reactions and transports go in the opposite direction: electrons move from the positive electrode to the negative electrode through the external circuit. To charge the cell the external circuit has to provide electrical energy. This energy is then stored as chemical energy in the cell (with some loss, e. g., due to coulombic efficiency lower than 1).

Both electrodes allow lithium ions to move in and out of their structures with a process called &quot;insertion&quot; (&quot;intercalation&quot;) or &quot;extraction&quot; (&quot;deintercalation&quot;), respectively.

As the lithium ions &quot;rock&quot; back and forth between the two electrodes, these batteries are also known as &quot;rocking-chair batteries&quot; or &quot;swing batteries&quot; (a term given by some European industries).

The following equations exemplify the chemistry (left to right: discharging, right to left: charging).

The negative electrode half-reaction for the graphite is
: &lt;chem&gt;LiC6 &lt;=&gt; C6 + Li+ + e^-&lt;/chem&gt;

The positive electrode half-reaction in the lithium-doped cobalt oxide substrate is
: &lt;chem&gt;CoO2 + Li+ + e- &lt;=&gt; LiCoO2&lt;/chem&gt;

The full reaction being
: &lt;chem&gt;LiC6 + CoO2 &lt;=&gt; C6 + LiCoO2&lt;/chem&gt;

The overall reaction has its limits. Overdischarging supersaturates lithium cobalt oxide, leading to the production of lithium oxide, possibly by the following irreversible reaction:

: &lt;chem&gt;Li+ + e^- + LiCoO2 -&gt; Li2O + CoO&lt;/chem&gt;

Overcharging up to 5.2 volts leads to the synthesis of cobalt (IV) oxide, as evidenced by x-ray diffraction:

: &lt;chem&gt;LiCoO2 -&gt; Li+ + CoO2 + e^-&lt;/chem&gt;

The transition metal in the positive electrode, cobalt (Co), is reduced from to during discharge, and oxidized from to during charge.

The cell&#x27;s energy is equal to the voltage times the charge. Each gram of lithium represents Faraday&#x27;s constant/6.941, or 13,901 coulombs. At 3 V, this gives 41.7 kJ per gram of lithium, or 11.6 kWh per kilogram of lithium. This is slightly more than the heat of combustion of gasoline; however, lithium-ion batteries as a whole are still significantly heavier per unit of energy due to the additional materials used in production.

Note that the cell voltages involved in these reactions are larger than the potential at which an aqueous solutions would electrolyze.

=== Discharging and charging ===

During discharge, lithium ions () carry the current within the battery cell from the negative to the positive electrode, through the non-aqueous electrolyte and separator diaphragm.

During charging, an external electrical power source applies an over-voltage (a voltage greater than the cell&#x27;s own voltage) to the cell, forcing electrons to flow from the positive to the negative electrode. The lithium ions also migrate (through the electrolyte) from the positive to the negative electrode where they become embedded in the porous electrode material in a process known as intercalation.

Energy losses arising from electrical contact resistance at interfaces between electrode layers and at contacts with current collectors can be as high as 20% of the entire energy flow of batteries under typical operating conditions.

The charging procedures for single Li-ion cells, and complete Li-ion batteries, are slightly different:

* A single Li-ion cell is charged in two stages:
# Constant current (CC)
# Constant voltage (CV)
* A Li-ion battery (a set of Li-ion cells in series) is charged in three stages:
# Constant current
# Balance (only required when cell groups become unbalanced during use)
# Constant voltage

During the &quot;constant current&quot; phase, the charger applies a constant current to the battery at a steadily increasing voltage, until the top-of-charge voltage limit per cell is reached.

During the &quot;balance&quot; phase, the charger/battery reduces the charging current (or cycles the charging on and off to reduce the average current) while the state of charge of individual cells is brought to the same level by a balancing circuit until the battery is balanced. Balancing typically occurs whenever one or more cells reach their top-of-charge voltage before the other(s), as it is generally inaccurate to do so at other stages of the charge cycle. This is most commonly done by passive balancing, which dissipates excess charge as heat via resistors connected momentarily across the cells to be balanced. Active balancing is less common, more expensive, but more efficient, returning excess energy to other cells (or the entire pack) via a DC-DC converter or other circuitry. Balancing most often occurs during the constant voltage stage of charging, switching between charge modes until complete. The pack is usually fully charged only when balancing is complete, as even a single cell group lower in charge than the rest will limit the entire battery&#x27;s usable capacity to that of its own. Balancing can last hours or even days, depending on the magnitude of the imbalance in the battery.

During the &quot;constant voltage&quot; phase, the charger applies a voltage equal to the maximum cell voltage times the number of cells in series to the battery, as the current gradually declines towards 0, until the current is below a set threshold of about 3% of initial constant charge current.

Periodic topping charge about once per 500 hours. Top charging is recommended to be initiated when voltage goes below 

Failure to follow current and voltage limitations can result in an explosion.

Charging temperature limits for Li-ion are stricter than the operating limits. Lithium-ion chemistry performs well at elevated temperatures but prolonged exposure to heat reduces battery life. Li‑ion batteries offer good charging performance at cooler temperatures and may even allow &quot;fast-charging&quot; within a temperature range of . Charging should be performed within this temperature range. At temperatures from 0 to 5 °C charging is possible, but the charge current should be reduced. During a low-temperature (under 0 °C) charge, the slight temperature rise above ambient due to the internal cell resistance is beneficial. High temperatures during charging may lead to battery degradation and charging at temperatures above 45 °C will degrade battery performance, whereas at lower temperatures the internal resistance of the battery may increase, resulting in slower charging and thus longer charging times.

Batteries gradually self-discharge even if not connected and delivering current. Li-ion rechargeable batteries have a self-discharge rate typically stated by manufacturers to be 1.5–2% per month.

The rate increases with temperature and state of charge. A 2004 study found that for most cycling conditions self-discharge was primarily time-dependent; however, after several months of stand on open circuit or float charge, state-of-charge dependent losses became significant. The self-discharge rate did not increase monotonically with state-of-charge, but dropped somewhat at intermediate states of charge. Self-discharge rates may increase as batteries age. In 1999, self-discharge per month was measured at 8% at 21 °C, 15% at 40 °C, 31% at 60 °C. By 2007, monthly self-discharge rate was estimated at 2% to 3%, and 2–3% by 2016.

By comparison, the self-discharge rate for NiMH batteries dropped, as of 2017, from up to 30% per month for previously common cells to about 0.08–0.33% per month for low self-discharge NiMH batteries, and is about 10% per month in NiCd batteries.

=== Cathode ===

There are three classes of commercial cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries: (1) layered oxides, (2) spinel oxides and (3) oxoanion complexes. All of them were discovered by John Goodenough and his collaborators.

==== Layered Oxides ====
LiCoO2 was used in the first commercial lithium-ion battery made by Sony in 1991. The layered oxides have a pseudo-tetrahedral structure comprising layers made of MO6 octahedra separated by interlayer spaces that allow for two-dimensional lithium-ion diffusion. The band structure of LixCoO2 allows for true electronic (rather than polaronic) conductivity. However, due to an overlap between the Co4+ t2g d-band with the O2- 2p-band, the x must be &gt;0.5, otherwise O2 evolution occurs. This limits the charge capacity of this material to ~140 mA h g−1.

Several other first-row (3d) transition metals also form layered LiMO2 salts. Some can be directly prepared from lithium oxide and M2O3 (e.g. for M=Ti, V, Cr, Co, Ni), while others (M= Mn or Fe) can be prepared by ion exchange from NaMO2. LiVO2, LiMnO2 and LiFeO2 suffer from structural instabilities (including mixing between M and Li sites) due to a low energy difference between octahedral and tetrahedral environments for the metal ion M. For this reason, they are not used in lithium-ion batteries. However, Na+ and Fe3+ have sufficiently different sizes that NaFeO2 can be used in sodium-ion batteries.

Similarly, LiCrO2 shows reversible lithium (de)intercalation around 3.2 V with 170–270 mAh/g. However, its cycle life is short, because of disproportionation of Cr4+ followed by translocation of Cr6+ into tetrahedral sites. On the other hand, NaCrO2 shows a much better cycling stability. LiTiO2 shows Li+ (de)intercalation at a voltage of ~1.5 V, which is too low for a cathode material.

These problems leave and as the only practical layered oxide materials for lithium-ion battery cathodes. The cobalt-based cathodes show high theoretical specific (per-mass) charge capacity, high volumetric capacity, low self-discharge, high discharge voltage, and good cycling performance. Unfortunately, they suffer from a high cost of the material. For this reason, the current trend among lithium-ion battery manufacturers is to switch to cathodes with higher Ni content and lower Co content.

In addition to a lower (than cobalt) cost, nickel-oxide based materials benefit from the two-electron redox chemistry of Ni: in layered oxides comprising nickel (such as nickel-cobalt-manganese NCM and nickel-cobalt-aluminium oxides NCA), Ni cycles between the oxidation states +2 and +4 (in one step between +3.5 and +4.3 V), cobalt- between +2 and +3, while Mn (usually &gt;20%) and Al (typically, only 5% is needed) remain in +4 and 3+, respectively. Thus increasing the Ni content increases the cyclable charge. For example, NCM111 shows 160 mAh/g, while (NCM811) and (NCA) deliver a higher capacity of ~200 mAh/g.

It is worth mentioning so-called &quot;lithium-rich&quot; cathodes, that can be produced from traditional NCM (, where M=Ni, Co, Mn) layered cathode materials upon cycling them to voltages/charges corresponding to Li:M&lt;0.5. Under such conditions a new semi-reversible redox transition at a higher voltage with ca. 0.4-0.8 electrons/metal site charge appears. This transition involves non-binding electron orbitals centered mostly on O atoms. Despite significant initial interest, this phenomenon did not result in marketable products because of the fast structural degradation (O2 evolution and lattice rearrangements) of such &quot;lithium-rich&quot; phases.

==== Cubic oxides (spinels) ====
LiMn2O4 adopts a cubic lattice, which allows for three-dimensional lithium-ion diffusion. Manganese cathodes are attractive because manganese is less expensive than cobalt or nickel. The operating voltage of Li-LiMn2O4 battery is 4 V, and ca. one lithium per two Mn ions can be reversibly extracted from the tetrahedral sites, resulting in a practical capacity of &lt;130 mA h g–1. However, Mn3+ is not a stable oxidation state, as it tends to disporportionate into insoluble Mn4+ and soluble Mn2+. LiMn2O4 can also intercalate more than 0.5 Li per Mn at a lower voltage around +3.0 V. However, this results in an irreversible phase transition due to Jahn-Teller distortion in Mn3+:t2g3eg1, as well as disproportionation and dissolution of Mn3+.

An important improvement of Mn spinel are related cubic structures of the LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 type, where Mn exists as Mn4+ and Ni cycles reversibly between the oxidation states +2 and +4. This materials show a reversible Li-ion capacity of ca. 135 mAh/g around 4.7 V. Although such high voltage is beneficial for increasing the specific energy of batteries, the adoption of such materials is currently hindered by the lack of suitable high-voltage electrolytes. In general, materials with a high nickel content are favored in 2023, because of the possibility of a 2-electron cycling of Ni between the oxidation states +2 and +4.

LiV2O4 (lithium vanadium oxide) operates as a lower (ca. +3.0 V) voltage than LiMn2O4, suffers from similar durability issues, is more expensive, and thus is not considered of practical interest.

==== Oxoanionic/olivins ====
Around 1980 Manthiram discovered that oxoanions (molybdates and tungstates in that particular case) cause a substantial positive shift in the redox potential of the metal-ion compared to oxides. In addition, these oxoanionic cathode materials offer better stability/safety than the corresponding oxides. However, they also suffer from poor electronic conductivity due to the long distance between redox-active metal centers, which slows down the electron transport. This necessitates the use of small (less than 200 nm) cathode particles and coating each particle with a layer of electronically-conducting carbon. This reduces the packing density of these materials.

Although numerous combinations of oxoanions (sulfate, phosphate, silicate) with various metals (mostly Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) have been studied, LiFePO4 is the only one that has been commercialized. Although it was originally used primarily for stationary energy storage due to its lower energy density compared to layered oxides, it has begun to be widely used in electric vehicles since the 2020s.

=== Anode ===
Negative electrode materials are traditionally constructed from graphite and other carbon materials, although newer silicon-based materials are being increasingly used (see Nanowire battery). In 2016, 89% of lithium-ion batteries contained graphite (43% artificial and 46% natural), 7% contained amorphous carbon (either soft carbon or hard carbon), 2% contained lithium titanate (LTO) and 2% contained silicon or tin-based materials.

These materials are used because they are abundant, electrically conducting and can intercalate lithium ions to store electrical charge with modest volume expansion (~10%). Graphite is the dominant material because of its low intercalation voltage and excellent performance. Various alternative materials with higher capacities have been proposed, but they usually have higher voltages, which reduces energy density. Low voltage is the key requirement for anodes; otherwise, the excess capacity is useless in terms of energy density.

As graphite is limited to a maximum capacity of 372 mAh/g much research has been dedicated to the development of materials that exhibit higher theoretical capacities and overcoming the technical challenges that presently encumber their implementation. The extensive 2007 Review Article by Kasavajjula et al.
summarizes early research on silicon-based anodes for lithium-ion secondary cells. In particular, Hong Li et al. showed in 2000 that the electrochemical insertion of lithium ions in silicon nanoparticles and silicon nanowires leads to the formation of an amorphous Li-Si alloy. The same year, Bo Gao and his doctoral advisor, Professor Otto Zhou described the cycling of electrochemical cells with anodes comprising silicon nanowires, with a reversible capacity ranging from at least approximately 900 to 1500 mAh/g.

Diamond-like carbon coatings can increase retention capacity by 40% and cycle life by 400% for lithium based batteries.

To improve the stability of the lithium anode, several approaches to installing a protective layer have been suggested. Silicon is beginning to be looked at as an anode material because it can accommodate significantly more lithium ions, storing up to 10 times the electric charge, however this alloying between lithium and silicon results in significant volume expansion (ca. 400%), which causes catastrophic failure for the cell. Silicon has been used as an anode material but the insertion and extraction of &lt;chem&gt;\scriptstyle Li+&lt;/chem&gt; can create cracks in the material. These cracks expose the Si surface to an electrolyte, causing decomposition and the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the new Si surface (crumpled graphene encapsulated Si nanoparticles). This SEI will continue to grow thicker, deplete the available &lt;chem&gt;\scriptstyle Li+&lt;/chem&gt;, and degrade the capacity and cycling stability of the anode.

In addition to carbon- and silicon- based anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, high-entropy metal oxide materials are being developed. These conversion (rather than intercalation) materials comprise an alloy (or subnanometer mixed phases) of several metal oxides performing different functions. For example, Zn and Co can act as electroactive charge-storing species, Cu can provide an electronically conducting support phase and MgO can prevent pulverization.

=== Electrolyte ===
Liquid electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries consist of lithium salts, such as ,  or  in an organic solvent, such as ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and diethyl carbonate. A liquid electrolyte acts as a conductive pathway for the movement of cations passing from the negative to the positive electrodes during discharge. Typical conductivities of liquid electrolyte at room temperature () are in the range of 10 mS/cm, increasing by approximately 30–40% at and decreasing slightly at . The combination of linear and cyclic carbonates (e.g., ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC)) offers high conductivity and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)-forming ability. While EC forms a stable SEI, it is not a liquid at room temperature, only becoming a liquid with the addition of additives such as the previously mentioned DMC or diethyl carbonate (DEC) or ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC). Organic solvents easily decompose on the negative electrodes during charge. When appropriate organic solvents are used as the electrolyte, the solvent decomposes on initial charging and forms a solid layer called the solid electrolyte interphase, which is electrically insulating, yet provides significant ionic conductivity, behaving as a solid electrolyte. The interphase prevents further decomposition of the electrolyte after the second charge as it grows thick enough to prevent electron tunneling after the first charge cycle. For example, ethylene carbonate is decomposed at a relatively high voltage, 0.7 V vs. lithium, and forms a dense and stable interface. Composite electrolytes based on POE (poly(oxyethylene)) provide a relatively stable interface. It can be either solid (high molecular weight) and be applied in dry Li-polymer cells, or liquid (low molecular weight) and be applied in regular Li-ion cells. Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are another approach to limiting the flammability and volatility of organic electrolytes.

==== Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) ====
The term solid electrolyte interphase was first coined by Peled in 1979 to describe the layer of insoluble products deposited on alkali and alkaline earth cathodes in non-aqueous batteries (NAB). However, Dey and Sullivan had noted previously in 1970 that graphite, in a lithium metal half cell using propylene carbonate (PC), reduced the electrolyte during discharge at a rate which linearly increased with the current. They proposed that the following reaction was taking place:

formula_1

The same reaction was later proposed by Fong et al in 1990, where they theorized that the carbonate ion was reacting with the lithium to form lithium carbonate, which was then forming a passivating layer on the surface of the graphite. PC is no longer used in batteries today as the molecules can intercalate into the graphite layers and react with the lithium there to form propylene and acts to delaminate the graphite.

The insulating properties of the SEI allow the battery to reach more extreme voltage gaps without simply reducing the electrolyte. This ability of the SEI to improve the voltage window of batteries was discovered almost on accident, but plays a vital role in high voltage batteries today.

==== Solid Electrolytes ====
Recent advances in battery technology involve using a solid as the electrolyte material. The most promising of these are ceramics. Solid ceramic electrolytes are mostly lithium metal oxides, which allow lithium-ion transport through the solid more readily due to the intrinsic lithium. The main benefit of solid electrolytes is that there is no risk of leaks, which is a serious safety issue for batteries with liquid electrolytes. Solid ceramic electrolytes can be further broken down into two main categories: ceramic and glassy. Ceramic solid electrolytes are highly ordered compounds with crystal structures that usually have ion transport channels. Common ceramic electrolytes are lithium super ion conductors (LISICON) and perovskites. Glassy solid electrolytes are amorphous atomic structures made up of similar elements to ceramic solid electrolytes but have higher conductivities overall due to higher conductivity at grain boundaries. Both glassy and ceramic electrolytes can be made more ionically conductive by substituting sulfur for oxygen. The larger radius of sulfur and its higher ability to be polarized allow higher conductivity of lithium. This contributes to conductivities of solid electrolytes are nearing parity with their liquid counterparts, with most on the order of 0.1 mS/cm and the best at 10 mS/cm. An efficient and economic way to tune targeted electrolytes properties is by adding a third component in small concentrations, known as an additive. By adding the additive in small amounts, the bulk properties of the electrolyte system will not be affected whilst the targeted property can be significantly improved. The numerous additives that have been tested can be divided into the following three distinct categories: (1) those used for SEI chemistry modifications; (2) those used for enhancing the ion conduction properties; (3) those used for improving the safety of the cell (e.g. prevent overcharging).

Electrolyte alternatives have also played a significant role, for example the lithium polymer battery. Polymer electrolytes are promising for minimizing the dendrite formation of lithium. Polymers are supposed to prevent short circuits and maintain conductivity.

The ions in the electrolyte diffuse because there are small changes in the electrolyte concentration. Linear diffusion is only considered here. The change in concentration &quot;c&quot;, as a function of time &quot;t&quot; and distance &quot;x&quot;, is

: formula_2

In this equation, &quot;D&quot; is the diffusion coefficient for the lithium ion. It has a value of in the electrolyte. The value for &quot;ε&quot;, the porosity of the electrolyte, is 0.724.

== Battery designs and formats ==
Lithium-ion batteries may have multiple levels of structure. Small batteries consist of a single battery cell. Larger batteries connect cells in parallel into a module and connect modules in series and parallel into a pack. Multiple packs may be connected in series to increase the voltage.

=== Electrode Layers and Electrolyte ===
On the macrostructral level (length scale 0.1–5 mm) almost all commercial lithium-ion batteries comprise foil current collectors (aluminium for cathode and copper for anode). Copper is selected for the anode, because lithium does not alloy with it. Aluminum is used for the cathode, because it passivates in LiPF6 electrolytes.

=== Cells ===
Li-ion cells are available in various form factors, which can generally be divided into four types:

* Coin cells have a rugged design with metal (stainless steel, usually) casing. Because of their poor specific energy (in Wh/kg) and small energy (Wh) per cell, their use is limited to handwatches, portable calculators and research. Notably, coin format cells are more commonly used for primary lithium-metal batteries.
* Small cylindrical (solid body without terminals, such as those used in most e-bikes and most electric vehicle battery and older laptop batteries); they typically come in standard sizes.
* Large cylindrical (solid body with large threaded terminals)
* Flat or pouch (soft, flat body, such as those used in cell phones and newer laptops; these are lithium-ion polymer batteries.
* Rigid plastic case with large threaded terminals (such as electric vehicle traction packs)

Cells with a cylindrical shape are made in a characteristic &quot;swiss roll&quot; manner (known as a &quot;jelly roll&quot; in the US), which means it is a single long &quot;sandwich&quot; of the positive electrode, separator, negative electrode, and separator rolled into a single spool. The result is encased in a container. One advantage of cylindrical cells is faster production speed. One disadvantage can be a large radial temperature gradient at high discharge rates.

The absence of a case gives pouch cells the highest gravimetric energy density; however, many applications require containment to prevent expansion when their state of charge (SOC) level is high, and for general structural stability. Both rigid plastic and pouch-style cells are sometimes referred to as prismatic cells due to their rectangular shapes. Three basic battery types are used in 2020s-era electric vehicles: cylindrical cells (e.g., Tesla), prismatic pouch (e.g., from LG), and prismatic can cells (e.g., from LG, Samsung, Panasonic, and others).

Lithium-ion flow batteries have been demonstrated that suspend the cathode or anode material in an aqueous or organic solution.

As of 2014, the smallest Li-ion cell was pin-shaped with a diameter of 3.5 mm and a weight of 0.6 g, made by Panasonic. A coin cell form factor is available for LiCoO2 cells, usually designated with a &quot;LiR&quot; prefix.

Batteries may be equipped with temperature sensors, heating/cooling systems, voltage regulator circuits, voltage taps, and charge-state monitors. These components address safety risks like overheating and short circuiting.

=== Electrode Layers ===

==== Cell voltage ====
The average voltage of LCO (lithium cobalt oxide) chemistry is 3.6v if made with hard carbon cathode and 3.7v if made with graphite cathode. Comparatively, the latter has a flatter discharge voltage curve.

== Uses ==

Lithium ion batteries are used in a multitude of applications from consumer electronics, toys, power tools and electric vehicles.

More niche uses include backup power in telecommunications applications. Lithium-ion batteries are also frequently discussed as a potential option for grid energy storage, although as of 2020, they were not yet cost-competitive at scale.

== Performance ==
Because lithium-ion batteries can have a variety of positive and negative electrode materials, the energy density and voltage vary accordingly.

The open-circuit voltage is higher than in aqueous batteries (such as lead–acid, nickel–metal hydride and nickel–cadmium). Internal resistance increases with both cycling and age, although this depends strongly on the voltage and temperature the batteries are stored at. Rising internal resistance causes the voltage at the terminals to drop under load, which reduces the maximum current draw. Eventually, increasing resistance will leave the battery in a state such that it can no longer support the normal discharge currents requested of it without unacceptable voltage drop or overheating.

Batteries with a lithium iron phosphate positive and graphite negative electrodes have a nominal open-circuit voltage of 3.2 V and a typical charging voltage of 3.6 V. Lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) oxide positives with graphite negatives have a 3.7 V nominal voltage with a 4.2 V maximum while charging. The charging procedure is performed at constant voltage with current-limiting circuitry (i.e., charging with constant current until a voltage of 4.2 V is reached in the cell and continuing with a constant voltage applied until the current drops close to zero). Typically, the charge is terminated at 3% of the initial charge current. In the past, lithium-ion batteries could not be fast-charged and needed at least two hours to fully charge. Current-generation cells can be fully charged in 45 minutes or less. In 2015 researchers demonstrated a small 600 mAh capacity battery charged to 68 percent capacity in two minutes and a 3,000 mAh battery charged to 48 percent capacity in five minutes. The latter battery has an energy density of 620 W·h/L. The device employed heteroatoms bonded to graphite molecules in the anode.

Performance of manufactured batteries has improved over time. For example, from 1991 to 2005 the energy capacity per price of lithium-ion batteries improved more than ten-fold, from 0.3 W·h per dollar to over 3 W·h per dollar. In the period from 2011 to 2017, progress has averaged 7.5% annually. 
Overall, between 1991 and 2018, prices for all types of lithium-ion cells (in dollars per kWh) fell approximately 97%. Over the same time period, energy density more than tripled.
Efforts to increase energy density contributed significantly to cost reduction. Energy density can also be increased by improvements in the chemistry if the cell, for instance, by full or partial replacement of graphite with silicon. Silicon anodes enhanced with graphene nanotubes to eliminate the premature degradation of silicon open the door to reaching record-breaking battery energy density of up to 350 Wh/kg and lowering EV prices to be competitive with ICEs.

Differently sized cells with similar chemistry can also have different energy densities. The 21700 cell has 50% more energy than the 18650 cell, and the bigger size reduces heat transfer to its surroundings.

=== Round-trip efficiency ===
The table below shows the result of an experimental evaluation of a &quot;high-energy&quot; type 3.0 Ah 18650 NMC cell in 2021, round-trip efficiency which compared the energy going into the cell and energy extracted from the cell from 100% (4.2v) SoC to 0% SoC (cut off 2.0v). A roundtrip efficiency is the percent of energy that can be used relative to the energy that went into charging the battery.

Characterization of a cell in a different experiment in 2017 reported round-trip efficiency of 85.5% at 2C and 97.6% at 0.1C

== Lifespan ==

The lifespan of a lithium-ion battery is typically defined as the number of full charge-discharge cycles to reach a failure threshold in terms of capacity loss or impedance rise. Manufacturers&#x27; datasheet typically uses the word &quot;cycle life&quot; to specify lifespan in terms of the number of cycles to reach 80% of the rated battery capacity. Simply storing lithium-ion batteries in the charged state also reduces their capacity (the amount of cyclable ) and increases the cell resistance (primarily due to the continuous growth of the solid electrolyte interface on the anode). Calendar life is used to represent the whole life cycle of battery involving both the cycle and inactive storage operations. Battery cycle life is affected by many different stress factors including temperature, discharge current, charge current, and state of charge ranges (depth of discharge). Batteries are not fully charged and discharged in real applications such as smartphones, laptops and electric cars and hence defining battery life via full discharge cycles can be misleading. To avoid this confusion, researchers sometimes use cumulative discharge defined as the total amount of charge (Ah) delivered by the battery during its entire life or equivalent full cycles, which represents the summation of the partial cycles as fractions of a full charge-discharge cycle. Battery degradation during storage is affected by temperature and battery state of charge (SOC) and a combination of full charge (100% SOC) and high temperature (usually &gt; 50 °C) can result in a sharp capacity drop and gas generation. Multiplying the battery cumulative discharge by the rated nominal voltage gives the total energy delivered over the life of the battery. From this one can calculate the cost per kWh of the energy (including the cost of charging).

Over their lifespan batteries degrade gradually leading to reduced cyclable charge (a.k.a. Ah capacity) and increased resistance (the latter translates into a lower operating cell voltage).

Several degradation processes occur in lithium-ion batteries, some during cycling, some during storage, and some all the time: Degradation is strongly temperature-dependent: degradation at room temperature is minimal but increases for batteries stored or used in high temperature (usually &gt; 35 °C) or low temperature (usually &lt; 5 °C) environments. High charge levels also hasten capacity loss. Frequent charge to &gt; 90% and discharge to &lt; 10% may also hasten capacity loss. Keeping the li-ion battery status to about 60% to 80% can reduce the capacity loss.

In a study, scientists provided 3D imaging and model analysis to reveal main causes, mechanics, and potential mitigations of the problematic degradation of the batteries over charge cycles. They found &quot;[p]article cracking increases and contact loss between particles and carbon-binder domain are observed to correlate with the cell degradation&quot; and indicates that &quot;the reaction heterogeneity within the thick cathode caused by the unbalanced electron conduction is the main cause of the battery degradation over cycling&quot;.

The most common degradation mechanisms in lithium-ion batteries include:

# Reduction of the organic carbonate electrolyte at the anode, which results in the growth of Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI), where ions get irreversibly trapped, i.e. loss of lithium inventory. This shows as increased ohmic impedance of the negative electrode and a drop in the cyclable Ah charge. At constant temperature, the SEI film thickness (and therefore, the SEI resistance and the loss in cyclable ) increases as a square root of the time spent in the charged state. The number of cycles is not a useful metric in characterizing this degradation pathway. Under high temperatures or in the presence of a mechanical damage the electrolyte reduction can proceed explosively.
# Lithium metal plating also results in the loss of lithium inventory (cyclable Ah charge), as well as internal short-circuiting and ignition of a battery. Once Li plating commences during cycling, it results in larger slopes of capacity loss per cycle and resistance increase per cycle. This degradation mechanism become more prominent during fast charging and low temperatures.
# Loss of the (negative or positive) electroactive materials due to dissolution (e.g. of species), cracking, exfoliation, detachment or even simple regular volume change during cycling. It shows up as both charge and power fade (increased resistance). Both positive and negative electrode materials are subject to fracturing due to the volumetric strain of repeated (de)lithiation cycles.
# Structural degradation of cathode materials, such as cation mixing in nickel-rich materials. This manifests as &quot;electrode saturation&quot;, loss of cyclable Ah charge and as a &quot;voltage fade&quot;.
# Other material degradations. Negative copper current collector is particularly prone to corrosion/dissolution at low cell voltages. PVDF binder also degrades, causing the detachment of the electroactive materials, and the loss of cyclable Ah charge.
These are shown in the figure on the right. A change from one main degradation mechanism to another appears as a knee (slope change) in the capacity vs. cycle number plot.

Most studies of lithium-ion battery aging have been done at elevated (50–60 °C) temperatures in order to complete the experiments sooner. Under these storage conditions, fully charged nickel-cobalt-aluminum and lithium-iron phosphate cells lose ca. 20% of their cyclable charge in 1–2 years. It is believed that the aforementioned anode aging is the most important degradation pathway in these cases. On the other hand, manganese-based cathodes show a (ca. 20–50%) faster degradation under these conditions, probably due to the additional mechanism of Mn ion dissolution. At 25 °C the degradation of lithium-ion batteries seems to follow the same pathway(s) as the degradation at 50 °C, but with half the speed. In other words, based on the limited extrapolated experimental data, lithium-ion batteries are expected to lose irreversibly ca. 20% of their cyclable charge in 3–5 years or 1000–2000 cycles at 25 °C. Lithium-ion batteries with titanate anodes do not suffer from SEI growth, and last longer (&gt;5000 cycles) than graphite anodes. However, in complete cells other degradation mechanisms (i.e. the dissolution of and the place exchange, decomposition of PVDF binder and particle detachment) show up after 1000–2000 days, and the use titanate anode does not improve full cell durability in practice.

===Detailed degradation description===
A more detailed description of some of these mechanisms is provided below:
===Recommendations===
The IEEE standard 1188–1996 recommends replacing lithium-ion batteries in an electric vehicle, when their charge capacity drops to 80% of the nominal value. In what follows, we shall use the 20% capacity loss as a comparison point between different studies. We shall note, nevertheless, that the linear model of degradation (the constant % of charge loss per cycle or per calendar time) is not always applicable, and that a &quot;knee point&quot;, observed as a change of the slope, and related to the change of the main degradation mechanism, is often observed.

== Safety ==
The problem of lithium-ion battery safety has been recognized even before these batteries were first commercially released in 1991. The two main reasons for lithium-ion battery fires and explosions are related to processes on the negative electrode (cathode). During a normal battery charge lithium ions intercalate into graphite. However, if the charge is forced to go too fast (or at a too low temperature) lithium metal starts plating on the anode, and the resulting dendrites can penetrate the battery separator, internally short-circuit the cell, resulting in high electric current, heating and ignition. In other mechanism, an explosive reaction between the charge anode material (LiC6) and the solvent (liquid organic carbonate) occurs even at open circuit, provided that the anode temperature exceeds a certain threshold above 70 °C.

Nowadays, all reputable manufacturers employ at least two safety devices in all their lithium-ion batteries of an 18650 format or larger: a current interrupt (CID) device and a positive temperature coefficient (PTC) device. The CID comprises two metal disks, that make an electric contact with each other. When pressure inside the cell increases, the distance between the two disks increases too and they lose the electric contact with each other, thus terminating the flow of electric current through the battery. The PTC device is made of an electrically conducting polymer. When the current going through the PTC device increases, the polymer gets hot, and its electric resistance rises sharply, thus reducing the current through the battery.

=== Fire hazard ===
Lithium-ion batteries can be a safety hazard since they contain a flammable electrolyte and may become pressurized if they become damaged. A battery cell charged too quickly could cause a short circuit, leading to overheating, explosions, and fires. A Li-ion battery fire can be started due to (1) thermal abuse, e.g. poor cooling or external fire, (2) electrical abuse, e.g. overcharge or external short circuit, (3) mechanical abuse, e.g. penetration or crash, or (4) internal short circuit, e.g. due to manufacturing flaws or aging. Because of these risks, testing standards are more stringent than those for acid-electrolyte batteries, requiring both a broader range of test conditions and additional battery-specific tests, and there are shipping limitations imposed by safety regulators. There have been battery-related recalls by some companies, including the 2016 Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall for battery fires.

Lithium-ion batteries have a flammable liquid electrolyte. A faulty battery can cause a serious fire. Faulty chargers can affect the safety of the battery because they can destroy the battery&#x27;s protection circuit. While charging at temperatures below 0 °C, the negative electrode of the cells gets plated with pure lithium, which can compromise the safety of the whole pack.

Short-circuiting a battery will cause the cell to overheat and possibly to catch fire. Smoke from thermal runaway in a Li-ion battery is both flammable and toxic. The fire energy content (electrical + chemical) of cobalt-oxide cells is about 100 to 150 kJ/(A·h), most of it chemical.

Around 2010, large lithium-ion batteries were introduced in place of other chemistries to power systems on some aircraft; , there had been at least four serious lithium-ion battery fires, or smoke, on the Boeing 787 passenger aircraft, introduced in 2011, which did not cause crashes but had the potential to do so. UPS Airlines Flight 6 crashed in Dubai after its payload of batteries spontaneously ignited.

To reduce fire hazards, research projects are intended to develop non-flammable electrolytes.

=== Damaging and overloading ===

If a lithium-ion battery is damaged, crushed, or is subjected to a higher electrical load without having overcharge protection, problems may arise. External short circuit can trigger a battery explosion.
Such incidents can occur when lithium-ion batteries are not disposed of through the appropriate channels, but are thrown away with other waste. The way they are treated by recycling companies can damage them and cause fires, which in turn can lead to large-scale conflagrations. Twelve such fires were recorded in Swiss recycling facilities in 2023.

If overheated or overcharged, Li-ion batteries may suffer thermal runaway and cell rupture. During thermal runaway, internal degradation and oxidization processes can keep cell temperatures above 500 °C, with the possibility of igniting secondary combustibles, as well as leading to leakage, explosion or fire in extreme cases. To reduce these risks, many lithium-ion cells (and battery packs) contain fail-safe circuitry that disconnects the battery when its voltage is outside the safe range of 3–4.2 V per cell, or when overcharged or discharged. Lithium battery packs, whether constructed by a vendor or the end-user, without effective battery management circuits are susceptible to these issues. Poorly designed or implemented battery management circuits also may cause problems; it is difficult to be certain that any particular battery management circuitry is properly implemented.

=== Voltage limits ===

Lithium-ion cells are susceptible to stress by voltage ranges outside of safe ones between 2.5 and 3.65/4.1/4.2 or 4.35 V (depending on the components of the cell). Exceeding this voltage range results in premature aging and in safety risks due to the reactive components in the cells. When stored for long periods the small current draw of the protection circuitry may drain the battery below its shutoff voltage; normal chargers may then be useless since the battery management system (BMS) may retain a record of this battery (or charger) &quot;failure&quot;. Many types of lithium-ion cells cannot be charged safely below 0 °C, as this can result in plating of lithium on the anode of the cell, which may cause complications such as internal short-circuit paths.

Other safety features are required in each cell:
* Shut-down separator (for overheating)
* Tear-away tab (for internal pressure relief)
* Vent (pressure relief in case of severe outgassing)
* Thermal interrupt (overcurrent/overcharging/environmental exposure)

These features are required because the negative electrode produces heat during use, while the positive electrode may produce oxygen. However, these additional devices occupy space inside the cells, add points of failure, and may irreversibly disable the cell when activated. Further, these features increase costs compared to nickel metal hydride batteries, which require only a hydrogen/oxygen recombination device and a back-up pressure valve. Contaminants inside the cells can defeat these safety devices. Also, these features can not be applied to all kinds of cells, e.g., prismatic high current cells cannot be equipped with a vent or thermal interrupt. High current cells must not produce excessive heat or oxygen, lest there be a failure, possibly violent. Instead, they must be equipped with internal thermal fuses which act before the anode and cathode reach their thermal limits.

Replacing the lithium cobalt oxide positive electrode material in lithium-ion batteries with a lithium metal phosphate such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP) improves cycle counts, shelf life and safety, but lowers capacity. As of 2006, these safer lithium-ion batteries were mainly used in electric cars and other large-capacity battery applications, where safety is critical. In 2016, an LFP-based energy storage system was chosen to be installed in Paiyun Lodge on Mt.Jade (Yushan) (the highest lodge in Taiwan). As of June 2024, the system was still operating safely.

=== Recalls ===
In 2006, approximately 10 million Sony batteries used in laptops were recalled, including those in laptops from Dell, Sony, Apple, Lenovo, Panasonic, Toshiba, Hitachi, Fujitsu and Sharp. The batteries were found to be susceptible to internal contamination by metal particles during manufacture. Under some circumstances, these particles could pierce the separator, causing a dangerous short circuit.


IATA estimates that over a billion lithium metal and lithium-ion cells are flown each year. Some kinds of lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard aircraft because of the fire hazard. Some postal administrations restrict air shipping (including EMS) of lithium and lithium-ion batteries, either separately or installed in equipment.

=== Non-flammable electrolyte ===

In 2023, most commercial Li-ion batteries employed alkylcarbonate solvent(s) to assure the formation solid electrolyte interface on the negative electrode. Since such solvents are readily flammable, there has been active research to replace them with non-flammable solvents or to add fire suppressants. Another source of hazard is hexafluorophosphate anion, which is needed to passitivate the negative current collector made of aluminium. Hexafluorophosphate reacts with water and releases volatile and toxic hydrogen fluoride. Efforts to replace hexafluorophosphate have been less successful.

== Supply chain ==
Li-ion battery production is heavily concentrated, with 60% coming from China in 2024.

In the 1990s, the United States was the World&#x27;s largest miner of lithium minerals, contributing to 1/3 of the total production. By 2010 Chile replaced the USA the leading miner, thanks to the development of lithium brines in Salar de Atacama. By 2024, Australia and China joined Chile as the top 3 miners.

=== Environmental impact ===

Extraction of lithium, nickel, and cobalt, manufacture of solvents, and mining byproducts present significant environmental and health hazards. 
Lithium extraction can be fatal to aquatic life due to water pollution. It is known to cause surface water contamination, drinking water contamination, respiratory problems, ecosystem degradation and landscape damage. It also leads to unsustainable water consumption in arid regions (1.9 million liters per ton of lithium). Massive byproduct generation of lithium extraction also presents unsolved problems, such as large amounts of magnesium and lime waste.

Lithium mining takes place in North and South America, Asia, South Africa, Australia, and China.

Cobalt for Li-ion batteries is largely mined in the Congo (see also Mining industry of the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Open-pit cobalt mining has led to deforestation and habitat destruction in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Open-pit nickel mining has led to environmental degradation and pollution in developing countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia. In 2024, nickel mining and processing was one of the main causes of deforestation in Indonesia.

Manufacturing a kg of Li-ion battery takes about 67 megajoule (MJ) of energy. The global warming potential of lithium-ion batteries manufacturing strongly depends on the energy source used in mining and manufacturing operations, and is difficult to estimate, but one 2019 study estimated 73 kg CO2e/kWh. Effective recycling can reduce the carbon footprint of the production significantly.

=== Solid waste and recycling ===

Li-ion battery elements including iron, copper, nickel and cobalt are considered safe for incinerators and landfills. These metals can be recycled, usually by burning away the other materials, but mining generally remains cheaper than recycling; recycling may cost $3/kg, and in 2019 less than 5% of lithium-ion batteries were being recycled. Since 2018, the recycling yield was increased significantly, and recovering lithium, manganese, aluminum, the organic solvents of the electrolyte, and graphite is possible at industrial scales. The most expensive metal involved in the construction of the cell is cobalt. Lithium is less expensive than other metals used and is rarely recycled, but recycling could prevent a future shortage.

Accumulation of battery waste presents technical challenges and health hazards. Since the environmental impact of electric cars is heavily affected by the production of lithium-ion batteries, the development of efficient ways to repurpose waste is crucial. Recycling is a multi-step process, starting with the storage of batteries before disposal, followed by manual testing, disassembling, and finally the chemical separation of battery components. Re-use of the battery is preferred over complete recycling as there is less embodied energy in the process. As these batteries are a lot more reactive than classical vehicle waste like tire rubber, there are significant risks to stockpiling used batteries.

==== Pyrometallurgical recovery ====

The pyrometallurgical method uses a high-temperature furnace to reduce the components of the metal oxides in the battery to an alloy of Co, Cu, Fe, and Ni. This is the most common and commercially established method of recycling and can be combined with other similar batteries to increase smelting efficiency and improve thermodynamics. The metal current collectors aid the smelting process, allowing whole cells or modules to be melted at once. The product of this method is a collection of metallic alloy, slag, and gas. At high temperatures, the polymers used to hold the battery cells together burn off and the metal alloy can be separated through a hydrometallurgical process into its separate components. The slag can be further refined or used in the cement industry. The process is relatively risk-free and the exothermic reaction from polymer combustion reduces the required input energy. However, in the process, the plastics, electrolytes, and lithium salts will be lost.

==== Hydrometallurgical metals reclamation ====

This method involves the use of aqueous solutions to remove the desired metals from the cathode. The most common reagent is sulfuric acid. Factors that affect the leaching rate include the concentration of the acid, time, temperature, solid-to-liquid-ratio, and reducing agent. It is experimentally proven that H2O2 acts as a reducing agent to speed up the rate of leaching through the reaction:

: 2 LiCoO2 (s) + 3 H2SO4 + H2O2 → 2 CoSO4 (aq) + Li2SO4 + 4 H2O + O2

Once leached, the metals can be extracted through precipitation reactions controlled by changing the pH level of the solution. Cobalt, the most expensive metal, can then be recovered in the form of sulfate, oxalate, hydroxide, or carbonate. [75] More recently recycling methods experiment with the direct reproduction of the cathode from the leached metals. In these procedures, concentrations of the various leached metals are premeasured to match the target cathode and then the cathodes are directly synthesized.

The main issues with this method, however, is that a large volume of solvent is required and the high cost of neutralization. Although it&#x27;s easy to shred up the battery, mixing the cathode and anode at the beginning complicates the process, so they will also need to be separated. Unfortunately, the current design of batteries makes the process extremely complex and it is difficult to separate the metals in a closed-loop battery system. Shredding and dissolving may occur at different locations.

==== Direct recycling ====

Direct recycling is the removal of the cathode or anode from the electrode, reconditioned, and then reused in a new battery. Mixed metal-oxides can be added to the new electrode with very little change to the crystal morphology. The process generally involves the addition of new lithium to replenish the loss of lithium in the cathode due to degradation from cycling. Cathode strips are obtained from the dismantled batteries, then soaked in NMP, and undergo sonication to remove excess deposits. It is treated hydrothermally with a solution containing LiOH/Li2SO4 before annealing.

This method is extremely cost-effective for noncobalt-based batteries as the raw materials do not make up the bulk of the cost. Direct recycling avoids the time-consuming and expensive purification steps, which is great for low-cost cathodes such as LiMn2O4 and LiFePO4. For these cheaper cathodes, most of the cost, embedded energy, and carbon footprint is associated with the manufacturing rather than the raw material. It is experimentally shown that direct recycling can reproduce similar properties to pristine graphite.

The drawback of the method lies in the condition of the retired battery. In the case where the battery is relatively healthy, direct recycling can cheaply restore its properties. However, for batteries where the state of charge is low, direct recycling may not be worth the investment. The process must also be tailored to the specific cathode composition, and therefore the process must be configured to one type of battery at a time. Lastly, in a time with rapidly developing battery technology, the design of a battery today may no longer be desirable a decade from now, rendering direct recycling ineffective.

====Physical materials separation====
Physical materials separation recovered materials by mechanical crushing and exploiting physical properties of different components such as particle size, density, ferromagnetism and hydrophobicity. Copper, aluminum and steel casing can be recovered by sorting. The remaining materials, called &quot;black mass&quot;, which is composed of nickel, cobalt, lithium and manganese, need a secondary treatment to recover.

====Biological metals reclamation====
For the biological metals reclamation or bio-leaching, the process uses microorganisms to digest metal oxides selectively. Then, recyclers can reduce these oxides to produce metal nanoparticles. Although bio-leaching has been used successfully in the mining industry, this process is still nascent to the recycling industry and plenty of opportunities exists for further investigation.

==== Electrolyte recycling ====
Electrolyte recycling consists of two phases. The collection phase extracts the electrolyte from the spent Li-ion battery. This can be achieved through mechanical processes, distillation, freezing, solvent extraction, and supercritical fluid extraction. Due to the volatility, flammability, and sensitivity of the electrolyte, the collection process poses a greater difficulty than the collection process for other components of a Li-ion battery. The next phase consists of separation/electrolyte regeneration. Separation consists of isolating the individual components of the electrolyte. This approach is often used for the direct recovery of the Li salts from the organic solvents. In contrast, regeneration of the electrolyte aims to preserve the electrolyte composition by removing impurities which can be achieved through filtration methods.

The recycling of the electrolytes, which consists 10-15 wt.% of the Li-ion battery, provides both an economic and environmental benefits. These benefits include the recovery of the valuable Li-based salts and the prevention of hazardous compounds, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carcinogens, being released into the environment.

Compared to electrode recycling, less focus is placed on recycling the electrolyte of Li-ion batteries which can be attributed to lower economic benefits and greater process challenges. Such challenges can include the difficulty associated with recycling different electrolyte compositions, removing side products accumulated from electrolyte decomposition during its runtime, and removal of electrolyte adsorbed onto the electrodes. Due to these challenges, current pyrometallurgical methods of Li-ion battery recycling forgo electrolyte recovery, releasing hazardous gases upon heating. However, due to high energy consumption and environmental impact, future recycling methods are being directed away from this approach.

=== Human rights impact ===
Extraction of raw materials for lithium-ion batteries may present dangers to local people, especially land-based indigenous populations.

Cobalt sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo is often mined by workers using hand tools with few safety precautions, resulting in frequent injuries and deaths. Pollution from these mines has exposed people to toxic chemicals that health officials believe to cause birth defects and breathing difficulties. Human rights activists have alleged, and investigative journalism reported confirmation, that child labor is used in these mines.

A study of relationships between lithium extraction companies and indigenous peoples in Argentina indicated that the state may not have protected indigenous peoples&#x27; right to free prior and informed consent, and that extraction companies generally controlled community access to information and set the terms for discussion of the projects and benefit sharing.

Development of the Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, USA has met with protests and lawsuits from several indigenous tribes who have said they were not provided free prior and informed consent and that the project threatens cultural and sacred sites. Links between resource extraction and missing and murdered indigenous women have also prompted local communities to express concerns that the project will create risks to indigenous women. Protestors have been occupying the site of the proposed mine since January, 2021.

== Research ==

Researchers are actively working to improve the power density, safety, cycle durability (battery life), recharge time, cost, flexibility, and other characteristics, as well as research methods and uses, of these batteries. Solid-state batteries are being researched as a breakthrough in technological barriers. Currently, solid-state batteries are expected to be the most promising next-generation battery, and various companies are working to popularize them.

Research areas for lithium-ion batteries include extending lifetime, increasing energy density, improving safety, reducing cost, and increasing charging speed, among others. Research has been under way in the area of non-flammable electrolytes as a pathway to increased safety based on the flammability and volatility of the organic solvents used in the typical electrolyte. Strategies include aqueous lithium-ion batteries, ceramic solid electrolytes, polymer electrolytes, ionic liquids, and heavily fluorinated systems.

One of the ways to improve batteries is to combine the various cathode materials. This allows researchers to improve on the qualities of a material, while limiting the negatives. One possibility is coating lithium nickel manganese oxide with lithium iron phosphate through resonant acoustic mixing. The resulting material benefits from an increase electrochemical performance and improved capacity retention. Similar work was done with iron (III) phosphate.

<text>A rechargeable battery, storage battery, or secondary cell (formally a type of energy accumulator), is a type of electrical battery which can be charged, discharged into a load, and recharged many times, as opposed to a disposable or primary battery, which is supplied fully charged and discarded after use. It is composed of one or more electrochemical cells. The term &quot;accumulator&quot; is used as it accumulates and stores energy through a reversible electrochemical reaction. Rechargeable batteries are produced in many different shapes and sizes, ranging from button cells to megawatt systems connected to stabilize an electrical distribution network. Several different combinations of electrode materials and electrolytes are used, including lead–acid, zinc–air, nickel–cadmium (NiCd), nickel–metal hydride (NiMH), lithium-ion (Li-ion), lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), and lithium-ion polymer (Li-ion polymer).

Rechargeable batteries typically initially cost more than disposable batteries but have a much lower total cost of ownership and environmental impact, as they can be recharged inexpensively many times before they need replacing. Some rechargeable battery types are available in the same sizes and voltages as disposable types, and can be used interchangeably with them. Billions of dollars in research are being invested around the world for improving batteries as industry focuses on building better batteries.

== Applications ==

Devices which use rechargeable batteries include automobile starters, portable consumer devices, light vehicles (such as motorized wheelchairs, golf carts, electric bicycles, and electric forklifts), road vehicles (cars, vans, trucks, motorbikes), trains, small airplanes, tools, uninterruptible power supplies, and battery storage power stations. Emerging applications in hybrid internal combustion-battery and electric vehicles drive the technology to reduce cost, weight, and size, and increase lifetime.

Older rechargeable batteries self-discharge and require charging before first use; some newer low self-discharge NiMH batteries hold their charge for many months, and are typically sold factory-charged to about 70% of their rated capacity.

Battery storage power stations use rechargeable batteries for load-leveling (storing electric energy at times of low demand for use during peak periods) and for renewable energy uses (such as storing power generated from photovoltaic arrays during the day to be used at night). Load-leveling reduces the maximum power which a plant must be able to generate, reducing capital cost and the need for peaking power plants.

According to a report from Research and Markets, the analysts forecast the global rechargeable battery market to grow at a CAGR of 8.32% during the period 2018–2022.

Small rechargeable batteries can power portable electronic devices, power tools, appliances, and so on. Heavy-duty batteries power electric vehicles, ranging from scooters to locomotives and ships. They are used in distributed electricity generation and in stand-alone power systems.

== Charging and discharging ==
During charging, the positive active material is oxidized, releasing electrons, and the negative material is reduced, absorbing electrons. These electrons constitute the current flow in the external circuit. The electrolyte may serve as a simple buffer for internal ion flow between the electrodes, as in lithium-ion and nickel-cadmium cells, or it may be an active participant in the electrochemical reaction, as in lead–acid cells.

The energy used to charge rechargeable batteries usually comes from a battery charger using AC mains electricity, although some are equipped to use a vehicle&#x27;s 12-volt DC power outlet. The voltage of the source must be higher than that of the battery to force current to flow into it, but not too much higher or the battery may be damaged.

Chargers take from a few minutes to several hours to charge a battery. Slow &quot;dumb&quot; chargers without voltage or temperature-sensing capabilities will charge at a low rate, typically taking 14 hours or more to reach a full charge. Rapid chargers can typically charge cells in two to five hours, depending on the model, with the fastest taking as little as fifteen minutes. Fast chargers must have multiple ways of detecting when a cell reaches full charge (change in terminal voltage, temperature, etc.) to stop charging before harmful overcharging or overheating occurs. The fastest chargers often incorporate cooling fans to keep the cells from overheating. Battery packs intended for rapid charging may include a temperature sensor that the charger uses to protect the pack; the sensor will have one or more additional electrical contacts.

Different battery chemistries require different charging schemes. For example, some battery types can be safely recharged from a constant voltage source. Other types need to be charged with a regulated current source that tapers as the battery reaches fully charged voltage. Charging a battery incorrectly can damage a battery; in extreme cases, batteries can overheat, catch fire, or explosively vent their contents.

=== Rate of discharge ===

Battery charging and discharging rates are often discussed by referencing a &quot;C&quot; rate of current. The C rate is that which would theoretically fully charge or discharge the battery in one hour. For example, trickle charging might be performed at C/20 (or a &quot;20-hour&quot; rate), while typical charging and discharging may occur at C/2 (two hours for full capacity). The available capacity of electrochemical cells varies depending on the discharge rate. Some energy is lost in the internal resistance of cell components (plates, electrolyte, interconnections), and the rate of discharge is limited by the speed at which chemicals in the cell can move about. For lead-acid cells, the relationship between time and discharge rate is described by Peukert&#x27;s law; a lead-acid cell that can no longer sustain a usable terminal voltage at a high current may still have usable capacity, if discharged at a much lower rate. Data sheets for rechargeable cells often list the discharge capacity on 8-hour or 20-hour or other stated time; cells for uninterruptible power supply systems may be rated at 15-minute discharge.

The terminal voltage of the battery is not constant during charging and discharging. Some types have relatively constant voltage during discharge over much of their capacity. Non-rechargeable alkaline and zinc–carbon cells output 1.5 V when new, but this voltage drops with use. Most NiMH AA and AAA cells are rated at 1.2 V, but have a flatter discharge curve than alkalines and can usually be used in equipment designed to use alkaline batteries.

Battery manufacturers&#x27; technical notes often refer to voltage per cell (VPC) for the individual cells that make up the battery. For example, to charge a 12 V lead-acid battery (containing 6 cells of 2 V each) at 2.3 VPC requires a voltage of 13.8 V across the battery&#x27;s terminals.

=== Damage from cell reversal ===
Subjecting a discharged cell to a current in the direction which tends to discharge it further to the point the positive and negative terminals switch polarity causes a condition called &quot;&quot;. Generally, pushing current through a discharged cell in this way causes undesirable and irreversible chemical reactions to occur, resulting in permanent damage to the cell.
Cell reversal can occur under a number of circumstances, the two most common being:
* When a battery or cell is connected to a charging circuit the wrong way around.
* When a battery made of several cells connected in series is deeply discharged.
In the latter case, the problem occurs due to the different cells in a battery having slightly different capacities. When one cell reaches discharge level ahead of the rest, the remaining cells will force the current through the discharged cell.

Many battery-operated devices have a low-voltage cutoff that prevents deep discharges from occurring that might cause cell reversal. A smart battery has voltage monitoring circuitry built inside.

Cell reversal can occur to a weakly charged cell even before it is fully discharged. If the battery drain current is high enough, the cell&#x27;s internal resistance can create a resistive voltage drop that is greater than the cell&#x27;s forward emf. This results in the reversal of the cell&#x27;s polarity while the current is flowing. The higher the required discharge rate of a battery, the better matched the cells should be, both in the type of cell and state of charge, in order to reduce the chances of cell reversal.

In some situations, such as when correcting NiCd batteries that have been previously overcharged, it may be desirable to fully discharge a battery. To avoid damage from the cell reversal effect, it is necessary to access each cell separately: each cell is individually discharged by connecting a load clip across the terminals of each cell, thereby avoiding cell reversal.

=== Damage during storage in fully discharged state ===

If a multi-cell battery is fully discharged, it will often be damaged due to the cell reversal effect mentioned above.
It is possible however to fully discharge a battery without causing cell reversal—either by discharging each cell separately, or by allowing each cell&#x27;s internal leakage to dissipate its charge over time.

Even if a cell is brought to a fully discharged state without reversal, however, damage may occur over time simply due to remaining in the discharged state. An example of this is the sulfation that occurs in lead-acid batteries that are left sitting on a shelf for long periods.
For this reason it is often recommended to charge a battery that is intended to remain in storage, and to maintain its charge level by periodically recharging it.
Since damage may also occur if the battery is overcharged, the optimal level of charge during storage is typically around 30% to 70%.

=== Depth of discharge ===

Depth of discharge (DOD) is normally stated as a percentage of the nominal ampere-hour capacity; 0% DOD means no discharge. As the usable capacity of a battery system depends on the rate of discharge and the allowable voltage at the end of discharge, the depth of discharge must be qualified to show the way it is to be measured. Due to variations during manufacture and aging, the DOD for complete discharge can change over time or number of charge cycles. Generally a rechargeable battery system will tolerate more charge/discharge cycles if the DOD is lower on each cycle. Lithium batteries can discharge to about 80 to 90% of their nominal capacity. Lead-acid batteries can discharge to about 50–60%. While flow batteries can discharge 100%.

=== Lifespan and cycle stability ===
If batteries are used repeatedly even without mistreatment, they lose capacity as the number of charge cycles increases, until they are eventually considered to have reached the end of their useful life. Different battery systems have differing mechanisms for wearing out. For example, in lead-acid batteries, not all the active material is restored to the plates on each charge/discharge cycle; eventually enough material is lost that the battery capacity is reduced. In lithium-ion types, especially on deep discharge, some reactive lithium metal can be formed on charging, which is no longer available to participate in the next discharge cycle. Sealed batteries may lose moisture from their liquid electrolyte, especially if overcharged or operated at high temperature. This reduces the cycling life.

=== Recharging time ===

Recharging time is an important parameter to the user of a product powered by rechargeable batteries. Even if the charging power supply provides enough power to operate the device as well as recharge the battery, the device is attached to an external power supply during the charging time. For electric vehicles used industrially, charging during off-shifts may be acceptable. For highway electric vehicles, rapid charging is necessary for charging in a reasonable time.

A rechargeable battery cannot be recharged at an arbitrarily high rate. The internal resistance of the battery will produce heat, and excessive temperature rise will damage or destroy a battery. For some types, the maximum charging rate will be limited by the speed at which active material can diffuse through a liquid electrolyte. High charging rates may produce excess gas in a battery, or may result in damaging side reactions that permanently lower the battery capacity. Very roughly, and with many exceptions and caveats, restoring a battery&#x27;s full capacity in one hour or less is considered fast charging. A battery charger system will include more complex control-circuit- and charging strategies for fast charging, than for a charger designed for slower recharging.

== Active components ==
The active components in a secondary cell are the chemicals that make up the positive and negative active materials, and the electrolyte. The positive and negative electrodes are made up of different materials, with the positive exhibiting a reduction potential and the negative having an oxidation potential. The sum of the potentials from these half-reactions is the standard cell potential or voltage.

In primary cells the positive and negative electrodes are known as the cathode and anode, respectively. Although this convention is sometimes carried through to rechargeable systems—especially with lithium-ion cells, because of their origins in primary lithium cells—this practice can lead to confusion. In rechargeable cells the positive electrode is the cathode on discharge and the anode on charge, and vice versa for the negative electrode.

== Types ==

=== Commercial types ===
The lead–acid battery, invented in 1859 by French physicist Gaston Planté, is the oldest type of rechargeable battery. Despite having a very low energy-to-weight ratio and a low energy-to-volume ratio, its ability to supply high surge currents means that the cells have a relatively large power-to-weight ratio. These features, along with the low cost, makes it attractive for use in motor vehicles to provide the high current required by automobile starter motors.

The nickel–cadmium battery (NiCd) was invented by Waldemar Jungner of Sweden in 1899. It uses nickel oxide hydroxide and metallic cadmium as electrodes. Cadmium is a toxic element, and was banned for most uses by the European Union in 2004. Nickel–cadmium batteries have been almost completely superseded by nickel–metal hydride (NiMH) batteries.

The nickel–iron battery (NiFe) was also developed by Waldemar Jungner in 1899; and commercialized by Thomas Edison in 1901 in the United States for electric vehicles and railway signalling. It is composed of only non-toxic elements, unlike many kinds of batteries that contain toxic mercury, cadmium, or lead.

The nickel–metal hydride battery (NiMH) became available in 1989. These are now a common consumer and industrial type. The battery has a hydrogen-absorbing alloy for the negative electrode instead of cadmium.

The lithium-ion battery was introduced in the market in 1991, is the choice in most consumer electronics, having the best energy density and a very slow loss of charge when not in use. It does have drawbacks too, particularly the risk of unexpected ignition from the heat generated by the battery. Such incidents are rare and according to experts, they can be minimized &quot;via appropriate design, installation, procedures and layers of safeguards&quot; so the risk is acceptable.

Lithium-ion polymer batteries (LiPo) are light in weight, offer slightly higher energy density than Li-ion at slightly higher cost, and can be made in any shape. They are available but have not displaced Li-ion in the market. A primary use is for LiPo batteries is in powering remote-controlled cars, boats and airplanes. LiPo packs are readily available on the consumer market, in various configurations, up to 44.4 V, for powering certain R/C vehicles and helicopters or drones. Some test reports warn of the risk of fire when the batteries are not used in accordance with the instructions. Independent reviews of the technology discuss the risk of fire and explosion from lithium-ion batteries under certain conditions because they use liquid electrolytes.

Whereas lithium-ion batteries offer energy density in the range of 150260Wh/kg, batteries based on lithium-sulfur are expected to achieve 450500Wh/kg, and can eliminate cobalt, nickel and manganese from the production process. Furthermore, while initially lithium-sulfur batteries suffered from stability problems, recent research has made advances in developing lithium-sulfur batteries that cycle as long as (or longer than) batteries based on conventional lithium-ion technologies.

The thin-film battery (TFB) is a refinement of lithium ion technology by Excellatron. The developers claim a large increase in recharge cycles to around 40,000 and higher charge and discharge rates, at least 5 &quot;C&quot; charge rate. Sustained 60 &quot;C&quot; discharge and 1000 &quot;C&quot; peak discharge rate and a significant increase in specific energy, and energy density.

lithium iron phosphate batteries are used in some applications. 

UltraBattery, a hybrid lead–acid battery and ultracapacitor invented by Australia&#x27;s national science organisation CSIRO, exhibits tens of thousands of partial state of charge cycles and has outperformed traditional lead-acid, lithium, and NiMH-based cells when compared in testing in this mode against variability management power profiles. UltraBattery has kW and MW-scale installations in place in Australia, Japan, and the U.S. It has also been subjected to extensive testing in hybrid electric vehicles and has been shown to last more than 100,000 vehicle miles in on-road commercial testing in a courier vehicle. The technology is claimed to have a lifetime of 7 to 10 times that of conventional lead-acid batteries in high rate partial state-of-charge use, with safety and environmental benefits claimed over competitors like lithium-ion. Its manufacturer suggests an almost 100% recycling rate is already in place for the product.

The potassium-ion battery delivers around a million cycles, due to the extraordinary electrochemical stability of potassium insertion/extraction materials such as Prussian blue.

The sodium-ion battery is meant for stationary storage and competes with lead–acid batteries. It aims at a low total cost of ownership per kWh of storage. This is achieved by a long and stable lifetime. The effective number of cycles is above 5000 and the battery is not damaged by deep discharge. The energy density is rather low, somewhat lower than lead–acid.

== Alternatives ==
A rechargeable battery is only one of several types of rechargeable energy storage systems. Several alternatives to rechargeable batteries exist or are under development. For uses such as portable radios, rechargeable batteries may be replaced by clockwork mechanisms which are wound up by hand, driving dynamos, although this system may be used to charge a battery rather than to operate the radio directly. Flashlights may be driven by a dynamo directly. For transportation, uninterruptible power supply systems and laboratories, flywheel energy storage systems store energy in a spinning rotor for conversion to electric power when needed; such systems may be used to provide large pulses of power that would otherwise be objectionable on a common electrical grid.

Ultracapacitors capacitors of extremely high value are also used; an electric screwdriver which charges in 90 seconds and will drive about half as many screws as a device using a rechargeable battery was introduced in 2007, and similar flashlights have been produced. In keeping with the concept of ultracapacitors, betavoltaic batteries may be utilized as a method of providing a trickle-charge to a secondary battery, greatly extending the life and energy capacity of the battery system being employed; this type of arrangement is often referred to as a &quot;hybrid betavoltaic power source&quot; by those in the industry.

Ultracapacitors are being developed for transportation, using a large capacitor to store energy instead of the rechargeable battery banks used in hybrid vehicles. One drawback of capacitors compared to batteries is that the terminal voltage drops rapidly; a capacitor that has 25% of its initial energy left in it will have one-half of its initial voltage. By contrast, battery systems tend to have a terminal voltage that does not decline rapidly until nearly exhausted. This terminal voltage drop complicates the design of power electronics for use with ultracapacitors. However, there are potential benefits in cycle efficiency, lifetime, and weight compared with rechargeable systems. China started using ultracapacitors on two commercial bus routes in 2006; one of them is route 11 in Shanghai.

Flow batteries, used for specialized applications, are recharged by replacing the electrolyte liquid. A flow battery can be considered to be a type of rechargeable fuel cell.

== Research ==
Rechargeable battery research includes development of new electrochemical systems as well as improving the life span and capacity of current types.

<text>Gradient descent is a method for unconstrained mathematical optimization. It is a first-order iterative algorithm for minimizing a differentiable multivariate function.

The idea is to take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point, because this is the direction of steepest descent. Conversely, stepping in the direction of the gradient will lead to a trajectory that maximizes that function; the procedure is then known as &quot;gradient ascent&quot;.
It is particularly useful in machine learning for minimizing the cost or loss function. Gradient descent should not be confused with local search algorithms, although both are iterative methods for optimization.

Gradient descent is generally attributed to Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who first suggested it in 1847. Jacques Hadamard independently proposed a similar method in 1907. Its convergence properties for non-linear optimization problems were first studied by Haskell Curry in 1944, with the method becoming increasingly well-studied and used in the following decades.

A simple extension of gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, serves as the most basic algorithm used for training most deep networks today.

==Description==
Gradient descent is based on the observation that if the multi-variable function formula_1 is defined and differentiable in a neighborhood of a point formula_2, then formula_1 decreases &quot;fastest&quot; if one goes from formula_2 in the direction of the negative gradient of formula_5 at formula_6. It follows that, if

:formula_7

for a small enough step size or learning rate formula_8, then formula_9. In other words, the term formula_10 is subtracted from formula_2 because we want to move against the gradient, toward the local minimum. With this observation in mind, one starts with a guess formula_12 for a local minimum of formula_5, and considers the sequence formula_14 such that

:formula_15

We have a monotonic sequence

:formula_16

so the sequence formula_17 converges to the desired local minimum. Note that the value of the &quot;step size&quot; formula_18 is allowed to change at every iteration. 

It is possible to guarantee the convergence to a local minimum under certain assumptions on the function formula_5 (for example, formula_5 convex and formula_21 Lipschitz) and particular choices of formula_18. Those include the sequence

formula_23

as in the Barzilai-Borwein method, or a sequence formula_24 satisfying the Wolfe conditions (which can be found by using line search). When the function formula_5 is convex, all local minima are also global minima, so in this case gradient descent can converge to the global solution.

This process is illustrated in the adjacent picture. Here, formula_5 is assumed to be defined on the plane, and that its graph has a bowl shape. The blue curves are the contour lines, that is, the regions on which the value of formula_5 is constant. A red arrow originating at a point shows the direction of the negative gradient at that point. Note that the (negative) gradient at a point is orthogonal to the contour line going through that point. We see that gradient &quot;descent&quot; leads us to the bottom of the bowl, that is, to the point where the value of the function formula_5 is minimal.

=== An analogy for understanding gradient descent ===

The basic intuition behind gradient descent can be illustrated by a hypothetical scenario. People are stuck in the mountains and are trying to get down (i.e., trying to find the global minimum). There is heavy fog such that visibility is extremely low. Therefore, the path down the mountain is not visible, so they must use local information to find the minimum. They can use the method of gradient descent, which involves looking at the steepness of the hill at their current position, then proceeding in the direction with the steepest descent (i.e., downhill). If they were trying to find the top of the mountain (i.e., the maximum), then they would proceed in the direction of steepest ascent (i.e., uphill). Using this method, they would eventually find their way down the mountain or possibly get stuck in some hole (i.e., local minimum or saddle point), like a mountain lake. However, assume also that the steepness of the hill is not immediately obvious with simple observation, but rather it requires a sophisticated instrument to measure, which the persons happen to have at the moment. It takes quite some time to measure the steepness of the hill with the instrument, thus they should minimize their use of the instrument if they wanted to get down the mountain before sunset. The difficulty then is choosing the frequency at which they should measure the steepness of the hill so not to go off track.

In this analogy, the persons represent the algorithm, and the path taken down the mountain represents the sequence of parameter settings that the algorithm will explore. The steepness of the hill represents the slope of the function at that point. The instrument used to measure steepness is differentiation. The direction they choose to travel in aligns with the gradient of the function at that point. The amount of time they travel before taking another measurement is the step size. If they step off a cliff in the fog they will have optimised their descent path.

=== Choosing the step size and descent direction ===
Since using a step size formula_18 that is too small would slow convergence, and a formula_18 too large would lead to overshoot and divergence, finding a good setting of formula_18 is an important practical problem. Philip Wolfe also advocated using &quot;clever choices of the [descent] direction&quot; in practice. While using a direction that deviates from the steepest descent direction may seem counter-intuitive, the idea is that the smaller slope may be compensated for by being sustained over a much longer distance.

To reason about this mathematically, consider a direction formula_32 and step size formula_24 and consider the more general update:
:formula_34.
Finding good settings of formula_32 and formula_24 requires some thought. First of all, we would like the update direction to point downhill. Mathematically, letting formula_37 denote the angle between formula_38 and formula_32, this requires that formula_40 To say more, we need more information about the objective function that we are optimising. Under the fairly weak assumption that formula_5 is continuously differentiable, we may prove that:

This inequality implies that the amount by which we can be sure the function formula_5 is decreased depends on a trade off between the two terms in square brackets. The first term in square brackets measures the angle between the descent direction and the negative gradient. The second term measures how quickly the gradient changes along the descent direction.

In principle inequality () could be optimized over formula_32 and formula_24 to choose an optimal step size and direction. The problem is that evaluating the second term in square brackets requires evaluating formula_45, and extra gradient evaluations are generally expensive and undesirable. Some ways around this problem are:

* Forgo the benefits of a clever descent direction by setting formula_46, and use line search to find a suitable step-size formula_24, such as one that satisfies the Wolfe conditions. A more economic way of choosing learning rates is backtracking line search, a method that has both good theoretical guarantees and experimental results. Note that one does not need to choose formula_48 to be the gradient; any direction that has positive inner product with the gradient will result in a reduction of the function value (for a sufficiently small value of formula_24).
* Assuming that formula_5 is twice-differentiable, use its Hessian formula_51 to estimate formula_52Then choose formula_32 and formula_24 by optimising inequality ().
* Assuming that formula_21 is Lipschitz, use its Lipschitz constant formula_56 to bound formula_57 Then choose formula_32 and formula_24 by optimising inequality ().
* Build a custom model of formula_60 for formula_5. Then choose formula_32 and formula_24 by optimising inequality ().
* Under stronger assumptions on the function formula_5 such as convexity, more advanced techniques may be possible.

Usually by following one of the recipes above, convergence to a local minimum can be guaranteed. When the function formula_5 is convex, all local minima are also global minima, so in this case gradient descent can converge to the global solution.

==Solution of a linear system==

Gradient descent can be used to solve a system of linear equations

:formula_66

reformulated as a quadratic minimization problem.
If the system matrix formula_67 is real symmetric and positive-definite, an objective function is defined as the quadratic function, with minimization of

:formula_68

so that

:formula_69

For a general real matrix formula_67, linear least squares define

:formula_71

In traditional linear least squares for real formula_67 and formula_73 the Euclidean norm is used, in which case

:formula_74

The line search minimization, finding the locally optimal step size formula_18 on every iteration, can be performed analytically for quadratic functions, and explicit formulas for the locally optimal formula_18 are known.

For example, for real symmetric and positive-definite matrix formula_67, a simple algorithm can be as follows,
:formula_78

To avoid multiplying by formula_67 twice per iteration,
we note that formula_80 implies formula_81, which gives the traditional algorithm,
:formula_82

The method is rarely used for solving linear equations, with the conjugate gradient method being one of the most popular alternatives. The number of gradient descent iterations is commonly proportional to the spectral condition number formula_83 of the system matrix formula_67 (the ratio of the maximum to minimum eigenvalues of , while the convergence of conjugate gradient method is typically determined by a square root of the condition number, i.e., is much faster. Both methods can benefit from preconditioning, where gradient descent may require less assumptions on the preconditioner.

==Solution of a non-linear system==

Gradient descent can also be used to solve a system of nonlinear equations. Below is an example that shows how to use the gradient descent to solve for three unknown variables, &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, and &quot;x&quot;3. This example shows one iteration of the gradient descent.

Consider the nonlinear system of equations

:formula_85

Let us introduce the associated function

:formula_86

where

:formula_87

One might now define the objective function

:formula_88

which we will attempt to minimize. As an initial guess, let us use

:formula_89

We know that

:formula_90

where the Jacobian matrix formula_91 is given by

:formula_92

We calculate:

:formula_93

Thus

:formula_94

and

:formula_95

Now, a suitable formula_96 must be found such that

:formula_97

This can be done with any of a variety of line search algorithms. One might also simply guess formula_98 which gives

:formula_99

Evaluating the objective function at this value, yields

:formula_100

The decrease from formula_101 to the next step&#x27;s value of

:formula_102

is a sizable decrease in the objective function. Further steps would reduce its value further until an approximate solution to the system was found.

==Comments==

Gradient descent works in spaces of any number of dimensions, even in infinite-dimensional ones. In the latter case, the search space is typically a function space, and one calculates the Fréchet derivative of the functional to be minimized to determine the descent direction.

That gradient descent works in any number of dimensions (finite number at least) can be seen as a consequence of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, i.e. the magnitude of the inner (dot) product of two vectors of any dimension is maximized when they are colinear. In the case of gradient descent, that would be when the vector of independent variable adjustments is proportional to the gradient vector of partial derivatives.

The gradient descent can take many iterations to compute a local minimum with a required accuracy, if the curvature in different directions is very different for the given function. For such functions, preconditioning, which changes the geometry of the space to shape the function level sets like concentric circles, cures the slow convergence. Constructing and applying preconditioning can be computationally expensive, however.

The gradient descent can be modified via momentums (Nesterov, Polyak, and Frank-Wolfe) and heavy-ball parameters (exponential moving averages and positive-negative momentum). The main examples of such optimizers are Adam, DiffGrad, Yogi, AdaBelief, etc.

Methods based on Newton&#x27;s method and inversion of the Hessian using conjugate gradient techniques can be better alternatives. Generally, such methods converge in fewer iterations, but the cost of each iteration is higher. An example is the BFGS method which consists in calculating on every step a matrix by which the gradient vector is multiplied to go into a &quot;better&quot; direction, combined with a more sophisticated line search algorithm, to find the &quot;best&quot; value of formula_103 For extremely large problems, where the computer-memory issues dominate, a limited-memory method such as L-BFGS should be used instead of BFGS or the steepest descent. 

While it is sometimes possible to substitute gradient descent for a local search algorithm, gradient descent is not in the same family: although it is an iterative method for local optimization, it relies on an objective function’s gradient rather than an explicit exploration of a solution space.

Gradient descent can be viewed as applying Euler&#x27;s method for solving ordinary differential equations formula_104 to a gradient flow. In turn, this equation may be derived as an optimal controller for the control system formula_105 with formula_106 given in feedback form formula_107.
==Modifications==
Gradient descent can converge to a local minimum and slow down in a neighborhood of a saddle point. Even for unconstrained quadratic minimization, gradient descent develops a zig-zag pattern of subsequent iterates as iterations progress, resulting in slow convergence. Multiple modifications of gradient descent have been proposed to address these deficiencies.

===Fast gradient methods===
Yurii Nesterov has proposed a simple modification that enables faster convergence for convex problems and has been since further generalized. For unconstrained smooth problems, the method is called the fast gradient method (FGM) or the accelerated gradient method (AGM). Specifically, if the differentiable function formula_5 is convex and formula_21 is Lipschitz, and it is not assumed that formula_5 is strongly convex, then the error in the objective value generated at each step formula_111 by the gradient descent method will be bounded by formula_112. Using the Nesterov acceleration technique, the error decreases at formula_113. It is known that the rate formula_114 for the decrease of the cost function is optimal for first-order optimization methods. Nevertheless, there is the opportunity to improve the algorithm by reducing the constant factor. The optimized gradient method (OGM) reduces that constant by a factor of two and is an optimal first-order method for large-scale problems.

For constrained or non-smooth problems, Nesterov&#x27;s FGM is called the fast proximal gradient method (FPGM), an acceleration of the proximal gradient method.

===Momentum or &quot;heavy ball&quot; method===
Trying to break the zig-zag pattern of gradient descent, the &quot;momentum or heavy ball method&quot; uses a momentum term in analogy to a heavy ball sliding on the surface of values of the function being minimized, or to mass movement in Newtonian dynamics through a viscous medium in a conservative force field. Gradient descent with momentum remembers the solution update at each iteration, and determines the next update as a linear combination of the gradient and the previous update. For unconstrained quadratic minimization, a theoretical convergence rate bound of the heavy ball method is asymptotically the same as that for the optimal conjugate gradient method.

This technique is used in stochastic gradient descent and as an extension to the backpropagation algorithms used to train artificial neural networks. In the direction of updating, stochastic gradient descent adds a stochastic property. The weights can be used to calculate the derivatives.

==Extensions==
Gradient descent can be extended to handle constraints by including a projection onto the set of constraints. This method is only feasible when the projection is efficiently computable on a computer. Under suitable assumptions, this method converges. This method is a specific case of the forward-backward algorithm for monotone inclusions (which includes convex programming and variational inequalities).

Gradient descent is a special case of mirror descent using the squared Euclidean distance as the given Bregman divergence.

== Theoretical properties ==
The properties of gradient descent depend on the properties of the objective function and the variant of gradient descent used (for example, if a line search step is used). The assumptions made affect the convergence rate, and other properties, that can be proven for gradient descent. For example, if the objective is assumed to be strongly convex and lipschitz smooth, then gradient descent converges linearly with a fixed step size. Looser assumptions lead to either weaker convergence guarantees or require a more sophisticated step size selection.

<text>Anarchy Online is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) published and developed by Norwegian video game development company Funcom. Released in June 2001, the game was the first in the genre to include a science-fiction setting, dynamic quests, instancing, free trials, and in-game advertising. The game&#x27;s ongoing storyline revolves around the fictional desert planet Rubi-Ka, wherein a valuable mineral known as Notum is found. Players assume the role of a new colonist to Rubi-Ka. With no specific objective to win &quot;Anarchy Online&quot;, the player advances the game through the improvement of a character&#x27;s skills over time. After more than 20 years, &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; has become one of the oldest surviving games in the genre.

==Plot==
Fighting for military and political power on Rubi-Ka are the Omni-Tek corporation (who own a thousand-year lease to the planet), as well as separatist clans, terrorist groups, extraterrestrial life, and ancient civilizations. The narrative was developed to be played out as a series of virtual &quot;role-play&quot; events over the course of four years, influenced by the actions of those taking part in the game.

According to the game&#x27;s back story, the Source is the &quot;essence of [all] life&quot; deep inside the planet, which created the first forms of life, who called themselves the Xan. They began as a small, perfect, immortal civilization, living in peace and harmony. The Xans&#x27; eventual discovery and research of the Source changed this. It lead them to create powerful technology and a great civilization, but this made them greedy and arrogant. Two factions formed within the Xan, calling themselves the Redeemed and the Unredeemed. These groups fought over how best to use the Source—now strained and unstable from their tampering. They tried in vain to fix the problem, but discovered that they were too late, as the Source would soon destroy the planet. Rubi-Ka was ripped apart in a cataclysm, leaving it a barren rock. The Source, and small fragments of the Xans&#x27; dead civilization, were thrown into another dimension known as the Shadowlands. The survivors left in search of other habitable planets, where they planted versions of their species, and hoped that one would prosper and eventually return to Rubi-Ka. Earth was one of their destinations.

In the year 28,702 AD, a mining survey ship from the megacorporation Omni-Tek carried to Rubi-Ka the first humans to land on it. The Interstellar Confederation of Corporations (ICC) granted Omni-Tek a one thousand-year lease on the planet shortly after. It was a seemingly useless, arid landscape far from civilization, until the discovery of the mineral Notum, unique to Rubi-Ka. Research of Notum and its properties led to major leaps forward in nanotechnology, making possible the creation of powerful new technology, as well as the resurrection of the dead. After terraforming a portion of Rubi-Ka and constructing several cities, outposts, and transportation infrastructure, the company began importing colonists under contract as miners and other professions.

The first five-hundred years of Omni-Tek&#x27;s control of Rubi-Ka were marked with an exemplary record of worker treatment, but as time passed, their policies degraded. Their scientists&#x27;, tinkering with the mutating effects of Notum on the colonists in a quest for efficiency, lead to many failed experiments. Survivors of these experiments became the game&#x27;s four playable races, or &quot;breeds&quot;, each designed by Omni-Tek to specialize in a type of work. Together with the original Solitus race, were the genetically engineered and herculean Atrox, the intelligent Nanomages, and the nimble Opifexes. They continued to labor in the midst of an increasingly hostile and totalitarian culture. This caused a significant number of workers to rebel, and begin to trade stolen Notum to a rival corporation. These rebel groups, collectively calling themselves the Clans, fought a series of wars with Omni-Tek over the next several centuries.

===Player point of view===
&quot;Anarchy Online&quot;&#x27;s story, from the player&#x27;s point of view, began in 29,475, after the most recent peace treaty had been signed between Omni-Tek and the Clans. ICC peacekeeping troops later moved into some cities to protect neutral observers of the war who had rejected their contractual obligations with Omni-Tek, but did not align themselves with the Clans. Omni-Tek, the Clans, and the neutral observers make up the game&#x27;s three playable factions and control much of Rubi-Ka&#x27;s terraformed surface.

After scientists opened a portal to the Shadowlands, players discovered the Source, killing the guardian the Xan had left there to protect it. This prompted an alien race known as the Kyr&#x27;ozch to begin attacking Rubi-Ka. The story&#x27;s current plots revolve around the fight by all sides for control of the planet.

==Gameplay==
Players assume the roles of new colonists to Rubi-Ka or the Shadowlands. The game world is occupied by human players and computer-controlled characters, both friendly and hostile. The game begins with the player creating a unique character, choosing its name, gender, height, weight, and facial features. Each character is also one of the four humanoid &quot;breeds&quot;. The final choice is that of the character&#x27;s profession, similar to the character classes of other role-playing games.

The game&#x27;s multiplayer nature and &quot;free-form&quot; gameplay encourage creating personal networks, and cooperating and fighting with other players. Players interact with &quot;Anarchy Online&quot;&#x27;s interface via a keyboard and mouse. The game&#x27;s heads-up display consists of a series of windows, menus and buttons located on the periphery of the screen. Players communicate with each other by typing text in chat windows, and occasionally through emotive character animations. Communication with computer-controlled characters is executed via text windows, in which players chose from a menu of possible responses to the conversation being shown. Like most role-playing games, &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; provides structure for role-playing events, organized either by players or officially by Funcom staff. Most major cities include night clubs and other venues specifically for this.

Groups of players, large or small, are often required to complete objectives. In addition to forming teams and informal chat groups, joining a player organization is encouraged. These are, like guilds in similar games, officially recognized groups bound together for technical and social benefits. Organizations are able to build their own cities across the game world, control areas of land, run player markets, and access other special content.

Among the most distinct gameplay elements of &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; are dynamic missions. Missions, or quests, are a traditional gameplay element in the role-playing genre. The player or team is given a set of tasks—usually related to the story—to complete somewhere in the game world; in return, they are rewarded with experience points, items, and money. Dynamic missions are similar to traditional missions in purpose, but are created at the player&#x27;s request. Once they choose its difficulty and other options, the game generates a new, indoor area filled with computer-controlled enemies. The player or team is told to go to its location and finish a task inside for their reward. Dynamic missions, like many other encounters in &quot;Anarchy Online&quot;, are &quot;instanced&quot;: each mission area is available only to those assigned it.

===Skill system===
Much of what characters can do, and how well they do it, is determined by the game&#x27;s eighty-three distinct character skills. A skill is a numerical representation of a character&#x27;s proficiency in an area of skill, starting from zero. As players kill computer-controlled enemies, they gain experience points for their character. After gaining enough points, the character levels up. The current maximum level is 220. At each new level, the character is given &quot;skill points&quot;, which are used to increase any combination they choose of the eighty-three skills.

Any character can access and increase any skill. The character&#x27;s profession, however, provides unique resources called &quot;perks&quot;, &quot;alien perks&quot;, &quot;research&quot;, and &quot;nano programs&quot; that increase specific skill further. This makes each profession more adept at elements of gameplay than others. Doctors, for instance, can increase skills related to healing much higher than a Soldier because of these additional resources. Perks are chosen from a menu when the character reaches certain levels. Alien perks are gained when the player kills enough of a specific type of alien enemy. Research is gained by diverting a percentage of earned experience points toward personal or faction-specific research projects, instead of new levels. Nano programs give temporary increases to certain skills.

===Combat===
After targeting another character and initiating combat, the player and his opponent will damage each other automatically with their weapons. This continues until the player stops or the target is dead. Each profession&#x27;s unique nano programs, perks and research also provide combat abilities used by the player during the fight. These can heal the owner, cause additional damage, lower the skills of the enemy, blind them or otherwise hinder the enemy&#x27;s ability to fight. Once the target is dead, the player is able to loot money and items from the enemy&#x27;s body. After death, the character&#x27;s skills are reduced for several minutes, making them much less powerful in combat during that period.

Combat between two or more human players, called player versus player or &quot;PvP&quot; is encouraged by both the reward of special equipment and the social nature of the game. Killing other players also rewards characters with a &quot;PvP ranking&quot;, permanently shown beside the player&#x27;s name, which represents how many other human players they have killed. Player versus player combat is controlled by the percentage of &quot;suppression gas&quot; in the area that dictates whether a player can start combat unprovoked with another player. Generally, this percentage approaches 100% in major cities, providing safe havens, and decreases while moving to more remote areas.

Combat was updated with the release of the Battlestation expansion. This allowed for a pure PvP environment where Clan and Omni players could square off in a spacestation arena, with Neutrals able to join any side. Much later, due to a declining playerbase, Clans and Omni were allowed to join teams side by side. Battlestation points were scored by capturing &quot;capping&quot; up to four locations, one in the middle and three down long corridors; teleporters shortened the distance between the corridor ends. Battlestation allowed for much higher team and individual kill scores; the highest scoring team kill player of all time was Ndonaden (a doctor class Omni).

==History==
===Development===
Preliminary development for &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; began in 1995 at Funcom&#x27;s Oslo, Norway studios. Up until that point, the company had only developed offline video games for consoles, including the critically successful &quot;Speed Punks&quot; for the PlayStation. In a 2007 interview, former project leader Gaute Godager said Funcom&#x27;s management wanted to put substantial resources into developing a new MMORPG; they believed the genre&#x27;s user base would expand in the coming years. Unlike most other games in the genre, which had traditional role-playing fantasy themes, &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; featured a science-fiction theme. The game would also feature a relatively large playable area, and graphics that were, at the time, more advanced than existing MMORPGs. Godager said he and many other developers saw the idea as &quot;crazy&quot;, describing the project as &quot;very ambitious&quot;. The project&#x27;s team grew steadily between 1995 and 2001 to include at least 70 developers.

In a 2001 interview, gameworld designer Morten Byom said that the process of creating Rubi-Ka&#x27;s virtual world had &quot;taken more time and effort than anyone imagined&quot; when they first started. The team took inspiration from a number of sources including science-fiction books, films, architecture in Oslo, and other games in the genre. They said that one of the biggest challenges was finding ways to encourage players to use the entire game world as they play, not to &quot;gather in one corner&quot;. Byom said that he wanted to give the world as much detail as possible to make the game &quot;convincing&quot; to the player.

Composers Morten Sørlie, Tor Linløkken, and Bjørn Arve Lagim created the soundtrack and music of &quot;Anarchy Online&quot;. Using a system they call &quot;Sample-based Interactive Music&quot;, the game mixes numerous music samples to create dynamic music. By starting, stopping, fading, and layering samples based on where the player is, and what they are doing, the game creates a continuous stream of background music. Bjørn Arve Lagim said that the music is inspired by the &quot;traditional sound&quot; of a film score, using both orchestral and electronic instruments. Longer full-length versions of some songs were later released on compact disc with a special edition of the game in 2002.

&quot;Anarchy Online&quot; was officially announced at the 2000 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). GameSpot, and other online sites, published articles tracking the game&#x27;s development over the next year. It made its second appearance at E3 in May 2001, one month before launch. Based on the beta version shown there, GameSpot said they were confident in the game&#x27;s progress, given what they have seen. At the European Computer Trade Show in 2001 it was awarded &quot;Multiplayer Game of Show&quot;. A public beta test began two weeks before launch, during which 100,000 players downloaded and played pre-release versions of the game, helping the company find bugs and other technical problems with the software.

===Release===
&quot;Anarchy Online&quot; officially launched to the public on June 27, 2001, in the United States and Norway and on September 28 of the same year in the rest of Europe. In addition to being distributed as a retail box from physical and online stores, &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; was one of the first MMORPGs available via online digital distribution.

During its first month of release many stability, registration, and billing issues hurt public perception of the game. Some gaming reporters claimed it was the worst launch of an MMO in the history of the genre. Funcom spent about 6 months fixing the game, particularly the beginning experience. The company then took the &quot;fixed game&quot; on a press tour to convince reporters to give it another try, even though reviews and scores had been printed months before. At the same time, the company needed to build subscribers, which was very difficult given the reputation of the game. Funcom introduced the first &quot;free trial&quot; of the game and gave out returned boxed copies for free at the 2002 Game Developer&#x27;s Conference. Some gaming publications informed their readers of the improved game, although they did not change their original scores. By the end of that year, &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; had recovered from the launch woes and won the MMO of the Year award from &quot;PC Gamer&quot;. The company went on to create expansions, including the &quot;Shadowlands&quot; expansion in 2003 that earned several &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice&quot; awards.

Two months after its release in August 2001, Funcom began offering free trial subscriptions, now common practice for other games in the MMOG genre. New players were able to sign up for accounts that remained free for a limited number of days. This required them to supply some personal information, including a credit card number. After their trial period, players could either cancel their accounts, or keep them to continue playing the game at the cost of the monthly subscription fee.

===Expansions===
Periodic free updates are released as content patches on an average of three per month since the game&#x27;s release. These fix bugs, and add relatively small amounts of new content. The patches are downloaded and installed automatically when players start the game software. Larger updates, called expansion packs and booster packs, are available for purchase to further extend the game, typically adding new playable areas, creatures, equipment, and story progression. Expansions tend to introduce large amounts of new content; boosters are considered &quot;too large&quot; for a patch, but &quot;not large enough&quot; to warrant a full expansion.

===Free Play program ===
In December 2004, Funcom replaced trial subscriptions with a business model supported by in-game advertising called the &quot;Free Play&quot; program. Under this program, new players are allowed indefinite access to the full original game without supplying a credit card number. With the exception of the first booster pack &quot;Notum Wars&quot;, the offer does not include access to content added with expansion or booster packs. Free subscribers are shown advertisements provided by Massive Incorporated, a company that supplies in-game advertising. The ads appear on virtual billboards placed in high traffic areas of the game world. Paying customers have the option to replace these ads with ones for fictitious products related to the game. Free subscribers may also purchase paid points to participate in micro-transactions and purchase in-game items that do not directly impact combat related gameplay.

The Free Play program was originally set to last one year, but its length has been extended every year since its creation. As of April 2020, the free to play program still exists. Former game director Craig Morrison stated in a 2008 interview that the program has been a vital part of the success of the game. In January 2008, Funcom rebranded their subscription model as a &quot;tier subscription system&quot;, adding a third options for customers to access to the game. Customers can access the original game and &quot;Notum Wars&quot; booster pack for free via the Free Play program, pay the full monthly subscription fee for access to all expansion and booster packs, or pay a reduced monthly fee for access to only the &quot;Shadowlands&quot; expansion pack. The &quot;Shadowlands&quot;-only option was later removed.

===Present===
The &quot;Free Play&quot; program, started in 2004, allows new players indefinite access to the original game in return for viewing in-game advertisements. Vital to the game&#x27;s continued operation, the program created 400,000 new subscriptions in its first ten months, and had generated US$1 million in advertising revenue by 2006.

By June 2007 Funcom began to update the game&#x27;s 3D rendering engine. While the current engine — Funcom&#x27;s proprietary Dreamworld — had received incremental improvements with the &quot;Notum Wars&quot; booster in 2002 and &quot;Shadowlands&quot; expansion in 2003, the 2008 announcement stated that it would be completely replaced with more modern software to &quot;release the game fresh&quot;. Originally, a modified version of the open-source rendering engine OGRE was used. Funcom released a short video demonstrating an early version of its implementation, and said that it would be completed by the end of 2008. OGRE was dropped in May 2009 because it did not provide &quot;the full featureset&quot; they had anticipated. Current game director Colin Cragg revealed that &quot;Anarchy Online&quot;″s &quot;small development team&quot; could not afford the &quot;growing [cost] estimates&quot; involved in making the necessary modifications to it.

Funcom decided to instead use a recent version of the Dreamworld engine, the same version used for their 2008 MMORPG &quot;Age of Conan&quot;. This new engine features improved water rendering, particle effects, and character animation. It also includes incremental improvements to technologies already used in &quot;Anarchy Online&quot;, such as the dynamic weather system. No new release date has been announced, although periodic status updates are published in the game&#x27;s official weekly development blog &quot;Friday With Means&quot;.

Also introduced in 2008, Funcom added micro-transactions to the game called &quot;paid points&quot;, which may be acquired through several ways. First, players may purchase them outright via their account management page, which then becomes available to their characters in game. Alternatively, players are also awarded bonus &quot;paid points&quot; based on number of months of subscription purchased. These &quot;paid points&quot; may be used to purchase items that were given as pre-order bonuses such as a fully decor-able apartment in game, or newly created vehicles that are otherwise not available through in-game currency called &quot;credits&quot;. All items available for purchase with &quot;paid points&quot; are strictly cosmetic in nature, with the exception of a &quot;Personal Scout Mech&quot;, a combat vehicle that was a pre-order bonus for the &quot;Lost Eden&quot; expansion.

In 2010, the player community became involved in development of the game, with community-created inventory icons and planet map being accepted into the official game.

A game engine upgrade was originally slated for release in 2013. The new engine, also used for &quot;Age of Conan&quot; and &quot;The Secret World&quot;, was planned to be supported concurrently with the previous engine.

This new &#x27;dreamworld&#x27; engine was successfully released to the public for use on the live servers on June 25, 2015. While the engine is still in a &#x27;beta&#x27; state, it is available for use with the &#x27;live&#x27; production servers.

===Server mergers===
For much of its existence, &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; featured two game servers for English-speaking players, Atlantean and Rimor, and one for German-speaking players, Die Neue Welt. In 2010, Die Neue Welt was brought offline with most of its player population distributed between the two English-speaking servers. In 2013, the two remaining English servers, Atlantean and Rimor merged to form a single unifying server to host remaining &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; players.

==Music==
Following an innovative concept for the release time, game&#x27;s music was thought to stick interactively with ingame actions, taking many parameters into account (area, faction, activity, danger, time, etc.). To accomplish this, the various musical tracks of the game were divided into 1400 sound files of 5 to 10 seconds in order to adapt in realtime to any event.

Their musical composition was done before game release and then following various extensions by several musicians: first and mainly, composers Morten Sørlie, Tor Linløkken and Bjørn Arve Lagim on classic game and then its &quot;Shadowlands&quot; expansion; a part of these works were released through two Compact Disc volumes in 2001 and 2004. Composer Leon Willett joined in for &quot;Lost Eden&quot; extension in 2006 and electro band Ayria in 2009 during the addition of the virtual club named &quot;The Grind&quot; accessible ingame from ICC.

All the music linked to the game, unreleased and animated series included, were gathered into a collection of 4 volumes of 56 tracks free to download (packed with all visuals to self-print CDs &amp; booklets) through Steam for AO&#x27;s 16th birthday.

==Reception==
After the launch of &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; and the subsequent technical problems, Funcom issued a statement to reviewers asking them to hold back on a full review until the studio solved these problems. Some video game reviewers, such as &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot;, published reviews anyway; others, such as GameSpy who described the game as &quot;nearly unplayable&quot;, chose to wait one month before publishing a formal review. The troubled release has had a lasting effect on the game&#x27;s reputation, and is nearly always mentioned in the generally positive reviews of later expansion packs as a juxtaposition.

While &quot;Anarchy Online&quot;&#x27;s launch problems had a negative effect on initial critics, the game itself was generally reviewed favorably; it scored an average of 7.6 out of 10 from GameSpy, GameSpot, and IGN. GameSpy later described it as a promising game with some big technical flaws. IGN called it a &quot;brilliant, engaging, profound MMORPG&quot;, but added it came with &quot;atrocious&quot; technical problems. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; magazine said that it &quot;will be the next great MMORPG&quot;, but that the game needed &quot;some serious work&quot; before it would reach its potential; they would award the game with &quot;Best Massively Multiplayer Game&quot; the next year.

&quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; described &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; as a &quot;&#x27;science-fiction&#x27; &quot;EverQuest&quot;&quot; (which was a popular fantasy MMORPG at the time) in that it took the traditional fantasy elements of the genre and gave them &quot;science-y sounding&quot; words. They went on to praise the game&#x27;s large, detailed game world, and its &quot;evolutionary&quot; user interface. GameSpy said the game&#x27;s soundtrack was &quot;grand, cinematic, and very appropriate&quot; in their review. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; magazine said that the intricate skill system gave the game &quot;incredible character depth&quot;.

The dynamic mission system was met with mixed reviews. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; called it a &quot;brilliant&quot; solution to camping — the practice of waiting for a computer - controlled character in the outdoor game world to appear so that it can be killed and items looted. &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; said that while the missions were a good idea in theory, they are &quot;too simple and similar&quot;, claiming that this caused players to become bored and camp for items outside anyway. Visually, they called the missions &quot;cramped, boxy, and generally unappealing&quot;, compared to the rest of the game.

The editors of &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; later named &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; the best massively multiplayer game of 2001. They wrote that after &quot;AO&quot;″s abysmal launch and well-deserved public drubbing, Funcom dedicated itself to fixing the game&#x27;s mayor problems and the result was admirable.

The first booster pack &quot;Notum Wars&quot; was released in 2002; at that time, the first expansion pack &quot;Shadowlands&quot; had already been announced. Staci Krause of IGN noted the new character creation interface made the game&#x27;s introduction to new players easier. The &quot;land control&quot; areas, one of the major additions in &quot;Notum Wars&quot;, were described by Krause as &quot;not only interesting, but fun&quot;. She also said that the new additions to the game world, and improvements to the 3D rendering engine, &quot;add to the sense that Rubi-Ka is a busy planet&quot;. Yahoo! criticized the land control areas as being complicated and expensive, and said that participation in battles was difficult for players not in an organization. During the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Notum Wars&quot; for &quot;Massive Multiplayer/Persistent World Game of the Year&quot;.

The &quot;Shadowlands&quot; expansion was the most critically acclaimed by far, winning several &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice&quot; Awards from IGN, CNet, GameSpot, GameSpy and others in 2003. Critics applauded the size and scope of it, such as Andrew Park of GameSpot who called it &quot;absolutely enormous&quot;. Tom Chick of GameSpy praised the &quot;distinctive and exotic&quot; art direction of the new areas. Critics of &quot;Shadowlands&quot; noted that the expansion&#x27;s design was too &quot;fantasy oriented&quot;, as compared to the original game.

&quot;Alien Invasion&quot;, released in 2004, did not receive the same abundance of praise as its predecessor, although most scores were above 7 out of 10. The new content it introduced, in critics&#x27; eyes, was not designed for new players. G4 TV wrote that it would be a &quot;tough sell to new players&quot;, but added it &quot;offer[s] existing players a solid reason to keep playing&quot;. GameSpy wrote that the expansion&#x27;s new features, such as improved user interface and chat system make the game more enjoyable to play.

After twelve years, &quot;Anarchy Online&quot; has become one of the longest-running MMORPGs in operation. Publications who had reviewed the game&#x27;s previous additions did not review the &quot;Lost Eden&quot; expansion in 2006, or the &quot;Legacy of The Xan&quot; booster in 2009. GamesRadar+&#x27;s Sarah Borger wrote of &quot;Lost Eden&quot; that the game&#x27;s aging graphics and user interface &quot;make the world hard to interact with&quot;, but she went on to acclaim the new player versus player content it added.

===Sales and subscriptions===
Five days after the game&#x27;s launch, public relations director Marit Lund announced that &quot;35,000 registered accounts&quot; had been created. In the United States, &quot;Anarchy Online&quot;″s sales reached 47,356 units by the first week of November 2001, a performance that GameSpot&#x27;s Desslock described as &quot;woeful&quot;. By 2002, the total number of subscriptions created since launch was stated as 150,000. After the release of the &quot;Shadowlands&quot; and &quot;Alien Invasion&quot; expansion packs, total subscriptions had risen to 700,000 in late 2004. Sales of the game, its expansion packs, and monthly customer subscriptions had generated US$28 million dollars by 2005.

The &quot;free play&quot; program, started in 2004, has had the most significant effect on subscriptions to date. More than 400,000 players signed up for free subscriptions in the program&#x27;s first ten months according to Funcom CEO Trond Arne Aas. The next year, the number of free subscriptions created, independent of paid subscriptions, was stated as one million. The income from the program—which had generated $1,000,000 by its second year—supplements revenue from paid accounts.

Funcom attributed &quot;higher than expected&quot; company profits in 2006 to &quot;Lost Eden&quot;&#x27;s release in December of that year. Subscription revenue during this time was described as &quot;steady&quot; and &quot;profitable&quot;. Subscription revenue remained &quot;steady&quot; for the next three years, until 2009 when they were described as &quot;slowly declining&quot;. It was said that close to two million subscriptions, both free and paid, had been created by July 2008.

<text>Funcom Oslo AS (formerly Funcom Productions AS) is a Norwegian video game developer and publisher that specializes in online games. It is best known for the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) titles &quot;Conan Exiles&quot;, &quot;Age of Conan&quot;, &quot;Anarchy Online&quot;, &quot;The Secret World&quot; – and &quot;The Longest Journey&quot; series of adventure games. The company has offices in Oslo, Norway; North Carolina, US; Lisbon, Portugal; Bucharest, Romania; and Stockholm, Sweden. It also had offices in Beijing, Dublin, and Montreal previously. It is now owned by the Chinese media conglomerate Tencent.

==History==

Founded in 1993 by Erik Gloersen, Tyr Neilsen, Andre Backen, Gaute Godager and Olav Mørkrid, the company started as an independent game developer and publisher. It focuses mainly on PC games but have also released games on other platforms, including mobile phones and tablets. Funcom&#x27;s console releases includes titles on Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Super NES, Sega Saturn, Xbox, Xbox One and PS4.

In 1994 Funcom Dublin was set up to concentrate on console games. It originally had 20 employees. By July 2000 this had grown to 25. With the parent company choosing to focus on a massive multiplayer online title, Anarchy Online, the decision was made to close this subsidiary in August 2001.

In late 2000s, Funcom opened a new office in North Carolina, increasing its staff to handle the final stages of releasing its sci-fi online RPG, Anarchy Online. The new location was also chosen so that it could offer effective customer service to North American players.

In December 2005, Funcom N.V. (), the Dutch parent company of Funcom Oslo, was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.

On March 14, 2007, the company abandoned traditional physical product distribution (e.g., on optical discs) in favor of digital distribution completely. The main reason for this decision was claimed to be the financial losses due to software piracy.

On August 21, 2008, Funcom laid off half of its customer service department located in Durham, North Carolina. On November 22, 2008, third parties reported that Funcom fired an additional 70% of the staff in their US workforce, possibly endangering future releases.

On September 17, 2008, Gaute Godager left Funcom, stating he was dissatisfied with certain elements of &quot;Age of Conan&quot;, which he directed. Craig Morrison took over the direction of &quot;Age of Conan&quot;.

On February 23, 2009, Funcom reported financial losses of approximately $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The unsuccessful launch of &quot;Age of Conan&quot; was cited as the reason for such a steep decline. The chief analyst of DnB NOR, Fredrik Thoresen, estimated that 100,000 subscribers played the game at the time of the report, far below the publisher&#x27;s expectations, though these numbers were not confirmed by Funcom itself.

On September 1, 2009, Funcom announced the establishment of a new development studio in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The new studio has worked on Funcom&#x27;s two MMORPG projects: &quot;The Secret World&quot; and the &quot;Age of Conan&quot; expansion pack &quot;Rise of the Godslayer&quot;.

On September 29, 2009, Funcom announced a reduction of 20% of its staff, resulting in a &quot;significant delay&quot; for the release of &quot;The Secret World&quot;.

All the perceived actions were reflected in the 2010 Annual Financial Report. The current number of employees is 282 (a 19% reduction to 2009). As the result of the new strategy, the operating results came close to a positive value — in 2010 it reached — US$593 thousand compared to — US$10 798 thousand in 2009.

On July 2, 2012, Funcom announced Ole Schreiner as the new CEO of Funcom and as a new member of the management board of Funcom. Ole Schreiner comes from the position of COO of the company, a role he has held for several years. Ole Schreiner is one of Funcom&#x27;s longest-serving employees and he has been working directly with titles such as &quot;Anarchy Online&quot;, &quot;Age of Conan&quot; and &quot;The Secret World&quot; in several capacities. Trond Arne Aas, long-term CEO of Funcom, took on a new role as Strategic Advisor to the Board and Chief Strategy Officer.

On August 22, 2012, Funcom announced that it laid off half of the company as a cost-adjustment initiative due to the poor performance of their MMORPG &quot;The Secret World&quot;. Some of the lay-offs were temporary. They blamed this poor performance on the Metacritic score of the game and the launch of competing titles like &quot;Diablo III&quot;.

On January 10, 2013, Funcom announced that they had initiated a process of restructuring the company around its core products and technology. The restructuring involved, among other things, that some of the company&#x27;s offices would be closed or consolidated with others. Thus, Funcom hoped to create a stronger and more effective organization.

The company announced on January 17, 2013, that it would lay off some of its staff of their Montreal branch as a part of the restructuring process.

On January 29, 2014, Norwegian economic crime unit Økokrim launched an investigation into suspected infringement of the provisions of the Securities Trading Act connected to the 2012 launch of &quot;The Secret World&quot;. In October 2015, the case against Funcom was closed after the company paid a fine.

On April 24, 2014, the company reported securing NOK 9.7 million (US$1.6 million) additional equity. The additional cash boost helped the company to fully prepare for the launch of the LEGO Minifigures MMO in summer 2014.

In May 2015, Rui Casais takes on the CEO role at Funcom, after a 7 years tenure as Chief Technology Officer. His career at Funcom started in 2004 when Casais joined as a Junior AI programmer and 10 years later became the CEO. During this time, he helped to develop and implement features and tools for all parts of game development, facilitated operational matters, developed partnerships and created long-term business strategies that contributed to the company’s success.

In October 2015, the company launched &quot;The Park&quot;, a single-player horror experience based on &quot;The Secret World&quot; intellectual property.

In December 2015, the company announced that it had entered into a partnership agreement with Conan Properties International LLC, making it the preferred partner for PC and console games based on the Conan the Barbarian brand.

In January 2016, the company announced it was working on &quot;Conan Exiles&quot;, an open-world survival game based on the Conan the Barbarian brand. The game released on Steam PC Early Access on January 31, 2017, and launched on the Xbox One as part of the Game Preview program in August 2017.

In March 2017, the company announced it would relaunch &quot;The Secret World&quot; as &quot;Secret World Legends&quot;, the free-to-play reboot of the original 2012 MMORPG. It launched June 2017, and was made available on Steam in July 2017. There have been no substantial updates to the game since October 2018.

In August 2017, the company revealed a new logo and branding alongside a positioning that openly acknowledges low points in the company&#x27;s history.

On 8 January 2019, it was announced that Funcom had acquired 50.1% of the Lisbon, Portugal-based company Zona Paradoxal, Lda (&quot;ZPX&quot;) with whom it has had a working relationship since 2017.

On 26 February 2019, Funcom announced that it was entering into an exclusive partnership with Legendary Entertainment to develop games related to the upcoming &quot;Dune&quot; films.

Tencent Holdings acquired a 29% minority stake in Funcom in September 2019, making it the largest shareholder in the company. Tencent announced in January 2020 its intent to fully acquire Funcom through purchasing all outstanding shares of the company in February 2020 valued at .

In June 2021, Funcom acquired Swedish video game developer The Outsiders, while the company also announced plans to open a new studio in Romania. The company&#x27;s newest office, Funcom Bucharest, opened in September and serves for the moment as the company’s headquarters for quality assurance, with plans in place to expand to other areas of game development over time.

Funcom acquired Cabinet Group, which owns the intellectual property rights of &quot;Conan&quot;, &quot;Mutant&quot;, and Solomon Kane and other works based on the writings of Robert E. Howard, in September 2021. Funcom stated that with this acquisition, that alongside a new game, they planned to merge these into a new studio Heroic Signatures and release a new game based on these properties. On December 2, 2021, it was announced that they signed an agreement with NUKKLEAR for assistance on Funcom&#x27;s upcoming &quot;Dune&quot; survival video game.

==Portfolio==
&quot;The Longest Journey&quot; was produced by Ragnar Tørnquist and was very well-received both by critics and users. The game was published in 9 languages: English, Norwegian, French, Dutch, Swedish, Italian, Polish, Russian and Spanish. The game was also released in other countries, but mainly in English-speaking ones.

&quot;Anarchy Online&quot; is a critically acclaimed online game, more specifically a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), with 20 international awards. Funcom issued several expansions: &quot;The Notum Wars&quot;, &quot;Shadowlands&quot;, &quot;Alien Invasion&quot;, &quot;Lost Eden&quot; and &quot;Legacy of The Xan&quot;. Founder Gaute Godager was the first Game Director, before Marius Enge released &quot;Alien Invasion&quot; and took over at the release of &quot;Shadowlands&quot;. However, shortly after the release of &quot;Alien Invasion&quot;, Morten Byom took over. Later, near the release of the &quot;Lost Eden&quot; expansion, Byom moved on to the &quot;Age of Conan&quot; team, and was succeeded as Game Director by Craig Morrison, also known as &quot;Silirrion&quot;. Following the game, a book about the prehistory of the planet and a CD with music from the game were released.

In the spring of 2006, the company released the sequel to &quot;The Longest Journey&quot; for the Xbox and PC, entitled &quot;Dreamfall&quot;.

Funcom has also developed an online action role-playing video game for PC and console entitled &quot;Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures&quot;. This product utilizes the Conan the Cimmerian franchise license. The PC version of this game was released on May 20, 2008, and the Xbox 360 version was cancelled. As of 2011, the subscription model of the game has been altered to a hybrid game is marketed as &quot;Age of Conan: Unchained&quot;.

<text>The lead-acid battery is a type of rechargeable battery first invented in 1859 by French physicist Gaston Planté. It is the first type of rechargeable battery ever created. Compared to modern rechargeable batteries, lead-acid batteries have relatively low energy density. Despite this, they are able to supply high surge currents. These features, along with their low cost, make them attractive for use in motor vehicles in order to provide the high current required by starter motors. Lead-acid batteries suffer from relatively short cycle lifespan (usually less than 500 deep cycles) and overall lifespan (due to the &quot;double sulfation&quot; in the discharged state), as well as long charging times.

As they are not expensive compared to newer technologies, lead-acid batteries are widely used even when surge current is not important and other designs could provide higher energy densities. In 1999, lead-acid battery sales accounted for 40–50% of the value from batteries sold worldwide (excluding China and Russia), equivalent to a manufacturing market value of about US$15 billion. Large-format lead-acid designs are widely used for storage in backup power supplies in telecommunications networks such as for cell sites, high-availability emergency power systems as used in hospitals, and stand-alone power systems. For these roles, modified versions of the standard cell may be used to improve storage times and reduce maintenance requirements. &quot;Gel cell&quot; and &quot;absorbed glass mat&quot; batteries are common in these roles, collectively known as &quot;valve-regulated lead-acid&quot; (&quot;VRLA&quot;) &quot;batteries&quot;.

When charged, the battery&#x27;s chemical energy is stored in the potential difference between metallic lead at the negative side and lead dioxide on the positive side.

== History ==
The French scientist Nicolas Gautherot observed in 1801 that wires that had been used for electrolysis experiments would themselves provide a small amount of &quot;secondary&quot; current after the main battery had been disconnected. In 1859, Gaston Planté&#x27;s lead-acid battery was the first battery that could be recharged by passing a reverse current through it. Planté&#x27;s first model consisted of two lead sheets separated by rubber strips and rolled into a spiral. His batteries were first used to power the lights in train carriages while stopped at a station. In 1881, Camille Alphonse Faure invented an improved version that consisted of a lead grid lattice into which a lead oxide paste was pressed, forming a plate. This design was easier to mass-produce. An early manufacturer (from 1886) of lead-acid batteries was Henri Tudor.

Using a gel electrolyte instead of a liquid allows the battery to be used in different positions without leaking. Gel electrolyte batteries for any position were first used in the late 1920s, and in the 1930s, portable suitcase radio sets allowed the cell to be mounted vertically or horizontally (but not inverted) due to valve design. In the 1970s, the &quot;valve-regulated lead-acid&quot; (&quot;VRLA&quot;), or &quot;sealed&quot;, battery was developed, including modern &quot;absorbed glass mat&quot; (&quot;AGM&quot;) types, allowing operation in any position.

It was discovered early in 2011 that lead-acid batteries do in fact use some aspects of relativity to function, and to a lesser degree, liquid metal and molten-salt batteries such as the Ca-Sb and Sn-Bi also use this effect.

==Electrochemistry==

===Discharge===

In the discharged state, both the positive and negative plates become lead(II) sulfate (), and the electrolyte loses much of its dissolved sulfuric acid and becomes primarily water.

;Negative plate reaction:Pb(s) + (aq) → (s) + (aq) + 2e−

The release of two conduction electrons gives the lead electrode a negative charge.

As electrons accumulate, they create an electric field that attracts hydrogen ions and repels sulfate ions, leading to a double layer near the surface. The hydrogen ions screen the charged electrode from the solution, which limits further reaction unless charge is allowed to flow out of the electrode.
;Positive plate reaction:(s) + (aq) + 3(aq) + 2e− → (s) + 2(l)

taking advantage of the metallic conductivity of .

;The total reaction can be written as

:(s) + (s) + 2(aq) → 2(s) + 2(l) formula_1

The net energy released per mole (207 g) of Pb(s) converted to (s) is approximately 400 kJ, corresponding to the formation of 36 g of water. The sum of the molecular masses of the reactants is 642.6 g/mole, so theoretically a cell can produce two faradays of charge (192,971 coulombs) from 642.6 g of reactants, or 83.4 ampere-hours per kilogram for a 2-volt cell (or 13.9 ampere-hours per kilogram for a 12-volt battery). This comes to 167 watt-hours per kilogram of reactants, but in practice, a lead-acid cell gives only 30–40 watt-hours per kilogram of battery, due to the mass of the water and other constituent parts.

===Charging===

In the fully charged state, the negative plate consists of lead and the positive plate is lead dioxide. The electrolyte solution has a higher concentration of aqueous sulfuric acid, which stores most of the chemical energy.

Overcharging with high charging voltages generates oxygen and hydrogen gas by electrolysis of water, which bubbles out and is lost. The design of some types of lead-acid battery (e.g., &quot;flooded&quot;, but not VRLA (AGM or gel)) allows the electrolyte level to be inspected and topped up with pure water to replace any that has been lost this way.

===Effect of charge level on freezing point===
Because of freezing-point depression, the electrolyte is more likely to freeze in a cold environment when the battery has a low charge and a correspondingly low sulfuric acid concentration.

===Ion motion===
During discharge, produced at the negative plates moves into the electrolyte solution and is then consumed at the positive plates, while is consumed at both plates. The reverse occurs during the charge. This motion can be electrically-driven proton flow (the Grotthuss mechanism), or by diffusion through the medium, or by the flow of a liquid electrolyte medium. Since the electrolyte density is greater when the sulfuric acid concentration is higher, the liquid will tend to circulate by convection. Therefore, a liquid-medium cell tends to rapidly discharge and rapidly charge more efficiently than an otherwise-similar gel cell.

==Measuring the charge level==
Because the electrolyte takes part in the charge-discharge reaction, this battery has one major advantage over other chemistries: it is relatively simple to determine the state of charge by merely measuring the specific gravity of the electrolyte; the specific gravity falls as the battery discharges. Some battery designs include a simple hydrometer using colored floating balls of differing density. When used in diesel-electric submarines, the specific gravity was regularly measured and written on a blackboard in the control room to indicate how much longer the boat could remain submerged.

The battery&#x27;s open-circuit voltage can also be used to gauge the state of charge. If the connections to the individual cells are accessible, then the state of charge of each cell can be determined which can provide a guide as to the state of health of the battery as a whole; otherwise, the overall battery voltage may be assessed.

==Voltages for common usage==
IUoU battery charging is a three-stage charging procedure for lead-acid batteries. A lead-acid battery&#x27;s nominal voltage is 2.2 V for each cell. For a single cell, the voltage can range from 1.8 V loaded at full discharge, to 2.10 V in an open circuit at full charge.

Float voltage varies depending on battery type (flooded cells, gelled electrolyte, absorbed glass mat), and ranges from 1.8 V to 2.27 V. Equalization voltage, and charging voltage for sulfated cells, can range from 2.67 V to almost 3 V (only until a charge current is flowing). Specific values for a given battery depend on the design and manufacturer recommendations, and are usually given at a baseline temperature of , requiring adjustment for ambient conditions. IEEE Standard 485-2020 (first published in 1997) is the industry&#x27;s recommended practice for sizing lead–acid batteries in stationary applications. 

==Construction==
===Plates===
The lead–acid cell can be demonstrated using sheet lead plates for the two electrodes. However, such a construction produces only around one ampere for roughly postcard-sized plates, and for only a few minutes.

Gaston Planté found a way to provide a much larger effective surface area. In Planté&#x27;s design, the positive and negative plates were formed of two spirals of lead foil, separated with a sheet of cloth and coiled up. The cells initially had low capacity, so a slow process of &quot;forming&quot; was required to corrode the lead foils, creating lead dioxide on the plates and roughening them to increase surface area. Initially, this process used electricity from primary batteries; when generators became available after 1870, the cost of producing batteries greatly declined. Planté plates are still used in some stationary applications, where the plates are mechanically grooved to increase their surface area.

In 1880, Camille Alphonse Faure patented a method of coating a lead grid (which serves as the current conductor) with a paste of lead oxides, sulfuric acid, and water, followed by curing phase in which the plates were exposed to gentle heat in a high-humidity environment. The curing process changed the paste into a mixture of lead sulfates which adhered to the lead plate. Then, during the battery&#x27;s initial charge (called &quot;formation&quot;), the cured paste on the plates was converted into electrochemically active material (the &quot;active mass&quot;). Faure&#x27;s process significantly reduced the time and cost to manufacture lead–acid batteries, and gave a substantial increase in capacity compared with Planté&#x27;s battery. Faure&#x27;s method is still in use today, with only incremental improvements to paste composition, curing (which is still done with steam, but is now a very tightly controlled process), and structure and composition of the grid to which the paste is applied.

The grid developed by Faure was of pure lead with connecting rods of lead at right angles. In contrast, present-day grids are structured for improved mechanical strength and improved current flow. In addition to different grid patterns (ideally, all points on the plate are equidistant from the power conductor), modern-day processes also apply one or two thin fiberglass mats over the grid to distribute the weight more evenly. And while Faure had used pure lead for his grids, within a year (1881) these had been superseded by lead–antimony (8–12%) alloys to give the structures additional rigidity. However, high-antimony grids have higher hydrogen evolution (which also accelerates as the battery ages), and thus greater outgassing and higher maintenance costs. These issues were identified by U. B. Thomas and W. E. Haring at Bell Labs in the 1930s and eventually led to the development of lead–calcium grid alloys in 1935 for standby power batteries on the U.S. telephone network. Related research led to the development of lead–selenium grid alloys in Europe a few years later. Both lead–calcium and lead–selenium grid alloys still add antimony, albeit in much smaller quantities than the older high-antimony grids: lead–calcium grids have 4–6% antimony while lead–selenium grids have 1–2%. These metallurgical improvements give the grid more strength, which allows it to carry more weight, and therefore more active material, and so the plates can be thicker, which in turn contributes to battery lifespan since there is more material available to shed before the battery becomes unusable. High-antimony alloy grids are still used in batteries intended for frequent cycling, e.g. in motor-starting applications where frequent expansion/contraction of the plates need to be compensated for, but where outgassing is not significant since charge currents remain low. Since the 1950s, batteries designed for infrequent cycling applications (e.g., standby power batteries) increasingly have lead–calcium or lead–selenium alloy grids since these have less hydrogen evolution and thus lower maintenance overhead. Lead–calcium alloy grids are cheaper to manufacture (the cells thus have lower up-front costs), and have a lower self-discharge rate, and lower watering requirements, but have slightly poorer conductivity, are mechanically weaker (and thus require more antimony to compensate), and are more strongly subject to corrosion (and thus a shorter lifespan) than cells with lead–selenium alloy grids.

The open-circuit effect is a dramatic loss of battery cycle life, which was observed when calcium was substituted for antimony. It is also known as the antimony free effect.

=== Modern approach ===
Modern-day paste contains carbon black, &quot;blanc fixe&quot; (barium sulfate), and lignosulfonate. The blanc fixe acts as a seed crystal for the lead–to–lead-sulfate reaction. The blanc fixe must be fully dispersed in the paste in order for it to be effective. The lignosulfonate prevents the negative plate from forming a solid mass during the discharge cycle, instead enabling the formation of long needle–like dendrites. The long crystals have more surface area and are easily converted back to the original state on charging. Carbon black counteracts the effect of inhibiting formation caused by the lignosulfonates. Sulfonated naphthalene condensate dispersant is a more effective expander than lignosulfonate and speeds up formation. This dispersant improves the dispersion of barium sulfate in the paste, reduces hydroset time, produces a more breakage-resistant plate, reduces fine lead particles, and thereby improves handling and pasting characteristics. It extends battery life by increasing end-of-charge voltage. Sulfonated naphthalene requires about one-third to one-half the amount of lignosulfonate and is stable to higher temperatures.

Once dry, the plates are stacked with suitable separators and inserted in a cell container. The alternate plates then constitute alternating positive and negative electrodes, and within the cell are later connected to one another (negative to negative, positive to positive) in parallel. The separators inhibit the plates from touching each other, which would otherwise constitute a short circuit. In flooded and gel cells, the separators are insulating rails or studs, formerly of glass or ceramic, and now of plastic. In AGM cells, the separator is the glass mat itself, and the rack of plates with separators are squeezed together before insertion into the cell; once in the cell, the glass mats expand slightly, effectively locking the plates in place. In multi-cell batteries, the cells are then connected to one another in series, either through connectors through the cell walls, or by a bridge over the cell walls. All intra-cell and inter-cell connections are of the same lead alloy as that used in the grids. This is necessary to prevent galvanic corrosion.

Deep-cycle batteries have a different geometry for their positive electrodes. The positive electrode is not a flat plate but a row of lead–oxide cylinders or tubes strung side by side, so their geometry is called &quot;tubular&quot; or &quot;cylindrical&quot;. The advantage of this is an increased surface area in contact with the electrolyte, with higher discharge and charge currents than a flat-plate cell of the same volume and depth-of-charge. Tubular-electrode cells have a higher power density than flat-plate cells. This makes cylindrical-geometry plates especially suitable for high-current applications with weight or space limitations, such as for forklifts or for starting marine diesel engines. However, because cylinders have less active material in the same volume, they also have lower energy densities than otherwise comparable flat-plate cells, and less active material at the electrode also means they have less material available to shed before the cells become unusable. Cylindrical electrodes are also more complicated to manufacture uniformly, which tends to make them more expensive than flat-plate cells. These trade-offs limit the range of applications in which cylindrical batteries are meaningful to situations where there is insufficient space to install higher-capacity (and thus larger) flat-plate units.

About 60% of the weight of an automotive-type lead–acid battery rated around 60 A·h is lead or internal parts made of lead; the balance is electrolyte, separators, and the case. For example, there are approximately of lead in a typical battery.

===Separators===
Separators between the positive and negative plates prevent short circuits through physical contact, mostly through dendrites (&quot;treeing&quot;), but also through shedding of the active material. Separators allow the flow of ions between the plates of an electrochemical cell to form a closed circuit. Wood, rubber, glass fiber mat, cellulose, and PVC or polyethylene plastic have been used to make separators. Wood was the original choice, but it deteriorates in the acid electrolyte.

An effective separator must possess a number of mechanical properties, including permeability, porosity, pore size distribution, specific surface area, mechanical design and strength, electrical resistance, ionic conductivity, and chemical compatibility with the electrolyte. In service, the separator must have good resistance to acid and oxidation. The area of the separator must be a little larger than the area of the plates to prevent material shorting between the plates. The separators must remain stable over the battery&#x27;s operating temperature range.

===Absorbent glass mat===
In the &quot;absorbent glass mat&quot; (&quot;AGM&quot;) design, the separators between the plates are replaced by a glass fibre mat soaked in electrolyte. There is only enough electrolyte in the mat to keep it wet, and if the battery is punctured, the electrolyte will not flow out of the mats. The principal purpose of replacing liquid electrolyte in a flooded battery with a semi-saturated fiberglass mat is to substantially increase the gas transport through the separator; hydrogen or oxygen gas produced during overcharge or charge (if the charge current is excessive) is able to freely pass through the glass mat and reduce or oxidize the opposing plate, respectively. In a flooded cell, the bubbles of gas float to the top of the battery and are lost to the atmosphere. This mechanism for the gas produced to recombine and the additional benefit of a semi-saturated cell providing no substantial leakage of electrolyte upon physical puncture of the battery case allows the battery to be completely sealed, which makes them useful in portable devices and similar roles. Additionally, the battery can be installed in any orientation, though if it is installed upside down, then acid may be blown out through the overpressure vent.

To reduce the water loss rate, calcium is alloyed with the plates; however, gas build-up remains a problem when the battery is deeply or rapidly charged or discharged. To prevent over-pressurization of the battery casing, AGM batteries include a one-way blow-off valve, and are often known as &quot;valve-regulated lead–acid&quot; (&quot;VRLA&quot;) designs.

Another advantage to the AGM design is that the electrolyte becomes the separator material and is mechanically strong. This allows the plate stack to be compressed together in the battery shell, slightly increasing energy density compared to liquid or gel versions. AGM batteries often show a characteristic bulging in their shells when built in common rectangular shapes, due to the expansion of the positive plates.

The mat also prevents the vertical motion of the electrolyte within the battery. When a normal wet cell is stored in a discharged state, the heavier acid molecules tend to settle to the bottom of the battery, causing the electrolyte to stratify. When the battery is then used, the majority of the current flows only in this area, and the bottom of the plates tends to wear out rapidly. This is one of the reasons a conventional car battery can be ruined by leaving it stored for a long period and then used and recharged. The mat significantly prevents this stratification, eliminating the need to periodically shake the batteries, boil them, or run an &quot;equalization charge&quot; through them to mix the electrolyte. Stratification also causes the upper layers of the battery to become almost completely water, which can freeze in cold weather; AGMs are significantly less susceptible to damage due to low-temperature use.

While AGM cells do not permit watering (typically it is impossible to add water without drilling a hole in the battery), their recombination process is fundamentally limited by the usual chemical processes. Hydrogen gas will even diffuse right through the plastic case itself. Some have found that it is profitable to add water to an AGM battery, but this must be done slowly to allow for the water to mix throughout the battery via diffusion. When a lead–acid battery loses water, its acid concentration increases, increasing the corrosion rate of the plates significantly. AGM cells already have a high acid content in an attempt to lower the water loss rate and increase standby voltage, and this brings about shorter life compared to a lead–antimony flooded battery. If the open circuit voltage of AGM cells is significantly higher than 2.093 volts, or 12.56 V for a 12 V battery, then it has a higher acid content than a flooded cell; while this is normal for an AGM battery, it is not desirable for long life.

AGM cells that are intentionally or accidentally overcharged will show a higher open-circuit voltage according to the water lost (and acid concentration increased). One amp-hour of overcharge will electrolyse 0.335 grams of water per cell; some of this liberated hydrogen and oxygen will recombine, but not all of it.

===Gelled electrolytes===
During the 1970s, researchers developed the sealed version or gel battery, which mixes a silica gelling agent into the electrolyte (silica-gel-based lead–acid batteries used in portable radios from the early 1930s were not fully sealed). This converts the formerly liquid interior of the cells into a semi-stiff paste, providing many of the same advantages of the AGM. Such designs are even less susceptible to evaporation and are often used in situations where little or no periodic maintenance is possible. Gel cells also have lower freezing and higher boiling points than the liquid electrolytes used in conventional wet cells and AGMs, which makes them suitable for use in extreme conditions.

The only downside to the gel design is that the gel prevents rapid motion of the ions in the electrolyte, which reduces carrier mobility and thus surge current capability. For this reason, gel cells are most commonly found in energy storage applications like off-grid systems.

===&quot;Maintenance-free&quot;, &quot;sealed&quot;, and &quot;valve-regulated lead–acid&quot; (&quot;VRLA&quot;)===
Both gel and AGM designs are sealed, do not require watering, can be used in any orientation, and use a valve for gas blowoff. For this reason, both designs can be called maintenance-free, sealed, and VRLA. However, it is quite common to find resources stating that these terms refer to one or another of these designs, specifically.

In a valve-regulated lead–acid (VRLA) battery, the hydrogen and oxygen produced in the cells largely recombine into water. Leakage is minimal, although some electrolyte still escapes if the recombination cannot keep up with gas evolution. Since VRLA batteries do not require (and make impossible) regular checking of the electrolyte level, they have been called &quot;maintenance-free batteries&quot;. However, this is somewhat of a misnomer: VRLA cells do require maintenance. As electrolyte is lost, VRLA cells dry out and lose capacity. This can be detected by taking regular internal resistance, conductance, or impedance measurements. Regular testing reveals whether more involved testing and maintenance is required. Maintenance procedures have recently been developed allowing rehydration, often restoring significant amounts of lost capacity.

VRLA types became popular on motorcycles around 1983, because the separator improves resistance to vibration and prevents the acid electrolyte from spilling. They are also popular in stationary applications such as telecommunications sites, due to their small footprint and installation flexibility.

==Applications==
Most of the world&#x27;s lead–acid batteries are automobile starting, lighting, and ignition (SLI) batteries, with an estimated 320 million units shipped in 1999. In 1992 about 3 million tons of lead were used in the manufacture of batteries.

Wet cell stand-by (stationary) batteries designed for deep discharge are commonly used in large backup power supplies for telephone and computer centres, grid energy storage, and off-grid household electric power systems. Lead–acid batteries are used in emergency lighting and to power sump pumps in case of power failure.

Traction (propulsion) batteries are used in golf carts and other battery electric vehicles. Large lead–acid batteries are also used to power the electric motors in diesel–electric (conventional) submarines when submerged, and are used as emergency power on nuclear submarines as well. Valve-regulated lead–acid batteries cannot spill their electrolyte. They are used in back-up power supplies for alarm and smaller computer systems (particularly in uninterruptible power supplies) and for electric scooters, electric wheelchairs, electrified bicycles, marine applications, battery electric vehicles or micro hybrid vehicles, and motorcycles. Many electric forklifts use lead–acid batteries, where the weight is used as part of a counterweight. Lead–acid batteries were used to supply the filament (heater) voltage, with 2 V common in early vacuum tube (valve) radio receivers.

Portable batteries for miners&#x27; cap headlamps typically have two or three cells.

==Cycles==

===Starting batteries===
Lead–acid batteries designed for starting automotive engines are not designed for deep discharge. They have a large number of thin plates designed for maximum surface area, and therefore maximum current output, which can easily be damaged by deep discharge. Repeated deep discharges will result in capacity loss and ultimately in premature failure, as the electrodes disintegrate due to mechanical stresses that arise from cycling. 

Starting batteries kept on a continuous float charge will suffer corrosion of the electrodes which will also result in premature failure. Starting batteries should therefore be kept open circuit but charged regularly (at least once every two weeks) to prevent sulfation.

Starting batteries are lighter than deep-cycle batteries of the same size, because the thinner and lighter cell plates do not extend all the way to the bottom of the battery case. This allows loose, disintegrated material to fall off the plates and collect at the bottom of the cell, prolonging the service life of the battery. If this loose debris rises enough, then it may touch the bottom of the plates and cause failure of a cell, resulting in loss of battery voltage and capacity.

===Deep-cycle batteries===
Specially-designed deep-cycle cells are much less susceptible to degradation due to cycling, and are required for applications where the batteries are regularly discharged, such as photovoltaic systems, electric vehicles (forklift, golf cart, electric cars, and others), and uninterruptible power supplies. These batteries have thicker plates that cannot deliver as much &quot;peak current&quot; but can withstand frequent discharging.

Some batteries are designed as a compromise between starter (high-current) and deep cycle. They are able to be discharged to a greater degree than automotive batteries, but less so than deep-cycle batteries. They may be referred to as &quot;marine&quot;, &quot;motorhome&quot;, or &quot;leisure batteries&quot;.

===Fast and slow charge and discharge===
The capacity of a lead–acid battery is not a fixed quantity but varies according to how quickly it is discharged. The empirical relationship between discharge rate and capacity is known as Peukert&#x27;s law.

When a battery is charged or discharged, only the reacting chemicals, which are at the interface between the electrodes and the electrolyte, are initially affected. With time, the charge stored in the chemicals at the interface, often called &quot;interface charge&quot; or &quot;surface charge&quot;, spreads by diffusion of these chemicals throughout the volume of the active material.

Consider a battery that has been completely discharged (such as occurs when leaving the car lights on overnight, a current draw of about 6 amps). If it then is given a fast charge for only a few minutes, the battery plates charge only near the interface between the plates and the electrolyte. In this case the battery voltage might rise to a value near that of the charger voltage; this causes the charging current to decrease significantly. After a few hours this interface charge will spread to the volume of the electrode and electrolyte; this leads to an interface charge so low that it may be insufficient to start the car. As long as the charging voltage stays below the gassing voltage (about 14.4 volts in a normal lead–acid battery), battery damage is unlikely, and in time the battery should return to a nominally charged state.

==Sulfation and desulfation==

Lead–acid batteries lose the ability to accept a charge when discharged for too long due to &quot;sulfation&quot;, the crystallization of lead sulfate. They generate electricity through a double sulfate chemical reaction. Lead and lead dioxide, the active materials on the battery&#x27;s plates, react with sulfuric acid in the electrolyte to form lead sulfate. The lead sulfate first forms in a finely divided, amorphous state and easily reverts to lead, lead dioxide, and sulfuric acid when the battery recharges. As batteries cycle through numerous discharges and charges, some lead sulfate does not recombine into electrolyte and slowly converts into a stable crystalline form that no longer dissolves on recharging. Thus, not all the lead is returned to the battery plates, and the amount of usable active material necessary for electricity generation declines over time.

Sulfation occurs in lead–acid batteries when they are subjected to insufficient charging during normal operation, it also occurs when lead–acid batteries left unused with incomplete charge for an extended time. It impedes recharging; sulfate deposits ultimately expand, cracking the plates and destroying the battery. Eventually, so much of the battery plate area is unable to supply current that the battery capacity is greatly reduced. In addition, the sulfate portion (of the lead sulfate) is not returned to the electrolyte as sulfuric acid. It is believed that large crystals physically block the electrolyte from entering the pores of the plates. A white coating on the plates may be visible in batteries with clear cases or after dismantling the battery. Batteries that are sulfated show a high internal resistance and can deliver only a small fraction of normal discharge current. Sulfation also affects the charging cycle, resulting in longer charging times, less-efficient and incomplete charging, and higher battery temperatures.

SLI batteries (starting, lighting, ignition; e.g., car batteries) suffer the most deterioration because vehicles normally stand unused for relatively long periods of time. Deep-cycle and motive power batteries are subjected to regular controlled overcharging, eventually failing due to corrosion of the positive plate grids rather than sulfation.

Sulfation can be avoided if the battery is fully recharged immediately after a discharge cycle. There are no known independently-verified ways to reverse sulfation. There are commercial products claiming to achieve desulfation through various techniques such as pulse charging, but there are no peer-reviewed publications verifying their claims. Sulfation prevention remains the best course of action, by periodically fully charging the lead–acid batteries.

==Stratification==
A typical lead–acid battery contains a mixture with varying concentrations of water and acid. Sulfuric acid has a higher density than water, which causes the acid formed at the plates during charging to flow downward and collect at the bottom of the battery. Eventually the mixture will again reach uniform composition by diffusion, but this is a very slow process. Repeated cycles of partial charging and discharging will increase stratification of the electrolyte, reducing the capacity and performance of the battery because the lack of acid on top limits plate activation. The stratification also promotes corrosion on the upper half of the plates and sulfation at the bottom.

Periodic overcharging creates gaseous reaction products at the plate, causing convection currents which mix the electrolyte and resolve the stratification. Mechanical stirring of the electrolyte would have the same effect. Batteries in moving vehicles are also subject to sloshing and splashing in the cells, as the vehicle accelerates, brakes, and turns.

==Safety==
Excessive charging causes electrolysis, emitting hydrogen and oxygen in a process known as &quot;gassing&quot;. Wet cells have open vents to release any gas produced, and VRLA batteries rely on valves fitted to each cell. Catalytic caps are available for flooded cells to recombine hydrogen and oxygen. A VRLA cell normally recombines any hydrogen and oxygen produced inside the cell, but malfunction or overheating may cause gas to build up. If this happens (for example, on overcharging), then the valve vents the gas and normalizes the pressure, producing a characteristic acidic smell. However, valves can fail, such as if dirt and debris accumulate, allowing pressure to build up.

Accumulated hydrogen and oxygen sometimes ignite in an internal explosion. The force of the explosion can cause the battery&#x27;s casing to burst, or cause its top to fly off, spraying acid and casing fragments. An explosion in one cell may ignite any combustible gas mixture in the remaining cells. Similarly, in a poorly ventilated area, connecting or disconnecting a closed circuit (such as a load or a charger) to the battery terminals can also cause sparks and an explosion, if any gas was vented from the cells.

Individual cells within a battery can also short circuit, causing an explosion.

The cells of VRLA batteries typically swell when the internal pressure rises, thereby giving a warning to users and mechanics. The deformation varies from cell to cell, and is greatest at the ends where the walls are unsupported by other cells. Such over-pressurized batteries should be carefully isolated and discarded. Personnel working near batteries at risk of explosion should protect their eyes and exposed skin from burns due to spraying acid and fire by wearing a face shield, overalls, and gloves. Using goggles instead of a face shield leaves the face exposed to possible flying acid, case or battery fragments, and heat from a potential explosion.

==Environment==

===Environmental concerns===
According to a 2003 report entitled &quot;Getting the Lead Out&quot;, by Environmental Defense and the Ecology Center of Ann Arbor, Michigan, the batteries of vehicles on the road contained an estimated of lead. Some lead compounds are extremely toxic. Long-term exposure to even tiny amounts of these compounds can cause brain and kidney damage, hearing impairment, and learning problems in children. The auto industry uses over of lead every year, with 90% going to conventional lead–acid vehicle batteries. While lead recycling is a well-established industry, more than ends up in landfills every year. According to the federal Toxic Release Inventory, another are released in the lead mining and manufacturing process.

Attempts are being made to develop alternatives (particularly for automotive use) because of concerns about the environmental consequences of improper disposal and of lead smelting operations, among other reasons. Alternatives are unlikely to displace them for applications such as engine starting or backup power systems, since the batteries, although heavy, are inexpensive in up-front cost.

===Recycling===

According to the Battery Council, an industry group, lead–acid battery recycling is one of the most successful recycling programs in the world. In the United States 99% of all battery lead was recycled between 2014 and 2018. However, documents of the U.S. Environmental Protection Administration, since 1982, have indicated rates varying between 60% and 95%.

Lead is highly toxic to humans, and recycling it can result in pollution and contamination of people, resulting in numerous and lasting health problems. One ranking identifies lead–acid battery recycling as the world&#x27;s most deadly industrial process, in terms of disability-adjusted life years lost—resulting in 2,000,000 to 4,800,000 estimated years of individual human life lost, globally.

Lead–acid battery-recycling sites have themselves become a source of lead pollution, and by 1992, the EPA had selected 29 such sites for its Superfund clean-up, with 22 on its National Priority List.

An effective pollution control system is a necessity to prevent lead emission. Continuous improvement in battery recycling plants and furnace designs is required to keep pace with emission standards for lead smelters.

==Additives==
Chemical additives have been used ever since the lead–acid battery became a commercial item, to reduce lead sulfate buildup on plates and improve battery condition when added to the electrolyte of a vented lead–acid battery. Such treatments are rarely, if ever, effective.

Two compounds used for such purposes are Epsom salts and EDTA. Epsom salts reduce the internal resistance in a weak or damaged battery and may allow a small amount of extended life. EDTA can be used to dissolve the sulfate deposits of heavily discharged plates. However, the dissolved material is then no longer available to participate in the normal charge-discharge cycle, so a battery temporarily revived with EDTA will have a reduced life expectancy. Residual EDTA in the lead–acid cell forms organic acids which will accelerate corrosion of the lead plates and internal connectors.

The active materials change physical form during charge/discharge, resulting in growth and distortion of the electrodes, and shedding of electrodes into the electrolyte. Once the active material has fallen out of the plates, it cannot be restored into position by any chemical treatment. Similarly, internal physical problems such as cracked plates, corroded connectors, or damaged separators cannot be restored chemically.

==Corrosion problems==
Corrosion of the external metal parts of the lead–acid battery results from a chemical reaction of the battery terminals, plugs, and connectors.

Corrosion on the positive terminal is caused by electrolysis, due to a mismatch of metal alloys used in the manufacture of the battery terminal and cable connector. White corrosion is usually lead or zinc sulfate crystals. Aluminum connectors corrode to aluminum sulfate. Copper connectors produce blue and white corrosion crystals. Corrosion of a battery&#x27;s terminals can be reduced by coating the terminals with petroleum jelly or a commercially available product made for the purpose.

If the battery is overfilled with water and electrolyte, then thermal expansion can force some of the liquid out of the battery vents onto the top of the battery. This solution can then react with the lead and other metals in the battery connector and cause corrosion.

The electrolyte can seep from the plastic-to-lead seal where the battery terminals penetrate the plastic case.

Acid fumes that vaporize through the vent caps, often caused by overcharging, and insufficient battery box ventilation can allow the sulfuric acid fumes to build up and react with the exposed metals.

<text>Social status is the relative level of social value a person is considered to possess. Such social value includes respect, honor, assumed competence, and deference. On one hand, social scientists view status as a &quot;reward&quot; for group members who treat others well and take initiative. This is one explanation for its apparent cross-cultural universality. On the other hand, while people with higher status experience a litany of benefits—such as greater health, admiration, resources, influence, and freedom—those with lower status experience poorer outcomes across all of those metrics. 

Importantly, status is based in widely shared &quot;beliefs&quot; about who members of a society judge as more competent or moral. While such beliefs can stem from an impressive performance or success, they can also arise from possessing characteristics a society has deemed meaningful like a person&#x27;s race or occupation. In this way, status reflects how a society judges a person&#x27;s relative social worth and merit—however accurate or inaccurate that judgement may be. Because societies use status to allocate resources, leadership positions, and other forms of power, status can make unequal distributions of resources and power appear natural and fair, supporting systems of social stratification. 

== Definition ==
The sociologist Max Weber outlined three central aspects of stratification in a society: class, status, and power. In his scheme, which remains influential today, people possess status in the sense of honor because they belong to specific groups with unique lifestyles and privileges. Modern sociologists and social psychologists broadened this understanding of status to refer to one&#x27;s relative level of respectability and honor more generally.

Some writers have also referred to a socially valued role or category a person occupies as a &quot;status&quot; (e.g., gender, social class, ethnicity, having a criminal conviction, having a mental illness, etc.). As social network analysts, Stanley Wasserman and Katherine Faust Stanley cautioned &quot;there is considerable disagreement among social scientists about the definitions of the related concepts of social position, social status, and social role.&quot; They note that while many scholars differentiate those terms, they can define those terms in a way that clashes with the definitions of another scholar; for example they state that &quot;[Ralph] Linton uses the term &#x27;status&#x27; in a way that is identical to our use of the term &quot;position&quot;.

==Determination==

Status hierarchies depend primarily on the possession and use of status symbols. These are cues or characteristics that people in a society agree indicate how much status a person holds and how they should be treated. Such symbols can include the possession of valued attributes, like being beautiful or having a prestigious degree. Other status symbols include wealth and its display through conspicuous consumption. Status in face-to-face interaction can also be conveyed through certain controllable behaviors, such as assertive speech, posture, and emotional displays. Social network analysts have also shown that one&#x27;s affiliations can also be a source of status. Several studies document that being popular or demonstrating dominance over peers increases a person&#x27;s status. Analyses of private companies also find that organizations can gain status from having well-respected corporate partners or investors.

Because status is always relative to others, a person may enter many situations throughout their life or even a single day in which they hold high, equal, or low status depending on who is around them. For instance, a doctor holds high status when interacting with a patient, equal status in a meeting with fellow doctors, and low status when meeting with their hospital&#x27;s chief of medicine. A person can also be a &#x27;big fish in a small pond&#x27; such that they have higher status than everyone else in their organization, but low or equal status relative to professionals in their entire field.

Some perspectives on status emphasize its relatively fixed and fluid aspects. Ascribed statuses are fixed for an individual at birth, while achieved status is determined by social rewards an individual acquires during his or her lifetime as a result of the exercise of ability and/or perseverance. Examples of ascribed status include castes, race, and beauty among others. Meanwhile, achieved statuses are akin to one&#x27;s educational credentials or occupation: these things require a person to exercise effort and often undergo years of training. The term master status has been used to describe the status most important for determining a person&#x27;s position in a given context, like possessing a mental illness.

However, the concept of a master status is controversial. Status characteristics theory argues members of a task group will listen to whomever they believe will most help them solve a problem. One&#x27;s external status in society (e.g., race or gender) determines influence in small groups, but so does a person&#x27;s known ability on the task (e.g., mechanical ability when a car breaks down). This implies that known ability would attenuate the effect of external status, implying a given external status characteristic is not a master status. The program of research finds characteristics assumed to be master statuses (e.g., mental illness) are, in fact, attenuated by known ability. Moreover, status affects group members&#x27; assertiveness only when characteristics differentiate group members (i.e., groups are mixed-race or mixed-gender). With respect to gender, experimental tests repeatedly found that women are highly deferential only in the presence of men. Although for disadvantaged groups, status disadvantage is not completely negated by valued characteristics, their social status does not depend predominantly on any one group membership. As such, status characteristics research has yet to identify a social characteristic that operates like a robust cross-situational master status.

== Uses of status ==
Although a person&#x27;s status does not always correspond to merit or actual ability, it does allow the members of a group to coordinate their actions and quickly agree on who among them should be listened to. When actual ability does correspond to status, then status hierarchies can be especially useful. They allow leaders to emerge who set informed precedents and influence less knowledgeable group members, allowing groups to use the shared information of their group to make more correct decisions. This can be especially helpful in novel situations where group members must determine who is best equipped to complete a task.

In addition, groups accord more respect and esteem to members who help them succeed, which encourages highly capable members to contribute in the first place. This helps groups motivate members to contribute to a collective good by offering respect and esteem as a kind of compensation for helping everyone in the group succeed. For instance, people recognized as achieving great feats for their group or society are sometimes accorded legendary status as heroes.

Finally—for good or ill—status maintains social inequality. Because status is based on beliefs about social worth and esteem, sociologists argue it can then appear only natural that higher-status people have more material resources and power. Status makes it appear that a person&#x27;s rank or position in society is due to their relative merit, and therefore deserved. For instance, if a society holds that the homeless are unworthy of respect or dignity, then their poor material conditions are not evaluated as unjust by members of that society, and therefore are not subject to change.

== In different societies ==
Whether formal or informal, status hierarchies are present in all societies. In a society, the relative honor and prestige accorded to individuals depends on how well an individual is perceived to match a society&#x27;s values and ideals (e.g., being pious in a religious society or wealthy in a capitalist society). Status often comes with attendant rights, duties, and lifestyle practices.

In modern societies, occupation is usually thought of as the main determinant of status, but other memberships or affiliations (such as ethnic group, religion, gender, voluntary associations, fandom, hobby) can have an influence. Achieved status, when people are placed in the stratification structure based on their individual merits or achievements like education or training, is thought to be reflective of modern developed societies. Consequently, achieved status implies that social mobility in a society is possible, as opposed to caste systems characterized by immobility based solely on ascribed status.

In pre-modern societies, status differentiation is widely varied. In some cases it can be quite rigid, such as with the Indian caste system. In other cases, status exists without class and/or informally, as is true with some Hunter-Gatherer societies such as the Khoisan, and some Indigenous Australian societies. In these cases, status is limited to specific personal relationships. For example, a Khoisan man is expected to take his wife&#x27;s mother quite seriously (a non-joking relationship), although the mother-in-law has no special &quot;status&quot; over anyone except her son-in-law—and only then in specific contexts.

Status maintains and stabilizes social stratification. Mere inequality in resources and privileges is perceived as unfair and thus prompts retaliation and resistance from those of lower status, but if some individuals are seen as better than others (i.e., have higher status), then it seems natural and fair that high-status people receive more resources and privileges. Historically, Max Weber distinguished status from social class, though some contemporary empirical sociologists combine the two ideas to create socioeconomic status or SES, usually operationalized as a simple index of income, education and occupational prestige.

== In nonhuman animals ==
Social status hierarchies have been documented in a wide range of animals: apes, baboons, wolves, cows/bulls, hens, even fish, and ants. Natural selection produces status-seeking behavior because animals tend to have more surviving offspring when they raise their status in their social group. Such behaviors vary widely because they are adaptations to a wide range of environmental niches. Some social dominance behaviors tend to increase reproductive opportunity, while others tend to raise the survival rates of an individual&#x27;s offspring. Neurochemicals, particularly serotonin, prompt social dominance behaviors without need for an organism to have abstract conceptualizations of status as a means to an end. Social dominance hierarchy emerges from individual survival-seeking behaviors.

== Status inconsistency ==

Status inconsistency is a situation where an individual&#x27;s social positions have both positive and negative influences on his or her social status. For example, a teacher may have a positive societal image (respect, prestige) which increases their status but may earn little money, which simultaneously decreases their status. In task-focused interpersonal encounters, people unconsciously combine this information to develop impressions of their own and others&#x27; relative rank. At one time, researchers thought status inconsistency would be a source of stress, though evidence for this hypothesis proved inconsistent, leaving some to conclude conflicting expectations through occupying incompatible roles may be the true stressor.

== Social stratification ==

Status is one of the major components of social stratification, the way people are hierarchically placed in a society. The members of a group with similar status interact mainly within their own group and to a lesser degree with those of higher or lower status in a recognized system of social stratification. Although the determinants of status are specific to different cultures, some of the more common bases for status-based stratification include:
* Wealth/Income
* Gender
* Race/Ethnicity
* Social class
* Occupation
* Popularity (also called sociometric status)

== Max Weber&#x27;s three dimensions of stratification ==

The German sociologist Max Weber argued stratification is based on three factors: property, status, and power. He claimed that social stratification is a result of the interaction of wealth (class), prestige status (or in German &quot;Stand&quot;) and power (party).
* Property refers to one&#x27;s material possessions. If someone has control of property, that person has power over others and can use the property to his or her own benefit.
* Status refers to a person&#x27;s relative level of respectability and social honor. Weber&#x27;s interest was particularly in status groups, which have distinct cultural dispositions and privileges, and whose members mostly socialize with one another.
* Power is the ability to do what one wants, regardless of the will of others. (Domination, a closely related concept, is the power to make others&#x27; behavior conform to one&#x27;s commands).
=== Status group ===

Max Weber developed the idea of &quot;status group&quot; which is a translation of the German &quot;Stand&quot; (pl. &quot;Stände&quot;). Status groups are communities that are based on ideas of lifestyles and the honor the status group both asserts, and is given by others. Status groups exist in the context of beliefs about relative prestige, privilege, and honor. People in status groups are only supposed to engage with people of like status, and in particular, marriage inside or outside the group is discouraged. Status groups in some societies include professions, club-like organizations, ethnicity, race, and any other socially (de)valued group that organizes interaction among relative equals.

<text>William Wetmore (September 16, 1771 – October 27, 1827) founded Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio in 1812.

==Early life==
Wetmore was born in Middletown, Connecticut and was hired by Joshua Stow as a land agent of property in the Western Reserve which was purchased by the Connecticut Land Company. Wetmore moved to Ohio in 1804 and became one of the original proprietors of Cuyahoga Falls.

==Career==
He built the second house in what became Stow Township. Wetmore was elected Justice of the Peace of Stow, as well as Clerk of the Court of Ravenna, Ohio.

During the War of 1812, William Wetmore was appointed commander for troops stationed at Old Portage. (This was the northern Portage Path, at the Cuyahoga River.) Acting as an agent for Joshua Stow, owner of the township, William also gave permission to Francis Kelsey and Isaac Wilcox to build a dam across the Cuyahoga River and to erect a sawmill. It is said lumber from this mill was used by the army to build ships at Portage for use against the British. (The dam washed away long after this.)

Wetmore and Joshua Stow owned , the southern border being Portage Trail, and began developing Cuyahoga Falls in 1825. Wetmore&#x27;s sons, William Jr. and Henry, supervised 30 men who constructed a dam, gristmill, sawmill, paper and linseed oil mills.

On the occasion of Edwin Wetmore&#x27;s 21st birthday (1823), parents William and Anne gave him a plot of land in the Village of Silver Lake, along an upscale suburban street, Kent Road, then it was the farm that helped sustain his family and in 1820, Edwin had already built a 2-story Connecticut style farmhouse on this property. The house, with modifications, stands on and is occupied today.

William Wetmore built his home at the corner of Front Street and Portage Trail. A short time later it became a hotel known as the &quot;Perry House&quot; and &quot;Clifford Inn.&quot;

In 1830, St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church was organized by William Wetmore. They met in a schoolhouse at Front and Wadsworth Streets. Shortly thereafter, construction was started at its present site on Portage Trail and Second Street.

In the twentieth century, the Wetmore farm was subdivided into a neighborhood known as Paradise Park. This tree-lined neighborhood stretches from the Wetmore house present site of the Stow-Munroe Falls Public Library, and runs several blocks. Today, Wetmore Park and Wetmore Street (located by Holy Family Church) serve as reminders of Stow&#x27;s first settle family.

==Personal life==
Wetmore died on October 27, 1827, aged 56, in Ohio and is interred in Stow Cemetery.

===Legacy===
The William Wetmore house was located on Darrow and Kent Road, lots 25,35, 36. Edwin Wetmore&#x27;s home is located on Kent Rd and still occupied today.

<doc id="201510" wikidata="Q1945033" url="?curid=201510" title="Monocular">
<text>A monocular is a compact refracting telescope used to magnify images of distant objects, typically using an optical prism to ensure an erect image, instead of using relay lenses like most telescopic sights. The volume and weight of a monocular are typically less than half of a pair of binoculars with similar optical properties, making it more portable and also less expensive. This is because binoculars are essentially a pair of monoculars packed together — one for each eye. As a result, monoculars only produce two-dimensional images, while binoculars can use two parallaxed images (each for one eye) to produce binocular vision, which allows stereopsis and depth perception.

Monoculars are ideally suited to those applications where three-dimensional perception is not needed, or where compactness and low weight are important (e.g. hiking). Monoculars are also sometimes preferred where difficulties occur using both eyes through binoculars due to significant eyesight variation (e.g. strabismus, anisometropia or astigmatism) or unilateral visual impairment (due to amblyopia, cataract or corneal ulceration).

Conventional refracting telescopes that use relay lenses have a straight optical path that is relatively long; as a result, monoculars normally use Porro or roof prisms to &quot;fold up&quot; the optical path, which makes it much shorter and compact (see the entry on binoculars for details). However, monoculars also tend to have lower magnification factors than telescopes of the same objective size, and typically lack the capacity of variable magnification.

Visually impaired people may use monoculars to see objects at distances at which people with normal vision do not have difficulty, e.g., to read text on a chalkboard or projection screen. Applications for viewing more distant objects include natural history, hunting, marine and military. Compact monoculars are also used in art galleries and museums to obtain a closer view of exhibits.

When high magnification, a bright image, and good resolution of distant images are required, a relatively larger instrument is preferred (i.e. a telescope), often mounted on a tripod. A smaller pocket-sized &quot;pocket scope&quot; (i.e. a typical monocular) can be used for less stringent applications. These comments are quantified below.

Whereas there is a huge range of binoculars on the world market, monoculars are less widely available and with a limited choice in the top quality bracket, with some traditionally very high quality optical manufacturers not offering monoculars at all. Today, most monoculars are manufactured in Japan, China, Russia and Germany, with China offering more product variety than most. Prices range widely, from the highest specification designs listed at over £300 down to &quot;budget&quot; offerings at under £10. (As at February 2016).

==Monocular sizes==
As with binoculars and telescopes, monoculars are primarily defined by two parameters: magnification and objective lens diameter, for example, 8×30 where 8 is the magnification and 30 is the objective lens diameter in mm (this is the lens furthest from the eye). An 8× magnification makes the distant object appear to be 8 times larger at the eye. Contemporary monoculars are typically compact and most normally within a range of 4× magnification to 10×, although specialized units outside these limits are available. Variable magnification or zoom is sometimes provided, but has drawbacks and is not normally found on the top quality monoculars. The objective lens diameter is typically in the range 20mm to 42mm. Care is needed in interpreting some monocular specifications where numerical values are applied loosely and inaccurately—e.g. &quot;39×95&quot;, which on a small cheap monocular is more likely to refer to the physical dimensions than the optical parameters. (This is covered in more detail in the section &quot;Interpreting product specifications&quot; below.)

As with binoculars, possibly the most common and popular magnification for most purposes is 8×. This represents a usable magnification in many circumstances and is reasonably easy to hold steady without a tripod or monopod. At this magnification, the field of view is relatively wide, making it easier to locate and follow distant objects. For viewing at longer distances, 10× or 12× is preferable if the user is able to hold the monocular steady. However, increasing magnification will compromise the field of view and the relative brightness of the object. These and other considerations are major factors influencing the choice of magnification and objective lens diameter. Although very high numerical magnification sounds impressive on paper, in reality, for a pocket monocular it is rarely a good choice because of the very narrow field of view, poor image brightness, and great difficulty in keeping the image still when hand holding. Most serious users will eventually come to realize why 8× or 10× are so popular, as they represent possibly the best compromise and are the magnifications most commonly adopted in the very highest quality field monoculars (and binoculars).

Where a monocular end and a telescope start is debatable but a telescope is normally used for high magnifications (&gt;20×) and with correspondingly larger objective lens diameter (e.g. 60–90mm). A telescope will be significantly heavier, more bulky, and much more expensive, than a monocular and, due to the high magnifications, will normally need a tripod, reflecting telescopes used for astronomy, typically, have inverted images. Most popular monocular sizes mimic popular binoculars – e.g. 7×25, 8×20, 8×30, 8×42, 10×42.

==Design==
Much of the basic design considerations and related parameters are the same as for binoculars, and are covered in that entry, but some expanded comments have been added where appropriate:
* Prism type – porro or roof
* Lens &amp; prism coating (the quality of coating can significantly affect light transmission and image brightness, and in the highest specifications is proportionally more expensive)
* Exit pupil

Exit pupil is defined as the diameter of the objective lens divided by the magnification and expressed in mm. (e.g. an 8×40 will give an exit pupil diameter of 5mm). For a given situation, the greater the exit pupil, the better the light transmission into the eye. Hence, a large objective lens with a low magnification will give good light admission, which is especially important in deteriorating light conditions. The classic 7×50 marine binocular or monocular is ideally suited to low light conditions with its relatively large exit pupil diameter of 7.1mm and a realistic magnification which is practical on a moving boat. However, the exit pupil should be considered in relationship with the human eye pupil diameter. If the exit pupil of the chosen instrument is greater than the human eye pupil, then there will be no benefit, as the eye will be the limiting factor in light admission. In effect, the extra light-gathering potential is wasted. This is a consideration as one ages because human eye pupil dilation range diminishes with age, as shown as an approximate guide in the table below.

* Twilight factor (related to magnification and objective lens diameter and is a guide to the ability to see &quot;detail&quot; at low light conditions and does not necessarily indicate brightness)
* Transmittance (the % of light transmitted through the monocular, indicating brightness and will be over 90% in quality instruments)
* Field of view (important in being able to see a wide panorama and not appearing to be looking down a tunnel).

Field of view (FOV) and magnification are related; FOV increases with decreasing magnification and vice versa. This applies to monoculars, binoculars, and telescopes. However, this relationship also depends on optical design and manufacture, which can cause some variation. The following chart shows the FOV/magnification relationship based on best-in-class data, taken both from tests and manufacturers&#x27; specifications. Contrary to some belief, it is a myth that binoculars offer a wider field of view than monoculars. For a given specification and manufacturer offering, both monocular or binocular options of the same model, the field of view is exactly the same, whether monocular or binocular.

* Water/fog proofing
* General construction – material (metal, plastic), types of body coating
* Armoured body protection (to resist knocks and damage in the field)
* Lens protection/covers (some are integrated, some loose)
* Eye relief

Eye relief is a particularly important (but often overlooked) parameter for spectacle wearers, if the full field of view is to be visible. Although magnification, objective lens diameter, and field of viewn(either in degrees or m @1000m) are often shown on the body of the monocular, eye relief virtually never is (except, perhaps, to say &quot;long eye relief&quot; or &quot;LER&quot;). Early optics tended to have short eye relief, (sub-10mm) but more contemporary designs are much better. At least 15mm is desirable—ideally near 20mm—for spectacle wearers. (See table of eye reliefs below noting the best in class, Opticron 5×30 at 25mm and Opticron 8×42 DBA, at 21mm). Eye relief can seriously compromise the field of view if too short, so even if an optic has a good field of view specification, without an accompanying long eye relief, the benefit of the wide view will not be obtained (again, only applying to spectacle wearers). The eye lens diameter can greatly facilitate good eye relief. The photograph below shows a comparison between two 8× monoculars. The one on the left, typical of a 1980s-design, features a relatively small eyepiece lens diameter (11mm) and eye relief (&lt;10mm). The one on the right is from 2016, featuring a comparatively larger eyepiece diameter (24mm) and eye relief (~15mm). This large eyepiece lens not only helps eye relief, but also helps to create a wider field of view. 

Two additional aspects which are particularly relevant in the context of monoculars are the following:
* Focusing mechanism

A significant difference between binoculars and monoculars is in the focusing system. Today, binoculars almost universally use a central wheel focusing system, operating on both sides simultaneously. Some large observation binoculars, as well as some older designs, feature individual focusing on each eyepiece. Monoculars, however, employ a variety of different focusing systems, all with pros and cons. These include the following:
* A large knurled focusing ring around the body of the monocular
* A small focusing ring, close to the eyepiece
* A small external focusing wheel, alongside and/or above the monocular
* A small focusing lever
* A sliding focus button
* A toggle-focus mechanism on top of the monocular
* A large knurled ring surrounding the objective lens
* &quot;Dual focus,&quot; where there are two focusing rings.

The most common type is the focusing ring around the body. This retains the compactness of the unit, but requires two hands to operate and does not give particularly fast focusing. In some units, the ring can be stiff to operate.

The small ring near the eyepiece also usually needs two hands to operate, and, in some designs, can interfere with the twist-up eye cup. Being small, it can, also be less convenient to operate, especially whilst wearing gloves. The degree of twist, from closest focus to infinity, varies between manufacturers. Some use a very small twist (about a quarter of a turn), whereas others use a full turn or more. The small degree of twist gives a very fast focus, but can be overly sensitive, and, in some designs, be too stiff to use with one hand. A full turn is a practical compromise.

A focusing wheel tends not to be used on top quality monoculars (with the exception of the Bushnell 10×42HD Legend), but is particularly popular on budget offerings from China. Although it makes the monocular more bulky, it does give very convenient focusing with one hand (via one finger) and is particularly fast and smooth, which is necessary in circumstances where quick, accurate changes of focus are important (e.g. bird watching, in a wood).

A focusing lever is not common, but is used, for example, on the Opticron Trailfinder. This mechanism provides very quick focusing while retaining compactness, but can be stiff and overly sensitive to use, and again, ideally needs two hands.

Minox and some others use a slider button, rather than a lever, on low magnification, ultra-compact designs. This slider button is pushed side to side, which is also fast, but sensitive.

Toggle focus is very rarely used (e.g. Carson Bandit 8×25). It provides a one-handed focus mechanism in a relatively large toggle, making it quick and easy to operate &quot;in the field&quot; with gloves, but can be over-sensitive and difficult to fine tune.

The knurled ring around the objective lens appears to be a unique feature of the Minox 8×25 Macroscope and claims to provide quick focusing.

Some low-budget entry-level monoculars from China claim &quot;dual focusing&quot;, which means focusing by means of twisting either the main body of the monocular and/or the smaller ring near the eyepiece (referred to as the dioptre adjustment on binoculars). Why dual focusing is felt necessary on a monocular is questionable, but could be for marketing reasons; there is no real technical benefit to such a system, which is never found on the top-quality monoculars from manufacturers like Opticron, Leica, and Zeiss.

* Zoom or variable magnification

As with binoculars, zoom magnification is sometimes available, but is virtually unknown in the best quality units (both binoculars and monoculars) as the optical quality and field of view are seriously compromised. Although zoom systems are widely and successfully used on cameras for observation optics, zoom systems with any credibility are reserved for top quality spotting scopes and come with a very high price tag. Zoom monoculars are available from some &quot;budget&quot; manufacturers, which sound impressive on paper, but often have extreme and unrealistic magnification ranges, as well as an extremely narrow field of view.

==Some examples of current monoculars by specification==
(Prices are typical UK selling prices .)

==Interpreting product specifications==
As mentioned previously, product specifications can sometimes be misleading, confusing or incorrect values stated. Such inaccuracies are more commonly found on budget items but have also sometimes been seen from some brand leaders. For those not experienced in interpreting such specifications, it is always wise to try out the item before buying wherever possible. Some of the descriptors needing particular care with include:

* Basic size (e.g. 8×30). As mentioned earlier, examples are sometimes seen where product physical dimensions or some other arbitrary figures are stated instead of magnification and objective lens diameter. This is very misleading and does not properly describe the product. Examples seen include a &quot;40×60&quot; in a compact monocular, where the objective lens diameter was actually 40mm (and the magnification was certainly not 40×). Another, described as &quot;35×95&quot;, was actually a 20×40. Also, in a few cases, the overall diameter of the case surrounding the objective lens is used, rather than the lens itself, thus making it seem the objective lens is bigger than it truly is. Magnifications can also be exaggerated, an example of a claimed 16× in reality being closer to an 8x, with the number &quot;16&quot; probably referring to the eyepiece lens diameter. In this case, the claimed &quot;16×52&quot; was in reality an &quot;8×42&quot;. Care is needed with such misleading and exaggerated specifications, more likely to be found on some very low budget items.
* &quot;Day–night vision&quot; or sometimes just &quot;night vision&quot; is another misleading descriptor commonly seen in the specification of low-end, budget monoculars as it gives the impression the item is a night-vision instrument, effective in darkness, when it clearly is not. True night vision monoculars (or &quot;image intensifiers&quot;, as typically used in military applications for example) use an electrical power source for light enhancement and are substantially more expensive and bulky than a comparable normal monocular.
* Zoom is sometimes stated where there is no zoom facility. Zoom means a &quot;variable&quot; magnification facility, as often seen on cameras, for example. The term &quot;zoom&quot; or misleading phrases like &quot;power zoom&quot; or &quot;mega zoom&quot; are used incorrectly when referring to a single magnification optic. Zoom values will always be two numbers separated by a hyphen (e.g. 8–20) and then followed by the objective lens diameter (e.g. 8–20×50). As mentioned elsewhere in this entry, a true zoom facility can be seen on some budget monoculars but with very significant optical limitations.
* Field of view (fov) specification. This parameter is sometimes stated incorrectly (over-stated) and needs interpreting with care when buying an instrument without first field-testing. It is normally expressed in degrees, m@1000m or ft@1000yds. An approximate conversion from degrees to m@1000m is to multiply degrees by 17.5 which can be used as a check if both values are stated. The author has carried out fov tests on several monoculars and the results shown in the table below. Generally, the manufacturer&#x27;s stated figure is accurate within a few percentages but two were considerably over-stated, one in particular (9×30) by 30%. When reviewing a claimed fov value, reference can be made to the fov/magnification relationship in Design, above. This relationship represents best-in-class and so anything substantially exceeding a fov value from this plot, for a given magnification, should be treated with caution, especially in budget offerings.

==Specialist monoculars==

Some monoculars satisfy specialist requirements and include:

<doc id="201517" wikidata="Q14565700" url="?curid=201517" title="Social studies">
<text>In many countries&#x27; curricula, social studies is the combined study of humanities, the arts, and social sciences, mainly including history, economics, and civics. The term was coined by American educators around the turn of the twentieth century as a catch-all for these subjects, as well as others which did not fit into the models of lower education in the United States such as philosophy and psychology. One of the purposes of social studies, particularly at the level of higher education, is to integrate several disciplines, with their unique methodologies and special focuses of concentration, into a coherent field of subject areas that communicate with each other by sharing different academic &quot;tools&quot; and perspectives for deeper analysis of social problems and issues. Social studies aims to train students for informed, responsible participation in a diverse democratic society. It provides the necessary background knowledge in order to develop values and reasoned opinions, and the objective of the field is civic competence. A related term is humanities, arts, and social sciences, abbreviated HASS.

== In Australia ==
Human Society and Its Environment (HSIE) is a similar term used in the education system of the Australian state of New South Wales.

== In the United Kingdom ==
The social studies field emerged in the 19th century and later grew in the 20th century. Those foundations and building blocks were put into place in the 1820s in the country of Great Britain before being integrated into the United States.

== In the United States ==
The subject was introduced to promote social welfare and its development in countries like the United States and others.

An early concept of social studies is found in John Dewey&#x27;s philosophy of elementary and secondary education. Dewey valued the subject field of geography for uniting the study of human occupations with the study of the earth. He valued inquiry as a process of learning, as opposed to the absorption and recitation of facts, and he advocated for greater inquiry in elementary and secondary education, to mirror the kind of learning that takes place in higher education. His ideas are manifested to a large degree in the practice of inquiry-based learning and student-directed investigations implemented in contemporary social studies classrooms. Dewey valued the study of history for its social processes and application to contemporary social problems, rather than a mere narrative of human events. In this view, the study of history is made relevant to the modern student and is aimed at the improvement of society.

In the United States through the 1900s, social studies revolved around the study of geography, government, and history. In 1912, the Bureau of Education (not to be confused with its successor, the United States Department of Education) was tasked by then Secretary of the Interior Franklin Knight Lane with completely restructuring the American education system for the twentieth century. In response, the Bureau of Education, together with the National Education Association, created the Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary Education. The commission was made up of 16 committees (a 17th was established two years later, in 1916), each one tasked with the reform of a specific aspect of the American Education system. Among these was the Committee on Social Studies, which was created to consolidate and standardize subjects that did not fit within normal school curricula into a new subject, to be called &quot;the social studies&quot;.

The work done by the Committee on Social Studies culminated in the publication of Bulletin No. 28 (also called &quot;The Committee on Social Studies Report, 1916&quot;). The 66-page bulletin, published and distributed by the Bureau of Education, is believed to be the first work dedicated entirely to the subject. It was designed to introduce the concept to American educators and serve as a guide for the creation of nationwide curricula based around social studies. The bulletin proposed many ideas that were considered radical at the time, and it is regarded by many educators as one of the most controversial educational resources of the early twentieth century. Early proponents of the field of social studies include Harold O. Rugg and David Saville Muzzey.

In the years after its release, the bulletin received criticism from educators on its vagueness, especially in regards to the definition of social studies itself. Critics often point to Section 1 of the report, which vaguely defines social studies as &quot;understood to be those whose subject matter relates directly to the organization and development of human society, and to man as a member of social groups.&quot;

The changes to the field of study didn&#x27;t fully materialize until the 1950s, when changes occurred at the state and national levels that dictated the curriculum and the preparation standards of its teachers. This led to a decrease in the amount of factual knowledge being delivered, and instead focused on key concepts, generalizations, and intellectual skills. By the 1980s and 1990s, the development of computer technologies helped grow the publishing industry. Textbooks were created around the curriculum of each state and that, coupled with the increase in political factors from globalization and growing economies, lead to changes in the public and private education systems. Now came the influx of national curriculum standards, from the increase of testing to the accountability of teachers and school districts shifting the social study education system to what it has become.

== Branches of social studies ==
Social studies is not a subject unto itself, instead functioning as a field of study that incorporates many different subjects. It primarily includes the subjects of history, economics, and civics. Through all of that, the elements of geography, sociology, ethics, psychology, philosophy, anthropology, art and literature are incorporated into the subject field itself. The field of study itself focuses on human beings and their respective relationships. With that, many of these subjects include some form of social utility that is beneficial to the subject field itself. The whole field is rarely taught; typically, a few subjects combined are taught. Recognition of the field has, arguably, lessened the significance of history, with the exception of U.S. History. Initially, only History and Civics were significant parts of the high school curriculum; eventually, Economics became a significant part of the high school curriculum, as well. While History and Civics were already established, the significance of Economics in the high school curriculum is more recent. History and Civics are similar in many ways, though they differ in class activity. There was some division between scholars on the topic of merging the subjects, though it was agreed that presenting a full picture of the world to students was extremely important.

=== College level ===
Social studies as a college major or concentration remains uncommon, although such a degree is offered at Harvard University. Harvard first introduced social studies as a formal field of study in 1960, through the work of a committee led by Stanley Hoffman, and today known as the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, guitarist Tom Morello, and theater director Diana Paulus all concentrated in social studies during their time at Harvard.

== Teaching social studies ==
To teach social studies in the United States, one must obtain a valid teaching certification to teach in that given state and a valid subject specific certification in social studies. The social studies certification process focuses on the core areas of history, economics, and civics, and sometimes psychology, and sociology. Each state has specific requirements for the certification process and the teacher must follow the specific guidelines of the state they wish to teach.

== Ten themes of social studies ==
According to the National Council for the Social Studies, there are ten themes that represent the standards about human experience that is constituted in the effectiveness of social studies as a subject study from pre-K through 12th grade.

=== Culture ===
The study of culture and diversity allows learners to experience culture through all stages from learning to adaptation, shaping their respective lives and society itself. This social studies theme includes the principles of multiculturalism, a field of study in its own right that aims to achieve greater understanding between culturally diverse groups of students as well as including the experiences of culturally diverse learners in the curriculum.

=== Time, continuity, and change ===
Learners examine the past and the history of events that lead to the development of the current world. Ultimately, the learners will examine the beliefs and values of the past to apply them to the present. Learners build their inquiry skills in the study of history.

=== People, places, and environment ===
Learners will understand who they are and the environment and places that surround them. It gives spatial views and perspectives of the world to the learner. This theme is largely contained in the field of geography, which includes the study of humanity&#x27;s connections with resources, instruction in reading maps and techniques and perspectives in analyzing information about human populations and the Earth&#x27;s systems.

=== Individual development and identity ===
Learners will understand their own personal identity, development, and actions. Through this, they will be able to understand the influences that surround them.

=== Individuals, groups, and institutions ===
Learners will understand how groups and institutions influence people&#x27;s everyday lives. They will be able to understand how groups and institutions are formed, maintained, and changed.

=== Power, authority, and governance ===
Learners will understand the forms of power, authority, and governance from historical to contemporary times. They will become familiar with the purpose of power, and with the limits that power has on society.

=== Production, distribution, and consumption ===
Learners will understand the organization of goods and services, ultimately preparing the learner for the study of greater economic issues. The study of economic issues, and with it, financial literacy, is intended to increase students&#x27; knowledge and skills when it comes to participating in the economy as workers, producers, and consumers.

=== Science, technology, and society ===
Learners will understand the relationship between science, technology, and society, understanding the advancement through the years and the impacts they have had.

=== Global connections ===
Learners will understand the interactive environment of global interdependence and will understand the global connections that shape the everyday world.

=== Civic ideals and practices ===
Learners will understand the rights and responsibilities of citizens and learn to grow in their appreciation of active citizenship. Ultimately, this helps their growth as full participants in society. Some of the values that civics courses strive to teach are an understanding of the right to privacy, an appreciation for diversity in American society, and a disposition to work through democratic procedures. One of the curricular tools used in the field of civics education is a simulated congressional hearing. Social studies educators and scholars distinguish between different levels of civic engagement, from the minimal engagement or non-engagement of the legal citizen to the most active and responsible level of the transformative citizen. Within social studies, the field of civics aims to educate and develop learners into transformative citizens who not only participate in a democracy, but challenge the status quo in the interest of social justice.

<doc id="201525" wikidata="Q34091" url="?curid=201525" title="Mae Jemison">
<text>Mae Carol Jemison (born October 17, 1956) is an American engineer, physician, and former NASA astronaut. She became the first African-American woman to travel into space when she served as a mission specialist aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; in 1992. Jemison joined NASA&#x27;s astronaut corps in 1987 and was selected to serve for the STS-47 mission, during which the &quot;Endeavour&quot; orbited the Earth for nearly eight days on September 12–20, 1992.

Born in Alabama and raised in Chicago, Jemison graduated from Stanford University with degrees in chemical engineering as well as African and African-American studies. She then earned her medical degree from Cornell University. Jemison was a doctor for the Peace Corps in Liberia and Sierra Leone from 1983 until 1985 and worked as a general practitioner. In pursuit of becoming an astronaut, she applied to NASA.

Jemison left NASA in 1993 and founded a technology research company. She later formed a non-profit educational foundation and through the foundation is the principal of the 100 Year Starship project funded by DARPA. Jemison also wrote several books for children and appeared on television several times, including in a 1993 episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. She holds several honorary doctorates and has been inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame and the International Space Hall of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Mae Carol Jemison was born in Decatur, Alabama, on October 17, 1956, the youngest of three children of Charlie Jemison and Dorothy Jemison (). Her father was a maintenance supervisor for a charity organization, and her mother worked most of her career as an elementary school teacher of English and math at the Ludwig van Beethoven Elementary School in Chicago, Illinois. The family first lived in Woodlawn and later the Morgan Park neighborhoods. Jemison knew from a young age that she wanted to study science and someday go into space. The television show &quot;Star Trek&quot; and, in particular, African-American actress Nichelle Nichols&#x27; portrayal of Lieutenant Uhura further stoked her interest in space.

Jemison enjoyed studying nature and human physiology, using her observations to learn more about science. Although her mother encouraged her curiosity and both her parents were supportive of her interest in science, she did not always see the same support from her teachers. When Jemison told a kindergarten teacher she wanted to be a scientist when she grew up, the teacher assumed she meant she wanted to be a nurse. Seeing a lack of female astronauts during the Apollo missions also frustrated Jemison. She later recalled, &quot;everybody was thrilled about space, but I remember being irritated that there were no women astronauts.&quot;

Jemison began studying ballet at the age of 8 or 9 and entered high school at 12 years old, where she joined the cheerleading team and the Modern Dance Club. Jemison had a great love for dance from a young age. She learned several styles of dance, including African and Japanese, as well as ballet, jazz, and modern dance. As a child, Jemison had aspirations of becoming a professional dancer. At the age of 14, she auditioned for the leading role of Maria in &quot;West Side Story&quot;. She did not get the leading role but was selected as a background dancer.

After graduating from Chicago&#x27;s Morgan Park High School in 1973, Jemison entered Stanford University at the age of 16. Although she was young to be leaving home for college, Jemison later said it did not faze her because she was &quot;naive and stubborn enough&quot;. There were very few other African-American students in Jemison&#x27;s classes and she continued to experience discrimination from her teachers. In an interview with &quot;The Des Moines Register&quot; in 2008, Jemison said that it was difficult to go to Stanford at 16 but that her youthful arrogance may have helped her; she asserted that some arrogance is necessary for women and minorities to be successful in a white male dominated society.

At Stanford, Jemison served as head of the Black Students Union. She also choreographed a musical and dance production called &quot;Out of the Shadows&quot;. During her senior year in college, she struggled with the choice between going to medical school or pursuing a career as a professional dancer after graduation; she graduated from Stanford in 1977, receiving a B.S. degree in chemical engineering. and B.A. degree in African and African-American studies. While at Stanford, she also pursued studies related to her childhood interest in space and first considered applying to NASA.

== Medical career ==
Jemison attended Cornell Medical School and during her training, traveled to Cuba, to conduct a study funded by American Medical Student Association and to Thailand, where she worked at a Cambodian refugee camp. She also worked for Flying Doctors stationed in East Africa. During her years at Cornell, Jemison continued to study dance by enrolling in classes at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. After graduating with an M.D. degree in 1981, she interned at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center in 1982, and worked as a general practitioner for Ross–Loos Medical Group.

Jemison joined the staff of the Peace Corps in 1983 and served as a medical officer until 1985. She was responsible for the health of Peace Corps volunteers serving in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Jemison supervised the Peace Corps&#x27; pharmacy, laboratory, medical staff as well as providing medical care, writing self-care manuals, and developing and implementing guidelines for health and safety issues. She also worked with the Centers for Disease Control helping with research for various vaccines.

== NASA career ==

Upon returning to the United States after serving in the Peace Corps, Jemison settled in Los Angeles, California. In Los Angeles, she entered into private practice and took graduate-level engineering courses. Inspired by the flights of Sally Ride and Guion Bluford in 1983, Jemison applied to the astronaut program in October 1985. After NASA postponed selection of new candidates after the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster in 1986, Jemison reapplied in 1987. She was chosen out of roughly 2,000 applicants for 15 slots in NASA Astronaut Group 12, the first selected after &quot;Challenger.&quot; The Associated Press covered her as the &quot;first black woman astronaut&quot; in 1987. CBS featured Jemison as one of the country&#x27;s &quot;most eligible singles&quot; on &quot;Best Catches&quot;, a television special hosted by Phylicia Rashad and Robb Weller in 1989.

Jemison&#x27;s work with NASA before her shuttle launch included launch support activities at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and verification of Shuttle computer software in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL). On September 28, 1989, she was selected to join the STS-47 crew as Mission Specialist 4 and was also designated Science Mission Specialist, a new astronaut role being tested by NASA to focus on scientific experiments.

=== STS-47 ===
Jemison flew her only space mission from September 12 to 20, 1992, as one of the seven-member crew aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;, on mission STS-47, a cooperative mission between the United States and Japan, as well as the 50th shuttle mission. Jemison logged 190 hours, 30 minutes, 23 seconds in space and orbited the earth 127 times. The crew was split into two shifts with Jemison assigned to the Blue Shift. Throughout the eight-day mission, she began communications on her shift with the salute &quot;Hailing frequencies open&quot;, a quote from &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Jemison took a poster from the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater along with her on the flight. She also took a West African statuette and a photo of pioneering aviator Bessie Coleman, the first African American with an international pilot license.

STS-47 carried the Spacelab Japan module, a cooperative mission between the United States and Japan that included 43 Japanese and United States life science and materials processing experiments. Jemison and Japanese astronaut Mamoru Mohri were trained to use the Autogenic Feedback Training Exercise (AFTE), a technique developed by Patricia S. Cowings that uses biofeedback and autogenic training to help patients monitor and control their physiology as a possible treatment for motion sickness, anxiety and stress-related disorders.

Aboard the Spacelab Japan module, Jemison tested NASA&#x27;s Fluid Therapy System, a set of procedures and equipment to produce water for injection, developed by Sterimatics Corporation. She then used IV bags and a mixing method, developed by Baxter Healthcare, to use the water from the previous step to produce saline solution in space. Jemison was also a co-investigator of two bone cell research experiments. Another experiment she participated in was to induce female frogs to ovulate, fertilize the eggs, and then see how tadpoles developed in zero gravity.

=== Resignation from NASA ===
Jemison resigned from NASA in March 1993 to start a company. NASA training manager and author Homer Hickam, who had trained Jemison for her flight, later expressed some regret that she had departed.

== Post-NASA career ==

Jemison served on the board of directors of the World Sickle Cell Foundation from 1990 to 1992. In 1993, she founded The Jemison Group Inc., a consulting firm which considers the sociocultural impact of technological advancements and design. Jemison also founded the Dorothy Jemison Foundation for Excellence and named the foundation in honor of her mother. One of the projects of the foundation is &quot;The Earth We Share&quot;, a science camp for students aged 12 to 16. Founded in 1994, camps have been held at Dartmouth College, Colorado School of Mines, Choate Rosemary Hall and other sites in the United States, as well as internationally in South Africa, Tunisia, and Switzerland. The Dorothy Jemison Foundation also sponsors other events and programs, including the Shaping the World essay competition, Listening to the Future (a survey program that targets obtaining opinions from students), Earth Online (an online chatroom that allows students to safely communicate and discuss ideas on space and science), and the Reality Leads Fantasy Gala.

Jemison was a professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College from 1995 to 2002 where she directed the Jemison Institute for Advancing Technology in Developing Countries. In 1999, she also became an Andrew D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University. Jemison continues to advocate strongly in favor of science education and getting minority students interested in science. She is a member of various scientific organizations, such as the American Medical Association, the American Chemical Society, the Association of Space Explorers and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In 1999, Jemison founded BioSentient Corp and obtained the license to commercialize AFTE, the technique she and Mohri tested on themselves during STS-47.

In 2012, Jemison made the winning bid for the DARPA 100 Year Starship project through the Dorothy Jemison Foundation for Excellence. The Dorothy Jemison Foundation for Excellence was awarded a $500,000 grant for further work. The new organization maintained the organizational name 100 Year Starship. Jemison is the current principal of the 100 Year Starship.

In 2018, she collaborated with Bayer Crop Science and National 4-H Council for the initiative named Science Matters which was aimed at encouraging young children to understand and pursue agricultural sciences.

== Books ==
Jemison&#x27;s first book, &quot;Find Where the Wind Goes&quot; (2001), is a memoir of her life written for children. She describes her childhood, her time at Stanford, in the Peace Corps and as an astronaut. &quot;School Library Journal&quot; found the stories about her earlier life to be the most appealing. &quot;Book Report&quot; found that the autobiography gave a realistic view into her interactions with her professors, whose treatment of her was not based on her intelligence but on stereotypes of woman of color.

Her &quot;A True Book&quot; series of four children&#x27;s books published in 2013 is co-authored with Dana Meachen Rau. Each book in the series has a &quot;Find the Truth&quot; challenge, true or false questions answers to which are revealed at the end of the story. &quot;School Library Journal&quot; found the series to be &quot;properly tantalizing surveys&quot; of the Solar System but criticized the inclusion of a few outdated theories in physics and astronomy.

== Public profile ==
LeVar Burton learned that Jemison was an avid &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan and asked her if she would be interested in being on the show. In 1993, Jemison appeared as Lieutenant Palmer in &quot;Second Chances&quot;, an episode of the science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, becoming the first real-life astronaut to appear on &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

From 1999 to 2005, Jemison was appointed an Andrew Dickson White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University.

Jemison is an active public speaker who appears before private and public groups promoting science and technology. &quot;Having been an astronaut gives me a platform,&quot; says Jemison, &quot;but I&#x27;d blow it if I just talked about the Shuttle.&quot; Jemison uses her platform to speak out on the gap in the quality of health-care between the United States and the Third World, saying that &quot;Martin Luther King [Jr.]... didn&#x27;t just have a dream, he got things done.&quot; Jemison has also appeared as host and technical consultant of the science series &quot;World of Wonder&quot; which aired on the Discovery Channel from 1994 to 1998.

In 2006, Jemison participated in &quot;African American Lives&quot;, a PBS television miniseries hosted by Henry Louis Gates Jr., that traces the family history of eight famous African Americans using historical research and genetic techniques. Jemison found to her surprise that she is 13% East Asian in her genetic makeup. She also learned that some of her paternal ancestors were slaves at a plantation in Talladega County, Alabama.

Jemison participated in the Red Dress Heart Truth fashion show, wearing Lyn Devon, during the 2007 New York Fashion Week to help raise money to fight heart disease. In May of the same year, she was the graduation commencement speaker and only the 11th person in the 52-year history of Harvey Mudd College to be awarded an honorary D.Eng. degree.

On February 17, 2008, Jemison was the featured speaker for the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first sorority established by African-American college women. Jemison paid tribute to Alpha Kappa Alpha by carrying the sorority&#x27;s banner with her on her shuttle flight. Her space suit is a part of the sorority&#x27;s national traveling Centennial Exhibit. Jemison is an honorary member of Alpha Kappa Alpha.

Jemison participated with First Lady Michelle Obama in a forum for promising girls in the Washington, D.C. public schools in March 2009.

In 2014, Jemison also appeared at Wayne State University for their annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Tribute Luncheon. In 2016, she partnered with Bayer Corporation to promote and advance science literacy in schools, emphasizing hands-on experimentation.

She took part in the Michigan State University&#x27;s lecture series, &quot;Slavery to Freedom: An American Odyssey&quot;, in February 2017. In May 2017, Jemison gave the commencement speech at Rice University. She discussed the 100 Year Plan, science and education and other topics at Western Michigan University also in May 2017.

In 2017, LEGO released the &quot;Women of NASA&quot; set, with minifigures of Jemison, Margaret Hamilton, Sally Ride, and Nancy Grace Roman. The Google Doodle on March 8, 2019 (International Women&#x27;s Day) featured a quote from Jemison: &quot;Never be limited by other people&#x27;s limited imaginations.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Jemison built a dance studio in her home and has choreographed and produced several shows of modern jazz and African dance.

In the spring of 1996, Jemison filed a complaint against a Texas police officer, accusing him of police brutality during a traffic stop that ended in her arrest. She was pulled over by Nassau Bay police officer Henry Hughes for allegedly making an illegal U-turn and arrested after Hughes learned of an outstanding warrant on Jemison for a speeding ticket. In the process of arresting her, the officer twisted her wrist and forced her to the ground, as well as having her walk barefooted from the patrol car into the police station. In her complaint, Jemison said the officer physically and emotionally mistreated her. Jemison&#x27;s attorney said she believed she had already paid the speeding ticket years ago. She spent several hours in jail and was treated at an area hospital after release for deep bruises and a head injury. The Nassau Bay officer was suspended with pay pending an investigation, but the police investigation cleared him of wrongdoing. She filed a lawsuit against the city of Nassau Bay and the officer.

<doc id="201528" wikidata="Q1268283" url="?curid=201528" title="Romani music">
<text>Romani music (often referred to as gypsy or gipsy music, which is often considered a derogatory term) is the music of the Romani people who have their origins in northern India but today live mostly in Europe.

Historically nomadic, though now largely settled, the Romani people have long acted as entertainers and tradesmen. In many of the places Romanies live they have become known as musicians. The wide distances travelled have introduced a multitude of influences of: Arabic, Byzantine, French, Germanic, Greek, Hungarian, Indian, Persian, Romanian, Slavic, Spanish, Turkish and Jewish musical forms.

It is difficult to define the parameters of a unified Romani musical style, as there are many differences in melodic, harmonic, rhythmic and formal structures from region to region. Lyrics to Romani songs are often sung in one or more dialects of the Romani language, and dance frequently accompanies Romani music performance.

The quintessentially Spanish flamenco is to a very large extent the music (and dance, or indeed the culture) of the Romani people of Andalusia.

Romani people sometimes also perform Hip hop.

==Original Romani music==
Original Romani folksongs, not derived from the countries where the Roma live, are relatively rare. This particular folk music is mainly vocal and consists of slow plaintive songs and fast melodies which may be accompanied by dancing. The fast melodies are accompanied with tongue-clacking, hand-clapping, mouth-basses, clicking of wooden spoons and other techniques.

There are five main components that are found throughout Romani music of various territories. The first is the use of three voices or parts: the melodic line, the terce and the quint either through vocalization or instruments. The second is syncopation, where the music starts right after a beat while maintaining a consistent rhythm. The third is having the music played in different phrases, meaning that the entrance and exit of different musical themes are felt at different times throughout a song either through rhythm or instruments. The fourth is harmony, where a minor key center is often used instead of a major one. The last is singing, where natural vocal abilities are emphasized.

The development of Romani music dates back to the playing of instruments such as lutes in the late 1400s in Hungary and Italy. Roma would perform with non-Roma as entertainers in any aspect of performance. Eventually, as organized religion gained traction, performance became less emphasized and sometimes prohibited for non-Roma populations, so Roma filled all professional entertainment spots. They also performed at life events such as weddings, baptisms, funerals and circumcisions. 

Because there is no one nation state for Roma, they were often forced to create their own living spaces within the countries they settled. Musical and cultural influences were taken from the countries where they lived and incorporated into their own music such as instruments, languages and subject matter of the music itself. Some songs incorporate the Romani language.

==Country-related music==
Most Romani music is based on the folk music of the countries where the Roma went through or settled. Local music is adopted and performed – usually instrumental – and, slowly, it is transformed into Romani styles, which are usually more complex than the original styles. In its turn, Romani music has greatly influenced the local music. Among these the Hungarian versions have become best known, although examples of Romani music in other countries also endure.

This regional aspect of Romani music is vividly expressed in the documentary &quot;Latcho Drom&quot;, which follows Romani music from Northern India through Egypt, Turkey, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and France, ending in Spain.

===Bulgaria===
Due to the significant Romani population in Bulgaria, this ethnic group&#x27;s music is very popular. &quot;Chalgamata&quot; music is also played by Romani musicians in Bulgaria.

===Hungary===
The Rajkó Orchestra and Folk Ensemble is known for preserving Hungarian Roma music, dance and costume culture since 1952. Their work carries on the traditions of century-old generations. Their performances can be seen at a number of venues, among others at the Danube Palace of Budapest during the season between 1 May and 31 October.

Traditionally there are two types of Romani music: one rendered for non-Romani audiences, the other is made within the Romani community.  The music performed for outsiders is called &quot;gypsy music&quot;, which is a colloquial name that comes from Ferenc Liszt. They call the music they play among themselves &quot;folk music&quot;. 

In the early 19th century, Romani musicians became the representatives of national music. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 in Hungary, Romani bands played their music for soldiers before and after the battle to encourage and entertain them. After the loss of the war, these musicians gained a lot of respect from the country. Romani music became the symbol of desired freedom.

===Romania===

The &quot;Lăutari&quot; were traditional Romani musicians, playing at various events (weddings, funerals, etc.)

The &quot;manele&quot; genre which is very popular in Romania is supported by Romani ethnic musicians, too.

It is thought of as having been made by Turkish Romani which brought Oriental influences mixed with Roma music and dance. It is generally thought of as lower class due to being associated with the Roma.

===Russia===
A choir in Russia was the Sokolovsky choir.

In 1931, a public Romani theatre, Romen Theatre, has been established in Moscow incorporating Romani music and dance into theatrical performances.

===Serbia===
Roma musical styles spread through Serbia during the Ottoman period.

===Spain===
The Romani people of Spain (Iberian Kale people) have contributed significantly to the Andalusian musical tradition known as flamenco. And is widely recognised as Romani music considering it was made by Roma as a response to oppression. Flamenco is closely associated to this ethnicity and a significant proportion of famous flamenco artists are Iberian Kale people.

===Turkey===
Roma are known throughout Turkey for their musicianship. Their urban music brought echoes of classical Turkish music to the public via the &quot;meyhane&quot; or &quot;taverna&quot;. This type of &quot;fasıl&quot; music (a style, not to be confused with the fasıl form of classical Turkish music) coupled with food and alcoholic beverages is often associated with the underclass of Turkish society, though it also can be found in more &quot;respectable&quot; establishments in modern times.

Roma have also influenced the fasıl itself. Played in music halls, the dance music (&quot;oyun havası&quot;) required at the end of each fasıl has been incorporated with Ottoman &quot;rakkas&quot; or belly dancing motifs. The rhythmic ostinato accompanying the instrumental improvisation (&quot;ritimli taksim&quot;) for the belly-dance parallels that of the classical &quot;gazel&quot;, a vocal improvisation in free rhythm with rhythmic accompaniment. Popular musical instruments in this kind of fasıl are the clarinet, violin, kanun and darbuka. Clarinetist Mustafa Kandıralı is a well known fasıl musician.

==Balkans==
A typical types of Romani music are known as Tallava and Manele . Tallava was originated by the Roma minority in Kosovo in the 1990s. The genre of Tallava was later adopted among the Ashkali group. Tallava is common in Albania. Manele originated from the Roma minority in Romania who came from Istanbul . Played by Roma musicians (Lăutari) during late 18th to early 19th century. This genre has influences from other music genres such as Greek (Laïko, Arabesque Pop [some heavy duty variety called Skiladiko]) and Bulgarian (Chalga). It also blended with Turkish (Arabesque), Arabic (Arabic pop music), Serbian (Turbo-folk) and Albanian music.

==Western Europe==
Gypsy Jazz is popular in France.

<doc id="201531" wikidata="Q234358" url="?curid=201531" title="Symphony No. 44 (Haydn)">
<text>Symphony No. 44 in E minor, Hoboken I/44, was completed in 1772 by Joseph Haydn. It is popularly known as Trauer (). An apocryphal story relates that Haydn asked for the slow movement of this symphony to be played at his funeral.

== Movements ==
The work is in four movements and is scored for two oboes, bassoon, two horns (in E and G), continuo (harpsichord) and strings:
#Allegro con brio, 
#Menuetto e Trio (Trio in E major): Allegretto, 
#Adagio in E major, 
#Finale: Presto, 

The piece is typical of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; (storm and stress) period. The first movement, which is in sonata form, begins with a four-note motif played in unison which occurs throughout the movement. After a brief period of E minor, the second subject, in G major, in its fullest form, appears abruptly. The development section develops both themes, especially the first half of the second theme. The development of the second theme becomes unstoppable and hyperactive and eventually climaxes before modulating back to E minor for the recapitulation. The first subject gets its repeat in the tonic in its fullest form. The second theme, this time in the tonic, only gets the second half of itself repeated, because the first half was widely used in the development section, as it is written above. Instead, there is a brief episode in the middle, which helps the second theme&#x27;s length to stay the same as the exposition.

The second movement, unusually, is a minuet in E minor and trio in E major; thus the work is one of the few symphonies of the Classical era to place the Minuet second (others include Haydn&#x27;s 32nd and 37th, and his brother Michael&#x27;s 15th and 16th). The minuet is in the form of a &quot;Canone in Diapason&quot; between the upper and lower strings with the lower strings trailing the upper strings by a single bar. Haydn would later use a similar double canon with the lower strings trailing the upper strings by one measure in the famous &quot;Witches Minuet&quot; of his D minor quartet from Op. 76.

The third movement is slow, also in E major, and with strings muted. The finale, like the first movement, is in sonata form and is dominated by a figure which opens the movement in unison. It is quite contrapuntal, and ends in E minor rather than finishing in a major key as was usual in most other minor key works of the time.

Since all of the movements have the same tonic, the work is homotonal.

<doc id="201534" wikidata="Q189889" url="?curid=201534" title="Chicago (2002 film)">
<text>Chicago is a 2002 American musical black comedy crime film based on the 1975 stage musical, which in turn originated in the 1926 play. It explores the themes of celebrity, scandal, and corruption in Chicago during the Jazz Age. The film stars an ensemble cast led by Renée Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Richard Gere. &quot;Chicago&quot; centers on Roxie Hart (Zellweger) and Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones), two murderers who find themselves in jail together awaiting trial in 1920s Chicago. Roxie, a housewife, and Velma, a vaudevillian, fight for the fame that will keep them from the gallows. The film marks the feature directorial debut of Rob Marshall, who also choreographed the film, and was adapted by screenwriter Bill Condon, with music by John Kander and lyrics by Fred Ebb.

&quot;Chicago&quot; received critical acclaim, with particular praise for the performances of the cast. The film went on to win six Academy Awards in 2003, including Best Picture, making it the first musical to win Best Picture since &quot;Oliver!&quot; in 1968. For her performance, Zeta-Jones won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the British Academy Film Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, and the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress. Zellweger won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, and Gere won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. &quot;Chicago&quot; was the tenth-highest-grossing film of the year domestically in the United States.

==Plot==
In 1924, housewife Roxie Hart watches vaudeville star Velma Kelly perform (&quot;Overture/All That Jazz&quot;) at The Onyx, a Chicago nightclub. Seeking stardom, Roxie begins an affair with furniture salesman Fred Casely, who claims to know the manager. After the show, Velma is arrested for killing her husband and sister upon catching them in bed together. A month later, Casely admits to Roxie that he lied about his connections in order to sleep with her. Enraged, she shoots him dead. She convinces her gullible husband, Amos, to take the fall by telling him she killed a burglar in self-defense. However, when evidence of Roxie&#x27;s infidelity is uncovered, Amos recants and tells the police that Casely was dead when he arrived home (&quot;Funny Honey&quot;). Roxie is arrested, with District Attorney Martin Harrison declaring she faces execution by hanging.

At Cook County Jail, Roxie is sent to Murderess&#x27; Row, supervised by the corrupt Matron &quot;Mama&quot; Morton (&quot;When You&#x27;re Good to Mama&quot;). She learns the backstories of the other women there, including her idol Velma (&quot;Cell Block Tango&quot;), who rebuffs her attempts at friendship. On Morton&#x27;s advice, Roxie engages Velma&#x27;s lawyer, the brilliant Billy Flynn (&quot;All I Care About&quot;). Flynn and Roxie manipulate the press, reinventing Roxie as an originally virtuous Southern woman corrupted by the city&#x27;s decadent nightlife; she claims that she had the affair with Casely because Amos was always working, but repented and left Casely for Amos, and Casely jealously attacked her (&quot;We Both Reached for the Gun&quot;). The press believe the story; praised by the public as a tragic heroine, Roxie becomes an overnight sensation (&quot;Roxie&quot;). Velma, unhappy at losing the public&#x27;s attention, tries to convince Roxie to join her act, replacing her murdered sister (&quot;I Can&#x27;t Do It Alone&quot;), but Roxie, now the more popular of the two rivals, snubs her.

When wealthy heiress Kitty Baxter is arrested for murdering her husband and his two mistresses, the press and Flynn instantly shift their focus to her. To Velma&#x27;s surprise, Roxie quickly regains the spotlight by claiming pregnancy. Amos is ignored by the press (&quot;Mister Cellophane&quot;), and Flynn, to generate more sympathy for Roxie, convinces him that the child is Casely&#x27;s, and that he should divorce Roxie in the midst of her predicament. Roxie decides to fire Flynn, believing she can now win on her own. However, when Katalin Helinszki, a Hungarian woman on Murderess&#x27; Row (the only inmate who insists on her own innocence), becomes the first woman in Cook County history to be executed by hanging, Roxie realizes the gravity of the situation and rehires Flynn.

Roxie&#x27;s trial begins, and Flynn turns it into a media spectacle (&quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot;) with the help of sensationalist newspaper reporters and radio personality Mary Sunshine. Flynn discredits witnesses, manipulates evidence and even stages a public reconciliation between Amos and Roxie when she claims the child is his. The trial seems to be going well for Roxie until Mama and Velma are listening to the trial and find Roxie&#x27;s diary, and bring it to court, reading incriminating entries in exchange for amnesty in her own case. Flynn discredits the diary, implying from its legalistic language that it was written by Harrison, who planted it as evidence (&quot;A Tap Dance&quot;). Roxie is acquitted, but her fame is eclipsed moments later when another woman, who had also shot her own husband, shoots her lawyer outside the courthouse. Flynn admits to Roxie that he tampered with her diary himself, in order to incriminate the DA and also free two clients simultaneously. Amos remains loyal and excited to be a father, but Roxie cruelly reveals that she faked her pregnancy.

Roxie continues to pursue a vaudeville career, with limited success (&quot;Nowadays&quot;). The similarly unsuccessful Velma reapproaches Roxie to suggest performing together as a double act consisting of two murderers. Roxie initially refuses, but later accepts when Velma points out that they can perform together despite their mutual resentment. The two stage a spectacular performance (&quot;Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag&quot;), receiving a standing ovation from an enthusiastic audience that includes Flynn, Morton, the jurors, and other acquitted murderesses.

==Production==
===Development===
The film is based on the 1975 Broadway musical of the same name, which ran for 936 performances but was not well received by audiences, partly because of its cynical tone. A film adaptation of &quot;Chicago&quot; was to have been the next project for Bob Fosse, who had directed and choreographed the original 1975 Broadway production and had won an Oscar for his direction of the film version of &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1972). Although he died before realizing his version, Fosse&#x27;s distinctive jazz choreography style is evident throughout the 2002 film, and he is thanked in the credits. The minimalist 1996 revival of the musical proved far more successful, having played more than 10,601 performances (as of December 3, 2023), holding records for longest-running musical revival, longest-running American musical on Broadway and second longest-running show in Broadway history. Its runaway success sparked a greater appreciation of the 1975 original production and renewed stalled interest in a long-anticipated film, which incorporates the influences of both productions.

The original production&#x27;s musical numbers were staged as vaudeville acts; the film respects this but presents them as cutaway scenes in the mind of the Roxie character, while scenes in &quot;real life&quot; are filmed with a hard-edged grittiness. The musical itself was based on a 1926 Broadway play by Maurine Dallas Watkins, a journalist who had found her inspiration in two real-life Chicago trials she had covered for the press, about two real-life Jazz-era murderers Beulah Annan (Roxie Hart) and Belva Gaertner (Velma Kelly). The George Abbott-directed production, starring Francine Larrimore and Juliette Crosby, ran for 172 performances at the Music Box Theatre, and within a year was adapted to a film, in which Gaertner herself had a cameo. &quot;Chicago&quot; was produced by American companies Miramax Films and The Producers Circle in association with the German company Kallis Productions. &quot;Roxie Hart&quot;, also known as &quot;Chicago&quot; or &quot;Chicago Gal&quot;, is a 1942 American comedy film directed by William A. Wellman and starring Ginger Rogers, Adolphe Menjou and George Montgomery. The film is an adaptation of the 1926 play.

===Filming===
Principal photography took place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and ran from December 2001 to April 2002. The courthouse scene was shot in Osgoode Hall. Other scenes were shot at Queen&#x27;s Park, the former Gooderham and Worts Distillery, Casa Loma, the Elgin Theatre, Union Station, the Canada Life Building, the Danforth Music Hall, and the Old City Hall.

==Music==

Several songs from the musical&#x27;s original score were cut from the film, primarily due to the musical numbers being figments of Roxie&#x27;s imagination. &quot;Tap Dance&quot;, &quot;A Little Bit of Good&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Do It Alone&quot; (reprise), &quot;My Own Best Friend&quot;, &quot;I Know a Girl&quot;, &quot;Me and My Baby&quot; and &quot;When Velma Takes the Stand&quot; were removed, and &quot;Class&quot;, while filmed and recorded for the soundtrack album, is a deleted scene on the DVD, as well as present as part of an &quot;extended version&quot; from the film&#x27;s 2005 broadcast premiere on NBC. An instrumental of &quot;Me and My Baby&quot; can be heard in its spot, where Roxie enjoys the renewed fame after claiming she&#x27;s pregnant.

==Release==
&quot;Chicago&quot; held its world premiere in Los Angeles on December 10, 2002. In North America, the film opened in limited release at 77 theaters on December 27, 2002. It expanded through the following weeks before reaching a peak of 2,701 theaters by the weekend of March 28, 2003, the first weekend after the Academy Awards.

===Home media===

&quot;Chicago&quot; was released by Buena Vista Home Entertainment (under the Miramax Home Entertainment banner) on DVD in Region 1 (USA, Canada, and US territories) on August 19, 2003. It was released in Full Screen and Widescreen. In addition to this release, a two-disc &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot; Edition was released over two years later on December 20, 2005, and later, on Blu-ray format, in January 2007 and, in an updated release, in May 2011. The release provides a feature-length audio commentary track with director Marshall and screenwriter Condon. There is also a deleted musical number called &quot;Class&quot;, performed by Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Chicago&quot; grossed $170.7 million in the United States and Canada, as well as $136.1 million in other territories. Combined, the film grossed $306.8 million worldwide, which was, at the time, the highest gross of any film never to reach #1 or #2 in the weekly box office charts in the North American markets (Canada and United States—where it peaked at #3). Worldwide, &quot;Chicago&quot; was the highest grossing live action musical with $306 million, a record that was then broken by &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;.

===Critical response===
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Chicago&quot; holds an 87% approval rating, based on 261 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;A rousing and energetic adaptation of the Broadway musical, &quot;Chicago&quot; succeeds on the level of pure spectacle, but provides a surprising level of depth and humor as well.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 81 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The cast received widespread acclaim for their performances. Tim Robey, reviewer for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, labeled &quot;Chicago&quot; &quot;the best screen musical for 30 years&quot;. He also stated that it has taken a &quot;three-step tango for us to welcome back the movie musical as a form&quot;. Robey also wrote &quot;this particular &quot;Chicago&quot; makes the most prolific use it possibly can out of one specific advantage the cinema has over the stage when it comes to song and dance: it&#x27;s a sustained celebration of parallel montage&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it &quot;big, brassy fun&quot;. However, other reviews claimed that there were issues with the film being too streamlined, and minor complaints were made about Marshall&#x27;s directing influences.

===Accolades===
==Legacy==
Along with &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (2001) and &quot;8 Mile&quot; (2002), &quot;Chicago&quot; is often credited with ushering a re-emergence of the musical film genre in the 21st century.

Japanese rock band Buck-Tick named their 2010 album &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot; after the film&#x27;s song of the same name.

<doc id="201537" wikidata="Q333024" url="?curid=201537" title="Pluralism (political philosophy)">
<text>Pluralism as a political philosophy is the diversity within a political body, which is seen to permit the peaceful coexistence of different interests, convictions, and lifestyles. While not all political pluralists advocate for a pluralist democracy, this is the most common stance, because democracy is often viewed as the most fair and effective way to moderate between discrete values. 

Political theorist Isaiah Berlin, a strong supporter of pluralism, wrote: &quot;let us have the courage of our admitted ignorance, of our doubts and uncertainties. At least we can try to discover what others ... require, by ... making it possible for ourselves to know men as they truly are, by listening to them carefully and sympathetically, and understanding them and their lives and their needs... .&quot; 
Pluralism thus tries to encourage members of society to accommodate their differences by avoiding extremism (adhering solely to one value, or at the very least refusing to recognize others as legitimate) and engaging in good faith dialogue. Pluralists also seek the construction or reform of social institutions in order to reflect and balance competing principles.

One of the more famous arguments for institutional pluralism came from James Madison in &quot;The Federalist&quot; paper number 10. Madison feared that factionalism would lead to in-fighting in the new American republic and devotes this paper to questioning how best to avoid such an occurrence. He posits that to avoid factionalism, it is best to allow many competing factions (advocating different primary principles) to prevent any one from dominating the political system. This relies, to a degree, on a series of disturbances changing the influences of groups so as to avoid institutional dominance and ensure competition.

Like Edmund Burke, this view concerns itself with balance, and subordinating any single abstract principle to a plurality or realistic harmony of interests. Pluralism recognizes that certain conditions may make good-faith negotiation impossible, and therefore also focuses on what institutional structures can best modify or prevent such a situation. Pluralism advocates institutional design in keeping with a form of pragmatic realism here, with the preliminary adoption of suitable existing socio-historical structures where necessary. One of the problems plaguing any discussion of pluralism is that it is a multi-faceted concept. There are at least four distinct ways in which the term pluralism has been used.

William E. Connolly challenges older theories of pluralism by arguing for pluralization as a goal rather than as a state of affairs. Connolly&#x27;s argument for the &quot;multiplication of factions&quot; follows James Madison&#x27;s logic in engaging groups, constituencies, and voters at both the micro and macro level. Essentially, he has shifted the theory from a conservative theory of order, to a progressive theory of democratic contestation and engagement. Connolly introduces the distinction between pluralism and &quot;pluralization&quot;. Pluralism, whether the interest-group pluralism of Robert A. Dahl or political liberalism&#x27;s &quot;reasonable&quot; pluralism, is oriented towards existing diversity of groups, values, and identities competing for political representation. Pluralization, by contrast, names the emergence of new interests, identities, values, and differences raising claims to representation not currently legible within the existing pluralist imaginary.

==The common good==
Pluralism is connected with the hope that this process of conflict and dialogue will result in a quasi-common good. This common good is not an abstract value or set in stone, however, but an attempt at balancing competing social interests and will thus constantly shift given present social conditions. Proponents in the contemporary political philosophy of such a view include Isaiah Berlin, Stuart Hampshire and Bernard Williams. An earlier version of political pluralism was a strong current in the formation of modern social democracy (to balance socialist and capitalist ideals), with theorists such as the early Harold Laski and G. D. H. Cole, as well as other leading members of the British Fabian Society. In the United States, President Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s &quot;middle way&quot; was arguably motivated by a belief in political pluralism.

While advocated by many pluralists, pluralism need not embrace social democracy given it does not a priori assume a desirable political system. Rather, pluralists advocate one based on the pre-existing traditions and cognizable interests of a given society, and the political structure most likely to harmonize these factors. Thus, pluralists have also included Michael Oakeshott and John Kekes, proponents of something close to liberal conservatism (although will often reject such political labels). What pluralists certainly do have in common is the notion that a single vision or ideological schema, whether Marxism or unbridled neoliberalism, is likely too simplistic and rigid to advocate human beings&#x27; natural plurality of values. Pluralists likewise reject historicism and utopian thinking. While some, like John N. Gray, repudiate historical progress altogether, others, like Edmund Burke, indicate that human progress has occurred, as a function of improved social harmony.

==Conditions==
For pluralism to function and to be successful in defining the common good, all groups have to agree to a minimal consensus that shared values are at least worth pursuing. The most important baseline value is thus that of mutual respect, understanding or tolerance. If no such dialogue is possible, extremism and physical coercion are likely inevitable.

<doc id="201544" wikidata="Q622433" url="?curid=201544" title="Xvid">
<text>Xvid (formerly &quot;XviD&quot;) is a video codec library following the MPEG-4 video coding standard, specifically MPEG-4 Part 2 Advanced Simple Profile (ASP). It uses ASP features such as b-frames, global and quarter pixel motion compensation, lumi masking, trellis quantization, and H.263, MPEG and custom quantization matrices.

Xvid is a primary competitor of the DivX Pro Codec. In contrast with the DivX codec, which is proprietary software developed by DivX, Inc., Xvid is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. This also means that unlike the DivX codec, which is only available for a limited number of platforms, Xvid can be used on all platforms and operating systems for which the source code can be compiled.

==History==
In January 2001, DivXNetworks founded &quot;OpenDivX&quot; as part of Project Mayo which was intended to be a home for open source multimedia projects. OpenDivX was an open-source MPEG-4 video codec based on a stripped-down version of the MoMuSys reference MPEG-4 encoder. The source code, however, was placed under a restrictive license and only members of the DivX Advanced Research Centre (DARC) had write access to the project&#x27;s CVS. In early 2001, DARC member Sparky wrote an improved version of the encoding core called encore2. This was updated several times before, in April, it was removed from CVS without warning. The explanation given by Sparky was &quot;We (our bosses) decided that we are not ready to have it in public yet.&quot;

In July 2001, developers started complaining about a lack of activity in the project; the last CVS commit was several months old, bugfixes were being ignored, and promised documentation had not been written. Soon after, DARC released a beta version of their closed-source commercial DivX 4 codec, which was based on encore2, saying that &quot;what the community really wants is a Winamp, not a Linux.&quot; It was after this that a fork of OpenDivX was created, using the latest version of encore2 that was downloaded before it was removed. Since then, all the OpenDivX code has been replaced and Xvid has been published under the GNU General Public License.

==Patent issues==
As an implementation of MPEG-4 Part 2, Xvid uses many patented technologies. For this reason, Xvid 0.9.x versions were not licensed in countries where these software patents are recognized. With the 1.0.x releases, a GNU GPL v2 license is used with no explicit geographical restriction.

The last US patents expired in November 2023. The only patents left worldwide are in Brazil. The Fedora Project, a community backed by Red Hat, has imported xvidcore to its repositories on January 24, 2023.

==Sigma Designs controversy==
In July 2002, Sigma Designs released an MPEG-4 video codec called the REALmagic MPEG-4 Video Codec. Before long, people testing this new codec found that it contained considerable portions of Xvid code. Sigma Designs was contacted and confirmed that a programmer had based REALmagic on Xvid, but assured that all GPL code would be replaced to avoid copyright infringement. When Sigma Designs released the supposedly rewritten REALmagic codec, the Xvid developers immediately disassembled it and concluded that it still contained Xvid code, only rearranged in an attempt to disguise its presence. The Xvid developers decided to stop work and go public to force Sigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. After articles were published in Slashdot and The Inquirer, in August 2002 Sigma Designs agreed to publish their source code.

==Playing Xvid encoded files==

Xvid is not a video format; it is a program for compressing to and decompressing from (hence the name &quot;codec&quot;) the MPEG-4 ASP format. Since Xvid uses MPEG-4 Advanced Simple Profile (ASP) compression, video encoded with Xvid is MPEG-4 ASP video (not &quot;Xvid video&quot;), and can therefore theoretically be decoded with all ASP-compliant decoders. This includes a large number of media players and decoders based on libavcodec (such as MPlayer, VLC, ffdshow or Perian). , xvid.com carries binaries for using the codec. However, early versions of the codec had a bug that prevented XviD-encoded files from being decoded with DivX, even when they were encoded using the DivX fourcc.

Xvid encoded files can be written to a CD or DVD and played in some (but not all) DivX compatible DVD players and media players. However, Xvid can optionally encode video with advanced MPEG-4 features that most DivX Certified set-top players do not support. Files encoded with global motion compensation, Qpel, MPEG quantization, multiple B-frames or files that exceed the Video buffering verifier limitations may not play back properly on DivX Certified hardware devices.

For example, Xvid specifies three warp points for its implementation of global motion compensation as opposed to the single warp point implementation of DivX. Enabling some of the more advanced encoding features can compromise player compatibility. Some issues exist with the custom quantization matrices used in tools such as AutoGK that automate encoding with Xvid. This can (depending on the decoder chipset of the set-top player in question) produce videos that have unstable playback and artifacts. However, most recent model DivX compatible DVD players have improved support for custom quantization matrices.

<doc id="201546" wikidata="Q7874966" url="?curid=201546" title="USS Underhill">
<text>USS &quot;Underhill&quot; (DE-682) was a of the United States Navy during World War II. Built in 1943, she served in the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific until her sinking in a suicide attack by a Japanese &quot;Kaiten&quot; manned torpedo on 24 July 1945.

==Namesake==
Samuel Jackson Underhill was born on 25 August 1917 in Jericho, New York. He received a Bachelor of Science from Yale University and attended Harvard Law School before enlisting in the United States Navy Reserve as a Seaman Second Class on 8 November 1940. After serving briefly at Floyd Bennett Field, Brooklyn, New York, Underhill was appointed an aviation cadet and was transferred on 6 February 1941 to the Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, Florida, for flight training. He subsequently underwent further training at Miami, Florida; was designated a naval aviator on 15 July; and was commissioned an ensign in the Naval Reserve on 6 August. Following advanced flight training at Norfolk, Virginia, he reported to Scouting Squadron 5 (VS-5).

In May 1942, during the Battle of the Coral Sea Underhill was with VS-5 on board the carrier . When VS-5 raided Tulagi on the morning of 4 May he flew his Douglas SBD Dauntless dive-bomber against a heavy anti-aircraft barrage and contributed to the sinking or damaging of eight enemy vessels. On the morning of 7 May, a coordinated attack group of 17 SBDs from VS-5 took off from &quot;Yorktown&quot; and, in clear skies with unlimited visibility, launched a dive bombing attack on the light carrier &quot;Shōhō&quot;. The American planes scored nine direct hits and two near misses sinking the &quot;Shōhō&quot;.

On the morning of 8 May, &quot;Yorktown&quot; launched the SBDs of VS-5, dividing the group to accomplish separate missions. One division flew in the strike that ultimately attacked the Japanese carrier &quot;Shōkaku&quot;. The other, which included Underhill, remained behind to conduct anti-torpedo plane patrol around &quot;Yorktown&#x27;s&quot; formation due to the lack of fighters. At 11:10, the eight SBDs of VS-5&#x27;s anti-torpedo plane patrol were jumped by a group of six Japanese fighters from &quot;Zuikaku&quot;. The slower Dauntless dive-bombers quickly found themselves at a disadvantage against the more nimble Japanese attackers. In the ensuing dogfight, the Zeros shot down four SBDs with no loss to themselves (although the American pilots claimed four destroyed) before being driven off by US fighters. Underhill was among those lost in the dogfight. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his extraordinary valor.

== Construction and Commissioning ==
&quot;Underhill&quot;s keel was laid down on 16 September 1943 by the Bethlehem Steel Company&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard at Quincy, Massachusetts. She was launched on 15 October 1943 sponsored by Mrs. David (Bertha) Underhill, aunt and guardian of Ensign Underhill. &quot;Underhill&quot; was commissioned exactly one month later.
== Atlantic/Mediterranean service ==

After trial runs and crew training, &quot;Underhill&quot; moved to the Boston Navy Yard for provisioning and loading of ammunition. On 2 December 1943, she was underway to Bermuda for further training and shakedown, returning to Boston Navy Yard on 10 January 1944 for minor repairs. She got underway from Boston on 17 January 1944 and arrived at Guantanamo Bay on 22 January, reporting to Commander, Caribbean Sea Frontier, for duty. She operated out of Trinidad and Guantanamo escorting convoys until late in May when she escorted SS &quot;George Washington&quot; from Kingston, Jamaica, to Miami, Florida.

&quot;Underhill&quot; returned on 30 May 1944 to Boston Navy Yard, where her torpedo tubes were removed and replaced with Bofors 40 mm antiaircraft guns. Additionally two 20 mm anti-aircraft guns were added on the fantail. Her new area of operations was the Mediterranean Sea, where the Junkers Ju 88 dive bombers flying out of Southern France had been converted to torpedo planes and were taking a toll on British and French convoys.

Following training exercises in Casco Bay, Maine, &quot;Underhill&quot; got underway before dawn on Independence Day and steamed from Hampton Roads to screen UGS 47, a large, slow convoy bound for Mediterranean ports. &quot;Underhill&quot; conducted battle drills and investigated sonar contacts during the long, uneventful Atlantic voyage. In the Mediterranean Sea on 21 and 22 July, she responded to several air raid warnings, but no enemy action materialized, although the last three convoys to pass along this route had been attacked by German planes.

She escorted convoys between Bizerte, Tunisia and Oran, Algeria. After her first convoy in Bizerte, &quot;Underhill&quot; was ordered out into the Mediterranean Sea where she steamed all night at flank speed, fully illuminated in waters known to be populated with U-boats and overflown by German aircraft. The invasion of southern France was launched a few days later; it is likely &quot;Underhill&quot; cruise was a diversion or a probe. When returning to Bizerte, she struck a ship sunken in the channel and badly damaged her port propeller and shaft, which was repaired in Oran. After arriving at that port on 27 July, she underwent temporary repairs; then, on 5 August, she departed North Africa. Early on 6 August, she joined the escort of Convoy GUS 47, with which she arrived safely at New York City on 18 August. Six days later, Commander Newcomb relieved Jackson as commanding officer; he would hold the post for the rest of his life.

The next convoy, UGS 54 to Plymouth, England, in September, was uneventful until &quot;Underhill&quot; left Plymouth in October. Upon leaving the harbor, a submarine sonar contact was made in the English Channel. Several hours of depth charging accomplished nothing, but while running the patterns, the ship struck an underwater object (possibly a U-boat) destroying the ship&#x27;s sonar soundhead. &quot;Underhill&quot; drydocked at Plymouth, but the British were unable to make needed repairs, so &quot;Underhill&quot; returned to Boston with a group of tank landing ships (LSTs) for a new sound head.

She escorted Convoy UGS 60 from Boston to Mers el Kebir in November; then engaged in anti-submarine warfare exercises out of Oran with the
French submarine &quot;Doris&quot;. She departed that Algerian port on 3 December escorting GUS 60 and reached New York on 21 December. She entered the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 21 December, departing for New London, Connecticut, on 8 January 1945 for a temporary assignment with Submarine Forces, Atlantic. Operating out of New London, she served as a training and escort ship for submarines, took part in exercises in Block Island Sound and Long Island Sound; and trained intensively in anti-submarine warfare.

== Pacific service ==
In late January 1945, &quot;Underhill&quot; was assigned to the Seventh Fleet in the Philippine Islands, departing New London on 8 February 1945, rendezvousing with HMS &quot;Patroller&quot; to escort the British escort carrier to the Panama Canal Zone. &quot;Underhill&quot; then steamed via the Panama Canal, the Galapagos Islands, and Bora Bora to the Admiralty Islands and arrived at Seeadler Harbor on 15 March 1945.

Her first convoy took her to Lingayen Gulf where she remained for four days of radar picket duty. From there she went on to Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) and Biak. On 5 June 1945, &quot;Underhill&quot; left Hollandia escorting the troopship USS &quot;General M.B. Stewart&quot; (AP-140) to Leyte Gulf.

On 10 June 1945, &quot;Underhill&quot; left Leyte for Hollandia, but en route received a distress call from OA-10 #23, a Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat. &quot;Underhill&quot; and &quot;Thadeus Parker&quot; were diverted to the crash site by orders of the Commander, Philippine Sea Frontier. The destroyers and various aircraft patrolled the area until 12 June when the search was abandoned. After &quot;Parker&quot; and the aircraft had left the area, &quot;Underhill&quot;&#x27;s lookouts spotted green dye marker and a ration can floating in the water. Investigating further, into a rain squall, the lookouts found three survivors, who had been in the water about 60 hours with life jackets but no life raft. &quot;Underhill&quot; took them aboard at 07:59 and transported them to Hollandia.

&quot;Underhill&quot; escorted shipping between Manus, Bora Bora, and Palau, until she joined a large convoy of supply and troopships. She departed Leyte Gulf on 9 July and arrived at Okinawa on 14 July 1945. There, she was assigned to radar picket duty until relieved to serve as escort commander of Task Unit 99-1-18, a convoy from Buckner Bay, Okinawa back to Leyte Gulf on 21 July 1945. The convoy included one troop ship and six LSTs carrying troops of the 96th Division back to the Philippines for rest and reinforcements. The convoy escorts were patrol craft &quot;PC-1251&quot;, &quot;PC-803&quot;, &quot;PC-804&quot;, and &quot;PC-807&quot;, sub chasers &quot;SC-1306&quot; and &quot;SC-1309&quot;, and patrol craft escort &quot;PCE-872&quot;.

== &quot;Underhill&quot; sinking ==
On the morning of the third day out, 24 July 1945, about 200 to 300 miles northeast of Cape Engaño, &quot;Underhill&quot; radar detected a Japanese &quot;Dinah&quot; reconnaissance plane circling the convoy about ten miles out. Her crew immediately manned their battle stations and ordered other escorts to air defense stations. The Japanese pilot remained out of gun range, determining the convoy&#x27;s base course and relaying it to Japanese submarines in the area. After some 45 minutes, &quot;Underhill&quot; crew secured from battle stations and ordered the other escorts to resume assigned patrol stations. During this time, an SC had developed mechanical problems and had to be taken in tow by &quot;PCE-872&quot;.

Two or three Japanese submarines were in the area. After establishing the convoy&#x27;s base course, one released a dummy naval mine in the path of the convoy. When it was sighted by &quot;Underhill&quot; lookouts, the ship&#x27;s commander ordered a general course change to port. When the last ship had cleared, &quot;Underhill&quot; stood in to sink the mine. After repeated direct hits by the 20-millimeter guns and 30-calibre rifle fire, the convoy realized the mine was a diversionary tactic by the Japanese submarines.

A sonar contact made earlier had been lost during the course changes required by the mine threat, but &quot;Underhill&quot; regained contact and guided &quot;PC-804&quot; into a depth charge attack with no immediate results. A few minutes later, however, a sub was sighted on the surface in the area where &quot;PC-804&quot; had attacked. &quot;Underhill&quot; set course to ram, but the sub dived and the command was changed to drop depth charges. A 13-charge pattern was laid, explosions brought up oil and debris, and &quot;PC-804&quot; reported a kill.

&quot;Underhill&quot; reversed course and passed back through the debris. Sonar picked up another contact. The depth charges had brought to the surface two &quot;Kaiten&quot;, Japanese suicide manned torpedoes, each with a warhead equivalent to about two standard torpedoes. One was on either side of &quot;Underhill&quot;; the one to starboard was too close for any of &quot;Underhill&quot;&#x27;s guns to bear.

At 15:15, the captain ordered flank speed, a turn onto collision course, and all hands to stand by to ram. &quot;Underhill&quot; struck the &quot;Kaiten&quot; to port, and two explosions resulted, the first directly under the bridge and magazine area, the second, a few seconds later, forward of the bridge area and more to starboard. &quot;Underhill&quot; broke in half at the forward fire room. The stern section remained upright and afloat; The bow, sticking straight up, began drifting away to starboard. The explosions flung a tremendous quantity of oily water over the aft section, knocking down sailors and washing some overboard, but also dousing possible fires in that portion of the ship.

Although hampered in their rescue efforts by the necessity to pursue sound contacts and by alarms over real and imagined periscope sightings, &quot;PC-803&quot; and &quot;PC-804&quot; quickly came to the aid of survivors in the water and on the slowly sinking aft section. On board &quot;Underhill&quot;, the wounded were brought to the boat and main decks, while unhurt survivors aided the injured and attempted to control the damage.

About an hour later &quot;PC-803&quot; and &quot;PC-804&quot; had returned to rescue survivors. Hampered because of still being under attack by the midget subs, the transfer of many seriously wounded sailors to the patrol craft was difficult. &quot;PC-804&quot; was the first to reach the combat site to assist with rescue operations and hove-to off the starboard quarter of &quot;Underhill&quot;. The patrol boats and sub chasers alternated between assisting survivors and attacking submarine contacts.

After the last known survivors were rescued, a firing line was formed by &quot;PC-803&quot;, &quot;PC-804&quot;, and &quot;PCE-872&quot;. The fragments of &quot;Underhill&quot; were sunk by three-inch (76.2 mm) and 40 mm gunfire at 19:17. Loss Location reported at 19°20&#x27;N, 126°42&#x27;E.

The remainder of 24 July was spent rejoining the convoy. Some survivors were transferred to &quot;LST 768&quot; and the balance to &quot;LST 739&quot; which had on board Commander LST Group 46 who among the command was the only Medical Doctor in the convoy at about 03:00 on 25 July. Task Unit 99-1-18 proceeded to its destination of Leyte Gulf.

=== Aftermath ===
A total of 112 crew members of &quot;Underhill&quot; perished in the explosion, while 122 survived. Ten of the fourteen officers were lost, including the commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Newcomb. Every crewman was awarded the Purple Heart, and Newcomb also received the Silver Star. Chief Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Stanley Dace was posthumously awarded the bronze star with combat &quot;V&quot; and citation of merit in August 1998. One other shipmate, Pharmacist&#x27;s Mate Third class Joseph Manory, was awarded the Navy and Marine Commendation Medal with Combat &quot;V&quot; in 1998.

Just six days after the sinking of the &quot;Underhill&quot;, the heavy cruiser &quot;Indianapolis&quot; was attacked and sunk in the area by a Japanese submarine. The historical film &quot;USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage&quot; (2016), dramatizing the incident, also includes a mention of the &quot;Underhill&quot; and of how it did not affect the order to not give the &quot;Indianapolis&quot; a sonar and an escort.

USS &quot;Underhill&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 September 1945.

<text>Romy and Michele&#x27;s High School Reunion is a 1997 American comedy film directed by David Mirkin and starring Mira Sorvino, Lisa Kudrow, and Janeane Garofalo. The plot revolves around two 28-year-old women who appear to have not achieved much success in life, and decide to invent fake careers to impress former classmates at their ten-year high school reunion. The characters are taken from the stage play &quot;Ladies Room&quot;, which also featured Kudrow.

The film received positive reviews from critics and is considered a cult classic.

==Plot==
As high school students in Tucson, Arizona in 1987, Romy White and Michele Weinberger are continually bullied by the &quot;A-Group,&quot; a small group of popular, yet mean, girls, led by cheerleader Christie Masters, who humiliate them repeatedly. Romy also has a crush on Christie’s boyfriend, athlete Billy Christianson. Their classmate Heather Mooney is in love with a geek named Sandy Frink, but Sandy has a crush on Michele. Finally, at the prom, Romy asks Billy to dance with her. He agrees, but he and Christie trick the girls into thinking he has dumped Christie to be with Romy. Romy waits all night to dance with him, but he has already left with Christie. Michele dances with Romy instead.

Ten years later, Romy and Michele live together in an apartment in Los Angeles, California. Romy works as a cashier in the service department at a Jaguar dealership and Michele is unemployed. They are single, unambitious, and enjoy a casual lifestyle consisting mostly of dancing at nightclubs. At work, Romy encounters Heather, who is now a successful businesswoman. Heather informs her about their upcoming ten-year high school reunion.

Romy realizes that their lack of achievements will not make a good impression at the reunion. Failing at their last-ditch attempts to improve themselves, they decide to fake success by showing up in an expensive car and business suits. Romy borrows a Jaguar from a co-worker, and Michele makes their outfits. En route to the reunion, they decide to claim that they invented the Post-it note, believing that no one will know better. An argument over the details of their lie escalates into a fight about their friendship, and they decide to part ways once they reach the reunion.

When they arrive at the reunion, Romy leaves Michele asleep in the car, and Michele dreams that she and Romy each separately claim to reunion attendees to have invented Post-its without the help of the other. She begins a romance with Sandy, who is now wealthy and attractive, and Romy gets together with Billy. The two refuse to speak to each other for decades until Romy is on her deathbed; Michele calls her to make amends, but they rehash old arguments and the dream ends with Romy&#x27;s death.

Michele wakes up and enters the real reunion. The A-group are all pregnant, and Christie is married to Billy and has two children already. Romy starts to tell the Post-it story, but Heather arrives and unintentionally reveals the lie by telling everyone the real inventor&#x27;s name. Christie and her friends taunt Romy, who runs out of the room. Michele comforts her and the pair reconcile, deciding to be themselves instead of trying to impress others. They change into brightly colored homemade outfits and return to the reunion.

Christie makes fun of their clothes, but Lisa Luder, a former A-group girl who is now a fashion editor for &quot;Vogue,&quot; approves of the outfits; Lisa coolly dismisses Christie&#x27;s objections and the rest of the A-group women abandon her.

Sandy, now wealthy and successful, arrives via helicopter. He confesses that he still loves Michele and asks her to dance with him. Michele agrees, as long as Romy can dance with them. Their dance receives huge applause, and Sandy escorts them to his helicopter. On their way out, they encounter Billy, who is unhappy in his marriage to Christie and boorishly hits on Romy. As turnabout for the trick he and Christie played on her at prom, she convinces him to return to his hotel room to wait for her, but instead leaves the reunion with Michele and Sandy in the latter&#x27;s helicopter.

Six months later, back in Los Angeles, Romy and Michele have opened a successful fashion boutique with their homemade designs using money borrowed from Sandy.

=== Development ===
The Romy and Michele characters first appeared in the 1988 stage play &quot;Ladies Room&quot;, which was written by Robin Schiff. Schiff was in the comedy troupe The Groundlings with Lisa Kudrow, who starred in the play as Michele opposite Christie Mellor as Romy. Schiff said her inspiration for the characters of Romy and Michele “were loosely based, just visually, on these girls I used to see going into a club on Sunset Blvd. You&#x27;d see these two friends, and they looked like they got dressed together and were wearing different versions of the same thing.&quot;

&quot;Ladies Room&quot; was then adapted into a sitcom pilot called &quot;Just Temporary,&quot; with Kudrow and Mellor reprising their roles, but the pilot was not picked up. Around this time, film executives at the Disney subsidiary Touchstone came across Schiff&#x27;s play while &quot;looking for a ‘female version of &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&#x27;.&quot;&quot; Schiff was initially reluctant to adapt the play into a film, thinking some scenes would not transfer well to a movie. After Schiff pondered about what it might be like if Romy and Michele were invited to their high school reunion (&quot;…And it wasn&#x27;t until they fill out the questionnaire when they realize their lives hadn&#x27;t amounted to anything. That seemed funny to me.&quot;) Schiff began work on the script, which she would spend the next five years developing. Schiff based the characters&#x27; friendship partly on her relationship with her best friend. “One day we were stuck on a plane on a tarmac, and started reading the &quot;Sky Mall&quot; catalog and laughing our asses off. That was the kind of friend you want to hang out with—that even stuck on a plane on the tarmac you can still have fun.&quot;

=== Casting ===
Kudrow&#x27;s rising stardom from the show &quot;Friends&quot; played a part in the film successfully getting through the development stage. Toni Collette was a strong contender for the role of Romy and met with director David Mirkin. The studio offered the role to Mira Sorvino, who at that point was about to win a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for the film &quot;Mighty Aphrodite&quot;. Said Mirkin, “It was definitely a long shot, but I heard she wanted to meet so we had lunch, and I instantly knew that she could do it. Romy and Michele were conceived as one tall and one short, but I loved the idea of Lisa and Mira playing this idiot blonde power couple.”

=== Filming ===
Filming took place between April and June 1996 in Los Angeles. Exterior shots of Romy and Michele&#x27;s fictional Sagebrush High School were filmed in Santa Clarita. $240,000 of the film&#x27;s $20 million budget was spent on securing the licensing rights for the song “Time After Time” by Cyndi Lauper. Mona May, who served as the costume designer for &quot;Clueless&quot;, provided the film&#x27;s outfits.

Touchstone initially found David Mirkin&#x27;s final cut of the film to be too quirky and wanted to sweeten the tone, but Mirkin insisted on keeping the edgier tone.

==Release==
=== Box office ===
The film opened at number two in the North American box office, making $7.4 million in its opening weekend, finishing behind &quot;Volcano&quot;. It grossed a total of $29 million in North America. In the United States, it was released the same month as &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot;, another 1980s-themed high school reunion film that Disney was involved with.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 75% based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 6.30/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Romy and Michele&#x27;s High School Reunion&quot; has an admittedly slight premise, but it&#x27;s elevated by ample heart, an infectiously playful spirit, and the buoyant chemistry of Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, declaring, &quot;&quot;Romy and Michele&#x27;s High School Reunion&quot;, written by Robin Schiff (based on her play) and directed by David Mirkin, is one of the brightest and goofiest comedies in a while, a film that has a share of truth, but isn&#x27;t afraid to cut loose with the weirdest choreography I have seen outside a 1960s revival.”

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote the “candy-colored &quot;&#x27;Romy and Michele&#x27;s High School Reunion&quot;’ [is] cheerful, giddy fun” and praised the two female leads, saying “Ms. Kudrow and Ms. Sorvino make a fine team, elevating bubble-headedness to new levels of comic ingenuity.” Jack Mathews of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said &quot;beneath the endless silliness of the movie beats a real heart, and its theme of loyal friendship keeps propping it up every time the thin walls of the story seem about to collapse.” Mathews also praised &quot;the dead-pan performances of Sorvino and Kudrow...Romy and Michelle are cartoon characters, but the actresses make them both real and enormously sympathetic.&quot;

=== Accolades ===

The film was nominated for a Satellite Award and an MTV Movie Award.
== Home media ==
&quot;Romy and Michele&#x27;s High School Reunion&quot; was released on DVD on August 24, 1999. It was also reissued as a special edition Blu-ray for the film&#x27;s 15th anniversary in 2012.

==Legacy==
Though a modest success at the box office, the film steadily gained a cult following through home video and repeat cable TV airings since release.

In 2005, &quot;Romy and Michele: In the Beginning&quot;, a prequel television film written and directed by Schiff, premiered on ABC Family. Katherine Heigl plays Romy and Alexandra Breckenridge as Michele.

A musical adaptation premiered at the 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle, Washington in June 2017. The musical, directed by Kristin Hanggi (Broadway&#x27;s &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;) stars Cortney Wolfson and Stephanie Renee as Romy and Michele, respectively. &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; and &quot;Weeds&quot; composers Gwendolyn Sanford and Brandon Jay wrote the music and lyrics to original songs, including &quot;Business Woman Special&quot;, &quot;10 Years&quot;, &quot;I Invented Post-Its&quot; and &quot;Changing Lives One Outfit at a Time&quot;.

In 2022, Kudrow and Sorvino appeared as their characters to present the award for the 2022 Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble - Comedy Series. In 2024, Sorvino stated she and Kudrow were finalizing deals for a sequel, with writer Schiff returning.

<text>The ancient Egyptian calendar – a civil calendar – was a solar calendar with a 365-day year. The year consisted of three seasons of 120 days each, plus an intercalary month of five epagomenal days treated as outside of the year proper. Each season was divided into four months of 30 days. These twelve months were initially numbered within each season but came to also be known by the names of their principal festivals. Each month was divided into three 10-day periods known as decans or decades. It has been suggested that during the Nineteenth Dynasty and the Twentieth Dynasty the last two days of each decan were usually treated as a kind of weekend for the royal craftsmen, with royal artisans free from work.

Because this calendrical year was nearly a quarter of a day shorter than the solar year, the Egyptian calendar lost about one day every four years relative to the Gregorian calendar. It is therefore sometimes referred to as the (), as its months rotated about one day through the solar year every four years. &#x27;s Canopus Decree attempted to correct this through the introduction of a sixth epagomenal day every four years but the proposal was resisted by the Egyptian priests and people and abandoned until the establishment of the Alexandrian or Coptic calendar by Augustus. The introduction of a leap day to the Egyptian calendar made it equivalent to the reformed Julian calendar, although by extension it continues to diverge from the Gregorian calendar at the turn of most centuries.

This ran concurrently with an which was used for some religious rituals and festivals. Some Egyptologists have described it as lunisolar, with an intercalary month supposedly added every two or three years to maintain its consistency with the solar year, but no evidence of such intercalation before the has yet been discovered.

==History==
===Prehistory===
Current understanding of the earliest development of the Egyptian calendar remains speculative. A tablet from the reign of the First Dynasty pharaoh Djer (BC) was once thought to indicate that the Egyptians had already established a link between the heliacal rising of Sirius ( or &quot;Sopdet&quot;, &quot;Triangle&quot;; , &quot;Sôthis&quot;) and the beginning of their year, but more recent analysis has questioned whether the tablet&#x27;s picture refers to Sirius at all. Similarly, based on the Palermo Stone, Alexander Scharff proposed that the Old Kingdom observed a 320-day year, but his theory has not been widely accepted. Some evidence suggests the early civil calendar had 360 days, although it might merely reflect the unusual status of the five epagomenal days as days &quot;added on&quot; to the proper year.

With its interior effectively rainless for thousands of years, ancient Egypt was &quot;a gift of the river&quot; Nile, whose annual flooding organized the natural year into three broad natural seasons known to the Egyptians as:

#Inundation or Flood (, sometimes anglicized as &quot;Akhet&quot;): roughly from September to January. 
#Emergence or Winter (&quot;&quot;, sometimes anglicized as &quot;Peret&quot;): roughly from January to May.
#Low Water or Harvest or Summer (&quot;&quot;, sometimes anglicized as &quot;Shemu&quot;): roughly from May to September.

As early as the reign of Djer (BC, Dynasty I), yearly records were being kept of the flood&#x27;s high-water mark. Otto E. Neugebauer noted that a 365-day year can be established by averaging a few decades of accurate observations of the Nile flood without any need for astronomical observations, although the great irregularity of the flood from year to year and the difficulty of maintaining a sufficiently accurate Nilometer and record in prehistoric Egypt has caused other scholars to doubt that it formed the basis for the Egyptian calendar.&lt;br&gt;
Note that the names of the three natural seasons were incorporated into the Civil calendar year (see below), but as this calendar year is a , the seasons of this calendar slowly rotate through the natural solar year, meaning that Civil season Akhet/Inundation only occasionally coincided with the Nile inundation.

===Lunar calendar===

The Egyptians appear to have used a purely lunar calendar prior to the establishment of the solar civil calendar in which each month began on the morning when the waning crescent moon could no longer be seen. Until the closing of Egypt&#x27;s polytheist temples under the Byzantines, the lunar calendar continued to be used as the liturgical year of various cults. The lunar calendar divided the month into four weeks, reflecting each quarter of the lunar phases. Because the exact time of morning considered to begin the Egyptian day remains uncertain and there is no evidence that any method other than observation was used to determine the beginnings of the lunar months prior to the there is no sure way to reconstruct exact dates in the lunar calendar from its known dates. The difference between beginning the day at the first light of dawn or at sunrise accounts for an 11–14 year shift in dated observations of the lunar cycle. It remains unknown how the Egyptians dealt with obscurement by clouds when they occurred and the best current algorithms have been shown to differ from actual observation of the waning crescent moon in about one-in-five cases.

Parker and others have argued for its development into an observational and then calculated lunisolar calendar which used a 30 day intercalary month every two to three years to accommodate the lunar year&#x27;s loss of about 11 days a year relative to the solar year and to maintain the placement of the heliacal rising of Sirius within its twelfth month. No evidence for such a month, however, exists in the present historical record.
A second lunar calendar is attested by a demotic astronomical papyrus dating to sometime after 144 AD which outlines a lunisolar calendar operating in accordance with the Egyptian civil calendar according to a 25 year cycle. The calendar seems to show its month beginning with the first visibility of the waxing crescent moon, but Parker displayed an error in the cycle of about a day in 500 years, using it to show the cycle was developed to correspond with the new moon around 357BC. This date places it prior to the Ptolemaic period and within the native Egyptian Dynasty XXX. Egypt&#x27;s 1st Persian occupation, however, seems likely to have been its inspiration. This lunisolar calendar&#x27;s calculations apparently continued to be used without correction into the Roman period, even when they no longer precisely matched the observable lunar phases.

The days of the lunar month — known to the Egyptians as a &quot;temple month&quot; — were individually named and celebrated as stages in the life of the moon god, variously Thoth in the Middle Kingdom or Khonsu in the Ptolemaic era: &quot;He ... is conceived ... on &quot;Psḏntyw&quot;; he is born on &quot;Ꜣbd&quot;; he grows old after &quot;Smdt&quot;&quot;.

===Civil calendar===


The civil calendar was established at some early date in or before the Old Kingdom, with probable evidence of its use early in the reign of Shepseskaf (BC, Dynasty IV) and certain attestation during the reign of Neferirkare (mid-25th centuryBC, Dynasty V). It was probably based upon astronomical observations of Sirius whose reappearance in the sky closely corresponded to the average onset of the Nile flood through the 5th and A recent development is the discovery that the 30-day month of the Mesopotamian calendar dates as late as the Jemdet Nasr Period (late 4th-millenniumBC), a time Egyptian culture was borrowing various objects and cultural features from the Fertile Crescent, leaving open the possibility that the main features of the calendar were borrowed in one direction or the other as well.

The civil year comprised exactly 365 days, divided into 12 months of 30 days each and an intercalary month of five days, which were celebrated as the birthdays of the gods Osiris, Horus, Set, Isis, and Nephthys. The regular months were grouped into Egypt&#x27;s three seasons, which gave them their original names, and divided into three 10-day periods known as decans or decades. In later sources, these were distinguished as &quot;first&quot;, &quot;middle&quot;, and &quot;last&quot;. It has been suggested that during the Nineteenth Dynasty and the Twentieth Dynasty the last two days of each decan were usually treated as a kind of weekend for the royal craftsmen, with royal artisans free from work. Dates were typically expressed in a YMD format, with a pharaoh&#x27;s regnal year followed by the month followed by the day of the month. For example, the New Year occurred on 
The importance of the calendar to Egyptian religion is reflected in the use of the title &quot;Lord of Years&quot; (&quot;&quot;) for its various creator gods. Time was also considered an integral aspect of Maat, the cosmic order which opposed chaos, lies, and violence.

The civil calendar was apparently established in a year when Sirius rose on its New Year but, because of its lack of leap years, it began to slowly cycle backwards through the solar year. Sirius itself, about 40° below the ecliptic, follows a Sothic year almost exactly matching that of the Sun, with its reappearance now occurring at the latitude of Cairo (ancient Heliopolis and Memphis) on 19July (Julian), only two or three days later than its occurrence in early antiquity.

Following Censorinus and Meyer, the standard understanding was that, four years from the calendar&#x27;s inception, Sirius would have no longer reappeared on the Egyptian New Year but on the next day ; four years later, it would have reappeared on the day after that; and so on through the entire calendar until its rise finally returned to 1460 years after the calendar&#x27;s inception, an event known as &quot;apocatastasis&quot;. Owing to the event&#x27;s extreme regularity, Egyptian recordings of the calendrical date of the rise of Sirius have been used by Egyptologists to fix its calendar and other events dated to it, at least to the level of the four-Egyptian-year periods which share the same date for Sirius&#x27;s return, known as &quot;tetraëterides&quot; or &quot;quadrennia&quot;. For example, an account that Sothis rose on —the 181st day of the year—should show that somewhere 720, 721, 722, or 723 years have passed since the last apocatastasis. Following such a scheme, the record of Sirius rising on in 239BC implies apocatastases on 1319 and 2779BC ±3 years. Censorinus&#x27;s placement of an apocatastasis on 21July AD139 permitted the calculation of its predecessors to 1322, 2782, and 4242BC. The last is sometimes described as &quot;the first exactly dated year in history&quot; but, since the calendar is attested before Dynasty XVIII and the last date is now known to far predate early Egyptian civilization, it is typically credited to Dynasty II around the middle date.

The classic understanding of the Sothic cycle relies, however, on several potentially erroneous assumptions. Following Scaliger, Censorinus&#x27;s date is usually emended to 20July but ancient authorities give a variety of &#x27;fixed&#x27; dates for the rise of Sirius. His use of the year 139 seems questionable, as 136 seems to have been the start of the tetraëteris and the later date chosen to flatter the birthday of Censorinus&#x27;s patron. Perfect observation of Sirius&#x27;s actual behavior during the cycle—including its minor shift relative to the solar year—would produce a period of 1457 years; observational difficulties produce a further margin of error of about two decades. Although it is certain the Egyptian day began in the morning, another four years are shifted depending on whether the precise start occurred at the first light of dawn or at sunrise. It has been noted that there is no recognition in surviving records that Sirius&#x27;s minor irregularities sometimes produce a triëteris or penteteris (three- or five-year periods of agreement with an Egyptian date) rather than the usual four-year periods and, given that the expected discrepancy is no more than 8 years in 1460, the cycle may have been applied schematically according to the civil years by Egyptians and the Julian year by the Greeks and Romans. The occurrence of the apocatastasis in the so close to the great political and sun-based religious reforms of /Akhenaton also leaves open the possibility that the cycle&#x27;s strict application was occasionally subject to political interference. The record and celebration of Sirius&#x27;s rising would also vary by several days (equating to decades of the cycle) in eras when the official site of observation was moved from near Cairo. The return of Sirius to the night sky varies by about a day per degree of latitude, causing it to be seen 8–10 days earlier at Aswan than at Alexandria, a difference which causes Rolf Krauss to propose dating much of Egyptian history decades later than the present consensus.

===Ptolemaic calendar===
Following Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest of the Persian Empire, the Macedonian Ptolemaic Dynasty came to power in Egypt, continuing to use its native calendars with Hellenized names. In 238 BC, Ptolemy III&#x27;s Canopus Decree ordered that every 4th year should incorporate a sixth day in its intercalary month, honoring him and his wife as gods equivalent to the children of Nut. The reform was resisted by the Egyptian priests and people and was abandoned.

===Coptic calendar===

Egyptian scholars were involved with the establishment of Julius Caesar&#x27;s reform of the Roman calendar, although the Roman priests initially misapplied its formula and—by counting inclusively—added leap days every three years instead of every four. The mistake was corrected by Augustus through omitting leap years for a number of cycles until AD4. As the personal ruler of Egypt, he also imposed a reform of its calendar in 26 or 25BC, possibly to correspond with the beginning of a new Callipic cycle, with the first leap day occurring on 6 Epag. in the year 22BC. This &quot;Alexandrian calendar&quot; corresponds almost exactly to the Julian, causing 1Thoth to remain at 29August except during the year before a Julian leap year, when it occurs on 30August instead. The calendars then resume their correspondence after 4Phamenoth/ 29February of the next year.

==Months==
For much of Egyptian history, the months were not referred to by individual names, but were rather numbered within the three seasons. As early as the Middle Kingdom, however, each month had its own name. These finally evolved into the New Kingdom months, which in turn gave rise to the Hellenized names that were used for chronology by Ptolemy in his Almagest and by others. Copernicus constructed his tables for the motion of the planets based on the Egyptian year because of its mathematical regularity. A convention of modern Egyptologists is to number the months consecutively using Roman numerals.

A persistent problem of Egyptology has been that the festivals which give their names to the months occur in the next month. Alan Gardiner proposed that an original calendar governed by the priests of Ra was supplanted by an improvement developed by the partisans of Thoth. Parker connected the discrepancy to his theories concerning the lunar calendar. Sethe, Weill, and Clagett proposed that the names expressed the idea that each month culminated in the festival beginning the next.

== Lucky and unlucky days ==
Calendars that have survived from ancient Egypt often characterise the days as either lucky or unlucky. Of the calendars recovered, the Cairo calendar is one of the best examples. Discovered in modern-day Thebes, it dates from the Ramesside Period and acts as a guide to which days were considered lucky or unlucky. Other complete calendars include Papyrus Sallier IV, and the Calendar of Lucky and Unlucky Days (on the back of the Teaching of Amenemope). The earliest calendars appear in the Middle Kingdom, but they do not become codified until the New Kingdom. It is unknown how staunchly these calendars were adhered to, as there are no references to decisions being made based on their horoscopes. Nevertheless, the different copies of the calendars are remarkably consistent with each other, with only 9.2% of the determinations of adversity or fortuitousness being due to a defined textual reason.

=== Scientific Basis ===
The Calendars of Lucky and Unlucky Days seem to be based on scientific observation as well as myths. Periodicity has been established between phases of the moon as well as the brightening and dimming of the three-star system Algol as visible from earth.

=== Predictions ===
The calendars could also be used to predict someone&#x27;s future depending on the day they were born. This could also be used to predict when or how they would die. For example, people born on the tenth day of the fourth month of Akhet were predicted to die of old age.

=== Epagomenal days ===
The epagomenal days were added to the original 360 day calendar in order to synchronise the calendar with the approximate length of the solar year. Mythologically, these days allowed for the births of five children of Geb and Nut to occur and were considered to be particularly dangerous. In particular, the day Seth was supposed to be born was considered particularly evil.

==Legacy==
The reformed Egyptian calendar continues to be used in Egypt as the Coptic calendar of the Egyptian Church and by the Egyptian populace at large, particularly the fellah, to calculate the agricultural seasons. It differs only in its era, which is dated from the ascension of the Roman emperor Diocletian. Contemporary Egyptian farmers, like their ancient predecessors, divide the year into three seasons: winter, summer, and inundation.

The Ethiopian calendar is based on this reformed calendar but uses Amharic names for its months and uses a different era. The French Republican Calendar was similar, but began its year at the autumnal equinox. British orrery maker John Gleave represented the Egyptian calendar in a reconstruction of the Antikythera mechanism.

<text>Pedinellales (ICN) or Pedinellida (ICZN) is a group of single-celled algae found in both marine environments and freshwater.

These are found in both freshwater and marine environments, and most genera are sessile, attached by posterior stalks. The flagellum is at the anterior of the cell, and the tentacles surround it, often capturing small prey drawn in by its current. The colored genera are &quot;Pedinella&quot;, &quot;Apedinella&quot;, &quot;Pseudopedinella&quot;, and &quot;Mesopedinella&quot;. Several more genera have lost their chloroplasts and feed entirely by phagocytosis. These are &quot;Parapedinella&quot;, &quot;Actinomonas&quot;, and &quot;Pteridomonas&quot;.

It also appears that certain heliozoa are actually derived pedinellids. &quot;Ciliophrys&quot; alternates between a mobile flagellate stage and a heliozoan feeding stage, where the body is contracted with extended axopods all over its surface, and the flagellum is curled up into a tight figure eight. The actinophryids, &quot;Actinophrys&quot; and &quot;Actinosphaerium&quot;, exist only in a heliozoan form with no flagellum and with more elaborate bundles of microtubules supporting their axopods. Their inclusion was argued by Mikrjukov and Patterson, who coined the term actinodine to refer specifically to this extended group.

Pedinellids were classified as heliozoans by some authors. The colored pedinellids were originally treated as a family of golden algae in the order Ochromonadales, promoted to an order Pedinellales by Zimmerman in 1984. Their relationship to the silicoflagellates became apparent some time later, and Patterson defined this rankless group for the two in 1994. Moestrup treated it as the class Dictyochophyceae, previously restricted to the silicoflagellates, while Cavalier-Smith defined a new class Actinochrysophyceae for them.

==Systematics==

=== Taxonomic history ===

Pedinellids have been known since the 19th century, but were classified as either algae or heliozoan protozoa due to the absence of chloroplasts in some species. Before the taxonomic revisions that took place in the late 20th century, pedinellids were treated as a single family Pedinellaceae, described in 1910 by Pascher. Some authors classified pedinellids within the order Ochromonadales, together with a variety of unrelated heterokonts such as Synuraceae and Bicosoecaceae, as part of the class Chrysophyceae or golden algae. In 1985, phycologists Birthe Zimmermann, Øjvind Moestrup and Guy Hällfors classified them as an independent order, Pedinellales. The same year, John J. Lee and coauthors segregated the phagotrophic (i.e. without chloroplasts) pedinellids as a different order Ciliophryida under the polyphyletic class Heliozoea. Other authors, such as Thomas Cavalier-Smith, went a step further and proposed treating pedinellids as a separate class, under the name of Pedinellea (spelt Pedinellophyceae under botanical nomenclature).

In 1995, Charles J. O&#x27;Kelly and Daniel E. Wujek classified the Dictyochophyceae in three orders: Rhizochromulinales (containing the sole genus &quot;Rhizochromulina&quot;), Pedinellales (containing all pedinellids) and Dictyochales (silicoflagellates), separating them from golden algae. Simultaneously, Cavalier-Smith proposed a slightly different classification where he created a new class Actinochrysea to embrace these three groups, avoiding the usage of Dictyochophyceae as a name. He considered pedinellids as subclass Pedinellidae, with two orders: Pedinellales (with chloroplasts), containing the families Pedinellaceae and Apedinellaceae; and Ciliophryales (without chloroplasts), containing Actinomonadaceae and Ciliophryaceae. The remaining two groups, Rhizochromulinales and Dictyochales, were transferred to a separate subclass Dictyochidae. The next year, Cavalier-Smith and Ema E. Chao recognized that the chloroplast losses were polyphyletic, and the family Actinomonadaceae was transferred to Pedinellales on the basis of a molecular phylogenetic analysis.

In 2006, Cavalier-Smith once again rearranged the classification. He lowered Actinochrysea to a subclass Actinochrysia within a new class Hypogyristea, which also included pelagophytes as subclass Pelagophycia. He lumped together all pedinellid genera in the family Actinomonadaceae and new suborder Actinomonadineae, with the exception of &quot;Ciliophrys&quot;, which he included with the non-pedinellid &quot;Rhizochromulina&quot; in two families of a new suborder Ciliophryineae. He maintained this classification in later years. In 2018, he finally recognized class Dictyochophyceae, and created the subclass Pedinellia or Pedinellophycidae (equivalent to his earlier Actinochrysea/Actinochrysia) to lump together pedinellids and silicoflagellates. Pelagophytes remained under the subclass Pelagophycidae, and two genera of more uncertain placement under a third subclass Sulcophycidae: &quot;Olisthodiscus&quot; and &quot;Sulcochrysis&quot;.

Cavalier-Smith&#x27;s taxonomic scheme is not accepted by the scientific community. Instead, Moestrup&#x27;s 1995 classification is more commonly supported, where pedinellids are all contained in the order Pedinellales, rendering Ciliophryales a junior synonym. They are considered part of Dictyochophyceae, along with orders Dictyochales (silicoflagellates), Rhizochromulinales (&quot;Rhizochromulina&quot;), and a more recent fourth order Florenciellales. In addition, pelagophytes are rejected as members of Dictyochophyceae, and instead form an independent class Pelagophyceae. Within pedinellids, there have been several attempts to establish different families according to morphological data such as the presence or absence of stalks and chloroplasts. However, molecular analyses do not support these internal divisions. Consequently, all pedinellids have been grouped into a single family, Actinomonadaceae, which has taxonomic preference due to being the earliest described, and all other proposed families (Pedinellaceae, Apedinellaceae, etc.) have become junior synonyms.

<text>Mare Ingenii (Latin &quot;ingeniī&quot;, the &quot;Sea of Cleverness&quot;) is one of the few lunar mare features on the far side of the Moon. The mare sits in the Ingenii basin, which is of the Pre-Nectarian epoch, which lies in turn in the outer part of the older and much larger South Pole–Aitken basin. The mare material located in Ingenii and the surrounding craters is of the Upper Imbrian epoch. The dark circular feature which dominates this mare is the crater Thomson (112 km diameter), with the overflow from Ingenii/Thomson directly to the east. Mare Ingenii is incompletely and thinly covered over much of its expanse with mare lava sheets. The light grey crater to the south of Mare Ingenii is Obruchev.

The mare has swirling patterns of bright material, similar to Reiner Gamma and to patterns within Mare Marginis, which are not associated with topographic or volcanic features. The lunar swirls are believed to be associated with magnetic fields.

Prior to formal naming in 1961 by the IAU, the crater was known as &quot;Basin XIV&quot;.

Mare Ingenii is located at the antipode of the Mare Imbrium impact basin. The furrowed crater walls of the basin (and possibly those of Van de Graaff crater) may have been caused by focused seismic waves resulting from the Imbrium impact.

The mare contains the second instance of a lunar pit discovered on the Moon and one of several outside the Earth to date.

<text>Mare Anguis (Latin &quot;anguis&quot;, the &quot;serpent sea&quot;) is a lunar mare located on the near side of the Moon, about 150 kilometers in diameter. Located within the Crisium basin, Mare Anguis is a part of the Nectarian System, meaning that it was formed during the Nectarian time period. Like most mare, the surface of Mare Anguis is dark, indicating that it has been filled with volcanic basalt. It forms part of a concentric ring to the northeast of the Crisium rim, and it lies at an elevation 800 m above Mare Crisium. Channels lead down from Mare Anguis to Mare Chrisium, with some possible indications of lava flow.

The small, 7–km diameter crater Eimmart A lies at the east edge of Mare Anguis. It is a proposed source for the Antarctic meteorite ALHA81005. The impact appears to have excavated mare basalt, which probably accounts for the olivine/low-Ca pyroxene mixture found in the spectrum.

<doc id="201568" wikidata="Q1395322" url="?curid=201568" title="HMS Macedonian">
<text>HMS &quot;Macedonian&quot; was a 38-gun fifth-rate in the Royal Navy, later captured by the during the War of 1812.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Macedonian&quot; was built at Woolwich Dockyard, England in 1809, launched 2 June 1810, and commissioned the same month. She was commanded by Captain Lord William FitzRoy. Among the original crew was the 13-year-old Samuel Leech, who later wrote a memoir of his experiences.

==As HMS &quot;Macedonian&quot;==
&quot;Macedonian&quot; first delivered a company of soldiers to Lisbon, Portugal, then remained in the area, guarding against the possibility of French naval attack. On 20 February 1811, she collided with &quot;Ives&quot; – a British merchant ship bound from Demerara on the north coast of South America to Greenock, Scotland – in the Atlantic Ocean off Lisbon, and &quot;Ives&quot; was so severely damaged that she was set afire and &quot;Macedonian&quot; took her crew aboard. While &quot;Macedonian&quot; operated off Portugal, FitzRoy made personal profit by falsification of records of ships&#x27; stores, for which he was court-martialled in March 1811 and dismissed from the service. (He was quietly reinstated in August 1811, presumably due to his aristocratic rank).

FitzRoy&#x27;s replacement, William Waldegrave, was an interim appointment whose command lasted for only a few weeks before he was himself replaced by John Surnam Carden. One of Carden&#x27;s first actions was to hire a band, a move popular with the crew, but he did not get along with the first lieutenant David Hope.

In January 1812, &quot;Macedonian&quot; was ordered to secretly deliver some bills of exchange to Norfolk, Virginia, and to bring back an equivalent quantity of gold and silver currency, as part of a scheme to keep the Bank of England solvent. During the visit, Carden socialised with the notables of Norfolk, including Captain Stephen Decatur, but bungled the mission by inadvertently revealing what was planned, and had to return to Lisbon empty handed. Captain Carden dined frequently with Decatur and his wife Susan and jokingly bet a beaver hat on the outcome of a battle of their ships. They had come to consider one another friends.

In September 1812, &quot;Macedonian&quot; was ordered to accompany an East Indiaman as far as Madeira, then to cruise in search of prizes as long as his supplies permitted.

=== Loss to USS &quot;United States&quot;===

&quot;Macedonian&quot; left Madeira on 22 October 1812, but only a few days later, on the morning of 25 October, encountered , commanded by Carden&#x27;s former dinner host Decatur. The United States had just declared war on the United Kingdom, and both captains were eager to achieve personal glory in a fight.

Unfortunately for &quot;Macedonian&quot;, &quot;United States&quot; was a 44-gun heavy frigate, and her broadside was of metal, versus &quot;Macedonian&quot;″s . USS &quot;United States&quot; hove round, turning downwind and making HMS &quot;Macedonian&quot; chase her. Within a few minutes of closing, fire from &quot;United States&quot;″s 24-pounder cannons brought down all three of &quot;Macedonian&quot;″s masts, and riddled the hull. &quot;United States&quot; then pulled away temporarily, leaving Carden and Hope time to contemplate their lack of options. Finally, with &quot;United States&quot; preparing to rake the British vessel again, Carden struck his colors, making &quot;Macedonian&quot; the second Royal Navy vessel to surrender to the Americans during the war.

==As USS &quot;Macedonian&quot;==
Decatur was careful to preserve &quot;Macedonian&quot;, sending over a detail to help repair her. This took a full two weeks. Decatur then brought the captured ship into Newport, Rhode Island, as a prize on 4 December 1812, causing an immediate national sensation. had previously beaten , but &quot;Guerriere&quot; had been too badly damaged to save. &quot;Macedonian&quot; was a sizable and welcome addition to the then tiny US Navy.

&quot;Macedonian&quot; was immediately taken into the United States Navy, retaining the name as &quot;Macedonian&quot; under the command of Captain Jacob Jones.

Early in May after receiving needed repairs &quot;Macedonian&quot;, along with &quot;United States&quot; and the sloop hoped to make their way to sea from the anchorage of Staten Island by way of Sandy Hook but were unable because of the British Blockade. Two ships of the line and three frigates were guarding that passage. Decatur, determined, took his squadron and crossing New York harbor made his way up the East River by way of Hell Gate, New York, 24 May 1813. While sailing along Long Island Sound on the night of 24 May the flagship &quot;United States&quot; was struck by lightning, causing damage to the main mast, which came crashing down and caused serious damage to the vessel. &quot;Macedonian&quot;, being close by, immediately distanced herself from the periled &quot;United States&quot;. After hasty repairs the fleet continued on their way eastward along the Sound. Because of unfavorable winds and a passage not favorable to heavy vessels, the fleet finally reached Montauk Point, the easternmost point of Long Island. The open sea was now before them but the British had blockading vessels there lying in wait. Outmatched, the fleet had no alternative but to turn back, making their way to the Thames River, where &quot;Macedonian&quot; and the rest of the fleet remained until the end of the war.

On 20 May 1815 she departed for the Mediterranean to join Commodore Decatur&#x27;s 10-ship squadron in the Second Barbary War in Algeria, a renewal of naval action against the Barbary powers, to stop harassment of American shipping. On 17 June the frigate assisted in the capture of the Algerian flagship, the frigate &quot;Mashuda&quot;, by frigates and , the sloops-of-war and .

The signing of a treaty with Tunis and Tripoli on 7 August, following that with Algeria in June, won maritime freedom in the Mediterranean. The next three years &quot;Macedonian&quot; patrolled there and off the East Coast.

From January 1819 to March 1821 the frigate operated off the Pacific coast of South America, giving aid and protection to the commercial ships in the area during the disorders following the Latin American colonial revolts, before returning to Boston in June 1821.

During this period she worked as a banking ship, doing business with privateers of every kind. Captain Downes often kept his midshipmen and other trusted aides busy counting specie. Many deposits were made, with many single deposits of over 100,000.

The men complained bitterly about their treatment, writing of how they were forced to eat mealy grain while counting hundreds of thousands of dollars in specie. Many of the men felt that Captain Downes was doing this for the &quot;good of the Captain&quot; and wondered when they would be used for the purpose they joined the Navy for rather than for the Captain&#x27;s personal enrichment.

On 2 April 1822 the &quot;Macedonian&quot; left Boston as part of Commodore James Biddle&#x27;s West Indies Squadron. Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson had assigned the squadron to guard United States merchant shipping and suppress piracy. During their deployment seventy six of the &quot;Macedonian&quot; officers and men died. Seventy four of these deaths were by yellow fever. Biddle reported another fifty two of his crew were on sick-list. In their report to the Secretary of the Navy, Commodore Biddle and Surgeon&#x27;s Mate Dr. Charles Chase state the cause as &quot;fever&quot;. As a consequence of this loss Biddle noted his squadron was forced to return to Norfolk Navy Yard early. The &quot;Macedonian&quot; crew upon arrival were provided medical care and quarantined at Craney Island

She next cruised in the West Indies, where she helped suppress piracy, into 1826.

On 11 June 1826 &quot;Macedonian&quot; departed Norfolk for service on the Pacific station, returning to Hampton Roads, 30 October 1828. She was decommissioned in 1828 and was broken up at the Norfolk Navy Yard. The crew for this final voyage included William Henry Leonard Poe, brother of American writer Edgar Allan Poe. HMS &quot;Macedonian&quot;″s captured ensign was on display at Mahan Hall at the U.S. Naval Academy, but was removed on 27 February 2018 for preservation.

<text>Mare Crisium (Latin &quot;crisium&quot;, the &quot;Sea of Crises&quot;) is a lunar mare located in the Moon&#x27;s Crisium basin, just northeast of Mare Tranquillitatis. Mare Crisium is a basin of Nectarian age. It was formed by the flooding of basaltic lava that filled an ancient asteroid impact. 

==Characteristics==

Mare Crisium is in diameter, and in area. It has a very flat floor, with a ring of wrinkle ridges (&quot;dorsa&quot;) toward its outer boundaries. These are Dorsa Tetyaev, Dorsum Oppel, Dorsum Termier, and Dorsa Harker. The cape-like feature protruding into the southeast of the mare is Promontorium Agarum. On the western rim of the mare is the palimpsest Yerkes, and Lick to the southeast is similar. The crater Picard is located just to the east of Yerkes, and northwest of Picard are the craters Peirce and Swift. The ray system of the crater Proclus overlie the northwestern mare. Mare Anguis can be seen northeast of Mare Crisium.

A mass concentration (mascon), or gravitational high, was identified in the center of Mare Crisium from Doppler tracking of the five Lunar Orbiter spacecraft in 1968. The mascon was confirmed and mapped at higher resolution with later orbiters such as Lunar Prospector and GRAIL.
==Names==
Like most of the other maria on the Moon, Mare Crisium was named by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized.

By the 17th century, Mare Crisium had acquired the name &#x27;Caspian Sea&#x27;, being labelled as such by Thomas Harriot, Pierre Gassendi and Michael van Langren. Ewen A. Whitaker speculates that it received this name because it occupies roughly the same position on the Moon&#x27;s face as does the Caspian Sea on Earth, with respect to maps of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. The English astronomer William Gilbert&#x27;s map of &quot;c&quot;.1600 calls it &#x27;Brittania&#x27; after Britain.

==Observation and exploration==
Mare Crisium is just visible from Earth with the naked eye as a small dark spot on the edge of the Moon&#x27;s face.

It is the site of the 21 July 1969 crash-landing of the Soviet Luna 15 probe, occurring the same day that two Apollo 11 astronauts walked on the Moon. A soil sample from Mare Crisium was successfully brought to Earth on 22 August 1976 by the Soviet lunar mission Luna 24.

== In popular culture and literature ==
Mare Crisium is used as the location for Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s 1948 seminal short-story &quot;The Sentinel&quot;. In the story, a mysterious structure is found in one of the mountains surrounding the Mare. Clarke describes Mare Crisium as follows:
In Warhammer 40k, it is the location of the &quot;Somnus Citadel&quot; a base for the Sisters of Silence.

<doc id="201572" wikidata="Q488506" url="?curid=201572" title="Anattā">
<text>In Buddhism, the term anattā () or anātman () is the doctrine of &quot;no-self&quot; – that no unchanging, permanent self or essence can be found in any phenomenon. While often interpreted as a doctrine denying the existence of a self, &quot;anatman&quot; is more accurately described as a strategy to attain non-attachment by recognizing everything as impermanent, while staying silent on the ultimate existence of an unchanging essence. In contrast, dominant schools of Hinduism assert the existence of Ātman as pure awareness or witness-consciousness, &quot;reify[ing] consciousness as an eternal self.&quot;

== Etymology and nomenclature ==
&quot;Anattā&quot; is a composite Pali word consisting of &quot;an&quot; (not) and &quot;attā&quot; (self-existent essence). The term refers to the central Buddhist concept that there is no phenomenon that has a permanent, unchanging &quot;self&quot; or essence. It is one of the three characteristics of all existence, together with &quot;dukkha&quot; (suffering, dissatisfaction) and &quot;anicca&quot; (impermanence).

&quot;Anattā&quot; is synonymous with &quot;Anātman&quot; (an + ātman) in Sanskrit Buddhist texts. In some Pali texts, &quot;ātman&quot; of Vedic texts is also referred to with the term &quot;Attan&quot;, with the sense of &quot;soul&quot;. An alternate use of &quot;Attan&quot; or &quot;Atta&quot; is &quot;self, oneself, essence of a person&quot;, driven by the Vedic-era Brahmanical belief that atman is the permanent, unchangeable essence of a living being, or the true self.

In Buddhism-related English literature, &quot;Anattā&quot; is rendered as &quot;not-Self&quot;, but this translation expresses an incomplete meaning, states Peter Harvey; a more complete rendering is &quot;no-Self&quot; because from its earliest days, &quot;Anattā&quot; doctrine denied that there is anything called a &quot;Self&quot; in any person or anything else, and that a belief in &quot;Self&quot; is a source of &quot;Dukkha&quot; (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness). Buddhist scholar Richard Gombrich, however, argues that &quot;anattā&quot; is often mistranslated as meaning &quot;not having a self or essence&quot;, but actually means &quot;&quot;is&quot; not &quot;ātman&quot;&quot; instead of &quot;does not &quot;have ātman&quot;.&quot; It is also incorrect to translate &quot;Anattā&quot; simply as &quot;ego-less&quot;, according to Peter Harvey, because the Indian concept of &quot;ātman&quot; and &quot;attā&quot; is different from the Freudian concept of ego.

== In early Buddhism ==
===In early Buddhist texts ===
The concept of &quot;Anattā&quot; appears in numerous Sutras of the ancient Buddhist Nikāya texts (Pali canon). It appears, for example, as a noun in &quot;Samyutta Nikaya&quot; III.141, IV.49, V.345, in Sutta II.37 of &quot;Anguttara Nikaya&quot;, II.37–45 and II.80 of &quot;Patisambhidamagga&quot;, III.406 of &quot;Dhammapada&quot;. It also appears as an adjective, for example, in &quot;Samyutta Nikaya&quot; III.114, III.133, IV.28 and IV.130–166, in Sutta III.66 and V.86 of &quot;Vinaya&quot;. It is also found in the &quot;Dhammapada&quot;.

The ancient Buddhist texts discuss &quot;Attā&quot; or &quot;Attan&quot; (self), sometimes with alternate terms such as &quot;Atuman&quot;, &quot;Tuma&quot;, &quot;Puggala&quot;, &quot;Jiva&quot;, &quot;Satta&quot;, &quot;Pana&quot; and &quot;Nama-rupa&quot;, thereby providing the context for the Buddhist &quot;Anattā&quot; doctrine. Examples of such &quot;Attā&quot; contextual discussions are found in &quot;Digha Nikaya&quot; I.186–187, &quot;Samyutta Nikaya&quot; III.179 and IV.54, &quot;Vinaya&quot; I.14, &quot;Majjhima Nikaya&quot; I.138, III.19, and III.265–271 and &quot;Anguttara Nikaya&quot; I.284. According to Steven Collins, the inquiry of &quot;anattā&quot; and &quot;denial of self&quot; in the canonical Buddhist texts is &quot;insisted on only in certain theoretical contexts&quot;, while they use the terms &quot;atta, purisa, puggala&quot; quite naturally and freely in various contexts. The elaboration of the &quot;anattā&quot; doctrine, along with identification of the words such as &quot;puggala&quot; as &quot;permanent subject or soul&quot; appears in later Buddhist literature.

According to Collins, the Suttas present the doctrine in three forms. First, they apply the &quot;no-self, no-identity&quot; investigation to all phenomena as well as any and all objects, yielding the idea that &quot;all things are not-self&quot; (&quot;sabbe dhamma anattā&quot;). Second, states Collins, the Suttas apply the doctrine to deny self of any person, treating conceit to be evident in any assertion of &quot;this is mine, this I am, this is myself&quot; (&quot;etam mamam eso &#x27;ham asmi, eso me atta ti&quot;). Third, the Theravada texts apply the doctrine as a nominal reference, to identify examples of &quot;self&quot; and &quot;not-self&quot;, respectively the Wrong view and the Right view; this third case of nominative usage is properly translated as &quot;self&quot; (as an identity) and is unrelated to &quot;soul&quot;, states Collins. The first two usages incorporate the idea of soul.

===No denial of self===
Buddhist scholars Richard Gombrich and Alexander Wynne argue that the Buddha&#x27;s descriptions of no-self in early Buddhist texts do not deny that there is a self. Wynne and Gombrich both argue that the Buddha&#x27;s statements on &quot;anattā&quot; were originally a &quot;not-self&quot; teaching that developed into a &quot;no-self&quot; teaching in later Buddhist thought. According to Wynne, early Buddhist texts such as the &quot;Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta&quot; do not deny that there is a self, stating that the five aggregates that are described as not-self are not descriptions of a human being but descriptions of the human experience. According to Johannes Bronkhorst, it is possible that &quot;original Buddhism did not deny the existence of the soul&quot;, even though a firm Buddhist tradition has maintained that the Buddha avoided talking about the soul or even denied its existence. 

Tibetologist André Migot states that original Buddhism may not have taught a complete absence of self, pointing to evidence presented by Buddhist and Pali scholars Jean Przyluski and Caroline Rhys Davids that early Buddhism generally believed in a self, making Buddhist schools that admit an existence of a &quot;self&quot; not heretical, but conservative, adhering to ancient beliefs. While there may be ambivalence on the existence or non-existence of self in early Buddhist literature, Bronkhorst suggests that these texts clearly indicate that the Buddhist path of liberation consists not in seeking Atman-like self-knowledge, but in turning away from what might erroneously be regarded as the self. This is a reverse position to the Vedic traditions which recognized the knowledge of the self as &quot;the principal means to achieving liberation.&quot;

According to Harvey, the contextual use of &quot;Attā&quot; in the Nikāyas is two-sided. In one, it directly denies that anything can be found called a self or soul in a human being that is a permanent essence of a human being, a theme found in Brahmanical traditions. In another, states Peter Harvey, such as at &quot;Samyutta Nikaya&quot; IV.286, the Sutta considers the materialistic concept in the pre-Buddhist Vedic period of &quot;no afterlife, complete annihilation&quot; at death to be a denial of Self, but still &quot;tied up with belief in a Self&quot;. &quot;Self exists&quot; is a false premise, assert the early Buddhist texts. However, adds Peter Harvey, these texts do not admit the premise &quot;Self does not exist&quot; either because the wording presumes the concept of &quot;Self&quot; before denying it; instead, the early Buddhist texts use the concept of &quot;Anattā&quot; as the implicit premise.

=== Developing the self ===
According to Peter Harvey, while the &quot;Suttas&quot; criticize notions of an eternal, unchanging Self as baseless, they see an enlightened being as one whose empirical self is highly developed. This is paradoxical, states Harvey, in that &quot;the Self-like &quot;nibbana&quot; state&quot; is a mature self that knows &quot;everything as Selfless&quot;. The &quot;empirical self&quot; is the &quot;citta&quot; (mind/heart, mindset, emotional nature), and the development of self in the Suttas is the development of this &quot;citta&quot;.

One with &quot;great self&quot;, state the early Buddhist &quot;Suttas&quot;, has a mind which is neither at the mercy of outside stimuli nor its own moods, neither scattered nor diffused, but imbued with self-control, and self-contained towards the single goal of &quot;nibbana&quot; and a &#x27;Self-like&#x27; state. This &quot;great self&quot; is not yet an &quot;Arahat&quot;, because he still does small evil action which leads to karmic fruition, but he has enough virtue that he does not experience this fruition in hell.

An &quot;Arahat&quot;, states Harvey, has a fully enlightened state of empirical self, one that lacks the &quot;sense of both &#x27;I am&#x27; and &#x27;this I am&#x27;&quot;, which are illusions that the &quot;Arahat&quot; has transcended. The Buddhist thought and salvation theory emphasizes a development of self towards a Selfless state not only with respect to oneself, but recognizing the lack of relational essence and Self in others, wherein states Martijn van Zomeren, &quot;self is an illusion&quot;.

=== Karma, rebirth and anattā ===

The Buddha emphasized both karma and &quot;anattā&quot; doctrines. The Buddha criticized the doctrine that posited an unchanging essence as a subject as the basis of rebirth and karmic moral responsibility, which he called &quot;atthikavāda&quot;. He also criticized the materialistic doctrine that denied the existence of both soul and rebirth, and thereby denied karmic moral responsibility, which he calls &quot;natthikavāda&quot;. Instead, the Buddha asserted that there is no essence, but there is rebirth for which karmic moral responsibility is a must. In the Buddha&#x27;s framework of karma, right view and right actions are necessary for liberation.

Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism all assert a belief in rebirth, and emphasize moral responsibility in a way different from pre-Buddhist materialistic schools of Indian philosophies. The materialistic schools of Indian philosophies, such as Charvaka, are called annihilationist schools because they posited that death is the end, there is no afterlife, no soul, no rebirth, no karma, and death is that state where a living being is completely annihilated, dissolved.

Buddha criticized the materialistic annihilationism view that denied rebirth and karma, states Damien Keown. Such beliefs are inappropriate and dangerous, stated Buddha, because they encourage moral irresponsibility and material hedonism. Anattā does not mean there is no afterlife, no rebirth or no fruition of karma, and Buddhism contrasts itself to annihilationist schools. Buddhism also contrasts itself to other Indian religions that champion moral responsibility but posit eternalism with their premise that within each human being there is an essence or eternal soul, and this soul is part of the nature of a living being, existence and metaphysical reality.

== In Theravada Buddhism ==

===Traditional views===
Theravada Buddhism scholars, states Oliver Leaman, consider the &quot;Anattā&quot; doctrine as one of the main theses of Buddhism. The Buddhist denial of an unchanging, permanent self is what distinguishes Buddhism from major religions of the world such as Christianity and Hinduism, giving it uniqueness, asserts the Theravada tradition. With the doctrine of &quot;Anattā&quot;, stands or falls the entire Buddhist structure, asserts Nyanatiloka Mahathera.

According to Collins, &quot;insight into the teaching of &quot;anattā&quot; is held to have two major loci in the intellectual and spiritual education of an individual&quot; as s/he progresses along the Path. The first part of this insight is to avoid &quot;sakkayaditthi&quot; (Personality Belief), that is converting the &quot;sense of I which is gained from introspection and the fact of physical individuality&quot; into a theoretical belief in a self. &quot;A belief in a (really) existing body&quot; is considered a false belief and a part of the Ten Fetters that must be gradually lost. The second loci is the psychological realization of &quot;anattā&quot;, or loss of &quot;pride or conceit&quot;. This, states Collins, is explained as the conceit of &quot;asmimana&quot; or &quot;I am&quot;; (...) what this &quot;conceit&quot; refers to is the fact that for the unenlightened, all experience and action must necessarily appear phenomenologically as happening to or originating from an &quot;I&quot;. When a Buddhist gets more enlightened, this happening to or originating in an &quot;I&quot; or sakkdyaditthi is less. The final attainment of enlightenment is the disappearance of this automatic but illusory &quot;I&quot;.

The Theravada tradition has long considered the understanding and application of the &quot;Anattā&quot; doctrine to be a complex teaching, whose &quot;personal, introjected application has always been thought to be possible only for the specialist, the practising monk&quot;. The tradition, states Collins, has &quot;insisted fiercely on &quot;anattā&quot; as a doctrinal position&quot;, while in practice it may not play much of a role in the daily religious life of most Buddhists. The Theravada doctrine of &quot;Anattā&quot;, or not-self not-soul, inspire meditative practices for monks, states Donald Swearer, but for the lay Theravada Buddhists in Southeast Asia, the doctrines of &quot;kamma&quot;, rebirth and &quot;punna&quot; (merit) inspire a wide range of ritual practices and ethical behavior.

The &quot;Anattā&quot; doctrine is key to the concept of Nibbana in the Theravada tradition. The liberated nirvana state, states Collins, is the state of &quot;Anattā&quot;, a state that is neither universally applicable nor can be explained, but can be realized.

=== Current disputes ===
The dispute about &quot;self&quot; and &quot;not-self&quot; doctrines has continued throughout the history of Buddhism. In Thai Buddhism, for example, states Paul Williams, some modern era Buddhist scholars have claimed that &quot;Nirvana is indeed the true self&quot;, while other Thai Buddhists disagree. For instance, the Dhammakaya tradition in Thailand teaches that it is erroneous to subsume nirvana under the rubric of &quot;anattā&quot; (no-self); instead, nirvana is taught to be the &quot;true self&quot; or &quot;dhammakaya&quot;. The Dhammakaya tradition teaching that nirvana is atta, or true self, was criticized as heretical in Buddhism in 1994 by Ven. Payutto, a well-known scholar monk, who stated that &#x27;Buddha taught Nibbana as being no-self&quot;. The abbot of one major temple in the Dhammakaya tradition, Luang Por Sermchai of Wat Luang Por Sodh Dhammakayaram, argues that it tends to be scholars who hold the view of absolute no-self, rather than Buddhist meditation practitioners. He points to the experiences of prominent forest hermit monks such as Luang Pu Sodh and Ajahn Mun to support the notion of a &quot;true self&quot;. Similar interpretations on the &quot;true self&quot; were put forth earlier by the 12th Supreme Patriarch of Thailand in 1939. According to Williams, the Supreme Patriarch&#x27;s interpretation echoes the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; sutras.

Several notable teachers of the Thai Forest Tradition have also described ideas in contrast to absolute no-self. Ajahn Maha Bua, a well known meditation master, described the citta (mind) as being an indestructible reality that does not fall under &quot;anattā.&quot; He has stated that not-self is merely a perception that is used to pry one away from infatuation with the concept of a self, and that once this infatuation is gone the idea of not-self must be dropped as well. American monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu of the Thai Forest Tradition describes the Buddha&#x27;s statements on non-self as a path to awakening rather than a universal truth. Bhikkhu Bodhi authored a rejoinder to Thanissaro, agreeing that &quot;anattā&quot; is a strategy for awakening but stating that &quot;The reason the teaching of &quot;anattā&quot; can serve as a strategy of liberation is precisely because it serves to rectify a misconception about the nature of being, hence an ontological error.&quot; Thanissaro Bhikkhu states that the Buddha intentionally set aside the question of whether or not there is a self as a useless question, and goes on to call the phrase &quot;there is no self&quot; the &quot;granddaddy of fake Buddhist quotes&quot;. He adds that clinging to the idea that there is no self at all would actually &quot;prevent&quot; enlightenment. Thanissaro Bhikkhu points to the Ananda Sutta (SN 44.10), where the Buddha stays silent when asked whether there is a &#x27;self&#x27; or not, as a major cause of the dispute.

== Anātman in Mahayana Buddhism ==

&quot;Anātman&quot; is one of the main bedrock doctrines of Buddhism, and its discussion is found in the later texts of all Buddhist traditions. 

There are many different views of &quot;anātman&quot; (; Japanese: 無我 &quot;muga&quot;; Korean: 무아 &quot;mu-a&quot;) within various Mahayana schools.

The early Mahayana Buddhist texts link their discussion of &quot;emptiness&quot; (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;) to &quot;anātman&quot; and nirvana. They do so, states Mun-Keat Choong, in three ways: first, in the common sense of a monk&#x27;s meditative state of emptiness; second, with the main sense of &quot;anātman&quot; or &#x27;everything in the world is empty of self&#x27;; third, with the ultimate sense of &quot;Nirvana&quot; or realization of emptiness and thus an end to rebirth cycles of suffering. The &quot;anātman&quot; doctrine is another aspect of &quot;śūnyatā&quot;, its realization is the nature of the &quot;nirvana&quot; state and to an end to rebirths.

===Nāgārjuna===
The Buddhist philosopher Nāgārjuna (~200 CE), the founder of Madhyamaka (middle way) school of Mahayana Buddhism, analyzed dharma first as factors of experience. David Kalupahana states that Nāgārjuna analyzed how these experiences relate to &quot;bondage and freedom, action and consequence&quot;, and thereafter analyzed the notion of personal self (&quot;ātman&quot;).

Nāgārjuna extensively wrote about rejecting the metaphysical entity called &quot;ātman&quot; (self, soul), asserting in chapter 18 of his &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; that there is no such substantial entity and that &quot;Buddha taught the doctrine of no-self&quot;. 

Nāgārjuna asserted that the notion of a self is associated with the notion of one&#x27;s own identity and corollary ideas of pride, selfishness and a sense of psychophysical personality. This is all false, and leads to bondage in his Madhyamaka thought. There can be no pride nor possessiveness, in someone who accepts &quot;anātman&quot; and denies &quot;self&quot; which is the sense of personal identity of oneself, others or anything, states Nāgārjuna. Further, all obsessions are avoided when a person accepts emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;). Nāgārjuna denied there is anything called a self-nature as well as other-nature, emphasizing true knowledge to be comprehending emptiness. Anyone who has not dissociated from their belief in personality in themselves or others, through the concept of self, is in a state of &quot;avidya&quot; (ignorance) and caught in the cycle of rebirths and redeaths.

===Yogācāra===
The texts attributed to the 5th-century Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu of the Yogācāra school similarly discuss &quot;anātman&quot; as a fundamental premise of the Buddha. The Vasubandhu interpretations of no-self thesis were challenged by the 7th-century Buddhist scholar Candrakīrti, who then offered his own theories on its importance.

=== Tathāgatagarbha Sutras: Buddha is True Self ===
Some 1st-millennium CE Buddhist texts suggest concepts that have been controversial because they imply a &quot;self-like&quot; concept. In particular are the &quot;tathāgatagarbha sūtras&quot;, where the title itself means a &quot;garbha&quot; (womb, matrix, seed) containing &quot;Tathāgata&quot; (Buddha). These Sutras suggest, states Paul Williams, that &quot;all sentient beings contain a Tathagata&quot; as their &quot;essence, core or essential inner nature&quot;. The &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; doctrine, at its earliest probably appeared about the later part of the 3rd century CE, and is verifiable in Chinese translations of 1st millennium CE. Most scholars consider the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; doctrine of an &quot;essential nature&quot; in every living being is equivalent to &quot;self&quot;, and it contradicts the &quot;anātman&quot; doctrines in a vast majority of Buddhist texts, leading scholars to posit that the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; sutras were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists.

The &quot;Mahayana&quot; &quot;Mahaparinirvana Sutra&quot; explicitly asserts that the Buddha used the term &quot;self&quot; in order to win over non-Buddhist ascetics. The &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; (also known as &quot;Uttaratantra&quot;), another text composed in the first half of 1st millennium CE and translated into Chinese in 511 CE, points out that the teaching of the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; doctrine is intended to win sentient beings over to abandoning &quot;self-love&quot; (&quot;atma-sneha&quot;) – considered to be one of the defects by Buddhism. The 6th-century Chinese &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; translation states that &quot;Buddha has &quot;shiwo&quot; (true self) which is beyond being and nonbeing&quot;. However, the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; asserts that the &quot;self&quot; implied in &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; doctrine is actually &quot;not-self&quot;.

According to some scholars, the Buddha-nature discussed in these sutras does not represent a substantial self; rather, it is a positive language and expression of śūnyatā &quot;emptiness&quot; and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. Other scholars do in fact detect leanings towards monism in these &quot;tathagatagarbha&quot; references. Michael Zimmermann sees the notion of an unperishing and eternal self in the Tathagatagarbha Sutra. Zimmermann also avers that &quot;the existence of an eternal, imperishable self, that is, buddhahood, is definitely the basic point of the Tathāgatagarbha Sutra&quot;. He further indicates that there is no evident interest found in this sutra in the idea of Emptiness (&quot;sunyata&quot;). Williams states that the &quot;self&quot; in &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; sutras is actually &quot;non-self&quot;, and neither identical nor comparable to the Hindu concepts of &quot;brahman&quot; and self.

===Vajrayāna ===

The &quot;anātman&quot; doctrine is extensively discussed in and partly inspires the ritual practices of the Vajrayāna tradition. The Tibetan terms such as &quot;bdag med&quot; refer to &quot;without a self, insubstantial, anātman&quot;. These discussions, states Jeffrey Hopkins, assert the &quot;non-existence of a permanent, unitary and independent self&quot;, and attribute these ideas to the Buddha.

The ritual practices in Vajrayāna Buddhism employs the concept of deities, to end self-grasping, and to manifest as a purified, enlightened deity as part of the Vajrayāna path to liberation from rebirths. One such deity is goddess Nairatmya (literally, non-soul, non-self). She symbolizes, states Miranda Shaw, that &quot;self is an illusion&quot; and &quot;all beings and phenomenal appearances lack an abiding self or essence&quot; in Vajrayāna Buddhism.

== Difference between Buddhism and Hinduism ==

===Atman in Hinduism===
The Buddhist concept of &quot;anattā&quot; or &quot;anātman&quot; is one of the fundamental differences between mainstream Buddhism and mainstream Hinduism, with the latter asserting that &quot;ātman&quot; (&quot;self&quot;) exists. 

In Hinduism, &quot;Atman&quot; refers to the essence of human beings, the observing pure awareness or witness-consciousness. It is unaffected by ego, distinct from the individual being (&quot;jivanatman&quot;) embedded in material reality, and characterized by &quot;Ahamkara&quot; (&#x27;I-making&#x27;), mind (&quot;citta&quot;, &quot;manas&quot;), and all the defiling &quot;kleshas&quot; (impurities). Embodied personality changes over time, while &quot;Atman&quot; doesn&#x27;t. 

According to Jayatilleke, the Upanishadic inquiry fails to find an empirical correlate of the assumed &quot;Atman&quot;, but nevertheless assumes its existence, and Advaitins &quot;reify consciousness as an eternal self.&quot; In contrast, the Buddhist inquiry &quot;is satisfied with the empirical investigation which shows that no such Atman exists because there is no evidence&quot; states Jayatilleke. According to Harvey, in Buddhism the negation of temporal existents is applied even more rigorously than in the Upanishads:
Both Buddhism and Hinduism distinguish ego-related &quot;I am, this is mine&quot;, from their respective abstract doctrines of &quot;&quot;Anattā&quot; and &quot;Atman&quot;&quot;. This, states Peter Harvey, may have been an influence of Buddhism on Hinduism.

===Anatman and Niratman===
The term &quot;niratman&quot; appears in the &quot;Maitrayaniya Upanishad&quot; of Hinduism, such as in verses 6.20, 6.21 and 7.4. &quot;Niratman&quot; literally means &quot;selfless&quot;. The &quot;niratman&quot; concept has been interpreted to be analogous to &quot;anatman&quot; of Buddhism. The ontological teachings, however, are different. In the Upanishad, states Thomas Wood, numerous positive and negative descriptions of various states – such as &quot;niratman&quot; and &quot;sarvasyatman&quot; (the self of all) – are used in &quot;Maitrayaniya Upanishad&quot; to explain the nondual concept of the &quot;highest Self&quot;. According to Ramatirtha, states Paul Deussen, the &quot;niratman&quot; state discussion is referring to stopping the recognition of oneself as an individual soul, and reaching the awareness of universal soul or the metaphysical Brahman.

==Correspondence in Pyrrhonism==

The Greek philosopher Pyrrho traveled to India as part of Alexander the Great&#x27;s entourage where he was influenced by the Indian gymnosophists, which inspired him to create the philosophy of Pyrrhonism. Philologist Christopher Beckwith argues that Pyrrho based his philosophy on his translation of the three marks of existence into Greek, and that &quot;adiaphora&quot; (not logically differentiable, not clearly definable, negating Aristotle&#x27;s use of &quot;diaphora&quot;) reflects Pyrrho&#x27;s understanding of the Buddhist concept of &quot;anattā&quot;.

<text>Mare Tranquillitatis (Latin for Sea of Tranquillity or Sea of Tranquility) is a lunar mare that sits within the Tranquillitatis basin on the Moon. It contains Tranquility Base, the first location on another celestial body to be visited by humans.

The mare material within the basin consists of basalt formed in the intermediate to young age group of the Upper Imbrian epoch. The surrounding mountains are thought to be of the Lower Imbrian epoch, but the actual basin is probably Pre-Nectarian. The basin has irregular margins and lacks a defined multiple-ringed structure. The irregular topography in and near this basin results from the intersection of the Tranquillitatis, Nectaris, Crisium, Fecunditatis, and Serenitatis basins with two throughgoing rings of the Procellarum basin. Palus Somni, on the northeastern rim of the mare, is filled with the basalt that spilled over from Tranquillitatis.

This mare has a slight bluish tint relative to the rest of the Moon and stands out quite well when color is processed and extracted from 
multiple photographs. The color is likely due to higher metal content in the basaltic soil or rocks.

Unlike many other maria, there is no mass concentration (mascon), or gravitational high, in the center of Mare Tranquillitatis. Mascons were identified in the center of other maria (such as Serenitatis or Imbrium) from Doppler tracking of the five Lunar Orbiter spacecraft in 1968. The gravity field was mapped at higher resolution with later orbiters such as Lunar Prospector and GRAIL, which unveiled an irregular pattern.

==Naming==
Mare Tranquillitatis was named in 1651 by astronomers Francesco Grimaldi and Giovanni Battista Riccioli in their lunar map &quot;Almagestum novum&quot;.

Michael van Langren, in his &quot;Lumina Austriaca Philippica&quot; of 1645, used the name &quot;Mare Belgicum&quot;.

==Landings==

On February 20, 1965, the Ranger 8 spacecraft was deliberately crashed into the Mare Tranquillitatis at after successfully transmitting 7,137 close-range photographs of the Moon in the final 23 minutes of its mission.

Surveyor 5 landed in Mare Tranquillitatis on September 11, 1967, after transmitting 19,118 images of the Moon, and was the fifth lunar lander of the uncrewed Surveyor program.

===Apollo 11===

Mare Tranquillitatis was the landing site for the first crewed landing on the Moon on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC. After astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made a soft landing in the Apollo 11 Lunar Module &quot;Eagle&quot;, Armstrong told flight controllers on Earth, &quot;Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.&quot; The landing area at has been designated &quot;Statio Tranquillitatis&quot; after Armstrong&#x27;s name for it, and three small craters to the north of the base have been named Aldrin, Collins, and Armstrong in honor of the Apollo 11 crew.

Apollo 11 landed at .

==Bays==

Along the periphery of the mare are several bay-shaped features that have been given names: Sinus Amoris, Sinus Asperitatis, 
Sinus Concordiae, and Sinus Honoris.

==Views==
These are three views of Mare Tranquillitatis on the Moon, taken by the mapping camera of the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, facing south-southwest from an average altitude of 111 km on Revolution 36 of the mission. At the left is the east side of Mare Tranquillitatis, with the craters Franz (bottom right), Lyell (dark floor, right of center), and Taruntius (upper left). The &quot;bay&quot; of dark mare (basalt) at left is Sinus Concordiae, with &quot;islands&quot; of older, light highland material. At the right is the crater Cauchy, which lies between the Rupes Cauchy and Cauchy rille. The center photo shows the central mare with craters Vitruvius (lower right) and Gardner (bottom center). At the horizon are lighter highlands at the southern margin of the mare, near the Apollo 11 landing site. The crater Jansen is visible at the edges of both the center and right photos. The right photo shows the western mare, with the craters Dawes (lower left) and the large Plinius (43 km diameter), with the Plinius Rilles in the foreground. These photos were taken within minutes of each other as the command module &quot;America&quot; orbited the Moon. The Sun elevation drops from 46 degrees at left to 30 degrees at right.

<doc id="201574" wikidata="Q240425" url="?curid=201574" title="Polisario Front">
<text>The Popular Front for the Liberation of [[Saguia el-Hamra]] and [[Río de Oro]] (Spanish: ; ), better known by its acronym Polisario Front, is a Sahrawi nationalist liberation movement seeking to end the occupation of Western Sahara through the means of self-determination and armed resistance. 

Tracing its origin to a Sahrawi nationalist organization known as the Movement for the Liberation of Saguia el Hamra and Wadi el Dhahab, the Polisario Front was formally constituted in 1973 with the intention of launching an armed struggle against the Spanish occupation which lasted until 1975, when the Spanish decided to allow Mauritania and Morocco to partition and occupy the territory. The Polisario Front proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) on 27 February 1976, and waged a war to drive out the two armies. It forced Mauritania to relinquish its claim over Western Sahara in 1979 and continued its military campaign against Morocco until the 1991 ceasefire, pending the holding of a UN-backed referendum which has been consistently postponed ever since. In 2020 the Polisario Front declared the ceasefire over and resumed the armed conflict.

The United Nations considers the Polisario Front to be the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people and maintains that the Sahrawis have a right to self-determination. The Polisario Front is outlawed in the parts of Western Sahara under Moroccan control, and it is illegal to raise its party flag (often called the Sahrawi flag) there. It is a consultative member of the Socialist International.

==History==
===Beginnings===
In 1971 a group of young Sahrawi students in the universities of Morocco began organizing what came to be known as &quot;The Embryonic Movement for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro.&quot;

After attempting in vain to gain backing from several Arab governments, including both Algeria and Morocco, but only drawing faint notices of support from Libya and Mauritania, the movement eventually relocated to Spanish-controlled Spanish Sahara to start an armed rebellion.

The Polisario Front was formally constituted on 10 May 1973 at Ain Bentili by several Sahrawi university students, survivors of the 1968 massacres in Zouérat and Sahrawi veterans of the Spanish Army. They called themselves the Constituent Congress of the Polisario Front.

On 1 May 1977, the Polisario Front raided the city of Zouerate, Mauritania, kidnapping six French iron mining technicians and killing two civilians. The Polisario abducted two more civilians in October. They were freed in December.

Its first secretary general was Brahim Ghali. On 20 May, the new organization attacked El-Khanga, where there was a Spanish post manned by a team of &quot;Tropas Nomadas&quot; (Sahrawi-staffed auxiliary forces), which was overrun and rifles seized. Polisario then gradually gained control over large swaths of desert countryside, and its power grew from early 1975 when the &quot;Tropas Nomadas&quot; began deserting to the Polisario, bringing weapons and training with them. At this point, Polisario&#x27;s manpower included perhaps 800 men and women, but they were suspected of being backed by a much larger network of supporters.

A UN visiting mission, headed by Simeon Aké, that was conducted in June 1975 concluded that Sahrawi support for independence (as opposed to Spanish rule or integration with a neighbouring country) amounted to an &quot;overwhelming consensus&quot; and that the Polisario Front was the most powerful political force in the country. With Algeria&#x27;s help, Polisario set up headquarters in Tindouf.

===Withdrawal of Spain===

After Moroccan pressures through the Green March of 6 November and the Royal Moroccan Army&#x27;s previous invasion of eastern Saguia el-Hamra of 31 October, Spain entered negotiations that led to the signing of the Madrid Accords whereby Spain ceded Spanish Sahara to Morocco and Mauritania; in 1976 Morocco took over Saguia El Hamra and Mauritania took control of Río de Oro. The Polisario Front proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) on 27 February 1976, and waged a guerrilla war against both Morocco and Mauritania. The International Court of Justice at The Hague had issued its verdict on the former Spanish colony just weeks before, which each party interpreted as confirming its right to the disputed territory.

The Polisario kept up the guerrilla war while they simultaneously had to help guard the columns of Sahrawi refugees fleeing, but after the air bombings by the Royal Moroccan Air Force on improvised Sahrawi refugee camps in Umm Dreiga, Tifariti, Guelta Zemmur and Amgala, the Front had to relocate the refugees to Tindouf (western region of Algeria). For the next two years the movement grew tremendously as Sahrawi refugees continued flocking to the camps and Algeria and Libya supplied arms and funding. Within months, its army had expanded to several thousand armed fighters, camels were replaced by modern jeeps (most of them were Spanish Land Rover Santana jeeps, captured from Moroccan soldiers), and 19th-century muskets were replaced by assault rifles. The reorganized army was able to inflict severe damage through guerrilla-style hit-and-run attacks against opposing forces in Western Sahara and in Morocco and Mauritania proper.

===Withdrawal of Mauritania===
A comprehensive peace treaty was signed on 5 August 1979, in which the new Mauritanian government recognized Sahrawi rights to Western Sahara and relinquished its own claims. Mauritania withdrew all its forces, and later formally recognized the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, causing a massive rupture in relations with Morocco. The area of Western Sahara evacuated by Mauritania (Tiris al-Gharbiya, roughly corresponding to the southern half of Río de Oro), was annexed by Morocco in August 1979.

===Moroccan wall stalemates the war===

From the mid-1980s Morocco largely managed to keep Polisario troops off by building a huge berm or sand wall (the Moroccan Wall), staffed by an army, enclosing within it the economically useful parts of Western Sahara (Bou Craa, El-Aaiun, Smara, etc.) This stalemated the war, with no side able to achieve decisive gains, but artillery strikes and sniping attacks by the Polisario continued, and Morocco was economically and politically strained by the war. Today Polisario controls the part of the Western Sahara on the east of the Moroccan Wall.

===Ceasefire and the referendum process===
A ceasefire between the Polisario Front and Morocco, monitored by MINURSO (UN), has been in effect since 6 September 1991, on the promise of a referendum on independence the following year. However, the referendum stalled over disagreements on voter rights. Numerous attempts to restart the process (most significantly the launching of the 2003 Baker Plan) seem to have failed.

In April 2007, the government of Morocco suggested that a self-governing entity, through the Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs (CORCAS), should govern the territory with some degree of autonomy for Western Sahara. The project was presented to the United Nations Security Council in mid-April 2007, and quickly gained French and US support. Polisario had handed in its own proposal the day before, which insisted on the previously agreed referendum, but allowed for negotiating the status of Moroccans now living in the territory should the outcome of a referendum be in favor of independence. This led to the negotiations process known as the Manhasset negotiations.

Four rounds were held in 2007 and 2008; no progress was made, however, as both parties refused to compromise about what they considered core sovereignty issues. Polisario agreed to add autonomy as per the Moroccan proposal to a referendum ballot, but refused to relinquish the concept of an independence referendum itself, as agreed in 1991 and 1997. Morocco, in its turn, insisted on only negotiating the terms of autonomy offered, but refused to consider an option of independence on the ballot.

The 30-year cease-fire between Morocco and Polisario Front was broken in November 2020 as the government tried to open a road in the Guerguerat buffer zone near the border with Mauritania.

Sahrawi self-determination activist Sultana Khaya, who has been accused by Moroccan authorities of being a &quot;supporter of violence&quot; with the Polisario, has been under de facto house arrest since November 2020, subject to repeated home raids and sexual assault by Moroccan security forces, as reported by a number of international human rights organizations.

==Political ideology==
The Polisario Front is a Sahrawi nationalist and Arab socialist organization, whose main goal is the independence of Western Sahara from Moroccan occupation. Initially, its driving force was anti-colonial nationalism, and it was not until August 1974 that Polisario declared itself to be in favour of the independence of the Spanish Sahara from Spanish colonization. It is a left-wing movement that is considered to be the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people. It has stated that ideological disputes should be left for a future democratic Western Sahara to deal with. It views itself as a &quot;front&quot; encompassing all political trends in Sahrawi society, and not as a political party. As a consequence, there is no party program. However, the Sahrawi republic&#x27;s constitution gives a hint of the movement&#x27;s ideological context. In 1991, Polisario voted for free market economics and multi-party politics, however a liberal economy has been difficult to implement in a society dependent on humanitarian aid organisations.

The Polisario has stated that it will, when Sahrawi self-determination has been achieved, either function as a party within the context of a multi-party system, or be completely disbanded. This is to be decided by a Polisario Front congress upon the achievement of Western Sahara&#x27;s independence. In interactions with non-Sahrawi audiences, Polisario leaders have made reference to notions of secularism and religious tolerance to substantiate the &quot;ideal&quot; nature of the Sahrawi refugee camps.

===Attitudes to armed struggle===
The Polisario Front has denounced terrorism and attacks against civilians, and sent condolences to Morocco after the 2003 Casablanca bombings. It describes its struggle as a &quot;clean war of national liberation&quot;. Since 1989, when the ceasefire was first concluded, the movement has stated it will pursue its goal of Western Sahara&#x27;s independence by peaceful means as long as Morocco complies with the ceasefire conditions, which include arranging a referendum on independence, while reserving the right to resume armed struggle if terms are objectively breached, for example, if the referendum is not conducted. Mohamed Abdelaziz has repeatedly stated that the Moroccan withdrawal from the 1991 Settlement Plan and refusal to sign the 2003 Baker Plan would logically lead to war from its perspective if the international community does not step in.
In contrast, Polisario-Mauritanian relations following a peace treaty in 1979 and the recognition of the SADR by Mauritania in 1984, with the latter&#x27;s retreat from Western Sahara, have been quiet and generally neutral without reports of armed clashes from either side.

The series of protests and riots in 2005 by Sahrawis in &quot;the occupied territories&quot; received strong vocal support from Polisario as a new pressure point on Morocco. Abdelaziz characterized them as a substitute path for the armed struggle, and indicated that if peaceful protest was squashed, in its view, without a referendum forthcoming, its armed forces would intervene.

==Relations with Algeria==
Algeria has shown an unconditional support for the Polisario Front since 1975, delivering arms, training, financial aid, and food, without interruption for more than 30 years. In 1976, Algeria called the Moroccan takeover of Western Sahara a &quot;slow, murderous&quot; invasion against spirited fighting by Sahara guerrillas.

==Structure==

===Organizational background===
Until 1991, the Polisario Front&#x27;s structure was much different from the present one. It was, despite a few changes, inherited from the before 1975, when the Polisario Front functioned as a small, tightly-knit guerrilla movement, with a few hundred members. Consequently, it made few attempts at a division of powers, instead concentrating most of the decision-making power in the top echelons of Polisario for maximum battlefield efficiency. This meant that most power rested in the hands of the secretary general and a nine-man executive committee, elected at congresses and with different military and political responsibilities. A 21-man Politburo would further check decisions and connect the movement with its affiliated &quot;mass organizations&quot;, UGTSARIO, UJSARIO and UNMS (see below).

But after the movement took on the role as a state-in-waiting in 1975, based in the refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria, this structure proved incapable of dealing with its vastly expanded responsibilities. As a consequence, the old military structure was wedded to the new grass-roots refugee camp administration which had asserted itself in Tindouf, with its system of committees and elected camp assemblies. In 1976, the situation was further complicated by the Sahrawi Republic assuming functions of government in the camps and Polisario-held territories of Western Sahara. The SADR and Polisario institutions often overlapped, and their division of power was often hard to ascertain.

A more comprehensive merger of these different organizational patterns (military organization/refugee camps/SADR) was not achieved until the 1991 congress, when both the Polisario and SADR organizations were overhauled, integrated into the camp structure and further separated from each other. This followed protests calling for expanding the internal democracy of the movement, and also led to important shifts of personnel in the top tiers of both Polisario and SADR.

===Present structure===
The organizational order described below applies today, and was roughly finalized in the 1991 internal reforms of the movement, although minor changes have been made since then.

The Polisario Front is led by a secretary general. The first secretary general was Brahim Gali, replaced in 1974 by El-Ouali at the II Congress of the Polisario Front, followed by Mahfoud Ali Beiba as interim secretary general upon his death. In 1976, Mohamed Abdelaziz was elected at the III Congress of the Polisario, and held the post until his death in 2016. The secretary general is elected by the General Popular Congress (GPC), regularly convened every four years. The GPC is composed of delegates from the Popular Congresses of the refugee camps in Tindouf, which are held biannually in each camp, and of delegates from the women&#x27;s organization (UNMS), youth organization (UJSARIO), workers&#x27; organization (UGTSARIO) and military delegates from the SPLA (see below).

All residents of the camps have a vote in the Popular Congresses, and participate in the administrative work in the camp through base-level 11-person cells, which form the smallest unit of the refugee camp political structure. These typically care for distribution of food, water and schooling in their area, joining in higher-level organs (encompassing several camp quarters) to cooperate and establish distribution chains. There is no formal membership of Polisario; instead, anyone who participates in its work or lives in the refugee camps is considered a member.

Between congresses, the supreme decision-making body is the National Secretariat, headed by the secretary general. The NS is elected by the GPC. It is subdivided into committees handling defense, diplomatic affairs, etc. The 2003 NS, elected at the 11th GPC in Tifariti, Western Sahara, has 41 members. Twelve of these are secret delegates from the Moroccan-controlled areas of Western Sahara. This is a shift in policy, as the Polisario traditionally confined political appointments to diaspora Sahrawis, for fear of infiltration and difficulties in communicating with Sahrawis in the Moroccan-controlled territories. It is probably intended to strengthen the movement&#x27;s underground network in Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara, and link up with the rapidly growing Sahrawi civil rights activism.

In 2004, an anti-ceasefire and anti-Abdelaziz opposition fraction, the Front Polisario Khat al-Shahid announced its existence, in the first break with the principle of &quot;national unity&quot; (i.e., working in one single organization to prevent internal conflict). It calls for reforms in the movement, as well as resumption of hostilities with Morocco. But it remains of little importance to the conflict, as the group had split in two factions, and Polisario has refused dialogs with it, stating that political decisions must be taken within the established political system.

==Armed forces (SPLA)==
==Defections==
Since the end of the 1980s, several members of the Polisario have decided to discontinue their military or political activities for the Polisario Front. Most of them returned from the Sahrawi refugee camps in Algeria to Morocco, among them a few founder members and senior officials. Some of them are now actively promoting Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, which Morocco considers its Southern Provinces.

==Foreign relations==
Today 38 countries around the world recognize the legitimacy of the Polisario over Western Sahara. Support for the Polisario Front came mostly from newly independent African states, including Angola and Namibia. Most of the Arab world had supported Morocco; only Algeria and Libya have, at different times, given any significant support to Polisario. Iran recognized the SADR in 1980, Mauritania had recognized the SADR in 1984, and Syria and South Yemen had supported the Polisario position on the conflict when they were all members of the Front of Refusal. Additionally, many third world non-aligned countries have supported the Polisario Front. Ties with Fretilin of East Timor (occupied by Indonesia in 1975) were exceptionally strong and remain so after that country&#x27;s independence; both Polisario and Fretilin have argued that there are numerous historical parallels between the two conflicts.

The movement&#x27;s main political and military backers were originally Algeria and Libya, with Cuba coming a very distant third. Mauritania also attempts to avoid involvement and to balance between Morocco and Polisario&#x27;s backers in Algeria, although it formally recognizes the SADR as Western Sahara&#x27;s government since 1984 and has a substantial Sahrawi refugee population (around 30,000) on its territory. Support from Algeria remains strong, despite the country&#x27;s preoccupation with its own civil war. The Polisario is practically dependent on its bases and refugee camps, located on Algerian soil. While Sahrawis&#x27; right to wage an armed struggle against Morocco, and has helped to equip the SPLA, the government also seems to have barred Polisario from returning to armed struggle after 1991, attempting to curry favor from the US and France and to avoid inflaming its already poor relations with Morocco.

Apart from the Algerian military, material and humanitarian aid, food and emergency resources are provided by international organizations such as the WHO and UNHCR. Valuable contributions also come from the strong Spanish solidarity organizations.

===Western Sahara in the Cold War===
The most intense open warfare in the conflict in Western Sahara occurred during the Cold War. However, the conflict was never fully dragged into the American–Soviet dynamics like many other conflicts. This was mainly because both sides tried to avoid overt involvement, which would necessitate a crash in relations with either Morocco or Algeria – the major North African players – and because neither viewed it as an important front. Morocco was firmly entrenched in the US camp, whereas Algeria aligned generally with the Soviet Union during the 1970s, and took a more independent &quot;third-worldist&quot; position after that.

The United States claimed political neutrality on the issue, but militarily backed Morocco against Polisario during the Cold War, especially during the Reagan administration. Despite this, Polisario never received counter-support from the Soviet Union (or the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the third and junior player in the Cold War). Instead, the entire Eastern Bloc decided in favor of ties and trade with Morocco and refused to recognize the SADR. This made the Polisario almost wholly dependent mainly on Algeria and Libya and some African and Latin American third world countries for political support, plus some NGOs from European countries (Sweden, Norway, Spain, etc.) which generally only approached the issue from a humanitarian angle. The ceasefire coincided with the end of the Cold War. World interest in the conflict seemed to expire in the 1990s as the Sahara question gradually sank from public consciousness due to decreasing media attention.

===International recognition of the SADR===

A key diplomatic dispute between Morocco and Polisario is over the international diplomatic recognition of the SADR as a sovereign state and Western Sahara&#x27;s legitimate government. In 2004, South Africa announced formal recognition of the SADR, delayed for ten years despite unequivocal promises by Nelson Mandela as apartheid fell. This came since the announced referendum for Western Sahara was never held. Kenya and Uruguay followed in 2005, and relations were upgraded in some other countries, while recognition of the SADR was cancelled by others (Albania, Chad, Serbia); in 2006, Kenya suspended its decision to recognize the SADR to act as a mediating party.
